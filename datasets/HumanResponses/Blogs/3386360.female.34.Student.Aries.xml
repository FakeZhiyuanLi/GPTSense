      I woke up to late to get Alexis out of here before Travis showed up. I tried. She spent the night becuase of things going on down at her house but I wont do it again. I'm tired of the bullshit plain and simple. She's been here most of the day and then to find out that they lied to me again about going to the hospital to visit someone I'm beyond pissed off. They've been gone almost 2 hours. Oh well I quit. I know what I have to do and tomorrow I will do it. I wont like it but I am turning his ass in. Kelley has had it to. Marina is so full of fucking shit with her ok one minute and not the next. I quit.  Today I could not get out of bed for anything. I kept falling back asleep but I wasnt really sleeping if that makes sense. Each time I turned around I kept getting weird feelings. I just couldnt seem to wake up.. Oh well all I want to do is go back to bed. I think it has to do with the depression. Depression and worry. Plus the fact it seems I just have so much running around here with no real time to myself and the time I do have to myself I'm busy thinking about things. (shrug) it will get better.   Well A.C. hasnt shown up. Tomorrow is the 1st. He said he would be back by then. I guess .. well I wont write it here I cant put words to it. I hope that M. is right and as much as I try I cant seem to hold on not when so much is going on in my life it is asking to much. But then I'm use to being the strong one alone depending on myself. Nothing will change. Where ever he is I hope he is safe. I must go I know this is short but I want to do a few things and then go back to bed and maybe read something.. Get lost in a book or whatever..

      Lol ok so I like the title. It's a combination of a couple of things. Last night I was childless.. almost.. Until Alexis down the road figured it out and wanted to spend the night. Which was fine. I just had looked forward to a childless night but it was a comfort for someone to be with me. I dont know what i will do if I'm alone when the kids grow up. I found I had panic attacks last night until Alexis came down which scares me. Being alone ws something I actually use to look forward to. Maybe it's the fear of where I live. I dont know. I just know that after she came over I felt more safe and was able to relax. Though I do miss running around the house nude. Lol.   I've thought about life and what I want. I cant have anymore babies but I wish I could. AC talked about babies in one of his e mails to me and I blew up not having faith in him or us. I blew up thinking that I would not be good enough but then it hit me there are so many options out there in this world. And now I find myself looking at baby stuff thinking of adoption. Would he want to ? I dont know it is something we will have to talk about when we get together. I woke up this morning hearing the phone ring but it wasnt. I kept thinking today he will come through that door but I think he wont. I just have more of a jittery feeling today. I know it wont happen but I can wish. I dont know why I know it wont it's just a gut feeling but something inside of me is jello. I want to sleep more. I'm tired and I am thinking of going back to bed soon.  I will write more later today when I am more able. Right now I'm rather sad watching Travis and Alexis. Young love even though I dont approve of the age thing I cant help but see the way the light up for each other. Travis is attempting to get his life back together. I'm giving him a couple of "tests" to see if he is for real or not. Time will tell.. *Later* Well I dont think Travis is going to pass any type of test of mine. He's already making excuses. I've had it as far as he is concerned his temper tantrums has me on edge and I am sick of his pissy moods. He was pissed off because Tony was in my room talking to me and ALexis was in the room with us, pissed off enough to storm out and slam doors and be a baby.    I keep waiting for AC but no luck as of yet. I hope and pray he is safe. I realize that the "talking" process could be delaid a bit due to what he will ahve to go through but I still worry. He is still strong in my heart and .. well I just cant write about it. Joey is home now with me. Tony is back and in a better mood. Dave will be staying here for a few weeks until he can get the money together to get his own place. He is having me hold his money so that he knows he wont spend it. I dont mind him at least he is respectful and doesnt allow his temper to get the best of him but damn I'm starting to feel like my place is a flop house and I dont like it. I know that by July it will be back to being mine thankfully. I just hope and pray that AC is around by then.    I found a new drink. It's a minute maid type drink called Strawberry Passion. Damn it was so good. :) I cant wait to get another but not something I am going to get alot of due ot price. I hate being so damn poor. I had a dream that AC came to me and we talked and that his life was changing in ways that he couldnt explain and he ended up being close by here. His normal life that he led was suddenly different. It was nice to think of us as a couple. I smile privately at the thought each time. The thought of us together makes me so happy. Not even the thougt of Dave catches my attention anymore and he is the eyecandy of the year. I'm so glad that he and I chose to be nothing more then just friends. I know that we will never do anything. Well I should go. I'm being IMed to death Lol.. AC wherever you are look towards the sky and know I am looking there as well. My heart and soul..

      I'm shocked I can get on today. Last night the computer was messing up so much. I had such a fear I might miss something from AC that I had M. write him. I have a feeling I now know what the part of e mail he thought I missed was. Do I have the faith for this ? Goddess above I hope so. So much has happened I do not know if I have the strength to go on.   Ricky's death. The first thing. I feel badly today is the funeral. 4 hours from now. I hope and pray things are ok and that my sister finds peace and that my remaining nefew finds peace.   Tony / Joey. Was this a combination or two seperate things I dont know. Joey's problems with school has taken a toll on me and on him. The stress from school the problems he faces the lack of help that we get. Emotionally it has been a battle feild. Last night Tony snapped. Joey didnt want to be here anymore and left. Tony contenued to have a problem. It was just to much. I feel dead inside. His rudeness and insensitiveness was more then I could handle and I honestly, as much as it hurts, hopes he stays back with his father and does not come back. Yes it will be harder money wise but emotionaly I am not sure it will be so hard. Tony's lack of manners gets to me more then anything. Joey notices the fact Tony pushes people's buttons to piss them off and then gets all defensive saying that he was only joking that we dont have a right to get upset but then he is allowed to get upset and blow up at anyone and everyone for "joking" with him. Last night I told Tony he had three choices. He could straighten up and talk to me so we could figure out what is going on, he could end up in jail due ot his constant parole violations (ie. leaving the house and so on) or he can go back to his father's house and his dad could beat some sense into him. Tony played what he thought was his trump card when in fact it was actually his death card. He told me that "If you send me away you will lose another son" I knew he meant Breck. I went cold and dead inside. He used that as a trigger to hurt me and all it did was make me not give a shit about things I have had to much stress. So when he walked out the door I picked up the phone and I called the police and reported it. After he got back the police showed up. Then he left again to go down to where Joey was. I was called by the mother and I went down there. I was so very proud of Joey though I know he was hurting so much in his heart. He stood up to Tony and said "I've taken crap from you for to long and I wont take it anymore" Bless my little one for having a backbone. Tony still was being a prick. He came home and did the first smart thing he did all night. He called Elaina and asked her mom if he could stay there for the weekend. YAY. he's out of the house. As soon as he was gone I was able to take a real breath without thinking I would lose my temper. In stead afterwards Iwent into my room and cried. I can not deal with this pressure anymore. I love Tony but I can not live with him.  I can not live with the wanting things his way or no way and when he doesnt get his way he throws a fit.  I live in fear and I cant deal with it. Tony views himself the man of the house, no other male to stand up to him and I have no one to lean again when I am scared. Joey will be visiting David this weekend. Thankfully he will have a break. I may very well ask Dave to take me to the beach if it contenues to rain. If it lets up I will ride the bus. I need to get away.   So was Joey's issues with school the third ? or is Cole not coming back the third. Things run in sets of three. So close to the end of the month, no email from him, no call as of yet nothing. My heart is breaking and I need to feel weak I need someone to hold me and make it ok for me to be weak for a short time. I need this cup within me to overflow and empty so that I can be strong and deal with things again. I know the thing with Tony has not ran it's course. We still need to talk and figure out what he will do and what choice he makes. I am lost.

      Damn I pay the bills here and yet I get jumped. Travis got on the phone while watching a movie. I asked who he was talking to becuase he paused the movie. Ok first of all he got up late to watch the movie without even thinking maybe just maybe someone else might want to watch something. Then to know he paused it to talk to some female (ugh she's a major pain) when the movie will stop in 5 minutes and we will have to restart it again I told him and he got all defensive with me. I lost it and basically told him when the phones are in his name and he pays for the damn bills then he will have a right to tell me I cant ask who he is talking to until then he better shut up and answer my question before I disconnect the fucking phone and "ground" him from it perm. So much for if I sleep I will not be a b*tch. Though last night I ended up staying awake and everything because I kept hearing Travis and the damn video game and his stupid music. When I would ask him to turn it down he would get defensive and I woudlnt even say a WORD all I would do is walk in and point downward and he jumped me defending himself that it was Joey who had turned up the bass NOT him.. (sigh) He's defensive, I think he is scared and with good reason.     Nothing from AC yet. Almost 3 weeks sense I last heard from him. It's almost the end of the month. Will he show ? Will he be real? I keep going back and re reading the second to last note he sent, He made a reference to it in his last e mail saying that I might have missed something. What coudl I have missed.. Was it a note that he might be late ? Was there something hidden ? I read it several times. THere is only one part in there that had me concerned that was the "death" conversation. The death but not real death... But then why would he promise to be here by June ? No that couldnt be it. He told me he doesnt break promises.      I am going to go do laundry. It never ends. Tonight I'm making steak. Nothing as good as what I could do but it is something. I'm going to bake it so it's more tender, then I'm going to make gravey with mashed potato's and corn. I might mix up some garlic butter and put some on some bread. I dont think we have any salad left due to the taco salad's I made night before last but oh well.    I had a dream last night, it's one I have had now for several days. I dont know how many. Cole is finally here and we are talking. It's his second day here and I ask him if he is for real because I dont see how someone like him could want someone like me. Almost in anger (not real anger but exasperation) he pulls into a mini market and goes in telling me to wait in the car (we were out driving) Then he comes out and we contenue to drive. We drive to a jewlery store and he buys a wedding ring set two bands and an engagment ring. As he slips the ring on my finger he asks me "Now do you believe me". Then we go and he drops me off at a bridal shop (he knows my dream of wanting a real dress for once) and I am instructed to pick out something simple and elegant (but not white with a laugh) he comes back and gets me an hour later and then he takes me to where I always get my hair done. The boys are waiting there and he gets them. I go in and get my nails done and my hair done and when he gets me we stop and get dinner, the boys are with us. I still dont know nothing and after dinner we start driving. I dont know where we are going but we start heading down I-5 away from Washington. He refuses to answer my question and the boys giggle when I ask them. About an hour into the drive he tells me we are going to Vegas. We stop on the way to Vegas to see my sister (who's son died) then we go into vegas and get married. We spend a couple of days there with the kids exploring and checking out things like circus circus and just being silly then we go back to California and visit the rest of the family and I take him to the town where I grew up to say good bye to my past. Then we head back to Washington. It is only when we are heading back to Washington that I wake up. I feel the ring on my finger still. It's a sweet dream. One that leaves me feeling a sense of comfort.     More later when i am more able to write without being silly.

      Today my head is spinning still. I overslept which was fine as Tony was sick and I wasnt sending him to school. Joey is gone down at a baseball game. I have so much to do but spending time in bed has made me lazy. Still no letter from AC. I'm hoping something comes soon. He said he would be back by June and it is nearly that time. I have no patience and tend to worry even though he has a couple of days left. Will he make it ? I hope so. Three loads of laundry left to do. School meeting with Joey's school today at 3. Travis will take me not something I am looking forward to. I will be writing more later and letting you know how the school meeting goes. Well it went as well as can be expected considering the whole thing was a waste of time. Oh well at least it is over and done with. Still nothing from AC. I know it's time to wait and learn patience but I am still starting to worry. OTher then that things are good. I am going to go and get some sleep. It's only 6:20 but I need to sleep. Right now everyone is talking in the background and stuff. Until later Hugs

      Well today so far has been adventerous. We made it to the store to pay the phone bill. Scared me cuz they had a dollar service charge and I had to use the quarters for laundry to pay that. I am glad that I had it with me. Then when I got home Joey wanted to go to the store and so I took Travis' keys and drove. YAY I got to drive. Ok so it was only down the road in an alley but I still got to drive. I was excited. There was a man standing there I almost wanted to ask who he was because there was something about him but I didnt. All I could think of was coming home and getting away from the driving before I was caught. Lol. The antsy feeling still hasnt stopped. I'm hoping it means that AC is closer to coming here. My e mail is sitting up waiting for something from him and I sit around watching it like a hawk. I feel so silly. AC is so worth it though. I look at the calander. 5 days left until the end of the month. I hope he makes it.  I get home and Tony is sleeping on the couch. He's not feeling well. The stress from the last few days has gotten to him alot. He feels guilty for not remembering Ricky but it is normal for all the abuse that he has gone through to forget his past. I do not want to talk to him about things because I do not want to give him false memories. I also found Matt doing dishes. What a nice treat. Not to have to do dishes for a change. I sure do miss a dish washer Lol. I did a load of laundry (whites) and need to get them sorted and folded and ready for people to put away. To have a washer and dryer for the kids to do their own clothes would be heaven Lol. M asked me last night if I wanted to live the American Dream. Yes I told her, I want to it's what I've dreamed of all my life. Well I should close this out, finish up a few things and then log off line.

      I woke up this morning about 3 a.m. and could not go back to sleep. You know that "just before the dance" jitters you would get as a teen ? Well I got those. If I wouldnt have woke the whole house i would have gotten up and started cleaning or something. I dont know what it was. I flittered around tossed and turned and finally got back to sleep but I still woke up with the jitters. I dont know maybe it's because I have the phone bill to pay today, I always stress during bill paying due to money issues. Maybe that was the problem. Ether way I am going to finish writing this and talking to DK (The MP friend of mine who is helping down the road) and then clean the livingroom from the night before mess. The joys of going to bed before anyone else means I get to clean te mess up from the night before after I go to bed that everyone makes Lol. Still no e mail from AC but I hold out hope and faith. Today I have to get the school work for J due to his suspension. Tomorrow is the conference to get him back to school. I will be so glad when this school year is over and he is out of that school. T. is having trouble adjusting to things right now I think mainly due to Ricky's death. My heart goes to him because he is seriously struggling. If I had the chance / money I would take him and J back to California for a short visit maybe it would open the gates to his memory but then I am scared of what it would do. I know it could only help but as a mother I want to protect him. But no sense in saying "what if". I had a day dream today. I was looking at dresses (started out looking at skirts and then I went into dresses) and I saw this beautiful dress (saved in favorites)and the first thing I thought of was "beautiful simple garden wedding" oh gosh am I bad. Of course then my mind went in a weird direction (as is the norm with me as of late) AC comes down and we hit it off (this part of the dream is the same) and we head off down to California to visit with my sister, we swing in to visit all the family and I show him parts of where I grew up. Then onto the normal fantasy of Vegas and a quick wedding. I know I am silly but the fantasy is sweet. Ok well I am going to call my sister, clean up the livingroom and maybe catch a nap. I might write more later I dont know ether way I love you AC and you are here with me in spirit until you can get back here in person.

      AOL has lost my file cabnet. Which had several days journal in it so now I am going to write here. Which will be for all to see but I do not care. So I am going to start out by stating AC is the man who I want to spend my life with. I am going to diary to him here like I was on AOL before they lost all my stuff. So this at least for a time being will be dedicated to my "diary" to AC. You see AC holds a huge part of my heart and one day I hope to make a life with him. One of those that you read about in novels but dont dare dream to come true. Now we wait only for him to come home from over seas. So I write daily to him, because I feel this way he will be able to keep up on things. So here goes.   The dreams kept flooding again last night even in the wake of horror of losing Ricky. I still feel it has to be a dream. But this morning I woke up to the stark reality of it being truth. I had wrote an e mail to myself last night just so this morning I could realize it was not a night mare that my beloved little one was gone and I would never see him again even though I knew 10 years ago I wouldnt. It still is hard to think of him being gone. I still feel like I'm in a fog. His poor mother must be hurting so. I know what it is like to lose a child though her loss is so final where as mine is still a mystery. My beloved baby has been gone sense 1997 and the loss of my sister's child has made my heart ach for my youngest even more. Will I ever hold him in my arms again ? Will I ever be able to know he is safe. As long as I know he is safe I think I could live without though it would hurt me. I think the not knowing is what hurts the most. The boys are taking the loss of Ricky hard, T is attempting to be strong though feeling guilty for not remembering him while J is being emotional and staying to himself. I assure T that his not remembering is normal due to the abuse he suffered that shutting out past is part of the protective state that some go through but he still feels as if he has some how betrayed himself and Ricky. I long to have you near me AC because I want and need to feel like life will go on and that things will be ok. Right now that isnt happening. I know that what you are doing is important and you have not even heard the news yet. I know in my heart that when you do you will come and hold me and make my world all better. I admit for a breif moment in time (part of the day and part of last night) I had a fear this was all a joke to you that it was a cruel game but then I realized I had to have faith, like you have faith in me. I re read some of the stuff you sent me and I felt comfort. I can not seem to touch you like I use to but then I know I have shut down myself emotionally. My kitchen on the other hand has felt the labors of my hearts pain. I scrubbed the floors on my knees today and cleaned cubboards and everything though I know I could have done more (such as move the stove) I didnt dare. Tomorrow if the pain has not gone away I will do the livingroom. I threaten to rearrnage it just to make it appear different. I need change so much right now. I am standing in a pool of stagnte water and I feel as if I am drowning. It will get better. Right now I am preoccupied with worry for your safe return home my heart.. and now preoccupied with thoughts and memories of my Ricky.  Well AC I hope you approve of the "diary" I dont care who reads it. I love you and long for you to hurry home.

      His smiling face as he looked up at me made me smile. A smile that touched me for the first time in years. Holding that little angelic baby in my arms washed away all the pain from the past. Not my child, the child of my sister he still held my heart. I watched him grow and protected him with my life. I would spend hours upon hours watching him, listening to him. laughing and loving him. As time went on and I had a family of my own I still had a special space in my heart for the baby that thawed my abused heart. When I moved he was all that I would honestly miss aside from my mother but I knew in my heart my mother would follow me. I knew that I would never see my beloved nefew again. I told my sister he would not live to be in his mid 20's. I told her to keep him from motorcycles if she wanted to see her son alive. She thought I was joking. I left the state and never saw him again. That was 1994 10 years ago. This was the child that tore down all the walls, he was at one point in time the one who kept me alive.    I found out last night at age 22 he was hit and killed by a train while riding his motorcycle. I'm not sure of all the details. I am to say the least estranged from my family.. I'm numb. My heart is ice again.

      Save the world.. those are the words that most people use when discribing me. I'm always the one who helps out those who need it not asking for anything in return. I will go to bat for someone as long as they dont lie to me or steal from me. Well there was quiet a delima not long ago that has finally come to a head even after all my pleaing to stop... T. a 22 year old sex offender begun to live with a family who allowed him to sleep in the same room and bed as their 14 year old daughter. When she became pregnant the parents blamed "him" but still did not do anything about it except ask him to leave. This is where I came in. They asked me C. please let him stay with you, we want him involved with the baby we just dont want him here. Come to find out the reason why is because THEY would go to jail if the cops found him in the house due to the pregnancy. So of course I allow it. It helped me also to get back on my feet from another disaster of "save the world" I agreed to give him a few weeks to get his life together and get into his own place. There were rules. No lying PERIOD, no stealing PERIOD. Then I begun to see how they were treating him and my heart begun to feel for the guy. I dug a bit into his record and found the sex offense was a rape when he broke into a place but the DNA didnt match him but he still went away. So I thought ok lets give him the benifit of the doubt. The parents were "friends" one moment and "enemies" the next. There were so many times (enough I lost count) where one moment he could talk to the girl the next he wasnt allowed near her then it was ok then it wasnt. To the point where I finally said "You cant speak to her again on my phone". So what happens. On one of the "good" days with the parents (I should say mother the step father has been rather consistant with no contact) they go out of town and she calls, he calls her back without me knowing it and then he tells me he is going to go for a walk. Out the door he goes. A few hours later I get a phone call from the mother. He's with the girl and this time she has had it and is going to call the cops. I can not say I blame her. He went over without permission, lied to me, lied to everyone. Then come to find out he's been attempting to get a 15 year old girl in bed with him online, along with a few other things. After having spoken with some people and after having done some research myself (I am a registered counselor)I have now allowed the blinders to come off and see him for the predator he is. I am sorry he has turned out this way, I am sorry his life will be over at such a tender age but to know what I know and to realize that he will never stop praying on children I realize that the safest place for everyone is for him to be behind bars.

      First off I want to thank M. for giving me this information to BLOG. Awesome site sis and your the best. Lets see who I am. A dreamer. Literally. My heart belongs to someone so dont ask. He is overseas now and I pray he is safe. I am a mother of three boys. Two of which are with me and one has been gone for many years. I hope that I can find him soon. The loss of my son has left a hole in my heart. I love to write, my web site has some samples of my writing on it. Though I will never have the courage to submit my writing to be published writing to me is an escape and I enjoy it greatly. We shall see where this leads. I'm not sure if I want people reading my personal stuff but I will see if I can keep the "sensitive stuff" out. So here goes for now.

      To say I love my new doctor is an understatment. She is beyond awesome. I wish to hell I had found her earlier.. WHY ?? Because of the health issues that I have now that I didnt have before or at least were NOT detected until now. I have no idea what my colesteral is that panel was done today. I will find out. I do have Diabetis (sp) which no one knew about until now, or rather no one bothered to inform me of until now. She is hoping we caught it in time and with weight loss we can get it under control. I am also on an asprin regement due to my heart, blood pressure medication (with a water pill added into it) and thyroid medication. I was expecting that. She also has me on a medication for something with the diabetic thing. So all in all it wasnt bad news. It wasnt the best ether but.. (smile) at least we are getting things taken care of. She is a great lady and I am so glad that I found her. She is awesome. I cant say it enough.   Ok now that the news is over and things are going to be ok I know i will be fine. I am now on 4 medications (including the asprin) but I can manage. To say the least I am / was scared to death when she said Dibetic. She wants me to lower my caffine intake. Ok I can do that. She wants me to start a good exercise regement. Ok I can do that. Once TOny finds out he will make sure I do what i need to do. She said that my eating habits are ok. She wishes I would eat better but she said that will take time to overcome the mental problem (ie. fear of getting heavy)  She did say that even though it was life threatening we did catch things in time. She is concerned that I dont know what my colesteral is but that will be ok I know it in my heart. Things will be good.

      If that no good for nothing SOB thinks that I am allowing MY son to go visit him he is flying high on drugs AGAIN. T.'s sperm donor James has moved out of his state where he was living and has informed T. NOT to tell me where he is. I am not to have the number or address. To top it off he wants T to stay longer then agreed. BULLSHIT. I refuse to send my son back if his biological sperm donor is going to suddenly be so secretative. FUCK HIM. excuse the lang. This is the man who demands to know my every move almost. THe man who insists that we have to "work" together to raise T the best we can. Umm excuse me ? He's so fricken full of himself. He stopped child support as soon as T. said he didnt want to live with him and now he has moved and told T. that "mom will get all the information later" T said in a threatening tone. T. thinks that his dad is thinking of not sending him back. Horse PUCKY. I'm furious. I could.. grrr.. So Mr. I dont want her to know nothing can just suck on a sour lemon and twitle his thumbs he might be lucky if I grace him a visit IF he agrees to MY terms. At this point in time would be to visit T. here in Washington state ALONE (no wife and kids)... No I will allow T to go back on a few conditions. A. *I* get a phone number and address and explaination on why he was attempting to make it a secret and B. he stays for the agreed amount of time (July 19th thou Aug 20) no later. C. I call T when I want and D. T has the right to come home sooner if he feels he needs to.  If that scum sucking pond dwelling bottom feeding parasit doesnt agree well then he can kiss my lily white Italian rear..     How I wish A.C. was here to make sure things would go ok. I know it's my responsiblility but it would be nice to have someone else here at times to lean on even if it was in e mail. I wish he would e mail me and let me know what is going on even if it is to say "Good Bye".. (sigh)     Well I got the place. I'm so scattered brain not even sure I wrote that. Yeah I did cuz I wrote A.C. and gave him the new address. I was suppost to help Robin move today but it's almost 1 and still no word from her. I'm not going to wait around for her. No offense but that pisses me off becuase she is so worried about getting out of there and moving into her new place and yet she spends her free time with some guy who is treating her like crap. But it's her life and she has to live it and I support that I just wish that she would pull her head out of her butt and do her priorities...

      No I dont mean the group Lol.. I got a call today from Joe H. the Owner of the place I was looking at.. *I* GOT IT ! ! ! I'm so excited. Ok now if I can borrow 100 bucks until the 1st. I will be able to move in. The 100 would get me enough to move in and get some food. I'm so excited. I know it would be easier if I didnt move in until the 1st money wise but I have to do something. :) Ok   yesterday I didnt get to blog at all due to time. I was finally online to do some research and each time I started to blog someone needed me or Luci (the ferret) disconnected the computer. After the second time she ran off and pouted. It was so adoreable. So I will try to catch up. Travis has contenued to break the restraining order. I'm not thrilled. Though I'm not thrilled with anything down in that area. I cant wait to move so that Travis cant follow and it will ease up on the stress.   I am very concerned about Tony going back to see his dad. His dad is not in one place and doesnt have a study place to live or home phone number. He is "staying' with friends until he gets into a new place. I guess the lady he married her kids are with their grandfolks. I'm glad they wont be around but I am worried of the stress that this is going to put on Tony. I dont like the fact he isnt in a stable place. James is very reluctant to give any information at all. Even his own cell phone number. But I know that in order for Tony to go back there that he will have to provide us with an address and all that. The thing is even if he tries to keep Tony the order is only good for certain times that Tony is allowed away from me. Lol Legally so I have that on my side.   Still nothing from A.C. and I'm growing more and more concerned. I will be sending you a letter my heart as soon as I am done with this giving you my new address and praying that you hurry home. I miss your e mails so much. I still am attempting to be faithful to tbe blog so that you know what is going on in my life. I just am not as mushy on here as I would be in private letters mainly because everyone can read this Lol.   Happy Kitty

      I have not wrote in a few days because i have been so busy. My online time the last two to three days has been about 1 maybe 1.5 hours total. Even now I am pressed on time. It all started Tuesday when I had to wake up early and head out to go with Marina to get the restraining order against Travis. She had a CT Scan to go to in the same area so instead of having to go there come back and get me and then go get the TRO I went with her. The CT scan machine locked up so we were unable to do that until later that afternoon. I was gone from 9 until 6:30. (almost 7) When I got home Dave had taken the Amp out of the house against wishes and we had a huge blow up over that. We had not even begun to settle down from that when Travis arrived home and Kelley served him with the restraining order of which Travis (knowing this was going to happen) lost his temper and almost beat an MP. Travis then promply goes and breaks the restraining order (didnt get caught luckly) then comes home and calls Alexis 2 times. (still doesnt get caught)I get to bed about midnight 12:30 ish and get woke up at 1:20 by Tony and Joey fighting (fist to fist) over the fact Tony wouldnt move out of Joey's way to get a glass to get something to drink and Joey called him a "fag". (sigh) I finally get it settled down and back in bed about 3 and up at 6 to start another day of running around and doing things. Now today I'm going to help Robin pack and move some of her stuff providing she gets here. It's nearly 1 and she was suppost to be here about 10. Ok so we are working on Robin time.. Worse then Indian time Lol. Come to find out Dave came over today and was downloading stuff on the computer in the process has down loaded a virus. I'm going to just take the computer in to the shop and get it wiped clean and deal with it from there. I'm so sick of it. All the pictures and stuff are goign to need to be sent to e mail. I just dont want to deal with that it is going to take a long time. (sigh)   Well I should go. I have to drink my water (I just wolfed down toast) put the dinner in the slow cooker, wake up Tony, finish doing something with my hair and then hopefully Robin will be here. This morning I woke up at 6 to get Travis off to work went back to lay down for a few moments and ended up going to sleep until 11. It felt good to rest but in doing so I missed my time online and Joey was online when I got up and I dont kick him off because he doesnt get online often. So I cleaned and did some packing.   I have a lead on a place btw. I check it out today after 5. I hope I can get it. Other then that things are great.   me

      I seriously believe that men are allergic to work. I sit back and watch men that I know. How many of them hold a job ? I mean seriously hold a job. I dont know I do know that I'm surrounded by men who for one reason or another dont want to go to work. Dave wants to spend time getting stoned / drunk or fucking women so there are times he calls in 'sick'. Travis normally talks bad about when Dave does this yet this morning I get up and get him off to work and he tells me he doesnt feel like going. What is the frist thing he does? Picks up the phone to call Alexis. I swear I want to have him bend over so I can just shove her up his ass. He just got this job and he's fucking it off already. I will be so damn glad when I am out of here and I dont have to worry about the baby bullshit crap. I did take somethings back into my own hands last night. Someone called for Dave (some credit card company) and I told them that this was no longer a good number for him and to not call again and then I told Dave what I did. He was upset and I looked at him and said "yeah your point? Your not paying the bill, you never return their call and I am the one who gets the sarcasm. I refuse and if you dont watch it I will make it where your bimbo's cant call here ether" then I walked off. GO ME :) He came over last night and said "Mind if I use the phone" I looked at him and said "Figured it was the  phone or the computer" he asked me if I thought that was all he came over for. I said "no.. you come over to eat too". When he tried to defend himself I told him I was busy to go use the phone and leave me alone.    I finally got smart last night. At least it worked I dont know if it's considered smart or not. I have two fans in my room both blowing on me. I hate heat I tell ya I hate it. When I get up in the middle of the night I find it is still cooler out in the livingroom then in my room. The back door is normally open. Ok my window is open why is it so hot in my room ? So I finally put my fan in my window. I slept with covers ! ! ! YES it felt so good to be cool again. Ok so I know i"m not a genius I do this each year, forget about it until I do it. (sigh) but last night I slept so good afterwards.    Today I feel like something is going to happen. I dont know what it is. That butterfly feeling in my tummy. I hope it's something good. I could use a good break and I hope it's big good and not just small good. I mean I will take small good but I would really like big good type of break.    Well the bad news. :( I just called the school that Joey is suppost to go to and they said that his waiver was denied. No excuse why I have to wait for the pricipal to get into her office to let me know. His old school is being a bitch and not returning calls again. I have to call a doctors office in an hour to get a letter regarding acid reflex for Joey which will be another fight I can feel.. Oh when is that good news going to hit ? I'm looking at one bedroom apartments now. The 2 bedrooms that are within my price range are ether taken or in an area of town I will not move to. I rather go into a one bedroom and deal with that.    Well if that good news hits I will write more later. If not I might write more in venting regaring schools ether way I'm finishing this one for now and going to do some research online.

      I passed another class today :) Yay.. I've already gotten my first degree and even though it is only 5 dollars to get membership I dont have it right now nor the energy to work on my second degree. I never understood the need for "titles" anyway. I've been a practicing witch for 20 years (15 if you minus the time I was with Tyson and unable to practice) Still most of the things I needed to "learn" for 1st degree I knew already. The only things I didnt know pretained to the school itself. (ie. founder type information) As soon as I move and get settled I will start to go back to the witchschool with the intent to do my second degree. Right now I'm working through the last of the "free" classes. Granted ok I didnt go there for about 3 months but oh well. I enjoy the classes. I'm very glad A.C. told me about the school so long ago. Wow it seems like forever ago he said something about it to me.   Travis is still being a dick when it comes to Alexis. I swear you cant say a harsh word against her even if it is to complain about her calling and not letting you go because he gets all pissy but he can say nasty things about her all the time. I am so sick of the on again off again it's ok here and there bullshit that is going on. Oh well IF Marina does what she said she was going to then tomorrow he will get his restraining order. I'm real sick of the lies that Travis tells me all the time about going down to see her. I dont give a shit that he is throwing his life away hell if he doesnt get his head out of his ass *I* will be calling CPS myself before to long. I am so sick of all of it.    Well nothing from A.C. yet. I hope he knows I am thinking of him. I dream of him nightly and during the day I swear I can almost hear him next to me. I know soon he will come.

      It's beautiful out today. Sun shine and warm with a nice breeze. Ugh which means sunshine. The only positive to that is the fact I am doing laundry and I can hang it out to dry and not put it in the dryer. I hate the sun. I mean not hate as in wish it was gone but hate as in wish it wasnt so bright and so hot outside. So here I sit in the house doing laundry washing and hanging out to dry and washing and hanging out to dry. Attempting to get up the energy to do some more packing. Yeah right like that is going to happen. Tony just went to the store for soda. Personally I could use more water and will be drinking more. My blood pressure is way to high I think they are going to put me on medication for it. (sigh) Travis is in the bedroom on the phone. I swear I will be glad when I am moved out of here and he is NOT with me. Joey is at the movies with some friends. I'm thinking of watching the movie "Last Sameri" It looks good. Considering Tony enjoyed Troy he might like that one too. All Travis can do is talk about cars (boring) or bitch at people for saying Alexis' name. He got mad at someone for using the phone last night becuase he was "expecting" a call.. when Joey asked if it was Alexis he jumped Joey and yelled at him for thinking it. No it wasn't her it was her mother Marina. CRAP.. I swear I will be so glad when it's all done and over with. (sigh).    A.C. hasnt gotten back yet. I want to write him so much but I dont want to fill his mail box up. I know he said I could write anytime but. Gods I wish he would hurry home I am so worried with all the stuff going on overseas. I dont know what to write.

      12 years ago today I gave birth to you, my sweet little one. I almost lost my life and you almost lost yours. I remember holding you in my arms even to this day how small and tiny you were. Then you begun to grow and you brought a constant smile to my face even when you were bad because of how you always made it seem like a joke. It's been 7 long years sense I last saw you and I cry for you daily even when no one sees me. Today is going to be hard on me. My sweet angel boy how I long to be able to see you just to make sure you are ok. My perfect dream would be you would want to be with me but I know the lies you have been told. I remember 6 years ago when I last heard that angelic voice of yours "You gave me away becuase you dont love me, daddy told me so and so I dont love you no more Jeannie is my real mommy now not you" and then you slammed the phone down and I cried so hard I thought my heart would explode. Oh baby if only you knew the truth, if only you knew how much I did love you and how much you do mean to me. I have worried about you each day wondering if you were ok and alive. I promised myself so long ago when I let go of the hate and hurt that your daddy caused me that I would never let a cross word go against him if you were around so I will not write it here for one day I hope to be able to see you. My heart, you are my love and I can not even tell you how much you mean to me. I love you my youngest sweet son. I will as always say a prayer that you are safe and I will ask the Gods above to watch over you and care for you and I will ask the Goddess to kiss you good night as always with a little extra for it being your birthday. I long to be the one kissing you good night. I miss you so much I hurt.

      I woke up this morning with energy. What a shock. Maybe it was the fact that I knew that I was going to be going out and doing things today. Who knows maybe it was the fact I had such wonderful dreams of A.C. last night so real that it was almost scarey but I dont care I had great sleep and woke up wonderful and in a great mood. Joey and I caught the bus today to go to Fife to check out Ashmead college. I had thought  I would be disappointed due to location and so on. It's a little over an hour bus ride there. It was an adventure to say the least. First off we get there to the bus stops and we are on the wrong side to catch the wrong way bus. Oh well we get on the right bus and get there finally find the place and the lady who was our "guide" made a cheerleader look boring to say the least. She was beyond bubbly going "Yay" and clapping her hands. I signed paperwork and will go back tomorrow with more. Tomorrow I also get a free massage. Hey one of the perks for this class is 2 weekly massages ! I wont complain that is for sure. :) *giggle* Then Joey and I had taco bell for lunch. I ate to much and feel bloated now but I am still in a good mood. Nice bus ride home. It was so nice to spend time with Joey and be able to laugh with him I think this was something we both needed. So it looks like I will be going to Ashmead college for massage starting in late Aug. The drawbacks. 43.25 a month to pay for 8 months. The total cost for college is a little over 12,000 for the year. OUCH. Grants and loans will cover it thankfully. Though I wish I could just straigh up pay for some of it. I'm not sure what I will be doing as far as the need to get other supplies that are going to be needed but that is fine because I have this feeling it will all work out.  Still nothign on a new place. But that is fine. Yesterday I called the Landlord tenant place and they sent me to fair housing due to the sound that it is a discrimination thing. I'm the only disable person here and I'm the only one asked to move so far Lol..  Hey if they can do it go for it. :) I will keep all posted on it as more comes available.   I"m going to go watch a bit of GH and call M. I feel like I'm on a high for some weird reason.

      I just got off the phone with my older sister. Her husband just passed away and the wake is on Saturday. She attempted to tell the other family members but my other sister and oldest brother said they could not go becuase they were still grieving for my nephew and my other brother can't make it becuase his children have an important function that he needs to take them to and it would all be to inconvenant yet they wanted her there for my nephew's funeral, ohhing and ahhing over how important she was and how glad they were she was back in their lives and how they would always be there for her and yet when her husband dies no one can be there for her. She said she understands why I cant and I am the only one who has a "pass" in her heart not to be there. HOw the hell can they do this ? They are all within a 2 hour radius of her and they can not go for stupid reasons. Yes my other sister's son died and she is grieving I understand that but her grieve is no less then my other sisters now. The fact my one brother wont go due to a function of his children why the heck cant his wife do it ? Is there something so important that he can not be there for his sister ? I've made up my mind. I intend to go to California when I am able (when A.C. comes back I will ask him) I intend to see my family and to tell them to F*ck off and die except my one sister. She is the only one who has even extended her hand to me and even though at times it is hard to deal with she is the one I know I can talk to. I can honestly say now that I am glad my mother is dead and doesnt have to bare witness in human form to this humiliation that my family is behaving. I am embarrassed and ashamed of my family except my oldest sister.

      Today the lady from the inspection NEVER showed up. No notice or anything so I wasted time waiting around the house for her. I was furious and left a nasty notice on her answering machine. Oh well. She never said that she didnt need to get into all the places and that they were only going to look at a couple of the places she made it appear that all the apartments were going to be looked at. Again I was FURIOUS  To make matters worse I get to the apartment I wanted and come to find out after I filled out the application and saw the place (and yes I loved it) that I have to make 3 fucking times the income to move in. Excuse me.. 3 fucking times ?? I make less then a 1000 a month that would mean what ? 300 a month for rent ? what is everyone smokin??? lol.. So looks like unfortunately I will have to look in my neighborhood and find something here :( I'm not thrilled and I am sick to death of this area.  To make all matters worse Marina suggests a bbq tonight. As she is talking I'm thinking to myself this sounds great. She said something about her getting hamburgers and I could get buns she already had hot dogs and I would grab some pop and we would stop at the store and grabs chips making it sound like boom we were splitting it. We stopped at the bakery first and I grabbed the buns. Ok that was what I had agreed to. We get to the store and we get the charcol (she demands the BIG bag) and grab the chips and hamburger meat and the soda (now remember we drink coke, she has to have diet though not sure why she's so damn fat, and Alexis can only drink sprite) so off in the cart those go. Get up to the counter and I start sorting it out and she is lumping it all together and then tells me "oh I dont have no money" .. 57 dollars total.. *I* am the one moving here folks ! ! ! Then we get home and she suggest we do this at "her" place. OH no that means four bags of chips and soda and buns and charcol gets left at HER place WHEN we are done ?? NO NO  NO NO I fell for that once before. I suggest my place, the t.v. is here and she doesnt have cable. Ok so we get here and fire it up and make it.. Now this woman makes me look thin ok I have nothing against fat people *I* am one but damn 11 hot dogs ??? ALONE by herself ??? plus 1/2 a bag of chips, 4 20 oz of soda and then she tells me "maybe I should eat hamburger".. UGH.. I had 1 fricken hamburger and a handful of chips and I was full. UGH again... HOW can she eat so much ?   Between her and Dave I have felt so damn violated lately. No violated and abused and taken advantage of. I should have walked out of the store and said NO.. but everyone was looking forward to it. I should learn.. :(   Well that is my day.. I wish I had the place but oh well I dont make the money. I refuse to ask anyone to "sign" with me. So it looks like it will be a place around here and we will all be stuck with the same stupid thing going on in our lives.. I wish to hell I had the money to move the hell out of state.   Nuff depression I"m going to go to bed soon. I want to finish talking to M. and then curl up and go to sleep.

      I talked to Rachael and she wants to stay with me. She will only stay a few days a month but thanks to her I can get the place I want AND she is reliable enough that when I need to stay for school I can. I'm glad for that. So here is the good news :) Tomorrow I will go in and see about getting the place. YAY.   Today has been hectic. Tomorrow I have inspection for the house which is fine I just have a few things left to do and it will be ready. I just wish taht I had a bit of help but oh well none around. No big deal. Easier in some ways to do it myself. Though I wish to fricken hell Joey would have finished the bedroom. Oh well.   Keeping this short it's almost 11 and I"m tired. I want to do a few things in my room before I go to bed.

      Dave walked through the door and trailing him was his latest little slut. Niki. Talk about a scuzzy looking slut. Anyway I asked him why he wasnt at work. He didnt feel like going in today. Excuse me ? Rent free, food free and you dont feel like going in so you can keep your job so you can move the fuck out ? On top of everything he tells me that if his "girlfriend" or "ex" (in front of Niki) calls again to tell her to "die".. excuse me ?? He sat and wrote to her that he didnt want to lose her and that he wanted to work things out with her and he's doing this shit ?? gods.. I get so tired of men like that. I see him as the player he is and I just want to walk away from everything. I see that if he got his head out of his butt he would be a great guy but.. sigh...   150 - 175 worth of food, most of it stupid things like mini frozen pizza's, big bags of chips, cakes, pies.. is all that he and Matt (Not going on Matt now because he's been gone) have brought into the house in the last what almost 4 months? give or take.. And Dave eats breakfast, lunch and dinner here.. *shakes head* This is a good lesson to me to NOT allow people in anymore without strict guildlines and NO MORE USERS..   oh well I hope he gets his life straightened out. His main priorities are drinking, smoking pot and parting with friends and now this new girl who I wish he had stayed with Crystal she at least had some class.

      My sister went to Idaho to find a house for her and her husband to retire to. Signed the paperwork and was all excited. Bob (her husband) would give anything to my sister. He knew her heart was in Idaho and so he agreed that sense she had given so much to him that he would retire there so that she could be happy. She talked to him the night before she came home telling him about the house and how perfect it was and that she signed the paperwork and that they could move in about 2 weeks. When she got home her ride said they needed to go right to her place because he had not been there to check on her dogs yet, he was suppost to go there from what I understood before my sister got home. When they walked through the door they found Bob my sister's husband dead. Most likely from natural causes. I mean there wasnt any talk of foul play. My poor sister is beside herself. For all her "trash talking" of Bob I know she loved him dearly. He did things that got on her nerves and she let me know it and did so in a way that unless one knew her you would think she didnt love him but I knew different. I'm not sure how much more of this death I can take. Now I am scared. it's happened to my sister(s) will it happen to me ? Who will go next ? Gods I hope that it was just a freak thing with Ricki and old age with Bob.    Nothing from AC yet. I'm not sure if I can deal with this. No this is not a cry for whatever when you read this sweetheart this is just me being melodramatic saying "oh woe is me" I will seek no one else out except you and I already said that until they show me the body I refuse to admit your gone. I will only be here for you no one else. I believe that someone if given a chance should grab love and hold on tightly. No we dont know where things are going with us, at this point in time. But I know enough that to me this is a great chance and I am not going to screw it up. My life can wait because to me I might have a chance at pure and total happiness and that chance is worth the sacrifice of a bit of time. We click so well in so many areas and I do not want to chance screwing things up at all. I'm tired of being hurt, I know your tired of being hurt and I think that if we click half as good as we think we might it will be worth the "fight" to work together to make a happy life. When I say "fight" I mean I know that things are not going to be all roses but that there might be times when things are bad and together we can survive as long as we fight together as a team.    Today I am going to go to Robin's new place to do a blessing. It will be nice to spend some time with her. I miss her alot we never get to spend time together. I wish that I was able to move into the same complex as she lives in now but I dont think that is going to happen. They have not called me back and I dont think that they will. I dont want to move to Parkland the other place that she found that has a good deal becuase it is to far away from where I am now. It is close to her work but I do not see her working there for much longer. I know that I will find a place. I just have to have some patience. Im going insane though. I found a perfect place but I am not able to get it money wise. I would be left with only about 30 dollars a month if that and I cant afford to do that. That would be after all bills were paid. That leaves nothing for clothes, food, misc things that are needed (ie. shampoo, tp, soap) but the place is so perfect. If childsupport was coming in then yes I could afford it. Oh well. I will have to settle for something else.     Well I need to go Robin will be here soon. Tony needs to get a haircut today and I think if I feel up to it I will teach him how to cook ribs. Ribs and rice sound real good for dinner tonight. I need to clean the kitchen (sigh) dont want to. Wish I had a dish washer other then myself. I just finished breakfast (of sorts) at noon Lol (well 5 til noon) and the more I see the house the more I want to scream. I dont know if this will ever get finished and done or if I even want to try. Well I should go.

      Last night I lost my temper in a way I've not lost it before though the person who I lost it at didnt get the effects until this morning. Yesterday Dave tells me that he is moving in with Jason. YAY. I crawl into bed thinking all is well with the world my house is slowly becoming my own again. About 1 in the morning my door opens up and Dave comes stumbling into MY room and crawls into bed and passes out. He smells like alcahol (sp) and I had eaten before going to bed so my stomach started turning. I got up and went out into the livingroom where Tony was talking on the computer. I asked him how long he was going to be up and he said a few more hours so I asked if I could sleep on the couch. He was not thrilled (adult talk I think lol) so I grabbed a pillow and went and slept on my bedroom floor or tried to. I got up and went outside and slept on the porch for awhile to settle my stomach. I was then going to find a warm blanket and go sleep out back but Tony woke me up and made me lay on the couch where I slept until 5:45. He was still online. I got up and went back in and laid on the floor in my room until my alarm went off. When Dave finally stumbled out of my room after noon today he asked me why I slept on the floor. I told him why. He then sulked off like it was MY fault. He's damn lucky I didnt tell him what all was on my mind. I am seriously thinking of writing a letter and giving it to him as soon as I am away from here though. I dont think he would do anything but I dont trust him totally if that makes sense.  Good news. I have started to pay on my student loan. Which now they are willing to write me a letter saying that I can go back to school. If I do this then I will go back to Massage school first. That will only take me a short time to learn and then I can go back in and see about finishing my pychology degree. I'm excited about it and I will be filing paperwork next week to get the grant to go back to school.  On top of everything I thought of how unjust it was that the school that Joey was going to was getting away with so much. Well I intend to go into small claims court and sue. Ok I know I wont win but it's the pricipal of the matter. Which btw I need to note in the lawsuit it is not against the pricipal of the school.. Sence starting to work with him things were starting to get better until this last thing happened. I will be sueing for emotional and pychologcial damages. I dont want to play any more. Like I said I know I wont win but I can at least go on record.  I wait paitenly for AC. I know he will be mad at this post due to the Dave thing but I know he will ask me about it and we can talk. I do wnat to say this right now NOTHING has happened between Dave and I in a sexual way. I think once AC finds out what I have literally supported Dave and Matt for 3 months putting myself into a worse financal bind he will be furious. I know I have learned a valuable lesson. No more freeloaders. I cant afford the emotional or finacale hardship any longer.

      I am going to blog while I can. I'm real tired. I finished my e mail today. Nothing special.. in other words nothing from AC. Lol.. Nothing from M.. two jokes from Robin and a question from Amy. I've been up a few hours and I'm ready to fall back to sleep. I'm so tired. I'm going to rest in the chair and watch t.v. for awhile. I thought if I ate it would help but it didnt. Kids are up except Tony but he stayed up until 4 letting me sleep on the couch. Poor kid. I'm feeling ok just ugh.. ya know. my head feels full, I feel dizzy but I feel ok. I wonder if it is some kind of viral infection (viral or whatever it is called) lab work all came back fine except thyroid well hello I knew that but that wouldnt make me feel this way.   Joey wrote a harsh letter to his ex girlfriend. They are / were still friends and each time he said something about another girl she got all upset but she could talk about her new boyfriend all she wanted. Joey basically told her that he wasnt going to bow down to her anymore and that she was acting like a slut. He said something about them having sex in the letter and she was so upset that she showed it to her mom Lol. Her mom didnt know that they had sex. She's not mad at Joey but is mad at the daughter. Joey at least came clean about it. Other then that. Tony is starting another cycle I think.. He's not in the best of moods but he doesnt know what is wrong. I personally think it's stress.. I would give anything to have the stress off these kids for awhile.   Joey was also suspended from school for the rest of the year.. Long story but basically a kid was yelling in his ear after several times of asking the kid to stop and the teacher knowing this the kid screamed in his ear again (he had a headache already) and then said "what gonna hit me" so Joey did not hard just smacked him. Nothing happened to the kid.. I swear I hate this school.. Ok i'm going to go rest..

      I'm making this a quick journal as I need to shower and be out of here within the hour. Please bear with me I will attempt if I can get to the computer to write more later. Last night I spent several hours at the hospital. Heart was beating so fast and felt a weight on my chest that was pure pain for awhile. Couldnt catch my breath good. My blood pressure was 175/110 when I got there. Several hours later (EKG and blood work and oxygen) it was 156 / 101 (not sure last reading) and with blood work saying I was ok (an irregular heart beat but study) I went home. I was sick one time at the hospital which is another reason they held me there and no one would listen it was due to heat and stress. The hospital room was so hot. I'm out though and doing ok. I have to go to Seatac airport and met my sister this morning for a few hours then I will come home and do nothing. Kids are staying home and will clean the house for me.   I will try to write more later.

      Well yesterday was a day. I got my blog caught up but didnt get to go back and finish it mainly due to pressure of time here. So here goes for yesterday. I had a list of things to accomplish and I got them all done with the exception of mailing one package out. This is to say also that some of the things on my list caused me to add even more to my origional list. I had a very productive day to say the least. For the   bad news ::  The apartment that I want is not available. I'm hoping beyond hope they will call me back and say something has come up. If not then I will take the second option. For the  stressful news::  Joey came home and said that some kid was "talking shit" about him and he and another friend went to the kids house and was ringing the door bell and kept ringing it until the kid answered then they hit the kid and took off. I am sick of the fighting. I basically went off on him stating that he was attempting to prove everyone right in being like Tony except that I didnt have this trouble with Tony at school just mainly at home. That I was sick and tired of the school calling me weekly (sometimes daily) regarding him and his actions and I was sick and tired of the way that he was acting. That there was no way I felt comfortable starting over in a new place if he was going to contenue to act like a fucking (yes I said it) jackass. He was furious at me but I dont care he needs to realize he has pushed me beyond what I am willing to except. I was willing to overlook some of the fights at school due to it being self defense but some of it wasnt and the disrespect for the teachers WILL stop ! I dont care if I have to start going to school with him to make sure he minds his damn tounge. There is not alot of cursing that goes on in this house and there is a reminder of respect constantly there is NO excuse for him to do this except he wants to be a jerk and I'm tired of it.  Good news::  the information I requested for the homes in VA are here. I feel in love with this one place and cant wait for AC to get here to show him. I'm so excited even though I know we have not figured out what is going on in life yet I still was excited about the information. I felt like we had connected in a way again. Also the phone calls are still coming. The empty blank line and when you dial the number back there is no ring just straight into a song being played it is so wonderful though I wish I knew what it meant.   Robin and her boyfriend had a close call. He said he felt that he wasnt giving her enough time (I told her NOT to push the damn issue but her insecurity gets her and it's REAL bad) and that because she needed more that maybe they should call it quiets until after things are settled down. She talked him out of it. I know that he doesnt want to break up with her I know that he cares about her alot but she is doing the same thing that she does each time she gets a boyfriend and she keeps pushing. I really feel sorry for her.   Ok I am dreaming here so forgive me. I started looking at new furniture dreaming of a new house. 3,000 to 3500 and I will be able to furnish the entire house with things I want and that is on the high end I could do it for less. I had this dream that AC came to me and wanted to "wait" on us getting a place in VA for awhile so that we could contenue to "date" but he was uncomfortable with my lack of funds so he offered to help pay for part of the rent type thing as he said he would be here a few days of the month. It was all a nice dream I know a way to ease my stress for a few moments of the money issues I am facing. Together we found a cute apartment I liked and he saw the stuff I was looking at in this add and said that we could get it and that he would be visiting faithfully each month and wanted to be comfortable when he was here. Ok I know it was a dream but it eased my stress while I had it. I dont want AC for his money I want him for the man he is. Ok well I'm off to dream some more of all sorts of things.. Hey have to have something to do while I do dishes and start to pack.

      Well yesterday was weird. Robin came over which was fun and we talked about both of us needing to move. She is going to see about me getting into the same complex as her. Ok so I cant really afford it but I cant afford anything so I will deal. It will mean cutting back on a few things but I can do that. The comfort is that Robin will be around for going places and we can hang out together. I miss friendship. Someone to talk to you know that coffee type thing. Or in our case Tea nether of us drink coffee. I really wish that AC woudl show up. Speaking of AC I got another one of those calls again. I wonder what they mean. I didnt get one the day he e mailed me and the following day. I got them starting three or four days before he e mailed me.. I dont know what to think. I know it is a sense of comfort. I mean seriously what are the odds of it being a "wrong" number ? ? ?  Today is laundry, dishes and bathing Luci. Luci is our ferret. WHich means *I* get a bath today. She loves to play. Not sure if she is playing or wanting out Lol.. Ether way it's a .. adventure.. to say the least. A store had a great sale and I made it. Got a few good deals like Kool aid 10 for a buck, soup 10 for a buck. I got several dollars worth of both. Plus frozen veggies same.. 10 bags for a buck. I was excited. well I have chores to do and calls to make.. So I will go for now. I dont want to I want to write more but I dont know what I want to write and I think if I dont end this now I will ramble.

      Each time I logged on yesterday to go my Blog I was bambarded with other things that needed my attention and I kept putting it off thinking to myself I would get it done. Last night as I laid in bed attempting to get to sleep I realized I didnt get to my blog. So I will make it up today. Yesterday was one of those days that seem to fly by. Nothing really happened. I did some laundry. Made dinner. Caught up on a few things here and even got in about 20 minutes of reading. Last night when I finally was able to try to go to bed all heck broke loose. First M. called which was fine. Then Dave came in asking me to set my alarm for 5 so he could get up early to go to work early. Then my sister called saying she will have a lay over at Seatac airport on Thursday morning it will be nice to visit with her. She is moving to Idaho getting away from the "family".. Then joey comes into my room in tears becasue he realized that he and Teira wont work out. His first sexual encounter, his first heart break. He told me he wants AC to come home becuase I told him we might be moving out of state. He wants to he wants a fresh start. He's very tired of being known as "Tony the troublemaker's kid brother" and Tony wants a fresh start where no one knows him as a troublemaker due to medication problems. With us needing to move I wish now more then anything that we could move away. I dont know when / if it will happen. I finally got to sleep woke up a few minutes before 5 to wake up Dave and when I got into the livingroom to wake him up he tells me "I didnt get to sleep until after 2:30 and I am not going to go in until 7:30 wake me up at 7" I was so pissed. Plus when I woke up and got into the livingroom I saw what a disaster it was. When I went to bed it wasnt "clean" but it was picked up and now there is all sorts of trash laying around. The dishes that were used while I was sleeping are scattered and popcorn was spilled.. so I get to clean all that up. I'm also going to be making some calls about a place to move to. I hate calling when I have no money to even put down.. but I have to find something. I kept thinking that AC is sleeping next to me. I can almost feel him and I sleep so much easier. Well should close and do the "stuff" here.

      I opened my e mail and there was a fast note from AC. My heart dropped I was so glad to see something from him. He is still there.. Problems arose and though he is safe he has to go back. He is getting out after this. he said he cant handle it anymore. he doesnt even want to teach. He told me he understood by my letters that things are getting to me and that he will understand if I go to someone else. NO WAY.. That never crossed my mind and I am hurt that he thought that through my e mails. I am faithful to him as he is faithful to me. I will NOT go to someone else. I will wait for him. I have this dream that he will come here and we will be able to start a life together and I am not going to get rid of that dream. I shiver at the thought of his email. I hope he gets my email about me waiting for him before he leaves I do not want him to go away thinking I will find someone else. AC has a gift that he has shown me that I can not discribe and I will never stop loving him no matter what. Even if for some reason we are not compatable I will love him but I know in my heart that we are compatable. Maybe the dreams of us being together the way I dreamed were more true then the dreams of the way I thought they would be. I can not wait for him to write me back. I am so glad I got something frm him. I can not discribe. he's safe ! ! ! ! *shiver*  I just have to wait. Seeing that e mail was comfort that I had needed. Just seeing it made me feel better. I can do anything I know my love is safe and I know that he will be with me as soon as he can. I am deeply sorry I had any doubt

      Wow, what a day. Things are going well so far. I slept like a log until I got to hot then I took the second fan in and plugged it in next to my bed. Slept until 7 when I set my alarm to wake up Ginger down two apartments. I cant wait for the two weeks for Dave to be out. He was sleeping in the livingroom again and that is where Tony sleeps so Tony was up all night long. I made some snide comment about TOny could go get into my bed and Dave got up. I dont know what to think. I know that a part of me should be glad that he is here because I am helping someone but at the same time I am tired of him taking advantage of me. Oh well one day I will learn my lesson. It's just so hard to say no to people without someone there with me. A lesson I guess I need to learn.   I got up this morning and attempted that number again thinking maybe someone would answer. I got the music again. This is so weird. I am finding this an excuse to push down not dealing with Ricky's death.. I'm finding that my new found need to search for another place is pushing down the fear for AC.. that came out wrong but if I have something to think about then I cant think of the million of things I think about for the reason he hasnt contacted me. Will he.. why hasnt he.. is he safe.. is he here.. what is going on.. I find it is easier to not deal with things at this point in time so I find new excuses to not deal with life.    Everyone is sleeping I want to go back to sleep I'm so tired but I know I cant. I will take a nap later today or something. Ken offered to come and visit but I said no. I dont want to deal with things right now. I know he wants to be my friend but I am not sure what else he wants and I refuse to put myself in that situation. He shocked me by talking to me online today and then calling. The yo yo effect is hard and I refuse to do it and now that I have made the choice to stop I feel healthier I'm glad that I was able to do that. The choice was made several months ago and I have felt better about it sense. Though I was hurt he forgot my birthday while insisting I remember his. Oh well that is the type of person he is and i know that I could not work with someone like that.    Ginger gave me the name to a new Doctor. She said she really likes this doctor alot and with all the health issues that she faces it is good for her. I told her what my doctor said about me just having to come to the realization that I will be heavy for my whole life.. I dont except that. I realize i will never be "skinny" but I am not healthy. When I tell my doctor I know osmething is wrong they refuse to listen.. I have to live for my children. So on Monday I will call and see if this new doctor will see me. I hope so becuase from what Ginger says she really listens. One of my biggest issues with my current doctor is the fact I end up on medication and then they take me off it. Medication I should not be off of. Plus they refuse to put me on medication I need. (sigh)    I also have a few numbers I need to call regarding a place. I am not sure how I will do this but it will happen. I keep dreaming that AC will come in and sweep me off my feet and together we will face this and make it easier. I just want and need someone by my side to lean on. I think that is one reason why I am always so tired. Emotional drainage. Well I am going to take a shower then maybe lay back down. Or start laundry who knows.. Depends on how I feel after the shower.    Thank Goodness for this blog I would go inside without it. Though I dont like public publishing I know it is safe anyway.

      I dont know what is going on. I've had Tony and Joey and Travis listen to a mini file that AC sent me and then listen to the phone. I've had weird calls the last couple of days where no one is there on the other line. I finally got tired of it and called the number back. There was a recorded song and I thought I had heard it before so I pulled up the mini file with the song. It was the same. Oh dear Goddess it was the same. Then I did a reverse directory number, no luck there the number is unlisted but it is in the same area code as AC home. Is it him trying to get ahold of me ? There is so much in my mind right now and I dont know what to think. I am going insane in a good way now. I have so many questions but I feel in my heart things are going to change. Goddess please let them change I gotta go.

      Never have I needed to be held as much as I do right now. All the stress and heartache I just do not need anymore yet it piles upon me. Is it to much to ask for some inner peace? What have I done wrong to warrent this emotional pain ? I want and need to feel weak for a time, a shoulder to lay my head and someone to dry my tears. I want and need someone to tell me it will get better. I can not go on. Daily I remind myself that without me my children would be in a worse place with no one to love them as I do and that keeps me here. Without them I would give up. Today more then any other day for a very long time.   The apartment has been sold to new owners and they need to get it up to code. Everyone is being asked to leave within a few months. I am asked to be out by July 31, they will give me a few extra days if needed and a glowing report. They are asking everyone to leave including Carolyn who is dying in #1 she will be the last asked to leave. Where will I go ? I have no idea. I've been here 5 years. THe longest I've lived in one place my whole life. It's perfectly located. I can survive on the rent barely and now I need to find another place where the rent will be more and I will have other things to pay for. I do not know how I will make it.    Tony is scared I will make him go live with his father. I can not get rental assistance due to his felony. I told him I would not send him back. I wont even though to find a place it will be hard because of his record. No one wants a sex offender around. I cant send my son away. It would kill him. It would kill me. Not only will the money be tighter, the place harder to find due to his offense but I do not know how I will come up with the money needed to move. I need about a thousand dollars. Hell at this point I need that just to catch up. I need if I want to be realistic 2000 to get caught up and move but no one I know how that kind of money to spare and I do not know how I would pay it back anyway even if I did know someone who could loan it to me. I cant afford to do this but I have no choice.    I know it's wrong but I want to curl up and die. Literally. I dont know how much more of this I can take. I need to be held. I need to feel safe but there is no one to turn to. I need help and no one around. I am waiting for Shaun to come give me a ride to pay the rest of the phone bill becuase I didnt get it done last night. To top it off Travis had his car break down today and doesnt have the money he owes me ether. I know more could go wrong but I want it to stop. I need it to stop. I need.. what does it matter what I need anymore, no matter what I need it wont happen.    Nothing from AC. Though my heart tells me to have faith my head I can hear the laughter at being a fool. I wonder what happened. I try to stop the thoughts of him playing a cruel joke. I try to stop the fear something happened. Now I know why I could not deal with this life before. I pray if he is for real, and if he is safe that he comes to me and explains. I pray that if he is real and is safe that he comes to me and tells me he is getting out. I pray that he comes to me and is safe and this is real. I dont think I could deal with this being a hoax ontop of everything else.

      what a day so far. Travis had to go register so we went to the courthouse got that taken care of, stopped and got another loan (I hate doing this but until I can get caught up I need to) stopped paid off a bill, bought a bunk bed set Joey has been looking at. Ok we dont need it, cant really afford it but I can understand why and yeah we could use it so I got it. I will be able to pay for it anyway so I am not to worried about it it will just be a bit more tight but if we sell the bed set in his room and put that towards the bunk beds we are getting then it will be that much easier. (smile) I found out for my program for the computer to enlarge it for me to read without my glasses it will cost me 149.00 of which I dont have. (sigh) I dont know what to do  but I'm not to worried about it. I might be able to deal for a bit longer. I could install if I got rid of my windows... (sigh)..  I didnt get the phone bill paid today but I am going to call them and ask them to let me pay it tomorrow. They should be able to let me but there is no way I can get there. I also got some groceries today. Not alot but enough to some get by until I get the rest of my money. The rent money is sent. Ok I made arrangements to pay the phone tomorrow thankfully they will let me wait the extra day. Whew and I had enough to pay the whole thing PLUS I have 24 dollars left over to go to the dollar store and do some more shopping for things we need (ie. soap, shampoo) YAY.. I'm happy. I'm going to be able to pay off alot of this stuff. I figured out how too. With the money travis pays me after each day's work I am going to put it away. I should be able to have almost all the bills paid / caught up by the end of the month and only be able 50 dollars behind. Once this is done I will be able to breath a bit easier. I dont know why I didnt think of this sooner. Maybe becaue Travis pays so little at a time that is why.    I had such wonderful dreams of AC last night. He was holding me tight in his arms and telling me that I just needed a little more faith and it would all be ok soon. I actually woke up several times feeling his arms around me. I was sleeping alone except for my teddy bear. Goddess I want him here. I am being selfish I know. I wonder if he is thinking of me. This journal has been such a relief to me to be able to write the little things down and know that he can read them at his lesure. I cant wait to see his dancing eyes. (shiver)    Well I should go and put the groceries away and then I will make something to eat. I just checked e mail and nothing from him yet but that is fine I have faith.

      The hardest thing for me to admit is defeat or need. So in light of my life as of late and the things I must do I have started a new routine. I am admitting things now though it is hard. My vision has only been getting worse and my headaches have gotten worse as well with my conteuned use of my glasses. I have made some inquiries into the Hardly school for the blind. It's one of those schools that will send you the material so you do not have to go to where they are. I can learn braille and so much more. This is a huge step for me. I need to stop wearing my glasses all the time but I am so use to .. no.. I want to keep what little vision I have that I am willing to hurt myself more to keep it selfishly for a few more years even though it is not right or good for me. So I plan to put my enlargment program back on the computer and start working with it more. I plan on going without my glasses more often. I can do this I just do not like the pity people tend to give me when I am out, people tend to try to help to much and that irritates me alot. Also so many people are so use to me doing things here that the adjustment will be hard on them. No more leaving things laying around. I think we can do it together as a family. My biggest problem is the fact that I hate it when people want to smother me in trying to help. I dont know what to do. I know I have to give up the glasses more and more but I do not want to give up what little independance I have. As sad as it sounds in a way it would have been better if I had lost all my vision though I am thankful for that not happening.    On a positive note I do have alot to thank AC about. One of my biggest problems was the fact I did not want to have to go alone in life being disabled (shudder I hate that word) and honestly could not view anyone caring for a "blind" woman. For some reason I know it will not make a big difference to him for so many reasons. He has given me the courage to go through with this and for that I am thankful. It's funny AC always tells me that I give him courage and that I have helped him so much in his life with my friendship when he doesnt even begin to see what he has done for me. I hope soon I can show him. He has restored my faith in so much even when I doubt I have faith it's amazing. My whole world has slowly turned for the better thanks to his friendship and I know it will only get better with his love next to me. I hope that each day he learns a bit more of how important he is to me. I hope he never realizes how much he has done for me becuase that would mean things have came to a stand still and I never want that to happen. He means the world to me.     Last night I almost died laughing. Never send men to do shopping. Dave and Matt brought food into the house. Frozen pizza's, two HUGE bags of chips, they did get bread and milk and cheese (YAY)and they got two HUGE packs of hamburger meat and on top of that they got me a chocolate cream pie. Dave made sure NO ONE touched it because it was for ME only because I have helped out so much he wanted to get me a treat and knows I like chocolate. how do I tell him I dont care for pie ? Lol I am touched but really wished he had put that money towards other things. (smile) I could think of so much more it could have gone towards. ok granted it is only 6 dollars but I do not want feel comfortable with someone doing something like that to "spoil" me for just being myself. He told me to get over it and that I needed to learn to be spoiled sometimes. I know he's right but I still find it weird.    Well I'm off to finish the dishes, to install that program (procrastinating on that one can you tell?) and do a bit around the house. I can take my glasses off to do the house work. This is going to be hard. I think I am going to ask Travis when he is here to keep my glasses so I can learn to go without them otherwise it is to much of a tempation to put them on. WOW did I blog today :)

      Good Morning, I woke up came out and again realized that the children are my biggest mess makers. The livingroom was semi picked up last night this morning is trashed. Of course I forget that it's Tony's 5 - 8 day which means I could have slept for another 30 minutes. This of course is "my fault"... My computer desk is trashed from everyone, the livingroom is trashed and I didnt finish dishes last night. I wish I had a three bedroom so that Tony had his own room so that he could have a place to put his things such as back pack and stuff so that the livingroom would be a bit cleaner. In about an hour I can turn on some music and get some house work done. Heaven I hope I have the energy Lol.    I have had it with down the road. Marina called the police on Travis last night. A disision I support but then refused to tell the police he was the father of Alexis' baby so the police wont do anything about him and Alexis "hanging" out together even though he is a RSO. Come to find out that they were at the hosptial the whole time with Dawn and her dad. Then Marina changes her mind about the restraining order says she doesnt need it now because Kelley is refusing to buy the 2000 + worth of stuff she put on lay away for the baby and she needs Travis to pay for it. I am going to save the money Travis gives me and get the loans paid off and that way I will be "caught up" as best I can be on things and I can get him out of here in July. If I had the money now I would get him out now. I would really like to move though because it's going to get ugly.    On top of that I found out Joey has been having sex. The bad part(s). The mother wants the girl pregnant.. Joey didnt use a condom. When I confronted him about it he skated away from the topic so I waited for him to tell me which he did last night. I gave him some condoms with the understanding when he needs more he needs to come to me and tell me. I dont approve of this at all exspecially knowing the mother's agenda but I also know that if I say no he will only rebell and do it and I wont know when he needs protection. Another reason I wish I could move. Lol.    AC hasnt called, wrote or came by. I pray daily for him and feel him close to me. It is almost like he is reaching out to me asking me to hold on a little longer. I wish things had not come down so hard at this point in time. All the stress coupled with the e mail I sent him about not being able to have children anymore... I under stand I must have some faith with this and I am trying. My biggest lesson to learn in this lifetime is faith (in myself and others) and patience. I tend to not have much trouble with faith in others, sometimes foolishly placing it but still placing it. After my housework is done (yeah ok right) I will go and do some mediation and see if I can ease my mind. I can not believe I have fallen for AC like this... Even now with all my doubts I find myself smiling.  *Later* I had a weird thing happen today while at the bank. A lady asked me if my name was Alexandra (yes my middle name) she told me that I reminded her of her cousins wife who wasn't suppost to be here until the middle of the month. Her cousins name starts with an A. (same name as AC)Then I am talking to M. (she left me an e mail asking me to call her) and she got a customer today from Langley VA (or her daughter in law is from there one of the two).. Her daughter in law is coming up on the 17th of this month and something about a china set different yet the same.. What messages are we being sent ? I'm not shocked M. is getting these things we are so connected. It's June. AC has not shown. Will he be here near the middle ?? I pray he will be.  M tells me to contenue to be stong. I am trying. It's almost 8:30 at night and I'm exhusted. Kids wore me out today plus the depression and fear have taken it's toll on me as well. Marina down the road is still playing her mind games and I am sick of it but I am finding myself not caring about things anymore. I just am tired of seeing people used. Marina is all about using people. I want to move. I need to move before her 13 year old daughter gets pregnant (like she wants) by my son. I can not believe a mother would push her daughter to get pregnant just so she can get another child in the house. Plus she is talking (again) about leavin her husband and having Travis support her and the girls and the baby. I do not see how this is going to happen but who knows. I hope tht I can hold it off until the end of this month so that I can get caught up on the bills. Travis might be able to pull me out of the whole this month if I manage things right. I just have to be strong. I pray I can. If I could get 1000 extra I could pull myself out of debt and ask him to leave.. Even still I do not feel safe asking him to leave (which is why I wish I could move) but I know I will sooner or later. Matt is leaving for Yakima tomorrow for a few weeks. By the time he gets back Dave should be in his own place. I should be getting my own place back by July. Tony will be going to visit his father in July. Gods it would be nice if AC got here before then. I want to feel his arms around me and I long to hold him. I should go. I'm getting goofy.

      What a day and it's not even begun. I got to bed last night about 11 after Tony finally woke up. YAY my bed. I got into bed fell asleep woke up and went back to bed. Then dragged myself out of bed this morning. Not sure what was up but I should could NOT wake up. Got Joey and Travis out the door then Rachael left YAY. She will be back today to get her stuff.. Oh thank you Goddess. Tony is waiting for someone to log on so I am unable to go onto MSN no big deal. I just want to go to bed but the satilite guy will be here sometime this morning. I had to fight with them anyway and plus I'm watching a neighbor's kid for her. Not looking forward to this I have a real problem with this child. He is rude and thinks nothing of interupting and being annoying. Plus on top of that he is just.. ugh.. how do I discribe it ?? raised wrong ? yeah that is the gentle way of saying it. Other then that I have to make a call today to resechdule my appointment. It was suppost to be today but no way I can make it. Not enough hours and no real transportation. I mean I could make it but if I did then I would have to be able to drive. I'm going to go watch spiderman for a bit and make something to eat so I can take my pills. I just want to go back to bed. Maybe I will go to bed early I do have a full day tomorrow.

      I don’t know what the hell is going on. Bridges got burned today. MAJOR ones. Travis is no longer welcomed here. I’m holding his stuff here as collateral for the damage done to the other place and the lack of doing what needed to be done. I’m sick of his excuses. Today was the last day and he is no longer welcomed here at my house. Dave is no longer welcomed at my  house ether. He put a hole in the wall and promised to patch it up and failed to do so. Why ? Pussy was more important. I’m sick of it. I’m tired of being used and I’m letting everyone know it. I will not allow it anymore. They can all kiss my ass. Period. I will not see my deposit, because Travis, who in exchange for staying at the old place for 2 weeks refused to clean like he said he would. Instead it is even a worse mess then when I left it. Plus the hole in the wall. Plus all the other crap. I just fucking quit I hate it. I’m sick of it and if I had my way he would fucking be out of here, this state or in jail for GOOD. I’m so tired of hearing the same male fucking excuse. “I got distracted”. Distracted by people, pussy, or whatever else. They do what they want on their time and then come to me to clean up their fucking messes and take care of their fucking shit. BULL SHIT. I don’t know what to think right now I just want to go take a shower and then I have to clean MY house of rachael’s stuff that she brought over last night when she suddenly appeared at my door to “stay” due to her fight with her daughter in law. Gods I hate this crap. Sorry I am cursing more then I normally do. I should go. Shower, clean and then rest. So much for limited activity and bed rest huh? Oh yeah I guess this classifies as “avoiding stress”.. NOT

      I"ve been sick the last few days. Nothing seriously wrong just blah, I think it was the heat and the exhustion of things catching up to me. Today I will go and find out if the kids did what they were told to do last night if not well Travis will find my boot up his ass so to speak. Last night all hell broke loose but it is nothing compared to the shit that will happen today. Last night I got real sick, went into my room and could barely wake up let alone deal with anything. So when Travis' friend Hailey didnt have a place to stay I said they could stay at the old place tonight ONLY and it better be finished by the morning (hey I was going to clean it but was sick) then come to find out Rachael and her daughter in law had a HUGE blow up and she is sleeping on my couch. I was furious. She just moved all her crap into my house NO NOTICE. So today she and I are going to sit and have ourselves a TALK. I talked to her daughter in law last night and I was NOT thrilled at what I heard. Now I dont know her daughter in law that well but I do know when someone is telling me the truth. Rachael has been lying. So I will tell her flat out. A. she cant move in she can stay a couple of days but that is all due to CPS. B. I dont want her using my name for her shit anymore or I might simply say 'Get Out'. Depending on what happens with Travis and her additude today. I say depending on travis because IF he did what he was suppost to last night then he has a grace period of staying. If not his shit is out on the porch and there will be no coming back. Hey it's a good excuse to get him the fuck out. Lol. Maybe. Ether way I will NOT deal with Rachael for very long. I just dont need her bullshit stress. Nothing from A.C. and I'm starting to get upset. Gods Iw ish it would rain here and cear up this oppression in the weather. I'm seriously thinking of asking K to take me for a drive today so I can clear my head but knowing him he will be busy Lol. Well I'm outta here to make a call and then to go to the old place and deal..

       I believe that each person has many soul mates in one life time. Depending on the path that each choose is depending on if they are lucky enough for find someone to share their lives with. Have you ever met someone who just seemed to fit perfectly with you ? Someone that you seemed to share something with that is unexplainable ? Have you ever had that person be unobtainable for whatever reason ? Same sex and your straight, they are married, you are married or you just realize that no matter how perfect you two are it would not work now ? I'm blessed with knowing some of my "souls" out there. One is married, we can talk about anything, comfortable silence, we know each others moves if walking we know when the other will turn type thing, his children are like my own, my children like him, we enjoy the same things, there is sexual attraction and there is a sense of contemptment as well. Just being near each other we can "recharge" our low battery. His honor is what keeps us apart. He would not leave his wife. At least not yet. We have spoken of a life together, we have even had the same dreams of a life together. Maybe one day it will happen. But for now he is with her and I am with someone else to a degree. I had made a promise to myself many years ago that I woudl never be with a married man. I know the pain and heart ach. So why then when he is around me do I feel like it is not wrong to be in his arms ? I do not feel it is cheating on the man I am with, I do not feel it is cheating on his wife. No we have not had sex yet and I'm not sure if we ever will. I know that there is something between us, I know that we fight it, I know that everyone sees it. Even people at his work will mistake me for his wife just by the way he "watches" me. People mistake his daughter as mine. Saying we make such a beautiful family.    Where does my future lay ? I dont know. I seriously do not think it is with him. If it is it wont be any time soon. Is it with the man who haunts my dreams ? In a huge way I hope it is. I do not want to think that I was in any way a cause of a break up in a marriage, besides the one who haunts my dreams holds my heart in a strange way. I believe it is important to talk about these things, these feelings. Not to hurt anyone but to be honest and open. I would never hurt the one who holds my heart, I would never cheat on him and I have turned down others who have asked me to have an affair.    Well I'm waiting for the satilite guy to come and hook up the stuff. Hope fully he will be here soon. He arrived and it's set up YAY cable again I missed t.v.  I need to clean my kitchen and do a few things around the house. Then wake up Tony and ask him to carry over the chair and bunk bed rails out of the old house. Today my mood is beyond good. I've not felt this good in many days. Oh yeah I'm taking the medication like a good girl (ugh) I hate pills and I take 4 a day now.. But on the plus side (not meaning my weight ether Lol) I am eating more and that is helping me lose weight   I just got a phone call.. Don is dead. My friend who had cancer. I'm rather in shock over this. I cant help but think of how he asked me to be with him but I was so involved with my other life. I didnt love him not the way he wanted me to. I did love him but as a friend. I think it is time for me to do some work. This makes three deaths within a month.

      I recieved a cashiers check from a "friend" of A.C.'s today. I went to cash it only to find out it was a fake. I almost went to jail. I've emailed A.C and though I realize it will be awhile before I am able to hear back from him. I do not know what to do. I'm sick. I thought of how the money was going to help me get things done, the money that was left I was going to save and give back to him. I'm scared. I am facing charges now because I trusted him. I'm confused and scared. On one hand I wonder is he lying to me ? Was it all a set up ? Or was he used too ? I wnt to believe he was used but with him not coming around, making excuses and then not coming back when he said he was going to it makes me wonder if maybe I was a victim of a sick game. I dont know what to think all I know is that I cant stop crying. I cant stop shaking and I cant seem to think right anymore.    I sent the kids over to the old place to get it finished being cleaned. Gods I hope they do it. I need to have that out of my hair. I cant deal with the stress anymore. My chest is hurting and I feel like I"m going to explode on the inside. I know it's my heart problems with all the stress but nothing I can do about it. I'm scared. Not only for the possible charges but my own health as well. I have to keep sane and I have to keep healthy for the kids. I'm losing it. I cant stop crying.    I am making an appointment for mental health. Ok M. I'm following your lead, your right I need to get some help until A.C. is back. So much is going on and so much needs to be worked on and I cant do it alone I realize that. I wish I had the courage to do more

      I woke up this morning with no trouble. Tony woke up and got Travis who was sleeping at the old place and he went off to work. Joey woke up with no trouble to go to school. Tony went back to bed in Joey’s room and things were fine until the satilite guy arrived. What a total dick. He didn’t want to set up the satlite dish so he left. This was after I made a suggestion of which he didn’t like. Jerk off. He didn’t want to climb up on the roof nor put the cord around the building. Nevermind he could have went to the back of the building and done it there which was my suggestion but he didn’t want to hear that. I guess cuz I’m a woman. Jerk so I called another place and they said that they would get me my stuff set up on Friday. Thank goodness.    Then Seth Tony’s Parole officer called. He basically said he didn’t feel comfortable with Tony going back there sense James was refusing to allow me to have the phone number and address plus there was a change in the date which was not authorized. He said that Tony needed to call his dad and find out some information and call him back. Well Tony was gone when James called here. James did nothing but scream at me telling me that it was all my fault. The reason he left was because I sent child support after him. Excuse me no I’m on welfare they went after him on their own. That I sent insurance after him when no again that was welfare. I had no idea of what was going on until he said something to me. So I am calling Child support and telling them what is going on. That is the whole reason why he wont send money (of which he lost his business and of course that was my fault as well) and the whole reason why he had to move (they were hounding him about money ) which that is my fault too. He also said that I needed to call them off. HELLO again my hands are tied. I ended up hanging up on the prick. If it was up to me and I still might do it. I will be going to Robin and asking if I can use her address as a “in care of” and writing a notorized letter to James telling him that we have moved from our old place and that his number is blocked and that if he wants to contact Tony it has to be ether through MY e mail address OR the in care of address. I am so sick of the bullshit. Each time Tony gets done talking to him he is upset and not in a good mood. Joey and I have to deal with that. Then on top of that I deal with James who is accusing me by screaming and not listening. I wont do it. I also know that Seth is behind me on this thankfully.    I am dealing with AOL which is a pain in the butt. I am actually writing this in word and having to transfer it over because AOL is dropping me every two to five minutes. I am sick of it. I have been on the phone with them now for about 45 minutes switching and being dropped. I’m not in a good mood

      Today I got rid of 11 bags of old clothes, blankets and stuffed animals. I still have another bag of stuffed animals and a couple of blankets. 11 bags ! ! Hello people that is a bit much. (rolls eyes) I'm going to send Travis and Joey over to the other place to break down the bunk beds and finish up Joey's room. Considering each time I tried to send them over to do something there they always got side tracked. I'm sick of doing it alone. I pack, load some and unpack while everyone is busy playig video games, talking to neighbors or kicking back relaxing. Travis and Tony got to "distroy" the dishes from the old place. It was a good release for them. Otherwise things are ok. Today the rest of it should be done at least in Joey's room and the kitchen and livingroom. My room there is very little left to do. I will have that done tomorrow.    I saw my sisters new place. Pictures of it at least in Blackfoot Idaho. She said that she is thinking of buying a couple of rentals and if she does then she said that me and the boys can move out there. She asked how long it would take me to be ready to move. Umm tomorrow LOL.. I think it would be good to get out of here. I"m losing faith in so much in life but I am trying to hold on. Idaho would be a nice fresh start if A.C. doesnt come home to me. I dont know anymore. I just want to curl up and not think about it. But I know I have to. I want to have faith, I try to have faith but sometimes I get overwhelmed and realize I cant put my trust in faith and good intentions. What is the old saying ?? lol.. Anyway I have to go and kick kids in the butt to do things.

      God I"ve missed writing. Ok got 99% of the stuff moved over. Today I will finish cleaning and putting away my room here at the new place and then I will go over to the old place and see what a disaster it is there. There is still stuff to do but just no real energy to do it. Each time I ask for help no one around can seem tod o it and it's ticking me the heck off. I dont want to do it alone I"m tired and wore out emotionally and mentally. My health is not the best and the kids just seem to want to do things their way. My cubboards are FULL. I cant get over it. I didnt remember what it felt like to have food in the house. I even splurged and bought things I normally cant afford. Ok yeah I cant afford it but the kids need a treat because they have gone without for so long. I look around the house and think there is still so much to get done I dont even want to see the other place. Tony slept here last night which I'm glad. I dont like him spending time with Travis. I've been so busy getting things done here around the new place, things set up and in order. I did all the laundry yesterday and now I have to put my stuff away. I cant get over the junk I have gotten rid of so far. There is still so much to do though. I'm going to ask Dave if he will take the stuff in his truck and dump it somewhere for me. I also have to patch a hole in the wall that he made at the old place. Oh well. Time will see what happens with that. Well today is the 4th of July. Nothing serious going on here. Joey may be going over to RObin's for the night (I hope) which means I might get a break from all the stuff with him. He's had company the last three nights and I need a child free day. Tony might be here but not sure. I"m going to see about getting the t.v. over here and watching some movies. YAY.. Travis will throw a fit about that but I dont care anymore. He wanted me to leave the computer and t.v. over at the old place so he had something to do. Screw him. The prick also said he was almost out of gas (half a tank) and was not able to take me to do the laundry without me giving him money becuase he had to go to work on Tuesday. Yeah 1 day up there he gets his check and cashes it on his way home. He cant do it on a half a tank of gas ?? no cuz he does so much driving all over the place. He wont walk up the road to visit people he has to drive and he is very hard on his driving gunning his engine and stuff hot rodding around. But you cant tell him anything he is after all Travis and knows everything. I wish I had the courage to just tell him to get the fuck out of my life and NOT come back but I know when I do that all hell will break loose and he will cause problems for me he's already told me that. The only thing I have going for me right now is that I can say that due to on site management that he can not stay here that I have already talked to them. Even still I worry about the fight that he will give me then. He is going to see about putting Marina in jail for lying on court documents. *rolls eyes* it's gotten so ugly that whole situation and though I wish this on no one I think the best thing would be for ether Alexis to give the baby up (which she wont do) or lose it. Tony is snoring softly on the couch it sounds so sweet. Dave stopped by to see if he could use my phone. He needed to call his son in Yakima. I have unlimited long distance so I dont mind. At least he asked and didnt just walk in and do it like he use to. He even knocked ! YAY. Joey is still sleeping though I think Mike (his company) is up. It's 11 in the morning and I should get dressed and finish what I need to do so I can get to the other place. I also need to drop off the potato salad for Nadine. She is doing a bbq and invited me and the kids over but I think I wont go. I dont feel like dealing with the people that will be there. I think I will get a couple of hours over at the other place and then call it quiets and come back here. I still look daily for a letter from A.C. but nothing so far and my heart breaks each day but I am patient I think he is worth the wait and I will wait for ever for him. I did so much soul searching the last few days and I have realized so much in my life. Time will tell what happens. I've found a sense of inner peace that I can not explain. I miss M so much. We dont get to talk like we use to becuase my schedule is so up in the air and last night I called to tell her something and she was with her honey. It was great to hear her voice though I felt bad about interupting her Lol.. I hope she got lucky ! ! ! ! ! If she did she needs to write me all about it :) I love the fact that she and I can share things like that with each other. It's nice to realize that being a slut isnt a bad thing. No slut is the wrong word but I'm sure when she reads this she will understand what I mean. I write in this blog for her and for A.C.  Oh yeah.. I got one of my stories published ! I'm so excited. It's one of my erotic stories but I feel empowered by it. Ok so I know I will never be a "great" writer but I can say it's offical. :) Well back to work.
