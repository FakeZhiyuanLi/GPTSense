      So today I'm looking back through all my photos I find lots of you and that makes me hurt inside I look at those dear pictures we were so happy together i think back to all those times we spent laughing and hugging,  kissing and (me) crying, all those long car rides and rainy nights on the couch  As I sat there surrounded by memories, I stopped crying for a moment and smiled, I smiled not only because I knew you would always be there for me, but because I had the chance to know and be a part of something so special, Us................  Another day has come and gone, but I know there will be others, if it's meant to be, it will be and if it's not, you'll always be a part of me, you are so near and dear to my heart, I can't go one day without thinking about you, sometimes i laugh about all the times we've had,  and sometimes I cry knowing I've lost them, but most of all I just smile, knowing I was yours for a&nbsp;moment in time, and will be another day.....  Mel,  Why can't I do this alone? When will I be able to forget? I have to stop this but it's so hard, I miss him with all my heart!  Ran

      &nbsp;So today we get a call (while my fam is sleeping) that&nbsp;my g-grandpa has taken a turn for the worst and that they think he will die soon, so i get up and get dressed (7:30 this morning!) and we go up there and meet my grandparents and the rest of the family and we sat in the nursing home from 8 this morning until about 12:30, went out and got something to eat and came back and stayed there until 2:30 this afternoon, he got a lot better while we were there and obviously they really don't know what's going on! sigh, so they got me all upset and freakin out cuz I thought my grandpa was gonna die and really he just wasn't doing too good.....so now i'm home, sittin around watchin tv ( i was supposed to go to work but i called work earlier and told them my grandpa wasn't doing good and that they needed to find someone to cover my scheduled hours) so now I have nothing to do and my blood pressures all out of whack...what a nice sunday afternoon!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then i check my email to find out that the jackass chorus president doesn't know what the hell is going on, so he passes everything down to other officers and expects them to know what's going on and then expects me to do all his shit for him, so first of all i'm pissed because he's a dumbass and i should've gotten president instead of him, but second of all he refuses to call me or answer my calls and listen to me about stuff that i know he doesn't know...so we have to make an interactive thing for state fair, the paper was due July 20, o guess what maybe i should just fuckin do it myself, o but wait it's not my problem and i have enough shit to do without doing his work too...so then safety day is coming up and i don't have time to call people because this whole week we have hort practice, and next week i'm at camp until the 6th, then hort. cde and district workday at fair and like 10 days after that fuckin school starts, i start with college courses, my grandma has her surgery, i have to start volunteering at the vet, plus have time to work about 20 hrs a week so i can pay my insurance, fill out scholarships, decide what i want to do with my life and worry about my grandpa and my melissa.............GEEZ LOUISE! and people say that 17 year olds should have more responsibilities! fuckin a! if i had more responsibilities i'd be in a fuckin looney bin, it's a good thing i'm not attached to shea anymore because i don't fucking have time for a boy, let alone a nice boy.......holy monkeys!&nbsp;&nbsp; i'm done, spent and shall skidattle, but before i do i'd just like to say" mersy don'ts and dosey dont's and little lambsey ivy, kittle de divey do wouldn't you?" sigh my g-grandpa used to sing that all the time when i was little, and then i remember the times when we would go&nbsp;to the park and play frisbee or go to the library and play oregon trail on the computer for hours....man i'm gonna miss him.......... ;( sigh.....

      Well I guess I can't really call it "the shitty day" because my grandpa talked to the nurses&nbsp;a little today and that's massive progress.....so i go to work at 5 and right after i get there of course we start getting really busy (i was the only person working our curbside take-out) and this guy comes in and god-forbid it takes me 23 mins instead of the 20 mins i told him it was gonna be for his food, so he complains and tells the manager it took me 50 MINS to get his food out to him! BULLSHIT! plus he didn't tip and it was like a $60 order and he stood over me the whole time telling me that his steak better be cooked med. rare and i better check it before i box it up&nbsp; (he told me that at LEAST 5 x's!) so ya i'm sure the managers are pissed at me and i'm probably gonna get in trouble just because this guy was a dickhead...yay a lovely day in the neighborhood...n e wayz, nothing else really went on, tomorrow i'm visiting my grandpa, then babysitting my cousins until 3:30 when i have to head out to go to work, sunday i have to work 9 hrs...i'm a little worried about safety day since no one will call me back but ya know, i guess i'll keep trying...n e wayz i'm tired so later...Randi

      so yesterday i went to state fair....soooo much fun... i am so glad that i went! *sighs* (possibly in love) so now i don't know what to do and could really use some advice to anyone willing to share it...so this boy (formerly known as Isaac) is great and i mean great...he's kind and sweet...definitely a lot like me..lives on a farm (cool?!) knows all this stuff that i don't know (definitely got a better score on the SAT's than me * sigh*...) makes fun of me, holds my hand like we've been dating for months (defnitely only barely known him not even two weeks) definitely calls every other night like clockwork, 9:01...definitely has the most adorable cheeks i've ever seen (both sets..lol) definitely tried to buy my milkshake on saturday and i refused..(bad randi..bad) sigh...so i could go on and on for a long time but anyways down to the advice needed thing...so he lives at least 3 hours from my house--do i get involved in a solid relationship with this 'boy' or do i just keep it casual since we live so far apart? i honestly don't know what to do, i like him A LOT but he lives so far away, like the next time i'll see him is i don't know when..and i'm really busy with everything i do, and he's really busy with football and stuff, and i'm starting college classes and all that...ahh...i want to date him i think but how do you initiate that into a conversation...ya so i was just wondering if you wanted to date me or if you wanted to stay casual...o ya we've only known each other for 2 weeks...ha.. NO!! sigh so confused...let me know what you think....i've definitely already kissed him..more than once...if that makes a difference in your decision....NEED HELP!

      so this past week i go to this awesome Future Ag. Ed. Teacher Academy and get to hang out with 10 other great people from all over Indiana. Well this one boy strikes my fancy, and omg...he is soo nice and sooo much fun to hang out with...so wed. night we took a walk and walked around for like an hour almost just talkin, then thursday a group of us went on a night hike and he held my hand the whole time, then after that we hung out by the rec. place and looked at the stars and (insert some other small details)...all in all it was the most fun time i've ever had at a camp! so i'm thinkin o geez, i definitely kissed this boy and now he's never gonna call or wanna talk to me ever again...so i email him on friday night when i got home and checked it like 40,000 times during the day seeing if he responded....by sat. night i was starting to get discouraged when my cell rings and i pick up and it's him....he had just gotten a cell phone and called me, with no long distance plan (EXPENSIVE!) and he was definitely at his grandpa's house at some hog roast with like a bunch of his cousins and friends and he called ME! it was great...so we talked for a while and then i had to let him go, but i called him back and we talked for a little while longer and he's like well...i'll call you on Monday, is that ok? Hell yes it's ok! lol...so n e wayz, that's my meeting a boy story and maybe he'll come up to visit me sometime...too bad he lives in southern indiana right!!? sigh, boys.....  ;0)

      so i go to the lake this morning and afternoon w/ jen, lots of fun let me tell you what (no sarcasm in that sentence) and leave a little after 3 to come home so i have time to get ready for work, get home a little after 4, get ready and head in to the Uno's...lol...n e wayz, so i get in there and i'm quarterbacking since i closed this evening, and were busy as hell...we go on a wait about 5:15 ( i got there at 5) and continued to be on a 15-20 min wait (with only 3 hostesses mind you; and one absorbed in take-out) until about 8:30!! It was the most psychotic thing i have ever seen on a sunday night, it was absolutely nuts!  now to my problem: so theres this guy at work who's kinda cute, single, funny (omg forget funny, hilarious) has a great personality....blah blah blah, i could go on forever...so your probably thinking as him out, what's the problem with that situation?...well children he's a bit older than me.(ok more than a bit i think) and i don't think my parents would appreciate that/approve....sigh...so now what, any ideas? anyone? huh, huh, huh?? NEED ADVICE...MEL?
