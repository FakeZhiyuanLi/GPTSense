      Getting nervous about exams. Wanting to be done with my thesis now so I can really get started. I'm just realizing that 6 weeks isn't a lot of time, and in reality it will be less by the time I finish up here.  I was at a ball on Saturday night. There was a catering service, a live band, and lots of wine. They played mostly standard music, so I got to practice ballroom dancing. Some people seemed to really have problems that I didn't have shoes on. Mine were really too slippery though, and I never once complained about my toes being stepped on :).  Midday the next day they had a grill. It's yearly tradition. I was dead though. I think we danced til 7 or 8 in the morning, then slept for 3 hours, then started cleaning up for the guests.  There are so many little differences between living in Germany and America that I find so cute. Like house shoes. House shoes are one of those things that COULD be practical, i.e. in a house with wooden floors that are often cold. But quite often they are just habit.   And nobody that I have met likes peanut butter. Unglaublich, oder?  Oh, if anyone reads this and has a brilliant idea for a writing sample for Fermilabs, that would be wonderful. I want to apply for a little 3 month technical writing internship :).

      Just took a Finding Nemo quiz to find out what character I am :).   urlLink     What Finding Nemo Character are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Cute, eh?  Well, yeah. Tonight is the big ball. I don't have a dress for a ball. I used to have one, but then I ironed it on too high of a setting and the material fell apart. Na ja. Anyway, I've improvised on something else I have. It can best be described as "white". Never have I worn so much pastel. We'll see how it goes over. OH! And I finished writing my thesis. Well, at least I've filled in all the sections and can spend the next week fixing the pictures and editing. Anyway, have to make myself pretty. Take care!

      Tom cooked Mexican food for me today. This made me nervous because my experience with Mexican food, German style has been tortillas, filled with ONLY salsa and covered with, guess what, salsa. Ugh. Unbelievable. But he really did the impossible: he found REFRIED BEANS. I guess all I had to do was ask a German who loves to cook. I'd checked in every major supermarket I'd come across (even in the Netherlands) and been unsuccessful. In fact, I still haven't met a German who knows what they are. So when he set them out on the table (with all the other yummy burrito stuffings), I was in heaven.  This obsession is thanks to my mother who used to always make "bean crap" (affectionately named by my best friend in high school who also loved the stuff). This was simply refried beans with cheese and tomatoes thrown in the microwave then served with tortilla chips, but man I've missed it this last year...  Well, it's 10:30, but it doesn't feel late because it's still light out. The rain has temporarily stopped, but the wind has been horrendous. I almost died half a dozen times biking home today thanks to fallen branches. Well, if I've resorted to talking about the weather, I guess I should take that as a symbol that it's time to sigh off :).

      I just spent the last hour chiseling away glass. It was fun, really. I haven't been able to work on my thesis for the last 4 hours anyway because the server was down, so I didn't have anything better to do I guess. And of course in the process I broke the plate in the oven. Well, yeah, nothing new. :)

      Ugh. Woke up feeling poor again. Fighting off the start of a cold. But I went to Köln this afternoon anyway. And why? Because I need a dress for a ball this weekend. Came back empty-handed though. Can't bring myself to spend so much money for one evening.  Also had a meeting today at ILT (institute for laser technology) to do absorbtance measurements. Nothing thrilling there, but something new, and one of the final pieces to my thesis, which is slowly coming to a close.  Ah, and on the ride back from Köln, I stumbled on the train (fighting off the fact that the room was spinning from my lovely headache) and was startled to hear my name behind me ("Amy" is definitely not common here). It was, only naturally, my dance partner (affectionately called TanzFrank) and one of his friends on their train ride back from Berlin. Really, it seems like such coincidences happen every day.  And I received SIX invites to give out for gmail. And I have lots of new music to listen 2 - 8 new jive music CDs. All in all, I'd be wonderfully happy if I could just forget the pounding head :).

      Tee, hee... just tried to check my gmail account and got the following error message:  Sorry, something didn't work correctly.   If we knew exactly what the problem was, we would tell you instead of giving you this useless error message. Actually, if we knew, we would most likely have fixed it already.   Rest assured. As you read this, alarm bells are ringing at the Googleplex, signifying something has gone horribly wrong in this quadrant. A report will soon be in the hands of our engineering team, detailing the bad thing that happened here. This team will work without rest to address the problem you have brought to their attention.   If, after a decent interval (about 24 hours), you encounter this problem again, please email us at accounts-support@google.com . The more specifics you include, the better (e.g., what kind of computer and browser you were using, what page you looked at last, what you clicked on, etc.). Sometimes, even our engineers need a little help.   Thanks for using Google.     Are they good, or what? I mean, I can't check my email, and I'm not the slightest bit upset about it because I'm too busy laughing :).  Na ja... nothing new here - just combating a cold, and dealing with wretched dreams, ie. my sister falling off a cliff and dying, me forgeting how to speak normal english and trying to find a job... :(

      Ugh. It ALWAYS rains in Aachen. They say it's either raining or about to rain or just rained here, and it's really true. After a year, I can say I've had about enough.  Well, yeah. Worked from 8am-10pm yesterday then showed up at my boyfriend's exhausted (having worked til 3am the day before). He has taken to calling me "Arbeitstier", and I guess I can't blame him.  And I made the perfect part yesterday. I was ready to remake a ton of them then ship them off to the company to convince them that they want a project with us. Success! Right, then I tried it again. I swear it was all the same parameters, but this time it came out full of cracks - one even broke. What good is it if the process isn't repeatable? I don't understand. And I only have til Tuesday before I have to give up the machine. It's frustrating not being able to watch the process. Everytime I click start and wait 2 hours just HOPING I'll succeed.  I'm eating chocolate and grapes for breakfast. I really love my life.  Oh, and I've just spent 100 dollars to go to the Society of Women Engineers conference in October (which needless to say was REALLY painful) AND found a campground less than an hour away to stay at while I'm there. I'm so looking forward to it. A tour of GE medical, then 4 whole days of yummy seminars. I just wish Shell would be there - that confuses me. Oh, I'm looking forward to entering the working world.  Right, well, back to work.

      Right... I just realized that I am NEVER going to update my webpage (last update was middle march, can be read  urlLink here ). It's too much of a hassle. And so I've give up the world of creating webpages with wordpad and resorted to the cheap and easy way. Na ja...  So, an update of the last months for those who were following my weblog:   April  The biggest change for me in April was a change in work. I decided to do my thesis here, kind of on the spot, and when I met with the professor here he jumped on the idea. Why the decision? Well, I needed more of a challenge. Showing up at work every day and doing whatever mundane tasks your sup' has set out for you is ok for a while, but there's no comparison to having a project where nobody but you can be held responsible for the outcome. Besides, I wanted to get more out of my stay in Germany - there's much more responsibility placed on thesis workers.  Another development was a stay with the professor for a weekend. It's a rare and beautiful gift to even meet a professor during studies in Germany, and I not only met him, but his wife, children, mother, brother - the whole package. I have so much respect for their family - he lives in Aachen, she lives in Hamburg - and it's always been that way for them, with him only there for the weekends. And the invite showed me that the global manufacturing program is important to him. If I'm ever rich or control some level of corporate funding, I'll support students in this program. I find it sad to think of all the potential lost due to lack of funds. The collaboration is a great idea - esp. because it's so research/industry intense - I can't see why industries don't jump on it as a way to recruit qualified students. Yeah, anyway... The left pic is of me with Professor Klocke (on the right) and his brother. The right one is of his mother showing me the neighbor's cows :).        We did a nice little tour of Hamburg for a day, went to an Easter fire and visited the farm he grew up on (pics shown in that order).              May  My mommy came to visit! It came as such as nice surprise! We went of course to the Kölner Dom, toured Aachen, and, a first for me, we went to Liege, Belgium. I had read bad things in my tourguide, but we found the most wonderful little pathway by the townhall. Hmm.. Right, if you are ever there, find the 300 huge concrete steps and, standing at the bottom of them, look to your left. There is a little path there. Follow it, and you'll just have to fall in love with Liege. Oh, we also did a Rhine river cruise, which I'd done before, but this time we toured Castle Rhinefels, which was really really cool. There are so many nooks and crannies I think I could get lost for days. The funny thing is a friend of mine practically did - the castle actually closed down and they were locked in and had to find a way to climb out. But if you ever go, don't forget a flashlight - you can tour the underground tunnels, which are really amazing. Well, hopefully she'll send me pics one of these days.   This minute  And now it's June and I'll finish me thesis this month. This means that it's after 10 and I'm still at work. And I'll be back again tomorrow morning at 8. But the amazing thing is that I am happy - compared to earlier when I had nothing to do and was able to take vacations to Turkey, the Netherlands, France, etc. Don't get me wrong - I live for traveling. But even more important is that I feel like I have an aim... that I'm working towards something. Aimless traveling will never suit me. But going to a small village in Ghana to determine the feasibility of implementing solar systems. That would be more than I could ask for from life. Can somebody please tell me if these jobs exist and if so where I can find them???  Well, that's enough for now... Just getting caught up - future posts are promised to be much shorter.

      Almost forgot: actually one of the most exciting things is that I am now the proud owner of a gmail account and without even having to swap my first born child (thanks jon!). Ahh a whole gigabyte of storage capacity. Yummy. So email me all you want to at mcclung@gmail.com :).

      Ah, wie schön. I will leave tomorrow for my camping spot on the Rursee. I have to be back in Aachen on Mondays for lectures - we'll see how I can manage that.   Someone hit my bike with their car a few days ago. Thankfully just a tube was broken and the chain displaced. So it's repaired and I'm ready to go. I loaded up my bike bags and will test ride it today. Actually, its a lighter load than I thought. We'll see if the bike, and my legs, hold up.  Learning here is 100% your ability to memorize. I find it hard to concentrate. But the time will go by fast, and it'll all be over soon :).  My conference paper is due tomorrow as well, so I have a lot of work ahead of me today.  Somehow I need to get motivated to write my "global engineer" statement, so I have 3 writing samples. I'm applying for a few technical writing positions, and I want one that's more editorial like, since the others are very research-oriented.  Not to mention my thesis. Ugh. Too much to do.

      Well, I had a birthday party on Wednesday night where we had yummy lasagna. But yesterday was the best. I took part in a "car rally" (what the Germans called it). I'd call it a scavanger hunt. Most of it took place in Belgium in Haute Fagnes, this beautiful nature park there. We had to swim :), eat pommes speciale and do lots of counting (stairs, car dealers, mushrooms, graveyards, etc...). T'was nice. And we came in 2nd place even though we were the last group to return.  And I know have all of my camping gear, and I've chosen the perfect place on the Rursee to stay. I just need a bike and bike bags, and I'm all set :). Well, and I have to finish this lovely thesis. Speaking of which :)...
