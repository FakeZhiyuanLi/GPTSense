         Aaron lived down the street about 8 houses, and for as long as I can remember I've always seen his racing trailer out in front of his house proudly displaying his racing enthusiasm.  He was only 24 years old when he was killed cause of an accident while racing in South Dakota on Wednesday. The pictures taken were just some of the people and friends that came to honor him at his funeral today and drove by his home.    We did not personally know him but his sister goes to school with Wesley in the same grade. By all who talked of him he was a very nice young man that was not afraid of pursuing his lifelong dreams even with the dangers that came with doing so. It's always a shame when someone so loved and in his prime of life must leave us so soon.   Our Hearts and Prayers go out to the family.

         Tonight the family went over Jeff's to celebrate Michelle's 14th birthday. I brought over a dozen Krispy Kremes to share the joy with anyone who hadn't had one, there goood!!   Jeff and Big Michelle put on a nice party and little Michelle liked all the attention she got. I took one picture from her point of view while she was under the spotlight.     Mom and Dad were the proud grandparents of the ever so fast growing grandaughter.

         Today was declared tax free day by our great governor and I did not have one single person question anything to do with our taxable items. I think they just thought it was the department stores cause it was really slow today. No big purchases for me I guess I'll have to wait for next years holiday. I rented a movie today like I usually do on saturdays and it was a Dud!!I recommend you do not waste your time on The ELIMINATOR.   Today Wesley drove to work at 5:00 AM and he did a pretty good job for only a few hours sleep. He even drove home, he's getting to be a pro.    Today Hal made some chicken on the grill with some carrabian jerk seasoning that we purchased in St Maartin last month.It was really good and I'm kicking myself for not getting more.   The Red Sox won tonight so all in all a pretty good day in Leominster!

       Today is my big sister's birthday. It's nice to hear from the family on your birthday ,especially when you come from a big family. I was lucky enough to reach her on her cell, and it really made my day.

       Hi everyone,   Thought  I'd try a site where I could post some of the things that are happening in Leominster and some things that aren't.
