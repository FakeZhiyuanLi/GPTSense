      Well, the name fits!  I am googled to death!  I am finding this assignment challenging.  I apparently am "tech challenged".  I said in the first class that I have crashed some computers and while that was in jest, I do seem to have a knack for getting the screens to do wild and crazy things.  Yesterday, I got my project's font to grow like Jack's beanstalk.  I havent' been able to get into my project at home and wouldn't you know it, I'm having another bad hair day!

      Thanks to Kery, I am going to invest in one of those flash memory thingies.I have been looking around for them and was glad for the information.  I discovered that I do have a port on the front of my computer - everybody jump and clap!  I don't suppose I can insert a sound clip here? This new technology should really be a big help this upcoming semester when I plan to take more classes than I have before.  Anything that will make that easier for me and reduces the stress I feel.

      I use spread sheets at work to manipulate information.  We don't have much of a need for formulas to that part has been a good review for me.  I tried for weeks to get the office manager (I use that term very loosely)to put a particular log in ABC order.  We enter information in a log and it's given a reference number.  Well, you can imagine what that log looked like with over 700 employees.  The problem came when we had to look up a reference number.  No one had access to the computer file to search for it that way.  We were supposed to look through this endless report (with a very small font).  Made me want to pull my hair out.  Well, that "office manager" departed and the new one did finally make that change and life is good now.

      I first ran into copyright when I wanted to get a copy of a picture that I had bought.  I couldn't understand why I couldn't use something I had already bought.  I also ran into it when I wanted to copy a cross stitch pattern from a magazine.  Yikes!  It's very technical and confusing.  I will remember that if I have an emergency situation in my music class, that I have a bit of breathing space.  I didn't think about the internet not being part of public domain.  I really wouldn't have thought that shareware and freeware would be copyrighted.  It's nice to see the sites that can be used for instruction for classrooms.  The one with about the Harbour was cool.

      Maybe it's just my age but all this information being stored on the internet and computers makes me  nervous .  it's kind of like the feeling I get when I drive over a long bridge.  The Chesapeake Bay Bridge comes to mind.  It makes me want to roll my windows down and get my handy seatbelt cutter out just in case the bridge collapses, I will be able to escape my car!
