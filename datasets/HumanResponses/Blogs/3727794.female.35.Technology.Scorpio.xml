       "You're not fat, you're in the wrong country."   --Denise Walker     OK, the only knitters I've met in KC are either older, a touch chubby, or more than a touch, or men.  I guess it comes from a combination of eating KC bar-b-que and being one of the fattest cities in America and sitting on our BUTTS knitting all the time.  I got a little frightened because everywhere I look I see all these patterns for knitted bikini's.  I started thinking, just who the hell is skinny enough to wear those???   Or are these chubby women getting a little too "knitters gone wild" and wearing them out in public???  Then I realized, oh yeah, NYC is where all the trendy little knit chics are blogging from that are making these things.  I'm afraid no amount of working out and dieting/starving would enable me to wear one of those things in public, heck even in my bedroom with the door closed!  They do look amazing on the right girls, but that's an outfit that won't be on my list of things to create.

       "Lead me not into temptation; I can find the way myself."   --Rita Mae Brown   OK, we need more details here. My first scarf that I knit was from the Memorable Women line from Schaefer Yarns. I used Helen Keller and it turned out so colorful. My life is lived wearing black black black, white white white and khaki, khaki, khaki. When I decided to knit, I decided I had to bring some color into my life. This was my first venture. I wore it through the winter and the spring and even pulled it out this summer once or twice just because.  Jildo's scarf is also of the memorable women line, in Margaret Sanger. Her story is pretty cool, in 1916 she opened the first birth control clinic and after being arrested many times, ended up as the first president of International Planned Parenthood. I thought it was cool that someone way back in the early 1900's was taking steps to allow women to control their own lives. I also absolutely loved the colors, such vibrant burgandies and such. I love the texture of these yarns, it gives personality to the scarves I'm making. I'll make my daughter a scarf from this as well once I take a short break and finish my first felted purse.     My son doesn't like being left out, as most patterns seem "girly" to him. He's 4 1/2 yrs and rough and tumble, but still likes to snuggle and hold my hand. One of the older ladies hanging out at the Olathe shop showed me a Schaefer yarn (OK so I'm stuck on those to start with) that looks like camouflage when knitted up, so that'll make Joey's scarf for this winter.  My felted purse is being knitted with 2 strands of Noro Kureyon color yarn. It's GORGEOUS. I love the colors, going this weekend to get my double pointed needles to make the handles for the purse.  If this felts as pretty as I think it will, I'm going to have to get some more of this stuff!

       "It's the good girls who keep the diaries; the bad girls never have the time."   --Tallulah Bankhead   I must have no life as I now am all excited to spend an evening at home with my knitting and watching tv or reading blogs and getting all inspired about the projects I want to try. I do miss the days of big hair, drinking all night and "making some friends..."   HOLY crap my face was thin back then, but so were other things as well. Life goes on.  Picture from my college days, with Lisa, Lampy, Jildo myself and Monica before a night out on the town.  I'm now addicted to knitting and the amazing yarns...I could spend hours in the shops just petting the damn hanks of yarn. Of course, I couldn't learn to knit on the lion brand cheap stuff, NO I have to get the good stuff. Ah well, do it right or not at all.  I've survived my first 20 minute lesson on how to knit from the shop in Olathe I'm off and running. I got my Stich 'N Bitch book, good rosewood needles and can't seem to go anywhere without my bag of whatever scarf I'm working on at the time. My digital camera is on the blink, so I'm stuck scanning for now. I'll update with pics as I'd like to have a record of my accomplishments and disasters.  My first scarf:    Currently I'm making my best friend Jildo a keyhole scarf as she had an unfortunate accident with a scarf that ended up with her scraping her nose on the pavement, so even though I laughed at her (what best friend wouldn't laugh at that??? I thought this would be the solution as it should stay put when put on. I've scraped my nose many a time but usually after falling off a barstool LONG LONG ago).  Us girls at the wedding I pretend didn't happen--speed bump in my life--I prefer to think of it as the day I wore the pretty off-white dress and had fabulous hair and got lots of presents. Sounds much better than the OOOPPSS day, doesn't it?    Jildo's scarf in progress:    I've got to break away from scarves, scarves, scarves. Here's my not-yet-felted party purse in progress. I've got to go buy double pointed needles to make my first icords to do the straps. I'm not doing any of the fluff from the design, thought it would look good with the natural rainbow colors as is. Can't WAIT to felt it.    I'm not letting myself buy any new yarn at the shop until I finish Jildo's my scarf. When I'm done, here's the next project:    I think this "knitting instead of eating" thing plus my hours (ok minutes) of working out and sweating and pumping weights will allow me to be hot and skinny enough to wear the damn thing in public once I create it. Of course, I can't start with a "beginner" level pattern, but at least it's just tagged as "intermediate". I'll go till I get stuck and go to the Olathe shop for help. I love the new shop in OP, but there never is anyone that can help there. Everyone seems to be making SCARVES freaking SCARVES.

       "Never eat more than you can lift." --Miss Piggy    Well, I'm planning on following that sage advice tonight, but I can lift a LOT of fried chicken and cottage fries with gravy at Stroud's.  Can't wait!!  Bday meal for Mikey turning 30!  I got all fired up and decided it was time I started riding my bike again.  Got it loaded (barely) into the back of the blazer, poor Joey had to ride to school with a bike seat next to his head.  I was thinking I'd start slow, with some little trails at a basically flat park near work.  I got on there and felt unstoppable, so of course, I take off down the road.  After getting a LONG way from work, I thought, you know, no one can come & get me because I have the keys here and my bike won't fit into anybody else's car.  SO, I decided I had to trek back UP all the hills I had enjoyed riding DOWN.  All in all, I had a wonderful experience, uplifting, motivating and I didn't have to get off to walk once.  I was so proud of myself.  sweaty, but proud.    I'm riding the bike my aunt Angie bought over in France when she was young and cycling across Europe.  It's older than I am by far, and is amazing.  Baby bro Will put some serious time & money into it, so I think I'd better tell him to take it to FL with him.  It's SO easy to ride, you can just glide forever.  Anyway, I was so amazingly athletic, it was scary.  Then, of course, I had to go out in a bang.  NOPE, no graceful athleticism allowed here.  So, I unlatch the helmet, coast up to my Blazer, pull one foot out of the little holder-thing, lean over and expect to pull the other foot out and stand up, BUT my foot is stuck in the dang thing.  Short story, IN FRONT OF A LOT OF WITNESSES (and all men, of course) I fall over HARD all the way to the pavement.  My helmet is no where NEAR my head, apparently you really DO need the little strap latched, crack my head, end up with one foot crammed up where a foot should not be, bruised my butt, scratched my leg and was basically all twisted up in this greasy chained, metallic thing and black-top.  I almost gave one old guy a heart-attack.  I had about 4 guys pulling me out and once they decided I was alive, they applauded.  Yeah, just watch sports center for the highlights.....I'm still sitting carefully and walking a little shaky.  If I can get my butt back on the seat, I'm going to try to make the lunch-time ride a habit.  It really energized my day.  (and was SO much more fun than sweating and jogging/walking/gasping that I used to do for exercise!)  I figured I worked off at least a big fried chicken breast, 3 helpings of cottage fries with gravy, mashed potatoes and green beans and MAYBE even a cinnamon bread roll thing that they make....I can taste it now!!  OH, best part of the day is my new look.  I got to work, looked down and realized I have a lovely BLACK 4 inch long mark from the bike chain across my left breast on my white sweater.  NOW after the "incident" I have matching chain marks embedded into both shins.  Then for lunch I had a campbells soup to go thing and it spilled an orange stain in my lap.  I look like serious white-trash, stylin!

       "I can be changed by what happens to me, but I refuse to be reduced by it." --Maya Angelou    Happy Birthday to my brother Mike.  I think he's 30 now.  Scary!  Well, I survived a trip to the old rich-lady swimsuit shop.  I've tried on every combination of suits/coverups/parts at Target, Wally World, Kmart and Dillards.  I figured I'd better head to the professionals (plus they had a buy one, get one 1/2 off sale).  You think that would be a plus, but it actually just added more pressure!  I ended up running on my lunch break, trying on about 30 suits and leaving there spending WAY too much money for 2 suits.  One is about 15 years too young for me and one is about 15 years too old.  I found the PERFECT combo, but OF COURSE the sizes weren't available for me.  It was a gorgeous light blue tank top that pushed up the little chest to fake it and a cute little miniskirt bottom that actually looked CUTE and not just like you were trying to hide your big ass.  They had the cute skirt, but the only top was XXL.  Even while pregnant I was not an XXL on top, and the little lady helping me said, "well we DO alterations, but I just don't think they can alter it that much" so I've got the cute skirt and a bikini top.  Guess it's time to bump up work on the old crunches.  Actually, I haven't done anything resembling a crunch or situp unless you count having sex about once every 6 months.  SO it's now time to START situps, UGH.  And the other suit was this cute cut, like a short tennis-dress that Venus might wear (ok in a size that would fall OFF Venus, but still cute as heck on me) BUT it's got material that resembles a couch in the 70's.  I thought, maybe if you squint your eyes....brought it back to work and I thought the admin ladies and sales exec's were going to fall off their chairs laughing at me.  Apparently I have the perfect suit if I were 50-55yrs old, so it looks like I just bought my mom a suit.  Tonight's Joey's "family fun water night" at the JCC pool, so I guess I'm going to try out the bikini top thing.  Hope not to scare the poor little parents there.

       "Let me listen to me and not to them." --Gertrude Stein    I missed my little blog diary this weekend.  Can't wait until we get our Roadrunner crap straightened out.  Joey and I had a pretty nice weekend.  He went bowling Friday night with my friend's daughter Samanta babysitting.  He came home with a bag full of spiderman stuff, doll ("action figure, mom"), pillow, bracelet, toys, tattoo's etc. They spoil him there so much, he absolutely loves it.  It's helped with Beth being gone to get to do special things just for Joey.    Sat. we had Josh & Elizabeth over for a playdate.  Josh is in Joey's class at camp and Elizabeth is a 7yr old red-head that is in our Elizabeth's group at camp too.  The boys had a blast, and having Elizabeth there was almost like Joey had a big sister to play with, he was hugging and hugging her.  Their mom & I sat around drinking diet cokes and talking and I really had fun.  Michael R. came over later that night and put Joey to bed and I went out with my Italian Stallion I met a few weeks ago.  Had fun dancing & drinking a few cocktails with him at the Quacamole Grill in KC, MO.  So far, things have been "casual" but flirty and he knows I don't want any big-ass relationships, but we'll see.  I think he's on his way down the road I don't want to go on, but we'll play it by ear.  It was sweet to have a guy open the door, tell me I look beautiful, buy ALL my drinks, blush & be visibly embarrased when I paid our cover as he talked to a friend.  The "new metrosexual" style of guys has turned men into wimps and I love the old-fashioned pig-headed guy SO much more than the new crap!  Really had fun, when the guy kisses me, I melt, it's dreamy, and I get stuck in 50's-lingo-land, can't help it. dreamy.  I'm going to start a list of "good things to know" to each of my kids.  I've learned so many things the hard way that I'd like a list.  stupid things, important things, everything in between.  Once I get this page figured out, I'm going to link another file I can just add to whenever.  I'll ask others to send me things they've learned from life.  When Beth was a baby, I started a few journals that way, things a woman would pass to her daughter, and I never finished them.  Some things are for women only, some are for both.  Kind of reminds me of that "graduation song" thing that was out a few years ago with the guy reading lists of things to know and it ends up with "always wear sunscreen."    Can't focus today.  Finishing up a lot of little details and am just kind of discombobulated, as Calvin & Hobbs would say.  Don't really know why.  Guess it doesn't really matter.

       "One of the secrets of a happy life is continuous small treats." --Iris Murdoch    I think I'll take my continuous small treats in a margarita or three tonight!  Heading out to the Fox & Hound to meet some friends saying good-bye to John from the Sprint group I go out with once in a while.  Should be fun.  Then, might head out to the boats to play a little cards.  I was distracted last time by my Italian guy, so maybe this time I can concentrate and play a little better.  Jildo, I've made the move to Texas Hold-Em, LOVE it, but OMG I have to watch out.    Ate BBQ for lunch, but it wasn't GOOD bbq, it was OK bbq.  It's just sitting in my tummy like a load of bricks.  UGH.  I'm going through jack-stack withdrawal.  Taking Joey to the Royals game on Sunday, should be fun.  I hope we make it past the 4th inning.  Actually, I hope we make it TO the 4th inning.  Royals traded another good player, go figure.  Last year was fun, anyway.  Who are we to bitch about wanting more than one winning season in a row????  I'd feel better if we could at least win a few.  That's it for now, not much going on here.  Work, work work.  Haven't heard from Beth yet, left another message in NM.  Hope my little guardian angel is keeping that kid safe and happy.  Just found out my cousin Kevin is overseas working for the engineering firm that just had the guy captured and beheaded.  His mom's doing pretty good, he's in Afganistan now, training before all the fun begins.  He's the kind of guy who would view this as a big adventure.  Actually, I'm kind of jealous of the ability to just pick up and go to the other end of the world without worrying about anything.    off for the weekend, can't wait!

       "I am no longer what I was.  I will remain what I have become."  --Coco Chanel    Well, I've finally started my blog.  My dear friends who have put up with me for years, know that I am not good at keeping in contact.  Email helps, but I end up telling some people the same things 3 times and others nothing and wondering why they don't know what's going on.  I thought this would help.  People can follow the boring details of my life and I can have a place to put thoughts down so I don't go insane and talk to myself.  Ok, I'll still probably talk to myself, but maybe this way I won't answer as often.  Jildo, once I figure out this bloggin thing, I'm setting you up on one also.    Let's see, baby bro Will just took a job with an engineering firm in Naples, FL making lots of $$ and has an apartment picked out in a ritzy area.  Can't wait to visit for vacation.  He's going to be on the gulf coast side right off the beach, and just above the top of the everglades, gator-ville.  He's got a new cute little girlfriend, Regan.  They've been dating about 2 months or so and seem pretty serious.  She seems to treat him nice and is more of a "beer and pizza" girl that his unengaged-ex (all Plaza and champagne).  My dating life is strange as always.  I have an old guy that looks like Kenny Rogers (eerily so) that I see as friends but who would give anything to be my sugar-daddy.  Was fun to go out with, but no option of long-term as he is about 1 year younger than my DAD and also a BOWLER, so no-go.  Good friends now.  ALSO, I got a phone call back in November from Vickie....DXXX.  I thought it was his daughter, so I said "what can I do for you?"  and she said "stop dating my husband".  That'll wake you up, I think I actually fell off the couch on that one.  I let her know nothing past friendship had happened, and there wouldn't be any future either.    Met a big, strong, cute Italian playing poker at Ameristar Casino.  That's not a good place to pick up men.  There are a LOT of men there, but you've got to figure, Sat night they'd prefer sitting around with other men gambling than going out on dates.  SO, figure he's a gambler and not much future, but I'm tired of not dating because I don't want to get in a relationship.  I just want to have a little fun.  This guy is sweet, intense, ITALIAN--sexy, kisses like you wouldn't believe, and is fun.  He'd fall in love in a second, so I've already given my "just for fun" speech and warned him that I'm NOT wanting anything more than talking once in a while and a date every couple of weeks, so it's casual.  but, OMG he's sexy...gotta love those Italian men.  Plus, I'll probably eat very well.  :)  My daughter's just left with her Dad for her 4 weeks of summer visit.  Joey's having a hard time with it, but is being pretty tough.  Plus he gets spoiled by everyone to make up for him not getting to go.  Dad took the little guy to the Royal's game and they stayed till the 4th inning.  The highlight for Joey was the Dippin' Dots ice cream.  He also picked the hot-dog that won the race on the tv screen at the game, so there you go.  The Royals also won the game and scored some runs with fireworks, so Grandpa had a good time too.  It sounded pretty cute, eating peanuts out of their baseball gloves (you know you have to have the glove on the entire time you're in the stands just in case).    That's it, back to work.  Check in later for more quotes and various ramblings.

       Never get into fights with ugly people because they have nothing to lose."   --unknown    &nbsp; Survived another workout today, I amazed myself at getting through all the leg-work without dying.&nbsp; I have all these pretty little muscles and definitions on my shoulders and my arms, and you can see all my ribs.&nbsp; I even have little lines in my upper abs, I look great, until you get to my belly button.&nbsp; OMG my stupid little poochie-belly is so nasty.&nbsp; I swear my hips, butt and thighs look even bigger next to my slimmed & sculpted upper bod.&nbsp; GOD I've got stubborn fat.&nbsp; It's now a battle between the fat on the legs and my willpower.&nbsp; I know there's muscles in there somewhere, because they HURT, but it's like the muscles are growing and the fat's not getting any smaller.....I'm TIRED of being chubby!!!!!  THEN, an old guy (ok at least he was a buff old guy, but still) is hanging out while I'm sweating and gasping on the treadmill.&nbsp; He's telling jokes, keeping me entertained, asking what kind of music I like, do I ever go out dancing....All right, I've decided lucifer gave me a freaky old-guy-mogo thing.&nbsp; I can't even turn it off when I'm sweaty and wearing clothes that show all the fat!!!&nbsp; Once this bod gets slimmed down, I swear I'm going to start playing volleyball and softball again and get myself around YOUNGER people.&nbsp; I used to think I was exaggerating this wierd old-guy-mojo, but it's freaky.&nbsp; There could be a ton of us out at a club, the old guys all gravitate to me.&nbsp; NOT my friends, not the other little hotties out there, me.&nbsp; Maybe my chubbiness makes me easier to approach?&nbsp; who knows.&nbsp; Maybe it's because I'm a fan of all the crooners, big band music, etc and it's like soaking out of my pores?&nbsp; They can sense the fact that I should have been born years ago?&nbsp;

       Now I lay me down to sleep    I pray the Lord my soul to keep.    If I should die while asleep, I pray    That God be a woman, or a guy who's gay.     &nbsp;   For if God is truly as I've been taught,    an uptight old white man, I will be caught.    And tho' I'm a good mother and a kind friend,    My dating old guys will take me down in the end.     &nbsp;   Down to Dante's Inferno, Nine levels of hell.    I took the quiz, didn't fare too well.    Scored high on two levels of the nine    Gonna hang with the lustful and gluttonous for all time.     &nbsp;   But if God's a gay guy or a chic just like me,    There might still be hope, in a happy place I could be.    Floating above the clouds, shining down beams of joy    Instead of suffering the hurricane of unquenchable desire    with Cleopatra and Helen of Troy.     &nbsp;   --prayer by TreasureGoddessChic     &nbsp;  OK, I'm definitely cutting down on the flirting with old guys thing.&nbsp; Takes me to icky places like lunch today with an old old-guy friend.&nbsp; Mark told me I can ride in his & Russell's handbasket to hell, so at least I'll have company on the trip down.&nbsp; While eating and deciding to mend my ways, I came up with this little poem....ok, realize I like OTHER people's quotes and words&nbsp;because I am not gifted in the writing department.&nbsp;  Update on the biting/hitting incident.&nbsp; Joey's friend Mya was trying to kiss him, he "wrestled her" to make her stop, she bit him, he "whomped" on her.&nbsp; Apparently "whomp" is 4 yr old for hit/scratch.&nbsp; He's still got little bruised teeth marks, so the little chica knows how to look out for herself pretty well.&nbsp; I had the talk that "little boys can't go around whomping on girls" and felt like a sexist pig.&nbsp; Oh well, he seemed to get the point.&nbsp; I told him he probably shouldn't be whomping on anyone unless he's already told a teacher and the kid won't stop bothering him.&nbsp; It's a thin line you walk when you try to keep your kid tough without making him a bully.&nbsp; I feel like whomping on someone myself.

       "Whoever said money can't buy happiness didn't know where to shop."    --unknown     &nbsp;  Man, I hate being poor.&nbsp;   SO, got a call from my son's preschool camp counselor.&nbsp; Joey hit a kid and then that kid bit him.&nbsp; She can't legally give me the child's name, but as Joey's a major gossip, details should follow tonight.&nbsp; No broken skin, just lots of tears from both parties.&nbsp; I guess they both sat in timeout together (wouldn't that make them fight more??) and the world went on.&nbsp; I can't believe my kid would hit anyone.&nbsp; Not because I think he's an angel, but because my kids are wimps.&nbsp; I'm trying to teach them to "tough up" (sounds less&nbsp;hick than the "cowboy up" I was using).&nbsp; I have a feeling I may be at fault for the hitting thing, we'll see.&nbsp; Joey tends to let kids push him around, take his toys, whatever.&nbsp; He used to tear up, then he learned to walk away or tell the teacher.&nbsp; I told him if&nbsp; kid is constantly picking on you, or if he pushes you, push him back.&nbsp; Oooppsss.&nbsp; I left out those details when talking to his teacher.&nbsp; We'll see.   The last "incident" we had was when Beth was playing soccer.&nbsp; My daughter's more of a butterfly chaser than a soccer player, but she had fun.&nbsp; She finally got it figured out that all the kids on the field chase the ball, so if she's a defender and stands on the OTHER side of the goal, that's probably where the ball will end up and she has a better chance of stopping a goal.&nbsp; It started working and she blocked a few shots in a game against some steriod-pumping 1st grade chics that looked like little men.&nbsp; One got tired of it and every time she went by shoved Beth into the ground.&nbsp; Beth just took it with this look of shock.&nbsp; I took her aside and told her the next time that girl comes and starts to push you, look around to make sure the officials aren't right there, and quietly shove HER into the ground.&nbsp; Well, next time down the field, the girl was aiming her shoulder right at Beth, Beth takes an exaggerated look all around her, then FLOORS the girl.&nbsp; No one seemed to notice, all was well, mom was proud....then Beth yells out to the sidelines, "HEY MOM, I PUSHED HER DOWN JUST LIKE YOU TOLD ME TO!" with a grin.&nbsp; Did I mention that we play in the Leawood Soccer league?&nbsp; Where all the moms drive Lexus's and NICE Suv's and wear matching sweater sets that cost 3 months of my pay???&nbsp; I got a few looks.&nbsp; OOOPPPSS..&nbsp; oh well!   T-Ball for Joey tonight, hopefully no major violence will break out amongst the 4 year olds.

       "I drink to make other people more interesting."   --George Jean Nathan    &nbsp; Pretty decent weekend, I got my daughter back in one piece!&nbsp; :)&nbsp; She's still wide awake at 10:30pm, reading quietly in bed trying to get to sleep, but she's still wired.&nbsp; Her dad let her go to bed and watch movies until she felt like falling asleep the past 5 weeks.&nbsp; It sounds like fun, and I'm sure it helped him and his new wife sleep in, but it makes it tough to get back on schedule here in KC.&nbsp; She really had a blast.&nbsp; Joey was so freaking excited today, he was like a child on crack.&nbsp; If there had been a doctor around, he would've given the child a ridlin shot or something.&nbsp; They really played great together, it warmed the heart to see.  SO, uneventful little weekend, waiting for Jim&nbsp;& Kerri to get to town with Beth so Joey can go spend the night at the hotel.....we have about an hour or so left to wait, when Joey finds a button under the couch.&nbsp; YUP, up his nose.&nbsp; I swear, he's the smartest little boy I've met (I know I'm his mom, but the kid is bright) and he sticks a button UP HIS NOSE.&nbsp; Then he says, "mom, that wasn't a very good idea.&nbsp; I think it's going to get stuck in my brain."&nbsp; So, about an hour and a half later, and I'm sure a TON of money in medical bills accrued, we're home with the button out of the nose.&nbsp; Beth, another very bright child, was playing with a penny last year and ended up swallowing it and lodging it in the end of her esophogas.&nbsp; The adventure went on all freaking night from 4:30pm until about 2:30am because of course it was a full moon, and every crazy thing that could possibly happen happened, so we had to wait on transport from St. Joseph's to Childrens Mercy and then there were two copters flying in and other major emergencies taking the surgeons' time.&nbsp; That penny cost me $1100 in out-of-pocket medical bills.&nbsp; I'm hoping the button will stay below about $500.&nbsp; I think they get that part of "gee, where can I stick this..." mentality from their father.&nbsp; Normally it's me thinking "how far can I&nbsp; shove this up his butt...." life goes on.  Went out with my little asian group on Sat. night.&nbsp; Ate like a pig at Huyen's house.&nbsp; OMG I now am addicted to fried green tomatoes.&nbsp; I've never had one in my life until the taste of chicago festival where I ate EVERYTHING they sold in over 100 booths.&nbsp; It's so sweet that they adopted me into their group.&nbsp; The best part is they can COOK and when we all get together, they tell me I can bring chips or cookies.&nbsp; Good ol' white girl cooking skills are limited to picking something up from the local grocery.&nbsp; We went out dancing at the Guac.&nbsp; Not the almost-cool one on Holmes, no no no we went to the wrong side of the tracks Guac in Olathe.&nbsp; Lordy Lordy Lordy, I was looking SKINNY last night.&nbsp; I've never seen that many BIG girls wearing tiny tank tops and short skirts in one place before.&nbsp; It wasn't a pretty sight.&nbsp; MAN I'm telling you, it was like being the one Mary in a room of overweight Rhodas.&nbsp; Rich is off to Mexico City with his new chica.&nbsp; She was very sweet and put up with all his obnoxious friends and danced also.&nbsp; It was a good time.  God, I hope that girl goes to sleep soon so I can get some rest!!  &nbsp;

      I finally got through the jibjab Bush & Kerry site to see the cartoon.&nbsp; OMG&nbsp; I heard their servers are going nuts trying to support this.&nbsp;  urlLink http://atomfilms.shockwave.com/af/content/this_land    Got my sessy toes done, little daisies on the big toes.&nbsp; I think the little asian chicks were cussing me out and smiling at me while they were painting.&nbsp; I was living another Seinfeld episode...I asked very nicely to have my little flowers done.&nbsp; She forgot and told me "you sit there, you sit there NOW" and I pointed to my toes and said "flowers?"&nbsp; "you want flowers, no?"&nbsp; "yes"...then a whole lot of smiling with gritted teeth and a LOT of talking in&nbsp;chinese.&nbsp; My flowers are not so stylish, but will do, good thing I tip well, or they'd give my ugly toes.   &nbsp;

       "I have bursts of being a lady, but it doesn't last long."    --Shelley Winters     &nbsp;  Guess what???&nbsp; I rode my bike without falling off yesterday!!!!&nbsp; I was so proud of myself.&nbsp; I swear to GOD I've always been a touch clumsy, but this was getting pathetic.&nbsp; I have more bruises on me than I had when I fell off the cliff when hiking with my girl scout troop as a kid.&nbsp; Still haven't gotten the seat lowered yet so I can actually touch the ground, that should help.   What else happened today, hmmm....OH yeah, the hateful one came out of her quiet, bitter little corner to try to wreak havoc on my daily life.&nbsp; What makes some people so freaking evil?&nbsp; You know the ones, they only smile this nasty little smile when someone gets hurt or humiliated...They end up as bitter, wrinkled-before-their-time witches all alone wondering why no one comes to visit...because you're a BITCH, that's why....&nbsp; I guess the war of the basement is back on.&nbsp; Round one went to the TreasureGoddess, round two is up for grabs.&nbsp; The stupid comma episode was just the feint before she sent in the cavalry.&nbsp; I'm wasting no more of my time dealing with her or her little petty problems.&nbsp; You know, it's a good thing I'm not petty, or I would have commented on her wearing pantyhose (who wears pantyhose now-a-days?) OVER her little ankle bracelet....TACKY TACKY TACKY...yup, it's a good thing I'm not petty.&nbsp; BRING IT ON...&nbsp; The amazing thing is she can hold that much power as an hourly administrative assistant.&nbsp; Everyone has always bowed to her because it's easier to keep the hateful one happy and give in.&nbsp; The sad thing is she and the other grumpy one ran off a very nice new admin employee.&nbsp; That is a bad karma area, you can physically feel the bad attitude.&nbsp; I'm so glad I'm WAY WAY WAY in the back corner office.&nbsp; Not only&nbsp;did this sweet, positive, smart lady call in sick today, she apparently told two of the other ladies that she was going on an interview.&nbsp; I hope she gets the job, poor thing.&nbsp;   This picture illustrates my theory on solving personality conflicts in the workplace.&nbsp; This is probably why I'm not in charge.&nbsp;       Had a major triumph on the treadmill tonight, my god, I might just get buff yet...&nbsp; This sounds so sad when it's written out.&nbsp; I was able to jog for 8 minutes in a row.&nbsp; IN A ROW.&nbsp; God, that's pathetic.&nbsp; Two weeks ago, I couldn't make it 2 minutes without dying.&nbsp; Amanda's training for a marathon, I'm training to hit 30 minutes.&nbsp; baby steps.&nbsp; The sad thing is with beer involved, I can dance all night long.&nbsp; You know, they have laundromats that serve beer, maybe someone should break into the working out while getting buzzed genre.&nbsp; I'd sign up.   I'm actually kind of excited about my workout tomorrow with Roosevelt.&nbsp; Have you ever seen a man named Roosevelt (NOT counting pictures of old presidents) who was not a muscular vision???&nbsp; He's very motivational.&nbsp; The man did tick me off because he said something about eating a bunch of Krispy Kreme donuts before our workout.&nbsp; I hate beautiful people who can eat anything they want...I used to be a person who lived on chocolate, beer and ketchup and never gained a pound.&nbsp; Two children and a bunch of years later, that crap doesn't work.&nbsp; I was also seriously impressed with myself because after surviving two weeks of dips (purely evil things) and other various wierd moves with weights, my arms don't wiggle.....WOO HOO.&nbsp; Once those thunder thighs get under control, I'm goin' shopping.&nbsp; OK, once I start selling crap on eBay and can afford it, I'm goin' shopping.   &nbsp;

       "I only like two kinds of men:&nbsp; foreign and domestic."   --Mae West    &nbsp; That pretty much sums up my philosophy of life.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; I had to take a detour on my way for my morning diet coke fix to the local diner, as three police cars of Olathe's finest were dining there.&nbsp; One was not-so-fine, but the other were eye candy....good start to the day.&nbsp; You know, you always feel prettier when the only other women in the place are the dregs of society.&nbsp; In comparison, I was HOT baby.&nbsp; Nothing like a little flirting and a lotta caffiene to start the day.  OK, I must be getting healthier because the idea of this just made me feel sick.&nbsp; Krispy Creme's newest invention is in the links section to the right.&nbsp; It just makes me shudder to think...  Not much happened yesterday, got up, fed the kid, went to work, went home, fed the kid, put him to bed.&nbsp; My brother and his wife came by and visited, that was nice.&nbsp; Barb's got a nice new job making&nbsp;big bucks again and all is well with the world.&nbsp; Now everyone I know makes more money than I do.... oh well.&nbsp; They just got back from Honolulu where Mike got to go for work.&nbsp; They're so dang cute, still holding hands and in love.&nbsp; What a match.&nbsp; Makes your heart feel good to see them.&nbsp;   Talked with my daughter yesterday, she comes home in 3 days.&nbsp; Joey's counting the days until big sister "Bethie" gets home.&nbsp; I had all these grand plans of re-doing her room while she was gone, haven't even changed the sheets yet.&nbsp; I better get cracking.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       "The good Lord never gives you more than you can handle, unless you die of something."    --Guindon Cartoon Caption     &nbsp;  What a weekend.&nbsp; I actually had a great Monday, mostly because I stayed home with Joey (my son).&nbsp; He got up at 3am because his tummy hurt.&nbsp; I've now crossed the line to becoming my mother because any time any part of our bodies hurt as kids, mom would put us on the pot.&nbsp; Well, it didn't solve the problem.&nbsp; He didn't have to go, I put him in bed with me, then about 30 min's later I hear this little voice say "I gotta barf".&nbsp; MAN those words can make a mother spring into action.&nbsp; I was like a superhero flying through the air carrying the child head-first aiming him at the toilet.&nbsp; I must be good, as he started mid-flight and it all ended up in the toilet.&nbsp; Thank god.&nbsp; I can deal with most things that come out of small children from all their various body parts...but barf is not one of them.&nbsp; They start gagging, I start gagging, it's not pretty.&nbsp; Then as I clean, the smell and overall image of things makes me start again.&nbsp; Anyway, the kid really felt pretty good for most of the day, I probably should have gone to work for the afternoon as mom offered to watch the little guy, but I had absolutely NO motivation to get in there.&nbsp; I actually took a much-needed nap and snuggled with Joey while we watched Scooby Doo and the Monster of Mexico, Scooby Doo and the Loch Ness Monster over and over.&nbsp; Nice monday, too bad the kid had to barf to get us there.  &nbsp;  Thomas the Tank Engine came to Baldwin City, KS on Saturday and so did we.&nbsp; Oh man, that was an event.&nbsp; My kid was in heaven.&nbsp; I was actually impressed as even though they charged $14 per person for a 25 minute ride on the "real Thomas".&nbsp; AND the ride didn't actually go anywhere, just backwards and then forwards.&nbsp; But pretty much everything else was free.&nbsp; They had story telling, magicians, fire trucks, mazes made of hay bales, even a little trailer filled with coolers of water and little paper cups.&nbsp; The one thing that was a little too real was this wierd homeless hobo guy complete with stick and bandana.&nbsp; At first you could see parents bringing their kids up to talk to "Hobo Joe" until they realized he was a creepy guy.&nbsp; The only thing he wanted was a train ticket (I don't think he realized it went back and forth and not to any destination), a ham sandwich and cookies, but only if they were chocolate chip.&nbsp; He got on stage with the magician with his list of demands and the magician had the crowd help in a disappearing trick.&nbsp; He had everyone wave their fingers and say "here comes the police" as they came to escort Hobo Joe to another part of the celebration.&nbsp; There was this one mom sitting back near Joey and me having our picnic lunch.&nbsp; She was chuckling as her kids started walking off with the guy as if "oh how cute, my little angels are going to play with the nice hobo..."&nbsp; I really don't like sticking my nose in with parents involved as most people get NOT NICE once they have kids and you offer any opinions, but I was a little worried here.&nbsp; I said, um did you know he's not part of the Thomas thing, he's just a homeless guy?&nbsp; She kind of looked at me as if she was getting pissed, and then thought, hey, my kids are playing with a serial killer and made a run for them.&nbsp; She still gave me a dirty look when she came back.&nbsp; Oh well, my good deed for the day.&nbsp; There were only two little vendors selling food, and I was still the Master of my Domain by walking RIGHT by the funnel cake stand....ummmmm...funnel cakes.....but I resisted.&nbsp; MAN it's tough getting beautiful.....ok, not aiming for beautiful yet, just aiming for less chubby.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I felt like I was on the Seinfeld issue where they were betting on being the Master of their Domains the other day.&nbsp; Carol (the only person at work who doesn't seem to be in a parallel psychotic universe) and I were checking in on each other's willpower at avoiding the BIG-ASS donuts everyone keeps bringing in.&nbsp; It was wierd, like "you still strong?"&nbsp; "yup, you?" "yup".&nbsp; Now every time I see the death-donuts or funnel cakes or anything else delicious that I can't have, I think "master of my domain..." it doesn't really help, but it makes me chuckle a sad little laugh as my mouth waters....I miss the old days of working at the bank in Lawrence.&nbsp; Friday afternoons at about 3pm, the CEO and his brother would bring the coolers up from down in the mortgage dept and we'd get happy with beer, wine coolers and a blender pumping out margaritas.&nbsp; I lived about 3 buildings down the street and would have a few escorts to help me wibble and wobble my way home so I wouldn't fall and sleep on the sidewalk....I think&nbsp;a few margaritas would definitely help our work environment.&nbsp; Some of those people with hang-overs might be seriously dangerous.&nbsp; I wouldn't want to arm "the hateful one" with any extra ammunition.&nbsp; She was awfully cheerful Friday, I must have some kind of crap to deal with when I return to work tomorrow.&nbsp; Last week, I kid you not, she had the controller (the poor man with the broken spirit) try to tell me that all my invoice backup pages needed to be redone as they were ALL set up with a comma between the month &amp; year...."November, 2004" and that just was not right.&nbsp; I actually laughed at the poor guy.&nbsp; I said, I know you have better things to do with your time and you know I do as well.&nbsp; I will work on them when and if I notice them from here out, but there is no way in heck I'm going back over my work to delete a COMMA, come on....she must be running out of ammunition to try to make my life hell, ah well, I'm sure she'll be back to form next week.  &nbsp;  Survived a 10 mile bike ride around the trails of O.P. on Sunday.&nbsp; I have some serious battle scars to prove it.&nbsp; I was actually doing pretty well, only had to walk up one hill, was almost feeling cocky...then I tried to cross this little overpass-thing next to Metcalf Ave.&nbsp; It's one of the skinniest yet on the trails.&nbsp; I'm almost across when this overweight old guy that did not resemble Kenny Rogers in any fashion (so no redeeming qualities here) on ROLLER BLADES starts across.&nbsp; I shout out, wait, hold on, I'm almost done....oh no, he says don't worry, there's plenty of room.&nbsp; Did I say he was OVERWEIGHT????&nbsp; also very wobbly.&nbsp; Men over 30 should not be on rollerblades unless they are HOT and GAY, enough said.&nbsp; YUP, you can imagine the fun, he wobbles his big self along, NO ROOM to pass, clips my wheel and I bash back and forth like a pingpong ball from the sharp metal fence to the cement barrier.&nbsp; I learned that helmets work much better when they are buckled, good for me I buckled that day.&nbsp; Also learned that you should probably pack some bandaids or gauze or such in the cute little seat pack thing I bought, not just lip gloss, keys and phone.&nbsp; I ended up leaving a flap of elbow skin on the fence, probably a dent from my helmet on the cement barrier, a nice little trail of blood from the said elbow and knees along with two massive funky round bruises on the inside of my knees, not sure how I got those, guess it was from smacking the bike???&nbsp; I should have left my foot up the guy's big old butt, but I just smiled as he skated by when he said "oops, I guess we didn't quite fit, huh???"&nbsp; If I wasn't wrapped in metal and suffering a partial concussion and slow and rather chubby myself, I would have run at the guy.&nbsp; NEXT time I'm taking him OUT.&nbsp; No more nice chic.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

       "Some days you just have to create your own sunshine."    --Sam Sundquist  &nbsp; Man, too much has happened in a week to update.&nbsp; Short version...I have taken the first baby steps to becoming an in-shape, no-longer-lazy-butt-couch-potato person who is not allowed to wear shorts in public.&nbsp; I am going to let the thin, buff, strong chic loose from her chubby-thighed and flabby-armed jail that is my body.&nbsp; OK, well at least&nbsp;I paid TOO much money for a program I can NOT afford to force myself to get my butt moving.&nbsp; I&nbsp;survived two workouts with a personal trainer named Roosevelt, a nubian GOD that&nbsp;is like a poster-child for&nbsp;why you should work out.&nbsp; Next to him I really really did not feel like a goddess of anything.&nbsp; But, I survived, and made it&nbsp;back on Wednesday.&nbsp; Another workout survived, barely, measurements taken...each of my thighs was the same size as my waist measured in high school, it was not a proud moment.&nbsp; Then, I'm taking a quick shower so I can run back to work and not gross everyone out because I think I sweated at least 3 pounds off in an hour.&nbsp; When I get out there's no longer music playing, I think, man, it's quiet out there.....YUP, they locked me IN and turned on the alarm.&nbsp; I'm&nbsp;saying, "hellllooooo....." just me &amp; the machines and weights.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought about calling the police, warning them, (this is in Leawood where&nbsp;5 cars&nbsp;respond with sirens screaming to ANYTHING called in), and setting off the alarm, but I can't figure out the stupid lock to get out.&nbsp; I call work and they laughed at me.&nbsp; That's reassuring.&nbsp;&nbsp;SO, I&nbsp;was of course STARVING to death, looking&nbsp;out the window at an Italian restaurant's&nbsp;patio seating with food food food.....found an apple behind the counter,&nbsp;I'm sure it was one of the thin barbie doll receptionist's major meals of the day, tough.&nbsp;&nbsp;They lock&nbsp;me in, I eat their food.&nbsp; It figured I'd&nbsp;get locked in a HEALTHY place, no m&amp;m's to be found.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I've now signed away so much of my money that&nbsp;I have to eat sandwiches&nbsp;for the next 3 to 4 months.&nbsp; I also have to increase cardio&nbsp;excercise on my own 3-5 days a week to see the results I want.&nbsp; I won't put in print the horror that was my measurements and percents, except to say that for most I was about average for a 35 yr old woman.&nbsp; The only really bad thing was my&nbsp;body fat %.&nbsp; I'm in the lowest 30% of women my age, and the percent was 33%.&nbsp; One third of my body is fat.&nbsp;&nbsp; ONE THIRD of my body is FAT.&nbsp; Man,&nbsp;that blew my mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I'm walking around with tree trunk legs the size of 2&nbsp;small people&nbsp;with a body that's one third fat.&nbsp;&nbsp;That helped me walk right past the reese's peanut butter cups in the candy dish this afternoon.&nbsp; I'll just repeat that as a mantra....1/3 fat...1/3 fat...1/3 fat... hope that helps.&nbsp; My starting little phrase going&nbsp;through my head for the first workout was "mini skirt, mini skirt, mini skirt"&nbsp; Then I saw what horrible shape I was in, and also standing next to my trainer/God, I revised it to "any skirt, any skirt, any skirt".&nbsp;&nbsp; I start up again on Monday.&nbsp; Shee-ra here I come...my goal is to wear one of my skirts hanging in the closet before it snows.&nbsp; We'll see....man I miss my pretty legs...........damn chocolate and lazy lifestyle!

       "I need a Hero..." --Holding Out For A Hero, sung by Frou Frou on Shrek 2    Oh the drama..... I'm tired of the metrosexual men.....  I've decided I'll date for fun, so I don't entirely lose my magnetic personality, but I'm holding out for my hero before I get into anything serious.  My new theme song lyrics:   Where have all the good men gone And where are all the gods? Where's the street-wise Hercules To fight the rising odds?  Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed? Late at night I toss and turn and dream of what I need  I need a hero I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night He's gotta be strong And he's gotta be fast And he's gotta be fresh from the fight  I need a hero I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light He's gotta be sure And it's gotta be soon And he's gotta be larger than life  Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat It's gonna take a superman to sweep me off my feet  I need a hero   You know, I'm not sure I like this new style of dating crap.  This whole online/email/instant message crap.  You don't get to know the real person.  People are so much different in what they reveal through the security of a keyboard and screen versus actually spending time with someone and letting nature take its course.  Every guy I meet now as soon as we start talking a little, they want to be im-ing me all the freaking time.  I've got better things to do with my life.  Even if I DID enjoy the little chat crap, what is with revealing all your fantasies, turn-on's and FREAKY fetishes in writing????  I must be old-fashioned.  I'd rather find out what someone likes IN PERSON at the right time, what the hell.  It just creeps me out.  I miss the old days....you know, picking up a guy in a bar, saying "I'm not usually a tramp...deciding if you WANT to be a tramp or not, flirting, smiling, shaking your bootie, whatever.  I'm starting to sound like an old lady.  OK, a slightly slutty old lady, but you get the drift.    My list for the "ideal man" is getting much longer and more defined.  I haven't made one of those lists since I was 21.  This one's a little more serious.  Once I figure out how to add pages, I'll keep my list attached here to add things as I think of them.  I just want the perfect combination of my friend Carol's hubby Steve, part of both my brothers' personalities, my cousin Roger's outlook on life, my cousin Don's sense of humor and the way he treasures his family, my Aunt Dot's significant other Bob's ability to lead his own damn life and still be a part of hers, supporting her when she needs or wants it and NOT being a major life-sucking force the rest of the time (no, I don't have issues here), my friend Russell's kind heart and strong will, my friend Mark's ability to fix almost anything and his slight addiction to Home Depot, of COURSE I want someone like my dad too (what little girl doesn't?), someone who is in decent shape and likes to do athletic things without going overboard (like the hottie's character in the movie Dodgeball), someone who can two-step and have fun dancing to the new trendy stuff too.  I want a good-old country boy who also likes dressing nice and going out once in a while, but who is mostly happy hanging out at home watching tv or going for bike rides or playing softball.  Sure, that should be easy to find.....till then, it's just play-time for the TreasureGoddess.

       "But it was a necessary accessory..." --TreasureGoddessChic    WOW, checking out the receipts, thinking, now how much can I sell on eBay??????  That's the worst part of the post-shopping-extravaganza-hangover.  Our themes for the weekend in Chicago were "Moms gone wild" (my fave), white-girl-monkey-luck (long story) and "but it's a necessary accessory".  Man, I can rationalize ANYTHING when it comes to shopping.  People should hire me out for my services.  I'll make you feel so good about spending money, but I'll be gone by the time the credit card bill comes in the mail!  Short version of the white-girl-monkey-luck:  I think I forgot to write that I went to Chicago with 3 Asian friends.  One is from China and the other two were from Viet Nam.  I'm kind of tall for a white girl anyway, and then I wear heels, so I basically tower above them and they mall-walked like they were leaving me in the dust.  It was quite humbling, actually.  I met them through my friend Alison I went to Friends Univ. with and they very sweetly adopted me into their circle of friendship.  OK, back to the monkey thing.  Apparently, THIS is the year of the monkey also.  I did not realize that.  I did know that the monkey is very lucky (probably why I'm still alive after the stupid things I've done).  We were eating dim sum (basically people walk around with carts full of chinese food and you grab things off the cart and everyone shares and it's quite a social bonding/eating fest.  The food is NOT like our little American chinese food, but REAL stuff.  I did pretty well.  You also have to realize it's 10am and breakfast time.  My system was not quite ready for the real stuff that early.  My friends must have rubbed off on me because I was actually chowing down on egg rolls & sticky rice and pickled cucumbers when I'm normally throwing down donuts.  The restaurant gave little cheap-o necklaces to the children that all had a monkey pendant with a red string.  I SO wanted to have one, but didn't know if they got the necklaces from the restaurant or a store in Chinatown.  I finally got the message across by pointing, making faces and almost grunting.  My chinese language skills only include "hello" and "thank you".  I found the manager, conveyed that I had 3 small children (so I lied, I wanted a necklace too) and he gave me some!  I went back to the table all proud of my international communication abilities to find that Lili had already got necklaces for us all.  oh well.  An old lady told me I was very lucky and then we had all kinds of good luck that weekend.  We would just barely miss the worst thunderstorms, hit the good deals in the stores, lots of little things that we decided were all due to the "white-girl-monkey-luck."    I've really got to learn to tell shorter stories.

       "Surround yourself with only people who are going to lift you higher." --Oprah Winfrey    SO, Chicago was too too too much fun.  I can't even go into details.  We walked all over that damn town.  We used the CTC train a ton, but I swear we walked like 28 miles in 2 1/2 days.  And we walked FAST.  Those little girls' legs were at least 6-12" shorter than mine and they were flying through town.  The sad thing also was that one was pregnant and STILL walked faster than me!    In a nutshell, we ATE ATE ATE ATE ATE and then ATE ATE ATE.  We also shopped and thank God the shops closed at 6pm on us while we were (imagine this) EATING at a "real Chicago-style" pizza place on the 4th.  I might have had to sell my blood if the stores were still open.  MAN it's fun to spend money there.  I got CUTE stuff, a few halter-style tank tops, TONS of makeup, face & nail shit (my true addiction) and crap from China-town.  I got the BEST baseball hat from ESPN with sportscenter stuff on it that actually looks good on me.  I've always tried to find hats that look good, but normally look like a trucker or a geek.  This is my hat, baby.  It was a good thing, as my idol Martha would say, due to our wake-up call at 5am for the flight out.  I had some seriously scary hair going on, and the more I tried to fix it, the worse it got.  Once the magical hat went on, my cute outfit worked.  It was back to mojo-baby.  I almost started spouting sports phrases from the old days when I was married to Jim and we had sports center on 12 times a day...but then I got over it.  Plus, it was 5am and we had to go running through the city and the airport.  I was also the only one without a cute little wheeled suitcase.  I was lugging the packed-until-the-zipper-is-about-to-explode bag plus a tote and a handled shopping bag!!!  Back to work.  :(  I could SO be a stay-at-home mom again, but it just doesn't pay.  I had an offer recently and could accept any time, but it comes with creepy-old-guy-sex, so it's out.  MAN too bad I have a few morals left.  OK, not morals exactly, more of a "don't want to set a bad example for the kids" combined with a low tolerance for creepy things.

       "Remember, Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did, but she did it backwards and in high heels." --Faith Whittlesey    It's FRIDAYYYYYYYYYY.  No, I'm not excited at all.  WOW this was the longest week.  I have no children this weekend, and though I'm very excited about that, I was all teary-eyed driving away to work this morning with no one in the backseat.    Heading out to celebrate Susie's move to TX, then running to the mall to pick up a cute outfit for the trip, date with my Italian Stallion, home to pack (of COURSE I haven't planned ahead) sleep a few hours and then at 6am I'm on my way to the airport for Chicago!!!  I'll post pic's when I return.  Can't wait!  Off to cram about a week's worth of work into about 2 hours.  My positive motivational thought for the day:

       "I have a new philosophy. I'm only going to dread one day at a time."   --Charles Schultz     Stupid, stupid, stupid....WELL, I might be having to update my resume sooner than I thought. Stupid, stupid, stupid. I had forwarded an email from Jildo to myself at home so I could reply to it away from work. SO what do I do????? I get on there and rant and rave and not about the evil one at work, oh no. I get mouthy about the whole damn place, my low pay, the way things are done, and the frustrations of the days in the cellar. OF course I hit reply and send, thinking I'm sending it to Jildo, NO I sent it to myself at WORK. If they are monitoring email, I'm screwed. screwed screwed screwed.  I have too much crap in my office to be fired. The way they do things around there, it's a first thing in the morning while everyone else is in a meeting or last thing in the day get rid of you quick without any warning. It's kind of like Sprint used to be. It'd take me at least 3 trips to load all my personal crap out to the car. I'd be so mortified that I'd probably leave most of it behind rather than go up and down those stairs. STUPID STUPID STUPID.  You know, I can be a brave, mouthy person once in a while to blow off steam. I know it's hard to imagine me spouting off my mouth, but it happens once in a while. STUPID STUPID STUPID.  Well, I guess we'll find out as the owners that used to love me are coming to town next week.  The sad thing is, after I ranted and raved on email and pouted for about a week I had decided I was staying put at least until I got the teaching certificate thing which would take at least 2 years from now.  Man, I am gonna have to cross my fingers & toes here.  Oh well, what's the worst that can happen?  They fire me?  Unemployment would be ok while looking for something else I guess.  We'll see.  The hard thing is the main owner and I seemed to really have a good connection, and I'd be scared of pissing her off.  Yup, I'm a wimp.

      AAAAhhhhhh, the days when hair spray was hair spray.  That old bottle of Vavoom used to be a weapon when the old boyfriend was trying to break into the sorority house, as well as aerosolized GLUE.  Good old, making a hole in the ozone hairspray.  Miss those days.  Monica and I got big haired, went skiing through 2 snow storms and STILL had big hair out at the clubs at the bottom of the mountain.  Here's a pic I ran across and it made me all nostalgic.  Man, I miss the days of the big hair and slender thighs...we'd get half-done to go play cards at the afternoon bar, then home for big hair and out to the clubs.  Lisa, Lampy (creator of the biggest hair imaginable), Jildo, me, Monica heading out to Bruff's:

       "Never keep up with the Jonses. Drag them down to your level."   --Quentin Crisp (1908-1999)     Beth's first day of 2nd grade was today. She went for the 1/2 day and is spending the afternoon resting with Grandma in her 6th grade classroom (they had early dismissal as well). She did great, but looked so tired!  Well, one good thing came out of the "weekend of the head injury." I was smart enough to grab a blanket & stuffed animal for Beth (it was FREAKING cold in the sad little er room we were stuck in), a water bottle &amp; my KNITTING. Almost forgot it, as I was running out the door, grabbed a few things and must have instinctively grabbed the bag. SO, spending 5 1/2 hours in a smelly little er room with no tv NEXT to the bathroom where you got to listen to people throw up and one old guy that pooped on the floor and laughed about it, was MUCH more pleasant with Jildo's scarf along. I added about 6 inches to the thing and now can't find the book to see how long it's supposed to be. I'm making the keyhole scarf in the Stitch N Bitch book, but with different funky yarn. Pic's are below in a previous post. I think I only have about 2 or 3 more inches to go and I'm DONE!  I'm moving on up to the next level of stitchery, don't have a CLUE what I'm doing, but I'm gonna start and every time I get stuck, go in to the little knit shop in Olathe and find a nice old lady to show me what to do next. Their customers just hang out in the back corner stitching away the day. That's how I learned to stitch in the round. The cool, trendy, BIG knitting shop in Overland Park is gorgeous, but there's no one there to HELP. They can all help you make a scarf, but I'm in scarf limbo. Gotta get out....Here's my next project. I figure the not-eating-at-night-cause-I'm-knitting diet thing will allow me to look all hot in this one:    I'm motivating myself to get Jildo's scarf DONE before I go get yarn for the new project.

       "Your life story would not make a good book.  Don't even try."   --Fran Lebowitz     That's why God invented Blogs.  Ok, HE didn't invent them, but where else could we all record a history of our mundane lives and get addicted to following along with others' boring life stories also?  SO, spent most of last night out at 90th St. and Parallel Parkway in good old KCK.  Nope, wasn't pulling in $$ by hooking, my daughter was on her first "big girl" sleep-over party out at the Great Wolf Lodge with her best friend Imory and her mom.  They went out about 3pm and at 7pm, Beth was walking along next to one of the indoor pools and slipped and fell straight back on her head.  I guess the life guard saw it happen and was immediately keeping her still and applying ice and all that.  She said she thought she felt ok, they went back to the hotel room and she couldn't see and started violently throwing up.  Her mom called me and she said she had the nurse on staff check her out and Beth needed to get to the hospital.  SO, shortened version is I made it across town and through construction and was from my door to the ER at Providence in 13 minutes.  I don't think that is humanly possible, but it was amazing.  I was careful, not to worry, but I hauled serious ass and the big guy (or more likely his momma Mary as she was always the concerned mom) up in heaven got all the old people and idiots out of my way and I was able to fly.  SO, turns out the poor little thing had a pretty serious concussion.  They did a cat scan of her head and she had very minimal swelling, and after a couple of hours she could focus her eyes again.  She knew where she was, and who she was, but other than that the little thing was so pale and had these big black shadows all over her face.  It was freaky.  She ended up having to get shots in both legs (at the same time) to stop the barfing.  After that, she was pretty much ok and passed all their neurological tests and we went on home.  The trip home was much more careful and it took 42 min's.  For the next couple of days she just has to lie around and rest.   Mom offered to take her after the early dismissal on Monday to save my ass at work.  I can't imagine telling them I'm taking part of another Monday off.  They'd think I was the smart one and interviewing.  NOPE, I've just got kiddos that are having a rough time lately.  I don't have the energy to start looking.  I'd love to have a great job offer, but then I'd probably have to work a lot harder.  I kind of like being left alone.  I love that I'm not micro-managed.  Pretty much I just have to do my job, check in once a week and keep out of the line of fire.  I hate the crazy people, the evil attitude that permeates the very recycled basement air we breathe and the LOW pay (even though the owners keep telling me how generous they are--I just don't think they realize that in this century, educated analysts in KC area are paid $40-75K.  $40 being WAY above me right now.)  I shouldn't be surprised, but still I'm kind of disappointed.  I mean, one of our owners uses a printer that takes 8 hours (i kid you not EIGHT hours) to print off her weekly reports we send down rather than spend $50 for a new one that would zip them out in minutes.  I guess the standard of using things until they don't work any more has served them well, I mean they vacation all the freaking time in Australia, the Bahamas, fly whenever and where-ever in style, so the poor little single-mamma should learn something from them, but I STILL need more money to survive much longer.  Heck, I throw away a pot when it looks a little too crusty to get clean.  (that's when I actually USE a pot for something that resembles cooking I guess)  Guess I'll have to pull my head out of my butt and start working on the resume and crap.  Maybe later.

       "I tried a dessert called 'Death by Chocolate' but it only made me stronger."   --from a Hallmark card I got in the mail     Man, it's still cool to get a letter in the mail.  Heard from an old friend from way back in my dating-the-first-hubby days.  She also is divorced from the butt-head she married (actually her butt-head ex was best friends with my butt-head ex.)  We should have looked out for each other better.  Actually the problem was we'd all go out together and she & I'd have fun and the butts would have fun, we didn't realize what a pain the guys were until we each moved away and we were stuck with them by ourselves.  Ah well, I wouldn't have the munchkins and she wouldn't have her little one either, so we're all better, stronger women now I guess.   I'm here all alone....just me and the bitter ones.  Everyone slightly normal is out on vacation, sick, or moved to TX.  I think I'll hide quietly, maybe no one will notice I'm here.  Cleaned off my desk, I actually saw the fake wood plank again, woo hoo what excitement down in the basement.  I'm taking the Joe-man out mini golfing at Incred-A-Bowl.  Then, my cousin's coming over and it's off to the boats.  I'm gonna take me some money from the old guys.  :)  Please, please, please let time move forward................

      Forgot to say Russell had the time of his life at the Barbie Convention in Chicago.  OMG I guess the special convention entertainment on the last night was a trip.  Bob Mackie is the guy who designs amazingly beautiful and EXPENSIVE collector barbies.  He also does a lot of celebrities.  He came out for a few minutes and spoke and then introduced two of his real-life models.  Dionne Warwick came out and sang a song, and the crowd went wild.  You have to realize these people are seriously possessed women and very nelly gay men who spend all their money and all their energy finding, dressing, trading, etc. these barbies.  It's like a cult.  Addicting even for me and I have a few barbie accessories is all.   SO after the crowd went wild, and things went on, CHER came out and sang the Jack song from Will & Grace....  "If I could turn back time...." and Russell & Mark's table was right up by the stage.  I guess she came striding down the stairs, put her arm on Russell's shoulder and sang into his face.  Mark was doing his Cher impression, Russell was trying to breathe, and nellies were screaming and fainting to put the 60's fans of Elvis to shame.  I would have paid any amount of money to see that.  God, I am laughing just thinking about it.  What a rush, I was so excited for Russell.  It's even better than the Jack episode where he tells the real Cher to keep working on her impression...."If I could turn back time..."

       "If you can't laugh at yourself, make fun of other people."   --Bobby Slayton     Well, the mysterios rash of Friday and Monday sicknesses goes on.  Wonder who's interviewing today?  Even the newest new girl was sick yesterday.  The last 2 newbies we had who were "sick" in their first week were working on lining up better jobs.  Hmmmm.  Well, this new one seems to be pretty good at her job and not so LOUD and GRABBY as the last one.  Two of our regulars are out today.  What sucks is I was out last Monday sick because Beth really WAS sick, no playing hookey even!  Burned another day of vacation that I'm gonna miss come Christmas-time.  It's FRIDAY!!!!  Thank God and all that.  It's been a long-ass week and I'm ready to get out and not have any obligations for a while.  Beth's off to the Great Wolf Lodge for a sleep-over bday party with her friend Imory and her mom.  Should be fun.  Totally forgot to get a PRESENT as it's a BIRTHDAY, so got to do that before I get her dropped off at her friend's house this afternoon.  You know, it's a sad sad thing when you're looking around your house at 1am trying to think, could this be a present for a little girl???   I used to be so organized, I was super-mom.  Of course, I wasn't working full-time back then.  I had this amazing idea of the "present box".  Whenever the kids got a present they already had, or I saw a great sale at Target I'd stock up on stuff and put it in "the box."  Then, whenever we had a last-minute gift need, I'd go to the box, pull some lovely wrapping paper out and be ready in an instant.  The last bday party we went to we ran by Osco to their NOT very cool toy aisle and the gift ended up wrapped in "kraft paper" (ok a paper bag turned inside out) that the kids colored on the way to the party.  Beth colored a card (copy paper folded up) and Joey "decorated" the package.  Amidst all the lovely bags with cascading ribbons, shiny papers, stickers, etc. was our sad little package.  One of the moms next to me told her friend, "I wish I had the time and energy to have my children be so creative" when the little girl opened our gift.  I thought, lady, 3 1/2 minutes will inspire creativity you would not believe, but just smiled and looked like one of those moms who make cookies from scratch, bake our own soap and the like.  Man, I'm lucky if my kids even get bathed every day.  I'm guilty of the smell test when things are really rushed.  If I can't smell you from across the room, we'll just use a washcloth for the dirty face and knees and wet down your hair, you're good to go.  Good thing I only had 2 of them, how did Grandma do it with 14 kids?????  Man, Grandpa would have had to find another freaking room to sleep in if it were me.   Also, Damn Damn Damn the Little Debbie company for making nutty bars.  damn damn damn.  Ate 3 packages last night, that means 6 nutty bars.  Good thing I had a kid to give one to or I would've eaten the whole box.  So much for master of my domain, the domain crumbled like crunchy peanut buttery chocolate covered cookies....

       "You'd be surprised how much it costs to look this cheap."   --Dolly Parton     High Points of the day:  #1 --> saw a guy PEE outdoors this morning, that'll wake you up. Running late, I thought I'd head to Santa Fe exit to bypass all the congestion on 119th, then got stuck waiting for a train. Sat there, be-bopping to the kids' Shrek 2 cd (yes, I'm a geek, can't help it) and watched a guy 2 cars back of me get out, walk to the trees and whip it out to pee. I'm looking around, and no one else notices the guy. I thought I was hallucinating, but then figured if I was, he'd be better equipped.  #2 --> the roly polies are all scared of the mighty bug-squishing woman, haven't seen any so far.  #3 --> I'm all officially registered for my ladies classic professional bowling tournament the weekend of Aug. 20th out in Gladstone, MO! Woo Hoo, now I've got to get BUSY practicing and get the new balls drilled &amp; worked out. My little workout sessions have actually paid off here. Not only can I now wear the skirts I used to bowl in, but also have all this stamina and energy and am not worn out after 4 games. I've got 9 games qualifying on Sat. Last year I was in the money until about the 6th game, got tired and TANKED. This year I'm out for blood, baby. (I SAID I was a geek, ok?)  #4 --> I'm not this guy. I guess losing 20 pounds is a lot easier than 800 pounds. How sad is that that AFTER losing 321 pounds, you still can't turn over in bed by yourself??? How sad is it that now I'm hungry for a bag of oreos?    urlLink http://www.cnn.com/2004/HEALTH/08/11/half.ton.man.ap/index.html

       "It is better to be a bad original than a good copy."   --The Marquise du Defand     Got the scanner to work, but the software to crop and make things all pretty SUCKS and it won't work....here's the pic's of my not-quite-ready-to-felt party purse to be: for other knitting virgins like me, it will be soft and fuzzy and look totally different when it's felted, can't wait!    Here's the scarf for Jildo. I'm almost done and so excited. It really looks better in person than on my scanner, so don't be worried Jildo!    I'm so addicted to this knitting thing. It seems I'm also what's known as a knitting snob as I am obsessed with petting all the pretty fibers in the knitting shop. I'm like a junkie, good thing I'm POOR! Oh well, until I finish these projects and the other scarves I've got started for the kids I can't add to the stash. MAN I can't wait until I can make sweaters, there are so many cute designs I'm dying to try!  Sad thing that the highlight of the day at work was my triumph over the roly polies. Another one bites the dust at work. One of the pretty good admin ladies put in her 2 DAY notice today. That area was the one we just lost the newest hire, things are gonna get stressful around there, but I'm staying OUT of it. The few good people are looking (and finding) better paying jobs elsewhere with people that are not evil, bitter, soul-sucking employees to work with. I mean, where else can I work that I get in trouble for putting the roll of toilet paper on backwards???? That's pretty unique. Sad, but true.

       "Life is a rollercoaster. Try to eat a light lunch."   --David A. Schmaltz     OK, gotta create a family-friendly blog for the grandma's and Aunt Angie and such. Poor Aunt Angie. My little bro Will and Raegen came by for a quick visit before he got back on the plane for Florida. He HAD to bring up the "boys town" part of Chicago.  Will doesn't stop there, once she realized it wasn't the nice organization you donate $$ to for underpriviledged kids, no, he started naming names of the bars....the man hole, the back door, etc. I thought Angie was going to die. You gotta give the lady credit, she turned awfully pale, but didn't say a word and just smiled weakly until it was over.  Raegen and a few of her girlfriends want to go to Missy B's for the drag show, so RUSSELL, get it together and organize a trip down there soon!!!  Went to Hallmark, OMG I've gotta get that barbie shoe tree thing for Xmas....It's like $20 and it's just ME ME ME. Put it on the list for Santa. I've been pretty good this year, still have a lot of time to kiss ass yet. Can't wait to see pic's of Russell's time at the Barbie convention. Wonder if Mark made it through without screaming and ripping heads off a few dolls???   Knitting update : Went to TOWN this weekend on the keyhole scarf (yes, another freaking scarf) for my friend Jildo. Jildo had an unfortunate accident with a long scarf that got caught and ended up thrown to the ground, scraping her little nose, so I'm making the chic a little scarf that won't go anywhere it's not supposed to.

      All right, I started this blog as a record of my knitting adventures as well as to record thoughts on the crazies I work with and the strange men I date and my friends and such.  Completed my 3rd scarf, ready to move to bigger and better things. I made the scarf on the left out of this FABULOUS yarn from Schaefer Yarns. It's so colorful, bumpy and soft! I love it. I made the one on the left and it's too cool. I'm now working on one in colors that resemble camouflage for Joey and one in BRIGHT pinks, purples and such for Beth for this winter.    I've decided I now LOVE knitting in the round. I'm such a knitting virgin, branching out seems almost sinful. I've got the tube knitted on this little party-purse but I'm not doing any fluff or extra stuff. I'm using a Noro Japanese yarn that is gorgeous in muted earthy rainbow colors and going to felt it. I've now got to learn how to do the handles and I'm almost ready for washing. Can't wait.    I'll add my own pic's once I get the new digital camera and get the finished product out. OMG I'm now addicted and have all these sweater patterns I can't wait to try. I can decrease, can't figure out the increase thing yet, use my Stitch N Bitch book for pretty good directions, but need HELP! Our new knitting shop has an amazing supply, great stitching room, but NO help. Most of the employees don't teach anything other than plain old knit & pearl stitches. The old shop in town is tiny, crammed with goodies, and has pretty helpful customers that come in to stitch, so I'll probably head over there to see if some nice lady can help a sista out.  This guy's knitting blog cracks me up!  It's inspiring to see the finished products all these people can come up with.  Makes me hope I'll be doing more than scarves, scarves, scarves...  urlLink http://queerjoe.blogspot.com/

       "If your horse dies, get off."   --anonymous     I don't know why I like that quote, I just does.  Had "the talk" with the Italian man and he took it pretty well.  Ate VERY good lasagne and fettucini (how do you spell that?) at Casconies, to die for.  Made an absolute piggy of myself.  We decided to be good friends that got together once in a LONG while, went out dancing, had a pretty good night.  Maybe I should write a book on how to break up with someone and get them to think it's their idea.  I am truly gifted, probably because I've dated entirely too many people in my long long life.  Went to Home Depot for the kids craft this am.  Very cool, made periscopes that actually work.  Beth is really gifted with the hammer, I hardly had to help at all this time.  Joey is absolutely dangerous and thinks he's ready for power tools, a perfect little tool-man.  I crack up because they have these little home depot orange aprons with pockets and Joey fills his up with nails and was almost grunting this morning.  I'm gonna have to find those old "tool time" shows with Tim the Tool Man Taylor for him.  I'm going to do some "ladies" classes and learn "power tools 101" and get the girls to go along.  You get to build cool crap like a potting bench, table, and other perfectly not-useful things made out of 2X4's.  They're called do-it-herself clinics.   urlLink http://www.homedepotclinics.com/

      Ok, I love love love my little journal/notes-to-go book! I got it at Borders and LOVE IT! It's got cool pages that tear out with little funny sayings along the edge. The one I used today said "You're not bitter, you're cynically hopeful." Another fave of mine is "You're not alone. I don't like your boyfriend either."   urlLink http://www.areyoumyboyfriend.com/SimplySheProducts.html   Why can't I come up with crap like this?  I've got the bad attitude, the over-abundance of sassiness, a little creativity (ok a lot more with some chocolate martini's, but still).  Yup, I'm gonna have a drink/creative session with Russell and we're coming up with our own line of journals, note cards and the like.  Something with a combo of his old-fashioned barbie style and my attitude...could be good.  If not, at least we'll have good drinks.

       "It is easier to stay out than to get out."   --Mark Twain     Isn't that the danm truth?  Well, I'm going out to dinner with the Italian Stallion tonight, and it's probably going to be one of those uncomfortable ready-to-run-any-minute kind of things.  I went into this with the standard..."I'm not wanting a relationship, I just want to go out once in a while and have some fun..."  crap and that didn't work.  He called 4 times last night FOUR TIMES.  Then on each message he apologized for bothering me, but he missed me, then he apologized for missing me....OH MY GOD.  No, I didn't answer the phone last night because Italian man was bothering me and old-guy-Kenny called twice as well also to apologize for bothering me at Quick Trip and let me know he's going to leave me alone since he cares so.   PLUS I forgot to write that as I stopped off for my daily diet coke fix at the old Quick Trip last week, I pulled up to the curb, got out and OUT jumped old-guy Kenny!  My old sugar-daddy-wanna-be.  He had a diet coke and the newspaper for me.  I got back in the truck, locked the door and thanked him sweetly, asked him to remember that if he cared about me as he said, he'd consider me out of his life and will concentrate on his WIFE.  I drove off, poured out the diet coke and went to Sonic for two big-ass breakfast burritos.  mmmmmm.. I'm hungry now, think they'd notice if I snuck out for a burrito?  bacon....mmmm...  damn 3 more hours till lunch.  In one of my myriad quote books, I stumbled on a cute list of how to know "he" is not the "Mr. Right": --He spends more time talking to his mother than to you --You hesitate when his name comes up on caller id (or like me you yell at the phone and push the ignore button) --You've never pictured him without his clothes on (ok any old guys I've dated fall in here) --You wear your comfy cotton undies instead of a new lacy thong --You don't shave your legs right before the date  SO, fun weekend planned, probably breaking it off with Italian man (why should I have to break up when there wasn't supposed to be a relationship ANYWAY???)  playdates for the kids, bday parties for my friend's daughter and we're GOIN' TO THE FAIR!!!  OK, I actually LOVE the fair, my kids are like "whatever, Mom" about it.  :)  Woo hoo what a wild life I lead.  At least I get to wander around looking at cows & sheep &amp; smelling funnel cakes & cotton candy.  (I'm still master of my domain even though Marvin brought a TON of doughnuts yesterday to work.)  FIT into one of my old skirts again, so maybe this eating vegetables, fruit, meat and other non-processed food and exercising crap really works.....still miss funnel cakes....mmmmm.

      Check out the cute chics in Chicago!!! Man, that was too much fun. Ok, I warn you, I traveled with 3 Asian girls, so we took a LOT of freaking pictures and they're all posed. My total fave is here, hot policeman, yummy... DAMN I forgot how pretty he was.     Here we are at the train station ready for dim sum for breakfast. The picky eating white girl was actually putting away some serious eggrolls and pickled cucumbers at 9 in the morning. Probably why all those asian girls are so damn thin!    Here's the real hotties, I had so much fun on this trip!!!  We ate ate ate and shopped shopped shopped and danced with stinky men, what else could you ask for?    Here's the whole batch of pictures...  urlLink http://photobucket.com/albums/v256/TreasureGoddess/Chicago%202004/

       "Why get married and make one man miserable when I can stay single and make thousands miserable?"   --Carrie Snow     Friday I worked ALL day as usual, but mom & dad took the little munchkins out to my grandparents in western KS for me! NO KIDS woo hoo and all that! Got my sessy toes redone, and now the Korean women love me AGAIN! They were giving me that smiling through gritted teeth while they cussed me out thing at first and I smiled and said "toes please?" I said "everywhere I go men love my toes, thank you so much" and I was in like Flynn. Back to real smiles, GOOD lookin flowers, and not only did they charge me the rate for regular ped and I got all the extras of the spa ped, but I also didn't get charged for the sessy flowers! Man, I've got to get a life that that was about the highlight of the day.  Went to the boat and played a little Texas Hold-em. Flirted with a cutie next to me, remembered I wasn't picking up any more men at a gambling institution, let the fact that I'm a single mom and not interested in dating anyone from the poker room come up in conversation to scare him off...THEN learned he's a freaking ATTORNEY at a downtown KC lawfirm and apparently one of the partners as his jr. lawyer guy was out playing also....Damn. He was pretty too.... Did make about $300, big bucks for me, didn't get home till 4am.....I'm too old for that crap.  Sat &amp; Sun--had a BLAST with the fam. My little girl Elizabeth was born 12 hrs after one of my cousins had a little girl named Elizabeth 7 years ago. They both have red hair, blue eyes and look almost like twins. Freaky. They got to play together and it was a crackup to see them running around and bugging their little brothers.  Caught up with my cousin Roger (very cute--trying to convince him to come to KC to go out w/ my friends to flirt w/him a little). We've decided we're tied on the worst dating stories.  My story--most of you already know, dating the "perfect" old guy, he went away when I wanted him to, didn't call every night, sent AMAZING flower arrangements, took me to the nicest restaurants &amp; clubs, bought me jewelry, etc. a very good potential sugar daddy, until I answered the cell phone one night. The girl asked for me and I said, that's me, she said her name (same last name as the old guy) and I said, "what can I do for you" thinking it was his daughter, she said  "STOP DATING MY HUSBAND."  yup, that one sucked.  Roger's story--he was being set up with the "perfect girl for you" and started emailing back and forth.....only to realize later that they were actually 2nd cousins or something. The mutual friends they had all thought they were just perfect for each other and they were starting to get to know each other, when for some reason Roger's distinctive last name came up and she realized it sounded familiar. Turned out her grandpa and our grandpa were brothers. icky.  One of our cousins is a priest and had the best story of all. He was going through the meetings with the married couples right before they get married and he got a phone call from this lady about the couple, that they couldn't get married. Turned out they were BROTHER AND SISTER. The call was from their mom, who had given them both up for adoption and kept track of where they went in life when she realized they were about to GET MARRIED. I didn't ask if they were good catholics and didn't have sex yet or not, ICK...can you imagine????? I thought it was one of those urban legends, but apparently it was true.
