      we went to tettegouche yesterday. it's the closest thing to heaven and ireland in these parts- the waves crashing over giant rust-coloured rocks and the whole greeness of the place... i went to our rock beach, shell, i wish you had been there with me.  my sister michelle: hoodkingdom.blogspot.com  the night skies here are so clear and the stars so shiny that i have to force myself not to look up for fear i'll decide again to become an astronomer.    what sing'st thou? know'st thou not there is but one theme for ever-enduring bards? and that is the theme of war, the fortune of battles, the making of perfect soldiers...  in my thoughts nadia.

      funny how one ends up in a smalltown in the northwoods when one is supposed to be in belfast northern ireland.   mikey does not know how to hitch a trailer. even when marcus shows mikey how to hitch a trailer, mikey cannot. we got about thirty feet onto the highway before i said: mikey it's not attached, it's dragging on the ground. and then, maybe we should pull over. hmmmm... a good idea. it was not attached and it was dragging on the ground and the wires were frayed and it was burning. we were on the side of the highway but part-way into the lane of traffic. i said, maybe we should turn on the blinkers so mikey turned on the blinkers. mikey just stared at the not hitched trailer so i said i'm going to flag someone down. so i did and of course they knew how to hitch a trailer. everyone in this town knows how to hitch a trailer. you can't live in this town and not know how to hitch a trailer.   i saw three dead deer today and two alive ones.

      i went with anna johnny and michael to michael's uncle jay's cabin on vermilion this past weekend. we had a hoot with mikey's uncle- he's like an alcoholic santa clause... really,  just  like that. fishing involved a ritual to the great god of the fish in the sky and maybe a little of granpas "cough syrup". we shot at beavers too and ate like crazy... the food could've fed a multitude. i'm fat and happy.   song of myself- whitman

      dim memory brings the shade of lesser days around me,&nbsp; back before the waking, the time of my founding,&nbsp; dark was the heart with but its own desires,&nbsp; when a god will not be tamed, man will serve a liar,&nbsp; from the shores i saw the sails of my sisters and my brothers,&nbsp; left  behind  the old life, born into another.&nbsp; eighteen years upon these waves storm, salt, and pounding,&nbsp; i wouldn't trade a minute of the seeing or the doubting,&nbsp; alive i am in the teeth of faith, few answers i have found,&nbsp; but the call that brings me back to life, to it i am bound,&nbsp;&nbsp;three winds fill the sails of my sisters and my brothers,&nbsp; grace from beyond, scorn from behind,and love for each other

      ive had a couple of crazy weeks and am spent. i spent a week on trail in the boundary waters canoe area recently. i paddled nearly nonstop for 6 straight days and made some good north dakotan movie quoting friends at the same time. that was some very hard work, portaging canoes and packs that weighed twice as much as me. the day after i got off trail,we took a trip to grand marais which made me want to be a sailor and fisherman. i think i might do that. i rock climbed at carlton peak and kayaked on lake superior.  when youre out there in that flimsy  little vessel and you see those big menacing waves, you think that it is their cruel intent to break over you and dash you on the rocks, when really they would rather carry you softly along the rolling hills of sea. its hypnotic. and magical. great seafaring weather. im going to be a sailor. grand marais:      May pretty horses Come to you As you sleep I'm gonna go to sleep Let this wash  All over me.
