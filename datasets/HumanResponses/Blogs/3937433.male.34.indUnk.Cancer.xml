       I just wanted to&nbsp;publish a post with a graphic in it.&nbsp; This looked like a good graphic don't you think?&nbsp; After all it's hot out and stuff...  She's eating her ice cream the monty way!      PS - I caught Dave Navarro on the latest episode of America's Most Wanted.&nbsp; Did anyone see that?&nbsp; Dave's mom was murdered some years ago, and AMW actually was responsible for catching the guy.&nbsp; Now he's on death row.&nbsp; Rock on!!

       There was a lot of work to do at the cabin this weekend, so I made sure I was on my way within an hour after work on Friday.  I wanted to get up there and at least get started on the big project we had planned.   Everything was going great, there was a lot of traffic being the tail end of rush hour, but still I expected to get up there with plenty of daylight left to work on the shoreline.   Then, as I approached the MSP airport from the west, suddenly every single lane of traffic came to a dead stop.  No car could move.  100 percent gridlock.  People were getting out of their cars and walking around to see if they could find out what was going on.  Other people, trying to get to the airport, started to exit taxi cabs with their luggage and walking down the shoulder.  A small group of people who had walked up, reported back that there were half a dozen  urlLink state troopers  parked sideways in the freeway, blocking off the entire road, as well as the only nearby exit at 34th street.  But there was no accident.   I wondered if something was going on at the airport.  That's when I noticed that there were NO airplanes taking off or landing.  There was one helicopter circling directly above the airport, in a place normally I'm sure he shouldn't be flying.   Finally, a girl on a cell phone in the next car said she called home, and on the news they were reporting that Dick Cheney had just  urlLink landed  and was getting into a car.   For over half an hour, myself, hundreds of other people, UPS trucks trying to get their packages to the airport, many police vehicles, were all tied up doing NOTHING, all so Dick Cheney could come to Minnesota to try and get votes.   Guess what,  urlLink DICK ....I think you LOST more votes by making people sit on a freeway, with no advance notice that they were shutting down a major artery  urlLink six-lane freeway  on a hot, humid July afternoon in rush hour, then you will ever gain by cheerleading yourself and your  urlLink monkey boss  (who, incindentally, was just here  urlLink a week ago ) to  urlLink wiped out dairy farmers  and  urlLink unemployed mine workers .   I wished I had a bunch of  urlLink Kerry  bumper stickers to sell while we sat there (not that I'm a Kerry fan), waiting, with no information WHY we were waiting, or for how much longer we would have to wait.   I hate politicians.   Here's some stuff I found only because Dick Cheney made me wait around on a freeway, and now I'm blogging about it.    urlLink http://www.buzzflash.com/analysis/03/09/15_cheney.html    "The most important thing is for us to find Osama bin Laden. It is our number one priority and we will not rest until we find him."- G.W. Bush, 9/13/01   "I don't know where bin Laden is. I have no idea and really don't care. It's not that important. It's not our priority."- G.W. Bush, 3/13/02

       I hate it when people say "I'm not saying..." and then they proceed to say it.  What the hell is that?  "I'm not saying you're stupid, but you are really stupid."  Who invented this manner of speech?  That's not the Monty Way

       I went to  urlLink Arby's  today and my order came to whatever .01. I give the  urlLink cashier  my $20, and sure enough he gives me 99 cents change.   Now I'm walking around the rest of the day with coins jingling and falling out of my pockets. Very annoying. Now I can't sneak up on anyone.   A long time ago I used to work at  urlLink Hardee's  in  urlLink Cloquet . I used to round up for folks so they didn't have to walk around with all that change. I mean what's the big deal? They had a standing policy that unless your cash drawer was more than $20 short, they didn't even bother asking about it. Even when they did, if any other workers used that drawer, they couldn't do anything about it.   So if you have a choice giving someone 90+ cents in change, or a nice $1 bill, give em the bill.   That's the Monty Way.

        I cleaned up and shredded a garbage bag full of old bills and stuff last night.  I still think the kitchen table is too big, but it came in handy last night for that particular job.  I was reading  urlLink this  blog today.   Don't really know what to say about it.  Not sure what made me read it.  Actually, I don't really know what makes anyone read anyone's blog.  Just natural curiosity I guess.  I always have to get up early on Tuesday for a staff meeting.  For some reason that always makes me stay up late on Monday nights.  Last night I stayed up late watching the Olympics.  Gymnastics is pretty incredible.  I like Gina Gershon a lot.  Here's a pic.  Out.

       The weather warmed up nicely! Saturday was easily the nicest day of the year so far..  Vikes kicked the Cardinal's ass. The new tailgate lot was pretty cool, but a long way from the Dome. I guess it will be okay as long as they keep offering free shuttle busses or train rides. I can get on the freeway and get home a lot quicker now, that's a bonus.  My cousin had a really good time at the game. I tried to teach him the  urlLink Viking's fight song .  I have a really big table in my kitchen now. It's a nice table but it's just too big. I only wanted a little microwave cart with a cabinet underneath for pots and pans and stuff. Every day now, I want to go home and load up my truck with either stuff for  urlLink ARC , or for the  urlLink recycle center . I want everything out of my house!!! Adding this table was a setback to the house-swamping-out roll I was on.... dammit..

       Dang who stole the sun? Yes it's Minnesota but it shouldn't be this cold out yet.  My cousin is flying in tonight, I'm taking him to his first NFL game on Saturday. I don't remember my first NFL game but I can tell you it was a Vikings game, since I've never been to an NFL game that wasn't hosted by the Vikings.  The tailgate lots are shrivelled away. Supposedly there are new lots ( urlLink Rapid Park ), I'm going to check them out tonight. Riding the new  urlLink Jesse Ventura train, aka Hiawatha light rail . It's a sweet way to get downtown for sure.    HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO BOLIO!!!!!!
