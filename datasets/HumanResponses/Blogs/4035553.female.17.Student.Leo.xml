      ok, so yesterday was the youth frisbee golf (frolf) jake and i were partners. i called it that we would lose, cuz the team was all humphrey, and we're unable to have that much success at one time. so, the first couple holes was a lot of fun, but then it just got old. people were all not talking to either of us. i actually had jake ask me why they were ignoring him. :( it was so sad. he just looked at me and asked. i wanted to cry cuz the look in his eyes. but, eventually, he and i had a funny moment out there. we're on a straight one, all you had to do was throw it across the cleared field. well, jake threw it and it went straight into the woods. it fell into the thorny brush stuff. so i had to go crawl through it to find my frisbee. it ended up inside the bottom of this old rusty wagon thing that was all full of rotting tree stumps and branches and such. so i finally got it out, lol, and i went around to the feild and realized i was covered in little grub larva looking things. it was soo gross...so i was pulling them out of my hair for the next fifteen minutes or so. needless to say, jake and i came in last place. lol  on to church. we got there from frolf at around 5 or so. so we ate pizza and i had to have pepsi..ick..then i ended up going outside and talking for a bit. that was ok. but then, i just wanted to be alone. so i went and was sitting on the sign, but john wouldn't let me stay there by myself. so then kyle came over, too. and they tried to get me to talk to them, but i wouldn't. then i said something to kyle that i shouldn't have. i'm just so tired of everyone thinking they know me and what's wrong and then saying they care and can help. and i know that he really does, but i just got tired of hearing it, i guess. i told him that he doesn't know me, that no one does. they all just think they do. so i said that, and i immediately felt real bad for it. but, he said he still loves me, and that he understands why i said that. just to not ever say it again. that he loves me and can only know what i tell him. at youth, i had wanted to stay out in the hall by myself, but then i felt like i should go to at least worship. so i did. about a third of the way through the first song, i went to the altar and immediatel burst into tears. not jus tthe crying kind, though, the racking body from sobs kind. so, people were coming and praying for me, and that was great, but i hate crying. but it was good, cuz i got to just tell God that i need help, cuz i'm really starting to wonder if i'm gonna make it through everything. so, ya. i cried and told God that i need help. please.

      ok, so i have to just accept that he doesn't want me like that anymore. i&nbsp; mean, i know where he's coming from, but it still sucks, and the understanding doesn't damper the pain any, either. i guess maybe it'll make sense someday. it has to.  why is it that everytime someone notices that i've lost weight, which is happening more and more now, they always think i've been starving myself. why can't people just accept that i'm doing it and i feel like being healthy? ugh. people get me so pissed off sometimes.  so, apparently i'm going camping with the youth group over my birthday. the 19 through&nbsp; the 21 of august. it's only $60 for three days and two nights. and i've never been camping before. it sounds like a lot of fun. but at the same time, it's my eighteenth birthday. and i feel bad, cuz my dad probably wanted me to be here for it. and i'm kinda worried that he won't sign for me to go, cuz i won't be able to sign for myself..stupid three days.. omg, my throat hurts so bad. it's not used to the clean air anymore.. i haven't done my homework yet. it's not too bad, so i think i'll read the poem tonight then do the questions tomorrow in the morning before i go.  i got new jeans today. they're a k-mart juniors 13/14. two weeks ago i was a 17. that's crazyness. but i'm excited about it. they're really cute, too. all faded and such.  anyway, i'm gonna go try and get some sleep or at least rest for a bit before i have to get up again. but my throat hurts, so i really want to just eat something to make it feel better :( but whatever. we'll figure something out in time. we being the phrase, not that i really think i'm a we. lol. ok, night to whoever i gave this site thing to. God bless. ~katie humphrey

      so, i just finished babysitting four kids. they got here at around four in the afternoon, and, as you can see, it's now about quarter of twelve. i didn't sleep much last night cuz we got in late from six flags. and then, i tried to take a nap this afternoon, but john woke me up. so i'm really tired, and i'm having emotional issues because of it. like today, john was here to clean the shingles on the house. i understand that, but when he was done, he just sat with me for like two seconds then ran off to&nbsp; play basketball with alex. and i have this aweful fear inside of me that all i am to him is some physical enjoyment every once in a while. but he sais i'm not. and i have to believe him. cuz if i can't trust him, who can i? i mean, he's always been there for me. and i know that there are other people i can talk to about stuff, but they all judge me for my mistakes. and, like tanya and ashley, they know about the worst things i've ever done, but they still accept me for who i am. and i know i can trust them, but i'm not 100% comfortable with them. i need more time to really be. it took me about three or four months with john, and that was cuz i was with him all the time. even at that, he knows i trust him 100%, but he still has to work stuff out of me sometimes. i'm just not used to talking to people about how i feel and the things that bother me. especially when it involves people grabbing my butt, or following me to talk about it. but when i told him about mikey grabbing my butt on sunday, i wouldn't tell him the name, so he was frustrated. he actually asked me again today. but i can't tell him who it was..i mean, he'd kill him. and, it wasn't nearly as bad as others have done to me. mikey only kinda poked/brushed me. maybe it was an accident? no, it really wasn't, but i don't want to make a big deal out of it. although i do feel a lot lower about myself than i did last week at this time. i don't know why i let it bother me that much. i shouldn't. it's not that big a deal. well, it is to me, but not the rest of everyone, except john, of course. i really thought that his feelings for me were only a physical attraction cuz he got sex from me. but, today, i was really tired, and i just couldn't take it. i actually looked him right in the eye, and i was like, ok, i feel not important. he was like how so. i said in general. he kinda looked at me funny and was like i like to spend time with you, you know that, right? and all i said was do you like me or *pointing to the lower half of my waist* this part of me. or is it the basketball hoop outside and the food and stuff you get from me. he looked so hurt. i felt awful. but i went outside and got a hug from him. i whispered in his ear that i just needed to hear from someone that they loved me for me, not my stuff. and he just told me that he loves me. then, when he got home, he sent me a text that read: "kate, we might not have the physical anymore, and the title, but i still will always love you and be there for you and that will never change. i love you and you are there when i need you. you are the first person i go to with everything. you just can't understand what you do for me. you say i do stuff for you and whatever, well, it's the same with me." i read all that stuff, and i just wanted to cry. i'm so tired, and overwhelmed, and i haven't had a good cry since washington. that's a while. o wait, i did one night here. i think it was a week ago, though. i'm due. lol. well, i'm really tired, and i still have to do some homework. i just wanted to get some of this off my head.  i can't wait for my birthday. i'm gonna get my lisence as soon as i can, then i'll be driving myself and john to school. but also, i can get an appointment with a counselor or shrink or something. cuz i really need to. i'm so messes up right now. i can't do it myself anymore. i'm glad i can at least say that now, cuz before i couldn't. but, like with heather, it's beyond anything i or her parents can do for her. so i'm gonna at least try it. hopefully it works out better than things with mike did. cuz that&nbsp;was awful.  anyway, i think i'm tired enough that i&nbsp;can sleep. hopefully i don't lie awake forever, cuz that's when i start thinking. me thinking is a bad thing unless i have something specific to think about. which i don't at this point. although i do have to finish this story thing..maybe that'll do the trick. so. ya. i'll write more when i get a chance to.  ~katie humphrey  p.s. i changed my first diaper today. and it had crap in it. and then i&nbsp;got to change my second one, too. also full of crap. so it was a fun day. yay. feel the joy. ok, night&nbsp;

       well. tonight was, as usual, an interesting occasion. i had a hankering for pizza, so we got some. we then watched "uptown girls". very good movie. i highly recommend it. wonderfully timed was a phone call from the beloved john henry. as the credits began rolling, i called him back, and the conversation began, one which i'm sure you're dying to hear all about. we enjoyed the usual small talk, then he proceeded to tell me about a couple women who have taken me under their wing. they, apparently, were very upset to hear that john had dumped me. o, my apologies. that we had come to the mutual agreement that we should focus on being only friends from here on out. while, in all actuality, i'm only waiting around, hoping that the day will come that he's ready for a relationshiup again, and that he choses me to have that relationship with. part of me knows that it will never happen like that, it never does. but i need some kind of hope. something to look forward to. and i don't want to admit defeat on this one. i can't accept that&nbsp;i failed him. i promised myself at the beginning that i wouldn't. and i know that i have, but i just can't seem to tell myself that it was enough to make him need to end the relationship. i'm really glad that we're still friends and all, but i need him. he doesn't seem to realize that. he sais he's still there for me and all, but it's just not the same, you know? i can't give up. some people say that i deserve better than a guy that leaves me for lack of wanting a girlfriend, but they don't know him, what we've been through together, what he's done for me.   today, he asked me if i regretted having had this time with him. i didn't answer at first, because i didn't know what to say. i knew i didn't regret meeting him, or dating him. but at the same time, i do regret some of the things that have happened as a result of our dating. i felt aweful, though, because&nbsp;in my taking&nbsp;a moment to think over the answer, he asked a couple more times, and i, still thinking, took too long to answer him. he honestly thought that i didn't care to have met him in the first place, that i would rather have not met him at all. but he's very wrong.  another story for another day... my father and brother, jacob, are somewhere in ohio tonight. they're driving back from seattle, and will be home at some point this week. apparently, father called lorelei and talked to her all about it, but he didn't ask to talk to me. big surprise there, huh? so, ya. the boys will be back on wednesday, and i get to go home, to my bad, and my room, and my shower. and, of course, we can't forget the loving family that will be returning. the ones that make me feel ever so loved and important. i mean, i know that they care, they just don't show it very well. at all.  ok, so, it's very late. i have to be up at about six-thirty tomorrow morning, so i won't be getting much sleep tonight. this is good, though. this little page to vent about stuff. i think i like it. more tomorrow. if the spoiled little brat lets me have the computer at all, that is. night! ~katie humphrey

      right now i'm kinda blah. i want the rain to come so i can go run around in it. but i'm actually getting tired, which hasn't happened for a while. and at the same time, i'm wide awake. but this bra is getting real uncomfortable, so i hafta take it off real quick.. ok, much better..lol anyway, i'm really blah. today i went with ashley to chucky cheese cuz she was babysitting. so i went with them. that was pretty fun. then i went with dad to jake's friend's house. gotta know that was the most fun i've ever had. we gave some kids sown the street a ride home and jake ended up staying the night over there. so dad borrowed a movie from them and we watched it when we got home. it wasn't all that great of a movie, either. really predictable. but right now, i'm really excited that there's a HUGE storm coming. there's a hurricane down in virginia or something, and it's clouds are all the way up here. so..we get hit in about two hours. i'm gonna put on some shorts and go puddle jumping. and maybe for a bike ride, just for the heck of it. monday night i'm gonna hopefully be making my demo thing. i have to call and see if morning star has made my world from jaci velasquez. cuz that song is really awesome for my voice. i got a perfect score when i performed it in competition a few years ago. i love this song i don't wanna go. i call it john's song, cuz he used to have me sing it to him. he didn't know it was about God, he thought it was a love song. so i'm putting it on there for him. cuz whether he feels the same or not, i still love him. a lot. so everyone else can think it's on there cuz it's right in my range, but it's really just for him. that's actually why i got it in the first place. lol anyway, i'm really out of things to say for today, so i'm gonna go lay down for a bit before dad wakes me up for the rain. besides i have church all day tomorrow, too. so, hopefully i get some sleep. we'll see. ok, night. ~kate

      ok, so i babysit for these four beautiful kids. the little boy is kinda annoying cuz he won't stop crying, but i still feel bad for him. they have a mother that really loves them a lot, but the house is a mess, and there's bugs everywhere. i wanted to just do the dishes today, but midet said that her mom would be angry if i did. and i don't want to be offensive. but it was all i could do. i wanted to cry by the end of the night. and the girls are so precious. they fight a lot, but i think it's just for the attention from anna. the other two just have to deal and fight back as best they can. but i guess that's just the way life is dealt sometimes. though it makes no sense to me. anyway, it's almost tomorrow, and i have to be up early to babysit the gotta kids. so i'm out like when i play dodgeball (which is my icon, coincidentally). night ~katie humphrey

      well, last night i slept over at ashley's house. that was a lot of fun. then today, josh took us to lunch and the driving range. i suck at it, but it's a lot of fun, so i'm definitely doing it again sometime. ashley got highlights (they look awesome) and i cut a few inches off mine. then john met us at the mall and we walked over to the theater to see the village. some guy got stabbed to death and his fiance found him. that, coupled with all the dead animals in the movie, became too mich for me. i ended up spending about 45 minutes in the hall, bawling. eventually, john came out and just held me. i didn't have to tell him what was wrong, he just sensed it. but..ya. it sucked. after he got me mostly calmed down, we walked over to applebee's cuz he's always hungry. but ashley decided to throw some pity on herself cuz i had all john's attention. WHATEVER!! but john stayed with me, which i really appreciated, cuz i needed him. but after we got inside, it was too much, and i ran out into the grass and just sat there. john came out and talked to me for a few minutes. then he made me go back inside. so i curled up in the corner and wrote this poem. the dead person is my mother and the friend  is a constellation that i talked to in my yard late at night. caseopea. she was always there when i needed her. haven't talked to her since mom died, though. so, ya. here it is.   yellow rose   "i'm already there" is how it goes but little they know, i gave the rose that begged her please to stay away i couldn't take it another day but now the way i feel has changed the path i've chosen is crooked, deranged i often wish i could go back to times when it was dark, all black and i could see my long lost friend that we could our friendship mend i used to tell her all my fears she would dry up every tear without her ever speaking a word she held my foothold, kept it firm but every aspect of life has gone wrong i often have trouble with finding my song in this world that's full of bitterness, pain it feels there's nothing for me to gain and as i place this yellow rose down my world goes silent, there's not a sound no one exists but her and me i on earth, she by the sea of shining diamonds and forgotten sins she's gone for good, will never breath again she's better off, i tell myself as i look around at the snow that melts and as it melts, my tears, they fall the earth and i, we bear all as my emotions are running wild i can no longer be a child i shall no more think for myself but always for others and how they need help and whatever may come with any situation i must always remember i'm God's own creation no matter what she did, it can't bother me that yellow rose has set me free   so, there you go. umm...ok, well, i'm going to john's tomorrow. carol said she's gonna pick me up and let me spend some time over there with the family and such. i love her so much..she's really been a mother figure to me the last while. well, i'm gonna go ahead and get this posted then go to bed soon. it's been an interesting roller coaster of a day. lataz. ~kate

      so, today is sunday, so, obviously, i had church. well, this morning, i didn't really get anything in particular out of it, but i was asked to sing tonight. being me, i said sure. mike wanted me to sing potter's hand. i was like, ok. no problem. so, tonight i practiced it with mike laura, which was interesting in itself, and it was kinda high for my range, so i was a little worried about it. and my throat was kinda sore and being spedish, so that was also a fear. but then, when mike started preaching, he said i was singing in the middle, so i listened to what he was saying. actually digesting it, not in one ear and out the other. and it was something that i really needed to hear, too. and i was fighting not to cry when he called me up to sing. i was like o God, please let me make it through without crying. and it was really hard for me not to. but i made it. and people were telling me that i was a big blessing to them. so i guess God used it. i know He used it for me. cuz i was so touched by the word that mike gave us. actually, he got it from julie p. but it was really good, just the same. but, ya. i cried from it, too. it sucked. i went forward at the altar call, and almost as soon as i got down on the floor, tanya came over and was praying for me. i imediately started crying. like crazy. so, that's my story for tonight. well, the laura family is over for games and food. which is awesome, FOOD!! never thought i'd see the day i'd say that one. lol. anyway, so i have to go socialize and such. so, i'll come back after. ok? ok. so, more for y'all lataz. love y'all. ~katie humphrey
