      So I have decided to spruce up the old blog (Laura and Savannah have finally bugged me into doing it...)  I'm going to try to update, but I'm not making any promises.  What's new with the Brantino you ask?  Well, nothing much; here's the quick and dirty:  Still no solid prom date and anxiously awaiting to hear from GSP so I will know if I will be losing five weeks of summer.  I have to get reading glasses in order to prevent my eyes from getting to the point where I really need glasses.  I got flipped off while driving...for cutting off another car. OOPS!  My sister claims to have a running freshman poll (I'm thinking about 2 people) that if I grew my hair out long, I would become a "hottie."  Hmmmmm...  If I ever do change my hair style, it won't be because of a freshman poll.  5 weeks of school left...Summer plans anyone...???

      I just spent almost 2 hours reading the 9/11 timeline mentioned today in Leander Kahney's blog.   It's really scary  to think that so many people, including high ranking government officials, could have had knowledge of the attacks before they happened.  I leave tomorrow for Louisville and will not return until Thursday.  I started to work on my homework, but, of course, got sidetracked.  That leaves me with two chapters to read in my AP book and a  TON  of review problems for math.  Fun.

      I had to get up REAL early today.  I went to Easter sunrise service at Mount Pisgah and had to get up at 4:30.   Yuck.   Lot of people from our church came as well as Lindsey and crew.  When I got home I sat down on the couch at about 10 and ended up falling asleep and sleeping until 2.  I really didn't mean to do that!  This afternoon Greg, Torrie, Joe Paul and Katie came over to hunt Easter eggs and Greg, Torrie, Mom and I ended up doing to Francis BBQ where my arranged prom date works.  I was afraid the situation would be a little awkward, but it really wasn't that bad.  Mary (The arranged prom date) was  REALLY  funny and I think we will have a good time.  Should I call her and ask her if she wants to do something between now and then?  I think I might try, but she works a lot.  Ah, decisions, decisions...

      I have come to the conclusion that I am uncool.  No after prom plans, no life, no after prom plans, my tux is all messed up and errrr....I don't know what to do after prom is over.  Plus, I haven't been posting.  How uncool.  I applied for FBLA Reporter because I probably won't get to go to camp...and somehow I got VP of Competitive Events.  I'm happy, I don't really care what office I get, I just hope no body gets mad.  Prom is gonna look pretty cool.  I hope it rocks.  I also I hope I don't get slapped in the face with a steak at Showgun.  I never eaten there before, but I have heard that they throw food.  Maybe not the best place to eat before prom?  I should sleep....kinda got a big day tomorrow.  Pray that I make it though the day....and that my date won't want to kill me.  I might just croak from all this prom crappage anyway…  tino

      I'm mad at my car.  I've been nothing but good to it, I even washed it yesterday, and what does it do?  Freakin short circuits.  I can still drive it, my power lock on the driver side door just went out.  This may seem small, but it keeps blowing the fuse, which also has something to do with what locks the gearshift.  So now every time I break my gearshift clicks telling me it's ready to change gears, at 50 MPH.  Lets not think of the cost of replacing the little motor inside the door.  Gillie Hyde doesn't even sell wiper blade for under $100.  (If I paid that much for wiper blades they had better be gold plated or something.)  The other day I found out I didn't get Senior Engineer, which isn't a big deal at all.  It's just that a few of the people that go it don't seem like they would be good team leaders or are overall insane.  I'm working on a diabolical plan to sabotage it all next year...can we say wireless access point on the same frequency as their wireless network hidden in my backpack? (They'll never find it! MAH HA HA!)  In all seriousness, I wish everybody next year great success and hope everything goes well.

      One week left... then graduation... then GSP... Wow everything is flying by.  I thought it was after your senior year that everything was supposed to change, but it seems like everything is changing now.  My dad quit his job, his last day is Friday.  I'm happy for him that he will be able to take some time off an do what he wants to, farm, ect.  It just feels weird because my dad has worked at the same bank since before I can remember and I can't fathom the idea that he won't be working there anymore.  I guess I'll get used to it...  Graduation will be hard this year because I know so many of the seniors.  At the same time it will be a reminder that we only have one year left.  It doesn't seem like it was that long ago that we were Freshmen.  I guess I'll get used to it all...

      It's late and I can't talk much.  Tommorrow is the last day of school as well as Graduation.  (Good and bad)  I leave you with this random thought:

      2 more days guys...2 more days.  ...and half days at that!  The review sheet in chemistry just reaffirmed how much I want out of that class.  I'm probably not even taking the final in any of my other classes.  I'm bad, I know.  I can't wait for summer is all I have to say.
