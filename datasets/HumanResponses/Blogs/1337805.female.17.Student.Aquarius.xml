      I gues what bothers me the most about this all is that she knew she was doing something wrong.  She ran from us in the hall, and she never even stopped by my class to say that he was here. She's a sneaky, horrible little person, and if she was to suddenly disapeer, I wouldn't mourn for her. Not for long at least.

      Oh god....Worst day EVER. So today, my best friend was going to come and visit me and some of my other friends at school today, because he has two weeks spring break. So we went outside by the busstop, waiting for him, knowing that if he didnt come today, he was going to come tomorow. He didn't show, so we weren't that disapointed, we knew it might happen. So anyway, lunch ended and we all went back to class. The fire bell was pulled AGAIN, some idiot thinks it's funny. It's not, it's just getting old. Anyways, someone saw my best friend hanging out with my other "friend" Shedevil. I never saw them though, I was playing tag with some people in our class. After school, I went to my friend's locker to wait for her and say goodbye before I cought my bus to go home. My friend came up and told me that my best friend was here. I screamed, and me, her, and another friend ran up to see him. We saw Shedevil in the hall above us. She saw us, and ran away. We ran to her science class, and she had beaten us, and lo and behold, there was my best friend. I screamed, I haven't seen him in a while I was excited. I ran to hug him, cept Shedevil got in the way, shouting, "Don't hug her! She has cooties! No, Lrag, No!" I walked back like, what? and looked at her. I said hi to my friend, and then Shedevil said " Come on Lrag, mom's picking us up to go to my house now." What? I had to leave, I was going to miss my bus. Shedevil ran off with my best friend.  The worst part of it was, my bus was late. I could have run up, and at least talked to him more, and get a hug. But no. The part that bugs me the most though is that she went up to talk to my ex. I'm not sure how, but that REALLY bothered me.  Why I'm so pissed? Shedevil was/is my friend. But she's done this before. I purposelly didnt tell her my friend was coming because I knew she would do this. She always does this. I'm not shocked at all. I'm really just sad that I never got to hang out with my best friend. We're trying to make him come tomorow, but I'm not sure he will. Which makes me madder than hell, because it will be weeks before I see him again - Cadet season is coming up, and almost every weekend involves them leaving for training weekends and such. The next free weekend he'll have, free from cadets (but maybe not from school) is the May long weekend: The weekend I'm in Winnipeg. Happy happy joy joy, I just want to fall off a bridge and DIE.

      It's weird how you think you know someone so well, and they suddenly change into someone else. I love my friends to pieces, no matter what's wrong with them, they are my friends. And maybe that illusion that I have a secret from you is mysterious. When you suddenly realize that they have this other side, cloud, face, whatever, you look at them in a new light. And maybe that's why they never told you that before. Maybe they didn't want you to sympathize with them. Or pity. Or completly disregard them and destroy them, and yourself. This startling discovery that I have made, that everyone has another face, is something I have yet to decide my opinion on. And until I figure out where I stand in this massive world, I'm going to keep treating people the way I have. Loving, kind and respectful - because that's what I want them to treat me.  A few months back I broke up with my boyfriend. We were like, best friends before (Yeah, stupid, I know) and things just progressed higher. But lately I had felt that we were more friends, and things were getting awkward. So we ended it, promising to still be friends. I've never missed him more. I wrote him a bunch of poems that he loved, and said he would keep forever. He gave them back to me. A few of his friends, and his sister (who is my friend as well) were telling me that he didnt want to see me anymore, have anything to do with me in his life. That hurt. To have lost one of my oldest, best male friends like that really hurt. Yesterday, I was following around one of my other friends, and we had to talk to him. And there was an awkwardness between him and me. I think all three of us felt it. I regretted it. I summed up all the courage I had to today and went up to talk to him. I asked him, straight out whether what he had said was true. He denied it. I've known him to lie before, but hearing that from him opened a whole new door of respect and love that I had for him before, as my friend. I went back to his class, to see one of my friends, and he came over to talk with us. He never would have done that if I hadn't of confronted him and asked him that. I'm so proud of myself, I think I'm almost starting to grow up.  With that said, I reply: What?! I don't wanna grow up! I want to be 6...I mean, 16 forever! :P I'm glad though, that I'm starting to "open up to the world and its problems". Biiiiig Woman.

      Warrgg...Lots of my friends have these and whenever I ask them what's up with them they send me a link to their blog. So I figured if everyone else jumped off the cliff, why wasn't I invited. So, here I am. *looks* An epidemic is sweeping my school. Children are all snufling and coughing, and most are out of school completely. I'm dealing with allergies and a lovely head cold, and I can only treat one a day so its been...interesting. This very flu-like cold is reachings its sickly arms to my father, and has completely claimed my brother. He's been sleeping since 3, and its 7 now. Most of my friends are gone, and those who remain are listless and tired.  My cat is dreaming in her sleep again. She sounds like she's eating something.  I'm done. I'm tired. Another migraine is trying to take over, and I want to eat my chicken.

      Oh god... I'm here in semi-gorgeous Vancouver staying with a friend. Except my other friend who I came with is closer. And she just left. There are 4 boys and one girl downstairs, a boy and the girl being a couple. They scare me. I mean, I went to CUC with some of them, and I was with them last night, but downstairs, without Misha is scary. I'm so shy. It was big nerves of me to go out and bloop with them with out her last night. I'm shit. And my stuff is downstairs too.  It's not even like they are even doing anything interesting! They are only playing stupid video/computer games.  Golly, I need more sleep....

      People have been different and expressing themselves as much since the dawn of time. But what comes with expressing yourself can come a horrible disease - the inability to see other people’s point of view.   There are all kinds of different types of music out there for everyone to listen to, and everyone has different tastes in music. But when people are talking about music, and find out that one does not have the same tastes in music, they can lash out, either verbally or physically.  Some people like wearing black clothes. Other like wearing preppy clothes. Some others like a totally different style. People will gang up and destroy the minority’s opinion, and right to express themselves.  The world would be a much better place if everyone was able to look outside their believes and see things the way someone else might. Atheists looking at what Theists believe. Punk rockers seeing the world through a classical eye. But it is a gene, a disease that is almost incurable that destroys some people’s individuality by not seeing why they do what they do.  Critics are open-minded. They have to be. Movies, art shows, exhibits wouldn’t survive without someone reviewing it and giving their thoughts. And if these critics were judgmental and biased in any way, then one might miss an opportunity to see something truly amazing.  If people starting thinking outside of their box, and looking at others, then maybe opinions would be shared and appreciated more, battles wouldn’t need to be fought and everyone would be happier.

      I'm in Vancouver for a few days, visiting friends and all..it's been great fun, and I'm enjoying missing school, and being spoiled. I've also done someone's homework for them. I can't sleep, the migraine put me out today, so I'm wiiiide awake..I'm up to 4 extra strength tylenol to try and stop it. Too bad it isnt working.  I've been hanging out with an old friend, past love lately. And a feeling I thought had gone away looong ago are coming back. And I can almost feel that he feels the same way too. But I'm stuck. Last time, I felt the flame extinguish, and the love die, and we separated. I hated that. I still do. I was such a horrible person, and if this guy reads this, then I'm apologizing. I'm so lost though, as to what to do.   Feelings for a lot of ex-somethings are coming back, and for some reason I'm scrambling to get all my friends back. Maybe I'm getting paranoid again. Maybe I just don't want to be alone. I dont know and I wish I did.   35 days till winnipeg. Maybe I'll be something.  I dont want to grow old alone, I dont want to grow old, end my pain now and gooooo......

      Rawg. I hate life. My best friend has been having girl problems again. His girlfriend doesnt think he loves her enough because he doesn't show much emotion towards her. So she wants to be with someone who does. I personally think she's whacked up. Her boyfriend, my best friend, shows everything. I can tell when he's mad, sad, happy, moody, glum, everything. She just hasn't gotten to know him better yet. It makes me so mad to think that he's been with all these girls that do it all the same to him. He deserves someone who wont hurt him, soemone who knows him like me. Same goes for me too, in fact....  I HATE TV NETWORKS AND KAZAA!!! I really want to watch some Family Matters and Full House, but guess what?! They aren't on the TV! And KaZaA doesn't have them ready for you to download either! :( It's so agrevatinggg!!!

      Ever since I came hoem from Vancouver the world seems to have gone slowly...  In other news, ever tried booking flights before? It's soooo crazy, expensive but convienent on one, takes forever but cheap for another. Right now, on my way to Winnipeg, I stop in Vancouver for an hour, and two in Calgary. I leave Victoria at 9.15. I get there at 13.55 or something. It's soooo maddening! I need all my friends to move to Calgary for a day, and hang out with me in the airport:P  Oh well.   urlLink Photos.   urlLink Blog.   urlLink Site/Poetry.

      Fuck it. No one has the authority to tell me what to do, and have me listen. If I think it's valid, yes, but if it's something I don't see affecting other people, then too bad. He had no right to tell me not to. I am my own person, not his puppet to take control over.

      A look into the past...  A couple of years ago, would make it grade 8, this new guy showed up at my school.(Let's call him Joey.) He was reletively cute, and just happened to be friends with one of my friends, inviting him into our crazy circle. He hung out with us a few times, and all my friends got hung up over how good looking he was in all. I was chasing some other guy, so I really didn't notice. I remember one day, sitting in the library, talking to him, and finding out he used to go to a school some of my friends went too. Apperently he remembers much more about me, like how I'm still the same crazy psycho looney that just wants to have funnn...   So this year, the day before my birthday my best friend took me to a Valentine's Day dance at the cadet hall (My birthday is the 16). Lo and behold, he's there again. Joey is at this dance, looking better than before. On a much needed side note, an ex was at this dance too. He kept staring at me. It was scary. Anyways, Joey just starts looking more and more appealing to me by the second. A slow dance occurs and he and me manage to start dancing. He showers me with compliments, and things from the past. I am shocked. By the end of the night, I am giddy, and swiftly falling for this guy.   Some how he gets my email and we converse. He is very humerous. I enjoy talking to him. A qurk he might have though, is that he isn't fond of commitment. I understand, but do not hear from him in a while. Finally, I see him online the other night, and freak riiiight out at him. I hurt him. A lot.  He calls me today, and apologizes for being an ass. I apologize for freaking out. We talk about all the lovely sexual things...commitment, sex, what is sexy, lies, etc etc...The only thing is, I manage to put across that I am still, magically, a virgen (Some people see my outgoingness and everything else and freak out when I say I'm still a virgen cause I don't act like it.) But I don't think he really sees the reason why I am. It's not like I'm saving it for marriage, or for that "special someone"...It's like I'm just waiting for someone who matters a bit to me, that wont screw and run, and that like..I don't know. My head is swimming with emotions and I don't even know if I'm ready for that next big step in life...I wasn't ready for the first step...

      Say you love to do something so much, and let's say that's writing and English class. You believe you are soo good, everyone else says your good. You blow you english teacher away last year with your talent, and she says you'd better be planning on taking honors for the rest of your years, its a waste of talent otherwise.  Next year comes around, and you walk into your new, english honors class. You dont feel as smart as everyone else, but the teacher still encourages you and you try your best. You get the lowest grade in the class, and later, in the mail you get a letter saying "Sorry, but we regret to inform you that you are not accepted into honors next year." Suddenly you doubt your great ability to write, and then everything else..Are you really that talented? Are you really that pretty? Smart? Funny?  Funny how one letter for english can change your entire outlook on life. Liam, I still love you, even if you don't know whether you still love me.

      I hate people. Why? They have mouths. Some how any/everything I do, say, and think comes back to haunt me. I tell people about my life. They tell me about theres. It's a fair exchange. Its not fair when they go ahead and tell the entire school what I did. So now, I just wont tell anyone anything. Let them guess. I'm tired of the world knowing about my life.  Except on this blog, of course.  And yes Lyndon, I posted your name and it is there. And hey...aren't you going out with someone? (if not, why isnt it meeee!:P)

      Well. Back I am.  It's been a rough few weeks, mood swinging wildly. There was that whole Liam and pot thing (which has yet to be resovled -_-), Sean and his...self coming over(I'm still recovering from that, and no, surpirsingly nothing sexual happened..oO) and now this thing with my ex.   Sean has convinced me that the no-commitment lifestyle is grand. Looking at it, I have to agree. You can be with whoever you want as your mood sees fit. You aren't tied down to one person and their needs.   I was out yesterday with my ex, who I still kinda like. We were fooling around in the basement, and had fun, and well..yeah:P That was something I want to do. Be free like that. Knowing today, or tomorw, I can grab a random person, make out with them, and not make my ex mad. How great is that? I can play in the field until I find what I like. And that's what I really want to do.  I'm almost afraid he feels other, though. But I'll just explain to him that I am not in a place in my life where I want to be tied down. If I enjoyed it so much, then I would still be with someone.   In much other news, 9 (NINE!) days until Winnipeg and friends!!! I am soooooooooo not going to sleep!:P I'm so excited, I could almsot cry:) I can feel the hugs already. :D

      I'm actaully starting to feel something inside me now: that I might not have my best friend forever. He's been acting rather moody lately, and its been weeks since I've have a real conversation with him. Ever since I told him I had smoked pot, he wont talk to me. And even though he forgave me the other day, he still isn't the same fun loving Liam I know and love...He's different. First, he replys on MSN. You have to wait half a century, or threaten to leave to get him talking for a bit. Then he gets all moody when you call him on it. He won't answer the phone. And since we live no where near each other, and I'm going away the next 2 weeks, I won't be able to talk to him until the end of the month.  He claims he tried to kill himself on Friday, and that I should thank Kat that she stopped him. Well, I'm not even sure that I would have minded at this point...He's not the guy I used to know and love sooo much at all. I've deleted him off my list until I feel better about talking to him, or until he can grow up and tell me what he's feeling, like before, so I know and can help him...until then.

      Mwauaua...I'm at school, steaming after the new bell schedule for the rest of the year 8-1, ten min break after 2 clases...that's it. Why? Parklands burned to the ground. That's another school in our district, and now, they have to come to school with us until they re-build it. Worse for them: they go from 1.30-6.30...I'm still rather grouchy about this.  Skipped 3 block, to tired to go to math and learn. If I close my eyes for more than one minute, I sleep. It's getting kinda bad. Me and Misha went down to the thrift store, got some ties for Spring Con (Yeah Laurel!:P I have my tie! Onward to find chalice!) some books, and toys...of course:) Can't wait til I get my Winnipeg photos back, I forgot to tell mom to take them in today, so I'm hoping she might do one-hour-photo on them *hoping hoping hopiiing!*  It's funny, my watch is still on Winnipeg time, and everyone is asking me what time it is: Oh, it's 2.54 (them:) No it's not! Me: oh, then you DO know the time,.....:P It's been quite evil and most entertaining.... I want to go hunt people. I'll venture on tonniiiight...

      Oh my me oh sigh....  Life. Coming back into the real world is hard, especially when you've just spent an intensive close weekend with some of the best people in the world. It's so hard to leave them, and when you do, the world seems foreign....strange..unchanged. The harsh realism of cruelty, inequality, and injustice between people, places and things. It's almost, to say icky, and you need a break from it all..one day with you family, one day with friends, then the world..you can't just jump into it all and expect to understand everything like before..  Memories stand out from my head and explode onto the screen...First being my adventure on a plane. I've never flown before in my life. In fact I've never left the province. I've lived a rather shetlered life here on the island, and I'm exploring it fro the first time...  Damn, I'm so tired, I'm still on Pig/Flatatoba time, so I need to go to bed...get back to normal...

      It was hard to leave him, even if it was just fo breakfast. You had to have all these goodbye kisses, even if you were only going to 15 minutes. They only way I managed to get out before was because Samaya walked by and said she'd breakfast with me. We spent the weekend in each other's company, sight, arms. It was almsot like slow death when I had died my hair and we coulnd't kiss for fear of dying his beloved jersey. Finally, I went mad and washed it out before it was done, just so I could be near him. We colided together and kissed, and kissed. We danced that night, and watched Saved by the Bell together (with Dougie, who is very hot, by the way). Leaving was the hardest thing ever. We kissed goodbye, and with a wave, he was gone. No idea when I'd see him again. If I ever would.  Samaya was the other great thing there. After the stressof the non-meetings, and gonig from my room, on the 6th floor, to another building, for nothing I started to freak out. And she took me aside, and calmed me down, and talked me back into reality. When I left, I couldn't go without a hug from her, and as tears were running down my face in the sadness of leaving, like always, I thought of what a truelly great person she was. How she keeps everyone together. And with a kiss goodbye, she, and I, were gone.  I honestly can not wait for Fall Con in the fall, or the Advisor training in Sept, or the Regional Con and LDC in November. I can't wait to see everyone, to be with everyone, to experience this great love you get. I miss everyone. All I have are the pictures, and the thoughts in my head.

      This weekend was magic. More magical that most con's I've been too, and maybe because of all the locals that were there. Or the sheer size and love of it. Or that there was no thirteen year olds. Or because maybe I had my con fling... That was magic. My youth group had just arrived at the site, and we were trying to find out rooms and where everyone was. We were talking about a guy, the K in my new nickname, KFC, and suddenly he appears behind us. We went to one of the rooms, to hang out, and decide that's where everyone was gonig to sleep, and everyone was talkgni about where the mattresses were going to lie. I didn't want to be bothered to try and move mine, so I said I'll sleep on the floor or something. I sat on one of the beds beside K, and started talking, slowly leaning into him because I didnt want to have to sit up straight. The bed thing came up again, and I said I didnt want to sleep on the floor anymore and K said I'll just have to sleep with him on the bed. I had no problem with that, it's fun to sleep with a guy in the same bed, and I didn't think we wold have much sleeping anyways.  Friday night reigned on, and we explored the site, got to know where everyone and everything was, touch groups (that we still got lost finding) orientation, the usual. Late for worship, was sad about that because worship is fairly important. Went back the room, started to almost snuggle with K. Just get comfortable with everyone in the room, we get called out because someone has already broken community, the rules, by smoknig pot in their room....Not too cool. Everyone gets up and goes for a walk, and we steal a lugagge cart and start pushing people around. I break away from the group with him, and we go walking around the campus. We hit were another group was, out having a stroll with a smoke, K bums a smoke (but never smokes it himself) and we talk about this guy wanting to be a unitarian. We walk off, and go find this stairwell, and sit in it. Not talking, just hudled close together, keeping each other warm, waiting for something. My heart starts to rapidly poubd in my chest, I feel like its about to explode in pieces everywhere. Finally, after what could be hours, days, months, years, he reaches over and kisses me..Softly and gentle at first, then powerful and strong, unleashing power and lust caught up for ever...

      I'm sad. Ever get that feeling? Where you've just spent an AMaZING amount of time with someone, being with them all the time, hugging, kissing, walking, talking, dancing, sleeping, holding each other, even just plain sitting together. And you have to leave them. And you get this little empty feeling inside of you, not for that person, but for that feeling, that knowledge that you just have to reach out, and they'll be there, for that kiss, for that hug, for that little laugh you share.. It's horrible. And no one else understands, feels the same way you do. Everyone stares at you like your crazy, not ever knowing that feeling themselves.

      I am angered. I did this horrible, stupid essay on the north west mounted police, and I'm short resources (not to mention the stupid essay is too short). So after I write the essay, I hop on Britannica, just to get a resouce and claim I used it. Do it all the time. Makes you look important when you have all these resources you NEVER USED. So I get a link, and read what Britannica offered me, jsut to make sure it was relevant. THE WHOLE FREAKING thing is filled with stuf I a) Didnt use and b) didnt know happened! And if I wasn't so DAMN lazy, tired, mad and pressed for time beacuse I have other work, I would re-write it! THAT'S how good that freaking article was.  And if that essay gets a lower mark, so help me god I am going to hack into the computers at school and change my mark to an A++++. I FREAKING deserve it.

      *DADDY'S TEN RULES OF DATING*   Rule One:   If you pull into my driveway and honk you'd better be delivering a package, because you're sure not picking anything up.    Rule Two:   You do not touch my daughter in front of me. You may glance at her, so long as you do not peer at anything below her neck. If you cannot keep your eyes or hands off of my daughter's body, I will remove them.    Rule Three:   I am aware that it is considered fashionable for boys of your age to wear their trousers so loosely that they appear to be falling off their hips. Please don't take this as an insult, but you and all of your friends are complete idiots. Still, I want to be fair and open minded about this issue, so I propose this compromise: You may come to the door with your underwear showing and your pants ten sizes to big, and I will not object. However, in order to ensure that your clothes do not, in fact come off during the course of you date with my daughter, I will take my electric nail gun and fasten your trousers securely in place to your waist.     Rule Four:   I'm sure you've been told that in today's world, sex without utilizing a "Barrier method" of some kind can kill you. Let me elaborate, when it comes to sex, I am the barrier, and I will kill you.    Rule Five:   It is usually understood that in order for us to get to know each other, we should talk about sports, politics, and other issues of the day. Please do not do this. The only information I require from you is an indication of when you expect to have my daughter safely back at my house, and the only word I need from you on this subject is: "early"    Rule Six:   I have no doubt you are a popular fellow, with many opportunities to date other girls. This is fine with me as long as it is okay with my daughter. Otherwise, once you have gone out with my little girl, you will continue to date no one but her until she is finished with you. If you make her cry, I will make you cry.    Rule Seven:   As you stand in my front hallway, waiting for my daughter to appear, and more than an hour goes by, do not sigh and fidget. If you want to be on time for the movie, you should not be dating. My daughter is putting on her makeup, a process than can take longer than painting the Golden Gate Bridge. Instead of just standing there, why don't you do something useful, like changing the oil in my car?    Rule Eight:   The following places are not appropriate for a date with my daughter: Places where there are beds, sofas, or anything softer than a wooden stool. Places where there is darkness. Places where there is dancing, holding hands, or happiness. Places where the ambient temperature is warm enough to introduce my daughter to wear shorts, tank tops, midriff T-shirts, or anything other than overalls, a sweater, and a goose down parka -- zipped up to her throat. Movies with a strong romantic or sexual theme are to be avoided; movies which features chain saws are okay. Hockey games are okay. Old folks homes are better.    Rule Nine:   Do not lie to me. I may appear to be a potbellied, balding, middle-aged, dimwitted has-been. But on issues relating to my daughter, I am the all-knowing, merciless God of your universe. If I ask you where you are going and with whom, you have one chance to tell me the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I have a shotgun, a shovel, and five acres behind the house. Do not trifle with me.    Rule Ten:   Be afraid. Be very afraid. It takes very little for me to mistake the sound of your car in the driveway for a chopper coming in over a rice paddy near Hanoi. When my Agent Orange starts acting up, the voices in my head frequently tell me to clean the guns as I wait for you to bring my daughter home. As soon as you pull into the driveways you should exit the car with both hands in plain sight. Speak the perimeter password, announce in a clear voice that you have brought my daughter home safely and early, then return to your car -- there is no need for you to come inside. The camouflaged face at the window is mine.

      Notice a lack of me? You should. Because I'm sick. Again. And the doctors aren't even sure. They are convinced its strep throap, but the lab tests say its not, prolly tonsilitis, AGAIN. In anycase, I feel like shit, one side of my face is swollen, and I dont wanna move. And what really sucks? School ends on the 17, so now I'm prolly going to fail some classes...> Joy.  The best thing is, I get my lab tests back today...Maybe I have mono instead...wont THAT be fun...  Yes, I'm bitter, and there is no point in pointing that out to me.

      This has been a rough few days...  First my friend tells me he was attacked walking home from school, and had some really nasty shit happen to him. All from walking home. Its sad we live in a world that you can't even walk home from school without being attacked. Right now I just want to hop on my bike and ride to his house, except he lives in another provence, and I'm too lazy to go that far. My thoughts and hugs are with you hun, you know who you are.  Then my so called best friend, who now no longer is, decides, out of nowhere, to tell everyone she knows that I am lesbien. No I am not, its a lie, but she's trying to tell people that I am. I only found out because of a guy I liked asking me if it's true, because he was saddened to find out. Great. I confronted her with it, tell her she's an ass, and I never want to speak with her agian because I'm TIRED of her shit..and she claims it was only a JOKE! And that no one was supposed to take it seriously! Well, come on! You need to assume everyone will take things seriosuly, specially if you tell them in a serious voice telling them, NO JOKE! GRWAH! I'm very angered that I've wasted so much time into this stupid friendship to have her betray me, again, like this. I'm sick of it. Too bad for her, this time I won't listen when she calls me up, crying asking for forgiveness. Too fucking bad. You should have thoguht of that before I "became" a lesbien.  God, I'm tired of this world...I almost have to wonder why I keep on living?

      Wee...here I am. First: ArHGH!!!!Why do I bother telling people my dreams when they go and blackmail me with them? DAMN YOU JOSIE...gwah.  Second: It's summer!!! I've passed my classes, and done JACK ALL so far. Wee!! Actaully, that's a lie. I've been busy planning conferences. I'm planning two so far, one in November, and one in February (one day before my birthday!:P) and I'm wanting a third, for the summer of 2004. That is, if Sanford ever replies to his email which I DID send him! It's pretty fun, and having been to a few cons now I know what makes a con sucessful, which helps. It also makes me respect people who plan them lots. There is a LOT of work...I mean, it can take days just to think up a THEME....Ours, for our feb con, is love...And the con is over Valentine's day. It works out sooo nicely..I cant wait. Speaking of cons, I found out that Fall con was teh same weekend that our LDC is. Oh goody. I alert my planning crew, also my YAC, and it gets moved to November. Yay! So far, there is a Con in October, November, February, spring con in april or may, AGM in May, and Alaska Con, and ConCon, and GA, if we fell bold enough to go. That's a lot of cons. I dont know if we'll be able to attend them all, and I'm getting very concerned because my youth group is all keyed up to go to the American Cons, and not our AGM....which means no money for our airfare or anything for AGM..which means..no trip to calgary (I'm still working my mom on that) and no erin, alex, san or gavin...and I misssss themm!!! *pouts* I must start my super human powers and fix that.  Third: My life right now consists of sleeping, eating, playing Roller Coaster Tycoon, email and swimming. The other day at the lake I found an abandoned air mattress, and took it home with me. I blew it up, and discovered no holes at all. I rejoiced. Today, I took it out on the water and swan around. It's so gross, the weeds come right up to the surface of the water, and it never used to, but it's so intrancing. Certain weeds look like evergreens under water. Abadoned christmas trees. Fish swim in and out, fish I only thought swam close to shore. I was wrong. The water is a very dark and mysterious place....And now that I've looked so closely at it, I suddenly don't want to go past my head in water again.....  Fourth: LAURA! WE NEED TO PLAN DISNEY DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WEE!!!!!!!!!1  That is all, love to you all, til next time.

      Wow. I never really realized how hard it was to tell someone you like them. I did though, last night, and well, the night before. Bob knows who he is. And I think I'm going to continue calling him that, cause I think it makes him feel special. (Hey Bob, take care of my soul, will ya? Don't let it go through the wash, i dont want it to drown:P) Rob heh, he knows. And that was interesting.  he asked me what we should do about it. I panicked. I never gave that thought...I was only thinking about youth group and the whiskey (wee), not the future...And there's so many little things to worry about...Classes and youth group, and everything.. I'm glad I get until friday to think about this, he does too. We agreed.

      I dreamed again.   This time, me and Bob were at a meeting or something, and we were fooling around, cuddling, and stuff. I remember how well I fitted into the crook of his arm, and how giggly we were. And I kissed his cheek. And he kissed mine, and back and forth. And finally, I kissed him on his mouth, with the amount and passion you would have for a boyfriend, or girlfriend, or whatever. And looked at me, with this, air of, shock, surprise, I don't know. And I told him if I was getting out of hand to slap me or something, and then we stood up, and walked out, into this room that was his bedroom. And we made out. For hours. And his "sisters" (he doesn't have any in real life, I think) were walking in and out of the room, and we never stopped. Never.  This is starting to get to be like an obsession. And I have to get it under control, before I freak out. Control. Calm. Easy. Stop. Help.

      I've had dreams, very vivid dreams about two people lately, and I know there is some major heartfelt feelings there, for both of them.   One, Bob* I've known for a few years. He is the best guy ever. He is so cute, so adorable, and funny, and I know he loves me just as much as I do, but in a much different way. We have the best time together, when we are together. And even though I know I have never kissed him, I know what it would be like, electrifying, passions soaring, most indepth and complex. His touch can send me through the roof. I try and imagine the next time I see him, how insanely wonderful it will be and it's impoosible. And I know, no matter what, even if I told him how I felt, he woud never ever ever feel the same way, because our differences are so..well....it wont happen. Unless he changes. That sounds selfish, but if you knew who I was talking about, you would understand exactly where I might be coming from.  The other, Rob*, is someone I know in the neighboorhood area. In fact, I wrote about him yesterday. And our interests are so different, no one would ever see our union coming. A friend of mine has pried out that he does like someone from youth group...So I'm not out of the ruling. And how forbidden it would look. Our interests are so varied, we have no school friends in common, just con friends, and no one, not even our parents would see it. I've known him since kindergarten, and I've liked him since around grade 3/4...I used to have this magazine picture of the Yellow Power Ranger on my dresser, where I could see it ever night, and I wrote his name on it, with hearts...He wasn't my first crush, no that was in grade 2 or 3..I can hardly remember.   Sean, I've tried. And I've learned this one major fact, the one fact that I know means I will never be with you. You like running free, having the pick of the litter, or whoever is at your recent disposal, and not having to worry about cheating. That's great, worthwhile, fun for a while. The difference between me and you, is that I need someone. Even if I have the running wild for a while, I need a guy to fall back on at the end of the day and say everything I want to hear, and mean it, not saying it just cause it'll make me happy. I need the commitment. And it lets me live. I mean, at least when I am grown up, sure, I might not have had all the free range fun you've had, but I've experienced the heart break. And I'll get out, and be with guys, and yes, I'll be hurt, but I'll know what it's like, and be prepared. You have never been hurt like that in your life, and I know that when you get out, it'll be harder for you. Women have names for people like you, people who fuck and run. They're called players. And they don't get far. It will be sad to see you down in the dumps, loking for a lay while I'm getting it all, the love and the warmth. And you'll never experience the happy warmth that someone can give you, someone you are going out with. It'll be a new feeling for you. And maybe you'll react to it in a horrible way. Time will tell. I know now, that after posting this, you'll read it and IM me, demanding reasoning, and trying to convince me how you think, and you take on it all, trying to convice me that I'm wrong. Get used to it, sometimes you are. And then you try and explain yourself over the phone, with your reasoning that you cant express yourself fully on the net. That's a lie. Anything you say on the net, is what you say on the phone. It's the same. Just you can say it faster, and if I hang up on you, you can call back. It's hard.  I'm not even sure now if I want to talk to you. It takes me a while, a long while, to realize the emotional pain, and abuse I've been in. Hell, last summer I was a mess, what with the situation with Evan and Will on top of each other, and the added sterss of parents. And I get to realize now, the controlling feeling. And I'm getting it from you. And your "critical eye". Start apologizing guy, cause you hurt my feelings. A lot. And you turned me into the person that'll do anything for a shot at you. Your comments, when you were at my house, about my weight, or anything related, hurt, and I felt that if I changed that, I would get you. And I started. I lost nearly 30 pounds, thanks. Very unhealthy. I gained it mostly back, and when I got sick, stayed at the normal level. And according to the height and weight/obeseity chart in my doctor's office, I'm at a very normal size. So go away, screw you, stop planting the weeds of controling. I've gardened, and threw you in the compost. Bottom line. Have fun with you life, and if you do make it out, and last to be something, and not a bum on the street wonderign where your next lay will be, call me. I wanna know what it was like going through the stages where you realized being a player wasn't going to make it. I'll be in the psychology office, being a shink, doing what I love, and analizing.     *names have been changed to respect my pride

      Life isnt going to great.  First, well, i kinda like this guy I know. And he's really funny, and adorable, and I've known him forever...He's going to be in some of my classes next year, and he's in my TA. So I see a fair amount of him, and he's in my youth group. I like him. And one of my friends today asked him if he liked her, saying she liked him. She knows how I feels, and he says, Yeah, I do like you.   Ouch. That hurts.  Nothing I'm not used to though, just a major step backwards.  A propane truck ran into a telephone poll today. Could have been nearly killed, nothing major. Made me realize how much we depend on technology. My house was without barbeque, or any source of hot food. For lunch, I had ham, crackers, peanut butter and instant pudding. For supper, cold beans out of a can, dry cereal and instant pudding. Looking at that, having to find new ways to entertain myself besides the computer and tv, and microwave, I had to read. And I tinkered around with my discman (Seems that beating it to the ground didn't fix it), and played Pokemon on my ancheint gameboy. It was fun.   Was at a dinner party thing last night. Spent a fun tiem doing my hair, and looked really smart. Almost everyone there thought I was going into university or college. At church earlier that morning, a few more. And throuout the course of the year. I'm frightened..I was told I looked and acted and dressed younger than I am, but yet people think I'm a college kid. Does that mean, if I tried to look smart that I would be in my late twenties?!  My camera works again. Apperntly there are like, 2 differennt kinds of USB ports on my computer: One 1.1 and one 2.0. That's great, cause it's a webcam too, so now, not only does my camera work, but I have a webcam. Joys!

      Damnnn...So far, Cascadia is going to cost almost $200 US per person...it's almost $100 for food, and then we have anywhere from $30 to $80 for a room, plus misc costs....If we cant grab a subsidy from somewhere, then this is going to be horribly attended, and that's a shame, because Victoria is such a great location. Damn Empress being so much...:(

      Ouch... I went camping last night in my friend's backyard with a bunch of giiiirls..Although it was monstious fun, i was sharing an air mattress with my friend. huge thing, double, or queen or something. But it was slowly losing air, and we didn't know how. And when we woke up in the morning, there was no air at all. And now my back is all stiff, there's a muscle pulled in there and my shoulder acccche...I'm sucker to a good masage right now, but there's no one around. It's sad. So I am.  But I have the best tan..I'm so brown...rawr...break out the white shirts baby.

      If you're not the one then why does my soul feel glad today? If you're not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way? If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all  I never know what the future brings but I know you're here with me now We'll make it through and I hope you are the one I share my life with...  I don't wanna run away but I can't take it, I don't understand If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am? Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?  If I don't need you then why am I crying on my bed? If I don't need you then why does your name resound in my head? If you're not for me then why does this distance maim my life? If you're not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife?  I don't know why you're so far away But I know that this much is true We'll make it through And I hope you are the one I share my life with And I wish that you could be the one I die with And I pray in you're the one I build my home with I hope I love you all my life  I don't wanna run away but I can't take it , I don't understand If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am? Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?  'Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today 'Cause I love you, whether it's wrong or right And though I can't be with you tonight You know my heart is by your side  I don't wanna run away but I can't take it, I dont understand If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am? Is there any way I can stay in your arms?

      And now for something I stole out of Bob's journal: My chapstick has dissapeared. It's odd, like that. One day, i'll have eight little roll things, and the day after i'll have two melted packages in my pocket and the other six are backpacking across the world to china.  I love that kid:P

      My face hurts from smiling too much.  I have a date! On saturday! And I've haven't stopped smiling since! Maybe that's why I have a headache.  All my friends are saying I'm so lucky, after you blurt out to someone that you like them, usually they don't like you back. Usually they haven't been attracted to you since god knows when. And when you've kinda liked them since, EVER! (Well, not ever, but elementary school) it's rare thatthey would like you back. All my friends go, awwww!, whenever I mention them, and I have a huuuge smile plastered on my face.   I guess this summer is, for sure, going to be better than last year. For sure. And I'm glad.  After the depressing events from that, I felt I had to improve for this summer. And I almost didn't make it, because I lost a friend (serves him right anyways), and another one of mine is gone for most of the summer, and BOB AND JANE WON'T WRiTE ME BACK. Some kind of problem with their arms, I'm thinking. :D   My ass feels like it's still sitting on my air matteress. Which is SUCH a cool feeling...I love it:)

      I fell down the stairs yesterday carring a bowl of rice crispies and a glass of chocolate milk. I fell, slipped down half of the stairs, and didn't spill one drop of milk. Genius, ain't it?  Went to the Commenwelth with Lannie and Tyler last night. I saw faces from my past...Rite, from my old church. She's going to be gonig to my school in Sept, so I get to see her more. Avril, someone I've known for eeever and ever. Since I was in grade 4 maybe? She's one of my oldest friends, and it was so great seeing her again. Memories around...This year, no matter how busy and flustered I will be, will prolly be one of the best. It has to be the best.  My friends are now either in grade 9-12. This will be my last year with some of my older friends, before they go running off to the real world and leave me here. It's a scary year. Lots of pain, but I'll survive. I need a yearbook this year.  The worst has happened, as I thought life was getting perfect. That was a lie. I fell for Thomas, and I thought everything was going to be alright, I was gonan do this, and make myself proud. Now, especially after talking to him last night, I find myself wanting to be with this other guy. He's decided he's going to be single this week, and what do you know! Tom's gone too for this week. It's too horrible to think of...So I present the problem to my audience: If I'm only just dating Tom, and it hasn't even presented itself as a boyfriend/girlfriend mix (and I haven't asked him to be sure), would it be wrong to fool around with another guy?

      Life right now is mellow, and that's all I have to say.  I've been crashing at Alanna's for a few, and we've only been up to no good. As usual. Went to Durrance lake at like, 10 last night. It was an adventure. I can honestly say I have never been swimming at night, and never been skinny dipping either. Muchos fun was had, and I enjoyed it. Talking to the guy I like last night too, and he was wasted off his ass. I never realized how annoying it is talking to someone who is drunk, when you are not drunk. Not fun. And he gets to go away for a week. But hey! It gives me a chance to live my life the way I wanna, and go crazy, and I'm not going to pine for him. I'm going to break my crazy clingy ways. See what happens with this guy, and if it works out (With me, I dont think so.) then wow! I know what's wrong. Amazing.  Relationships never really work out for more than a month for me. It's crazy. I've gone out with practically half of Victoria, at least more than most people my age. It's kinda scary, when you think about it. And none of them has lasted longer than 3 months. I'd really like it if one of these times I could have a relationship that lasted, that meant something to me, that I truelly loved, and not the fake feelings of longing I've had before.  I don't actaully think I've been in love before. I think its just the feeling of longing that has taken over my mind and heart, and tricking me into believing its real. Or maybe I have been. Maybe that pain I had last summer was love. Cause man oh man, i don't ever wanna feel like that again.  I really really hope that this one turns out. Cause man, life would be so awesome.  Power to you Jess for speaking your mind out. Hope it went well tonite. Email me and give me full details giiirl!:) And Sanford, go look at the pics I found for you. You'll enjoy them...  Have fun at Seabeck Tom! Even though I highly doubt you read this, there's a chance you might. Have fun, don't get too wild, and say hi to anyone who knows me (like they will). Get some hints on handling the ladies too, if master PLaYa Kelty is gonna be there...:P Gotta love that Kelty. Oh man.   Loves you all later.

      I was on my way to see Thomas today, in the sweltering heat, and I saw a mommy dear and her two babies crossing the road. A few minutes later all the horses in the field beside me ran to the fence. When I got over to where they were looking, I could see that they were looking at the dear - free in the fields, not confined to a fence and able to run free. They got to the corner of the fence, and if they tried hard enough, they might have broken through.   I went rowing with Clare today. Always an adventure with her. I got to sit in the coach boat, and I saw my favourite lake from a brand new perspective. It's quite beautiful, and one day I'd love to rent a kayak and go off exploring. Lots of weeds, but swimming in them wasn't all that bad. Clare and me discovered the clay beds and covered ourselves in it. It was quite gross, but lots of fun. After we ran to the rowing building and had a shower. We cheated:)  I'm quite tired, very hot, and very concerned for my appetite. It's leaving. I can hardly eat anything without getting full. But don't worry, all you people who don't read this, the times I do eat, I try and eat only veggies and protein. I'm barely eating one and a half meals. Not too good.  I want to go back and watch Pirates of the Carribean and Finding Nemo. So far, those are the best movies I have seen this year. I also want to go camping. Really bad. The only thing, is that the camping trip that is confirmed and everything is in September. So far away, and it won't be warm enough to go swimming and push people in. I guess after the sunday youth meeting in Augest we'll have to go off to some lake and go swimming. Durrance is very close to the church. We could go there....  I'm almost regretting youth group on the 15 of August. Sure I love it, and I get to see all my rabid and crazy friends from there, but it's the one place I have to hide what I feel for Tom from everyone else. It was so hard at the last meeting, it's just going to be plain cruel now. But now that my brother knows, there is no guarentee that he will keep his mouth shut. No matter how hard I threaten. Only time will tell, and man..I dunno. It's nice, or was nice, not having our parents know, and even though mine know, it isn't all that bad. But then, not hiding it can't be worse off. I mean....Then we don't have to hide. Like some people in the closet. It's like we're stuck in our own little unique closet....  Sanford, I miss you, and I'll find some suitable pictures and put them in a folder in my Yahoo photos...The addy is at the top, and I'll clearly label them so you'll know. Hope you're having fun in Michigan or whatever.

      He kissed me today.  And I enjoyed it. Now I find myself plotting to see him before he goes. One last kiss...   And my parents were tellling me what an upstanding, good choice of a guy I have now. Only slightly unnerving and embarassing. I hate it when they aprove of people I like.

      Oh man, love is the hardest thing sometimes.  Trying to get out on Saturday was interesting, to say the least. Told my mom I was going out downtown to hang out with friends, and she jus tlooked at me with that look that said: Yeah right. What are you REALLY doing? Great. So after a good 3 hour long battle which induced muchos tears and stress and anger and other "fun" things, I finally ran out of the house, with mom shouting after me "This is a BIG DEAL you know!" Why is it big? I go downtown all the time...Just now that it's with a guy? Try and cross the highway, man that is...fun...*note sarcasm* Managed to stay alive, get down to the bus stop, met up with Tom. Talked, saw a friend, and talked with him till his bus came then got on ours. Walked around, got some tickets for Pirates of the Carribean, had dinner and walked around. I knew I wanted to go down to Beacon Hill, I love it there, why the hell not! I found out today that it was the lantern festival...Damn that would have been fun.  Walked in the mall til it closed...6pm..rather early, but whatever. Saw the movie. Oh man. Oh man. OH MAN. That movie is sooooo good. Almost as good as Finding Nemo:P Nothing will compare that this year. But very good. Good acting. Good plot. Excellent animation.  So freaking cold in the theaters. I was soooo cold, my hands were turning into icecicles slowly.  Left. Called the parents. Oh lordy. I guess they don't understand the meaning of not telling the WORLD so I spent way too long trying to convince them not to call anyone, and to stay home till I was off the bus. Ran into some people I'd rather avoid. Like my ex-best friend. Lovely. They were acting like such immature goons on the bus, one would think that they were high, or drunk, or both, if you didn't know them. Was "lucky" and got a bus driver new to the route. Even though Tom told him where to go, he STILL missed the road, then later got the bus stuck on a hill and had to let us off there...Damn good thing I had a flashlight, cause otherwise we would be going up a huge hill with out lighting. Brilliant.   Oh and for you weirdos interested, and I know there's a few of you....No. There was no kiss. I can't remember though if we hugged or not...Totally has flown from my mind. Weird, huh?  When I finally got home I talked to my parents about the need of not telling the world, because of our reasons. Then I talked to my brother, and went to bed. I was soooo tired, I was almost asleep as I hit the pillow...with the sweet sounds of Lifehouse in the background.  It was hard today, being near him and having to act cool. Sitting beside his dad and trying to contain myself. It hurts.  I kinda wanna kiss him, extremely bad. And I know he reads this, but it isn't going to stop me. I want him near me, holding me, kissing me...It hurts..  Heart heart. It aches for you. Pines for you. Would even die to see you again....

      Rawr...That was interesting and a half.  Instead of playing pool, 9 of us (I counted 7 but something was wrong:P) went down to Durrance to go swimming. We swam off the log, and goofed off, and had lots of fun. We all stood on the log, and took turns jumping off and staying down..At the tip of the tree, I couldn't even touch (until James moved down) then when everyone jumped off, suddenly the water was around my ankles. It was frighteneing. Adam or James or Shea took off Alanna's top and played catch for a bit. I double knotted my suit, and I think Amy did too...  Then we left! James and Adam and Amy went home, did their own little thing. Cody dropped me and Alanna off. We got dressed, brushed hair, applied make up, comented that Cody was a DREAM he was so hot...:) I enjoyed that. Cody was hot. He had a niiiice ass truck. He likes Techno. In fact, we listened to Da Rude the entire time we were in that truck. W00tage.   Cody and Aaron came back to pick us up, then we went to go get Sheila and Shea, then headed off down to A&W. Ate some food. Good food. Yummy. Went down to peacocks, (oh, and I had shotgunned like, the entire time by now, much to Alanna's displeasure) saw that nobody we wanted was there, and left. Played the "N" snatching game..:)  In case you've never played, that game is where you see a car with an N on its back, and the car is parked, you take the N. It's soo fun, and I think Cody has like, 30 or something, of N's. That they have snatched. It was perfect. That is also why, when you get out of your car, you take off your N.  We drove down to the waterfront and walked around. I scored holding Cody's hand, even though Alanna did too. But it was most fun. My parents called. Fed them some lies so they wouldnt come panicking past me. Got back to holding Cody's hand again. Rawr..That was ....lovely:) Friends were really cool, just helped me along, and didn't say anything like, What the hell! We are not! Really nice of them.   Cody dropped me off. Dad was waiting outside for me. 1000 questions. I went to bed. Woke up way too early this morning to pick berries, and now apprently, I never picked enough...*is sad*  Man, if Thomas reads this, I have some explaining to do....Hopefully he wont...Right? RIGHT?!

      I have 3d glasses on my head. It's wild.  I was biking last night around Mattick's Farm, going home, when suddenly I hear a crackling in the trees above me, like something is coming down. Suddenly this golf ball drops out of nowhere and goes right in front of my bike, then THROUGH the wheels and in front again. It was the scariest thing, knowing that I almost was KILLED or at least seriously injured by this thing. I took the golf ball, that freaking psycho ain't getting it back so he can take me out again! And I'm never biking that trail again, for my safety.  I made some bracelets out of my starburst wrappers. That was fun. They are so bright and colorful.   Going to play pool with people tonight, fun fun.  Can't wait til Sat, only two more days...And Laura's home! A week early! Yay!!!! *sniffles* I really missed her too:P

      I don't know why it bothers me so much, but there is no bread in my bread drawer. There is cheese. Cabbage. And even some fruit. But no bread.  Isnt there a cheese, cabbage and fruit drawer? Then why doesnt it go live there? Huh? Huh? I need to go find some bread....Maybe I'll find it in the meat drawer. Or in the cereal cabinet...  I just had a fight with someone over the size of a freaking mountain. Now, to prove I'm right, I need someone smart to tell me where the highest point in victoria is, not just saanichton, but victoria, and where the hell Mt.  Newton is, cause seriously, the Newton I'm thinking of is a Calgary mountain! A mole hill!  Oh jeez....Where is my man to restore my sanity?

      I've rediscovered a game of mine to occupy me when Mom kicks me off the computer and I have nothing to do. Roller Coaster Tycoon. Oh man....It's super addciting, and I'm really close to getting new levels and everything....It's rather sad how excited I get over it. I've also been looking at my clothes and colors laterly, and I'm either turning into a prep, or a punk. I'm scared. I dunno why, but I just am.  Made mom a list for stuff I need back to school....Clothes are on that list, so hopefully I'll gain a bucket load of nice new things. I need them, after all. I only have about 5 shirts I can wear in the winter, and that's way too little.   Also need a job so that I can set aside money for Seabeck next year, and my travels to calgary. A real job mind you, childcare isnt going to far. Unfortuantly.   Blech! Must..play....tycooooooon!

      That's right. Last night was the best youth night I have ever been too, honestly. Max, Luke, Ian, and Steve came, and it was the first time we had more of the older youth than younger. It was great. I wish I took photos, I had my camera and everything... Magic. Pure.  Shit monkeys and cheese, Luke and Ian are hot. Hooooooly monkey farts.   I'm thinking of doing a site for our youth group. I'll have to talk to Mike about it. See if that'll work. And if we can snag someone with a better camera than mine to take photos with.

      Over the past few days, and getting that wonderous email, I have come to realize that I am not ready for a long-term relationship at this time in my life. This year I have a heavy course load, and the YAC, and youth group, and family, and work, and Cons, and fundraising, and me time! It's looknig pretty hectic, and to squeeze in, and be fair to have a boyfriend is just not possible. I tried it before. It's cruel. I mean, I'll take a fling now and then, but I realy think that something serious isn't going to be possible. And of course, I realize all of this after things become unfixable with someone who is willing to fling too. HEH. Oh well. In time. And hey, at least I realized this now, and not when I was in a serious relationship with someone I cared about deeply. I can be free with the wind this year, and I'm glad. And when I find that love of mine, I know he'll be waiting for me.

      AHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!! Must post must post must post! You'd never realize how much you need to BLOG when you can't! *flips out* OH MY GOSH! SO much hasn't happened! :D  Wednesday: Music in the park! That was a blast and a half. After getting over my depression I realized I needed this day more than anything. And James called me. And we talked. He's such a sweetie and nutso. Really.  Then I went down to Laura's, where we walked into Brentwood to the park. It was a lot of fun, even if no one else wanted to dance with me. we met up with Cam, and Karissa and Nick and Steve were there, and we ran into Liz and Michelle, running some youth game. We went to the store and bought rat traps, and played with those..And yes, I still have the one that works...Yes :) Then I met up with James and we went for a drive. Then I was HOME. My morale, and life was masterly revitalised, after being so bummed lately.  Thursday: what? I decided that I had to tell Tom my feelings, cause I knew it would be impossible to do so at youth. I was right. And the email I got back was hardly satisfying, but....eh. I've given it up.  Friday: Cry it out, it's YOOOOOOOOOOOOOUTH NIIIIIGHT!!! YES! After checking my email and discovering that Laura wasn't going to go, I decided that I had to watch What Dreams May COme, which is on of my favortie movies, and the best to cry too. The whole movie, I was in tears. Man, it's so spectactualar, made me really jealous that people out there have a love like that. I know my time will come. I hope.  Then I got ready for youth, wearing my hot new shirt, and everything. I looked soo hot, not to brag, but yes. We got around and ate pizza, and attemped check in, to fail miserably. Then we went out to play some Unitarian Paintball...only because we used Q-tips, not paintballs. So fun, I think I still have purple on me :) Then we did check in, again, for real, and played Honey, I love you. I hate that game. Only because the slightest thing will make me laugh, because I am so happy:) Then we went outside and me and Fiona got involved in this impromto grass fight. I think I have all of the grass out now, not really sure. Then we got into Red Rover....Ooooh yeah. I got to hold Luke's hand, even if he was squezing it to death. It was still sexy dangerous. I forgot how hot he was. *RaWr!!!* Then Ian/Kula tried to take us out, and I ended up smashing my arm, but never letting go. And then I got to hold Ian's hand, even if it was for a minute. And it was soft...gentle..ahem. He also later said I looked hot in my outfit. At least someone noticed. (Ian is also super hot, he's like, drool...Oh man. I don't think I ever stopped liking him...HOTTIE). Then a few more guys tried taking out the link between me and Luke, it was like iron, nothing was going to. It was awesome.  Then we played Christians and Headhunters, and a few drama games that made us all laugh, and then we went inside. The guys were playing with their ring tones, which was so annoying, and watching Beauty and the Beast. Too bad I never brought my special edition...Oh yeah! Me and Lenaya were singing along to the parts we knew, and the lines where they were speaking. Then the guys...I think it was Max, Greg (my own brother), maybe Tom, and maybe Tony started throwing ice down my shirt. So I grabbed my sweater and got out of there, cause I didn't know why they were "flirting" with me like that. And I didn't really wanna know either. So I went and sat out on this jetty of rocks, then I decided I wanted to be closer to the road, and I FELL DOWN THE CLIFF. Rolled down about..10-15 feet, and it hurt, cause I landed on gravel. I limped back inside, where everyone was like, oh my god, what happened! And it was actaully bleeding too. It was ridculous, but I think it made those guys feel bad. They were apologizing after all.   Saturday/Today: Lake! We cleaned the carpets. I went to the lake with Karissa, Steve, and Laura. We went swimming for a bit, and then we played some asshole, and then...... When Fiona came back from Con Con she was raving about this card game, Egyption Rat Penis Fuck. And Karissa today told everyone she knew how to play. And now I know how to play the best game ever, and it's a Unitarian one. Oh yeah..It's so much fun. One game lasted almost like, an hour. It was wild. Then I came home, and re-organized my stereo thing, so I get maximum sound. I think I have it now.  The last few days have been really fun, and if I didn't post-overload on Tuesday, I would have blogged a while ago.

      What if I had told you I loved you? Would you change your mind about us then?   The Rose  Some say love it is a river That drowns the tender reed. Some say love it is a razor That leaves your soul to bleed. Some say love it is a hunger An endless, aching need I say love it is a flower And you its only seed.  It's the heart afraid of breaking That never learns to dance It's the dream afraid of waking That never takes the chance. Its the one who won't be taken Who cannot seem to give And the soul afraid of dying That never learns to live.  And the night has been too lonely And the road has been too long. And you think that love is only For the lucky and the strong. Just remember in the winter Far beneath the bitter snow Lies the seed that with the sun's love, In the spring,  becomes   a ROSE.

      I made a new shirt. So slutty, so proud of it. It undoes in both the front and back, so you can have clevage, and tummy, or none! It's perfect. I was gonig to wear it to youth group, but now I find myself wondering where my sweats are. I don't want to be pretty. I'd trade it all in, for him. Sad? Yes. Maybe I should go, pretty up, just to show that I'm a big girl now. Hey Adam, guess we're both single now. Heh. Oh well. I'll live.  It was only a short lived thing, right? Why am I so upset. I wish I had some more friends online, to like, innterrogate him why....But I've vowed to stop that. Bring on your friends Lannie. I'm single again, and I need to fix that. Now.

      Well, now I hate myself. I knew this would happen. I'm so angered.  So I really like Tom and all. And I tell him all this, and everything. And today, after picking berries, he's all like, Go away. BEFORE he was like, Oh I wanna see you I miiiiiss you..And now, he's saying it wont work out, blah blah...Then asks me if I'm ok with that! Well, shit! Even if I wasn't, what could I do? We still wouldn't be going out, it would just be me, lovesick.   I hate men. I dont know if I ever want to be with someone again. Because this just hurts.

      Ok, I'll post.  It was a huge misunderstanding that was last night, and I freaked out. And even though I raised all this issues, and wanted answers, and got none, I feel better. I think. I still don't know where we stand, and I hope it just doesn't turn out to be a majorly sexual thing, cause that's not just want I want. I want the real stuff too. It means a lot to me. So PEH. Yes, Anyways. On Friday I'll get to see him for the first time in two weeks...It'll be wild. I'm also getting tired of hiding this thing too. I have a very good feeling that by friday, and greg's big mouth, the cat will be out, and we'll have jumped out of the closest. Hey look everyone, I'm going out with Tom....  Yes. On that note, I made myself the sexyest shirt out of an old pair of jeans of mine. It's so nice, it's kinda bad tho, cause you can just undo the entire shirt by a simple snap of the wrist....I normally wear a tank underneath, to discourage people, but not on Friday...:P Daaaaaangerous.   Biked down to the Tim Hortons in Gordon Head today. Only took about 45 minutes too. Wild. I need a back rub now, mine hurts.  I'm tired, sore and slightly wanting a certain male badly. Must...leave!

      Mmmm..I love cherry tomatos. They are so good, and round, and eatable...I could eat them all day.  I'm so bored. My friends are home yes, but no one is communicating, so the closest time (unless I dooooo something about it) I get to see everyone is Saturday, at the lake. Weeee!!! Lake! And it's even at my fave lake, Elk. So I'm bringing my air mattress, and if anyone pops it...*death* I just hope its sunny in time. I need to get a new bathing suit top by then too. Cause then I can wear my new dress! Magic.  Youth group is in 5 days! Yippee!! It's such a huge up for me at any time of my life, even if it doesn't seem so while I'm there. Helps me through, knowing I get to be weird for a few hours, and do some plllllanning! I saw Kula, or Ian, yesterday at mayfair. I almost didn't recognize him, but then I realized it was him! He's still super cute too....mreow..But I thought he had gone to Seabeck with Luke and all them.....Damn faulty information. I wonder how come he doesn't come to youth group anymore. I need something to drool over. Plus, I'm hoping to increase our numbers, by bringing friends. On friday, I have to pick between Laura and Alanna....  Adam wants me to go to a nude beach with him and a few others to well..."swim" and play some strip poker and such. I dunno if I really wanna do the whole nude thing, but it would be soooo wild. I realize how young I am around them, when they talk about stuff, but it's alright, cause they all think I'm like, 19 or 20 anyways. I told my dad that and he freaked out. But it's true. I've fooled many. I had to remind Adam how old I was when he proposed this idea that I'm still young and might stare. I hoped that would get me out of it, but it wont. Eh!  :( I miss my Alex..I haven't spoken to him since I got back from Winnipeg, and I miss that crazy bum. We had so much fun together...I wish I had talked to him at least once this summer, I wanna know if he's going to Van, and if he wants to hop on a ferry to here.....:(:( *sobs* Allllllex! I misses you...Email me back. So I know. You'd damn well be planning on going to Edmonton too, or else.  Re-reading this blog, and having Jess's help, I've been realizing that I've been quite a flirty girl lately, and that some people might get offended. But...Heh....Maybe it's time I found out where we stand and what's going on between us, cause I'm very much confused..People say I'm single (and 15, damn you lannie) others ask me how my booooooooyfriend is. I dunno, cause I'm not even sure if that's what we are! Alright! Wahh...  Hey Tom, think I need to talk to you:)

      Well. We scanned for adware, deleted like thousands, discovered trojan and spyware. Took out net. Lost all music, again for 3rd time. More than pissed.  I'm wearing my retainer again. It tastes very weird, not sure about this. I watched the Steelers vs. the Cowboys today. Decided Cowboys are my fave team, is subject to change seeing as I've only watched that game, and the superbowl where the RAMS LOST! Mwahaha....Sorry Mike:)  Have started competition with Annetta: Who can have sex first? Must beat her, so! Anyone willing?  Good grief. Later, I'm going to regret being such a slut this summer.   BTW, I heart you Rob. I want your ass. Before it's too late and my conscieous returns.

      This adware is out of control.  Trying to log into my blog, and I was hit with Porn pop ups. Before, it was match ups, and shpping sites, and I can live with that. But porn? When I wanna blog? No. That's wrong, I'm sorry.  Dangerous is my name, I live for the adventure that only you can bring.  I spent the night at Liam's last night. Mom almost blew a gasget, and finally, after talknig to his mom let me. As I turned off the TV after watching the most amazing infomercial, it hit me: I spent New Year's at Ash's. And I was even going out with him. And she never ever questioned it....  I have no conscienous anymore. I'm serious. What I have done in the past week would make normal people cry, or confused. Me? I laugh it off. And try to improve it. If it's there, it only eggs me on. I need something, or someone, to stop me. Fast. So that I get ahold of myself.  I'm looking at maybe....2, 3 certain guys when I say that.

      Punk monkeys, phone calls and ecleptic taste in music: Where is the love?  Robert*called me today just to say hi, and that he missed me, and he loved me. It was so sweet.   I'm starting to give punk music a chance....:O HIT ME! I dunno why, but maybe I can have some fun being a punk now. I'm planning dying my hair too... It's either going to be pink and purple, or blonde, or red, or turquiose with black streaks, or brown and turquoise streaks.

      Washing troubles.  The washing machine finally broke down today. I spent my morning fishing out clothes and wringing them out, and taking them up to the bathroom, rinseing and wringing, rinsing and wringing, and finally hanging them outside to hopefully dry. I hated that. My hands were all dried out, so now I've gone through almost a container of hand lotion to make them smooth again. Finally. Until then, like, no clean clothes, unless Mom feels like using the Laundromat again (yeah right). The fixer dude is coming on Wednesday. A week. Damn.  I took the kittie out for another walk today. She likes me moer, we don't fight as much now. We've grown up so fast :)

      I wrote today. Beautiful too. I'm so proud. Went to church today, wore the worst possible dress, looked hotter than ever though. Even some of the adults were masterly impressed, with my high heels, I looked very professional, and I was told that too. I enjoyed every minute of it. Except when my dress slid up to my waist and I almost didn't catch it when I went to youth. That would have been dangerous.  Going out with Annetta tomorw to the clinic. Hopefully we can get in tomorw, I have PLANS. Yes. Sexy plans.  Enjoy my writings.     Blue Dress  Sexy in the blue dress Sliding up my waist Revealing the nude underneath Hairs gently curling Sexy in the blue dress Top sliding down my chest Bra revealed, breasts underneath Oozing out, wanting to see day Sexy in the blue dress Smart looking and hot Making second looks everywhere Smile, laugh, and nod Sexy in the blue dress Hair all a flow Keeping legs together Trying helplessly to look innocent Sexy in the blue dress.

      Sleep is beautiful.  I don't have to worry about school the next day, or doing my homework. Don't need to worry about arguments with friends, and dealing with sexuality. Don't need to worry about my feelings, or with people calling me. About excuses not to see people. About sex. About hormones. About the guy I'm falling in a hole over.   The week is over And I'm glad it's done Now I can stop pulling off This show to everyone   Certain people "vanadilized" my blog. It's like rape. It feels unclean, dirty, and the only way I can think of cleanizing it is starting a new blog. Which isn't going to happen.  Lost my train of thought, Ruth called. What a great woman.

      Thundstorm today. Huuuuuuge. About three hail storms, huge lightning, loooooooud thunder. If it was darker, around say, 7-10, I'd be under my bed. Scared.  It's right over top of my house for once, and I have a 360 degree view of it. Turn in any direction, wait a tad, and there's the lightning, and the defening thunder to go with it. It's awful. I can't remember a thunderstorm like this.  Literally, if it was later, and darker, that's it. I'd be runnin to go hide with someone, I'd be a blubbery mess. I can't stand them at night. Kinda like a phobia. *whimpers*

      Summary of summer....  Wow. The summer has past so fast. And I feel compelled to compare last summer to this, because last summer was a painful, horrible time, and this year..it wasn't as bad.  Last summer: I started off with a wonderful loving boyfriend who I cared for muchos. We saw the Canada day fireworks together, even though my brother was with us. It was so super romantic. I wrote him a little cute book on the snuggle bunny (me) and her steamboat willy (him). We were madly in love, talked on the phone and on the computer for hours. He sent me the sweetest story about love, and I still have it to this day, I send it out to everyone around Valentines. Something I remember so vividly. I was having an incredibly shitty tuesday. He called me up, and talked with me until he had to go to work, then left. About...15 minutes later he showed up at my house. We spent the afternoon together, one of the best days I can remember. We made out at the top of my driveway. I still have a picture from that day. Towards the end of the month, he went up to his cabin in Sprout lake. It was hard being away from him, but his sister, who I was also friends with invited me over for a few nights. Willy came home for a day while I was still there and it was magical. I can remember going out to clean his mom's shop at one in the morning, and we sat out, under the stars, making out for what seemed ever and then some. Burnouts in his car, good night and good morning kisses. It was wonderful. Then he went back to the cabin, and everything was fine. And when he came back, I believe Aug 4, he broke up with me. Completely almost out of the blue. He then sent me harassing emails, blocked me, wouldn't talk to me. I was a lovesick mess of emotions. My best friend Liam was at camp, and I was alone with no one to talk to. Except for Alex. And Ash. Then Taylor came and spent the day with me and Fiona, and katie came too, and so did Alex. And it was great seeing Alex again, and I miss him muchlies. Then school started, and I was still pining for will.  This summer:  I spent July slumming around. Josie came to visit and stayed with me for almost a week, and started things with Tom. I told him I liked him. We went out. I was having a blast. I've liked this kid since I was in grade 4, it was like an honest dream come true. He went away to Seabeck.  And cheated on me. I didn't know tho. He came back, and we broke up. It was sad, but because I had been hanging around Lannie, I made new, older friends, some of whom I like more than friends. I've been tramping around, and hung out with my friends, water fights, argh, the works. I wish I talked to Alex. Making plans with Tom to totally sophisticate the world.  Or ourselves. Found out today he cheated on me. Feel betrayed slightly.  I still, no matter what, prefer this summer over last. The one good thing about last summer, was that I saw my Alex. And now that summer's over, I'm ready for winter, and conferences, and fun filled sex.   I heart you Adam, I'm sorry you're girlfriend is such an airhead.   Bring it on school....Gimme all you got. And a boyfriend. *eyes certain people*

      IT'S NOT JUST THE WEATHER THAT'S COOLER IN CANADA Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, July 30, 2003.   You live next door to a clean-cut, quiet guy. He never plays loud music or throws raucous parties. He doesn't gossip over the fence, just smiles politely and offers you some tomatoes. His lawn is cared-for, his house is neat as a pin and you get the feeling he doesn't always lock his front door. He wears Dockers. You hardly know he's there.  And then one day you discover that he has pot in his basement, spends his weekends at peace marches and that guy you've seen mowing the yard is his spouse.  Allow me to introduce Canada.  The Canadians are so quiet that you may have forgotten they're up there, but they've been busy doing some surprising things. It's like discovering that the mice you are dimly aware of in your attic have been building an espresso machine.  Did you realize, for example, that our reliable little tag-along brother never joined the Coalition of the Willing? Canada wasn't willing, as it turns out, to join the fun in Iraq. I can only assume American diner menus weren't angrily changed to include freedom bacon," because nobody here eats stuff anyway."  And then there's the wild drug situation: Canadian doctors are authorized to dispense medical marijuana. Parliament is considering legislation that would not exactly legalize marijuana possession, as you may have heard, but would reduce the penalty for possession of under 15 grams to a fine, like a speeding ticket. This is to allow law enforcement to concentrate resources on traffickers; if your garden is full of wasps, it's smarter to go for the nest rather than trying to swat every individual bug.  Or, in the United States, bong.  Now, here's the part that I, as an American, can't understand. These poor benighted pinkos are doing everything wrong. They have a drug problem: Marijuana offenses have doubled since 1991. And Canada has strict gun control laws, which means that the criminals must all be heavily armed, the law-abiding civilians helpless and the government on the verge of a massive confiscation campaign. (The laws have been in place since the '70s, but I'm sure the government will get around to the confiscation eventually.) They don't even have a death penalty!  And yet .. nationally, overall crime in Canada has been declining since 1991. Violent crimes fell 13 percent in 2002. Of course, there are still crimes committed with guns -- brought in from the United States, which has become the major illegal weapons supplier for all of North America -- but my theory is that the surge in pot-smoking has rendered most criminals too relaxed to commit violent crimes. They're probably more focused on shoplifting boxes of Ho-Hos from convenience stores.  And then there's the most reckless move of all: Just last month, Canada decided to allow and recognize same-sex marriages. Merciful moose, what can they be thinking? Will there be married Mounties (they always get their man!)? Dudley Do-Right was sweet on Nell, not Mel! We must be the only ones who really care about families. Not enough to make sure they all have health insurance, of course, but more than those libertines up north.  This sort of behavior is a clear and present danger to all our stereotypes about Canada. It's supposed to be a cold, wholesome country of polite, beer-drinking hockey players, not founded by freedom-fighters in a bloody revolution but quietly assembled by loyalists and royalists more interested in order and good government than liberty and independence.  But if we are the rugged individualists, why do we spend so much of our time trying to get everyone to march in lockstep? And if Canadians are so reserved and moderate, why are they so progressive about letting people do what they want to?  Canadians are, as a nation, less religious than we are, according to polls. As a result, Canada's government isn't influenced by large, well-organized religious groups and thus has more in common with those of Scandinavia than those of the United States, or, say, Iran.  Canada signed the Kyoto global warming treaty, lets 19-year-olds drink, has more of its population living in urban areas and accepts more immigrants per capita than the United States. These are all things we've been told will wreck our society.  But I guess Canadians are different, because theirs seems oddly sound.  Like teenagers, we fiercely idolize individual freedom but really demand that everyone be the same. But the Canadians seem more adult -- more secure.  They aren't afraid of foreigners. They aren't afraid of homosexuality. Most of all, they're not afraid of each other.  I wonder if America will ever be that cool.

       urlLink     Congrats! In your life, you'll have sex with13 people! And you'll first have sex at age 17, in the backseat of a car. You are 37% sexy.   Greetings, confusoid. You scored a...62%   Is it a bird? A plane? Is it a boy? A girl? Is it love, or is it lust? Ah, you. You are that rare mix of sensitive and sensual, romantic and randy, pride and prejudice, etc. When you see your crush, you waffle like a Belgian, unsure of whether you'd rather paint their toes or suck on their toes. Poets have long been puzzled by your kind. You'll never fall for robots or nymphos, but you will suffer longs bouts of marriage.   Damn, J-Lo! You are...87%  dateable! Attractive and confident, witty and charming, a healthy ambrosia-based diet... you're wanted in the 48 contiguous states, you slayer. Call me. Seduce me. Make me a man (or woman.) Not only do you know how to turn a guy's (or girl's) engines on, but you also know how to oil, lube and rotate it. You put the "elation" back into "relationship," and the "night" back into "one-night stand."

      I refuse to care. I refuse to care. I refuse to care.  I've never felt so lost and alone and hopeless before. It's not even over something worth being upset about. Celery said that Asparagus and Leaks were playing and I got so....Moody. Asparagus is super confusing. First he tells me how much he loves Leaks, then he tells me he doesn't know who he wants, me or her. Meanwhile, his like, best friend, Jalepeno is trying to get down my pants. Maybe that's why Asparagus is tempermental and stuff. I'll tell him, I DONT WANT JALEPENO. Or maybe my problem is that I'm faced rejection again. A comment Tom made the other day really, really hurt. Why is a stupid reason. It jsut made me realize what he was really after, and what I wanted. Reminding me why we ended. There's still that lonely part of me that hopes I can change his mind and come running back to me. I'm still hoping for that con fling idea. I still can't bring myself to talk to San. The only reason this whole war started was because I needed someone else on my side besides Jess. His reaction was so out of the blue that it shocked, scared, and angered me. Then suddenly my good friends (some) came clean about their feelnigs, and I started to admit them to myself. I've even gone out and told a few people. It's making me a bit stronger inside.

      Pulled from my youth notebook, July 25:  It's hard to contain my feelings and emotions around someone I want so incredibly bad. It's so secretive, and dangerous, but it tortures me inside. I want to grab him and hold him in my arms. We have reasons to hide it, good reasons, and I don't want my family to know. But he acts like I'm not even here at all. I know that's acting natural, but it's so hard. It's horrible. I don't know how to catch his eye without being obvious but it is hard. I want to kiss him. Just take him aside and remind him, Remember me? Tomorow holds such promise and excitement, I can hardly contain without exploding. I don't know how it will be, or what we will do, but maybe that's the best part. I'm so nervous and anxious, but if I get to be with him then it's all worth while. Hiding is hard. I can't even sit beside him without looking weird. I got to hold his hand today. It kinda made me jitter, even if we were trying to knock each other over. I can't wait until we can do it, and be sincere. Tomorow, no matter what, when I see him I'm going to hug him. Show him that I mean business. Life is tough but I'm living. And I love it.

      When I came home from Annetta's yesterday, I suddenly realized something, when I logged onto MSN.  *WHaM!* I don't like Tom. It just hit me, like an arrow, or bullet through my heart. I don't like him. He is arrogant, almost. I still find him attractive, and find myself staring at him during socials, but I mean, I always stare at the sexy people..o.O.   I used to think that Adam wasn't someone to pull at ye-olde heart strings. And he is. It's like a sudden bang, and I'm attracted to a new person.   I've had a dream. Me and him are swimming at Thetis Lake, my new favorite place, goofing off, and splashing at each other, riding on his back. Then we go off and lie on the beach for a bit, snuggling close to each other. It's a cloudy day. Slowly the night falls around us, and we are naked! swimming under the stars...  Damnit.....

      Added more pictures to my albums...Click on more pics, then go to me, or my animals...New pics in both, hurrah!  I love my burger king crown. It's so nice.   Me and Tyler biked into Colwood today. Took about 2 hours, we hung out at BK for a bit, then went to Thetis..I want to go back now, it's soooooo niice..Who wants to go?:P Then we started home, stopped to play at a playground, and to pick wildflowers every so often :) We had fun, which was good. My bum and legs, and back are so sore, and I'll pay for it tomorw, for sure. It's the start of a very busy week, everyone wants a piece of me (almost literally in some cases) so, in advance: If you get on the back burner, there's a reason for it. I have to start taking school seriously, and if I love my classes so much, then it shouldnt be too hard to try and pull off straight A's this semester.. *HOPES*  Adam, you and me need to re-make our plans for cuddle time! I still feel super bad about ditching it yesterday, but I felt like crap....Wasn't in a cuddle mood..:( NEXT TIME....Mwahaha..  I'm so sore, I'm gonna hit the sheets early for sure tonight. Especially because MEAN ANNETTA is making me walk home tomorw from her house. What a wasted hour.

      It's been a tough few days.   My emotions have been run in every different direction. I've been comforting one of my friends, it hasn't been her week. I've been sick, and it's tiring me out. Now my asthma is getting wonked, so I have to deal with inhalers. I also have to find the one I lost. I've been stressed out trying to make codes for html work. My ex came out and told me he still liked me. Mom said she doesn't want to pay for my Van trip, my Oregon trip, or a passport. One of the girls in my class has been clashing with my personality. My feelings for people have changed. I have new medication, Tri-cyclen if you must know. I'm finding myself attracted to new people, and having my heart crudely ripped open with the same excuse as before..."I told you.." Saw Lannie today. Gave me a ride home. Planned Disney days with Laura a bit more. Will post movie list soon.    It just hurts today. I wanted this weekend to be something good, to connect with someone, and find out what was chemistryly clicking between us, and all. But now... Maybe not. All I wanna do is rather up in a corner and cry. Forever.  I got my HTML codes working though. Figured out javascript damn fine. Look out, learning frames, and re-building my website. Watch for the updates.

      Thoughts filled with love and lust and want of someone holding me forever.  Had dream that this gorgeous hunk from a past that mom knew (I dont know where I knew him from) came and rescued me. I'm dying to know who he was, he was a dream. Now that I've woken up, I feel so empty in here, like I've actually broke up with him. It hurts.  He was this 6'6, incredibly nice, guy, who forever reason rescued me from the harshness of church, and when I saw him i ran up and gave him the hugest hug....Like I've known him my entire life... I'm going to the dream dictionarys on this one...

      Fucking dad. Won't let me go see Asparagus and Celery tonight.   Fucking mom. Won't pay for me to get a passport, so now I can't go to Fall Con, miss meetings, and be misarble. WARNING: If I don't go, I'm going to be SO misrable that weekend. Search and destroy.  And I have to walk home from Annetta's tomorw. One. Fucking. Hour. And I don't even have music to distract me.

      Youth was insane. I mean, come on, I saw my ex in his boxers. And I was completely naked (in a sleeping bag). Strip Blackjack. Ooooh man. Girl on girl action. Guy on guy action. SILENT FOOTBALL.  Hurrah. I'm so, So tired. I never slept. It's 12.36 right now. I've got 29 hours of non-sleeping here. Weeeeeeeeeeeeee......  I have never had so much sexual fun at youth before. That was a truelly awesome, kicking, youth group overnight.  And no Tom, when you snap the suspenders, it DOESNT HURT.

      I know I haven't posted recently, but that's only because I don't have anything to say. Nothing really noticable is happening.  I talked with a parent last night for a while. Her daughter, who is also in grade 11, is interesting in joining youth group again. By chance, I looked them up in the photo directory. They were in it. The daughter seems to be on of those "preppy, popular, twink" types. But oh well. She must be cool if she wants to join our youth group, and it's another girl who just happens to be my age. Chances are though, she'll go to the dark side, the "cool" side and leave poor me and Fiona alone in the dust.  Mom is still refusing to pay for Oregon. Tonight, I'm gonig to ask her to make a list of stuff she would like me to do that would convince her to give me the money to go. I'm getting anxious, because the cost is about to go up soon, and I know for sure she wouldn't pay when the rate is 100$ US. Grrrrrowls. Excited for this weekend. Friday I make up a socials class I skipped, then go home and do homework and some of the list and pack for that night. Youth overnighttttt!!!Hurrah. Then I come home Saturday morning to do more of the list, clean my room, and anything else, and then I go over to Laura's for.....DISNEY DAYS! We are going to spend the rest of Saturday and as much of Sunday as we possibly can to watch 24+ Disney movies. I'm so excited, I'm bringing tissues, and everything. We're gonna gorge on junk food too, stay up all night...Totally girls night. I've already packed the movies.  Monday is a pro-d day, and Tyler has that day off work, so we're thinking of getting the truck and his canoe and going up to Thetis all day to canoe and swim, if we can. It'll be great fun, cause Tyler is such a goof. I really can't wait. Tonight I'm going to Ash's to finally learn DnD...That is, if Ashley and Misha don't go. Seeing as I'm not too close with them (I strongly dislike them) I wouldn't feel comfortable going. Will is supposed to be there. He claims the next time he sees me he was going to give me the hugs he owes me. Maybe I'll actaully get them this time. Adam is supposed to be there too. And well. We all know about Adam. If he is there, and I can trap him alone, then I will ask him about...yes. The thing. I won't post it on here, it's rather personal. I think.  Fiona, if by chance you read my blog, check your email. Fall con forms, youth group forms, YAC emails....There's a lot. I can't even begin to comprehend what I have to tell you. Please go tomorw night, Laura isn't going and I don't want to be all alone with Tom..*whimper*  I'll post the offical Disney things Saturday, if I get a chance, to keep you all informed.  See you all Tuesday.

      When I hear this song, or see that movie (What Dreams May Come) , all I do is think of you. Damnit, I can't believe how fast and how far I've fallen for you.  Forever By John Stamos (Full House)  If every word I said could make you laugh I'd talk forever  (together my love)  I asked the sky  just what we had it showed forever  (together my love)  If the sun has it for you to fill your heart with joy I'd sing forever  (together my love)  Forever, forever  I felt so happy lovin you  With the love I have for you live in your heart and be forever  (together my love)  Forever, forever  I felt so happy lovin you  If every word I said could make you laugh I'd talk forever  Forever, forever  I'd be so happy lovin you

      Jeeeez... After watching the breakfast club, all I can think of is Kelty, and that first night at Spring Con. Remonds me why I wanted to go to Fall Con. Even if bygones were to be bygones, just to see what would happen.  If certain people read this and say that's exactly why he didn't want a con fling, well, shut up. I didn't say I wanted him madly, I just missed that damn fine kiss....  Adam, I miss you..:'(    Post from the past: May 26, 2003 Friday night reigned on, and we explored the site, got to know where everyone and everything was, touch groups (that we still got lost finding) orientation, the usual. Late for worship, was sad about that because worship is fairly important. Went back the room, started to almost snuggle with K. Just get comfortable with everyone in the room, we get called out because someone has already broken community, the rules, by smoknig pot in their room....Not too cool. Everyone gets up and goes for a walk, and we steal a lugagge cart and start pushing people around. I break away from the group with him, and we go walking around the campus. We hit were another group was, out having a stroll with a smoke, K bums a smoke (but never smokes it himself) and we talk about this guy wanting to be a unitarian. We walk off, and go find this stairwell, and sit in it. Not talking, just hudled close together, keeping each other warm, waiting for something. My heart starts to rapidly poubd in my chest, I feel like its about to explode in pieces everywhere. Finally, after what could be hours, days, months, years, he reaches over and kisses me..Softly and gentle at first, then powerful and strong, unleashing power and lust caught up for ever...

      Wow. I posted a half finished blog the other day. I was gonig to write this nice long one, but then, I got interupted, and because I was at school, adn had different settings, and wasnt sure I was going to finish it, I posted it with the intentions of going home and doing something with it then. And people read it. Now, it clearly states the name JANICE. Not Jessica. Not Celine. Not Sanford. JANICE.  My cute little disclaimer on my blog reads: "Respect this, and please, please, unless it is your name mentioned, don't assume I'm talking about you. "  When you ASSUME, you make an ASS out of U and ME.   So Jessica, the next time you read a blog, no matter if you know it's about you or not, if it doesn't state your name, DON'T HASH OUT.  Haven't I been thro this with you before?

      I talked to Adam today and that made everything worthwhile. That's it. It's quite sad and amusing that someone can make my entire week turn around with just the slightest smile, or by his simple presence.  Adam, you are an amazing person.

      I'd finish this post, but I don't want to. I'd delete this post, but again, I don't want to.    The other half of my problem: Janice.*  She's overall, an alright person. We've had major disputes in the past, over a certain ex. I'd just gain his trust back, and she would say something to him, a lie that I had done, and all the trust I had spent ages getting back would be lost.  Recently, they broke up (I think, it's constant on again, off again) and we've become friends. She has a blog as well.   *Name has been changed to respect their privacy, not mine.

      Grrrr....... Last night I signed into MSN, but I didn't really wanna talk to people. I just wanted to see who was online, and if someone I really wanted to talk to signed in, I could see, and talk to them. I expressed my wishes for people not talking to me, and told everyone I didn't feel like talking, so please don't talk to me. Or else I would block you.   One of my now not good friends kept talking to me, claiming she could help out, and to talk to her. I ignored her. Then she messaged me, saying I was a horrible person for ignoring her, why wont I just talk to her, etc, etc. I blocked her. I had given her enough warnings and she still continued to bother me. Then she emailed me.  She didn't understand why I was so upset about not going to Fall Con, even though I have explained the importance many times. She called it a stupid SEMINAR. SEMINAR.   Any Unitarians out there who read my blog and know what importance a con is, of any kind, would know my pain and hurt, and disgust when she called Fall Con a seminar. It's more than just a seminar. There's workshops. Worship. The dance. Touch groups. Cuddle puddles. Marshmellow fights (with sanford). Staying up all night. Con flings. Hanging out with people you only see a few times a year. And I really wanted to see people from last year. Super bad. It's upsetting.  I explained this all to her before, and she still doesn't understand. So she sends me this email:   ok kiwi. Why are you being so mean? i am like one of your friends? i dont think the real kiwi would do that to one of her friends. Thats not you. Now please stop it. i hate it when youre like this, and over what? A SEMINAR. big whoop.chill out. there will be more. please UNblock me. dont be an evil kiwi. stop being angry.Take a chill pill. please.   I email her back, asking to PLEASE leave me alone. And get some repsect and listening skills because she is clearly lacking of them. I was very mad at this point too. She quickly emails me back this:   KIWI?! what the fuck?! why are u so pissed off? ur a good friend of mine and i dont wanna loose you! and im sorry, semenar conference.. same thing to me. it hurts me to hear you say stuff like Get Lost, and fuck off. Why are u so angry at me? im only trying to help. Why do you hate me so? and i think i have enough sensitivity thank you very much you have no fucking idea. MY DAD DIED FOR CHRISTS SAKES. i was only 11! i dont need anymore greif from you kiwi. and im not reaming u out. thanks for crushing me again kiwi. Thanks alot. Just because YOURE pissed off. Someones trying to help you. Thanks kiwi. Thanks for crushing what strong part was left in my heart. Thanks alot.   I'm not going to bother responding to this email because I don't think there is anything to respond to. It's going to take me a long time to add her again too. If she only read my name, and everything I was telling her, and my away message, maybe this wouldn't have happened.

      Since may, I have been looking forward to this youth conference (hosted by my church type thing) in October in Oregon. I made a lot of new friends from the one in May, even ..well...hooked up with this guy that I wouldn't mind seeing again, not to mention all the perks of a con: No-talent show, workshops, touch groups, cuddle puddles, all nighters, the dance, hug buttons...  So basically, I have no money for this con. And I ended up working out an agreement with my mom saying I'd work about 15 hours for my mom at $8 an hour, and she would pay for the con. It's $80 US, plus I think I need a passport to get into the US. I've already worked a few hours for my mom, I'm all proud, and super duper excited to go.   Mommy dearest breaks a bombshell over my head last night. "I can't pay for you now, because I have to pay for this, this, this, this, this, this, and this." Basically saying, too bad, you aren't going now! She tried to make it better saying she'd pay for the leadership conference I'm going to in November. Which I don't really want to go to, but I have to.   It pisses me off though. She almost always does this when I want something sooooo bad, that I would kill for it. Whenever there is an event that I want to go to, she leads me on, then makes up all these stupid reasons why I can't go. Then, what hurts the most, is that whenever Greg needs something for cadets, or whenever they feel liek they need something, they buy it. They claim they are broke, but yet they continue to buy candy, and clothes, and other junk for THEM. I'm tired of it.  I'm almost getting the absolute point where I move out, and make them pay child support. Then finally, maybe they would learn to smarten up. In any case, I'm hoping I won't be here at Christmas. And I'm taking all the christmas decorations with me.   Sorry fo the long rant, I'm so incredibly blind with rage.  >:|

      The silly apology. (I hope you guys know that this is totally against my principles, because I shouldn't even be explaining myself to people who overreacted, but whatever.)  Jessica: You're up first doll. The whole reason probably why this mess started was because of two things: a) I wanted to bitch at someone, and I was kinda hoping it was going to be you, just because. I needed to rip soemone up, it was going to be the first person that talked to me. I'm sorry it had to be you. b) You read a half finished post. That was mostly my fault that I didn't disclaimer that, but I had to get off the computer *pronto* to do something else in Info Tech, and never got the chance to finish it, or do anything but save it. Why I posted that? It was just bothering me how you tried to "force" people to comment, and I was providing the background information. I feel background helps you get into the situation properly, and enter the mindset I have, to help people understand what I'm thinking. Back to the comments thing - I was just gonig to say how I disliked that. I feel that comments should reflect your ideas on the post, and be totally optional. Yeah, it sucks when people don't comment a post you really wanted comments on, but what can you do? I was also going to say that it kinda does bother me when you do comment on my blog, and it has nothing to do with the original post. Kinda like what Sanford told you when he asked you not to comment on his, but a lot nicer. That was all.  In addition: It says in THREE different places if you are not mentioned, don't assume it's you. Three. Twice on my little note-y things, and once in my read me. There's an entire section on it in the Read me. And, you've done it before, reading a post and assuming it was all about you. (But that time it honestly wasn't, that time it was about Misha. Another story though.)  Chris: Seeing as I did really nothing to you, there was no need to overreact. That's great that you got mad at me because your friend was, but that's a little bit trendy. And creating fake sitautions wasn't cool at all. Honestly, all I could care about at the skate last night was my poor aching feet, knee and hands, and later, how we were getting home. Alright, I  am a bit of a hypocrite, and I'll admit it. Last night I was talking about someone behind there backs - but it wasn't you. It was Celine. And I'll get to that later. In short, there should be no reason why you are mad at me. If there is, please let me know.  Will: Same goes for you. You read a half finished post and over reacted. And you broke my blogger's rule about assuming, like Jess. And you were simply following the trend pattern of getting mad at me. So stop.  Alex: Again, same for you with the trend-whoreness. It's getting a bit sad now. Especially seeing as I barely talk to you, except when you are at school. So I really dont know what that is about.  Clare: You're just going to have to explain to me why you are mad at me, or someone, because I'm just at a loss of words over that. In fact, while you're at it, will someone tell me what I even DID to make everyone so mad at the skate? Exsist?  Celine: Honestly, you don't get an apology. This is explaining things to you FOR THE LAST TIME. Last night you were awful. Whenever me and Clare came up to talk to you, you would go away. And then when we called you on it, you ignored us. Then, expecting us to be psychic, you "forgot" to tell us that you couldn't give us a ride home. Now, yes, you may have said that you MIGHT be able to give us a ride, but when someone says might, you assume a yes with that. Everyone does. It's automatic. AS soon as you knew though, that we couldnt get a ride, the first thing you should have done, before figuring out how you wree getting home, was to TELL US. We are not supposed to know that we couldn't. And then even after the skate, when we were looking for your friend you still neglect to tell us. Only after did we find out when you were running away after your friend and her mom, shouting over your shoulder. Now, with that, knowing that late, how, honestly did you expect anyone to get home? What if we had done that to you? What would you have felt? If we had acted like that to you, the entire night? Would you been sitting here, feeling love for me? Of course not.  Honestly, I wish Clare's mom would have said "No, I can't pick you up", and hung up the phone. So we would have been forced to walk. Or hitchhike, or rely on one of my retarded friends to get us home. And then I wish that something would have happened to us, like getting abducted, or getting in an accident. Then, unless you really are an emotionless monster, you would be forced to think and say to yourself: If only I had told them earlier, picked up a phone and called them... Yes, Clare has a phone. How observant of you. That means it would have been even easier for you to tell us we couldn't get a ride. And then this whole thing would have been snapped in the but earlier, and no bad feelings occured. And just to let you know, you pull one more cute little thing like this (this is the second this month) and that's it. I don't care whether you are Adam's sister or GOD himself, I'll just do to you what I did to my other ex-best friend Misha. Block, delete, ignore. So if you really do "care about me", then watch your mouth.  Ash: Last straw with you too. I want to be your friend, and that's it. I know you like me still, but the feeling is not mutual. How many times do I need to tell you this before you finally get it? You are still treating me as your girlfriend, and I'm not. Even after I specifically tell you, don't touch me, you still do. I'm not interested. I'm not going to drag you downstairs and make sweet love to you. So stop thinking that! Then maybe I'll gain some more respect for you and treat you like a human again, instead of a virus that's in love with me. Take the feelings, put them in a box, and throw away the key. And whatever happened to those three ladies of yours that you claimed told you the same thing? I thought they were fictional, why would they single out me specifically? And if you think I singled you out and told you that, I did. Because you are the only one still trying to get into my heart!  Adam: I'm not mad at you, I just want to post about you, is all. :) Miss you madly, and we need to get together, PRONTO. I'm so mad at James right now, it's undescribable. Anyways, let's plan something. *kuds to you*  Sanford: Three letters, LDC. Are you and Erin going? Please let me know, because right now we have 0 participants, and the event will prolly be cancelled. And I must see my favorite Calgary people again! (Cora is my favorite as well, as well as Fiona. If you maybe wanna make her come too, I certainly won't protest :P)   I've ranted and spilled my heart enough. If I've missed someone, I'll get you later. In fact, I know for sure I've missed one person, and that's a debate I'm not sure whether I'm even gonig to get into, or post on here. Thanks for reading. For commenting purposes, I've unbanned everyone. Please comment more than three words, make it worth the comment. And be relevant, I don't need to hear about your new shoes on my comments, that's what MSN and Email are there for. Ciao, everyone.

      Had to make new XP account. Other had too much junk.  Can't delete the damn thing tho, it won't let me for some assinine reason. Hopefully when I do, these annoying adware bars disappeer from my IE. They prevent me from having any fun, because they have to load...> When I re-configure everything on this new account, and have somethings straightened out, facts sorted out, information obtained, and backpack returned, expect some sort of lengthy update.  Much to my absolute dread, I've unbaned everyone who was once banned. Just to see what will happen. Don't make me regret it.   Wait...Isn't there a setting around here for public/private blog.....?

      This is supposed to be my solice. My place to hide when the world was rough and express my thoughts, and share them with others so they could understand more about me.  Like my sugarcoating. I hardly ever show my emotion around other people, unless it's happy. This was the place to be different. I've been forced to sensor some people.  I've been told what I can and can't blog. I've been told to change how I act, dress, look, feel. I've been told I'm bossy and overdomineering.  After the halloween party, and LDC, I'm not planning anymore youth events for a while.  I don't know when I'll blog again either. I don't even know why I bother signing into MSN anymore if all I get is depressed.  See ya around.

      I hate it when my changes don't work. Sanford, when you get home, if you feel nice, do you wanna let me see your comments code? So that I know where I'm supposed to change mine? I'll love you forever..(even though I already do).  Played with Haloscan today. Fun buttons and new tricks I learned there.

      Fuck, life's boring sometimes. It's 9.43 saturday night. I didn't feel like being a socialite, so here I am home in my jammies, sulking. Got a new upright freezer today. Mom hates it cause everything falls out, so there's a dark cloud over the whole fucking house. Peachy. Been yelled at number of times for the things we ruined at the haunted house, and other things. Mom seems to think I'm the youth advisor or something. All I do is relay the message to the group, adding the words" My mom's a bitch".  Yelled/angered at Tom today. He accused me of not moving on. HA HA HA. I laughed in his face. He was drunk though, and called me a bitch. No more Ms Nice Chick for him. He's called me retarded too. I'm almost glad it didn't work out for that. He also hates cats. He's done.  Speaking of moving on: Adam? I dunno. Really, I'm so messed up over feelings and junk. I'm just ignoring it now, casting it aside and worring about better things: The mess that claimed my room. I still don't think it's bad, hell it could be a lot worse.  I organized all my clothes drawers and my closet today. Whoo!  Hurray for the control-Y key, otherwise would have lost half of post. Stupid technology.   I'm so bored right now I'm thinking of re-sizing this template and actually completing it: Archives links, links to site-y things.. I also went to  urlLink Beki's site  and skillfully aquired many of her images.  Good job Beki!  Miss you like hellwater Adam. We need to work something out. Bad.

      Are you kicking yourself now for what you did? Asking yourself why you said those words? Why you cast me away? You said you weren't into the whole deal with commintment. But now you are mourning for someone to love, and for someone to love you. You had it all, and you threw it away. And I laugh at you. I almost have it all, I'm just waiting for the time to be just right to snag him into my love trap. We'll fall back in love together, him and I, throughout the ages, and you'll be sitting say why? Why did I throw it all away? Life's not going to well, and you're stuck for an answer. Discussions in class got you thinking, thinking damn, I had it all and I gave it away.  I'm laughing, laughing so hard. Until I myself fall down to the ground in a love shattered cloud. But I won't come crawling to you, because you gave me away.  I'm roadside trash.

      My youth group did a haunted house for our church tonight. It was really good, we scared some of the children, and the adults too. The rooms were really well done, and everyone acted out well. I organized the event, so I'm so glad it went off well. Huzzah!  In case you were wondering, the theme was a haunted-type family murder..and you were led from bedroom to bedroom. First the children's room, where there was faint mewing to make the sound of a cat (but it was some furbies i had) and then you were led to the forgotten child's room, Samara (from the Ring). We even had the tv on playing static.  Then they were led into the parents room, where the mom(or dad depending) ran out and killed everyone, and the kids ran out, and there was a dead person at the bottom of teh stairs just before they left. It was a person from the tour group that had gone missing...   Ahh! I'm so happy it went well. Tomorow night, we're cleaning up the space. My only regret is that I never got to play necrophiliac with the dead father...:P Just to be different, and to have fun, seeing as my love life has hit a dangerously not nice stop... Oh well. There's always next year.

      Changed the comments, now they sorta match the layout. So proud it works. Typed something funny about Peter and Austin beating an American earlier, but it didn't post.  The most important part of that post was the part for Adam: You are the most best thing that has happened to me, don't disapeer. Everything will work out the way it was meant to be eventually. You are not a horrible person for falling in love with me, because then I'm just equally as bad as you for letting myself fall in love with you. One day it'll hit you, and don't let yourself regret something that you'll have thought at the time was a good idea.  I love you, Adam. :'(

      Peter and Austin are crazy. They are beating on a not-so-innocent child behind me. It's quite amusing. I've haven't done any work at all :).  Wait. The crazy child is American. That explains the beatings. They aren't that crazy after all. :)  Peter's making alphabet. And he's going to turn it into a font. Hip hip hurray!  Class is over. Bye.   PS: Adam, if you read this, you are my world and then some. Don't think stupid. !

      I don't care whether anyone is able to read this or not. I just need to blog.  I don't know whether James is out to get me or not, but lately it seems he only talks to me when he has bad news about Adam. Bad news being that Adam is back with Lenya, again. That hurts. A lot. Like a knife ripped through my heart. Because I honestly thought and felt he had ended it with her, and for good this time. To find out he's just ran away, back to her....Grawr.  And it nags me at the back of my head that maybe it's partially my fault. I mean, I was only joknig around last night about him and the hello kitty guy, but maybe he took it seriously, and thought I seriously wasn't interested in him anymore. Maybe that's what scared him back to Lenya.   I just want to shake him sometimes, tell him to wake up and smell the coffee. She's gonig to cheat on him again and again, and again until he finally exlodes. Grrrr...

      I'm not changing my archives template. Noooo fucking way. Not after this mess. And if I wasn't so attracted to the DAMN pretty colors of this new template, then it would go IN THE TRASH.  I'll also need to re-configure and add comments. Make them match my templete. Hopefully if I can get the template working today, or early tomorw, I can go into Haloscan tomorw and adjust the comments. Grooowls. I hope it works...*tear*

      Alright. Blog is sorta up and running. Can't get some of the code to work again, the thing has errors. Plus if you started this up, there's like, 800 little error messages before you start it up. Sorry about that folks..:( I had comments, just don't know where they went. Heh. When I find them I'll make sure you guys all know. Something's wrong with the code, I'll have to check out Haloscan either today or tomorw and find out. Until then, hearts, stars and horseshoes.

      Been having fun with haloscan yesterday. Changed my comments. It's gorgeous. Trying to change the templte of my blog, but the site in which I found the most goooooooooorgeous template is being a loser, and won't tell me, in simple HTML/Blogger code how to make it work. Must...find...new..one. It went with my comments so perfectly too. Eh.  Preparing to re-ban people again. Recieved not one, but now two threats on my life.  Sorry Jess, I'd like to be able to forgive you. But you started this with your friends. Get them to stop, and I will. Thanks.  Love the sexy comments you picked for me San. They are just enchanting, like your eyes ;)   And Chris, Sanford can do whatever the hell he wants on my blog, because he is the blog-god. If he feels the need to comment on a blog, then he can. In fact, he didn't barge in. He was doing what he does, comment.   Happy turkey day to you turkey slaghterers. Now I'm off to wrestle my straightener (piece of crap that it is) and to find templates. Ciao.

Me and Laura are having a Halloween movie marathon and then going to Lauren's Saturday night for her party. Then going back to Laura's for more movies. And if everything goes ok, I'll be seeing Adam too. I'm really excited, I want to see his new place, and him, no matter what happens. Sexual or not.  Not a lot of Blogging, taking the long weekend to have fun instead. See ya all on monday.  BY THE WAY, DID I MENTION? WE MIGHT BE MOVING TO BRENTWOOD!!!1*here's to hoping I can convince the parents*

       Think Different.  Here’s to the crazy ones.  The misfits.  The rebels. The troublemakers.  The round pegs in the square holes.  The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can praise them, disagree with them, quote them, disbelieve them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them.  Because they change things. They invent. They imagine. They heal.  They explore. They create. They inspire. They push the human race forward. Maybe they have to be crazy.  How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art? Or sit in silence and hear a song that’s never been written? Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?  We make tools for these kinds of people.  While some see them as the crazy ones,we see genius.   Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.     urlLink Think Different.

      groovin to tha cool beat...  no rain today. Hurrah. I had this weird dream last night that I was gonig to Fall Con, and all of today it keeps hitting me... Slept in again this morning. But there was no rain, so I'm glad I'm not swimming home. But the bad thing is adam never "contacted" me so I have no idea whats going on today. I need to talk with him. Grrrrowls.  Working on flash lots. It's kinda fun. I might do a sad love story later, in much condensed form of my life. See how that goes. Back to the grind factory.

      ..........uncontrollable laughter....  Oooooooooooh man. Today is looking to be a good day. I still can't handle Sabrina and her mass amount of retardedness, but I'm dealing with it. Amen for my thought book. But I went to Infotech today, and I just couldn't stop laughing. (Pardon me while I giggle.) Anything will set me or Peter off. Everyone around us thinks we are crazy. He brought me waffles today. I'm actaully shocked over that because no one has brought me waffles. I'm so giddy. And me and Peter have been laughing since. I wish Infotech was a year-long-course, so then we could laugh together all year long. Peter is a very special person. Special like me. Special like retarded :)  I'm still laughing. Peter's even fallen out of his chair a few times. It's just so hilarious. :) Anyways. I'd better get back to flash. Look for it on my site soon.  *giggle* Adam never emailed me. But he's moving today, so congrats hunny! Hope everything goes alright, and that everything stays as dry as it can in this weather. Lubbes!!  *bursts into laughter all over again* Michelle hates us :D

      say what?  I'm the weirdest person. I stalk boyfriends and others just to see what they'd do. I question people and dig into their sensitive spots jsut to see when and how they ticked. I shameslessely lead people on. I act half my age, and still expect people to love me. I'm the meanest person ever, and then I have the nerve to sit around and wonder why I'm not with someone, and why I'm alone Saturday night. I have a shameful dating record. 12 boyfriends and nothing to show but a few broken hearts, and a scar on my leg. I'm such a mean person.  And if I ever had the choice of picking between my boyfriend and a crush that wanted me, I would dispose of the one I loved for however long, and take up the crush, however shortlived it would be. I'm so ashamed. So exposed.  So take your pot-shots at me. I'll sit here, and take it. I deserve all of it.

      ouch.....  Need to start actually taking care of myself again. I'm not drinking nearly enough fluids, my calcium level has gone significantly down, I'm not eating breakfast and barely eating lunch, I'm not geting out for as many walks anymore (damn weather, making me be fat and lazy), and now with this abumdance of Halloween candy Mom bought me, this'll do me over. Starting either before the LDC, or right after, I'm going for walks again. I'm keeping that weight I lost over the summer off for good.  Damnit.  Or at the rate of this house warming up, maybe I'll just freeze and be healthy that way..:P

      ..missing since wednesday.....  an experience never tried before. reasurance, laughter, soaring amounts of pleasure and a bit of pain. calmly talking and explaining the whole way through. constant confirmation that it was a joint want. it was a joint need. i needed it so bad. dunno what all the hipe was about. didn't hurt, much. could walk after. was just as much as fun as anything. took me off guard. was so fast, and then..it was over.  talked and snuggles. hope what happens now is the best for everyone.  and yes, the possiblity of moving is even greater now. babysitting on sat, earning a bit extra pocket change.

      ohhh.....the movies...  I'm so tired, again right now. Trying to catch up on everything. Unfortuantly, today's fun error is freezing IE whenever I open a popup link. I know, just restart computer, but that's effort. Too lazy. Makes me think more this way.  Watched loads of movies with Laura. The ring, Blair Witch 1&2, Others, Hannibal, Casper, Hocus Pocus, Sleepy Hollow, The Craft, and Final Destination at Lauren's. Fun fun.  Stayed up way too late, feel sick now.   Hope everyone that went to Oregon had a kick ass time, I was thinking about it the entire weekend. The only good thing, was I got to have a shot or two of vodka, where I wouldn't have if I travelled to Oregon with yall.  Supposed to see Adam tomorw, hurrah for that. I also get my Sugar baby. It's going to be a girl, and I'm either going with Adam's suggestion of Aurian Elizabeth, or my own  Mayla Tayler. I'm really rather excited. And Tuesday night is youth night, so double hurrah for that. Must remember to oranize forms of transportation for that.   Anyways, my tea is running thin, and I'm passing out. Night!

      ooooooh that's just not right...  *DISCLAIMER: NOT YOUR NAME, DON'T ASSUME.*  Today, I was shocked. One of my friends was insulted in front of nearly the entire school, and I was appalled.  It was a singing competition, and my friend was pelted with oranges and apple cores. Afterwards, she freaked out, and I would have too. Blaiming the fruit on the people she didn't hang out with, the preppy/trendwhores. Someone was there listening. Someone who blaims me for being a hypocrite, and talknig behind people's backs. (Not true)  I walked into Socials. Put down my books. Heard my friend's name mentioned. Look up. See this same person telling these people about her breakdown. Calling her a dramaqueen, etc.  I was furious. Here he sat lecturing me on not doing that, and he turns around and does it himself. Is he exempt from the rules? Besides which, if you had just done something on stage, and booed, and had things thrown at you, wouldn't you be the TINIEST bit peeved? It gives you the right to rant, if not condemn the school itself.  I can't believe I even go to a school where this would happen. I was mortified. Embarrassed. I'm very much tempted to make an appeal to the student council and give the school a huge lecture of respect. Because that was the most inconsiderate thing I've seen. Not to mention the episode of the "dramaqueen" after.   ------------------ My best friend lied to me. To my face. Upsetting? Right at this point, you'll all say, wow...that sucks. There's more.  In August, we were fooling around and junk, and we talk about the fact we were virgens, blah blah. And we fooled around, knowing that it was just innocent curiosity, and stuff..something to bring us clsoer together. And when the moment happened, when we both weren't, boy, cool.  I talked to him today. Asked if I was still. Scoff. No. Asked him. No. Asked him when he did it.  End of May.  I freaked. Knowing that something so special COULD have been based on a lie, knowing that there was no limits to what we were doing, knowing...I'm hurt. It's undescribable. Although I told it to Annetta quite well.  In short, I don't know what to do. The person I trusted most in the WORLD, with everything, has suddenly gone out on me like a lamp. I'm so alone.  And even Peter's been difficult. And life with Adam has only gotten more tangled and confusing.  Two days til Con. Two days til Con. If I couldn't say that, I'd die.

At least my mom isn't sleeping onsite. I'd freak.  Reletively happy though, might get to see Adam before I leave. Have a moment of rest before all hell breaks loose with the LDC. Still no forms for HALF the people who I KNOW are going. (They've called, and said). So..makes life funner.  Been making HELLA money babysitting. It feels weird to have money. Dying my hair now :) Mystery color, for everyone.   Gotta go convince mom to help me dye my hair now. Mwwahaha....

      technology blows....  My family has finally reached the techno-era, with the purchase of a semi-crappy (better than the other one) VCR and DVD player. Of course, we only have one DVD, Ice Age, but hopefully, with my christmas list that will change.  Of course, I myself want to take a huge leap back, or at least smash the computer. The one I'm using at school has this new fun twist of FREEZING, ERRORING and LOSING ALL MY WORK. If that's not a way to get kids to stop working, then I don't know what else is. The substitute we had was driving me crazy too, which doesn't help at ALL.  Youth group is tonight. Hurray. At least Laura is coming. She understands me, and helps me feel like there is a place for me at youth. Good things. Oh well. I'm taking my camera. Hopefully trying to take 5 shots. Must..resist....urge.  Must also get a new camera for the Gingerbread making dealie, and the YAC meeting. Want/need pictures of Tsuki bird, and Steve, and Samaya, and anyone else. Muust!!  Alrighty roo, I'm out. I'm tired, and dirty. San and Erin, I miss talking to you guys....There's been a mega drift here...:( I love you guys, just remember. Until the long weekend in may....

         Your soul is bound to the  Solitary Rose : The Alone.   "When I wake up alone, the shades are still drawn on the cold window pane so they cast their lines on my bed and lines on my face."   The Solitary Rose is associated with loneliness, melancholy, and patience.  It is governed by the goddess Merope and its sign is The Sword, or Unrequited Love.  As a Solitary Rose, you may be summed up as a hopeless romantic.  You desire love and have so much love to give, but thing just never seem to work out the way you want them to.  In life, you can be very optomistic, even when things are gray and nothing works out to your expectations.    urlLink   What Rose Is Your Soul Bound To?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      C:\Documents and Settings\Asparagus Cow\My Documents\aug files 2003\,\misc\bloggy.txt  Sanford uses Wordpad, I prefer Notepad.  This weekend was a very amazing and unique experience. It was not a traditional con, in the sence that sleep was ordered and manditory. There was no spirit committee. I was in a very large leadership role, being chair of the YAC and having to organize and run elections, help run the group, etc. Samaya continued and pushed my roles too. I learned a lot of new leadership roles and positions, how to effectively run a meeting, the importance of topic dog, and more. This can help me at YAC meetings, youth group meetings, and even discussions at school - picture topic dog barking during a debate or something, and imagine everyone's confusion but mine. Mwahaha.  Sanford couldn't go, and neither could many others. Only about 30 people attended, mainly being from various parts of BC. There were 4 people from Seattle, trainers from San Jose, California and Otsega, Minasota, a DRE, youth from Victoria, North Van, Richmond, Kelowna, Bowen and Pender Island. Kevin was like a replacement Sanford, in his personality. There were major flaws between the two: Sanford has the amazing gift of healing touch and making  you instantly better, while Kevin was lacking.   And I'm sure if I pulled out the bag of marshmellows, he wouldn't understand what to do.  But I'm on the moon and no one else is :P  Learned the moom riddle, the triangle game, the bang game, and new songs. Learned great respect for others, and how to be concerned for everyone. I'm so upset that more people couldn't take advantage of the situation and attend. Then I came home and reality hit in.  Problems with the YAC elections: People are angered at Samaya and me for something we did without consulting the group as a whole. Making her feel really bad, which is something I feel bad for, because Samaya is a wonderful person. It's my fault, I want to take the fall.  Problems with youth: I'm dreading that place. Things are happening. Our group has been red-flagged, which means we might not exist soon. The group's negativity is getting me down too. I'm getting to the point where I might leave and not come back. Start a new, better group. Be happy.  Problems with Adam: Are currently being sovled. I freaked at him, we talked things through, we won't talk to each other until tomorw, where we will burst, and I will find out what he plans to do about us, and everything. I hope he does something where we are both happy..I would say right thing, but there is no right thing in this situation. I can't wait until I don't have to hide us, or anything.   The most lasting thing that will stick with me this weekend was the angelwash that we did in a cemetery. Before I bother explaining that, just picture: Moon overhead, about 11 at night, in a cemetery, chanting.  An angelwash is a very moving, spiritual, touching worship that has ever been invented. There are two lines, people on both sides. The males sing a sort of Mmmmmm mmm...low sound, and the girls sing Tra la la la la la la la la, Tra la la la la la,  and repeat. Slowly, a person on each end goes through the middle of the line with their eyes close, and the people on each end hug, touch, whisper words of encouragement, and sometimes even kiss the person going through, until they reach the end.  Picture that in your mind. Picture how moving it was in a cemetary.  We also went out before to see the lunar eclipse. That was a really unique, awesome sight on it's own.  I'd like to close now, with my favorite song learned this weekend. I'll be singing it forever, and Alicia, I'd like to know how you found it, and who it's by and stufflies...  **** When I was younger Oh they told me I was wrong to be strong Wrong to be strong  Now I'm older And I tell them That I've been giving away my power For far too long  Now I'm taking it back Now I'm taking it back Taking it back back back  Because it's mine  Now I'm taking it back Now I'm taking it back Taking it back back back  Because it's mine ****  Blessed be all..

      the world is so bleak...  Days go by and still I think of you. Sitting here in class, sipping orange juice, listening to Garbage and Radiohead, and eating the occasional pretzel. Thinking.   Checked my email today, always the first thing I do when I get to class. Got an email from Adam. I was half hoping in my heart, that he'd never get it, and we'd continue acting as we do. But he has gotten it.  Said it's taken him a long time to figure it out, and put down the words to say. I've already emailed him back, but once again I wish I had waited a few more minutes, to tell him to forget the email, call me, hug me, kiss me, love me.   Sting - Fragile  Every day I wake up, and the first thing that hits my head is, The Email. Wondering why I sent it. Why? Because it was my thoughts, and they had to be said. And this time it wasn't effective enough to put the words down on paper. I had to send the email. I couldn't even blog it.  As much as I love him, and want to be with him for the rest of my life, these issues have to be sorted through. We are always saying we'll get to them, and sort them out, but then we get sidetracked, a word of someone's beauty, or worth, and instantly off-topic. Like we need a topic dog for our conversation. It's awful.  I've told Laura that we're through, but I still can't admit it to myself. He plagues my dreams, my everything, and I don't know what to do. I'm stuck.  Sarah McLaughlin - Angel  I need him. Bad. Somehow, I need to see him, to talk to him, to express myself in spoken text rather than written. Even a simple phone call could work. While webcamming. You could see my tears, exasperation, love, and hear it too.  You are always so limited when you are confined to writting your words. Like our relationship, friendship, whatever, is confined to a little box in the play room.   I'm so confused. Laura says, "Get someone else to take your mind off of it." And I've tried. But how can you snuggle up to someone and not think of Adam? I'm lost, and useless now.    Rave - Jungle Underground

      ........what does she know?   I'm worried. I've been rather gushing and weird lately, to someone's sister, to mainly gross her out. But it's occured to me that she might know stuff. That her brother might be telling her stuff. That what she speaks is true. But she won't tell me what she knows. If she knew what he and me had shared, done, maybe then she'd realize. But how to ask without telling?  It's hit me. He's been acting like his friend. Using me for sexual purposes. I hated it the first time, and I won't like it this time. I'm so worried.   Maybe my love is based on a lie.

      What?  I've been forgotten.  Is that even possible? If you've ever been around me for a substaintial amount of time, (substantial being an hour) you'd realize that I am very loud, and very near unforgettable. But lately, that seems to be the opposite.  My socials teacher forgot me and Laura today. Loudest, most irratiting kids in the class. How do you forget us? He never, ever picks us to read, always skips over us. He forgot to give us the case study today, and I freaked out at him.  There are people on my MSN list I never talk to. I'll strike up a convo, and they'll be like, "Who's this loser"? And I'll be crushed.  Two people that mean a lot to me never talk to me anymore, not more than the Hi, how are you thing. I miss the days where I could have detailed convos with people.  I never have good long convos with people anymore, unless it's Adam. We'll talk about anything, really. But with anyone, the convo just dies. I used to have such animated happy ones, that made me want to sign on and stay on for hours. I stay on for hours now, but for the anticipation of people coming to talk.   It makes me sad inside. If I lived at school, I could be talking to people all day long and never go home, and never ever stop talking to people. Luckily I babysit saturday, 8-6, so that's a few good hours of converstation with Ayla.    My calgary friends have forgotten all about me, to venture to China to find chapstick and hairbrushes.

      i love seminar day.  It's the most slacker of days. Teachers can't teach anything important, otherwsie they'll have kids behind. And the seminars are so dull themselves.  Today I had safe driving, where, in my class, we did a quiz on safe driving, then talking about Constable Nolan's weapons. I got to play with real handcuffs and batons :P  Then I had stress management, in the most comfortable of chairs. Totally promoting sleeping. That ended 30 minutes early, so to keep us out of the hallways, Mr Hardcastle led us through a guided meditation. It was so relaxing, I thought I had fell asleep. It was delicious.  Just as I suspected, Adam is working tomorw after all, so I won't get to see him. What a surprise. Also found out that I'm working all Saturday, 8-6. Wahhoo..  Sad thing is, I spent so long on my hair and makeup and what I would wear for tomorw, even though I knew it was probably going to flop. I'm such a dramaturgy freak.

      Changed blogger template. Green wasn't really going with me. Might find old template and revert back to that. My old one. The one they don't make anymore. We'll see.  Took a while to edit this one. Had to add in the comments, and jippy code, and the links, and tinker with the way it archives and shows posts. Not totally satisfied with the archival system, but it will have to do. I'll change it later.  And when I am big and powerful, and am sitting next to an HTML/Blogger master, I'll change the colors, and that will be cool.

      That's right...  I just found out that two people I don't normally agree or speak with on a regular basis, read my blog. They haven't slandered it, for which I am grateful, but I have heard one for them got mad when I wrote about them.  Kinda makes me insecure, knowing they read it during class, knowing that others might have read it, but hey! If they find my life this interesting.  At least they aren't filling the comments with slander.

      Dododododo...  Went to Vancouver this weekend to hang out with everyone, have a meeting, and make gingerbread houses.   We were about 5 hours late, we were supposed to start at 12, but started at 6. We had to make the icing, get the stuff for the icing, set it up, then move it, vote on dinner... We played games.   Went to the meeting. Laughed a lot. Something I needed. Thinking up ideas for the BC newsletter, and someone suggested spUUning, like CanUUdle.. (read below post). Samaya lost it. For about 10 minutes. By then, the whole group had lost it watching her, and were laughing histericly with her. We surprisingly got a lot done in the 3 or so hours.  We were constantly breaking because the rest fo the youth were gonig insane with nothing to do, and no adult supervising them. Ever so often Samaya had to remind them we were meeting, and they didn't need to sound like raging hippos up and down the hallway. Then....they were quiet. Scary quiet. We thought they had died, but we didn't go check.  Then they came back inside, and they started doing weird things to our door. Guy was back and had shepared them indoors. Samaya anticipated them coming back, and crouched down by the door to scare them. Steve and Karla came in, and just started talking to her like it was normal for Sam to sit by the door during a meeting. They said they thoguht that's what she did....  After the meeting, we left the houses and played some more games. We hung around upstairs while downstairs was being prepared for worship, then went downstairs for that. (I also have a lot of pictures of Samaya, the same person who was hiding from the mug book committee at Winnipeg) We did a good worship on discrimination, and positive thoughts, then gathered around the couches for a big game of silent football. I love playing silent football with Alicia, Samaya and Laurel. They make the game so interesting, while when we play it at youth, it's boring. You actually play the football part. It's dull. There's no excitement.   That was a rocking game. An hour and a half of it was discusing life outside the universe, and Alicia kicking and sticking her tongue out at laurel. Twas hilarious. There was an epsiode where Samaya got penance point for bouncing, and then the major issue of making Mr Humphreys, the bi-sexual camel, humping Samaya's leg...He didn't like that. Then I got him. He is a rocking camel, I must say. He has the sweetest big brown eyes, who can't love that? We were being goofy, and snuggling, and then Katrina declared that Mr Humphreys was now straight, and madly in love with me. I didn't want to leave my precious boyfriend, but, I've emailed him lots since.   At bedtime I made a lame joke. During the meeting we were discussing why people had sex at cons, because they might not see each other again. When I was snuggling on the couch, I asked Laurel for some condoms because I was gonig to have rocknig sex with Mr Humphreys, because we might not see each other again. We laughed :P  Sunday morning we finished the houses. Mine totally rocked the casbah, and then I got to play in the nursery with Phil and Tsuki, and Hot Scott, when he came in for a bit. We got to take care of 3 boys, Simon, Blake and Steel. They were all sooo cute..  My gingerbread house completely fell apart in Victoria though. And Mike says we're doing the same thing at his palce Saturday, but Tom said Fiona, Greg and I couldn't go, because we already had a gingerbread house, even though it did fall apart. Discrimination at its best.   Seminar day tomorw, and I'm probably going to go see Adam on his day off on Thursday. Comfort time. Dododo. Also might change the way I am, see how many males aren't scared off. Don't think I'll succeed for more than 20 minutes though. I'll drink to trying.  I'm out. And sexy.

      Oh man oh man oh man oh man.   "Shit shit, the missiles are coming! Fire our shit!" "But I am le tired...." "Well, fine, go take a nap.....THEN GO FIRE THE MISSILES!"   urlLink http://members.cox.net/impunity/endofworld.swf    That is the funniest thing ever. Seriously. I've died laughing so many times.  In other news, my cat thinks she has gone wiiiiiiiild.  I put up our christmas tree a couple a days ago, nearly killed me. Now, she hides underneath the tree and hunts imaginary birds. If you are still long enough, you can see the tree shake a little, as she goes insane. Mind you, if you get to close to the tree, she'll shoot out from underneath it like a grey furry rocket.  I don't know what she'll do when we put the decorations on the tree. I don't really want too, it's way to funny watching her "hunt" things that aren't even there.   Today was my first day at school. I felt like dying during my first block, I was so tired, and dizzy feeling. But as the day wore on I felt better. Most of second block was spent standing building a computer, so I had to get used to it. By socials I was my normal bouncy-ish self. Of course, I sound sick, I'm coughing like MAD, and I can't squeak (really eerie) but hey! I'm alive :)  Laura's drawing a house. It's so pretty :)

      I is sick. Mom says it's flu, I say it's near hell. Hell was June, with tonsilitis/strep. I'm either hot or cold, extreme in both. I'm currently very warm, sweaty, and probably stinky too, but I can't help that. Went to school yesterday, went home around 3rd block, couldn't stand to be there. Wanted to go to bed.  And mom went hunting through my purse for whatever reason and found my bc pills. I won't buy it because those are in the secret compartment, and they can't "fall out" of there. I'm feeling pretty violated right now, and she said something really lame about it too last night. I was begining to fase out, so I barely remember. All I know was that it's lame. And my parents are probably not to impressed. I feel like I've let my dad down, hugely. He was so disappointed..I mean, he was proud of me for being responsible, but.he doesn't understand. It sucks.  I'm sooooooo warmm...And theres's no one to talk to. *tear* You people are mean.  Upset.

      Jess, my hair is beautiful and I love it.   Saw Return of the king today with brother and his friend. Will comment on the sheer amazingness later. It was sheerly amazing. Didn't have a thought for three and a half hours. Beautiful. Head hurts :( Also dunno how I'm going to get to Vancouver next week. Pllaaaahh... I sincerly hope Mike goes. As our other Adult yac member, he has a responsiblity to go, and if he doesn't....he's costing me an exstra $25 to go....*growls* Damn well better go.  I'm tired. Cranky. Happy. Warm. Lonely. Horny. I'll blog later. Must call fiona.

      Interesting.  So dying my hair was interesting. Needless to say, it did not turn out electric blue as I had hoped, but a very interesting green... in areas, my hair is blue, green, blonde and brown. Depends on how you look at it and how I wear it. Mostly in braids, because the color stays mostly blue and green that way. I have plans though. After it washes out some, I'll re-blonde it, then dye it dark and light blue. Maybe streak it purple. Keep it interesting. I can't believe how un-dyeable my hair is though. We ran out of blonde before we did hair. Oh well. Whatever.  Laura's planning on redding her hair, so maybe before the New Year's party we'll color it up together. Heeey...what an idea. We were just saying how much we wanted to do another marathon..what about a hair-dying-movie-marathon with New year's!!!! Must...Email..Laura!!  Anyways, Merry christmas ya'll out there, have a happy, think of me :) and I'll be bloggin when I get the chance. Chow!

      Grrrr... It bothers me...   A few weeks back, or...two weeks, whatever, I was talknig to my mom in the kitchen about what a cool fundraising idea I had. Seeing as there are so few youth wanting to go to Edmonton (Three out of twenty kids), there isn't gonig to be any money, really, given to us Edmonton-ers. So we have to earn it. And I had the cool idea about making hemp necklaces and bracelets and selling those. They are so popular right now, really neat, and everyone wants one...  Mom shot it down, saying no one would buy them, blah blah, waste of time, blah. Said to sell them to my friends. Told her, heh....everyone has them already... So I assumed (heh) that since she was so negative about it, to forget about it. And I did.  So for Chirstmas I asked for hemp and beads cause I was running low and I wanted some. And I received. Two balls of regualer hemp, two smaller things of black hemp (really cool) and three packages of beads. I was estathic. I immediatly start making things, and first thing mom says is what a waste of the beads, blah blah, so expensive, blah. Okay..I was a little taken aback.  Then today, I babysat Ayla, and I brought over the bead and hemp box cause I know she likes doing that stuff. We made a lot, and had fun. And that's what it's really all about, isn't it? Mom freaked out, saying that's not why she bought the hemp and beads, blah blah, what about fundraising, blah...  Excuse me? I thought they were Christmas gifts for me. Seeing as you never said anything when I opened them, or when you wrapped them...why bother? Or were you too focused on yourself to care about my presents? Sorry I got the wrong impression...  Grawl! I really dislike my mom in situations like this. And if you think I was self centered for saying that they were too focused on them selves than me, well, take it back. Every year since I can remember, we opened presents one at a time, in a circle to see what each person got. This year, mom, dad and Greg opened presents at complete random, were all talking to each other, while I sat in my corner, with my presents, waiting for my turn to come around, if it was. Some of the stuff I got Mom and Dad and Greg were never aware I got. So pardon me if I seem a bit self centered.  I really hate this. I really do. Why does everything I do, with the intent to do well turn out horridly? Everything. My efforts to fundraise, communicate with my friends via email, efforts to try and score a boyfriend, motivation to get youth group, everything. Failed.  FYI, for those who care, I'm not going to youth group after Feb 12. Fiona made me promise to stay until she leaves, and that's exactly what I intend to do.

      Year in review..........   I don't know what to say. This year though, has been tough. Very tough. Lots of life-defining moments..  January and Febuary were spent in...some form of interest in Ash. Being with him. Every. minute. of. the. day. It got quite dull. And finally in Febuary, it was over. I couldn't stand it, and there.   16th birthday was spent at the Cadet Valentine dance hanging out with my husband (long story) and a very attractive, nice guy. An ex was there, looknig stunningly hot, but I don't care.  March...Fundraising for Winnipeg. Most of the winter was doing that.  April was finalizing travel plans, and trying to get with the stunning creature I met at the dance. May was spent trying to continue this effort, before finally giving up. There were a few short re-consiliation efforts with Ash, only lasting a day or two. Boredom.  Then off to Winnipeg. Mind transforming. Seeing Alex. Erin. Sanford. Samaya. Laurel. Everyone. Planning, thinknig, marshmellow fights. Then 4 days at home, then off to Vancouver. Meetings, hair coloring, and Kelty.   June, paying for my two weekends in travel. Sick combination of strep/tonsilitis. Absolutely awful experience. Making up a month's worth of work in two days. Passing.  July....chilling with Josie and hanging around with the group. Water fights at Centennial. Then drying out.  August with Lannie. Making new friends with Tyler, James and Adam. Fooled around with James a bit. Biking with Tyler and hanging out with an awesome person. Adam.  September, new school year. Change in lifestyle. Medication. Lusting/Loving someone forbidden.  October, acting on lust drive. Fantastic. Life changed.  November. Conferences, meetings, and still chasing. Lost many a friend here...mood changes? Party..  December......no serious love interest still....communication, hanging out, partys, and...consoling.  This year was a huge change in me. And I've come to some decisions...and resolutions for the new years.. 1. Try to bring back some happiness to ex-friends and others, random goodness day 2. Stop chasing someone who is obvisously bad at choosing.....if he hasn't by now, he never will.  And I will leave you all with this...   ...We have familier experience of the order, the constancy, the perpetual renovation of the material worl which surrounds us. Frail and transitory as is every part of it, restless and migratry as are its elements, still it abides. It is bound together by a law of permanence, and though it is ever dying, it is ever coming to life again. Dissolution does but give birth to fresh modes of organization, and one death is the parent of a thousand lives. Each hour, as it comes, is but a testimony how fleeting, yet how secure, how certain, is the great whole. It is like an image on the watesr, which is ever the same, though the waters ever flow. The sun sinks to rise again; the days is swallowed up in the gloom of night, to be born out of it, as fresh as if it has never been quenched. Spring passes into summer, and through summer and autumn into winter, only the more surely, by its own ultimate return, to triumph over that grave towards which it resolutely hastened from its first hour. We mourn the blossoms of May because they are to wither; but we know that May is one day to have its revenge upon November, by the revolution of that solemn circle which never stops - which teaches us in our height of hope, ever to be sober, and in our depth of desolation, never to despair. The Exorcist, William Peter Blatty.

      Oh god no...  Life has taken, what I have noticed, three great spins. And I am also noticing I number things often :)  Firstly: Happy 17th Birthday Kellina, too bad you'll be too busy to care.       My birthday is next month, and during the same weekend, is a huge conference. My youth group is planning the youth part, and I've signed up to do as much as humainly could, trying to take over what Fiona would do too. This includes getting youth and organizing them Friday night, running a workshop Saturday morning, continuing that workshop throughout the afternoon, youth worship Saturday night, and helping to staff the youth room in between, and probably more. Now I have a meeting to go to with my YAC (the BC YAC) Friday night (somewhere) and a joint meeting sometime on Saturday. They are talknig about going to the church (almsot 20 minutes away from the Empress, where the conference is held) for the meetings, but my head is swimmmmming thinking on how I'm going to get back and forth. Grawwwahhh... I'm trying to get it all out of the way, and done with, as soon as I can, and arrange a schedule for myself for what I have to do. There's always so much pre-meeting stuff I have to do before a meeting, and there's pre-con prep, and post-con clean up..Gah! I'll die now.    Secondly: I am suffering from Snooping-mother syndrome.       My mother has a new hobby now. As much as I support her hobbies, I do NOT for this one. This one is gonig through my room, my personal stuff, finding my hiding spots, and searching for ANYTHING. There does not seem to be a pattern for what she is trying to find. It's getting ridiculous. Even the things I have in my locked box I have feared she has seen...It's awful. I have no private space anymore. It's getting to be a matter of time before she goes on my XP account on the computer and gose through my files and favorites. I'm waiting.      Of course, when she does that, I'll play "virus" with her computer, and move out. There is nothing funny at all about losing your privacy. None.    Thirdly: Wedding bells...       I have been invited as Tyler's date to his brother's wedding at the end of the month. I am nervous. I've already re-dyed my hair for it. I figured blue/green hair, as much as I loved it, would be kinda bad to have. I bleached it again, it's really blonde now. (And Laura's is glooooriously red!) I'm still nervous. I dunno what his family is like. I dunno what to wear. I don't have anything to wear. I'm so nervous. Doesn't help that I have con junk to do as well. *breeeeeathe*      The only fun part would be telling Adam and seeing his reaction. Mwahaha...I'm so evil.

      Multiple things.   First: Celine. And Adam. And that. Part of my New Year's resolution, the other half. Stop chasing after certain someone.  It was hard. There's a long story in which only Jess and Tami know, and that's how it's gonna stay for a while. It's complicated. And for the reason that Jess, Tami and me know, it's hard to let Adam go. I've been trying though. Since September, I haven't allowed myself so even look at another guy in a romantic way, because I figured it would be...wrong or something. I dunno. Something he said. Plus because him and Lenya were alwaaaaays getting in fights, and they would be on and off, I didn't really wat to be tied down..I wanted him. Bad. Whenever I mentioned a guy, he would act jealous and sad,...so I just didn't allow myself to look.  Lately, since the break, I have. There's several guys I wouldn't mind being with right now, and even though some of them are hoooorribly un-practical and un-realistic, I still dream. It feels different, almost exhilerating. It's wonderful. I feel alive again.   And I've come the realization that Lenya is a real person. With feelings. I've always thought of her as an evil, cheating, unloving bitch that was out to hurt Adam and destroy him (and maybe turn him to men instead of me :'( ) But I've read some stuff about her, and I've read some stuff she's posted, and I realize that she's human, like me. She has feelings. And now that I'm realizing that, I think it's time for me to step away and let them be. Not because I want Celine to feel like she's won, caause I have, but...  Adam's been distant. Moody. Different. The last time I talked to him, he made me soo upset because he didn't like my hair ( and was telling me too) and downcast my already really shitty day. Then he started ragging on me for making a comment on his sister, then just left. It was upsetting. And I think we've grown apart, gone distant since that blustery day in October (and I thought then it was cold.) It's hard to get used it.  Second....It snowed :D:D:D:D Holy monkeys, this is the most snow I've ever seen since the Blizzard of good ol 96 :P I went over to Ayla's and we spent the entire afternoon toboganning...I've never done it before today, and hoooooooly I had fun :P Krista and Ayla and even Karen when she was out were laughing at me when I went down. Cause I tend to scream :) And they captured it all on video camera. It was fantastic :) Today was a good day. After that, we had cocoa, and watched CSI and some of Blade. Great day. :) I should have put toboganning as first. It's better.

      Rave for a Rant.  Rave: Best day ever today. Of the new year, at least. I woke up and I got dressed. I wore my new shirt ($7 brand new at the Gap *STEAL!*) and my new shirt and my black pants and I felt so ..elegant and pretty. Math was good, we got to play games. Info tech was good, I got to play games and goof off. I spent lunch with Laura in the library working. Psych was good, I goofed and walked around the school and chillaxed. Socials I tortured the teacher and was totally off teh wall hyper. I think I made him think I belong in an institute for teh mentally unstable (and I do! :P). It was sunny and warm outside, and I was so overjoyed, I skipped home. I did lots of my homework, got lots done, and went online. Tyler, the best guy ever is taking me out for ice cream on Saturday, for no real reason, just to be sweet and random ( and I think he's gonig to ask me out....squee!) and I'm overjoyed and hyper.  I also formed LOL today. League Of Losers. :) Mwahhahahahahahahahhahahahaha  My rant? There are growing numbers of people who have my blue hair. Trend whores. Even if mine's more green. Pleh!  I'm gonig to go SPIN now! YAY!!!

      I HATE MONDAYS.  I was wearing my RADICALLY AWESOME new shoes today, and I walked into the school, promptly slipped on the STUPID gravel floor, and scraped and messed up my foot. I have been limping all day, and been grouchy, and keep banging my toe. And I can't get my foot in a comfortable position. It hurts. And I'm sad.  Stupid mondays.

      Minature Pink Carnations.   With the ringings of a new year, things change.  Things from the old year become obsolete, forgotten. Boys/girls you wanted kiss and date, wars with eneimies to be healed. Changes to start anew come about, and begin to develope. Some of these things are good, and bring good to others. Others are good for one, but bad for the rest.   And then comes me. Even though I want to go more than anything else in the world, I fear, because of the lack of fundraisign effort, that I will not make it to Edmonton this year. My highlight of my life, taken away, if you will. Because as you see, connecting with Canadian UU's is way better than going to the PNWD. We have ways to go, a lady at our Neighboorhood group told us that the youth at Calgary had a bottle drive - perhaps we'll start that here.   I've made a lot of friends since my trip to Kelowna. Lots. And I try my hardest to stay in touch with them, email, MSN, snail, and eventually, blog. So I can at least know what's going on with them, and be there when it appears someone is needed. My soul right now, is even in Calgary, with one of my friends.  And with the new year, they feel the need to move on. I don't blame them. Start memories anew. Unfortuanatly, that means I can't keep up with them. I'm locked in a corner nobody sees, until around the beginning of May to the approximate end of summer. A seasonal friend.  And then I realize how self-centered this sounds, and hit myself for it.   Better days and weeks wished upon you Sanford and Erin. Maybe I'll see you this year.

      So ultimately it's been a while. I've been busy with life, last minute Cascadia prep, junk like that. On the 31, I went to Tyler's brother's wedding and that was fun. We stayed for the reception, then Tyler's family and I went out to Moxie's for dinner. After that, Tyler, Brooke and I went to go see The Butterfly Effect, which was really good. I really enjoyed it.  Been planning stuff for my birthday, cascadia, and Fiona's leave...It's tough. Been babysitting a lot too, so. I'll have to update later.  Blogging has become a hazard here at school...the substitue keeps walking around and looknig at what everyone's doing, and I'm finding it hard to check and write emails, and blog when she is constantly watching. She also doesn't know a thing about computers. She wants me to stop listening to my music because it's using up bandwidth.....when I'm just listening to a cd...Growl.  Anyways, life's threatening. Keep in mind I love the guy, and I love my life, and I know, somewhere, the interesting twist will be there.  Not to mention the youth group actually has close to $700, not $200...but let's not tell Mike that.

      Boredom..  I'm at school waiting for my photos to upload onto my Yahoo photos, and for presentations to attach themselves onto emails to send home.  Technology at school has hit a standstill, I was kicked off one of the fast, good computers and now I sit on one of the slowest computers in history, the cd player skips if someone walks by, or if the comouter is thinking too much, and even the simplest of tasks becomes a mountain of challanges. It bytes.  I've just been handed the form that my group will submit to the teacher to be able to film our movie, "Life after the Couch". Hopefully he'll approve it without asking what we will specifically do, because otherwise we're screwed. One of my parts is to be a casual hooker, walking by :) My other parts include director of filming and sound, and then we all get to edit it.   Last night, MSN was having difficulties with its server and technology, and as a result, MSN Messenger was down most of the night. This angered me, and it angered a lot of my friends, because we all wanted to talk, and we couldn't. Hotmail was luckily working, and lots of time was spent madly sending off emails back and forth to each other. Hearing everyone's stories today made me realize that a lot of people are now sickly reliant on the computer and the internet to talk to friends, family and co-workers. Neighboors rely on it. Best friends. Family. What ever happened to picking up the phone and calling them? Going over to their house and visiting them? I suppose the convience of being able to talk to more than one person at the same time lures people into the chatware cult, and prevents them from functioning like our families did not too long ago. No one wants to go outside, no one wants to play with their friends and build forts and dream about faroff lands, no one wants to breakout the legos and have a darn fun time with their imagination. It's sickening.  Sanford, I'm glad I got to talk to you last night, and I'm glad you decided to stick around with us on Earth for a bit longer.

      It hurts.  I can feel the throb inside od my intensify as I think of him.  Think of all our fun.  Think of the emotions we share, our goofyness.  It was commented yesterday, why we haven't begun to date...He's the perfect boyfriend, we go out on the dates, but there is no commitment.  But I find it hard to try and focus on other guys when all I want his him.  He's not a looker, he's the exact physical opposite of a guy I could love. But he's the best.  Last weekend I thought was the best time I've ever spent with him. Now, yesterday was the best, sitting on that cliff, gazing at the water below, at the Malahat across from us, hot chocolate.. perfect.  He said his friend had asked why aren't we together? And my friends ask the same.  Now that I'm home, and I thought, why not?  Why not?  My heart throbs at each beat thinking of him, laughing in the truck, trying to find our way out of the maze of roads.  I wish we had never left.

      (taken from a note written to Laura)  Hey Laur,  I really dislike english again. I hate how my fav subject has turned into something I slowly dread. Whenever I open my mouth to speak, I feel that what I'm saying is totally wrong. The looks on the faces of the students around me, and the expression on the teacher's face makes me feel that I'm babbling pure nonsence. My answers are always completely different than anyone else's. Sometimes I think I only get good marks on my stuff because my teacher jsut doesn't understand what he's reading. I feel like I'm speaking in a foreign tongue, and no one understands me, not even Kimmie and Steve. Even they can't comprehend what I'm trying to say, write or do. Whenever we have the grammer contests, our group always gets points, and always stays on top, but that's only because I come up with the weirdest things that totally throw the teacher off course, and baffle him. He gives us points for effort.  Once, I was stunning. Anything I wrote got full attention and my teacher was appaled at my style. But I've lost that touch somehow, or the teachers have gotten too cynical over time. They see the overachevers, the wanna-bes, and the real achievers, and just figure they are all wanna-bes, all posers, with no real talent. It's truelly sad how one little letter can really decrease your self confidence, and faith in yourself. Ever since I got that letter from the school, I hardly write anything other than in my blog. I used to spout out something each night. I've lost it Laura. I've gotta run, time's running out and I have to zip out a persuasive paragraph about driving that's due in about 10 minutes. See ya in a bit. Love, kellina.

      I hate it when I try to be unique, and everyone dyes their hair blue too. Seriously. What a bunch of losers.   Today was a good day. Hopped on a bus after school and went to see one of my favorite con people, Alex. We explored Victoria, around areas I've never been to before. It was wild. We talked for a while about all sorts of things. He's a very thought provoking person, he asks questions that make you think. But it was nice to talk to someone about CUC stuff, and too see what's going on in other districts and stuff. I loved it. He's still soooo cute, too, but now he's got the scruffy un-shaven look, which is dead sexy. He let his hair grow out again, which is awesome, cause he looks so much hotter with it longer. I'm glad I got to see him, I would have lost my mind, and now I really can't wait to see him, and San, and Erin, and Ellen and everyone else at Edmonton this year.   I royally fucked things up with Tom last night I think. Even though he was acting pretty cool today, like nothing happened,  like he does, I know something did. I can tell that it eats at him too. Last night we talked about his lonliness, and I told him about what Samaya said, and he was sorta shocked at that I guess. But like, I brought up about us, and how it was sorta a shame we "flung" in the summer, cause now we both want the same things, and Samaya's always right about these things....I've never seen her wrong. I know I freaked out Tom after that, cause he didn't talk, and then said he had to go... Nothing like me seeming desperate to kill a conversation, even though he was dying of lovelessness the entire conversation. I dunno. I just *love* ruining things for me. I would have to, because I seem to do it a lot.  The memories will always live inside my head, and I will cherish them. So don't waste your time on me, you're already a voice inside my head (I miss you...)

      Hurray for love...  This weekend was Cascadia, the long awaited mess of a conference. Friday was pretty..I dunno. It was spent waiting for Samaya and everyone else to arrive. It all started with me and greg going over to the Ippens (and seeing Tom's massive bedroom, I'm envious of his monster sized bed..:'( ) and then Mike, me, Tom, dan, Tony, Tom R and Greg all drove down to the Empress to get there at 4 to open the youth room. The room was pretty big, it had a nice TV which we later found out got cable. Katrina and a few other youth arrived, and everyone explored throughout the Empress, riding on the elevators, blah blah, it was a extreme lot fo fun. Alicia and Tsuki arrived around 6-ish and that was awesome, cause I haven't seen Tsuki in a while and I miiiiissed her. I was asked to hold our church banner for the banner parade, and that was actaully a lot of fun. I love banner parades :) I almost misted up when I saw Dymtro and Dan holding our banner, even if it did disapeer for the rest of the weekend. By the time I left at 9.30ish, Samaya still hadn't shown up. Even though I was worried bonkers.  Saturday invovled getting up and getting there at 8.45, fairly early, but Mike hadn't arrived yet and so the room wasn't open. Samaya, Tsuki and Jenna and Laurel arrived during the night, and I said hi to them all in the morning. It was nice to see Samaya, I had missed her. We had a meeting at around 10, and got about half our stuff done before we broke and I had to go upstairs to run my valentine making workshop. Tons of gorgeous valentines were produced, it was awesome. Then we all took off for lunch, and some to play pool at Peacocks. Then me and Laura left to go to my house, then her house, then Sabrina's house, back to the conference center in two hours. It was fun, I enjoyed seeing Sabrina again. :) Then me and Laura stayed, and I walked around with Katherine and Tom in some gorgoeous places in the Empress, it was fun :) Then me and Laura took off for Bead World and the comic book store. We came back and watched Remember the Titans, which is an awesome movie. Then we broke for pizza dinner, and then came back to watch the rest of the movie, which made me cry a little, even though Andrew and Laura were making fun of me. Andrew was hitting on Laura!!! I hope they get married, cause he's cute, and they'd be cute together. Then we ran downstairs and the gropu soooorta planned out worship, and me and Tsuki left, not knowing how horrible it would be when we got back. It was worrysome.  The meeting was pretty fun, but we only had two hours, 30 mins were taken up by checkin, another 30 by some random guy talking about PNWD affairs that we didn't really care about, and thank gosh, Kyle spoke up and the guy left. We accomplished a lot in our remaining hour, and I sprung on the YAC ten minutes before worship that they were helping with it. I went down to worship a few minutes later and saw this gorgeous transformed theater. The group had organzied everything so excellently, where to have everyone to sit, an improvised chalice, it made me tear up. Even if there were only 28 people for worship, it was still pretty radical. I ran around afterwards giving everyone hugs and thanking them. Eli (who, btw, is super cute along with Rob and Andrew) gave me a super deep speicial hug too, that just calmed me down and relaxed me. Then I ran back upstairs with Eli and Rob to our meeting and finished it up in just 15 minutes. It was beautiful. We headed back to the conference center to be blasted by music, and I ran up to join in with everyone to dance, because the youth got it going again (which was AWESOME!!) There was a slow song, and me and Laura attacked Tom, and we three-way danced that song, and it was soooo good! Tom is such a clown, I can't remember when it was when I had laughed so much. Then Samaya and Tsuki and Jenna were leaving, and somehow the topic of Tom (like at our last meeting...ullg.) was brought up again, and Samaya said that we would make a cute couple, and that we should go out, and I said..uhh.. and then just before she left she said that he would make a great husband for me and she would be sad if we didn't get married....Tom'll have fun at Seabeck this year, I can tell you that.  We danced more and more until like, midnight, and then the youth disappeered when it was time to leave and me and Tom freaked out at them when they returned, cause it was dumb of them.  Overall, the weekend was a complete and utter success, I'm so impressed, I'm throwing our youth a party for all they did, even though Samaya insists that it was all me and Mike, and mostly me who pulled this weekend off. (I love Sam so much when she makes me feel pretty :) ) I still want to though, the youth did a fantastic job. And I'm contemplating telling Tom about our forseen future..oO. Right. Anyways, I'm out. I'm so exhausted. And I'm trying to remember what Mike and I were discussing when we needed the Y-FUUD grant..>

      I have something like a fallen arch on my foot. In any case it hurts like FUCK. So I have to wear a tensor bandage until I get some fancy insoles or something.  On the plus side, I'm seeing Return of the King with everyone, have made a pretty few pennys babysitting, and....  I GOT STAFF AT CUC THIS YEAR!!!  Now if only Fiona was here to revel in my success..:'(

      It all started with a phone call.  Well, actually, it started with an idea at youth group, that finally worked itself into the grand supremo...  Around...five-ish, the phone rang. Everyone here was on their tails, for the legendary Samaya was supposed to make an appearance at our house (but never did.) I answered, and it was some lady asking for "Mrs Dyer". I figured, due to the static I heard, that it was some solicitor, and I decided to get Mom's hopes up and tell her it was for her. I listened for a few minutes, only hearing, "Hi, it's Hilary...". Figuring it was someone from church, I soon forgot about it.  A few minutes later, Mom came to the computer and told me to get off. I didn't hear her, so I said, what? and she just repeated what she had said, and walked off. She never told me why, so I thought, screw it, and kept talking. A few minutes after that, Mom opened the door, and Kim barrels into the hallway, followed by Laura and everyone else. I just kept repeating, "What? What?" and went out to the hall to see who was all there. There was Kim and Laura, and Nana and Karissa, and Steve, and on the porch were Matt, Nick and Sean.. I grabbed my shoes and went out with them all, and hopped in the van with Mrs Planden, Laura, Kim, Karissa, Nana, and Matt. The others went in Sean's car, and went to get gas.   Soon after driving off, we realized that Sean didn't know where he was going (and neither did I!) so we set off to find his car at a gas station. We saw them in Petrol Canada by Elk Lake, and waited for them, and said hi to Arthur who was working. then we all took off, me still in complete mystery, as their order. We talked and laughed, and finally ended up at Romeo's, in Broadmead. we ordered our food, and while it took a long time to arrive, we had Kim for our entertainment. She was just like a little child while eating, except I almost think the kids are better behaved than she is. Even Nick was behaving himself better...  After a delicious dinner, we waited outside for our ride. We entertained the diners by goofing off, and chasing each other. Nick was picking some of us up and running around. Finally Mrs Planden showed up to take us home. Laura ran inside to get me a coat, cause I was too rushed to get one when we left home, and we set out for the video store and Spelts, to get movies and candy. We rented Shallow Hal, and Laura bought Ghost and the Darkness for herself, and Artificial Intelligence (my favorite movie) for me. Then we went to Spelts, where we all got lots of candy. We walked back to the house with laughter, and it was awesome.  When we went inside, Kim and Laura covered my eyes, and led me downstairs. There I saw a bunch of presents for me, and a huuuge giant card. I got a bag of jumbo beads, sea animal beads, star beads, regular AND FAT hemp (Which I was trying to buy earlier that day :p) all three Lord of the Rings soundtracks, a Beauty and the Beast Lollipop thing, and Birthday Bear Care bear.  :) After that, we went upstairs for strawberry mousse birthday cake (which was really yummy) and Nick entertained us all with his water drinking talents...I couldn't blow out the candles on my cake cause I was laughing so hard, but it didn't matter, Kim blew one out for me , because she was getting impatient :) (Everyone was still singing!!)   After all that, we all went downstairs to watch Shallow Hal. I ended up sitting beside Nick, and was so extremely comfortable. We were kinda snuggling together and watching the movie, but  whatever :). I think everyone who was there now has some sort of idea planted in their head, but...hey, you never know. It was a lot of fun. After the movie was done, we took a whole bunch of pictures with Steve's camera, and made a few videos with it too. It was soo funny. Around midnight, I called my dad and he picked me up, where I promptly fell asleep.  So obviously, Laura, and Kim, and Steve, and Karissa and Nana, and Nick and Sean and Matt are the best friends ever, and I love them forever for this :) :)

      Hello Tamberliney!!!  I'm so hyper right now, it's not even funny. This is a special bloggerz for yooooooooooooou!  CUC stands for Canadian Unitarian Council....Each year they have an AGM, Annual General Meeting somewhere in Canada. And there's a huge youth program that is a a part of it, called CanUUdle (which is the BEST!), which means spooning in Britian :D  I have to go run around screaming now, I haven't been this happy in like...months. Seriously :) Not to this degree :D  *runs around dancing, singing, screaming*

      Screaming!  Registration form for CUC was added online today, biiig deal. Already printed it out and filled it out minus emergency info. I'll have it sent off by Friday no doubts, just as soon as I hear confirmation that the $100 I have for being staff can go for my registration. SCREAM! And Mike was all wrong, he said we were saying at Delta, and we're staying at the Church...I'm so execellent, so excited, I wish it was May, like, RIGHT NOW! :)  As well, Laura did some dirty work for me, and I wanna know how it turned out. I think. Maybe not. We'll see. I'll prolly burst :)

      yum!  Saw Return of the King last night with Steve, Misha, Nick, Laura, Kim, Sean and Alistair...Haven't had that much fun in a while. Totally bawled my eyes out during it, Nick let me lean aganist him, and then we were sorta cuddling over an armrest (I hate movie theaters for that) and he let me cry on his shoulder. It was soaking wet when the movie was over. So Nick's awesome.  Fun night.

      I think I love him.  Laura tells us, "You guys can go outside, I don't care. I just don't want to watch it. It's gross."  He walks out the door, and goes down the stairs to the deck below.  I look at Laura, and wait a few moments, then follow. I open the door, and follow his path down the stairs, and see him standing near the wall.  I walk to him closer, and he wraps me in his arms, and kisses me. I kiss him back, shuddering because it is cold outside. He pulls me closer. My arm is around his back, the other pressed against his chest. His arms are on the small of my back, one creeps around and slowly is tracing the outline of my jeans, the other, pulling me closer to him with each kiss.  The hand finds the edge of my shirt, and travels up my back, sending tremors through my body as the cold air hits the exposed air, and at the feel of his touch. We kiss more, as time flies by around us.  We pull away, and I run inside. He sits beside me on the couch, and puts his arm around me, pulling me closer to him. He whisperes things in my ear, kissing my neck, cheek, earlobe. We all talk and laugh, and he sneaks in a kiss or there, here and then, carefully placed.  I couldn't imagine myself with him before, and now that we're together, I can't imagine how I got a long without him. And where this sweet side of him has been hiding.   I love you.

      Evidently, I've become too graphic in my blogs. Sucks to you all, it's my blog, I can describe whatever I want.  But, unfortunatly, I feel that too many people are reading this, and it's starting to get really weird when random people talk to me about my blog, people I had no idea exist. Or my worst enimies. Or people I rant about on here. Or my current boyfriend or crush, because that's awkward when they read bad stuff. Or awesome when they read good stuff. So I'm blogging elsewhere. Want the link? It's easy to find. Remember, clicking on that link requires you to keep your mouth zippo'ed shut.   Love you. I'll see you in 46 days, San and Erin....*screams*

      Oh boy. Was so bored yesterday, arranged my travel plans and costs to a tee. Incredibly wicked. Of course now, Mom's trying to fuck it up and make me go straight to Edmonton with near-complete strangers....by myself. uhhh..NO. Just because she doesn't want me missing "a week" of school. And really, its just two. Cause I'll be going at least most of the 19, and they'll force me to go on the 25, just cause I came home in the afternoon the day before >  In addition to my arranging of travel, I saved all my blogs on hard copy, on my computer. Took a good couple of hours, still need to complete Jan 2004-now. But whatever.  I have tonsilitis again. Huzzah. But my meds are working deliciously. I love it. I went to Nick's thursday night, and spent pretty much the rest of the day with him. We danced :P And watched some movies, and of course, made out. It was gorgy :). Friday went to the doc's and got diagnosed. (Dr du Toit's such an awesome guy :) ). Then did all this boring junk on the comp. Then went to Steve's for his party. Kim, Jeena, Misha, Tom, Nick, Matt, Nana, Lauren, Stevey, and I were all there. It was an awesome blast, except for when everyone bought food to eat, and I couldn't eat anything cause of my throat. And when Nick and Ben ran off to go smoke, even though Nick said he wouldnt..>  Babysat Ayla all today, was feeling reaaaaally crummy and gross in the morning, until about lunch time. Made myself something SO delicious...Ichiban noodles, chicken flavored, and I added some dill and chicken lunch meat.. OMG it was so good, and I felt sooo much better after eating it too. We painted shelves, mine was really pretty, and Nick called so we talked to him for a bit :) Lots of fun. Ayla also now has his phone number, and I'm fearing the worst. Got lots of money though, now I want to go to Walmart and get that pair of pants and maybe that shirt I was oogling...need...new...things...  Alright, I'm out now. Didn't sleep very well last night and had to get up early...And I've got to get up and trudge to youth tomorw morning as well. I'm going in my jammies tho. Chat with y'all later.

So I'm back. and now I get to figure out how to transfer all my posts from my xanga to here. Can't wait. :)   Plus my Xanga was accidently and mysteriously printed off, and Mom read it, soo....I need to find a place to blog now.   Nevermind, I figured out a way to post them. So pretty! Too bad it wasn't in like, the actaully days that it was posted in. Oh well.

      Tuesday, April 20, 2004   I never remembered it feeling like this before.  Maybe cause it's been so long since I've actaully felt this way about someone before. Maybe its beacuse I've done it all, and its all a repeating episode for me.  Or maybe its because he's so different from the rest.  Laura has this thing where she refuses to go out with her friends. I said you her, Posh! No fun in that. But I would agree with her. The amount of friends I lost by getting more invovled with them is phenominal. But I just don't see that happening here.  **************************  Laura is bugging me again. She said she didn't want us kissing and junk around her, so we went the cubby beside the bench. You can't see anyone in the cubby unless you lean around and look in. So Nick pulled me in there after school, and Laura clung onto me and yelled out, "No, don't leave me!!" I'm so confused about her.  ****************************  Adam is getting on my nerves too. I told him we had to chill off, give it time. My polite way of saying "Fuck off." And he did stay distant. For about 3 days. Now he wants me to go to his house and model my new bathing suit in front of him in his hot tub. I kept telling him, now, I don't want to, and yet he still emails me asking what time I'll be over. I don't want to be mean, but how else is he going to get the picture? He's trying to make me show him my new suit, when I barely feel comfortable wearing it yet (I literally feel topless wearing it. It's frightening.) It's not good. I don't want to be mean, but if that's the only way...  Oh, if only I wasn't so pigheaded and listened to Ash all those days and months ago. Sure, I had reasons for getting mad at Ash, he was getting way too weird, but he was right about me and Adam. I was too blinded by my infactuation, and thinking I was in love with him to see....  *************************  But other than that, life is beautiful. I cannot honestly wait for the weekend, it's going to be great. I can tell already.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Sunday, April 18, 2004   How do you know he's a good kisser?  1. He knows what to do. He knows when the opportune time is to kiss you, and it isn't awkward, it's...yeah. 2. His hands just don't sit there, they know where to go. They travel up and down your back, or cup your face. 3. He uses variety in his kisses...sometimes forceful and hungrily, so you can taste his fiery passion, sometimes sweet and gentle so you can feel his love and savour the moment. 4. When he kisses you, you can feel his emotion, and even his want for you flow through into you, and gives you life.  5. Doesn't slobber all over your mouth so that when you're done, you don't need a towel to wipe all the dripping gross slobber off your face.  6. He makes you feel good, improves your mood so that you are smiling no matter what you felt before.     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------   Well. It's been a while.  Last weekend was busy. We all went camping in Laura's backyard fri-sat (Matt, Stevey, Sean, Nicky, Laura, me, and Nana). We all stayed up late and talked, and played cards. It was a lot of fun. We watched matchstick men, threw candy at Maquested, and went to our seperate tents around 2...I couldn't sleep, and the guys were still talking, so I went with the intent to go talk with them, but ended up talking an hour long walk up and down Blackthorn with Nicky..(it's not even a very long road :P) We watched the moon rise, and gazed at the stars, and kissed...of course. He's so dreamy sometimes.   Everyone piled into the guys tent in the morning, as sleepy as we all were..watched the guys do guy things, and listened to what they did after us girls left. Then everyone began to pewter out, and leave...Nicky left for his drum thingy, but then came back. We went for a walk around and through Centenial, sat and..talked a little there. Ran into Adam (:S), Lannie, and my parents..quite exciting. Sunday, Laura, Kim, Stevey, Alistair and Nicky and I all were at Stevey's to do our english project. Steve's parents gave us all an easter egg hunt too. It was fun. Good solid waste of a day.  The week was filled with going to every single one of my classes, no matter how boring. Quite proud of myself. Tuesday night was parent night at youth, was fairly fun, I guess. Babysat Ayla Thursday and Friday. Didn't go home until late. T'was fun.   Saturday I got to sleep in (sorta). Went to Gramma's to mow lawn in the afternoon, then got a pair of new shoes..Saw a bathing suit at Walmart I am now coveting, and wanting. Then went to Nick's house for dinner and movie and junk. Was very very very very very very fun. Very.  I rang the bell, and he opened the door, he looked soo handsome and tasty, wearing a white shirt with a blue one on top. Very sexy. Smelt gorgeous, and looked it. I played with Mr Boots, and Nick's music and Mr Crowley as Nick made dinner. Fettecini alfredo. Very very delicious, some of the best I've had in a while. Watched/listened to a bit of the hockey game, then watched/listened to Signs. Good movie, very jumpy...Scared me a couple of times. We cuddled lost, and then watched/listened to the rest of the hockey game...boy was that intense. Good day.  Today so far, I've done jack all, barely managing to pull my ass out of bed and plunk it in front of the computer. the most movement I did was to find some stupid bread for my breakfast. That was too much effort. Now I'm in the process of convincing parents that they wanna go to Walmart. So far...I don't think it's working.  Till next time, Bat-folks...and always remember, Nick is your god :)    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Sunday, April 11, 2004   the emotional tormant, oh the pain take me away from this everlasting strain; i see clouds in your eyes, its all i can see; your pain bearing down hurts me, i can't move around; change my gaze, change the locks, where are you  i'm thirsting for your touch; the house bears its silence upon me, i stir; it is so still in here, i cannot bear to make a sound; beg the telephone to ring, hear you voice on the other side; fear is injected to me and i scream; i can't be here, i can't sit here, i refuse to let you do this to me; torment, pain, seaking savior, survival of the fittest; when were you watching me, i cannot remember; i awoke to your eyes piercing my soul, searching for a lie; i have no strength to bear this truth for you; outside i was safe, everything surrounded me no sounds to be near; sun beating down, relax it's all right. topless tanning, lying on the rug, blood pooling around me; i'm tired of all the games and the lies and the deciet. hurt me now, love me then; i wanted you the most in this game of pain and lies and you said you wanted me back; you ran away, forever and away, and laughed as i collapsed; heavy breathing, hours of thinking, oceans of tears; you changed everything about me; the way i talked, acted, sung, heard, and looked, you changed the depth in my eyes; you can see the holes you poked in my skin; the knife bears down upon my skin and a faint red line appears; time goes by and so does life, the blood dripping off my arm in babbling brooks, streams, rapid rivers. i gasp, you are shocked, and animals die around me; i hurt for you there is no where to run; im trapped in this game and i want to escape you hold my heart and the key, toying around with what you must; i loved you forever, but now its time to go.  time to fly time to die time to lie. i love another now he brings smiles to my face; flowers words of kindness, bandaids.  he has no idea how used i am, how broken, how battered my body is; and when he touches me there, it sends ripples of lust throuout my body; i eat at him hungreily, longing for a longer hour to be there, pain across my body in bites; he left me there to bleed;  i am but a simple carcass.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Friday, April 09, 2004   I woke up this morning around ten, warm and happy, and smiling. I can't remember the last time I woke up smiling, and I wasn't having a dream, so it was cool. My cat jumped on my face, and she was happy, because she can now sit in the window and soak up the sun. My mom had made me toast on her way out to go shopping, so I didn't have to make breakfast. (I was looking forward to the pancakes Greg was gonna make me, but whatcha gonna do.) I ate my breakfast then went out to sit on the sidewalk and talk to my mom while she hung out the laundry. It was sooooo warm and delicious out there, a perfect way to wake up. She went back inside, and I stayed out for another half hour, soaking up the warmth, and hoping for an early tan.   It was while sitting outside on the sidewalk, listening to all the millions of loud, chirping (and annoying) birds, that I realized something. When Iw as growing up, we didn't have a lot of money around, cause it was only Dad working. Mom didn't work so she could look after us and the property, because when I was growing up, there was a LOT more to do than there is now. So we didn't have a lot of money to go out on family excursions, or to buy me something new everytime I wanted it. And I realized why. Growing up, my momw wasn't just buying food for me, my brother, my dad, and herself. She was also buying food for 3 cats (or more, I think we fed a few of the wild ones.), 2 dogs, a handful of chickens, bunny rabbits, rats and mice (but that's just because they built up an resistance to rat poison.), and millions and millions of birds. We fed everything that came upon our property, whether we owned it or not. We fed the sheep, and cows, and pigs that came to live in the field beside us. We fed the wild bunnies, and the bunnies that were dropped off. We fed the neighboorhood cats and dogs, including our 3 cats. We had gazillions of wild birds, swallows, sparows, blackbirds, finchs, chicadees, even a freaking pheasent at one point! And until this point, I had not realized how kinda lucky I was to live in such an animal paradise..and even though I want to move, and live closer to my friends and everything else, how could I possibly leave this place of paradise?

      Wednesday, April 07, 2004   Oh, and by the way, Nick doesn't seem to think he's a good kisser.  That's a lie. Hugely.   I think the only other people who were better, out of all the guys I've even just made out with, were maybe Will and Kelty. So that's pretty good.  Yeah, Nick? You're an amazing kisser. :p Don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise. I love it.     ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Tuesday, April 06, 2004   Wow.  I realized how incredibly mushy this blog has gotten, because it is my hidden blog. Ooooh boy :).   Anyways. Yesterday was pretty crappy. I found out that Nick had actaully gone and read my blog, not that I cared, but he found out some stuff that I wasn't gonig to tell him for a whiiiiile..so..oops. He was teasing me about it, and was all silent and junk later...Kinda worried that I had fucked it all up like I usually do. I was so upset. When you like, or even love someone that much, to lose it all...Not fun.  Then I ruined my fave pair of jeans, a butterfly clip, and twisted my ankle. Blarch. Steve sent me an email though that boosted my mood..I was going into dark places.  Today was pretty shitty too. We did a practice test in Math, and I got so confused and messed up...I'm not really looking forward to the test. Earth Science was just plain boring, Steve got sooo amd at me in English, then decided I didn't need the hug he promised me, (which I did.) and gave me the coldest look I've ever seen. I skipped block 4 with Nick. I thought that would be terribly awkward, but it realy wasn't. We talked, and laughed, and kissed a bit...then he was teasing me over the whole "I love you!" thing. Then he told me he loved me. And that I was like, the most beautiful girl...A bunch of sweet stuff. It was touching. :) It completely made my day.  Then I came back after school, and Laura hid a beaaautiful collage in my locker she had made me :) It had pictures of me and her and some other stuff on it. It was pretty. It was a good day.   :)   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Sunday, April 04, 2004   Oh yeah, Calvyn asked out Kim on Friday. Only for a day, to stop me from telling them they should go out. And they kissed goodbye. Cuuuuuutest thing I've ever seen, unless I had a mirror to see me and Nick kiss :P I hope they go out for longer tho.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Should start going to class.  I'm failing Multimedia, done nothing about that. In fact, went to about 3 classes before started skipping again. Missed 3 math classes of a 4 day week. Missed 1 english class. Missed 2 Multimedia. It's not my fault the sun started shining. It got warm too, around the 20's each day. Gorgeous. I wore a skirt, without pants or anything else, for the first time in about 2 years. To school too, which was amazing.  Block four on Friday was amazing too. Skipped with Kim, Calvyn, and Nicky, went and sat out on the hill. im and Calvyn did math, they looked so cute together, I kept bugging them about it. Nick and me cuddled, and kissed, the first time in several days. I loved it. He said I was beautiful, and put flowers in my hair, to make me even prettier. Twas fun. Went to First aid, that was alright. Went to youth, got sick mid way. It was fun playing football in a skirt and flipflops tho. Can't wait to do that again.   Next weekend is easter weekend, and I beleive everyone is gonan go camp out in Laura's backyard, which will be exciting. Saturday also marks a very important date in which I believe not being around Laura and everyone is important. It's my one month anniversary celebration on the 10th, so yay us :). Beeming with pride.  In addition, I found out that I was tragically the only person gonig to Canuudle this year from Victoria. Even though this deeply saddens me, it means I get more money from the youth fund, like at least $100. I'm gonna try and hit Mike up for more, like somewhere around $200. That would help hugely. I get to go to Calgary too, and see San and Erin and everyone else there and drive up with them, so I'm extremely excited and happy about that. The band trip is coming up, taking away Nicky, Matt, Steve, Sean, Laura and Misha, and then Laura's going to Edmonton the next weekend. Tragic.   Other than that I got a paint set in my kinder egg. Pretty freaking awesome. And I'm going hot tubbing tomorw.     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Friday, March 26, 2004   Today sucked.  Skipped block one, totally forgot I had to hand in something for math. Went to a performance instead with Laura and Kim, and although it was fun, I would have rather have been hanging out with my boyfriend, and Tom..Cause I never get to hang out with Tom.   Earth Science was alright. As was Lunch. English wasn't that bad either.  Went to Multimedia, late. Mr Ollis yelled at me for skipping yesterday. Started working on my english, and he told me that right now, I was gonig to fail, because I have only handed in a small five mark project, and my work ethic sucks. So now i'm working frantically to hand in my website project, and maaaybe my digital photography unit (if Nick helps me). End of term 3 is in like, two weeks, so I need to work HARD.   Plus, if Mom sees the amount of absences on my report card...things will fly.  After school, I missed my bus, so I went to Laura's after school, cause Nick had to work.  Then Steve got mad at me for telling him not to say the word "gay" as stupid. And my mom has been yelling and snapping at me for anything the past few days.  Life really blows today. I hope it gets better soon.  I want to be alone with Nick.

      Wednesday, March 24, 2004   You are so beautiful to me You are so beautiful to me Can't you see?  You're everything I hoped for You're everything I need  You are so beautiful to me  You are so beautiful to me You are so beautiful to me Can't you see?  You're everything I hoped for You're everything I need  You are so beautiful  To me.      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Saturday, March 20, 2004   I think I love him.  Laura tells us, "You guys can go outside, I don't care. I just don't want to watch it. It's gross."  He walks out the door, and goes down the stairs to the deck below.  I look at Laura, and wait a few moments, then follow. I open the door, and follow his path down the stairs, and see him standing near the wall.  I walk to him closer, and he wraps me in his arms, and kisses me. I kiss him back, shuddering because it is cold outside. He pulls me closer. My arm is around his back, the other pressed against his chest. His arms are on the small of my back, one creeps around and slowly is tracing the outline of my jeans, the other, pulling me closer to him with each kiss.  The hand finds the edge of my shirt, and travels up my back, sending tremors through my body as the cold air hits the exposed air, and at the feel of his touch. We kiss more, as time flies by around us.  We pull away, and I run inside. He sits beside me on the couch, and puts his arm around me, pulling me closer to him. He whisperes things in my ear, kissing my neck, cheek, earlobe. We all talk and laugh, and he sneaks in a kiss or there, here and then, carefully placed.  I couldn't imagine myself with him before, and now that we're together, I can't imagine how I got a long without him. And where this sweet side of him has been hiding.   I love you.     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Wednesday, March 17, 2004   I think I love him.  He's dreamy when we make out. He touches me, and he's always pulling me close. I feel so fragile around him, that he will make sure no evil will harm me. He'll protect me from all of the monsters in the dark, will always be there.  I never want to leave him. Ever. I love just hanging out with him, even if Laura doesn't let us make out in front of her. Life is perfect.   And then I found out that Mike is trying to ruin CanUUdle...  But then I think of Nick, and us together, and I know, somewhere in my heart, that my love for him is growing.   I love you.   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Wednesday, March 10, 2004   Even better than Nick kissing me?   Me going out with him of course.  It was a long embarrassing block two today, I must admit, but it was definatly worth it in the end. Because now we're going out, I have a boyfriend, he's awesome, and I'm completely awestruck. Purely amazing.  Skipped both block two and block four today, neither teachers noticed, nor cared when they caught me later. Pure genius.   Today has been a day out of a picture book, an amazing adventure has begun.   And when Spring Break begins, all hell breaks loose.  Party on, my friends. Party hard. We've earned it.  *rocks out!*     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Sunday, March 07, 2004   Nick kissed me last night.   We had sat through the movie cuddling (as well as you can in a movie theater), and holding hands...I cried on his shoulder, and he held me tight. On the way home, he put on Kim's lip gloss, and was being really goofy...resting his head on my shoulder...then he looked up and kissed me, just beside my lips...we held hands most of the way home. Going up Stelly's hill, he grabbed my face, and kissed me again on the cheek..:D  I'm falling in love..and I love it.

      Saturday, March 06, 2004  I got staff at CUC this year. That's pretty darn awesome, thank you very much. I'm very excited.  The only thing is, the one person in the enitre world who might care is in Argentina and pretty much unreachable  So I'm pretty down right now, cause there is no one else to scream and jump up and down with me, no one who truelly understands.  I tried telling Tom tonight, and he was just like.. "I don't see the big deal...?" It just made me wanna cry. Hugely. Big wet tears.  Where are you Fiona?! I miss you so much now, you really are and will always be the glue holding me to youth group...I don't wanna go if you aren't there to help defend the CUC to our very American group..:(     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Thursday, March 04, 2004   Is it wrong to like someone you consider to be your best friend?  Is it wrong to have those urges, and those feelings?  We've been getting pretty close lately, and it's been awesome. We're both completey dependant on each other when it comes to the opposite sex, always talking about who we like, and how to rope them into our reaches.   And now I think he's accidentally roped in myself.  Oh heart, why do you play with me so?      Wednesday, March 03, 2004   I miss him.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Tuesday, March 02, 2004   I feel so obselete sometimes.. That my creativity is sometimes wasted.  I pride my beauty. I work hard to look the way I am, and to act the way I do. I strive to be unique, and to differ from others as much as I can - to stand out, and attract people and attention. If I can stay in their mind for five minutes, or even more, that's all I need.  Today we filmed part of our movie, where I am the hooker...When it was time for me to be filmed, Nick was laughing, as was everyone else...jokes were cracked, but there was lizards in the ditch below to enteratin and distract me. Afterwards, while capturing the movie, Nick shuddered and wished aloud to be able to just turn off the monitor and not watch that part. Ouch.  First, it was HIS idea for me to be the hooker. We could have gotten someone else, but it had to be me. Fuck.   Abstract thoughts. Love and Lust.  Nick, regardless of his faults, is beginning to look rather tempting to me....I want to be able to feel the texture of his mouth, his tender lips...I mean. He's extremely intriguing, with his groping, feeling hands, and looks..The way he acts is entertaining, but yet very observable. You could watch him all day and be plagued with wonderings of why he does what he does, and what he is thinking. He is inpenitraitable. I can't conjure up a way to figure out more about him, his thoughts, and moods. Likes and dislikes. But I am resourceful. I can find a way to hear his thoughts, and one day, I shall.  More lust. Is it wrong to lust or long after a person who is pratically my best friend? I tell him everything, he is what Liam was to me all those precious years ago. (That statement makes me feel so old!) I laugh with him, cry with him, comfort him, and be comforted by him. We're always talking to each, laughing. Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to lean over and just..kiss him...be caught with his surprise, and be pleased as the moment intensifys...pardon me, I believe I'm thinking of Tom when I say that...  I'm just a messed up puddle of emotions.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  New blog. I'm not used to change like this. I'm not even sure I'll use it that much. But no one knows about this, my secret fortress of solitude. I can truelly hide my thoughts and feelings in here, without worrying what people are reading...  Listening to: Lord of the Rings: Return of the King (The steward of gondor)  Mood: Sunny

So I'm back. and now I get to figure out how to transfer all my posts from my xanga to here. Can't wait. :)  Plus my Xanga was accidently and mysteriously printed off, and Mom read it, soo....I need to find a place to blog now.  Nevermind, I figured out a way to post them. So pretty! Too bad it wasn't in like, the actaully days that it was posted in. Oh well.

      Mmmm....Yesterday was fun..mostly.  Went shopping, got more of Laura's birthday present. Totally stumped on both when and what to get the rest of it. Or I could just give her what I got her, its more than enough...but..just not for me. Also bought some new pants and junk, they are all too small, so now I have to go BACk to Walmart and return then. Hurray..*rolls eyes* But I also got some yummy new hand cream  I was supposed to go to Laura's at 12 yesterday so I could wake her up and we could call and remind everyone about going to the park. My dad had to picket at 1, so I asked if I could be dropped off after they finished shopping. They all agreed, so I woke up at 9 with them and wennnt shopping and made sure we got out of each store quickly, and we finished at 11.30, more than enough time for me to be dropped off and Dad to eat lunch before he had to go. Well, they then decided there wasn't going to be enough time, blah blah, and Dad would drop me off on his way to picket. I was pissed cause they ruined all my plans, so I walked to Laura's, and Dad then decided he was never going to drive me anywhere again. Whatever.  Went to the park, had a righteous water fight. Soaked Misha, Kim, Laura, Steve and Karissa. Sean, Nana and Tom were too chicken to get wet :P I didn't dry out until like, 6 though. Laura Kim and Steve left at about 3.30, and then Karissa and Misha left around 4.30, and Tom, Sean and Nana left about 5 ish. I dropped off Laura's container, and went over to Nick's place, and waited for him to come home from work. A pleasent surprise. We made out for a while and said hi to his sister and brother in law, and then made out more, and then I went home cause I was feeling sick :( Stupid heatstroke. Totally made my mom freak out though, cause I didn't call her until like, 8.30 :)   I'm going shopping today, I think. Find some more stuff for Laura. Return the damn pants. Better get running on that. Have a great day, y'all.

      Seriously, you think it can't happen. But it can.  I got food poisoning from chips. Potato chips. Well, tortilla chips, but still. It was gross.  Went to a presentation done by the Bahai school. They are so great. It was the same one we saw in grade 8 adn junk, with the pot and junk on the shirts..so great :) I hearted it. And Nick went too, and we sat next to each other and were able to kinda cuddle the whole time. I liked that :)   Rawr! Went to Nick's place again today, had..a lot of fun :P Man, it was fun. Holy crap. :P I can't describe it. I think I....worried, surprised? Nick :P We played a fun game.....the chain game...and...that's fun..but I don't think its a game you play all the time..you only play it..when...someone's been baaad...to keepthe heat and the game more...spicy...RAWR. Anyways.  And its that time of the month, and I've already freaked out and burst into tears twice. In one hour. Here's to hoping it ends SOON. Like, tomorw.  Anyways, I'm hurting again, so I will chat with you all later. G'night.

      Wow..  Been a while. I've been so freaking busy though. Went shopping on Saturday, hung out at Ayla's for a bit, then I can't remember what I did. Prolly just chill out.   Sunday I went to church, did some childcare, watched the Neverending Story. It's been so long since I last watched it, I couldn't actaully remember what happens after Atreyu reaches the Southern Oracle..but now I do. Wasn't a suitable movie for poor Maria though. Then I went to Steve's to drop off a book, killed some tent caterpillers. Maaaaaaan that was wicked :P Then I went to Spelts, picked up a phone card (reminder for self, I need a new one before this one expires May 17) then went to Laura's. She knocked down a walll :O Then I went over to Nick's for a bit, then back to Laura's, then to Kim's, watched some TV there, and then Laura, Kimmy, Mandy and I all hoofed it down to Silver City to watch Mean Girls. Kim had NO money in her bank account however (she somehow transfered it all) so we almost didn't get to see the movie until Laura gave the twins movie money. Then we went to buy tickets, and discovered the movie didn't actaully start at 7.45 like Kim thought, but at 7.15!! So we missed 15 minutes of movie and credits, and had to sit at the front, off to the side. But whatever :) It was a good movie.   Watched Ayla and went shopping on Monday, and watched her again on Tuesday. Got a ride home from Nick's dad on Tuesday, which was sweet-o. Wednesday was the one day I went straight home, doing prolly nothing. Waited for a stupid update to download and install, pretty much it. Thursday was Laura's birthday, I baked cupcakes for her. Went over to Nick's after school so we could watch the last Friends together. We....had fun until then though. Holy crap, yes. Watched the finale, I cried like a baby. I looked up, and someone else was too. Honestly, cutest thing ever. Golly, do I love Nick :).  Friday was yesterday, went to a self-defence thingy after school, kinda wish I had taken it at school now. Walked home with Nick, got really wet. Had more fun at his house. Rwawr........Then went over to Laura's, braided her hair, and we went off to youth group. (We were so late :P) It was Chinese food night, so we loaded up plates of that. Boooooy that was some goood chinese food. Then we all dispersed outside and such, out in the rain on the lookout. Then we all came together inside to start a game of Sardines, which we never played. Instead we played a ROCKIN' 2-3 hour long game of Silent Foooooot ball...so fun. It's just so much fun when Tom is the dictator, randomly giving out points, punishing people, crap, that's funny. It was better when he handed out the power to Kathrine, and she wouldn't listen to anything he said, and totally freaked. :D Fun!   Today's plans are going shopping with Laura...getting her something else for her birthday, and some stuff for my trip (which is in 13 THIRTEEN days!!!!) and some presents for all the May Birthdays and anniversaries :P yay! There's something else going down, but I can't blog about it now..:D SO EXCITED!  Anyways, I'm out. I'm going to be SO busy until everyone starts leaving.....and I leave..and come back :P

      Mmmmmmm......  Ride the stallion all the way home, what a wild hour and some has gone by so quickly. Broken in jeans, worn through shoes....  I have to work at Gramma's and Ayla's tomorow. Consilation, I get to go shopping in-between for my Care Bear shirt.   Nicky, Matt, Sean, Steve and Misha leave tomorw for Calgary. Jeena leaves Sunday for Albert Edward. They are all instructed to bring me back something furry from the Calgary Zoo, save Jeena. She gets to bring me back a leaf, or some snow or something. Hurray.  I'll remember Nick for the five days he's gone though...ooooh boy.........love you baby, hope you still remember me..

      Mmmm....  Yesterday was a marker, two months with Nick. That was fun :) We .....hung out...downstairs for a bit, then went out for dinner..The Hurricane Grill was closed though, so we went and got a pizza, ate it in Centennial. Went to "our spot" in the woods there, and talked for a bit.. I love him so much, he's just so....perfect. It's so amazing. I love being with him..I wish I lived closer, like walking distance from everyone (and appropriate, like, 5 minute walking distance, none of this 60 minute junk) and then I could see everyone..:( Man, I miss him.   Watched Ayla today, got her to eat a salad. Very very major moment here, because I didn't have to choke it down her throat!! She ate it voluntarily! Yaaaaay!!! And tomorw night I get to make chicken fingers and....SALAD!!! Hopefully she'll eat that too, and so hungrily like she did today :)  Other than that, not much new...Nick was wearing a necklace thingy today.......crap he looked so hot, I can't get over it :P And Tom expressed how much he wanted to go to Edmonton and CUC now, and I said he still could...people ARE still sending in their registrations, its just that his airfare would be killer....MAN I hope Mike says he can go!!!!! *crosses fingers* That would be so radical, ooh man... Anyways....till another, friends.

      Wow.  Well.  After trying to find a site to host my picture, and failing misrably, I gave up. I'll talk to Ed about hosting and sites to host stuff on.   Yesterday went shopping with Laura. Twas fun. Got a new shirt at Maraposa, it's white, so I'm thrilled. Got some rainbow shoelaces at Bluenotes, and oogled a Care Bear shirt that I want so bad...it's pink and has Tenderheart on it like my last one did...So when I get enough cash I'll go get it. Hopefully before I go to Edmonton, cause that would really be righteous to have a new Care Bear con shirt. Got two new bras at La Senza, so that was pleasing. Went to A&B sound, drained my bank account (nearly) for a present for Laura (Treasure Planet). After that, it was almost 4, and I had to keep her out for at least another hour so we went down to Beacon Hill Park. Bunch of people called me on my cell too, but Laura kept thinking it was Nick, so I didnt say anything to convince her otherwise :P We walked around the park, talked to ducks and stuff, then went to the petting zoo, which was sooo much fun. There were peacocks with their butt feathers extended, and pigs, and peacocks, and ducks, and peacocks, and sheep and cows and rabbits, and peacocks, and baby emus, and baby guinea pigs, and goats, and peacocks....sooo much fun. :) Then we sat in a tree and talked for a bit and watched people play golf while we waited till it was time to go. Saw a black squirell when we were coming back. Very exciting. Laura's mom picked us up and drove us to her house....  Then it got exciting, because of course there was the surprise party. I didn't know how to get into the house, the front door is hard to open and makes a lot of noise, I saw people downstairs, so I wasn't sure if I could go in through there, and then I remember the deck, so I go up there. Matt and Tom were hiding there, so I ran up to hide with them. Laura saw me outside, and the decorations in the living room, and went out to the deck to see why I was there, and Matt and Tom jumped up yelling surprise, and then everyone else came out of the bathroom and scared her good :P It was tres awesome. We opened presents and talked and laughed and stuff. Laura got a lot of candy. We went outside to eat and we started to play silent football, then moved to the front yard cause we got so noisey. Oooooh boy was that sooo much fun. :P Tom kept speaking out of turn cause he wasn't used to not being the dictator, Nick kept doing the nmore HILARIOUS things, as well as Matt, it was hard NOT to keep from laughing...Eventually a headache took over and I was feeling gross :( So I tried to take a nap outside, and later inside when everyone came back. Finally I crashed on Laura's INCREDIBLY COMFORTABLE bed, and Nick came and sat with me to make sure I was ok..he sat there the whole time I was sleeping there, which was really sweet. Then he went outside to play hide and go seek tag, and I woke up and joined them. I was really cold, so I had one like,4 or 5 coats and sweaters. I watched them play for a bit, then I joined in too. I was never caught :P So awesome. Then we went inside to watch Robin Hood Men in Tights..I read People instead and made out with Nick until I had to go. It was an ammmmmmazing day.   Plus Nick was wearing blue jeans, a blue over shirt (that I evetually stole and wore cause I was cold, looked kinda sexy on me :p) and a black t shirt..and looked SO HOT. RAWR. Hard to keep my hands off of him.   Today I went to church to sell the blessing beads Marya made for me to sell. I got to keep all the profits too... they all sold very quickly, and people just randomly donated money too :) Someone even bought a necklace for me which was soo  soo sweet. Mom made me donate all the money to the youth group though >  Tomorw marks two whole months with me and Nick, so eee!! I'm very excited. Then he's leaving for Calgary on the 15, and comes back on the 19...Mom leaves on the 19 for Edmonton and I'm supposed to go over to Nick's on the 20 to say my goodbyes and such..Then I leave on the 21, and come home late afternoon on the 24...Very excited..Much still to do, with watching Ayla, and buying cameras, and organizing touch groups and spirit committee and everythign else.....plus there's the PE trip on the 2....5? I think..so that means Laura, Matt and Dan are gone until the 29, I think. Or 30. Busy month!!!!! I'll post when I can, and especially cause I think I'm coming down with Mono...soo...Catch ya all on the flipside! Hope you all enjoy the new layout too, I'm still deciding about it.

      Pissed off..  Everyone came back today, I spent the morning wrapped in Nick's arms. Went to Math, saw a presentation. Pretty exciting. Didn't go to Earth Science because I had a test I didn't study for, and Nick didn't want to go. Unfortunatly, Nana came too, so it was sorta...no fun. Went to English, wrote a lame song for the entire class. Creatively skipped Multimedia, walked into the park with Nicky. We found a really private, gorgeous spot to sit by the river. Made out there for a bit, then walked back to the school.   Went to Laura's after school, called Dad, he freaked out because Ms STUPID HEAD Smirl called and tattled on me for skipping. Stupid broad. SO he came an picked me up, I spent my last few minutes with Nick, and left. I have never wanted him more than right then, I really wish I had never called home.   I'm all packed to go now, last minute changes, I'm bringing Easter Kitty (my present from nicky) and my cell phone with me, so I can still have a part of Nicky, and call anyone. If yas wanna chat with me while I'm away, try me at 885-8586. Leave a message if I've turned off the phone.   I miss Nick terribly, his touch, his voice, his kiss, everything...I miss the way he whispers something sweetly in my ear then licks it (even if it is annoying). I just plain ol' miss him, and wish I didn't have to leave him :( I really really hate Ms Smirl right now for ruining my day.   I love you ooglies, everyone, miss you bunch, and I'll see you all hopefully on Tuesday when I get back. Ciao.

      Blech...  Didn't have math this morning, went to Laura's sewing class and bugged her. Twas fun. Didn't go to Earth Science, skipped and went to Centenial with Laura and Dan...walked around all the trails, then walked along the river, and crossed over it, looking for an oxbow lake...Never found it. Discovered Karissa's car was picked up and moved, that was weird. Went to a one-man Lord of the Rings show, that was really, really amazing and funny, holy crap. That guy is gifted. Went to Multimedia, finished my DVD questions, and then started working on my home theater project. Started using Acid Pro for part of it. (Yay, I'm worknig with music again!) Went home, watched some tv, then started working on my lists for CUC....Organzing people into their touch groups and stuff. Will start making packing lists too, cause I'm going to need that.   Missed everyone who was gone terribly today, and it really was no fun in Multimedia without my "hubby" as Mr Ollis calls Nick.   There's this really funny picture in Mr Ollis's office with Nick in a wedding dress with Simon (edited photo, don't worry) and it says "To my darling, Nick." The scary thing is, is that we don't know whether it's refering to the Nick in the picture, or Mr Ollis....I saw that today in his office and we just cracked up.....it's terrible :)  Can't wait till everyone comes back, I want Thursday to last forever (or at least a long time), cause me and Nana really miss Nick and Sean, and the rest of us really miss them all....oh well..in time.  Love you all lotsly, me.

      Wahhh...  I miss Nick so much right now, after my conference call, I just broke down into tears and cried... I wish they called...cause even just to hear him in the background would be enough...Laura's sent me pics, and I've been looking through my pics of him......  I'm having a bubble bath later though. With candles. And enya music. And green tea and japanesse rice cracker thingies.  AND AHHH!!! Fiona just came online, she's home in Victoria, and is planning on going to Edmonton!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 SCREAMING!! This day went from really good to really bad to AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1*dances around*  I love you nicky poo.

      Pleh.  I'm at Nick's right now. He's being silly and practicing with his band, and left me all to my lonesome. So I pumped up Moby and started goofing off on the computer. Oh, there they go....They weren't playing, and I thought it was cause of me...but evidently not. Darn them! I was listening to Moby, and they started playing so hard (prolly Nick on the drums) that it caused my cd to skip,....grrr...now I'm listening to it on the computer. I relaly need to drown them out :)  I love you Nicky!! *looks innocent :P)  Got an extra project for Multimedia, so that's pretty sweet. It's filming and editing Misha's biology project...very exciting stuff. It's really easy too, which is surprising but awesome.  Still recovering from CanUUdle. I should find out when the newsletter deadline is so I can write up a thing for it. Can't wait til I get my pics back, and really can't wait til Laura comes home tomorw.   Well, my friend has been committed (literally) so I'm going to go deal with him...it's kinda..hard.. love you all (especially those not playing loud stuff to drown out my music right now).

      Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...  Went to Gyro Park today, and played at the beach. Actaully dived into the ocean, and promptly came running back out, screaming. Holy CRAP that water was cold. I stood in there for about 2 minutes before my feet went numb and I couldn't feel them anymore. Then me and Ayla ran out and into the nice, warm hottub....where I proceded to not move until about 6. Ayla brought me juice and pop and water and crackers and a popsicle (she was my cabana boy) and we just hung out..I was trying to tan..I think I only browned my face, if anything. Oh well. My bathing suit slowly changed from dark blue to purple to pinkish...The chlorine in the hottub I guess was slowly dying it..soo..oops. Guess I need a new bathing suit before I can go swimming in public pools again :P Sorry Laura.   Other than that, pretty dull day. KILLER cramps in block 2 and 3. It was gross. I feel really pretty right now, I'm just wearing jeans, a bra and a wifebeater...so simple :) Just renamed and organized most of my music too. The big test is coming up, listening to all my songs and deleting the ones I don't like, as well as converting all the .wma files to .mp3 so I can have the option to burn them onto an Mp3 cd....what a nerdish life I lead. I'm out.

      Uurrghh....  If what I have right now is perfect, and I couldn't be any happier, then why oh why do I wish I had something more? To go back in time and have that? I wish I could talk to someone who would understand....

      Life really really sucks.  Somehow, magically, I chipped my damn tooth yesterday. From walking from Laura's house to Nick's. Serious talent there kids. Right up there with bruising my goddamn ear.  Someone went through my bag in block one. Left the $200 discman. Left the $150 cell phone, and the $20-odd dollars of phone time on it. Took the goddamn wallet with $23.75, my care card, my bank card, my bus card, and my emergency phone list for Ayla, amongst other stuff. Whoever they were, stole Laura's lunch too. So we were both lunchless (I've taken to buying my lunch lately.), and me FREAKING walletless...not good. Broke down a few times today and yesterday. To make life better, it's that goddamn time of the month, so I feel absolutely gross inside, like there's a freaking WAR going on down there, gosh. The only good thing from that is that OBVIOUSLY I can't be like...pregnant, so yeehaww!!  I want my wallet back. I feel so naked without it. And if it wasn't for all my friends pulling for me, and helping me, I would be lost. Absolutely lost. Especially Laura and Nick.   And Steve, you're jsut a big plain, brown, stinky, crusty asshole. Seriously. And you don't deserve any f-ing kindness from me.

      So it's been a few....Oops :P  Got busy, what can I say? Last weekend was busy, went to Brentwood Days and got sick :P Damn migraines. Best part about that tho, was seeing Nick in a white shirt (drool) and taking several (actaull) naps with him later...Delicious.   Monday and Tuesday I watched Ayla..nothing huge...Wrote a test after school on Wednesday cause I accidently skipped that class (an actual accident too), got timetables on Wednesday too, biked to Saanichton, watched Ayla. Thursday was special day, biked over to Nick's after school, had..urhm..fun :) It was our three month anniversary thing then...pretty special. Friday, went to the park for a bit with everyone, and then went to Nick's....had more...urhm...fun :) and then went out to see Day After Tomorrow, but...we didnt get there in time. Stupid buses coming early. And we were too late to see Stepford Wives, so we saw Shrek 2....which was actaully very good. Best thing about that, was when we were coming home, we were charged the Adult Fare on the bus..:P Hehe!   Anyways, off to the park today. And to go see Harry Potter later with Laura. And to do Earth science work, cause Kaitlin wants that done by like....tomorrow..(crap..>

      bang bang, i'm dead....    --------->>  Finally, new picture up :) Huzzaray.  Been a bunch of busy, HOT few days....a beautiful heat wave rode in Tuesday, and has stuck around for a while...weatherpeople are saying that it's gonna be like this for a while, so huzzah! Been wearing skirts and finding other, nice, coool things to keep normal. Temperture wise, that is. Thursday and friday had a cross grade for English....Don't think I bombed it, but I know I could have done better on the short story paragraph...Poor time management, and easily distracted by the cool, refreshing looking sprinkler outside.. Thursday night, Tom drove me to Karissa's dance show at Spectrum...We met Matt, Dan, Nana, Sean and Nick there...watched Karissa dance. The theater kept getting hotter and more uncomfortable as the night wore on...but cute little girls dances, and they were really cute....:) Karissa was really good as well, the whole show was supremo..Tom nearly melted after watching Karissa dance to American Woman...as did every other guy there probably. Nick and Sean kept doing the funniest things too, so it was hard to be quiet and keep a straight face during it...It was awful :P And warm.  Friday, I had a practice math test, which showed I needed to study a bit more...alright, a lot more. Then I had a test in Earth Science, then my crossgrade. I burst out of my crossgrade exhausted and hot, and I just wanted to have a water fight, but then Nana and Sean invited Nick and me to the lake with them after school, so I ditched the water fight idea. That was fun. Durrance was crowded as hell, and it was hard to try and find a place to swim so we could be by ourselves, but we finally found a spot...It was nice, all the preppies float toys drifted over to us, and never came to claim them, so we floated around on those for a while, then just ditched them on shore, where they picked them up as they walked by (The only thing bad about our spot was that it was a quick, steep dropoff to the water below, and that we were RIGHT beside the path). Then me and Nana discovered the magic of using our boyfriends as floatation devices...Needless to say, I don't think I've ever had that much fun at a lake before...and...I really really wanna go night swimming now..Just..cause... I've never relaly wanted Nick more at that time :P Calvin swam over too, and he had to talk to Sean and Nana because me and Nick were..umm...swimming. Yes. Swimmmmmmmmming. Hee hee.. Unfortunatly, the wind picked up, and threw a few sharp bursts towards us, and then the sky clouded over with a big thunderhead, so we left. As we were getting changed and stuff, some guy walked by us on the path, and started commenting on my huge boobs, and what he'd like to do with them, etc. And then we were walking back to the car, Adam Steele whistled at me...:S Guess it comes with wearing a slightly revelaing bathing suit. Mom bought me a new one too, to replace my corderoy one, cause it isn't really for swimming. So that was sweet. And we ran into Kim and Karissa and the rest of Sandra's birthday party...that was cool.  We drove back home, and we noticed all these branches and leaves and pinecones and everything all over the roads..and then the lights were out at the interesction on Island View, and at my house..and at Nick's. It was very, very weird. Evidently the winds were very, very strong everywhere but where we were. Oh well. Hung out at Nick's until about 11ish. We had fun. :) As per usual.   Today, I woke up and did homework! And that's what I've done all day. I finished all my english homework, which is nice. Now I just have to do the thing on the planets, start that worksheet-y thing, and then study math. Hurray! I was outside today, trying to catch a tan at the hottest point of the day, but...it was hoooooot...:( So I went inside, where it's a tiny bit better. Mom *finally* bought a printer/copier/scanner dealie, so that means I can scan my pictures soon! I'm so excited, but we prolly won't set it up until tomorrow or Monday. Hopefully there'll be a water fight tomorrow too, I'm in the process of trying to set one up. It'll be hot enough for one, that's for sure.   Better get started on the rest of my homework, so I'll chat back :P Ciao for now, esteemed, bored readers.

      Pleh.  Park was fun, Karissa, Tom, Dan and me played two totally righteous games of Egyptian Rat Penis Fuck. Soooo awesome...I nearly overtook Karissa twice too, so that was cool. Stood around and played football with Jeena and Nana and everyone else, exchanged some gossip and then Nick showed up and Karissa and Nana left. And we slowly dispersed after that... Nick and I went off to his place to chill and keep dry. We chilled for a bit, then I called Laura to see what time she wanted to leave for the movie, and was informed that she had poorly planned her time, and needed to study instead. Hope she had a good nap....So I was pretty bummed and upset..cause I wanted to spend time with my best friend, and talk to her about pressing matters...But Nicky took pity on my tears and took me instead. He really is the sweetest, bestest guy ever. the movie was decent, I'm glad I saw it..they did a good job taking junk out of the book and representing it. But I noticed these as well..  -Firstly, I didn't think it was that sexual...but maybe that's just because I'm just so into sex myself. -Secondly, good relace on Dumbledore...he just looks thinner, and that's it..but what's with tying the beard? And Nevelle grew up so muuuch :P They all did.. -Thirdly, WOW, set sucks. They could not have changed it more. The Forbidden Forest was like a shot from Bambi, suddenly Hogwarts is by a river, two COMPLETELY different ones, too, and Hagrid's shack is now on a hill? When did Hogwarts get on a hill? -Forthly, what's with the kids no longer having to wear their full uniform he whole day, and into Hogsmeade? Did I miss something there?  Movie was still amazing though. And standing in the rain waiting to be picked up was fun too. :) Can't wait till some of those movies we saw in the ads come out...Princess Diarys 2 (damn you Kim), Cinderella Story (damnit Kim :P), Polar Express (which actaully looks really really good, it was one of my fave christmas books growing up...one of the traditions..) Yeah.  I've got so much homework to do now tho it's hardly funny. I have to write 6 poems, for a total of 8 (I'm going to use ones I've already written me thinks tho) and do a thing on "Solutions for Acid Rain" for Katie like NOW so she can put it on our poster...Graa...So that means I'm out, for now. Until next time..  Hey, anyone noticed that my blog is working again? The profile picture thingy is at the top where it's supposed to be..Hurray! :)

      I got a new toy today...  Alanna gave me one of her gerbils for freeeeeeeeeeeeeee and mom let me. And the cat's trying to eat it.  Her name is Leroy, and yes, it's a she. With a masculine name. She's ever so cute too, brown with black eyes. So adorable! She even has a wheel, that she spins in and junk. Very ultra cute.  And Nick gave me a nice present..a necklace of hickies...mom and dad stopping being impressed a while ago :p Although, the only one they noticed still, was the one on my boob...heh :P  Off to babysit the gerbil now....stupid cat still might wanna eat it after our talk. That's right. I have serious discussions with my cat. And what's crazier, most of the time she listens :P Night y'all.

      Bloggity blog blog blooog..  Right. So.  Went to Nick's on...Wednesday. Went to fireworks. Had fun. Made out lots. Went to town yeseterday with Nick and his friends. Walked around lots. Watched fireworks. Got kicked out of some pizza place. Saw Liam, Ian and Kat. I missed my husband. Got ignored by Steve, Kim, Laura, and Dan. Said hi to Misha, the other Misha, Kaya, Megan and Linnea. Twas fun. I love the fireworks..so romantic and sweet and junk..ahh..My boyfriend's perfect.  Tryed to address some thing with my friends, opened up a bombshell, now the group is even more divided than it was before...but whatever. I'm taking a break from it all. Refocusing energy into Nick (hehe) and youth activites. I'm better appriciated there than with my friends. They don't seem to see all the stuff I do. But whatever. I'm still planning on hanging out with the "couples" clique, just not with the group as a whole. Toooo much effort. But whatever.  I'm hungrey. Sidekicks take a while to make. Mom bought Greg a new computer, $1200 later..he has to pay her back at least $1000 though, so I'm not jealous. She's going to be on his tail for that money for some time, so :P Whatever.  As a side note to that, if it wasn't for Nick being there to talk to today, I dunno what would have happened. Nick, you are my superhero. I love you man.

      Weee!!!  So, report cards yesterday. Parents saw me hanging out with my friends and literally fought me for my report card. I yelled at them and junk, told them to f off..Nick told me later I should call and apologize..but I know my family. We don't apologize. It's just not in our nature. I was expresseing how I felt about them stealing my report card, and not being impressed with the 97 I miraculously got. So.  This morning Mom came to have a "talk" with me...I was prepared for something WAY worse, like something she had recently found out about me or something, but it turns out she was rewarding Greg for his report card, and for equality's sake, my 97, and all the other fantstic grades I get, she's also rewarding me..so..HAH! It's cause she listened to how upset I was..that I worked so hard for good grades, and they don't even acknowlegde it. So Mom felt bad and is now giving me about $80 to spend on anything I want..The amound varies though, it depends on how much the car costs to fix. But yeah. So. I'm making a shopping list. She orinigally wanted me to blow it at Future Shop, but I asked if it could be blown somewhere else, simply because then I could get things that I actually need..like..hair dye :P And more pratical things than like, movies and more technology. Although, I do need some cable thingys to hook up my discman to my stereo...  So :) That pleases me superbly. I'm still ticked that Gramma's pouring $200 to fix Greg's $300 bike, but whatever. Auntie Donna bought me clothes for my birthday, and baked him cookeis for his. So I guess the world balances out.  Nick got me sick though, so I fell kinda gross-like. Went swimming in the ocean yesterday with Matt, Nicky, Sean and Nana..Tom and Karissa were too cool :P And then Nicky made Karissa, me and Nana dinner (spaghetti) and then Sean took Nana, Nicky and me to Durrance for some niiiiight swimming. Twas sweet. It was a lot of fun too. Found another really good place to go swimming at Durrance...just that the rocks are kinda sharp. Oh well.   Anyways, I want a shower. Hopefully that'll make me feel better. And I'll go beat the cat. that always makes me feel better :P Stupid bed hog....

And it's that time of the month, so I feel icky, but nothing else is happening....HURRAY! Remember children, sex is BAD....oO  anyways, mom is looking at me. It's scaring me. Waaahhh...

      Oooh....Blogger changed the writing box-y thing...sweet-o. &nbsp; Been busy :P Meant to write in this a lot sooner, but didn't. Went to see the Terminal last week, as well as Spiderman 2. Both really good movies. Hung out with Nicky a bunch, tis fun. Took Ayla to sewing Tuesday and Thursday, made a bundle. Nicky came with us on Tuesday, met up with Annetta on Thursday. Bought an outfit for Nick's dad's birthday party. tres sexy. Bought a foot pump for my air matteress. Took that to the lake on thursday with Ayla. It still works, which is tres awesome. Went to the lake again yesterday, just floated around on my air matteress,...nothing better than that. Went to Karissa's house later that day. Played Tom at pool and actaully WON for once. But only cause he messed up. Dan showed up too.....had to fight urges of violence towards him. Nick and Nana were there too. We bought a triple chill cake and ate it..gave new meaning to PCP party :D It was a lot of fun. &nbsp; Nicky, Nana and Karissa went to youth last Friday. That was sweet. Hung out before that, got a boston cream pie (yum yum). Been trying to semi-organize the summer camp, and what the youth'll do there. It'll be rough....seeing as it's all me :P I've been trying hard to track down forms too for the damn thing...hopefully they'll show up soon.  &nbsp; Got a new bank card, to replace my stolen one. Hopefully my new care card will arrive soon. Annetta said she'd give me a wallet of hers that she despises, so score there. Nick invited me to go upisland with him and his family for 8 days, at Qualicum. Looks like it'll be a lot of fun. Apprently you can get sand dollars there, so I'll come home and be riiiiiiiich! Ahaha...ahem. 16 days til that, that'll be a lot of fun.  &nbsp; Going to some lake with Ayla today. We're bringing like, every float toy she and I own, and then gonig to raft them all together and go float around the lake in our completely ridiculous array. Too bad Nick's working out or whatever. It'd be fun if he could come too. Hopefully I'll burn nicely, so I can have a more fantastic tan. Be nice if my front and face browned up a bit too. I've given up hope on the legs tanning, but if they did, I wouldn't complain. &nbsp; Anyways. I have to prepare making lists now. Lists for what I have to do before the camp, stuff I need before I go back to school, stuff I need before school, stuff I need upisland.....You know. Have a good one :)

      Hi Sabrina, what's up? :P I don't mind you reading this at all, it's just hard to keep track of everyone. But I think I know who reads this now, and I know I won't offend anyone, hopefully. I'll send you an email later though Sabrina, I've been meaning to catch up with you. And with about 50 other people. It gets hard.  Well, I succeeded in pissing off Nick today, I think. Although, I've been off-and-on mad at him for a few days. I haven't seen him in a while, and I'd like to, and each time I try, I dunno..The responce is less than enthusiastic. When I call him, he's all surprised, and then unresponsive. Which reaaaaaaaaaally bugs me. And then I try and make plans with him, to have him come see me, and stuff, and he never does...He'll be "Oh I'll get up early and do this and this!" and then calls me mid-morning and says he hasn't done anything, and prolly won't be able to do anything. GRAH!. Then we'll talk about stuff that's been planned and junk already, like his dad's birthday party, and going up to qualicum, and he makes it sound that he doesn't really want me to come. And it really ticks me off...I mean, I went out and got something decent to wear to his dad's thing tomorw, and then Nick thought I wasn't gonig to go just cause I was going out and staying up all night. Like, come on. I didn't say that, I said I might be a little dead, or VERY overtired and hyper, but I still wanted to go! Sometimes,.... I just get so mad at him sometimes, that I just want to end it, right there. And then I do it all in my head, yell and scream at him, and then I feel better, and everything's back to normal. But sometimes....I dunno. I just dunno.   If you read this Nicky, disregard it. I'm going to call you before I leave, or tonight when I can get away and do some work (cause I still have oodles of planning for Camp Pringle to do). Alright?I still love you, don't worry. I'll talk to you later.  And for the rest of you.....I dunno. Hi :). Sabrina I added you to the pagey thing. I feel talented now :D Enjoy the heat wave..I wish I was going swimmnig today..*whimper*

      What a day....  So the last two days have been overall fairly crappy and no good.&nbsp; First on Tuesday, I had to get up (always a downside :P). Then when I was making the new page, it crashed several times, and I totally locked up the system. Then I tried burning a cd, and toooootally messed it up, the computer freezing and junk on me. Then on Wednesday it was too hot :P And Ayla was getting difficult. She sees herself as my equal, and not me in a bigger position. Which at times can be QUITE annoying. So we went to Mattick's yesterday, to play mini golf. Nick couldn't come liked planned, couldn't get a stupid ride. Went to my house first, to get my bike. I had to walk through the cob-weby forest. I hate that. Then I went to go pump up my tires, and discovered the little bike wheel cappy thing was BROKEN. Right now it's fixed by duct tape, holding&nbsp;it together. Not pleased though. Then we get to my place, after Ayla beating me at mini golf (but only by three points), and Ayla didn't want to leave, she wanted to go on the computer, so I yelled at her, and we went. Had to walk up through the forest AGAIN. Ran into a stick or something, and scratched up my foot nicely. Finally got to Ayla's house, talked to David and Caran outside, and then went inside to attempt to cool off myself and the house. Turn on the music, just sit down to relax...and my cell rings. I run to go get it..And this is where things got worse, and scarier.  I answer the phone. I can tell by the ring (custom rings rock) that it's Mom, or someone else in my family. I pick it up, and mom's hysterically crying and stuff on the other end, she's cut her foot, it's bleeding everywhere, she needs to go to the hospital, and I need to be there. I start freaking out. I must have ran outside next, and then David and Caran told me to call an ambulance for Mom. So I did, shaking very badly, Ayla comes to the house finally and is filled in, I hang up, Mom's already called the ambulance. I was all prepared to run home, but Ayla had her bike ready for me, and then David told me to get in his truck. We drive down to the house,&nbsp;I run inside with David trailing behind me. I walk in, and there's blood everywhere in the dining room, and up the stairs to the kitchen where Mom is. She was conscious, luckily, I don't know what I would have done if she wasn't. Got her some pillows, and some clothes and David elevated and put pressure on her foot to try and stop the bleeding. I put paper towels everywhere to stop the cat from getting in the blood (but it turns out she's afraid of it anyways) and locked up the house, grabbed Mom's shoes, purse, water and my purse. The ambulance came and we took her to Sanpen, and she ended up getting about 6 stitches. And she can't walk, cause it hurts so damn much. Plus, when she cut her foot, she managed to slice some of her nerve in there, if not all of it, so she can't feel most of her left foot (where the cut is.) She still doesn't really know what happened, and if the scissors went in about another inch or so, she would have hit an artery, and she prolly wouldn't have made it. Pretty goddamn scary.   So yesterday pretty much sucked. And today, as well as yesterday, I had to help out mom do everything, cause obviously she can't do it. And I get to do it until someone else comes home, and/or she can walk on her foot. Yay.....not. But it's a small price to pay. And I dunno. I'm home in the morning anyways. The sad thing is, is that she was cutting out fabric (hence the sharp, deadly scissors) and she bleed all over it...it's dryclean only and cost her nearly $100 for it. So it's pretty expensive stuff, and we've been doing so much to it to try to get the blood out and save it, so it won't be a complete waste. It's really pretty stuff though, blue-ish, but with a purple shine to it..it's gorgeous.  Anyways, I can't leave my mother too long, and I need to check on the fabric, lunch, and the stuff on the line. As well as the stuff that I wanted/needed to do as well. Ciao.

      Look. &nbsp; May I draw your attention to something please? It's right underneath my face, called "Tribute". Click it. Please.  It's something I've just started, so it's nowhere near complete yet. I think I jsut did 4 or 5 people today, and played with the layout and junk. It's hard work you know. And if you don't see your name, or your face yet, or any words underneath your name/face, it's because I haven't gotten to you yet. I've still got a bunch more to do, as well as find everybody's picture.  &nbsp; Have fun reading the "Testimonials" as they are rightly called. I'll be babysitting today and tomorw, so if you're important, I'll call you. If you aren't, well..have fun :) Email me. &nbsp;Out!

      Graf.... &nbsp; &nbsp; Gonig to Pease Lake again today, it's so gorgeous there...It's like a puddle, surrounded by trees, so serene and gorgeous. I really like it there. On Saturday me and Ayla went, and brought Maxy out in the boat, and floated around..I performed a marathon (yet terribly exhausting) swim across the lake to my air materess floating away towards shore...it was fun. I was surprised I was able to do it. Nearly died after though.  &nbsp; Two weeks till we leave, I'm excited. I've made a list of stuff I should bring, and remember to bring (surprisedly, I always, ALWAYS seem to forget deoderant..> &nbsp; I'm stuck babysitting her tomorow and wednesday. But I'll bring over my DVD's,&nbsp; and maybe go to Nick's and bum some of his :P and I've got more yarn, so I can crochet, and maybe actually finish my quilt....That'd be so cool if I could. Anyways, I'm hungrey. And still sleepy. Ciao (mmm..chow..) peoples. &nbsp; Ullgh.....I have so much work to do and bring with me to Qualicum..stupid....everything.

      Ick.  Some fire in Prince George has blown all of its smoke to Victoria, and now we're surrounded by a creepy, eeiry cloud which the sun can still shine though, but casts a scary, evil light around everywhere. It's disgusting. I can't wait for a wind to come along and blow it all away. Evidently it's travelled 600 miles to get here though. Hope it travells another 600 to leave.  Was at the lake today, cause I had nothing better to do but sit around on my materess and float around for 3 hours. As I slowly drifted into shore to my warm, awaiting towel, I happened to glance upon a disgusting young couple making out on the beach. It wasn't really that disgusting, at all, either, it just added to my extremely bitter mood. They were totally oblivous to everyone and everything around them, cuddling, and kissing, laughing. I don't know why&nbsp;it made me so bitter, I guess just because of the bitter, no good, self-deprieciation mood i'm in currently (won't that make you so pleased to hear Dan, the ever powerful has feelings too, and is now feeling like crap. Awww... *pukes on you*). In any case, I can't wait to get my butt out of here and into my boyfriend's arms, upisland.   And oh man. I have so many chances to finally get even with Dan. Now the question is, should I be a vindictive, bitter bitch and risk all my remaining friends getting pissed at me? Or behave myself, and let this golden oppertunity pass?
