      I barely slept last night. A combination of nervous excitement and the fact that my room was probably 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, I think. Speaking of temperature, I totally don't understand the metric system. Celcius, centigrade, and so forth. No witty reason why. Not this early.   There was a time last fall where I got up this early to enjoy sunrises. That was, unfortunately, short-lived.     ...How can we not love  this world for what it gives us? How can we not hate it for what it takes away?  from "Pastel Dresses" by Stephen Dobyns   This post got suddenly nostalgic...Well, I must get dressed and in the car. I have a really long day in front of me. See all of you later.

      The flight leaves tomorrow at 10:20 am, meaning I'll have to get to the airport at 7:30 am. And I'm not completely packed yet...   I'm ready to be there. In London. Wow. I'll post more later when I have time.

      I know, I know...I  promised you a blog, full of interesting stories and pictures. I have failed you, friends. I went off to london and was selfish. And really busy. I did send a grand total of three mass e-mails that only scratched the surface of my experience and for that I am begging for forgiveness.  But I'm back now...with five CDs full of pictures. We can have some dinner and then move into the family room for "Slideshow London 2004." Hooray!! I promise, they are not boring. Some are rather...well, you'll just have to see.  I met some people over there. I saw some theatre. Some good, some great...learned oh so much...and I miss it like my first-born child (but that was a long time ago, and I hear she owns her own bakery in Cincinnati. They grow up so fast...sniff). Pictures are coming. I accidently erased some last night. The things I do when I'm tired. And they were really good. A lot of pictures from my last day at RADA. You know, important pictures of people that I love to death, and won't see again...ever!!  That was a bit dramatic and completely false. I actually hate them.  (No I really don't)   (Yes I do)     No, I will see them again. And soon.  Luckily, one of the guys I met there is from Atlanta. We are able to help each other cope with the withdrawal symptoms: uncontrollable weeping when anything London crosses our line of vision, uncanny desire to pay whenever we have to use the toilet, saying "toilet" instead of "bathroom" or "restroom" or "washroom" (for you non-Southerners, and by that I mean Canadians and other backwards cultures), etc. It's hard, okay.  But enough whining. Life presses inexorably forward and upward and onward, and from here I will travel only at the prow of myself, as a strange woman I know says.  Oh the stories I can tell, and the pictures I have to prove it...until later, my babies...
