      Lalie's supposed to get here around 9pm so i asked her if she wanted me to cook her dinner, and she said yes (and other things that are irrelevant here lol). this was on the phone, and i was at work. so on my way back home i stopped at the store and bought food for like eight pple (cuz i have no sense of proportion like that).i plan on cookin chicken basquaise with tagliatelle, yum yum... then as i arrived here i realized my fridge was already full of food, mostly vegetables,.. and im goin for the weekend. meh. im so stupid. what am i gonna do with the food =/  just thinkin about my own carelessness sickens me sometimes...  oh and ive been avoidin Keith at school all day today and yesterday cuz i dunno what to tell him about the band thing, haha... im so permanently undecided its ANNOYIN... singin again would be fun, but then it'd be weird, and i dunno if i can actually put effort into that. i didnt even consider doin that really, but Nella that teacher keeps naggin me about it, and if i say yes, i'll have to convince myself that i can do good.   anywaaaaays off to Madrid ! weeee

      today i was in the subway and i was lookin for the price of RER tickets on a machine that delivers these tickets and a beggar comes up to me. so he asks me for money and as im lookin thru my purse (yea i was in a generous mood) he sees that i was lookin for somethin on the machine. so for some reason he decides to help me out, and we started talkin about why i wanted to buy these tickets and blabla. he was really kind and helpful and he gave me all the info i needed, which saved me the time i wouldve spent in the queue at the information office..  anyways i finally found my wallet and i gave him money and that was a terribly awkward moment. the fact that we'd been talkin and socializin and exchangin something apparently made it really weird for him to receive money from me. we didnt say that but there was a blank in the convo as i handed him the money and we both looked embarrassed. does this mean that beggars only want money from strangers with no name? or does this mean i subconsciously would have preferred to consider him as a stranger with no name? human relationships are so encoded with rituals, pre set situations that u cant free yourself from that it makes me wanna scream. was i goin astray by exchangin a few words with someone who begs in the streets? the man was too thin to look healthy but he was pretty anyway. and he had a cool piercing

      so ive been lookin thru old stuff, and i found a piece of paper with a poem on it that i wrote when i was like 10yo :  "la peau de tes mains sur la peau de mon corps c'est comme de l'or comme le soleil qui m'étreint"  means : "the skin of your hands on the skin of my body feels like gold like the sun is embracing me"  *rolls eyes* at the age of 10 i already knew what i wanted haha

      I see love and beauty all around, I also see the sadness that's embedded in your frown  I wonder why you choose not to talk to those around, I sense a fear of lifting heavy feet  higher than you want to, I just want to believe your truth...   you stand there but you do not cast a shadow, you walk away with every word you choose not to say  I suppose that moving on paints a new colour for each day, I don't like to see  dreams put on the shelf, to deal with on that one day, I just want to be happy for you   'cause I only have one second, this minute today  I can't press rewind and turn it back and call it now  and so this moment, I just have to sing out loud  and say I love I like and breathe in now  and say I love I live and breathe in now   I move on holding on to what I learn, it's time to let go of the notion  that the whole world's against me  break free of shackles that formed young, time free in now  until you know, it's not all up to me, I can count on another  so move on lighter and be free ....   'cause I only have one second, this minute today  I can't press rewind and turn it back and call it now  and so this moment, I just have to sing out loud  and say I love I like and breathe in now  and say I love I live and breathe in now   I believe in for today I just want to know that you're okay  cause I believe in for today  I just want to know that you're okay....   'cause I only have one second, this minute today  I can't press rewind and turn it back and call it now  and so this moment, I just have to sing out loud  and say I love I like and breathe in now  and say I love I live and breathe in now  and say I love I live and breathe in now

      Had a dream about an island, scents and birds, trees and cold rain We’re shipwrecked, hungry, tired, lost Forgotten by all, far away from the laws that rule the world Lyin down on the sand and the brightness of your hair And the brightness of your hair makes a dark grave around u I resuscitate u to the sound of my confession That neither the shore nor the waves will repeat It’s a dream. Your soul is a bird that flies to ruby and emerald colored horizons  And your broken soul is a night bird And to keep u, and to submit u, precious prey, to my boredom, and to tame u to my warm hugs, I’ll say “everywhere is crowded today”  Shipwrecked, unravelin your life, and mine But I decided we’d forget what it was like before the sand in your hair and the ruby and emerald colored horizons It’s a dream.  It’s a dream where we don’t remember whats right, whats wrong, and that two wrongs don’t make a right

      - do u think theres somethin like shrimp farming? cuz i mean, some shrimps u buy in stores are like huge, and if i saw one of those swimmin in the ocean beside me it would scare the hell outta me  - food i dont eat : potatoes, bread, and (i found a new one) sugar. i mean i eat sweet things (oreos =P) but i dont have any sugar at my place i also dont eat rabbit but thats for obvious reasons.  which makes me think i spent like 30 minutes watchin the bunny eatin grass in my neighbors garden this afternoon and i came to a conclusion : not only do i miss my cat but i also miss my bunnies ='(

      paranoid psycho stress wore me out to the point where i couldnt even see the screen as i was talkin to pple on msn.. then i ..dunno what happened, i decided to shake it off and i slept for 10 hours. i thought i was gonna cry out of joy when i woke up and i felt like id been sleepin a week and when i looked at the clock.  my first thought was to actually log on again just to tell gabe that id been sleepin well. i figure its been worryin pple, altho i didnt really mention that to anyone, but lack of sleep and procrastination drove me crazy. the moments outside were ok tho, pple at school, different concerns, sex talk in a pub, mixed salad in a restaurant, drink, drink drink, caroline and her 21 lovers (haha), anne and the way she hugs me, and the kids who want me as their teacher next year, Adrien, my sister and her man whos passed his exams... ive slept so much i wanna go back to bed again =)

      i always assume pple are bein ironic, when they're merely sayin honest simple things.. examples: - Noëlle, seein a regular orange tee in a shop : " im gonna buy this crazy orange top cuz its so crazy to wear that and im gonna wear it cuz im a FUN girl like that " me : "haha, yea, SOOO crazy" her : "huh?" me : "ah, oh ok.. u meant all that" i mean who the hell cares if she wears an orange top, its not "crazy", its just an orange top. the very same convo happened with Caroline, and the Union Jack thongs. im wearin that, it doesnt make me feel "kuh-ray-zee"... i dunno..  - Noëlle again : " im gonna get a second bacardi breezer, i'll be completely wasted " yea Noëlle, u're wild  *rolls eyes*  - Noëlle again (is it me or is she naive?) : " those kids were actually smokin weed !!!!11!1! like, in the school !!!! " oh yea, thats so unusual  - me (just tryin to make a point) : "kids actually like it when u come up with weird stuff in class, it gives them somethin to tell their friends, and they remember the lesson better, cuz its related to somethin they found funny. like if u mime things to get them to guess what u're sayin in english, or if u bring props or w/e" Françoise : " or if u come to class with a piercin *wink wink*  " oh yea, thats SO weird (plus wth does that have to do with anythin)   im probably the weird one then...

      It's getting so lonely inside this bed Don't know if I should lick my wounds or say woe is me instead And there's an aching inside my head It's telling me I'm better off alone But after midnight morning will come And the day will see if you will get some  They say that girl ya know she act too tough tough tough Well it's til I turn off the light, turn off the light They say that girl you know she act so rough rough rough Well it's til I turn off the light, turn off the light And I say follow me follow me follow me down down down down til you see all my dreams Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems  I looked above the other day Cuz I think I'm good and ready for a change I live my life by the moon If it's high play it low, if it's harvest go slow and if it's full, then go But after midnight morning will come And the day will see if you're gonna get some  I'm searching for things that I just cannot see Why don't you don't you don't you come and be with me I pretend to be cool with me, want to believe That I can do it on my own without my heart on my sleeve I'm running, I'm running, catch up with me life Where is the love that I'm looking to find It's all in me, can't you see, why can't you, why can't you see, it's all in me  All in me Where is your logic Who do you need Where can you turn in your delicate time of need Follow me down down down down down, I do not need I do not need nobody Follow me down, follow me down down down, I do not need I do not need nobody Follow me follow me down down down down til you see all my dreams, see all my dreams Follow me follow me follow me down down down down til you see all my dreams, see all my dreams Where is your logic Who do you need Where can you turn in your delicate time of need

      so i left on friday, and arrived late for the eurostar, cuz there was a (tiny) bomb in a station of the suburban train i took, and we got stuck two stations away from where i was goin, pffft. sometimes its annoyin to be in paris, theres always somethin, meh. anyways, i did catch the train at the last minute. we were all excited and we annoyed everybody cuz we kept talkin in the train.  we took the tube in london, thank god we kno how that works, cuz its so complicated, its like, u gotta have a degree in geography to find your way in there! anyways we got to the b&b we had booked, which was in Notting Hill (yea, thats the way u gotta treat a girl), and... WOW. that was the best place i ever stayed in. the lady let us enter a first room, with twin beds, lovely and all, and she said there had been a misunderstanding, and that someone would have to sleep in another room upstairs. so i volunteered to be the one left out, and we went upstairs, and it was like the loveliest room ever, with a HUGE bed (which i took a pic of, lol, i mean the place was like twice the size of my place here !). i had a tv and a couch and a mini fridge and everything u need to make tea, woohoo.  So we got ready and went out to the pub at the corner, and started drinkin. then we went to Tiger lil's, which is an asian restaurant at Islington. u pile up veggies and meat in a plate and then they cook it in a wok in front of u with noodles and sauce and all, so u can choose what u're eatin and yea, it was great. australian wine.  then it was like 12 so we went out in the street and pple gave us fliers for clubs (random guys callin u "baby", wth). we went to this club where they played music from the 80s, haha that was fun. guys started talkin to us and i found myself explainin to that dude what the lyrics of madonna's "like a virgin" really mean, accordin to Tarantino (thats in Reservoir dogs). so yea, that was kinda weird and i reckon pple are not used to hearin strangers tellin them that kinda thing, but i was drunk, heh. he got all excited cuz i was french, and i had to listen to the eternal "french pple are arrogant" speech, pffft, can u tell he wasnt bein original.. i told him to calm down and when we left he said itd been nice to meet me and he had respect for me cuz i didnt let him touch me or w/e when a lot of girls would have wilfully cheated on their bf.. wth is with cheaters these days, geez, is it like a new trend? i dont find it really hard to not cheat on someone if u really care for them and dont wanna hurt them (yea, im talkin about u lovah, lol). anyways its the same as in france, and everywhere in the world i guess, guys in clubs are part of the 'desperate for sex' species. moderately sex-cravin guys dont go to clubs. (yea,  not  sex-cravin guys dont exist). so yea, we went back to the hotel. i couldnt sleep, of course. blah. so a couple of non-sleep hours later we went to the market on Portobello Rd, where i bought : union jack thongs, haha, (no comment please, that was a joke, lol), hilarious postcards for pple =), (i only found those after i sent Val hers, so yea, sorry hun, u didnt get a funny card), i bought funky colored rollin paper, and junk food. then we went to Harrods, where we spent like an hour in the toy department playin with kids toys cuz we're still 8 =). we also went to Oxford Street and all, spent some time in Mango (yea thats where i got u your top Roxy), Topshop  etc. *sigh* i love London.  ok, then in the evening we went to GalliPolli at Islington again. thats a turkish restaurant (turkish? not sure in fact.. man i dont even kno what i ate) but it has the most delicious.. stuff. lol the food was awesome =).  then we went to Cargo, a club somewhere (i dont remember cuz i was pretty wasted after the wine at GalliPolli -- Chilien wine that was in fact imported from France, we discovered that later lol). the club was awesome in terms of pple, but the dj only played techno music, so yea, we didnt really enjoy that. so instead of dancing we drank more, Bacardi Breezer (woohoo, cranberry bacardi IS tasty). i went up to a girl and i randomly told her she was really hot, and she looked at me weird, haha. i was only sayin, i mean i added that i was just tellin her that cuz it was a shame that no one had told her that in the past hour. yea ok im probably weird, but wouldnt u like it if someone randomly told u u were beautiful? she looked really british, only without the sl*tty clothes, heh. british girls dress like wh*res, excuse my french. i mean i had never seen shorter skirts, i wonder how they dont get raped -- maybe they do =(. anyways, we left the club and went to a different one where we got in for free cuz it was gonna close in an hour. the music was better but yea, we were tired. we took the bus home and in the bus a guy asked me if pple did weed in France. duu-uh. we also have better weed, idiot. (lol) i didnt say that tho. i almost fell asleep in the bus too, so i was hopin he'd stop talkin to me. 5 hours of sleep at the hotel.  next day was Camden Town day =). It was great as well. I bouuuught : a 'Nightmare before Xmas' handbag, it looks SO cool, a shroom patch to sew on my jeans, a new barbell, weeee, and i refrained from buyin shoes... then we went to Sainsbury to spend the last pounds we had and i bought more junk food to bring back home. we ran back to the b&b to get our luggage, and we had to take a taxi to Victoria cuz we were late for the eurostar. that cost us 15 FRIGGIN QUIDS. ugh. Madrid's taxis are so cheap, i cant believe how expensive english taxis are.  anyways, we took the eurostar altho none of us wanted to go back to Paris. in the train we phoned Azad cuz Caroline wanted to kno how the football game was goin, so yea, that was 1-0 for England at the time. then we arrived in Paris, Noëlle and I took the suburban train and Caroline was home before we arrived so she called me on my cell to yell in my ear that we had won the game. good good.  i went home and i put on my eyebrow barbell and i hurt myself in the process ='(. then i went online to read my emails. nice quizzes u sent me mates, i didnt kno Cendre thought Gabe and I were her thexiest friends, how weird is that, lol. then i got struck by a terrible feeling of loneliness, as i had spent the weekend with pple and was findin myself alone again ='(. so i was a lil sad to be home, altho val, natie and matt talked to me a bit, but yea, i missed my lovah  i went to bed and i skipped the first class today cuz i couldnt wake up (yea i had missed my bed as well, lol).  all day long i had my kids watch movies cuz i hadnt prepared any lesson for them, lol. so i watched the first 50 minutes of Sleepy Hollow 3 times and the first 50 minutes of Back to the Future twice. it can get boring, for me, but they enjoyed it a lot.  i think we're watching movies til the end of the schoolyear =) (well the end of both movies first and then i dunno). i drove another teacher back home cuz im nice like that (and i do that every monday too, lol) went to the store and bought drinks and food, and here i am. phew, that was long and probably boring for whoevers readin, but it was nice for me to write all that. great memories from my london trip =)... i cant believe i was there just yesterday, i think im gonna do that more often =)  im gonna shut up now and hurry Gabe cuz i wanna kno about your weekend

      first hour : they're a class of older students (14 goin on 15), and they're finished with their final exams and grades and all, yet they still have lessons (stupid eh?). of course they didnt give a damn about anythin i had to tell them so in the end i decided they could just do what they wanted. one wasted hour   next class was my class with only 11 kids, they're the cool ones that i talk to online. so lets see, we talked about teachers, movies, make up. i sang a song for them and i drew stuff on their copy books. thats about it. no english lesson whatsoever. i didnt feel like workin and they didnt either. it was too hot in the room too  last class was almost a normal lesson, only they really worked for like 15 minutes (out of 55) cuz they couldnt focus cuz it was too hot there and pple were playin basket ball outside. i couldnt focus either.  then i had a staff meetin. that was long and borin and by the end of it the principal told me it wasnt really compulsory for me to come. YEA THANK U FOR TELLIN ME AFTERWARDS  so yea. i have no clue why i woke up this mornin. and to think i get paid for that  im eatin vegetarian lasagna =)

      i miss my lovah ='(   last night i got drunk (out of boredom mostly) and i talked for like 3 hours to one of my students and im afraid i must have said things (things i wouldnt say if i was sober), haha thats kinda pathetic tho the good point is that she's the best kid ever (i remember tellin her that shes lovely and brilliant, she must have thought i was hittin on her, lol) and shes clever enough to actually still be a good student in class even if she knos stuff about me... heh... i think

      i still havent slept properly. went to bed at 1am fell asleep around 2 woke up at 4. i also had a nightmare in which Gabe and Adrien were both locked in a room where pple were torturing them and i was locked outside =(.  i watched mtv to recover, there was the cure, phoenix, hoobastank, kelis, blink, maroon 5, franz ferdinand (yea i finally kno what they look like, well sorta), alanis, the lost prophets and fortunately no sign of j-lo =) and i saw an episode of Daria (go mystic spiral !!).. then i watched 3 Spongebob episodes in a row, gotta love kids channels.. good stuff  i hope Val and Arno are behaving.. or not, hehe  i have received a postcard from Noémie and Adeline (who are still in ireland). contents of the card : "hey ! did u find your way home? we're goin back to france soon, but we couldnt not send u a card from the Guinness Storehouse. we thought of u with each sip we drank... hope we can share one with u soon.. x x x" =) i have also received a car insurance bill. contents of the letter (thats summed up, they also insulted me) : " u owe us €324.07" =(  i have a song stuck in my head and writing this didnt stop me from singin it "and so i have to say before i go that i just want u to kno.. i've found a reason for me to change who i used to be, a reason to start over new, and the reason is u"

      time spent tossing and turning : 5 hours time spent having nightmares : 1 hour (not sure tho) time remaining : all my life? its not a good idea to drive i suppose things found in my bed : a hair pin, a book and a VCR remote control time spent properly thinking : none  davy just phoned me. he went "phew im tired, i just woke up, i went to bed at 2am" and i was like "aw poor thing". pffft to me... i need to start talking and stop worrying  im going to go drive to Orléans. will be back in 2 days

      The crappy Irish weather Pple say the Irish weather sucks big time. i’ve been there. i kno it does. watchin the forecast is useless there, as its rainy and cold everyday at some point. i got tricked a couple of times, like, when i left home it was really hot and sunny, so i put on a tank top and an hour later i had to keep my arms folded so that pple would start listenin to me and stop starin at my breasts (nipples have independent reactions). ah the shame  The scary Irish pple girls : all look alike, so much that its SCARY. I noticed they were all wearing pink clothes, and one day I was sittin at a café and I started observing all the girls passin by in Grafton St and I swear I haven’t found one who wasn’t wearin at least one pink item (the total pink look is really scary too). (The only girls I saw who werent wearing pink were Spanish so I don’t count them.) The irish teacher I worked with wore a different pink tee every single day.  guys :  they watch/play/talk about soccer/gaelic football a lot. boring. they’re also scary. they look big and like they’re gonna hit u if u say something they don’t like. and Irish bus drivers are really really rude.  generally : irish pple don’t smile. maybe they dunno how to, GO FIGURE  Dublin, a one-horse-place  Dublin’s fair city is SO small. (that’s compared to other european capitals). Don’t get me wrong, i like the city but geez, just 2 weekends there and u’ve seen everything there is to see (shops and pubs included). They make it look big by havin a hundred McD and Burger Kings everywhere. u tend to see the trick when u’ve passed 5 of those in the same street.  The national sport, aka drinkin Any kind of alcoholic drink (say, a lager) is like 5 freakin euros there. I’d have to get a second job if i wanted to get drunk. The easy trick would have been be to have guys buy me drinks, which they seemed eager to do, but that would have been mean considering I didn’t intend to sleep with them plus i was dead scared of them (see § about guys above). After wasting €25 one night just to feel only slightly dizzy, I decided to stay sober (how ironic, I mean, hello, I was in Ireland).   Best memory Noémie (cool gal) and i laughed a lot at the idea that since Ireland is a tiny island, intermarrying must be a rule, and that explains the lookin-alike thing.  i also laughed when Kathleen (our host mom) said something about Coronation Street and Noémie understood “Cornichon Street” (Gherkin Street). Kathleen was really the sweetest person. Funny accent too, she is Scottish.  In conclusion, after much thinking, i prefer England.

       ...in black  ooh its good to be home =)  when i dont sleep i can go online/put the music on/run around naked (yea ok i dont do that, but the point is I COULD), YAY  it took me like 10 hours to arrive home. 10 freakin hours !! and when i arrived in Noisy there wasnt any taxi in sight so i walked home -- with my big bag =( -- and i passed pple who i thought were gonna steal my money (haha what money?) and rape me as a lil perk on the side... that was scary =( anyway they didnt so i suspect i was looking poor and ugly =)

      i just love goin to the swimming-pool when its raining outside a) cuz theres practically no one there -- for some reason pple dont usually go to the swimming-pool when the weathers bad, even if its indoors (stupid pple, haha).. so yea, the pool is empty, u dont bump into pple, and more important u dont bump into your students  b) cuz its all warm and bright inside yet u can see the dark rainy sky above u =)   look at me, im all wet and tired =)

      so i woke up with the phone at half ten. i pick it up 50% of the time now. theres like 4 pple i gotta call back or had to call back last week. that also makes me feel guilty and i really dont need that. if pple didnt call me id be sad but when they call i dont pick up the phone, so i dont kno what i want. so i got up and i turned on the tv and there was this video of an american guy who was bein tortured by iraqis. so i turned it off and i started cryin a lil for no reason and after some time i realized i had been cryin for half an hour. i am tired of that. i also feel like i have a hangover so i wonder whats the point in tryin to stay sober since i dont feel any better. i think i shouldnt think too much. theres a good thing about this blog, i dont feel like im complainin to someone. havin said that, theres only one person who reads it, so yea.
