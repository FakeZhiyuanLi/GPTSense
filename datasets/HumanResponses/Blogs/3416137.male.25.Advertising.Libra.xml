      For all those who wonder where the name Herm came from, this blog is for you.  As most of you know, my last name is Hyte.  Growing up, my family and I would always try to think of creative first names for Mike (my brother) and my future children.  Such as term, krypton, neeph, and transvest.  (there are plenty more)  Well, during a volleyball trip in Canada, I was telling some of my teammates about these names.  One of them suggested I name one of them Herman Alfred.  For Hermaphrodyte.  They said we could call him Herm for short.  Everybody started calling me that, and so it kind of stuck.

      My buddy Brian and I one random day, thought it would be funny to video record the new "provo attraction".  My buddy Brian tells the story--            I have been living in Provo for about four years and I was just barely introduced to one of Provo's finest characters. A friend of mine told me about this man and where he could be found. I call him "Middle Finger Man" (MFM)because no one knows his real name. These man sits on his porch all day every day and flips off everyone that drives by and has been doing this for years. He is so reliable to be there that you can actually give directions according to this man as a landmark. "Yeah, head up Geneva and then when you see middle finger man, then I am the second turn after him....etc" When I heard about this guy, I just couldn't believe it. I thought that would have to be the funniest thing that I have seen for a while. So i hopped on my motorcycle and headed over to Geneva Road. I drove over the bridge that spans the Provo River and counted the houses, " One House, two houses, three houses." I didn't see him at first and thought that i would go home without seeing him then BAM! There he was on his porch and AS SOON as I caught eyes with him, both fingers went flying up and stayed there til I was out of sight. I couldn't believe it. I quickly turned around to try it again. Same thing happened. so I tried it six more times (8 total) and just chuckled each time.  Well, I went home that night and shared my adventure with a few friends. They didn't know what to think. It was on my mind thru the night. Finally I got wondering to my self, " Self, this guy definitely has speed with his fingers, but how is his endurance?" So I devised a plan.  The next day my buddy Dave and I headed over to MFM's house again with my video camera. What I decided to do was just to pull off in front of his house and challenge him to a battle. I would hold the camera on him and he would hold his fingers toward me. I'm not sure what would happen, but I knew it would be fun.  Dave and I headed over there and pulled off to the side of the road. We waited til the traffic cleared and then made our approach. MFM saw me and my camera and assumed his position...middle fingers up. I made my challenge and he accepted it with his version of a thumbs up. We tried to talk to him a few times, but he was not interested in conversation. Well, long story not as long, it was a little over two minutes before he finally lowered his hands in defeat. He also broke with a smile because he knew he was beat. All in all it was a good time...and don't worry, I posted the video for your viewing pleasure. you can find it at  urlLink www.provo411.com/mfm  it starts off a little blurry and shaky, but that stops after a few moments. I suppose that viewer discrestion is advised if you don't like the gesture of the middle finger. I am determined to meet this guy and talk with him!!!        Well, I (Dave now) told my brother-in-law of this video.  He watched it at work and got a kick out of it.  So he forward it to people, and they forward it to people.  Before long it was all over Nu Skin, it got sent to Germany, Hong Kong, All over UVSC.    He also told people were calling him, letting him know of this video and how he had to tell them he sent it out.  And to top it all off, my brother-in-law's neighbor's wife's brother (notice how I didn't finish it off with brother's dog to show that it is not an exaggeration)stopped by the other night, and just randomly brought up this video that he received via email.  He said, "dude, I got the funniest email forward to me about this guy who flips people off when they drive by."  Darin (my bro-in-law) had to tell them that it was his bro-in-laws and his buddies' video.  Bytheway this guy worked at some mortgage company.  Anyways I thought it was funny how it got out so fast and how wide it's range was.

      Have you ever been in a group of people where there are people you have never met?  And then one of these new people comes up and ask you what your name is and where you are from?  Creating the perfect opportunity for you to ask the same questions back, but realize you really don't want to?  You tell yourself, that you do not care what there name is or where they are from?  Most of the time it's shrugged off and the "don't care" reason is blamed.  Well, I don't think that's fair.  I mean if you really did not care you could at least ask them and then tune out.  But you don't even do that.  Why?  Because you are to lazy.  To lazy to open your mouth and mumble a sentance.  That is a true sign of a lazy person.

      I was just thinking today about a nap.  I asked myself what is a nap?  I looked it up in dictionary.com and it said "A brief sleep, often during the day." How many people, when asked what they did that day , say "I took a nap."  They then go on to say that it was for two or three hours.  I am guilty of it too, so this is not a premature judgement made before casting the beam out of my own eye.  But here's the thing a nap is a BRIEF sleep.  In my opinion, and many would agree, that two or three hours is not considered brief.  Therefore, it is really not a nap in the true sence of the word.  I believe one could say I slept for two hours and be 100% correct. However, I feel these two or three hour sleeping times are getting a raw end of a deal.  So I suggest creating a word for these non-naps/non full nights sleep.  Maybe a mini sleep, or perhaps prolonged nap.  Or maybe we could combine the two and call it a slenap?  Let me know if you have any ideas.
