      ok, so i just got done hanging out with mary over here. that was.......very very fun. i also found out today i passed all my classes first semester with a C and above in every class. this is by far, the best, most fun day ever. im still shaking, she left 20 minutes ago. gah! its just sooooooo gah! the goodbye was almost as good, if not better, than all the stuff before it. wow, i just am so really really...... actually not riled up right now. the goodbyes took like a lot of energy out of me, it was that nice. im in the best mood right now, not much could bring me down. now only two things left. get billy happy. get mary p. happy. hmm, mary shouldnt be that hard, just gotta find her a good guy....*rolles eyes* that wont be hard at all. all the stupid guys just dont even see who she really is, they just see her old reputation! it makes me soooo mad! oooo, and arsenio, i just wanna smack that boy! oh well, hopefuly he'll come to his sences and see how much she loves him. well, hope the rest of the month/year/life is as good as this.

      heyhey, its been like 2 days or w/e, maybe three. quite a bit has happened since then. well, not really, but im gunna say it anyways. well, wednesday was gunna be the day i was looking foreward to for the whole week. notice WAS GUNNA. that was supposed to be the day me and billy went to group and met up with kathy and mary, it should have been fun and all cause i was supposed to talk with mary...well, that was all kinda killed when mary's mom tweaked at her and grounded her from group that night. well that was a big huge letdown. on the upside, mary gave kathy her notebook (poems) to give to me so i could read it and write some of my own in it. i found two pictures of mary in the back and a letter for me, easily the best day of this week. now whats even better, my dad is gone for 2 whole weeks! two weeks! no dad, no adults, no ANYONE. i get to just hang out and relax for 2 weeks. my time will be spent sitting on my ass at the computer, and in the hottub. now on saturday...mary might be coming over. it all depends on her mom and if she tweaks again! hopefully that wont fall through. ive been thinking lately about people and the past, the biggest thing that came to my head was josh. it seems like its been soooo long since he left us, but it really hasnt. its hard to think of him. but anyways! on a lighter note. im starting to become more happy, my week is looking up, not as many things are going wrong. i guess mary is feeling better, so thats a big plus. billy and kathy i think are finally totaly over, so thats kinda a bummer, but she did soooo much shit to him that its just like, good riddence. then of course there is the fact that she is my only way to see mary, so i hope she sticks around. who knows, maybe billy and kathy will somehow get back together once she finds out about tom and ashley. i just really want my friends to be happy, doesnt matter how, just be happy! ok, im done, if i think of anything, ill put it in here.

      ok, so today was a shitty day. still thinking about my friend and how stupid life is. its just so hard to believe in anything. so many people have so many problems. the good things are just soo small, they dont add up. all the bad things just overwhelm us all and drag us down. the only thing you can do is try to find something that makes you happy, and just throw yourself at it. oh well, enough of the sadness. at least i get to go to group tomorrow and see everyone. mary and i are just gunna sit in billy's car and talk for the whole time. we both have some things that we need to tell each other. i hope everyone is feeling ok!

      so i dont know what im writing, im just trying to keep my hands occupied. i dont know whats going on. its like everything is falling down around me. the only good things i have in my life right now are mary and billy. my dads moving to Arizona, im going to hafta live with my mom till i leave for the marines. kathy is fucking with everything. toms being a dumbass. mary is having a really hard time. one of my friends started cutting. wow, that brings back so many memories i thought i had gotten rid of. so many memories i wish i had gotten rid of. but whats sacrier, i can still feel the razor slide across my skin. i can still feel my skin separate. i can see the red of blood. the only thing that hasnt come back, is the physical pain. i want to feel it again soo bad, just once more. but i know if i do, im going to keep doing it, and i wont be able to stop. im afraid of what is going to happen when i walk in my room and see my knives sitting on my dresser. im afraid im going to pick one up and just start in. im afraid im going to take it to the next step, cut deeper, longer. but at the same time, i want to feel the blade, i NEED to feel it. its almost painful not to. well, im going to bed....... maybe ill post tomorrow, who knows.

      ok. so theres only two things that could make me feel more depressed than i already am. 1) billy dying. 2) mary leaving me forever. i really doubt this day could really get any worse than it has already. i just found out one of my friends started to SI again. wow, you cant imagine how that makes me feel. i thought i was finally over all of that, now i talk to my friend, and find out its all back. i just wanna go back in my room and use one of the knives i got for xmas and bleed a slow slow death. that would just solve all of my problems, right here. anyone have any views on that...well oh well, it dont really matter. im gunna do what i want. oh well. see you all later...maybe

      yay! today was sooo much better than yesterday......NOT! i wish sometimes that everyone would just die off and leave me alone. sometimes people can be sooo retarded and soooo selfish. all they think about it mememememememememe. most of the day i just sat in class and stayed to myself. i got new classes today, so that was a change. im not in any classes with mary anymore, but i see her in the halls and i can say hi pretty much whenever i want, so its all good. so ive got first hour with jessica, chem should be interesting this year. im gunna laugh if Tillou puts us in a group together. i think im gunna request andy as my partner, cause he's like the coolest kid in my class. so me and mary are gunna talk on wednesday about stuff. im kinda scared shes gunna get kinda distant after she learns some things, you never know........ but who knows, its all up to chance.

      ok, so today i got to talk to mary G. that was nice, cause we didnt get to hang out. we figured a few things out, but we still have sooooo much to figure out. on wednesday im going to tell her something that only a select few know about, and i didnt even tell them, they accidentally found out. so its gunna be interesting, im kinda scared shes gunna get scared off.

well, so i got to talk to mary P. as well. that was interesting, i found out she really really really needs someone she can talk to. shes kinda havin a hard time with all thats goin on in her life right now. its really sad, cause theres only so much i can do. its like i wanna help, but i dont know what to do! it would be nice if she was happy, at least just for like one day. IM gettin sad cause mary is sad. ive got this thing, if i have sad friends, i get sad. its wierd, its like i take their sadness into me. gah its annoying!

WHAT THE FUCK!? I JUST FOUND OUT FROM BILLY LIKE 30 SECONDS AGO THAT KAT AND TOM FULL CONTACT KISSED, LIKE ALL OUT. IM SO FUCKING PISSED OFF AT HER! SHE TOLD BILLY SHE WASN'T GUNNA KISS HIM, SHE TOLD BILLY SHE WAS DONE WITH GUYS AND SHE WANTED TO BE ALONE. SHE EVEN PROMISED MARY SHE WOULDNT BE PHYSICAL WITH TOM OR BILLY. GOD I HATE DRAMA! SOMEONE KILL ME NOW

ok, so this is quite possibly the worst day ever. mary is uber sad, i cant help her, therefore im sad. and now billy is uber depressed. it would be sooooo easy.............

      ok, so last night: mary kat and billy were over. after watching Linkin Park: Live In Texas, mary decided that she was going to go lay down in my room, with the lights off, and i was going to join her. i obviously didnt have a problem with this, except for the fact that billy and kat were out in my livingroom. i guess mary had it all figured out. she said "if we're in here, they have a chance to talk!" so after a while we heard them start talking to each other and figured they would be ok. for the first little while, we just laid there under my blanket on my bed and listened to one of the cd's i made her. but when Everything by Lifehouse came on things kinda changed. see, thats our song, and i was singing it to her. my lips were against her neck and after the first like 30 seconds of the song she just turned and kissed me. well, after that it was mainly just a make out time. we stopped for a little bit and had a really good talk. but what she doesnt know: i was telling her some things that were hard to say, and for some reason tears came to my eyes. i kept telling her how i felt and everything that was goin on in my head and my heart, and i just started crying! thank god she didnt see... after that we just kinda kept kissing, everything melded together and i totaly lost track of time. before i knew it, it was like 9pm and she had to get ready to go at 9:30. let me tell you, most depressing moment of my life!

well, now im just waiting for the other mary to get online. we hafta talk about some stuff that happened, some people got the wrong messages from things they overheard. they think me and mary pivec are fooling around! i dont know why...i really can't see me and mary getting together at any point. im not really her "type" lol. so now i hafta talk to like 50 million people and tell them that me and mary pivec arent messing around, its a different mary than who they all think it is!

ok, im done. i spose i should end this someway, but meh. w/e

      ok, so i just got back from the party with mary, and she's still there. all her cousins are drunk, her ride home = her cousins. everyone there is really drunk and stoned. im really really worried about her. the only reason im not still there is cause billy got bored. i would have stayed until she left and walked home if i had the choice. gahhh. i dont know what to do, but i guess there's nothing i can do. her cell phone is'nt working so i can't call her and i dont know the house number. this is so fucking stupid. why did her aunt make her go to this party. she could have just come over here and stayed with me. my dad's home so her aunt could have even called. but i guess her mom warned her aunt about me caue she thinks we're having sex and she thought mary was pregnant at one point. her mom is really messed up a lot of the time. i just wish i could take her out of that house and give her a real life...

      well, last night billy and i went out to jojo's and picked her and katie up. we came back to my house and a little later kat called and wanted to know if it was ok for her and mary to come over 'till like 5. that was a problem in of itself...but they DID come over. I felt really bad cause i was with mary, jojo was with jon and billy and kat were together. katie was alone. i tried to be with her and talk to her as much as possible...but yea, obviously that was a little difficult. and then her and billy were in my room for the night when kat mary and jon left...that was a bad idea. they didn't do anything, but i could tell katie wanted to. it's so stupid! billy can't do anything cause if he does stuff with other people he feels really bad about it cause of kat. people have the worst timing ever! stupid jojo, gotta introduce me to people when i already have someone...stupid jojo...just kidding! i love jojo, but yea, bad timing!!! oh well, stuff with mary is goin good, so im happy about that...

      ok so today, not too fun. mary came over, but kathy decided to drop jon off with her, and i had pat and apple and bert over. so yea, that didn't happen. and then we had to race to EP cause of some stupid shit. that all ended up with me sitting at EP for 3 hours waiting for kat's partents to get out of a movie. that was seriously like one of the most boring times ever. but mary needed me there, so i guess it was for the better. today was just not a good day. my mom was being all psycho bitch on me, and she wouldn't let me have girls over, so i'm just gunna have em over tomorrow night. it's like, you don't trust me enought to have girls over...? she thinks i'm gunna get someone pregnant. i told her i didn't plan on it... direct quote from her "THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU FATHER SAID!" ok, so sorry that i'm a mistake, but it's not my fault. i'm not gunna mess up and have a kid that neither of us wants. you can get off my back about that. so now that that's all out in the open, i think that's been a lot of the reasons why she restricts me... but oh well, im kinda used to it i guess, or at least i SHOULD be by now. i got a new wallet, i spose that was a good thing to come out of EP. and i got to see Amanda the hott asian today at EP. that was cool, i haven't talked to her or seen her in a while... oh well, there's always next time...

      ok, so i just found out today ANOTHER one of my friends cut for the first time. it's like everything gets soo good, and then bam, it's all down in the shitter again. everything just starts falling apart. on saturday i went paintballing...that was awesome, 'till i got home and realized i didn't have my keys. they fell out of my pocket somewhere in wisconsin. so i get home, and my dad's like "where are your keys" i told him and he freaked out. he started screaming at me, and told pat to go home. then he's like "YOU SAID IT WITH A LITTLE SMILE ON YOUR FACE!!" what a fucking asshole. "yes father, i like losing my keys, i do it just to piss you off and get screamed at". so he yelled at me for about and hour and made me re-key the back lock...MY KEYS ARE IN FUCKING WISCONSIN! oh yea, someone from wisconsin that doesn't know who i am let alone where i live is gunna somehow with the power of my fathers paranoia find our house and rob us...fucking dumbass. so i re-key the lock, that takes like an hour. mary shows up mid way through...and sits while i re-key. she has to leave in 2 hours.....calls kathy, now she has to leave in an hour and a half. we sit and talk about not much for 45 min. that was a complete waste of time. so the whole day was a fuck up. and that night, wow, not a good night. stupid fucking tom went to bloomington at 1:30 for a fucking booty call...for 4 HOURS. i had to be home by like 3, so that got fucked up, thankfully my dad was cool with me stayin there the night. not a good idea...stupid fucking people. and now today i find out one of my friends cut, yea, not a good week already, and it's only been 3 days since saturday. now i hafta go re-do the back lock because my dad didn't tell me that my gpa couldn't get in without a key...go i hate him sometimes...all i wanna do is go in my room and cut the shit out of myself.

      so i made a descicion today. whenever i have a hard time, whenever im feeling like shit...im not gunna let anyone know about it. im just gunna smile my way through the day and when i get home go in my room and lock out the world. i've had enough of the drama and enough of the people that want to fix everything. it's just so fucking annoying. the last thing you want to hear when you're having a bad day is "whats wrong""how can i help""you know you can talk to me right?". it just gets so damn repetative. those statements don't mean anything anymore, they're just something someone says to make it look like they care, and then when you let them off the hook by saying "nothing's wrong" it's like nothing happened, they just go back to their little worlds.          i just looooooove coming home and getting bitched at not 3 minutes within stepping through the door. it's just so much fun! you would think that caring about your kids and making sure they don't screw up too much would be a good thing.......who knew it could make you hate your parents and make you want to just cut everything away. heh, reason number one why the Schmit line dies with me. there's no way I would subject a child to the things that I go through everyday...in fact, the things EVERYONE goes through everyday. it's just cruel to do it... if i ever do have kids, it's gunna be wayyyyyy different than how I was/am being raised, you can bet on that one...... oh well, time to go play with sharp objects in the dark

      so yea, im supposed to be goin paintballing with bobby and his church. but my dad isn't home, so i can't get him to sign a permission slip so i can go. i may just hafta forge it, i really don't wanna, but w/e. pat's over and we'er pretty much waiting till my dad gets home, or 3:30, w/e comes first. so yea, really really wanna drop choir. im fed up with all the girls (cept for like libby and jessie). im so sick of all the stupid shit that goes on. tom's not there, so we're not as good, cause he covers up mistakes that i make and i cover up mistakes he makes. and so of course the girls all look at ME when someone makes a mistake, and are all bitchy. it's just like......gah. i'm sorry Mr. God Singer Tom Stamp isn't here and all you have is me....but suck it the fuck up! all they do is talk...talktalktalktalktalk. and when the guys talk, we get bitched at. Butzen is starting to get pissed at concert choir cause all everyone does is talk. and so she takes it out on the whole choir, when all i do is just sit there and wait to sing. god i hate choir.......i really wanna drop it. if i didn't think the choir would suck without me (men's) i would, and concert choir can deal without me, cause they have the mighty tom........then there's park singers, we won't even get into that......oh well, just another day in the life of hgh school.

      so today was interesting. for about 3 hours in the day my mind was taken off of life. in otherwords: i was happy for a while. i went to the drum and bugle and silent drill team event at the excel for the marines. the silent drill team was sooooo fucking good. omg. almost perfect. timing, looks, sounds faces. gah. such perfection is only seen in one other thing...but yea, so i have a huge headache and im in a bad mood, like always. so i think i may just go to bed...

      ok, so today was so much better than yesterday. i got no sleep last night cause i was up playin ps2. i finally said ok im done, looked up at the clock, it said 5:30, i thought to myself "billy is gunna be here in 2 and a half hours, fuck it" and kept playin. i finally figured out why i keep fallin asleep in church. its not cause im tired, its cause I'M FUCKING BORED. hopefully that wont be like the only time i get to see mary, cause i think i'm just gunna stop goin. something happened with billy and kathy today.........what's new. i seem to be the only person who is thinking sanely, which is strange. i'm the only one who just lets it go and doesn't worry about what is goin on with w/e kathy is thinking. i understand billy, cause hes in love with her. but mary is another story. she's just gotta be all in the whole situation and she just kinda doesn't help, but just kinda orders or prioritizes things.......if that makes sence. i just think im gunna sit and listen to loud music, and discard my sorrows with a little friend of mine.

      i really just wanna go in my room and punch so many holes in my walls. i wasted at least and hour carrying shit for my dad. his matress is now in my room, taking up most of my oh so small room. he wanted his box spring in there too, but i told him we "couldn't get it in the door way". HE'S the one moving NOT ME! he has ME call MY FRIENDS to help him move. If I was moving, I wouldn't call his friends to help me move, i wouldn't have HIM move shit. But nooooooo, you're my kid, so im gunna take advantage of you while you are still living here and use your time for my benifite. oh yea, and i was supposed to go to a party with mary and stay over night............yea well, she called to check in at like 5 and her mom was like "be home at 9". so yea, she went home at 9 and im fucking stuck here with nothing to do but play video games. i really really just want to just punch soooooo many holes in my walls and break everything in my room. if i could i would just go around breaking everything. i just have the amazing urge to go cut, oh man...

      so i just got home from dinner with my mom, the coops, mary and billy. that was fun. i got her to let me stay at my dad's tonight. that was a fucking miracle. im gunna be bored, but at least ill be bored with a computer. so many things are just messing up. my teachers are on crack. my poly sci. teacher marked me absent on the 26th, i fucking talked to him all hour that day. my chem teacher marked that i haven't done a test yet...i did it with 2 other people that missed it last week. i have to appeal for chem cause of the fucking after 10 minutes late its an unexcused absence rule. its first hour! ive been late like 4 times, and i have to appeal. i hate choir, if i could drop it i would, but like 10 people would kill me and not to mention i hold the bass section in one of them. god i wish i could just crawl in a hole... so many times i just want to go in my room and just cutcutcutcutcutcut till there's nothing left to cut. i even started carrying my razors. i didnt even realize i was doing it until i noticed i was rolling them in my fingers at dinner today. its just so hard sometimes to deal with all the shit. and then there's mary. oh my god. she's got so many things going on, and just being near her it just rubs off on me and i feel like shit. the whole car ride home to drop her off, i was just depressed as hell. when we left my house billy asked her what was up, she just said that it was kinda sad, cause her family never goes out to dinner or anything and they dont talk or anything like that. i wanted to just say "trade me families! ill take that!" but the way she said it makes it sound like she really wants to talk to her family and really wants her family to be more like a "family". i spose i cant really relate to that, my whole life i've been glad my mom and dad aren't together cause all they do is scream at eachother. sometimes you just want to push it all away...

I HAD 3 THINGS IN THE BASKET, ALL THE OTHER SHIT WAS HIS. and he was JUST down there, he couldn't have taken the extra 30 seconds out of his oh so busy porn-watching life to put the stuff in the washer. god i hate him sometimes...and he keeps changing when he's moving. first it's the end of the summer, then the middle, then the end of june...now the end of the month. come on, i have a life too! he just takes it for granted that im here and uses me for whatever he can before i'm gone. oh well, like i said before, just another day...

      so today what quite possibly the worst day in a loooooong time. i woke up and it hurt just to open my eyes. getting up out of bed was a whole different matter. my neck hurts so much, i cant move my head without pain, in fact, it hurts even to NOT move. my throat hurts, ive been cold all day. and to top it all off, we had a fucking choir concert tonight. that was hell...men's choir sucked and i guess tom was fuckin up. i just really wanna crawl in a corner and die right now. its wierd. ill be happy and fine one second, and then BAM! just plummet and be depressed as hell. it just brings back memories that are not-so-good ones. oh and people, i hate them all. there are a select few that dont piss me off... ive got the BIGGEST headache ever, and everytime i bend over or move my head, it just starts throbbing. i really really wish everything would just dissapear and i could be happy in all parts of my life for just a second...but thats not a real wish. so i just hafta suck it up. oh well, guess its just gunna be another day tomorrow. cant go to group on wednesday, cant do anything on friday(an early release) because i have a c- in psych...the stupid test. when the fuck am i ever gunna need to know where the frontal lobe and the hyperthalamus and all that stupid shit is!? NEVER! we learn so much usless shit in school, we waste half our day sitting and thinking "only 5 more hours, only 4 more hours..." its sooooo pointless. if the schools required the basics and just the basics, it would be soooo much better. you could take classes if you NEEDED them, not if you HAD to take them. eh, but w/e. guess its just the way life is...

      well, today billy and i went to MOA to get his mom a b-day present. we met mary, carol and kathy there. billy gave me a couple of bucks to go to the arcade while him and kathy went shopping, it was kinda random, but w/e. after that we went to the school for the play, i skated outside for a bit while everyone was inside, then at like 7:30 one of the janitors was like "you're gunna hafta leave with the skateboard cause there's a lot of people here now" it was kinda nice, cause usually they just yell at you to get off the school as soon as they see you. so now i'm at my grandma's cause i really don't wanna see the play again. it was good, but i just saw it last night, and i'm not in a real social mood right now...meh. i'm sure billy will call when the movie get's out, or i'll call him, cause my shit is in his trunk...

      it's amazing what people will say to get out of talking about things...they'll bring up other subjects, give short answers, look away, walk away...just say they're fine. found out that a friend of mine is having a pretty hard time...every time i ask if she's ok, or if she's gunna be ok, she's just like "yeah, i'm better". but i guess she's not. ive got a friend who really REALLY wants to go to prom, but no one asked her. i don't understand how. if i wasn't going with mary, and i thought i had a chance lol, i would ask her in a second. but people pay too much attention on the past and not enough on who the person is NOW. i tried to get her a date, i even found someone who wanted to go with her, but she said she "absolutley could not" because one of her friends was going to ask him and found out he was going to go with a freshman. well, her friend already has a date, his date can't go because of work, i don't understand why she couldn't just talk to her friend and be like "he's not going with the freshman, and seeing as you already have a date, i wanted to know if it was ok with you that i went with him" it's seriously not that hard. and if it's gunna make you happy, your friend shouldn't be pissed and say no, she should say "yea, go with him, be happy atleast for one night"...gah i hate people, they just never think about people around them.

      MY INTERNET WORKS!!!! i can get on aim...in fact i'm on right now...and i can get on yahoo, and i can get on WINmX and i can get on the internet! i'm in a really good mood right now. this choir from montana sang for our choir today. there was this one girl that i noticed RIGHT away. she was like, shorter, looked slightly asian, dark hair...really really cute. i was watching her sing and she looked right at me, we locked eyes for about 30 second before she turned away...i love across the room flirting :) when they were leaving i went to put something on the piano and had to walk through a crowd of these people. when i turned around to head back to where i was standing, SHE was right infront of me, we were literally 6 inches apart, face to face. she had the most beautiful eyes! gah! like a moron i just let her walk bye, i didn't say hi or anything, i just watched her go. this guy that all the girls like...fell over for when they heard him in his solo walked up to me and was like "cute girls huh?" my only response was "huh, yeah". it's really sad when a choir from montana has more hot girls in it than your ENTIRE school...lol. oh well, maybe ill try and find her when i go on my road trip this summer and say hi. but anyways...i can do stuff this weekend i think, which means i'll hopefully be getting together with mary...it's been a while since we got to hang out :'( hopefully billy didn't change his mind about goin to see katie tomorrow...i gotta call him...i should prolly do that now before he goes to work! later!

      well, i haven't posted in a while. my computer is set-up, the internet is working on all the computers......EXCEPT MINE. still don't know what's up with it. i don't wanna ask my dad to help cause he's just gunna get mad at me and yell at me for not knowing as much as he does about computers. so i think i'll just use my g-pa's computer to check my mail and update my blog and just not get on aim or anything anymore. it kinda sucks, 'cause i haven't talked to a lot of my online friends in a while, and i'm sure they're wondering where the hell i am. well, school is going great...NOT! all of my classes are pretty good, 'cept for chem. and that's 'cause of the stupid attendance rule at school, which is solveable by community service, oh that'll be fun, then there's political science, i've got a D+ 'cause i missed something that the teacher won't let me make up. that should get up to a C by the end of the month hopefully, that way i can have a life again. then into psychology, the worst class i've had in highschool. i have a teacher who's never tought it before, first year. she doesn't know what she's doing (she said so herself today in a fit of rage at the class). we hafta do this really big project(case study) where we study a kid under 13...i don't know anyone under that age, so that was problem number one. problem number two, she doesn't tell me shit. i handed in the first part, she gave it back and failed to mention that she thought it wasn't good enough and i had to redo it, so my dad gets this call at the end of the week saying i didn't do my work and i'm failing...nowhere on the thing i handed in does it say "redo" or "not good enough" or anything to hint at i should do it over. so i talked to her today to find out what the deal was and she was like "you didn't put the 2 questions per subject in"...i explained to her that i didn't have my questions picked and i would add them when i figured them out...she said that was fine...i guess she changed her mind...again. so now my dad is pissed at me 'cause i'm "not doing all i can to make sure i graduate" and he's all afraid that i'm not gunna graduate. he says he'll back off, but he won't...he never does. so now i hafta deal with an incompetant teahcer, and overbearing father, and my mom is coming back into town tomorrow...FUN! mary wants to get together at carol's boyfriends on saturday...he's got the house to himself, 'rents are out of town or something. but now i don't think i can go 'cause if my teacher doesn't like what i've got to show her i hafta redo it all and talk to her about what the fuck i'm doing wrong. well...i guess i should go...i need to call katie and tell her that i 'prolly won't be coming out to say happy b-day on saturday and hang out...

      so i've been hearing quite a bit about soooo many people. apple and i had a pretty good talk at perkins last night. we talked for about an hour while we drank coffee and flirted with the waitress.lol. we talked about pretty much everything...or rather everyone. i won't be living at dad's house anymore, i'll be at my mom's and my grandma's. hopefully my grandpa will be getting a cable or dsl connection...possibly even satellite. then i'll be able to be online again, but until then i won't be on aim or anything for a little while. i'm gunna be so bored...dad's moving on may 10. my moods have just been going down-hill the last couple weeks, i don't know why, they just have. things are going oh so well. i've got a D- in chemistry because of the stupid fucking attendance rule, and a D+ in political science for the same reason. hopefully i can get those absences exucsed, or i won't be able to do anything for the rest of...oh...say...EVER. if i don't get my grades to C's by the end of school, i can't go to idaho or on the trip with the coperines. if she doesn't let me do those, i swear i won't be held accountable for my actions. i guess i told ally munchler that apple had a bunch of flings over spring break...so i don't know what's gunna happen with that, weather apple is mad at me or w/e. i'm really tempted to just move to arizona with my dad when he goes back after my graduation. i just want to get away from everything up here. i'm pretty sure that i can get ahold of a recruiter down there and get to california if i don't come back by january. today i cut my finger pretty deep, it was a bonehead move, but it still hurts. i cut it down to the bone, it was a stab and not a slice, so thats good. i have a feeling my knuckle is gunna hurt really bad tomorrow, but meh, that's what you get for playing with knives. oh well, i guess it's time to go to bed, i've got school tomorrow and a psychology project to bullshit my way through...

      so yea...i just got home from applebee's and my gma was waiting for me. my mom and dad called her thinking i was home at 10, and i wasn't. so now she might be checking up on me tomorrow morning...and jon has nowhere to stay, cause he was gunna stay here tonight...why do things always seem to happen at the worst times. my parents go out of town, im out an hour late and they decide to call and say "hi". jessica was gunna come over and hang out, now thats prolly not gunna happen cause my gma might be checkin up tomorrow morning...i don't know when. today just has not been a very good day. i guess mary and i are "together" now...she want's to make it "official"...gahhhh!!!!!!

      so today i guess i'm playing football with jon, apple, pat, mary and hanna...should be interesting. i really wish kathy was playing...i could cream her then. i really just wanna not let her over here anymore...last night my dad got pissed off that i was getting "pissy". gee, generally when people make fun of you, you retort, well i guess thats against the rules in my dads eyes. cause he kept sayin stuff and kathy would make a joke, then i'd make a joke back and he'd be like "wow, ur pissy today" it's like everytime kathy is around, she just fucks stuff up. her and billy are starting to do stuff a lot now...i know she's gunna hurt him, she'll do something, go back to tom, tell him she needs "space", w/e. she does it all the time, she did it before, she'll do it again. i swear if she does it though, i never wanna se her again. i love billy, but he just has his head up his ass right now with the whole kathy thing, you would think he learned from before...and the time after that...and the time after that.............. gah, i really just wish that everyone would pick one person, stick with them and not go for anyone else. things would be so much easier...relationships just fuck stuff up...

      well, so far so good. i'm on my way to graduating, i've got my cap and gown, just got my yearbook, passing all my classes...now all i need is to get the stupid grad standards and im good. the senior "wisdom retreat" was on thursday...it was ok. at the end there was a time to say sorry and stuff to people you have been mean to, or thanks or w/e. i got up and was just like "don't let anyone tell you you're not good enough, you're too skinny, too fat, too white, too black etc. tomorrow, yesterday, today, last year, it doesn't mean anything, if you doubt yourself..." then alec talked, that was so fucking funny. he was like, "i'm gunna make a lot of new friends...in North Dakota...cows, chickens, etc. but i'll prolly forget all of you, i'll try to remember as much as i can, but it won't be much." it gave it a little bit of humor, it was nice. lots of people thought he was kidding, but he wasn't :p i'm glad i'll finally be out of school, can't wait for boot camp, i'm really excited, it's gunna be really really hard, and i llke that...

      well, last night was prom. i actually had a lot of fun, which was cool. the place we had it was really nice, thank god. if it would have been like last year, i would have thrown a fit. my tux was really cool and i got comments all night lol. mary was cool with me dancing with a couple friends, that was nice. i got to dance with libby! it was really nice, cause i didnt get to at sadies. otherwise i danced with mary the whole night...cept when she got pictures with josh, so it was a good night. after we went back to her house and watched gladiator, that was a good movie. i got home at like 4 lol. i wanted to go to a party after and have a little fun with friends. one of them had gotten a hotel room across the street, or something, and he was havin a party, i really wanted to go, cause a few other friends were going. BUT...my mom was like "you should be with mary after", this comment made me very confused, because as far as i knew she couldn't do anything. little to my knowlege they had already asked kathy's parents if i could come over for a movie after the dance, so i went with mary instead. i figured "hey, i can party any time"...lol, except ill never have an after senior prom party... CRAP! lol. maybe next year if a friend of mine doesnt get asked (again) ill go with her, all decked out in my marines dress blues. that would be really cool. anyways, we'll see, what happens happens...

      why are people so fucking stupid. no one ever listens. it's like "i know what i'm talking about and no one else is right and no one can tell me differently". some people just need to learn to shut their mouths, listen to other people, and look at things from a point of veiw that doesn't place them in the center of the FUCKING UNIVERSE...im going to sit here and listen to loud music, maybe i'll get out of this shitty mood, maybe not...

      well, i guess things aren't as well off as i thought they were...although things rarely are. a couple friends are having problems with cutting, one of my friends thinks she wants to die, things with mary could be better...there are just so many things that should not be happening. i guess i have to chock it all up to "thats life" huh? well, prom is tomorrow night...oh joy. it should be...interesting...to say the least. i got all my shit except for the flowers, we're picking those up at like 12 or something...idk. i really wanted to get drunk tonight, but i got home at like 11 and i dont think my grandma would want me leaving this late...oh well, i hope i can get ahold of Libby after the dance tomorrow, cause then we might go to a party. i really want to, i guess she's really wild and fun at night (like more than during the day lol) so we'll see how it goes...

      oh great, now mary thinks everything is her fault and she can't do anything right and she's just screwing everything up. is it so hard to understand that i just had a bad day? i love her, and she knows that. but sometimes! lol. well, hopefully she doesn't think that for very long and she realizes it's not all her fault and she hasn't done EVERYTHING wrong (we're human, everyone gets a few). oh well, i'll let her know when i see her just in case. just give her a big kiss and tell her "i love you, don't worry, it's not your fault"...that sounds good.

      well, i just got home. it's 12:12. i started walking at like 11:10. was at carol's for a while, then we went to applebee's...what a genious idea! it's 10, the girls hafta be home at 12, 15 minute car ride one way...that leaves all of about an hour and a half MAXIMUM...plus pat had to try to find his wallet...so that was the biggest mistake of the night. i should have followed what i was gunna do and just tell pat to drop me off at home before we got to bee's. so we're at bee's, lot's o people, and after a while mary gives me a hug goodbye and walks out with carol, so i walk out, gunna walk home. then mary runs up and is like "wuts wrong?". i told her nothing and kept walking, then she tried to pull my into a corner and kiss me or w/e, but i just kept walking. she got all confused and was like "why not?" i said "cause i can say no", she said "ok" gave me a hug, turned around and walked back to carol and aj, i walked home. this was the most boring, messed up night i've had in a loooong time. one plus, i got to see david sprain and dusty, i haven't seen dusty in a long time. oh well, i'm just gunna go back to listening to really loud music with headphones...

Kalin said she would have liked to get together when i got back and go out to perkins at night or something...but she's not online so that's a bust. i just got back from phil's house, that was fun cause he's got a really nice house. it would have been cool to stay there, but pat needed to get home for work tomorrow and i would have needed to find a ride home in the morning and that wouldn't have been fun, so yea, i'm home. and bored...gah i hate being bored...maybe i'll call apple and go to perkins, or just go by myself...

      sweet! i'm home, and not a care in the world right now. my entire schedule from here till january consists of two things: dinner tonight with a friend, road trip with the coops. i was hoping to get together with a friend of mine over summer, but she's somewhere in maple grove for the summer...so that's a bust. hopefully i'll get out and party a lot, call up libby to FINALLY get in our partying time. i guess sarah phim. was a little upset about me not getting ahold of her lately, or so says amy, so i called her up and we hung out at the park for a couple hours, it's nice to be around her. her sister and i were close and i've known her since before she could walk, so it's kinda a reality check to be with her. well, i gotta call mary and figure out if she likes steak or not...

      well, it's been quite a long time since i last posted in here. right now i'm in idaho with my uncle and aunt. everything was going pretty good...keyword here being WAS. i've been thinking about the whole me and mary thing, and after a couple weeks of pondering and weighing, i broke it off. i don't know for how long, right now it's for good, but i don't know. as of right now, i'm single, but i intend on staying that way. this wasn't a "i want to date other people" or w/e, i plan on not getting in any more relationships for a very long time. but i pretty much just found that i had changed, i don't know if it's for the better or not, but i don't really care, who i am is who i am, and everyone who doubts me or w/e can eat themselves. sorry, that was my little screw everyone bit. i'd love to say that i was in a good mood and everything is better, but it's not true. i should be feeling better after talking to mary and explaining the situation to her, because if it would have gone on longer it would have just been worse on her, but i don't. i feel like the biggest asshole ever and i don't know why...oh wait, maybe it's cause i have a little thing called a concience...damn thing won't let me go. it's always seemed to keep the asshole in me kind of at bay most of the time, but it just wouldn't let me keep goin with something that would hurt someone i care about...which sucks, cause i know it hurt her, a lot. we were in the middle of talking about it and i hear "you have one minute left", oh great, phone card is out, so we had to cut it short. but oh well, that's how life goes right...right? please god someone tell me that's how life goes and i'm just not repeatedly hurting people around me for no reason...

      well, graduation is tomorrow. it's been the best day i've had in a long time. everything is going good, only a couple other things could make this day better. allie was being a little bit closer than usual, and kelly walked up behind me while i was talking to mike abbot and wraped her arms around me and wouldn't let go. it was kinda cool, i don't get that many hugs from her. mike is thinking about the Marines again, tony might join. everything is just going right. it's a nice change

      so on friday i was walking to 4th hour and i saw Mary in the hall. i stopped to say and she gave me a hug, that was a little odd, but meh. i'm mad that i didn't get to go to her dance things, either night. it kinda pissed me off, but i figure she'll have more, so i'll just make up for it and go to those. mary's mom wanted to go out to dinner, but i don't know what happened to that, i guess we're not... i'm gunna call her and talk to her and see if she want's to go out to dinner sometime. oh well, everything is pretty much the same, not much has changed. as far as i know, i'm graduating, so it's all good. no more school. then the Marines. i'm waiting for that, i'm so excited. ok, well i'm gunna go...

      ummmmm, yea. so just got back from hanging out with libby. we went to see i-robot at southdale, that was fun. it was a good movie the first time, and a good movie the second time..."looks like will did some working out..." best comment of the night, and only libby and i will know why it's funny! :p so on the way out of the theatre, she gets a call from her mom, i guess it was about the moon cause it was really yellow, but i didn't know this. and we're walking through the parking lot, and i see the moon and i'm like "libby look!" and i grabbed her and turned her, she just stood there, it was kinda...well...cute, but then i found out here mom was saying the same thing, kinda funny...neways. the moon gave me an idea, i used to sit on the roof of the garage at my mom's and watch the stars, so i said "lets go to my mom's". before we went to my mom's we went to this bridge where you can see downtown, it was pretty cool. we were there for about 5-10 minutes, then we went to my mom's, after about what seemed like a half hour, but was actually like an hour and a half, we left...all in all, a good night. one of the best i've had in a while, thanks libby. otherwise, i bought the blue collar comedy tour movie, shinedown's cd, static-x - beneath beyond between, and john mayer's double thingy...i spent too much money, oh well...at least libby and i have something to listen to in the car...

      eh, today was pretty boring. i was hoping to get ahold of libby and see what she was doing later, but she didn't call back, or check her phone, or w/e. it sucks because i have nothing to do all day, no one to hang out with most of the time. i guess that's why i've been seing soo many movies lately, i've seen almost everything out...hopefully libby will be available tomorrow, or tim, or someone...

      well. libby just left. we went to a movie, the notebook. she cried, it was a good movie. then we came back to my house and sat outside for a good 3 1/2 hours playing the question game...god i thought it was hard when i only had a class with her! sitting there right next to her for so long talking about sex, life, growing up...it was hard to not just lean over...i don't know if i'm getting the right signals or not. it seemed that when we got to questions that had to do with hints for guys to kiss her, or wether she liked making the first move or not, she got really, giggly and would try to avoid it or w/e. i really hope i'm getting this right. we drained her car battery sitting listening to music the whole time, so she came in while we waited for a truck to come and juice her car. we were in my room, she was just laying on my bed, so i decided to have her sit up and give her a back rub, the first time i had her sit up, she just scooched back and laid on my lap, it was hard to not just leave her there and play with her hair or something. gah, i wanted to just lay in my bed the rest of the night and fall asleep with her, that would have been...crazy. heh, plus, my grandma woulda FLIPPED. grrr, why do i hafta be here, why can't i be at my dad's, why did he hafta move. i could have girls over w/e i wanted, even overnight. i miss that house...i miss him...oh well. we're gunna go see another movie again sometime, soon i hope, we'll see...maybe i'll take her to lake victoria

      well, i'm home from a movie: The Terminal. It was actually really good. First thing i do, pop on the headphones...song you ask? A Perfect Circle - Judith. It seems to be my anthem right now...It's kinda sad. I get home, and already i'm in a bad mood. i don't know why people hang around me, i'm kind of an ass...just kinda...it's sad what you start to think late at night when no one is up and you've got nothing to distract you. You start to think of what your life all sums up to be, what you've done, who you've touched...who you've hurt. Every little nuance of your life, good memories, bad memories. Everything just gets pieced all together. Then you look at where your life is going, what you're doing with your life, who's entering...who's leaving. If it all comes up as positive, or even if&nbsp;you just break even, it's worth it. But if it doesn't, if it all gets summed up to failure, loss, pain and strife...heh, what a word...what do you do...?

      so today, yea, what a waste. woke up at 2:30. that was gay. went to jessica's to watch movies at 4:30, little did i know she was hanging out with mary at 5/5:30. i would have rather been sitting in a catholic church for 2 hours. finally i called mike and had him just come and get me, we went to aj's and shot off fireworks for a bit. amanda came to aj's and we all went to perkins. i saw charlie mcgrew there, that was kinda cool. he was with doug and a couple pretty cute lookin girls, there were actually a bunch of cute girls there, it was kinda wierd. after that we went to jeff's house and watched a movie. i gave amanda a back rub cause her back hurt, she wanted to give me one cause she felt bad about me just giving her one, but i wouldn't let her...too paranoid about my back, so she gave mike one for a few minutes. now i'm at home, it's 7:15 and i'm waiting for people to wake up so i can get un-bored...someone please come online!!!!

      well, it's 3 am, i'm sitting here listening to dashboard confessionals and john mayer...and i realize that i miss having someone to curl up with. that's all i really need, i just want a friend that i can call up and just be with for a little while. i have one...but she's not in town for the summer, which bites. i also realized that all the girls i ever find, can never be just a smidgen closer than friends, like just curling up and laying together during a movie or w/e. everyone has to be all close and personal, everything just gets blown up out of wack. sometimes i really wanna call up libby, but i never know what might happen, and i don't wanna do anything and get stuck in something i don't want to be in. why do girls hafta be so damn frusterating?! just learn to chill out and live in the moment...

      eh, just got home a little bit ago from playing pool with tim and jeoff. there's nothing to freaking do! nobody's online, there's nowhere to go. i'm tempted to go up to the depot and see who's playing, but it's all just 14 year old hopkins kids, and that just gets annoying...soooo once again, off to my room to listen to music and read. ooo ooo, i just got a new portable DVD player :p dad gave it to me for my b-day. when we were down in AZ i brought it to him in the hospitol and he said "you can prolly expect this when it gets a little closer to your birthday" so grandpa just got home from taking care of him, and it's sitting on my bed...shweet. now maybe i can watch some movies with a friend *wink wink* and not hafta be upstairs...

      ok, so i'm laying in bed, looking up at the ceiling fan, and i remembered back to when i was in idaho. i was staying in my cousins room, and her light was one that you turned the knob on the wall to make it brighter or darker. and i would turn it almost all the way down, so there was  just enough light to see, barely, and i would crawl onto her futon (it was one of the wood ones with the really soft pad) and just imagine brining a girl home to it. it would have been my ideal room...but as i'm laying in bed remembering this, it hits me...i'm not going to be able to do that anymore. once i get out of boot camp, nothing is going to be the same. i'm going to be a different person, i'm going to be more grown up, and things like that just don't really happen  when you get older, you don't think of those things...hell, most of my friends don't think of those things NOW. so i kinda got just this wierd feeling, like, i'm going to be missing out on something. i never got to bring a girl home and spend a whole day with her, have her stay over, and wake up with her...that was one of the things i always wanted to do. and i realized, libby is like, my last chance at that, and it's not gunna happen the way things are goind. she's leaving on the 28th for college, prolly never gunna see her again. i'm gunna have the house to myself on saturday, saturday night, and sunday because my grandparents are going to a family reunion, and i can't even get ahold of/hang out with libby. she's the only girl i've found that hasn't gotten majorly attatched right away, and that's nice. but it's just grating on my nerves that i have like, 4 months of freedom left, then 5 years of regulations and work, and that's only if i don't stay in for 10 and retire...which i'm majorly considering if i like Recon. i spose it's just kinda hit me how much i've missed out on. didn't get to have an after-senior prom party, didn't get to have an after-graduation party, never really spent the night with a girl i cared about, parents was never able to get a job, was never able to get my license. shit, i haven't really done anything worthwhile since...well...ever. i don't know where this all came from, i guess it's just late night thinking and this is, well, my journal, so it came out here. hmmm, i think i need to do some serious planning...

      well, just got home a little bit ago from a movie. went and saw Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless mind. it was pretty good. i like jim carrey. other than that, yet again another boring day. went to the rec to skate for a couple hours, helped mom move more shit *shakes fist* got home from that, libby was online, tried talking to her, but she wouldn't respond, a little confused but oh well, so i just biked up to the hopkins theatre and saw a movie. $2, figured "eh, what can i have to lose". eh, tomorrow's pt, tim has the beast running, so we're prolly takin that. we got a couple new recruiters up at the office...kinda wierd. lot's of stuff has changed. the running is different, there's this new poolie that kinda changed how we do stuff, just the crunches, but it's like, we had a system, why change it, it was a good system... oh well, nobody online, guess i'll just go up and listen to music for a while...

      so today was kinda fun. listened to music and read 'till like 5:30. then went to P.T. then after that, went to hooters with tim pat and phil. it was a good night at hooters, lots of good lookin girls :p the only thing that could have made this night better: libby waiting for me when i got home. it would have been kinda nice to see her after this oh-so-long day. oh well, there's always tomorrow :D my body is worn out. pt today, skating yesterday...and then i'm gunna skate again tomorrow, gah, i'm gunna kill my body before i even get to bc. heh, time to take a shower and get in bed...

      ok, so i'm sitting here playing solitare, it's like my crack, it really is, and for some reason i start thinking about mary and stuff. and i realized why i don't like talking to her. yesterday she im's me with this "im happy that you're happy, libby's a cute girl...blahblahblah" shit, and because i'm not all "yay! im so happy mary! this is awesome!" for some reason i guess i'm "hard to talk to". so there's reason #1, she just reads too much into stuff and assumes too much. reason #2, i realized i got tired of always hearing "this person thinks you're an asshole 'cause she heard THIS from mary...or THIS person thinks you're an asshole 'cause she heard THIS from mary..." all the time. everytime i'd talk to someone and mary would come up, all i would hear was "you did this and you did that and you said this and you said that" it's just like...shut the fuck up. the only people i didn't hear about it from were people who didn't even know mary or didn't know about the situation. i'd hear from the coops and aj that someone, somewhere, was mad at me for doing SOMETHING to mary...yea...ok...that makes sense. heh, at least aj gives me something to laugh about though, somehow we always find someway of laughing at things...maybe it's cause he's my advisor :p
