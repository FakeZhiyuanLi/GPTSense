       Well here we all are! The team that will eventually produce the best RPG game ever to hit the 21st Century. OK so I may be a little over the top but that's who we are! (Well me at least!)  So anyway, whats Sophies Quest? Sophies Quest is an RPG which is being produced by a small team from around the world; although most of us are based here, in merry old England! We have programmers (like me :) graphic designers and graphic co-ordinators (like pals Lewis and Hazel AKA "Fraz"), music composers (hello Tom :) and Quality Assurance personnel, media management and so on. But thats not what you want to see is it? No..not at all  This blog is for the team to post up what they like, when they like; how they like. Over the course of the project, you'll see source code, ideas, plans, debates from the team and sneak previews. But you'll also get totally unrelated news, such as the story on how I went out and got drunk, forgetting I had to attend a team meeting later that night......  But anyway, enough of me rabbiting on! Have fun, bookmark this blog (shakes fist "bookmark it!!") and if you want to ask questions,feel free to leave comments  l8rs! Seano

       Hello everyone, and welcome to the Sophies Quest Team Blog. My name is Lewis, and i am one of the graphic designers for Sophies Quest. (but i also contribute to the game design) i'll be looking forward to when we come to start on Sophies quest along side another game death 8, but in the meantime, im working on another brilliant game called Conquer.  one thing i enjoy most about the SQ project is coming up with the island designs, and im especially looking forward to designing areas in more detail. i have loads of brilliant ideas.  I just love designing those small nucks and crannies in areas, which make the game explorations more fun, as I hate it when things get too repetitive. to get around this im gonna try and get the different areas to have their own personalities. and own aspects about them.  when your walking through a forest, it wont look like your walking past that same tree over and over just by having cleverly thought layouts and unique features.  I certainly have high hopes for this game, and am sure its going to be a brilliant experience. we have a good team, and am sure when things get rolling , they will carry on.  lets just hope seans ten million other projecs wont get i his way.
