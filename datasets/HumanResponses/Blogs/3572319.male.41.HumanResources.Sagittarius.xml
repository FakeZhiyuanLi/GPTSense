      Ok so here is my post, again..I am a little new to this Blog thing but I am getting the hang of it....(Thanks Erin) Hey All! I think that I am the first person to respond to this weeks question. To all of you that might not know my, this is Ticia. I am an alumni from '98.' I couldn't make the weekend this year due to some personal matters (i know Matt my coolness factor has decreased) however I plan on being super involved from now on to make next years weekend rock as much and more than this years. I think that there are two possible ways to answer this question. This first thing to realize is do you mean the students that just completed the weekend, or do you mean involving more students to actually participate in next years weekend. If what you mean is to keep the students that just attened the weekend involved, the key is a well run and organized Alumni Program. This I can attest to from experience. I loved the alumni program when I completed my weekend, I used to commute 45 mins just to attend an alumni meeting. The alumni program I feel is the key to keeping the newbies involved. If what you are talking about is getting more students to participate in the actuall weekend I think that comes down to education and to publicitiy. I believe the education aspect of it is another way to keep the recent attendees involved as well. We should think about recruiting them to speak to the sophomores next year about what MASSStar is and maybe why they should want to get involved. Educating the schools even more than I am sure we have about MASSStar as well. I am sorry this is so long and these are just some basic ideas that I am sure can be developed into some great programs, with everybody's input and creativity. I look forward to working closely with all of you.

      Hey everyone, sorry I didn't respond to the first one, but here goes:       One way to make MassSTAR more recognizable is to talk about MassSTAR whenever and wherever you can.  We need to let more people know about how amazing this experience is... for everyone, not just us.  I love MassSTAR.  This year's conference was such a new and different experience for me.  I had never been a part of a group that had truly cared so much for one another.  All of the returning staffers made us New Kids feel right at home, from the minute we stepped into our hall.  That was so nice.  A part of making MassSTAR better is to show that warmth and kindness to anyone who is interested in MassSTAR.  Show them just how amazing you guys truly are.  If they see how great this is, they are definitely going to want to join in the fun!  Thanks guys! You all made waves and waves of difference in my life.

      Ok guys -- here's the next question!   Look for a new one every week or so... and you can always add responses to older questions as we move forward.  "How can we get more students involved in MassSTAR in 2005 and in the future?"

      sorry it has taken me so long to post this up here!    i have to say my best memory was the dj incident. it was funny, cool, and touching all in one.  it ended in celebration and riding the pony - that's the funny. melissa's conversation was also hilarious (not only was she talking faster than emily ann ever talks, but she was pacing and jumping around and telling the person that every sophomore in MA was there). it was cool cuz we all really got to work together very closely on one thing.  most of the weekend was spent with ops doing their thing and then the facilitators and sp's being separated with their clusters.  this brought us all together cuz we had ops and helpers running around like crazy.  we kept in close contact with the facilitators and sp's who tried to stall the delegates a bit in order to give ops a bit more time to set up and find a dj (thanks melissa kaye for selflessness and ability to ask anything necessary to anyone for the benefit of MassSTAR).  and it was touching in a not-quite-so-sentimental-way.  it touched me, though.  nobody hesitated. we all just kind of jumped into things and everyone filled in a different role until everyone was doing something and everything possible was being done.    i would just like to add that cheers online are always a good thing. just let kayla know how my PMA was. i encourage you all to try it:)

      So I get thoughts/quotes of the day posted on one of my home screens.  This one came up today:    Life is an opportunity, benefit from it. Life is a beauty, admire it. Life is a dream, realize it. Life is a challenge, meet it. Life is a duty, complete it. Life is a game, play it. Life is a promise, fulfill it. Life is sorrow, overcome it. Life is a song, sing it. Life is a struggle, accept it. Life is a tragedy, confront it. Life is an adventure, dare it. Life is luck, make it. Life is life, fight for it! - Mother Teresa  I think that massSTAR is truly life! Thanks again EVERYONE!  Oh, and I have pictures - I ordered the cd with it, so if anyone wants pictures emailed, let me know (I have a picture from ALMOST every cluster I think).   Kristen  OK - More to add.  I just sent an email to my delegates to see how their week has gone, this is what I got back from a delegates mom - I took out her name.  Hi Kristen, This is ** Mom, Deb responding. I must say what a great weekend it was and my daughter didn't stop talking about the ice cream cone exercise, rental negotiations, egg drop fumble and how great her weekend was for hours and hours. I thank you so much for all your support and "E" word! I must also share that I am so relieved that the expected 'let-down' back in the HS halls was addressed to both parents and delegates. She was so bummed by the lack of any "e" word or any interest in what had been a life changing weekend for her. I hope MASSstar has a reunion soon to re-charge the battery after the glum return to ordinary high school. I just wanted to share my parental perspective for what it is worth and thank you for being in touch. I'm she sure will email you her 'private' email address, as this message came to the family community email. She has been swamped with wrapping up final papers, art work and fitting in her new lifeguarding job and bummed she has not got to see Harry Potter YET! Today was her last day of school, off tomorrow for Pres Reagan and finals next week. Thank you again for inspiring our daughter to do small things with great enthusiasm, even when those around us don't share the passion. Keep up the energy, I know these kids CAN move mountains. Rock on. Deb

      Well, first of all, I must say a big THANK YOU! to all of MassSTAR for my citizenship certificate. It is framed on my big yellow wall at home. It was the most amazing thing for me to be honored by those very same people who taught me how to care and how to serve others. I wouldn't nearly be me if it wasn't for you.  Now to the question: I think that my favorite part of the conference echoes what a lot of the others said about teamwork. During the North-East-South-West activity, the second time, there was only one girl in the west category. Without me even having to say anything, I looked over and there were four yellow shirts (belonging to people who had never even heard of the game) over there saying things like "Oh, you're a west too?" and "I love spreadsheets!" Needless to say, I highly doubt that Ann and Hannah and Kelly and Stinger are all full "west" personalities, but they jumped in when someone was in need of a lil' help and support. And then during debrief, I was having a little trouble getting them to talk, and Elliot and Alex both made a comment that sparked a lot of conversation from the delegates, and then in the other session, Mary asked a question that got them talking too. I was so psyched. Most people can tell you that I usually do not lack all that much confidence in my abilities, but something about the most amazing 115 students you have met in a long time gets you a lil' intimidated. I was a little nervous. But after such a thought, I immediately knew that I had thirty plus other people chillin' in yellow shirts that were not, under any circumstances, going to let me fail at this. What an INCREDIBLE feeling. I always knew you guys were there for me in whatever endeavor I persued, but to have the concrete thought actually run through your head and calm you down, all I can say is "Wow." And that doesn't just happen anywhere...    Side note: It was about 4:30 or so on Sunday afternoon, that I looked over at the three of my boys who had spent most of the ice cream game in jail, and knew that they got it. It was quite a rewarding feeling. Special shout out to Anca and Maura who never gave up on them.

       . . . was the 100% total support everyone had for everyone else.  Whether we were new to the crew, repeat volis assuming new roles or MassSTAR veterans tried-and-true, everyone had everyone else's back.  After a crazy year at a ridiculously competitive school, and my current stint at a restaurant where people have literally shoved people to get to wait on a table 'cuz money is THAT scarce . . . it's been a while since I felt like this much of a team player.  Much like the delegates tend to assimilate the personalities of their facilitator and their SP(s), I think there's some truth in their assimilating our brand of team work.  The Surfers were the most 'chill' group of delegates I've ever gotten to work with in my time as a volunteer with this organization.  No one wished to show one another up, and everyone supported each other . . . just like the staff.  Even in the large group setting, with the Mussle-HP alliance or the effective group dynamics during the social, Ice Cream Game and Real Estate Game . . . incredible.    So, the cohesion this weekend blew me away.  THANK YOU SO MUCH!  --Andrew

      Hey everyone!  Last weekend was full of moving moments for me, thanks to all of you.  If I had to choose the single most inspirational feature, however, I'd have to say that it is the fact that every single one of my delegates was completely engaged and enthralled throughout the seminar.  Never have I been so impressed with a group of sophomores, never have I before had so many positive things to say, never before have I had a group in which no strategizing was necessary to bring about cohesion.  Every member of the Sea Turtles contributed and listened in processing sessions, workshops, panels, and other activities.  They all internalized the messages of the conference.    Also, as always, I loved the ice cream game and the social.  I'm especially happy that Mark the DJ mixed it up a bit and played some AC/DC.  There's something about guitars, drums, and little Australian and Scottish men that brings out CRAZYAUBREY.

      ok - so I have a couple favorite parts of the weekend.  First, I am so pleased how well the whole thing flowed.  I can't say enough about EVERY delegate.  I truly think that this was the best group of delegates I have worked with and watched.  Second,  I have to give props to Ann, who tried to do the yodel cheer with me, we hadn't practiced it AT ALL (as if that wasn't obvious), but she gladly helped me out when I didn't want to go it alone.  THEN of course it was the ops!  I know everyone was very stressed out all weekend, but you NEVER let on, not ONE of my delegates ever noticed that the dj didn't start right away, they never realized if something didn't go as planned.  In fact I could rarely tell if something didn't go like it was supposed to.  The ONLY way I really found out the background to the dj story was by asking Maureen how she was doing.  She sort of let on about the dj cancelling and we weren't sure if we were actually going to HAVE a real dj.  Then Mark showed.  So I HAD to get the whole story from Melissa Kaye.  You don't know how amazed I am by all of you!  We set the bar HIGH and I have to say EVERYONE went beyond what was set.  Most of my group is SO Psyched about the Summit, and getting to hang out again!  They actually don't want to bring friends (they know they will though), they just want the Dolphins to be together again.     Ok going on THE ABSOLUTE COOLEST THING actually happened on Monday when I was driving back (I stayed with my college roommate on Sunday).  Anyway, I was listening to the radio - I have NO IDEA which station, but I heard "A Perfect World" by the Indigo Girls from ALL THAT WE LET IN - Released Feb 2004.  I didn't get to hear the whole song - I lost the station but I copied the part of the lyrics that I heard that followed the weekend theme:   We get to be a ripple in the water We get to be a rock that’s thrown We get to be a boy on the bridge Standing over the reservoir Thank you all for creating positive ripples in my life.  Later   Kristen Dalen

      Okey my MUSSLE counter part beat me to responding to this email so here we go! Not to sound cheesy or anything but my most memorable moment of the weekend was the whole time the constant flow of energy, postiveness, excitement, passion you name it.  From friday morning on I could not believe that I could be part of such an amazing journey.  So the most memorable part of the weekend: Driving into the parking lot with Brittany(the Hawaiian Punch cheerleader) she goes "yo Mr.S put the windows up turn on some good music or I'm leaving, how could you take me here" I told her that if she still hated it by 5:00 that I would respect her wishes and take her home she said fine, but I'm gonna be GANGSTER. " By Five she was telling the group that she never wanted to leave massSTAR. ...I saw her go from tough city kid to amazing leader( i knew it was there) in the course of a weekend..By the way on the way home she gave the conference a 10. Everywhere we go people want to know who we are..so we tell them we are the PUNCHES...Mighty Hawaiian Punches I thank you all for giving her the weekend of a life time~Matt

      Here is Christine's email transferred to a blog (can someone reach out to christine so she knows how to "blog?"  here's a little 2004 massstar fyi (i'm a little too impatient to wait for  this blog thing; and frankly, i don't even know what a blog is!):  i went shopping 2 days before the conference to make sure my happy-fun bag  was packed chock-full of those toys that keep your hands entertained when  your mind's a little sleepy.  i'm always a little worried they'll distract  more than they'll help the kids focus, but i sure do love shopping for  those things!  well, point is - that bag wasn't opened once during the  weekend.  those kids were learning, focused, and respectful all  weekend.  outstanding program!!  huge internet hug and thanks to everyone  involved in putting it together, to ops (o-p, o-p, ops, ops, ops), all the  sps (yeah, matt!), and all the other facilitators for their help in making  this past weekend so much better for me, for my mussels, and for all the  2004 delegates!  i wouldn't be strong if it weren't for all my mussels!!!  thanks, everyone!  peace out,  -christine

      My favorite moment from the weekend was during the Egg-drop. I've never seen that many eggs break, ever. They kept dropping and breaking, dropping and breaking. It got to the point that I almost didn't want to unwrap them anymore. *I* knew that the egg-drop is about more than just using straws to save an egg, but I was afraid that many students would, while walking away with the message, would still walk away disappointed. But then, during the debrief, and from conversations I had with people later, it was obvious that  no one cared . The students had not only realized intellectually that it didn't really matter whether their contraption succeeded or not, that the point of the exercise was to promote teamwork and solidify their team bonds, they had internalized that idea. And many of them did it even before we started talking about the whys of the egg-drop. They had already decided that they had had a great time, made new connections with each other, and had been successful simply because of that. They were an amazing group of students to work with, and of course the staff was instrumental in creating an environment in which teamwork and collaboration were valued so highly.

      Good AWESOME to all.  My favorite thing is just watching everyone.  Watching everyone grow, everyone get excited, everyone listen, everyone choosing.  I really like taking pictures because it forces me to continually be looking around at what is going on.  And that look in so many eyes, the look that we have all learned something. (like "Erin's choice to be calm").  At any and all moments something is happening to someone.  That kind of atmosphere is in part what makes the MassSTAR 3-day so successful.  It is a wonderful, special thing we all (students/staff/organizers/volunteers) accomplish at the 3-day.  Everyone should be very proud of all we did, and all we are GOING TO DO.  Thank you all for coming.  Please keep in touch.  LET'S DO THIS. Eric

      I would definitely have to say that working with ops was my favorite memory. During the Stop, Look, and Listen play, a bunch of student partners helped ops get things done.  We sacrificed a little bit of our time with our groups to make things run smoothly. We were all stuffing folders, covering the folders that said Plastic Surgery on them, and were chillaxin' and groovin' to Brians AWESOME mix CD. I think that was when the student partners made an awesome connection with Ops. Everyone was having a wicked good time until Brian told us that the DJ cancelled last minute. Instantly, everyone was calling anyone they knew with giant soundsystems, looking online, calling DJs and telling them that EVERY SINGLE SOPHOMORE IN MASSACHUSETTS IS HERE ( Yeah Melissa!)We were all under pressure to get a DJ in less than an hour, and we just did OUTSTANDING collaboration and teamwork. It was so amazing! Running back and forth from Rondileau to Woodward, trying to make things work. Once we were setting up, that was the culmination of all the positive, crazy energy.  We got the biggest radio we could find until the DJ came (Melissa Kaye, you totally ROCK!) Once Steph and I figured out how to turn on the mic of the podium, the  social was ON! The music was blasting...(Oh my starry-eyed surprise...) and all of a sudden, the 'Too Hot for MassSTAR" cheer happened. We were ridin round the pony like crazy. Everyone just came together and it was so frikkin cool. I can't even find the words to describe the way I felt in an eloquent way..it was just awe-inspiring, awesome, exciting, hair-raising, heart-stirring, impressive, and unforgettable!  ~Kim

      Hey all! Be prepared this is a long one, but there were a lot of things to be answered and discussed so that is my excuse.   I would love to see MassStar alive and well in five years. I want to see us continuing to touch the lives of high school sophomores. My biggest hope would be to have a solid core group of returning volunteers, especially alumni.  I would love to see us moving with the times and continuing to educate students with classic leadership skills as well. As ten years go by I hope that our numbers would continue to grow, with a strong alumni support system.  I would hope to see new and improved platforms and discussion panels.  My hopes for 15 years would be the same, maybe by this time we would be starting to expand into other states.  I am not sure 15 years is along way down the road. MassStar will always be in Massachusetts but maybe like I said before we will start expanding to other states.  If we do everything right (like we normally do) everyone will know about us.   I believe with the intelligence, experience and passion of our volunteers that our curriculum, workshops, and activities can only become the best out there.  We are a young educated passionate group of leaders working to pass along our knowledge. Our curriculum, workshops, and activities will always be deeply embedded with classic leadership qualities, however we will always progress with the times and the students that we are trying to reach.  I am not sure how many students will be involved, but I would hope that as word travels among schools that more and more schools would wish to participate.  Parental involvement is something that I have always wanted to see more of, however I am not sure how to get that to happen or in what capacity to use the parents.  I do feel that if the parents are involved it will continue the growth process after the students leave the conference.  Brand new things will always occur with so many creative minds working together.  This is one of those things that we are just going to have to wait and see what the future and our creativity brings us.   I know that this is rather longwinded and the answers are not completely definite, however we are involved in something that has so many variable all we can do is continue to work and do what we love, passing leadership on to the future.  Smile everyone.

      Question of the week:  Where do you want to see MassSTAR in 5 years? 10? 15?    Some things to consider...  Where will we be?    Who will know about us?    How good will our curriculum and workshops and activities be?   How many students will attend our conferences?  How many parents will be involved, and how?  What brand new things will we be doing?
