       Boredo...     Tired? Grab a blogger...    Yep. I am SO freakin' bored it ain't funny. I mean, I need something to do really really bad. My sis wants to use the comp so I can't type much. I think. But, anyway, I'm gonna be going to the store w/ my mom so I can't really type much. So, I need to take a shower. Isn't that grosse? It's almost 6:00 p.m. and I haven't taken a shower yet...(ok...maybe I shudn't hav sed that). But, I dunno. I called my buddy P-bear (the nick my friend Alescia made 4 him) and he wudn't home. Ya know, I miss skool. At least then, I actually had something to do. Ugh. Now I'm just sittin' next to this freaking 1984 edition comp that's about to break down. I need a life. I NEED some friends. *sigh I NEED 2 take a shower. For god sakes, I'm a GIRL! hehe. Well, I wonder if my P-bear called me back. Most likely, he didn't. He was out playin' basketball w/ his cousins. *sigh...everything is gonna be A-O-K (you have 2 read that in letter form 2 get it)         So...gotta go...     Yes...I'm going to the store with my sis and mom. UGH! Who likes going to the grocery store w/ family? Not me. I'm tired and cicadas are swarming in my tree in front of the house. I'll try to blog lata. Otha than that...I'm out. Peace 2 the Mid-East. That is, if u live in the Mid-East...uhh...yea.

       Summer fun!  Yes...yes...it's about time isn't it? Haha. Well, I'm actually really bored as you can entirely see. It's 2:00 in the morning and I felt the need to uncover my bloggy from it's ruins and ya know...type. Type, type, type. I think I've had enough of it. I mean, school is enough. Sheesh.    Introduction    I feel the need to introduce myself. Well, since many of you out there in the world don't know me. I'm 13 years old and my nickname is Nichi (nee-chee). You can just call me that for now since you really don't need to know my real name. I live in Ohio and yes, it's the year of the cicada and they're going strong. Now, they're asleep. I can't hear any of them. My birthday is July 17, 1990 which means I'm turning 14 next month! Yay! (it's really not all that) My sn for aim is  lilnichi717  so you can im me sumtime if you'd like. I have a website and it's called  urlLink Kawaii Kutie . So, please go there sumtime. Right now, I'm on hiatus but, you can keep posting back with it. Um...if you know html, photoshop, php, etc. I need you. I mean, I need as many ppl as I can get to help me w/ my site. But, I just don't know where I can go to get help. So, if you think you can help please aim me.    Scary...     Ok...it's really quiet down here. So, I can hear footsteps and things everywhere. I am SO PARANOID right now. I mean, I keep thinking somebody's going to rampage through my house and hurt me. Or something...me afraid...me VERY afraid. But, since I have you I'm not scared anymore. [If ANYTHING happens to me...they did it. Also, I ain't never scared. lol ^-^] Well, I'm gettin' sleepy (and scared) so I'm gonna go to sleep. I'm gonna be gettin' a new layout for my blog sumday. I dun really like these. I luv ya ppl!
