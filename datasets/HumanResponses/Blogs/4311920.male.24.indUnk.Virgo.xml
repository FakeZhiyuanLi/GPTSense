      As I'm laying on my bed, my phone rings.  Now let me just say that I don't receieve very many phone calls.  They are usually from 3 people: Justin, Lisa, and of course, Ashlie.  But since Justin was working, Lisa was in school, and Ashlie's phone was at my house, I didn't know who it could be.  I thought maybe Bridgette since I called her the night before to apologize for Saturday night, but it wasn't her.  To my surprise, it was my old high school friend Eric.  He wanted me to come play softball with him at Rucker Bar in Big Bend.  I was going shopping that evening with Justin and my mom, but I thought if we hurried, we could make it back on time.  So I said I was in.  We got to the park around 6 (Eric wanted us there by 6:15, gametime I'm guessing)  I ordered a beer and went into the outfield and saw that this team was made up of all the people I used to party with in Marquette as well as Keith, another one of my good high school buddies.  We stayed in the outfield fielding fly balls, but after a half hour, I started to think: Was the other team going to show up?  Well if you know my luck, they did not.  We had won the game by forfeit.  Boy was I disappointed.  I hurried up my shopping trip to get out there, and for what, a cancelled game.  There was one saving grace, a few of the guys girlfriends were there, as well as my brother, so we played a little pick up game.  Yeah it didn't count for shit, but it was fun anyways.  I guess I shouldn't complain since a little softball practice before this Sundays game is probably a good thing.  So there you have it, a Monday filled with not one, but two surprises.  One good and one bad... I guess it's better than nothing though.  Until next time, later folks.

      Well I figured my first real post should be about this weekend, which by the way, was a lot more stressful than I had anticipated.  I am not going to go into details (I'm not sure I want you guys to know exactly is going on), but lets just say that me and Ashlie ran into a little problem early Saturday morning.  We didn't end up going to bed until about 5:30 in the morning, and we got up early in Saturday morning so we could do something about our problem.  I couldn't (and still can't) get it out of my mind so the little sleep I had wasn't really that good.  So we spent much of Saturday morning trying to correct our problem.  I think we should be alright.  In fact, I'm positive everything is fine now.  Then we saw a movie, the Exorcist: The Beginning.  It was a decent movie, better than I thought it would be, but the last 20 minutes were very, very bad.  I'm not going to spoil anything for you guys if you do see it, but it kind of ruins what was a decent horror movie that played for the first 80 minutes.  Oh well every movie can't be great.  Then after some errands and stuff, we finally made it back out to Justin's for the party.  IT was the end of the summer party.  We got 2 half barrels and had 3 trays of jello shots.  Party turned out ok.  Most of the people who came didn't stay, and the ones that did were the regular people that always stay.  I got WAY too drunk and was quite hungover in the morning.  I felt slightly embarrased in the morning by the way I acted.  I'm not quite sure if Ashlie was all that happy at the way I acted, though I think she was just concerned as to my health in the morning.  She didn't like seeing me sick nor hearing me puke.  I was so drunk, that I think I really pissed off my friend Bridgette who drove an hour and a half from Illinois to come party with us.  I didn't even say good to her when she left.  I felt terrible.  I called her Sunday afternoon to apologize but she didn't answer so I left a message saying how bad I felt, and to invite her out next weekend so I could make things up to her.   But the one big event of this party was 4 years in the making.  My brother and Dana are finally dating and I don't think I could be any happier for the kid.  He's been wanting this for quite sometime and things between them two in the past few months seemed to indicate this was inevitable.  So I wish those two the best of luck and I cannot wait for me and Ashlie to go out on our first double date.  I think it is the first time both of us had girlfriends at the same time.  I kind of like it...  Well I'm gonna end this entry, but I'm sure I'll be back with more as next week I am moving out to Oconomowoc finally so I should have plenty of things to say then.  Later folks.

      Well here we are, with the first post in what I hope turns out to be an exciting new ordeal with me: sharing my thoughts with the rest of you (good and bad)  After reading some other sites that have Blog's, I've decided to create my own.  So I hope you guys and girls out there enjoy reading this site.  Sometimes the sight might be intersesting to read, sometimes not.  I hope to provide my fellow readers, with some insight of my life and some of the thoughts I have about things.  As many of you know, I bitch quite a lot, which makes this site a natural thing for me to do.  It gives me the opportunity to get all my bitching out so you guys don't have to listen to it constantly.  Well I hope everyone enjoys this.  Well later folks.
