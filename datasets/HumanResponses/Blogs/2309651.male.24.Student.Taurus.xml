      Dear Mr. Gore,   My, you must be very tired, going in front of a friendly radical crowd and yelling and screaming like a maniac.  Then you wonder how you lost the election four years ago.  Sure, you won the popular vote, but just imagine...You might have won those 528 votes in Florida if you hadn't been such a scathing liberal nutjob.     There has been a particular precedent for losing candidates in the past, they are rarely seen or heard from again, save the occasional goodwill trip to Haiti or some other country that isn't quite important.  They have a duty to this nation for doing the little, but necessary, things.  Giving speeches that would make even Hitler's theatrical coach blush isn't close to what an elder statesman such as yourself should be doing.  Here is a list of things that are more productive...  1)  President of the Keep-the-Expos-in-Montreal Association 2)  Helping to revive Craig T. Nelson's sagging acting career 3)  Writing a book on your favorite one-hit wonder band, Chumbawumba 4)  Hosting a talk show on the Lifetime channel in between reruns of the Golden Girls and the Nanny 5)  Reinventing "Double Dare" for past hippies 6)  Starting an NPR show that mainly deals with varying different types of fall foliage 7)  Opening a restaurant that serves food that does not harm the environment (no meat, no veggies, mostly just recycled paper and rainwater)   Of course there are many more things that would be more productive than you ranting and raving against the Bush administration, but I suppose you are happy doing just that.  Perhaps one of these days, you will finally call Bill.  It's been four years.  Just call to say 'What's up?'  I think he would appreciate that.  He would probably tell you to 'Shut the hell up', but you wouldn't listen to him in 2000 and gosh darnit, you probably won't listen to him now.  Well, I hope this letter finds you in good health and low blood pressure, please stay in touch and just remember...Just because a leftist group asks you to speak...It doesn't mean you have to have a conniption fit.  God Bless,   Tony DeFranco

      I have just taken a deeper look at some of the recent polling numbers that ABC just released on May 23 and it isn't looking as grim as the media would like to spin it.  In fact, most of the polling is not even being reported.  For example, take the question of straight Bush vs. Kerry.  In March of 2004, Kerry lead Bush 48-44.  Now, as Bush's "numbers go to record lows", Bush and Kerry are tied 46-46.  Do the math.  Kerry -2.  Bush +2.  When asked about who the public trustsin  Iraq, where "the President's support has eroded",  the President went from trailing by one point to leading Kerry by 6!  The bottom line here is that the media can say all they want about the President's declining numbers, but I say research the polling numbers for yourself and you will find they are not as soft as you would be lead to believe.  What they tell me is that when push comes to shove in November the public will have to make a clear and definate choice.  The public will soon realize that Kerry offers no real alternitive to anything.  When this realization occurs, Bush wins.

      Great Lines for my friends with ADD   We did not seek this war on terror, but this is history as we find it    The terrorists will not determine the future of Iraq    ...Then, with the approval of the Iraqi government, we will demolish the Abu Ghraib prison, as a fitting symbol of Iraq's new beginning...   And possibly one of the best things that I have heard about this war in a long time (said by Sen. Joe Lieberman):   If we don't lose our will, someday we'll look back on what we've done in Iraq with pride   We should be hearing more of this kind of talk around DC and on the campaign trail.

      While having a late night debate with some liberal friends of mine, I came to realize the true nature of any sort of debate that occurs with Bush foes.  Their debate is not entirely based on fact.  While employing some fact to back up their argument, they supplement it with pure venomous vitriol for our war-time President.  This is not the way to have a mature debate.  The issue du jour with most liberals, and I suppose the entire nation, is Bush's execution of the war in Iraq.  I will always entertain the oppurtunity to have a lively discussion of issues, so long as they are pertinent to the debate.  Not "Bush is dumb" or "I can't believe he drug us into this war".  Where are the facts?  They sweep the facts under the bed like a child trying to make his room appear tidy.  The facts are this.  Bush is not dumb.  You are ignorant if you think that he is.  Plain and simple.  The man is educated from the posh prep school of Philips Exeter to Yale to Harvard business school.  Calling Bush dumb would be indicting these schools of educational malpractice.  The knee-jerk liberal reaction is to say that he only was granted admission because of his family name.  Fine, but if he was dumb how did he graduate?  Or why didn't both Bush daughters go to Yale and not just one?  I am sure that Jenna could have dropped her name to gain admission.  Liberals were always evasive about reports that supposedly Bush had better grades than Al Gore during their times in college, but I never hasten to make that argument because calling someone smarter than someone else is a regression to the Neanderthal argument that one can pitch a large stone further than the other.  Liberal knee-jerk reaction #2:  Well, if he isn't dumb why does he talk dumb?  Bush speaks in the parlance of the average American; the average American who doesn't use the word 'parlance' nor does he care to.  President Bush, like many Americans, believe that vocabulary doesn't make the man, but what makes the man are the decisions that he makes when they count most...which segways nicely into the next counter-intellectual argument that liberals make: the Iraq war.  "Bush drug us into the Iraq war!" they always say, usually alleging some sort of conspiracy to get their oil or calling this payback for the first President Bush.  Let's talk about the truth, for a change.  The truth is that the intelligence that Bush had was the same that President Clinton had before him.  This intelligence stated that Saddam had WMDs.  Bush presented this intelligence to Congress, who overwhelmingly voted to go to war based on said intelligence--Senator Kerry also supported the legislation.  No one ever talks about that.  Liberals like to say that Bush did this without any regard for anybody's opinion and just lead us senselessly into war.  Which is not true, because he sought and received near uniamimous approval from Congress...so I guess it wasn't just Bush that drug us into this war.  Now the liberals get nervous, because they know that you have them in a tough spot.  So they resort to the war for oil diatribe.  If the war was for oil, where is the Iraqi oil??  Why does it cost me $30 to fill up my Volkswagen?  Again, they get flustered.  "Well, it was just to get back at Saddam for the President's dad" they angerily say.  Again, wrong.  Bush 41, although not publicly against the war, dispatched his advisers like Scocroft and Fitzwater to speak for him against action in Iraq.  Now, the liberal is really mad.  "I hate Bush!" they resort to...  Now you have won the debate because their hate has defeated them.  The liberals let their hate erase things from their memory...9/11, pre-Iraq War, etc.  Argue the facts, don't argue emotion...it just isn't mature.

       "We hold these truths to be self-evident," they said, "that all men are created equal." Strange as it may seem, that was the first time in history that anyone had ever bothered to write that down. Decisions are made by those who show up.   Whatever happened??

      I just wanted to apologize to my friend Mr. Brendan Burns for my unthoughtful response to his comments.  They were brash and not made in the best spirit of the blog.  We can all agree that Mayor O'Malley is a farce.

      This past weekend, Mayor Martin O'Malley was noticeably absent from the Preakness, Baltimore largest annual sporting event.  The mayor was off at "meetings" in New York when he should have been with his city at its annual showcase.  His absence is more critical this year for two reasons:  the possibility of Baltimore losing the Preakness and more importantly, terrorism.  As every legislative session passes without slots to boost Maryland's sagging horse racing industry, it becomes a clearer reality that the Preakness may have to leave Baltimore for a place that is politically and financially friendlier to the event.  O'Malley, of course, is against the Preakness leaving Baltimore, but in the same breath he is against providing the event a lifeline to survive: Slot Machines.  Why is he against slots?  Because it would undoubtedly secure political rival, Governor Ehrlich's reelection.  By O'Malley snubbing Preakness, he has shown once and for all that he has no vested interest in keeping the Preakness in Baltimore, and thereby shunning the millions of dollars it generates for the Baltimore economy.  If the Preakness were one day to leave Maryland, he would undoubtedly do what he always does when Baltimore gets in trouble...Blame everybody but himself.  Had O'Malley been at the race, perhaps it would have sent a message to the broader political community that O'Malley would not sit idly by to watch Maryland racing be put out to pasture, and that he would be an advocate for keeping the Preakness in Baltimore for a 129 more years.  But Marylanders got no such reassurance from the Mayor.  The second reason O'Malley should have been in at the Preakness, or at least in Baltimore is terrorism.  Preakness is attended by over 100,000 people.  If terrorism is to occur in Baltimore, Preakness would be high on the list of probable locations.  O'Malley, head of the National Association of Mayor's Committee on Homeland Security, would not have been in the city.  For a Mayor who has been so vocal and critical of the Bush administration's supposed ignorance to the plight of cities in the War on Terror, where was he on the day that Baltimore should be at its most vigilant?  After 9/11, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani attended the New York Yankees' World Series games as a symbol that he was standing by his city.  Where is O'Malley's display of leadership?  If he wants to criticize anyone on Homeland Security, be there when it matters most.  Perhaps O'Malley's political handlers, who have been doing probably the worst jobs ever in 2004 causing blunder after blunder for the Mayor who admittedly aspires to be President, should think these issues more clearly and carefully next time they want to schedule a trip to New York, then Italy.  O'Malley's continued arrogance will undoubtedly be his final undoing, sooner rather than later.

      Much has been made about Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld's perceived handling of the war in Iraq.  Now, critics of the war have shifted their focus to his deputy Paul Wolfowitz.  Today Wolfowitz testified to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee where he faced a barrage of question, mainly attacking his credulity.  Even affable Senator Russ Feingold questioned his integrity, saying that senators had asked before the war about plans for securing weapons of mass destruction and dealing with a possible negative response from the Iraqi people.  "I, frankly, feel we were never given real answers to that, and I have a feeling that it's because there wasn't a serious plan, and I think at this point we're paying a serious price for it," Feingold said.   Wolfowitz responded, while the plan wasn't perfect, there was a serious plan in place.  It is my perception that in this highly charged election year atmosphere, critics to the war expect nothing short of perfection when handling Iraq.  One's response to this would be "Well, when you are dealing with American lives, It should be perfect or close to it".  This may be true, a war plan should be perfect, but realistically this is impossible.  Our Iraq war plan took into account the acceptance of the Iraqi people, and I am going to go out on a limb and say that we have garnered this acceptance even throughout the prisoner scandal and what not.  What our war plan did not take into account was the little read AP wire piece written in April 2003--shortly after the liberation of Baghdad--in which Al Qaida called on all "friends of Islam" to descend upon Iraq and take up arms.  No one really paid much attention in April, but six months later people took heed.  The point is that the roadside bombings of American troops, the terrorist attacks on Iraqi civilians, and the other various things that have gone on in Iraq have been perpetrated by mostly non-Iraqis in the hopes of disrupting what would be a peaceful transfer of power on June 30.  So when Senator Feingold claims that Wolfowitz was not right about the acceptance of the Iraqi people, he is wrong.  He should modify his statement to say that we have not yet garnered the acceptance of the Syrian militias or the Iranian militias, who do not want to see democracy take hold in the middle east.    The resolve of President Bush, Secretary Rumsfeld, and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz in maintaining that deadline should be commended.  Terrorist will not dictate the pursuit of democracy.  As well as, politicians should not bicker about their perceptions of Wolfowitz's perceptions of a war plan that has not come to its full fruition yet.  Mistakes have been made, but June 30 has yet to pass.  Democracy will come to Iraq, but even in this age of attention deficit disorder, we must have patience...

      For what is the tenth day in a row, the Baltimore Sun has seen fit to print a story about Governor Ehrlich's multiculturalism statement.  Enough is enough.  Actually enough was enough about a week ago, but now it is excessive.  In a newspaper where 90% of the writing comes from the AP or Reuters, the original writing is nothing but petty swipes at the Governor and at times, the President.  These swipes are not only coming on the Op-Ed page (although it is mostly syndicated writers from other papers), these swipes are coming disguised as news articles!  Take for example today's article.  The opening paragraph is remarkably the same as the previous days.  It says today:  It might be "bunk" to Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., but multiculturalism has been a priority in Maryland public schools since 1970s, when the State Board of Education first issued regulations addressing the contributions of other cultures, which Ehrlich is sworn to uphold  Is there any new news to Marylanders?  Not really.  It merely just points out for the umpteenth time that Ehrlich said that multiculturalism is bunk.  It has long been known that The Sun and Ehrlich have no lost love.  This dates back to the beginning of the Ehrlich administration when he said that he had a particular disdain for the Sun.  Now two years later, the Sun has gotten its chance at payback.  Ehrlich states his opinion on an issue, and the Sun runs article ad infinitum.  What this has really done is pay into Ehrlich's hand.  The Sun looks ridiculous.  It has been two weeks and there is no sign of ending.  Perhaps, the Sun should write more stories on its rapidly declining readership...I think that is more newsworthy at this point.

      Fund right again, here it is...    Anger Management   Dems start to realize that a campaign of hate won't beat President Bush.   Monday, May 17, 2004 12:01 a.m. EDT    It's a cliché this is becoming the meanest year in politics yet. But it's true. Last week, Mike Lavigne, the spokesman for the Texas Democratic Party, admitted calling a state Supreme Court justice "a Nazi." When his boss, Democratic Party chairman Charles Soecthting, was asked if an apology was due, he said, "I don't have a problem that Mike said it."   Then there's Sen. Ted Kennedy, who told a startled Senate last week that "Saddam's torture chambers have been reopened under new management, United States management." Some conservative talk show hosts, such as Michael Savage, have railed against gays and immigrants while they question John Kerry's patriotism. On the left, Bush bashing has become a national sport.   Prominent Democrats are beginning to realize that hatred of President Bush won't defeat him in November. One of the reasons that Mr. Bush continues to lead John Kerry in polls despite the bad news from Iraq is that many voters tune out criticism of the president when it turns hysterical. "It isn't enough for you to be venomous and be angry," Bill Clinton urged a MoveOn.org fund-raiser last week. "Don't be mad. Smile. Be glad."  That's good advice. Republicans shed their image as dour naysayers only when they embraced Ronald Reagan's inspirational optimism. One of the chief complaints Democratic consultants have about Mr. Kerry is his gloomy demeanor and pessimistic message. They're trying to engineer a makeover.       If liberals are going to follow Bill Clinton's advice and become happy warriors, they have some housecleaning to do first. The very group he spoke to, MoveOn.org, belongs to the paranoid school of American politics. In January, it held a contest to select the best ads that told "the truth about George Bush's policies." Two of the entries posted on the group's website compared Mr. Bush to Hitler. One ad morphed an image of Hitler into the president and likened "1945's war crimes" to "2003's foreign policy." Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle gave an eloquent speech last week at the University of Kansas calling on people of all ideological views to stop "demonizing those with whom we disagree." He called the MoveOn.org ad "outrageous."  Certainly there are rhetorical excesses on the right too. High-octane conservative Web sites feature vitriolic personal attacks on Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, Teresa Heinz Kerry and others. But some liberal activists go further. Michael Goodwin of New York's Daily News spent a day listening to Air America, the new liberal talk-radio network, and found he had to endure hours of "rancid venom." Host Randi Rhodes compared U.S. prisons in Iraq to the "Nazi gulag," a mixed ideological metaphor as well as an inflammatory one.   Nor are Nazi allusions limited to talk radio. Seymour Hersh, who broke the story of the Iraqi prisons in The New Yorker, appeared on CNN last week and said a picture of two guard dogs snarling at a prisoner was "a scene from we know what, you know, [the] Third Reich." When host Wolf Blitzer asked him to be more specific, Mr. Hersh changed the subject.  MoveOn.org is financed in part by billionaire George Soros, who last year also compared Mr. Bush to Hitler and said that Israel was "likely" a big but secret reason for the war in Iraq. Mr. Soros is also a major financial backer of the Media Fund, an anti-Bush group directed by Harold Ickes, who served as President Clinton's deputy chief of staff. When Mr. Ickes was asked what its supporters thought of Mr. Soros's penchant for Bush-Hitler comparisons, Mr. Ickes said "we have not taken heat because of it."   It's time that liberals police their own and flush out the nests of the most virulent Bush haters. A sure sign that a movement or party is out of power and likely to stay that way is if much of its public image is defined by its fever-swamp fringe. Conservatives had a similar dilemma in the 1960s when journalists were able to tag the movement by its most extreme elements. Liberal author Jonathan Schoenwald has documented how conservative leaders had to move carefully to "exorcise the demons of right-wing extremism." The John Birch Society's opposition to communism morphed into a conspiratorial vision that could label almost anyone a communist sympathizer, including Dwight D. Eisenhower. William F. Buckley and other mainstream conservatives spent years isolating and discrediting the Birchers. It wasn't easy. To blast the Birchers indiscriminately would have risked alienating many committed followers who were only dimly aware of the society's kookiness. To wait too long would have risked tarring the entire conservative movement. Liberals may not believe they are in a similar position as Mr. Buckley and his allies were two generations ago. But there are clues that the ridicule and fulmination with which liberals attack "that cowboy accident in the White House" are backfiring. Mr. Bush has told Bill Sammon of the Washington Times that that the more he is unfairly attacked, the less likely liberals will be able to convince swing voters he is a bad president.  "Liberals divide into two parts," one network correspondent told me: "those who believe that when the president says he enjoys being 'misunderestimated' that's it a sign of his ignorance, and smarter ones who've figured out he is using it in a joking way to make a point about how he overcomes low expectations." Too many on the left think of Mr. Bush as dumb or an evil manipulator of public opinion, or somehow hold both views simultaneously.   Conservatives have fallen into this trap too. In the 1990s some became so angry with President Clinton that they welcomed the term "Clinton haters." They were convinced that the country would see the light and drive him from office through indictment or impeachment. It's now generally acknowledged that anti-Clinton rhetoric caused Republicans to lose House seats in the 1998 midterm election, and the country never agreed that Mr. Clinton should leave office even though his subsequent actions (such as the midnight pardon of financier Marc Rich) have convinced most historians that Clinton character flaws did indeed have public consequences.      Liberals are now equally convinced the country will see how Mr. Bush's religious fervor and Texas cockiness have led to a quagmire in Iraq and installed extremists in positions of power. No one is suggesting they must stop believing that, but in a time of war they would do both themselves and the country good if they isolated their extremists and muted their own rhetoric more. A Washington Post poll taken last month shows how hard it is to build a winning anti-Bush coalition on anger. When asked how people felt about Bush policies, on a range of enthusiastic to angry, only 18% of voters said they were angry. Even among Democrats those who were angry numbered only 30%.  Sen. Daschle tells a story about a reporter who was startled to see George McGovern attending the 1993 funeral of Pat Nixon and shaking the hand of President Nixon. When the reporter asked Mr. McGovern why he would pay his respects to the wife of a man who had used underhanded tactics to defeat him, the former Democratic presidential nominee replied simply, "You can't keep on campaigning forever." Now the country is in danger of becoming more divided in war at the same time the toxic nature of political discourse is turning off many voters. With almost six months before Election Day, here's hoping that both sides find ways to fight fire without gasoline.

      I have a problem...I support President Bush.  Usually this pronoucement is met with sighs and gasps, but I can't help it.  I support the President.  In today's political climate it seems like uttering those four words is social suicide.  People are aghast and look at you like you just told them that you have and continue to support the Nazi Party.  Call me crazy, but we live in America.  One of the greatest things about this country (for better or worse) is that we are a melting pot of ideas.  My insane notion that the President is doing a good job doesn't seem to fit.  The worst part of it is that people in a miscalculated way to write the President off, call him stupid.  "Oh that man...he is too dumb to be president".  This is the kind of haughtiness that I expect from liberals, but now it is coming from people who would not be otherwise classified as a liberal.  Calling the President stupid has been going on for decades, but what the President does is more a political strategy if anything else.  He talks plainly, something that the liberal establishment hates.  They wanted a nuancer like Kerry--someone with five answers to every problem.  In a recent Time mag article, a column described Kerry has too smart to beat Bush.  Huh?  My question is who is smarter?  The smart guy or the smart guy who plays dumb to win?  The bottom line is something I said before.  People just don't like Bush.  Not for any policy reasons.  They just don't like him and that is not a proven way to unseat an incumbent.  Hate is not a motivating political factor.  Just ask Howard Dean...

      I could not help but feel a little preturbed sitting in the parking lot otherwise known as Interstate 83 leaving Baltimore.  Traffic was snarled from downtown to the interchange at 695.  All for a police funeral.  Now, I am for honoring fallen police officers as much as the next person, but at what cost?  There must have been tens of thousands affected by the funeral procession of one man.  The entire JFX was shut down as well as the northside of the Beltway and Harrisburg Expressway to Padonia Road.  I am not saying that this man did not deserve some sort of police honor, but not at this cost.  I waited in traffic for about an hour to run simple errands, but think of the truck driver who had to make a delivery or of the business man late for an important meeting.  It just isn't worth it.  Not to mention it seemed like every police officer in the state was in a 2 mile radius of each other.  I think honoring the dead has its limitations.

      Since he was so good to list my blog on his, I will follow suit.  amarweisman.blogspot.com is a well-written and well-thought out blog that always provokes some sort of an opinion.  Once a standard-bearer of the conservative wing of the GOP, Mr. Weisman has now fused philosophy and a bit of libertarianism into his brand of conservatism--not precisely my cup of tea, but still a good read if you can navigate your way around his dog stories and questionable CD track listings.

      Monday's column by John Fund really tells a tale of a candidate and why he is going to lose.  John Kerry is too liberal for America. Plain and simple.  His campaign staff is stacked with ex-Kennedy employees.  His voting record in the Senate is the pits.  The worst part is any attempt for him to move to the center (which he should have done by now) has been met with some sort of soundbyte from the past or vote that he cast that contradicts him.  Kerry needs to find a message and find it soon.  Perhaps he should not be waiting so long to pick a VP.  The way things are going for Bush these days, Kerry should be up by about 15 points.  But it is still close.  He needs to start listening to moderate Democrats.  Listen to the Breauxs, the Libermans, the Bayhs.  For God sakes, stop listening to Kennedy and stop taking him around the country showboating him.  Kennedy does not represent the American that most Americans want!

      A few days ago, liberal California Senator Dianne Feinstein said this about the Iraqi prison photos:   They're disgusting.  If somebody wanted to plan a clash of civilizations, this is how they'd do it. These pictures play into every stereotype of America that Arabs have: America as debauched, America as hypocrites. Cheney and Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz act like they know all the answers, almost like a divine right. They don't have a divine right, and they are wrong.    While the photos maybe disgusting, I don't think the honorable Senator could have gotten it more wrong.  These photos did was not play into the  Arab  stereotype, but the terrorist stereotype.  Then the terrorist fired back confirming our stereotype of them.  What did they do?  They found an American and beheaded him on the internet.  Now, the American media, who has been played so well in this case by the terrorists, is equating one act to the other.  Excuse me, last time I checked the Iraqi prison photos did not show any brutal executions.  An American was brutally murdered and the leftist media is convinced that humiliating Iraqi   PRISONERS OF WAR  is on the same plane.  Americans are not hypocrites.  This is not to say we as Americans are always right, but we are not hypocrites.  Hypocrites are the terrorists who complain to no end about American barbarism and debauchery, but they are the most savage people on Earth, killing and maiming innocent people.  The only American hypocrites I see are the liberal media and liberal Senators like Dianne Feinstein, who seem to get their talking points from the Kerry campaign with lightning speed and precision.

      While I still care about this non-story, I will discuss it for a bit.  The Iraqi jail situation is, to put it lightly, not a good situation.  But what people need to do is put it within a context of war.  The prisoners were war criminals.  They were imprisoned for trying to kill American soldiers or American civilians!  They were bad people!  All of the sudden people are realizing that we use certain interrogation on these bad people for them to give us information on other bad people.  Let me tell you, we have been doing this for many years.  It was probably much worse during the Cold War.  It seems to me a bit naive of some people to be shocked and disgusted about this.  This is war.  Someone said to me the other day, "All is fair in love and war".  While it is a cliche, it holds true.  If one of these prisoners can help stop further attacks on our troops, then our soldiers should be able to use any means necessary to get this information.  Imagine if on 9/10/2001, we had captured someone who might have had information on what would occur the next day.  Wouldn't intense interrogation methods be warranted?  Wouldn't it seem necessary?    War is war.  The Iraqis never played by the rules when they pretended to surrender, then shot our soldiers.  They never apologized for any of their atrocities.  Then you have these jerks on the cable news shows talking about violations of the Geneva Convention.  WE ARE THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT FOLLOWS IT (modified: the only country with an active military.)  Not even the self-righteous French who scripted most of the rules follow it with active prison camps in South America and islands in the Mediterreanian.    It is all just plain politics during an election year.  Bush gave an apology, which I would have never have done.  Now all these people need to just be quiet.

      The few that do know what they are talking about choose to argue on a couple Bush administration policies.  They usually are the Iraq War (no one ever argues the greater War on Terror) or the economy, which in the past couple of months has become somewhat of a non-issue, yet Kerry still stumps on it.  Even in these circumstances, people are wholly misguided.  Ask anyone why they disagree with the Iraq War and they honestly can't tell you!  The usual response is "Well, we have no right being there"  No right?  This opinion doesn't seem to jibe with our foreign policy for the last 200 or so years.  What right did we have in France in 1918 or 1944?  What right did we have launching massive air campaigns over the cities of Japan in 1945?  Or perhaps we were flawed in assisting South Korea against the aggression of China and North Korea.  What do all these things have in common?  The protection of and perservation of democracy.  Now some might argue how do you protect or preserve democracy in a place where it never existed (Iraq)?  My response would be to look to the democratization of Germany and Japan.  The democracy of the Weimar Republic failed in Germany in the years after WWI and before WWII, much less did democracy ever exist there before that time.  Why did we even bother to try post-WWII?  Same thing with Japan, why bother?    The answer is simple.  As Americans, most of us believe in the intrinsic good of democracy.  It is been bred in us.  America has been a place where people of all nationalities come to escape oppression and participate in democracy.  Americans believe, with just cause, that democracy should be spread throughout the world because the will of the people is infalliable versus the will of one or few.  No greater testimony can be given to these facts than the participation of former Eastern bloc countries in Iraq.  Besides Britain and Italy, there has been no greater European supporter of our mission in Iraq then the countries that suffered under the oppression of the USSR for too many years.  They know the horrors of dictatorship and they know now the beauty of democracy.  Now they are assisting another country in that vision.

      The events of the past two weeks and actually, the past year have driven me to create this blog.  It is my purpose to add my opinion on any number of topics.  It is my view that the number one thing  that is wrong with people regarding politics, Iraq, and so on today is that they are wholly uninformed and wholly misinformed.  Most people who attempt to argue the war or the upcoming election DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT.  The crux of their arguments lie in the fac that they do not like Bush.  You ask them why don't you like Bush?  9 times out of 10 they call him arrogant or too much of a cowboy.  They can't argue any policy matters because usually they don't know too much about it.  They just don't like him, and that is not enough to have a civil discourse about.
