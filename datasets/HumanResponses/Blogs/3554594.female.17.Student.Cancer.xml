      The warmth of your touch. The strength in your eyes. Knowing that you listen to every thought in my head.  I wish you you could see yourself through my eyes. And understand the truth that is deep inside my heart.  I know I am not perfect, I'm not going to lie, But I try to be the best lover I can be.  You raise me up, Even when I tear you down. Your words of wisdom,  Build my confidence.  I know the beauty that lies inside of me, It's an understanding that comes from the beauty within you. The beauty you share through your touch and your eyes

      You are my dream, the most wondrous flower Lovelier than a rose, a woman like no other  Each gentle line, every curve of your face You weaved into my soul with your breath's lace  That beautiful music I long to hear Is your voice that so caresses my ear  Even your glance my heart aches for and sighs For what I see is heaven in your eyes  Innocently, subtlety grows love's seed Into my life you grew, completing me  Dreaming, hope fills night’s hours, however few That always you will want me there for you  My dream then begs morning’s light to come true That this day in my arms I will find you  That each hour we are as one or apart My love finds that special place in your heart  Desperately, I search your eyes to see A fire of love, burning feelings for me  Will love’s seeking even find one small spark? Or just my reflection—lonely and dark  Do you think me a fool indeed? Who hopes one day my love you'll need  Only if in my dreams we are together Then I shall dream of you my love forever

      Do you think of me  Like I think of you My life has been crazy Not sure what to do Do you dream of me late at night Wishing you had me to hold tight? Are your thoughts in a haze The nights are long And so are the days? Everything is in a blur You feel as if there is no cure? You try to avoid When in all reality you want to fill the void? You want to run But you can’t seem to hide Your heart feels like it’s about to die Are you crying for no apparent reason Your moods changing like the four seasons? You are hungry, but not for food You know in your heart what would satisfy you Does the distance between us kill you like it does me? At times are you finding it hard to breath? Are you caught in a trap and there is no way out? Making you angry enough to want to shout? Do you feel like you are going out of your mind Everything you do lately is a waste of time? If you feel these things, then you feel the same as me Constantly fighting a battle, losing inner peace Don’t you think it’s time you come back to me? I LOVE YOU!!!!!

      At one time, I didn't even believe in love  and I always thought that everything was spurious  all the words about love and all the promises  were untrue for me and for my heart  I always thought love is only something needed  But you,  you were like a stranger  who appeared suddenly in front of me  and changed all of me Then, I fell in love with you  Previously, you were in my mind when I was quiet  Then, when I was talking to someone else  or when I was struggling with something else  or... when I was living  you were in my mind again  As the time went, my sleepless nights began  Your vision was a hope for me  which teared the night  and filled my heart  Every endless night,  I prayed for thousands times  for my only hope...  It was you!  The biggest happiness after falling in love,  is to confess that you're in love...  But I couldn't experience the second one  And i never can...

      Don't love me because you have to, Love me because you want to.  Don't hate me for the things I do, Love me for the things I feel.  Don't want me to hurt me, Want me to love me. Want me to care. Want me to be with me forever.

      Do you love me or do you not?  You told me once but I forgot.  So tell me now and tell me true, so I can tell you, I love you too.  Of all the girls I ever met,  your the one I wont love so much.  If I die before you do,  I'll to go heaven and wait for you.  If your not there by judgement day,  I'll know you went the other way.  I'll give the angels back their wings,  and risk the loss of everything.  Just to prove my love is true,  I WILL GO TO HELL JUST TO BE WITH YOU.

      Still dreaming of you I am I lay awake imagine your by my side In my arms your the only one Baby do you ever think about me? I want to be with you in your dreams too And tell you that I love you because You're sweet and beautiful You have a good personality And what I really like is when You make me laugh better yet when You make me sing and if you cry I'll be there catching your tears telling you not to fear For I am here by your side Dreaming in this sleep of ours in all hours of the day and night I promise you everything will be alright I'll never forget you Even if we do sometimes fight Take a step back into the light Into the light of your heart Shining down on me warmer than any sun I've ever known and learnt to become In this dream we are closer It's just us and with that light shining You make all this true Me and you together For the moment we can dream until our dreams actually come true Because dreams do come true Once I finally have you in my arms To caress and hear you laughing at jokes How cute that would be.... I'm dreaming of you a bright star Oh my little pretty I wonder if you ever think about me?

      How could an angel love me so? Won’t it be consider a crime? How could an angel’s love come true? I feel it in my veins If I allow my self to love you so, Won’t God throw me in fire? Yet it’s too late to wonder now Coz I love you with everything I am  The warmth embrace of an angel’s wings Do comfort me at night Oh how could an angel kiss so sweet? I’m so thankful you are mine You plummeted down from heaven high Down right here to my waiting arms Oh how could an angel’s kiss Be so fierce? It makes me wonder why. You’re everything I have hoped for How could an angel love me so?

      Pictures of your face flash through my mind  I think about you all the time  This feeling isn't mutual it's really real  This isn't no game, this is the real deal  I loved many before but not as much as you  Can you say you feel the same to?  I love you with all my heart I really do  All I want to hear from you is I love you too

      If you're asking if I need you the answer is forever  If you're asking if I'll leave you the answer is never  If you're asking what I value the most the answer is you  If you're asking if I love you the answer is I do!!!

      When I think of us together, the sun begins to shine. I feel all happy, warm in side, smiling all the time.  I long to hold you once again, to feel your lips touch mine.  But seeing as you are miles away from me,  I guess it will take time.  When I lay in bed and think, I still feel sad and lonely.  I miss your touch and smile,  you're still my one and only.  When you said "I love you",  I shivered from head to toe. I wanted you to hold me, and never let you go.  If I could only have one wish,  I'd wish that you were mine forever. So I could love and care for you,  ........until the end of time.

      If one day you feel like  crying...  Call me.  I don't promise that  I will make you laugh,  But I can cry with you.   If one day you want to run away  Don't be afraid to call me.  I don't promise to ask you to stop...  But I can run with you.   If one day you don't want to listen to anyone...  Call me.  I promise to be there for you.  And I promise to be very quiet.   But if one day you call...  And there is no answer...  Come fast to see me.  Maybe I need you.  Or maybe something has happened to me   If I ever ignored you. I'm Sorry...   I maybe out of my mind if i do Or something is really wrong if that happens I'm Sorry...   If I ever made you feel bad or put you  down.  I'm Sorry...   Don't ever forget that! Through bad times  and good,  I'll always be here for you.   I am Sorry...  For everything wrong I've ever done.     I'm writing this because what if tomorrow  never comes?    What if inever get to say good-bye or give a  u a BIG hug?     What if i never get to say I'm sorry or I  love you one last time??   Because what if tomorrow never comes?     I LOVE YOU! ...Pamela Wong Hui Mei..my hunnie...my love

      I was thinking about you today and I do that a lot it seems. You're always in my heart by day, at night you drift into my dreams.  I cannot shake these feelings for you, but then I'd never had a desire to. The blessing of our love and friendship, is something I want to share with you.  I want to feel you near me, when you're so far away. I hope you feel me in your heart, as you travel your path today.  Footprints in the sands of time, walking closer towards each other.   These are some of the memories, that come with thoughts of you. These feelings are from my very heart, and something you can hold as true.

      I look into your eyes and I know I made a mistake I want to hold you  I want to kiss you  I want you  Please take me back  I promise to worship you  You are my true love  I hope I am yours Please don't doubt my love for you because I swear it's true

      I came to know...  What it was like - to struggle. And... What it was like - to go without.  I came to know... What it was like - to be disappointed. And... What it was like - to live with heartache and pain.  Many times the tears... would come to my eyes And many times - i just cant cry out.  Throughout it all... You were there - while I worked it through.   To this day... If You would had asked me... Would you like to meet someone - that would... : speak heart to heart with you. : love and cherish you forever. : be willing to work at becoming your best friend. : be there for you through the bad times as well   as the good times.  And I had replied... I would...I WIL!!!

      When two people commit... To the personal well-being and happiness of the other the more meaningful and loving the relationship.  A relationship - I desire to have with you.  It requires... hard work, courage, and maturity. It requires... honesty and trust, respect and consideration. It requires... good-will and good-faith. It requires... sharing and caring. It requires... each to communicate to the other their needs. It requires... dialogue and mutual understanding. It requires... the embracing of both endings and new beginnings.  Ongoing hear to heart talks... are also a requirement. Thus there was the need for me to give you this poem. For in this moment... This is what I need from you.

      The universe does not... hold back The stars...  The sun does not.......... hold back Its rays...  A cloud does not.......... hold back Its rain...  The ocean does not....... hold back Its waves...  And a river does not.......... hold back Its water...  All - in its own way is a release.  Including my love for you.  Holding back... until, I'm with you

      I miss you... Like the flower in the Winter missing the Spring.   I miss you... Like the wave in the ocean missing the shore.  I miss you... Like the seedling in the dark forest missing the light.  I miss you... Like the stream on the mountain missing the rain.  I miss you... I cried.  And Spring came...and the wave tumbled... And the seedling grew... and it rained.  And it came to be... this poem Somehow, made its way - to you...

      Missing you on the Holiday  I miss you so much It's not even funny As for touch Nothing compares to you, honey  Sitting at Christines It's so hard to think So strong are the feelings They can't be hidden by drink  It's you I think about No matter who or what's around Whether they scream or shout Thoughts of you do abound  Am I making myself clear Or should I be more defined Memories of you, my dear Constantly, of you, remind  I wouldn't have it any other way I want you around constantly In my mind and my heart you'll stay The loss of you is too costly  As clearly as can be stated I love you with all my heart No matter how long we've dated It feels as if it's just the start  By this do I mean That the time really flies However much of each other we've seen "Tired of you", never applies  I am head over heels And I'm loving every minute How wonderful it feels I've not kept a secret  Since all others know It's only fair That you, as my beau Should also be aware  My heart is yours to keep That I don't want to change Attention, on you I'll heap And love, we will exchange   Although tis is not my work....i copied it...because it truly shows how much i miss u...shows the feeling inside me...i love u hunnie...i will await right here till the day u return....i love u...

      When the cold air tickled the back of my neck, I could have sworn it was you It was u that breathing on me as you were kissing me there. And when it rained I almost ran outside wanted to run to u For a split second I forgot we were miles apart. It's this distance that will test us, being separate now will help us realize how much we need to be together in the end.

      I'm not a perfect person As many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears Thats why i need you to hear  I've found a resaon for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is You (x4)  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you

      Never say “I love you” if you don’t care.  Never talk about feelings if they aren’t really there.  Never touch a life if you meant to break my heart.  Never say you will when you don’t plan to start.  Never look in the my eyes when all you do is lie.  The cruelest thing u can do to me is to let me fall in love when u doesn’t intend to catch me fall…

      Love is not about, “It’s your fault” but its about “I’m sorry”, not about “Where are you?” but about “I’m right here”, not about “How could you!” but “I understand”,  not about “I wish you were” but “I’m thankful you are”.

      Love hurts when you break up with someone.  It hurts even more when someone breaks up with you.  But love hurts the most when the person you love has no idea how you feel.

      My hunnie's embrace grabs hold of something deep within my soul. Her magic touch soothes my heart and fills an empty hole.  My hunnie's kisses are so soft and gentle, more exquisite than fine wine. Her slender fingers course through my hair, sending shivers down my spine.  My hunnie's gaze I dare not meet too long, although it may be bliss. For in her eyes of ocean blue, I may fall into the abyss.  My hunnie's an earth bound angel, whose wings she had to shed. If my sweet be my true love, then my true love will b like a bed of blue roses.

      I lie on the ground, and stare into space, the stars start to move, into the shape of your face.  I see you there now, looking down at me, with that cute little smile, that I like to see.  You say "close your eyes" "tell me what you see" I see only two people, just you and me.  We're walking the shoreline, with our feet getting wet, the horizon turns pink, as the sun starts to set.  We spend every second together, cherishing every second when i am with u on that white sandy shore, then I hold you while thinking, I could want nothing more.  Oh I wish I could be in that one special place, as I lie on the ground, and I stare into space...

      When you are sad, I will dry your tears When you are scared, I will comfort your fears When you need love, my heart I will share When you are sick, for you I will care  You will feel my love when we are apart Knowing that nothing will change my heart When you are worried, I will give you hope When you are confused, I will help you cope  When you are lost, and can’t see the light My love will be a beacon, shining ever so bright This is my vow, one that I pledge till the end For you above all are my wife and best friend  These words I have written, speak of my love for you From my lips these words spoken, shall always ring true God has blessed me, and with your hand in mine Both of our hearts, will forever intertwine  Into all lives, falls pain and sorrows, I promise together, we will meet all tomorrows Happy in marriage, honor and love blessed in unity by God above

      The sun rises above the hillcrest, As does the joy of my heart; Rays of warmth and love, From her I will never depart.  Fresh dew upon the grass, Young birds chirp in their nests; I watch her gently sleep, My love to her I silently profess.  I enjoy the stillness and calm, Watching as she smiles and dreams; She brings me to stillness and peace, Like that of a slow flowing stream.  My heart and soul flow with love, And I smile as I quietly reflect; I’ve been handed a sweet princess, A sweet princess to love and to protect.  A vow to myself I make, As she quietly sleeps away; To love and always cherish her, Until my last breath... until my last day.

      Each time I miss you,  a star falls down from the sky.  So, if you looked up at the sky and found it dark with no stars,  it is all your fault.  You made me miss you too much!"  --------------------------------------------------------------------    One night, the moon said to me, If she makes you cry,  why don't you leave him?'  I looked at the moon and said,  Moon, would you ever leave your sky  --------------------------------------------------------------------  When i saw your love coming,  i welcomed it with open arms and let it enter into me.  People will ask,  'Are you in love?'  I will say, "No, love is in me. hunnie...you are my heart..you r in me  ------------------------------------------------------------------  Darkness isn't the absence of light... it's the absence of you.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  A priceless moment is when you right in my eyes to tell me that u have fallen in love with me more and more.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  every word I said could make you laugh, I'd talk forever.  I asked the sky just what we had, It showed forever.  If the song I sang to you filled your heart with joy, I'd sing forever.  -------------------------------------------------------------------  When I'm with you all my fears disappear.  So, I guess if you're wondering what my biggest fear is,  it would be losing you."  ------------------------------------------------------------------  In my heart there will always be a place for you  it will never change.  I'll keep you with me forever.  Wherever I am ... there you are.  --------------------------------------------------------------  They say the sun, the moon, the stars and other heavenly bodies are far away from us;  I believe they are always close to me whenever we are together, because I see them in your eyes.  The sun rises and sets in your eyes  -------------------------------------------------------------------  If I could put into words how my heart feels when I see you,  or when I think of you,  I would be talking forever  -------------------------------------------------------------------  Loving u takes courage:  fearing it could end at any moment  and yet having faith it will last forever  -----------------------------------------------------------------  I'll be dreaming of you tonight,  'til tomorrow  I'll be holding you tight,  and there's no where in the world I'd rather be,  then be sleeping forever having wonderful dreams bout u,my hunnie  hunnie...i am sorry....soooo sorry..god..please...please...gib her a dream tonight and please help me....help me to make her forget all the pain i caused her..hunnie..i love u tooooo much,...i never knew loving someone too much would turn out to b hurting them...i am sorry...aishiteru...sarangheayo...wo ai ni....i...love u soo much...goodnite.... the stars tonight is still sooo beautiful...even now at 4:am...is still sooo beautiful....goodnite...sarangheayo

      The Presence of Love in me  And in Life's noisiest hour, There whispers still the ceaseless Love of Thee, The heart's Self-solace and soliloquy.       You mould my Hopes, you fashion me within;      And to the leading Love-throb in the Heart      Thro' all my Being, thro' my pulse's beat;      You lie in all my many Thoughts, like Light,      Like the fair light of Dawn, or summer Eve      On rippling Stream, or cloud-reflecting Lake.  And looking to the Heaven, that bends above you, How Soft! I bless the Lord that made me love you.

      Escape me? Never— Beloved! LoVe In My LiFe  While I am I, and you are you,    So long as the world contains us both,    Me the loving and you the loth, While the one eludes, must the other pursue. My life is a fault at last, I fear: It seems too much like a fate, indeed! Though I do my best I shall scarce succeed. But what if I fail of my purpose here?  It is but to keep the nerves at strain, To dry one's eyes and laugh at a fall, And baffled, get up to begin again,— So the chase takes up one's life, that's all. While, look but once from your farthest bound, At me so deep in the dust and dark, No sooner the old hope drops to ground Than a new one, straight to the selfsame mark, I shape me—

      Roses are Red,  The sky is Blue,  Life is so Magical,  When I'm with You!"  ------------------------------------------  Somewhere someone dreams of your smile,  and when dreaming of you says life is worth while,  So when you are lonely, remember its true, someone somewhere is thinking of you!  -------------------------------------------------------------------  Roses are red, Like the blood thru my heart,  Love is forever, And it never shall part, Violets are blue, Like the rippling sea,  And nothing will come, Between you and me!"  ------------------------------------------------  Roses are red,  How can I be blue?,  When our love,  Makes every day a fantasy come true!"  -----------------------------------------------  Roses are Red,  Violets are Blue,  What can I say,  I'm in love with You,  So take my Hand,  And come with Me,  So hopefully we'll Be, For Eternity!"

      Roses are red, Lillies are white, Your in my thoughts both day and night, I love you so much with  all of my heart, And hate it when we are apart, You are my life, my hope, my love, And I'll never  stop loving you enough, I'm crazy about you and love you so dear, Throughout everyday of the year

      I'm thinking of you!  As I head toward the horizon .... And look off into the distance, I feel the warmth of your love ... and know that you hold my heart so tenderly in your hands.  Just your very existence ... makes me want to be with you, And I see off in the distance ... A sky of Rose colored Blue.  As the new day begins .... and the sun rises ever so slow. God changes the dark blue sky .... Into a Rose colored rainbow.  And as my mind wanders a bit .. I begin to think of what makes me happy, My mind is filled with thoughts of you ... As I gaze at a sky ... full of Rose colored Blue.  And as I dream of our time together ... Trying to figure out what we will do. If and when the day comes upon us ... When we finally say ... "I love you" ...  You hold my heart so softly ... And I cherish the thoughts of you. Thoughts that are so evident ... Caused ... by a sky of "Rose colored Blue"

      ReAd De Odd NuMbErs EvErYOne  HuNNiE...ThIs iS For U...^-^ read the odd numbers   1 “The great love that I have for you  2 is gone, and I find my dislike for you  3 grows everyday. When I see you,  4 I do not even like your face;  5 the one thing that I want to do is to  6 look at other girls. I never wanted to   7 marry you. Our last conversation  8 was very boring and has not  9 made me look forward to seeing you again.  10 You think only of yourself.  11 If we were married, I know that I would find  12 life very difficult, and I would have no  13 pleasure in living with you. I have a heart  14 to give, but it is not something that   15 I want to give you. No one is more  16 foolish and selfish than you, and you are not  17 able to care for me and help me.  18 I sincerely want you to understand that  19 I speak the truth. You will do me a favor  20 if you think this is the end. Do not try   21 to answer this. Your letters are full of  22 things that do not interest me. You have no  23 true love for me. Good-bye! Believe me,  24 I do not care for you. Please do not think that  25 I will love u forever and with all my heart...
