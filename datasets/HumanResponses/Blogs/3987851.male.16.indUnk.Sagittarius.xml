      Well, today is another day in my sorry life. I mean today I did nothing, I woke up at around 2:00 PM (hey I go to bed at like 5,&nbsp; give me a break) I pissed around on the Internet, downloading ROM's and whatnot. I have decided to re-live my entire childhood by playing the games that are near and dear to me. Games such as:   - Donkey Kong 3  - Mike Tyson's Punch Out  - WWF RAW  - Teenage Munant Ninja Turtles  - Chip And Dales: Rescue Rangers   And I have been doing that for the last week or 2. So where was I? Oh yeah, I was describing my day. :-) after a hour I decided to give up on Roger Clemens MVP Baseball, and do my chores, simple things like doing the dishes and cleaning my room, and after that shitty deal (most of the fucking knifes had peanut butter on it) it was almost 4:30. So I went back on the internet, and set up my profile for HotOtNot.com ( urlLink http://www.hotornot.com/r/?eid=OUNYSLB&amp;key=MUC , go rate my 10 like 50 times. You can expect some more SEXY PICTURES after a while bab-ee) and after that. well I wanted to watch The Simpsons, but my dipsh*t brother decided that we wanted to be gay, or play XIII I forget. So I decided to piss around some more on the internet (I know, what a exciting lifestyle I live)&nbsp;Then out of the blue my good friend Will (Killing Mac to the like, 50 people who know him as that) Decided to give me a ring and we decided on the 24th we were going to the Klondike Days Parade. So I get to do something fun this week, yay.   Well that is not all true, On Sunday I went to the small city of Red Deer to visit my relatives, and go to the birthday party of my cousins 1 year old kid. All in all it was pretty fun, as I got to talk wrestling an play some baseball with my cousin, Brandon. I had some of the greatest burgers you would of ever tasted. My mom however, did not have such a great time, as she thought that her sister completely ignored her. (she has her own opinion I guess), and we traveled back up to Edmonton to enjoy another day of Thunderstorms, which brings me to...   The weather here has been the sh*ts over the last couple weeks, Houses flooded, and our own mall even flooded, causing me to think if we are ready for bad storms? I mean for the Tornado in 1987 the city had no preparation for it, and&nbsp; last week the city was getting flooded, and our braintrust can not hande the situation. I am just lucky that I went to the Waterpark when I did (the day after I went there, the changeroom was flooded with Raw Sewage)   Now to talk about Wrestling, and since I do not have cable I have to rely on Internet reporters like Scott Keith and the people over at the EWB message-board for my info. And it seems like RAW is still going on the right direction with our loard and&nbsp; savior as the world champion. Batista and Randy Orton are improving to levels where they deserve their push. But even with the good is the bad, such as the use of Matt Hardy, being a pussy-whipped bitch, Tyson Tomko as a whole, and Kane wanting to be a daddy, but still it is 1000 times better then the shit Smackdown has been throwing. Because if you have not heard the news, the Smackdown shows have been drawing under 1000 people to see the houseshows, and just to dig a little deeper, who are the 2 people headlining the house shows? Why it is Bradshaw and The Undertaker. I think if the attendance levels are hitting record lows, then maybe McMahon and family will take a hint at changing who is the main focus of the show? But maybe that is why I don't run a promotion. However Smackdown has a few bright spots on it, most notably the new Tag Team champions in Paul London and Billy Kidman, also there is the Angle/Guerrero feud which we all know can give us the goods in the ring, the cruiser division also seems to be getting a solid push when there are 2 cruiser matches. But the negatives FAR outweight the positives, because what do we have stinking up Smackdown?   -Kenzo Suzuki  -"Mr. Fuckup" John Hidenright  - Bradshaw and Underseller stinking up the ring  -John Cena's poop humor  -Booker T and RVD being underused BADLY   But on a happy note, I will close by listing what I will be up to for my next update:   -Aspect on life  -Review of "The Best Of Will Ferrel"  -wrestling wind up  -Jeremy Facts   So for this week here are the:  Song Of The Week: "Teenage Dirtbag" By Wheatus Match Of The Week: HHH Vs Chris Benoit Vs Shawn Michaels (WWE Backlash 2004)  Remember folks, there is no money like C-Money.

      This is just a little bitty post, basicly to congradulate the Canadian teams and singles people reagardless to the events, you may only have 1 medal thus far, but you have represented the country proud, espically the following:  - Team Canada baseball: We have been kicking some serious ass in this, a 8-1 win over China, and 7-3 win over Italy and just yesterday a 7-0 win over then Netherlands, where we pitched a 3 hitter in front of almost 900 fans.  - Womens Sync Diving (10M): Our first medal thus far, and you girls did amazing, hitting very difficult dives (3.4 and 3.2) and just caught a bad break on your final dive, but a broze is good as gold. :-)  - Mens Swimming (4 Man 200 M relay): While you may of cane in 5th (which is amazing since you were in a race with the USA Josh Phelps and Austrailia's Ian Thorpe. You did awesome, plus it was a new Canadian record, you don't feel down. hopefully tomorrow I will review something (I have not made up my mind, it will be a surprise to all my fans)  and remember, there is no money like C Money.

         American Dad is the new show created by Family Guy creator/actor Seth McFarlene, and while I don't think it is a good as Family Guy (but then again, what can be?) but I think this show will be nice to watch until Family Guy gets back on the air. The 2 characters that I really enjoyed were:  Klaus: He is a Goldfish with the mind of a German, while it was pretty funny, I don't think he can live up to Brian Griffin, who without a doubt was the coolest Cartoon animal ever. Klauses main angle is that he is in love with the wife of the family. (pretty much like Brian loved Lois) Stan: Stan is the main character of the show, and he works for the CIA and he is extremly parinoid. Going so far as doing metal checks for his own kids when they are entering the house, and going apeshit on a toaster. And Family Guy fans will almost instantly notice what character he sounds like.  Overall it seems like a nice Sunday night show (It is planned to debut on Fox in January of 2005 on Sunday at 9:30) and with that time it will complement The Simpsons very well, but once Family Guy comes back I hope it will get a solid 7:00 time slot on Sundays. Because it will start off Fox's awesome Sunday nights and plus look at this mineup we can all love:  -American Dad -King Of The Hill -The Simpsons -Family Guy -Malcom In The Middle  Pure gold for a few hours :-). You can download the pilot (6 Minute Sample) at the website  urlLink http://www.american-dad.com/ , and people say that I hape everything :-p  and do not forget, there is no money like C-Money.

      So I am a little late, sue me :-p  IWA King Of The Deathmatch Day 1 So here we are with IWA:MS’s annual tournament King Of The Deathmatch. Where some of the most hardcore (and to some people stupid) wrestlers come to see who is the best at their style of wrestling, and what we get is 2 days of hardcore wrestling, with some great wrestling thrown in to it. This Deathmatch Tourney looks great with people like Balls Mahoney, Ian and Axl Rotten, Necro Butcher, JC Bailey, Corp Robinson, and others. So here is the review:  - We start with a nice little video announcing the participants in the King Of The Deathmatch, nothing fancy, but who expected it to be?  - Ian rotten comes out and puts over the show. But at the beginning of this tape the sound is very poor so I can’t really hear what he is saying. He also pimps a Chris Hero Vs Homicide match and he says that this match will tear down the house. (which I don’t doubt) Also there is a Jerry Lynn Vs "Mr. Huss" Jimmy Jacobs, which will rule since I am a big fan of both. And warns the fans that this is a Deathmatch "If you see a lightube coming, grab your seats and get the fuck out of the way". And he talks some more but I CAN’T HEAR WHAT HE IS SAYING, but I do hear him swearing a lot, and telling the people to buy some T-Shirts. And he decides to argue with the fans, just because he thinks he is cool, but fails horribly. (Kind of like my brother) Well thats about 10 minutes of tape well wasted.  Dave Prazak and Steve Stone are on commentary   Singles Match: Jimmy Jacobs Vs Jerry Lynn  Now a little background on Jimmy Jacobs. He thinks he is 7 feet tall, and is the second coming of the Bezerker, so he does the stuff like trying to go over the top ropes. (he is only like 5 foot 4) does the HUSS thing, wears fuzzy boots, and big boots people, really cool. Jerry Lynn gets praised by the announcers, and he gets a good reaction. Boot into a headlock, shoulder block by Jacobs, and they do the basic cruiser stuff, and a lot of it I learned in my time as a wrestler. ;-) Lynn works the headlock, Jacobs backs Lynn into the ropes and a clean break lead to a forearms from Jacobs. Lynn hits a crossbody, Jacobs misses a senton splash, and a arm-drag sends Jacobs out of the ring, chase outside of the ring, Jacobs gets back in, but Lynn reverses a baseball slide into a facebuster in the apron, and gets a 2 count inside the ring. Jacobs tosses Lynn outside the ring, and uses CLUBBING BLOWS to the back. Tosses him back in and hits a Russian legsweep for 2, starts HUSSING UP~! But Lynn hits a screaming swinging backbreaker. Jacobs hits a wrist clutch backbreaker, and hits the full nelson on Lynn. And more CLUBBING BLOWS for 2. And then we get the knee to the back submission. , but Lynn reverses into a Oklahoma Roll. But a sunset flip into a HUSSING CAMEL CLUTCH. Lynn fights out and rams Jacobs into the turnbuckle, tries for a Rana’ but Lynn hits a spinning sitout powerbomb. More brawling from the the men, but screaming backdrop send Lynn down, Lynn hits the TKO for 2. Lynn sets up for the Cradle Piledriver, but Jacobs reverse’s it into a reverse pedigree. Jacobs up to the top and Tries for the senton splash, but Lynn gets the knees up, Lynn tries for a suplex, but Jacobs reverses it into a Hair STO, BIG MOTHERFUCKING BOOT for 2? Lynn reverses the Suicide Solution (Sliced Bread #2) into a Cradle Tombstone for the duce.  Winner:  Jerry Lynn at 10:06  Match Rating:  ***1/4   Women's Match:   Hailey Vs Mickie Knuckles  The crowd, ever so nice chants "Your a Crackwhore" at Hailey. This is also the In-Ring debut of Mickie, she also works as IWA’s referee. Mickie takes forever for her intro, making sure that she slaps hands with EVERYBODY in the arena. They start with a tie-up and starts off with a headlock, and Hailey goes into a corner, for a clean break. Another tie-up, and a clean break leads into a slap from Hailey. Another tie-up into another headlock, into a shoulderblock, and then a...thing, I think it was a armdrag, then hits a backslide for 1. Hailey rolls out of the ring, and it has been 3 minutes and nothing has happened. Snapmare to Mickie back into the ring, and a kick to the back, then a backbreaker for 2. As the announcers have nothing better to talk about, so they plug the wrestling school ;-) a kick to the face from Hailey, more kicks to the back of Mickie, and a northern lights suplex wakes up the crowd and the announcers. Then they said "fuck this" and decide to forearm the shit out of each other and Hailie KILLS mickie with a running forearm, and she kicks out? And a Suplex by Hailey is reversed into a rollup and Mickie wins. After the match Hailie, decides to kill Mickie as she botches a powerbomb onto chairs, and drops her head first onto the corner of the chair, as Chris Hero and Ian Rotten come out to check on Mickie, who may or may not be dead. And the crowd chants "She’s Hardcore" as she leaves the ring with Ian Rotten being proud.  Winner:  Mickie Knuckles at 5:41  My Rating:  DUD, I said * and my Bro said -* so we get a DUD, but ONLY for the sickest forearm ever seen in wrestling.  - The announcer guy decides to introduce the participants in the KOTDM and here they are: - 2 Tuff Tony - Axl Rotten - Dysfunction - Nick Motherfucking Gage (My original pick) - Horace The Physchopath - Corporal Robinson - Balls Mahoney - "Mr. Insanity" Toby Klien - Mad Man Pondo - Rollen Hard - "Spyder" Nate Webb - The Messiah - Ian Rotten - JC Bailey - "Mean" Mitch Page - Necro Butcher (Andrews Pick) And then they take forever, to pose for a picture, as some people act serious, and some people decide to do stupid poses.   Hardcore Tables Match: Madman Pondo Vs "Spyder" Nate Webb w/ Becky Bayless  The rules for this is that you have to pin the person, but you have to put him though a table before you are allowed to pin him. Mad Man Pondo wastes time by talking on the mic, and then Nate Webb has the best into in Indy wrestling, he does everything, runs around, dances, throws balloons, steals the camera and has 2 theme songs, this guy is the man of everything. He even does a jig with JERRY LYNN, now how cool is that? They start off with a dance off, but Mad Man Pondo dance involves a clothesline into a disco. Pondo tosses Webb into the ropes and hits a clothesline for 2. Webb gets up and uses the lightubes on Pondo the control him, but Pondo reverses a crossbody dive into a lightube shot to the head, and then carves the head of Webb with a broken lightube, and he heads for the table, and he seems to be having a problem setting it up, as he already looks blown up 2 minutes in. A sloppy DDT of the floor by Webb, and he places Pondo on the table, and heads up to the spiders nest (A ledge about 10 feet high) and hits him with a double foot stomp "through" the table gets 2. Webb grabs a couple more tables, and sets it up around the spiders nest, as Pondo is back into the ring and meets webs with a couple with forearms. And uses his stop sign Shane O’ Mac style, but forgets that he didn’t put Webb through the table to pin him. Pondo reverses the sunset flip into a stop sign shop, and then places Webb in the Tree of Woe, and then places the lightubes around the face of Webb then talks to the crowd for a while before hitting the stop sign with a chair, smashing about 8 tubes in Webbs face. Webb then gets up and hits a spinning wheel kick into the face of Pondo, with the sign in front of him, and they go outsides and Webb dumps Pondo on the tables, and decides to climb about 30 feet in the air and hits the BIGGEST SPLASH IN THE HISTORY OF WRESTLING. In the words of Dave Prazak "HO-LEE FUUUUCK". But for no reason Lollypop from TNA fame, decides to attack Becky Bayless, and Webb gets in the way. Always a bad idea for a face. Webb rolls Pondo into the ring, and only gets a 2 count, since Webb wasted about a minutes on Lolly and Becky. Webb goes outside and grabs a table, and sets it back into the ring, and the ref sets up a short ladder. Nate places Pondo on the table, grabs a bunch of lightubes, and tries to sale the ladder, but the Ladder was gay, so Webb climbed to the top rope and did the Lightube-Sault, but Pondo got the knees up, and Pondo places three tubes on the table and places Webb on the top rope and PILEDRIVES HIM OFF THE TOP ROPE THROUGH THE TABLE. And Pondo pins him for the duce  Winner:  Mad Man Pondo at 16:46  Match Rating:  ****, it was a super hot opening deathmatch, with a bunch of sick spots. And remember I am not rating these matches on wrestling, but great spots, since this is a Deathmatch tourney. ;-)   Glass Hands Match: "Mean" Mitch Page Vs Rollen Hard  This match has simple rules, Win the match, but there is a twist. The people have their hands glued and they dip their hands in broken glass. Mitch Page decides to waste time, by eating the bible. Yes, He EAT’S THE BIBLE. It is two fat guys fighting, I think we know how much wrestling is going to be in this one. :-) Both of the wrestler throw their dukes but they both miss their punches. They decides to "Wrestle" but Page decides to kick Hard in the gut. And hits some right hands that bust Hard open already. Page then grinds the glass into the face of Hard and a fan tosses him a toolbox and clonked Hard in the head. And he finds a stable gun, and both wrestlers are gasses 3 minutes, in so they just ram their heads into the turnbuckles. Hard grabs the stable gun, and then Stables pages of the bible to the forehead of Page. And Page retaliates buy stapling the pages to the cheek of Hard, and some more punches outside, and Page grabs a lightube wand, and taps him with it, and it breaks. Then he grabs the HARDCORE Toilet Seat, but Hard reverses it into a shot of his own, and then Page grabs a jar of pickles, but both of them do boring brawling, until Page misses the pickle shot and it spatters everywhere, then then becomes my hero by squeezing the pickle juice into the open wound of Hard. Back in the ring Hard shoves a pickle down Pages pants, and they do more brawling, and Page goes ass first into the lightubes, and showers the first row with that pleasant lightube stuff. Charge by hard, and he does some more stomps, and punches with the hand with only like 1 piece of glass remaining, and outside they go again. Page grabs something and rams it into the face of Hard, Page grabs a toolbox, but Hard grabs it and hits Page over the head. Hard rolls Page back into the ring, and grabs rubbing alcohol, and lights his hand on fire and Punches Page with a karate chop! That was pretty cool, and Jim Fannin (Pages manager) gets in the way and breaks up the pin. Page gets up and hits him with a mil bottle and hits a heart punch that takes Hard down. More boring brawling from Page, and he kills the referee with a avalanche. Sidewalk slam onto Page by Hard, but there is no ref. And Hard is going up to the top, but Fannin grabs Hards leg, and like a IDIOT, Hard goes after Fannin, but Fannin massed him, and a Rock Bottom finishes him for the win.  Winner:  Mean Mitch Page at 12:52  Rating:  **1/2 Sometimes it could be a good pased match, with some sick parts, but the boring brawling really killed it for me.   Barbed Wire Board Match: Horace The Psychopath Vs Balls Mahoney  Balls has really slimmed down since his ECW days, he looks like he is down to 280, where he used to be around 340 or so. Handshake starts out, and there is a Horace chant. Some Brawling from both of them and Balls does his "Ballz Punches" and Horace outside uses the barbed wire bat to the face of Balls, which buts him open about a minute in. Horace with a knee for 2, and they do some more brawling, and Horace keeps headbutting Balls until he galls on the wire, then Horace misses a flip senton onto the wire. And Balls grabs the wire and gives Horace a couple wacks to the head, then Balls grabs a table, but it has a broken leg. Balls bites Horace's head as a Balls chant breaks out. And then hits Horace with a chair to the back, and Balls sets the table up in the corner, and Horace decides to throw himself into a poll a few times. Balls rolls Horace into the ring, and does his Ballz Punches, but modifies it with a poke to the eyes. And he puts tubes on the table in the corner, but it gets turned on him as Horace whips Balls into it, and hits a double foot stomp onto the table and Horace gets 2. Horace puts him in a chickenwing, and grabs the barbed wire board and tosses it one Balls. Horace then grabs the wire and rakes it in the eyes as a "Fuck em up Horace" chant breaks out. And some more headbuts and it does not phase Balls, until like the 20th one. And Balls puts Horace on a chair to give him a seat, and then Horace gets a face full of wire for a 2 count, and a kick to tha junk from Balls, and then he goes Tajiri style and kicks him in the head for 2. Balls tosses Horace back in the ring, and Balls hits a superkick (pretty sloppy) for 2. And Then Balls misses a top rope Legdrop and lands ass first on the wire, DDT from Horace gets 2. Horace wanders outside and grabs a barbed wire table, but Balls cuts him off before he can do anything, and Balls grabs a normal table and sets it up outside, and Horace hits 3 brutal chair shots on Balls for 2. They go outside and Horace puts Balls on the table, and Horace goes to the top, but Balls crotched him on the top, and Balls looks like he is going for the nutcracker suite through a table, but Horace falls off and then some more brawling on the apron, and then balls hits a chair shot and Horace falls onto the table, and then Balls elbows him through the table for the win. And after Balls leaves a "Thank You Horace" chant breaks out. aww.  Winner:  Balls Mahoney  My Rating:  ***1/2, This was a very good match, because it was not just weapon shots, there actually was some good wrestling, and Balls shows he can still bring it, even though the ending was botches. And Horace is money for sure. And I lost my watch so I can’t give bell times until I find it ;-) This was about 10 minutes though.  - A update on my watch, it was under my bed. =-o   Lightube Style Deathmatch 2 Tuff Tony Vs JC Bailey  Micky is back as the referee for this match, and I am surprised that she is still alive. JC Bailey looks like he is 140 lbs, but man can he wrestle, plus he can take a lot of pain, he can either be the next great Jr. Worker, or he can be the next great Deathmatch worker, it is up to him. Tony and Bailey sets up the tables in the corners. As they stall for about a minute or so. Tieup to start and nobody gets the advantage. Another tieup, an Tony with a kick to the gut, then some forearms, and Bailey goes to the outside, back in, Tony hits a atomic drop to Bailey, and Bailey almost goes into the barbed wire, then Bailey almost tiger suplexes Tony into the wire, then Tony hits a clothesline for 2 and he sets up the barbed wire table outside the ring. And so far this match is the 2nd fastest pace. Tony grabs the thumbtack bat and misses 2 shots, then Bailey picks up the back and hits 2 shots to the head and one to the gut. Bailey then hits a suicide dive and spears Tony through the barbed with table, and Tony is busted open, and in a SICK spot, Baileys hand is stuck to the barbed wire, OW. Bailey then grabs a few chairs and sets it up as a table, and Tony rolls back into the ring. it looks like there are 30 chairs there, and Bailey gets press slammed through all of them as a "Holy Shit" chant breaks out. Jawbreaker to Bailey, and then Tony sticks the thumbtack bats into the pants of Bailey and then does a somersault legdrop to the back of Bailey, and it shreds his back up, and picks him up after the 2 count. Tony then gets the electrified lightubes and looks to do something, but Bailey low blows him, and Bailey with a right and then Tony hits a facebuster onto the tubes which KILLS bailey. And once again Tony picks Bailey up after 2. Tony then grabs the barbed wire table and gets it up in the corner, then Bailey eats a boot from Tony, as Bailey was picking glass out of his stomach. Tony with a kick to the gut of Bailey, and Bailey’s stomach is bleeding badly. 2 Tuff Tony then hits a TO TUFF DRIVER THROUGH THE BARBED WIRE TABLE (the 2 Tuff Driver is a reverse tombstone, and it is very dangerous) Tony then rolls JC back into the ring and Bailey is dead. Tony taunts for another 2 Tuff Driver, and then hits a forearm across the back of Bailey. And then hits a backrake. And he looks to hit a 2 Tuff Driver off the ropes , but Bailey hits a sunset flip through the lightubes to win the match.  Winner:  JC Bailey at 13:23  Rating:  ***3/4 Bailey took a HUGE ass-kicking from Tony, and he still came through. My only gripe is that Bailey only got like 2 moves done to him, and he lost, it does not make him look very strong, especially after losing to somebody half his size.  - And we are now halfway through the first round of the King Of The Death Match.   Non-Tournament Match: Sonjay Dutt Vs Alex Shelly  We all know and love Sonjay Dutt, but we might not know Alex Shelly. He works for IWA, RoH and now NWA:TNA as "Baby Bear" Shelly. And he is a super good talent. And this should be a hell of a match. Dutt gets on the microphone and talks about something, but since I can not hear him I can’t tell. He does swear a lot so take that as something. They start out working over the wrist lock, and they do the normal Cruser/Tech stuff, one cool stop was reversing the arm bar into a drop toe hold then a STF. Wristlock into hammer lock, into a Boston Crab from Shelly, pretty cool stuff. More tech wrestling, (Armbar into hammer lock into headlock into a drop toe hold by Dutt) Shelly puts Dutt into a rolling full nelson which was really cool. But Dutt reverses it into a waistlock, then puts him in a headlock, then hits a headlock takeover for 2. Full Nelson from Dutt is reversed into a bridge by Shelly for 2. And a "Shelly" chant breaks out. Hammerlock by Dutt is reversed into a headlock by Shelly, and back into a armbar, Shelly hits a kip up armdrag, then another arm drag and hits the armbar again, shoulder block by Shelly and then they both stiff each other, Shelly hits a face buster and a big boot for 2. Forearms by Shelly, and Dutt reverses a back drop, but Shelly reverses that into a snap suplex for 2. And Shelly tosses Dutt in the corner, but Dutt goes up and hits a missile dropkick for 2. Facewash by Dutt, and then a snapmare into a sitting abdominal stretch. Clothesline by Dutt gets 2. Shelly hits some chops on Dutt, and hits a DDT for 2. Dutt pins Shelly for 2. Dutt starts chopping Shelly in the corner. Dutt hits a corner clothesline, then hits some stiff corner elbows, and then a top tope Rana, and he goes up again and hits the Swandive Headbutt for 2. Dutt misses a clothesline, and Shelly hits a springboard Elbow, then bits a stiff forearm in the corner. Dutt then hits his Knee, neckbraker combo for 2. Shelly hits a swinging sitout neckbraker for 2. And Shelly starts chopping him some more. Dutt then hits a tiltawhirl DDT, and goes up, and misses a moonsault and lands on his feet. And then Shelly hits a fisherman's DDT for the win. After the match, the CZW guys attack Shelly until Jimmy Jacobs come in for the save, and talks some smack HUSS HUSS HUSS HUSS   Winner  : Alex Shelly at about 12 minutes  Rating:  **** Some great wrestling there, this is like the coolest show ever, with some great matches and some great brawls.   Corporal Robinson Vs Axl Rotten  I don’t know what kind of match this is, but Axl Rotten has a broken hand so you can assume it will be short. Axl comes out with a barbed wire 2X4. Corp talks on the mic for a little bit, but I can’t understand so I don’t care :-p. Corp starts off with some punches to Axl and uses the barbed wire Kendo Stick to the back of Ian, and then grates the barbed wire 2X4 across the head of Axl, and Axl is busted open 50 seconds in, Axl hits Corp with something, and then grabs Scissors, and he cuts Corp open with them and then they go fighting among the crowd, and Axl sends Corp into the door, Axl then grabs some tubes wrapped in wire and smashes it across the back or Corp. Axl with some forearms, but Corp reverses it with a shot with the tubes, and then uses the thumbtack back to Axl. Axl then gets whipped into the lightube star, and the barbed wire is sticking to Axl’s arm. Corp throws the chair into the ring, and Axl is still outside and you can tell he is sucking wind 5 minutes in. The Messiah, takes Corps shirt off and backdrops Corp into the tubes which was VERY sick, and Axl crawls into the ring and gets the win.   Winner:  Axl Rotten at 6:02  Rating:  ** It was a pretty meh match, with nothing amazing except the final spot which looked very painful.   4 Corners of Pain Match: Nick Gage Vs Dysfunction  Brawling on the outside starts the match, and Dysfunction gets whipped into the chairs, and Gage it’s Dysfunction with a chair. Gage rolls him back into the ring and sets up the chair, and does the Raven drop toehold onto the chair, and then hits a huge chair shot to Dysfunction. Gage then hits a facebuster onto the concrete floor, which I liked. Gage then sets up a chair again, and then he goes to the top but get the Ric Flair toss off the tope. But instead it was to the floor, and it was through a barbed with board and chairs. Dysfunction then hits a Chair Leg Drop ala Sabu, and then he grabs some lightubes, but Gage grabs them and attacks him with it, then carves the hand of Dysfunction, then sets him down and runs to the ropes and KICKS HIS FUCKING HEAD UP. Gage then grabs a huge Light tube waffle, and he tears his shirt off, and puts him to the top rope, and he hits a superplex through like 50 lightubes.
