      Take time to think about what needs thought about. Thats what I tell myself, though I don't know what I need to think about. Whatever comes to mind, but right now I am in a really relaxed mood ya know. I feel so good, incredible, everything is great. I just listened to my hour + rave mix, its so relaxing. The first few songs are really intense, then in the middle it softens up and relaxes you, and the end is very happy and uplifting while still relaxing. Now I just wish I had more music to listen to. Yea if I had anything else to say I'd say it but I don't so ya know I'm gonna go.  I'm Lovin' this Later, -HAZE-

      Sup People? You ever have a song in your head but have no clue what it is called? I'm having that righ now, LOL, I know I have this song on one of my cds ( I Have like 40+ mix cds, and like 10 mp3 cds that have 100+ songs) and I really want to hear it but cant think of which cd has it, nor the name, title or anything...its just there in my head. LOL, anyway I just got back from driving my mom to the grocery store which was pretty interesting considering I can't park at all....man I almost hit a truck, was like 3 inches from it...LOL...  Anyway I got up this morning and looked at the newspaper and saw we are supposed to get up to 8 inches of snow tonight and even more tomorrow night into Tuesday!! Man I'm gettin tired of this, but if I get off school Tuesday it'd be cool (I already have off Monday).  My dad just got a George Forman Mean Lean Grilling Machine or whatever, and that thing makes the absolute WORST hamburgers in the world...they are so flat and dry, and when I make the same hamburger in the microwave it taste sooo much better (Yes you can make hamburgers in the microwave...LOL I just found that out like 2 weeks ago.)  Well I'm gonna go, Later, -HAZE-

      well I decided not to format my computer yet b/c I don't have the CD to install my ISP and I can't go without internet ;) Its really late / early but I'm trying to stay up untill 3 so I can record one of my favorite movies of all time "Groove" its a movie about a Rave, and it's really cool. Its coming on IFC (Direct TV channel 550). It's also a movie you can add to "watch when I'm bored" list. A really good one, especially if your interested in seeing what goes on at a LA Rave without going to one.  Goodnight, -HAZE-

      Man it's cold as f*ck right now...I'm just sittin here chillin, just got done watchin Mad TV, that stuff was pretty funny. So Whats up? Not much went on today, I was sittin around doin what I always do, and was waitin on my Cuz to call so I could go there and hang out, but he didn't..so I'm just here bored and sh*t. I watched this movie "Back On The Bus" today, it was a GREAT movie! It was about these people on a bus on their way to the Million Man March, it was great, it had some real good lessons in it and it was funny and everything. If your sittin around with nothin to do you should watch that movie, its cool. I been thinkin on what I sould spend my money on right now, and I think I'm gonna pick up "99 Ways to Die" by Master P to add to my collection. Right now I have:  Ice Cream Man Only God Can Judge Me Ghetto Postage Game Face and 504 Boyz- Ballers  so I got a couple to go + his new one "Good Side, Bad Side" to complete my collection, but its cool. I cant find nothin to do, so I'm gonna go find somethin.  Later, -HAZE-

      Sup? I had a pretty good "trip" more of a speed high yesterday. Now I'm just really tired, worn out. Man we got more snow!! I'm so tired of it LOL. We got a good 4 or 5 inches and its still coming down. I might go snowboard later on my little $1 snowboard, LOL. I'm listening to Nas- Book of Rhymes. That is one of my favorite songs of all time! It's great. In my opinion Nas is better than Jay Z, because he speaks real sh*t, and he doesn't have any pop songs like Jay Z has "Change Clothes" and "Excuse me miss" and "h to the izzo". Nas's music is just gangsta, and mostly the truth. Agree or disagree, but Nas is the king of New York.   Alright I'm gonna go let these songs download. Later, -HAZE-

      Man I'm on a nice f*ckin robo trip right now, feeling good as hell listening to some trance right now....Im about to slip out of my mind into the lovlyness of the second world which I love soo much, I feel great and disconnected from the world, where I can write the most bueatiful poetry, think the most beuatiful things while thinking nothing at all, It's just amazing, thoughts racing but no organization to realize those thoughts, tho they come out in writing without thinking.  Lovely I love ya all Later --HAZE--

      Well I had a very good day at school today. First off we had a two hour delay so I got extra sleep, and the day went very fast and I really didn't have anything to do all day. I'm hoping the roads ice up again and we have another delay tomorrow ;). You know whats weird? I went on e-bay today looking for a NES and found them to be priced around $50 and up!!! Thats crazy, I wish our old one didn't break. Right now I'm stuck playing computer roms, but I'd like to have the actual system again someday. Ya know what really pisses me off? When people take their cell phones out for no reason other than to say "Hey look I got a cell phone!!!" Today on my bus this girl pulls hers out and just stares at it the whole bus ride pushing random buttons, Maybe she was playing a game? well I dont think so, b/c shed push a button, wait a bit push another...and she was also popping her gum like every 10 seconds really loudly and it really made me wanna just yell at her, but I'm a shy person so I just cranked the volume up on my cd player. But I just cant stand people who try to show off their cell phones. This kid in my first period class will flip his cover up and down the whole class, I don't know why, but its freakin stupid. Same goes with people (like My sister) today who pulled her $2 of lunch money out in her hand for no reason other than to flash it around at people like shes rich.......and people who pull out their wallet and count money in front of you.....I mean if I had like $1,000 I'd flash it a bit, but not 2, 5, or $10, I mean come on!!!!       Well Thats my 2 cents for today.         Later,        -Haze-        a.k.a. Jon!  (BTW I'm normally grounded during weekdays from the internet so you won't see my blog updated too much during the week. Today I happen to be working on something so I can get on ;) )

      Not doing very much right now. It snowed alittle bit more today so I might try to go out and snowboard again tonight. It wont be as good as last night because it was warm enough to turn last nights snow to slush, and its just a wet sloppy mess, but maybe it will freeze over. It will be alittle painfull if I wreck though ;)

      well I'm about to go to bed, well listen to Love Line for an hour or so and then go to bed. um, cant think of much else to say really. You know what I hate, people who don't share files on WinMX....they just don't get it, your not going to get anything if you dont share. I have a block list of over 100 people who share 0 files and it gets bigger everyday, so I really hope you aren't one of those greedy people, or you get none of my files!   Later, -Haze-

      Hey waz up? This is me, yea.... Well I had a really busy day today, my dad wanted to tear this room out that used to be part of our garage, so his garage would be big again....Went from like 9:30 AM to 4PM, I'm really tired, but o well. Anyway I got to hit you with this Link to one of the hottest underground artists there is:  urlLink FoKissed  (Pronounced Focoused) His music is AWESOME...I guess if you can compare his style to Eminem's but he is definately bringing alot of uniqueness to the table. Check him out! You gotta hear this guy too,  urlLink 5150    So not much goin on tonight, Im about to fall asleep just sittin here....Later Im probly gonna try to jump out my window and smoke a bowl in this alluminum foil pipe I made....I really wanted to do it during the day so I could see, but I guess I'll do it blind, and hope I dont spill anything and lose sh*t...and I gotta hope no one comes in my room when Im out there and they realize Im not here, ya know. Then I guess I'm gonna try to write some more tonight...  Anyway, gotta go. Keep it Real -HaZe-

      Hey whats up? been awhile, once again... Well awhile ago I just wrote 2 songs to go on my "Album" Raw Material. So far this is what is done:  "If I was a Thug" --Written "If you only knew" --Written  I am going to try to record those soon, and work on writing more. I plan to write anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, it all depends on how creative I'm feeling. Then hopefully I will have it all recorded by atleast late May to mid-June. Then hopefully I will mix it all and have it by June, if all goes good. I want to get a verse or so from my cousin, and a few from a friend of mine.  So hopefully I will have that all done, and by this Summer have a few if not all the tracks up on my soundclick page.   so be lookin out for updates on my progress on here.  At the moment I am working on gathering more beats, and I'll probably write a few more verse later tonight, but I'm feelin really tired. Hopefully I can go to my cousin's house tomorrow and talk with him about recording something for my CD.   Anyway I can't think of anything else to say. Once again I would like to know if anyone out there is reading this, Throw me an E-mail: NLsouljah2005@aol.com.       Later,     -HAZE-

      Hey whats up? It's been a while hasn't it? Well not too much went on since the last time I posted. I've been working on a few of my webpages, and it is a pain in the a** ya know? I just want to do one simple thing, but it ends up I have to do like 30 other things for that 1 thing to work.....anyway... I feel like putting an advertisement for my favorite game of all time, Tibia! Its a online RPG (MMORPG) and its great. I'll put a link to some screenshots later if I remember, but for now go to :  urlLink Tibia.com  to get information, YOU CANT give up the oppurtunity to check out this GREAT, FREE game!!!

      Hey sup? not very much here, I rented Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne, and got to Part One: Chapter 6, and I have to say the game is the best game I ever played in my life, better than Halo. The story keeps you on the edge, and you want to play more and more to find out what will happen next, the action is intense but the adjusting difficulty keeps the gameplay managble. If you haven't played this yet, you MUST rent it! It would be good to play through the first one first though because it will help you get used to the gameplay and the strategies to do good, BUT Max Payne 2 has a feature that will summarize the first game's plot to set you up for the second part.  Anyway I'm pretty tired right now....listening to Nirvana- The Man Who Sold the World (Unplugged) which is a pretty cool song. I think tonight I'm going to play Delta Force: Land Warrior abit......I wish I had some mountain Dew or something, LOL I need the caffiene, I had a loooong week and really don't feel like going to bed so early.  Well c-ya, -haze-

      Hey Buddy, its been awhile.....okay I stole the "Hey Buddy" line from Adam Corolla on Love Line, my fav. Radio show, but o well......LOL, anyway its Friday the 13th, and I'm bored. I'm thinking of renting Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne, or Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge tonight. The original Max Payne was one of the best games I ever played, second only to Knights of the Old Republic. So that should occupy my time. Me and my dad (or if you are an English teacher: My dad and I) might go to a motorcycle show tomorrow in Maryland so that should be cool....  Anyway since last time I posted not much went on, I guess I had a few experiences with Vicodin, which was alright, and other then that I didn't do much. so for now I'm gonna go.  Later, -HAZE-

      Hey sup?  This is a song I wrote at 2 AM Friday.... It's pretty okay considering I haven't wrote anything in a long time... check it out:  Drugs enter my mind, and make me think I'm some other kind, so away from it all, nothing but glass to break my fall, though I stagger I stand up, scream out loud I don't give a fuck, untill my lungs bleed from the weed, then I pass out on the floor, but I'm always ready for more, If you cant see then you must be blind cuz I see some crazy shit all the time, Illness is all around and it seems to kill us, every last hope shattered, all the remains are scattered, Every question that has an answer brings us to nowhere faster.  Time works as death lurks aroound every corner, another mourner, all seems to pass as first becomes last, a clock ticks while a mind plays tricks, true love is nowhere, while hate prevails, another ship sinks and another sails, a neverending game has me singing songs in the rain, as a substance enters my brain. When will it all end, when can I stop playing pretend when will we all see that there isn't really much to see.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  There you go.... anyway, today I went to a local baseball game.. my two cousin's play on a team and I've been watching them play for a long time... its like a all age league so it gets some good action.... mostly age 17+ play.... Today they just won 9-2 to tie the series 1-1.... its the first series of the playoffs... whoever wins tomorrow goes on so it should be exciting... last year they made it to the championship series and lost..  anyway I also downloaded a few Pink Floyd songs, and a DJ Tiesto song... some pretty good music....  Well its almost 2 AM again so I guess I might go listen to music and go to bed..  Later, -Haze-
