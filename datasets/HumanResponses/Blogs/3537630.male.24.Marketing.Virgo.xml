      I am the x-factor in all cases related to me.  I drink gatorade just about every morning and this morning I as thinking about what the x-factor is and thast is what I came up with.  I just realized that I skipped yesterday's post.  For me being a man that usually has a lot to say, it is tough to post in here everyday.  Maybe because I don't think anyone is reading it and what I have to say I already know.  Wouldn't you agree?  I can always talk about my Around Campus job, which I didn't do much with yesterday other than have one meeting.  I was sort of busy in the office and I took an hour for lunhc and also an hour to start getting Carey moved into her new place, so she would have a little something to do for the day.  Nolan & Corey were a big help with that last night.  TJ's car broke down (I had to laugh for the poor guy, he knew it was coming) and he didn't make it.  My mom and dad rode up to get the tours of our places.  They also brought my new washer & dryer and took back some things I didn't need.  After the move and I returned my buddy's truck.  We had some pizza and then I crashed from 10 - 11:30.  Woke up ate a bowl of soup then went to bed.  Today will be a good day, i just have to get moving.  Unitl next time ... peace!

      I am going to try and post everyday excluding weekends, whether it be in the morning or late in the afternoon before I leave work.  I'm usually reminded when I look at my news websites and check Ed & Corks blogs at: http://bird33.blogspot.com & http://corkzilla.blogspot.com ... After that being said let me tell ya about what has been going on.  I have made two sales, one yesterday and one today, so the is what is referenced in the title of this blog two-for-two.  Also, I have a bunch of great leads and I see business picking up, hopefully, I will have sold $20,000 worth of ads by July 4th.  this may be a stretch and that may be my final goal for the summer, but we'll see.  Yesterday after the evening meeting I secured TJ, Nolan, and Corey to help me move Carey's things from storage to her new apartment.  Then, Carey & I made a trip to Wal-Mart, it has all your shopping needs, HA!  She made some pork chops for dinner that kicked ass and then the rest of the evening was a little Grand Theft Auto and some tv.    Today has been a good day and tonight we are going to go to Chic-N-Bones for dinner and some beers.  I'll probably end up watching the game somewhere or at least my apartment.  Outside of all that I know i will need to get some rest as tomorrow will be a long day.  My mom and dad are coming up to check out my new place and Carey's as well.  After we move ... there will be beer to drink.  -Noteworthy-  #9 Adam "PacMan" Jones of WVU football's team is getting kicked out of his apartment because he began living there before his lease started.

      Three hours into the day and most of what I have accomplished lies within the empty bottle of gatorade and that's about it.  Gatorade is my usual morning drink, sometimes it lasts until noon.  Maybe it is because I like to think I am active, but I really know I am lazy.  I have three meetings setup today for Around Campus.  I would imagine that at least two will produce a sale for me, let's keep our fingers crossed.  I had a slow, but much needed weekend.  Friday Carey & I hung out with Eddie & Samantha at their place.  They fired up the grill and we brought the brew-hahs.  Saturday was a very lazy day ... started it off with my favorite Saturday morning treat, egg sandwiches.  I would say I eat them on Saturday mornings about 40 times a year which is not a bad percentage.   Saturday night Carey & I just chilled at my place, watching the Belmont Stakes and a documentary on the history channel about President Reagan.  Then, I was teaching her a little about poker.  She likes to learn.  Sunday --> after taking care of my Special Olympics responsibilities in the morning, we went to Shinnston and had lunch at my parents house.  From there, we stopped by and saw my buddy Zach.  Ed, I had meant to stop and see you too, wanted to show you pics of Chicago, Wrigley Field in particular.  I'll catch ya next tiime through though.  After that stop we went to Flee's house in Adamsville, a usual Sunday stop to watch the Sopranos at 9.  I did some swingset maintenance and helped him pickup sticks for a fire that we started later that evening.  That about sums up the weekend, nothing great there, but life as usual and that is good enough for me.  Hopefully, in tomorrow's post you'll read about me making a sale.  It's MONDAY!!! wooo!

      Well, I was right that not much has been accomplished so far today and I think I will continue this pattern for the remainder of the day.  I didn't get to go and try to sell ads for the "MountainYear" at all, they'll be pleased I'm sure.  I have been on the job with them since May 20 and probably haven't even worked a total of 40 hours.  The special olympics are in Morgantown this weekend.  I had to put up sponsors signs for that after waiting until 11:00am for the meeting.  We realized that the festivities were starting earlier than expected, so we had to rush to get everything out.  I just got back from taking care of that stuff.  As for the rest of the day ...  I will be here in the office trying to keep myself busy.  I have a meeting at 5:30 for Around Campus (which is the company that produces "The MountainYear") where I will report a big fat 0 sales today.  They should be getting used to it by now anyhow.  I'd imagine Carey will be cooking up something good for dinner and then beer will be involved somewhere in the night cap.  We may hang out with a couple from here in Morgantown we have made friends with since we got here in July last year.  I'll see myself back in here tomorrow, as this appears it could be a journal of some sort.  A new concept for me.
