      Don't be fooled by the face I wear For I wear a thousand masks, masks I'm afraid to take off, 	and none of them are one. Pretending is an art that's second nature to me, but don't be fooled, 	for God's sake, don't be fooled.  I give the impression that I'm secure, that is all sunny and unruffled with me 	as within as well as without; 	that confidence is my name and coolness is my game... That the water's calm and I'm in command, that I need no one. But don't believe me. PLEASE.  My surface may seem smooth, but surface is my mask. Beneath this lies no complacence Beneath dwells the real me in fear, confusion, and aloneness, 	but I hide this. I don't want anybody to know this. I panic at the thought of my weakness, 	and my fear of my being exposed.  That's why I frantically create a mask to hide behind, 	a nonchalant sophisticated facade to help me pretend, 	to shield me from the glance that knows. But such a glanceis precisely my salvation, my only salvation and I know it. That is if it's followed by acceptance, if it is followed by love. It is the only thing that will assure me of what I can't assure myself.... That I am worth something.  But I don't tell you this, I don't dare, I am afraid to. I am afraid to glance,  	I am afraid the glance won't be followed by acceptance and love. I am afraid you will think less of me, 	that you will laugh at me and your laughter would kill me. I am afraid that deep down I am no good, 	that I am nothing and you will see this and reject me.  So I play my game, my desperate game with a facade of assurance without 	and a tortured child within And so I begin the parade of masks and my life becomes a play, 	I idly chatter to you in the suave times of surface talk. 	I tell you everything that is really nothing  	and nothing of what is everything.. Nothing of what's crying inside me; so when I am going through my routine 	don't be fooled by what I am saying Please listen carefully and try to hear what I am saying, 	what I am not able to say, but would like to-- 	want for survival I need to say, but want I can't.  I dislike hiding. HONEST! I dislike the superficial game I am playing-- this phony game. I'd really like to be genuine and spontaneous and me. But you've got to help me, you've got to hold lout your hand-- 	even when that's the last thing I seem to want.  Only you can wipe away from my eyes the blank stare breathing death Only you can call on to aliveness... 	each time you are kind, and gentle, and encouraging. Each time you try to understand because you really care, 	my heart begins to grow wings, 	very small wings, very feeble wings, but wings. With your sensitivity and sympathy, and your power of understanding. 	I do want you to know that.
