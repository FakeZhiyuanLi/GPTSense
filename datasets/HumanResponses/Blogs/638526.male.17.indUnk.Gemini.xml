        urlLink    Thats Nancy and Annabelle.  Judas and I are their friendly enemies.  It's a love hate relationship.  For christmas we wrapped Annabelle in 4 layers of wrapping paper and covered her with bows.  Nancy didn't like the idea.  Judas and I thought it was hilarious.

       Hey, I'm new to this photo thing and yea I oculd put a thousand camp photos up but I'm really interested in what people want to see and what they want to know about me.  Feel free to comment on everything and anything for this first month or so while I try things out.  Thanks.

        urlLink    This is where I go to camp.  Fairview Lake is a really nice place.  There are cabins there, too.  It's not just a lake.  That would be weird.

        urlLink    This was me in camp. I'm normally this mello quiet black kid. Minding my own business. "Black" Will thought it would be nice if he dressed us all up one day. So, since I only where Khakis, for one day I was "Khaki Thunder". I'm all the way on the right. Ypp. Thats me.

       So I decided that my other blog (if you don't have it don't ask) was too involved.  This one is clean.  Just random stuff here.  Anything I can find that I want to put here I will.  I don't know exactly what I want to do but I'm sure I'll think of something.  Maybe it'll be a photo essay...  Who knows?  Not me.  Obviously.  Anyway chill well.
