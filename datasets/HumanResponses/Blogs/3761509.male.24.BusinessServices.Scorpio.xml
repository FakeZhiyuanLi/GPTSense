      I'll leave this short and sweet, but I saw "Harold and Kumar go to White Castle" last weekend, and it was one of the funniest movies I have seen in over a year. The commercials don't really do the movie justice, and if you think they actually look funny, wait till you see the whole deal. So, if you get a chance within the next few weeks, and you want to have a few good laughs, check it out.   Meanwhile, I'm looking forward to "The Village" still, even though it's getting pretty bad reviews. Apparently every critic "knew the ending from the very first scene." Sure ya did.   P.S. Playstations are made more shoddy than project housing. Later...

      When it comes to thinking about real-life&nbsp;cowboys and ranches, I think about hard work. As the title of this post reads, I don't picture it as the Bar None on my pre-teen Saturday afternoon Nick lineup. In reality, these places involve back breaking work, which usually kicks off at the ass-crack of dawn. Seems like a great place to take in kids dying of cancer right?   What I'm alluding to is the Imus Ranch, brought to you by Don Imus... Actually, it's mostly brought to you by the people who pledge money during his Imus Ranch telethon once a year on what is a great radio station for sports nuts, The Fan. The funny thing is, Imus takes these kids in for about 10 days, while he LIVES on the ranch for what is now about 5 months out of the year. Now, think about that for a minute. A guy, who is beyond wealthy, takes in millions to benefit the Ranch, which is pretty much his home for half the year.   Anyone wanna contribute to the Watterworth Villa?   Making the situation an even bigger joke is the fact that cancer kids come to the ranch to work as Ranch-hands. Now, if I were a kid dying of cancer, do I wanna wake up at 5:30 a.m. for 2 weeks, to bust my ass doing chores and falling off horses. To me, that does not seem fun. It makes me think the Neverland Ranch is a more fun place, not including alleged touching. I didn't have cancer as a kid and I hated doing the chores around my own house, let alone a huge, hot ranch where I would have a wrinkle-faced Imus telling me to get back on my horse, while being awake for 10 hours already.   It's pretty amazing to me that the only person who "exposes" this is Howard Stern, and he only does so because he hates the man. Sometimes it just amazes me how people overlook things that reek of bogusness.   Couldn't the kids at least have a hot lifeguard like Melody to look at?

      K-Mart went shopping, and the Nets were just too cheap. The ever-changing NBA shifted even more today, with Kenyon Martin jumping ship to Denver. Rough P.R. hit for the new Nets owner Ratner. While it does look pretty terrible on the surface, this was pretty much predestined. With Jason Kidd gettin' paid out the asshole, and Richard Jefferson about to get max money, there just wasn't enough room for all three.  &nbsp;  Part with the scoring-potent wingman next year? Or let Martin walk and try to grab another PF via the trade route? Either way you are going to piss off some of the 10 Nets die-hards.  &nbsp;  But, for the first time in years, the NBA is wide open. T'Wolves, Spurs, Rockets, Kings, Lakers, Nuggets, Pistons, Pacers, Heat, Mavericks, and I guess even the aforementioned Nets all have a legit shot at a title&nbsp;run. &nbsp;I'm already looking forward to Walton calling a Friday night game.

      Well, it's here... I followed the trend and started a blog page. Here you will find me shooting my mouth off about stuff I love and hate. Music and Movies mostly... Sports not far behind. Whatever I feel like...   So I'll start by telling Kobe Bryant he might be the biggest idiot in the world. Good luck winning anything in the West without Shaq, including your rape trial. I never really thought Kobe was a bad guy, and when this chick came out yelling rape, I figured he didn't even do it.  But now after hearing the kind of guy he is behind the scenes? Well, let's just say I'm indifferent in my opinion. Apparently, since Phil Jackson has brittle bones in his feet, Kobe would whip the ball at his coach's feet when he got angry with him. That's a real cool guy. Of course, this is all hearsay and who knows what went down, all I know now is that Kobe is pretty much the acting GM of the Lakers, and he is ruining the team.   That's all for now... The new Roots album "The Tipping Point" is on point, check it out. Also, be sure to check the links to the left, the top two being two other real good blog sites from two brilliant Brymar graduates...    Professor Brymar - OUT!

      Just a few random notes to get you through the next ten minutes...  -"Madden '05" is here... put your life on hold and enjoy. I wish it were my job to pick the songs used in the game though, as the newest Alter Bridge joint isn't to my, and I'm assuming, most people's liking. Although, I do really like the new Green Day single "American Idiot," a song that could actually earn a "punk" label thrown on it.  -The new Shyne album is pretty solid. Any rapper who can record a 50 Cent diss-track over the phone via jail gets props, right?  -The "Best of Triumph the Insult Comic Dog" DVD is hilarious. If you have seen any of his classic skits on "Conan," you get the gist. "Who wants to hear a spoiler?"  -If you are a Weezer fan,  urlLink this is a must read...    -I'm on vacation next week, so most of my day will be spent watching movies and DVDs, if you have any I should check out, post me a comment about them if you don't mind.  -I find it funny how the Boss chews Joe Torre out for playing Kenny Lofton when the only guy who wanted Lofton on the damn team was Steinbrenner!!.... AHHH  I guess that's all I got, lame...
