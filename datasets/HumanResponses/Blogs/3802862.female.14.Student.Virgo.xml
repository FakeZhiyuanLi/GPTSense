       he ya,  &nbsp;  wow i never knew you could change the colour of the texxt. hmmm maybe i've slow or maybe its new. i think it's new.  &nbsp;  well today i'm happier then ever. My parents are now talking to each other normally over the phone. They don't yell at each other and fight no more. I guess we've all really benefitted from my dad moving&nbsp; away. It was tragic that it all had to happen this way for them to resolve everything. it would of been better if he could stay here and live with us. Sometimes when we talk to dad on the fone we joke about him not being here and stuff. It's all weird.  &nbsp;  The other day i went to John's house- which is mum's friend's son. and yer the cruz's and reye's were there too. We are starting to spend more time with John, Sarah and tit Liberty, it's most probably because of the divorce. See Noel is old and tita liberty is young and they were bound to get a divorce sooner or later. And now there's alot of gossip out with all the mums. Tita lib has alot of time on her hands now and is really lonely so she spends heaps of her time at other peoples houses. The other was the first time we went to her new house, she like called us last minute and was like dinner at my place. I don't know how john feels bout the whole divorce thing, i know my parents were about to split and it practically killed all my happiness and reason for living. No one noticed this because i was so good at hiding my real feelings. maybe that's why i can act?&nbsp;i dunno. even tho i dis like john alot i still give him sympathy cos it wouldn't be easy to get thro. He probly doesn't need it but it's there.  &nbsp;  well i don't hav much else to say except i'm writing a story and i'm up to 4887 words. oh and we went bargain shopping today. oooo and i can't forget we're having a huge party at my house next sunday cos it's mum's bday and our house is getting blessed cos di saw a ghost.  &nbsp;  neways more detail on that next post,  &nbsp;  peace out

      howdy peeps,  hmm well my school holidays weren't so exciting as i thought they would of been. i guess its cos mum works like 24/7 now-which is a bumma- so we don't do much around here. Mum's a bit of a workaholic but i wished she didn't work and stress so much because we already have a big house,clothes, food, cars and everything else we need to survive, we have more stuff then most people need. We don't need money to buy us happiness, so long as everyone healthy and cheerful, i'm satisfied. If mum didn't work so much she wouldn't have bad astma and she'd get to relax. but when mum doesn't work she's either cleaning the house or sitting on the lounge watching tv all sad and upset. she says working takes her mind off all the bad things that's happened in the past and there's alot of it.  Which is sad because i thought i was the only one suffering from it. A few weeks ago i was lost in tears while i carved my name in my arm with a knife, i didn't do it deep enough for it to bleed but i done it deep enough to scar. so now i'm scarred for life and am constantly reminded of it. This past year i've learnt that to let go of something is a tragic loss but the outcomes of it is far worse. My dad left us to live in the Philippines in February (which broke my heart) but it was for the better. He didn't want us to watch our parents fight day in and day out. but it still hurts because he's not here with me. When he left i cried and i cried lots after that. I know my parents will never get back together but i still have hopes of one day us being a family again. My dad made alot of mistakes which tore our family apart in the first place but with him in the Phils. it's slowly bringing us together again. I know in this generation there are heaps of families that are torn up and its nearly normal but i never thought it would ever happen to me.  better go cos skool starts tomoro, will one day write in detail wat did happen in the past that still haunts me today.  peace out

      hey y'all  well my lil cus is over (jeremiah) and is staying for a couple nights. He's playing the ps2 cos that gets his mind of things otherwise he'll hav a lil cry cos he misses his mommy and daddy. i feel so sorry, so young and innocent.   Yesterday we went to the city and it was great fun. We went with the Cruz's except tito art and Allister wasn't there. It was weird and kool cos we were all in pairs most of the time. Like our mum's were infront, i'd chill and talk to patrick, Di and Bernice would chat and the two lil boy (jeyar and nick) would randomly get lost. Even tho we didn't go on a shopping spree it was still hella fun. Like in Big W me and Pat sat in the elevator while it went to the different floors cos we 'missed' our stop. Plus my feet were killing me and i was too lazy to get up off my ass.  I've noticed now i'm ditching bernice more. not intentionally like i've noticed at parties or whenever other people my age are around i tend to talk to them.  And most of the time someone(fab 5) will say something like oh you ditched us again last night. I mean i can't help it cos i can be mature and talk about teen issues and stuff wid other teen filos that i don't see very often. And i can be stupid and a fool wid the fab 5 who i see all the time. Maybe they just don't see my point of view. What makes things worst is Bernice and I are drifting apart, at first we 'were' talking buddies we'd tell each other what was bothering us when we were down but now it's like 'meh' u wouldn't care. I don't know in time everything will heal itself and trust me i know from experience. I just don't know anymore!  well i better go put jeremiah in bed cos it's getting late.  peace out, take care monmon

      howdy,  Right now i'm ding nothing but surfing the net because yer i'm bored. My holidays were going fine up untill now. Hopefully things will brighten up next week otherwise these school holidays would of been a waste of time.   The Past week:   Thursday last week-  was the first night of my drama performances. There was more people in the audience then expected. We made a few mistakes but overall the performance piece was great so i heard.   Saturday-  i performed the last of our drama pieces, there was one at 2pm and the last one at 5pm. both performances was great, no mistakes but there was smaller audiences. At our last reflection i  NEARLY  cried. I guess it was because going to the drama workshops has helped me alot. It's basically the only place i can feel happy and good about myself. Plus i made a load of new friends. In one of the workshops Andrea saw my arm and saw that i carved my name in it and she gave me some really good advice which really helped me out. Saying goodbye was really hard but then again goodbye is for now and not forever. Plus Roushini is gonna have a party before the end of this month so yer it aint the end! and hopefully Chris (the director) will have another set of workshops for us.  Sunday-  was the day of Nathaniel's (my baby cousin) chiristening and Nigel's (Nathaniel's older bro) birthday. No one really paid any close attention to Nigel because the baby was more exciting. So yer we went to the church and after went to the party at my aunty's house. The *Fab 5 especially *Bernice were pretty cut at me cos i spent most of my time catchin up wid my cousins and talking to the other *filo teens. But hey i see the Fab 5 all the time and they'll get over it. The party went till late but i left at 5pm with *JJJ cos they wanted me and *Di to stay over there house for a couple days. According to *Patrick, *Jasper and *Jodelyn hit it off which is funny cos Jodelyn likes him and yer (i think, i so wish i was there.  Monday-  was spent hanging out wid Aunty Jhen and Jeremiah.  Tuesday-   was the same as Monday just chillin and stuff we also painted a table which was fun cos Jeremiah made a mess and Di got cut. *Kuya ley gave me some hash cake and i don't think i got high till mid wednesday at the shops cos it had no effect onme that night. Wednesday- Aunty Jhen went to get her eyebrows waxed and Di and I came along. I was acting so weird cos i'd laugh at everything for no reason but i don't i think it was that hash cake. That night we went home.  Thursday (yesterday)-  The *Cruz's came over except Allister (He was probly working) and yer stayed for a bit. When they left we went to the Morayfield Plaza and i saw *Trent with his mum. I wanted to stop and talk to him but then mum would be like hmmmmmmm..... And that pretty much is what happened the last week.   * the **  Fab 5:  consists of Me, Bernice, Di, Charmain and Nicole. Our families usually do stuff together and now we're pretty close friends.  Bernice:  is a Cruz. She's 11 turning 12 but she looks like a teen. Heaps of people think we're sisters or something cos we're somewhat alike.  Filo:  is short for filipino  JJJ:/strong> Aunty Jhen, Justin (aunty Jhen's boyfriend) Jeremiah is their son.  Di:  My little sister who is now 13 years old  Patrick:  is a Cruz, he's 14 (same age as me)he's like my guy best friend here in caboolture  Jasper:  is a Hughe he's half filo and he's pretty good-looking which is why nearly all the chicks are after him.   Joelyn:  A brissy filo, who's the same age as me  Kuya ley:  is my big bro who's 19. His name is Leo but i call him Kuya for a mark of respect.  Cruz's:  Tito(uncle)Art, Tita(Aunty)Riza, Allister, Patrick, Bernice and Nic.  Well if you bothered to read all of the above congratulations cos it took me ages to type.  better go cos jeyar (lil bro) wants to use the net  ciao, monmon
