      Jesus gave all... so what can i give?  Jesus was willing to sacrifice Himself so that we might live... so how much am i willing to give?  could i give up what i want?  so... it remains to be seen.  the struggle is within me... could i devote my entire life to Him with no holds barred?  or will my desire for earthly things win out?  many times, it is not so much a struggle with supernatural evil as it is a struggle with our human nature.  selfishness.  laziness.  weakness.  rule me, oh God... take away my selfishness and laziness.  make me complete in my weakness.  God...

      there is no need for a moral dilemna... just think this... if A and B are opposites, A and B cannot both be true without being contradictory.  Only A  OR  B can be true.  in conclusion, there must be absolute truth.  therefore, anyone who preaches that one can reach salvation through more than one path (religion) is a liar.  God is the only way; there can be no other.  Christianity claims to be the only way; it only remains for one either to accept it or reject it.   i have more to say, but it would just be too much... anyone who wants to know more can mail me through the link below... click on my name...

      today, in advisory, my teacher put up one of those optical illusion pictures... some of us saw it immediately, others of us saw it later, and others of us saw it not at all... it was an image of Jesus.  it just hit me... that's the way people are in relation to God.  Some will know Christ sooner.  Some will know Christ some time later.  Some will come to know Christ only after searching for a long time... those who seek will find.  Some just don't care and will never see the light.  i see God speaking through the many things happening around me.  i have compassion for those that will never accept Christ... those who reject Christ despite all the efforts of those around them... despite the love of an omnipotent, infinite God... in spite of all... i see those around me in school... they are so shallow compared to those in our fellowship... what is their chief end?  it should have been to glorify God and enjoy in Him forever, but they have made it a girl, or a guy, or some material possession, or the act of sex, or grades, or something else... everything but God.  Pray...

      hm... it seems i've found some of my weaknesses... God has been using some of my friends to speak to me.  God teaches us through the things that happen to us.  the trials.  others' words.  His own Word.  Spiritual nudges from the Holy Spirit.  the good times.  we can take a lesson from anything and everything that happens to us...  God wants to improve us.  He wants the best for us.  He wants to teach us things we can apply to our lives that will improve us and be useful to us in making our lives better.  i've learned so much in the past two months...

      so... i went to sparring today and it was tiring... not as bad as it could have been... but anyway, sorry about the accidental post yesterday... back to tae kwon do... sometimes tae kwon do is just plain pain.  sometimes my muscles are torn up.  sometimes i spend the last drop of energy left within me.  sometimes i get hit too hard... sometimes in the wrong spot.  Jesus, our Lord, can sympathize with the suffering i go through... Jesus walked all through the land and was no stranger to physical weakness.  Jesus, being the infinite God He is, emptied Himself of His divine power and became a man... and poured all of Himself out as a sacrifice for us all.  Jesus was whipped and beaten before His death, whipped by a metal-tipped whip that literally ripped the flesh off His back.  Jesus experienced weakness and endured suffering, even more so than i or any of us have... therefore, He knows what we're going through.  talk to God... He understands what you're going through... He has experienced it fully and completely.

      You might say, who needs a priest?  Jesus came, so we're done with that... only the Catholics do that, and they're wrong...  Well, if you really think about it, we all need apriest... we are all dirty and sinful, needing a priest to intercede on our behalf where God is so holy we can't go.  Christ is our ultimate, high priest... He made a sacrifice on our behalf - the sacrifice of Himself.  He intercedes on our behalf.  We just have the best and only covenant.  We are now washed clean, and therefore, able to meet God.  Read Hebrews... good book.

      God is threefold - the Trinity.  God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.

      position vector E represents Ezra's heart.  ||E||, magnitude of E, is 1/infinity.  the direction towards salvation, represented by the point S, is represented by the position vector R, righteousness.  the direction of R is 90 degrees (vertical). ||R||=infinity.  because the direction of E is not the same as the direction of R, enter G.  vector G represents Grace.  God places G on the graph, so that R will be the resultant of E and G.  mostly G.  G will make up virtually all of the distance between the tip of E and point S.

      A Study on John 10 : 28 - 30   "I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand. I and the Father are one."   For those who don't know or don't remember, the last discussion group was on peace. The verse above provides me much peace. Those of us who have accepted that offer of eternal life are recipients of those benefits mentioned above. Nothing and nobody can separate us from God. No matter what happens, God keeps my spirit secure, and my eternity as well. If God can keep my spirit firmly in His grasp, then I can be sure that He can keep the rest of my being - the physical, mental, social, emotional, and academic parts, secure as well. If my eternity is secure in the salvation He provides, then I can be sure that He is also in control of the brief time I have been alloted on this earth.   Basically, what I am saying is this: if He can handle the most important parts of my existence, then the smaller things really are no issue. I have experienced Peace when I realize that God is always in control; I take comfort in knowing that He has a plan for my life, and that I will end up wherever He wants me to be. Even when times are bad... even when I see everything falling apart around me... I find solace in knowing that He is with me, and that, eventually, everything will be alright. I know that, when you're in the situation, you can't see the end of it... the way out. This is where faith kicks in. You just have to trust that God has got it down.   Your Brother in Christ,   Ezra Chang

      May 24, 2004    To my brothers and sisters:  [Excerpt from the journal of Ezra, slave to Christ, dated 2/19/04 –   “ … even though the love of God is so hard and nigh on impossible to realize or comprehend fully, once realized, it is a much longer term fix than any human love realized in our blindness. God's love is forever, infinite, and unconditional. our love is a fallen form and mere shadow of that love. our love is frail, conditional, weak, and subject to change. sometimes i lose sight of all this, and i reach for what is, to my distorted perception, the closer form of love. the human kind. it is during those times that i forget one so very important thing... God's Spirit is alive in me. He is right here inside me and all around me. His love is only a prayer away.    Father, help me... remind me at all times and every moment of Your love. without it, i cannot live, i cannot continue. Lord, thank you for Your love. Your love is pure and holy, infinite and unconditional, and last but definitely not least - eternal. in Your Son's Name i pray, Amen.  ”  End excerpt.  This excerpt was previously released on Ezra’s Xanga. ]  I have released this post in hopes that you might all benefit from it.  At the time, I was in great emotional distress and spiritual confusion.  I had been searching for love and acceptance in all the wrong places.  This breakthrough came by the grace of God, and began my road to recovery.  It led up to, but did not end at, my baptism.  Perhaps you will be able to learn and take encouragement from it.  Take care, guys… talk to you all soon.     With love that is but a shadow of the love of Christ,  Your brother in Christ – Ezra Chang
