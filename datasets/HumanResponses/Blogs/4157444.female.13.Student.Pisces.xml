       okay. like i didnt update the other day or two or three but noone cares. today i went to petaluma for my grandamas chemo. it was done realy fast and shes doing much better. and then we just hung out at her house. we went to whole foods and got this like super good mac and cheese and this even better piece of corn. yeah i like food and boys. that pretty much my life if you couldnt tell already.      ok, on saturday i went to petaluma with my aunt. we went to yoga. that was positivly the most painful expierience of my life. but whatever. whats done is done. after that we went to the farm shes taking care of and fed her awsome goats. i was a afraid they were gonna eat my fingers cuz they eat everything. and then we just chilled to 4 ish then we had to leave for a party. and that was when i saw the gorgeous son. whoa baby. his name is Jans. and ill let you figure that one out. well anyways i thought he was like 18 becuase he loooked 18. but then Espay (the mom) told me he just turned 15. i was like just my luck. and he caught me staring at him. oopsies! then i looked away. and omg.. .there was this other girl just my age that was staying a couple days with their family. and i was like you dog. you get to spend a while with him AND your going on the water with him.  so now im mad at her. ugh. well, she'll be going back to canada, and i spose ill see him again someday.  ehh well, probly not cuz like i dont know. but maybe he has hot friends becuase Espay invited me to go boating with him and his friends. LMAO... maybe ill say im 14 and im gonna be a fresh men. cept i already told Espay i was only 13 going into 8th grade. so theylll just think im some little person. poop. but then we went to the party with a bunch of old farts who apparenly all knew me. and this guy came up behind me and kissed my head. i was like wtf. how random. yeah. so bye.
