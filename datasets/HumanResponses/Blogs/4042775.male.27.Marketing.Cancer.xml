      I finally met my roommates mother tonight.&nbsp; Its interesting to meet your roommates parents because you get to see who they get their habits from.&nbsp; Anyways I had a great time at dinner she bought beers and food what else could you ask for?&nbsp; We ate at Dick's Last Resort, which by any means isn't the most normal place which is probably why I liked it so much.&nbsp; After Dick's my roommate and I went to our favorite bar across the street from our place.&nbsp; This place is your typical neighborhood bar.&nbsp; From the lack of service to the lonely people looking for good conversation then to your run away husbands this place has it all.&nbsp; Typically we go their to play darts, I enjoy the regularity of a place that only confines to the walls within everyone has a say.&nbsp; I have nothing left to say today.&nbsp; Goodnight.&nbsp;

      I think the reason why I never voted before was because I lived in Nebraska and they only elect republicans in that state.&nbsp; Now I live in Chicago a democratic city.&nbsp; Everyday this city seems smaller and smaller.&nbsp; Someday it may disappear.&nbsp; I hope that I can find my way home.&nbsp;

      I am official now.&nbsp; I registered to vote in the city of Chicago.&nbsp; Chalk one more vote up for Kerry this fall.&nbsp; I can't understand how anyone could vote for Bush after the last four years.&nbsp; But according to Gallup polls this years election is going to be very close.&nbsp; This is a popular topic of debate on Friday nights when my friends and I are having a few pints.&nbsp; I always tell them that I think Clinton was one of the best modern day presidents we have had.&nbsp; Of course they don't agree with me.&nbsp; What I don't understand is how can you argue with peace and prosperity for eight years?&nbsp; Granted some people say Clinton didn't do anything to stop the terrorists from becoming what they are today but what was he supposed to do start a war to flex the US's military muscle?&nbsp; Which reminds me, I love the new Beastie Boys album.&nbsp; It reminds me of 80's rap.&nbsp; They got very political on this last album I guess that is what happens when you start to grow older and wiser.&nbsp; My favorite song is Open letter to NYC, reminds me of when I lived in NYC.&nbsp;

      My sister and her friend were in town last weekend.&nbsp; I am so run down today because we went out everynight last weekend and I gave them my bedroom and I had to sleep on the couch which means I basically didn't sleep.&nbsp; I am going to sleep for 12 hours tonight to get myself back to normal or as close as I can get.
