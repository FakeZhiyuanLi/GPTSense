      Apparently changing the template isn't so tough.  That is, if you're not starting from scratch...  I found lots of help by searching for "Blogger Template" in Google. :-)

      Darn. Just as I thought it was too good to be true.  SpyMAC.com offers 100 megs free webhosting, and 1 gig e-mail. (sounds familiar?) Plus, free blogging. :-)   Amazing, I thought. Until I tried to access the SpyDisk (webhosting) feature. Apparently, from the Forum, you have to have wait 36 hours. They use WebDAV, and what is that? I've tried looking online for WebDAV freeware for Windows (can't afford my programs to stop working after 1 month) and I've found 4 WebDAV clients at WebAttack... all Shareware. Kudos, WebAttack!! Coulda gotten the freeware too?  Anyway. I quite like Blogger. It's funky. Now, how do I change the template?

      there is a feeling one gets when one starts to blog. I will now attempt to describe that feeling, elusive though it is, that I feel.  I am now Powerful! To think that I Could not find the words; Yet now, they come tumb-ling!  words came not easy; in silence, i dreamed; yet now, the power of a newfound eloquence is mine.  so go forth and froth my everlasting thoughts! effervescent though you may be.  i gawk, gape and google -- i GO to google to OGLE. and the [b] has gotten to [me].

      in the beginning, there was nothing. and then God created something. So I guess he did a pretty good job of it. Someone probably thinks I'm trying to be a smart alec when I say that he may or may not have planned for us humans (his creations) to invent cars and computers (our creations) and thus indirectly, he isn't the creator of all things. In that case, would God be the creator of us (people) if he had intended to create the world (universe) but not its eventualities? I wonder.

      the two women sit at the table and smile at each other because they know each other  and the one asks the other, “How is your married life?”  to which the other replies, “It is all very well, thank you... and what about your single life?”  to which the one answers, “It is also very well, thank you...”  and they laugh and talk about their exploits  the married one talks about her husband unicentric in nature, is her mind focused on home and husband and child and she laughs, as it is her life  and the single one wonders if she had missed out on anything on the security of a husband and a home on the love of a child or children on the continuing comfort of security  and the single one talks about her exploits diffused in focus, she is bubbly and she is hunted by men as surely as she hunts the best of them  she laughs about the gifts she receives and the time she spends juggling between her lovers how they have on many occasions been the game of her emotions  and the married one wonders if she had made a mistake if she had married the wrong man if her prince charming had lost his way and was looking out for her  and she wonders if she could be free from this drudgery this mind-numbing mundanity of repeating everything everyday, in the same way and if the sizzle in her life has given way to a more benign matronly boredom...  the conversation stalls... and the one and the other sip their cappucino, and their mocha... and all niceties are showing without a single glint of their mind's churnings...  and life, as ever, goes on.

      freely flighting away from thee; nimbly nighting it out with thee; blithely blighting the best of thee; blissfully bedding the rest of thee.  in stupor i succumb to sobriety; to ingenuity, i inveigle from infamy.     i leap across, to where you are... not. the waters shimmer as i lift from rock.

      all and sundry shall not go hungry with good husbandry;  consider the sky: deeply mystified and excoriated by lights.     and the soar of liquor is this poem's sculptor and its heady motor.     and relationships work as they are advert- ised, it's a circ- ular prize in a pert- inent lie.

      there is a woman before me, who, melancholy in her eyes, sighs.     no, i have not money, to ease away the penury; nor do i have sympathy, to ease away the injury.  but then, a beckoning hand, she looks earnest in the eye; and hopes, perhaps, for a brief respite.  no, say i, i have no thing for you; but the woman clings, sobs, and says  i have no friend but one: my loneliness i find, everyplace i try to run from it. do not now let me languish in this wrenching loneliness! for now i have found in you the crown and the fount  fool! say i, see you not? am i not like you in loneliness craved?  ah, said she -- but for that. 'tis a sure thing: when we find each other our loneliness shall flutter and in a brief respite: vanish.  ah. i see...

      what expectations are we expected to meet? to be the mat beneath the feet?  they say: to be kind, is to be cruel; and to be cruel, is to be kind.  much so, has the rice turned to gruel? is the gruel, so turned, nice?  a little bird asked me today, why do i fly? why do you stay?  i told him, i would love to fly... i need not stay, and he need not fly.  and so beneath our feet we find, the elusive thing (the peace of mind)  when we let go of everything our disappointments lose their sting.

      i couldnt stand to stay another day, i simply had to go my way. this house is hard to live in, and the walls they silently remind of how and what we used to play.  i have tried my best to dye my hair, i have tried my best to take you there. there, in elysian fields, where peace murmurs ever; there in forever, where forever is for ever.  the sniggering smiles shall leave us be: we the disenfranchised, they the ugly range of the human franchise.  so we deal in life? to be realistic, the time is short, and the hope is mystic.  optimistic.

      like another me, yet not like me, she stares at me, and only me.  who might she be, who won't let me be? this femme banshee, who silent, sees.  this creature strange, like a leech deranged, sticks to the window pane, and does not change.

      a good night's sleep is my privilege: a luxury i can scant afford. they say, you sleep more when you're at my age. but what to do when you are bored?  the dreams we dream, like misty realms. a nightmare's scream will overwhelm my partner's slumber deep and from her mouth, a scream shall leap.

      "Speak softly, Love" -- the singer crooned, as he watched the crowd shuffle earnestly, the aging bodies trying to rekindle the warmth  of a lost nostalgia.     and ever, the bodies twirld, the swirling colours melting into a hazy forgetfulness.     sixteen to sixty? pretense of sympathy? or a flame, that never perishes?

      instinctive as the sun, when the moon begins to rise, so does my instinct tell me, "Hide! My master, Hide!"  for men they come with guns, in holiness they hunt; be they giant or a runt, they kill to out the brunt.  and now the end is near; tell me: where to hide? can they find me, smell my fear? would they kill a man untried?

      this life is slowly crumbling, to crumbs that numb, so humbling - to realize that all our petty grumbling will end in nought, and we, tumbling to the abyss of an unknown oblivion.  holed up in the home, surrounded (barricaded) by old tomes that speak only of dust. to what life have i been induct- ed? to what end will i be instruct- ed? when shall my free spirit roam?

      meekly, mocking -- i mock me; yes me indeed, and not thee, thou'rt too good for me to speak of, too high above this niggardly earth, too virtuous even to breathe courteous simple words to scroundrels such as i...  for after all, thy name art carved in stone, and thou'rt perched firmly on thy pedestal; arms eternally poised in dramatic gesture.  who's to blame me, if i vehemently say -- you have a heart of stone?

      life could be perfect if we should so elect to accept its defects and choose not to reject. not now, nor ever. to impact society, learn to accept the difference. We act like we do, but we don't.  and it's not just a question of fact.

      the human instinct is quite distinct from precinct to precinct: we know your sphinct- er will pass all strict testing. you cannot convict a man who's merely linked by a stain of ink. that's a proof so infinit- simally small, like a blink being equated to a thing that has a familiar ring.

      the frank truth about advocates is that they start by instigat- ing the client, infuriat- ing him to boiling point, and lat- er getting him to litigate.  the fact does not mitigate the wrongness of the crime creat- ed.

      i am terse when i insert myself into her ... words.  intense, not incensed: nor will my tense- ness ever dispense the need for verb-al defense.  to be terse -- is to be cer- tifiably cursed. one sparks the interest but fails to sustain the words.  i am with her, now, lost and happy, to be tossed about, aimless -- no moss. don't want to know the cost, (the price of being lost) so help me be my most!  help me, be ... lost-er. (is there such a word?) no matter! i still have all my lustre. just like a smokin' lobster, that burns red in hot water.

      each time we leave her house, i feel her mother's heavy frown. thinking perhaps, that i would pounce on her lovely flower, and proceed to pound the heaving, luscious mounds. but i am no such louse. no! i shall keep my trous- ers on.

      can a person love untruly? such a heart, must be unruly?  if she loves not truly, will the world stop, end, and stand still?  for her, my heart i will gladly efface, and all my ambitions shirk for her beauty.  “i love you true” - but it is untrue her pity is no thrill.  for “i love you” -  it is true but the loving, is not.

      a gnawing suspicion, of being in love- could it be so? my blood circulation improves each time we meet. you spring my mood into cheerier days. and i munch my food with mucho gusto. bravo! a flower will i pluck, to tempt you as a lover tempts his beloved; an independent rush of happiness, joy; the face is flush with gladness apparent - otherwise known as a blush.

       Dear Blog...    Life has been a hectic up and down recently.  Oh... and this is my first non-verse post in a long time.  What to say? Work has been a bitch.    Firefox has been a good thing, though...       urlLink   Firefox - The Browser, Reloaded.       This is gonna have to be it for a while. I'll be hounding away at my work. Barking up the right tree, i Hope....  And what about that notebook? I need to find one. Just when I thought I'd the right one... ... it has to be dashed away. :-(  So, we shall see what happens this weekend.

       it has been, it seems to me,    a long eternity    since i found that she    was not for me.      but for reasons best known    to her and her own    circle, her tone    has grown    cold.      we are no perfect matches,    no perfect fit that latches    one unto the other;    no real life dream lover,    or one that is her    in every description.      i am not perfect    but you select    me, reflect-    ing that    truth that    you need that    special some one, too.      imperfection    escapes distractions    a reflection    of our persons.

      the people always tell you, it is noble to be noble, it is great to be loyal, and honourable to be valorous.  the people always tell you, that friendship is forever, that foes must be friends, that peace is pacific.  those same fine people, will just as soon turn around, at the suggestion of their doing, the very same that which they commended.  the same people that populate, every city on this clump, of dirt and grime and water, hurtling through a vast vacuum.  and they are the hypocrites, who would sooner slaughter the child, of another, because their own is dead, and the envy of it stinks.  and they are wanting, like eager predators of the wild, to push their archaic, outdated legalisms on those undeserving.  but then, i speak only truth, and truth appears to be untruth, if you should be opposed to it.

      in awe of characters i'd seen in awe of places they'd been in awe of all in between;  the people who populate your landscape, all seem to be curst by two heads. two minds, two hearts: two states of being alive, and yet so dead.  Old Harry is in dilemma, what to do about Pete Parker; To vanquish or to cherish? why does the man seem squarish?  Peter is in tatters, as he begins to lose his powers; Shall he lose or gain the lady? Shall he heroic be, or cowardly?  Then come us to the damsel, whose face shall make the show sell. She finds love from the moon, and much in a swoon, jilts the silly goon, all for the spider's boon.

        while alice is stuck in wonderland kevin is lost in blunder land. what's that you say? "Hey -- bummer, man." like a racer negotiating the stunner bend i keep hoping that this wont get out of hand. that luck keeps shifting like only it can, that eventually i'll drift to the subtler blend. is it time now? to drop pretense? to surrender and give in without defense? i hope it turns out, i'll be a better man; even though i think about it now and then... the things that people don't understand, the things that happened that were never planned. perhaps now, it's time, to keep it canned; perhaps i will exhaust your attention span?
