      Big Brother announced this week’s nomination results – and revealed that three housemates will face the public vote instead of two!  Marco, Michelle and Nadia were all told they will be up for eviction on Friday.   Again Big Brother hinted that there had been a twist in the nomination process which would be revealed later.   Earlier the Daily Mirror reported that Marco and Nadia were the favourites to be nominated.   Michelle was the shock addition and she reacted to her nomination by shouting at the other housemates before storming off to talk to Big Brother in the Diary Room and threatening to leave.   Agitated Marco then announced that he would “tell everyone in the house what he really thought of them by Friday.”   Nadia remained pensive but joined her fellow nominees in a group hug.   The nominations come in the wake of the shock arrival on Sunday of bi-sexual singer Becki Seddiki, which could shake up a divided household.   Since the show began, three female contestants have been shown the door but only one was voted out.   Feisty Kitten was the first to be booted out for breaking Big Brother rules three times, while loudmouth Emma was forced to leave after her alcohol-fuelled bust-up with Victor.   On Friday, South African blonde Vanessa became the first housemate to be evicted by public vote.   Becki, 33, who works as a trainee florist and lives in north London, initially told the group she had been a Big Brother contestant in Italy, but soon confessed she was bluffing and was actually English.   Earlier, the newest addition to the Big Brother house revealed that she knew about Nadia's past.   Moroccan-born Becki told Portuguese-born Nadia she would not give away the 27-year-old's secret.       hey thabks for visting my website

      what is this all i know is This old article is interesting because of the surprising statistic regarding late fees:  "[Netflix] found that 11 percent of movie renters return movies unwatched because of the time restrictions and that 20 percent pay, on average, about $7.60 in late fees for every tardy DVD rental. "   That's rough. For one in five of us, we're paying $11.00 to rent a DVD for a week from Blockbuster. One in ten of us doesn't get to see the movie at all!     hey thabks for visting my website
