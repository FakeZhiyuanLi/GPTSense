      I just saw this movie... Twilight Samurai, and I've got to say it's one of the best movie I have ever seen. It's a man content with himself without an ambition to build a career that can ultimately destroy his humanity and family. It's the perfect portrayal of life and fate. I love it. It's messages are narrated beautifully without a hint of persuasion. So if you ever visit your rental or dvd store, buy this gem! I highly recommend it!  I've also been listening to L'Arc-En-Ciel's latest masterpiece: Smile. Although the Album's only got ten songs, every one of them is worth listening!

      I plunged.  I was excited. And I dreamed again of roses and berries.  And like so many in my past....  A dream is only a dream...

      Ismiaji Cahyono, This isn't the gentle kind of day that you Librans may dream about having, but it's time to step outside of your regular role. Playing the perfect host or hostess is not what the planets have in mind for you now. It’s time to get down and dirty, or maybe even a bit crazy. Jump into your fantasies and let them come to the surface. Of course, you don’t have to express every single thing you imagine, but it is okay to say more than you usually share.  That, by the way, was my astrology of the day.  Hahahahahahaha... how ironic!  By the way, I saw The Village yesterday. Despite of the critics, I liked it.  This Bali photosession is beginning to get on my nerves... now my boss wants to come along... shit!  More postings tomorrow....

      At the end of the day I heve neither the strength or wit to write a clever entry. Well that's not the point is it?  Today has passed by so fast I didn't notice anything coming. Maybe I wasn't supposed to. Does it matter? Probably not.  Tomorrow is another holiday. Should I look forward to it? Perhaps. I'll be meeting my friends. Something I haven't done in quite a long time.  I'll be leaving to Bali on Monday. Yipee. Maybe I can work on that tan I've always wanted.

      Here I am alone again at the office... One of the first to arrive and the last to leave. I hope that it won't conclude my life.  I could describe my routinity but then it would bore you...  You know what's weird. How you are so busy, pushed to the limits by piles of overlapping work that you're body automatically reacts to it like a machine, you're mind succumbs to the pressure, and goes blank... and before you know it, you're work is done. I was working on a company profile, minutes away from printing it. Then a disaster happened. The boss' secretary delivered me an image via network without clearly notifying me. My crummy machine crashed. I was able to recover my file but it wasn't printable... Apparently my software program was "shocked" at the abrupt meltdown and ruined my file. Shit. I was speechless. I couldn't get angry at the secretary. It was an honest mistake. A freak accident. Two days worth of work gone. Now I have to rebuild everything. Luckily, my colleague kept my original file, and so I would pick up from there. Somebody up there must like me. Can you imagine an overnight work redone in just an hour. My elbows felt like rubber at the end.... Sigh!  The only thing interesting today was casting models. Yup, an entourage of beautiful models lined up to be casted in this super exclusive apartment project. Not that I haven't seen beautiful women before... It's just interesting to see and hear people who make a living being an object of promotion.... Things like this fascinate me. I'm curious as what goes on through their mind. What is behind that beautiful facade? I'm also amazed at how well maintained they are... but women nowadays are like that. I guess I'm not in tune to such concept. Nontheless it's always exciting to discuss....  It looks as though we might have to delay the photoshoot. Great! Now I can go to that interview!  All in all it was fun. I just wish I'd hear from some friends... but I guess today is not the day.  I'm still smilin though.

      Just a perfect day... Lou Reed  It's cloudy out. The air conditioning is blasting. I'm freezing. I have an awful headache.  My interview at Fulbright went pretty well. At least I thought  it did. I hope I get this one. Can't wait to get out of this hell hole. Don't get me wrong, I love this country, but more and more each day, the future here seems foggy.  I just put myself in a dillema. I agreed to an interview this monday. A teaching post at Binus. Nice right? The catch is that on the same day I have a photoshoot. Shit. I can't afford to postpone this...  Gosh it's awfully lonely.  By the way, this is my first post. The first of many to come. This is also my first real interaction with the vast NET. I hope my stuff  will blow you away... or bore you to death. Either way, I am pleased to be able to share my feelings, thoughts, my philosophy, and my troubles with the digital community... and hopefully you! Yea you...  So welcome to ismeagain.blogspot.com  Add me and check me out. Place your comments. I'll try and get back to you as soon as I can. Have fun reading my miseries. Hah!
