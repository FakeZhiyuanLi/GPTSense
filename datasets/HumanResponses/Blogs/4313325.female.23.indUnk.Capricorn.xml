       I just have one question for you.    Why do men always have to be friends with their ex-girlfriends?    I guess I have two questions.   Why do men always have to be sluts?    They fuck anything that walks!

        So I am the youngest of four kids, I am the only girl! And to top that all off I was adopted. I grew up in a high class family, my dad is a doctor, and was a spoild brat. Hey at least I can admit it. I got everything I ever wanted. And what do I have to show for it? I got married when I was 18 years old, I was physically, emotionally, and mentally abused by him. I had two miscarriages. Finally when I was 20 I had a beautiful baby boy. He is my whole life. he is the reason that I am still alive today. I got divorced when I was 21. I got engaged again when I was 22, I caught him in bed with another women, let me mention that I was in the same bed. I had passed out from DRINKING, he decided to let her get in bed with him and they must have passed out after they did it, cause they were naked, and I woke up before they did. So I drug her out of my house by her hair and left him. Now I am 23 years old and engaged again. Who would have thought that I would marry my ex fiances friend? You find love in the oddest places. So now I have 8 months until I am married, I have a 2 and a half year old son, and I am an EMT/FF and finishing school!

        Who ever said that planning a wedding is easy really need to shut up! I have eight months until I am to be married and I have not a clue where to start. I have a fiance who told me he would help plan whatever I asked him to. Well he didn't tell me that he was lazy and never did anything I ask. I have done this whole thing. I am a full time mom, full time student, and soon part time employee. I am having my dress made, but he never wants to go with me to get fitted. I know what your thinking, why should he go. Well I have to drive 3 hrs to go where my dress is being made. I hate to drive alone. Not to mention he works nights and we never see eachother anymore. So that would just give us time to be together. We have been living together for about 2 months now and it is nothing like I would have planned it. But I guess things happen and I have no clue what to do about them. I guess you can never plan living together. Anyway, I guess I should stop writing today cause I will just keep rambleing unitl I have nothing to ramble about anymore. Later
