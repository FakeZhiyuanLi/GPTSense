      Well i was just asked to write a long blog on this blog thingamajigger and well i am going too. So today started off great since yesterday was so bad! lol. So i went to school and it was fun becuase i did my math homework for the first time in my life!!! Than off to second i went and i rebuilt my lawnmower engine in 10 minutes!! im proud! after i completed the beast (the engine) i went on the computers and owned Drag Racer V3!! Anywho i went to break and i sat down because thats what i usually do. Off to 3rd i go. So anyways we were reviewing a bunch of stuff and i didnt listen as usual and thats my 3rd period story. Lunch time came and i ate my lunch and than went to Ms Shisslers room for help with math and that took my whole lunch hour which sucked because i like conversing with students at the lunch table. Now we went to 4th and I sat down in my chair and made people touch my fluffy hair because it was so soft!. We found out we had a pep rally the whole class so that was cool. After the funny slightly boring pep rally was over we had gym and we had an edo which was even cooler! Me and Spencer sat on a chair and sat there because we had nothing to do and Spencer nutted Mark Ennis. That was so not cool! OOOOOO i almost forgot on the way to 5th i saw Erin and she said hi so i said hi back. So anywho i went home after school and sat down in the living room and chatted with my mother before i went to my room and went on msn. After a little bit of time on msn i went and had supper which was hamburger helper... it was allright since im not a big fan of it. After that i went back downstairs and went on my computer for a bit more and than lied down on my bed and almost fell asleep untill spencer called. So i went upstairs to wait for spencer because he was coming over and while i was up there my dad started talking with me so i enjoyed and than went outside and waited for spencer and scooted on my scooter. After he showed up we went downstairs and started playing halo. I went on msn after he annihalated me and Erin asked me to write a long blog for her to read so i am and now im going to finish this because theres nothing more to write goodnight for now   *-*Matty*-*

      Well today was an interesting day. first off i woke up and ate some cream of chicken soup...yumm. Than after the delicious soup i looked up all the songs i needed to learn for our band practice and i learned 4 in 20 minutes!! thats pretty good conisdering how much i lack in smartness:) So anywho after i pracitced i sat in my room and talked on the computer Spencer and i told him to rip Jc Superska off his brand new Skavenjah cd. So he did so and sent it to me and i actually just finished listening to it!! So after that i had to go to band practice so i walked there and it was raining.. i love the rain it smells good:) So i get to Adams house and we went into his computer room and i watched him and Mike play Stick RPG or something like that and it was funny because its a stick figure and u have to make moneyu and stuff and u can get drunk, buy cocaine, get into bar fights and rob the conveinance store or bank. So we finished playing that aand went downstairs to set up our equipment and than Bryce finally showed up and so practice went on!!! so we practiced and practiced and got every song down and than we had to think of more songs to play since we are playing a show at mikes dads birthday party on july 2nd. So after we picked a few songs which includes "I'm A Believer" Adam asked if we wanted pizza but we didnt have money so i went home and Bryce went home and Mike and Adam stayed at his house and ate pizza. So i went home and ate and bryce called me to watch Halloween 4 but instead we picked out Scream (courtesy of Jungle Jims Video)gotta love JJ video! Me and Bryce than went to kleins and i bought a Hersheys Smore's bar and a slurpee and than we went to Bryces house. I found out that Hersheys Smore's bars are not great at all so i gave mine to bryce and the other one to his brother Brendon. We watched the movie and it was pretty cool and than we watched the rest of family guy and it was funny. After all that t.v. watchin we went downstairs and played some N64 and first we played Tony Hawk Pro Skater and realized that the t.v. was really crappy and we could barely see so instead we played Goldeneye 007. I beat the poop out of Bryce because of my great 007 skills. When the score reached somewhere around 17-4 for me i saw that it was time to go home so i got Bryce to take me to the door and i got on my scooter and scootered home. Now im here telling all of you what happened tonight and im going to bed so good night all!!  *-*Matty*-*

      Well tonight was a beaut! Me and Spencer went to see Skavenjah and The Kingpins!!!! Skavenjah won my vote for best band at that show because they were way more energetic!!! Well first off i'll tell you all what happened. Me and Spencer went there at 8 and no one was there so we went to A&B sound to look around. Spencer was playing with a cd deck that i thought was gonna start working on the stereo so i left him to play with it. We went to the video cameras and Spencer thought he would be smart and pointed one of them at the t.v's that were playing Finding Nemo so people who looked at the camera would think it was playing a movie:) haha what a kidder he is. So anywho after we did that he went to the weird vending machine in A&B sound..... your probably thinking what im thinking *why would A&B sound have a vending machine* well the answer is... i have no idea. Now we were walking back and...oooooo i forgot to tell you about when we were walking there. We were leaving and i turned the corner and started skipping singing "were off to see the wizard" haha and people in a car started laughing at me. But o yah we were walking back and we had fun because we were walking back hehe. So back to the show. We sat inside and threw a bouncy ball Spencer had to eachother and it kept falling and Spencer kept getting it. Finally i went to throw it at him and he missed... well he didnt know i was throwing it haha;) and so it rolls under a girls foot so he says he'll wait till she moves to get it and than the girl stands up, notices the ball, and than picks it up and stuffs it in her pocket... hahahaha that was so funny. While we were sitting at the table we were thinking of what ska people would be called and i remembered from some website that they were called SKAnks so we know call ourselves SKAnks lol. it was fun. But yah thats pretty much everything that happened tonight and im about to go to bed so good night everyone!!  *-*Matty*-*

      Well fellow friends of mine troday was another great and wonderful day. it started off as usual with failing my math test which is no surprise:) and than I went to lunch with Graham, Jamie, Ryan Wild and David Whelan. We went to Pizza Hut and i ate a whopping 7 pieces of pizza!!! i was so full after that(no sarcasm intended). As we were coming back to school from that we saw a cop car with his lights on and he zoomed by which was kind of amusing! So anyway when we got back I went to science class and we watched a movie "Cyclone" it was amusing because it had tornadoes and hurricanes!! So when science class was over me and Spencer were talking about how cool it would be if we had an edo in gym class ans as luck would have it we did have an edo which was really weird. Now we were walking to our lockers and we were talking about how cool Skavenjah will be tonight and we had fun talking about that than out of complete nowhere Spencer found one of the mini Skavenjah advertising posters i had made on the ground by our lockers!!! It was scary because that was the second "sign" we had within like 2 minutes of the other. My theory is that the girl i have a crush on will actually have a secret crush on me due to all those "signs" taking place and we actually find out and than we start going out!!! Wow that would be awesome.... i hope it happens. But back to Skavenjah. So tonight me and Spencer are going to Skavenjah (a local ska band) and i hope we hae tons of fun because ska is so fun and happy and yah. oooo i almost forgot about when me and Spencer went to Co-Op in 5th. So we went to Co-op and i was wanting to go look at the toys and before we got there we got our 3rd "sign". The sign was water guns for 8 bucks!!!!! so we each bought ourselves a water gun and filled them up and were squirting things outside and Mr. Allen told us we couldnt spray anymore so we waited for the bell and i got owned by Spencer. i am completely soaked and still am as im typing this blog! Well anywho im finished yackin about what happened today, cant wait to blog my experience i will have tonight! later.  *-*Matty*-*

      Well today is a good day sort of. I have no idea what blogs are but since a bunch of my friends have them i thought why the heck not, am i right?? I kind of started a crush on someone but i can't tell anyone who it is because it's a secret:) Well i might as well tell you guys what happened tonight. First off: I came home and talked on msn as usual i talked with Erin and she told he what her blog's URL was so i looked at it and that made me want to make mine!! Second thing: i was talking with Erin and than boom the doorbell rings, "who could it be" I thought to myself. As luck has it, it was my wonderful uncle Kenny who was picking me up to go to lovely work! Unfortunately we were tearing down a garage in pooring rain for 3 hours straight and i feel like crapola. Third thing: I went to blogspot.com and started up my own blog and now i am here saying "saying". See i just said what i said but i didnt.... do you get it? neither do I:S But anywho im gonna publish this beast of a post because its the longest thing i've ever wrote in my life. Wow this is longer than any report i've ever did without any plagerism!!! But yah bye bye yals       *-*Matty*-*  ooo P.S. the reason why i'm calling myself matty on this is because i think girls think its cute!!
