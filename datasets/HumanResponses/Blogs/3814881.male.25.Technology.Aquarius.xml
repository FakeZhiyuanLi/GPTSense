        One of the things that is interesting to note with regards to the homosexual marriage agenda is the justifications that proponents make in their minds.  Homosexuality is considered to be genetic, something that one cannot control.  Given the presuppositions then that most Americans hold, there is no reason that the cannot take part in family and society in the same way that heterosexuals can.  In fact, to discriminate against a homosexual because of their biological urges goes against the American virtues of equality (or bland sameness) and individualism (or freedom from societal responsibilities).    To many Americans, these arguments are persuasive.  That's why so much of the battle is fought over whether homosexuality is genetic (to which I respond "Who cares?").  If homosexuality is in fact genetic, then our virtues dictate that we accept it in the public square.  After all, they're not hurting anyone, right?    And therein lies the problem, and the point of this post.  Our problem as a people, and especially in the Church, is that our  virtues need repented of .  And this is great difficulty we have, and that men have always had apart from the grace of God.  We cling to our sins not because we hate ourselves or want to openly defy God, but because we think they're our virtues.  The Pharisees thought they were serving God when they crucified Christ.  They made long prayers for a pretense, and their condemnation was all the greater.  So it goes with us.  We keep certain sins around that we know to be vices, and we fight against them to assuage our consciences.  But our wicked virtues are the sins that bring the judgment of God upon us, because we refuse to repent of them.    We must let this knowledge guide us as we seek reformation in our lives and churches.  We must pray that God would show us where we have sinned and how we cling to our stubborn sins, and then be willing to repent of them when we see them.  And we should start by looking to our virtues first.

        Here's an observation from John to explore.  In my study we've spent two weeks now looking at ways that chapter five (the lame man healed at the Sheep Pool) and chapter nine (blind man healed at the Temple) correspond and contrast.  Here's one for further reflection.    The locations involved in the two stories are opposed as the plot unfolds.  The lame man is found outside the city to the north by Jesus, healed, and then encountered again inside the Temple.  The blind man is found near the Temple (Jesus is on his way out from nearly being stoned), healed, and then encountered again somewhere near the Pool of Siloam, almost outside the city to the south.    A couple of interpretations present themselves.  First, we must remember that the blind man conducts himself with faith in the Christ as the Pharisees interrogate him.  He is rewarded by Jesus in hearing who the Christ is and believing.  The lame man doesn't have much faith at all and is warned by Jesus to "stop sinning or something worse will happen to you."  Remembering this, it becomes evident that the miracles of Christ combining with faith move you closer to the Living Water, while scorning His works through disbelief will remove you from it.  It was the blind man who got into the pool through faith and the hearing and obeying of Jesus' word.    And the converse has implications too.  Jesus is taking His disciples out of the Temple, for it will soon be destroyed.  The old covenant is perishing because of the disbelief of its members.  The lame man winds up in the Temple, suitable for destruction because of his disbelief.  The blind man is thrown out, but that is a blessing because the Temple is not long for the world.

        One of my friends pointed out something interesting in regards to the Pharisees of old, and got me thinking.  I'll steal the idea and run with it a little bit.  (Thanks Bonnie!)    It's difficult for us to appreciate historical figures for who they really were, instead of for who the texts make them out to be.  For instance, we love the prophets and hate the Pharisees.  What could be more intuitive than that?  Most likely though, if we were alive in the day of Elijah or John the Baptist and weren't experiencing the story through the intrepretation of an author we'd feel a little different.  We'd be quite inclined to join up with the Pharisees, conservative, traditional-values sorts that they were.  And hearing the prophets speak would be quite a shock for our Victorian sensibilities.  Not to mention that they'd be attacking us, most likely.    This is why we build the tombs of the prophets whom our ancestors killed and then say "If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have taken part with them in the shedding of the blood of the prophets".

        The reformed doctrine of the sovereignty of God teaches us that he does all things.  That means that when something happens, God has done it.  But He does not just ordain the end, but the means as well.  And He has designed the world so that He does things best through certain ways.    Here's an example.  When God wants to make bread, how does He do it?  Countless of millions of times, He has done it by ordaining a farmer to plant seed in the ground, blessing that seed to sprout and grow, having that farmer harvest it, and causing a baker to mix the proper ingredients and bake it.  Several times in history He has eliminated some of these steps and done it by what we might call a "miracle".  Jesus with the four and five thousands come to mind.    But as we pray to God for our daily bread, we would do best to look for Him to answer through the established channels- by going to the supermarket, for example.  Finding our bread there does not mean that we have provided it and God has not, or that the mundaneness of the answer to our prayers makes it any less miraculous.  Gratitude and belief should never be conditioned on the "supernatural" quality of God's work.  All of His work is both natural and supernatural at once.    Furthermore, we should seek to understand the means God has ordained for the end we want to pursue.  Attempting to work to an end contrary to God's means is foolishness, and asking God to bless it is arrogance.  Implications?  Youth ministry and education should be done primarily by parents.  Evangelism should be through worldview advancement.  Cultural reformation should be accomplished through repentance and reformation in the Church.

        Last Sunday I took some friends up north to the Quehanna Wild Area to hike to a scenic waterfall.  On the way in and out, we saw this huge bull elk.  I've seen him three separate times now, including twice this year.  As far as I can tell, he's an 11x9.  The only ones I've ever seen have been in Pennsylvania (except one in a park in Colorado), but this is by far the biggest I've ever heard of.  Below are some pictures for your enjoyment.

        I have some questions.    Could God use me to change someone's life?  To bring someone to Himself?  Could He use me to teach someone something they didn't know before?    Could God use me to write a computer program?  To cut the grass?  Clip my fingernails?  Could He use me to write a science fiction novel?  How about to read one?    Thank you.

        I've gone back and forth on whether or not Jesus breaks the Sabbath when He performs miracles in the Gospel of John. His defense is not exactly clarifying ("My Father is working until now, and I myself am working", 5:17).  Specifically, I've wondered whether telling a man to carry his mat around (John 5), or having his disciples pick grain on the Sabbath is legit.  Not sure.    But either way, Jesus gives us a good example of Christian liberty in action, as well as the true meaning of the Sabbath. In chapter five, we find a man who has been lying on the ground, outside of the city for 38 years. He wants to get into the Sheep Pool in order to be healed, but cannot since he is lame. Jesus heals him without the use of the water, and commands him to take up his mat and go free.    The man stands symbolically for the generation of the Jews who continue to wander in the wilderness like the generation of the Exodus. The 38 years remind us of the wilderness wanderings, as well as his position outside of the city. Jesus brings Sabbath to this man by doing what water (standing for the Old Covenant in John) cannot do- give him rest and celebration by bringing him into the City. Jesus is showing us that the Sabbath is fulfilled by being able to enter the city and join the celebration, which He gives to us.    And if Jesus does do it contrary to Old Testament commands, then he uses his freedom from the Law to bless others and give grace. We are not free to ignore the Sabbath to treat it like every other day, but we are free to give grace and rest to others and thus fulfill it.

        John's Gospel focuses a great deal on the struggle between Jesus and the Jewish leaders.  The Jews accuse Jesus of breaking the Law, especially in regards to the Sabbath (5:18, 9:28-29).  Jesus claims to be above the Law, because God is His Father (5:18), He is the author of it (8:6-8), and He is greater than Moses anyway.  But I think He also turns around the argument to show how the Jews are not keeping the law either.  There's some obvious passages that point to this, like chapter eight where Jesus tells the Jews that lying and murder is not the behavior of someone who loves God through faith.    Here's another idea I had though, which is still in its formative stages.  I'm thinking that John makes a point of showing how the Jews break each of the Ten Commandments.  I haven't figured all ten out yet, but some of the similarities so far as striking.    1.  "You shall have no other gods before Me." - This is the main problem with the Jews throughout the book.  The passage I would choose to illustrate this at its most blatant is 19:15, when the Jews proclaim "We have no king but Caesar".  This sin is everywhere though, since Jesus is the Son of God and the Jews reject Him.    2. "You shall not make for yourself an idol..." - I'm not sure about this one yet.    3. "You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain..." - Not sure.    4. "Observe the Sabbath day and keep it holy..." - This is a major theme of the conflict in chapter 5.  The Jews say that Jesus does not honor the Sabbath, but a careful study of the passage shows that Jesus is the one who honors it by bringing rest, celebration and salvation.  The Jews prefer the wilderness wanderings instead of Sabbath rest, and set themselves against Jesus' right interpretation.    5. "Honor your father and your mother..." - Maybe the Jew's sin is that they are good at honoring their real father, the devil.  They lie and murder because that's what he does (8:44).  They claim that Abraham is their father, but they do not do his works (8:37-39).    6. "You shall not murder." - The Jews try repeatedly and succeed in killing Jesus.  They also try to kill Lazarus after he's raised from the dead (12:10).  The Jews are murderers because their father the devil is a murderer too (8:44).    7. "You shall not commit adultery." - It seems like Jesus is accusing the Jews of this sin in the story of the woman caught in adultery (8:1-11).  The Jews bring her in on charges to test Jesus, but something funny is going on since this is the first time in recorded history where a single person was caught in the act of adultery.  The Jews, if not directly involved with this woman, realize their guilt when Jesus asks for someone to cast the first stone.    8. "You shall not steal." - Not sure.  Perhaps this is connected to making the temple into a "house of robbers" (2:16, Matt 21:13), or demanding the release of Barabbas, a robber (18:40).    9. "You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor." - This is how the Jews get Jesus convicted, by lying about what He said.  They are liars because their father is the devil (8:44,55).    10. "You shall not covet your neighbor's wife..." - Not sure.

        If you're looking at older entries here, they may look a little jumbled for the time being.  I changed the layout so that it's easier for me to type these in, and they look better to my perfectionist eye.  Thing is though, I need to go back through the older posts and fix the formatting now to look correct.  So please pardon the entries that look like one long paragraph.

        Here's some food for thought courtesy of  urlLink Doug Wilson .  He commented on these two passages in a recent sermon.&nbsp; First, famous stuff from II Cor 10:3-4:    For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh, for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses.    Most interpret this passage to say that Christians don't fight with guns or swords, but with "spiritual" weapons like prayer and singing.  Very good.  Now consider Hebrews 11:32-34:    And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets, who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions, quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight.    Notice the contradiction between the interpretation of the first passage and the second.  Did Samson fight by faith?  Yes.  Did Samson fight in the Spirit?  Yes.  (Here's a good word study- count how many times the Holy Spirit is associated with Samson in Judges.  Then count all the times it's associated with anybody else in the OT).  Did Samson fight with real, physical weapons?  Yes.  Many of them, including his bare hands.  So did all the rest of the faith heroes listed here.    We have been conditioned to think of the "spiritual" as the invisible and immaterial, but that is not true.  The spiritual is the material powered by faith.

        Regarding mystical pietism, I'll throw in another one.&nbsp; Take Galatians 2:20:    I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.    Where does this passage say that we must "stay connected" to God in order to have Christ live in us?  Where is the command to pray and meditate?  Where is any command in this passage?    Christians have a difficult time telling the difference between the indicative and the imperative: the statement of fact and the command.  Call it the Pharisee in all of us.  But there is no command here, it is a statement of truth.  There is no effort involved in being crucified to the world.  That happened 2000 years ago for us.  There is also no effort involved in having Christ live in me.  That happens by grace through faith.

        Jesus exhorts His disciples to "remain in Him" repeatedly in John 15. He says that He is the true vine, and that the Christian is to remain attached to Him and be fruitful.&nbsp; This is taken to mean that we should stay connected to God, through prayer and Bible study, and this is where we draw the power to bear fruit in the world.&nbsp; Powerless Christians got that way by not spending time in prayer with God, and trusting in themselves and their own power.&nbsp; Preachers draw many applications from this interpretation, and much of evangelical piety is built on it.    Those preachers then need to perform an amazing set of exegetical gymnastics to get around verse six. &nbsp;"If anyone does not abide in Me, he is thrown away as a branch and dries up; and they gather them, and cast them into the fire and they are burned".&nbsp; Continuing the argument from the first five verses, Jesus is saying that if we're not spending enough time praying and meditating, we are in danger of going to hell. This is a false gospel and heresy.&nbsp; So, it is explained that being cut off and cast into the fire doesn't mean hell, it just means trials and tribulations for the sake of purification. But we know that the Bible means one thing and one thing only when it talks about the danger of being taken away and thrown into the fire.&nbsp; We all know what&nbsp;happens when branches are thrown into fires.&nbsp; Pruning and purification do take place, but Jesus says they happen while attached to the vine.     The problem is the pietistic interpretation of verses 1-5.&nbsp; We are to remain in Jesus in the same way we got into Him in the first place- by grace expressing itself through faith (Gal 3:1-3, Eph 2:8).&nbsp; This means continuing to hold our confession, continuing to meet with the saints in worship, and&nbsp;enduring persecution and suffering for the sake of the Gospel.&nbsp; Those who turn away from these things and deny their confession without repentance  will &nbsp;be thrown into the fire of hell to be burned up.&nbsp; Those who&nbsp;have been called out of the world into the&nbsp;Church and who remain in faith will&nbsp;endure to the end and produce much fruit.     And as always, it seems like a nit-picking until you consider the importance of these ideas and their consequences.&nbsp; Religion empowered by spiritual piousness does not just end with frustrated and doubting souls, but with monstrous sins of the flesh (Gal 5:16-24).&nbsp; Ideas always have consequences.&nbsp; And here's the test- what sort of fruit has this mystical pietism produced in lives in the last 150 years it's been en vogue?&nbsp; What sort of fruit has it produced in the Church?

        Take a look at this passage- Galatians 5:19-23:    Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.  But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.    What I find interesting about this passage is that it comes toward the end of Paul's argument against why the first-century Judaizers are incorrect.  In a nutshell, the Judaizers wanted fresh Christian converts from the Gentiles to be circumcized and to take up the vestiges of the Mosaic Law, primarily to avoid persecution.  Paul writes to rebuke this train of thought and to encourage the Gentiles to avoid trusting in circumcision (or uncircumcision), and to remain in the Spirit by faith.    And then Paul hits us with this list of sins, the "fruit of the flesh" if you will, and the contrasting "fruit of the Spirit".  In context, the argument is this:  if you buy into what the Judaizers are telling you and get circumcized, this is what your fruit will look like - immorality, sensuality, etc.  If you hold to correct doctrine in faith, Paul says, your fruit will look like love, joy and all the rest.    The point is this: doctrine and correct theology matters.  We must not separate matters of Christianity in "head and heart", as if you could live correctly while believing lies.  Theology always works itself out, given enough time.  A man always reaps what he sows.

        A few posts back ("Pop Culture Storytelling") I made some comments concerning Individualism.  After discussion, I think it would be helpful to clarify a little bit what I mean by that.  So here goes.    Individualism is the belief that the world (and specifically things religious) function in terms of the single unit, the individual.  It is the idea that people rise and fall on their own, sin on their own, believe on their own, and interact with God on their own.  "Me alone" is the secular version, and "Just Me and God" is the religious version.  Individualists can't imagine confessing the sin of the group, taking part in the judgment of the group, or coming to God to worship as a group.  Individualism is a fundamental American assumption that influences much of our thinking.    Of course, Individualism is wrong and sinful, and has terrible consequences in our lives, as do all false beliefs.  People are designed to live in community, and find meaning and importance and fulfillment in relationships.  We know this is true because we see that God Himself is not an individual, but the Three-in-One, the Eternal Community.  God is not "satisfied in Himself", because He (the Father) is not alone.   This is Trinitarianism, the only satisfactory worldview for life on earth.

        Here's another interesting episode from our fun Sunday School chat yesterday.  We looked at the antidote to the fear of man in the Scriptures- fear of the living God.  I believe that's why David mentions his vows to God in Psalm 56:12.  Anyway, I connected a few passages to the fear of the Lord, including Ecclesiastes 5:1-7, which mentions fear, God, prayer and vows repeatedly.  In it, Solomon commands us to keep quiet when we go to God's house, because He is up in heaven, and we are here on earth.  I also pointed out Matthew 10:28 where Jesus commands us to keep it short when we pray as well, and not to be like the Gentiles, who think they'll be heard for their many words.    Hands shot up like fireworks all across the classroom, naturally.  "But God is our Abba, and he wants to hear what concerns us!"  "But we should bring our feelings to God, even if we don't know what we're feeling!"  "But I don't always know what I'm praying about when I start praying!".  It's like these passages were traditions of men or something.    Anyway, the most coherent argument against being sparse and careful with your words in the presence of the Lord was that God is our Heavenly Father, and cares about what we care about.  This is obviously true.  What I would like to ask (and then answer in the next paragraph) is why that truth means we should feel free to gush before God, and not think carefully about what we say to Him in an attitude of fear and respect.    And like a lot of things, I think it comes back to our failures as fathers in Christian families.  Too many Christians believe that the two options for fatherhood are 1) hard, stern and cruel, or 2) soft, indulgent and sentimental.  We all know number one is not the right option, so we aim for number two, and think that that must be the character of the Lord.  Think of every picture of Jesus you've ever seen in a children's Sunday School classroom that doesn't contain the cross.    But as others have posited, number two is just as wicked and ungodlike as number one.  God is not an indulgent Father, but instead He disciplines us in godliness to show his love (Heb 12).  He is indeed the Father from whom all Fatherhood derives its name (Eph 3:15).  Therefore we should treat passages like Eccl. 5 and Matthew 10:28 not as seeming contradictions to our ideal of fatherhood, but helpful passages to teach us how to be (and treat) fathers here on earth.

        I left the last post regarding David's actions in Psalm 56 hanging, quite intentionally, until I had finished my studying and taught my Sunday School class last weekend.  Truth be told, I left the class hanging too, because the topic of the talk was geared more towards prayer and the sentiments in the Psalm rather than an exposition of I Sam 21.    However, since I posed the dilemma between David's apparent lack of trust in the Lord and his recorded sentiments in the Psalm, I'd like to offer up my solution.  Working from the evident first, I believe the Psalm to be inspired, useful and true.  The Scriptures command us to sing and speak the Psalms, not just the nice ones or the ones unconnected to any apparent sin.  David was not engaged in blatant hypocrisy when he wrote.  Therefore it remains to defend David's actions before Achish.    As with all Old Testament Bible Stories, this one is a type of Christ's story fulfilled in the Gospels.  David is consecrated in the tabernacle with a meal of the holy showbread, takes up the sword of the enemy (Goliath), and appears before the pagan king in the foreign land in exile.  There, he defeats the pagan king prophetically (in anticipation for the victories he will accomplish later when he has become king) through deception and self-abasement.  The antitype for this episode is Christ's humiliation and defeat, and subsequent deception of Satan through the Victory of the Cross.  This episode is played out a number of times through the Old Testament: think Abraham and Isaac with their wives before the pagan kings and Jacob with his father and Esau's blessing.  Each time deceit was used on a pagan tyrant to bring about his downfall (or prophesy it) and bless the deceiver.    And so the immediate response of nearly everyone is to cry "But lying is a sin!".  No, it's not (necessarily).  But why does it matter?  Who says the point of I Sam 21 is to give us an example of good or bad behavior?

        I've started reading Psalm 56 this week in preparation for this week's Sunday School class.  I'm not ready to post an outline yet, but early returns so far suggest that it's going to be a lot of fun.  The Psalm's prescript connects it with "When David was captured by the Philistines in Gath", which occurs in I Sam 21:10-15.  The Psalm is David's expression of trust in God while experiencing fear of his enemies, and a call for God to put them down.    The fun part is going to be harmonizing the Psalm with the I Sam passage.  In that passage, when David is brought before Achish, King of the Philistines, he pretends to be insane, scribbling on the walls of the city and drooling in his beard.  Achish sends him away, because he says he has enough crazies around.  David is thus spared by his deception from being killed or enslaved.    Here's the problem then- if this story is designed to fit with our nice traditional value morals, it has to condemn David for his lies and deceptions and lack of faith in God.  But if it does that, then Psalm 56 stinks to heaven of hypocrisy and is useless for Christians.  There must be something bigger going on in the story, and if Psalm 56 is inspired and useful for us, we must interpret that story in a way that leads to David's vindication.  More to come.

        For most modern evangelical Christians, good Biblical exegesis is nothing more than 1) getting at the "moral" of the story (i.e. don't lie) or 2) identifying with the Biblical character ("how does this make you feel?").  Historical Biblical exegesis has centered on the story, looking at the beauty of the narrative unfolding from Genesis through Acts, and attempting to see what God is doing at any given point by revealing His Christ.  Moderns in the grip of the sin of individualism have a hard time seeing the larger story, something greater than themselves.    Now consider modern pop culture, specifically pop music.  Why does our culture lack so desperately for great story tellers?  Pop music is nothing but an endless stream of broken romances, angsty feelings, or trite love-ditties.  Hollywood Country musicians still tell stories, but they are usually hollow and moralistic, teaching us that patriotism is a fine sentiment, or what goes around comes around.  And the contemporary Christian offering seems to mimic the rest of it, replacing the angst and despair with sentimental and romantic goo.    What's interesting to me is that this didn't seem to be the case a generation ago.  Pop musicians knew how to tell stories.  Simon and Garfunkel, while being thoroughly modern and humanistic, told gripping stories in their songs.  Country stars like Johnny Cash and Merle Haggard made a living off it, telling us stories of low-lives and jailbirds.  And my favorite writer of the era, Robert Hunter (primarily with the Grateful Dead) came up with all kinds of colorful characters, set throughout American history.    Perhaps the fundamental humanism and despair of the storytellers of the 60's led to our modern introspection, but I like to think that our individualistic exegesis must have contributed as well.  Or perhaps our individualism has driven both our exegesis and our storytelling.

        Later manuscripts of the Gospel of John add 7:53-8:11, the story of the woman caught in adultery.  I've always taught that story as being part of the Gospel, because it picks up and advances a number of themes that are being developed at that point:  Jesus' judgment of the Jewish leaders according to the Law of Moses, Jesus being greater than Moses, and Jesus being greater than the Temple.    If you take it out though, the story goes from the end of seven, where the Jewish leaders are arguing about Jesus' place of origin.  "Search, and see that no prophet arises out of Galilee."  (7:52).  Skipping through to 8:12, Jesus' response is "I am the Light of the world; he who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life."  Now consider Isaiah 9:1-2:    But there will be no more gloom for her who was in anguish; in earlier times He treated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali with contempt, but later on He shall make it glorious, by the way of the sea, on the other side of Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles.  The people who walk in darkness will see a great light; those who live in a dark land, the light will shine on them.   J   Jesus would rather be seen as "Mighty God" and "Prince of Peace" than merely a prophet.

        Here's a good lyric, courtesy of John Denver:    All my memories gathered round her Miner’s lady, stranger to blue water Dark and dusty, painted on the sky Misty taste of moonshine Teardrops in my eye Country roads, take me home...    The steel guitar joins in on this verse (the second), and it really gets me when it picks up the melody in the chorus along with the vocal.  It's very understated and surprisingly unlike the standard steel guitar solo.  Almost makes you forget the blatant Darwinism in the first verse.    And another thing... I'm really glad "Pennsylvania" has the same number of syllables as "West Virginia" so I can sing more appropriately and from the heart.

        Hi everyone.  I just got finished with another reading of J.R.R. Tolkein's classic.  I read the stories for the first time in the fourth grade, and then every year after that until some time in high school.  Reading it for the first time since I saw The Movies, I really regret having watched them.  I can't help but picture that greasy guy every time I read about Strider.    Here's a couple of observations I made.  All of these should be read with the understanding that the LOTR is not allegory (according to Tolkein).  Anyway, I noticed that heroes in the story experience death and resurrection scenes involving caves before they accomplish their great deeds.  Gandalf struggles with the Balrog in the depths of Moria and dies for a time.  Frodo "dies" after being stung by Shelob in the cave at Cirith Ungol.  And although he doesn't "die" in any real way, Aragorn walks the Paths of the Dead (through a cave) to summon the oathbreakers.  Just as in Biblical imagery, man's death is symbolized by the cave, because he came from dust and is returning there.  Man then rises again to new life, transformed from Grey into White, or from Ranger into King.     I think there's a difference in the way Scripture protrays the results of this death and resurrection though.  In the Gospel story, Jesus' very death and resurrection is the heroic accomplishment.  When Jesus leaves His cave, there's nothing left to accomplish except to ascend and send the Holy Spirit.  In LOTR though, it seems like the death and resurrection is only preparatory to the real accomplishments of the hero's life.  Gandalf rises again to become the White, lead the defense of Gondor and counsel the attack on the gates of Mordor.  Aragorn must win the Battle of Pelennor Fields and then ride with the hosts to Mordor (there's room for argument with him).  And Frodo of course must complete the journey to Mount Doom with the Ring.  Perhaps Tolkein saw the death and resurrection experience as being a precursor to heroics- a shedding of the old self in preparation for the new.  This seems to be different from the Scriptural pattern where the death to self is the heroic deed.    Here's another brief observation, and I have to confess not having a clear memory for some of the details.  In order to gain the One Ring, Isildur had to cut off Sauron's finger (or maybe several fingers, or a hand, I can't remember).  This is very similar to how Frodo must give up the Ring at the end- by losing a finger to Gollum.  Does this mean that Frodo has become like Sauron because of the Ring, or that he must become like him to destroy it?

        John tells us in the introduction to his Gospel that the Word "became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory" (1:14).  One of the ways that John conveys that experience to the reader is by describing how Jesus engages all five of the reader's senses.  Here's how.    Seeing and hearing are two main themes in the book.  Jesus is, after all, both the Word and the Light (1:1-5).  Hearing the Son of God leads to resurrection (5:28-29), it identifies His sheep (10:4), and it identifies those who are not (8:43).  It even brings about new sight for those who believe, as it did for the blind man in Jerusalem (9:1-7).  Sight is important in that chapter, with those who are blind starting to see, and those who think they can see being revealed to be blind (9:41).  There's other important seeing examples in the book, with the most important probably being 14:9 - "He who has seen Me has seen the Father".    The next three aren't as pervasive as sight and hearing, but do appear in strategic places.  We're told in a few places that belief in Jesus involves "eating" Him, for His flesh is true food and His blood true drink (6:55).  We're not explicitly told what He tastes like, but we're given an example earlier when Jesus turns the Old Covenant water into New Covenant wine.  Indeed, the headwaiter at the feast praised the groom for its excellent taste- "You have kept the best until now" (2:10).    Then there's two smell passages that come juxtaposed in chapters 11 and 12.  Mary fears that when Jesus rolls away the stone from her dead brother's tomb that it will stink, but that does not happen because Lazarus is quite alive (11:39,44).  Then in 12 Mary pours her expensive perfume on Jesus to anoint Him for His death, and the whole house is filled with the fragrance (12:3).  (These two smells obviously highlight a connection between the passages that should and will be developed elsewhere).    And the most intimate sense, touch, is the key experience for Thomas at the end of the Gospel.  When Thomas encounters Jesus face to face, he is commanded to put his hands in Jesus' hands and side and feel that Jesus is indeed alive and not a ghost (20:27-28).  Having done so, Thomas exclaims "My Lord and My God!", the climax of the book.

        Hi all.  I've been leading some local twenty-somethings through an indepth study of the Gospel of John for about five months now.  This is actually the sixth time I've been involved in a good inductive study through the book, and I've started to accumulate a mass of materials.  I've jokingly said a few times that if I were to turn my notes into prose, I'd have my first book.    Only one problem:  since the first four of those studies were in college, working with the semester time frame, and the other two haven't gone much longer, my notes get pretty sparse after about chapter 12.  How interesting would a commentary be on only 54.5% of a book?  Not very.  I'll keep the notes as is.    But I will put up some interesting observations on here from time to time.

        This is my first attempt at the blog.  Just a few introductory comments about what I hope to accomplish here are in order.  I'm looking forward to an online forum for publishing some observations I make now and then.  More specifically, observations regarding Biblical Studies, books and music I enjoy, and the good life in Central Pennsylvania.  I'm going to try very hard to avoid allowing this to become an online diary or to succumb to "lonely soulism".  I'm not that interesting of a person.    I hope you don't mind if I indulge myself every once in a while and share stories of some of my adventures though.  More of a "(b)log" than a diary, if you would.

        In John 10:23, John records that Jesus was walking in the Temple courts in the winter.  He's already established in the previous verse that he's moved to a new time frame, starting with the Feast of Dedication.  Why then mention the winter?    I think it connects us to Solomon's dedication of the Temple, for that took place in the seventh month (December, if my facts are straight).  Solomon, being the Son of God that he was, is a player in the discussion that ensues, and even gets mentioned once in 10:23.  Jesus is dedicating a new Temple and moving in, the Temple of His Body, the Church.  He's going to raise Lazarus and then deal with the public for just a little bit more before concentrating on His disciples through the last nine chapters.    I think it's doing a little more though.  One of the things Jesus is doing in this section is showing Himself to be the Greater Prophet.  There's lots of Ezekiel and Jeremiah connections, and I think this is one.  In Jeremiah 36, Jeremiah writes a scroll through his scribe Baruch and sends it to be read in the presence of Jehoiakim the King of Judah.  Jehoiakim will not listen and burns the scroll, and God tells Jeremiah that his line will be cut off.  All this takes place in the ninth month, while Jehoiakim is at his winter house (Jer 36:22).    And that is what is going on with the Jews in the Temple in John 10.  They have rejected Jesus and His signs, and shown that they do not love the Lord.  They are prophesied for destruction when Jesus levels the city and Temple.  We should notice that He removes Himself from the Temple for good at the end of the chapter, never to return (at least in John's account).  The wicked Jews have worshipped their idols long enough, and now God is moving out of His winter home to a new home.  But the spring will not dawn for these Jews.

        I love my little town.  And my little town loves its Fair.  We were visited yet again last week, and I made my first and second trips.  I'm practically obliged to, since I get a half day holiday to go.    My favorite part was definitely the parade.  Although people will complain about how many fire trucks there were, or schools of little twirler-girls, or that it happened to be three and a half hours long, no one is ever in a bad mood while it's going on.  The best was either the "Rollerettes" (the souped-up twirlers on roller skates with accompanying First-Aid van) or the tractors.  Yes, I'm a sucker for a big red Super-M.    The Fair itself was great too.  There's more good food than you could ever eat in a single week (or afford).  Concerts (although I didn't go to any, Clay Aiken's not my type), rides and games too.  I really enjoyed the exhibits- pictures and produce and floral arrangements and every barnyard animal.  But I think the best is that for one week out of the year, everyone is gathered in merry-making and rejoicing, even thanking the Lord for what He has done in the last year and that we all come back for another ride on the Ferris Wheel.  It's probably the closest thing we have to a Christian Festival, where the lemonade and cheesesteaks overflow.

        Pardon me while I gush.    Brad Paisley's got a (relatively) new song out called "Whiskey Lullaby".  In it, he laments a broken relationship that ends with a deadly drinking binge.  "He put the bottle to his head and pulled the trigger".  He ends the first chorus with recounting the funeral under the Willow Tree, where the angels show up to sing their Whiskey Lullaby.    And if you wondered what that sounded like, an angel shows up to sing one in the next verse.  By "angel" I mean Allison Krauss.  Not much difference, at least musically.  There has never been a song that she's sung that didn't make you want to stare out the window.    And what's even better, she's teamed up with Jerry Douglas, my new favorite guitar player.  He's in the background on WL, whipping out some solemn and profound licks.  It took a few weeks of eating up his work to get him to number one status, but there it is.  Jerry Garcia, Trey Anastasio, Steve Kimock, step aside.  He's got all the technical ability you could want, always brings out the melody, and is country through and through.  And he doesn't even play a guitar, but a Dobro.

        Hi all!  More adventures from the great wild North to report on.  I went back to my waterfall stream in the Quehanna Wild Area for some fishing.  Since I was alone (I've learned that I should only try this on my own, since some people consider recreation at my intensity a little less than restful), I hiked from the top of the mountain to the river, and fished my way back up.  Took four hours, but I caught thirty-five trout, and managed to catch my limit of nice fat brookies.  The nicest is posted below.    And on the way out, I saw my elk again.  He's an 11x11, just a gorgeous creature.  And I saw a bobcat and an eight-point whitetail.  Is it fall yet?      urlLink       urlLink

        Not so long ago, I wrote in about Christian liberty and the Sabbath, and made the comment that I wasn't sure whether or not Jesus kept the Sabbath as required by the Old Testament.  After doing some reading, I'd like to offer some new insight into that question and officially make up my mind.    In a word, He did not.  This is very important question, because it has implications regarding covenant theology, the importance of the Law, and other things.  So, I officially think that He kept the Sabbath not only according to His own standards, but according to the Word of God revealed to Moses (as if they were different).    My decision has been based on some very interesting commentary on the Gospel of Mark by Mark Horne (see  urlLink The Victory According to Mark ).  He looks at the famous story of the disciples picking grain on the Sabbath, and how Jesus claims that He, being the Son of Man, is also the Lord of the Sabbath (Mark 2:27-28).  In a nutshell, there is nothing contradictory with the Old Testament Sabbath Law in this story except the Pharisees' interpretation.

        One interesting thing we've seen this time around is that a good number of the famous stories in John (especially in chapters 5-12) come in the context of attacking the Jews.  Jesus teaches about the Good Shepherd in chapter 10 as a response to a question from the Jews: "Are we blind too?".  His episode with the woman caught in adultery (8:1-11) comes sandwiched in between arguments with the Jews, and furthers the debate.  Why is all this arguing necessary?  Why doesn't John just teach us about Jesus for who He is?    Here's an answer I'd like to propose.  John does this in part because he understands the continuity of the New Covenant with Old Testament religion.  If Jesus were bringing a completely new administration of religion to earth, why not just ignore the old ones?  Jesus didn't spend a lot of time pointing out the religious hypocrisies and sins of the ancient prosititution cults, for instance.  Jesus attacks the Jews because they are the administrators of the Covenant as it stands in His day, and they are wicked shepherds and hired hands.  He is rescuing the Covenant of God from those who hate God and returning it to those who love Him.    And in the process, Jesus shows us how He is greater than the externals of Old Testament religion.  He is greater than Moses, because He wrote the Law.  He is greater than the Temple, because He can raise it up and destroy it.  He is greater than the priests because He has the authority to pass judgment in the Temple.  He is greater that these things in the same way that an object is greater than its shadow.  He is not replacing the old, but bringing it into the Light.
