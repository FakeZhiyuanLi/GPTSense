      Well here I am. My own Blog. Strange really since I still dont really understand how the name "BLOG" came about.   I have been so busy with knitting! Actually I should be doing it now. I have an order to get in tomorrow. A feather knit AFL footy Pillow! Mostly done. Looks good actually. Will have to get a pic of it when I am done and find a way to post it on here. Will have to hunt down members for this place too while I am at it.   Might just tell you all al little about myself while I am here. I am a 26y.o Married SAHM of two gorgeous girls (Harley Dec 99 and Rachelle July 02). I live in Tasmania Australia with my children, husband and two cats. A gorgeous quiet little place. We are in winter right now so a great time to be knitting since it gets so cold here(good thing I am knitting).   I have so many things started! I have to get my head into all my UFOs at some point and finish them up. Maybe by summer?  I have a list for my orders too. All feather wool (of course that stuff seems so popular at the moment). I have 5 feather pillows (2 in navy, 1 in black, and 2 footy ones), 5 feather wool lambs, a childs feather wool scarf too.   I have started a feather wool jumper for my eldest child and a ostrich and normal yarn cardi for my youngest.   Ok should head off back to my knitting. Will post again tomorrow maybe

       Well went to Waverley Woollen Mills today! Found out they have only started this year with the yarn selling. I bought a 200g skein of CUPID pink for $11.20. Its a&nbsp;wicked colour. Plan on making something and felting it..Dunno what yet. Maybe a hat?     &nbsp;  The yarn isnt as nice as Bendigo Woollen Mill stuff (I got some of theirs) I wouldnt make a childs jumper out of Waverley stuff (though I am making them jumpers out of Bendigos). And Bendigo has cheaper yarn. Might stick with Bendigo for yarn for jumpers and stuff and maybe Waverley for Felting. Mind you the colour range is good but solid colours (nothing flecked).     &nbsp;  Here is a link to Waverley Woollen Mills site where you can order a shade card, order yarn online and even look at the shade card   urlLink http://www.waverleyknittingyarn.com.au/    And for a Bendigo Woollen Mill shade card email this address:  urlLink benwool@bendigo.net.au     &nbsp;  Katt

       Yay got my new Convection Oven today! A lot smaller then my past microwave oven...And doesnt seem to be as impressive in the microwave line but its a OVEN too! LOL    &nbsp;  Havent done much knitting today. Will get onto it a little later after the Kiddlets are in bed.    &nbsp;  Hey look I posted on here the day after posting before ;)    &nbsp;  Might have to head up to Waverley Woollen Mills tomorrow. I havent been up there in MONTHS and I have never looked at the wool for sale up there. I wonder if they have many cheap discount ones?     &nbsp;  Dont be surprised though if I dont get up there ;) I have been saying for MONTHS that I will get up there...Havent yet..I use to live like a 5 minute walk away from there.

       Wow its been awhile since I have posted. I have been so busy.     &nbsp;   I thought I would go through my UFOs and see what I would finish this side of Christmas. I am just glad that I hadnt done much of any of them. I ended up undoing about 5 of them. I now only have three things.     &nbsp;   1) a Patons ostrich and yarn cardigan for my youngest child    2) a Rowan pattern jumper for my oldest child    3) a pair of socks from Creative Knitting magazine for my oldest child.     &nbsp;   Though I also have about 6 orders to do.    1) two Rowan Jelly beanies for the shop    2) one navy feather pillow (done the first one)    3) AFL Hawthorn feather pillow    4) two feather lambs     &nbsp;   We are all in various stages of getting over colds in my house. The DH is the last one with it and surprisingly acting rather adult about it ;)     &nbsp;   The Rowan pattern jumper I am making Harley is my first try at Bendigo Woollen Mills wool. So far I am finding it splits a little but otherwise I am very happy with it.     &nbsp;   I would LOVE to promote a new website my friend has started. Its called    "Launceston Stitch'n'Bitch" though everyone is invited you dont even have to live in Tasmania let alone Launceston.    urlLink http://groups.msn.com/SNB-Launceston/_whatsnew.msnw     Until next time have a great night!     &nbsp;   Katt

       None..Except thats what I have been up to of late.       I decided to turn the little planter box cement thing thats a part of front porch into a little garden thing for the girls. Well today they planted six Carnation plants in there. A few weeks ago we planted out in a little garden some lettuces and mini cauliflowers to grow...I am amazed Harley hasnt nagged for them to be fully grown. They are both veggies she eats. I also have some snowpea seeds growing (might have to palm some off to family and friends.       Has anyone seen the new Bendigo Woollen Mill yarn? I got a shade card for it in the mail today. As well as the offer to buy it before the end of September at a $4 reduced cost per ball (the offer is for $12 per ball that will end up being $16 per ball), also in the offer is a pick between two patterns for this yarn for free. I planning on buying a few balls to make something for the girls each. Called "Persian" its 75%Wool, 15%Mohair, 5% Alpaca and 5%Silk I LOVE all the colours (there is 8 of them) and found it hard to pick just ONE for my girls! LOL      Of late I have been working on baby headwear. Ribbed Beanies, and Wee Willy Winkie Beanies. All for sale. Also done a ribbed scarf to sell and today picked up the yarn to do the matching beanie for it. Tomorrow I plan on getting some yarn for Mens Beanies (a reply to one of my previous comments! From an avid reader).       Okies gotta go. Gotta let the girls talk to their 'granny' (Adams mother) before they go to bed. Catch ya all around.      Katt

       Well I have done the backs of both the girls projects. YAY! Mind you I am worried about the length of the Rowan "Will" pattern for Harley. It only comes half way down her behind THIS year!! It wont fit her next year I doubt it! DAMMIT! I can see it will be a lovely addition to Rachelles winter wear though!! Sigh.       I have also gotten all but a lovely mid purple for the LUKA pattern in Rowan for Rachelle. I plan on doing it in Light, Mid and Dark shades of Pink, Blue and Purple! The nine colours compliment each other very well and with my nasty way of not liking things odd I think its the best way to do it especially if I cant find the EXACT colours the pattern uses. Though I have had to have self control I am NOT starting this pattern until I finish one of the other jumpers/cardigans I have started.      I have started a baby beanie for charity..Dunno if I will get many done. I have less then two weeks before the shop demand for knitting starts again. I plan on making some of my own pattern beanies to sell for a baby display. Mind you I have been selling my own pattern beanie in there for children for years. Just gonna do a few in a different pattern on mine.       Okies I think I will be off. Getting late. Its freezing here tonight. Hope you all have a great weekend! Catch ya all later!

       Well the M-I-L paid for the girls and I (as well as herself, her second hubby and one of the girls cousins) to go see Winnie The Pooh and the Perfect Day Live today. Just started its Aussie Tour so we went (mind you it cost her about $31per person!!!). It was great fun. When I get time I will put a pic or two from my digi up on here. Harley and Rachelle had a LOVELY time. Even better with Indy (their cousin) there to have fun too. The girls dont get to see her often since she lives in NSW.       I thought I would knit Indy a fairy floss coloured feather hat (her mother wasnt there to see it so lets hope she likes it). Looked so cute on her.       I have cleared all orders (except for feather lambs but they will be for later). So I hit Rachelle's Patons ostrich and yarn cardigan. Think I will get the back of it finished today, then starting the front. I am gonna have to get working on Harleys jumper a little more actually. MIGHT get them both done before Christmas, though looking at the shops list of window displays I have a few more things to knit or sew up there.       Hope you all have a great week! Catch you all round!      Katt

      Ahhh well I am all done with the ordered feather pillows. Mind you I want to make a black one for me and two for the kids (one each) in fairy floss colour (thinking about making Adam a AFL Bombers coloured one too).  Still trying to work out what to do with the Bendi yarn I have for Rachelle. Harleys is being used for the Rowan pattern "Will" from book Rowan Junior (yes a boys pattern for my daughter..Mind you I am doing it in Hot pink and a bit of purple for the inner collar). I havent done much but its coming up good in the colour I think. I am liking the Debbie Bliss pattern "Shawl-collared Tunic" in book Debbie Bliss Baby Styles for Rachelle but I am umming and ahhhing over the purple colour I have. Might do it in another colour. She already has two jumpers with collars and I want to do her something with a normal neckband. I am so in love with the striped pattern "Luka" in the Rowan Junior book. Want to do that for Rachelle but will have to get together the yarn. I am also looking at the pattern "Pumpkin" in Rowan Pipsqueaks for the Bendi yarn. I want to make the pattern Chill from the same book for Harley but have to get some good cheaper yarn substitute for it (any ideas people will be great).  So many patterns..So much yarn..So little compliment each other ;) What a pity! LOL  Catch ya all around!  Katt  P.S. If you so happen to be an Australian Mum who wants other Aussie mums to chat to here is a GREAT forum for you to join up to!  urlLink http://forums.delphiforums.com/aussiemoms/start

       Well the last month of winter has begun! I have to say I will miss it when its over. Its a good excuse to sit on the couch next to the fire and knit my little heart out while watching my fave tv shows. I am not as fond of knitting during summer, mind you I did a heap of it last year because so many family members got feather knitting for pressies (scarves, beanies, or bags).       Well I have finished one of my orders. Two navy feather pillows and because I took so long I made a ribbed beanie for the lady's son for free. Will have to take them all to her this week.       My girls have been so spoilt of late. In the past three weeks I have bought them so many clothes. Mind you they love them all so thats a bonus.       The local CWA shop down here has a yarn sale one so I have picked up some yarn from that REAL cheap! YAY!!! Now have to find a project for them all. Thinking about after Adam gets his tax in buying some Heirloom yarn to make the girls a jumper each. Will have to go through my patterns and pick something out for each of them. Once I have gotten the current Order finished (I am over half way - its an AFL Hawthorn feather pillow) I will HOPEFULLY be able to devote my time to finishing up the girls jumpers/cardigans.
