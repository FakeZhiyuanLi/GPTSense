      I am going to start an experiment. I want to spend 10 minutes each day writing this blog. I don't have any clear idea what I'm going to write every day, but I'm going to sit here and write what comes. I hope to spend much less and not much more than the allotted 10 minutes. Why spend 10 minutes each day writing a public journal? Because I want to see if I can, and if so, what the result might be. I have been out of the habit of writing of late. For a couple of years I had some external pressure to write, but since I have been in New Zealand I haven't.  I think I'll start with the story of why I am in New Zealand.  I am a person who doesn't like to stay with the same occupation for a long time. I find that I can really enjoy anything until I learn how to do it really well, then I am fiercely bored with it and need to find something else. I first noticed this when I was in school. I found university life to be a fantastically fun challenge. I was very good at it. I found the discipline to study and was able to make a 4.0 gpa in physical chemistry. Then I entered graduate school, and for the first year was very happy there. Then the fascination of school began to fade, and I was hungry for a new experience. I switched from a path toward becoming a academic scientist, to becoming a science teacher. I spent the next 18 months getting accredited to teach high school science classes. I got a job in Omaha the following year, working with the most dedicated teacher I have ever known. That first year of teaching was magical. We would dream up a new physics experiment, and then work like crazy to get it ready for class, on occasion pulling all-nighters to get the job done. Steve would build the equipment, and I would write software. These were very good experiments. We were desperate to give the kids hands-on experiences which didn't agree with their internal model of how the world worked. We found this to be a very effective way to get their attention. If a person already knows how something works, they aren't going to be convinced by simply being told that it works differently. But when they actually witness something that doesn't behave the way they think it should, they ask the questions, and the learning is deep and lasting. But I digress - My wife, Beth had by this time finished her medical school training and too a residency position in Iowa City. I got the job teaching physics and chemistry at Iowa City High. I think it was probably the best science teaching job in Iowa. I met my teaching partner, Marty, the day I interviewed for the job. He was very different from Steve, but just as dedicated. We spent about a month of our own time in the summer getting equipment ready and planning how we were going to teach physics at City High. The next several years were fantastic. Marty and I had a great time teaching together. While teaching in Iowa City, I continued to write software to run laboratory equipment. My former teaching buddy, Steve and formed a company with a couple of other friends which marketed some laboratory interface equipment. Gradually the teaching became less creative and more routine. The physics class was mostly in place, and we didn't need to create the experience anew, we could simply revise and tweak. I realize now that I was the kind of teacher who, at the end of the school year needs to throw out most of the stuff from the previous year, keeping only the materials that I can't live without. I think maybe I knew that at the time, but it wasn't my decision alone. I became stale. I could sense it. My wife was working in the psychiatry department at Iowa this whole time. Her boss, Sam, was doing EEG research. At a departmental party we were talking, and I offered to write some software for him. This led to a part time job and the following year I worked at the school half time and wrote software the other half. The software job grew, and the next year I found myself doing that full time. Dan, one of the people Sam was collaborating with worked for a high powered group at Iowa that studied schizophrenia. Dan was impressed with my work, and convinced his boss to hire me to help in their image analysis laboratory. Soon I was learning the basics of medical imaging and writing visualization and analysis software for that group. That is when I met Greg. Greg was a programmer who was interested in volunteering with the group. He was at a prestigious school, studying artificial intelligence programming when he had to quit school. He and I began to sit together programming. We were engaging in extreme programming, although neither of us knew it at the time. (I'm actually not sure it existed at the time) We worked on a program for analysis of brain imaging data. The final project was called BRAINS. There are a lot of interesting stories to tell about that time, but not here and now. Gradually I was given more authority at the lab, and functioned as the leader of the lab for a couple of years. I was on the author list of about 40 papers, some of which were in big journals. And after a few more years I got stale. I wanted a good 6 string guitar, and discovered that Martin sold a guitar in kit form. I have always been real stingy, and pretty good at putting things together, so I took chance and ordered a Martin guitar kit. More prudent people would have done a bit of research first, but not me. When the kit came I opened it to find a box full of wood and a one page "instruction sheet". Rather than send it back, I decided to accept the challenge and proceeded to buy tools and instruction books and after an amazing number of evenings work made a guitar. It sounded very good and since I had all the tools and stuff I thought I'd make another one, and so I got into instrument making, and inevitably repair. I found myself wanting to spend more and more time doing the instrument work and began to not be inspired by the work at the lab. Also, I was able to spend less time programming and spent more time in meetings. I began to think about ways to change my job. Then, a chance to go to New Zealand fell from the sky. A mistakenly delivered flyer about a one year temporary job for Beth in New Zealand landed on her desk. She was ready for a break too, and we decided to go for it. We both put in for leaves, but most of the people I was involved with suspected mine was of a more permanent nature. We found someone to stay in our house for the year, made all of the arrangements and took off for New Zealand in July of 1998. Beth had a job doing child psychiatry in Wellington, and I was to spend the year not working. I hoped to find a position working with an instrument maker in Wellington, but none of the people who were making instruments wanted me. I asked around after we were settled and found that the person to talk to about such a predicament was Alistair. Within minutes of sitting down for a coffee with Alistair I agreed to come into his shop a few days a week and do repair work. This work experience was invaluable in a number of ways. I enjoyed the work and the relationships. Our year in New Zealand was fantastic in a number of ways. We spent most weekends exploring the bush or beaches, and had any number of adventures. Beth and I started going along to an informal monthly sing-along gathering at a community center in Wadestown. That is where I met Andy, who introduced me to t the Irish music scene. I knew I had found a kindred spirit in Andy.

      Beth and I decided to save the money we would normally have spent on anniversary presents to treat ourselves to a get-away. The boys spent Saturday night with our neighbors, and we thundered off toward the Wairarapa. The Wairarapa region is east and north of Wellington, just over the Tararua mountain ranges. It is a broad flat region, sheltered from tough weather by the mountains. We were the very first guests of "The Martinborough Experience" a new B&amp;B in Martinborough. Our room was simple, but roomy and it had a spa tub. We spent the day poking around shops and ended up doing a walking tour of wineries. It was a simple and lovely time. The next morning we were treated to a wonderful breakfast, and went off to see some seal colonies and a lighthouse on the southern most point of the North Island. The lighthouse was on top of a ridge 254 steps above the beach. It was a fun climb, although the steps were wooden and worn. We both realized that we are not taking enough "down time" and have not forced ourselves into situations where we are unable to do the normal chores required around the house. Beth in particulars is unable to relax when there are projects calling. I hope we can find more time for get aways in the near future.
