      I was scheduled to register for orientation at 11:00 am on a Saturday.  I pulled my car into the parking lot of the law school roughly an hour ahead of schedule.  It is good to be early, I thought, but surely this was too early.  I quietly shut the door of my car, surveyed the parking lot for other students who, like me, may have arrived early, and I walked quickly past the building.  I soon found myself behind the school, near a road with a sidewalk.  It was unusually hot outside, but a walk was as good of a way to kill time as any, and I needed to gather myself for when I would make my entrance into the school.  In the back of my chest I could feel the pulse of anxiety slowly taking over my body, my breath even felt a little short.  I was nervous as hell.  I called my girlfriend and I left her a message, it calmed me down.  I turned around, and I was ready to make my first impression on my classmates and professors.     As I approached the doors of the law school I did my best to appear outwardly confident.  The steps leading to my home away from home for the next three years were lined with flowers and fresh mulch, the grass was freshly cut in the lawn, and the entrance was clearly marked so that the first year law students, referred to as "1L's," wouldn't get lost.  The sun beat down on me as I cautiously stretched my arm towards the door.  On the other side , I figured, I would be bombarded by fellow 1L's, student representatives, and a slew of faculty and administration members who would ask my name and perhaps my reason for coming to law school.  I braced myself as I pulled the door slowly towards me, in the back of my chest I could feel a tiny murmur, and it quickly turned to a rattle.  On the outside I was confident and cool, in my mind each passing moment seemed to move faster, once again I was nervous as hell.  I opened the door and walked into a gathering area, and it was mostly empty.  To my right a couple of upperclassmen were chatting about professors and something called "outlines."  My eyes scanned the room until I saw a small table on my left where to young women were seated.    "Are you a 1L?," they asked me.  "Yes, I guess I am," I replied.  One of the girls gave me a folder with my name on it.  Beneath my name it said "Section III."  I asked about what this meant, and I was told that it would be the section of other students I would spend the year with.  In law school 1L's are generally split into sections.  For the entire first year, a law student remains solely with his or her section and has no real contact with the other members of his or her graduating class.  It was important, I quickly realized, to identify members of my section when I introduced myself to others.  Upon speaking with one group of students, a young man excused himself from the conversation stating that, "none of you are in my section, so I don't want to waste my time."  While that exchange was a bit awkward and unnecessary, it conveyed a central truth about the first year of law school; your section is everything, it is who you are, and it is the way that others will identify you, you must be good to the other members of your section.  Slowly more of my classmates arrived, and nervously introduced themselves.  A group of us were whisked away by an upperclassman who took us on a tour of the school.  Within minutes, the socialization of the law school began as the seedlings of friendships and acquaintances began to sprout.  I leaned over to a tall fellow who looked to be about my age and introduced myself and told him which section I was in, he was in the same one as me.  He told me that his name was Joe, and he revealed to me that he had grown up in the general area of the school.  I too, had grown up in the area, and we talked about the local bars that we liked to frequent, and the sports teams we've lived and died with for out entire lives.  By this point, we had both slipped to the back of the pack, which was just as well since our tour guide seemed more interested in talking to the 1L girls that actually showing us anything we would retain.  As the tour guide gushed on about the hours of work which we would be assigned and joked that we would wish we never came to law school in the first place, Joe leaned over to me and whispered, "listen to this guy... this is going to be terrible."  We both laughed, then we stopped upon the realization that we were about to go in way over our heads.  When we arrived back at the gathering area the group had grown larger, most everyone had arrived, and some administrators were attempting to herd us into a large classroom.  There we sat and listened to faculty members deliver greetings and warnings of the pitfalls of the first year law student.  One common thread bound each speaker, if they were all telling the truth, we had no way of ever preparing for the amount of work and stress that was about to befall us.  When the day ended I exchanged phone numbers with Joe, and agreed to go to purchase books with him the next day as we each had the same exact schedule.  That evening felt like I would imagine a criminal might feel walking into prison to serve a 3 year sentence.  I did not know exactly what challenges were on the other side of the glass, but I did know that it would not be easy to accomplish any of them.  As it turns out, I was right.

      Welcome to my very first weblog!  I am a second year law student at a fairly recognizable law school (ever hear of Harvard? well its not even close).  I have started this weblog so that I may share my experiences over the past year, and so that I may document the many new and (sometimes) interesting situations that I will find myself in over the coming year.  I want to start off by making two disclaimers:   First, I have never attempted to keep a weblog before so please bear with me in the coming weeks as I try to hone my abilities to both update the blog regularly, as well as to clean up what is sure to be sloppy writing in my first several elongated posts.  Additionally, once school starts in earnest my posts will likely shrink in size and frequency, but I am committed to following through with this project through at least the next year.  Secondly, I have decided that in order for me to honestly and truthfully convey my feelings about the situations that I will find myself in and the persons who I will be working with and for over the coming months, I feel that I, and the other subjects of my posts, must remain anonymous.  Accordingly, I will use initials to identify the people in my life and I will occasionally change or mask certain details if I feel that they will reveal my identity, or of equal importance, the identities of others.   Please know, however, that the accounts and descriptions in this weblog will be substantively truthful, and a very real representation of my life over the coming year.  With all of that out now out of the way I would like to briefly introduce myself.  I am not a typical law student.  My grades are not phenominal, although they are respectable.  I haven't, at least yet, allowed the law to take over my life (see my next post for more on this).  I am a creative thinker, and if I could pick one strength that I most value it is my vision.  I know what actions I want to take in the moment, but I also consider how those actions will affect my long term desires in the future, and at this point in my life my long term goals are paramount.    Most law students are good followers, which is not a bad thing because that is a necessary quality for one to have in order to be successful in law school.  Law students are given fact patterns, and must analyize them within the context of a certain set of rules.  Students are not allowed to think outside of the rules, and excess creativity is not appreciated by professors.  While most of my colleagues seem to like to believe that they fall within the class of "Type-A" personalities, it is my contention that they do not.  The law forces students to conform to one way of thinking, which is something that I have struggled with, and thats where I will pick up with my next post.  Over the coming weeks I will focus mostly on my experiences from last year, intermidently discussing my current travails as a summer law clerk for a government prosecutor.  Consider this to be a primer for the real subject of this weblog, my second year of law school.
