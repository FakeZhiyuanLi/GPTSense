Kayla came over and took one and i was ok wit that cause i no she doesn't eat lunch ne way! but then people like Michelle Chase and Jessi started stealing my fries and i started gettin mad! but oh well i guess! i was full by the time i finished ne wayz! i havn't been eatin as much lately and idk y lol! hmm we did some fun stuff as we were leavin the school (me and josh) did a bakwards race around a curbe wit a tree lol! it was fun actually! no matter how stupid it sounds! hmm! then josh went to turn around and he only thot there was one person behind us! but Tara was behind us wit all the other people in that car! and Josh started bakin out in front of em and i was like AHH GOD STOP!!! and hes like what? and im like dude theres a car comin and the thing was they were majorly close lol! and TARA FLIPPED JOSH OFF!!! or someone in that car!!!

         Hey allz ok since my last post i had to get off cause my dad wanted the fone but wat he was doin was seein bout a new engine for my truck and the guy he found that has one wants 2000 for everything then we still will have to pay someone to put it all bak in! so that sux! hmm... im mostly jus screwed around since my last post! jus watch wheel of fortune and Blue Collar TV and some Olympic stuff! and now im here! i was jus talkin to Kayla but she got off! I really wish me and a person could talk more often than we do! cause i mean no matter what happens between us i dont wanna lose our friendship! i mean thats important to me if before ne thing else between us! Like all me and her really do ne more is talk on the internet and thats very rarely too and when we see each other in person whether its jus a hey or its nothing at all most of the time! and i would really like to change that! Like today she thot i was mad at her cause i didn't say hey to her before lunch! but idk really why i didn't say hey tho! i guess its cause Austin was near me and i know she doesn't like Austin so i didn't think she would say ne thing bak ne way! I would jus like to really change things! I jus dont want us to end up not even being friends after all we have been thru together! which is ALOT of prob. that we fixed each other from! Like i jus dont want us to not even act like the other isn't jus standing right there like ignoring the other at all costs! but i also want the trust bak too! Trust makes up a friendship! but ne wayz off that subject yall r prob. sick of it! hmm tomm i have to leave before 7 to get at the school at 7 to retake a freakin lap rules test ahh!! i hate this! and Kayla passed hers wit a 97 i think she said! jeez! and Drew actually out scored me and josh! can u believe that crap? lol! hmm well i MIGHT post again later before bed ttyl!

         Hey allz i ended up goin to CWBC and had one of the best worships i have ever had on a Wed.! it was really great! i mean God really moved me there tonite! Amazing how he can really do that even when theirs a ton of distractions everywhere in the room! but ne wayz! i got alot out of it! hmm after we left i was following Kayla and her mom! and people started flyin by us in the right lane! so i pulled over in the right and went from 45 to 50 and passed by Kayla and her mom and then that person in front of me idk if they slowed down or wat! cause i never went above 53 i no that for sure! and aught of a sudden someone named Kayla lol thinks that im really really speedin and thinks im tailgating a person and i didn't really! lol mean to ne way! it was that persons fault! lol! but ne wayz! then i went by my church and hung out for a lil while wit Josh and all! then i came home and now im here! which Kayla and her church are doin some lil trip thing idk wat it is about or ne thing but it sounds very interesting its called connected and its during November idk wat it is or ne thing except for wat it says and it barely says ne thing! like idk if everyone that was there know what the word Socket means i have no idea! idk but its a wed. thru sunday thing and im pretty interested! idk if im gonna go tho its 45 dollars if i turn in my registration before sept. which i dont even have that much money so idk! and i wouldn't feel right i guess if i went and i was with people that dont even wanna get to know me! i really dont understand people these days i wish people would be givin more courtesy! i mean if u dont no someone and their sittin next to u and they seem alone talk to em get to know their name and stuff! dont let them feel hated! Which everytime i go up to CWBC i feel rejected really cause noone will sit by ya if they dont no ya! and noone will talk to u if they dont know u! u wanna know how many people said hey to me today 3 the entire time! and thats cause they no me! but its 3 people that i dont see eye to eye wit 100%! i mean i sat in the middle of the room and was rejected noone sat around me! but it ended up being a very good thing cause i got alot out of tonite by that happening! But i mean c'mon guys lets not let people feel rejected all the time! BUT NE WAYZ with wat i was sayin! also See you at the pole is on Sept. 15th i believe! and theres this big Saw you at the pole thing at hinds comm. college and i wanna go! but i mean idk if it costs ne thing or not! and that sucks if it does cause im poor lol! i wanna go on both things! CONNECTED and Saw You At The Pole both sound really good! idk the bands that r gonna be there but the way people got hyped up about em they must be pretty good! Kayla says they r too! but idk! I jus dont like goin places that i dont know ne one! or when i do know someone but they dont wanna keep u from being alone and they dont care! but w/e i mean u all can do wat u want! i know what ive dun and im going to continue doing tho! well ima go now i guess! im bout tired of typin! and ive thot about it i might start openin my bible randomly and each day put one verse on here! i have quite a few people that read this and if i can jus get them to read a verse of the bible! even if its in this it will make God happy! idk if im gonna do this or not but its sounds cool to me! well ttyl!

         Hey allz im sorry bout my last post i was really pissed at that moment and i didn't think of what i did the night before to cause this to happen. I prey'd to God that if in order for Kayla to grow in her walk with you if she needs me not to even be her friend for a lil while i will back off a while cause all i do is care bout her doin what she needs to do! and after that next night we started fightin and i told her that if she didn't want me as a friend then i guess ill have to deal wit it and the thing is i dont think i would ever had said that on purpose then we weren't friends ne more! but i was still pissed off! but then i thot bout it and remembered that i prayed that prayer to him! and i was alright with it! Kayla came up to me this morning askin me if i was mad at her and i said no and i told her what i jus told all of u! and she jus walked off i hope she believes me and guys this is serious God seriously did this on purpose probably for the best of both of us right now! we both need to be closer to him! and i swear u guys i prayed that prayer 2 nights ago and last night it happened! so if that doesn't tell u he moves in us besides the bible idk what does! me and josh r goin to CWBC tonite instead of our church hes comin by at about 5 to get me and be up there bout 5:30 so yeah ill post l8r how church went!

         Hey allz as u can see this is now different from what it was its cause idk what got into me that night when i wrote it i let my emotions get in the way of everything! i wasn't thinkin and i took it out on Kayla! But takin it out on her is one thing but taken it out on her in public is somin i should have never dun! Someone i care so much about! even if were not friends! and even if she dont care bout me! i cant say i dont wanna be her friend or even more than that like we were once before! i wanna see her and myself grow closer in our walks with God! I want that before ne thing! me and Kayla broke up for this reason! and we arn't friends ne more cause of this reason(like u can see above in the newest entree) and you wouldn't believe how bad i feel for puttin all of what i did have here! I care bout Kayla and her feelings! thats why even when im not her friend i do things she likes , like not wearing all black and cussing i dont wanna go bak the way i was before i met Kayla i used to be depressed and useless really! She changed me God made me and her meet for a reason! to change me and make me closer to him! and it has worked really good! and unfortunately for me we had to brake up cause we were makin each other our 1st priorities! and God needs to be it! and once again im gonna say this Kayla Im so so sorry for hurting ur feelings i never wanted to do that! ever! and i truely am sorry! and ive been bothering u lately jus to help! not to hate! alright allz i guess im dun here i jus hope she forgives me cause i would never wanna hurt her! ill ttyl allz after school!
