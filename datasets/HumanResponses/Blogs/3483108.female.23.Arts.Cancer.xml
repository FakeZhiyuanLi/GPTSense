      this entire week has been a series of really shitty things happenening one after the other.  i swear to god that if i had an underground bunker, i would be hiding out until the end of august.  i'd resurface to enjoy september and october, then return to said bunker for the winter.  there would be no feuding family members - i'd tell them that i love them, give them a p.o. box number where they can send my birthday gifts and let them work their shit out on their own. there would be no financial problems, since as far as i know, there are no clothing/shoe/accessories/housewares stores adjacent to my bunker and hell, since it's my bunker, it would be a pretty hot pad anyways. definitely no roommates presenting me with a $660 electricity bill and saying "oops! i kinda need your half by monday!"  on friday night.  where was this bill three months ago when i kept asking "how much do i owe you?  let me know as soon as the bill comes in."   DIE DIE DIE.  no boy toy with erratic behavior, who one day is divulging his soul and all of his deepest, most sacred thoughts to me while the next he just stares at me and walks away.  "WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM MEEEEEEE ?!?!" reverberates through my brain about 80 times per day.    as my mother would say, i need to get to my happy place.  adding on to all of this, my best girlfriends from university, e. and j. are in a no holds barred, sucker of a catfight over who is resposnsible for rent money when both of them are at fault and too pigheaded to see it.  e. lives in ottawa and j. was supposed to move there this summer, and consequently share a place with her for the upcoming year - pending on j. being hired there.  well j. can't find a job and she can't afford to be working for less than what she's already making, so she has decided to stay in montreal with her current employer.  she doesn't want to (and can't afford to) pay rent on a place that she isn't living in and thinks that e. should find a new roommate.  since e. kicked her old roommate out 2 months early so that j. could move in, she is downright pissed.  on the other hand, j. never asked her to do so and feels that it's not her problem to take care of.  by default, being best friends with both of them, i get thrown into this situation.  do i want it?  no.  did i tell that that i was staying neutral in all of this?  yes.  have i repeated myself to them ad nauseum?  to the point where i wonder if i haven't been speaking to brick walls for the past 2 weeks.  yesterday, j. decided to pull the whole "well, if you keep on talking to her, i don't know if i can be friends with you anymore" line, which sent me through the roof.  of all of the stupid, immature, manipulative things to say when you are frustrated, that is the last card - what my father calls "digging at the bottom of the barrel".  why do they want to throw their five-year friendship away over something as stupid as money?  i really need to get drunk right about now.  cabana boy!  where's my martini?  so the plan for the day is as follows.  go to the bakery and the newsstand and have chocolatine and coffee in the backyard while reading the newspaper.  do a couple loads of wash, clean out the garden, take a walk down st. denis.  compose a letter for my mother, basically reiterating all of the arguments i used while trying to reason with my brother this morning about his decision to live on his own when he's way too young and totally financially dependent on my parents.  and it's already 1:00 pm.  *sigh*  did i mention that this is my only day off in the space of almost 2 weeks?  cat, i'm desperately waiting for a comment from you.  where is cantina when we need it?  (note as previewing post:  as i'm about to publish, sexy brit boy is coming in thru the gate in the backyard.  he lives upstairs but i only run into him like 3 times a year.  in a three-apt. building, that's almost unheard of.  every time i see him, he makes some sort of insinuating, tawdry comment which makes my knees buckle and i act like a fool.  the last time i spoken to him, he knocked at our door to ask if he could park his bike in our backyard.  he was on his way out to take his roommate's dog for a walk.  for some reason, she's obsessed with my slippers and so she ran by me and went directly for my room.  we wrestled her back out of the apt. and i told her not to cry, because she could come and play in my backyard anytime.  sbb looked at me and said: "was that invitation for her, or was it for me?"  *rowr* )

      Wow... My first blog.  I feel like a proud hen, staring down lovingly at my newborn chick.  Here little bloggie bloggie!  I'm your Mommy!  Um ok.  Even I'm scared by that last one.  Just shows you what 7 hours of sitting in front of a computer and trying to look busy does to your brain.  I'm not sure what the purpose of this blog is going to be.  Answering questions like "Favourite Music?", "Favourite Books?" and "Favourite Movies?" leaves me feeling a bit dumbfounded.  How do you quantify yourself, your life and the things that shape it into a series of comma stricken words?  I know that I an entranced by Leonard Cohen's work, that I have an addiction to shopping and that I wear at least one pink item every day. I also know alot of other things, but until I am more comfortable with the idea of sharing my life with all of you little web lemmings, I won't go any further:)  What I do hope to accomplish with this blog is to be able to get into the groove of writing again after a three year hiatus.  I tried my hand at being a lab rat but it just didn't work for me.  It feels like coming home after a long, not-so pleasant journey and I have to say that it feels really, really good.  My annoying roomate and her annoying bf have just gotten home so I'm going to take the opportunity to run out while I still have a glimmer of sanity.  One thing that I should know about myself by now is that I should have had my own little nest a long, long time ago.     I'm listening to right now:  Whatever It Takes by Ron Sexsmith

      "So why do you fill my sorrow With the words you've borrowed From the only place you've known And why do you sing Hallelujah If it means nothing to you Why do you sing with me at all?"                                               -damien rice " urlLink delicate "  i've spent the past hour or so listening to a mix of damien rice and ani difranco while trying to purge the really shitty feelings that have been accumulating over the course of this week.  something is definitely up with the boy but i can't seem to figure it out or to get him talking about it.  i can't help but wonder if i have anything to do with it... he's being so evasive, barely even saying hello. at one point this afternoon, he just totally ignored my presence.  he even tried to skirt our usual 4pm meeting but i managed to corner him, ask him what was up and all he could answer was "nothing... nothing..." as he walked away.  how am i supposed to work with that?  last week, everything was perfect.  we finally seemed like we were going to have *THE* talk, get all of our feelings out on the table and then see where this was going.  ok, i saw him for all of 30 seconds on friday, but he still seemed fine and in a good mood.  i e-mailed him on saturday.  still no answer.  yesterday, he was bitchy.  today he was awful.  tomorrow?  i don't know if i can deal with tomorrow right now.  what if this wasn't for keeps?  what if this is going to blow up in my face?  we haven't even gotten to the good stuff yet... what gives?  when he can't talk to me, it means that something big, very big, is up.  we talk about everything.  it's always been like that.  as soon as we start talking, we can't stop.  i could brush all of this off if we'd only ever been superficial and nonchalant with each other.  it's never been like that though.  unless my head has been stuck in the sand and i've been living in an alternate universe for the past 5 months, it's never been like that.  ever.

      it's 3:53am, and since i'm still awake, i figured that it would be a good time to start on my mega post covering the past 5 days or so.   let me see... to used an expression coined by my friend l., i was a total gong show this week. honestly, i wonder how in the hell these things happen to me. as i already posted on cat's  urlLink blog , i made a total fool out of myself in front of e., 80 american children and two of my co-workers. being the lazy bum that i am, i'm simply going to paste back what i posted.  "i made a total idiot out of myself this morning in front of e., 2 animators and 80 children. he met me at the coffee machine (how typical of an office romance!) and we started playing catch-up and talked about our weekends (or lack thereof). we left the office together and walked down the hallway to the other end of the museum to the pure sciences exhibition hall.   (his office is adjacent to it and i had to go and brief some of the animators about the rally they were doing with the hearing impaired kids this morning.)   anyways, so as we get there, 80 american kids show up. t. was about to greet them, so i started walking backwards (facing t./ back to e.) and said "i need to talk to you about something later". well, instead of t. answering, e. goes "ok! sounds good!" all that went through my brain was "omigod, no! you think that we're going to have *THE* talk! i'm not ready for *THE* talk!"  in the heat of my panic-stricken moment, i lost track of where i was going and i walked right into a turnstile, which then hit the wall behind it.  all 80 of the kids looked around and started saying "omigod! are you ok?"  e. stood there, panicked, thinking that i hurt myself.   i just burst out laughing.  my life as an idiot."  ever since that, the boy has been giving me out-of-control, full on attention.  it seems like that's all he needed to get some more confidence in my feelings for him and now he's going to town.  the boy who would avoid coming over to see me if other people were there is now having 20 minute conversations with my guy friends while we eat lunch.  *sigh*  this is so weird.  wonderful, but totally weird.  seems like i'm getting a bit more confident about this whole situation myself.  i decided on friday night that i should e-mail him about the picture he took of j. and h. at his b-day party, which was the night we stayed out on the balcony until 4am in 3 degree weather talking.  another one of "those" nights...  anyways, i wrote him a saucy note on saturday morning about it and slyly slipped in a mention about the get-together at a.'s that night, which turned out to be a kind of blah evening.  i didn't expect him to get msg early enough to come, but now it's early monday morning and i still haven't heard back from him.  he'd better not be playing hard to get, that evil little minx.  other than that, the week has been basically working and going out.  seems like every night there's something going on - tuesday night i had drinks with j., freaked out over the roommate's parents being here (mix of fatigue, hunger and all of those wonderful period hormone-rushes that keep me oh-so stable).  wednesday, i went out for drinks with a bunch of the girls from work, which involved going to 3 bars other than the one we had planned on meeting at and eating lebanese food on a street corner.  on thursday night, i went to j.'s for supper and a mini sex and the city marathon.  j. came over after supper on friday and we met 2 of her coworkers for drinks at le barouf.  i felt strangely comfortable and then realized "oh wait, i sat at the next table on wednesday night for like 3 hours."  yay for bar hopping on st-denis!  turns out that j.'s work friends were classmates with a girl whom i was an educator with at the museum and whom i convinced to take the graduate diploma in communications at concordia.  this city seems to shrink on a daily basis.  forget six degrees of separation - in montreal, you only need two.  that night, i had my first taste of a dirty hippie, pseudo-intellectual mcgill party and oh, was it ever what all of my neurotic little brain cells hoped it would be.  for such a long time, i was so ashamed of going to concordia and not mcgill.  when people mistook me for a mcgill student, i never corrected them.  95% of my family went to mcgill and according to them, concordia is an immigrant-ridden night school for the learning-disabled.  i'd had a taste of what the student population at mcgill was like from acquaintances and the people in my mcat class from last summer but i think that part of me had this illusion of a utopic world at mcgill.  as a kid, i didn't dream of being an astronaut or having babies.  i would dream of university - of lying under a massive oak tree while reading, going to football games on sundays,  discussing 20th century literature over dinner with my professors.  pep rallies, seminars, overnighters, homecomings, lush green spaces ... that's was to me what university was all about.  concordia didn't fulfill those dreams at first and it was a really hard blow to take. things have changed a lot though in the past 5 years.  we have about 5 new buildings, enrollment is way up, the political dissent between arab and israeli students seems to have almost disappeared.  maybe the most ardent sign of truly changing times is that for the first time, the english department is offering a course on leonard cohen,  urlLink ENGL 663  , albeit at the graduate level.  i love the english department...  all to say that, the mcgill party was as obnoxious as i thought that it would be.  we left about 30 mins in, before j. even had time to finish her drink.  we walked home, agreed on how happy we are that we aren't mcgill alumni, had an adventure with the poutine man, smoked a joint and slept sweetly until the next morning, when we had brunch in the backyard on the first real summer's day.  how cool is that:)  5:25am and i still can't sleep.  cat, where are you?  the sun is coming up and i feel like reading the newspaper.  swear to god this happens way too often.  i'm also craving to smoke a cigarette, something else which is happening way too often for my taste these days.  ok, my eyes are starting to droop. time for beddy byes.  i'm expecting comments about my ramblings from you ladies.   nite nite.

      k ladies, i need your input. the big birthday bash is in 6 days and i have to start downloading (oops did i say that out loud?  i mean GOING TO HMV AND BUYING) loads of music. any ideas?  lists are very much appreciated.  it's been so long since my last post - i have no clue where to start.  my roommate has gone MIA for the past week and a half.  she's here when i'm (and the rest of the world is) at work, then she and tweedledumb have supper here or she takes off for his place.  it's gotten to the point where the two days of the week when she is supposed to be working, she has taken to calling in sick.  when i get home she'll be here, holed up in a corner, being her dustbunny self.  then she'll take off and hide in anti-social land with him.  how romantic.  kind of like the 14 minute whambam.  but we won't go there.  friday, spent the day reading, shopping online and doing "which sex and the city character are you?" quizzes.  after work, i had coffee and sushi with v.  she's worried because i've started smoking again and i don't have an appetite.  part of it is the change in weather, most of it is stress induced.  it won't last forever - god knows i'll be gorging on b-day cake in a week, so i'm not too worried about my disappearing waistline.    saturday, i lazed in bed, did my regular newspaper and chocolatine run, had a couple of uncomfortable run-ins with one of the girls who lives above us(they're like the shining twins - i can't tell the difference between the two of them if my life depended on it) and finally met the crazy mexican guy who lives next door.  our encounter can easily be summarized like this:  brie makes her way into the backyard with coffee, vogue, chocolatine, gazette and sliced mangoes in hand.  starts cursing as "baby boy" by beyoncé starts blaring out of crazy mexican neighbour's window at 120 dB.  as she starts making her way into the house to grab the cordless, a 6' mexican dude (md) shows up on the other side of the fence.  md: hallllllllllllllo b: hey. (3 second pause) can you turn that music down? md: esscuze me? b: turn. the. music. down. (hand motions ensue) please. md: oooooohhh.  yes yes.  no pwoblem. (starts making his way inside) b: yeah... ummm... thanks! (as beyoncé fades out, b. rushes inside and thinks "great going there superstar. how long do you think it's going to take him to figure out that YOU'RE the one who called the cops on them back in march?  smart ass.")  got dolled up in my very carrie-esque new outfit ( urlLink pink axara sleeveless, backless top  (not some weird beige tie-dyed color like this one but a true bright pink),  urlLink multicolored miss me los angeles skirt , seethrough hoop earrings with white, aqua and orange painted in the background, white bangle,  urlLink cute sandals  (these but in light pink - sm. flowers on sides, fushia - big middle flower and beige soles),  urlLink pink matt & nat purse  (pebble bouton style but the color of the pink lambskin amsterdam bag) and went to meet a., who i hadn't seen for a year and a half, for a stroll along st-laurent and major catching up over drinks.    today:  called my dad for father's day, got coffee, had the flowers i'd chosen stolen from me at the market, planted begonias, impatients and petunias in the backyard,  cleaned up after tweedledee and tweedledumb, watched a michael moore interview (i'm so obsessed with his new documentary fahrenheit 9/11 - can't wait till it comes out on friday!), watched trading spaces (love the new laura girl) and here i am.  is it normal to be this tired at 9:53pm?   oh wait... yay!  happy summer!  is any else as excited as i am for bill clinton's memoirs, " urlLink my life ", which is coming out on tuesday?  he was on 60 minutes tonight and i couldn't help but find him so attractive.  ewww... other than the somewhat obvious physical similarities, is this why everyone calls me monica? *gack!*

      cat - damn you and your quizzes.  they made my saturdays at work much more fulfilling:)          You're Thailand!      Calmer and more staunchly independent than almost all those around you,  you have a long history of rising above adversity. &nbsp;Recent adversity has led to questions  about your sexual promiscuity and the threat of disease, but you still manage to attract a  number of tourists and admirers. &nbsp;And despite any setbacks, you can really cook a good  meal whenever it's called for. &nbsp;Good enough to make people cry.   Take the  urlLink Country  Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid             You're  The Guns of August !   by Barbara Tuchman     Though you're interested in war, what you really want to know is what causes war. You're out to expose imperialism, militarism, and nationalism for what they really are. Nevertheless, you're always living in the past and have a hard time dealing with what's going on today. You're also far more focused on Europe than anywhere else in the world. A fitting motto for you might be &quot;Guns do kill, but so can diplomats.&quot;      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .

      i'm a bad, bad blogger...   ok. so sue me. i've neglected my blog. badly. i haven't gotten a threat of blog neglect councelling yet, so i figure that i can still make up for it by blogging twice in a day.   so here's the rapid fire lowdown of the past two weeks.   a) birthday party sucked - badly.  b) my will moved away.  c) e. disappeared.  d) e. reappeared - with a vengeance.  e) i lost 10 lbs.  f) started smoking and quit again.&nbsp;&nbsp;then i started again.&nbsp; no comment. g) had the apt. to myself for a week (thank god!) but now it's going to be overrun again... DIE DIE DIE!  h) almost got my ass kicked by a jappy lipstick lesbian at the ani difranco concert last saturday.  i) there's a new boy at work... and ooh... things might just become much, much more complicated.  &nbsp;  ok, so i started writing this post 8 days ago.&nbsp; i'm officially an absent blog mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;if i listen closely, i think that i can hear BNS&nbsp;making their way over to steal my blog away.&nbsp; noo!  &nbsp;work sucks.&nbsp; we're so bored that we don't even speak to each other anymore, cause we've talked out every topic we can think of.&nbsp; i'm seriously thinking about finding a new job because this has become fucking ridiculous.&nbsp; even clandestine encounters with e. don't get me going anymore.&nbsp; it's always so hot and then neutral. &nbsp;it drives me nuts.&nbsp; whatever happened to consistency?&nbsp; whatever happened to wanting something and going after it?&nbsp; whatever happened to courtship, butterflies, heady glances, stolen kisses, sultry innuendos and careless flirtations?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  why does it always come to this point?&nbsp; is it the men that i'm attracted to?&nbsp; is it me?&nbsp; do i subconsciously sabotage every relationship that i have with a man?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  i don't get this.  &nbsp;  i'm 23 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;i should not be lamenting about how difficult it is to have a relationship with a guy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  where did all of the fun go?  &nbsp; and that was my weekly saturday disgression/rant. &nbsp; thank god i had yesterday off.&nbsp; i was going to blow my gasket. &nbsp; so basically, i spent yesterday picking up after the piglets, doing laundry, watching SATC and just clearing&nbsp;my head.&nbsp;  &nbsp; *blah* &nbsp; thank god that i'm going away this weekend because i seriously think that i couldn't stand it much longer.&nbsp; respite!&nbsp; RESPITE! &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      3:45 am  just got home from a night of dancing at a go go with andrea. AHH!  SO MUCH FUN!  pre-outing cosmos at her place, followed by a jaunt down st-laurent&nbsp;to a gogo.&nbsp; we&nbsp;gave sultry looks to the bouncer, who proceeded&nbsp;to shoe us in directly to the club, while the t-shirt crew waited outside, slightly more than pissed off.&nbsp; flirted with tourists from ontario, chris and glenn who were cute but slightly on&nbsp;the "Duh" side.&nbsp; had to fight off the greek boys, lazarus and george, who were jonesing for our numbers hardcore.&nbsp;   the only thought that went though my head was "i wish that eric was here."  at least the dj played human league for me.  "don't don't you want me  you know i can't believe it when i hear that you wont see me don't don't you want me you know i dont believe you when you say that you won't need me it's much too late to find you think you've changed your mind you'd better change it back or we'll both be sorry dont you want me baby dont you want me ooooooooh"  i'm leaving for ottawa at 3pm&nbsp;to help em move&nbsp;back to&nbsp;QUEBEC.&nbsp;  wooooot wooooooot! once a quebecker, always a quebecker.  no net access&nbsp;till wednesday when i'll drag myself into work after coming back from o-town.  must go and wash the greek grease off of me. ewwww.  will update when i get back.  BOOYAKA!  till wednesday... :)
