      Drawing is fun. Especially when it's of my favorite Torn-Worlder, Damien. ((Made-up character: I have the whole family tree and everything.))   Yep. Observe the Dami:      Adorable, eh? This is from Go-Gaia. He's my avatar. ^___^   Speaking of Go-Gaia...   urlLink      Eh? Eh? Go join! Be one with the Gaians! Earn gold! Dress up your avatar! Donate to keep the servers from dying! Flame biased/homophobic/trolling/justplainstupid idiots! Have fun!   So, anyway, today I... and then I... I didn't do anything. But my immune system failed to protect me again, and I got sick. So I have a cold, and I'll probably miss summer school tomorrow. Bleh. So I sit here, in my PE sweatclothes, eating food and typing away. Tikatikatika.   So... yeah... right. One day, I might actually have something interesting to say. But that day is obviously not today. Bye bye.

      I like Friday. I'm in summer school helping out with Ms. Maghami's kindergarten class, and they have no class on Friday.  Actually, yesterday was the last day. Meh. I was getting attached to those kids, especially Andi. ^___^ "Bye bye, see tomorrow!" His broken english was so adorable.  So anyway, I have this thing called "Ad Serve" on my computer, and I can't figure out how to get rid of it. Meh. Spybot can't get it, my antivirus software can't get rid of it... It's really very annoying. It gives me popups every two minutes, and I have to close both the popup and the Ad Serve program. And then, if I was playing a full screen game when it happened... Gah, stupid adware.  I like Japanese music. I can listen to the music without concentrating on the words, because I don't know what's being said. It's really good music, and American music's probably that good as well. But I concentrate on what's being said instead of the actual music, and it ruins it for me. *shrugs* Whatever.  Anyway... ooh, ads by Google on the top of my blog. Related searches is interesting... Heh heh. For yesterday's post, the related searches I'm getting are "George W. Bush" (obvious), and "Hartman" (from when I was talking about Butch Hartman). That's cool.  I'm really hungry right now. I could go for a sandwich. Or maybe another Chicken Pot Pie... that thing was good, or if I may indulge my leet side, T3H $3CKZ. Yep, that's actually a leet expression. I know what you're thinking, so shut up.  Heh heh... watching clips of Pretty Guardian Sailormoon. Never realized how hard is was to convert "prism" to engrish. "Moon Purisisumu Powaa, Make Up!" Wanna see the clip? It's from the Sailor Senshi Page. Search for it on Google.  So, I need things to do. I'm bored. I know, I'll check my email! Hmm... In my Inbox, I have Jenny Lin Orchestra, Newgrounds, spam, yahoo!group, spam, yahoo!group, spam, USA network, spam, spam. Don't'cha just love spam? I know I do.  Nothing new in my Fanfiction folder...  Ooh, two new things in my Nintendo folder! O___O I could win $5000 from Nintendo... ooh, F-Zero... Me loves F-Zero. Awesome racing game of doom... if only I could get past the stupid sand level... ooh, Pokemon Leafgreen and Firered... I knew that they would have to let you bring the old Pokemon into Ruby and Sapphire. But the names are stupid. Leafgreen and Firered. Uhm, yay.  Anyway, I've also got about 10 new items in my Deleted Items folder. (I send junk mail straight there... or at least I try to. Meh.  So, I think that's enough ranting for today. I need to go huggle my dog now. Tschuss!

      Yep, I got a Blogger account. Why? Because I can enter entries straight from my Google Toolbar of Ultimate Doom.  Yum. I'm eating a Chicken Pot Pie right now. Very good... Yum... Heart.  Anyway, I just got back from seeing Fahrenheit 911. Pretty good, if I do say so myself, although some of the connections Michael Moore tried to make were.... not very good. But I agree with his main point, that being "Bush is an idiot".  And people treat Bush as the bad guy. I'm going to state my opinion here: I think Bush has good intentions. It's all his friends who are making him their puppet. I think he'll look back after he loses this election and say, "wow I've made a mess of things".  Oh my, I haven't introduced myself, have I? I'm Robyn, the mildly disgruntled mezo violinist. Who could be a soprano, but believes the mezos need all the help they can get. *shrugs* They suck.  Anyway, what else? I like anime, and violin, and computer, and videogames, and grapefruit juice, and I especially like Butch Hartman cartoons. Danny Phantom, Fairly Odd Parents, etcetera.  So... now you know. Use this knowledge to conquer the world... or something.
