      Today Lesley, Haley and I went to Estes Park.  It was a lot of fun browsing the shops and having lunch up there.  The girls had their picture taken in an old time photo shop.  The picture was a gift from Lesley to Haley for her high school graduation.    We then stopped at my dad's house for short, but nice, visit.  Then we came home and grilled out some hot dogs and ate some good raw veggies and macaroni salad.  Haley and Lesley then showed Scott a new version of solitaire before they left.  It was a fun day.  And now I'm really tired so I'm gonna go read my book, Angels and Demons, and fall asleep.

      I just got done cleaning my room!  Wow... this place was a mess.  It's all prettied up now.  Lesley is on her way to the airport to get her sister, Haley.  This is her first trip to Colorado.  We are planning on treating her to dinner tonight at Johnny Carino's.    Now... to catch up on the last couple of days... Lesley and I bought one of those ionizing misting machines 2 days ago at the Tibet store in old-town.  It's really cool!  It's blue and came with a very unstable stand.  It fell over and shattered, drenching the carpet in the process.  So yesterday Lesley went back to the store and got a replacement bowl.  Today we went all over Fort Collins looking for a better stand, and we ended up finding one at Pier 1 imports (which is about 100 yards from my apartment).  It looks good and is stable now.  Scott, Brad, Kevin and I played blackjack last night while Lesley and Alisa went out to Old Chicago's for a mini girl's night.  All in all it was a fun night.  I took Scott for $65, Kevin for $30 and Brad for $25.  Payday is July 4th so hopefully they don't win it all back. :)  I better get in the shower...

      Today was a normal day, too.  I worked.  Brad came over for a little while and we played some Trivial Pursuit.  Now I'm just hanging out with Scott and Alisa (who went to... guess where!.... Old Chicago's tonight).  I picked up the new Lord of the Rings today.  I prepaid for it a few weeks ago and got some free rentals at Blockbuster for it.  Not much else... I'm gonna go to bed.  G'night!

      Today was a normal day.  I worked.  Lesley is on her way over for dinner.  She's going to make me something delicious tonight.  After that we will probably watch a movie or TV for a while.  No big plans tonight.  Scott thinks this blog thing is funny (funny means stupid in Scottese).  Guess I'll just leave it at that for today.

      This is my first ever blog.  What is a blog?  Good question.  It's basically an online journal.  I'm going to post to this site as often as I can.  Mostly just cause I'm bored and it'll help you to keep up with me.  Everyone knows I'm not a phone person, so this is the next best thing.

      Well... it's official.  Lesley and Alisa are now roommates.  Scott, Darius and I moved them in yesterday.  I'm a little sore today after moving Alisa's heavy couch!  Lesley now lives 2 minutes (she timed it) from me instead of 15.  It's a nice apartment with a nice big pretty concealed porch.  Also has a fireplace.  Went down to my dad's today for hot dogs on the grill.  Grandma made some potato salad and dessert.  Was a really good meal.  Tyler was funny in his mimicking ways.  Dad was babysitting him while Jennifer and Ben went to a concert at Red Rocks.    Not much else to say.  Looking forward to a relaxing Sunday.

      Well... quite a bit has happened since I last wrote.  I took a trip to South Dakota with Lesley, my dad, grandparents and Uncle Don.  We saw all the sites, including Mount Rushmore.  We also saw an underground waterfall at a place called Thunderhead Falls.  Lesley, my grandma and I went up this ski lift thing to get a view of Mount Rushmore while my dad, uncle, and grandpa went to the Presidential Wax Museum.  After we came back down we were browsing through the gift shop at the museum.  There was an open door with a wax figure of George Bush, Sr. just inside.  I wandered in and started going from exhibit to exhibit.  I saw about half of the museum before the security guard escorted me out.  Those wax figures are cooler than I expected!  The whole trip was a lot of fun and a good vacation from the daily grind.    I've been mostly working everyday.  Lesley found out that she will get 10 days off from work this August to go to Maine.  I am planning a trip to Maine and Massachussets that same time.  It'll be fun to see her family again as well as my Grandparents again.  It's always a fun and relaxing vacation when it's on the East coast.  One of these days I need to get back to Virginia and Florida.    My mom flies back to Saudi Arabia today.  I got good news on this front the other day.  Ron is quitting his job over there and they are coming back to the States for good in a couple of weeks.  I just hope they make it through these weeks ok and make it home safe.    Today was Father's Day... did everyone see or call their dad's today?  I went down to my sister's house where she cooked enchiladas for Lesley, Ben, dad and me.  They were pretty good, too!  Tyler is getting more and more mobile everytime I see him!  He's crawling around like a wrecking truck now... more destruction is sure to come.  I better get going... Just finishing grilling some hot dogs and don't want to eat them cold.

      Sorry it's been a while.  Just kind of spaced this whole page.    Let's see... my comp is back up and running... had my new motherboard in less than 48 hours! Newegg.com rocks!  Not a whole lot going on now.  Haley left on Saturday.  Tomorrow is Lesley and I's 4th year anniversary!  Wow... that's a long time...  I got some pictures of Haley and Tyler I will try to put up sometime soon.    I am at work right now so I better get back to it.

      Yesterday I came home from work for lunch and my comp wouldn't turn on.  I opened up the case and pressed the power button again thinking it was either the processor or the motherboard.  The sparks on the motherboard quickly told me which component was broken.  A new one is on the way and should arrive on Monday.  This will probably be my last post until then as I am having to use Scott's comp until then.    Lesley, Haley, Jennifer, Ben, Tyler, Dad, and Carol went to dinner at Applebee's.  It was a good time.  Haley got to meet the family and got a free meal out of it, too!    After dinner, Jennifer and Ben brought Tyler over to my house and we were all amused by Tyler's emerging personality.  That kid is crazy!    My slumber was disturbed last night by a very loud grinding sound at about 3am.  It turns out one of my newts found his way into the motor of the filter and was basically sliced to death.  I am probably going to let that 10 gallon tank go until nobody is left in it.  Then I can change the gravel (and get rid of that ugly black and red gravel!) and make it a dedicated newt tank.    I've written quite a bit here so I better stop before I have to publish this and charge people to read it.  Bye!
