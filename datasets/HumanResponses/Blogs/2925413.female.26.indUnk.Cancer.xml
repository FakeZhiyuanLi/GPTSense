      Ahhhhhhhh.... finally peace and quiet.  Got the kid (M) in the bed and company is gone.  Watched The Sweetest Thing (again) and laughed (again).  That movie is fucking hilarious.  The kid came home tonight after spending last night with her mother.  What a fucking attitude she had.   Me and hubby and M and Mariah and Mariah's other kid (L) all went to the Carters Outlet store cuz Mariah is bout to pop out another kid.  I bought her some outfits (3) that are soo cute.  The one has a bear on the ass and then their is one with a giraffe and the last one has a frog on the front. Anyways, great sales and so that was cool.  We ended up going to Cracker Barrel to eat and M was just a little bitch.  She kept telling her mother that she hated her and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.  OMG, I wanted to bitch slap her, but you can't do that to kids.    So after everyone eats M seemed to be fine.  Was even being polite and loving on me.  We all rode back to the house and I gave the 2 monsters a bath and made M write her spelling words.  God she hates doing that.  Finally got her to bed a few minutes ago so that's good.  I'll make hubby take her to school in the morning cuz I wanna sleep late.   The L word comes on at 10pm so I HAVE to watch that.  It's like my favorite show.  I used to watch Queer as Folk but it started to get on my nerves.  The new season of that is supposed to start soon though.  Hopefully it'll be better.  The L Word is supposed to be good tonight, guess I'll see.    Hahahaha.. talked to my friend W earlier today.  He's such a fucking crazy ass.  Had me on ae.com looking at his wish list of clothes.  I told him I'd be his sugar momma, but he'd have to put out...hahahahaha. Too funny.  I love shocking him, he's sooo easy!!  Gotta love me some W... he's such a cutie too.  He cracks me up and that's good cuz not many people do that.  So W, don't let all this get to your head you kinky ho.

      Ahhhhh..where to begin, where to begin.  Here I was thinking my weekend would be un-eventful and pretty quiet.  Well I was dead wrong.  My day starts off with my dog having a seizure in the backyard.  So I blindly go outside in just a teeshirt to pick her up and carry her inside.  My hubby, who woke me up, was actually being nice to her during this and brought her some ice cream (he heard from his boss that he should do this). Ususally he's calling her a whore or cock or anything but her name.  Anyways, I put her on my bed and cover her up and just pet her till she comes out of it.  Last time she had a seizure was at 4:30 in the morning and it freaked me out, but the vet said to just keep track of them and if they happen more frequently then we can put her on meds.  She's fine now, running around and such and just being her usual happy doggie self.   Ok.. so the rest of the day I spent at the laundry mat washing comfortors.  Such fun such fun such fun.. NOT.  My hubby is OBSESSED with the laundry mat or anything that has anything remotely to do with washing machines or dryers.  My mom even somehow got us to wash hers also.    Went and ate at Provino's with a friend and 2 of her 3 kids.  Hubby was also their and it was the last thing I wanted to do.  Taking her is like having a tribe of something or another.  My dad is mean and calls her the dog with the pups.  Hahaha.. it's mean, but funny.  Sad thing is she's bout to have another kid in like a month.  She can't even raise the 3 she has now because right now the oldest is staying with us.  That is something different.  It's weird playing mommy, but at least the kid is in a stable environment.  She's 7 and thinks she's 19.  I just don't know about her.. only time will tell.  Last night she stayed with her granny and tonight she's gonna go home with her mom, but she'll be back tomorrow night cuz she's got school monday.  We went to see 50 first dates tonight.  It was ok, but I'd rather of seen Along Came Polly.  The theater was packed cuz of that Jesus movie.  Good god, just read the bible already.  I don't understand religion.  I mean come on.. but I'll shut up or I'll be typing all night.  The movie itself was okay, but I can't believe I spent $15 to see it and then they had the nerve to charge me 50 extra cents to use my debit card.  Fuck that shit,  I was pissed.   Oh yeah, my sister called my mom today (many times) to cry and whine about how she has to get rid of her cat cuz her landlord saw it and they aren't supposed to have pets.  The last time she called I told my mom not to answer the phone, but she did anyways.  My sister hung up on her when my mom told her she was making her feel bad and that she just wished she'd shut up about it already.  hahaha, it's just a fucking cat.  My dad was mean (not her dad) he said she should take it to Walmart and put $10 around it's neck and give it away, but then he said that whoever took it would take the $10 and leave the cat.. you had to be their.  Well hubby is home.. cya.

      Today has been pretty quiet.  Work is boring and un-eventuful.  The only thing that I can think to bitch about is not being able to take a lunch at 11:30.  The other girl that works here didn't come in until noon cuz she had a dr's appt.  What really got to me is she called at 11:30 and said she'd be in within 10 minutes.. YEAH RIGHT.  So here I've sat since 9am.  Oh well, I'll try to leave at 4 today.  Maybe go home and take a nap and enjoy the peace and quiet.  The hubby gets off at 5:30 and will most likely get on my nerves.    My dogs are outside and I think it's too cold for them to be.  They are just little doggies who are used to the inside. My brilliant hubby is the one who went home on his lunch break to let them out.  They have a dog house and it's not like it's raining, but still, they like napping on our bed.    I have nothing planned for this weekend.  Nothing at all.  I need to be studying for a quiz I'll have on Tuesday, but I just can't bring myself to do it.  God I'm lazy.  I need to stop that shit, but I just don't feel like doing anything at all.  I guess it's depression, but such is my life.  I take Effexor and that helps with the moodiness, but it's also made me so uncaring about anything else. At least when I was on Paxil I felt compassionate.  Now I couldn't care one way or the other.  My hubby just says I'm a bitch.  Oh well, fuck him and everyone else who pisses me off.

      People seriously get on my nerves sometimes.  I mean, this guy is talking to me on Yahoo and is telling me about someone sending him an offline and cussing him out.  BIG FUCKING DEAL, I mean come on, get OVER IT.  So what, someone cussed at you, that doesn't mean you have to dwell on it and get all confused.  I'm serious, he said, and I quote, "is to me gets me confused" when I told him to get over it and that it wasn't a big deal.  People have issues.  Other news, we sorta got some snow here this morning.  Of course the whole world seems to shut down here.  Schools close, people lose power, blah blah blah.  I'm talking about an inch maybe.  God these people are such pussies.  Me, I went to work, no reason to lay out just cuz there is some snow on the car.    Also, some people are sooo perverted.  Take www.realdoll.com who the hell buys this shit.  Sure, I would to if I had the money to throw away, but in all reality I can get dick whenever, that isn't a problem, but I just wonder about the people who really own one of these.  Do they live in some sick demented world where plastic pussy is the only pussy they can get.  They even have a male doll which makes me wonder what woman would actually spend that much money to get a big ole hunk of plastic that has a dick attached to it.  For petes sake, just buy a dildo already.  People have to get their shit off one way or another, but I just wonder about things.  I mean, when they cum, where does it go.  Anyways, enough bout that.. gotta run.  urlLink

      I feel like an idiot today.  I went to the college to fix some things and in the process I changed my major.  At the time I thought it was a good idea, but the more I thought about it, the more I wanted to change back.  Long story short, I have to go back to the college and fill out another change major form.  ARRRRRR....  Other than that today has been pretty good.  This woman I totally have the hots for called me and wanted to do lunch.  Sniff, I couldn't go though because I had just got back to work, but I was still excited that she called me.  We talked for a while and cut up and I got to whoo her with my witty humor.  If only she didn't have a girlfriend and I didn't have a husband... oh well, such is life.

      What a weekend!!  Mariah had her baby on Saturday at 5:24pm.  I got to see Parker come into this world.  Yes, I saw her come on out of Mariah's coochie.  It was different, that's all I have to say, but a really cool experience.  I also got to cut the cord too.  She's a cute little baby, 8 pounds and 6.9 ozs and 20 1/2 inches long.    Saturday night we went to my moms house and ate steak.  My uncle and his wife came up and Steph and Eric came over.  Then on Sunday we went to my grandparents house and ate hamburgers on the grill.  Then we headed back home and went to the hospital for awhile.

      Life seems to be going on. I have gotten over my little green eyed jealousy thing.  Seems the more Steph tells me about Eric the more I don't really like his attitude about some things. Now don't get me wrong, I think he's a great guy, but just so not my type.  I'm just glad Steph is having a good time with him.  In all honesty I'm waiting for her evil side to emerge once he pisses her off.  Today is my dad's b-day and he's 48.  These last 8 years have seemed to fly by.  Just seems like yesterday he was in the hospital for the heart attacks he had.  Can't believe it has been 8 years since then.  I'm so glad to have my dad around still.  I feel very lucky and privilaged to work with him each day and get to spend time with him.  I love my daddy lots.  I called his b-day in on the Morning Show and he won the b-day cake from Baskin Robbins.  I haven't told him yet, but I know he'll be tickled pink.  My dad loves free stuff!! I haven't got him anything yet, and I don't know if I'll really be able to.  I do have a card for him so that looks like all for now.   My check is so gone this week.  I'm going to have to get into my savings just to make the bills.  Sucks because part of it is the car tag for my car.. $268 dollars.  I mean OUCH!!  But I am driving a 2004 Accord so go figure.    They are putting Mariah into the hospital today to induce her labor.  Me and Evan get to take her up there at 5pm today.  My dad said he hoped she didn't have the baby on his b-day!! He's so mean, but I know he doesn't really care if she did.  Guess this is it for now.. will post more later.. sometime..  maybe tomorrow!!

      Steph came over tonight and when she came in she hugged me and told me she loved me.  We watched some of American Idol, but then she left a few minutes ago to go next door to Eric's.  I'm trying so hard to be ok with this.  I'm trying so hard not to act weird or let her think it bothers me, but it so bothers me.  I don't know why either.  For crying out loud I'm married, but I still think my neighbor is hot.  The green eyed monster in me wants what she is able to give and receive from him.  I want to be the one he calls and im's during the day.  Someone, anyone, please, come knock me up the side of my head and get these thoughts outta me.

      What a day what a day.. got a good night's sleep last night courtesy of Dr. Loratab.  Had to go to the doctor this am and she's put me on some different meds since I have a condition called Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.  Whoo Hoo..lucky me.  Anyways, Steph sent me a txt mssg that said "I love you" so I guess we're ok.  We talked online, but I still can't bring myself to call her. Really don't know what I would say.    Her and Eric have been talking though.  She said he's going to teach her Spanish for some reason or another.  I briefly talked to Eric online last night.  Just basically hi and goodnight.  He asked if I was going to come look in his windows, I just didn't even answer that.  He is a great guy though.  I just ain't going to ruin my friendship with Steph over a guy, it's so not worth it.    I downloaded some ring tones for my cell phone.  I'm such a retart too.. I downloaded the Pink Panther thing and then Whip It.  The Whip It makes me think back to a day when I was driving in town and saw a humpty ass Geo with WalMart hubcaps and the backwindow tinted.  The driver, who looked like she was stuck in 1983, had her windows down and this song blaring on her radio.  It just cracked me up to be stopped behind her cause I could hear it loud and clear.  So anyways, it's now my ringtone for when people call.  The Pink Panther thing is for when I get txt messages!!

      I sent Steph an email.. she sent me one back. I sent her another one.. she sent me one back. I still haven't talked to her on the phone, my day was so shitty. This is what she said back to my 1st email...   You still don't see the point.... You set there and want me to met guys, want me to talk to them want me to go out with them and so on. Then you get mad when I do...just like KERRY! You got mad cause Keith talked to me, now Keith doesn't even speak to me and he does you. But am I mad about it no.... I could care less cause he's just a guy. Not to mention you hadn't told me anything....Evan had to. How fucking sorry is that? But it was you saying/wanting me to mess with Eric... Maybe he's not my type... I don't know, I don't even know what my type is. Different things attract me to people... Look at Mitchell Fain... wasn't my type at all, but somehow I fell hard for him. The point here is that you can't see is that you was saying all this shit to him... I don't want to mess with/talk to/go out with/ anyone you are remotely interested in.... I don't want to talk with anyone you "cut up" with... I know how guys are... they only want a piece of ass. And I don't doubt for one minute if you said to him that you wanted to suck him off, he'd take you up on the offer. It's a guy thing I guess. But for me, that's not how I treat my friends and my friends don't treat me that way. Anyway, having said all that, it doesn't make a shit anyways. Eric said it himself... I have a child 8 years younger than him.... Obviously he has a problem with that.    In your other email you said I was mean to you and I made you feel bad... if that's the case why continue to talk to me? I'm not gonna be around people that make me feel bad so why should you...   The words came out of your mouth yesterday... You said to me... "I'd fuck my neighbor". I already knew this.... It wasn't a surprise to me... nothing seems to surprise me anymore. Maybe I am mean to guys... but you know what... I don't have to justify what I do or how I do it. I treat everyone like I want to be treated until they piss me off... And when I look at you I don't see an ugly fat bitch as you said.... I see a funny person that makes me laugh that really has some great talents but don't or won't use them  This is what I said back...  Sometimes I don't know how to talk to you Steph.  You are pretty damn intimidating sometimes.  You don't know what it is like to be me, how I feel sometimes or the things I even think.  I envy you to a point because of all the things you are that I'll never be.  The point is, in my world, all I have is sex to have someone interested in me.  People don't see me as you do, they see the same thing I see when I look in a mirror everyday.  Is it so bad to want someone to look at me the way they look at you?  It's not intentional what I've done to you, it really isn't.  I guess to a point I'm jealous of you because you just seem to have it all together.  Me on the other hand, I just feel empty and numb inside.  I know guys just want sex, but for one second I don't feel empty or numb.  I feel like I matter and that I am something, but I guess that is something you wouldn't understand.  You know that I don't have many friends and the ones I do have I push away in some way or another.  I guess it's just meant for me to be alone because all I do is fuck things up.  I'm sorry I hurt you, I'm sorry I talked shit to Eric and every other guy you were talking to.  I know what I am, now you do to.  For what it matters now, I wouldn't do anything with him, maybe before, but now I wouldn't.  It's you he's interested in, it's you he calls, and it's you he wants.  You were always my best friend, it's just hard to open up sometimes.    This is what she said back...  But that is what best friends do...they open up and tell the deepest darkest secrets or feelings that they have... they don't try or not try to hurt each other.  They are honest with each other even when the truth might hurt or the other just don't want to hear it.   And I don't mean to be intimidating!! It's just how I am and life and people made me that way.... I just don't understand why you would be jealous of me.... I'm just as fucked up as you are... We just look at things different. But I'd never do anything like that to hurt you... and I am hurt that you have done these things to me time and time again....   As of yet I haven't said anything back. I just don't know what to say.

      Steph and I are fighting.  She is mad at me over a guy. The guy is my neighbor and he likes Steph, not me.  This is what she said to me this morning.   Steph (9:51:03 AM): The next time you want me to "fuck" with a guy.... don't "fuck" with him yourself..... It's rude, it's not very friendly considering I'm supposed to be your best fucking friend!  So I tried to talk to her, tried to point out that she said he wasn't her type and that she wasn't interested.  She said I talk to much shit and he isn't the first guy I've done this to.  For the record, I've never ever slept with any guy that she has "talked" to or even slept with herself.  She pisses me off because she always has to be the center of attention. She doesn't understand that this guy likes her, not me.  He isn't interested in me, and I'm not suprised.  Guys always like Steph and guys never like me.   Sometimes I just want to die.  I lay in bed at night and cry because I feel so numb inside.  Things that should affect me don't.  I guess my doctor said it best when she thought I could care less if I lived or died.  Just goes to show you I gotta re-build those walls around myself.  Damn people and them seeing right through me.

      This weekend has gone by so fast.  Friday I went and got my hair done and she cut a good bit off of it.  The highlights and color I just don't know about.  It's different to say the least.  It's still too short, but I guess it'll grow back out and look better in a few days. I think my hair went into shock.  Anyways, Friday night was pretty un-eventful.  Steph, Evan, Mariah, Mikaela, Greyson and me all went to see Taking Lives.  OMG, don't waste your money.  I was like "what the fuck" it was so stupid.  Good thing Steph had free passes or I would have been pissed.    Steph and I also went on a stalking mission.  Come to find out the teacher was at the movie and Steph had sent an email earlier that day to him about some things and he just pissed her off basically.  So we were on a mission to find out what the wife looked like.  Basically we sat at the theater for 45 minutes before him and the wife came out.  Anyways, Steph had to take me to get my car from the dealership and after we got it we went stalking again since they weren't at home.  Found them at the Chick-fil-a and basically watched them and followed them home.    Saturday my mom and me and Evan went to NC to gamble.  It was an okay trip, won a little but spent it all back.  My mom won a jackpot and she was pretty excited.  Said she was going to buy some pool furniture with it and other stuff.  My dad was happy too.  He went to AL and bought another car.. go figure.    So last night Steph came over and we invited my neighbor over.  He's a cutie and so we all cut up and watched TV.  They all didn't leave till after 1am.  He's pretty crazy and has a gf, but he won't let her spend the night.  hahaha  Sunday.. gosh, I didn't get up till like 11:30 this morning.  I cleaned up my car on the inside, but didn't wash it.  Was too windy outside so I took a shower and Steph came over.  We went to Panera Bread and ate lunch and walked over to Michaels to look around.  Ended up buying some flower stuff for the neighbor and making him an arrangment.  He liked it and he came back over earlier and watched TV some more.    Mikaela came back home tonight.  Back to school for her tomorrow.  Lucky us I guess.  I missed her and all, but the quietness was kinda nice also.  Kids sure do get bored easily sometimes.  Oh well, she's in bed now.  Off to watch the L Word now..

      I literally feel like shit today. Either I'm getting sick or my sinus's are fucked up, take your pick.  I'm poping Sudal trying to catch it before it gets worse.  I wish I'd feel better for once.    Finally got Evan's glasses.  After I called and bitched at Pearle and he called and bitched at Pearle we got somewhere.  Seems the manager lady didn't bother to tell us that the lenes would take 7 to 14 days to come in since the frames were different.  The lens cutting man said if he picked different frames we could have them today, so at lunch we went and got different frames.  At least he has his new glasses now.    He's wanting to go to Cherokee Saturday, which I just don't feel like doing.  He's been whinning for the last 2 weekends about going and he seems to have my mind up about this.. but I still don't want to go. Guess we'll see.  Tomorrow I get my hair done.  Highlights and all that fun girly stuff.  I so need them, my roots are showing pretty bad, but not too bad.

      I PASSED MY FINAL!!!!!!  I also got an A for the quarter and I'm sooo glad.  Least Hope will pick up classes for the Spring Quarter.   Nadda lot going on today either, though it is still early.  Didn't do much last night either, just pretty much took it easy.  Mikaela stayed at her Granny's house last night since she was sick.  Mariah said if she didn't have the baby by the 26th they would put her in the hospital.  Guess we'll see..

      Nuffin much going on right now.  Weekend was awful, fought with Evan the whole time.  God men are such assholes.  Had to buy him new glasses yesterday for reasons we won't go into here.  I have my CRJ101 final tonight and I haven't really studied.  Hopefully I'll do okay, who knows though.  Mikaela has strep throat, her momma took her to the doc earlier.  Steph is a hoochie momma.. can't look at the couch in my office the same anymore!! hahahaha.  Oh well, life is living. Will post more later!

      The chicken must be gone.  I can honestly say that I haven't seen it since Monday or Tuesday.  Guess someone caught it and ate it.. yuck.  Poor chicken.  Evan is totally pissing me off today and today isn't really the day to be pissing me off.  I don't know what is wrong with him, but he has been such an ass lately.  Bitching about this and bitching about that and it's getting old.  Enough is enough, but it seems it never ends with him.  He is always finding something or another to go on and on about.  Everything from me not helping with laundry to not cooking dinner.  Well hello, I basically take care of Mikaela.  That itself is a job in its own.  Yet the way he talks it's like I never help do anything which is so untrue.  He doesn't realize that besides taking care of Mikaela and working all day that I do go to school part time.  UGH.. I better stop or I'll be going on forever.  My tattoo is healing nicely.  I feel like a snake who is sheddig its skin cuz it's all dry even though I keep putting the stuff on it.  I like it alot though, I'm so glad I got it.  Think this is going to be the last one unless I come across something else I really really like.

      I can't believe I didn't post about my new tattoo.  My mind must be going or something, but anyways Friday night I got a new tattoo. WHOO HOO.  It's on my right wrist and it is my zodiac symbol with the crab around it.. it's sorta tribal looking.  It's soo cool too.  It's outlined in black and colored in blue with some yellow which  makes some green (yellow and blue make green).   This makes my third tattoo.  The first one I got on my 23rd birthday and it is also my zodiac symbol and it's on my right ankle.  It's also blue, but a different shade.  The 2nd tattoo I got around my 25th birthday and it's a dragonfly on my left wrist.

      It's Sunday night and it's back to work tomorrow.. blah.  The weekends seem to go by too fast sometimes.  This weekend hubby and I went to Cherokee NC to gamble and my sister tagged along.  We just went up for the day and had a fun time.  We hardly took any money but we came home with a shit load.  WHOO HOO for me, I hit a JACKPOT!!!  I was sooo excited.    We finally got home around 10pm last night and it was off to stalk my bestest friend Steph's teacher (don't ask).  It's nothing too pervy, it's her college teacher.  Come to find out he lives just a few streets over from me.  They've been sending each other some very questionable emails, but they are fucking hilerious.  She called me on my way up to Cherokee yesterday to ask me what she should reply to the one... haha, I'm so evil and bad for the things I say.  She said she doesn't want to go to class tomorrow, but I told her in all she only has 5 classes left.    M came home today and she went with us to Wally World and we got her some short outfits since the weather has been nice and sunny.  She was pretty excited I guess cuz she put one on when we got home tonight.  Then it was off to Toys R Us where we bought Mariah a car seat for her new brat she's bout to pop out.  God help her, she needs to learn what causes that shit!!  Hubby and I were also nice and took her to Chili's for dinner. Sixty dollars with tip.. arrrrr, but that was for 3 adults and 2 kids meals.  Oh well, it's only money.    I'm home now and I'm glad, though I can't go to bed till 11pm since the L Word comes on.  Yet, I'm gonna crawl into bed soon and read a book I got a Barnes and Noble today.. Steph was looking for some "fill in the blank" activity books... some R rated ones, but they didn't have any.  hahahahahaha

      The chicken is still hanging around.  I saw him when I left for work yesterday morning and again when I got home from work.  I let M chase him around our neighbors yard to try and wear her out some.  Lol, it was so funny seeing this kid running after a chicken who was dead set on not being caught.  He was bawk bawk bawking and running his fool head off.  Hubby came home soon after and we all went inside and neither one of us felt like cooking.  I was sick and didn't even feel like leaving the house so it was pizza night.   I went to sleep about 6:45pm and then got up at 8:30pm to watch Will and Grace.  Then it was back to bed at 10:30pm.  I'm feeling better today though.  I'm just soo glad that it's Friday.  Hubby is wanting to go to Cherokee to gamble this weekend.. blah.  Guess we'll see.

      Okay, so I'm pulling into my driveway chatting to W on the phone and what the hell do I see.. a fucking chicken.  Yes, a chicken in my yard.  Now I don't live in no ghetto place where chickens should be running around.  W is laughin at me on the phone cuz of the chicken and I made hubby come outside too.  I didn't want anyone thinking I was making this shit up cuz sometimes people don't believe 7 year olds.  Crazy crazy shit.. the fucking thing is still out there too.   Hahaha.. M hurt W's feelings today.   I had to go by the studio to pick up some tickets I won and I had called W to tell him since he works there.  So W comes up to the front and M is like "where is G"... hahaha.  It was too funny, but M really did want to meet W.  SO W, DON'T CRY!!!!!!!!

      Today seems to be better so far.  Hubby is being super nice and I'm so still pissed at him.  He just thinks that everything is ok when it isn't.  We went to lunch together and it was ok, I would have rather been somewhere else.  I got school tonight which really sucks.  If I didn't have a quiz tonight and if I hadn't missed the previous class then I wouldn't have gone tonight.  I'm so not prepared for this quiz.  I mean, I've read the 2 chapters, but it's just not sticking.  Oh well, guess we'll see.   Talked to G this morning and she's so super busy.  I'm just glad we got to talk for a few minutes though. She's doing this thing for her work for the next 2 nights and so she's having to get all that crap together.  I wanted to be there for her tonight, but damn school says otherwise.  I hope she understands cuz she asked me if I was coming.    I get to leave work early today and go get M from school and take her to my moms since hubby doesn't get off till 5:30 and that's when my class starts.  I have to be at the school by 5:15 so I guess I'll leave here about 4 to get her.  It's raining today and all yucky and I hate driving in the rain.  Speically since I gotta drive almost 30 min to get to school.  I so hope he lets us out early tonight cuz I really don't want to stay till 10:30.    Work is so boring right now.  The phones are dead and it's quiet and the only thing that would make it super better is if everyone else in the office wasn't here.  Blah.. today is a blah day.

      My husband is so pissing me off tonight.  He's mad at me right now because I want to write in this instead of going to bed.  Last time I checked I was 25 and he wasn't my father.  What really pisses him off is that I won't link him to this to let him see what I write.  He says that I let other people I know read this, but that isn't true.  There are only 2 people that I know that I have linked to this blog.  When I feel like sharing my feelings with him then I will, until then he can fuck off.  He thinks that by calling me a whore and a bitch I will let him read these things, but he is so wrong.  Just because I want to put my thoughts down he gets all paranoid.  He so thinks I linked this guy I used to see to this site and once again he is wrong.  My hubby is so clueless.  If he would just learn how to treat me and talk to me then we would get along fine.  He thinks that by talking shit to me and trying to bully me then I'm going to back down and give him what he wants.  He is so wrong.  God I fucking hate him sometimes.  Marriage sucks, don't do it.. run the other fucking way.

      So much has been going on, yet I'm too lazy to really post about it.  I'm still in school and this morning class is killing me. I'm so not a morning person. Steph and Eric got a dog.  Some little white fluffy thing that has colon problems.  They paid $500 for a broke 8 month old dog, but it is cute.  My windshield in my car is cracked so now I'm driving around in a ghetto ass car.  I don't really have the $100 right now to get it fixed so it'll wait until I do.  I have to pay my speeding ticket tomorrow that I got back in Feb.  $78 fucking dollars, you'd think I'd learn to slow my ass down.  Oh well, such is life and sometimes it sucks.  Thats all for now...

      This time change has really screwed me up. I'm not used to it and I can't believe it's already 9:30pm.  Ate at my moms tonight with Evan and Steph and Eric and Mikaela.  Earlier my mom made me go with her to Kroger to get food and I had her get some dog food for my doggies since I'm broke.    Anyways, Evan and I kept Parker earlier today.  That was pretty fun.  She peed on me when I was changing her diaper, but I still had fun keeping her.  We only had to keep her about 2 hours while she took her other 2 kids to the movies.  She wanted to do something with them since she's had the baby.   Oh well.. I'm gonna get off her and go watch some TV, I'll update more later maybe..

      Hummmmm... well I started school last night.  Blah.. it was okay, a few people from last quarter and defiently a lot more in the class.  Had class this morning also at like 8am.  I'm just not a morning person.  Getting up at 6am sucks, but I was on time to class and it's different.  I like the quiet time and the drive, I just hope I make it through it.  After this quarter I can switch to the Associates Degree, but then I'll have more math and english, but it'll be a degree instead of a diploma.  I'm still not sure what I'm going to do with my CJ degree, but I'll figure it out sometime.   Not much is really going on in life. Just sorta quiet and drama free... yay!!

      Well Steph is on a rampage.  She's pissed, she's mad, she's out for blood.  I can't say that I blame her, but I so don't want to be involved in all this crazyness.  Seems Eric is trying to get back with the xgf and Steph is seeing red.  Eric had the nerve to tell her that everytime he and Steph had sex he was thinking of the xgf.  I mean come on guys, you don't say that to the woman who is carrying your child.. you don't say it period.  That just flew all over her.  Then he had the nerve to tell her that her and the xgf need to try to get along cuz she'll be coming with him to pick up the kid. The kid hasn't even been born yet.  Lots of things can happen between now and then and it's just so crazy to even think that far ahead.  Maybe it's just me that doesn't think that far ahead, but still.   I feel like I'm in some sort of HS soap opera.  It's crazy madness right now.  Steph called the xgf's mom this morning with the intentions of talking to the xgf, but she had already left for work.  So, Steph informs the mom on what is going on.  OMG, funny shit when she told me.  I so wish I could've been on the phone, but I still can't believe she did it.  She's plotting and planning all these evil things to do, but I think she just needs to let shit go and concentrate on her health and other productive things.  It's obvious that Eric isn't worth this much energy, but she doesn't see it that way.  She had to go to an appt today about the baby and Eric was supposed to meet her.  Well, she called and changed the appt so she wouldn't have to see him.  She didn't tell him so he'll be sitting up there like some idiot.. that is if he even shows up.  Oh well.. I'll keep you posted.

      Yeah umm so Steph and Eric broke up yesterday.  Basically she can't trust him and he's tired of the fighting.  Steph is upset cuz she's pregnant and doesn't want to do this alone, but Eric said he'd be there for her all the way, he just can't be with her.  What it comes down to, he still has a thing for the xgf and he's been calling her.  Guess Steph's gut instinct was correct.  Time will only tell where this drama scene leads.  Pray for me, I don't know how much longer I can handle the stress...

      What a weekend, what a weekend, what a weekend...  Here I was thinking I was going to have an un-eventful, quiet weekend.  Was I wrong as hell. Steph comes over on Saturday, tells me she thinks she's pregnant, and has bought a test to see.  Yet, she is too scared to take it.  Finally she takes it and yup, she's pregnant.  She freaks out, takes the 2nd one later and yup, still pregnant.  In a nutshell she took a total of 5 test and all came back the same.. pregnant pregnant pregnant. They haven't really told anyone, like his mom or her mom, but basically our little circle knows.  Steph is just freaking out, her kid is going to be 15 this July and she just thinks she's too old to go thru this again.. she's 31.  You would think things would be pretty calm... NOPE cuz that would be too easy.  Steph is still hell bent on thinking that Eric is talking to the X and she is hell bent on finding out the truth.  All I have to say on that is if he is then Steph will find out and then it'll be a bad bad day for him.   Went swimming at Mom's Sat and Sun.  Got some sun and relaxed as much as possible.  I didn't feel too hot on Saturday night or on Sunday.  I don't know what is wrong with me.  I'm really sleepy at times and it'll get to be bedtime and I'm wide ass awake.  It just pisses me off cuz I hate getting up in the mornings and I need all the sleep I can get.  Had the kid this weekend.  She's been back at her moms for almost a month and Mariah brought her over on Saturday.  Seems the kid is mis-behaving at school and at home, etc.  Well big fucking suprise.. NOT.  She's lying and stealing and just being a brat to her mom.  Nothing you say to her seems to sink in and so Mariah just brought her over on Saturday and Evan dropped her off at school this morning.  Don't get me wrong, she's a good kid, but damn such a responsibility.  I'm happy with just my doggies..

      I was bad and didn't go to school this morning. I just wasn't into the whole getting up at 6:30am thing.  Sad thing is I didn't come into work until 10am.  God I'm so lazy sometimes..   School last night sucked. Had a quiz and I made a B on it, but it still sucked.  Good thing was we did get out around 9:15pm so I was glad.  Went home and watched some TV then went to bed.  Don't I lead such an exciting life.. WHOO HOO

      Ever just feel like your life sucks big time and that each day just doesn't seem real.  I feel really off today, like something isn't right.  Maybe I'm just abnormal, but hell that isn't a big suprise.    I just wonder about things sometimes and I wonder why I even wonder about them.  Just silly little un-important things that nobody ever would really think about at a given moment in time.  I'm not really going to go into it because it just makes my head hurt.  I'm just having a fucked up day today.  I didn't get outta bed until 11:30 this morning and I didn't come in to work until 1pm.  I just feel so blah towards everything and everyone.  Yet, I feel guilty for feeling this way.    I'm not in the frame of mind to be going to school right now, but I know if I don't go then I just won't go back.  Yet, I feel guilty for feeling this way because this is the first time in my life that I've actually made an effort to pull myself together.    My husband really let me down last weekend.  That's probably where all these feelings I'm having now are coming from.  We went to Cherokee NC on Friday and I suprised him by getting a room at the casino for the night.  Basically he spent money that we didn't have to spend and it just put a strain on everything.  He had to borrow against his next check to cover the checks that we had wrote out for bills.    I don't like being broke or put in the situation where I'm stressed out more then I should be.  He just really irks me and I still don't even know why I put up with it.  Sometimes I feel like we'd be better off going our seperate ways, but he just won't leave.  He's like a leach that just won't detach himself from me.  God, I know that sounds ugly and all, but I'm tired of the way he makes me feel.   Take last night.  I had school and so he has all this time to himself before I get home.  I don't ask for much, but dinner in the microwave would be nice.  We had a gift card from Walmart so he could have gone and picked up a few things, but did he. NO.  So I get home and have nothing to eat and I'm tired and ill and just pissed at the fact that he's sitting there with a Taco Bell cup.  He thought about himself, but not about me.  In the end he got me something to eat, but I hate fast food.

      Just got back from Gulf Shores and I had a pretty good time.  Eric and Steph went down with us, but we rode with them.  Never again is all I have to say.  Needless to say Steph and I haven't talked since they dropped us off on Sunday night.  Overall the trip was nice, the beach was nice, the weather was nice, but the Steph wasn't.  Seems she's been nothing but ill lately and I'm tired of being around it.   I've not been feeling too well lately.  Yesterday I slept 2 hours at work and still didn't feel better.  I had thrown up earlier that morning, but I still went to classes and work even though all I wanted to do was sleep sleep sleep.  Nothing else to report on though.. go figure.

      Yeah ok, so it's Wednesday today and that means the week is halfway over with and that means I'm super happy.  See, I get a 3 day weekend.. whoo hoo. Hell, who am I kidding, I don't give a rats ass.  The days are all the same for me..just one less work day.  Acutally I'm feeling pretty good today.  I got my new car last night.  It wasn't the Grand Prix..that car totally sucked ass, but I did get a 4 door Honda Accord with leather and all the bells and whistles.  It's sweet, it's nice, and my daddy must really love me.  I pay for the car though, but he's the one who helped me get it.    I start school next Wednesday night and I got to get my books sometime between now and then.  Guess it's just a matter of getting up there and taking the time to do it.    I've been messing with one of the South jocks for the past few days.  Sending him crazy emails and just cutting up with him in general.  He's pretty cool.  I saw him once before when I was by the station talking to Wilson.  He was outside smoking and I was like damnnnn.. nice.  Lol, I'm such a bad girl, but it's so fun. Oh yeah Wilson, if you read this, shut up laughing and not a word.. nadda you hear me!!!

      Yeah so ummm nothing much is going on with me.  Had a very un-eventful weekend.  Just a lot of rain and staying close to the house.   On the other hand though, I am trading in my Honda for a Grand Prix.  I'm just tired of my 2 door Honda that seems to be small compared to the Grand Prix.  So, lucky me gets to clean up my Honda real nice and pretty tonight and pray that it doesn't rain.  Went and bought wax and some stuff to clean the inside.  Don't get me wrong, my car is pratically perfect and clean, just gotta get the dust off. HAHAHAHA.   Hopefully I'll have my new car by Wednesday if not sooner.  WHOO HOO, I'm so excited.  Can't wait to have a 4 door car again.  Plus it'll be so much faster with much more power.  Four cylinder cars suck ass.

      I'm feeling pretty good today, a little sleepy, but neverless pretty good.  Work is so boring today, not much going on at all.  I've been playing on Pool on Yahoo trying to keep myself entertained, but it just aggravates me after a while, so go figure.   Didn't do too much last night.  I don't even think I left the house after I got off work.  I did give my dogs a bath cuz they had fleas on them and I was tired of being bitten.  I don't think Daisy is feeling too well cuz she hasn't really been eating all her dinner and she usually gobbles it up.  She was being sweet (as always) and laying on my chest with her face pressed against mine.    Evan and I watched the Simple Life 2 last night and all I can say is OMG.  I don't even know them, yet I was so embarassed for them.  Who the hell orders $22 worth of food from Burger King. I mean come on, plus they left their truck and trailer parked in front of the drive thru since they couldn't clear it and went inside to order.  Move the damn truck/trailer already.  Then they didn't even have enough money to pay for the food. They just tripped me out.  Cool show though.  Don't know anything else really.  Just here today, that's all I can say.  Drama free and loving it!!!

      Yeah, so I'm feeling better today.  I just checked my grades online from last quarter and not to brag or anything, but all A's.. WHOO HOO!! Lol, I'm so crazy at times, but never in my life have I made all A's so I'm pretty proud.  So I basically have an overall GPA of 3.75 which is pretty good considering this is my 4th quarter going there.  Classes start back on the 7th if July and that quarter won't be so bad since I'm only taking 2 night classes.  I'm just not going to do anymore morning classes at all.. period.    My mom came over last night while my dad cut the grass at his house.  Evan was working late and so I cooked dinner and my mom ate with me.  Evan came home around 6:30 and ate and then Eric walked over to see my mom.  They talked about the landscaping he's going to do once the fence around the pool is finished.  He stayed and good while and then had to go check on a job.  My mom was happy to see him and so that was good.  She also played with my doggies and fed them lots of cheese, lol.  Of course Daisy had to show her the new toys I had bought them over the weekend.    Mariah also came by with Parker and Greyson.  Greyson was excited because she had some new sandles and sunglasses.  Of course Parker threw up all over me when I had her.. yuck, I almost barfed too. Yuck Yuck Yuck Yuck... YUCK.  Mariah finally left around 8:45 to get her other 2 brats from VBS.  I still don't understand that one..   Doug also called last night. I almost didn't answer cuz my cell said ID WITH HELD.. but I'm glad I did.  He said he had to have his nose re-broke last week and so he's been outta of things.  Popping pain pills and just being in a bad mood.  Yet, he said he was thinking about me and wanted to see what I was up to and that made me happy.  He said he was thinking about going up to the lake lot up from his house in Shannon and didn't know if I wanted to meet him. Well, first off it was raining like hell and second I had just taken an Ambien.  So no, couldn't go which made me sad cuz I really do miss him, but there is always another night and another time.

      Had to go back to the doctor today. Nothing major wrong with me, just a check up from the last time.  She wanted to see how the Ambien was working.. it's working great!  Got some re-fills on that so WHOO HOO!!  She also put me back on some sort of birth control pill that isn't like most normal bc pills so we'll see.   We also talked.  Talked about me and my feelings and her take on me.  We've had this conversation before, but it went a little different. She said some things that really got to me and have set me to thinking.  She's a super nice doctor and I like going to her and I can't say that about many doctors I've seen.  Actually I can't say that about any of them.    Talked to a friend I haven't talked to in a while.  She was doing okay and just hanging out by a friends pool and taking it easy.  I didn't really talk to her long because I always sound like a dork when I talk to her and also because I didn't want to intrude on her pool time.  Maybe she'll call me sometime soon and we can do lunch or just hang out.    I'm just sort of in a weird mood.  Sorta happy but sad with a lot of things on my mind.  Sometimes I just think to much and analyze stuff over and over again.  I just wish I knew what was up with myself.  There is so much I want to do at times, but never really do it.  I mean, I'd love to just paint right now.  Not anything particular, but to just have a big ole canvas and a bunch of paint in front of me would be cool.  Then I think about just being outside and writing poems or something, but then I think about the ants that would annony me and I just don't do it.  I'd also like to go for a drive somewhere scenic, but once again I think about the other people driving who would annoy me by driving slow or idiotic.  I hate other drivers, they seriously piss me off.  Soooo, since I don't do any of those things, I just stay at home and play with my dogs.  Harley tripped me out last night while I was watching Fear Factor.  I was just sitting on the bed rooting for the girls to win and he stands up on his hind legs and starts pawing at my hands.  It was super cute, so him and I had to play.  He's a sweet little dog and sometimes he'll actually smile and you'll see his bottom teeth.  It's hilerious.    I went online today and ordered from ABC Distributing.. like I really needed to do that.  I got my doggies some stuff and mostly me some stuff.  Spent about $40, but hey, it's my money.  Plus I don't have to pay for it until it comes so I'll have money then.  Not much else is going on in my life. It's pretty drama-less which is a good thing.  I still haven't heard from Steph, but I don't really think she'll call.  I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss her cuz I really do, I just think she needs time to sort things out.  Lord knows I do.    Maybe one day I'll figure myself out and not hate myself so much.

      So it's Monday.. again.  A new week, a new day, but the same ole crap.  I'm so broke today. I have like $9 after paying out $150 towards rent.  My check totally sucked on Friday.  It was $470 and that was for 2 weeks.  Going to school and being out 1 day really fucked me up.  It could have been better if the hubby and I hadn't eaten out all weekend, but we did.  So, now we're paying the price.  Not only do we not have any money, I also still owe $100 towards my car that's going to have to be paid this Friday.  God I hate being an adult with bills and obligations.  Can't I just be a kid again??  On another note, my weekend was pretty un-eventful. Hubby and I did go to Gadsden to this resturant that totally sucked.  I so can't believe we drove all that way for a suck ass dinner.  Ever since hubby and I have been together he's talked about this resturant as the best thing ever.  Well it wasn't and I'll never ever go back there again.  I guess some peoples perspective of a good place to eat differes from mine.  They didn't even have cloth napkins.. enough said.  As I was going to bed last night I checked my cell phone and I had 1 missed call.  It was from Steph.  I didn't call her back, I have no idea what she wanted because she didn't leave a message.  My hubby says I'm being stubborn by not calling her back, but I just don't have nothing to say to her right now.  It's pretty sad when you go to sleep crying because you're so stressed about things.  Now, just takin a trip to left field. This has nothin to do with anything I've ever posted on this blog before, but I came across this quote and I wanted to post it here.  It has to do with someone who I can't quite seem to get out of my head. I thought it fit the situation perfectly..  **I'm not supposed to love you, I'm not supposed to care, I'm not supposed to live my life, wishing you were there. I'm not supposed to wonder where you are or what you do, I'm sorry I just can't help myself, I fell in love with you**

      Steph replied to my emails earlier. Basically she doesn't consider me a friend and I'm not someone she can trust.  She said a few other choice things, but what's the point on even writing about them, it's not going to change anything.   I tried called her a few minutes ago to see if she was ready to talk and at least this time she didn't hang up, but said she didn't want to talk.  Oh well, I tried, won't make that mistake again.  Sure, I'm sad about this, my best friend doesn't want to be my friend because she says I've betrayed her.  Damned if you do, damned if you don't.  Seems to be my luck as far as things go lately. I haven't cried though, that's one good thing.  I'm not going to let this get to me, I'm going to try to just move past it and let her live her life while I live mine.  True friends are hard to come by, sometimes you find that one and life is never the same, then sometimes you don't.  Life is just easier when no one really knows you.  I'll have to remind myself that everyday.

      So Steph calls me yesterday HOLLERING at me cuz I told Eric she called me from her house.  First off, you don't call me at work hollering at me for something stupid like that.  Second, you don't tell my husband that I need to choose between her or Eric because I'll choose myself everytime.  So today Steph sends me a mssg on Yahoo that says the doctors heard 2 heartbeats.  Wow, that's great, but I just answered "oh" because like I told her "I just don't know what to say."  She comes back with " well you can start by saying that you'll lose my damn number and that you want ever call me again.... you have not been a friend to me and I don't need your shit either."  Followed by that I get "I saw your message last night inviting Eric over.... he told me everything you have told him. Not a friend in my book."  Hummm... so anyways of course she wants to act like she's 2 and sign off Yahoo.  She won't take my calls and she's changed her cell phone number once again.  Okay, whatever, she's a bitch and I know this so I do the only thing I can possibly do at this time, I send her an email.  The email follows as:  You know I really don't deserve this kind of treatment from you.  You're pissed at me for no damn reason and you know that.  I didn't fucking tell Eric anything Steph and you fucking know it.  What amazes me though is that you can sit there and tell Eric that we called you everytime Melissa was over at his house and told you to come to ours.  What the fuck kind of shit is that?  You brought me and Evan into this.  You were the one who sat at our house looking out our front door obsessing over a fucking dog.  You were the one who parked your car in our driveway just so you could go in his fucking house and fuck with his shit.  I've done nothing but been there for you and you fucking know it.  It's pretty damn sorry when you sit there and tell Evan that I have to choose you or Eric, but yet you know I've already chosen Eric.  That's fucking bullshit.  I told you in the beginning I have to live next to him, he's my fucking neighbor.  Excuse me if I want things to be civil.  You're the one who has been acting like a complete fucking immature bitch since you found out he wanted Melissa back.  Get over it, it's fucking life.  You got his ass back, yet you want to keep being evil to him. That's fucked up Steph.  You've done that with every guy and the only reason you can justify is that he lied.  Big fucking whoop.  People lie, you lie, everyone lies.  You want to throw away our friendship over some stupid shit like this, then fine, throw it away.  You just remember who was there for you Steph and put their life on hold to cater to you.  Not once have you called me in the last 2 months to see how I was or what was going on in my life.  The only times you have called me is to bitch and complain about Eric or the evil things you wanted to do to him.  The only time you've come over to my house in the last month is so you can spy on Eric and see if he's home or not.  I feel pretty fucking used Steph, but you know what, I didn't fucking say anything because that's just how you are.  You seem to use people to fit your needs and I was just one of those people.  So, you don't want to be my friend anymore, fine.  Yet you and I know that I didn't do a fucking thing wrong, unless you consider me thinking for myself wrong.    So after I sent it off to Yahoo mail I called her once again to get her lovely answering machine.  I left her a message that she needs to check her email and blah blah blah.  Fucking people, who the hell needs fucking friends when this is the thanks you get?

      That seems to be what my life consists of right now.  Stress Stress Stress Stress and more Stress.  I feel like I'm in a bad game of dodge ball and I'm the only target.  It's crazy and I hate feeling this way.   I went and saw my doctor yesterday.  She was kind enough to prescribe me some sleeping pills since I can't seem to sleep well.  She's also going to set me up with a counselor so I'll have someone to go talk to.    I just feel so down too.  I mean, I don't want to get out of bed and go to work or school.  If I do manage to drag myself out of bed, I sure as hell don't want to get ready for the day, but I make myself.  I'm just blah right now and I don't want to be.  I want and I try to be happy, but I just don't think I have it in me.

      Ever just think that things could be okay for once only to know deep down that they won't? That's how I feel sometimes.&nbsp; I so try to look at the positive side of things, but my negative side just tends to show through more often then it should.   I've been feeling so many different things at different times that it's just hard to sort through how I feel in the long run.&nbsp; It doesn't even make sense to me so I don't even know how I can explain it in words that would make sense.&nbsp; All I know is that I have so many conflicting feelings right now.   On a brighter note, a&nbsp;crazy friend of mine stopped by the office this morning just to say hello.&nbsp; That really made me smile and so made my day.&nbsp; It was totally unexpected and sweet of him to crack me up!&nbsp; Thanks Wilson.&nbsp;   I have my Juvenile Justice test tonight and I'm so unprepared for it.&nbsp; I've done my notes, I've tried going over them, but everything just fades away the moment I've read something else.&nbsp; I so hope I pass this test though.&nbsp; I just can't get into it and most of it is simple things, but I have no idea what format she is going to give us this test in.&nbsp; I'm so used to Bojo's tests and my gut feeling is telling me that this test will be nothing like his.   I've had a witty little converstation with Roy today.&nbsp; Why I put myself through this I'll never know, but it's so nice to talk to him at times.&nbsp; We talk about absoutley nothing important, yet that's what I like about it.&nbsp; Nothing too intense, just something to take your mind off other things.&nbsp; I dunno, I think I'm just setting myself up for something bad in the end cuz that is usually how it plays out in the end, but I'm so hoping differently.   Yeah well, enough rambling for now.. but I will leave you with a little something I wrote awhile back. It totally has nothing to do with anything I've posted, but sometimes it's nice to share..     When the rain is falling  and your nights are cold  And you just feel  like you’re all alone  I want you to know  that you can pick up your phone  I’m always here  whenever you may need me  To listen to your sorrows  and to hold you close  Because I think  you are wonderful  And I know  that you are great  And meeting you has been  a blessing from fate    &nbsp;    &nbsp;

      So ummmm, Steph and I are talking again.&nbsp; This happened after the 4th.&nbsp; We've not really talked about what happened, but things seem to be back to normal.&nbsp; She asked me to take her to the doctor back on the 9th and I got to watch them do an ultrasound on her.&nbsp; It was cool to see the baby and&nbsp;see it&nbsp;moving.&nbsp; She is about 3 months but looks 6 months.&nbsp;  &nbsp; As far as Eric goes, well ummm, he's only getting what he deserves.&nbsp; He was telling me back on the 4th how someone cut Melissa's break lines and he thinks Steph did it, but ummm, she's having a baby and I hardly think she's going to go to that effort.&nbsp; LMAO, if you only knew what I know you'd crack up, but my lips are sealed. &nbsp; On another note I just sometimes sit here and think of all the things I want to write about and say, but I can't ever get my thoughts together.&nbsp; It has been forever since I wrote any poems or just how I'm feeling.&nbsp; I guess the one reason I haven't written anything is because I never have quiet at home.&nbsp; If I go into the bedroom Ev's asking what I'm doing and god forbid I write something cuz he'd just read it.&nbsp; An when I'm at work I just don't really feel like being expressive cuz the phones always ring and I have to focus on other things.&nbsp; I miss being 17 and living at home and being able to do the things I can't do now.&nbsp; God, 17 seems like so long ago.&nbsp; Where has the time went?&nbsp; It's crazy how I'll remember things and where I lived and when I think about it, it's like I never lived there, like it's all just something my head made up.&nbsp; It's like I'm here and now and that is all that matters cuz once tomorrow comes yesterday is gone.&nbsp;

      My b-day was on Sunday. Nothing earth shattering or crazy, just a normal day.&nbsp; It didn't even feel like my b-day, just another day.&nbsp; I didn't even do anything spectacular, just ate lunch with my parents and grandparents.&nbsp; I actually felt like shit most of the day.&nbsp; Go figure. &nbsp; I've had Roy on my mind a lot lately.&nbsp; Why, I dunno, I just do.&nbsp; Sometimes I miss talking to him so much and it really pisses me off because I shouldn't feel that way.&nbsp; I've had 2 weird happenings with him over the last 2 weeks.&nbsp; The first happened back on the 8th and he was on my mind really bad so I broke down and sent him an email.&nbsp; Keep in mind this was at like 10am.&nbsp; So Ev and I go to lunch and guess who's there with his wife.. yup, you got it, Roy.&nbsp; It just totally threw me for a loop especially when they sat us pretty close together.&nbsp; Ok, so the 2nd weird experience happened yesterday.&nbsp; Once again he was on my mind bad and I broke down and sent him another email.&nbsp; Not 2 hours later he calls here to talk to Mandie about her husband.&nbsp; (He is her hubby's boss)&nbsp; Now if that wasn't totally freaky then I don't know what is.&nbsp; I mean, is it some sort of sign?&nbsp; Is fate trying to tell me something?? Or am I just shot out?? I've opted for the 3rd one.. &nbsp; So anyways, I started back to school on the 7th and I'm just taking 2 classes at night.&nbsp; My&nbsp;Monday class really sucks cuz there are a lot of people&nbsp;in the class and it's a different teacher.&nbsp; To be exact it's Roy's wife's boss.&nbsp; How crazy is that.&nbsp; The woman is okay, doesn't really know how to teach, but she is&nbsp;very imformed on the subject&nbsp;she is teaching.&nbsp; My&nbsp;Wednesday&nbsp;class is great, it's&nbsp;pretty small and with people from last quarter.&nbsp; Plus Tom is a good&nbsp;teacher.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; This is about enough for now.. later&nbsp;

      http://hokev.brinkster.net/quiz/default.asp?quiz=Better+Personality&page=1  Wackiness: 100/100 Rationality: 30/100 Constructiveness: 56/100 Leadership: 24/100    You are a WECF--Wacky Emotional Constructive Follower. This makes you a candle burning at both ends. You work until you drop, and you play until you can stand to work again. You have so much enthusiasm that you can find it hard to control on your own, and you appreciate the guidance that channels your energy and lets you be your best.  In a relationship, you require lots of attention and support. You often over-contribute and end up feeling depleted and cheated. You may benefit from more time alone than you grant yourself.  Your driving force is the emotional support of others--especially affection. You can run on empty for miles if you have positive energy behind you. Without it--as it occasionally must run dry--you are depressive, listless, and difficult to motivate.  You need a lot of affection. Get it any way you can, but never at the cost of your self-respect or well-being.

      My husband just really really really pisses me off.  Did I mention he REALLY pisses me off...ARRRRRRRRRR.  He is so not responsible.  He doesn't want to pay bills that are due/past due. He just wants to act like they don't exist and it pisses me off.  I got paid today, but there is only so far my paycheck will go and I don't feel that I should have to spend my entire check on bills that he could help out with.  I'm just so pissed and he doesn't get it.  Whats so bad about it is that most are my bills have to be paid to my father because that's whos name they are in.  It makes me feel like shit to screw my father over, it's not right and I refuse to do it.  Guess I'll just be broke, but I'm so not happy about it.  I'M PISSED AT MY SORRY ASS MOTHERFUCKING HUSBAND.

      I don't know what is wrong with me; why at 26 I still manage to keep fucking up and making mistakes and allowing mommy and daddy to bail me out. You would think that by 26 I would know better and no keep doing stupid things. Why at 26 do I keep allowing my husband to make my life difficult and put us in situations where we have nothing at all. Why do I let him get his way? Is it because I know he'll just throw a tantrum or do I really want to do it too?? All I do know is that I'm broke and once again mommy and daddy had to bail me out. I feel like shit, like a loser, like a disappointment to the two people I know truly care about me. I just wish I could go back sometimes, back to when I was 17 and just change the way things were happening. If I only knew then what I know now I know that things would have turned out differently. Yet, life is only what you make it, so what does that say about my life? Did I make my life shit or am I just too far gone to change the shit I live in? I'm not happy, I know I'm not happy and I know what is making me unhappy, yet I don't have the will to change it. Does that mean I really like living the way I do? Am I just so used to feeling unhappy that I'm scared to know how it would feel to be happy?    So I am the girl nobody knows The one who screams out but is never heard The one who walks beside you and is never seen I am the one who used to be you That is until you killed my dreams

      I’m screaming inside yet no one hears me, no one sees me, no one cares.  It’s a constant noise, this sound in my head.  I get so aggravated, so stressed, so depressed that nothing seems to break through the wall that can’t be broken.  Nobody knows me, not even you.  I wear a mask and stay behind this wall.  I will not let you in, but only tell you and do the things you think I should do.  In all reality I’m not the person I seem to be.  I mock you and laugh at you and cry myself to sleep at night.  It’s hard to be me, this person I cannot be.  It’s a constant headache, a dull pain in my soul.  I go through the motions of everyday life, but I’m already dead inside.  I have no feelings, no emotions, nothing more I can give to you.  I merely exist in this world, in this life.

      I feel like absolute shit.  I don't know what is wrong with me, but something is.  Wednesday I threw up bile, Friday I threw up bile, Sunday I threw up bile, and this morning I threw up bile.  My doctor is supposed to schedule me for a hyda-scan to see if it's my gallbladder.  I'm just tired of feeling tired and sick.   Mikaela is back living with us for the school year.  We got her off to school this morning and she seemed pretty excited about going to a new school.  DFAC's is going to pick up the afterschool care fee, but that's ok, it's only $25 a week and it's better then her going to her moms.  When she is with us she acts right, but the moment you get her with her mom her attitude emerges and she becomes an asshole.  Plus when she is with her mom she is nasty.  I mean when she takes a bath (if she takes one) it's with shampoo cuz her mother doesn't buy soap for some reason. I mean come on, buy some fricking soap cuz shampoo just doesn't clean like soap.  I could go on and on, but I'd only piss myself off even more.   Steph had court this morning.  Eric took out another warrent application because he's had a lot of shit happening to him.  She had me go with her and I didn't get to work till like 11am this morning.  What's so bad is that she has to go back this afternoon at 2:30pm.  The judge told them he wanted to look over the evidence a little longer that Eric had submitted.  I just really don't know what to say about all this.. well, I do, but I think I'll just keep my opinion to myself on this one.  Well, at least until things finishing unfolding.
