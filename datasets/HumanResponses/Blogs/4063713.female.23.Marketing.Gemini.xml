      IMPULSIVITY.&nbsp; This has been the root of all my problems for as long as I can remember.&nbsp; It has also been the source of a lot of the funny in my life.&nbsp; I once got out of bed and went to the grocery store&nbsp;at 3 in the morning during a blizzard because i saw a commercial for Cream Savers Pudding.&nbsp; I don't even like pudding.  I get myself into all kinds of crap on a daily basis because I don't think about anything until it's too late.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also very easily persuaded.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not at all stupid, but just not very detail oriented.&nbsp;   I had to do my walkthrough&nbsp;yesterday at the house I'm moving into.&nbsp;&nbsp;My future roommates and I were supposed to meet the realtor and go through the place citing any problems we had that needed to be cleared up before we move in 2 days from now.&nbsp; This would have been a great help had it taken place BEFORE we signed&nbsp;a year of our lives over to a slum lord.&nbsp;   We came up with 2 pages of&nbsp;things that are not up to code, and one more page of suggestions that we would like done.&nbsp; I'm talking about&nbsp;nongrounded outlets by sinks, dangerous things like that.&nbsp; I guarantee that none of these things will even be considered.&nbsp; We shall see.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I have to start this thing out by explaining why I&nbsp;even have&nbsp;a stupid blog in the first place.&nbsp; I recently graduated college, and just started a new job. I thought I could be perfectly happy moving home with my parents and "saving up money" (aka spending money that would normally be allocated toward rent on alcohol and cigarettes).&nbsp;But... I guess my time at college made me forget&nbsp;how insane my mother is and how my younger brother steals my beauty products/clothes/car/other things. &nbsp;So I decided to move out.&nbsp;   Actually, I didn't really "decide," so much as "signed a piece of paper without thinking anything through." At first, I was excited that my rent was so cheap ($430/month). But when you actually sit down and think about it and realize that I will be living IN A DUMP ABOVE A GARAGE WITH NO INSULATION my low rent starts to make a little sense.  Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not really complaining, at least in the conventional way that most people complain.&nbsp; In my own sick way, I actually appreciate shitty situations like this, because it gives me something to laugh at.&nbsp; I'm almost sad that I never kept a blog or a journal or something during college, because my living situation there was too good not to share with people.&nbsp; I'm sure that will come up eventually in this blog though.  In fact, that brings me to the point of this first entry: why I decided to keep a blog.&nbsp; I was way too lazy in college to document aything that happened to me there.&nbsp; Every day I wish i had, but too little too late, right? Not this time.&nbsp; The pile of mouse shit all over the floor of my soon-to-be bedroom made me realize that the year I will spend in my new shining palace of crap will be full of wonderful surprises, fire hazards, and other dangers.&nbsp; Dangers that are too funny to keep to myself.

      Hmmmm.  House progress.... Well, everyone is all moved in (except me of course).  They got new furniture, got a phone/cable hooked up, etc.  The actualy house looks really nice, and the garage still looks like shit.  The landlord refuses to do anything about and won't return any of my phone calls.  Tonight I am going over there for dinner and to see all the nice work that my roomates have done that I haven't even lifted a finger to help with.  I'm sure all the new stuff looks great and they did a painstakingly good job of setting it all up.  HOWEVER.  I came across some news today regarding the status of this house.  The people at the town's housing authority have alerted me that the friggin place isn't even zoned for rental.  Not just the garage, but the ENTIRE HOUSE is not supposed to  be rented out.  A guy from the housing authority is going to stop by some time this week to check the place out.  And then guess what?   EVICTION!  A bunch of girls, one of which has two small children, will be out on the streets with a bunch of brand new furniture and nowhere to put it.  Except me.  I have a place to put my furniture.  Good thing I didn't move any of it into the house yet. Hah.  As funny as this whole thing is to me, I'm sure it's not so funny to these girls who have put a month's worht of sweat into moving into a house.  I'm also pretty sure that they would all like to see me get stabbed in the face.

      I am building up my legal battle against the larndlords and realtors that screwed me over.  I have yet to contact this landlord, as she won't call me back.  The funniest thing about this is, well, pretty much everything.  Apparently, she is of Indian descent.  She is also one of fifteen (i shit you not) children.  The way it works in her family/religion/culture/whatever, as each child grows up, their father sats them up with their own business.  This is hers.  So basically, she was just given a house and not really told what to do with it.  Thanks dad!  The process is going very slowly, so for now, I will revisit the days of my old houses and roommates past.  Let me explain:  Everybody makes mistakes.  This is part of life.  One of my biggest was staying around my home town because of a guy (who I broke up with before I even attended college, but that is a whole other funny story in itself).  Because of this huge loser, I decided to forego what was supposed to be the best part of my life and attend community college.  This worked out to my benefit in hindsight because it ended up being significantly less expensive and I didn't screw up my life as much as my fellow peers who went away to college did.  Although I wish I had.  After taking 3 years to get out of County College, I made the same mistake AGAIN.  This time, with a different guy.  I had a bunch of schools lined up, but when it came down to it, I ultimately decided on my own state's university so we wouldn;t have to deal with a long distance reltaionship.  I can't believe I am actually admitting that i would be this stupid.  Good thing I don't have any internet friends.  Nobody reads this anyway.  So now I'm all set to start my new college in the fall, which is an astounding 45 minutes away from my home town (really cutting the umbilical cord there, Kate!).  It was the second or third week in August when I realized that there was no way in hell I would drive 45 minutes back and forth to school every day on top of having a job.  I had one week to find a place to live.  This is my life.  Luckily, there were two (TWO!) listings on the college website for roommate wanted.  Knowing how great of an idea it was to move in with people I didn't know, I cut my losses and called the two numbers and set up appointments to go see the places.  House #1 was a shit hole in the middle fot eh worst part of town.  There was no parking, and I couldn't shake the image in my head of me getting attacked walking to or from my car at night.  House #2 was your typical huge ass college house with 25 people living in it right across from frat row.  Better location than house 1, or at least the lesser of two evils because, hey, wouldn't you rather get raped by a frat boy than a 250 pound drug dealer? I know I would.   I rang the doorbell of house #2.  Two girls came to the door.  They walked me around the first floor of the house, which was the one I would be living on with 4 other people (2 bedrooms) if I chose to move in.  My favorite part of the tour was when I got to see my potential bedroom/coat closet.  I do not exaggerate when I say that this "room" was 8 feet by 8 feet with no windows.  I'd rather go to jail.  At least in jail they have those little slits in the walls for windows.  My second favorite part of the tour was when they showed me the kitchen and the floor was so dirty that a linoleum tile stuck to my foot and ripped off the floor.  Needless to say, I couldn't wait to move in!  Imagine the possibilities!  For disease!  After the tour, I sat down in the living room and bullshitted with the two girls for a while.  They explained the whole situation with the house.  Apparently, they had been living there since June, and were on the lease until the following May.  They were looking to sublet the house and every time I asked why, they would change the subject.  The only thing they would tell me was that they had found a nicer, newer house up the street.  Now, for any normal person, this would have raised a number of red flags.  I am not a normal person.  Sometimes I don't think about important things, and I needed a place to stay. Badly.  So the discussion continues, and an hour goes by.   I ask to see the "bedroom" one last time.  I said goodbye, got in my car, and cried for the whole 45 minute drive back home to my parents' luxurious castle of comfort.  I got home and didn't mention any of this to my parents because I didn't feel like hearing "i told you so" for three hours.  Then my phone rang. It was one of the girls from the house.  She said they needed an extra roommate to fill a spot in their new nice house up the street and asked if I would be interested.  I said yes right away, knowing that there was no possible way it could get any worse than the living conditions I had witnessed earlier that day.  Forget the fact that I didn't know these people at all, and I didn't know where I would be living or if I would be sharing a room.  It kept coming back to the fact that I needed a place to stay during the school year.  Over the course of the year, the house I was originally supposed to live in was busted for drugs, prostitution, and almost burned down.  Judging by those events, you'd think I made the right decision.  If you kenw the rest fot he story, you'd say maybe I didn't.
