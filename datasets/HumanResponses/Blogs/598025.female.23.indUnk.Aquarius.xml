      you brought this upon yourself. endure the wrath with no complaints.  dont you hate it when your friend tells you to make a webpage? what i hate even more than that is the fact that i actually did it. but what i hate even more than that is that when picking out a template youre thinking 'boy, id better pick out a different template than that very same friend who has a webpage and is forcing one upon me", but then you realize that theres a reason he picked that template, because its the only normal one they offer. what i hate even more than that is that i got really excited because one of the templates was called 'cranberry socks', and since i swim in them ((them, meaning cranberry bogs)) i thought that would be a sure fire winner...which leads me to what i hate most of all. i hate it when something is called "cranberry socks" and it actually is a mauve-y typed color, that doesnt look anything like cranberries, or anything that is made from cranberries for that matter. i mean, it could maybe pass for a piece of white cloth that had cranberry juice spilled on it, that you tried to wash out over and over again until it faded and you gave up....oops, there i go.

      back for more?....sucka  so. off to the save umass rally was my agenda today. myself, the remaining students of 1192 and 2/3 of 88 townhouse apartments all piled into miss meaghan's minivan for an exciting journey to never-neverland...aka the save umass rally on beacon hill. to start the story off right, well, im going to start the story off right, and that is to say that yesterday i was comfortable with the fact that despite me wanting to go, i wasn't actually going to attend the rally. Mostly because none of my friends were going, and well...Im a sheep. So yesterday I come home and my roomies are discussing le rally and turns out they want to go. Im down, Im down.  So flash forward ((or backward, depending from whence you are flashing from)) to this morning. seven am wake up call. excellent. we all know how i like getting out of bed. surprisingly enough i woke up with a little spring in my step, picked myself out a purdy outfit that said "im here to save umass, take me seriously" (read: i didnt wear my usual jeans and t-shirt as to give the school an uncalled for good image). we all piled into the vanny-poo and made our descent.  stop one - rao's. kids have got to have their coffee, right? i mean, jesus, its eight o'clock in the morning for gods sake. piled out of van, piled into raos. iced coffee almond shot...check. strawberry scone...check. at this point i was seriously contemplating the purchase of some yummy tiramisu, but decided against it last minute, i mean, jesus, its eight o'clock in the morning for gods sake. piled out of raos piled into patio seats outside of raos, smoked cigarettes. piled into van. off we go. i somehow got stuck in the middle of the back-back seat...oh la la. and whats worse is that my back-back seat compadres were uninterested in my attempts at striking up a game of hangman. boo...hisssss.  on the road again, taking the scenic route through to palmer and exit 8 on the mass pike, no stops made. listening to deeelyte...great. (?) luckily someone changed it to moby, and then later to some kicking eighties tunes, at which point i promptly decided that it was time to come up with some catchy save umass slogans. some winners included "its too late now for mama cass, so youll just have to save umass", "if youre dyslexic, we can help you read, give us money to mass usave." and also "knock knock....whos there?....save umass motherfuckers"....just to name a few. it was a long ride folks..as you can plainly see. so the city is quickly approaching and someone in the front comes to the most genius realization that we dont know where exactly we are headed. so some phonecalls were made, but decisions however, did not come so easy. coming from the north side of the city i am no help, so i did what i could. when we somehow got steered off course and ended up on 93 south on the other side of the city i chimed in "no worries guys, we can just park at quincy adams and take the train in"...sounded good at the time, since we were knocking down quincy's door at the time. but as we pulled up we realized we were in trouble. there was a line of about ten cars in front of us and we had to wait to get in to the garage until ten cars came out. super! so about twenty minutes later we're in, with a thirty minute train ride ahead of us, and its already noon...oh no!  not to worry, we soon arrived at the rally with not a scratch on us. we were welcomed off the train by a familiar umass personality, this young chap that was in two of my roommates and i's embracing diversity class who we lovingly call "phish concert", simply because all of his stories and examples in class began with "it was like this phish concert i went to this one time....blahbity blah diversity look at my dreadlocks"....you all took that class, you know the type.  so the rally for me left something to be desired. arriving late we were stuck in the back and not only could we not see anything, we couldnt hear anything either. mostly we were blindly cheering or booing along with the crowd. there was however, this one particular sassy black woman who was a professor at umass boston who was astounding. very audible, very passionate and just great overall. i gave her a perfect ten. the only problem was the she spoke only for a short time, and then the old guy who seemed to be in charge of the thing came back, told us it was over and then told us not to step on the flowers. meanwhile my roommate lytta was being interviewed by channel seven, which although im not sure if her footage was aired, im sure there were plenty of "like's and um's" for the whole family to enjoy.  i kind of felt like the whole thing was very anticlimactic. there we were, on the way there, dancing and listening to "be prepared" from the lion king thinking 'watch out boston, we're coming to gitcha"....but then we got there and everyone was just kind of standing around. my favorite part was in the middle of the rally we had to move because some school buses had to come through and we were blocking there way. so for about ten minutes half of the crowd was stuck behind five school buses with no idea what the hell was going on...stilll not being able to hear.  thats pretty much the end of that story. we went to faneuil hall, grabbed some lunch and headed home, and ill be glad to report that i once again reprised my seat in the middle of the back-back because my friends are horrible and im too nice for my own good and i should be shot. no hangman again, but i didnt get to watch everyone else take a nap while i sat, perfectly straight, unable to move, for two hours. faboo!  and on that note im going to make evil eyes at the general population of my house since i've been awake for about nineteen hours and my roommate just brought home three carloads of drunk kids to hang out at our place...suh-weet.  until next time my friends (and by that i mean friend) - adieu, adieu, to you and you and you

      damn, i am what you might call a master-updater, that is, i update with such frequency and finesse that i am almost unstoppable. i wish i could explain this phenomenon, but i dont think i can. other than the fact that i spend most of my time sleeping and at work i dont really know what to say. i actually think thats it, that i dont know what to say. webpages like this are an interesting thing. everytime i sit down to write something, and i do, believe me, i can never think of anything to say that i think people may be interested in hearing. i think the little voice inside my head needs to stop going censor-crazy. i have a problem letting all out of these little things inside because a) im convinced nobody cares and b) im afraid of what other people may think. this is one of my life problems. i need to overcome it. can you help me?  one thing i have often thought of discussing, is my disgusting, overwhelming and extremely embarassing obsession with disney original movies. i know what youre thinking...how could a cool girl such as myself like disney movies? what i say to that, is first of all...there is a large difference between your typical run-of-the-mill disney flicks and said disney originals. second of all, i dont really know why i like them so much. i think it started when i was little and we got cable for the first time, and we'd get those free disney channel previews for the weekend. id get so excited for the upcoming three days of non-stop mickey mouse club and kids incorporated...whos with me? fast forward to senior year in high school when our cable company decided to give everyone in the sunny, funny town of carver mass disney channel included in the regular cable service. I think i was trying to catch up on lost disney channel time. however, much to my chagrin, by the time disney rolled around full time, mmc and kids inc were no longer in the mix. i think that scenario is also a good metaphor for my life in its entirety thus far. anyhoo. i forced myself to watch the disney channel despite the fact that pretty much all they showed was boy meets world and smart guy reruns, two shows which i thouroughly detest. but ho, there is a light at the end of this mouse-eared tunnel. that light is disney original movies. it all started one dark and stormy night. i was sick with a cold, and parked in front of the television one friday evening. my parents were out for the night because their social life is much more full and exciting than my own, and my brother was visiting. i, of course, had the disney channel in my regular channel flipping rotation and noticed that there was some sort of movie on. that movie, was entitled "genius". ever see it? well, i sure hadnt. i found myself completely enraptured in the film and disappointed to no end when a commercial would sneak up on me and interrupt my viewing. this particular film, if you could call it that, was about a young buck who was, well, a genius. this genius, who was about 14 or 15 and should have been in eighth or ninth grade, was actually attending college. not only was he attending college, as part of his scholarship this young lad not only had to attend classes, he also taught a class and had to put in time as an assistant to a mad-scientist type who worked in the basement of the school on a project involving molecular fusion or something equally ridiculuous. sounds plausable so far, right? well, as would any boy in his position, he realizes that even though he has all these great things that most people can only dream of, what he truly wants is to be liked. aw. so then on top of all his other commitments, he enrolls himself in the local junior high, but dresses up as a 'cool kid' complete with shades and rollerblades. he of course becomes the hottest thing since gameboy color in the eyes of his peers, and especially the girl of his dreams, who's father coincidentally enough, coaches his college's hockey team. cut to the end of the film, the hockey team is in trouble and our little genius rigs up some sort of virtual-reality/anti-gravity device that he puts on the players' skates. not making sense? well, it doesnt i assure you. of course the team wins the championship and the genius gets the girl and the respect of his fellow students alike.   reminds me of junior high, how about you? if it sounds completely ridiculous, it should. if it sounds completely implausable, it should. if you think its completely not worth your time, youre wrong. speaking from the point of view of a girl who is terribly well versed in the way of pop culture and has seen dozens upon dozens of award winning and critically aclaimed films, disney original movies are the cream of the crop. and if genius sounds good, just think about this...its probably one of my least favorite disney originals. have i peaked your interest? are you on the edge of your seat? do you want to know more?  yeah, i didnt think so. im sorry. this is why i dont update. i apologize from the bottom of my broken heart.

      sometimes when I jokingly tell old men at the bar to tip me twenty dollars and they do, I think they are expecting more than my fast talking, no nonsense bartending charm...they're expecting blow jobs.  But hey, twenty dollars is twenty dollars, right?  .......right?

      Sometimes I get mad when I try to post pictures of Lindsay Lohan and Aaron Carter as me on Friendster, and Friendster is so goddamn slow and special needy that it wont let me do it...but three days from now you'll go on there and there will be 14 of the same picture, and then I won't be able to delete them, and everyone will think that I'm lame, when really, if it would have just worked in the first place everyone would think I was clever and cool. Man, I sure do love Lindsay Lohan. I wish I could date Aaron Carter and be in a really sweet teen rivalry with the likes of Hilary Duff and Avril Lavigne and such...If I were her I'd sweep their rotten teenage carcasses off the floor with my long, flowing red hair. I would also stop hanging out with Tara Reid and hang out with cooler people, like me ((not me speaking as Lindsay Lohan, but the actual me)) and my friends. We'd drink tequila and make fun of people for being lame. Then she'd tell me what it's like to be pretty and popular and we'd be fast friends.  I don't know that me starting up my blog again is going to be such an idea. I'll surely expose myself as the lame-ass I've always been, but have thus far been successfully keeping under wraps.  Hopefully nobody will read this.  I love Lindsay Lohan.  P.S. - I don't know if anyone else has come across this problem, but first of all, the spell check does not recognize "Lindsay", nor does it recognize "Lohan" - I might have to draft a strongly worded letter about this. Also, the word "blog" apparently is foreign to the "BLOGger" spell check. Imbeciles.

       Sometimes I notice that I start all of my post with "sometimes".   Sometimes you would think that would make me want to stop saying "sometimes".   Sometimes I feel like I should start every post with it on purpose from now on.

      Sometimes, when you've been drinking, and some other people have been drinking too, and those other people are 50 year old men, and you have to drive them home, you feel better about yourself, and yet fearful for the future. Especially when one of said men is a man who tipped you twenty dollars for a hopeful blowjob.  Also, sometimes, when you work at a restaurant, and you have a crush on a customer, and you have, like, one day off a week, and you spend that day off at the restaurant that you work at, hoping that said man you have a crush on comes in...when he doesn't, and you're all pretty and stuff, you get disappointed. Even if he is a 30 year-old house painter.  And sometimes, when you had to go to said restaurant, there are other things you would have rather have done, but you had certain obligations that superceded what you wanted to do, you feel guilty, despite having little to no options otherwise. So, what I'm trying to say there is that although I would have preferred to spend my time drinking with my friends and not my customers, sometimes you have to stick to your plans, because either way you're going to hurt someone's feelings, but hopefully the person you care about more will understand, because they know you love them more and that it won't be the last time you'll see them, and you're not sure if you can deal with a "farewell dinner". It's a cop-out I know, but I was never one for breaking plans, and I was never one for goodbye's. It's never a good thing to be caught between two goodbye's and having to decide which one is more important. But, it is a good thing to realize that one is not a good-bye, but just a "see you around"...because if I had to think of it any other way I wouldn't be typing this right now. I'd be curled in a ball, crying over one of the best friends I've made in my five years in Amherst.   Lytta, I'm glad you're not going to Missouri like Howard. I'm also glad that you don't dream of having affairs with me behind your wife's back. I'll miss you repeating yourself, and yelling at commercials, and wishing we could smoke pot, and missing the dorms, and saying hello and goodnight every tenth time you have to go to the bathroom at night, and making fun of Erin for being afraid of drawstrings, and dodging moths and other such creatures, and complaining about how fat we've gotten since 1192, and how Gordon won't leave us alone, and how the servers don't treat the hostesses with respect, and how some girls just weren't meant for boyfriends, they were meant to be beautiful, smart, ingenius, clever and wonderful all on their own. I hope that when you go home to Peg and Chuck, you don't let him boss you around, because you are a strong, beautiful, intelligent woman, despite what your dyslexia and anxiety tells you. You are one of the more brilliant and wonderful people I have met on my twenty-three years on earth and I am thankful everyday that I've met you. I'm also thankful that when I go home I will finaly have someone worthwhile to visit. You'll always have a place to stay in Western Mass, as long as I am here, and I hope you know that. I hope you know that all the things that I've just written about you are 100 percent true, and that I know that you will do wonderful things with your life. You've worked hard for it, and you deserve everything that you get.   I can't say enough that you are beautiful and wonderful. Watch out Boston, because here comes Lytta. She's a pistol and she's going places.  So this isn't good-bye, but good luck and love, and we'll see you soon, because we'll all go crazy without you.  And I'll beat Chuck up if I have to, we both have arthritis, but I'm soooo tougher...I got this, just give me the word and I'll take him. You were meant for great things and don't let anyone tell you differently.  I love you and I'll miss you endlessly.   Let the sunshine in,baby.

      hey kids, sorry about the intermission, computer on the fritz again.&nbsp; I know you were all on the edges of your seats wondering where I was and when I would be making another earth shattering entry into the wonderful world of blog.  I am in a state of melancholy right now, who's with me? Why can't people just be normal? Why can't people do things without hurting someone else's feelings? Why can't people just step back and realize what the hell is going on every now and again?  Sometimes I think about me, and how I react in certain situations, and then I think about other people and how they react, and I have no sympathy for them. However, the messed up thing is that I do have sympathy for them, even if they fuck me over in the process. My entire life I've let people walk all over me, and I feel like I will for the remainder of my life. I can't seem to put my needs ahead of other people's. I'm so damn accomidating that it makes me sick. It makes me sick that I do that to myself over and over, and it makes me sick that people could do that to me. As far as I know, I don't deserve it. It makes me sick that I let things get to me that shouldn't, because I know what I'm getting myself into and whatever happens is my fault and nobody else's. It makes me sick that things go on right under my nose that to the untrained eye, don't seem to bother me at all, but to me, keep me up half the night because I just can't get over it.   It makes me sick that seemingly a normal boy would never be attracted to me under normal circumstances.  It makes me sick that I get a little bit drunk and post things of this nature on the internet.  It makes me sick
