      Pretty uneventful weekend due to the fact that I have some killer sleeping pills. I wanted to hit the church but I was afraid the ceilings would cave in. Instead I decided to suffer and enlighten through a chain restaurant meal and Ephesians. Church would have been better, and they serve wine.  The three things I must accomplish this week are: unpack an overnight bag from four weeks ago, laundry and change guitar strings. Life is criminally easy.     Rule: Don't eat in chain restaurants.      My personal link to insanity besides what the doctors, my relatives and all my friends tell me, has finally destructed. I am finally learning from my mistakes. I think I really did get struck by lightning a few days ago. It has done nothing for my sex life, but I don't make the same mistakes over and over expecting a different result every time. So to you from Richmond who expect me to drop everything just because you have finally realized what a fantastic woman I am, get real. I hate to see a man make a bad business decision, and letting me cross the state line was poor fiscal planning on your part.       I have put a lot of thought into it...I can't wait to uproot my insanely fun life here to go home and be your wife. I could learn to can food, field dress animals and not expect you home for a few days because I am sure that I am the only one who has managed to outlive my mistakes. And I am pretty sure you would fuck it up pretty soon after I got home. Then I think I would probably burn your house down and steal your dog since you never come home to take care of them you drunk bastard.       You might be able to get laid if you got off the bourbon long enough to get a hard on. I might have moved on to a hottie, but at least I didn't fuck all your friends...but if I come home and become disappointed, that is exactly what I am going to do. And when you are stuck in the hunting blinds or on a fishing boat with your buddies, they can all tell you how great I am in bed. You already know it is true, so it will eat you alive. It's a slower death than beating you senseless or slowly poisoning you or me not coming home.       It will take a lot more than declarations of undying love every couple of months for me to come running home to your roaming arms. Oh yeah, you better buy a bigger boat, and expect me to redecorate so not everything in the room is centered around the television. Oh yeah, and you need a cd player that plays more than one disk at a time. Between making the good old boys sausage before a hunt (4:30am) or after a long hunting/fishing day (11:30pm) and changing cd's for those sorry taste in music having bastards, I get real tired. And you are not allowed to play my guitar.       I'm not going to get married to you, I don't care how many presidents you are related to. I might not even vote republican this year just to hurt your feelings. If I manage to change my mind (in case you come running down here with a large diamond ring set in hand crafted platinum, which I wouldn't put past you, and you could already be on your way), let me warn you that next time we shoot skeet or go bird hunting, sit behind me.  Love always, Stephanielee

       urlLink              South Florida...are you fucking kidding me?     Ambassador of Fun      You never know...as I walk through the park, this is what I found in the trash.  Now I won't be surprised when I see the homeless at the driving range.        No wonder, these were wedges. I think I'll check the bag for balls.       I heard of someone getting so frustrated on the course that he threw his entire bag, clubs and all, into the drink and squealed off on the golf cart. Ten minutes later he was back fishing his bag out of the water. He went through the waterlogged contents, retrieved his keys, threw his bag back into the water and went home.      I go to the range and tell myself over and over, square up to the ball, keep your head down, feet apart and ass out. When you think about it, all women should be able to hit a golf ball.

      Who are those evil bar wenches that are sent out by the devil himself to promote sweet liquor drinks? They descend and vanquish all civility.  One of my favorite bar tricks is to eat a stranger's dinner. There is nothing more offensive than being asked for a bite of your meal by a total stranger. The victim looks at me and says, "you're kidding, right". "I couldn't be more serious. Give me a bite. It looks great. It's a sign of affection", I reply. It gets them every time. I stared down a pizza once at a pool hall. The person pointed at the pie, and I went for it. The black man sitting next to him said, "I ain't seen nothin' move that fast since Lincoln freed the slaves." I mowed through half of the pizza while he talked to me. I run into him and his girlfriend every now and then. We talk about how much greater Woodstock would have been if I had been there. At Kahuna I ate all the croutons off of someone's salad. Another time I ate half of a girl's chicken sandwich while she was fighting with her boyfriend. Some people focus too much on the negative. Everybody knows you have to eat a grilled chicken sandwich right away. Fries, too.  Too many sweet drinks makes Stephanie a hungover girl. I have regurgitated twice. I have managed to put down a toasted baguette with butter from the French bakery across the street. My regular sweet double cappucino was too much for my stomach today. I am also wearing the same clothes as yesterday to work as I IM-confessed to a co-worker. She said that she too was wearing the same pants as yesterday and did not have on any deodorant. I at least got a shower, but I had to use man's deodorant. I smell like a dyke and feel dirty from the clothes. My head hurts so bad that I had to scrounge around for my bottle of aspirin. In it were two aleve and an arsenal of identifiable and unidentifiable kinds of other pills. We need a PDR at work. I just took them until I started feeling better.  My multi-lingual co-workers are speaking Spanish now. I am such a WASP that listening to another language when I'm hungover makes me dizzy.   I followed a friend home from the bar that is two blocks from where I work last night.   (rule: don't call in sick to work unless you have your car)          After getting my pass from the security guard at the gated community, I went racing through his complex and hit a curb. Now my car with a parking pass, is docked in a guest spot with a flat tire. (They used to call me Stephanie "I never saw a curb I didn't like" Parker where I was from.  I can see, no matter where you go, there you are.)  His mother still cooks for him. She comes to Boca from Otherplace, Florida, every few weeks with frozen homemade meals. We go through the freezer every time I stay at his place. Last night we had Sea Bass in white wine sauce and Osso Buco with sauteed squash. No wonder I am sick today.     Finally I make it into work by the hair of my teeth. I am looking for the hair of the dog. My boss just went to the store to get limes for the corona in the fridg. I told her we were out of Tums and aspirin. She said it was in the first aid case under the fridg. I suppose that is where the alka seltzer is that I have been looking for. Luckily I was here on time for the second time this week. I haven't been on time twice in one week ever. It's because I managed to either stay up all night or crash a few blocks away. Believe me, there is every conscious effort to be on time, but the forces are against me in every way. Instead of a watch, I am going to wear a compass.       rule: it's not important where you've been, but where you are going.      Of course, it would be nice to have transportation. I wish I could exit and enter rooms by osmosis. I like being able run things from one place.          rule: it's very important to have a base.

       Never ending preliminaries...   Start paying full price, end with beers are free? What a world. Even with the tempting yard sale of alcohol, I made it home for the first time in three months before last call. I almost got struck by lightning smoking outside in a storm the other day...I must have gotten hit with will power. I have no idea what discipline is, but I imagine will power is a huge part of it.  All I know is, it started with some preliminaries before dinner. Every hour the price of drinks went down. The night got progressively better/worse as it waxed. While my sobriety was waning, some friends managed to hunt me down. Two of us turned into 5...after being there for 4 hours...I should have left. How rude that would have been for the new arrivals. Nobody really knows each other except through me. Had to do the right thing and keep drinking. Cheap, cheap, cheap...my favorite bird. I don't go out looking for drink specials. If I can't pay then I don't play...but when faced with the choice of retail or yard sale, everybody knows that I prefer second hand clothes to fumbling through the racks.  Affording the opportunity to be able not to have to afford it sounds pretty damn good to me.  The first time I ever went out in South Florida, I kept asking for my tab. Ladies drink free that night until 5am. Much different from the conservative Richmond, Virginia, I left behind. I met my first date there. He was showing off his Lexus keychain...isn't the Lexus the same as an Avalon but much more expensive?...and you still get the leather interior. I'm not very impressed with money that doesn't spend wisely. He was pissed, although impressed with my vehicular knowledge. Apparently the Lexus has come a long way, however it still gets sticky when you spill champagne in it, and it sustains the same type of damage when you jump curbs as my Ford Taurus...the best car ever!!!    I moved my car from a two hour parking spot because I was going to leave it there all night (too drunk to drive). The next morning I could not find my keys anywhere. I used to live on a farm, and sometimes I forget which state I'm in, particularly in the state of inebriation. I thought I might have left my keys in the car. They were in the car all right, in the ignition with the car idling, a/c on, playing Rickie Lee Jones all night long. Just jumped in it, threw it in drive and motored on. That's how I roll...I was going to trade the beast in, but it's nice to have something in your life you can count on besides getting your period.          Rule: If your too drunk to drive make sure you turn the car off before you catch a ride.       My new girlfriend came and met us out last night...she's the vaguest person I have ever met. She only goes by one name, like Cher...does the mystery mean she has something to hide? So I asked her, "are you a hooker?"         Rule: Leather tastes funny when you put your foot in your mouth.

Ambassador of Fun                              Rule: Don't hang out with professional ball players...it's a bottomless pit of tequila and attitude.               Went to some snake pit in Boca...my friends brought somebody new for me to play with. He liked my girlfriend and tried to talk me into heading down to Voodoo in the limo because she was not going to go without me. (Safety in numbers...  rule: people that have little regard for their own safety will have none for yours    ).  Twist my arm, free drinks and limo rides...I really did not want to go, I don't like Voodoo...I said I was too drunk to go. The player confessed that he had been drinking since 11am that day. I called him a fucking pussy and told him that I had been drinking since 11am St. Patrick's Day, 1987. I decided to go, evidently he wanted a shot at the title. Good luck, Jr.  (I have born and bred tendencies toward the Redskins, thanks anyway.)

      Today would be Elvis' birthday, who was the most beautiful brindle boxer. Anybody who has had a boxer must know the kind of loss I am experiencing today. I found out yesterday from my ex-husband that Elvis died (on the real Elvis' deathday). If that wasn't enough of a coincidence, boxer Elvis would have been 8 years old today.  My ex and I cried on the phone together. There is nothing like a quickie marriage in Las Vegas to ruin a great relationship. Four months into the marriage, I road-tripped to the Outer Banks in NC for a beach wedding and never came home. I eventually made it home, crashing on the couch at my ex's for six months, and really enjoyed being around the dog, which is god spelled backwards.  One thing about being a free spirit. It is all about letting go. I guess you have to embrace everything right away, because you never know where the wind is going to blow you. Eventually, I put all my things in storage and hit the road. I've ended up in South Florida which is almost a smaller town than the Richmond.         Today's rule: it's about acceptance, not expectants.

         email to fellow blogger:      Somehow your site came up on my search to find a t-shirt that says “I’m not gay but my boyfriend is.” I am a single very white straight (tried to be gay, but women suck) gorgeous woman in south Florida, so you can imagine how the shirt might come in handy. I moved down here 2 years ago in October from Richmond, Virginia. The longest time I have ever been away from home was a 30-day rehab program in Charlottesville. My friends at home would say that I could have a vacation with out going anywhere. Hence the liferule, take a holiday every day. I have about 50 rules that I live by, all resulting from life changing experiences which are going to make excellent chapters in my book…should I ever be mused enough.  I like your website. The birthday in London was something that I could really relate to. I guess when you live like you are a movie star you have to stay in touch with your public, or else they forget about you. That’s another rule, but I stole it from Coal Miner’s Daughter. I’m glad things worked out for you in London…I have had the same experience here in Florida (it’s a dog track, but it’s fun). Most of my friends here are from NYC. I’ve never been, but I understand it was manufactured for someone like me. It would not be untypical of me to pack my cd’s, guitars and golf clubs to go up and never come back. I shop for clothes on other people, so it would not take long to accumulate a wardrobe. Since I have sworn off shopping off the racks, a simple backhanded compliment like, “that top would look stunning on me” brings components of a very nice drobe my way.  Reading about your misadventures makes me feel not so guilty for being a self indulgent bitch. I have been drunk since St. Patrick’s day, 1987. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not a weathered hag. In fact, when I get carded to drink or buy cigarettes, I make the wonderful people give me a hug. I had one Indian man almost call the cops on me for walking behind the counter of the 7-11 to demand some affection from him…a man who gave the almost 36 year young woman an orgasm for carding me at 6:30 in the morning after I hadn’t slept for two days. If I don’t get more than 10 hours of sleep in a week, I do sound a bit like a chainsmoking grandmother…but it’s better to look good.  Let’s get to the part where you inspired my email, before you get bored. I remembered your site and thought there must be something there to inspire a smile.  I found out Elvis died yesterday…the most beautiful brindle boxer with the most amazing muscle structure…amazingly enough on Elivis’ actual deathday. I would massage him and brush his teeth. He liked to have his hair blown dry after he snuck in the shower with me. It hurt his feelings when I would not apply lip gloss to him in the morning. I used to put sunscreen on his balls and his ears for our day trips to the beach. It actually pained me to see that dog eat off the floor (yes we shared a fork). I would spoon him and my boyfriend would spoon me. For someone who lives for the manic side of my bi-polar disorder, I am very close to the ground today. The animal is the only thing that I have even bothered to keep in touch with over the last five years of my gypsyhood. I have had seven addresses and hundreds of friends during that time. From crashing on my ex-husband’s couch for six months to the Plantations, I’ve talked about that dog to anyone who will listen. He is the only one I would consistently visit when I would go home. Now he’s gone, so I called an ex-boyfriend with whom I have a sleeping bag at this house kind of commitment to commiserate, and he was an ass. I remember why I left that town. In all fairness to him, he said I called him at 5:00am Saturday morning and left a message for Joe, who he is not. I’m not sure if I have a friend named Joe, because I call everyone Joe (dark hair) or Steve (fair hair). At any rate, I don’t remember, except to say that there might have been an incident with the police. I just remember flashing lights. My car was docked in my driveway the next day, and my windows didn’t have bars on them. To maintain the kind of momentum I have come to know in what is now my free spirit life where I have to take a xanax to be able to commit to watching a movie with the same person, I think selling the car is key for the purposes of physical freedom. It’s more of a revelation than a resolution, for now anyway.  So the folks back home are one-dimensional and concerned with machines that have a lot of moving parts. While I was perusing your site, looking onto your memories, I got IM’d from a friend down here who wants to take me out to dinner to cheer me up. It’s not like this is the only loss I have suffered. But I have not had cause to shed a tear in over two years.  It is true, when you find yourself in a new place, you can be who you are, or whomever you want. People have not known you enough to put you in a box of expectations. The trend leans more toward acceptance rather than expectants (another rule). A few weekends ago I had a small togetherness of about 20 people at my house where I live in the “don’t need a nanny anymore” space of a young 40 something divorcee’s home and her two boys. The weather was nice so we did the pool, and later the hot tub. The bouncer from my favorite all night club cooked for me because I don’t know how to bar-b-que (it wasn’t revealed until dinnertime…I don’t know what I was thinking…I was just glad I found a nice polish vodka on my way home from the night before at noon (people were coming at 2:00, in fact, there were people in my driveway to help me with the groceries) and the shaker for my favorite daydrink, white Russians…tall, dark and handsome, of course. One of my guests said that it was the most eclectic togetherness of people that he had ever seen. What a huge compliment…if you go for eclectic, the fun is sure to follow…plan the people, not the activity (another rule).  Feeling better now. If you get down here, I demand some attention.       reply:      oh hi. i think that maybe you're a little bit insane. also, you called me a self-indulgent bitch. i liked it! do it again, do it again, do it again! i am glad that you are not a weathered old hag. i more glad that you have been drunk for the past 17 years. that is quite an accomplishment, something that i can only aspire to live up to. the moral of this cute little story is that you should make your own blog in order to forwarn people of your insanity. this way, you'll probably have far less restraining orders against you in the future. thanks for the email and for reading! mezack.

      I remember Tom Petty saying that he was one of the only rock and rollers left at a Dead show with Dylan at RFK. Now the only real rock you hear is on the classic stations. Check out  urlLink www.tokesquealy.com . I've hung &amp; heard, and by some minor miracle am still alive to tell you...CHECK IT OUT!

      I went on a date with a man from the Bronx. He exclamated, "this fucking guy...that fucking guy"...total thickhead. I met him at his place on the ocean because he had to watch a few horse races before he went anywhere. He says he has a wife in Europe, but they are separated. I told him that an ocean was separation enough for me. After drinking $100 bottles of wine over pasta, he pulled out his wallet to pay. A guinea wallet emerged from his already bulging pants. I asked him where he got it, and he said that he was no guinea, but a jew. I said, "who the hell are you, meyer lansky?" He started out with his first mistake and the most important lesson he ever learned in his life which was "never get caught". I felt like I was in Goodfellas. Then he went on to say that he has made plenty of money and all his businesses are legit now. I asked what they were...wallcoverings....I bet his wife is buried with Jimmy Hoffa and the wallcoverings were in blood.  My only to chance to escape was to drink heavily and hope he couldn't hang    (another rule...from mae west:  it's not the men in your life, it's the life in your men).    I made quick work of him...vodka, bailey's and espresso (usually an "after an all nighter" drink for me, but an appropriate exit strategy. Not so eventually, he had to go home. He called me four times the next day.      Rule for the day: Never tell anyone where you live.
