Either it was the sudden, murder of a loved one, betrayl, or pure torture to them, dark angels have commited their life to Satan himself. They are silent, and their wings are dark black feathers, or blood red. Dark Angels appear when there is someone dying, or a murder. If you see one, it means the death of a loved one is expected. Dark Angels cannot actually harm a human, but they love to see the suffering of one.    urlLink   What Kind of ANGEL are you? (For Girls only) This Quiz has amazingly Beautiful Pictures!     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      You are going to Marry orlando Bloom. He will always treat you right and is very romantic. He will do anything for you. He is very polite and has deep brown eyes and is very good looking (which is another plus!). He can make anything cheesy look really hot(like sliding down stairs on a shield shooting arrows or wearing pointy ears for example). Congrats!!    urlLink   Which male celebrity are you going to marry? (now 12 (i just added more, and still more to come!)results that have pics!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      You belong in the land of darkness, otherwise known as one of the worlds in which I dwell. All here is beauty inspired by tragedy and great sorrow. Write or go through other creative outlets to express the anguish you may be feeling, and never let anyone tell you that you are just being 'weepy' or full of 'teenage angst'(if you're a teenager.If not, then they really should be punished for calling you one. They probably are trying to insult your maturity...fools.)and always remain yourself, dark and amazing. Never change.    urlLink   Where do you belong?(ANIME IMAGES)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      your fuck.    urlLink   What swear word are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      Yours are  DEMON  wings, possibly resembling those of a bat - huge, black, and clawed. You are cold and impure, and a born Creature of the Night. Possibly with an interest in those of a vampyric nature, or possibly one yourself. You have little sympathy or care for humanity and see them as existing for no real purpose -  thus, you can be very manipulative and bend them to fit YOUR purpose. And you do have a purpose, to everything you do. Nine times out of ten it will be strictly for your own self gratification or perhaps merely amusement. As soon as a person or situation is no longer productive or pleasurable in your life, you will rid yourself of it or them. You could very well have just a touch of superiority complex (or perhaps more than a touch?). Despite all of this, you are capable of love so intense that you place that person's wishes even above your own - the only time that you will do so. Chances are you are attracted to people in which you see...yourself. Though many hate you for your carelessness and evil...Sexy, fierce, sinful, and mysterious...you turn me on.     urlLink   *~*~*Claim Your Wings - Pics and Long Answers*~*~*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      Your: Wondering eyes.

      you mean the world to me and nothing less I love the feeling of your arms around me I feel so much safer like i could just let the world pass by without a care at hand.   I love the way you make me smile thats why i hate the weeks where i have to wait so long till i see you again so i may feel the smile seep across my face.   I love the way you comfort me when im down or had a rough day in a way you could say your my pot of gold at the end of this ever so long rainbow which seem'd so dark in the begining   I love how your so perfect in my eyes i would never change a thing about you and i really i hope i can make you as happy as you do for me.   I feel as if i would die without you but maybe thats just the fear of being alone?  But i know i need you i can feel it in the pit of my soul as it screams for your touch  .   I look into the mirror and watch the tears go by while i gaze at the clock every so often watching time fly and trying to remember your warmth I think thats the only thing keeping me sain while your away   I want so badly to reach for the razor but i know i mus'nt knowing nothing good will come of it..   all i can do is wait for is the pain to end and for you to return to me.

      She slides to the floor glares at the reflection in the mirror "I hate you"  is all she whisper  As the blood drys under her fingernails tears roll down her cheeks "why?" The pain is so unreal... why wont she end it now  save everyone a lot of grief but still she wades her self in this so called pain for pleasure.. she hides her scars with a smile so fake these demonic screams for help blinded by that fucking smile that smile you wish to destroy rip apart then sew back together  just so that oh so pretty smile can scream and moan that's what you've always wanted right?

      You make me feel so good  deep down inside I really wish  it was like that all the time I'm sure... you'd get sick of me though but I cant help it thinking of what the future holds for us or will we even last... last long enough to have a future? will you still be by my side holding my hand? I worry that I'll turn around and you'll be gone... forever...Out of my grasp As days go by missing your touch but still remembering the taste of your lips I linger on and on to keep that taste going...

        You're an extrovert!    urlLink   What JTHM Character are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      Your soul is bound to the  Black Rose : The Wicked.   "I am the wicked specemin of sin with no profound logic to believe in.  Hold me tight, but don't hold me close, I go where I desire."   The Black Rose is associated with manipulation, control, and virtuosity.  It is governed by the goddess Psyche and its sign is The Tapestry, or Crafted Love.  As a Black Rose, you may have a slight wicked streak running through you.  But whether you are naughty or nice is up for debate.  You know how to get what you want and can work people for what they're worth.  You have great people skills, but can sometimes be a bit of a control freak.     urlLink   What Rose Is Your Soul Bound To?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

I'm beginning to feel hallow, wanting to almost carve out my remaining insides and show them all I was never lying. I am truly nothing and no one can argue with me now. I believe I've actually forgotten how to give a true smile... I try but it burns and scorns... I want to wash away my eyes... I don't want to see this shit anymore, while your at it there are a pair of ears close by that don't want to hear your shit anymore either... I'm slowly falling apart...

Everything to prove Nothing to lose Just when everything has fallen to the ground Gonna knock it downJust believe me when I tell you it's alright. This time we're on our way to tragedy Forever bored and outside from the in crowd. I've come to grip confronting my reality. Numbstruck it's me against the world now. For all you know for all you know it's not for real Spare me the obsession that you deal.Get away get away get away. I'm about to detonate. Everything to prove Nothing to lose Just when everything has fall to the ground Gonna knock it down Just believe me when I tell you it's alright. Everything to prove Nothing to lose Just when everything has fall to the ground Gonna knock it downJust believe me when I tell you it's alright.I should've know right from the start That you'd take this trust and rip me apart.Could be a change of heart. I'll fall into you, but don't believe that this is real. I'll fall into you, but don't believe that this is real. I'll fall into you, but don't believe that this is real. I'll fall into you, but don't believe that this is real.
