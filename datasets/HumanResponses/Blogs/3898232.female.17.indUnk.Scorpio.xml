      SO apparently I am neglectful... too bad... here I go... update on me...  TODAY I taught a lesson on my horsey, and DAMN that kid rode her well! I'm kinda excited, but at the same time I hate usin my horse for this but ah well. Too freaking bad for me. AND I ponied Cheyenne off Widder, so that was fun...  I KICK myself in the ass sometimes... I found a SUPER cool horse last night at the Auction... he was a percheron/thoroughbred 4 year old totally black gelding... SUPER nice... kinda ugly head and scratched up and whatnot... sold for less than meat price.. I WANTED HIM... So I got the guy's number who bought him and I might try to buy him... I could flip him in a month for double that. We'll See. I'm seriously doubting my plan to move to Kelowna now. If I did buy that horse... I would be looking at having 3 horses here at my beacon as well as all my PAYING students... and I might be able to get a job too here that would be a good one... so I dunno, I'm kinda freaking out about it. I wanna move out and I promised Kinch that I would, but I dunno, I have no idea what to do about this... i have EVERYTHING here, really... but I won't be doing horsey stuff in the winter anyhow, so I'm almost thinking... what if I just lived with Kinch for like 4 months... if we got that kind of place. we'll seee... I have to call that boy. On the OTHER hand... A is moving to Kelowna for OUC... mmmmmm which is tempting me too. THERE's reason for another paragraph....  WHAT THE HELL?????? A is so awesome... I am definetly finding myself thinking of him fairly often, which creeps me out... I don't wanna be there again, I don't wanna set myself up again... certainly not for a while. But at the same time he is pretty damn awesome, and he was definetly saying some things to me that were both flattering and ego-stroking. He is a bloody cowboy for god's sake... how can I go wrong there??? well I'll tell ya.... I'm kinda scared that when we finally meet, he's going to be disappointed... eew. that would suck. But at least with him either way no matter what happens I'll have at least made a friend out of him, which will be awesome to have in Kelowna.  So I have become a fucking mother... haha to a bloody mouse. I refuse to name it... until it opens it's eyes... once it's come that far, I'll trust myself enough to name it, as by then it hopefully won't die. I dare say it's doing fairly well right now. I rescued it from my laundry room floor, which was bizarre... it had a sibling, but that sibling suicided. Jumped out of the nest, bailed from my desk, hit the floor, and hauled itself over to my bedside to die. Thanks. That's a lovely thing to wake up to. MMMmmmmm.  RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH........ I have no idea what to do... I'm so torn over this whole moving out thing... I need to sit down and FIGURE STUFF OUT. Suggestion??? I have no idea what I'm doing anymore.  On the bright side, tonight everyone is invited to my house for some fun!!! whatever, party, hang out, movies, hot tub, whatever ya wanna do. Hopefully some of you will actually come. Cya.

      Today was officially the stupidest day ever. I have never been so bored. I'm so bored, I have nothing to write about. And EVERYONE is at bloody work! What the hell is that??? grr. So I think I'm up for a brief rant, because when you're bored... there is absolutly nothing to even rant about. GROSS. aaaaaaaaaaaaand we're done.

       This lesson I learned last night: don't be the first to pass out at a party. I had the pleasure of awakening to a fucking permanent marker scribbling across my forehead and an eerie voice ringing in my face "Having a good sleep, melissa??" Of course, after realization of what was happening set in, I panicked and moved to a "WHAT THE FUCK??" mode.... with much cursing and profanity expressed in the direction of my attacker. As much as I love graffiti across anyone's face... my newfound unibrow was a little bit unattractive, I thought. You all know about my tattoo now... well I woke up with an even better one. A big red penis. Right across my shoulders. Thanks. I always wanted a penis on my back...   Ah well. It was still fun, even if it was a roller coaster type night. It sucked though, because it's no fun to be drunk and to NOT have fun while you're at it. Last night I was drunk as a skunk, but nobody was having a really good time so the only euphoria I got to indulge in was the complete disgust with myself and anger that I could not walk a straight line. It was funny in hindsight, but I remember getting really really irritated that I couldn't walk or see as properly as I knew I should. So I decided that I no longer like drinking unless I'm absolutly certain that the party is in complete good spirits.&nbsp; It wasn't all bad though, we definetly did have some fun. Apparently you CAN indeed hang upside down from a tree when fully intoxicated. I retract... you are correct lee, you are god. And did we REALLY need THAT many LEMONS??? We're making LEMONADE!  So that's about it for now... I dunno why but I am in the most horrible irritated mood... I need something to entertain me haha. So I think I'll go search for that entertainment. Talk to ya'll soon.   Oh wait... One more little juicy. So I've been talking to A lots.... definetly am finding myself waiting around on msn for him to sign in, etc etc... shit, I don't think I want this route again just yet, but I dunno... kinda thinking that I'm developing some feelings for him. Now all I have to do is fucking wait until September haha no fun there.

      WELL today I played the part of office girl... I tried. I tried Really hard... but I suck at office work haha. Oh well, it was kinda fun. and I didn't suck THAT bad. But now I'm tired and looking forward to TONIGHT baby!!!! Woo-Hoo!!! Yay for Meghan Lee, my hero.   So I don't have much to say today, just that I've been neglecting my blog... And to gloat a little. I made Nationals again! YAY!&nbsp;Also, I've been asked to Examine for a few clubs, so that's kinda fun... I make $75 a day and I don't have to pay for transportation, food, or lodging! whee! It's cheaper than living at home haha. &nbsp;  So here's my minute rant of the day. I'm trying to find a house and such to live in next year... Kinch, where the hell are ya?? haha we need to figure this one out. It's getting a little too close to crunch time for my liking.   Here's a weird happening... I was walking home last night at around 12:30... when this HUGE truck drives by and slows right down behind me... then passes me... and the 2 guys inside lean out and just look at me... they didn't say anything, just looked... and then drove away. I was just thinking... what the hell?? and you're not even going to give me a ride??? damn you all. haha. I was insulted.   Okay, enough... I am officially the most boring blogger in existance... blah... oh well. I promise I'll have an exciting story for tomorrow haha.

      So I had an adventure yesterday. I GOT A TATTOO haha.... I'm a big fucking wuss, so I am very proud of myself. It's a horse jumping down over these line things... I love it haha. right b/w my shoulder&nbsp;blades. I am so happy with it. I dunno... corny, yes, but it's the kind of thing that means something to me and symbolizes stuff in my life. I'm so glad I got it.   So I'm doing pretty good these days... haha funny how nobody cares when a blog is happy and normal, DAMMIT! Bring back the RANT! OOOOOOOOOOH my god... I definetly just pissed my pants... what the hell?? there are scary noises outside my house... um... i'm terrified... i think I'm going to go investigate.... please don't kill me... or rape me... or take my peanuts....

      Well today was a good day. Oh yes it was. What the hell??? why is my font suddenly different?? ah well, I'm over it now.  &nbsp; SO yesterday, Becky failed her mission of finding me a hot guy. haha good try though. Some things are impossible, my friends. However, a new record has been set as to how many timbits can fit into a person's mouth at once. We hit NINE. That's right. NINE. There are photos to prove it.  &nbsp; Today I went shopping with Ash, it was great! I had a personal advisor to everything!! I blew WAY too much money... but it was fun. I can see why people find shopping therapeudic haha. gross. BUT... I bought a new bikini. That's right. Never thought you'd see the day, right?? THINK AGAIN! And here's the best part... it's PURPLE. I bought a purple bikini. It may be horribly wrong (sometimes I feel like it's kind of offensive to people for me to be wearing a bikini... call me insecure, whatever, it just doesn't feel right.) but I definetly did it. haha so that was my adventure for the day. &nbsp; Dilemma of the day: Where am I going to put my tatoo??? I'm definetly getting it next week. I don't have a clue. I want it easily concealed and easily displayed. Hmmm... suggestion? No, definetly NOT my ass thanks guys. I appreciate that. yes. I do. piss off. haha  &nbsp; Another happy note! I brough Cheyenne home finally! I got him home and he was such a good boy, I'm totally excited about him. Gonna try and start saddle breaking next week. YEEEHAW! Anyways, I'm out. Tomorrow is an early morn. Cyaz all lata.

      I officially hate my job... I decided that. Not hate with a passion... just hate... there is the occaisional perk. Like coffee breaks. And the creepy guy who hits on everyone... and the whores telling me about thier escapades. Oh there are perks. Think GREASY SLEAZY stereotypical FACTORY people... I am like the frightened little blond girl with pink nail polish that weeps after the first 2 hours and cries all the way home in despair, wondering how the hell she got there. I feel extremely naive right now. It's gross. So what I'm saying is, time to job search again, methinks... I hate to say it, its very pompous... but I am pretty sure I am above this... at least, I refuse to work there 5 days a week that's for sure.. I MIGHT handle 3 but we'll see... DAMN I want a paycheck... it could change my mind a little I think. ew.   SOOOOOOOO I am so totally busy and I hate it. I have a lesson to possibly teach tonight, which would be ok... but I NEED to work that colt, damn I wanted to ride him this weekend, but we'll see... I need someone to just sit on my horse and follow along while i lead cheyenne.. Widdy is a good babysitter. ANYWAYS... I need some time man.   I talked to G yesterday!! Made me very happy... only a little bit awkward... It was really nice to be able to have a good chat with a FRIEND... and that's what it was. So I'm happy... that's definetly close to being put behind me... I don't think I could see him yet, but I dunno... I would be scared. I am just glad I was able to fight the soap opera at least a little. I know. I'm no fun. haha. too bad.   So I think that's it for now, but I'll be back again... who knows? I could even come up with something interesting to say.  HEY WAIT... I didn't explain the MUSHROOM thing.... After I was "answering" Corine's question about my work schedual, she kindly summed it up in "So you're a mushroom. They keep you in the dark and feed you shit." I liked that way of putting it. Basically that's it. BYE.

      Hello again!  Well yesterday was a non exciting day... but hooray for friends to bust me out of monotony. So I definetly just sat around most of the day, but then I went to the beach... good fun there. I had an interesting proposition to move to Kelowna... I am very serious about taking that one up. Something to get me out since my parents are going to charge me rent anyhow. I refuse to pay rent to get told to be home at a certain time or clean my room! Went to Amanda's last night and had a good talk with her and Claire... I'm feeling not too bad, like sorry folks, but no serious rants today. However the day is young and this could change rapidly as I battle my stupid emotions. I don't know why but I continue to have severe ups and downs... I feel like a freaking PMSer ALL THE TIME haha. Dammit.   SO I decided one thing at least... I am not going to sit here and dwell on what to do about G... I know I miss him, but I also know I certainly don't want him back. I think I can be more mature than this. I'm going to talk to him about some stuff, just because he IS still one of my best friends, as we were before, and dammit I don't want to lose that so why the hell am I just trying to ignore everything? Whether or not he wants to talk about it is something in itself, but I'm going to try. I have no idea how to handle this. BLAH.

      YAWN.... just got up a little while ago. I have no idea what today brings. My lesson went well last night, and Cheyenne was a VERY good boy, so I actually didn't make it home with him, that is what today's goal will be. I love his personality, he is so smart and curious and eager. And good looking. And tall. And a gentleman, really. Hmmmmmm... I wish he was a human. HAHA okay enough of that. I am hoping to start backing him again and doing some riding within the week, but we'll see. Time and Patience will reap more benefits.   TODAY I want to go do something fun... I have no idea what, but something fun. As long as I am keeping myself busy, I'm pretty much good to go. Downtime doesn't treat me so well. It was almost strange last night to not be at Braleigh's haha. And to not have alcohol! my god that sounded bad. haha. too bad.   SO I went to Cozy Bay for dinner last night with Darcy... fun fun there. I had to go see my second moms. They used to be my bosses, I worked there for 2 years and they are wonderful people. The food is AWESOME. I of course told them the newest update in my life which is of course the breakup drama. It's so strange... everyone expected this to happen a lot sooner. Both my mummies were like, "Good. Good, that was the best thing you could do. This is not a surprise at all." Apparently all this time they didn't really approve of G all that much anyhow. Bizarre finding all this out NOW. But it does make me feel better. They are certainly not the only ones to react this way either.   I think I'm going to leave it at that for today. I'm going to go watch a lesson my friend is getting from our instructor...i need to talk to her anyhow. HOORAY two more checks for me from the pony club b/c I am teaching 2 more students... so this summer I'll have made some good money from teaching. Next year my rates go up dammit. Haha. Ok well I'm signing out then.

      Ok so apparently I'm unstable (oh yes. That's right. "Stable" environment was a complete parody.) I hate mood swings...   SO I rode my horsey... beautiful ride, I have NO idea how I will survive if I leave here... wildflowers everywhere, totally silent in the hills, Widder was feeling really good and we had some EXTREMELY good gallops (SO purifying) but alas I cannot ride forever. I don't think she's improved since the injections... WTF???   So I am basically REALLY nearing the end of my hypothetical chain. I hate feeling stressed and being unable to remove it. Now that I am feeling COMPLETELY sober... arg. I am becoming bothered. I read Claire's blog... HOLY SHIT CLAIRE!! I can tell you that my feelings regarding the whole relationship destruction thing seem to mirror yours exactly... i was almost creeped out by reading yours and feeling identical. Crazy. SO basically my mind is running in circles. HOWEVER... THANKS B and L for making me dinner last night, I didn't properly thank you! It was appreciated to extreme degrees! I ALSO owe thanks to Ben... for friday night... you are very good at making me feel better... (AHEM... HE knows what he's being thanked for... for those of you who may misinterpret with minds of filth, COMPLETELY NON-SEXUAL!)  SO anyhow... I came across a good song that comes damn close to what I was thinking... here's the words actually for A Beautiful Mistake by The Ataris...  Maybe I'm not ready for this, and you know it. Maybe I'm too scared to tell you what I'm really thinking It's not fair to stay together because of regrets we might have. I don't want to fall asleep alone, but do I want to wake up with you? I'm only trying to be completely honest.  So I guess this is the ending or a beautiful mistake. And if we both agree that we shouldn't be together why does it hurt so much? I feel like I lost my closest friend. I don't want to fall asleep alone, but do I want to wake up with you? I hope you're happy and completely lonely.  There I am standing all alone on Sydney Harbor Bridge. And you know I would jump into the fucking ocean if it meant I was truly capable of being satisfied. Well I ever be? Did I just give up the best thing I ever had?  I don't want to fall asleep alone, but do I want to wake up with you? I hope you're happy and completely lonely. I don't want to fall asleep alone, but do I want to wake up with you? I'm only trying to be completely honest.  BLAH.... cya tomorrow..... I think this blog thing could become addictive.

      So this is a blog... boredom makes people do crazy things. Well how was that for an intro? THIS IS ME! Apparently these are fairly therapeutic... well I myself will try to avoid completely ventilating each shitty factor of my life here... interspersal with happiness is key! haha ok well let it start then...  SOOOOOOO..... yesterday I definetly had a lovely time at Bralex's party... tried some new things, found out that there is some truth to drowning sorrows but unfortunatly it lasts for a limited time only. Damn. Unfortunatly, this is bad timing... I just broke it off with my boyfriend of 7 months... pretty large hurt. I knew it needed to be done, and I had put it off for a while b/c I couldn't bring myself to talk to him about it. haha well he's probably relieved I did anyhow, b/c he certainly was feeling the same way if not moreso. So I'm working on getting over that one... I've kinda thought about it lots though... he never loved me (he'll be the first to admit it... in fact he did) and I always knew that... so It's not as bad as I thought it was going to be. I've had a bit of time to get used to the idea I guess. Doesn't make life easier though.   I'm not going to go on forever, I promise... I think Today I'm gonna bring home my little project horse, Cheyenne. He belongs to a very good friend of mine, but I'm training and selling him. He'll be a fun addition, if he doesn't break my spine. Here's a warning... I'm probably going to talk A LOT about horses. My passion... and Dammit, I can LIST FOR MILES why I like them so much... another day. Anyways, Cheyenne is a 5 yr old Morgan/Saddlebred/QH/Paint colt... very cute, super flashy, and very naughty due to lack of training over the past few years. So we'll see if I can actually handle this. Could be ugly.   Today I'm going to finally ride Widder... my first love, and the single soul in the world that I can count solely and completely upon to make me smile somehow. Cheesy, yes, but true. You'd have to have the same bond as I do to understand it. She's been battleing lameness for a while, so we're trying cortizone injections in the hock... today is day 1 of riding to see if it's working. Anyhow, I'll leave it at that for today... unless I feel like it later. Thanks.   *Wisdom of the day: If you see new, wet asphalt or cement... DEFINETLY step in it (especially when on horseback) BUT... lightly be thy feet.
