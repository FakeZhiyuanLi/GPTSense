      Well i didn't blog yesterday for several meanings, the main reason being that I didn't much feel like it, moving on im fucking sick of these damn pop ups my pc keeps getting. Anyways I had a good day yesterday, although the friends that were supposed to didn't and charlotte left me to go out. Moving on, Its nearly time to be back at college which I aint at all looking forward to :(, cause soon it's uni and I will have to get a job soon which means my online time will be like dramitcaly cut :(. I have a concert soon though so it isn't really that bad, although of-course concert means practice so that means doing something then just sitting infront of the keyboard of course.    No Doubt : Don't speak

      Hi all, welcome to where I will be posting my life for the forceable future. Hmmmm.... 9:43, or if im running on oz time then 3:43 although I have so far failed to change my body-clock to Oz time. Anyways I made this so I could complain to somebody else instead of anyone who would listen to me, because technicaly if you read this then you have actually agreed to listen to me moan on and on. Well I still have a bit of a splitting head-ache because I got really pissed last night and unfortunatly I woke up, ooh look there I go xD. Well that's all I can think of for the moment although I'm sure nobody will read this it makes me feel better to write about this.  ---  Evening  Well not a bad day all in all, I bought two Cd's today and enjoyed both of them, I have nothing really to talk about since nothing has happened, oh I wrote the second song for my musical although its pretty shit and really short because I couldn't much be bothered, I will probably edit it half way through but you know... I'm just sorta like that. Well I think I will get coffee soon because im extremly thirsty + tired but I want to talk with Ronni (he's good conversation) so I need some sort of energy to bash these keys as long as possible. Nat and John went a while ago and left me alone with only the wir of my fan and my daft scary room mate playing her guitar (say hi to the nice people charlotte) 'Grrrrr', she isnt much of a talker. Oh well must dash, people to talk too things to sort out erm.... ooh letters to write (must find a shop that sells air-mail stickies for ron's package), and no one take that sickly or I will cut your heads off with a meat cleaver!
