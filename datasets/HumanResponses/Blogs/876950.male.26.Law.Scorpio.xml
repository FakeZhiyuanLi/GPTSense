						   I read this book for the June meeting of my Books into Film Book Club, which meets at the Newport News Barnes & Noble.  I enjoyed the book  much  more than the movie. And while the book made Savannah out to be a totally unique place, I think this is probably overstated by the author. While I have only passed through the outskirts of Savannah, the types of people Berendt describes in the book thrive all over the place--not just Savannah.  But it was a great read, and far surpassed the movie. If you haven't watched the movie, but want to get the most out of it, you need to watch the movie  prior  to reading the book.

						   Here, I'm going to write about books and other material that I read.   I'm trying to do more reading, and now that I'm well on the road to recovery from law school (after being out a year!), I think I'm in better shape to do "fun" reading after all that mandatory reading.

						   This book, another by Michael Crichton, is a great story. It reads easily, has a great plot, and the characters are easy to imagine in the mind's eye. Of course, this is probably because it has been made into a movie.  The book, while enjoyable, made me feel--at least once--that Crichton was writing the book with a movie in mind. While I can't remember the exact spot, there was one passage where two alternate events could have taken place, and the one that Crichton went with was the one that would definitely have been easier to film. That was when it occurred to me that Crichton might be churning out these books to make movies. I don't know whether this is the case, but that was my impression.  Overall, though, it's a great book. If you have some time to read a neat sci-fi tome, pick it up.

						   Around mid-May I started reading  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone . I found the book fascinating, and I soon consumed  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets , then  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban . I read  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  in one weekend, and  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  over a period of 9 days (that's about 97 pages a day!).   I have never read at such a pace. That is attributable, I believe, to the fact that I have rarely, if ever, read such well-written and interesting books.  Book 1 was a good introduction to the series, while book 2 was, in my opinion, so-so. From what I have read recently, however, the forthcoming book,  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince , will tie in with  Chamber of Secrets .  The third book was where, I believe, the overall plot of the series really began to take shape. The fourth book kicks it into higher gear, and the fifth book gets hot and heavy.  It was a great series. The movies based on the first two movies are OK, but--in my opinion--the third movie was a disaster. It left out important details that round out the characters.  I eagerly await book 6.
