      hi there,  Okay.. let's get started. It's 6 in da mornin' -- no i'm not an early bird. It's just that i've not been sleeping. well.. it's kinda sort of jet lag. I sleep early (in da mornin') n wake up late (yeah, i mean late), might as well be vamps. i broke up with WL yesterday. reason i wanted to end our relationship: 1. I don't even know his birthday. ( he just won't tell.. that's all) 2. It's sort of cyber kinda relationship ( i've tons of unsuccessful cyber relationsip) 3. I don't think i REALLY luv him. ( no offense) 4. I'm still too young ( at least i think so.. n my mom says so) 5. I've got my study to consider ( my grade's sux) 6. He's not rich ( not that i really care.. but at least.. Handphone is a "must-have" kinda stuff) 7. He might be handsome but what does matter is whether is he tall. ( coz i am. well, not REALLY) 8. It's just a stupid game that might hurt me ( might as well i hurt him -- oh.. how wicked.) 9. Well, he's just not my type ( wonder wad's my type of guy)  Actually, there's a more serious stuff to consider rather than think 'bout him. for example, my mom's gonna be here this evening 'n my room sux. It's damn messy, i dun even know if i can tidy it up at least. i should have it tidy actually by now. Now, let's move on...  Talking 'bout my grade that sux. it does improve actually, BUT sadly i still FAIL. 'n talkin' 'bout sch, i've got tonnes of HW that i hav not   touch  . yesterday -- or issit the day b4, i visit asknlearn 'n discovered more homework. I think they (the teachers) r killin' us. - u know kinda burried us alive, with homework.  actually i've got lots to say. just not sure where to get started. well, i guess it's enough for today. thx for WHATEVER. :P  xoxoxo

      so.. that's it. i woke up 2 o'clock in the afternoon after sleeping for 6 hours. i sat infront of the computer chatting for 'bout n hr, then had my lunch. now it's time for me to take a shower... or else i'll be late. mom's arriving 'bout 5+. so i better get ready.oh..another problem is.. i've not clean up the mess in my room. i'm done for >.  oh yeah, today's my cousin's, Melissa, b'day. i bought her a neckless yesterday. it's SGD25.00,- is it expensive or what? well, guess wad, every year i bought her something from bugis junction. hahaha.. i don't think she's gonna be there though. she's a rich girl, probably shop at Orchard.  back to my computer stuff. i've not been lookin' for the external hdd. if they (those DJs) found out. i'm a history (relax, they're not that cruel). actually i've spend my money on novels again - 5 novel read in a week. that's stupid.  okay, i gotta go NOW. *puff*

      Wow! must have been a long time since the last blog, i guess. well, let me count -- might be a month. therefore, this one will be a long one.  Story begins...  so... the second day back home, we had gathering for sut1 crew and users in warung ubud. yeah.. same old place! quite nice though. there, i met quite lots of guys i dun remember knowing. lots of old friends too.. brothers, ex-es. you know who i'm talking about. after dismissal, we went to sun plaza. i aaid, that place is not bad.. might be excellence.. too bad it's still kinda empty. imagine.. big spacious, but empty.. scary rite ?  most of the time.. might say all of the time i'm just hanging around next door or downstairs helping up.. or u might just say messing up. i never did all my homework, just very few of it. days were boring.  back here, it's not boring. it's tiresome. homework can't be done. it's just too much. now that i had my english lesson from british council and piano lesson every wednesday and thursday... i'm soooooooooo damn tired.  good thing monday is a holiday! i'm not planning to skip school though! oh yeah, i watch spiderman 2 yesterday. everytime i watch spiderman the movie i heard lots of inspirational speech. i love that. keep it up spidey. waiting for the 3rd. i heard it's gonna be in 2007.  just a few movie i plan to watch : mean girls, around the world in 80 days, windstruck, king author. that's all i think. hope i have enough $$.  c'ya till the next.  Yours, AngeLa
