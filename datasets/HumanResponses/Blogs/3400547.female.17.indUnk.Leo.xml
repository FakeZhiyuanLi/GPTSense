      Well the last letter I wrote about was...Nothing. Who cares if he called Tim I don't. I told him the truth about everything, so I know that he believes me and that is all that matters talked and we are fine, we will all ways be fine. I know that he still loves me it just takes a while. I am more an willing to wait. Someone told me if it is meant to be than it will work out in the end. I know it will. Everything in life happens for a reason. you know sometimes I wonder why I dwell on the dumn things, from now on I am not going to do it anymore. From here on out if it is something to dwell on then I will but if it is this dumn thing than I am not going to, it is just a waste of time. Well with that I promise myself not to dwell on the dumn things.  I LOVE MYSELF *zia

      Before I write anything I want to say thank you to my a woman that I look up to. But look down at cause she is smaller. J/k I love you. Today was the best. I went to school and finally finished my pearl harbor report. But after that I did work for shawna until lunch. I hung out at lunch with the larsons and that was fun. Then Kyle came and I asked him to take me to in-n-out after his class. While he was in class our school got evacuated because there was a gas leak. After everyone was out we singed out and went home. Well the larsons, Ashley and I went to Isaacs house. That was so much fun. Well Isaac and ed played madden the football game, and ed almost won, but Isaac came back with 43 sec left. After that the larsons left and then Isaac and I hung out in the chair.  Out of my hole week today was the funest. I could not ask for any better. We just sat in the chair and talked about the future and the past. How we just love to be around each other and nothing in the world could bother us. He just looked so happy and I know I was. then carlos came over and he wanted to play basketball, so they played for a while and I had to leave but before I left he gave me a kiss and it was so perfect. Ashley saw and said AAA how cute. That is so Ashley you got to love her. After I left Isaacs house I went to a friends baseball game with my parents. My friends team won.  Well now I am home and I can not get a smile off my face, but that is not a bad thing at all. Well I am going to go because Isaac I calling me right now on the phone.  I LOVE MYSELF *zia

      Well today was my first day writing in here. I had never heard of it until my advisor (more like my MOM) shawna told me about it. We were talking about getting me a journal but I did not want anyone to find it so she told me about this. I am really happy for that because it helps me express myself in a different way. Compared to what I used to do. I do not know what it does to me but when I type I feel like I can say anything and do nothing wrong. I am a very special person, I have people who care deeply for me. You know when you feel like everything in life is not right and you want the easy way out. I was thinking about that tonight, I have it good I have a roof over my head I have food on the table I have a family who cares deeply for me I have friends that also care deeply for me. ya I got hurt but I am just gong to learn from it and be stronger from it. Just like what happened before x-mas I hurt the guy that loved me the most in life. He was my best friend and then on top of that he was my boyfriend. I hurt him so bad. We were not friends anymore it hurt so bad but I just think I hurt him 10 times worse. But now we are back to being best friends and I could not ask for any better. ya in the other letter I wrote I was talking about how I lost a best friend well yes I did but not really I have better friend she is sweet and she cares about me. But deep down inside I am scared that in the long run like with Deanna I will end up hurt again. I guess I am just going to have to take that risk. I was thinking about what some one said at school today they said that some times all the love in the world is still not enough, she is so right. I know that people love me and I love them but sometimes I feel like it is not enough. I am 16 years old and I have gone through a lot from... My parents getting a divorce to cutting myself to starving myself to even being raped....I think that I can  this I know that life is hard but it is just hard right now. My parents are better that are happy and I do not worry about that anymore. I do not hurt myself anymore and I have my eating disorder under control. I just need to wake up every morning and tell myself that I am loving and everything happens for a reason. Well I am so tired and I have to be up early so I will write later.  I LOVE MYSELF  *zia

      Today has been ok, but I am not feeling that great. Honestly I feel like SHIT. I have lost my best friend (Deanna) I have never felt such a hole in my heart. Everyone told me that she was not that great of a friend and I told them no you guys don't know her, like I do. But I guess I was wrong. She has had this boyfriend for the last six moths and I know that when people get boyfriends they grow apart but they stay friends. Well when it came to it she choose him over me and that is not a true friend at all. I know that now everyone was right and yes I should have listened to everyone but if I do that then I end up still getting hurt. So really if you look at it get hurt any way. I am tired of getting hurt. I am this sweet little girl (woman)who thinks that there is good in everyone and I end up getting hurt and I do not like any of it. Sometimes I feel like I want to become this huge BICTH, but that is not me at all. Everyone knows me as the sweet little girl, that would never hurt  a fly. And that is true. Maybe I should not come to school anymore because then I will be at home and nothing can hurt me there. Well yes my parents can but not really I just want to go back to my old way but I made promise my SHAWNA and my MOM. And those two people care about me so much and I do not want to cause them any pain. It is enough that I am in pain all the time but to  put the ones I care about the most will hurt the most if I am gone. Then again they are profile the only ones that care about me. Yes I know that people care about me but sometimes I feel like it is not enough. Well I have people around me so am going to stop writing now. Because I do not want to write anymore because I am going to start crying.  I LOVE MYSELF *zia

      Right now I am at school getting ready for color war and it is going to be so much fun. I cant wait until it happens. The only thing that is going wrong right now is that Isaac is leaving me to move down the hill. I am not only losing the person I am in love with  I am losing my best friend. I don't know what I am going to do.  I just hope that he misses me as much as I am going to miss him. I know that he knows that I love him, but sometimes I know that he douts it. But it is ok because I know my feelings and they are not going to stop, even if we don't get back together. Because your true love does not go away over night. I that because we have not been together for about 5 or 6 months and my feelings still have gone away, and I don't think that they will ever go away. I hope not. People ask me where I see myself in 10 years and I tell them starting a family and they ask if I can see my husband and I say yes and the scary thing is that my husband is Isaac.  Well I need to get going.  I LOVE MYSELF *CIA

      I have not written in along time, but yesterday was so much fun. I got to see him  walk across the stage and see that smile on his face. I know that he is going to miss it but he is going to enjoy collage more. Going to the party's and just going toward his future. Last night he invited me to go to dinner with him and his family but I was unable and  when I talked to him today he said that he was miserable because he wanted to spend graduation night with me. He said all he did after they ate they went to joshes party to wish him luck then they left and went home. Him carols and j just played madden all night.  tonight he wants to go to Nichols and go to her party. He said that he wants me to go with him and I am unable to go he said that he does not want to go. I jut hope that I can go. Then if I cant go than if he was not he can just come over here or whatever. I cant wait until his party it is going to be so much fun....   well about me now. Life is good I but I made a mistake the day before graduation..... When I got home there was a call form 24 hour fitness. That day I had a opptiment with carry. Well when I called shaun answered the phone and I asked him if carry was there and if he had called. He said that carry had not been in all day and that he was going to come in. Then I asked him if anyone else called he said no. Well then after that he kept asking me questions and by the time we got off the phone a hour an hour had gone by. Well later when Jose went in to work out shaun told him hey guess who I talked to.... Jose said I don't know shaun said someone who should hate me for the rest of my life. Jose said zia. shaun said ya. Well that same night Jose saw Isaac and told him that I had talked to him for a hour and how we were going to get back together or some bull shit like that. Well then Isaac got all mad at me and now we are fine. Well the day of graduation he called and I told him that I am not willing to throw everything away with Isaac and that I could never talk to him again. Well then after that everything was all good until he showed up at school. So when I saw him I called Isaac and told him that he was there and that I am going to be with J until he leaves, so he would not get mad at me again.  well now everything is all good and I could not be more happy  I LOVE MYSELF *zia

      Yesterday was the worst day of my life (I THOUGHT). Yesterday I had to tell my parents that 2 years ago when I was a freshman in high school I was rapped on May 26. I was so angery with shawna and patty for making me tell, but I now understand why they said what they said yesterday thank you. When I was sitting in peters office I was so upset I was so scared, because I had kept such a big secrete from them for 2 years. When my mom came in the room she looked so worried. She thought that it was every moms nightmare that her 16 was pageant. I told her no mom 2 years ago I was rapped she did was look at me and why did you not tell me for 2 years I thought we had a good relationship. After all that she told me that he love had not change and it will never. Well today at 10:00 am I am going to glendora police office and filing a rapped report. I don't know where I am going to go from there, but I have to take little steps with the ones who care for me the most. Now that it is off my chest I feel like I am free. I feel that I can talk about it with people, and now know that they are not going to be disappointed in me, that they are going to want to help me. Last night I went to bible study. At first I was just doing it to get out of my house so my mom could tell my dad the news. But when I got there everyone was so nice and pleasant. After playing around we prayed and ate dinner. After dinner we played some more and then shawna and I were sitting that and she asked if someone could pray for me. So I said yes. We talked to this amazing guy named Edger. He remained me of my old youth leader, my old youth leader and I  were so close but I never told him that I was rapped the way edger was last night I know that he is a good man and I am looking forward to getting to know him more. So after we talked he prayed for me my family and everyone that I going to go through it with me. Well I need to get ready to go down the hill so I will see you in ASB. I love you and thank you for being there for me even when I did not want it. Thank you again and again, patty too.  I LOVE MYSELF *Zia
