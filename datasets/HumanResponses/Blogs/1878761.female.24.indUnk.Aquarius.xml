      i've been saying for the past months that it's time to change my life. do something worthwhile and finish whatever I've started. in june, i started doing that but somewhere in the middle of july i started veering off... doing nothing....hehehehe! i've been looking forward to starting studying again but in the middle of the semester i find myself dumping my materials in one corner of the room. man, those romance novels are certainly addicting! now i'm sitting  here and surfing through useless sites instead of studying for my finals next week.

      I have forgotten that i have this blog. Just saw my roommate updating hers so I thought of dropping by and writing a few lines. nothing like good, old-fashioned procrastination to avoid all those mundane chores.  I'll never go beyond using blog templates to improve this but hey nobody else views this anyway. Just an outlet for my writer-wannabe moments.   Last time I wrote here I was moving to a new program. Since then, I've moved again. Hay, changes.  That's it. We'll see if I can post something here within this year. hehehe.

      I just read another blog dedicated to love and heartbreak. Man, I'm never going to write mushy stuff like that here. I really can't see myself as deeply involved as that. I find it too weird and somehow vulnerable if I do that. Not just write mushy stuff and post it in the net but also the giving of oneself to another person. Maybe that's why I can't have a relationship like that...  i know i'm rambling but really!  I get crazy sometimes and do stupid stuff but never as stupid as falling in love. I have a lot of things to do and a lot of ideas to explore.

      I finally worked up enough courage to call up the registrar's office. Yey! They still can accept late enrollees. All I need to do is fax a letter signifying my intent to enroll. I just hope that they still accept me despite my awful academic record.   Funny thing happened to me the last time I wrote here. I said that I wanted to talk to somebody that time and it seemed impossible because it was early in the morning. Right after logging off from the computer, my friend texted me. I called her up and we ended up talking for over an hour.   I'm neglecting my honest-to-goodness diary because of this blog. Have to keep this short and sweet.

      I'm totally bored.  This is what happens when people get too focused on work to the point that there's nothing else happening in their life. Yup, I'm on my second day off for the week. My roomies are all asleep, dreaming happy dreams and snoring loudly to boot. And here I am, with my screwed body clock, organizing all the junk I accumulated throughout the years. Pathetic.  It would be nice if I can actually talk to somebody now.  But it looks like it's never going to happen at 2am here.  So what else is new? Just checked out my friends over at the ever popular and still bug-ridden Friendster. It is nice though getting to read all about your friends and finding out what's the latest in their life. Okay, more like snooping. But hey they posted it so don't blame me if I know that they just recently broken up with their significant other or that s/he got a new job. And one of my missing agents winds up in a different company. The nerve!  Hay, the wonders of technology.

      I feel pretty good today.  It must be the fact that I actually slept more than five hours. Night shift work is pretty bad but I shoul be used to this now because I've been working this way for the past three years. I can't believe that I actually lasted this long! And that I am considering staying! This is aligned, I guess, to the crazy, crazy idea of getting rich.   I'm thinking of putting up my own business. And I can't get it out of my mind. I'm just scared though that this is just a passing thing, much like my desire to get a MA degree. But hey, if I hesitate then I might regret it in the end.. hmmmmm...

      too much surfing has wrought its havoc.. my index finger and wrist are hurting.. had to put foul smelling stuff on it to make the pain go away.. maybe I shouldn't be doing this right now but I just couldn't resist.  My landlady's been ranting all morning. When I woke up at 6am, she was lecturing her granddaughter about money and the sacrifices she made for her, yaddah, yadah.. You get the picture..And she's still at it now though I think she's ranting over the phone..amazing stamina and vocal prowess...  it's raining and I'm way too lazy to get out of the house and buy food...

      I already broke my laptop. There's this single pixel that's glowing green in the middle of my screen. It's not too bad when I'm viewing pages or documents with light colored backgrounds. But the dark colors! Argh! Goodbye DVDs! I don't know what I did wrong!!!!

      I'm currently writing this using my very own laptop!!!!  My brother bought me an emachines laptop with a 15.4 screen... hehehehe.. my persuasive powers really worked! It's that or the fact that I bugged him to buy me one for over a year... I prefer to think the former.  I'm all set for my distance education course. That is if my course materials arrive on Thursday.  Will keep this blog posted on how it's going with my laptop.

      Somebody called me at 5 this morning. Luckily I was in the other room and wasn't able to answer it. Might have been the office. I'm sick of having my days off always being interrupted by work.  I'm listening right now to the Corrs' Dublin live album. i love this song! Though I don't know what the title is since its MM's cd. I think it's "Summer Wine" or something. It's a duet with a really, really good male singer. His voice is simply marvelous especially when he does his solo in the chorus. i'm going to replay the song and just let go...

      I'm so bad at managing my finances. It's payday today and half of the money is gone! And I just realized that I'm supposed to pay for my tuition BEFORE the next payday! Argh, I don't want to look at my bills!!  As usual, I'm just keeping myself occupied with trivial stuff. hay.

       I'm pissed off. I just got off talking to the man who was supposed to help me get my passport. I applied through a travel agency thinking that it will save me from the heat and the hassle of lining up in the DFA. One week and a half has gone by and this person never called me! I had to follow up with their main office and get pissed off at a lot of people. I even texted him twice and he didn't even have the decency to reply. He only did after I called his office the second time to follow up. When I finally got to talk to him, he got the nerve to say that he'll check if he can do it next week because he has other appointments. All this crap and I paid extra for overtime!!!!!    &nbsp;  Arrggggghhh.. I seem to attract this unbelievable bad luck when it comes to customer service! I just hope I can keep my temper when I go in and get my papers AND my money from their office on Monday.    &nbsp;  From now, I'll totally rely on my own. Even if I'm half-dead, waiting in line in for hours. ARGGGGGHHHH!!! I'm just so furious about the lost time!

       Just checked on my finances and the internet is great!   I got to check my insurance and mutual funds stuff online.    &nbsp;  I'm also trying to make my life more meaningful by volunteering online.   UN has this online volunteering website that matches a person up with interests or causes.It's on  urlLink http://www.onlinevolunteering.org . I hope I get accepted by one of the organizations there. I volunteered for the distance education cause of one of the organizations. It seems to be the only one suited for my skills.     &nbsp;  What else is new?   Oh yeah, I'm being considered for trainer position specifically for a client.   It looks like my assessment is still up in the air so I might as well as consider this one.   I'm pretty pissed at how my assessment went! Grrrrrrrrrr...    &nbsp;

      My brain is starting to work again. After several years of inactivity, I'm being challenged by my course readings.  It's a pretty nice feeling but at the same time frustrating because I feel so stupid at times. I'm pretty sure that I'll be able to pass my subjects. Okay, so at least 80% sure.  Moving on to a more interesting thread. Some of my virtual classmates are weird. Weird in the sense that they seem to bloat everything that they write in the discussion boards. Geez. Some of them make sense plus they are written clearly and with no grammatical errors (read: spelling wise). It pisses me off to see wrong spelling on the boards or improper use of idioms. They're studying for a master's degree for gosh sakes!!!  I haven't watched TV for the past two weeks!

       The day started out great. My passport application was finally approved! After waiting for long hours from one government agency to another, it finally paid off. I'm expecting delivery by Saturday and I'm keeping my fingers crossed.      Bummed around the house after that. Ate a lot of unhealthy things.. I really should change my eating habits.       The best part of the day came around 7pm. I had a massage! It felt heavenly to have all the soreness and tightness pounded away by a total stranger. I pity the masseuse assigned to me because of all the very, very, very tight muscles that she had to massage. I'm so stressed at work that it's not healthy anymore. But let's not dwell on that. I'm still savoring the after effects of the massage. I hope I could this on a monthly basis.
