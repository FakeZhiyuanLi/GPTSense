           well lets see here its august 30th and well i guess i should start by telling something about myself. The name is Pike and i live in Reserve and i have a wonderful girlfriend and her name is Tara. She has three kids that are not mine but i feel like they are. well i guess i should introduce them also since they are a huge part of me and tara's lives first off there is Alex he is four years old and a skeemer if there ever was one and is also smart as a whip, Logan (2) he is how can i say this uuuuummmmm a brut tough as nails this boy is but also a little sooky at times like all kids can be. Emalee is a spit of her mother she is the cutest and most adorable one year old i have yet to meet. She is not up and walking yet but its only a matter if time before the curiousity comes out and Tara and i have to be on our toes.       Well to start off we have had a great summer all of us out loch lomon at the cottage. Alex and i would go fishing and i tell you this boy loves to fish he would fish all day if he had it his way. The hardest thing is trying to get him to leave the lake no matter how long we have been there but just to see how his eyes light up when i tell him "common bud lets go fishing" it makes it all worth it. I cannot wait untill Logan is a little older so he can come too he is all ready going with Alex and me sometimes but he is still not old enought to understand the concept as of yet. But the part i love about going to the cottage is the drive up and the beautiful landscape all along the way. But there is a bunch of things that ilike aout getting away from it all and the most important one is getting some time to be alone with Tara and the kids, Taking the boys down to the shore, the nice drives around the lake and seeing where all the roads take you it can be quite the adventure. Tara and i found this out one week while her parents were there lol.        Tara's parents had the kids for the day so we decided to go road hunting lol, so we start out around the lake and Tara started to tell me of the old survival camp that was there. Naturally i wanted to see it so she got me to turn up a road that had a no exit sign (which we couldn't see untill after the little adventure we had). So i head upo this road and Tara kept an eye out for the road/path to get to the survival camp. Well it wasn't to long we came to the spot where the path was supposed to be and it was then we had found out it was dug up by a logging company for some reason. So we decided to forget that and do some roadhunting this is where it starts to get some fun. So we are going down this winding dirt road in the middle of loch lomon and we come to a road going to the left so me being curious says hey lets see were this goes so we started up the road and when we get to the end we find that people are using it for a dumpsite for junk so we turn back to keep going down the road we started on. We find more roads but to the same conclusion but we come to one on the right and Tara says this takes us out by the cottage lets go this way we should head back. Well about an hour or so of driving down this skinny dirt road we come to a clearing that was nothing but these beautiful purple flowers so i stop and i ask are you sure this takes us out by the cottage we seem to be driving too long for it to lead there? Tara tells me yep just keep going and the road is getting a little rough then all of a sudden i get to a wall of spruce trees lol. Great canno get trough there any time soon so we head back over this rough turrain and come out at the other end this is where we see the no exit sign talk about feeling stupid we had a good laugh at the whole thing and we decided it was worth it because it was a fun little trip with some good laughs and some great scenery. Oh yeah did i mention it was all done in my rebuilt Ford Tempo lol.       The one thing is i had never had a chance to stay in a place like loch lomon before but i am glad i stated too it does alot for the soul all the people are nice out there and there is a great selection of fishing spots that are out of this world. Plus there is nothing like opening your eyes in the mourning and seeing the lake that calm that it looks like a mirrior with the sunrise glistening off it. Its is truely the best site you will ever see it really is, If not it will be the best sunrise you will ever see.

           Well tonight was a fascinating night for me and my family there was a wedding tonight and usually all my family does is fight when we get together at a social event but not this time. Everyone got together and we even managed to get a family picture of my dad and all of my brothers and sisters well theres a huge accomplishment for any of us we never got along so gooder. The one thing that i was happy for is that my hunny Tara got to go out and just have a ball and enjoy herself for a change it was worth a hell of alot to see her having a good time because she never gets to go out or even do anything remotely of this sort so hey GLAD TO SEE YOU HAVE FUN BABY. The thing is i stayed sober well cause i was the designated driver but i still had quite the fun myself so it was all good. Well there was a pile of things that had happened also, my ex ex girlfriend happened to be in attendance there too and what i thought would be awkward was actually quite easy to get through. We talked me,Tara and Alicia so iut turned out that Tara knew Alicia from high school which is really weird but hey all was cool. My brother locked the keys in his car lol well his woman did but the weird thing is my brother in-laws keys opened the door weird!       Well the main thing is we all had some fun and got along so that was the best thing to happen for quit a long time. The thing is we had so much fun that we all lost track of time and before we all knew it it was time to head out and go home or want not. We all said our goodbyes and headed home for a gooder nights sleep and we made some memories that will last for quite some time so it was a good gathering of the clan as you can say. So thats all for now but i will be back soon with another post in no time so STAY FROSTIE!

       Today was a great day for Alex he was at home with his mommy and he decided that he wanted his training wheels taken off his bike. So Tara made a deal with Al and that deal was that she would take one of the training wheels off of his bike and see how it went from there. Alex agreed to this hoping he would do good so that he might be able to get the other one taken off so he could be like his friends who do not have training wheels. Well much to our surprise Al pulled it off he was not even using the other training wheel at all so i had to do some work on my car so i went over to get Tara,Alex,Logan and emalee so they could visit my parents.       Well as soon as i got there Alex was so proud of how gooder he could ride his bike that he just had to show me, he went up and down the street like he never used training wheels then he asked me to take the other one off of his bike and i said yep sure buddy as soon as we get to my house and he was all for it. So we got to the house here in Reserve Mines and Alex could not wait to see how he would do without the training wheel so i went and got my tools and took it off for him. As soon as it was off Tara and i  helped him to get started moving and after that he was off like a bullet but he fell trying to turn around. But like the little trooper he was he got back up and tried and tried again eventually he got the nack for turning and we told Alex how proud we were of him and how gooder he was doing for the first time without training wheels. Now the only problem he had was to try to get himself started moving and he was out there for a good 1 to 2 hours trying it and eventually  he did that too. The one thing i do have to give Alex is he is not a quitter of couse he does fall a little bit but didn't we all lol.        Soon it was time to go home and as soon as we got there Alex ran to get his friends to show them that he could ride his bike without training wheels too. You could tell by the look on his face that he was proud of himself and to be honest i was very proud of the little guy too he may not be my son by blood but by the way i felt when he did this today he surtainly feels like it in my heart as it does for all of Tara's kids they are like my own now so hey WAY TOO GO AL I AM VERY PROUD OF YOU DUDE! Well thats it for todays session so STAY FROSTIE!

      well had a good day today was out working on my car so i had alot to do with the interrior. I needed to fix the door so it would open from the inside and change all the door panels and allow for winders where the panels i was changing to were power windows this was a fun thing to do and i also had to put in a few new seat leg covers. These things we just for fun nothing hard about it at all. But it got me out and doing something being unemployed is for the birds i hate it i loved working. Now all i do is go out and try to find things wrong with my car and i am starting to run out of things to do and i am not complaining by any means just getting bored. But it was a good day for me i got some stuff done that needed doing and i am deffinately doing that lol.  But on other things that happened today My mom had to go to the regional hospital and my dad had to go to the to the doctors office because the doctor called early this mourning to tell him to go down there today at 4 o'clock. That had all of us worried there for a while but when dad came home and told us that it was his colesterol was up so they increased his medication and that was a good sign that it wasn't too serious or nothing. We just have to watch what he eats and he is a stubborn man he thinks he can eat whatever he wants even though he has diabetes. But try to tell him that he cannot eat certain things. But then when his sugar is high he complains about it if he stuck to his diet he wouldn't have this problem. I guess we cannot really get mad if he does his own thing because he is going to do what makes him happy and he is old enough to know what the risks are for him.  But being back to being on the pogey train, it was all good for the first little while but i am really getting sick of it and no one seems to understand how much it bothers me not to have a job i feel like i am trapped here with nowhere to go. everyday i wake up and pray for the phone to ring and answer it to a voice that is telling me i got the job and i start on monday. I wish i hadn't have messed it all up when i was working for Stream that was one job that i really liked and enjoyed doing but hey now i am waiting to hopefully go back and get the life i once had. A life were i did not have to wait for a check to come in to go anywhere it is so depressing sitting home doing nothing thats not what i wanted to do in life. I remember how good it was to get up go to work and be there with all my friends and just have a great day while earning a living it is a feeling i miss alot. but i know it will not last for long and soon i will be back in the workplace but it just seems like the whole world i against me. Like i am not meant to get that all important phone call that i have been waiting for for the past 4 months its like a bad dream but i cannot linger on this and i know things are gonna change but the question is when? well there is only one person who can answer that one i just wish i knew who that was. Well i gotta go so STAY FROSTIE!

      Well hey there bloggers not too much going on here just that i was a little busy working on the old car. I spent the day with Tara and the kids and i must say i was a little cranky at the start of it all but hey we all have those days now don't we. I guess it can only be from the stress of all that goes on here at the old homestead. I found out one thing today that acording to my family i cannot move away but the fact is that if i was to make the decision to move away it would be my dicision and Tara's too. But it all was over Tara and i looking at available jobs in Calgary and Edmonton section just to see what was available.   If i truly wanted to go away i would go it would have to benefit me to do so like to better my future. As i see it my family has no say in these decisions i honestly think that they are mine to make. I would really like the opertunity to live my life they way i see fit not how anyone else seems to think that it should be i am 25 years old and i think i can manage on my own. To any family members that may read this do not take this post the wrong wat but i can make my own decisions so please leave it to me. I think that i am old enough and that i know exactly what i want in life so if i like what i see and wanna give it a go then hey i will be gone no questions so just let me have my life because you all have yours and live it so let me live mine please.  To make it a little more stressful of a day my mom who i love dearly had to go to the regional to get a bone density scan done due to a suspicion of her having brittle bone disease. As you can tell its been a fun day for me i guess thats how some people would say it but all will turn out gooder in the end i know it will. But i guess thats all for now i will be back a little later to write some more so in closing the only thing i can say is STAY FROATIE! Later people.

      What a day i had today i do not know where to start! I guess from the begining would be a gooder place so here it goes. I recieved a call from an old friend who has been in ontario for about 2 years i guess and i never heard a word from him until today he called and we were talking on the phonefor a bit then he asks me to pick him up and we can go for a coffee or something so i did. Well i picked him up and we went down to hortons and grabbed some java and we talked but i had to head home to help out my brother in law with his car so he came along. Well we got there and i started to help out my brother in law derrick and all steve did was complain how he needed to get a coffee and he wanted me to drive him to town. Well then it struck me he said he was home for a bit before he called me and well i knew why he called me it was the fact that he did not have a drive to town so thats why he called me up. So all i did was tell him no i couldn't go anywhere i had to help out derrick then when i turned my head he took off left never even told me, well guess thats the way it is now then eh lol. So anyways i go back to getting the parts off the car and my girlfriend calls Tara so i go in and pick up the phone and she needs to go do some errands in sydney so i tell her that i will be done soon and then i will head out to her place to take her where she was going, But that justs at the time seemed to make her think i was blowing her off (but i wasn't) and we have a little arguement on the phone so i hang up go out and finish what i was doing in the yard and soon enought we were done. So i go in the house and give Tara a call to tell her i am on the way out to get her she says ok she will be ready, so i get cleaned up and head out to her house to get her and we go to Sydney do what we had to do. So we decide to take the kids to see my parents for a little bit, So this is all good my parents love taras kids like they were thier own and the kids the same way.  A little time passes and Tara the kids and I head back home but before that we stop at Tara's parents place because Tara's mom wanted to see the kids for awhile.We get there and everything is fine and a while later Tara's daddy gets home from work so we leave because he has been up since early in the morning to head for work, So we head out so he can sleep after he eats. But we get out to the car and the battery is dead, the kids must have turned on the lights when they were out playing so i had to go and ask Tara's dad for a boost, so we get the boost and take the kids home to get them ready for bed.  as you can see i had a good and bad day but hey what can you do but grin and bear it no use letting things get to you all you have to do to have a gooderest day is STAY FROSTIE!  P.S The meaning of STAY FROSTIE is only known by a select few so they know what i mean.

       What a great day for me!   How do i start this one out well i do not know so here we go i guess. Well it started off with me trying to get some work done on my car so i had to borrow the money off of my dad to get them untill my pogey rolled in. Well i headed out to go get my parts and mom needed to go to town so she came with me she needed to go to town anyways. She went to get my dad some pop and when we got home i found out that stream called and they wanted me too go right down as soon as possible. So i went down and i find out that they wanted me to sign a rehire form well already did that. So now i got about five people trying to get me back on down there well cannot complain i loved the job and i am happy to know at least i was liked while i was there. I hope i do get the job back because i have waited a long time for a second shot at it and it looks like i got my chance to. So all is good for me well not all but alot is lol. The best thing of it all is that Tara is really happy for me and is almost excited as i am to be off the pogey train lol but i does mean we spend less time together but we can manage we always have.  I am just so happy to be almost back to work but i was told that i will be getting a call for work so hey that is all i needed to hear because i have been waiting 5 months for another chance at this job that i liked so much. No one knows how i feel to be working again, its like you have a purpose or something like that it is hard for me to explain. I finally do not have to worry about my bills i will be able to pay them and also have some money to spend on my car and me. I never knew how bad things would be if i did not work and well they were that bad i was thinking of going back to taxi driving to make the ends meet. Glad i never had to do that i hated it with a passion its not one of those how you say likeable jobs it can be dangerous at times and on that here is a little story about one of my first calls/fares as a taxi driver.       It was a saturday night and i was just after starting to drive for my brother who owned mullins taxi at the time and it was almost the end of the shift when i pulled up to see if there was anyone left at the Main event. There was and three guys got into the car and i asked where are you headed they said New Waterford and i said where at ? I was told new Victoria  then i said ok guys twenty bucks upfront company policy. So the guys paid up no questions asked and we started for New Victoria and we got there and i asked what street and they said Browns Road so i turned down and asked what hows guys they told me to keep going. We got to the end where you can turm left or right the guys told me to turn right so we started off and came to a dark clearing and as soon as we hit this clearing an arm grabbed me from around the seat. Then i was being pulled over the front seat and everyone who drove cab kept a wheel wrench beside the seat so i reached for it. When i got the wheel wrench in my hand all three guys started to pound the fuck out of me, while they were hitting me i was trying to open the door to get out. Finally i got the door open and got out on my feet and before the first guy could get out right i cracked him with the wheel wrench he was out like a light. The second guy i hit him too and the third ran away i never ever called the police for the simple reason i still had there fare and my own money but i also tought them a lession i hope anyways. One thing i can say is that it was the scariest  night of my life but since that day forward i never went without my wheel wrench!  This is a true story so now you have some idea what a taxi drivers life is like everyday wondering who is that sitting behind you wondering if they are going to try something or even try to kill you. So remember this the next time you are in the cab. Well thats it for now so STAY FROSTIE!

       Got some stuff done today!   well i had a good day today i had gotten a little more work done to my car and discovered more that has to be done, so i guess while i am off work i can get these things done. I hope to be getting a call for work soon i could use the pick me up of working i am getting depressed just collecting pogey it sucks not doing a thing and not getting the money you are used to getting. i almost gone nuts trying to pay bills on pogey gezz what a time trying to do that. It was a pile of fun it really was, but back to the car let me see i put new tire rod ends ne ball joint new brake pads ajusted the back brake shoes today and i still have a few other things to do to it so hey this otta be exciting lol.  My dad finally got a motor for his car one thats the same year so there is going to be no need to change anything just take out the old one and put in the new one so there is something else i am going to do but it keeps me busy so i cannot complain about that. Dad is excited he will have his wheels back anyways no depending on everyone else anymore. Mind you we do not mind doing things for him but he likes to do for himself too and not have to rely on someone else for a drive or anything like that. But the way i look at it is hey at least you got a way to go somewhere and you do not have to dish out money for a cab or anything when you need to go somewhere. At least he agrees to that part of it anyways, and do not get me wrong he does apriciate it also even though he does not say he does we all know that he does and thats all that matters.  I think my girlfriend Tara is a little weiry about me going back to work like when are we going to see each other and scared i will i guess bye the sounds of it meet someone else while i am there. I think that has alot to do with the fact that it is the exact same way we met and the exact place, i know she is thinking this but to truely honest here i have had nothing but bad relationships and i do mean alot of them. But what me and Tara have is different and why would i give up what i got with her which is  a trusting, honest, truthful relationship for a relationship that is only going to give me heartach  i myself do not know the answer and honestly i think i would be crazy to give up what i got with Tara for something i have no idea were i stand.  Well it is getting late and i need to get to bed so for all you people out there in blogger land STAY FROSTIE!

       Just a regular day for me!   Hey people how is it out there in blogger land? Well never had too much to brag about here just the same old day except for the fact that i was drove right out of my mind all day. Well for starters i couldn't go see Tara today because my car was almost out of gas so i had no way to go see her which was very depressing. I really missed her and the kids alot today and i just wish i could have gotten out to see them but this was not gonna happen. So i just knew this day was going to be a disaster right from the get go so i tried to make a go of it anyway, Well didn't happen as you are about to find out.  I got out of bed and i was sitting in the living room, doing the usual an my dad got out of bed and it might as well have been a bear. Man he got up so cranky today no one could even look in his direction and they were in his sights. My mom i felt bad for she always takes the brunt of his crankyness, But people do not get me wrong here he would never hurt her he was just insainly cranky. But after a while i guess he got sick of ragging out on her and turned his attention to me and boy he let loose with all the things he did not think i was doing.So rather than staying there and taking it and running the risk of saying something i would regret i retreat into my room here and surf the net and chat on messenger for a bit. But him being cranky with me made me a little cranky myself and so i was in a bad mood. Before i write any more on this i would like to tell Tara that i am sorry for the way i was today and hope she can understand how it was for me today, So Tara i know you read this blog so i would like to say " I am really really sorry for being an asshole today and for taking it all out on you. You did not do anything to me but it was like you were the one that was causeing all the stress today so from the bottom of my heart I am sorry baby i hope you can forgive me. I loves Ya babe. Oh yeah and about the little arguement we had on messenger this evening i am sorry and yes i do beleive you hunny ok, I know when i am wrong and yes i am man enough to admitt it. I was wrong you never gave me a reason to doubt you so i am sorry.  Well tried my hand at html for the first time today it was a little hard to figure out at first but with the help of dave and playing around with first page i think i can get a little handle on it, well at least i hope i can lol. One thing that did make me feel pretty good was the fact that Tara's son Alex is going to be starting school next week and he is so excited to be going and it helped him some to find out that one of his friends is in his class also. But i kinda do not want him to go to school i will miss him asking me all kinds of questions about whatever i am doing at the time, It is annoying at most times but hey you get used to something and you miss it when its gone. But he got to grow up sometime and what better time than now i just cannot wait to hear all about his first day at school. Even though Al will be at school i will still have Logan and Emalee to keep me busy so that should be fun just to have some time with the two youngest for a while each day.  I did realize one thing tonight and that is i am very jelous when it comes to Tara Lee and i do have to get over this it is not fair to here to have to go through this bullshit so this is something i have to work on so i do not lose my girlfriend and my best friend. The strange thing is she never gave me a reason to be jelous or to suspect anything like other people have in the past. So i think dispite of what the past did to me i realize that Tara Lee diserves an honest start in this relationship, Because it is not fair to judge someone based on past experiences no matter how bad the past was for me Tara did not do this.  The worst thing about today is being stuck here all day with my parents and my mother she is the worst i am twenty-five and i am being treated like i am a four year old it is so frustrating, even though i am the youngest of all my brothers and sisters please do not treat me like i am a four year old boy. I am old enought to do things for myself i am able so just let me do them but it does not seem to be happening and sometimes i feel like just moving out but really i cannot i need to stay here with them incase something happens to one of them in the middle of the night i would have to handle it because either one of them would be a loss in these situations.  I do have some good news my pogey will be in tomorrow so i can pay some bills that i have let go. Man i hate this pogey thing it is really testing my nerves i ahte being home nothing to do not earning a living this pogey is a torture not a help. Soon i will be back amoung the working ranks and to be honest i cannot stand the wait. But thats one thing i have right now in life is some extra time so i have to wait for the ever alusive phone call but its getting late so remember STAY FROSTIE!

      Hey people its me again here to post another boring blog for you to read and use to analize me lol. Yes Tracy i do remember chasing you through the ball field and hitting you with snowballs but that was all in fun i never threw you to the ground and beat you like those kids did to my godson. But hey you are right when you say hey just the good ol days, back when there was no rent and no worries except for maybe homework lol. What ever happens to the ability we had when we were kids to always have something fun to do? In my opinion i think we lose it at puberty because right after that happens you always find yourself bored and sitting around with nothing to do. I can remember when i was small i always had something to do but now i find myself bored and lost sometimes with no idea what to do to pass time it can be a torture sometimes it really can be.  Well i do not know what else to write about so i guess i will write about my day today. i got up and got ready it was the same old daily ruteen. My father decided he was going out to take the rest of the motor out of his car. So i wasn't gonna sit back and watch him do it so i decided to go out to be there just incase he needed some help. All i have to say is he never lost his touch with working around cars, he is 68 years old and he can still do the work he always loved to do when he was younger. Everyone thinks he should be in the house sitting on the couch in front of the tv, well i totally think that they want him to get worse because if he does not do anything then thats not good for him at all either. So i would like to say this "leave him alone he is doing what he likes to do and it sure gets him moving so it is a form of exercise so leave him do it. It is good for him to get out and do something like that as long as he takes his time and knows when to take a rest. I do not know about the rest but i do not want my father to sit on the couch and do nothing but wait to die i would rather he do something and at least get some exercise too.   It was not long before we were almost ready for the motor to come out but da had decided that he had done enough for the day so he called it quits at about 5 o clock i guess. I was after comming in and Derrick was out there helping dad anyways so no need of the two of us out there so i took the time to go see Tara and the kids for a while.SO when i got there Tara was on the couch and asked me what i wanted to do and i said lets take the boys to the park since they were good we can treat them to the park as a reward for them being good. But Tara wanted to go to Cheryls house so Alex could see Becky for a while, its right cute they are like a little couple it is really sweet. But i really did not want to go because sometimes Cheryl gets on my nerves and i cannot stand it for too long, So Tara and i discussed it and we decided hey lets go. So we piled all the kids into the car and headed for Cheryls house.  When we pulled into the yard all you could hear was little Becky screeming hey mommy they are here they made it mommy, it was so cute she was so excited to see us and alex most of all. So we were there talking while the kids played and about an hour later it was time to go back home. So we are off and chatting the whole way home untill all of a sudden Tara realizes she forgot her purse at Cheryls, so we turn around more than half way home at start back to Cheryls. WE get there and Cheryl is at the door with the purse laughing because we had to come all the way back for it, but hey it was a drive for us anyway.  When we got home all the kids were asleep in the car so we got them in the house and in bed, the poor kids they were exhausted. Bit that was the day i had today so i guess it was a good day for me and Tara, But most of all the kids had fun and thats what it is all about. So untill next post STAY FROSTIE!

      Well as you can tell from the title it was pogey day so that means i kept the wolves from the door for a little longer lol. I am just glad that i got my funiture paid off and my internet bill completely paid off so i am gooder for another while at least. So i had to go out to buy a new brake caliper for the old car and when i went to pick it up at safe way auto parts the clerk asked if i had rebuilt the car yet. The only thing i could say was no not yet got a few more things to do first then the car will be rebuilt. We had a little laugh and i headed to home to work on the car well i got the new caliber and everything seems to be good with the brakes so all is gooder.  I finally got to go see Tara today, this was great i missed her a whole bunch and i needed to talk to her. If i had to spend one more day at home that would have been it for me i think, just cannot take being stuck in the house. We went for a drive and then went to see my parents.   Well still no sign of that allusive phone call i mentioned back a few posts, Its the worst thing waiting for the phone to ring and everytime it does running for it because i think its the call how nuts is that...lol. I is just so depressing waiting for a important call like this then it makes the day a whole lot longer. The other thing is i was told that i am going to get the call i deffinately got the job but no call yet so i guess i am in for more of the waiting game i just love to play lol. But on another note i have a godson mason and well he is six and today while heading home from school for lunch he was chased by a fifth grader who knocked him off his bike and ripped his shirt. Also did a little number on my little bud, There is nothing worse than a bully and i am going to teach my godson how to drop these fuckers like the shit they are. To be honest i went trough that in school and i would just take it untill one day i got sick of it and started to fight back and you know what? They never bothered me again. This is what Mason has to do i know they are bigger than him but its the only way to get them to leave him alone. Like i told my sister she was in school at one time what happened if you went to the principal ? Well here in Reserve Mines you got it worse after school for being a rat. So like i said telling on them is not going to do nothing it is only gonna make things worse he has to stand up and fight for himself in order to stop them from doing this to him over and over again. But he will get the respect he deserves.  On a good note today Da is feeling alot better and he even got out in the yard and started to finish taking the motor out of his baby So hats of to you Dad its a start for you anyways. Well i guess this ends todays session for now. So remember STAY FROSTIE!

      Well Logan had a great night away from his mommy last night he was even up untill ten to twelve, So you know he had a good night. Me i am having a bad night i cannot sleep and i am sick as a dog, its hard to breath so imagine trying to fall asleep lol lots of fun there.But anyway on to the nice day i have had, well tara and i spent the day together so that was great except for the fact that i am sick and groggy.   Now the kids they went to the playground by my parents house to play and they were over there for a good four hours they had a blast. By the time they came back for supper they were filthy from head to toe, but like my dad always says if they got dirty then they had fun so i guess these guys thought they were in disneyland lol. I mean these boys were dirty and Emalee walked from the coffee table to me today i am so proud of her she is really growing up. She is so sweet and i seen a picture of Tara at the same age man they are identical. One thing Tara cannot do is deny that little girl she is Tara version two lol.  But Alex and Logan love Reserve they made a ton of new friends plus they love my parents to death and my parents love them too. I actually thought they would be kinda shy but hey the mixed right in with the other kids and they just have the time of there lives when they are over Reserve.   But to get on to another note Tara and i are getting along pretty good the last while back, sure we argue but we all do that cannot like each other all the time. But all is finally looking good for us it really is, I am going back to work hopefully and the same with her also. But i know i am repeating myself but hey i cannot sleep so i guess the readers will have to suffer too lol. Today was one of the best Tara and i have had in a long time but i wish we could get up to the cottage a few more times before it is time to lock it up for the winter that would be the best thing for us i think. Nothing ever matters up the country we always get along and do things with the kids and go for drives around the lake so it works out for some good time spent together. I love it up there it is so quiet up there and really really peaceful man i miss it now just from writing about it lol.   But i guess i am going to wrap this up i need to get some sleep or at least try to get some sleep anyways , But remember STAY FROSTIE!

      Hey what a bad day that turned out great for Tara and i so all is good. Well it started like ant other bad day i knew as soon as i got up this morning. I went to Tara's we had some errands to run and we had to go for groceries, So we went and got groceries and took the kids to my parents which is almost an everyday thing. But hey mt parents love Tara's kids like if they were thier own grand kids, and beleive me the feeling is mutual with the kids also. So while we were here at the old homestead Tara made supper which was great thanks again baby, then we did the dishes and headed for her house well as soon as we got there we got the phone call we never expected. Well i guess i can tell you Tara might have her job back with the shifts that she wants and her t2 postion intact, I could never be more happier for her. So before we know it we will be back working together again i cannot wait for my time to go back.  So we are all excited now we cannot wait to be working together once more it will be like old times, well which were not that long ago lol. But to get to little Logan he had his very first sleep over with his nanny and poppy cheetham tonight. When Tara droped him off she told me that Logan cried to leave when she put her shoes on to head home. Then we are sitting there on the couch and the phone rings, it was Tara 's mom and she said logan would not go to sleep and Tara asked if she gave him some pop. So we find out that Tara's mom gave Logan a can and a half of pop, Tara and i started to laugh and filled her mom in on the fact that pop to logan are like wake up pills for him so she had to deal with it . We also told he that the only chance she had of him going to bed was putting in a movie for him and then maybe then he will doze off.  Never the les her mother was not impressed i don't think but She did it so she had to handle it lol. Tara's mother was a little urked because all we could do was laugh and tell her to have fun with that lol. But we did not think he would have been trouble because if we did we would go get the little guy. I cannot wait to hear how his night was see if he makes it through ok after all it is his first time away from mommy.  Well just to let everyone out there to know that Tara and i are great and we were never better, of course we have our fights but if we didn't there deffinately would be something wrong there. But in all fairness i can be difficult alot of the times so i couldn't blaim it all on her ( but i could though) just kidding Tara hunny you knoe that. But i am running out of things to write so until next time STAY FROSTIE!

      Oh my god where to start, well its been a while since i posted and the reason for this is that hey i had so much to do the last few days i really had no time to do anything with my blog at all. Alex had his first day at school this week and i must say it looks for for thr little guy he likes it so there's a good start for him anyways. But he did not want to go firt he just did not think he would like it, but once he saw that there were kids he knew and all the toys in the classroom he figured it was worth a shot. I am so glad that he likes school and wants to go , he did not want to leave when it was over but i guess that wears off in no time lol.   on to more things after alot of searching around for the info i found out what was involved in putting the older motor in the old mans car so we got more done on that today. We got the old motor out now all we have to do is get the new one adapted and bolted to the transmission to put it in so hey there is tomorrows work for the day. just a question to you readers. Do you respect you elders all the time? Well i try to but oh my god my father really pissed me off today alot of times for one he did not beleave me about what the head mechanic at Plaza Ford said about putting an old motor in to a new style car. He acted like if i was trying to trick him but hey let that go. The last time we were putting a ball joint in so we could move the car to drop the motor to the floor so we had to pry down on the ball joint to put it in place and of course i was the guy with the bar prying on the ball joint. So before i could do anything the pipe slipped and never hit no one but the old man tears a strip off me. So i tell him its gonna slip the bar is bent so he flys off at me again so i tell him to do it himself if he thinks he can do it b etter. So he keeps the critesising up and i had enought so i throw the pipe to the floor and leave. I hate how old people think that everything is done on purpose no matter how things appear to be, they just think everyone is out to get them i just do not know they are all crasy if you ask me .   i just frind that they need something to go on about to others, like they are trying to throw a big good old pitty party but hey i do not go for that crap. One other thing that bothers me, everything is the young peoples fault no matter if they do it or not its always the closest young person to the event that gets the flack for anything that happens to them its rather pathetic i find.   But the biggest thing for me lately is everyone is always on my case about something it drives me crazy, seems like no matter what i do, it is always the wrong thing to do or never good enough. Even when you give up your time to help someone they complain about how you do things its like they do not get the consept of help you never critesizse a person that is helping you because they will not take it and they will never ever come back if you need help in the future. Why do some people do this? well guess it makes them feel like they are important or something but hey just be thankfull for the help.    So got to do somemore work to das motor today it was great everything went great for me and Derrick just all fell in to place so there is not too much to complain about here lol. But it was a great day for us to be out working in the barn it was like we could do nothing wrong, we never ran into a problem not a single one. So before the old fella realizes it Derrick and i will have the motor in the car for him and i cannot wait Da hates being without a car even though he does have mine if he needs it  Tara's kids spent the day with my sister Pauline and the kids had a ball with Mason they love playing with him, So it was a good day all around and i am running out of things to write so untill next time STAY FROSTIE!

      well i did have a good day and also a bad day but hey it was a fun but blah day to start it all off i was sick as a dog all week. So the day started when my sister called Tara to see if she wanted to go over to her house and go for a walk, they have been talking about walking for a while now because they wanted to lose a few pounds. So Tara got krista to take her over to Paulines and after she was there for a bit she called me to see if i could babysit so her and Pauline could go for a walk but i couldn't because i was after masking the car in so i could paint the moldings. But anyways my neice Alicia babysat for Tara so she could go for a walk with Pauline so all is good.  So on to the fact that i was sick all week and to tell the truth i have been sick for a few months, well i was not sick i just did not feel to good, something just isn't right with me the last while back.I cannot explain it but i think i might be depressed or something i am not physically ill but its like i am run down and i get all the sleep that i need i get my 8 to 10 hours so i do not know what is wrong. So i made a doctors appointment to get to the bottom of this.  But i do not have too much more to write about so STAY FROSTIE!

      Not too much eventfull has happened today but even if it is boring i will tell you how my day was today. well i never had a good sleep but i got up and my mom tells me that Tara called and is on her way over in a taxi. Tara arrives and we have to go do some running around and get some things done.  We start out going to Sydney so Tara can pay her rent, so we went to IBEW to give the rent to her landlord which is also her mom. Then we had to go for an errand for my Dad and pick up a application for a grant to get the basement done all over, Well the foundation anyways it needs toi be done bad its starting to crack and it might start to leak so we need to get that done. So Tara ran in to get the application and while she was in there Alex sees a girl walking bye and says hey Pike she is pretty aye? You never know what the little guy is going to say, it surprises you alot of the times the things he comes up with. So Tara comes out and we head for the courthouse so she can drop off some papers to family court. Then we head home to my house and i realize there is alot of shaking in the car so i check it and the balljoint on the passenger side is gone so i need to get one, so i bum the money off my Dad to get the part i need and i head to saf-way to get it.   So i get the part and put it on and well the car drives really good and the only thing for me to do now is get the new front tires put on and get an alignment and the front of the car will be all done. Then i can start on some of the less important things.  But even though i had a busy day i had a pretty good day when i think of it. Nothing serious happened and everything went good for me so hey not too many days like that head my way so i am happy how todat turned out for me so untill next time people STAY FROSTIE!

       hey people how is everything? i think i am over this sick spell i was having but it seems like it comes and goes from day to day. Tara and i took the kids for a drive through donkin and morien almost to catalone they liked it but they fell asleep on the way back lol. The drive did them good because they were cranky all day, nothing could please them. All Alex wanted was to go to see Mason all day he bugged and bugged to go out to dominion, So we took the little guy out and Tara and i had a good chat with Pauline over some up and comming Mullins family events as of late. Sometimes i think some of the things my family does should be on Jerry Springer the title of the show would be "One Crazy Family" i can see it now lol.  My family is a nutty one sometimes it seems like a war when we get together and other times we get along its really kinda weird. For the longest time i thought all families were like that untill i seen other families together,then i realized mine was a little special/crazy lol. I just hate how they are nice to you then turn and stick a knife in your back sometimes its like they are afraid you are getting ahead of them.  But on the lighter side of things the old car i rebuilt is working great i just got a few more things to do to it and it will be all done and to be honest i cannot wait for it to be done so i just have to do some regular matenence.Well i guess thats all for now i have to get up early Alex has school so its an early night for me lol so STAY FROSTIE!

      As you can tell i am having some knee problems today but it wasn't all like this when i got up. Lets see i went over to take alex to school and i noticed that there was a stain on the road where i park my car at tara's house. So curiousity gets the best of me and i have to see what or where it is leaking so i get down on my knees to see what it is and i kneel on a rock on the road. When i did i heard my knee pop and i knew it was not going to be a good thing later in the day and well boy am i feeling the effects now man it hurts. So we droped Alex off at school and to our amazement he actually wanted to go to school so this was a bonus, He wanted me to take him in to school but i seen how it made Tara feel so i got him to let his mother take him in because i seen how much it meant to her. So Tara took Alex in to the school for the official first day at school.Tara came out and we went to her parents house and had a cup of tea and soon it was time to go get Alex at scholl so we piled Emalee and Logan in the car and picked Alex up and he had a blast at school and he made tara a puppet at school in crafts. He also got a new girlfriend at school too (I am so proud of him ) and her name is marissa and she wanted Tara to take a picture of Alex (her new boyfriend ) and her together lol.   So after we got Alex we took a drive to Reserve and Alex and Logan went to the park and played all day we actually had to go and get them when it was time to go home and of course they did not want a part of that, they wanted to stay with Nanny and Poppy Mullins for awhile longer but we cannot do that they needed to go home and get ready for bed so they put up a fight but we got them in the car to go home so all was gooder.   So tomorrow i have to do the brake line on my car thats what is leaking out of the car so cannot mess with that i will just replace the bad line and then good as new.Sometimes it feels like thats all i do is fix that bloody car but it will be all worth it when its done.  I just got one more thing to say to Tara about the discussion we had i love you hunny and i do want to be with you so remember i will always be there for you and i will always love you no matter what happens.Oh yeah and one more thing STAY FROSTIE!

      well today started out like no other day everything was so so. I had to check my car again and it was not good i need to replace to back wheel cylinder mine bit the dust its leaking like a sive. But thats not it i also got my pogey today and i made an appointment at Dayton Tire to get my car lined up and new tires put on. So i go outside and what do i see but my exhaust is hanging down so i had to go get changed and get that car off the ground so i could tie the exhaust up in place. I am getting pretty sick of always having something wrong with my car it is so frustrating. It can be really expensive when you are like me and buy all new parts for the car because you do not trust second hand parts. I just do not know what to do i need to fix the car but it sems when everything is going right and working something else goes. it is just so agravating for me i fix and replace used worren parts and still i have problems, Feels like there is a target on my back when it comes to cars recently.   But i guess i will have to live with it untill it passes because well honestly there's nothing else to do except to fix all problems untill everything is brand new lol. I would never get what i got put into the car so i might as well use it and get my moneys worth out of it. But on another note there is someone in my family who turned her back on her kids that is something that i do not understand. How can someone just pack up and leave thier two kids with thier parents? I really need someone to explain this to me because for me there is no reason what so ever. I mean picture haveing two beautiful kids then one day leave them and not showing you face back home in 4-5 days (I think). I think that the person who does this has to have absolute;y no heart or conscience at all it is a tottal sin for those kids they need there mom because thier father took off not too long after the second one was born, now there is a man for you eh! I could never imagine not bothering with Tara's kids if her and i broke up and that is something we have talked about and i told her that her kids are close to me and if there was something to break us up i would still go to see the kids even though they are not mine. But we have grown close to each other the kids and i. They look up to me like they would look up to a father so hey, and they hardly ever see there real father at all so when Alex asked me to be a dad for him of course i said yes its not his fault that his father is a deadbeat daddy! So why should Alex,Logan and Emalee suffer for something that was not thier doing. I do dad things with then and i do what i can when i can and thats all that Alex sees. And that is me acting like a father to him so his natural instinct is to think of me in that way. To be honest i do not mind it neither i will just do the best that i know how.  But people its getting late and i have to get my car in Sydney for its appointment so i have to cut this session off a little short so untill next time STAY FROSTIE!

      Well where to start oh well here we go it all started when i was going to take my car out to Dayton Tire to get a front wheel alignment and two new tires put on the front because i already got the ones for the back. But before i went to Dayton i needs to take Tara to see her friend out in Howie Center who is Cheryl so i picked up her and the kids and took them to Cheryl's house and it was going to be a  wonderful day  for me and the car. So i headed for Dayton and when i got there i checked in and they took the car to do the alignment and the new tires, It wasn't too long untill they came out and informed me about my inner tirerod ends were both bad an needed to be replaced so they could not do the alignment. Then the guy asks me a stupid question Do you still want the new tires put on and of course i said no they will only be skuffed off. So back in the car and out to Howie Center i go to pick Tara and the kids up at Cheryl's and as soon as i pulled in the yard Tara askes "Why are the new tires not on the car?" all i could do is look at her all disappointed and say because i need to buy more parts for the damn thing they could not do the alignment because the inner tirerod ends are bad so i need them before i can do the alignment. The look on Tara's face was priceless i think she really wanted to burn the car but i have way too much money invested in it now to just burn the car lol. So i guess i got to get my use out of it for at least a yer anyways.  So i went out today and got my inner tirerod ends and a new wheel cylinder so i got what i need to do thr job, but after i got the inner tirerod ends off Derrick noticed that they were different and i needed to call saf-way to see if they had the right ones for my car in stock and behold they did. So with my car up on blocks i had to get my sister Pauline to take me down to saf-way to get my parts. I got them and put them on the car it pulls to the passenger side a bit but i have to adjust that tomorrow. I also have to put the new wheel cylinder on then the front end will be all new yay and with warrenties.   But on a gooder note Tara's boys Alex and Logan are gone to the bungalow with their grandparents so its just me,Tara and Emalee for the whole weekend which would be good for a change lol. Emalee is such a good baby she is never a problem she is a angel, My little princess thats what she is i love her to death she is the cutest little girl but do not get me wrong  i love the boys too. Logan spent most of the day with me today, I needed to take my mom to town and he would not get out with his mommy so i took him with me and we had some fun together. We went to Canadian Tire and he was so happy that he had got to come in with me he was so excited he was. Then we picked my mom up and took her to the pharmacy and she was a little long in there and Logan was halloring "nanny hurry up nanny" it was so precious it really was but i must say Logan and i had fun together. I must say he may be two but man that kid is a blast lol. But i need to get going so see ya next post STAY FROSTIE!

      Today was my parents anniversery and we all headed out to my sister Miriams house for a get together and some supper so not all good get out there for it but most of us did. I think Ma and Da had the best time they got to see some great grand children they hardy get to see so they injoyed thierselves alot. One really good thing was that two of my sisters finally gave up on thier little sqabble that has been going on for years and finally today it came to an abrupt end when one of our neices is going west with her boyfriend/fiancee and they are having a little going away party for her in a week and one sister (the one fighting with the other)said to the other and you are invited too and winked. So my other sister Pauline started to cry for what Bessie said because as far as Pauline knew Bessie hated her for being so close to Da,So i went over to Bessie when Pauline started to cry and told her Pauline was crying. Bessie asked me why and i told her when she told Pauline she was invited to Wendy's party she lost it and started to cry. Then Bessie asked me why would she cry and i told her because Pauline thought you hated her and Bessie said no i love her and went over to her and told Pauline that she loved her sure they fight but she loves her and they both wrapped there arms around each other and were crying. They did not talk to each other in about  8 years and it was all over jelousy over one being too close to Dad but at least now its all over and done with now i just hope that thay stay friends and forget all the bull that went on before. Another reason why i am glad they made up is that Dad and Ma always hated it when the family could not get along and now it is almost to the point were we all can get together and not have any problems with each other it is really great. But thats all for now so STAY FROSTIE!

      Hey its me good old Big Daddy Cool back for another posting in the blog lol. Right now i am here in my room talking to Tara on msn messenger waiting for the big old hurricane Juan to hit. I was watching the news and it was showing pictures of Halifax and it looks bad and the hurricane is not over Halifax yet so could be a wrecker. But there is nothing we can do except to wait it out but nothing like that ever does anything here in good old Cape Breton. But me and Tara are fine we are getting along pretty good not too many fist fights lol just kidding, the boys got back from the country today and man were they exausted and soon as they got home they went right to bed it was a sin for the little guys they were so tired.  Today Tara met some more from my family and boy did she find out what i meant by my family is nuts. She met my stuck up neice Sherry at Sherry's baby shower and she was really not impressed at all lol. She said she is the most rude and obnocious person she has ever met in her life so i take it was a bad impression lol. But i guess there is nothing to do about that she had to meet them sooner or later, but one good thing is that she is really close to my sister Pauline and they are almost best friends actually you could say they were best friends. But Tara thinks its bothers me that she talks to Pauline but it really doesn't i think it is great that her and my sister are best friends, and actually come to think of it my sister never really liked any of my girlfriends so i is wierd that they are so close but its a good thing if i must say so. So Tara i hope that this tells you that i do not have a problem with you hanging out with my sister ok baby. But i have to end this post a little early because well i have to get up early to get Alex to school so later and STAY FROSTIE!

      Hey looks like someone got nothing better to do but to go through peoples blogs and tell them how meaningless they think they are well i got a little news for them. You call me the loser who really is the loser? You are the one going around in peoples blogs cutting them up for the mistakes they have made. I have one question do you really have a life outside all of this or are you one of those people who cannot face the outside world so they take it out on everyone else. Actually i think you are the most childish immature person on this planet and you have no life so you have to come on the net and attack other people just to bring you self esteem up now who is the pathetic one here. just go and crawl into the hole you crawled out of you are nothing but a diease of society that is hidden from the rest of the world so why don't you just go away and disappear be leave me no one would miss you.   Oh and i contacted Blogspeek and they are logging all ip's and the comments for each posted comment so have a blast posting them it will catch up to you once we find the ip and one more thing Blogspeek will be contacting the internet service provider of the person responsible and it is a violation of any isp's user agreement so have fun   Tracy   keep it up and hang yourself lol.  But on the brighter side Tara and i are getting along pretty good Oh yeah and Tracy Somers i know it isn't you so relax bud i know if you had something to say to me or Tara you would come right to my face. But as soon as Blog speek catch this assjockey i will surely let you know who it is because they are giving me the name of the person so we can all get a good laugh. All we need is one or maybe two more posts and we will have the last laugh how sweet is that. Tara and i had the kids out Reserve today and they had a ball at the park they love it out here in good old Reserve Mines they never even wanted to go home at all they were having so much fun. Tara also took the kids out for dinner they loved that too, But to the trouble maker/GNLT (Got No Life Transiate) Tara is a great mother and she loves her kids very much she gives those kids everything they need so you have no room to talk about her maybe your mother neglected you and thats why you are the way you are. The last thing i am going to say to you is stop trying to analize tara and start ananlizing yourself clearly you are the one with the issues. But thats it for now people Take it easy and STAY FROSTIE!

      Hey people its me Big Daddy Cool just wanted to let you know that there is no comments as you can see i was advised to take the comments out due to a tremendous stupid bitch that does not know what she is talking about i wrote blogspeak and they told me you could not have asked you isp because your account would have been closed due to you are a menace to the internet community. You did not call your isp how dumb are you what did you tell them yeah i am harassing people on the net can they get my ip and report it to you. Gee how dumb are you but hey what else can you expect from someone whose day involves surfing blogs and posting the same comments in all the blogs she comes across. I cannot beleave you would say those things about Corrine she is a great person and i know i have only known her for a short time but i know she is a great person and the only reason you go on like this is because you are jelous of her and all she is doing and has in her life. So get off the anger train and go get some help assjockey leave her alone as far as i am concerned  Corrine is a beautiful person and also one of the best people i have met in a very long time. So Corrine just do not mind her she is someone that got nothing else to do and has a terrible life so she wants to make ours the same. Not gonna work.  But on the lighter side of things I am in a great mood i am happy for once could be the pound  of weed i smoked lol. Just here at Tara's parents house updating this blog which i actually like to do so thats a plus. Halloween is comming up and i cannot wait for the kids to get all dressed up and head out it is going to be a clear ball for the kids and the look on thier faces is going to be worth more than anything i can think of. Lets see  Emalee is going out as a princess (she is anyways ) Alex is going as Spiderman and Logan is going as Bob the Builder so when he is done trick or treating he can fix my house for me lol. We are also going to have some fireworks for the kids after the trick or treating so i think they will like that alot but i do not know who will like it more them or me.  I know how much my friends like to comment and well sorry but i do not like the way some people go on so i took the comments away so now someone  who likes to start shit will lose their life because all they do is post on blogs about people they do not even know so whatcha gonna do lol. Oh well i guess it will be a big adjustment for a certain loser Tracy not Tracy S and we know thats just a pure sin for you gearbox lol.  But i guess i can still get comments from my friends just email them to me so i can still get your feedback ok. I am currently working on a website that will be password authenticated so just my friends can go in there, once it is done i will email all my friends thier usernames and passwords and yes Heather you too if you want ok. But for now thats all i got to type about might be back later with some more posts so STAY FROSTIE!

      I put the comment section back in so i can atleast talk to my friends through comments anyways. But i am having a great week Tara and I are getting along great. The kids are fine and all is good with them so right there is a stroke of luck but Tara's parents are gone on a caribbiean cruse so thats all good and stuff. Kevin especially needed the break so yeah i am happy for them they needed the time away so hope they have fun. Meanwhile Alex really misses his poppie and nan so he is having a hard time with it all so i hope that he can take it they will be home soon and will probably have something for him and that will make the whole wait even better for him.  Today Tara and I took the kids along with my godson Mason to Sydney and did some shopping and some other things, we went to dinner and then Alex wanted to go to Masons and play so we took him there for a while today. I also had to put Alex's Bey Blade together for him man was he excited to get that thing, it was alot of fun to put together and i mean that sarcasticly lol. But the kids had fun so thats the main thing.  But i did add the comments back in and  i hope that my friends will use them because of add the trash that was put here buy some person i do not even know or wanna know. Its a shame that thats all a person has to do in life makes you wonder about them lol. But anyways to all my frinds that do read this blog the comments are for you and you only any others if they are rude and impolite i will remove them. So have a  Great Day  and  STAY FROSTIE!

      Hey there people whats going on? Its me Its me its BDC. just writing to because i am bored i just dropped Alex off at school and the kids are in bed and Tara and i are here updating our blogs together how romantic aye lol. We are here carrying on and having some fun i am having a great day here and all is good. Da is feeling great and i am happy that he is out in the garage and doing what he wants to do and that is out in the garage fixing cars and he looks great. Ma is fine too she is on calcium suppliments and a weekly calcium pill that is pure calcium but other than that mom is great too.  Yesterday was a funny day Alicia my neice who i  love to death  Locked my keys in the trunk of my car and it is the only set. So i went out and took the back seet out and got Alex to climb into the trunk because he is small and i thought he would be able to see them and take them out for me. But what I did not know Alicia laid the keys on the lip where the trunk sits so we could not get them from the inside either so we had to get the trunk open. So big old me had to get in the trunk from the back seat that was  fun but i managed and i took a screwdriver and poped the trunk open then we got the keys whew!.  What a day that was but i guess Alicia thought i was mad at her but i am not why would i be it was an accident i know that. So LeeBee if you are reading this by any chance i am not mad and i still loves you bunches and bunches ok. But i guess thats enough for now got to go get Alex at school soon so   STAY FROSTIE!

      hey all i am feeling ok today but i am just sitting here typing and wondering what the hell is wrong with me i do not feel right. I do not know what is going on i was always one for never being home but now i all i do is sit around and do nothing and to be honest i just cannot get myself in the mood to go out and do things i am just all messed up i think. I do not want to go anywhere or even do anything sometimes i am lucky if i feel like getting out of bed somedays. If it wasn't for Tara i think i will be in bed all day if she wasn't important to me i think i would just stay in bed and not even get out of my room. I have a doctors appointment October 23rd and i am going to see if it is some sort of depression that i am suffering from i am told it could be a fit of depression. But i will mention it to the doctor and see what he has to say i am beginning to think so because i have alot of the simptums and it all started not too long after i lost my job. But all i can do is wait and i am never truly had a happy day there was times i just felt happy but it never was like it used to be for me i just do not know what is wrong but i guess all will come out with the visit to my doctors office the 23rd and i do hope that he can tell me what is going on in this head of mine. I find lately nothing matters to me and this has been since the beginning of the summer so its a long time comming for this doctors visit he does not even have me on the computer system at his office i am there that much but i hope to get to the bottom of this soon and get on with my life.  I know i have alot of things that i should be happy for but i am  not all that happy  i meani am happy i have Tara in my life and her kids but like i said before i never had a day where i was truely happy i mean i felt happy but it was like a wall because deep down inside i knew i was not happy and just for the record it is not Tara she is the one thing that makes me feel happy everytime i see her face i feel happy when she says  " Hi Hunny  i get a good feeling in my heart but other than that and a few other things i am depressed and as far as i know for nothing i cannot really tell you why because i do not know why. But enought with the pitty party sorry people just needed to get this out ok and  STAY FROSTIE!

      Yay it me again and man what a day i have had today, Did you ever have a day that was good but then all of a sudden it turns around and goes completely bad? Well i had one of those days today and man it was not too fun. First i head out and take my car to Dayton tire to get the front tires and the alignment done so that was done and i headed out to get Tara and the kids at Cheryls place and  all of asudden what do i see a spot check so i turn around and decide to go home and wait till they are done and then go get Tara and the kids. But i get to reserve just past the old airport road and look at that another one so i stopped and decided to go through the woods to get to mas but i fallow the dirt road and i come to a dead end so i decide to head back and take my chances with the spot check untill i see a road i missed. So i follow that and end up on sunnyside and i go home and i did not have Cheryls number so i needed to wait untill the spotchecks were done for the day. So i waited about 2 hours and i went and got Tara and the kids.  I just hate when a day goes sour right in the middle but hey what can i do its one of those pre-determinded things that you have no choice but too go with it.But until next time  STAY FROSTIE!

      hey all me again with a really shitty day but nothing happened to me to make the day so crappy but as you can guess i am in a mood. I just cannot tell what is wrong i feel like the whole world is  against me  and i do not know what to do so here i am blogging it all out for others to read but hey here i am. I got up today and just knew it was going to be a bad day for me and i knew it wasn't going to change i am sitting around all day just being blah i am here. I hate feeling like this sometimes i know it sounds stupid but i wanna die and it scares me i feel like i am not loved or appriciated and it hurts but i know deep down that i am.  I know i have probably no reason to feel like this but its like always there hiding in the dark recesses of my mind somewhere waiting for me to let my guard down so it can appear and take over and beleive me i have tried to do alot of things to get out of this state of mind but it seems lately the more i try the worse it gets. I am so depressed and i do not know why i just am and everyone around me is suffering for it all i want is to be left alone sometimes and be with me and actually i never do that i never have me time and its all my fault i just have to figureout what is going on in this head of mine before i loose it and go postal i just do not know where to turn. I know i can talk to Tara but everything will end up being her fault and really it is not but if i talk to her she takes it that way and i do not need to deal with that right now. I feel like even though there is all kinds of people around me i am still on some deserted island all by myself with no one who understands me and to be honest i do not know one person who does understand me or the thoughts going through this head of mine but i have to snap out of this soon or go get some help some things i think of just plain old scare the fuck out of me.  I know no one wants to read all this shit i am typing but  sorry  my blogis the only thing i can tell that does not try to analize or judge me for what i write or say. So sorry for all of you who read this but its just me shooting off and getting some shit off my chest .Its like you are in a room and it is spinnung and there are people outside the room with noway in and they cannot help me i am all alone on this and this is the choice i have amd and its on that i think is the best and besides there is no reason to get others involved in my fucked up head its my problem and i will deal with it the best i can and all i can say is to my friends and Tara is that it has nothing to do with you its a problem i have had for about a year and it is getting worse so leave me with it and i will get to the bottom of it some way or another.  So ahead of time if i have ignored or even been somewhat hean to any of my friends and especilly Tara Lee i am genuinely sorry but its the state i am in so i appologize ahead of time for anything i might do or say. If you read this please  do not   ask me about it. I will do this on my own so  STAY FROSTIE!

      Today was a bad day for my family and i. Dad had not brrn feeling good so he got Pauline to take him to New Waterford hospital to get checked to see what was wrong. So he got there and when he went to triage his bloodpressure was through the roof and he was taken right away. So they did some tests and chest x-rays and found he had a pile of fluid around his heart and he had went into cogestive heart failure.  Well i get up and did not know anything was wrong until the phone rang and who was it Pauline and i was the one who answered and well she tells me and of course out i go in the car and off to the hospital and i took derrick over too. We got there and they were waiting to get the injection to get the fluid off his heart and they gave him that and after waiting to see how much fluid he passed they let him go home but he has to go see Dr o brien tuesday to get this figured out and decide what is going to be done about it. I think that he will be ok even though his heart was 4x the regular size all they will give him is fluid pills to keep the fluid from building up again. But thats all for now so  STAY FROSTIE!

       Well here i am did not mean to take so long with this post but i have been rather occupied the last while back but let me tell you it was not a gooder time for me. As i wrote before i think that i my have some problems that i need to straighten up well they got alot worse i take them out on people that i really should not. I have flipped on everyone in my life and treated them like shit to put i nicely and to be honest i really have no reason to do that. None of these people done anything to me but still i lash out at them and say really mean and unsensitive things. I hope that they can forgive me for whatever i may say or do its almost time for my appointment and i will get this fixed or at least get the ball rolling on finding a solution.    But on somewhat of a good note Da is fine but he has to be more careful now then ever before. There is no more that they can do for him either medical or with an operation so he has to do exactly what the doctors say or well god forbid he will be gone. But as of right now he is fine i think with the exception of some really stupid things he does but hey who can tell him different. But just glad to have him around and we can thank Dr Roach of the New Waterford Hospital for noticing on the x-rays because they would never have cought it unless he decided to check das heart to because of past heart issues da has had. So everything is getting back to normal i guess except for me but hey life is gooder for the moment. But i guess thats it for now so  STAY FROSTIE!

      Hey all just poped in for a quick post. The last few days have been great and i have been able to get some work done on dads house and get most of the siding up. I just hope we do not get the rain we were supposed to get because that means a three day delay on the completion but what can you do cannot fight mother nature i am just so happy for Dad he has been waiting to get this done for quiet a while and i am just happy that Derrick and i could get together and get this project done. It is worth it to see the look in Das eyes and to see how happy it makes him.  We have had a few good days to get this work done and for this i am thankful. But on to even gooder news Angies daughter Bailie loves preschool and thinks that she should go everyday she absolutely loves it there and to be honest thank god because we all know how Angie was with school. But i am happy for Bailie it is great and i hope she can keep it up. Logan on the other hand Taras two year old has finally taken the step to not needing a diaper he has gone now three days without a diaper so that is also great news and i am proud of him. Emalee is walking with the help of her toy walker she can go anywhere as long as she has that to hold on too and i seen here with my own eyes walking down the road with it and i am just glad to be there to see that. It is hard to beleive how big she has gotten since i have gotten with Tara and man it doesn't take long before they grow up. Where does all that time go but hey its great to see all Tara's kids growing up and doing there own individual things its rather shocking as they develope right in front of you.   But i guess thats all for now people i gotta go so untill next time  STAY FROSTIE!

      Hey people as you can tell i am sorta glad that i had an ok day today ah well great but anyways. I do not have alot to talk about but i will try to make due with what little did go on here the last few days. Well i got all excited the other day i got a call from Stream but it wasn't for what i though it was for remember a while back i put a post in about the rehire form i had to go down and sign. Yeah i think you do but this call only discouraged me, ok here is how this call went down i had gotten a call from Edmond Hart from the Human Resources in the Stream building notifying me that the rehire form i put in a few months ago got lost somehow and i needed to come down and sign another one well i was rather disappointed.  But i went down and signed another one and Edmond is going to get ahold of Catherine Ashton to see if she can sign it as soon as possible and see if he can get me back there and to be honest i cannot wait to go back i just loved it there it was the best job i had ever had and to make it a little bit more hard on the head my pogey will be running out soon so i really need this job. But i could go somewhere else but i cannot imagine working anywhere else but at Stream/Solectron i really loved the job and the fact that i was helping the people not bothering them like i did at ICT yes i was an annoying telemarketer and even though i was good at it i always hated bothering those people everyday of the week.  So when i got on at Stream the first time i loved it these people that i once would drive tottally insane actually liked me and thanked me for helping them fix the issues they were having at first it blew my mind to think that all the people that i have pissed off as a telemarketer and all the people that told me to burn in hell, fuck off asshole and other beautiful things like that were actually thanking me well i almost lost it i was at least waiting to get flipped on for something but no never really happened all that much. But i think the main reason why i loved the job so much was the fact that it was learning about computers and software and that is one thing i love to do is work on and fix puters. this opened a new window for me to get some real experience in the field of tech support and computer issues so that is another thing i am thankful for.  Now i just cannot wait to go back and start fresh and new in the job that i liked oh so much but i guess thats all for now but i will keep you posted on this and remember   STAY FROSTIE!

      Hey all hope everyone is fine sorry that it has been a long time for me to put in another post but i have been a little busy as of late. Lets see here where to start, Well we got the siding all put up on my dads house and you would not beleive how good the place looks now it is quite the change from what it used to look like. I have also got my problem with depression under wraps i am on an antidepressent and it should start to kick in after it gets in my system so thats a gooder thing. And halloween is upon us and Tara's kids are all excited to be heading out trick or treating so thats shouls be some fun and there is going to be fireworks for them too so they should have a gooder time. Da has gotten his test to see how much damage was done to his heart and to see how much blood it is pumping in a minute so we are all waiting for the results.  Still have gotten no sign of getting a call back to solectron yet but i am hopefull for it but i am not going to worry about that it will only drive me nuts and that i do not need right now. I bought another car i got it for parts and to be hinest its the best thing that i could have done because da is weird when it comes to his parts its like he does not want to part with them. but i gues who can blaim him for that you never know when you might need one lol. But other than a few things thats all right now for any new events in this totally exciting life i got here lol. but i will try to make as many posts as i can and not neglect this blog of mine. So   STAY FROSTIE!

      Hey all its me i made a stop here on my way to insanity. Lets see what i can say in this exciting episode of My Blog. Well as you can see i have not been here in some time but that can be explained by a few things. I am not myself lately i have some issues i have to get over before i can get straightened out and get my life back on track i just have no idea on how to fix these problems i have right now but i am getting some help and i hope to get to the bottom of this. The only way that i can explain it is that you are in a hole too deep to jump out of so you start to climb the walls and at about half way up the wall breaks into pieces and you fall into the abyss once more and everytime you try to climb the same thing happens and each particle of dirt sticks to you and its just adding weight for the next time you attempt to climb. All the people around you think that its so easy to just get up out of this hole and get back to life they do not understand what kind of things are going on in you head that you just cannot control it sounds so easy when they say it and all you can say is that you think its easy you be me and try it. They just either turned super dumb or when i explain it they cannot grasp the concept at all and still try to be doctor and they do not understand the issue at all and that is what drives me Krazee.  But i guess thats enough for now i donot want to bore you all to death lol take it easy and well  STAY FROSTY!

      Hey all i know its been a long time since i posted but its been a very hard couple of months for me and i have gotten my appointment with my shrink. But its still the same old thing for me everything is still fucked up and i get in the worse fits of depression that get worse by every day sometimes its so fucked and it is discouraging but what can i do about it i am trying to fix my mind but its just so messed up to sort through it but i guess it will take me some time before it gets any better in this fucked up head of mine but hey only time will tell what will become of it.  Well its dec 22 and the time for good old Santa Claus is comming yay, i guess its the time of year for gooder cheer and gooder will towards men but to be honest i have absolutely no holiday spirit i think its dead now when you grow up you lose all the excitment of the holiday season. All it is to me is one huge money racket and just another day for this guy i do not see what the big deal is about this whole christmas thing but anyway enough about that.  So here i am in one of my fits but what else can i do with this life its all the same for me. The only thing is that i have my family and friends that stand by me no matter what and to tell you all the truth i do not know why these people put up with me they have every right to be angry with me i trat them badly at times. But i am glad that they are here for me to talk to even though the way i treat them. I have  had some gooder days and some really bad ones as does everyone but with me i get a feeling  that is almost like a helpless one but there is no reason to have these feelings but i cannot stop it no matter how hard i try but i will keep trying untill i beat this thing and i hope it is sooner more than later. But i guess thats all for now so later and  STAY FROSTIE!

      Hey to all my friends yes it is me so sorry that its has been a while since my last post but just to let everyone know that i am doing gooder and that  i am feeling pretty good about me today anyways. So i guess this is good. I am going to be a daddy and dispite what some individuals may say i am going to be there for my baby. I am happy about it and to be honest i like the idea of being a dad. But i am glad that there are people out there that like to bash me but hey thats cool at least i give these people something to do with their lives anyways ha ha ha. Its really a shame when someone has to bash blogs just so thry can have a life of their own. As for me turning on Tara and the kids well  all i can say that me and Tara do not get along so why drag the kids through all that and end up hurting them because we cannot get along. Me myself, i think that that would do more damage to them than it would do good. But as for my baby its just that well its mine and i do have the responsibility to the baby and Tara to look after my end and for those of you that think otherwise ask Tara how she feels about it and she will tell you. The last thing i need to say about this subject is THE BABY IS MINE AND I WILL DO MY PART AND TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY ACTIONS.  But i do not need to tell all you people i just needed to tell Tara that so there i did. but anyways i guess thats it for now i gotta go do the shoveling thing so later people and  STAY FROSTY!

      Hey all how is everyone out there in blogger land i am feeling pretty good tonight and i am just sitting here watching my fav show Orange County Chopper. lets see whats new here in the joyous life of Pike Mullins well i still am unemployed but hey thats cool i will have a job soon and as most already know i have a baby on the way and i am going to try to be the best father to that baby that i can.   My best friend Dave got a girlfriend so thats cool i just hope that he does not forget about his bros because girlfriends come and go but friends are for life. But i know he has alot to do like work, the truck, and his woman i9 just hope he has time for his friends because we have been buds now for about ten to twelve years and a friend like him only comes around once in a lifetime. Dave is also going to be the Godfather of the baby and my sister Pauline is going to be the godmother so thats all cool. But i really don't have much to type here but i am excited about being a daddy and to be honest i never thought i would see the day. But i guess thats it for now so remember  STAY FROSTIE!

      Hey all whats up? not too bad here well except for all this fucking snow and man when is this shit going to end. I hate the winter especally if it drags out like this one i got some work to do on my car and on my dads car. So all this snow is just impeeding my progress i cannot even get out in the garage and for those of you who know me besides computers my other passion is Working on cars. The worst thing is i want to work on the cars but i can't and man does it piss me off. But theres nothing i can do about it so no point in shooting off about it.  But thats all for about that i am sitting here typing away about nothing and well thats usually how this blog goes but i will be at work soon i hope so i can get some stuff for the baby and get a head start on all that is going to be needed. Which will work out to be better than just waiting till the baby is born but i am excited about the thought of being a dad. I always said that i wanted a baby and i find it hard to beleave that i am going to be a daddy it so weird but its cool.  But anyway people thats all that i got for you to read about the great life i have but hey thats all for now so take care of yourself and each other.  STAY FROSTIE!

       Hey all whats new in the blog surfing world ? well i have had alot to talk about so i hope you are in for a fair sized post on behalf of Me (Big Daddy Cool).   Well i guess the first topic would be on my Dad who if you guys can remember we had a scare there last year with the old fella. But he pulled through and now i find out that my dad is getting worse with fluid build up and according to what i am told there is nothing much more that can be done for my Dad. I just hope that he can some how fight through this and live for some time to come but due to his weight he is limiting his time with us and that is the scary thing to me because it has only been the last few years that my father and i have had a chance to actually get close and get to know each other. So i hope he is around for a long time to come and we did not tell him what his condition is because we do not want to get him excited or upset because that can hurt him aswell.  Tara and me are back together and things are going well and she is due to have the baby in september on the 25th. Its weird i am excited and scared all at the same time. I do not know what to expect or what to do its funny Tara laughs at me all the time if the baby is a boy His name will be Brett Pius Joseph Cheetham and if the baby is a girl her name will be Isabella Elisa Grace Cheetham man i hope i got this right if i didn't Tara will let me know so might as well giver.   Alex Tara's oldest has graduated from Pre-school and so did my niece Bailey and man they were some pretty cool kids for the people that were there so hats off to you guys see ya in school this year. Man i wish they knew what they were getting into lol. My neice Wendy who moved up to New Brunswick with her boyfriend Brian just had a baby girl her name is Kristen Marie and she is cute as far as i can tell from the pictures lol no actually she is beautiful. I cannot wait to see the little baby but i feel old i am a great uncle already at the age of 25 soon to be 26 oh my gawd where did the time go lol.  I guess as you guys can tell i am out of the state of depression and i am happy for a change well sometimes lol but hey one day at a time and its working my next thing will be to quit smoking which i am reallly beginning to hate because it is dirty habbit. But untill then i am working to fix my car and das aswell so i do have alot more to do lol i will never complain again lol its just not worth it lol it always comes back to kick you in the ass. I guess i have to live with it for now cannot change it now lol no matter how hard i try so just gotta bear down and just do it.  But i think thats it for now as far as i can remember at this time but i will be back posting any new happenings or happenstances that my arise so untill next time bloggerland   STAY FROSTIE!
