      Billy's football practice went well. He had a blast. They got to practice with footballs today. He loved that. He kept getting in trouble for not paying attention and was made to run laps around the baseball feild. By the time practice over he had done 6 laps and was enjoying it. He thought it was funny to have to do the laps. He has practice again tomorrow which will be fun. Well I am going to hit the sack. I have alot to do tomorrow. Bye for now.

      I am getting a little closer to figuring this out. I finally got this in my web site as a link. After each post you can add a comment if anyone likes. I am going to figure out how to work the chat room and that should be working correctly soon too.  We took Billy and signed him up for PeeWee football last night. They only did drills so far. His team name is Southside Jaguars. He had a blast at practice last night. He can't wait to go back again. He will have practice 4 times a week until school starts then it will be 3 times a week. And every Sat. morning he has a game starting Sept. 4th. I will post some pictures on the web site as soon as i can. Love you all. Bye for now.

      We got the kids a chinchilla last night. She is addorable and the kids love her. Michelle named her strawberry shortcake. But I think that will end up changing later. Not sure.  I will put a picture of her on the web site later.  Today we are going to Harriet's for her son's birthday. He  one now. Austin and his kids are going to be there. I think Uncle Barry and Aunt Ginger will be there and Grandpa and Aunt Rossetta. Not sure who else will be there. It should be fun. Well gotta get going so I can find a gift for him and get me and the kids ready to go. Until next time.

      Didn't do much this weekend. Will had this weekend off. First one in a while. We just spent the time to gether. We went sunday to Jim and Luann's for dinner. We had a good time. Other than that we didn't do much of anything but sit around the house.

      Will's mom made it thru the hurricane with little damage. They only had some tree limbs down and half their shingles blow off the roof. Other than that everything else is fine. The River didn't even get high enough to flood the house just the yard. The river was at low tide when the surge came in. They are still without power. A majority of the stores is closed or they are out of everything. We are just happy they made it safe. I will keep you all updated on how they are doing as we hear anything.

      The kids started school today. After I dropped them off i ran a few errons and when I got home I had nothing to do. No kids to chase around or fuss at. I didn't know what to do with myself. I have been so bored. It feels weird not having to chase a child around. Wahoo party time. LOL. Oh well. I will post later and tell ya all how the kids did in school. Until then...
