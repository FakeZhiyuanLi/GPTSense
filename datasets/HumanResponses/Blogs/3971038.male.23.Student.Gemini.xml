      Thank god its finally over... BUt, it was not a good experience... I admitted myse;f to my own hospital, my own ward which i work. I was so touched that my colleagues actually booked a single room for me... hehehe.... I tried to make everybody's life easier by doing my own stuff like admissions, took my own BP.. almost everything, basically was like a staff nurse in charge of myself.  Was kinda bored coz i came alone.. but then i hang out with my colleagues and help out with the so called "backstage" work. Seriously I was very nervous... Then abt 4pm, Shah came.. yeah Shah the air steward guy... yeah the one who frantically tried to stop me from getting into Arse's hungry stomach... but Arse ate me anyway... He brought his GF along.. shall not discuss that, Nas will get really super angry if he noes,&nbsp; doesnt like me to talk abt shah's gf that much. He brought me apples and longans???? which obviously i wont consume so i "donated" it to my colleagues outside... they were pretty happy.  I basically ate and slept..  NExt morning was the operation. I went down to OT at 12pm.. it felt weird, totally weird that i was pushed on the trolley... ok i had to agree with my pateints that yeah.. it was irritating when they started asking me abt my particulars... coz they kept asking and asking again.. Went from induction to anaesthesia area... met this anesthetist... DR Lee Pang.. eyah... i looked at his name tag.... coz HE'S DAMN GOOD LOOKING!!!! He helped me to get my Ot gown sleeve off.... OH MY GOD!!! kwakakakaka...... haha... no lah hes just trying to set my plug and the sleeve was in the way.Next i saw my surgeon... Uncle Chan Yew Meng..... yeah i picked him to do my tonsils. The nurse gave me anaesthesia... and it all came back.  When I did my squint eyes when i was about 4 years old... they tried so hard to get me to go to sleep. I remember there was this malay male staff nurse... said " adik, put on the mask brethe in and out... just think ur with the care bears floating ard".... AND I DID THOUGHT OF THE CARE BEARS!!! So when I was in the OT yesterday I remembered the whole scene again.. and yes i thought of the care bears... and the next thing I knew it felt like in the matter of minutes... " Annisa, Operation over.." And I got difficulty in breathing and it felt like an asthma attack....so the missy gave me Ventolin:Atrovent:N/S Neb abt 5 minutes... felt so much better... i was more concern of the nause rather than the pain.... then i was sent back to the ward. Sister Chan picked me up.  and she wasnt of any help at all... I vomitted blood which smelles horrible... and i vomitted again... it was so traumatic... I hate puking and feeling dizzy... and best of all thats when i got lots of visitors. Nas, my sis, Arsyad, Juliana, Usha and my parents and uncle came... it was like.... i got a headache... tyhey left abt 9pm. so i went straight back to sleep... Karen and Santhi was on Night so they came and checked on me..  I woke up abt midnight. I felt so much better. I came out met sister Aziah. I ask Karen to remove my drip... and i went back to sleep.. I was so giddy still...  and im giddy now... going to lie down cont tomoro morning.... and my mouth hurts... i cant yawn!!! damn!!!

       Good morning!!!!!! Its Wed morning today and my parents are still not back.,.. OH MY GOD!!!!   Anyway.... tomoro going for op... its a small no big deal actually but then.... its my 2nd operation in my entire life!!!   Im listening to Vernetta Lopez Lunch break on Class 95... Songs are cool and overwhelming too...   It was a nice morning... was doing the dishes... chatting with my pals on MSN, and i put the radio on blast.... woke my cats up for breakfast and was ready to do housework... when Vernetta said... " NExt on Number 3".... then it is it!!! That was it... total spoiler and ruin everything!!!!! *sob* *sob*    And then it came.... " Make a wish... I can dream" ....     &nbsp;  Actually Im very pissed with Arse yesterday night. He wanted a job in the health sector.. and i tried my bloody very best to get the no for him AS A FAVOUR OF A FRIEND.... but then he didnt get back to me.... and when i ask he said he lost the number and ask me to give the number again.... BULL SHIT...... i made an effort and he took it for granted... rest assured..... good luck pal....    &nbsp;  Like the malays would say... " nak kena trembak dengan senapang gajah".

      Its 1615hrs now and i just finish whatever Im suppose to do... Kinda bored today... Woke up late do lots of cleaning... still gotta clean my room.. sigh... my cats have satisfied tummies and napping right now.. &nbsp; Listening to Elton John's Im still standing right now...  &nbsp; Having this blog made me realise how computer illiterate I am... and best of all I dont borther.. Never really a computer person.. &nbsp; Life with straight hair has never been better.... It will be a long time before i turn back to curls again... and the thing is that i miss combing my hair. &nbsp; Chatted with Sufian today... talking to him make me miss school alot and Yishun. I feel that Yishun was more of a home to me, eg, went to watch movie yesterday with Nas.. Whole Ten Yards... yeah totally in love with Mr Matthew Perry... I walk ard Yishun saw lots of familiar faces and it was more like " balik kampong" u noe,.... But whatever it is its not home anymore. Life has to go on... &nbsp; Actually Im very nervous about going for op this Friday....

      You could never know what it's like Your blood like winter freezes just like ice And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use And did you think this fool could never win Well look at me, I'm coming back againI got a taste of love in a simple way And if you need to know while I'm still standing you just fade away &nbsp; Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid I'm still standing after all this time Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah &nbsp; Once I never could hope to win You starting down the road leaving me again The threats you made were meant to cut me down And if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now

      You picked me up suddenly along the street... I was scared, nervous and guilty... My heart beats really fast and i broke into cold sweat.... Didnt know where my journey with you will start... Or when it will end...  I couragely went to the beach on our first date... It was quiet, scenic, beautiful.... It felt like Ive known you for years.... I had full trust in you not to let my world come tumbling down...  You had your big strong hands around my thick waist.. It felt so ticklishy good and the sense of security is undescribable... Then our lips met.... You took me in like a hungry wolf...  Our affair was nothing but high impact aerobics... I like you alot so very much and i got so much to offer, But the ego in me striked back.. But also, you didnt fight for me....  Then i realised you didnt like me for what I am... Using me just to fulfil your lost dreams... Its all absurd and can't imagine how dumb i became... Im a smart lass but with you i turned dumbstruck...  You sang for me Sunshine from Gabrielle..... And I'll think of u when it came blasting over the radio... It became a sad song.... Seriously literally I could cry....  I never cried for you.. I never cared for you For u never did vice versa....  I was so depressed and angry... Ran away to Thailand for a week.. Saw the buddhist deity, buried my sorrows in the earth of Bangkok... Every single minute i think abt you...  I searched for you when i came back... You're no where to be found.... The feeling of hate started to come out... and finally it all came out....  you had another partner....  I was so extremely depressed but manage to control my emotions... for we were not a couple... But somehow i felt cheated whatever it is life has to go on  i said goodbye on April 28th It all lated for 2 months... It was all sad.... I sobbed quietly in the bus journey back home...  Hey buddy, thanks for everything.... But its your lost.... u lost me... big mistake...  I got so much to offer and u cant see that... hey budd.. u lost me... Take care

      Made a wish, I can dream I can be what I want to be Not afraid to live my life And fulfil my fantasies  I learnt a lot of tricks to help me live my life You helped me find my paradise When you came I saw  Sunshine through my window That's what you are My shining star Sunshine Making me feel like I'm on top of the world Telling me I'll go far  Reaching out, for the highs You inspired me to try I felt the magic inside And I felt that I could fly I'm looking at the world in an optimistic light You made me appreciate my life 'Cos when you came you were my  Sunshine through my window That's what you are My shining star Sunshine Making me feel like I'm on top of the world Telling me I'll go far  You are the calm I am the storm You are the breeze that carries me on When I said a truth You wink at me You're there for me  Sunshine (oh yeah) That's what you are My shining star Sunshine Making me feel I'm on top of the world Telling me that I'll go far Sunshine through my window That's what you are My shining star  (Sunshine) Making me feel I'm on top of the world Telling me that I'll go far Sunshine through my window That's what you are My shining star Sunshine Making me feel I'm on top of the world Telling me that I'll go far Sunshine My star, my star..

      Seriously if i were another person i hate myself... seriously its not like " oh i cant forgive myself".. its literally i hate myself... i hate my stupid and absurd attitute, and im being honest.  I can see myself changing very slowly from a girl who stand up for herself and forgiving and patient to otherwise.  Firstly i became very negative about almost everything.. I judged people alot from first impressions and worst i stick to my opinions. I think badly abt other ppl and i have lots of comments.... of course i wouldnt say it out loud but still the thought is there... and i hate it....  Theres one girl in the ward where i work.. wont reveal names.. i seriously dont like the way she look.. i mean i dont like the way she dress and the way she carry herself.. i mean its like NONE OF MY BUSINESS... but still i kept myself away from her and til today i havent exchange greets or words.. it was merely as simple as " i know that u exist" then her bf's dad was my patient. and her bf and her were there... the bf kept asking me stupid questions which HELLO! U have a nurse gf!!!! and then i started not liking the guy just because i dont like the girl.... CRAP isnt it????? And i get very interested when others talk abt her... whtther good or bad remarks....  Next is my 5 month pregnant colleague.. Karen's the name. She is this bossy and dominering kind of person who would never admits to her own mistakes. I should give her the benefit of the doubt that shes pregnant and cranky.. but still i chose to take her remarks personally and then worse i complain abt her to others. and i didnt care if she got to know abt it.... coz everything is true.  I make fun of people and participate in trash talks abt them.... its totally lame of me..  Suddently i become this very negative person and very unlikable one too....and the jealous type... Why did i become like this... am i satisfied with whatever i have???  Im very sure this is not the person i would want to become and i promise i would pray and change myself for the better...  I want to be patient and caring and aproachable. i want to be satisfied with whatever i have and at the same time driven abt life and competitive with whatever im doing...

      Hmmm i was watching the bachelor the other day.... then when they had the clip of kelly jo ( the bachelorette that got dumped) i felt so sad.... seriously i tried so hard to relate my grieve then i got her..... yeah thats rite... you felt cheated and u noe that its gonna happen sooner or later and u forgot dates other ppl not only u.... u gave ur all and then the guy said sorry and leave with another gal leaving u so heart broken and helpless.... ppl judged her and she has to put up a brave front... thats exactly what happened to me.. except that i wasnt on tv.. im ready to move on but the scar still stays.. i got a low healing process.. either matters of the heart or literally..  seriously pal u know who u are and if ur reading this.... call me cruel and freaky.. but i would love to make ur life miserable... i think im entitled to do that and u deserve it.

      Gd morning.... What the hell am I doing awake??? Im thinking abt school...... To be precise: Im thinking of the times when Zaky tried to get me and this guy called Firly together when I was in Sec 4... it was damn funny.. thinking again... Seriously I forgot abt him totally til i bumped into him at wholivesnearyou.com. Nice to communicate with him again...  Right now listening to songs from 1997 and 1998... the Alanis Morrissette.... BSB, Macarena... I did that alot when i was in sec 3. hehehehe..... so embarrassed.... This morning I met Ang Siok Ching... now aka Crystal Ang.. hehe... while having breakfast with Nas at McDonalds in causeway point. Talked about good old times....  Right now listening to BSB All I have to give... What i remembered most of this was me, fauziah, juliah, haryana, haryani and shuyu at some bus stop outside kallang netball centre... at about 11pm... no ones ard... we sang this song.. its was a hit by the way at that time.... its very nostalgic... miss those times...

       I'm feeling like a pail full of water.. i do not know if you guys have any idea what i meant. Common Tests and exams are coming.. and there are about 2 modules which i am not confident of passing.. that is my Chemistry.. and Horticulture Enginerring which is about pressure measurements.. something a little like physics.. but more tougher.. more complicated.. haiz..  I just do not want history to repeat itself..  But i guess i'll just keep on trying huh?.. Let's just hope for the best..  Now i'm feeling the pressure.. projects due soon.. common tests, exams around the corner.. and i'm nowhere near..

       Well I know we just met yesterday Things be look so right  But you always know just what to say and what is on my mind  Girl I feel I need a special way to ask you to be mine, But I dont know when's the perfect day or what's the perfect time  Babe you, leave me confused, Dont know if I should l let you know or wait it out girl, Wish I knew Just what to do I'm so confused  [Chorus] So girl what you wanna see? Wanna see me get down on my knees? Wanna hear me begging baby please? Wanna see me crying for mercy Oh girl, I wish I knew your world I think Im losing my head over you girl  Every bone in my body says I want you tonight. Pretty little hunny, why you there by my side. With your Hale Berry face and you Beyonce thighs. With you Juxci want to collide  ? ? Bump all night long with you sexy little waist Come girl, come along, wanna make love to you from dusk til dawn  Well I know that it maybe too soon to know just what you'd like  But I wana know what you've been thru, what you want from life  Its so real the way I feel so true, this feelings so hard to fight  Wana now how you feel for me too, So you can become of mine  Babe you, leave me confused, Dont know if I should l let you know or wait it out girl, Wish I knew Just what to do Im so confused  [Repeat Chorus]  Well someone once told me that you'd end up lonely Dont let love ever pass you by Coz I've seen it happen to people that mattered to me with my very own eyes Maybe they were mistaken And I should be waiting, for you to show me a sign Or should I just let you know that if I let you go, Id wonder the rest of my life  [Repeat Chorus]  To be or not to be, that is the question I dont know what to do Im in a state of confusion All I want from you is your love and affection Is this love real or just an illusion?  [Repeat Chorus x 2]

        Through the clouds. A nice surprise. To see that twinkle returing to your eyes.    I've searched my head. For some old spark. We fell around this place. Stumbling in the dark.    And when I feel the skies will never clear. You remind me spring is near.    How you sparkle. How you shine. How you rise above the sky. And you rise, and you rise....    Through the crowd. I catch your eye. Takes me back again. When we were getting high.    I've searched my head. For some old spark. Fell around this place. Fumbling in the dark.    And when I feel the skies will never clear. You remind me spring is near.    How you sparkle. How you shine. How you rise above the sky. And you rise, and you rise.     Nothing in this world. could make me love you less. Shadows often leave perfection in a mess.    Oh my love, Oh my LordOh my love, Oh my Lord..    How you sparkle. How you shine. How you rise above the sky.    How you sparkle. How you shine. How you rise above the sky. And you rise, And you rise...

       Your class starts at 8.00 am. The time shows 8.13am. You&nbsp;promised your friend to meet at the busstop and then go to class together. You are at the busstop and your friend is late. Would you forget about him and go to class first? Or would you wait for your friend till he/she arrives and risk the chance of being marked as absent for your class. What would you do?....

         urlLink  Cynthia Ettinger    was originally cast as Martha Kent in the pilot episode. Before the pilot was broadcast, the role was re-cast with Annette O'Toole and her scenes were edited into the existing footage. A sequence showing Lex Luthor as Preasident of the United States was filmed on the set of   urlLink  "West Wing, The" (1999)   .     Annette O'Toole, who plays Mrs. Kent, also appeared in   urlLink  Superman III (1983)    as Lana Lang.     The pilot episode shows Chloe handing Pete Ross a wad of cash. Most likely an in-joke from the Canadian production crew, if you look carefully, you can see a Canadian $5 bill sticking out of it.     At the beginning of the episode "Nicodemus", Jonathan Kent is listening to the theme song from   urlLink  "Dukes of Hazzard, The" (1979)   . John Schneider, who plays Mr. Kent, also played Bo Duke.     In the episode "Delete", Clark's parents' email address is CNH320@instamail.org. CHN 320 was the license plate on the General Lee on "The Dukes of Hazzard".     Clark consistently wears red and/or blue clothing, the same livery he will eventually wear as Superman.     Contains frequent in-joke references to the Superman mythos in various episodes.     The climax of first season episode "Stray" (episode #16) was shot on location in a bowling alley in Richmond, BC, Canada. Coincidentally, the bowling alley in question is named "Lois Lanes", also the name of Clark Kent's future love interest.     Chloe and Whitney were created specifically for the show (they were never mentioned in the Superman comics). However, in 2003, DC Comics announced that Chloe would be introduced into the Superman comics.     The episode "Redux" was filmed after the first season finale, "Tempest", but aired later in season two. Some lines were dubbed in indicating its placement later in season two (such as Lana discussing Clark's secretiveness and Martha working for Lionel Luthor) though those episodes had yet to be filmed.     Chloe sometimes mentions her college-age cousin who is also interested in journalism; more recent episodes have seen Chloe identify this cousin as Lois Lane.     urlLink  Remy Zero   , who performs the theme song "Save Me" make a cameo appearance as the band playing at Smallville High's spring formal, lip-synching the hit song in episode #21: "Tempest".     In the pilot a newspaper is shown with a headline about "Queen Industries" which in the D.C. Comics is owned by Oliver Queen, a.k.a. the Green Arrow.     Based on DC Comics characters.     In the pilot episode, the "villain" is loosely based on the DC Comics villain Conduit.     In the episode "Zero", there are references to Central City and Bludhaven which are home to DC Comics super heroes The Flash and Nightwing respectively.     In the episode, "Redux" there is a reference made to Coast City which was the one-time home of DC Comics super-hero Green Lantern.     In the episode, "Ryan" there is a reference to Hub City which is the home of DC Comics super hero The Question.     In the episode "Metamorphis" Jonathan tells Clark that he "was meant for much greater things then winning football games". Jonathan says the same thing to Clark in   urlLink  Superman (1978)   . In an incredible coincidence, the episode "Perry", which dealt with a large solar flare affecting Clark's powers, first aired in the US on the same day that the largest solar flair in over 100 years struck the Earth, 29 October 2003.     All episodes have one-word titles.     To coincide with the release of the CD "In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988-2003" on 28 October 2003, the third season episode "Slumber" included only songs by   urlLink  R.E.M.   . The album is released on Warner Brothers, the same company that produces this show.     The sound effect used for the sound of Kryptonite radiating is the same as the one used in   urlLink  "Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman" (1993)   .     In the episode "Asylum", there is a newspaper headline about the Themisciran Queen, a reference to Wonder Woman's mother, Queen Hippolyta.     In the episode "Rosetta" the musical score for Dr. Virgil Swann is "The Fortress of Solitude" and "Main Theme" from Superman (1978), originally composed by John Williams.     Lex Luther's mansion is the same mansion used in   urlLink  X-Men (2000)      According to Martha, Clark's first word was "Lara", the name of his Kryptonian Biological mother as revealed in "Memoria".     There are numerous references to a m  ental asylum called Belle Reve. In the DC Comics' stories, Belle Reve was the name for a high security prison for supervillains which was also secretly the headquarters for a covert operations unit that used cooperative inmates nicknamed The Suicide Squad.     In "Drone" it is revealed that Sasha got her ability to control Bees after falling in Shuster Gorge. Joe Shuster along with Jerry Siegal created Superman.     At the charity party the end of "Fever" Pete hands Clark a CD and tells him it's the Talon mix. If you look closely you'll see that it is actually the soundtrack to the series.     In "Ryan", Lex shows Ryan his "Warrior Angel" Collection. The cover to "Fantasy Comics-Warrior Angel" #1 is a nod to the cover of DC's "Action Comics" #1 in which Superman made his first appearance.     In "Rosetta",   urlLink  Christopher Reeve   's character's name, "Dr. Swann", is a reference to the Superman artist of the '70s and '80s, Curt Swann.     In "Rosetta", the scenes with Dr. Swann were shot on the set of   urlLink  "Third Watch" (1999)   .

       One day this guy, who's been stranded all alone on a deserted island for 10 years, is sitting out on the beach when a beautiful woman wearing a wet suit and scuba gear suddenly emerges from the surf.  She approaches the stunned guy and asks, "How long has it been since you've had a cigarette?"  "Ten years!" he says.  She unzips a waterproof pocket and pulls out a fresh pack of cigarettes.  He takes one, lights it, takes a long drag and says, "Oh, that's good!"  Then the woman asks, "How long has it been since you've had a drink?"  Trembling, the man says, "Ten long years!"  The woman unzips her waterproof pocket on her left sleeve, pulls out a flask and gives it to him.  The man takes a long swig and says, "Man, that's sweet!"  The woman then starts slowly unzipping the front of her wet suit, looks at him seductively and asks, "And how long has it been since you've played around?"  The man, with tears in his eyes, replies, "Oh sweet mother of God! Don't tell me you've got golf clubs in there!"

       Little Johnnie sees his Daddy's car passing the play-ground and go into the woods. Curious, he follows the car and sees Daddy and Aunt Jane in a 'Passionate Embrace'. Johnnie finds this so exciting and can barely contain himself as he runs home and starts to tell his mother excitedly."I was at the playground and I saw Daddy's car go into the woods with Aunt Jane. I went back to look and he was giving Aunt Jane a big kiss, then he helped her take off her shirt, then Aunt Jane helped Daddy take his pants off, then Aunt Jane layed down on the seat, then Daddy.."At this point, Mommy cut him off and said, "Johnnie, this is such an interesting story. Suppose you save the rest of it for suppertime. I want to see the look on Daddy's face when you tell it tonight." At the dinner table, Mommy asks Johnnie to tell his story, so Johnnie starts his story, describing the car into the woods, the undressing, laying down on the seat, and... "...then Daddy and Aunt Jane did that same thing Mommy and Uncle Bill used to do when Daddy was in the army."

       After a long night of passionate lovemaking, this guy rolls over &amp; was looking around when he noticed a framed picture of another man on the night stand by the bed. Naturally, the guy began to worry. "Is this your husband?" he inquired nervously. "No, honey," she replied, snuggling up to him. "Your boyfriend then?" he asked. "No, not at all handsome," she said, nibbling away at his ear. "Is it your dad or your brother?" he asked again, hoping to be reassured. "No, no, no!!!" she said. "Well, who is he then?" demanded the bewildered guy. Calmly, the girl replied, "That's me before the surgery."

       Did you hear about the fellow that was talking to his buddy, when he said, "I don't know what to get my wife for her birthday. She has everything, and besides, she can afford to buy anything she wants. So, I'm stumped." His buddy said, "I have an idea. Why don't you make up a certificate that says she can have two hours of great sex, any way she wants it. She'll probably be thrilled!" So the first fella did just that. The next day his buddy asked, "Well, did you take my suggestion? How did it turn out?" "She loved it. She jumped up, thanked me, kissed me on the mouth, and ran out the door yelling, 'I'll see you in two hours'."

       A girl asks her boyfriend to come over Friday night and have dinner with her parents. Since this is such a big event, the girl announces to her boyfriend that after dinner, she would like to go out and make love for the first time. Well, the boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex before, so he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get some condoms. The pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour. He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and sex. At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms he'd like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family pack. The boy insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and all. That night, the boy shows up at the girl's parents house and meets his girlfriend at the door. "Oh, I'm so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in!" The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the girl's parents are seated. The boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head. A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer, with his head down. 10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy. Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the girlfriend leans over and whispers to the boyfriend, "I had no idea you were this religious." The boy turns, and whispers back, "I had no idea your father was a pharmacist."

         Three men who were lost in the forest were captured by cannibals. The cannibal king told the prisoners that they could live if they pass a trial. The first step of the trial was to go to the forest and get ten pieces of the same kind of fruit. So all three men went separate ways to gather fruits.      The first one came back and said to the king, "I brought ten apples." The king then explained the trial to him. "You have to shove the fruits up your butt without any expression on your face or you'll be eaten." The first apple went in... but on the second one he winced out in pain, so he was killed.    The second one arrived and showed the king ten berries. When the king explained the trial to him he thought to himself that this should be easy. 1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8... and on the ninth berry he burst out in laughter and was killed.    The first guy and the second guy met in heaven. The first one asked, "Why did you laugh, you almost got away with it?" The second one replied, "I couldn't help it, I saw the third guy coming with pineapples."
