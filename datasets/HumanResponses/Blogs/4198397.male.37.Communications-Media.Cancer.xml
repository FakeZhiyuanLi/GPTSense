      KMart isn't the greatest.....but I'm sorry, Wal-Mart sucks.  I call it "Brawl-Mart", since you either have to bully around 1) other shoppers, or 2) large carts of to-be-shelved merchandise, only to complete your three-mile journey to just pick up a gallon of milk and a quart of oil, finding yourself in a long, long line to check-out.  32 registers....five open.  The others would be there for what reason??  In the matter of fairness, the trip to Wal-Mart today was better than normal, in that we had essentially no wait in line (and I saw something most people alive have not...a Wal-Mart cashier at her post WAITING for a customer to come into her line!)  Still, I consider 80 minutes in Wal-Mart to be....about 78 minutes too long.  I love you, Target.  But if you MUST go to Wal-Mart, go to the one in Ashland, Va, just off I-95.  We have one closer to our house, but that one is horrible so we travel a few minutes farther to Ashland.  It's the best of a bad lot....  I didn't do my live draft (was still in bed) so I need to go check out what players are on my fantasy team at Yahoo!.  In closing, a closed-circuit to-do list to myself which can double for your reading convenience as a list of things to come on this here blog....  ---Scruffy ---Obessessive-Compulsive Disorder ---Sleep Apnea ---Maybe, how it feels to walk with both arms dangling by my side... ---A tour of our new elementary school ---sex (just wanted to see if you were paying attention....) ---the all-important upcoming football season, including the NFL, POF (our fantasy league among family and friends), college, and high-school (where I begin my 3rd season as the play-by-play voice of my alma mater, Patrick Henry High School/Ashland, September 10th) ---energizing a church ---energizing a pastor (specifically me) ---feature links to other blogs I've saved under favorites... ---and a chance to win two dollars in cash and/or prizes...hee hee   WISDOM FOR TODAY : Never let the popcorn supply run out at home.  After all, it's why we went to Wal-Mart in the first place....  Rob

      Various thoughts on a Friday night after a  long  day at work while listening to the season-finale of my wife's absolute  urlLink favorite show ......  There are some things you can't blog about:  --Your job....that's just common sense, but after tough days one needs a place to decompress....but thanks to worldwide access, this ain't the place.....  --Your ex-girlfriends.....my wife reads, for goodness sakes!! :)  Then there are things on other blogs that are driving me nuts:  --Having to accept a software download just to view the blog.  Sorry, never worth it.  --Music.  Once it starts, I leave.  I'm here to read, not lip-sync.  --Wild colors.  That's an age-issue (don't wear my glasses and I should, especially since I live at a computer screen)...  --The F-word.  All over the place, even from 14 year olds.  Do y'all not know any intelligent adjectives??  Okay...there I feel better.  Nothing like substitute ranting to calm a man down....:)  ( MONK UPDATE: After taking his first pill, Adrian is now calling himself "The Monk" and eating other people's food .)  Gee, well, this day was spent at work....so I really can't tell ya about life here today.  I have an 11am live fantasy football draft on Yahoo! in the morning, and I promised the kids some chess action tomorrow evening.  Yes, even the 7-year old likes chess.  Cool!!  I've watched very little of the Olympics...does that make me Un-American?  One reason is NBC's presentation.  Let's tape the stuff, fill 7-11pm with prelims and filler, and show the good stuff just before midnight.  Baseball has this same problem; their future audience is in bed long before the final is posted (All-Star Game, World Series, etc.).  Sorry, I prefer live events, which they won't show on a B-level cable channel at 8am (sorry, Bravo...), they'll wait 'til prime time.  It's business, I get that.  Doesn't mean I have to subscribe though.....  I like both Olympics, but, forced with a choice, I'll take the Winter Games.   GO CURLING!!    Shout outs and happy birthdays  to my Governor's School buddy Julie Anne (tomorrow 8/21), my long-time friend Barbara's son, John Lloyd (also tomorrow--the big 4!!), and to my sister-in-law, who reaches an age of an undetermined nature on Monday, 8/23.  Music I'm listening to:  "Abacab", Genesis  (still...) :)  Top song: "Like it or Not" (CD cut 8)  Oh, and to close, I really don't plan to be too political here, unless it's weighing on my mind (see blog description at top)...and tonight it is.  SOMEONE NEEDS TO CHANGE JOHN KERRY'S DIAPER.  Bless his heart, let's not question his military service, even though people who are WERE ACTUALLY THERE WITH HIM.  Then he calls on the FEC to stop 'em.  Tell ya what, John, tell Moveon.org to do the same thing if you're really "above the fray".....didn't think so.  We'll give the "Bush is Hitler" crowd a free pass, after all, they have their first amendment rights!  Same thing as if I said "Re-elect President Bush" from the pulpit.  Barry Lynn and his cronies would scream for us to pay taxes.  Yet during the primary season, a Sunday night newscast didn't go by without seeing one or more Democratic candidates in African-American church pulpits, being warmly greeted, introduced, and sometimes endorsed, by their man of the cloth.  Let's hold our breath and see how many of them get into hot water.  Oh, that's right, their last name isn't Falwell.  *soap box put away*  All the best to you and yours....

      My wife talked with the principal of our new elementary school today. It was supposed to be "moving in" day. Now maybe it's next week. Whenever it is, it sounds like she and the kids will get plenty of time to learn the lay-out of the land.  They've volunteered to help the office (or anyone else) move in and get settled. Believe it or not, the kids are excited about it! Even Robbie, who will have no other connection to Greenwood but his sister. The principal was excited about that and the fact Bonnie wants to volunteer in the office this year. I agree with her that it's a great change of pace while still being involved at our daughter's school, without all the politics of a parent-teacher group. My jury is still out on whether I'll volunteer this year; though if needed, I won't turn away. If there are plenty of helpers (especially new blood), I will be glad to stand on the sidelines, cheer, and pitch in wherever needed.  I got the feeling over the last year at Longdale some people thought Bonnie and I were on some sort of power trip. Give me a break! If I'm gonna have a power trip over something, it better have a large financial reward attached, and, last I checked, volunteering didn't involve that!  Since Robbie entered kindergarten oh those many years ago, my desire has been to help my childrens' school, their administration and staff, and, most importantly,  the kids . The only power trip I need is to see a youngster in the hallway and have them say hi to me, either as "Robbie's dad", "Rachel's dad", or just "Mr. Witham". That is so satisfying. Plus I have to spend time around the people who educate my child; I must know them at least some, since they see my child more than I do on many weekdays.  I know I'll be involved in the "PTA or PTO" decision coming the first of the year when the parent-teacher group is formed. I have very definitive feelings on the subject (pro-PTO), but I'm gonna support and volunteer no matter what the acronym.  Right now, my biggest fear is the kids having to maneuver around large men named Fred or Bubba trying to finish construction  after  the school year starts.  Let it be said, though, that we do, and will, miss our home of 7 years, Longdale Elementary School.  Go Tigers!!    HELP NEEDED : My elementary alma-mater, Beaverdam Elementary, is raising money to purchase a "Weatherbug" weather station to help students learn about weather, plus serve as a real time weather source for area residents. I think it's a great idea!  urlLink Click here  for all the info.....   Rachel's Music Today:  Soundtrack to The Lizzie McGuire Movie . She bought it with her yard sale proceeds. Don't tell her I wrote this, but they'll be playing that song "This Is What Dreams Are Made Of" in hell. What an awful song! (though Rachel sings it very well)  Robbie's Highlight:  Wear Spiderman's Glove . Apparently it makes him cool. Fine by me...better than being forced to wear Spiderman Under-Roos, which I never owned by the way...  Oh, and less than 135 hours to go until my right arm's freedom hearing at the orthopedic surgeon's office. If freed, we're having a "sling-burning" ceremony (like a mortgage burning, 'cept it takes less than 30 years...), and you're all invited!  TOMORROW'S HEADLINE:  Shocking Development: Thunder and Lightning may be in our area! Rare, rare event!   Oh, and remind me to tell you about Scruffy....  Rob :)

      Now that I'm beginning to learn how to post pics on my blog (and we've finally been able to download stuff from our digital camera since our dock died), I'm playing a little "catch-up".  Looking back on 2004 thus far, I know this event is among the highlights. Going to a vacant house. Sounds nuts, eh?  I know, next time I'll top it with watching grass grow.  But, it just so happens that it's not just any vacant house....  It begins one day reading the real estate section during our 74th attempt to find a bigger house, when I came across an ad describing a house that sounded alot like the old parsonage I grew up in.  After some 'Net searching, I got my answer.  My old house was up for grabs!  Oh, if I were independently wealthy, it wouldn't have lasted five minutes on the market!!!  So, I send out an e-mail to the realtor explaining who I was and asking if there was any way I could get a "showing" for my family.  I get a reply; turns out I grew up with this lady!  Jill explained that there was an offer on the home and the former owner had vacated.  She'd see what she could do.  After getting permission from the seller, we hit the road one Saturday morning after Jill called and said "I'll meet you there at 10."  As usual, Mom was working Saturday morning, so the three of us (Dad, Robbie, and Rachel) head northwest to familiar territory.  Now I must take a moment and go even further back to set the scene. My dad pastored the church which owned the parsonage for 21 years.  I was one of those weird preacher's kids who actually lived in one place my entire childhood.  Due to health issues, he had to retire shortly after I moved off to college.  I got the news in Massachusetts one night, flew home the following weekend to visit and meet, along with Dad, with church officials (the situation wasn't pretty by this point).  So, I leave the house Sunday October 27, 1985 to get to the airport to return to school, thinking I'd be back at Thanksgiving.  Within two weeks, my folks were out of the house and out of the church.  My brother and sister-in-law came up from Carolina to help in what turned out to be "speed-packing" to leave and head to an apartment in Richmond.  That was where I came " home " to at Thanksgiving (talk about a shock).  Bottom line, I never had the chance to say "good-bye" to the only home I'd ever known.  Being a highly nostalgic person, this mattered to me  ALOT .    Many times I had thought of writing a letter to "current owner" and asking him/her if I could come see the old homestead, but I never got the gumption to do it. (The church sold the parsonage in the late 80s and built a new one beside the church)....so this was, indeed, a "God-send" opportunity, and, what's better, the kids get to see where Dad wore diapers, ate Spaghettios, played golf, and listened to loud music...  We arrive at the house at precisely 10:01am.  Jill is there and is more than gracious, letting us in and telling us to take our time and enjoy.  We took her up on it.  For the next 45 minutes I took my kids on a "living history" tour of sorts....  What was most striking was the seller of the home had practically done nothing to the property.  The bad news with that is (and Jill warned me about this in advance) the home was not in good condition and was in need of several HGTV crews.  The good news, though, was the house looked almost  EXACTLY  like it did from 1967 to 1985.    So, I show the kids the living and dining rooms, the fireplace in the living room, the picture window where I used to watch snow fall and pray to hear Hanover County Schools were closed on WRVA radio.  The same hanging fixture light was in the dining room.  I couldn't believe it.  Kitchen?  Same.  We laid a "new" linoleum floor around 1977, and it was still there, along with the wooden cabinets and the back door.  Down the hall to, first, my old room.  Once shared with my brother, this space  WAS  home.  It's where I slept, watched TV, listened to countless hours of music (with headphones), played Nerf basketball, and more.  It sure looks smaller when you see it nearly 20 years after childhood ended!! :)  We visit my parents' room, then the back bedroom (once my sister's, later an office), and then I explain to the kids how we all shared ONE bathroom.  I don't think they comprehended it very well.... Heck, the same mirrors we hung in there still were, well, hanging around...  Then, down the hall to the basement door.  The most poignant moment came when I opened the door.  The kids started down the steps and I froze for a moment.  The basement "smell" was exactly the same as it was 20 plus years ago (and it wasn't a bad smell, just a familiar one, reminding you that you're home...).  Then I joined them downstairs, showed the kids where I used to play putt-putt indoors, where Uncle Frank and I would play indoor hockey with a tennis ball and real golf clubs (and destroy each other's shins in the process...) and where Dad's "stuff" used to be, including the legendary pool table (they want one really bad!)  The door leading out of the basement to the back yard was broken, but usable, and we next stepped outdoors to Dad's baseball field/football field/golf course.  We walked around, checked out Nana's old clothesline, and took more pictures.  Back in for a few more moments, then I knew it was time to go.  Jill had an appointment soon and she had been  SO  kind to allow us to do this.  Robbie gets some photos of me and Rachel and finally, one of just me, on my old front porch.  Then, after some conversation with Jill, including reassurance that the new owners would be great caretakers, we headed off.  But, of course, not before I looked at the house, said thank you to God for this incredible opportunity, and then, 18 1/2 years later, I said good-bye....  We passed it the other week while riding around during vacation.  There's a new front door, and a new shed in the back yard.  So far, so good!  TODAY'S NEWS: Rachel took pictures!!  We got the x-rays done.  Even better news....no cavities for both Rachel and Robbie!! I'm a proud papa.....Robbie's adventures with braces is pending.  I'm so sorry he was "blessed" with my family's teeth (me, and his Papa especially...)  Well, much other stuff to do, mail to open, a fantasy football league blog to begin, and more, but alas, sleep is next on the docket.  Tomorrow is going to be a long day at the station....  Thanks for letting me drag you down memory lane....the pics below are from the trip.  Good day!  Rob

      ...and I wouldn't give them a medal either.  My phone rings at 609am.  It's the traffic reporter at the radio station, and she's missing the new Olympic-themed commercial copy for a local supermarket.  It was only sent to seven different email addresses, and no one at work had it.  But I KNOW I'd seen it w/my own eyes!  Turns out I did get the copy on my home email....had I used my brain, I'd printed it out and taken it w/me.  NOT a good way to start a Monday...:(  Today got progressively better at work, though I must have yawned 59 times (is that like crying 96 Tears?).  The kids were WILD this evening (they really need to be back in school) and they're now in beddy-bye.  They've got a date w/the dentist tomorrow.  I'm praying Rachel will finally overcome her fear of taking an x-ray.  For my wife, the question is a broken record.....When are you going to get a chest x-ray???  The cough continues, and it ain't lettin' go.    Oh, and welcome to day 64 of the shoulder sling.  I can't wait for next Tuesday's x-ray.  Hopefully the sling will be past-tense, though the worst (therapy) is yet to come....ugh.  So, it's the 3rd consecutive summer I've been "sick/crazy/nuts/injured".  No wonder I love winter so much!! 2002: The Flu; 2003: Depression/Can't leave home syndrome"; 2004: busted shoulder, end of athletic career.  I'm hoping 2005 isn't the year of Ricketts or Scurvy or somethin'.....  Watched some Packers/Seahawks football (GREAT to hear Pat Summerall back on the air) and now it's wrestling.  They gave Orton the world title too quickly, but, they didn't ask my opinion now did they??    I've browsed dozens of "blogs" this past week and am rather jealous.  I don't know how to post links or put on pictures (I am computer savvy enough to do my job at work and some stuff here and that's it) but as time goes on, I'm gonna learn  I've already found several interesting blogs I want to provide links to as well.    First up, posting a picture of the cutest three of our family on their Virginia Beach getaway with family in June (Dad had to stay home and bring home the bacon).  I'd like to show them off, and at the same time, conceal my identity (hee hee...).  Actually, I've never seen a pic of me on the 'Net; found my name in several places though (surely you've Googled your own name, haven't you??)  Today's final notes:  Music:  Abacab by Genesis and Linda Ronstadt's Greatest Hits Volume Two (even though she doesn't like to know if my type is in her audience...)  Mood:  Tired, but better than at 609am today!   Tomorrow's headline: Rachel Takes First Dental X-Ray; Gold Discovered.....  Good day!

      My first friend died a year ago today.  I distinctly remember how I got the news, how I immediately fell into "console" mode when my Sunday School teacher told (ironically at the gravesite of another funeral), and how, while walking away with the kids down the long path to Dad's old church, it began to sink in.  First thing I did upon getting home was get online to confirm the news, and there it was.  Suicide, we were told.  I couldn't get to the funeral the next day in NC, I had service at church to handle.  So I was so honored to be asked to speak at a memorial service for Mike the following weekend back home in Beaverdam.  God was gracious and got me through it, and I got to see alot of wonderful people.  My heart broke for his parents, who were basically my 2nd parents growing up, and his sister, but especially for his children, who were left with many questions.  I also got to see other friends from days gone by.  Paula (she, Mike and I were the three amigos at church growing up) and I are in touch again (she moved recently back home to Beaverdam---lucky!), I saw several people from AC Church days, and I had a long talk with Leah, who agreed w/me that it just didn't seem possible he would take his own life.....  ....the weeks go by and more questions arise....and now, a year later, there's a PI on the case and the possibility of some cover-up.  One day the truth will be told, here or Home in Heaven, and I can't wait for the day when it is revealed and justice is served.  Until such time, Mike, see ya soon, for exciting paper football action that'll never end!  Michael Edwin Crisp (1967-2003)  --Didn't really watch much Olympic opening stuff tonight; I spent more time with biographies of Andre the Giant and Hulk Hogan and the 100 Greatest Songs in Film History.  Bonnie was out w/Stephanie doin' the girl thing....Rachel and I played chess (chess at age 7, pretty good!) and we watched the Charley news.  After going through Isabel last year my heart and prayers go out to the Floridians going through this mess tonight....  G'night....time for Saturday sleep in!!!

      Well, finally updated the web site for the church tonight.  Quick plug: http://www.bcc4christ.org  There....that's one of many things that need to be done.  You know, those things that we'll "get around" to doing...heh heh....  Let's see, there's still the new sound system to find, purchase, and install at church, expanding our contemporary praise and worship song category, beginning to study to preach Revelation once we're done with "The Purpose Driven Life"....that's just church.  At home, I can't do much with one hand (day 59 of shoulder sling) so I work mostly at this desk.  I've got emails to return, some from old friends I haven't seen in years, others from present-day presences.  I need to transform my other blog into a "POF" blog.  Oh, quick lesson---"POF" stands for Professional Offensive Football, the fantasy football game started by my brother and I in 1983.  We played two years, then resurrected it in 1997.  This season, it's the drive to Paper Bowl VIII!!  We have a championship plaque and everything! This way, all team owners can catch up on the latest roster moves, stats, etc, just by stopping by the blog.  Then there's school!  The kids have new backpacks, they're already filled with supplies, and they're ready to start back tomorrow!  Rachel goes to 2nd grade at our brand new elementary school, where, in September, parents/staff will meet to decide whether to form our parent teacher group as a PTA or as a PTO.  What's the difference, you ask?  Sorry, that's a whole 'nother post for another time....  Well, off to check out the blog world, then I must get some rest! Getting one thing done on your to-do list is exhausting!

      Time for some Witham facts to help you understand who we (mostly I, since my wife and kids don't blog) are, and you'll hopefully stop by here from time to time.  1) We love God, and His Son Jesus! 2) We absolutely love Mountain Dew (both diet and regular) 3) There are too many TV's in our house, 4) Our house is too small, but the mortgage payment's just right. 5) We drive 45 miles one way to church (it's because it's where I pastor) 6) My 7-year old daughter helps me lead praise songs. 7) Football season is taken very seriously... 8) Fantasy Football season is taken even more seriously... 9) We have a huge HGTV fan here....and it's not me. 10) I prefer Steve on Blue's Clues, my girl prefers both him and Joe. 11) My son awaits May 25, 2005 when the final Star Wars movie arrives. 12) Until such time he plays Rachet and Clank and Yu-Gi-Oh. 13) His parents are sick of Yu-Gi-Oh. 14) Gino's Restaurant in Glen Allen next to Target is da bomb! 15) My wife is a compulsive cleaner. 16) My kids and I make sure she finds plenty to fulfill that desire... 17) Yes, we're Christians, but we didn't buy our kids at Wal-Mart, if ya know what I mean.... 18) I like Genesis....the group and the book in the Bible! 19) We've never met a french fry we didn't like. 20) We can never have enough friends.  We'll (oops, I'll...) be talking about just about everything here; just depends on what life sends our way.  Hope to see you on the road!
