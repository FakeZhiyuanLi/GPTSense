Me=hating talking infront of people i dont usually associate with. no, im not a snob. just a shy person at times. I had to do a test in science, wow. think i failed that one. Lunch was kinda..yeah...nothing special...i cant remeber..cept Cody and Erin kept farting...jk jk...and then cody and a bunch of guys read my girly magazine..? no comment. then tim came to where we were in a muscle shirt. and shorts. lana thought he looked hot...sorta.:) In gym we had to play cricket. it was sorta like baseball. but not at all...it was wierd.  Then English was frikin boring as usual. Tim, yet again, took his shoes off and kept touching me with his sock feet. i didnt like it too much. sorry man. After school, went to work...it was boring, nobody came in. excpet some old lady i didnt know who gave me a cookie. :) wow..then the guy i work with bought me a pizza bun and cake. hes trying to make me fat-er. lol  Then i went to dads. for like 30 mins. went outside...talked to some people...[heart] ..now im home at my moms:(...i hate this. -later nesh  Its been awhile and i havent forgotten the way you made me feel like  im on top of the world and i wish i could feel it agian i wish i could love you agian, and do anything to make you happy. to make you love me.

Then we biked to Tims, and he came to the park with us...we just kinda hung out, went back to his house. His Bro, Matty was there. with Robert Chelsea Josh Shauna Ian Emily...etc. We talked to them for a few minutes, then we rode our bikes to my house. went to ben's to get tim's bikes. went back to tim's house. walked around looking for those people...went to the park. tim pulled around a wagon. saw the guys agian behind tim's house. talked to Ian. He wanted tim. in the pants. Went back to Tim's backyard-ish. saw austin. introduced him to erblina, like we introudced her to ian. they thought they knew each other from somewhere, which was funny.

Erin and I coached 1st and 3rd. and really, we're pro. My Sister Amy did awesome. i cheered for her. She got a Homerun!! It was awesome. they won all the games that we were there for.  So then at 1, my mom picked Erin and I up and took us to Waverly, to watch the boys play. wow. they kicked ass. major. they won the tourny...and they played awesome. I think they all got homeruns. it was that good. Me and Erin watched 2 of thier games, they rocked!   Anyways, then i drank so much that day i had to GO so badly. it was insane. Erin kept mentioning water as i fantasized of deserts. wow, thanks. then she laughed at me..! AND I GOT VERY SUNBURNED!! I HURT. OUCH.  So then, we took the bus..she went downtown and i went to work at the Hospital..which was veryyy boring...but im up to 49 hours!! yay! so then went to my dads, then to my moms and studyed for science all night.  Tuesday...today...had my final science exam. sucked, but wasnt too hard. but everyone who said it was very easy was insane, because it wasnt at all. but now im all done, so its all good..took the bus home all alone. ate. watched tv. then i went to em's house i changed into my bathing suit, in an attempt to tan..haha.   we sat in her backyard, and the sun was barely out. but everytime it came out, we stripped down. lol..it was funny. then we mande strawberry smoothies, which were incredible. and 3 bugs landed on em. i laughed. so we sat and talked for ahile on the blanket in her backyard...it was nice. then we decorated her basement for her lil party thing tonight. i was pro...i wrapped the long paper stuff around the banister, then backwards..its hot. and we got ballons to. so then we walked up to gateway. i saw amy. and we walked home. finished decorating. then em decided to open up the noise makers she bought, to try them out! so she blew in it....AND IT MADE NO NOISE! you shoulda seen the look on her face..omg it was soo funny, cuz the noise makers made no noise...none of them did... it was awesome...then she went to walk into the laundry room, and pushed the door open when it wasnt open...so it didnt open and she just kinda hit it...wow i laughed. i told her to turn the handle..haha good times.. so then i biked home, and here i am. woooo. so i better go...i dont know what my plans are for tonight. i kinda wanna get outta here....anybody!?...? please.  forever vanessa.  Good times: *Me and Erin watch some wierd girl run onto the baseball field just to give Blair a stuffed horse, and then she gets yelled at by mr. c* "hahaha, what was that about"-us ...a few mins later... *Blair comes in and tosses us the horse* "To Blar from your lovers!?"-me reading tag. "hahaha, BLAR!"-us "She looked kinda like a horse"-Austin "...thats why she gave him a horse...she had to give him something to remeber her by"-me haha it was funny, then at their next game: "wow, Jason (H) is veryy hot"-erin "..haha"-me "Id bang him!"-erin "so would I!"-all the guys on the bench "of course! even id bang him! even jason would bang him!"-me  ..so i guess you had to be there. we laughed pace.

      Well, its late and i should be in bed. I'm not. I decided to make a BLOG about Amy. because shes my #1 fan. haha, oh and i luv her! So first off, Amy=blonde. no, not just pretty hair, (and pretty toes! lol) but extremely BLONDE! wow. heres justa couple examples  One day we decided to go swimming at the West End. so we get outtta the car, amy's carrying her towel, and she looks down and she says:" Hey guys! where are my clothes!?" The funny thing is, she was wearing them. overtop of her bathing suit! haha aww that was a funny one. My favourite was this one: I was on msn, and she msg's me: "hey vanessa, can u print something for me? MY PRINTER ISNT WORKING!" "yah sure"-me *I spend 35 mins trying to open up the file she sent me on my computer. i try in Word, on Paint and in the Internet, over email and over msn. but it just wont work. so we;re bothing going insanely frantic...! *amy msg's me agian* "...its working now!"-amy "oh thats good, what did u do to fix it?"-me "I turned it on"-Amy WOW! i laughed so hard.  Me and Amy have also had our good times too. like the wedding of our switching parents last year. yup, they switched. weird huh? So we wer eboth to enrvous to walk down the aisle by ourselves, so we walked together. then her mom and my dad were saying thier vows, and my and amy were standng up with them, across from my brother Phill. he was making faces and imitating the minister making US laugh. it was embarsing! but funny. then the dance was the BEST part, right amy? lol and the golf carts..and Doug[heart] Which reminds me of yet another moment.  Amy and i were sitting in the drink/bar area with Doug. [remeber, the wedding is at a golf course] *Amy looks onto the wall at a plaque, as she debates what to get to drink* "i Think ill have a drink of 'Eric Puss' "-Amy "hahahahahaha"-me and doug "what!?"-amy "That plaque has the name of golfers. not drinks"-me HAHA! get it? wow!..if u dont...'Eric Puss' is a golfer...amy thought it was some sort of fancy drink. wow then there is our looooooong talks about everything. lovers, school, hot guys..lovers..guys..haha, yeah. well there is probably sooo much more i could say. but im so tired. and im going to her baseball tomorrow, so i better sleep.  AMY! heres your blog! i love ya hunni! always here 4 u! *Step sisters for life, blonde sisters forever* XOXO Vanessa.

So..Saturday what did i do saturday? ohh wait, i got up at 9ish. fell asleep till 9 20. somebody was in the shower, fell back asleep till shower was empty at 9 30. got ready, went to dragonboat races at Guelph Lake with my mom. it was sorta fun. watched the races, helped mom work, ate pizza and a drumstick...that was the best part. finally came home around 2. Then i hung out with Sylvia and Kate. we went to zehres to get Sylvias pictures, i had to buy hotdog buns, then sylvia bought us milkshakes (they were really good, thanks Sylivia (heart)) then we were walking home. sylvia still had here milkshake cup. she all the sudden had the urge for tadpoles. so we walked into the ditch and into the fron place of zehres, where it all dirt, and there is a tiny pond beside the road/sidewalk. since i was the one wearin flip flops, i walked over, and got her 2 tadpoles. one was a baby. i caugh them in a cup then we left. Kate named them Ethuce and some other wierd thing, like a combination of bruce and buddy and ethel. wow kate, creative! then we all took turns holding the cup, cuz we are so cool, and lame. and i swear, the tadpoles were having sex in the cup. frik. get a frikin cup!.. so then i dropped them off at my house, got yelled at by my mom for not going mini golfing with them, and went to sylivias. we hun gout for a couple hours, went on her roof,looked at yearbooks and magazines, ate pringles, went on msn and talked on the phone. left around 7 10. me and kate went to meet em at st francis. walked around, saw some guys, but then got hungry so went to my house. kate had my chicken burger,, and licorise for em and me. and a banana. then we went tback to the school, and guys were playing basketball. we hung out. and went to the park, and the swings. kate lost herphone, so we looked for it. i found it. yay. called home and found out the score of the game was 2-1. frik. then the guys left. me and kate walked back, and mike decided to come with us! we satyed at st francis till 11. we slid down the pole thing. i sucked at that. yay. then we talked and watched the stars. ben came back eventually too, and kept falling off his scooter. him and mike raced down the railing pole things. and me and kate did. woooo it was fun! then we walked home! kate got pikced up and i watched the end of the game. Calgary lost in double overtime, 33 fuckin seconds in. i lost a bet now with my brother and dad. crap.:( then i came on msn  and talked till like 1 30 to mike!:) good times. well i better go do homework again. then im going shopping with my mom for a new bathing suit:) YES! latar- x n o

       OLA!   Had a realli good past few days..   Wednesday my baseball practise got cancelled (we realli needed it)! So my mom and i went to the mall. i returned a shirt i got and exchanged it for a smaller one, and got a new white denim skirt. its hot. and i got 2 more holes in my ears!!!! it hurt onli a little, and it looks so sweeet!    &nbsp;  Thursday was like the best day..ever. I had a baseball game at night, and i pitched and got 3 strikeouts in a row in one inning...3up 3 down:) and then i hit a double and it was hot. and after that amy showed up:)&nbsp;haha it was my best game. lol it started raining in like the 4th/5th inning! so we all got soaked. it was so nie tho cuz the sun was out and we were all standing out in the field, and it was like a millon degres and it was so hot, and it just started raining. i loved it. so we took a 10 minute break and went under this big tree with our whole team, and they all sung happy birthday to lisa and me. :) Vicki was also there after being gone for like ever. she brought us all postcards and key chains and she brought me these candy on a stick things, which i love. so then we started playing again. we ended up losing but it was the ump's fault seriously.&nbsp; he always ump the team we played no matter what diamond its at just cuz his step daughter is on that team, and they always win and we get shitty calls. but it was the best game still, so fun. and i won MVP:) Thanks guys;) So then at one point Adrian came to our bench and told me and vicki and megan to cheer like "yeayyeah"-it sounded really gangster, and it was so funny, cuz megan actually did it, it was funny. we laughed.   So after the game erin thomas and cody and me went swimming at erins. it was the funnest. we played "pool games". haha, awwh good times. me and erin went on thier shoulders! and we tryed to push each other off. haha and then we played marco polo. except i got caught cuz thomas was holding me out in front of him:   "marco"-erin   "polo"-thomas, with me in front of him so he couldnt get caught   "cheeter!"-me   "whos marco cheeter!?" haha   So we got out at 10 30 ish. and tom and cody walked me home.   Then i go thome, 15 minutes late. shittttt. but surpirsingly phill asked my mom if me and him could go get slushies at 11 30 and she let us...hm? wierd    &nbsp;  So today i went to st francis and met amy there and then we went to Deerpath park played grounder and hung out with this hot mexican guy who she met.. aww they're so cuuute togther!! Marco..no...Maresio! it was soo funn!! hes the sweeetest guy, hes so cute, and awesome:)   then me and amy came back here and talked for an hour eating ice cream sandwiches.   So now im gonna go pack cuz im going to my trailor in Orrilia for the weekend.    &nbsp;  Ciao. xoxox   love vanessa.   Adious!    &nbsp;

      wow. i really hate hate. its depressing isnt it? I dont like how when somebody you care about so much is trying to understand how u feel, and you dont let them. you dont bother explaining yourself because your afraid it will only make things worse. it also really sucks how you have to live on, after you feel like you don't know what your living for. its like trying to find the light in a dark room youve never been in. thats what it feels like. and when you do finally think you have found the light, and your so happy to finally see whats going to light up your life, theres nobody else in the room.

I Hate how i love you.

      Ah i havent blogged for a while. miss me? anyways. hmm..thursday i had a baseball game. against Gatto. We only had 8 players, so it was a little bit of a struggle you could say. at one point we were losing '20-4' (Reason being, we hadent played/pracised in 2 weeks) but then we came back and only lost 19-11...haha yeah, im still trying to figure that one out? hm. anyways, megan got MVP for an awesome catch she made in the field when i was pitching, it was such a good ctach, she got mid season MVP (VMP! lol megan) and got this baseball phone thingy. "and it works!"...lol. So came home, and ended up going for a little walk...it was nice;):)  On Friday i just sorta cleaned...and attemped to burn a CD...which failed miserably 3 times. Sorry Josh! Ended up getting picked up by my dad at 5:47 to go to Orrillia for the weekend, to our trailor! Amy and i watched her grad video and part of her SEVEC video on the way up, cuz we have one of those VCR/TV things in her moms van, which is very handy. so we watched that, and by the time it was over, we were there..lol 3 frikkin hours later..cuz there was tons if traffic/accidents. frik.  So when we got there, it wasnt really dark yet so me and Amy went for a walk around the park. it was my first time being there since last summer. we got a new golf course, and it looked cleaner! haha, so we decided to walk down to the lake..i think its Lake Couchiching? Hm, anyways it was so funny, because we were walking down there, and there would be these huge packs of misquitoes every 5 steps, and one time me and amy both covered our faces and waved our arms around as we ran threw them...and we Ran into each other!!!! Ha! it was soooo funnnnyyy!!!!!!! BLONDES! So we went and sat on this rock right on the lake for like, ever. we talked so much, about guys, high school, and basicly evetyhing. i love how much i can talk to her:) so we just sorta stayed there, until it was dark: "...heyy its dark?!?"-me so then we went back to our trailor...ATE! and hung out. we ended up going to bed in the Florida room around..12:18? or thats the last i heard....cuz Kim told us to be quiet and she said it was like 2...but it wasnt. hm. anyways  Woke up to Uncle Bob talking to amy about history and politics the next morning, i could tell amy was reallll enjoying it!! lmao. so i put my walkman on. eventually got up and showered, and went shopping. Bought: SWEET pink blouse thingy? u know those cool ones? Jean Capris from Bluenotes, earings, ankelet, pink campuscrew tshirt, jewelery from clairs...and yeah., i was happy. Went back to the trailor and Cindy and Pat were there (kims friends) as well as Deb and harry (thier trailor is behind ours) so they all hung out, and me and amy went swimming. *me and amy are walked to the pool* "yes i know im hot"-some random guy passing us "hmm what the?"-us So we swam for awhile. it was warm. supposely a few hot guys came in, but without my glasses i couldnt see!! fruk. Dried off and went back.. LAYYED ON THE HAMMOCK!! WHICH IS THE BEST THING IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. umm had dinner, watched 10 Things I Hate About You...cute movie. Then daddy and Phill went fishing. me and amy went to see what they caught[nothing]..then we went to the park. We were on the swings, then this guy who we had seen like sooooo many times came and sat there with us. there was a bunch of ppl with him too. he asked us how we were doing, and we talked about whre we were from and all that kinda stuff. he was John, from Woodbridge? or something like that. he was kool. then we said bye and walked home. the adults were having campfire..and we went inside and listened to music and ATE!!! ahh white powder donuts own me like nothing else...yumm. and nibs too. i swear, i learned i could live off those donuts, nibs and bagel bites for the rest of my life and be totally satisfied. mmmm.  So Today woke up to phills boxers in my face. Thank you very much. got ready and all that jazz. went to the lake with amy. saw dad and phill fishing. saw tadpoles... We also saw John agian. siad hello. went back to the trailor packed up and left.:  *driving outta the park* "hey vanessa are you gonna watch a movie on the way home"-phill "...............vanessa?" '*Amy and I stare at John as we pass him in the van* "bye John!!"-us *waves* "cya!"-john "............."

CLOTH YOUR CHILDREN!  Just got home from baseball. i was supposed to have a practise tonight, but my coach said it looked like it was gonna rain, so cancelled. then sahe called me at 5:56 and told me she wantd me to be a call-up pitcher in the midget league( like 18 yr olds.) and i was like "....yay". so the game started at 6:00. so we rushed over to the diamond, and played some ball. i pitched, and well. hm, they were strikes for sure, but too slow, so they hit off me and the outfield was kept busy. frik i need to speeeeeeeeed up. then it started to rain HARD, so me and the girls from my original team who were also call-ups went to this little park thing. and jay came with a clear garabge bag over her head that her coach had given her. i laughed at her, then coach came and literally Put it on my body. almost straglling me.  " Okay, quikley...CAN YOU BREATHE!?"-coach "....mhmm"-me  it was fun tho. we looked so kooooool. then the game started again. and then i hit once, between short and 2nd. yay, got home. then it started to rain. and the wierdo ump saw lightening, so the game was cancelled. frikker, it didnt even count...damn.  so yeah, going for a shower now. latar. xx nn oo vaness  Quooote: *i was playing 3rd, and there is a girl on 3rd base talking with her coach about stealing home* "okay now, 1 out, if its a pop-fly, hold up here, then run hard, ifs its a grounder watch first then run home, but-"-coach "Shutup.

      Good Morning  Im so tired...but i have been sleeping so much. hmm...? Anyways, just woke up. About Wonderland yesterday, Phill  and Sean (his friend) came too. I did all the Rollarcoatsers they did, i was sooo proud. Exact opposite of last year, when i was the one on the ground watching them on every single one. no joke. Ive been missing out. haha  So first we did that new Tomb Raider one. where you lie down the whole time! it was kinda different, but fun. sorta like the Fly. Then they convinced me to do Cyclone!

We were the first ones on the beach. it was sooooooo nice. We srtaed by tanning of course. Then i went in the water first! woo. then Kyle came in. Then Me and Him picked up Tim and dragged him into the water in his tshirt and shorts and dunked him. haha, he wasnt too pleased with us, but it was hillarious. Then tamsen came. A little while later,  we took a "hike" through this little trail rocky path thing. came to a cliff. set up our towels there and ate lunch, while the guys cliff jumped. i was still to chicken, but next time for sure. after that we walked to the waterfall, and the mill, which is really pretty. then we went back to the beach. swam, got freezies and ice cream, tanned more. i finally tanned for once, im so happy, but my whole back and the back of my legs feel like they're burnt. but im tanned so its allll good:). Tamsen barried me in the sand, and tim and kyle helped, except they got so much sand in my eyes/mouth/lips/ears/bikini. thanks. then tamsen gave me a sand penis and "genital area"...i loved it. she took a picture.then we all went in the water one more time. Em almost drowned me. almost, i couldnt breathe, i was honestly scared. then i got her back..haha!! i win. dryed off and tanned more, packed up and walked to the gas station where we were meeting tims dad to go home.   came home and showered yes! had a BBQ for dinner with my whole family. Then i walked to Zehres with my mom to get my Grade 9 pics. they are awesome, for once my camera worked:):):). i love it.  Came home and watched "A Walk to Remember" with Amy. We both cryed...it was the sweetest movie. i think it is my favourite i love it soooooooo much, i could watch it everyday. its so sweet, and Shane West is the hot-test evR! wow...i love that movie.  Then i came on msn. chat-ted it up...found out me and mike's dads both grew up in sault Ste Marie and they know each other, kool stuff eh...got tired and got some sleep, because i love sleep.  Woke up today around 11 15:) yay! i slept in! Ate strawberries that my sister picked. yummy yummy. showered and got ready  Went to the mall with my mom and phill. i got new funky brown flowery sandals, sunglasses, makeup, and razors! yes! haha...Then went to the Boathouse for some ice cream on the way home.  So now im going to gooooo...its sooo nice outside. warm...yay.  :) xoxo :) Vanessa.DiPasquale.  *Ashley tosses phone onto couch and walks outside after talking on it* "....hello?"-amy haha! there was nobody on the phone! ashley was just putting it back. hahaha.

Attempted to tan this afternoon. for about 5 minutes, haha. then i played catch with my mom. yes.got ready to go to the fireworks.   Erblina came to pick me up at 5 15 and we drove to Canadian Tire, where Kate was waiting with mark and "them". we walked to Riverside. Had to pay the family rate of $5 to get in. which mark payed. thanks.and plus we got stcikers, which is the coolest of cool. so we walked around the park for the evening. Saw a couple hotties lol Erblina. red shirt[heart]. Then we walked over the bridge thingy and saw all these DIRTY KIDS playing in the water, like where it was going down and it was like slimey. the kids were so yukki. the guys even threw a golfball in and kept making them get it. and it was sorta yukki.   Kate bought me a hot dog. yum it was good. with no tax..! so we ate, saw chrsitian, walked around some more. Kate and Sylvia went on the ferris wheel thingyer. me and erblina walked around, then watched. i wanted to do it. it would have been so romantic...awwe. Ugh i have the wost memory i swear...ummm i bought a bunch of freezies:) and water and a drumstick. so we then went to where everyone set up thier blankets. it was soo pretty.  I SAW MORGAN! YES AFTER LIKE 2 YEARS!!! woo. lol she still looks the same. hugs. awww morgan it was soo nice to see you!! morgan is the coolest. almost as cool as stickers. well, maybe just as kool.  so we hung out for a while. took pictures!! listened to old music stuff. ew. it wasnt the greatest... lol we all..like all 20 of us just sorta chilled. it was soo nice. sylvia, sofija, kate, morgan, erblina, anna, more girls, all the guys...it was so sweet.  So finally the fireworks started. they played to music which was one of the prettiest things ever. it was sooo nice. it could have ever been romantic. COULD. we all lay down. it was cute. the fireworks were awesome. one ever looked like a butterfly. i liked it. they played a bunch of songs. then the last one, the 'finale' was Oh Canada. it was so awesome.  When Oh Canada was done, it was like, mad Chaos. like wow it was insane to find our rides...it was soo many people!!  anyways, it was a great night, so nice, and i highly enjoyed it. minus the romance of couse.  ciao. VaNesssAA  Quotes: *Oh Canada stops, the firework finale is over, and people start standing up* "..........................oh!....is it over???"-Erblina haha i laughed   There he goes. There he goes agian.  racing through my brain and  i just cant contain this feeling that remains.
