      Hey everyone!    Well, surprisingly enough tomorrow I will be making my first trip on the Shinkansen (bullet train).  After talking to my parents and Dana as they explored Tokyo, I decided that I really should meet them in Kyoto!  A) I haven't been yet.  B) I somehow managed to gain some nenkyu (paid vacation days) and C) my family came all the way to Japan and as things previously stood I would only get to spend 4 days with them.  Luckily I was at my favorite school where the teachers are absolutely amazing and helped me to sort out all of the possible ways I could get back and forth to Kyoto (trains, buses...).    Armed with a little bit of information, I ventured in to Sendai to try my luck at a travel agent.  With my trusty electronic dictionary I entered the travel agent relatively prepared for the task at hand.  For 30 minutes the agent and I discussed possible routes via buses, trains, and even planes.  Writing down times and dates and using lots of gestures and my broken Japanese, I finally left with train tickets in hand.  Granted I paid a lot of money, but sometimes the satisfaction you get from having successfully accomplished something completely in Japanese makes the dent in the wallet not quite as painful.      So in less than 24 hours I will be seeing my family for the first time in 7 months.  If you can`t make it home, it is always nice for a little bit of home to come to you!  The next 25 days or so are going to be crazy...4 in Kyoto, family in Sendai for 4, Elizabeth comes to visit, a trip to Okinawa with three friends, I turn 23, and have a joint birthday party with my friend Jess.  What more could I want!

         It's just another manic monday!  Actually, things here at school are incredibly quiet.  No classes, no students, no work...basically that leaves me searching the internet, reading, or watching the clock anxiously awaiting the end of the day.  Anyway, last week I was one of the guest ALT`s at the Izumi High School Winter English Camp.  So here is a brief overview of my experiences at the camp.   Most importantly, it was a lot of fun and a nice change of pace from the hours I ordinarily would have spent sitting at school doing absolutely nothing.  6 of the 7 other ALT's at the camp were loads of fun and it was definitely an incredible group they threw together.  Each of us was assigned a group of 10 students (I was group B) and the camp consisted of speech presentations, culture quizes, language classes(I taught Finnish), song performances, and drama productions.  Initially I thought I was given the Best group (Group B!) but early on I learned that the B stood for Bad group.   Some of my students were caught buying beers from the vending machines (yes there are beer vending machines everywhere in this country), one was kicked out for smoking, 7 skipped the drama practices,  another likes to become sick when it is convenient and she also went home, 3 skipped the culture quiz activites....you get the idea!  Nonetheless, overall it was a lot of fun but I know that if I had been given any of the 7 other groups my experience at the camp would have been even better and more enjoyable!  I am destined to have the trouble students throughout my stay in Japan.     Anyway, that is a brief overview of my days at winter camp.  I hope all of you are doing well and that things are starting to warm up whereever you are in the world.

      Konnichiwa!  I have been receiving a lot of emails recently in regards to my decision to leave Japan and where I am going to go from here.  Basically, I am not quite sure just yet.  I realized that another 18 months here in Japan would not allow me to experience the things I am looking for or hoping to accomplish at this stage of my life.  While the past six months have provided me with loads of first-time experiences and amazing discoveries about myself, the culture here in Japan, and those around me, I don`t believe that the situation I am in will enable me to be happy and satisfied for as long as agreeing to recontract would require.  I have now read loads of books ranging from Japanese fiction to theories of evolution, and even recently a book about becoming evil and what leads ordinary people to commit genocide.  I am continuing to study Japanese and my Tuesday night class has proven to be somewhat beneficial in that I am guaranteed a little structure.  Basically, I am reading and learning about anything I can get my hands on which is leading me to believe that at some point in the near future I will probably return to school for either a law degree or my masters.  Although this doesn't really provide you with a clear picture of where I will be or what I will be doing over the upcoming year, hopefully it will at least explain (although probably not very clearly) why I am leaving this experience in search of another new opportunity.   Another quick plea...if you have any contacts anywhere in the world that you think might provide me with an opportunity to experience something new and learn a lot in the process please feel free to let me know.

      Okay, so two weekends ago I was up in Hokkaido at the amazing yuki matsuri.  I told you a bit about it in my last email, but if you want to check out the official site:  urlLink http://www.snowfes.com    You`ll soon be able to see all of the ice and snow sculptures that I witnessed up close and personal.   Hopefully soon I will provide another link to some of my pictures as well as those taken by my friends capturing all of the fun and crazy moments!

      Hey Everyone!!!!    Over the past 6 months you have been receiving emails containing all of the exciting happenings in my life.  Well, as the list of recipients is steadily growing, I`ve decided to make my life a little easier.  Hence, this lovely blog!!!  So, from now on if you want to know what I am up to, just head to this site and you might just find a new update!!!

       It`s All About Change!       As I have mentioned in previous posts, March is primarily a transitional stage with no work and hours of keeping yourself occupied with random self-made tasks.  Well, March also marks a change...A BIG ONE!    Teachers here in Japan basically all have temporary positions at any randomly assigned school (or so it seems).  Then, after 4 years (average), teachers are shuffled and without fail, all the ones you really like are sent to another school somewhere in the prefecture.  So basically every year in April, new teachers arrive attempting to fill the places of those sent elsewhere in March.  At school today we had to hear the farewell speeches of 11 teachers/office people being sent away and now the staff room is quite lively with teachers moving all of their stuff to newly assigned desks in the staff room.  Luckily the ALT's don`t move.      I must say that as the ALT, you hear the list of people leaving and it`s quite a shock when all of the people who have really helped you are victims of the switch.  Unfortunately as well, the teachers you were hoping would be moved are still going to be here.  Anyway, tonight both of my schools are having their farewell parties (sobetsukai).  While I have spent the day at my base school (Teizan), tonight I will be going to the party for the boys school.       Without a doubt tonight will definitely prove to be a little bitter sweet.

       LINKS      If you haven`t noticed already, to the right are a couple links to some of my friends sites here in Japan.  They are a little crazy at times so if you decide to take a look just keep an open-mind.  My friends sites are generally pretty good for a few laughs!!!

        On the Job Front!       Well, over the past couple weeks I have been receiving emails from all over Europe.  Emails have come from Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, the U.K., Sweden, Norway, and Finland.  Why you might ask?!?!?!    Basically, I have now decided that from Japan I hope to move to Europe for maybe 6 months and see as much as I can in that time period.  While the Jet Program does pay very well, I have to have some type of income or some way of saving money to afford the travelling.  Currently I am receiving emails from all types of families with children of all ages asking for and offering different things.  Right now my top choice is a family that goes back and forth between Spain and Switzerland.  They have a live-in babysitter and live in domestic-help so all they would want me to do is help the kids with English when they are not in school, hang out with them, and drive them places.  In exchange I would receive free room and board, a monthly stipend, access to their car, would get to travel with them for free, and experience a little bit of life in Europe.  Not too bad I suppose...   I will definitely keep you updated as I narrow my search and ultimately determine where I will be heading next.  Don`t worry...I will definitely return to the US for a few weeks before I relocate abroad!

        Weekend Update...       It`s amazing how what originally was intended to be a quiet and relaxing weekend in my apartment turned into something completely different.  Well not completely I suppose.  Anyway, Friday after "work" I headed to Tagajo (Dave gave me a ride which was very nice) and met with Jemma and Stephanie for cocoa and dinner.  We then went to stephanie`s apartment to help her make icing for cupcakes because here in Japan they don`t sell those yummy little jars of all sorts of flavors.  Because Saturday was going to be an early morning for me I headed home on the early side because I had to shower and pack some stuff for saturday`s outing.     On to Saturday...at 10:30 I was picked up at the train station by Nitanai-Sensei (one of the boys school teachers) and found out that Yuko (Tadano-Sensei - the teacher that has now become one of my closest friends in Japan) had to go to the hospital that morning because of her knee.  Our original plan of going to a famous steak restaurant followed by a day in a sauna was obviously altered.  Fortunately, Yuko was able to meet us for lunch and then had to return to the hospital for an MRI.  Lunch was great, the sauna trip will be rescheduled, and Yuko is now on the road to recovery so all is well that ends well.      On Sunday I decided to head into Sendai to sort out my visa application for my upcoming trip to China at the end of April.  Originally planning to meet my friend Richard for lunch, things once again changed a bit. Richard was recovering from being ill so instead I met up with Sharon and Kristel.  Originally we had planned to meet at 2 which changed to 3 and then we went to a cafe for a couple hours before realizing that all of our apartments had no food.  Naturally we decided to extend our afternoon/evening and go to my favorite Italian restaurant.  It has a really cool atmosphere, the guys who work there are really friendly and really attractive, and they have an english menu which sometimes makes things a little easier.  I finally ended up back in my apartment after 9 PM which meant that I had spent 9 hours in Sendai.  At least I got a lot accomplished and had a nice afternoon of catching up with Kristel and Sharon.

        THE MAN AUCTION!      Because I wasn`t nearly tired enough after my party on Friday night, Saturday night had to be an equally festive and exhausting one.  In Miyagi there are two different groups of Jets doing Habitat for Humanity projects over Golden Week in May.  Well, the group going to Sri Lanka (the other one is going to Bangladesh) decided to have a ladies night and auction off some of Miyagi`s finest.  Our first challenge was getting there.    Due to the excitement of the previous night, I along with a couple of friends did not want to spend the night at the location of this event.  The problem was that the last bus to return was at 7:30 and that is the same time the event started.  While we initially believed we had no alternative, we eventually realized that not only would renting a car enable us to return home and sleep in our own beds, it would also end up costing less than taking the train, subway, and bus to get there.  I got to drive again!!!    The auction was a huge success and the habitat group raised over 6 man (60,000 yen or roughly $600 US).  All of us knew what package we were bidding on but not the man who was offering the designated service.  The packages included things such as motorcycle rides and dinner, massages, tennis lessons, and the final package was even a haircut and then photo shoot which enabled you to spend the day with one of the best looking Miyagi Jets.  The night was loads of fun and although I didn`t return home until almost 2:30 AM (I was running a bit of a carpool and therefore had to return everyone to their cities first) it was well worth it!   Lucky me also got to use the car the next day because we had to rent it for 24 hours so Jemma and I had fun doing a little shopping and lunch before I had to give it back.  All in all a very eventful weekend!

        MY BIRTHDAY PARTY!       Well, as I had begun celebrating my birthday a week prior with my trip to Okinawa, I had to end it with something equally exciting.  My friend Jess and I decided we were going to have a joint birthday party hosted by our friend Dave (with a little help from Cory who lives next door and let people sleep at her place).   On Friday I met up with my usual crew and headed to Rifu.  Only about 10/15 minutes away by taxi but getting there on the train is quite a task.    Anyway, it was definitely a party to remember.  I don`t think I have ever had such an international birthday party and will probably never have one again.  Everywhere you turned there was a different accent.  There were English, Welsh, Scottish, New Zealanders, Australians, Americans, Canadians, Japanese, and probably a few other country representatives as well.  There were probably between 40-50 people there throughout the course of the evening and it was great because I got to celebrate with good friends as well as make lots of new ones.     When the party starts around 8:30 and you return to your apartment (with two friends spending the night) just before 3 AM...you know it was a good party!

        MY BIRTHDAY!!!!       Well, I am now 23...it really is one of those ages that amounts to absolutely nothing.  Anyway, I was very fortunate that my birthday fell on a Wednesday because that meant I got to celebrate my birthday at the boys school.  While I had absolutely nothing to do, I am incredibly happy just being there and was therefore definitely glad it was a 'visit school' day.    As far as the festivities, I went to a cozy little ramen shop with some of my closer friends here in Japan.  Over ramen and gyoza they tried to make a big deal out of my birthday (as they started doing in Okinawa) and continually reminded me of the quality of friends I have made here.  My birthday dinner was definitely a fun night out with the girls!    Oh yea, so I am used to St. Paddy`s Day being a big deal back in the U.S. and even when I was in Australia.  When all of my friends showed up at dinner and only one happened to be wearing green by mistake I was forced to give them a bit of a hard time.  It was then they all chimed in that they only know of March 17th as my birthday and the idea of it being a special day for some other reason never even crossed their minds.  How could I argue with that?!?!?!?

       OKINAWA  Well, yesterday I returned from a weekend trip to Okinawa (southernmost island of Japan) and must admit it was a great trip...just a little too short.  On Saturday morning, three friends and I left the cold of Miyagi in hopes of finding a little warmth and a relaxing escape from the march madness (or from going mad in march due to hours of complete boredom). Anyway, things I learned while in Okinawa....     1.  I really have made some incredible friends while here in Japan.  Everything was completely relaxed,             we were all open to just about anything and everything, and we shared a ton of laughs and made               quite a few lasting memories.   As I have realized throughout my life, it isn`t always where you are           but who you are with that makes all of the difference.  Viewing beautiful beaches and having nice           weather definitely does help though!     2.  I love driving!!!  Being the only member of the group with an international drivers license, I was the           designated driver for our entire stay in Okinawa.  Despite being on the opposite side of the car and          the road, driving has to be one of my favorite things.  It makes life so convenient!     3. In certain areas of Japan the people are some of the friendliest people in the world.  Maybe it`s the          tropical climate, but the people in Okinawa were always overly friendly and just enabled us to relax              and do as we pleased.     4. Having celebrated birthdays in different states across the US as well as in Australia, turning 23 in             Japan is going to be a pretty great birthday as well!!!!

      Hey everybody,    I now sit in an abandoned staff room with my jacket still on watching flurries fall.  This seems to be the general trend of winter days in Tohoku.  It is nearly as cold inside as it is outside and march is slowly passing with absolutely nothing to fill the hours spent at school.   Fortunately, last week I was able to escape my schools and spend a week showing my family a little of what life in Japan is about.      I travelled to Kyoto by Shinkansen and was able to be sitting on a bench patiently waiting when my family arrived on a later train.  While in Kyoto we saw Fushimi Inari which is a really impressive Temple with 1000's of Tori (red gates) lining a path up to the top of the mountain.  We also saw Kinkakuji (Golden Temple), Nijo-Jo (Nijo Castle) and Ginkakuji.  Perhaps one of my highlights of Kyoto was walking the streets of Gion on what you might call a Geisha hunt.  We actually did see about five geisha scurrying to their 6:30 appoinments which made the book Memoirs of a Geisha come to life.  Kyoto is definitely somewhat of a mystical city and it was nice to experience it with my parents and Dana!    Arriving back in Sendai, naturally it would be a bit colder and snow was falling.  It was now time for me to show the fam a little of my area and what life is like for me.  I brought my family to the boys school and I must say that the people at this school continually amaze me.  They very warmly welcomed my family, gave sweets and tea, escorted us on a tour of the building, and helped us make dinner reservations at a traditional Japanese restaurant for my family`s last dinner in Japan.  They really went above and beyond anything I could have expected.  I think my family could easily see why I am so happy at my visit school and the quality of friendships and co-worker relationships I have formed.     I also took my family to see Matsushima (1 of the 3 most beautiful places in Japan), Zuiganji Temple, Shiogama Shrine, and Yamadera which is a mountain actually in Yamagata Prefecture.  Yamadera was incredibly beautiful as we climbed to the top to see the mountains and village covered with snow.  I actually think Yamadera far surpasses Matsushima in beauty!  Of course we also spent a lot of time shopping in the various arcades and different areas of Sendai and my family spent about an hour cold and under the kotatsu (heated coffee table) in my apartment.  Another highlight was the dinners we had when my family was able to meet a few of the friends I have made while in Japan.  I think my family was able to gain a better understanding of what exactly living as a foreigner is like in this country.     I will say that having my family here reminded me of how difficult life was when I initially arrived in Japan and how far I have come in the past several months.  While I still don`t know nearly enough, I realized that I am able to speak and understand more than I usually am required to know and utilize on a regular basis.  However, what I did realize is that my knowledge of Japanese is a very practical knowledge and is based on what I personally need to know to get by without always requiring help from others.  Therefore, in terms of helping my family in restaurants, shopping, and getting from place to place my abilities were often limited.  Basically I came to the conclusion that I know what I know and that as I have tried to explain in emails and over the phone, the way things happen in Japan do so for no apparent reason.  You just have to except everything for the way it is and also accept when certain things can`t be done.  Only after living in this country for a few months is one able to see this country for what its worth and accept it just because you know you have no other option.        I do want to say to my family that it was great having you here in Japan.  I am not sure where I`ll be going next but I know I can always count on my family supporting me in whatever I choose and then coming to visit once I am there!

        China      Hey everyone, I wanted to post about some of the recent events but unfortunately haven`t had the chance.  When I return from China I will do my best to update you on Steph`s bday celebration and how boys will be boys...   Now I just wanted to let you know that on Thursday I will be heading to China and will not return to Japan until the 10th of May.  Elizabeth and I have been watching the news and are fully aware of the recent SARS outbreak and will definitely be taking the necessary precautions.  I am really excited and can`t wait to share some of the details upon my return to Japan.  Hope everything is well with all of you!

       Things that make you go hmmm      I will be the first to admit that today has been quite a strange day. Not really sure why but hopefully my posts will return to things you actually care about and this is the first step in regaining a little focus.  Anyway, I was navigating my way through a certain internet site and came across the question what do you hate the most about Japan.  One quite witty (I must give credit where credit is due) individual wrote:   1st world prices 2nd world housing 3rd world mentality     Now I will be honest...I laughed the first time I read it but then actually started thinking about it. There are many things I have come to love and hate over the past 9 months.  Yes, Japan is quite expensive, apartments/houses have paper thin walls, no yards, and no central heating, and many things occur here just because that is the way it has been for years even if there might be a better and more efficient way.  However, perhaps these are the things that allow us to then see all the really unique, fascinating aspects of Japan.  And perhaps these things are part of what sets Japan apart from the rest of the world.  Yes homogeneity can be a bad thing, but Japan is now a country that offers a great deal that can't be experienced anywhere else in the world.  I think the trick with truly enjoying and coming to terms with life in Japan, is not to compare it to anywhere else because you really can't.  I have tried to break Japan down into smaller more comprehensible parts that one would think would then go back together to create a whole image.  Unfortunately, I don't think that is really possible with Japan.  It is probably a country that I will never understand completely and probably never could even if I lived here for years.  So again I return to what I have said many times before, Japan is just this incomprehensible place, a bit majical and mystical at times, but a place within which one can find happiness, rich cultural traditions, and a life different than one that can be experienced anywhere else in the world.  I think it is time to stop breaking things down into good and bad terms, but to just smile and accept things the way they are because  THIS IS JAPAN !

       Still bored???          Apparently I am too...just a bit.  I do have my class of the day in 40 minutes as the english club girls decided to skip my english club meeting that was supposed to occur this morning before 1st period.  No complaints on my part about that however as I am quite tired.  So anyway, see how you do with these questions... Funny Quiz   Q: How do you put a giraffe into a refrigerator?  The correct answer is: Open the refrigerator, put in the giraffe and close the door. This question tests whether you tend to do simple things in an overly complicated way.   Q: How do you put an elephant into a refrigerator?  WRONG Answer: Open the refrigerator, put in the elephant and close the refrigerator. CORRECT Answer: Open the refrigerator, take out the giraffe, put in the elephant and close the door. This tests your ability to think through the repercussions of your actions.   3. The Lion King is hosting an animal conference. All the animals attend except one. Which animal does not attend?  Correct Answer: The Elephant. The Elephant is in the refrigerator. This tests your memory. OK, even if you did not answer the first three questions correctly, you still have one more chance to show your abilities.   4. There is a river you must cross. But it is inhabited by crocodiles. How do you manage it?  Correct Answer: You swim across. All the Crocodiles are attending the Animal Meeting.   This tests whether you learn quickly from your mistakes. According to Andersen Consulting Worldwide, around 90% of the professionals they tested got all questions wrong. But many preschoolers got several correct answers. Anderson Consulting says this conclusively disproves the theory that most professionals have the brains of a four year old.

       SEX and THE CITY!!!      Haha!  Don't get too excited and get your mind out of the gutter.  Well, Saturday night was designated a movie night at my apartment so most of the day was spent cleaning (well the first half was sleeping as I was a little tired).  The number of attendees had dropped and so it was a quaint group consisting of me, Steph and Kristel.  With Sex and the City in my dvd player, Pizza Hut pizza delivered promptly, and a little bailey's and icecream, the night was a ton of fun and a nice change of pace.  We actually watched the entire season 5 and when it ended Steph and Kristel realized they missed their train home and would have to taxi it back.  Luckily they live only 10 minutes away!  So yea, a nice end to a crazy week.

         BUSY BUSY BUSY       Essentially, last week my apartment was abandoned (more or less of course).  I must admit at times I think about my life here in Japan and suddenly awaken to the fact that currently life is pretty good.  The fact that at the end of one week I could have no plans for the next one and then suddenly have every night booked is kind of amazing.  So what did I do last week...Monday was my trip to Shiogama Shrine and a ramen dinner with Jemma and Steph, Tuesday was yakiniku with Danola, Wednesday was spent in Sendai eating soba and having a drink with Sharon, Thursday was with Kristel, Steph and Danola at Milky Way, and Friday was in Sendai for Sharons farewell dinner with Jess, Kristel, Steph, Richard, John and Oliver followed by a nomihodai with Steph, Sharon and Oliver and a whole new crew.  Anyway, on to a different story.    To put it quite simply, Japan is a pretty safe country.  It could potentially be disastrous when I move elsewhere and my safe little bubble affectionately known as Japan is gone.  On Friday night after Steph and I ran (literally sprinted) to catch the last train home, we boarded a train that would happen to have the scariest individual I have encountered in my 9 months here.  This man was kicking and punching the inside walls of the train.  Then, as Steph and I squatted quietly against the wall trying not to call attention to ourselves or make eye contact, the man spoke to us...in ENGLISH!  He began uttering things like "what you say" and "baby" and snapping his fingers quite loudly in my face as we tried to ignore his comments.  He continued kicking things and yelling stuff at us and when I looked up to my left a young Japanese girl gave me a smile as if she understood our situation completely. Then came the final remarks that drove us to the other end of the train.  Still squatting, the man then made a comment about how we weren`t listening and could not understand him.  Then he randomly throughout the country Israel.  I was a bit shocked to say the least.  Of all countries to randomly suggest he chose that one!  I looked down to see what I was wearing and if I had anything on me that would call for such a statement and couldn't figure it out.  But it was then that I turned to Steph, told her we were relocating, and quickly moved through the crowded train to the other end of the car.  He is definitely someone I hope to never encounter again!!!

       And now deep thoughts...     Being surrounded by so many people with different accents, my accent has definitely turned into something kind of strange.  I hear myself say things and am shocked because it doesn't sound like it should be coming out of my mouth.  After four years in Wisconsin, I am not sure if the time away has brought the southern accent to the forefront again or if the Brits I am running around with here are having more of an effect on me than I am on them.  But it isn't just the accent, the word intonations as well as in some instances my initial choice of words is something completely different.  On to some examples...       Example 1 - So I am hanging out with a couple of friends and one of them is                   chatting with a guy.  I then go on to give her a bit of a hard time and to ensure she knows I                am just teasing a bit, I then state that I am " just taking the piss out of                her ."  I don't think that expression will be welcomed when I return to the U.S.      Example 2-  So I am hanging out with random friends and in order to make a               decision about where to eat I ask them if they  fancy  doing italian...I don`t               think I ever used the word fancy in the U.S.      Example 3 - Now when I find certain individuals to be really nice and inviting, they               are no longer nice or cool or really friendly.  Now these people are described as                  lovely .  Oh yea, and I now describe a really good meal as nice or lovely as               well.       Example 4  - Males are no longer hot or good looking or really attractive...they are                FIT !  Fit is apparently the all encompassing term.       Example 5 -  I now sometimes even use words like going to the loo, standing in a              queue, taking the lift, or even saying "do you reckon" on occasion.   So anyway, when I really think about it, I now see how babies suddenly go from not speaking at all, to knowing several words and then soon enough they are talking.  That`s kind of what I have done here.  When I first arrived I could barely even say hello in Japanese and so I was often the silent one in restaurants or shopping and so on because I depended on other people to communicate on my behalf.  Then slowly I learned the most important daily vocabulary words and some key phrases and slowly started forming basic sentences. Now, while I still do not know nearly as much as I should, I can ask for directions, order food, read signs (as long as they are not in kanji), etc.  So basically, what I went through the first couple years of my life I kind of went through all over again.  The weird thing is that in many ways the impact all of my friends are having on the words I use, the intonation, and even the accent a bit when I am speaking english, kind of makes me realize how language develops and people's individual ways of speaking are all connected or a result of the surrounding environment and community.

        HANAMI PARTIES GALORE!        Well, I can now say that I have experienced both a night time and day time Hanami party!  Or in english terminology a picnic/drinking party under the trees.  As the seconds on the clock were slowly ticking away my last hour of the day yesterday, I was given something to look forward to as soon as I was able to head out into the sunshine and beautiful weather.  Through text messages on our keitais and a couple of phone calls, Stephanie, Jemma and I were going to meet at Shiogama Shrine to enjoy the great outdoors.  Stephanie and I of course stopped at the convenient store to pick up some snacks and what turned out to be a pretty bad bottle of wine.  Anyway, maybe it's the fresh air and the opportunity to relax outside that hit us quite hard, but it ended up being a 3 1/2 hour venture filled with random movie quotes, even more random song lyrics, and laughing so much it hurt.  And no it was NOT the wine because I didn't even have a full glass! It is incredibly nice to have good friends you can call at the end of the work day (whether it was a really good day or an awful one) who are just as eager to meet up, relax, and have a few laughs over snacks and eventually dinner.

        It's not all concrete!!!       Having lived in Japan for a significant amount of time now, I have come to seriously dislike concrete.  There is just way too much of it here.  Having already been to Nikko, Okinawa, Matsushima, and Kyoto, I was well aware that there are some really beautiful places in Japan.  Fortunately, I can now experience nature at its finest in my area.      With spring comes the cherry blossoms.  If you think the leaves changing in the fall are really beautiful, you would find the blooming of cherry blossoms incredible.  As the cherry blossoms are only in full bloom for an incredibly short amount of time, everyone heads outside for drinking parties under the trees.  Yes,   everyone!   The kind of funny thing is that parties begin early in the morning and go late into the night.   On Saturday night after the wine tasting, somehow Kristel, Sharon and I ended up on a train with a bunch of Sendai-city Jets and we were heading away from my apartment.  We then got off at Tsutsujigaoka and realized that before heading to the park, we needed to stock up on a little more alcohol.  We spotted the trusty 7-11 and because of course we had not already had enough wine earlier in the evening, we bought a bottle with a nice screw cap and a stack of cups.  As we were leaving they gave me a hard time because I picked out the cups that were 40 yen more expensive but later they realized my wisdom when they witnessed how nice it was to distinguish who had what based on different color cups.  4 years at UW definitely paid off!      When we arrived at the park there were people everywhere! We had made some Japanese friends (very loose definition of the word friend - Kevin, my friend from Jamaica started dancing when reggae was coming quite loudly from their car) and as we made our way through the masses we saw a half empty tarp with the reggae guys sitting on the other half.   How we lucked out I have no idea but it meant we all had a nice place to sit and enjoy the cherry blossoms.  Yes, you can enjoy them even at 11PM.  Unfortunately, our night had to end a bit on the early side as Kristel and I had to catch the last train home because Sharon had been sick all week and therefore her apartment was not going to be the best place for us to crash.  I am still not sure what made Kristel and I get on the train that night but I am definitely glad I did!

       Hmmm...Wine...Lots of it!!!      Okie dokie, so on Saturday night I went to a German wine tasting.  Yes, I know I am in Japan but that's just the type of wine they were featuring. After some brief explanations on how to evaluate the different types and the proper ways of tasting, the drinking began.  Well, the night potentially could have included 10 different types of white wine.  However, after having tried 8 and then been told the two remaining were not the greatest, I decided to return to my favorites for a second taste just to confirm my original thoughts.  While I had arrived at the wine tasting with Jemma and her JTE (Yuko couldn't make it in the end due to a funeral), I left the wine tasting with Kristel and Sharon.  With a nice little buzz going, somehow the night managed to continue but for that you will have to continue reading another post (or perhaps you have already read based on the way this thing posts).

        Passover       So this morning I called home to say hello and to have a couple of questions answered.  Little did I know that at that moment my family and some of our closest family friends would be sitting down to begin the Passover Seder.  I chatted briefly with my mom and then my brother before having to allow them to return to the festivities.  Being so wrapped up in life in Japan, where I am going from here, and just day to day things, you sometimes forget about certain times when the rest of your family(or part of your family) is getting together and that in fact you are missing more things then you may have really considered.    Having been in Japan for over 8 months, I have missed seeing my neice grow from when she was about 10 weeks old to now almost a year.  I have missed holidays, weddings of family friends, birthdays, and I am sure this list goes on and on.  However I have also realized that perhaps this year has been an invaluable experience for me as I ventured to a quite unfamiliar world, have learned a bit of the language, lived completely alone for the first time ever, and have been able to support myself in the lifestyle that I want.       Anyway, I am not really sure where I am going with this except for perhaps that I want everyone back in the U.S. to realize that I am thinking about all of you, what you are up to, the things that I am missing as a result of my quest for adventure, etc..

        This Lifestyle Can`t Last Forever!       I guess one could quite easily say that I have been bit by the travel bug and just can`t manage to recover.  I love exploring different parts of the world, meeting incredible people, and just having amazing experiences and learning about myself, the people around me, and just life in general.  However, I have recently been reminded of why this can`t go on forever (well there are many reasons but this is the one I am thinking of now).    When I left Australia I had to say goodbye to some incredible people.  People who had such a major impact on my life in general.  Now I am realizing that once again some very hard goodbye`s are beginning. I said goodbye to a couple of teachers last week and soon I will be saying goodbye to one of my closest friends in Japan.  I now realize that if I were to continue this lifestyle for too long, I would continually be meeting incredible people and then as soon as close relationships were formed, I would be leaving and moving on to somewhere else.  I think after a little while I will be tired of having to stay in touch with friends and family in the U.S. through emails and phone calls and having loads of friends scattered around the world but who I rarely ever get to see.      I am not ready to settle down just yet, but I am beginning to realize that with this type of lifestyle comes many really incredible things but there are also some things that this lifestyle prevents. These things might just be the most important or valuable things to me and my future!

       Gyoza Party!        Okay...so the food in Japan comes in both very good and incredibly disgusting forms.  Luckily I have found enough things that I really enjoy to maintain a little variety in my daily meals.  Yesterday, Yuko picked me up from Teizan and she and I headed to the Tagajo Co-Op to load up on the necessary ingredients that would shortly thereafter become my first attempt at cooking something that doesn`t come in a ready-made package or from the local convenient store.  Then we headed to Nitanai-senseis apartment and began to cook!    Actually, I first watched Yuko chop all sorts of things including cabbage, garlic, ginger, some strange Chinese vegetable, another strange Japanese vegetable...you get the idea.   Then came the fun part.  For those of you who don`t know, gyoza are basically the equivalent of a Chinese dumpling.  With these little circles of dough or something along those lines, I learned the art of folding gyoza.  Unfortunately, mine didn`t come out quite as nicely as theirs but I think that is due to years of practice folding the origami papers.  After making 41, it then was time to throw them in the frying pan and watch them cook.    Apparently a slight mistake was made in the final step and they were laughing because things didn`t come out the way they should have.  I didn`t notice anything wrong and was actually quite impressed that we had made 2 different types.  We then enjoyed our gyoza while watching this crazy Japanese competition on TV and after 5 hours I was finally returned home.  All in all another great evening in Japan!

        MY NEW SCHEDULE!       Well, last Friday I found out my new schedule.  It looks like I am going to be a lot busier my last few months in Japan.  Last year I had a maximum of 11 classes per week and having all 11 was pretty rare. In fact I was lucky when I had 5-6.  Now, I am scheduled to have 16 classes a week as well as a mandatory once a week Teizan english club meeting before classes start.  On Thursdays I will actually have 6 classes...yes, that is one during every class period.  Yuko (my JTE at the boys school) thought I was joking when I told her that I was teaching that many classes in a single day at Teizan and then went on to say that I wouldn`t be able to teach at Shiogama boys on Friday after that type of day.  I guess time will tell!   So anyway, that`s 16 classes, 10 at Teizan and 6 at Shiogama Boys which will be taught with 5 different Japanese teachers.  I will be teaching English communication classes as well as English I classes at Teizan and at the boys school I will be teaching 4 1st year communication classes and two 2nd year commercial classes (classes for students who do not plan to go to university).  Wish me luck!   Oh yea, so now I might not have as much free time to spend on the internet.  I will be at Teizan on mondays, tuesdays and thursdays and at the boys school on Wednesday anf Friday.  They really wanted to make my life difficult as one school starts at 9:15 now and the other I have to be there by 8:25!  Lets hope I can keep my days straight.

        Nikko!           Saturday morning bright and early (I caught the 7:06 train to Sendai) Sharon, Stephania, Danola, Kristel and I began our weekend trip to Nikko.  Sharon was once again my trusty navigator as I have gotten very used to having her in the front seat telling me where to turn and translating the signs that I can`t understand.  About 3 hours later and a little over 5,000 yen spent in tolls, we had arrived just in time for a delicious ramen lunch.             Anyway, as far as Nikko, our afternoon was spent viewing some really impressive temples and shrines.  We were also supposed to see lots of monkeys and were warned to guard our possessions but the only monkey`s we saw were carved into a wall and were the hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil monkeys.  We definitely took a picture assuming the same stances as the monkeys so hopefully soon I will be able to provide a link to my photos.  After a few hours of walking, we then headed to a coffee shop followed by a pretty relaxing Italian dinner.  Then it was back to our Ryokan (Japanese style inn) where I quickly passed out.  I was just a little tired to say the least.        On Day 2 the weather was a bit dreary but we managed to make the best of it.  We drove up this huge mountain where everything was covered with snow and it was actually raining/snowing while I drove.  As most of you are probably aware, driving in snow and ice is probably my worst nightmare after the experiences of driving in Wisconsin!  Luckily it wasn`t too bad and slow and steady wins the race.  After a scenic drive we headed back into Nikko for lunch and then began the drive home in the rain.          All in all it was a great weekend and incredibly nice to be out of Miyagi even if it was only for about 36 hours.  Again I was with a great group of people and we were all looking for just a relaxing escape and to see one of the more famous attractions in Japan.   　  　If you would like a brief description of Nikko you can go to www.japan-guide.com but for some unknown reason the link won`t work at this time. Gomen ne!!!  (sorry in Japanese)

        ALL IN GOOD FUN!!!!       Hmmm...April Fools Day in Japan.  I must admit that being in Japan is a lot like being on a rollercoaster.  Tons of ups and downs with now being one of the down times for a lot of Miyagi Jets.  As many were forced to say goodbye to their favorite teachers, some also went on to realize that this is just the beginning of 4 months of goodbyes.  Anyway, Jemma and I decided to have a little April Fools day fun.     Anxiously awaiting Stephanie`s arrival at our local Milky Way (local restaurant with picture menu!), Jemma and I decided we were going to mastermind a little trick since Steph was late arriving.  When Stephanie finally joined us I quickly excused myself to let Jemma initiate our plan.  Well, this past Tuesday I had an enkai which generally means everyone is incredibly drunk.  Jemma told Stephanie not to say anything to me because I was really stressed about it and that Dave had tried to initiate something between us (use your imagination).  I was very impressed when I returned and for 15 minutes Stephanie didn`t say anything or even have a silly smirk like I probably would have.  So finally I had to say something.  I did the whole embarrassed routine and had her believing everything and getting excited about the prospect of my return to Teizan and my first day with Dave since the "incident."  She was saying how excited she was when Jemma and I decided to reveal that in fact we were quite excited because the joke was on her!!!  Mission accomplished!     Having successfully accomplished one april fools joke, the three of us then teamed up and decided to get Dave.  Once again we succeeded.  It is amazing how excited people get at the prospect of some really shocking gossip! Anyway, I must say that having a little childish fun in a seemingly more trying time definitely makes you look toward the lighter side of things.  As Jemma and my other Brit friends would say, we definitely took the piss out of Stephanie and Dave!!!

      Well, since Lock Up was out of the question, we were on a quest to find another place to eat and we were all quite hungry. All of a sudden an idea popped into my head.  Last fall I had been to a garlic restaurant for Laura's birthday and the food was quite good.  The only problem was that now I had to find it again and when I left that other time we had been having a nomihodai (all you can drink with a set course brought out) and so I wasn't exactly paying much attention to where we were.  Anyway, I successfully found it!!!  The food was just incredible.  There were so many things we wanted to try.  We ended up with some pasta, garlic toast, shrimp in a garlic hot chili sauce, cheese fondue, karubi steak, and really spicy fried rice.  It was definitely SHIAWASE (just a complete state of happiness).  I don't think I have enjoyed any other meal in Japan the way we all enjoyed this one.  We would eat one thing and then rave about it only to do the same thing for the next item.  Our table was definitely crowded as the dishes were in the center and we each had our own collection of little bowls since you put each thing in a different little dish as to not mix things.  Stuffed, we decided to go bowling and had quite a good time there as well.  Definitely a fun, relaxing night out with the girls!!!

      Several weeks ago Steph, Danola, Kristel and I had written in our Jet diaries that we would have dinner at Lock Up on Saturday night.  Well, on Friday night Danola made me call the restaurant to make the reservation because she finally talked to Jemma and now knew how many of us could go.  They made me call because neither one of them wanted to have to speak Japanese and since I had been drinking for a couple hours at the enkai, I really wasn't bothered by having to call.  Anyway, we met at the Disney Store and headed to where it used to be.  Yea, not there anymore.  We called the restaurant and they told us it was on the third floor of the building.  Unfortunately, Lock Up is no longer there and a new Chinese Restaurant had taken our reservation.  Not really wanting Chinese food, we headed back down to the street on a quest for a good meal.  We were definitely a bit disappointed as Lock Up is supposed to be really cool because they handcuff you and every table is in a jail cell and the waiters are dressed appropriately and so it is quite an amusing evening.  Oh well...

      Saturday morning I woke up quite early because I was supposed to meet Jamie at Tagajo station to head over to soccer practice.  We had the field reserved from 9:30-1.  Well, at 10:30 Jamie sent me a mail saying she was running a little late and that she would get there a little after 11.  Richard arrived at the station asking me where the field was and I told him I only knew the name but not how to get there.  Rob had told him to call as soon as he arrived at the station but both Rob and Dave were not answering their keitais.  So, at 12 PM Jamie finally arrived with Dominik, Aurora, and Karen and we hopped in cabs and headed to the field.  We practiced for about an hour and 1/2 (noone came to kick us off the field) and then Aurora and I headed to Stephanie's because we thought we were going climbing in Sendai.  All a bit tired, we didn't quite make it.  While I am talking about soccer adventures, on Sunday I caught a train heading up north to Tajiri and ended up on the same train as Jamie.  She and I were the first to arrive but neither of us had a ball since hers had exploded in the back of Dave's car.  We knew two balls would be arriving with Steph and Aurora but their train would not arrive until 1:40 and ours got in at 12:51.  We walked to the field and soon after were met by Jess, Ang, Mike, and Yasir.  None of them had a ball either so we all just hung out in the grass (a rarity in Japan) and waited for the other two to arrive.  We finally were able to practice, were joined at one point by 5 young Japanese boys (10,11, and 12 years old) and played a small game.  These little Japanese boys in many ways prevented some of us from really getting to practice because they liked to show off their skills so eventually the girls separated from the boys and worked on shooting and corner kicks.  Once the little guys left Mike and Yasir joined us to finish up some drills. Exhausted and a bit scraped up we finally left for home!  It is hard to believe in 2 weeks we will be playing in a tournament but I think the girls team might be quite good.

      Well, last week I was invited to attend the enkai for all of the sports coaches at Shiogama Boys.  While I was a little confused as to why I was invited (obviously don't work with any of the sports teams and no english teachers were going to be there), I decided it would be a fun night and a good opportunity to practice my Japanese.  So...on Friday night I walked to a yakiniku (korean barbecue) restaurant on the other side of Shiogama.  I was then greeted by the kocho sensei (principal) and kyoto sensei (VP) and headed inside.  I was the only English teacher there and was therefore doing most of the communicating in Japanese.  Nitanai-sensei (one of the female teachers) arrived and sat next to me since she and I hang out a lot and were the only two females there.  I had the kyoto sensei to my left and the kocho sensei directly across from me.  For two hours we ate lots of meat and drank lots of alcohol.  I told them I was only going to drink a little as I had a weekend of soccer practice but they didn't want to let that happen.  For two hours different senseis came over and chatted with me about everything and anything inviting me to attend all sorts of sporting events or just to try a couple of them to see what they are like.  At enkais you tend to get a lot of invitations with very little follow through because there exists the rule of enkais stating that anything that is said or goes on should never be brought up again.  This isn't always upheld especially when a foreigner is involved.  Everything we do and say tends to be brought up again but they are all worry free because you don't talk about enkais after...craziness I tell you! So, when the two hours ended, I found my way to Danola's apartment where she and Jemma had been having their own little party.  Definitely an entertaining evening...

      Last night I ventured to Rifu to see the movie TROY!  Yuko and I picked up Steph from Hon Shiogama (train station closest to my apt) and headed into Rifu.  We decided to buy our tickets first because 1)it was ladies day which means females pay 1,000 yen instead of the usual 1800 and 2) in many theaters in Japan you have to chose your seats.  Yes, reserved seating in movies theaters!  We then walked across the parking lot to a ramen shop and quickly ate and then returned to the movie theater to meet a couple other teachers.  Needless to say the movie was really good and Brad Pitt was definitely worthy of writing home about.  After the movie we ventured over to Coco's Cafe for dessert and at nearly 11 PM I ended up back in my apartment ready to crash.  When you leave at 7:40 AM and get home at 11 PM,it is quite the long day.  The teachers at Shiogama Boys are so much fun.  I will definitely be missing all of the jokes and crazy antics that always seem to occur when Yuko, Nitanai sensei and I are together.

      I must admit that the grass is greener...anywhere outside of Japan.  Over the past two weeks it has become increasingly apparent that this country lacks grass.  For miles and miles one can find nothing but concrete.  Why is this such a problem you ask???  Well, Miyagi Jets are now training on the weekends for the upcoming soccer tournament in Nagano.  Unfortunately, finding a suitable location is nearly impossible.  Basically, there are two places we can rent (yes, we have to pay to play) in our entire prefecture that have any grass. And in fact, one of these fields is not even completely covered in grass.  Last week we were forced to play at a high school and EVERY high school in Miyagi has dirt fields.  This is due to the fact that it is easier and cheaper to maintain, and all sports teams (baseball, soccer...) all practice and play on the same fields.  So, in a country covered in concrete and rice fields, it aint easy finding green.

      In three days I will have been in Japan (or Asia at least) for 10 months.  I will admit that I am really excited to be heading back to the U.S, even if only for a month, come the end of July.  This might sound a bit strange but one of the things I am most looking forward to (of course after seeing friends and family) is being just another face in the crowd.  So many people in the U.S. go through great lengths to stand out, but I am anxious just to blend in.  I am anxious to go to the grocery store and not have people watching me and to walk down a street and have noone look or think twice.  In Japan many argue that the Japanese try to ensure that the nail that sticks out gets hammered down.  Unfortunately, this doesn't extend to foreigners as it just isn't possible to implement.  So while sometimes this celebrity status foreigners often carry in Japan can be nice, the novelty wears off and you suddenly find yourself just wanting to get lost in a crowd!

      Hey y'all!  Guess what?  The moment many of you have been waiting for has finally arrived.  My pictures are now online and you can check them out if you'd like.  There are several albums for my China trip as well as pictures from different events and experiences in Japan. All you have to do is check out this web address: www.ofoto.com, type in my email address (friedmanlindsey@lycos.com) and type in the password  linzinjapan .  Enjoy my photos!!!  I tried to set it up as a link but for some reason it didn't want to work for me.  Unfortunately not all of the pictures are labeled yet because the titles didn't transfer from my cd to ofoto...I am going to do my best to get as many of them labeled as possible.  Oh yea, the southeast Asia winter trip pictures(Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore) are not posted yet.  Sorry but I felt a bit guilty after spending the entire morning at school uploading pictures.

      Hey everybody, for those of you who read the next post 1st...you were probably wondering why I went to a soccer practice.  For those of you reading this one first, guess what???  Next you will be reading about my journey to and from soccer practice.  Well, in the middle of June, I along with 20+ Miyagi jets will be headed to Nagano for a soccer tournament.  Miyagi will be sending both a girls and boys team to compete.  Neither one is expecting to make a great showing but we will do our best.  To check out what this tournament is all about check out www.naganosoccertournament.com.

      Okay, so this is not what you are thinking...this past Saturday I went to a soccer practice and was offered a ride to the field (about an hour north in Tajiri) by Dave.  Naturally, Dave arrived a bit late with Robin in the front seat. The two of them together are definitely good for a bunch of laughs.  The ride home was definitely quite a fun disaster of a trip.  Rob, another Shiogama resident, joined us for the return trip.  Dave decided that there had to be a shorter route home than the one we took to Tajiri.  Unfortunately, we were in the inaka (rural japan) and were seemingly driving in circles in the middle of rice fields.  We stopped to check the map, stopped to ask directions a few times, and basically did everything imaginable to try and find a particular road.  Robin was throwing raisins at Dave's head claiming that whatever way the raisins bounced off was the direction we should head.  Rob claimed that Dave and Robins maturity level drops about 10 years when they are together and Robin countered that by saying that Robs increases by about 20 and acts like their dad.  I just laughed.  Finally, in the middle of a rice field there was a random sign that had the kanji (chinese characters) for Shiogama.  We decided to follow the sign and after going down a narrow road, we reached the end and were faced with deciding right or left with not another sign in sight.  Honestly, who designed this country without road signs anywhere except big cities?!?!?!? We ended up finding our way, ran into two more Jets on the side of the road in kashimadai who we stopped to talk to for 30 minutes, and eventually I arrived at Steph's an hour late for our dinner/movie night.  She and Kristel were starving and had already taken care of ordering food so 10 minutes after I arrived we were enjoying dinner and watching several episodes of  Queer Eye for the Straight Guy .  All in all a pretty eventful day!

      Sitting in China was definitely a bit surreal at times.  I was sitting in a country I never thought I would actually be in with a friend I had met the day before flying out of Chicago.  One night Elizabeth, Mike (lives in the same city in Iwate-Ken as Elizabeth) and I were sitting down at dinner when we suddenly realized just how unbelievable our lives have become in the past 9 and 1/2 months.  I have been in 5 different countries since leaving the U.S. the end of July last year.  Sitting in a restaurant in China, we realized that at that very moment we had friends in Vietnam, Thailand, South Korea, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, the Philippines, Papa New Guinea, Australia, South Africa, England, Japan, the US, and I am sure other places I can't think of at the moment.  I guess the JET program consists of a lot of very similar people with the same adventurous mindset, curiosity about the world we live in, and the same passion for traveling as I have undoubtedly developed. The friends I have made here in Japan are all so different with amazing stories and experiences to share.  We all come from different countries, vary in age, and have had different experiences, yet we are all quite comfortable setting out on unknown adventures, leaving the familiar behind, and just trying to live a life in which we constantly are able to do the things we love.  We are all so different yet so similar and perhaps that is why everyday here in Japan there lies an opportunity to discover something new.  I think my problem is that with every trip and experience abroad, I learn of new places I want to see and experience.  In China I met people from Chile, Colombia, Poland, Sweden, Israel, Wales, Australia, and again more places I can't think of at the moment. I find myself quite excited about all of the traveling I have done, but also a bit jealous of others who are traveling around the world for several months and hitting every continent.  I think I am going to have to settle down soon and get a real job if one day I hope to be able to set-off on an around the world journey and not end up broke after the first stop!

        CHINA!!!      Hey everyone!  Well, I have now returned from my adventures through Shanghai and Beijing.  It was definitely quite a trip.  It is amazing how different China and Japan are and in many ways this trip enabled me to appreciate many aspects of Japan a lot more.  It also made me realize that over the past 9 1/2 months Japan has definitely come to feel like home.      On to China details...well, we landed in Shanghai after 3 hours on a plane and were quite excited but were immediately faced with the language barrier as we tried to make our way to our hotel. We then learned to always get a card from the hotel and have them write in Chinese characters where we wanted to go. We were then able to just hand it to a cab driver and we were on our way.  We accumulated quite a few cards!!! While in Shanghai we saw the Shanghai Acrobats (really impressive), went to an aquarium, did a day tour out of the city to view some gardens and an old town known as the Venice of China, toured the Bund Area (water front area), went to the Shanghai museum, to the Jade Buddha Temple, and pretty much just wandered around the city a bit.  At times it was quite frustrating as cabs wouldn't always stop for us, people at times could be quite pushy and rude, we were constantly being stared at in a quite uncomfortable way, and apparently spitting is a national sport. I pretty much decided that I wasn't going to let it get to me and was therefore able to accept it as being part of the China experience and not enable those things to prevent me from seeing all of the great things China and Chinese culture has to offer.      On to Beijing...well, we boarded an overnight train and arrived in Beijing 12 hours later.  We made our way to a hotel a lot more easily and were excited to begin our explorations of a new city.  While in Beijing we saw the Beijing Acrobats (incredible!!!), toured Tianenman Square, the Forbidden City, the Temple of Heaven, the Summer Palace (huge and unbelievably beautiful...had the longest painted covered walkway in the world as well as a marble boat), and did a Hutong Tour which is a tour of one of the original Chinese neighborhoods and we were able to go into a tradition style house and meet and talk with the head of the household.  We obviously also made a trip to the Great Wall.  I can totally understand why the Great Wall is one of the 7 Wonders of the World.  We went to the site at Mutianyu and took a chair lift up the mountain.  We then walked along the great wall with China on one side and Mongolia on the other.  Elizabeth and I continually just stopped walking to take in our surroundings and to realize that we were in fact standing on the Great Wall!  It was incredible!!!  To return back to the bottom there was a metal track and we were able to Toboggan down. Also a lot of fun but the people who went down right before us were a bit slow so we were constantly having to slow down on the track.  All in all an amazing experience at the Great Wall!!!   While in China we of course sampled all sorts of Chinese food.  We had Sichuan, Peking Duck, Mongolian Hot Pot, Cantonese style, Mandarin style...basically a ton of Chinese food and I have now definitely had my fill for a little while.  Anyway, I wanted to give all of you a brief overview of my trip to China but if you are curious to know more just send me an email and I would be very excited and happy to share with you more of the details!!!

       POST-JAPAN!!!     Well, I guess some of you might be wondering about my Post-Japan plans as my contract here will end on July 27th.  It's amazing that I have almost spent an entire year here.  Anyway, I have now accepted a job that will in fact lead me to Europe for a September 1st starting date.  I will be working privately for a family that lives in both Spain and Switzerland. They go back and forth between the two and I will of course go back and forth with them.  My responsibilities are a bit interesting to say the least. This family has a live-in babysitter and live-in domestic help so I won't be doing much of any of that stuff. My responsibilities will be helping them with English, driving the kids places and hanging out with them, and just basically being around when they need me.  There are 4 kids that range in age from 9 1/2 to 13 and they are all therefore in school for at least 7 hours a day.  It should be an interesting experience and hopefully give me ample time to travel as well as work on my Spanish a bit.   Now I guess some of you are wondering where exactly in Spain and Switzerland I will be.  While in Spain I will be living in Ibiza, a nice Island in the middle of the mediterranean 90 kilometers off of the east coast of Spain.  It is one of the Balearic Islands.  To read a bit about this destination (quite the tourist and party island) just click on this link  urlLink www.ibiza-spotlight.com .    In Switzerland I will be living in Neuchatel.  It is 25 miles (40 km) to the west of Bern. Neuchatel, the cantonal seat, is situated at the foot of the Jura Mountains on one of the largest lakes in Switzerland. The city is acclaimed academically because of its outstanding prep schools and university. It's also said that the purest French spoken in Switzerland is spoken in Neuchatel.      So that's a little bit of info on my life after Japan.  I will be in the U.S. in the end of July and all of August and hope to see as many of you as possible.  Right now my plans include a stop in Chicago and Atlanta before returning home.

       Boys Will Be Boys!     As promised, here is a little insight into life at Shiogama Boys High School.  Well, with April came tons of new first year students, a schedule consisting of 6 classes (only there 2 days a week), and team-teaching with different Japanese teachers of English (JTE`s).      Anyway, the first lesson for each class consisted of my self-introduction.  I had created 40 flash cards, 28 with questions to ask me and 12 cards of questions students had to answer about themselves.  There are 40 students in each class so each student was randomly given 1 card.  The cards were numbered and card by card each student had to stand and ask me a question or offer information about their likes and dislikes while I responded with maps, pictures, etc on the board.  Well, in my second year commercial class, a student stood up and told me that his favorite color is blue.  As I began to repeat his answer so everyone could hear it clearly, he started yelling "wait! wait!" in English.  I had no choice but to wait and he had effectively gained the attention of every student. He then went on to say "And my favorite woman is Lindsey" in perfect English.  I was a little embarrassed to say the least.      As my British friends would say, my boys are quite cheeky.  After the presentation part, the students all had a worksheet to fill out.  The top half about me and the bottom half about them.  When I returned to the staff room I could not have imagined what I was sitting down to read and mark.  Lindsey was some of the boys favorite food, one students favorite sport is masturbation... I of course then went and showed Yuko and a few of the other teachers and we all had a few laughs in the teachers room. I am in for a few interesting months at the boys school!

      Three days a week I am forced to walk about 30 minutes to and from school.  During the winter months I occupied that time listening to Jack Johnson.  Recently I have filled that time with either talking to friends or making a mental note of everything I need to accomplish.  On Tuesday my walk was definitely one of the best.   About 1/2 way through my walk home, I looked to the right and saw these two cute little japanese girls playing with a rabbit.  The girls saw me and smiled and I heard a little konnichiwa from the smaller of the two.  I smile back, said both konnichiwa and hello and then continued on my walk.  After about 10 feet, I heard some steps behind me and a very quiet hello.  I turned around to see the smaller of the two standing right behind me.  I took off my sunglasses and kneeled down in order to be more at her level since approaching a foreigner can be quite a daunting task.  She asked me my name and then I asked hers.  Then I asked her how old she was.  She responded she was 5 and immediately asked me my age.  During this brief conversation the older of the two made her way to me carrying the small rabbit.  I then had the name and age conversation with her as well as learned that their bunny is one years old and named Lucky.  I definitely laughed a little and told them how impressed I was that their rabbit has an english name.     After this brief little conversation, obviously entirely in my basic Japanese as they were too young to know much beyond hello and bye bye, I said sayonara and continued my walk home realizing that moments like the one I just experienced are the type of moments I will probably miss when I leave Japan.  When they are not staring or pointing at you, Japanese kids are definitely some of the cutest in the world.

      As you probably can imagine, the next few weeks are full of farewell parties.  Just to give you some idea of what to expect in the weeks to come, here is a bit of an overview.       Wednesday June 30th - Shiogama Boys English teacher enkai at Blair Marina in Shiogama       Saturday - Sunday July 3rd-4th - Oshima Island off the northern coast of Miyagi for the ALT leavers party.       Wednesday July 7th - Shiogama Boys full staff farewell party at the Kirin Beer Port.       Saturday July 10th - Teizan farewell party.       Sunday July 11th - going to Zao (famous mountain in Miyagi) with Yuko and Nitanai-Sensei as a last outing of sorts.  And of course there will be random dinners with friends and other things to fill all the days in between.  It is going to be a costly but fun last few weeks in Japan!

      Well, as you may or may not have already read, I decided to rent a car for 1/2 a day in order to ship stuff home.  Well, after realizing I had accomplished the days tasks and it was now pouring, I was left contemplating how to occupy my time and maximize the use of the car.  On Sunday I learned that unfortunately stephanie has been suffering from a pretty bad cough and cold that won't seem to go away.  She had said that she might skip school (I already had the day off due to a sports competition on sunday I attended)and go to the doctor.  I sent her a mail asking if she in fact stayed home to go to a doctor or if she unwisely went to school.  20 seconds later my phone was ringing.  Due to sleeping in and waking up to the pouring rain, steph had feared that she would have to pay for a cab to and from the doctors.  Lindsey to the rescue I suppose...    After taking Steph to the doctor she then asked what my plans were for the rest of the day.  I told her my only plans were to return the car by 8 and to have dinner with Jemma.  She thought that maybe I would want to go to Rifu-Cho (another city close to mine) to see Harry Potter.  I was interested but didn't want to cancel on Jemma and also had to return the car.  After sending messages to Jemma and driving to Rifu to find out the movie times and stuff, we decided a Harry Potter evening was in order.  Steph called the car place and asked them if we could keep the car until morning, we grabbed some lunch, picked Jemma up from school and then traveled back to Rifu for the movie.  It was quite good I have to admit!   After the movie we had a nice dinner, I drove everyone home, and eventually had the car parked ready to be returned today on my way to school.  It was quite a nice day for something so unplanned!

         This past weekend I consumed most of my time with packing...why? because soon enough I will be returning home and I would like my stuff to get there soon after if not before my own return.  It is ridiculously expensive to send things by air so everything will be going on an ocean voyage.  Optimistically things will arrive in about a month but if the winds are against me, it could take as long as 3 months.  Oh well...I won't be needing winter stuff for a while.   Anyway, Yuko has helped me with just about everything since my first day at the boys school and had offered to take me and my boxes to the post office several times over the last couple weeks.  The first date was kind of forgotten, the 2nd I had an injured shoulder and didn't want her to have to carry everything, and the third I decided to wait until I packed the final 2 boxes to be shipped.  While she offered yet a 4th time to take me yesterday, I assured her that it would not be necessary as I planned to rent a car for 1/2 the day and take care of everything myself.  She still thought she could at least help me carry stuff but I decided that the heaviest was only 12 kg so I could manage it all on my own.  I don't know what I am going to do when I don't have Yuko around offering solutions to just about everything I encounter.  But then again I guess when I leave Japan I won't exactly be needing the same assistance with things so I stand a chance of doing okay when I re-enter the western world.     I rented a car (the smallest one available) and was shocked when 4 of the 5 boxes (the biggest ones you can send) fit in the trunk.  After loading I drove to the post office and pretty much shocked all of the people there as I kept going back and forth carrying a seemingly endless number of boxes to be shipped.  Finally, all forms were filled out and hopefully my stuff is on its way just a few weeks ahead of my own travels home.  It feels quite good to have all of that taken care of though the daunting task of cleaning my apartment still lies ahead in the near future.

          I am sure by now some of you read about the adventures of my return trip from Nagano. Well, my return from Hiroshima ended up being quite an adventure as well. Having been warned of the approaching typhoon, we were concerned about the fate of our evening flight.  We therefore called ANA several times throughout the day and were eventually told we could call at 6:30 to learn more.  Having a 7:10 flight meant we could not wait until then to leave for the airport.  When we arrived at the airport we claimed some seats and read the notice that said they would be checking the weather at 6 O'clock.  At 6 they still didn't know and said that they would check the weather again at 7 and let us know.  Getting a little concerned, we started questioning the ANA ladies about our options.  All of us obviously wanted to know if we would be making it to work the next morning as nenkyu(paid leave) is running low and already in the negatives for some.      Apparently, the earlier flight from Hiroshima was routed through Nagoya and had been sitting there fore quite some time because of the typhoon.  Having had the typhoon completely skip us (don't know how it happened as it went right past us) we were pretty confident our flight would leave.  Unfortunately, the weather in Sendai was awful and although the plane might make it to Hiroshima, there is a law in Japan that says no flight can take off after 9 or 9:30 so there was no way we were going to make it home.  We wish they had just been honest from the start instead of giving us maybe over and over again.      Our options...they were dealing with us separately from everyone else I guess because we weren't just accepting what they said.  We weren't content to just change our ticket for the following morning and disappear for the night.  When they finally told us we could get on a flight to Tokyo, we had just missed the plane that would have gotten us there in time to catch the last shinkansen to Sendai.  We were then told we could still go on the last flight from Hiroshima to Tokyo but would only be able to take a night train or bus from there or stay in the city for the night.  All of those options would have been at our own expense. None of us were looking to spend much of anything.    They then told us we could stay at the airport hotel but that would have been 8,000 yen for each of us. About $80 US was more than we wanted to spend.  We told them we couldn't afford it and so they tried to find us somewhere less expensive.  They found us a place that would give us a discount rate of 3500 yen each but we would have to take the bus back into the city and round trip that would have added another 2000 yen each.  We still weren't happy. We asked to stay in the airport all night but they told us the airport closed so that wasn't possible.  We then tried our final option which was to have them call the airport hotel and ask if 4 of us could stay in a double which meant we would each be paying 4000 yen for the night.  We were quite lucky that the hotel agreed as breaking the rules is usually something not tolerated at all or even considered in Japan.  The room ended up being quite large and the nicest place we stayed in by far.  We all slept quite comfortably and were able to be on the 11:25 flight the next morning.  Another day of school missed but oh well...it happens.

         Several months ago I was occupying my time with the ANA website and happened to stumble upon the Chowari Web fare.  This meant that if you booked a flight during a specified week and traveled on another specified week you could travel from Sendai to Hiroshima for the low price of 24,000 yen.  Soon thereafter I mentioned it to Danola, we wrote the booking date in our JET diaries a couple months in advance, and were later rewarded with seats being available.  So this past weekend Danola, Kristel, Oliver and I boarded a flight and headed south.     My impressions of Hiroshima -- well, we spent a day in Peace Park viewing various memorials and spending a substantial amount of time learning about the first atomic bomb and the destruction it caused. Obviously, having learned about this catastrophic day in history from American text books, there was much to be learned and it was presented from quite a powerful and moving perspective.  I remember reading a quote that said "Noone should have to suffer the way that they suffered.  Even a scratch hurts!" and that really sums it up.  It made me reflect on the words I had seen scratched in the wall of the S-21 prison in Cambodia that said "the pain of mans inhumanity to man is unbearable."  In 3 seconds a city was totally destroyed and people were burned as a result of temperatures in the range of 3000-4000 degrees celsius. Everything I saw in Peace Park will not soon be forgotten.      As far as other adventures in Hiroshima, we spent a day out on Miyajima Island famous for its red Tori (gate) that you can walk to during low tide and can view from the shore at high tide.  We were there to see it at both times.  It was a nice relaxing day but definitely quite hot and we were warned of an approaching typhoon.  Aside from that, we sampled some of the local cuisine (famous for okonomiyaki which is a Japanese pancake thing I don't particularly like), wandered through a garden, and saw the remains of a castle that was obviously affected by the atomic bomb.  We also rode around a bit on their trams because we thought it would be a cool way to see the city.  All in all a great trip to Hiroshima.

      First, some names will remain anonymous to protect those involved.  Here it goes... In order to get to and from Nagano relatively inexpensively, we rented 2 10 passenger vans.  The trip to Nagano was accomplished without a problem.  The return is an entirely different story. My van was chosen to be the leader and so we set off on our journey with van 2 behind us.  Within 5 minutes we knew we were in for a rough ride.  Our driver (lets call him Joe) was all over the road and definitely not gentle on the breaks.  A few of us began sending messages to those in the vehicle behind us, they were sending mails telling us how dangerous our vehicle was being, and many in our vehicle were becoming quite sick. Dave finally came through for us and called Rob (our navigator) and told him that a girl in their van needs to go to the bathroom so could we stop at the next rest area.  All of us hopped out of ours but only guys got out of the vehicle behind us which didn't support their "claim".  Anyway, Toa went up to 'Joe' and told him he wanted to drive for a bit.  We were now in good hands. For all of the first years who are recontracting, there is currently a conference in Tokyo so we had to drop them off at a train station a bit outside of the city.  When we did, 'Joe' walked to the drivers side before Toa had even opened the door and asked for the keys.  I knew we were in trouble.  Jane quickly abandoned us and hopped in the other vehicle to make it 4 and 4 continuing on in each vehicle.  Jamie and I told the other female (we will call her Sara) to sit in the front because we weren't feeling great and wanted to lie down.  Mike, the driver of the other vehicle told us that maybe 'Joe' would be better because Mike would be in the lead.  That wasn't the case.  I then received a call from Rob who had gotten out with the Tokyo bound crew and he informed us that he had made a mistake in booking and the vehicles were supposed to have been returned at 11 AM (not PM) and we now needed to have them back by 9PM.  That would have been impossible so Rob had to figure out an alternative plan for us. Mike then realized that he was going to miss his Shinkansen and would be stranded in Sendai and 3 others of us were potentially going to miss our local trains.   Back to the driving...while 'Joe' was not the lead car, he was driving 1/2 in the shoulder, not using his signal or checking his blindspot, and was slamming on the breaks.  Jamie said something to him and he told her to lie down and close her eyes.  Within 20 minutes I realized something had to be done and I sent a message to Jane and asked her to have Mike pull over so we could get in their vehicle.  Both vehicles pulled over and Mike told 'Joe' that Jamie and I didn't feel safe riding with him and either he would be driving by himself (or with Sara if she didn't have the guts to move) or he should hand over the keys. That shouldn't have required much thought but he claimed he was fine and would continue driving.  Well, to get back on the road both vehicles needed to reverse.  Mike did so without a problem.  I had suggested that I get out to direct 'Joe' but the others said he should be fine.  Unfortunately he wasn't.  Mike watched him hit a concrete pole and quickly jumped out to look at the damage.  We saw Mike's reaction and knew we were in trouble.  Mike came back and told us we needed a new driver for the vehicle and Rebecca said she would since my ankle was quite sore.  We later learned that 'Joe' just handed the keys to Mike and said find another driver and those were the last words anyone heard from 'Joe' for the duration of our trip.   With Rebecca driving vehicle two and Mike the lead driver we set off again.  Mike was still trying to figure out how he could get home and we later figured out that if we dropped him off in Fukushima Prefecture he could catch the shinkansen there.  We somehow had lost the other vehicle when they had passed us to take the lead but we contacted them and told them our plan. It was then we realized all of the luggage was now in the wrong vehicles so they got off at the same exit so we could make the switch. We made it quickly, too quickly, and later received a call from Jane saying she left her bag with her house key and we needed to meet again.  We told them to follow the signs to the station but we never ran into each other and we eventually heard from them and they were having trouble getting back onto the expressway.  I was now driving vehicle 1 with only Jamie keeping me company and we were on our way.  Somehow we ended up in Sendai 1st but van number 2 ended up directly behind us.  We couldn't return the vehicles because the place was closed so we parked them in a 24hour lot so that Mary-Eve could meet Chris in the morning to return them by 11AM, the new due time.     Once the vehicles were parked, we were all relieved that we had made it back safely.  We were fortunate that the accident had happened in a parking area where 'Joe' was driving very slowly and not on the expressway when we were going around 120 km/hour.  'Joe' took off before Jamie and I even got out of our vehicle and we soon learned from 'Sara' that 'Joe' had hit a car before the pole. We were incredibly mad that both 'Joe' and 'Sara' did not say anything at the time (Joe never did) and we therefore didn't check the car for damage and were now obviously the culprits (well Joe was) of a hit and run.  The rest of us were shocked that 'Sara' had never said anything until we were back in Sendai.  She went on to say he only bumped it and so there was probably no damage.  A bump from a 10 passenger vehicle can cause damage even if it was only a bump and probably just isn't good enough.  The entire trip left many of us frustrated but we were thankful that noone was hurt.    I can't believe that someone can have the keys taken once, have two people say they aren't comfortable riding with him and still insist on driving.  I am glad that Jamie and I made the decision to switch when we did and find it kind of sad that 'Sara' is so concerned with people liking her that she didn't have the courage to switch cars. We were also incredibly fortunate that when the vehicles were returned no comments were made about the damage and thus far noone has called to say they witnessed the accident.  While I wish I had just taken the keys from him, we had all done everything humanly possible short of just grabbing the keys and we should all be old enough to recognize when your own actions are putting everyone in jeopardy and that safety of all those involved is more important than any individuals threatened or bruised ego.

      Once again I have posted these Nagano related posts in the wrong order...anyway...like I said in another post, I am not quite sure how I made the saves I did but I guess luck was on my side.  I could hear people on the sidelines commenting and people on the field were saying things as well.  One person shouted "don't shoot the powershots anymore because she can take them".  Another player told someone on my team that she thought I was awesome and then she walked up to me and said "you really suck" while shaking my hand.  The refs kept telling me nice saves and comments just kept coming from just about everyone all day long.   On Saturday night there was a party for all of those involved in the tournament.  One of the girls on my team came up to me and told me that another team had stopped her and made comments about me and that I was becoming a legend in Nagano.  As I walked from 1 side of the room to the other I was stopped by 3 different groups of girls who wanted to tell me how well I played, to ask me if I had really never played goalie before, and to see if my injuries were healing.  It actually got quite tiresome.  The keeper from Nagano talked to Jamie (our captain) and told her that she could watch me reading the other players and I knew exactly where they were heading and that is how I could stop all of their shots.  I honestly am not quite sure how it all happened but having all these different people talking about you and asking other people questions about me was kind of strange but in a good way I suppose.  I don't think I have ever been the center of so much positive attention.  Unfortunately, as I sit here typing (on Tuesday I will add) I am still feeling the pain of all of the dives and saves.  My ankle is a bit sore and I can't quite lift my right arm and rotate that shoulder.  Oh well, I guess a little pain now was worth the effort in goal because my team was able to depend on me and aside from the 2nd half of day 2, I don't feel like I let them down at all.  In fact I think they were a bit shocked by my play as well.

      This past weekend I traveled to Nagano with 23 other Miyagi JETS.  Unfortunately, neither team did particularly well but it was a fun trip nonetheless.  On Saturday, the girls team was scheduled to play 2 games, the first against Gunma and the second against Nagano Prefecture.  For the entire tournament I was the goalie and was the only team member to play every minute of every game.  I don't know how it happened, but somehow I managed to actually play really well on day 1.      The first game against Gunman ended with a 0-0 tie and we therefore went into penalty kicks.  Because we were playing 6 a side soccer, three shooters were chosen.  Our shooter made the 1st and unfortunately so did theirs.  Then our 2nd missed and theirs made it.   Now the pressure was really on.  Our 3rd fortunately made it but if I didn't save the next shot we would have lost.  Well, I blocked it.  We then went into sudden death.  Our 1st and 2nd shooters both missed but I saved both shots from the other team.  Then our 3rd shooter came through for me again and as luck would have it, the last shot from the other team didn't get passed me and we had 1 our first game!!!   Prior to the start of the second game, we heard that Nagano beat Gunma 7-1 so we knew it would be a tough game.  I was diving all over the place and reaching shots that I didn't think was possible.  Those watching were making comments and the Nagano girls were getting frustrated because I was able to read where they were heading and block some pretty good shots.  Although we lost, I was quite pleased with my play that game.     On day 3 we drew Chiba and again the first half I was diving all over the place and saved every shot they had.  We also got a lucky goal and were up 1-0.  Unfortunately, we switched sides in the 2nd half and I ended up slipping and sliding in mud for the duration of the half.  The combination of lots of mud and a horrible ref resulted in us losing the game.  I was quite disappointed with my play in the 2nd half but I guess you can't save them all and the conditions were working against me.  While we didn't make it very far, it was good fun and the teams we played were very nice for the most part.

      Okay, so many of you have asked the extent to which I am able to understand and speak Japanese.  Honestly, that is pretty difficult to say.    READING -->  First, reading hiragana and katakana is no longer a difficult task and I often find myself watching the Japanese subtitles on my TV to see how much I understand.  Unfortunately, that only gets me so far as having to skip all of the kanji doesn't really make for a very promising translating attempt.  Being able to read the phonetic systems is especially useful in restaurants and reading signs.   LISTENING -->   As far as listening goes, I am able to understand very basic Japanese.  Basically, you know that anything that ends in ka is a question and so if you hear a ka you know the person is probably seeking some type of response.  Also, after being asked the same questions over and over again, you are able to identify the key words and go from there.  I no longer stress when I am going to be with people who speak very little English because if all else fails, I can understand enough to get by and not feel really frustrated.     SPEAKING -->  Knowing the basic sentence structure is just as helpful in speaking as it is in listening.  If I am trying to ask a question I pretty much just stick a ka on the end of what I am trying to say.  Also, when it comes to asking if you have something or if someone is there, arimasu and imasu are pretty much gonna go the distance for you.  You use arimasu for inanimate objects and imasu for living things.  Pretty basic! My vocabulary has been increasing gradually and I am able to speak about what I did or am going to do, ask people about what they've done, order food and now even ask for things to be modified to my liking, call for cabs, accomplish everything at the bank, discuss the weather, discuss how I am feeling, obviously all greetings, get and give directions, ask the costs of things and ask to see things, and even some of the not so nice japanese words...the list goes on and on.    Basically, listening and speaking go hand in hand.  Listening to people speak Japanese all around me I am continually engaged in a listening exercise like I used to have in Spanish and Hebrew classes.  If someone is speaking to me, I am able to use my ability to speak Japanese to ask them to speak more slowly, to repeat something, or to question a specific word they used.  In terms of the whole Japanese spectrum I know very, very little, but I am happy with the amount I know considering when I arrived last July the only words I knew were Konnichiwa and Sayonara!

      In Wisconsin people used to say there are four seasons:fall, winter, spring and construction.  Well, I will take construction and blue skies over this rainy stuff any day.  I have 15 minutes left until I leave school and the sky is not looking very promising.  The RAINY SEASON has begun and although we were very lucky over the weekend, I think when the rain comes down tonight it will be coming down for at least the next month!  And it isn't the cool refreshing rain...it is the warm constant drizzle with the oh so pleasant effects of humidity so a) you are never dry b) you are always sticky and c)upon your arrival at school and your departure at the end of the day, everyone says take care and wave from their windows as they drive past you, standing there in your rainsuit, holding an umbrella, and entirely drenched because the rain is unavoidable and it is so hot and sticky that even if it wasn't raining you would still be wet.  Sometimes I wonder why I even bother with a complete rain suit...But I am not complaining...in less than 2 months I will be escaping what is supposed to be the worst summer in 5 years here in Japan. And I am up north...all of the people down south are currently complaining because they believe hell is located in southern japan.

      Well everybody...it is official.  My ticket to return to the U.S. is booked and paid for.  I will be flying into Chicago and I plan to stay for a few days and will then continue on my journey home.  I can't believe I will be returning to the U.S. after about 353 days in Asia.  I have heard a lot of talk about reverse culture shock recently but right now I am just excited to be heading home!

      Wow....a year ago I landed in this airport and it is hard to believe that in a few hours I will be boarding a plane and heading home.&nbsp; In many ways, Japan has become my home and last night I definitely realized that.&nbsp; A few weeks ago I decided to take the night bus and so last night at 11:10 I left Miyagi.&nbsp;&nbsp; My closest friends in Japan...Jemma, Steph, Yuko, and Nitanai Sensei (Tomoko) were there to see me off (along with like 15 other jets because 4 of us were on this bus).&nbsp; I was doing okay with the goodbyes until I went to give Yuko a hug and she was crying.&nbsp; She has definitely been my family here in Japan and to see her so upset crushed me.&nbsp; I never like to see my friends cry and it is even harder when you know you are the one causing it.&nbsp; Everyone's eyes appeared as though they would soon be releasing tears and as I took my seat on the bus and looked out to wave goodbye, the floodgates in my eyes had definitely been opened as well.&nbsp; My time in Japan was filled with tons of ups and downs, but as I am sitting here in Narita (I have already been here for 5 1/2 hours and still have another 6 til take off) I realize that this experience has definitely changed me in ways I probably won't realize or comprehend for quite some time.&nbsp; I know without a doubt that I am incredibly fortunate to have had this experience and&nbsp;have the amazing friends and people in my life&nbsp; that make saying goodbye so hard.&nbsp; As I said to Yuko, no matter when or where I am, I will always know I have family in Japan!  To those of you in the U.S....or anywhere else in the world...while I am incredibly sad to be leaving the friends I have made here in Japan, it is quite comforting to know that I have family and close friends anxiously awaiting my return to the U.S. or visits to various parts of the world.&nbsp; It seems as though I have been saying many goodbyes over the past 5 years of my life, none of which get&nbsp;any easier, but I guess that is the price you pay for being able to have so many amazing people in your life as well as once in a lifetime opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;  As the song from&nbsp;Rent goes,   525,600 minutes, how do you measure, measure a year?!?!?!?!  &nbsp;

      Before coming to Japan I used to be a person who hated speaking in front of large groups.&nbsp; I inevitably would get nervous and&nbsp;my hands and voice would shake.&nbsp; Since coming to Japan, in many ways I have gotten used to public speaking.&nbsp; I will admit however that giving a speech in front of over 700 boys in japanese is slightly daunting.&nbsp; Surprisingly, I made it through even this without nerves getting the best of me.&nbsp; Anyway, the following is pretty long but if you would like to see exactly what my speech is in Japanese, continue reading...(note: it is in Romaji (english letters) and not in katakana or hirigana because this is a lot less stressful). &nbsp;   Ohayo gozaimasu, watashi wa ichi nenkan Shiogama de hataraite kimashita.&nbsp; Sono aida, watashi to isshoni benkyou shita koto wo enjoy shite ita to nozonde imasu.&nbsp; Watashi wa hontouni enjoy shimashita.&nbsp; Minasan wa yoku dekimashita.&nbsp; Korekaramo gambattara&nbsp; eigo ga kekkou umaku naru to omoimase.&nbsp; Watashi wa ichi nen no aida, mina kara iroiro manabimashita.&nbsp; Sorede, minasan no eigo no sensei de wa nakunarushi, seito de mo naunarimasu.       &nbsp;   Soshite, iroirona omoshiroi taiken wo minasan no okage de shimashita.&nbsp; Seito no minasan wa totemo genki de watashi ga kurasu ni iku to itsumo ooki na koe de aisatsu o shite kuremashita.&nbsp; Takusan no evento ni sanka shimashita dono evento mo totemo subarashi to omoimashita.&nbsp; Minasan no eigo no katsudo wa totemo subarashikute bikuri shimashita.&nbsp; Minasan no shitsumon mo neshin de odorokimashita.&nbsp; Sono yo na wakede watashi wa totemo tanoshi ii tokii o sugosemashita.&nbsp; Minasan ga eigo o moto tanoshiin de kureru koto o negaimasu.&nbsp; Nihon de ichiban no omoide to ieru no wa undobu no minasan ga totemo reigi tadashi toyu koto desu.&nbsp; Watashi ga kaeru toki yakyubuin wa boshi o oroshite aisatsu o shite kuremashita.&nbsp; Sakabu to handbarubu nado no seito wa genki yoku watashi ni teohute kuremashita.&nbsp; Totemo ureshikatta desu.       &nbsp;   Watashi wa korekara ichido furusato ni kaete ikka getsu kazoku to sugoshimasu.&nbsp; Sono ato ni watashi wa shigoto de Spain ni ikimasu.&nbsp; Watashi wa Spain kara kaetta ato ni America ni kittara, watashi wo houmon shite kudasai.       &nbsp;   Kouchou sensei to kyoutou sensei hajime ichi nenkan no enjo wo doumo arigatou gozaimashita.&nbsp; Sensei no minasan, tokuni Tadano sensei, minasan mo hontouni osewa ni narimashita.&nbsp; Saigo ni Shiogama Koko no seito: doumo arigatou gozaimashita.&nbsp; Minasan no okage de konnani sutekina Shiogama no seikatsu wo taiken dekimashita.&nbsp; Watashi no Nihon de no keiken wa keshite wasurerarenai mono desu koremo yahari&nbsp; minasan no okage desue.&nbsp; Doumo arigatou gozaimashita.   &nbsp;

      Sunday morning bright and early Yuko and Nitanai-Sensei picked me up outside of my apartment and we were off on a days adventure.  I had really been looking forward to this outing because Zao is one of the famous spots in Miyagi and I love spending time with Yuko and Nitanai-Sensei.  2 and half hours later we had arrived at the top of the mountain and it was pouring rain to say the least.  It is the rainy season we were all forced to admit.  We dashed toward the tourist center and now a bit wet we were contemplating our plan of action.  Yuko ran out the back to see if we could see the lake/crater type thing and unfortunately the rain and the fog made it virtually impossible.  Nonetheless, the 3 of us ran back to the lookout spot in the pouring rain, took a couple pictures, and were drenched.  Umbrellas don't help when the rain is coming in sideways.  Just as we were about to dash back, the fog cleared a bit and I could just make out the lake for about a minute.  While it wasn't sparkling blue waters like in the pictures, I was given a slight glimpse of what we had driven quite a ways to see.      We then wandered around the tourist center a bit checking out the omiyage (souvenirs) for sale and attempting to dry off a bit.  We then ran back to the car and began our descent.  It was quite funny because as we set off on the trip back down we all made guesses about what the weather would be like at the bottom.  I said light rain, Yuko said it would be cloudy, and Nitanai sensei said it would be sunny.  As we made our way down, the weather was clearing a bit but we still weren't sure which of us was going to win the guessing game.  When we reached the bottom there was still a slight drizzle but Yuko immediately claimed that we weren't all the way at the bottom.  I just laughed and within ten minutes in one part of the sky the sun was shining through a bit, another part was completely gray and cloudy, and there was still a light rain falling.  So in some ways we were all a bit right!    We then made our way to this pizza shop that is apparently quite famous in the area.  Before we sat down I told Yuko that we had to make a deal and that lunch was going to be my treat.  After a couple minutes of her giving all of these reasons why I shouldn't, I eventually convinced her that I really wanted to pay and she was just going to have to let me.  I knew it was going to be a battle but they have done so much for me that I really wanted to do something and buying lunch was a perfect opportunity.  It was really good and the pizza chef/guy who owns the place gave me a little elephant he had made himself.  They also had me write a message in this little book that all of the foreigners write in.  It was quite neat because as I flipped the pages I saw messages from ALT's all over Miyagi and Northern Japan.  As we were finishing I looked up and in walked Katy with some of her teachers I believe.  I then learned that Yuko had seen her at the top of the mountain but neither she nor I saw each other.  After a brief chat we set off on our return trip.  Another great day made possible by Shiogama boys teachers.

      Well, on Saturday night I had my Teizan farewell enkai in Sendai.  I wasn't all that thrilled about having to attend but in many ways it was a good night. It provided me with a sense of closure about my year at Teizan and also enabled me to realize that in one week, my experience at this school will be over.  My supervisor didn't come, the only english teacher sitting at my table was the night school one who works with Dave (the two others I teach with said they can't speak English), and both the principal and vice principal made speeches saying that I also enjoyed working at Shiogama Girls School.  Yes, you read that correctly.  They both made speeches saying my visit school was the girls school when in fact I have always worked at Shiogama Boys. I am sure you now get a sense of how well they know me.  Anyway, after delivering a speech in Japanese and 2 hours of being genki (cheerful), the enkai ended and I had survived my final Teizan enkai.  That was the last of my school enkais hosted by both schools and now my nights will be occupied by the closer friends I have made during my year in Japan.

      I don't know if anyone reads my blog on a regular basis, but if you do, you should know that my lycos account is now blocked at school.  After hours of trying to get around the net filter, it was determined that it could not be done without downloading a special program.  Downloading a program to get around a block on a schools computer is probably not in my best interest.  So, I have another account if you want to definitely get in touch with me.  It is friedmanlindsey@fastmail.fm.  I will still check lycos as often as possible but this block is creating a bit of a problem.  Gomen (sorry!

         Last night I had my farewell enkai with the teachers of Shiogama Boys School.  They are absolutely fabulous and it was so much fun.  A bus came and picked us up from school and took us to the Kirin Beer Port.  The first Kanpai (toast) was made and the drinking and eating began.  I was chatting half in english and half in Japanese with the various people sitting around me and Yuko and I were definitely having fun.  Then it became time for my speech.  I stood up and said good evening in the Tohoku dialect and then continued giving my speech in Japanese.  I got a couple cheers and applauses along the way and eventually completed it.  I had a card with the japanese written on it which turned out to be a wise move as I had to give this speech after already a few rounds of drinks.      The night continued with various teachers making speeches and telling me how much they loved having me at their school, how I have really impressed them with the way I learned Japanese and about Japanese culture, and just how they are going to miss me a ton.  The vice principal who is a great guy and teaches me various Japanese phrases used a special Japanese phrase that basically meant that while he is very sad that I am leaving, he will never forget me because the memories we shared will last forever.  They really are an incredible group of people and I am going to try and make the most of my last 2 weeks with them and hopefully Yuko at least will come and visit me whereever I am in the world.  She has helped me more than anyone in Japan and I never expected to become such great friends with a teacher I initially only saw 2 days a week.  It is strange because we have a very similar sense of humor and are continually joking around but whenever I was having problems with my other school, trying to figure out how to do things in Japanese, or just needing a little guidance she was always offering to help.          Here is just another little story from last nights enkai...one of the Japanese history teachers got up to make a speech and he is one who always has conversations with me entirely in Japanese.  He even told Yuko a couple months after I arrived how great my Japanese is and that I understood everything.  Little did he know I was just saying hai to everything and nodding in agreement.  Well, last night he stood up and went into this speech about how America dropped the atomic bomb on Japan and how much he hates America.  Immediately all of the other teachers told him to sit down, his time was up, and they even did a countdown to get him to stop talking.  Yuko fell over in the chair next to me she was laughing and I guess a bit embarrassed.  He wouldn't stop so I whispered to Yuko that she should remind him of Pearl Harbor.  She did and his response to that was that they are really sorry about Pearl Harbor.  He then went on to say how much Japan has helped America so Yuko and I (a little tag team) chimed in with the fact that America has also helped Japan a lot.  Anyway, he finally stopped after saying that he likes me a lot but not America.  Yuko and I then had a conversation about how all of the students THINK he is weird but the teachers KNOW he is.  Yuko and I, still laughing and trying to recover, then joked about how he likes me but not America, and now I love Japan but could do without him.  It was definitely one of those nights I will remember for years to come!

      I thought I knew hot but this is ridiculous!!!  So I grew up in heat and humidity but this stuff is just gross.  By the time I get to school I am hot and sticky and no relief kicks in when you enter the building.  All day long I seem to work in a sweat box with occasional relief when I catch a breeze coming in through an open window.  I just don't get it!  While we have been spared the torrential downpours of the rainy season to some extent, Japan should be well aware of what is necessary to fight this stuff. I can't even begin to imagine what those down south are experiencing.  Basically, in the summer we sweat all day long and in the winter we freeze.  I just learned the other day that Miyagi Prefecture is the coldest place in Japan indoors. Perhaps because north of us people were smart enough to install central heating.  I still most definitely preferred winter.  Oh well...in a couple of weeks I will be on a plane and my friends here in Japan can only hope that my plane flying overhead will generate a nice little breeze!!!

      I will be moving out of my apartment in a little over two weeks and less than a full week later my successor will be moving in.  I must say that one of the things that made moving in so easy was moving into an already furnished apartment.  While I spent a decent some of money buying everything from my predecessor, I quickly realized that it was money well spent.  My successor might in fact have a pretty rough start.  While I offered to sell him everything for a very reasonable price, he wanted to do things on his terms.  Unfortunately, he isn't exactly in a position to make demands and while I was willing to negotiate prices and payment options, I was not willing to give most of my things away for nothing.  So what does that mean?!?!?  I have now advertised everything to current jets who are staying another year.  Over the next two weeks I will be having an everything must go sale and when my successor arrives in 3 weeks, it appears he will be arriving to an empty apartment.  In less than 24 hours requests for information and availability for all major furniture and appliances have been made.  While I was really trying to help the new guy out and make things easy for both of us, I am now just trying to clear everything out.  I really wonder what it will be like to arrive in a foreign country and finally make it to your apartment only to realize that there is no fridge, no washing machine, no microwave, no furniture...I can't imagine it would make for a very warm welcoming.

      On Saturday morning my alarm went off at 6:55 and I was not too excited to be waking up so early.  Anyway, at 8:30 I met Steph, Katy, Rich T. and Matt in Sendai and we boarded a train to Kesennuma in the far north of Miyagi.  On the train we met Kirin and Natalie, two sendai-city jets who wish they were miyagi jets because we are so much cooler than the jets placed under the sendai board of education.  Anyway, after getting glimpses of the coastline while on the train, at 10:50 we arrived in Kesennuma and began the trek to the ferry port.  Just before 12 noon we were finally on the island and our belongings were stashed in various tents before heading to the beach.   The beach...lets just say that it would not have been a beach in Japan if there wasn't concrete.  So of course, we had to climb over a concrete wall and all of these concrete slabs before putting our feet in the sand.  We were the first of 100+ jets to arrive on the island and therefore the 9 of us to arrive on the first train were alone on the beach for about 3 hours.  It was seriously one of the prettiest days I have seen in Japan and waking up so early was immediately worth it.   Dinner time...well dinner was quite a funny experience.  With some jets working the grill, we eventually had an assortment of food including yakisoba (frilled noodles), grilled corn, pasta salad, grilled chicken sandwiches, and yakitori (really tasty chicken on a stick).  And of course there was lots of alcohol.  I think there were over 700 cans of beer and chuhi (Japanese fruity alcohol drink) in addition to the alcohol that various people brought for their own private consumption.  By 8 PM the party was definitely well underway.  There was lots of laughter, sports being played, photos being taken, fireworks being set off, and the night was completed as we gathered around a bonfire and talked, sang songs, listened to music...And of course the Americans were standing by to celebrate the 4th of July at midnight.    Eventually, Katy, Rich T., Kirin and I made our way to a tent and talked for awhile about ghost stories and urban legends and then fell asleep.  I woke up and made my way back to my own tent where I had my sleeping bag and blanket figuring that the actual occupants of the tent I was in might come back and create a problem.  I found Jamie asleep in my tent.  Stephanie was sitting on a table outside of my tent with Austin and Phillip and had the best seat in the house for what was about to take place.  Rich T. poked his head in my tent and asked if he could join me because he had been stung by a bee in his tent.  I told him no problem but when he returned to his tent he found Rich Shelley in his tent and had to wake everyone up to get his blankets.  As soon as Katy heard there were bees, she grabbed her blankets and headed to my tent as well.  Matt then followed Katy because she had the pillow.  Before I knew it Matt, Rich T, Katy, Jamie and I were all in 1 tent.  Rich S. was now the only one sleeping in the bee tent and that wasn't even where he was supposed to be.  Steph didn't want to sleep in the bee tent and there was no room in mine so she slept in Austin and Phillips tent.  Jamie realized that there was no room for her visiting friend in our tent so she ended up sleeping elsewhere.  So in the end it all worked out but it took quite a while for everyone to settle down and get some sleep.      When we awoke quite early we all kind of laughed about the night before, ate a little breakfast, and began trying to figure out train times to head home in the early afternoon.  All in all it was a great leavers party and I an excellent opportunity to see and speak to a lot of people for the last time.  Living in Japan for the past year would have been virtually impossible without all of the other Jets in Miyagi.

      Last Wednesday I had the first of the enkais and it was quite a lovely evening.  We had dinner at Blair Marina in Shiogama. It is a nice restaurant with a great view of Shiogama Port and the teachers I was with are all great. While there are positive and negative aspects of my year in Japan, I am definitely lucky to have experienced this year with the teachers at Shiogama Boys because they are a huge part of what will make saying goodbye a bit difficult.  I was really surpised when they gave me a really pretty Japanese fan and a traditional red scarf as a going away present.  Now I must think of something adequate to give all of them as a way of saying thanks, but it is hard to think of something that can express just how much thanks I owe them. I am really looking forward to this Wednesday when I have my enkai with all of the teachers from Shiogama Boys.  It should be another great night!

      While I have tried to limit my blog to all of the fun and exciting things, I guess I would be doing you all a bit of injustice if I didn't shed some light on the more difficult aspects of teaching in Japan.  So here it goes...   For some odd reason, my base school defied normal scheduling guidelines and scheduled me for 6 out of 6 classes on Thursdays.  A teacher having 5 classes in a day is something avoided as often as possible and 6 is nearly unheard of.  I guess I just lucked out!?!?!   So please bear in mind that this is at my base school, not Shiogama Boys School where classes are fun, the boys are high energy and the teachers are great.  So this is what happened yesterday...   1st and 2nd period --> this is a double-period english communication class.  There are supposed to be 8 students but that has never happened.  I arrive at class and there are no students.  1 shows up 5 minutes later followed by 2 more students a couple minutes later.  The Japanese teacher I am working with begins the class and the students tune out everything instantly.  The two boys in the back are deeply engaged in conversation and the girl is rotating between playing with her keitai (cell phone) and applying make-up.  The JTE says nothing.  He continues speaking and asks me to be the human tape recorder reading certain passages. Not a single student is listening or attempting to pay attention at all.  A bit of frustration sets in.  The teacher has me do mundane tasks with absolutely no audience and then tries to discuss how my classes at the boys school are different.  The final straw...a keitai rings, the boy answers it, has a conversation for a few minutes in the classroom during the lesson, and the JTE waits for him to finish his conversation and then continues talking without any type of reprimand.  I was not a happy person and felt that my time was being completely wasted which for an hour and 1/2 it undoubtedly was.    3rd period.  The bell rings and I find the JTE, the second of the day.  This is an English One (I) class. He asks me what we should do, yes the bell for the start of class just rang and we are still in the teachers room, and I asked him what they were learning.  He said he didn't know but would go get the book.  He can't find the teachers manual but off we go to class anyway.  The first 10 minutes are spent listing everything we can't do because of the lack of the teachers manual and the entire class is a bit of a joke.  He keeps asking me what I do in my other English I classes with the two other JTE's and I repeatedly tell him that all 3 classes are learning different things in different ways even though they are all supposedly taking the same course.  Again, I wasn't exactly the happiest of people as if he only would talk to me before class we might actually be able to do something meaningful and productive with the students.       4th period I had a class with the most decent of the three teachers I work with.  We had discussed it that morning and all went as planned.  Definitely a relief as English I classes can be quite boring but this one went smoothly.     5th and 6th is another double period communication class with the same JTE from 3rd period.  Again another two lessons without a discussion or any planning prior to the ringing of the bell.  It is a tedious and boring lesson and by halfway through the second period, the teacher said he was tired and that he doesn't know what else we can do so we ended early.  Yay for small little miracles!!!   Prior to arriving I expected Japanese students to be hardworkers and definitely disciplined, that is definitely not the case at Teizan and being someone who according to contract cannot administer any discipline, having a JTE that also refuses to discipline or maintain any control makes most of my classes, week after week, nothing more than a waste of time for all of those involved.  At least I have 6 classes a week at the Boys School which make me feel that I am actually making a difference in the classroom and that classes here in Japan can be rewarding!
