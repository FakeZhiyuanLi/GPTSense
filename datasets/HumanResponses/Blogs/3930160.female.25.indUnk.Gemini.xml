      Damn! I just spent over an hour describing in (hilarious if I do say so myself) detail my adventures from my first night on in-house call last night, and then lost it to the blogging world. Sometimes technology frustrates me to no end.  Point being: I'm in love with Pediatrics. In 72 hours, my entire perspective has changed:  1) I love the Davids. They are smart, handsome, sassy, and hilarious. Married though, which is a "big suck" (David R's term) in my opinion.  2) I love my intern, senior, attending - the whole team is fabulous. I love Peds cardiology - and for whatever reason, every single patient I have picked up has been some very involved Pediatric infectious disease case, so who knows, therein lies a potential future! The pediatric ID doctor is the cutest man ever - he has bushy eyebrows that rival Beau Bridges', wears bowties and tweed suits with the elbow patches that I love, and has this charming soft manner about him. He loves to teach and I love learning from him (he cleared up antibiotics for me in 8 minutes) so we make a wonderful team. We make cute notes to each other in the chart like:   "Assessment/Plan: 1) Infectious Disease consult in the AM (Dr. Keim aware)"  to which he responds:  1) Thanks to MS-3 (that's me!) for my involvement on the case - a fascinating one at that!  to which (of course) I take it one step beyond and write:  "3) As per Dr. Keim's intriguing thoughts on PFAPA, suggest tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy if fever continues in its cyclic nature."   3) THE PATIENTS! Are the "bomb-dig" (quoting Naomi's colourful description of McDonald's hash-browns). Kids are amazingly resilient. They are sick not because they have smoked for 55 years and ate their way into oblivion (not to mention Type II DM) but rather for reasons that we can do our best to help them with, and they recover! So quickly! And those that don't are nevertheless totally refreshing, positive and honest.  Needless to say, one week in and I'm as happy as can be. 3rd year, despite rough hours (and I haven't even hit surgery) is so COMPLETELY superior to 1st and 2nd year, I can't even begin to express how happy I am to be out of the woods so to speak. I hope that I'm not losing credibility in the eyes of my faithful readers (Family! Peds! Psychiatry!) - and there's no doubt that I won't be this pumped about  everything   (Ophthalmology! Physical & Rehabilitation Medicine!) but it should prove to be, at the very least, an interesting survey of medicine this year. It's a trip, really, that I get to be on this end of things.

      After a leisurely weekend of "catching up" with friends, a social life, sleep and personal maintenance (like getting my toes done with Lauren - tame those snarls with a square-cut and Big Apple Red polish), today put all of that laid-back-goodness to an end as we were baptized with fire during our "intro to Peds Wards." While Luray was lazy, Fairfax has frenzy-potential. The call schedule in Luray was harmless, what with every 6 nights and sleeping at home next to my pager, which went off all of twice in a month; enter Fairfax, call q4, in-house, with a reputation of no sleep. "But here are some $5 meal coupons! We've got Blimpie's!" To which I turned to Pete Williams with an expression that read "Blimpie's? What's Blimpie's?" Ahh, the sheltered Canadian rears her ugly head again...  Heck, yes - Fairfax is stepping it up a notch in intensity, and damned if I'm not ready.  The day began innocently enough; we had a brief orientation at UVA - with Dr.Wilson, whom I absolutely adore, and then we were forced to suffer through some painful video on "The Pediatric Interview." It was a horrendously low-budget production with testimonials from Pediatricians about their hopes, fears and dreams when they began Peds as a medical student. I can just see the script:   Cut to: Small,cute Asian resident making 'scared-face' talking about her first admission...                                   Resident              All I could think was - 'this kid needs a doctor!              Oh, right!  I'm  the doctor!' I'm not sure who was              more terrified - me or the septic-2 year-old!!!   These films generally as a rule give me the willies; the goose-bump factor increases exponentially when they are adorned with lame graphics and horrible background muzak on the synthesizer.  After making it through the video, we were unleashed to our respective destinations and I made my way up 29 to Fairfax, excited as ever to see my bro and of course, adorable and ever-faithful Geordie. I got home with plenty of time to spare, unloaded my stuff and Matty and I decided we'd hit up The Sunflower quick-snap for lunch before I had to meet up with Sara, Pete and Scott for orientation-part-deux-chez-Fairfax. So Matty and I drove over in two separate cars, all the while I'm running my order over in my head: Edamame and Lam Curry Tofu...no, maybe General Tso's Surprise...yes, definitely General Tso's...only to arrive at the restaurant and realise I had forgotten my bag (filled with absolutely everything I needed) at home. Heck, YES. So lunch instead was tuna-fish on the go but I made it to the hospital in plenty of time to meet my equally-as-compulsive fellow med students at the shuttle we were to ride over to the hospital, all of us almost 40 minutes early. So far, so good, save for a small slip-up.   The last part of sanity that I remember was right around the time we were getting our ID badges and photos taken around 2:00 - there were still jokes flying, nervous laughter, a confident smile here and there - and then, WHAM!  "Boys and girls, welcome to world's most confusing hospital. Let's take you on a tour - my name's David, and I'm the Chief Resident...but don't worry, the other Chief is named David too. And then there's a gazillion other people who are  likewise  far more senior and important than you - and a good number of them are named David as well - shouldn't  that  make life easy! Not to mention the women residents - who by definition don't like you if you are: a) Cute b) Little c) Wearing anything Cute or Little (like my fitted-pink BR blouse, awesome)  Here are your teams: Team I is Heme/Onc and GI...and nope, sorry Allie, not you this time even though those are two of your top five in terms of things you could picture yourself doing in life. We are going to give those spots to Sara and Scott. Instead, you are Team II - with Pete, two intense interns, and the non-intimidating fields of Cardiology and Pulmonology. Remember all 26 of those congenital heart defects you got to learn in that mammoth hand-out last fall? Time to brush up your repertoire. What's more, we're going to assign you 3 patients to round on and present tomorrow morning at 7. How long do you think it'll take you to do a physical exam? 1 hour? Let's make it two patients then. What do you know about CF? You said you were from Toronto - let's hear about that gene sequencing then, I believe it took place in Toronto..."  I don't even remember how the rest of the day went...somewhere in the midst of it all, however, I popped my Blimpie's-cherry.  As the day drew to a close, I managed to stop on my way home to get my eyebrows waxed, if only to feel remotely human again. And I arrived home to my little bro who had won the doubles of the Montclair Open, was runner-up in singles, and wanted to celebrate and order some wings. Now my belly is full - my brain and anxiety are appeased as I've researched  the   CF paper from The Hospital of Sick Children in Toronto, brushed up on Cyanotic and Acyanotic heart defects, and I'm feeling quite ready to take on the world. As overwhelming as it all was, I am somehow left feeling totally excited.  Bring it on, Davids.

      Quick update about yet another Luraytian expression that I'm obsessed with - SHOOOO! Not "shoo" as in, "get outta here, you filthy malnourished JYD" but rather "SHOOOOOOOOOO! Here lately I've been hurtin' BAD!" Or, "Shooo! I'm right ready to stick it to her, she was fired up somethin' HATEFUL." Give it a go yourself - with a bit of wind in your breath - like you are whispering...'Shooooo...' Or you can say it as you suck in air across pursed lips....'Shoooo!'  Fun, isn't it? But honestly, EVERYONE said it. Even the doctors - it was totally bizarre. The best part is that today, it was confirmed by Paul that the lovely people of Middlebrook, Virginia also pepper their vocabulary with "Shoo" here and there...he's experienced it in the context of: "SHOOO! I've been canning beans every night for a month..." and other such variations on the theme. The possibilities, really, are endless.  Also, of note: Sylvie Moore is Marianna Law's doppleganger circa 2030. Except curly. And again, credit goes to Paul for helping me out when I was desperately trying to place "Now,  why  does she look  so  familiar..."  I would elaborate on their similarities but I imagine that would be more fun for you to do when you have to sit through the exit interview come  your  family med rotation - the distraction and entertainment is extremely necessary, rest assured.  But shooooo - we are officially finished with family medicine! We had a day of workshops, an afternoon of the most random 100 multiple choice questions, and the thrilling "Exit Interview" with mild-mannered Sylvie. Ahh. Sylvie - I wonder if she's a real bobcat in the bedroom - god, that would be a hilarious study in contrast...those droopy eyes and wild curls give the impression she is  all  woman. I digress. This weekend promises to be fun as it is a free weekend and then it's onto Pediatrics in Fairfax! I can't wait to do Peds wards, be at home for a month, and hopefully reenact the wonderful days of summer when my family first moved to Virginia and my brother and I didn't know anyone. Our evenings consisted of a trip to Blockbuster, take-out from Sushi-Yama, and cruising around Oaktowwwwwwwn with 95.5 WPGC-FM blaring from our (parents') car. Sadly, life in Oakton hasn't really gotten that much more exciting for the two of us - we still know all of 3 people our age in the area, and spend countless nights eating sushi and watching movies, the only differences possibly being that we rent from NetFlicks now and that I have grown out of my liking for Saba (mackerel) and updated rather to cuttlefish. My, how we've matured.  Finally, I would like to plug some albums that are my main sources of joy lately (I'm jumping on Scott's bandwagon)...specifically, The College Dropout by Kanye West (Vickie, it really is good, please give it some ear-time) and of course Beastie Boys' To The 5 Boroughs is absolutely fantastic. Not to mention The Streets, both A Grand Don't Come for Free and his first album Original Pirate Material that I'm getting  really  into (thanks to Gord for that exposure). Living in Luray has afforded me ample time to rock-out in my car and advance my hearing loss to the best of my ability - and I am succeeding with every road trip that approaches me. The Kanye West album is musically interesting, varied and of course, at times incredibly catchy, complete with hilarious lyrics like when Kanye is trying to pick up this girl and she's all: "You mean Talib, lyrics stick to your rib I mean that's my favorite CD that I play in my crib I mean you don't really know him so why is you lying?" Yo Kwe she don't believe me please pick up the line She gonna think that I'm lying just spit a couple of lines Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time.  Brilliant!  Also, I had a Kanya West lyric hollered my way (or my Mum's way, that is arrogant to assume it was all about me come to think of it) when we were touring the Luray Caverns on Wednesday...here were these two 17 year old kids on a family trip who looked less-than-thrilled to be there, but I was standing in front of an illuminated stalagmite for my Mum to take a photo and I hear, "Oh, girl your silhouette...make me wanna light a cigarette..." To be complemented in such a way with a Kanye lyric truly made my night. Too bad he was only 17.  I'm OUT.  NB:  1) JYD = Junk-Yard-Dog 2) Why has Marianna gotten two shoutouts in three days? 3) P.P.S. To those of you who already read this yesterday...is it weird that I edited this entry to add more stuff? Is that very gauche in blog-country? Just putting the question out there.

      Last sleep in Luray.  WOO HOO!  I am sad to say goodbye to the practice, to the doctors, and the wacky nurses...but happy to say "HELLOOOOO, running water that runs! Hello, clean bed and clean sheets and clean house! Say, Starbuck's, it's been a while!"  I am going out with a bang though.  1) Last night, I had my last dinner chez Dr. S's. The whole fam and I sat out in the garden, ate their fresh vegetables (tomato and salt-shaker-in-hand-styles) and just enjoyed a gorgeous summer evening. That night, the girls' "rose" of the day was playing kitchen with me - I could seriously eat them, they are so deliciously adorable. 2) Tonight, I'm having dinner at Luray's finest restaurant (I know, world's tallest midget, but still)...called Jordan Hollow. My Mum and bro are driving down just to take me out. And see the Luray Caverns, of course. It has taken me a month to do it, but Marianna Law can sleep easy tonight knowing that I have finally fulfilled my duty-as-tourist. 3) The office is having a farewell breakfast for me tomorrow morning - they are the nicest. I will miss them (bless their hearts) and they are all "doll-babies" (yet another new one to my vocabulary.) 4) Last but  definitely  not least, Jake Gyllenhall is a free man! Heather, the front-desk clerk, posted a picture of him on the bulletin board in the kitchen at the office today because they all know that he's one of my top five (the nurses and I did a top five the other day - let's just say that my #1 was Tobey Maguire versus the general Luray-ian nursing concensus for  their  #1 was Van Diesel...) and apparently he and KiKi broke up! What a day, what a day.  NB: I am trying to figure out how you can post comments - as of right now, I understand it's super involved and&nbsp;annoying, so I'll get back to you when things are a little less complique.  &nbsp;

      This past weekend, I was made a believer. A believer in a behaviourist approach to human psychology, a believer in behavioural modification, and a believer in the good, the very simple and selfless  good , of people. I visited my best friend Carly in Boston where she is completing her Masters in Psych in conjunction with working at the New England Centre for Children (NECC). NECC is a residential school for autistic children - and it blew me away. I spent the entire day on Saturday with Carly at work - starting at 8 AM when we woke the kids up, gave them their meds in a way that was so&nbsp;systematic it&nbsp;put any UVA ward to shame, made them breakfast, and started a day so filled with routines, schedules of reinforcement, and token societies that it made the Skinnerian lobe of my brain ache. It is near impossible to do the school, the kids and the teachers justice in written words, but let me try - by illustrating my favourite example of the day, April and Carly.  &nbsp;  April is Carly's "case." Rather, Carly is April's "case manager." And each case manager works so intimately with their child that it is more parenting practice and more involvement than the most super of Super-Mum's. So April has a diagnosis of "Pervasive Developmental Disorder" - and Autism as well - and when Carly inherited her case last year, April was almost entirely non-verbal, and would communicate with others by way of a sign book - literally, pointing out little signs to spell "I would like...to eat...french fries." She would also moan or yell to get your attention (now&nbsp;it's "Excuse me, Carly&nbsp;- I want&nbsp;juice. Excuse me,&nbsp;Carly - is&nbsp;Carly coming back on Monday? Excuse me, Carly -&nbsp;go Carly's house?")&nbsp;She would "flop" on the floor, something apparently common to a lot of autistic children when they are being defiant and just completely shutting everything out. She would 'perseverate' (and still does to a certain extent...) on certain topics of conversation...all of these things, of course, make functional living difficult. And the goal of NECC is to turn these kids into functional human beings - to be able, ultimately, to live on their own.  &nbsp;  So April has rules that she follows. To earn tokens. To cash in for reinforcers.   I'm not kidding. 5 minutes of "following my rules" means April gets a token to put on the velcro strip in her rule book. And to ice the Skinnerian-cake, this is all timed by a constantly running 5-minute countdown stopwatch that she carries around with her in her rule book. So the day is sprinkled with "beep-beep's" of April's watch, a differently-pitched "BEEEP - BEEEP" of Nico's timer, and so on and so forth. Basically, if April has had "good hands" (no grabbing or flapping), "quite voice" (no yelling or echolalia), "listen to your teacher", and "stay on your feet" she gets a token. Throughout the day, April would cash it in for "whispers" (my highlight of the day - Carly makes whisper noises in April's ear because April just thinks that's the greatest and extremely reinforcing), my-little-pony time, or "brown-candy" (Reese's peanut butter cups). These have all been determined, of course, through a thorough Preference Assessment to isolate what exactly is the most reinforcing thing for each child in the school. Tailor-made, each and every programme - it was truly amazing.  &nbsp;  And then there was Annie. Who is as classically 'autistic' as one would imagine - and gifted in music like I've never seen. Annie would live in her own little musical world if she had the choice - a world that means she can listen to a song once on the radio and sing it and drum it back to you like she's heard it a million times before. This was perfectly illustrated to me when she was tapping her knuckles on a chair and humming something that made my hair stand&nbsp;on end - sure enough, it was "Jesus Walks" by Kanye West...and it was perfect. At one point in the day, I sang "Annie" to Annie - 'The Sun'll Come Out,' 'You're Never Fully Dressed...' and she held me and squeezed me so hard while I was singing to her that I still get goosebumps thinking about it.  &nbsp;  I really feel like this entry can't do it justice - but let me say that there are people out there, like Carly, and the other teachers at NECC, who are the most selfless, patient,  PATIENT  people I have ever seen...and that altruism still exists. That interest and attention in a child are still the keys to raising a functional human being. And that all anyone really wants at the end of the day, autistic or not, is love.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       Am I really committing to this?   It appears to be the case. What can I say but Ken Jennings has inspired me - in life, generally -&nbsp;to start carping the diem a-la old-school me. To do the things I've been back-burning for too long. Like start writing a blog. And train for the Toronto marathon. And finish reading Middlesex and What We Talk About When We Talk About Love...and start reading The Book of Disquiet. And write more (blog and non-blog). And start cooking more...essentially, in my own twisted way, I have rationalised the self-indulgent behaviour of writing a blog (and&nbsp;assuming that what I write will be read by you) by making the very true statement that it will let me be in better touch - and when you feel like tapping into my world, bienvenue. I would love to have you. One thing - the spelling is all-canadian, all-the-time.  But what of this Ken Jennings character? For those of you not in North American, the deal is that I have been watching Jeopardy! religiously now for close to a month...and have become truly obsessed with Ken Jennings, the 31-time winner who has over $1,000,000 in earnings.&nbsp;It is putting it lightly to say that&nbsp;the guy KNOWS ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING. He simply can't be beaten - and to boot, he's wholesome, kind, funny, sarcastic...an altogether dreamboat of a Salt Lake City-an. I'm not actually attracted to the guy (god, no...it's not like I just freaked out over him with a bijillion descriptors and sang his praises and named my blog after him), but there's no denying that his mind is awe-inspiring. I was worried for a while that he was related to this obnoxious guy in my medical school class, but thankfully, he's not. Jennings rather is a humble software engineer and not into canning jams&nbsp;and saving lives all in the same day.  So, why, you may ask, have I been watching Jeopardy! every night? Like, pathetic, right? Well, what's even more exciting is that I have been calling Luray, VA home for the past month...and have been living on a RANCH while completing my family medicine rotation. And what's more is I love it. I love the small town life. It is slower,&nbsp; it is sweeter. I watch the sunset every night over the Blue Ridge mountains and sit by the South Fork of the Shenandoah river...I assist in the birthings of baby cows and I helped diagnose one of the farm doggies with a weird intestinal worm. I get house calls (or rather trailer-calls as I am living in a converted trailer - like one on cinder-blocks) from the people who run the ranch and I get pecan pie on my doorstep as a thank-you. And all in a day's work - toenail extractions, pap smears, well-baby checks, injections, psych interviews, hospital visits, emergency&nbsp;bone infections, tick-borne illnesses&nbsp;x7&nbsp;(TODAY!)&nbsp;and a whole lotta community love.  But here are some of my personal favourites:  1) Today, actually: I was driving to work. I  guess  I was speeding. Like, 42 in a 25 zone. SO I get pulled over, not actually realizing at the time that I had done anything wrong. The officer struts over and is all "Ma'am...do you realize you were doin' fowwwwrty-twooo in a 25 zone?" And I'm all, "No, sir! I'm terribly sorry sir - just on my way to work sir and was worried of&nbsp;running a couple of minutes late, sir." (Typing out dialogue can be annoying...let's just leave it at me sir'ing him up and down, smiling, and being profusely apologetic, for which he was finally like, "S'alright, hunny...you just watch yourself, y'hear? Speeding is a CRIME, no matter how purdy y'are."   2) Monday: My car was sizzling h-izz-ot. The weather here, by the way, has been like 100% humidity for 3 weeks straight. Anyway, something was up with the car, so I had to get it looked at. Well, Suzie, one of the office nurses who I love, was like, "Take it to Dirty Tom's. And if you wear a skirt, and bend over to pick up your cheque-book, he won't charge you. Or you can pay him in whiskey...your decision, really." I kind of laughed out of awkwardness because she told me this in front of the doc I'm working with, but secretly took note. That afternoon, I drove to Dirty Tom's. In a skirt. With my cheque-book in hand. And shocker - I got a free inspection with the bend-and-snap.  3) The nurses: RULE. I love them. They all colour-coordinate their outfits with their pens, get their nails done on Wednesday nights (I joined them last night and got my toes done) and have a hilarious vocabulary that I'm trying desperately, despite the painfully-obvious-northerner in me, to emulate. Things like, "She was talkin' something HATEFUL on the phone...and I was like, Mmmmm....why don't you take those pro-times and shove 'em up your butt Miss Lillian? Give her a little night-school nursing course and you'd think she's Mareeee Cureee."   I'm going to have to cut this short (as if...I'm sure it's like marathon-styles already) but I'm excited to have started this new chapter in my life...I'm heading out for pizza and a movie with my doc and his wife, who are like world's coolest people and young parents.  Y'all stay tuned!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      My Mum's going for surgery Saturday. THANK GOD - Dr. Helm of career-day fame was wonderful and straightforward about it today when my whole family drove down to Charlottesville for an appointment in his clinic - he said there's a huge synovial cyst from wear'n'tear sitting on her spinal cord, causing her symptoms, and he can remove it. And squeeze her in. On Saturday. I felt like kissing the man.  So she's all set to go, and it truly is perfect timing - I'll be heading back down to start newborn nursery and Peds clinic, and be able to check in on her multiple times (though she'll only be in the hospital for a couple of days post-op) - my Dad and bro are planning on checking out Farmington while they are down there, and possibly joining the golf club which would be absolutely fabulous as far as I'm concerned; and Scott said he'd be available for a Psych consult if need be during my Mum's stay. Today was very fun and serendipitous, all things considered - starting from this morning when Christmasfish was back at Fairfax hospital for morning lecture and I happened to sit in the second-to-last-empty seat only to have him sit next to me...then continuing on with a fun car trip down to Charlottesville with the fam playing our weird road-trip games like "The Initial Game" (pick the initials of a famous person and everyone else gets 20 guesses)...I won the game with the ultimate trump, Alonzo Mourning. What was most wonderful about the day was walking into the Neurosurgery Clinic and literally being greeted by the most professional, friendly, and efficient people ever - my Mum was literally seen in under 10 minutes and then we were there for an extremely thorough and thoughtful visit. Dr. Helm remembered me from when I had spoken to him at career day and asked him (at the time, more hypothetically-speaking than anything else) what my Mum should do about her pain. Later on in the visit, his Physician's assistant was incredibly kind and assured us that Dr. Helm is extremely anal about surgeries of people he "knows" - and that no one scrubs in on the case but him (like, I guess I "know" him...but barely...appreciated all the same Greg!)  Then, when we were getting all the pre-anesthesia stuff done (bloodwork, EKG, etc) my Dad and bro walk in with Take-it-away for lunch...and Scott who they found somehow on their way into the hospital! So it was a good day, and I slept easy on the drive home knowing the wheels are in motion. It's amazing what a "plan" can do for your peace of mind.  I'm on call for the last time tomorrow night - so this most definitely deserves a dance party, good snacks, and ordering in from Jasmin Garden...and by the way, thanks for your calls and emails, and for loving me right back.

      ***Disclaimer - this may be kind of crazy-talk...don't read if you want light and fluffy  Sometimes I truly think I am hypomanic. I have a history - I can trace it back to being 8, and going to choir rehearsal, except that I had forgotten to give my parents the notice that there wasn't rehearsal that particular Wednesday. I got dropped off, and realized my mistake - the church basement where we rehearsed (the church basement that raised me every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday from when I was 7-15) was empty. So what did I do - what did an 8 year old kid do? I walked. I explored Church street - gay town - I bought french fries and ate them as I walked around to kill 2 hours. I watched the suits leave their glass office building at the corner of Church and Bloor. I sat in the park with the Keith Herring mural. I watched men walking with men, kissing each other, holding hands - eating hot dogs on the street together. I started to write a movie in my head - and went to the Korean corner store, and bought a notebook and pen and started to write it. At the time, I was taking music history with Clayton Scott, the greatest music teacher I have ever had, and we were studying Beethoven’s 5th (among other great works). I had decided that in my movie, I would die in the end, and the way it would happen was that I would be in England, in the green, foggy country, by the cliffs of Dover. There would be this whole sequence where I was all dressed in an eyelet-lace white dress, and be powdering my face in front of a mirror, and putting on fire-engine red lipstick, when a black London cab pulled up to my house. No dialogue – only the  5th  building in the background. I got into the cab – and off we went, driving through rolling hills of green (this image inspired by the hymn  Jerusalem  that I was also obsessed with) and eventually, I got dropped off at the cliffs of Dover. Naturally, at this point, it was raining, and my dress became spoiled with mud and wet. As the symphony swells, so did my conviction and I took a run at the cliffs. I didn’t trip, or hesitate, and nothing was slow-motion – it was fast and real and I flung myself into the English channel. This next part was my favourite because it both scared me and thrilled me – my float down – now things slowed, and my dress just fluttered like white bed sheets settling onto a mattress, as I floated in the rain, in white, to my death.  GOD. How come I had these thoughts as an 8 year old? My flight of ideas, question of suicidal tendencies, most definitely grandiosity…it has no doubt set me up for some intensity down the road (by the way, I'm still composing the soundtrack in my mind to this day - some of you have had a sneak preview here and there). If I am indeed bipolar, I’m pretty damn functional – and somehow I’ve gotten away without any mood stabilizers. But there have been times (very recent times) when I’m wary of myself…like how movies hit me maybe a little too hard these days (or maybe not, and maybe I really am one of the lucky ones like you told me)…and I do impulsive things (add another one to the check-list) like go to 3 Best Buys and Borders and Tower Records looking for the soundtrack to Garden State, and in the meantime, buy Frou Frou’s  Details , a Paul Simon box-set, and the new Franz Ferdinand. Like how I can swing so hard, from a sobbing mess yesterday afternoon at the movies, to a fully functional med-student-with-the-most-ess this morning and nail my presentation on Periodic Fever Syndromes in Children. I walk the walk, but my head talks a different tune sometimes.   I speak my mind. I tell people when I love them. I love a lot of people.  Last night we went out for my brother’s 23rd birthday dinner. It was wonderful and cozy and all the warm things that family is to me. Stable, secure, unconditional love. There was a table of four men beside us, well into their dinner when we arrived, and feasting even more on conversation. One man raised his glass – and said “Love is like the shore – it takes the shape of whatever it meets.” I almost cried. Cried for all the very different shapes love has taken for me recently - love that is far, far away right now; love that called me from Bangkok last night. Cried for a different kind of love that I wouldn’t trade for the world no matter how painful the process. Cried for my Mum who’s back is letting her down and is in a wheelchair (temporarily, I’m praying).  A good cry is my GREATEST release. That, and a long run.   If I worry, it’s only temporary. I can be melodramatic. But I know I’m OK in the end.  I let go. I’m in, not out. I do leave my things behind ‘cause it’s all going off without me – and excuse me, maybe I have been too busy writing my tragedy. These mishaps I do bubble wrap – when I’ve no idea what I’m like – so I let go, I jump in, and it’s alright, because there’s beauty in the breakdown.

      Catherine and I just woke up and were watching VH1's "Best Month Ever" for July - what can I say, fabulous minds think alike, and Ken Jennings was named the 4th best thing about July (just behind midgets on The Amazing Race, Fat Joe's "Lean Back" and hot John-on-John action on the campaign trail).  That show is hysterical - and I'm obsessed with the clever and sassy one who has widely spaced front teeth...and was wearing a green shirt with the initials "a.w.k" on it. There is a prize out there for anyone who can give me his name.  More to come on my adventures from last night - including tapas at Mas which was absolutely delicious, drinks with Ante and her parents at Zocalo and then a HOT HOT HOT night at Club 216...the irony being that I got hit on more in one night than I have been in 2 years in Charlottesville, by straight men in a gay club...

      Today was amazing. I went in early this morning as I had been away the whole weekend and felt that I needed to get things in tip-top shape before the new interns rolled onto the wards...So I woke up at 5, was outta here by 5:30 and at the hospital just after 6, with a fabulously hot and sugar-free-vanilla-ey latte cupped in my little hands, ready to take on the day. I walked into the resident's resource room only to interrupt sign-out, when the night shift was reporting the goings-on to the new, totally bewildered and harried-looking interns. I introduced myself to my new intern who is really sweet and immediately felt this surge of calm come over me - like, how was this routine for me already? How was I "what's up'ing" the nurses and 2nd and 3rd year residents on my way onto Peds north like I owned the place? And the fact that I am all OVER "mypatientyourpatient.com" and the "Inovanet" patient database was a good and comforting feeling - it sucks being new, and all of a sudden, that title had moved past me...and I basked, for a moment, in the rays of realization that I was semi-legit.  The day just kept unfolding in my favour. Aside from the fact that I temporarily lost a note I had written on my new patient (and ran like a crazy woman from Peds north to south back to north again, with HIPAA regulations flashing before my eyes and fantasizing about the worst possible outcome - like my attending calling me into her office with the note on her desk after her having found it in the women's bathroom) and the fact that I totally jammed the photocopier in the resource room (Pete was able to fix it in a jiff, GOOOOOOOOOOOO EMT's!!!), I had a fantastic day. Morning rounds with cardiology was fascinating (Peds cardiology? Murmurs are like music, and I  do  have a good ear for that sort of thing...) and then I got my new admission on the adolescent floor and made a friend for life. My patient has a VP shunt, this horrifically-sounding but innocent enough thing that basically shunts spinal fluid from your brain down into your belly via a tube inside of you. You get them when you are overproducing the spinal fluid or your drainage system is blocked somewhere. Anyway, she's had the thing in place since birth, and has had 5 revisions of it in her life (4 of which were in her 1st year), but here she was for revision #6, on her 15th birthday, and scared as hell.  I immediately established good rapport with the family - they were kind and rational people, and my patient and I just seemed to click. It's times like these that I have to remind myself I'm not a camp counselor but rather an almost-doctor - I'll find that I'm sitting on the bed and looking at pictures of her friends from home with her when all of a sudden I'll slip in a neuro-check and cardiac exam and then go right back to talking about Sponge-Bob, how she knows sign-language, and how chocolate is  definitely  superior when it comes to milkshakes. So when Dr. Magram, the wonderful pediatric neurosurgeon asked if I wanted to scrub in on her shunt-revision that afternoon, I was all, HECK YES! She was happy because I'd be there from pre-op to recovery room, her parents were happy, and of course I was completely honoured and excited to participate. There were a lot of tears in pre-op, and I did my very best to distract and console her all at the same time. We swung it so her angel-teddy bear could come into the OR with her, and as I wheeled her in, with my little cap and mask on, I got chills when I heard the page for "Dr. Magram and Dr. Scott, please report to OR #17." I looked at Dr. Magram, totally bug-eyed with surprise and concern at the page - like, did he think I was running around dropping the doctor-thing like some inappropriate jackass-of a med student?! And all he did was wink at me - which of course gave me another set of chills. Now you may be asking yourself, "Was the OR minus 40 degrees - why the hell are you getting so many chills?" and the answer is yes, it was DAMN cold in there...in fact, I highly recommend thick jog-bras for us all to avoid an obvious embarrassing situation...but despite it all, I was completely warm inside.   Surgery lasted a while - and I got back up to the Peds floor late, after everyone had signed out - except my favourite intern Noel, who was conveniently packing up as I was getting ready to go. So I ended my day full circle with Starbuck's round two, this time in the rain with Noel. We talked about music, being from a foreign country (he was born in Argentina), The Streets (I gave him Original Pirate Material to convince him that despite NPR giving it a so-So review, it actually is brilliant) and our favourite actors. Then I came home to a French dinner and some really good wine, and am just about unconscious now. I love life today - I'll probably fall asleep smiling.
