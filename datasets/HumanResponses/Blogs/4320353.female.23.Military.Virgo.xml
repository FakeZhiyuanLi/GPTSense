       I have decided to take the rest of the day off. Given my current situation I have the authority to say when my own day is over. All I have to do during my remaining days here is go around post getting signatures from different areas of administrations to out processes so I can leave. Showing up to the morning accountability formation is the only obligation I have to the company now, which kinda sucks because I have to get up at 6:00am every morning to walk to formation stand around for like thirty minutes then go back to my room to go back to sleep for another two hours, get up and do what ever else I have left. Which isn't a lot.    I am almost done, so I usually end up sitting in my room watching TV or play video games with Ryan. He gets off work at 2:00pm every day so it works out okay for us to have the whole rest of the day to spend together.       My birthday is coming up on Saturday. I'm pretty excited, although I'm not sure what Ryan has planned. He has bought me presents and has been excited to give them to me.    I will be turning 24, funny I don't feel older. O-well I guess that's why they say age is only a number, and you're only old if you feel old. Yeah, whatever!!      Ummm that's about all I have for you today. I'm sure things will get more exciting when I get home and then to Kuwait.  Take care.  Peace!

      So here I am sitting on my couch, thinking of ways to spend some of my daily time. I was just sitting here surfing the web and decided to check my dad's Blog, which he hasn't added to since last Monday, so I thought I would go and start my own. I am pretty sure this will please my family. I don't get to talk to them that often because I am on the other side of the Country in Georgia getting ready to go over to Kuwait. (Oh yeah, I guess I should let everyone know I am from a suburb right on the outskirts of Sacramento, CA.) And I know once I get over there the phone calls will be even more rare because they have no way of calling Kuwait so it will all be up to me, and even I don't know how often I will be able to use the phone once I get there. I'm pretty sure I will be able to use the computers to update this blog more than being able to call everyone and let them know what's going on in my life. Plus I'm sure they will love to read about what I will be going through over there. I'm actually a little excited to go. I have all ready been over there for about a week while enroute to Baghdad, Iraq and on the way home. It was nothing to be worried about compared to the constant bombings in Iraq.  Right now I am stationed out here in Augusta, GA at Fort Gordon. I have been here for nearly two years. My technical job is a Cable systems installer and maintainer, but the only time I do my job is when we get deployed which has only happened once, so other than that you can find me raking leaves, mowing grass or any other odds and ends that they can think of to take up our time durring the day. In January they sent a group of twelve of us to Baghdad to install the AL Faw palace (yes, one of Saddam's palaces) it was to be made into a major coalition and army headquarters for Iraq. That same palace is currently being used for Saddam's trial. So I kinda feel like we did something important and very useful for our country.  I also came home with a new boyfriend. We were over there together, got to know each other better, decided we like eachother (duh), and started dating. We have been friend the whole time I have been in Georgia so we knew eachother but never pursued one another, could be because I was in a relationship :) It's been really great for me so far. There is only one bad thing that is going to happen between us, I am leaving in a month and he (Ryan) has to stay here. Allthough he has been trying to get an assignment to come over there with me, it hasn't been looking good for the home team. We have talked about it and decided that we were going to stay together and see where things go from there. We have been spending all our time together, and I will be bringing him home to "Meet the Parents" in about two weeks. Hope that goes as well as planned. I want to take him to San Francisco one day while at home. He will also be meeting my highschool friend Rachael. I'm sure I will be able to show him a good time. He has never been to California. He is from Pennsylvania, which I got to see last time I went on leave he took me home to meet his family, which I loved. We had a lot of fun. Well, I guess I should go and do stuff so I can come back and write about it later. Take care. ;)
