      today was a tiring day. summer school is completely owning me. its going well tho praise God lol. ive been lame lately. i feel lame lately. not sure why. or mebe i do kno why. we shall see. i realized im pretty good at fooling myself. thats not really cool lol. im missing some biblia that all. need some of His Word cuz ive been starving lately. how intense would it be if everyone took their faith seriously i mean goodness gracious there would be sooooo many crazy strong and intense kids cuz of His strength and power. ive experienced most of those situations that "take" or "distract" people that follow Christ away.&nbsp; from the slow and sublte being downright lazy and compromises and those life changing tragedys (or blessings depending on ur perspective), including jus situations that eat away at our spirit. sounds melodramatic but those of u that hav experienced it kno wut im talking about. i think i realized for me, and i dont think its only me, but the one thing aside from doubt and compromise, is the desire to not "man up" and meet the conflict face to face and fight it out. or when i do and get owned, give up and let things be. ill coin the term "pure lameness" for this type of compromising and lack of determination. i hav been ridiculously lame for a while and it feels terrible. the worst part is that i kno and am not consitantly stepping into the ring when i get knocked out. lately im in that transition stage of learning to "man up" so to speak. im not hoping that i am, cuz im not willing to take no for an answer anymore, so i am in that transition stage. and i wont be there for long God willing. on a cooler note, new Pillar album Where do we go from Here. ridiculously awesome. get it. i thought its better than the first. its a close one. anyways, i got sunburned at the pvbc annual picnic =) was very cool stuffzors, not the sunburning but the picnic. hopefully goin beaching somtime this week. summer school ends next wed. that makes me smile =)
