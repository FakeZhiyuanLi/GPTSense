      I didn't sleep much at all last night. Much like any other night, I lay awake in bed trying to make sense of my life. Sometimes I feel like I outside of my body watching my very own life take place. As if I am an innocent bystander.  I feel as if God is dangling the missing pieces in front of me and I cannot grasp them. It is like he is showing me the way but I cannot get there from here.   Last night while I was lying in bed trying to go to sleep, I kept going over the things that have happened to me during my life. Trying to figure out where I went wrong. Of course I accomplished nothing except achieving a new level of sleep deprivation. I am quite good at that, I think if I were in the olympics I would win the gold in the sleep deprivation category.  How do you learn to love yourself? Is it something you actually learn to do, or do you just achieve some kind of inner peace? How do you learn to love someone that apparently nobody else likes? I have been a failure at most everything I have tried. If other people cannot see the good in me, how am I supposed to see it? They are on the outside looking in, I am on the inside looking out. Although sometimes I do feel as if I am the one on the outside looking in.   One would think that during those long and endless nights when I cannot sleep that I could find the answers to some of these questions. But those long nights lying awake in my bed just lead me to more and more questions. Questions that run so deep that I have no clue where to look for the answers. Do I dig even deeper?  So for now I am standing in the middle of an empty room. I am holding in my hand the one piece of the puzzle that I may have figured out. The piece of puzzle that says "We all need unconditional love, but first you have to find that kind of love within yourself."  That particular piece of the puzzle is very odd shaped as most puzzle pieces are. I have also noticed that it is quite heavy and I cannot make out the coloring or any kind of pattern on that piece of puzzle. I have no idea what to do with it, where to put it.

      I watched Oprah the other day. Her guests were the Judd family. The subject was Wynonna Judd's weight problem. This was her second appearance on the Oprah Show to discuss her issues with her weight. I watched the first show as well. I cannot begin to explain how she touched my heart that day. Had it not been for the fact that she is famous, I would have sworn we were one in the same. She said things that made sirens and whistles go off in my head, I swear. Things that I had never admitted to myself, things that were hiding deep inside my heart. If I have ever had an epiphany, I had one that day. I just wish my husband hadn't been sitting beside me while I was watching it. I had to actually guard my reaction because if I had let myself react the way I had wanted to he would have thought I was a complete lunatic.  Talk about hitting the nail on the head, if I had not known better I would have looked for a hidden camera during the show. I swear she was in my head and in my heart, speaking my deepest darkest emotions and fears. At one point I just knew Oprah was going to knock on my door and say something like "This is your life!".  The strangest thing of all is that the Judd family is from Ashland, KY and I live about 10 minutes from there. I never knew Wynonna when we were growing up because we went to different schools, but we lived only minutes apart and I guess that made me feel the connection even more.  The one thing that struck me the most was her comment that we were all looking for unconditional love. That was one thing we all needed and deserved. We all needed and deserved to have one person in our life who loved us unconditionally and her entire life she had strived for it, but never attained it. Oh my gosh, it was almost like "DING DING DING"! The bells and whistles were going off in my head. I had never admitted it before, but that's what I want. Maybe that is why I want a child so badly. I want someone to love me unconditionally, and I don't have that now, nor have I ever had it.  Don't get me wrong, my husband loves me and I have no doubts about that. But even a husband has conditions on his love. I am sure there are things I could do that would change how my husband feels about me, so it isn't really unconditional.  I used to think that a mother's love was unconditional. Unfortunately I have learned that it isn't. At least not for me it isn't. My mother is very judgmental and tends to make me feel as if I don't live up to her standards. I know I am a huge disappointment to both of my parents, but that is something I have begun to learn to deal with recently.  Wynonna did say that we have to love ourselves unconditionally and once we do we will be so much more satisfied. I guess that is what I need to do, learn to love myself. I realized while listening to Wynonna talk, that I do like myself, but I don't really love myself.  So I guess I  have a starting point. I am holding the first piece of the puzzle in my hand. Now all I have to do is figure out where to put it.

      I often wonder if life is nothing more than random occurences. Or is it truly fate? Until recently I believed wholeheartedly in fate. Lately I am starting to wonder if life is random. My family always told me I think about things too much. In that respect I take after my dad. As a child I always thought of dad as "the thinker".  When confronted with a problem, my dad didn't always have an immediate answer. Sometimes a day or so later, when you were sure he had already forgotten about it, he would present a solution.  A solution that he had apparently been working out in his mind the entire time.  So even when life is "happening", and I am going about my daily routine, I am thinking about any number of life's mysteries. There are so many aspects of life that make no sense. There is no rhyme or reason. No justification. I want justification. I want to know why it happened the way it did.  I am admittedly very anal about certain things. Those certain things being the very rules I try to live by.     Knowing the difference between RIGHT and WRONG, and making the right choice    Treating EVERYONE with respect    EARNING respect from others    HONESTY, it truly is the best policy    ALWAYS consider the other person's feelings before opening your mouth    RULES, they are there for a reason, follow them and life will be easier on everyone    JUSTIFICATION, this is a fairly new one for me. I recently have started questioning this, so I am still struggling to figure this one out. I am constantly wondering if life is  "FAIR AND JUST".     I have never been one to compare my life to the lives of others. There never seemed to be a reason to before now. Now I spend many hours wondering why I have to struggle with so many issues, and all at the same time. Why it seems like the harder I try the worse it gets.  But most of all I wonder why my life seems like a huge jigsaw puzzle with so many missing pieces. I feel like I am looking at an algebra equation. An equation that I just cannot figure out! Am I trying too hard? Could that possibly be?  I wonder how different my life would have been if I had made other choices in my earlier years. The one thing I can't imagine changing in my life is my husband, so many other choices I wish I could change, but not that one. I am so very happily married, that is the one true blessing in my life. The divorce rate is so high in the United States that of course I am thankful that I have been married for over 12 years and we are more in love than ever. If it were not for my husband and his strength which I draw from, I am sure I would have given up a long time ago. I am lucky to have him by my side.  Sometimes I wonder if over the years maybe I have created my own little world (in my mind). A world that noone else can penetrate. Noone else can understand but me. My expectations of myself are extremely high, as are my expectations of others. I strive to live my daily life in a "do unto others" mode.  I treat people how I would like to be treated, following the rules I mentioned above.  But usually living by those rules limits my world to a population of one.  Maybe my world (the one in my mind) is completely fantasy and there is no possible way it could ever be anything more. But I would like to think that I am not the only person who strives to be a better person on a daily basis.

       I'm not quite sure what possessed me to want to blog, but here I am. I think in part it is my passion for writing that makes blogging appealing to me. But I'm sure that my need to express my inner thoughts is ultimately why I am here. I have a private journal at PO, but there are a few wonderful ladies who also post there and I am not sure they would quite understand some of what will be written (typed) here.  I need a space that can be all about me. Sounds a bit selfish, doesn't it? I'm glad it sounds selfish. It is about time I became a little selfish. This is one place that will be 100% completely about me. No regrets about what I put in here. No worries that someone will think ill of me. I am who I am. Although at times it seems as if noone cares,  I  need to care about me whether anybody else does or not.
