      Yesterday was an exciting day, I didn't have to work any, not even a little bit.  So what I spent my time doing on this glorious, yet not optional occurring, occasion was I went and hit baseballs for a while.  If you've been following my blogs then you realize that I am a baseball fanatic.  Another win for the 'stros last night!!!!  My buddy Gabe came to town, and he and I went out and hit.  That was fantastic.  Yesterday, I did however have to fill out a renewal for my financial aide.  You know filling out forms about your taxes, life, your parent's info, it would be a nightmare to do all the time, which is why, I suppose, that my parents always made me fill out my own shit.  I guess it teaches self-reliyada yada yada. So now I have decided something after a heart to heart with my buddy Gabe.  I realized that I am completely and irrevocably blind to the common flirtations of a woman towards me.  I have always known that I am slight impervious and unaware of such things, but after last night I realize that I basically question flirtations if they are biting me on the lip.  How do I learn to become more aware?  I feel that my senses are working fine.  I just need a good girl friend of mine to work on it with me.  I sound hopeless.  A 23 year old person with absolutely no idea of how to pick up on girls at all.  No I am not gay.  I talked the other night with a girl that I would consider to be the coolest girl to date.  Her name is Joanna.  I have always had a thing for her, that thing extends beyond sheer physical attraction.  Her and I have always had the best conversations, she is intelligent, witty, and of course beautiful.  She lives about 13 hours drive away from me, which kinda give me this distorted view on the distance.  I have a crazy idea to just get up and drive sometime when I have about 4 days off.  She would be worth it, she always has been.  This journal stuff is making me feel better everyday.  I guess I just need to get stuff out like this more often.  I will hit this again later, prolly tonight.

      Well... I got to work today, and it was great!!!  That last line was sarcastic as shit, I can't express how much I hate the daily grind.  It feels more like Chinese water torture but in a slower more appeal attire.  It is always in my putt putt shirt, I never feel this way when I am working with my band.  I guess that I shouldn't complain because I have a better job than most college kids.  I work with some people that have become some of my best friends, but for every single up there is a down, strikes and gutters, you know?  Well, I am excited that the Astros won today!  It is about time, they need to get the ball rolling, because that is my team for the world series this year.  They have the artillery, the talent, the pitching, and my support which is the best of all.  I think that it is funny that people are so worried about the trivial things in life too.  I often to talk to some of the people in high school, mostly girls, and it reminds me of being in high school again.  Being 23 years old and out of high school for going on 6 years, makes me realize how much I have changed in a lot of aspects of my life.  It also reinforces the morals that I have about dating people that are too much younger than me, or not experienced in life in general.  The talk to me about their proms, their "boy problems", being in Love.   Ha... Love!  That is the funniest term that a junior in high school can toss at me.  I talk to a college girl that I work with, who doesn't go to college and talks often to me about a guy that she is "destined to marry," she tells me that "God told her that they were going to marry one another."  What a load.  They have broken up like 8 times, it seems like they would get a hint.  The saddest part about it is that I have a friend that is into this girl and it seems like she would like him, but won't give him a chance because she doesn't see this atrocity that is seemingly perpetual.  He is a good guy that would treat her like a princess yet, she would rather be heart-broken ever now and again by this guy while she sometimes breaks up with him.  I guess second chances just aren't enough sometimes.  Well I talk a lot about nothing, so I guess that I will keep writing from day to day.

      Hullo, all readers of my new blog.  I have just started this today.  You may be asking yourself, "Why?   Why would jObE want to start such a thing?"  The answer to this is peer-pressure.  I have been a victim of it since my friend Debra started this online diary thing.  So, I think that I have some issues, and I don't care so much about others reading it, but I just like to get it out of my system.  FIrst of all is my frustration with life at the moment.  It seems as though life has dealt me one which is confusing and also promising simultaniously.  I have too many interests, and where to devote my time is the largest decision that I will ever have too face.  Time is always our hinderence, and it always seems to pass too quickly, which is why I set small goals of anticipation.  I have learned that a mentality of "A watched pot that never boils," can also apply to your life.  Have you ever wanted something so badly and you started working towards getting it?  It seems to take forever to get and when you finally do you have that euphoric state that you dwell in for a while.  Well I have realized that time can be manipulated by using this to our advantage.  Always have a goal to work towards that has great value to you and you alone because not only does the watched bot never boil, but neither does the anticipated moment ever seem to arrive.  This is my satirical view on how to slow down the flow of time, of course everyone with a job realizes that this is hard to do because you want to speed up the time you are at work and then slow it down when you aren't.  I think jobs bring us all down.  Dealing with incompitance, employers and contemporaries and subbordinates, having to perform slightly simular tasks daily in order to have a place to live as well as afford the luxuries that we persue.  I am guilty of these things too.  I work as an employee of a franchize that is owned by a married couple, whom I like.  I also work trying to get my band going as best as I can, and I find myself having to "smooze" alot.  Smooze is my term for "ass-kissing" aka "politicing."  Sadly to say my band job does not afford me enough to pay for rent so I digress and take the other job which I like ok.
