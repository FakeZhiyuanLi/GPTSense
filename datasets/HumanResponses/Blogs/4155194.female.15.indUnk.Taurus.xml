We tried out 4 station the two days.. and practically everything was nice.. when we were at the door bell making section there was something called the "shouldering" - something tat is very soft and can melt easily and is use for making the door bell P C board.. worh cool .. i actually used the "shouldering" and like sort of make it a "bao" and was acting a lil kidish..lols..  We also get to walk freely around the school during breaks n lunch.. it was fun and our form teacher was actually very nice.. she didn't catch us for bring handphones and etc..  hmm.. the western delights there was nice.. and most importantly it's cheap @ 2.50 per plate for chicken chop or curlet or even grilled fish..=D erhh the instructor there was nice and funny too.. specially for the one at the Pneumatic Control part.. that was actually the most fun part.. =X  Lastly, we didn't had school for two days.. but wow how i wish i could go there practically everyday.. it would be nice..and exciting.. as it seems.. teacher dun even scold u for not bring her hw on tat day... cool har? lols kk         Anyway ..actually after tat ITE trip, we was planning to watch "Last Samurai" but janice suddenly had Choir and everything end up with me and sis in a heat argument..=\ then when we was at home ginwee came up with this crazy idea of having ta watch a movie tomolo but same, it didn't turn up wad we wanted.. so damn sad (long story, wanna knoe come find me)      Wad made me very angry this time was actually cj.. it seems like the whole world is on her side and whereever she goes ppl will always agree but everytimes whenever i ask anyone out the reply was alwae "NO!" so disappointed.. and i did cry becos of this.. there again he was around to comfort me..=\ erhh then it was like FORGET IT dun watch dun watch.. it took me sometimes when i wanted to ask if we could postpone it next fri so can go with out frens.. but it turn out sis ta be upset about it..nahs forget it..we'll go maybe..      she was so upset.. now i wish ta apologize ta her stay happi sorry... i'll nv let frens get into the way anymore..=D love ya sista foreva kk.. have a good night   sorry couldn't get more into details.. i am feeling tired..=Z

       erh first time having a blog? pardon me.. lols when ta catch a movie entitled "Mean girl". Actually our plan was ta go ta the movie with our cousin -pris... and gonna go a lil shopping and follow by the NDP tickets? Then pris told us at the last minute she's not going, gonna get her haircut and i was lky : "why didn't you cut it earlier or maybe u can cut ur hair den come and find us?". Anyway after saving 60 bucks for the movie and we're not going?! That would be so not cool so nevermind we'll go wif our frens and again i so happen to ask janice and caijun ta go after my pestering janice say "ok after i wash my shoe, ok?" then after that she gimme this excuse as "oh mom comming home then everytimes she comes home i won't be able ta go out?" and Caijun did the same "mom dunch allow". *sad* but instead we still go and the worse was tat after reaching there, we made a call ta Darren and he told me tat we cannot get the Tickets!! (why didn't u told me earlier? *long story* ) ah! but nvm he wasn't ta be blame so forget it, its jus so bad luck.  Mei and me went all around suntec, was going shopping?! Omgosh suntec wasn't as place for people who only got 60 bucks with them? so went all ta way ta get the movie tickets after tat we've still got around an hour for the movie ta begin? ahh! then how so we were lky passing this ice-cream shop and why not we get some ice-cream? indeed suntec wasn't a place for us ta go. The ice-cream there was lky 7 ta 8 bucks?! i would nv wanna eat such ice-cream unless i m having lots of money with me. so instead Auntie Anna was a good choice but still expensive *fussy?*. lols erh after tat we went to carrefour and was looking for titbits ta smuggle inta the cinema.. didn't brought alot but got a few sushi and brought the hotdog at the cinema..  worse still was tat after the cinema me and sis actually got out from the wrong exits to the Mrt.. made a big round and went inta suntec again.. finally reach the Mrt and this oso made me realise from the journey from the cinema to the Mrt u gonna make a very long, tiring walk!.. lols honestly speaking i wasn't an outgoing girl to a certain place i can realli get lost even if it is Singapore??
