      What a confusing weekend it has been.  I left on Saturday kind of "okay" with my a.m. conversation with S.  But, 2 1/2 hours, in the car, all alone, leaves one with a great deal of "think time."  And boy did I think!  And I keep thinking.  And the more I think, the more pissed off I get.  I want to know why everything I ever say to S seems to be said while we are drinking.  I want to know why, once again, when I do tell a guy how I feel - it's too late.  Kym made a good point.  Two people can be PERFECT for each other, but if the timing is wrong, things will not work out.  S's timing was wrong and now my timing was wrong.  I need to talk to him, and tell him that I   will   wait, but I can't promise how long.  I feel that we are PERFECT for each other...and it makes me sad that we can't be together.     "Love Has Past..." I shed a tear You were so near  And now you're gone the reason...me  You have moved on As I sit and watch  You are one in a million And my chance has past  I'll wait for you For how long, I know not  The days may pass But it's you who I want  I love who you are Amazing and strong...

      Oh wow...so, I think that prayer I said, may have worked...in a strange and unusual way...went out to 4th Friday last night with Coach N...we met up with her fam and some people I work with .  KC and I decided to leave and go to the Lumberyard...now, at this point I had enjoyed 1 too many Bacardi Mojitos...and we both could have used a meal...the Lumberyard was a crazy zoo! And way too much fun...H was bartending, and it was great to see him...MM was there and I am really glad that I got to know her through coaching, she is a riot...We ran into the counselor from MMS and I was in shock to see her in action  - a few more drinks and I run into the Clifton crew...I had been looking for KC, so I could leave, but I got a 2nd wind...S was there and we talked a little and kissed a little and I really liked it...and it went a little farther than it should have, in a parking lot...but nothing, I mean NOTHING that I regret...He wanted to come back here with me last night, but I told him that doing so would mean a whole lot more than just one night...The "someone" he had been spending time with was out, too...and I had no idea she was there.  I kind of feel bad, but not really too bad.  I mean, I told him what I wanted...and he said that I made that choice at a really bad time for him, and I told him I would wait...for as long as he needs me to.  And we talked about T and how important she is - to him and to me.  And how much I love her, and getting into something with him does bring baggage, but I am willing (and ready) to accept that.  He wanted to know if I was scared, and I told him yes - scared of getting hurt, scared of hurting him, and scared of hurting T.  I think that meant a lot to him, but I am not sure.      Okay...so, just got off the phone with S and things are back to where they were - no where and I am confused...he says he really likes this girl and she was there last night and I had no idea and he totally lied to her about being with me - just said that we were out "talking," that nothing happened...and as much as I want to be okay with that, I am pissed...I want her to be angry and to tell him to f-off and I want him not to want to be with her...and I just want him...is that selfish?  maybe...  Is that wrong?  probably.  Do I care?  Not right now!  I need to do what is right for me - and maybe that means fighting for what I want.     Good thing LH was there last night, or I may have wigged - it's good to have a "girl" friend who is in with all those "boys."  It makes life a whole lot easier... riiiight....

      I don't know how to explain how I am feeling...J knew that I was upset today...and I told her I didn't want to talk about it.  When she and A pushed it, I kind of snapped.  I told A to "leave it alone," and I knew that J would.  She thought I was upset with her, which I explained that I wasn't.  I told her that I would tell her what was wrong eventually, but I needed to get a grip first.    I saw S's daughter, T, today.  That made it even worse, as I absolutely adore her.  And I know that I could be good for her, too.  I said a little prayer - asking someone to make this work out, if she thinks it's a good idea...I hope, I hope...  I told S today that I still want to be "there" for him if he needs me...damn, I fucked this up so royally that I think I am most angry with myself.    I told J what was going on, but I kind of altered the story a little bit.  I told her that it was a friend dating a friend and that I had a "thing" for the guy, and that "thing" was unresolved...oh well, it felt good to put it into words, even though it wasn't  totally  true.   Yeah, once again, I have fucked things up - and now I am dealing with the repercussions.  Tomorrow is 4th Friday at the Inn on the Lake.  That should be a good time.  I am going with N - she's a riot and we'll have fun.  Hopefully I'll make it home in one piece...but have some fun throughout the evening.        I thought this quote was fitting... "If you love something, let it go.  If it comes back to you, it's yours.  If it doesn't, it never was."

      What an interesting life I lead...well, not really...but a great deal does go on...  I took my 5th graders to our Middle School today.  That makes for a very stressful day.  To see the fear and anxiety in their eyes can be overwhelming...even for me.  But then I got to see kids from my 1st and 2nd years teaching.  Seeing them was amazing. Some of the kids towered over me!  It was great!!    We had a retirement party at school today.  Those are always thrilling...to have to hear about someone's 30+ years of teaching can be very long.   Well, I emailed S last night. To tell him that (after about a year), I was ready to try the whole "dating" thing.  Yeah, well, once again I have screwed myself.  Not like I could expect him to hang on forever, and I kind of had a feeling that he was moving on...and he has.  He is in the beginning stages of seeing someone...and I am the only one who knows...go freaking figure.  So, not only do I have to deal with putting myself out there, and being rejected, but I have to deal with knowing that I am the only one who knows that he is seeing someone.  That sucks.  Flat out.  And it pisses me off that I was such a baby.  I have decided that in order to really be happy, I have to stop putting myself out there - for everyone else.  I need to start letting go of the control issues, and letting people do things for themselves (or me).  I need to be number 1 in my life right now.  I told S that I hope things work out for him.  But I kind of hope they don't.  Is that horrid of me?  I want him to want me again...Oh well, karma, right??  If it works out for me, super.  And if it works out for him, well, good for him...

      So I guess the important things should come first...I am a teacher...I have been teaching 5th grade for three years...I love teaching...I am also a coach...I coach Varsity Cheerleading...I love that too...and I am in Grad School...that, I HATE.  Actually grad school sucks!  Whatever though, 5 more classes and I am done...  I am 25 and single...but working on that.  I kind of have a "thing" for a friend of mine.  He has a 7-year-old daughter and is widowed...It's sad, but something that I have come to grips with (which was hard, no less...)  I mean, to be 25 and getting into something with someone with a child is a scary thing...  Summer vacation starts in 19 school days...whoever said that July and August were the best parts of teaching, they were partly right...  I sound like a horrid teacher, but 11-year-olds turn into hormonal monsters in May and June...It's scary!    Okay, it's 11:30pm and WAY past my bed time...off I go...more to come

      Theuri and I were supposed to hang out on Saturday night, but I knew that he would bag out on me, so I called Kymlyn.  She came to Canandaigua late Saturday night. We headed out for another fun filled night at the Lumberyard.  FYI - Saturday night's in Canandaigua SUCK!  They are very boring.   So we came home and caught up!  We headed to the City for an exciting Sunday.  Can I just say that I LOVE PARK AVE!  We had a great time just walking and talking and looking at things.  I had my first meal of Asian Noodles (think Will and Grace) and Bubble Tea.  Thumbs up to both!  Yummy!!    We met up with Theuri to see Farenheit 9/11...a Michael Moore Documentary.  It was AMAZING!!!  I can't say anything other than, bottom line, Bush sucks!   Here are some random (and funny conversations from the weekend)  Me- I put clean sheets on the futon for you Kymlyn- Screw you, I am sleeping in your bed with you. Me - I figured!   Me - Bye Heath.  I'll be over this week.  I'll get in bed with you some morning (ha ha) Heath - Good, can you come alone this time and stay a bit longer?   Theuri - That was amazing Kymlyn - Yeah, I couldn't believe that girl was clapping when we bombed Iraq.  I wanted to hit her.  Did you see me trying to give her dirty looks in the dark?  Me - Yeah, but some of the things we totally taken out of context. Theuri - And people came with their own agenda's Me - Bottom line, Bush just fucking sucks... Kymlyn - yeah, bottom line...   Yeah, good times with good friends...

      I love teaching...I really do, but I hate what comes with it!  I went to my cousin's baseball tounament today (met Dad and Mike there), and there was an entire team from my school!  I had to have had at least half of the team in my class at one point!  And a student that I will have  next  year was there, too!  AAhhhhhh!!!!   On a different note, I was supposed to meet up with Theuri tonight, but as usual, he can't.  Something to do with his family.  He's supposed to call me back later, but it has been almost 4 hours, so I am not counting on it.  Instead, I called Kymlyn and we are hitting Canandaigua tonight!  Things might get crazy ;)

      yay!  School's out!!  I was back today, though.  Still no where near finished with the packing.  Too bad, too.  I am going to have to head back on Monday.  And I really am not looking too forward to it!  Oh well!!  I decided to put a post on date.com today. What do I have to lose??  Obviously what I am doing isn't working...

      I got an award at our year-end picnic today.  Karen, a TA in our building, had overheard a conversation between, Kristi, another girl, and myself.  Kristi was proud that she had mowed her lawn for the first time ever.  The other girl and I were quick to assert that we had never mowed a lawn.  So, in front of the entire faculty and staff, Karen decided to present us with certificates.  And to harrass us incessantly for what we haven't ever had to do!  ha ha ha

      Well, today was the last day with the kiddies!  And last night we  went out .  When I say "we,"  I mean Kristi and I headed out, but we ran into a bunch of people who work in our District.  Cathy, Mike, Josh, Debbie, and Pete.  Pete actually taught in my building this year...but more on him later!  As I walked up to the porch of the Lumberyard (going inside to meet Kristi and her man, Ben)  I felt as though I knew the people who were ahead of me!  The closer I got, the clearer the picture became!  Running into these guys was great.  It totally made the whole night better.  It was like all of a sudden, I didn't have to be "Kristi's teacher friend,"  I was one of the crowd - a part of the Midlakes crew!    Heath was bartending and we drank a lot.  We also did lots of shots.  I think I did four or five.  I didmy first jagger-bomb.  But that was not planned.  JR came onto to the porch with a tray full of 1/2 full beer glasses.  He handed them out and Cathy made it apparent that I was sharing with her.  No big deal I thought.  Until I chugge 1/2 of it and started to feel funny.  When I found out what it was, although yummy, I thought I was going to die.  Jagger bombs are vile, vile substances, that make the body do funny things!!    At some point, as I was out having a smoke with about 10 people, a couple of girls showed up.  When I say girls, I mean still in high school girls.  One is the daughter of a friend of mine.  I was pissed that she was there.  Kristi, Pete and I went inside.  I got "Miss Hovey"-ed by the girl.  She was scared I was going to blow her in to her mom.  I won't, but I am mad at the girls for being there and the guys for telling them to come.  It wasn't fair.    Pete decided to tell me that the only reason he didn't really talk to me was because he only knew me as "miss Hovey."  And the same for Kristi.  I found that quite funny.  As we sat there laughing, it some how came up that we both were smoking.  He teased me about setting a good example for the kids, I reminded him that  he  is the Phys. Ed teacher, not me!    I hope he gets a real job in our building next year.  I have decided that he is really cute.  He has a great smile and I really enjoyed working with him.  How fun it would be to date a person I work with.  He's a Cortland boy, too.  :)    I didn't get into bed until after 1:30am - and I was hurting today.  Kristi was, too.  And eveyone at school knew it.  We got harrassed endlessly.  Good times!!!

      hmm...the end of the school year.  "They" say that teachers like it.  "They" lied!  I hate the end of the year.  And now that we are packing up to move to a brand new building, I hate it even more.  Today I packed 28 boxes.  That was after a 1/2 day with kids, lunch at the CSCC, and a meeting with my co-teacher for the Summer Academy.  I am exhausted.  And now I have to read for my grad class.  Ick!  I emailed S today.  Got a quick note back.  He said things are going well.  I don't believe him (well, I don't WANT to believe him).  I want them to be going poorly.  I want him to call me and say "let's go out."  I want what I can't have :(    Then there is Theuri.  I am going to see him this weekend.  I am excited about that.  I haven't seen him since my birthday (yes, I turned the big 2-5)  And well, that was a good night ;)  But, he's moving to Chicago...

      well...is it possible to have one of your closest friends be someone you have never met?  because that is the relationship that Carrie and I have.  I "met" Carrie online...we were freshmen in college and getting randomly weird emails.  So, I picked her email address to find out why we were getting these emails...and viola - a friendship is born...and so, Carrie and I have been "penpals" for a whopping 7 years!  It sounds crazy to say that - 7 years!  Wow!  I feel like she is one of the most amazing friends - and yet I have never seen her, or been out drinking with her...we've talked on the phone (she called me on 9/11/01, knowing that I am in NYS and my sister is so close to the city - that was amazing of her)  But, she knows everything about me - more than some of my closest friends!!  And now...she is getting Theuri!  That's right!  I talked to him tonight (yeah, that made my weekend)  And we talked about what he is doing now (internship in a welfare to work program in Rochester) and what is next - which is a move to Chicago in September...and I am afraid of losing him forever.  I think I may be losing one of my best friends!  We are going to hang out this weekend...and I need that!

      So...random things get said to me.  Here are a few of the latest: * "we can dress you up, but we can't take you out...oh wait. you don't even bother to get dressed up..." *  " pot...that's one thing I've never tried...hey, Laura, do you have any connections?" * "and where did you go?  out to have a smoke?" * "drinking on a school night?" * "going out again this weekend?  I think you might have a problem..."  geez...makes me sound like a real winner!  So sorry that I am 25 and act like it!!!!  Still haven't heard from S in a while.  Can't believe it!!  It's been almost a month since everything went down.  I am waiting patiently...4th Friday is this weekend, that was the last time I was out with (?) him...   Off to Seabreeze for a class trip tomorrow...let's hope it's a nice day!!!!!

      Another night out in Canandaigua...I had planed on staying in, but hey, going out is more fun than sitting home - right?    Met KC at Wally's.  Brian was their...I really can't figure him out.  One week he's all "oh you ditched me and I wanted to get to know you..."  and the next week he's with some chick from Syracuse.  They were grossly all over each other - like in high school.  Another Friday means another Friday night at the Lumberyard.  KC was all in a tizzy because apparently she kissed H last weekend.  But I was with her then and the only kiss she gave him was on his cheek.  And he went on to tell his mother that I was the one kssing him (or trying to).  There were tons of people from Clifton out.  It used to be that to see these people I actually had to be IN Clifton.  Oh, no longer...they are ALL in Canandaigua now.  Everyone other than S was out last night.  Haven't seen him in a while.  Miss him - lots.  Talked to H - miss him too.  Seeing him as he bartends just doesn't cut it.  Oh well.

      Things have been chaotic! My jeep is fixed - a mere $200 later and it turns without clicking...now I just need to get the check engine light shut off - thank goodness for new gas caps! ha ha...   Okay...here is a confession! I tried Match.com...I posted two pics and a profile and all I got back were "winks" from ugly, fat, bald, old men! WTF!!!!   Saw H today - he was headed to Clifton, I was headed home. He was driving someone's HOT mustang! Damn boy! The lumberyard grille is working for you!! ha ha   Well, tomorrow is another Friday! Can't wait! Headed to Barneveld to see Gram on Sunday! Pat made 2nd cuts for Empires!!!!

      :)  well...I got summer school!!!  yippee!!  at over $26 / hour, you can't beat it!  And even though I applied for Math, I got ELA - which will be interesting!  K-dawg and I are going to each do 13 days - which will equal out to about $1400 for the summer - plus the $200-300 that I'll make off of camp...yippee!!!   My car is not dying, as a matter of fact I just need new u-joints on the front axle...whew!   Someone saw me in Wegmans with T on Saturday!  They thought she was my daughter!  THis kid told his mom that he "saw the cheerleading coach with her daughter!"  aaahhhahahahaha!!!  well, maybe fate is working in my favor!  Someone else today told me that she thinks I would make a good step-mom to T!  That's a bit more than I needed, but I would love it!

      yep...they do!  Yesterday my "check engine" light went on for no apparent reason...and today there is this horrific metal-on-metal grinding noise when I turn left...say a prayer folks that it is NOT my brakes, and that it is something simple and cheap to fix, because I CANNOT afford something big right now...heck, I can barely afford my rent and car payments month to month...ahhh the joys of life

      As I sit here (at 9am on a SUnday morning), I can only think about the chaos of the past 9 days.  To think that it was a mere week ago when S decided to rock my world, then burn me as an after thought.  ha ha ha...ironic, isn't it?  I guess I am moving on...not on in the relationship sense, but on as in away - away from the chaos and confusion that he brings to my life!  I will never, ever cut him off, but I guess in this case, for now, less is more.     I only have two weeks and three half days of school left.  Yay for that.  I love a few of my kids, but over all, they aren't the greatest bunch.     Friday night was an interesting night out.  We had the District retirement party.  That was the same as usual - nothing too thrilling.  THen a bunch of us went out the the Lumberyard.  KC was telling H all night that she would "make out with him."  Well, not for nothing, but been there, done that - and back off!  She drinks a lot - way too much in my eyes.  The fact that she opens a tab every time we go out, that says a lot.  I worry about her.  A girl I coach with met us out, but she took off to head to Victor, I needed to stay and drive KC home, I was worried about what kind of a state she may be in at 2am - good thing I stayed!    All right, off to get ready for a bridal shower - thrilling, isn't it??  I would be more excited if the only person I knew there wasn't just myself!

      I feel as though people perceive me as this happy-go-lucky, always up, elementary teaching, cheerleader coaching, half-brained twit...and I am sick of it...I hate the fact that because I am loud and (usually) outgoing, I am labeled as an airhead...   I saw T today.  I love her.  I went to S's mother-in-law's house after school.  She and I are very close.  We talked a bit about S, but she has no idea what happened this past weekend...she said a lot about how S needs to be an adult and do what is best for T, not necessarily for himself...and I tried to defend him - I told her that I cannot imagine being a single parent, that it must be overwhelming and that I think he is trying to "find" himself...I have no idea if that was met with annoyance or understanding...I just wish HE knew how much I stick up for him and take care of him...ha ha...we'll see someday...maybe when the timing is right...it's all what fate has in store I guess...

      I have decided that I believe in fate.  And obviously, fate did not have it out for S and I.  I talked to him (if you can call incessant email talking) several times today.  I laid it out there for him.        hey...i understand that you are really into someone, but here are my questions - Why would you put me in the situation you did - knowing that the other girl was there?  Drinking or not, why would you say the things you did?  I know that the things I say when I am drinking usually are things I wish I could say, but then I let me guard down and they come out.  And why did you lie to her (sorry, dont know her name...) about what did happen between you and I?  Because the fact that you did lie about it makes me want to know what had to be hidden.  If you are so "into" her, what makes it okay to lie?      His email back really didn't tell me anything...but I think that could be a good thing.  If he had answers for me, it would mean there is no chance for "us."  He didn't have any answers,  so it leads me to believe that there may be something, that the stars are lining up...and I must wait...

      I guess that's what happens when you spend too much time on the lake :)&nbsp; Yay for days on the lake with the girls from school.&nbsp; I know it sounds a bit juvenille, but it's fun to be with the "in crowd," at school.&nbsp; I think women and girls are very much alike in that way - there is always the "in" crowd.&nbsp; And at school, I am in it.&nbsp; That's fun!&nbsp;   Ryan introduced me to a friend today, as his "mentor, Hovey."&nbsp; I think that is funny!&nbsp; I guess I am just going to be "Hovey" to him!&nbsp; Ha ha!  Yay for pay day in the summer!!&nbsp; Cash is coming in tomorrow :)&nbsp; Sara's coming out, too!&nbsp; It'll be fun!!&nbsp;

      Thanks to dear Kymlyn, my phrase of the day is "hottie boom bottie."&nbsp; Thanks!&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't help it, it was funny when she said it and it makes me laugh when I think about it!  Went out to dinner and out for drinks with my dear friend last night...yay!&nbsp; I love having Kymlyn so close, knowing that I can totally hang out with her whenever!&nbsp; And you know, now we have BFF bracelets!&nbsp; So, we are cool!!&nbsp;   I am trying to convince Beth and Sara to come out here Friday night, but so far, no deal.&nbsp; I don't get it!&nbsp; I have alled them three times...cell phones included.&nbsp; Sometimes I feel like they just don't want to be a part of my life outside of Auburn!&nbsp; I mean, I miss them terribly, and I love hanging out with them when I am in Auburn, but I wish that they would come here once in a while, too!&nbsp; They would have fun if they came!&nbsp;   One of my kids told me that summer school with me is like a comedy show!&nbsp; He went on to say that I am the funniest teacher ever!&nbsp; This all went down after I called his computer a girl, told him to "shut her down and put her away."&nbsp; Ha ha...  Ryan is going to be coaching JV football, which will be fun!&nbsp; I think I am really going to like having him inthe building - and even coaching with him!&nbsp; Yay for cool guys!!&nbsp;

      I got the greatest compliment today!&nbsp; I was talking to my special ed, push in support teacher (Christine) today...we were talking about school (yeah, more shop talk)&nbsp;and she made the comment that I am " the kind of person people want to be around ,"&nbsp; that I " make people smile, just knowing that they are going to cross paths with me in the hall ,"&nbsp; and that it's people like me who " others want to be around ."   WOW!&nbsp; I was shocked and amazed and totally flattered.&nbsp;   I don't want to sound like a stuck up bitch, but I know that I can be fun.&nbsp; And I like to have a good time, but to know that is how my collegues feel about me is so amazing.&nbsp;   Now, my next goal is to make that same person the person who some guy wants to be around.&nbsp; Because darn it all, I am so sick of being single.&nbsp; And I am worried, because I know that pretty soon (as in less than a month) I am going to be back "in season" and that makes for an extremely difficult time at having a social life.&nbsp;   I  have  decided though, that I am NOT going to allow cheerleading to rule my life this year.&nbsp; So, I  will  be going out after football games.&nbsp; I will  not  allow practices and competitions to run my life.&nbsp;   There is no way I am going to be the 25-year-old I want to be, if I allow my "adult responsibilities" to rule EVERYTHING I say and do!    On a totally different note, I saw Sue yesterday.&nbsp; And she told me that she had talked to Heath about the night that he was supposed to come out (after the bar closed) with Kristi and me (remember, he told me to come get him at 2:15, I called him at 2, told him I was on the way, he told me to call back in 5, I did and got his voice mail).&nbsp; Well anyway, he told his MOTHER that the reason he didn't come with me (back to my apt) was that he knew that we would drink more and that would lead to him making choices that he knew wouldn't be responsible!&nbsp; WOW!&nbsp; I am totally impressed with him!&nbsp; (but a little disturbed that he talks to his mom about us that way...especially since she is a coworker/friend...)

      I love my sister, but I hate her for making me like country music!&nbsp;   &nbsp; Today was a mellow day, and I am totally cool with that!&nbsp; I cleaned.&nbsp; I went to Target (bought school supplies).&nbsp; I went to Old Navy (spent more $$ than I should have, but damn I am going to look good!).&nbsp; I went to WalMart (more school supplies, and a new carpet for my new classroom).&nbsp;   I planned out my summer school week - sort of (but I have a great plan in my head).  I called Beth and Sara to see if they want to come out here next weekend.&nbsp; Sara was supposed to call me back, but didn't (no suprise there, I am sure I will hear from them sooner or later, though).  &nbsp; Oh, I donated clothes to the Church clothes drive. I think I must have given them close to $400 in jeans, shirts, shoes, and bags.&nbsp; Seriously!&nbsp; FOur garbage bags of stuff - and one bag alone was express jeans!&nbsp; Yikes!!!&nbsp;   I am very excited to be going out with Kimberly on Tuesday night!&nbsp; Yay for good times in Rochester!!!!!!!&nbsp;

      Yes, another Friday in Canandaigua means another 4th Friday :)&nbsp; I LOVE 4th Friday!&nbsp; Tonight was the band Hazer, from Clifton.&nbsp; I love Hazer!!!&nbsp; I hadn't heard them before, but I had heard of them.&nbsp; They freakin' rocked the joint, I had more fun drinking and dancing than I have had in a very long time!!!   Of course after the Canandaigua noise ordinance kicked in (at 9pm), Kristi and I headed for (you guessed it), The Lumberyard!&nbsp; Yay for nights @ the Lumber yard WITHOUT the entire Clifton gang!&nbsp; Yay yay yay for that!!!   Interesting conversation tonight, though...I was talking Cathy, reminiscing about that lovely Wednesday that school got out (and how extremely hung we all were the next morning), when she asked me where JR was...now, to me that was totally out of the blue and I told her that I had NO idea...she looked shocked and asked if we just didn't care what the other did some nights.&nbsp; I told her that I really never cared what he did.&nbsp; She went on to ask how long we had been together!&nbsp; I LAUGHED so freakin hard!&nbsp; JR? I asked her.&nbsp; I told her we didn't date...and she asked if I was sure!!!!!&nbsp; ha ha ha!!&nbsp; I told her I was sure.&nbsp; She went on to tell me that someone (She couldn't remember who) had told her that he and I had been dating for a long, long time!&nbsp; I think that is so funny!&nbsp; I love small town rumors...oh&nbsp; wait, I lied!!   Okay, it is way past my bed time, and I am heading to Syracuse for a lax tournament tomorrow...so, until then...g'night!

      So, I said the other day that I had seen Steve out, and that he had totally blown me off...and I was (rightfully) pissed off...  So, today (yes, today is Thursday and I saw him last Friday) I got an email from him.&nbsp; And he told me that he is happier than he has been in a long time, that "Tiff" has a hard time trusting people and he has worked really hard at this, and that he hopes that I will tell people that we "just talked" that night.  Hmmm...WHY is he telling me that he's sorry, he just felt like he was in a bad position???&nbsp; WHY is he asking ME to lie for him??&nbsp;   I will not lie.&nbsp; Not that anyone has asked me about that night, but I am not going to lie.&nbsp; Nor do I think that he should.&nbsp; And I told him that.&nbsp; I also told him that I thought that we were "cool."&nbsp;   So, it makes me think that more is going on in his head than is going on in mine.&nbsp; Obviously this really bothers him, or at least he thinks about it more than I do.&nbsp; But please, does he honestly think that I am going to hold what happened against him??&nbsp; And does he think that if he goes out on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night, in Canandaigua, that he isn't going to see me?  What the fuck???&nbsp;

      and I don't feel fine!&nbsp; Tomorrow I start teaching summer school, and at this point, it is the absolute LAST thing I want to do!&nbsp; What I really want is more time in the sun...more time out drinking...less time spent worrying about $$...less time worrying about who the fuck I am going to take to Nikki's wedding...and more time with hottie p.e. teacher!  Okay, so I don't want  too  much...do I??&nbsp;   &nbsp; Seriously though, this whole wedding thing is eating me ALIVE!&nbsp; I do NOT want to go alone...but I feel like I have no one to ask.&nbsp; I would love to ask Heath, I know that we would have a good time, but I am sure that he would act like a drunken whore, and I do not want to deal with that...I think maybe I should just ask him, then lay down the ground rules...hhhmmm...definitely NOT getting a hotel room with him, that has trouble written (in flashing neon) all over it...I guess maybe I should just bite the bullet and ask...  Tomorrow is beer pong night - yay for that...  And Friday is 4th Friday - double yay for that!!!

      Yay for Chem Dry of Rochester...my rug may not be perfect, but it is SO much better than it was a week ago!!!!&nbsp; A half-dollar sized, light pink spot - I can handle it! &nbsp; Bad news on the baby front...well, only 1/2 bad...and 1/2 good...so there are things to smile about!! &nbsp; Cathy V emailed me - told me she has&nbsp;a "happy picture" from the last day of school, when Kristi and I ran into a bunch of people out at the Lumberyard!&nbsp; Yay for "happy" pictures (especially ones with cute p.e. teachers in them ;)&nbsp;&nbsp; )&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Well, now I am off to a "charm party" with a bunch of people from school.&nbsp; I really don't want to "talk shop," but hey, such is life... &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm sure I'll be back with more gossip later... &nbsp; &nbsp; oh, I have a new fave web site -  urlLink www.jibjab.com &nbsp; VERY funny!!!&nbsp; And check out the pics from Melissa's -  urlLink www.lhovey.fotopages.com &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I went to New Paltz for the night.&nbsp; At first, I kind of didn't want to go...it is a long drive - over 3 hours...then I realized that I rarely see my sister, and since I had the time,&nbsp;I was going.&nbsp; I am so glad that I did!&nbsp; We had so much fun.&nbsp; I sat at the bar, in Barnaby's, from 10:30 - 12am...I had a drink and we made fun of her manager, who was a total moron.&nbsp; Then we headed back to her apartment...as we laid on her bed, we discussed why NOT to wear a thong to bed - agreeing that it is one of the most uncomfortable sensations, wearing a thong to bed puts your "twat in a knot."&nbsp; Yep, that's what I said! &nbsp; Up by 11am, we headed to The Bistro for breakfast.&nbsp; Ran into Mike there - go figure, Auburn people are everywhere!!&nbsp; We went to the bookstore and both bought copies of the funniest book in the world - it's called  How to Eat Like A Child and Other Ways Not to Act Like a GrownUp.&nbsp;  We read it all day and laughed our asses off. &nbsp; Melissa's new apartment is awesome!&nbsp;&nbsp; I love love love it!&nbsp;  &nbsp; We went for sushi for dinner - it was expensive and gross...NEVER again! &nbsp; So, I left New Paltz at about 7:30pm...I hate that Melissa lives so far away!&nbsp; I miss her so much and wish that we could spend more time together.&nbsp; As much as she drives me insane, I love her to death and my sister really is my best friend!

      another Friday in July means another night at the Lumberyard... &nbsp; so...Steve was there...hhmm...yeah, that was strange.&nbsp; I walked up behind him and didn't realize it was him at first.&nbsp; As soon as I did, I gave him a little punch in the arm, asked him how he was, told him I missed him, etc...and he was so strange.&nbsp; I was out on the deck, with Kristi, and all he could do was ignore me...I walked by him, said "hey," got ignored...I can't stand it...I feel very angry about the situation, because it's not like I didn't tell him how I felt, and he promised we wouldn't be "strange,"&nbsp; but we are.&nbsp; And that really bothers me.&nbsp; I thought he was such an awesome guy, and I have been totally let down.&nbsp;  &nbsp; It makes me mad that he would treat me like that.&nbsp; It was like he wasn't even at all glad to see me.&nbsp; And that hurts.&nbsp; I thought that he was better than that.&nbsp; I thought that our little adult evening was something that we were going to be able to deal with. &nbsp; And it bothers me that he comes into MY bar, MY city, and acts like I am the one who is out of place.&nbsp; DAMN IT!&nbsp; Don't treat me like some two-bit whore... &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ps - sexual chocolate is the new code name for a hot black guy - yummy

      it's 8:30 and I am only 1/2 down 488...that was the phone call I got from Kristi this morning...oops...I guess that Beer Pong on Thursday night's isn't the greatest of ideas...I was hurting this morning, and so was she! &nbsp; Met with my AD this morning and he is buying me new JV uniforms...he NEVER buys JV uniforms and I am so lucky that he is!!!&nbsp; Yay for me!! &nbsp; I am pissed at Heath.&nbsp; When Kristi and I were out last night, we were talking to him and trying to get him to come out after the bar closed...he said he would, we called him to pick him up, then he turned off his cell phone!&nbsp; Ass. &nbsp; I met Ryan today. I am going to be his mentor.&nbsp; Yes, I am going to be a mentor.&nbsp; How strange is that?&nbsp; Me...the one with the "teacher knowledge!"&nbsp; I am just so weirded out by it.&nbsp; I don't feel like I have been teaching long enough to know what to tell a new teacher.&nbsp; But I am so excited that they asked me to do it!! &nbsp; Diane and Sue (secretaries at school)&nbsp; had new hotties for me.&nbsp; Apparently Sue told her family friend about me...told him where&nbsp;I hang out and everything.&nbsp; Fun! &nbsp; Then they said something about maybe I should date Pete...and I blushed really really bad!&nbsp;Oh well, maybe that's a good thing!!&nbsp;  &nbsp; Okay, so I am headed out for another rockin' night in Canandaigua...

      I feel as though I do too much.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE to be busy, but I am so sick of trying to keep everyone else happy.    Camp is going very well, but it seems like veryone wants something different.  Barb, one of the Vince Lombardi coaches, says to me today that she wanted to know what I was going to do with the music.  What am I going to do with the music?  Take it home and out it in my collection of cheer stuff - oh no, she wanted a copy and wants to use the dance with her little cheerleaders.  Then, she has the nerve to ask me to change a part of the cheer, so she can have something else in it.  NOPE, sorry lady, but this is my cheer, our dance, if you don't like it, tough.  Too freakin bad.    Nikki wants me to go shopping with her tomorrow, and wants me to go to her Bachelorette Party on Saturday.  I can't.  I can't afford to go to Cananda and pay for a limo.  I can't go shopping.  Yet, I feel bad telling her no!    I got an email from another Middle school teacher today, she wants me to help with the Sulphur Springs festival.  She wants me to "be the guidance" for a group of middle school kids, because the Middle School Counselor can't.  I feel like I can't say no, the counselor is a friend of mine.  And the other teacher is one I work quite closely with.  Let's not forget that the Union asked me to help with their float AND I have to work the second day of the festival.   Kristi and I are going to play beer pong tomorrow night at the Lumberyard.  I think it will be fun.  I am really hoping that Pete will be there.  I really hope he is there.  I might just call him and see if he wants to meet us there.  I think he is just so awesome.  I am most definitely going to see if he wants to try and get Cortaca tickets with me and head to the Cortland - Ithaca game in the Fall.  We could hang, meet up with friends, just have a really good time...   I still have to get a date to Nikki's wedding.  I might ask Heath.  But when I saw him at the Golf Tournament on Monday, I was embarrassed to know him.  He was SO out of control that I wanted to puke!  Ugh!!!   Well, tomorrow is the last day of camp...and I am looking forward to getting some rest.  I am heading to New Paltz on Sunday...

      "Him who?"  That was what I asked Jill not 30 seconds into our conversation.    "That new PE teacher, what's his name?"  she asked.  "Pete." "What?" "Pete." "What's his name?" "Pete." "His last name?" "Oh,____________"   Yeah, so I think that is cool.  She agrees with me - ha ha ha.  I told her that I have been crushing on him since he started coaching (the same Winter that I started coaching basketball cheerleading...)  Anyway, I think she is right. And the next time I see him I am going to suggest that we hang out sometime, grab dinner at Parkers or something...who knows, it's worth a shot, right??    Went shopping with Sue today.  We just did the Tops/WalMart/Wegmans thing...she talked a lot about Taylor.  Then she goes, well, you know Steve has a girlfriend, and she's 21!  WHOA!  Back up there - 21??????  I had NO IDEA she is only 21.  No wonder he won't let T go to the Y - the Y girls hung out at his house and now "Tiff" is there.  At 21, I would be intimidated by all of those Y girls, too!!!  YIKES!  Whatever though, I am over him.  Sue said that there are several people who are mad at him over this girl.  And I told her that I was aware of afew myself, but that I wasn't going to get into it.  It was none of my business who he decides to take home with him.  And no wonder it is so easy for him to lie to her - she is like 10 years younger than him.  And not for nothing, she has so much less real world knowledge.  And why, at 21, is she not in college?????  HELLO!!!  Oh well.  Not my deal...

      Back out in Canandaigua last night...And Pete was there...he for sure got the job as the new PE teacher in out building - yay!!!  We had shots to celebrate...tried to get him to stay longer, but he had to jet (back to Newark) with his friends...He told me he'd see me soon - so I am hoping that is a good thing...and he was harrassing me about being a Mentor for the new 5th grade teacher...Ha ha...Maybe I am like a little kid, grasping at straws, but I totally think he is so cute...and I would totally love to date him...who knows...now I have all year to play this one up :)

      Oh yeah, I forgot about this conversation I had with Heath last week...after jumping into bed with him that one morning...  so I was leaving the Lumberyard to head home, he was coming in from outside...I gave him a hug and kiss as I left...  Heath:  I'll see you soon Me:  yeah, maybe I'll come jump in bed with you sometime soon. Heath:  sounds good, maybe you could come alone and stay longer...

      I love the Dave Matthews Band...there, I had to say it...it just wouldn't be summer without Dave in some way...I just bought a new Dave CD (Live at The Gorge) and other than that, there will be no other Dave this summer...  I just spent a week away from "home."  Home being Canandiagua...  Last Wednesday I went to work the Ropes Course at Wells.  I love working the ropes course.  My group TOTALLY sucked, but Becky and Sarah were there, as was Jeanine...and she brought M&M's to make me happy...Wednesday was also my Mom's 48th Birthday.  I thought it was her 47th, but I was mistaken...oh well...  Melissa was in Auburn last Thursday, so we took down her show, came to Canandaigua to get Bunny, went to dinner, then headed back to Auburn.  We went out.  It was pathetic.  We went to Beth and Sara's for a little pre-gaming...they were all about drinking games (drunk driver).  I am so over that...why can't we go out in Auburn and be adults?  We ended up at Belvederes.  Again...so high school...what happened to the Parkers and Curley's nights??  I guess it bothers me because it is the same thing we did in high school and college...I talked to Mom about it...I really want Beth and Sara to come out here and hang, but they don't seem to want to..and I was annoyed because they don't want to try anything that is different, and Mom said that maybe if I had fun in their "element" they would be more willing to try my "element."  Who knows...  Anyway, on Friday I headed up to the Lake to see Grandma and Grandpa...Dad and Mike left a bit earlier than Mom and I, but we all got their relatively early Friday night...I am glad I went.  It is always nice to stay up there.  Gram and Gramp took us to "That Borden Thing" for dinner on Saturday.  It was good, but not my kind of meal - too fru fru for me...ha ha...yummy though!  I stayed until today...just hanging out, shopping and chatting with Gram and Gramp...it was relaxing and enjoyable...I love my grandparents....  I still haven't asked Heath to go to Nikki's wedding with me.  I am so afraid of rejection.  I know that he will go with me if he can, but I feel like such a loser, not having someone to go with...I'll ask him tomorrow...  off for now...leave me some love if you read this...

      This weekend was one of my all time favorite events of the year - Great Race!  I love Great Race Weekend.  It is probably the  one  weekend of the year that I  love  being in Auburn.  I don't care about the stupid people, the same old shit doesn't go down, and everyone loves everyone.  I LOVE GREAT RACE WEEKEND!  Of course we (Beth, Sara, Heather and I) volunteered.  This year Sarah Smith and her bf joined in on the action.  I did miss my sister being there, though (Melissa, next year you are SO back!)   It was a perfect day for the Race.  About 80 and sunny, no humidity and barely a cloud in the sky.  We had a few beers and just chilled.  I know that I am getting old, though.  We didn't do the old "walk around and talk to everyone" thing, this year we got a spot and planted ourselves.  Now, this might not sound like much,  but , when you are old enough to get your own spot at the lake, you are old.  It's the kids who walk around.  It's funny, because this year, I was looking for my brother in the spots where we used to hang.  And there he was, with all of his friends...funny how things change!

      Did you know that brown M&M's are gone from the plain package??  Well, they are.  Patrick came to school today and helped me unpack my room and move some heavy furniture.  That was fabulous!   I went to Sue's today to chat.  I saw Heath.  I decided today that he is the one person in this world who can leave me speechless.  That dude just cracks me up.  He called Sue to pick him up at the Lumberyard at 1am today.  I told him that from now on he needs to call me.  I am a block from there and he can sleep here.  I will just bring him to CLifton in the morning.  He went on to ask his mother if she wanted another grandchild because according to him, if he stays here that's what'll happen.  Uhm...NO!  He smartened up and asked if I have a couch!

      I just go off the phone with my Mom.  She called to tell me that my Grandpa is in the hospital.  He was under the house doing work (on one of those rolly cart things) and when he rolled out, he couldn't get up.  The doctors don't know what is wrong with him.  He said that babies don't move a lot because they don't know how to use thier muscles, but he knows how to use them, he just can't.   I like to believe that my grandparents will live forever.  Neive?  Yeah, I know it is.  But losing my other grandfather was horrible, and I don't want to feel like that again.   So, keep my Gandma and Grandpa in your prayers.  They can't live without each other.

      Yay!  Sara came out last night (Friday)  and stayed until, well technically, Sunday!!!!  She got here late Friday afternoon, and after chillin' just a bit I dragged her up to KC Tea & Noodles on Park Ave.  (Thanks to Kymlyn, I now have a healthy addiction to noodles, and serious cravings for them, too!)  I think I may have freaked Sara out a bit - as she sucked down her Bubble Tea, I thought she may choke - no worries though, she came through like champ!  We headed down to Parkleigh, where I purchased a fabulous mullet air freshner, I think I will hang it in my brothers' car - let's see how long 'til they notice!!!  Sara and I then headed to Abbot's for ice cream...mmmmm....then it was back to Canandaigua where we went to the Lumberyard and Sam's.  Oh, I think Heath may die a slow death - at the hands of Kristi!  She asked him why he told his mom what he did, and she even asked him where he got the idea that things may go further than just a bit of drinking...well, his response??  "(and I quote)  "What if the three of us ended up naked together?"   WHAT????   Yeah, so he went on to tell her that he would like it to happen and that he knew that she would be the easiest one to  get  naked!  Yikes!!!  I actually think the whole thing is funny - she doesn't.  Even though none of the bars in Canandigua seem to carry Malibu, Sara still enjoyed herself - and for that I was happy!!   Drunk and happy, we headed home...  I promised Sara I wouldn't be up until close to noon - she balked the idea, but it was the phone that woke us both up at 11am!!!!  Showered and dressed, we headed for Target (what would a trip to Canandaigua be for an Auburnian, without a jaunt to Target???)   Jeff and his family were headed into Canandaigua for the evening, so we hooked up with them.  Off to Polomini's for dinner (yum), with a little pre-gaming at Jose and Willy's.  Some dude had a freakin' bird on his shoulder (in the bar), so that was a bit freaky.  But who cares??????  Hung with the fam until  about midnight!!!  So, here I am at 12:27 am...and I just spent an awesome weekend with one of my best friends!  We had a great time, and I am so thrilled that Sara came out!  It sometimes seems like we lose touch, like Canandaigua and Auburn are hours apart!  It's so awesome to know that we can pick right up and go on with our friendship!!!  Thanks Sar!  I feel kind of bad, because I sort of blew off Kristi and Benny tonight.  But it is so rare that  I  have friends in town that I really wanted to hang with them.  Kristi called me, to tell me that Emily was headed up to Ben's party.  I hope that things worked out okay with all of that!   Oh yeah, I realized that our night out was so strange because it's a freakin' full moon!!  Yikes!!
