      Well, yet another rainy day down here...nothing to do but be bored ALL FRIKEN DAY...but that's alright.  Gave away about 6 gmail invites the other day. Sorry, I'm all out.  I'd like to ask you something. If you're reading this, could you comment on it telling me WHY you're here? Why are you reading my useless posts? It's a waste of time, is it not? Ah, I don't know, Maybe you're like me and you're bored outta yo' mind. I'm not entirely sure. Well I'm off to Best Buy, seems they've got a hdd there with my name on it. SEE YA.

      Well, My girlfriend came over today. We watched Mooseport something or other, I didn't really catch the title. I really didn't actually WATCH any of the movie..  Well, I'm trying to fix her computer, but it's beginning to look _-*BAD*-_ and I don't know if I can handle it. Reformatting sounds good....but drivers are nowhere to be found...kind of scares me. But anyhow...we went inside to watch the movie, and I ended up giving her a back and foot massage, which was fine. I thoroughly enjoy the time we spend together. It makes me happy that she cares about me.   Well it's late, I'd better be heading off to the dreamworld. Closed eyelids are an open portal.

      I used to think blogs were retarded....more for people with nothing to do with their lives then chatting in IRC all day....then I realized that this was something greater.  This blog will be about whatever I want it to be about, since (of course) this is my blog.  Please read this disclaimer, if you will.  ---- My blog will be moderately heavy on the cursing, talking bad about others, and bashing corperations like Apple. Please do not get offended by what I say, because even if you did, I wouldn't do a thing about it. I don't care. I will talk about what I want to, so if I want to talk about my girlfriend, I will. If I want to talk about the weather, I will. If I want to talk about my Dr. Pepper can, I will. Getcha? Good. ---- End Disclaimer.   First thing's first, I want you people to talk to me. Post comments about what I say, I want your input.  See any typing errors? GO AHEAD! Post em. I won't do anything about it, but that's ok...I still want to hear from you.   You guys like TechTV? I do, TTV inspired me to start talking about what I feel, so I will.  Well I've got to be heading out. I'll post when I feel like it, which may be once a month or 5 times a day. Whatever I feel like. Well hope you will comment on my opinions, I'd love to hear from you.
