      I don't really plan on giving out this URL to any of my friends because I don't think I'd want them to know everything.  I guess I'm just making this for my own good. Well, here's the story of my past couple weeks, the reason I need to write things down:  May 28,29? I go to Alanna's birthday party via Eric (my at-the-time boyfriend for going on 2 years).  He said he wanted to drive me, and on the way home I found out why.  He said he didn't think we were being very nice to each other recently, I thought he was breaking up with me then and was basically crying.  I didn't really think too much about what he had said then, being so relieved we weren't breaking up because I am so madly in love with him, but now thinking about it I feel so bad about the way I treated him.  I was such a bitch...It was more like I was completely annoying and stuff...I guess it started out with just friendly pinching and wet willies, you know, cute stuff, but I stopped thinking about being annoying and such.  And then I would always make him listen to my music(country) in the car, even when he would say please just this once can we listen to mine? (alternative rock and oldies).  And then if he switched it I would get all huffy puffy and angry so he'd feel bad and change it to mine and I'd change it back to his and we'd both get angry at each other.  Just stupid stuff like that I guess...  May 31: A group of friends went to see The Day After Tomorrow.  I probably should have realized something was up because we weren't being too cuddly and what not, but after awhile we had stopped all that in movies, figuring we didn't pay $8 just to sit there and make out...Whatever.  So afterwards he walked me to my car and said that he thought we should take a break or break up or something and he started crying and I just kept hugging him because I guess I thought it was just a stage and we could get through this.  At this point I was almost laughing, not crying, because I didn't think this was really happening.  So anyways we stood there for like an hour hugging and crying (I started to after about 10 minutes) and then looking at each other awkwardly because were we supposed to be hugging if we break up? We totally didn't know what to do.  After awhile, he said he should probably leave, and asked if I thought I would get home ok and I said I would, even though I totally shouldn't have taken the freeway when I was crying.  I went home and my parents saw me upset and called Eric a jerk to make me feel better, even though they really didn't think he was one, and it just made me feel worse.  I cried in bed for a couple hours and finally fell asleep...  June 1st:  I called Eric at about 10 that morning because I was really confused...I couldn't remember if we were taking a break or completely through.  SO I called and the second he said hello we both started crying and I asked him if he would come over and take a walk so we could figure out what was going on...and then I was like "we probably shouldn't though, I guess..." and he said maybe it would be a good idea.  So he came over and we went for a walk and he told me he  thought he had made the biggest mistake ever and just because he was upset about how things had been for a little bit doesn't mean that we couldn't try to make them better and such.  He said he wanted to break up then because he knew that I was making him a present for our two years and didn't want me to work on it a lot (it was a scrapbook).  That was kind of depressing, but my God I was so excited inside, but I didn't think I should show him how happy I was..I don't know why...so we walked around, arm in arm, and I said "Maybe we should just see how things are for a little bit and we'll decide what to do after you go to El Salvador (he was going to be gone June 6th through the 19th)" and he said ok. Then he came inside and we watched a little tv (gameshows) and he went home.  For the next week, we didn't really act like we were taking a break...It was just like before (which I guess is bad because that's why we had broken up in the first place...) and I saw him off at the airport when he went to El Salvador and I was so happy that we were going to be ok!  He sent me flowers for our two years on June 15th, and I spent every second I wasn't out of the house working on that damn scrapbook.  Then everything went downhill. June 19th: Eric gets back, and I try to call him from my swimmeet and we talk for like a minute.  He says he doesn't feel well at all (understandable...he  was  in Mexico...) so we wouldn't be able to hang out that day.   June 20th: He claims to be busy all day with Father's Day fiascos so we can't do anything then.  I should have seen what was coming next, because you'd think he'd be able spend 10 minutes talking to me after being gone for 2 weeks...  June 21st: Eric asks if he can come over at 1 and we can go for a walk of something.  I was a little freaked out because I mean...Go for a walk? and I said I had to be somewhere at 1:30 but he said it would just be a short walk...I told him he was scaring me and he said that it wasn't that and not to worry (liar).  So he came over and I greeted him with the finished scrapbook and a hug and he looked really upset so I started crying because it was  that  and I should have been worried.  He said that he thought about it in El Salvador and he thought that it would be best to break up.  Then we sat there for 2 or so hours (I ditched my 1:30 meeting) crying (well just me for the most part) and him saying he still wanted to be friends as I tried to hold back saying that I still wanted to be more then friends and such.  So then I had to pee, but totally couldn't with him right in the other room, so in an attempt to get him out of the room I told him to go look through the scrapbook because he didn't even look at it before and he left and I peed and I came out and he was crying really hard and I realized that was the most horrible thing ever to do.  I still feel bad... Anyways, he was going to leave, and I asked him if I could have one last kiss and we did and I seriously think that was our nicest, sweetest kiss ever.  Then he tried to leave the scrapbook with me, but no way was I going to let him get away with that.  I mean, I made it for him! He's is  going  to have it! And then he was gone.  More later...I can't stand too much of this at one time  Things I love: Eric :-(
