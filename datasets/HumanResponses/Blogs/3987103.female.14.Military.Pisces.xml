       well, as you can tell by the title i saw The Village today. it was an interesting movie. there are many hints and tips giving the end away. but for those of you that are thick headed and mindless, you will only think this is a scary movie and will be shockingly suprised by the ending. and that's pretty much what i did today.      -if      oh and i had chinese. yum. but the people working at the resteraunt thought that i was chinese. not funny. i'm korean! and mexican. oh and my cousin's mexican but looks a little chinky and the first time he went to that resteraunt he got a discount because they thought he was. now he's really good friends with the owner. but no more discounts. poo.

       well. it has been two days. i'm at my cousin's house again. but this time for dinner i'm having my favorite! Air! hmmmmmm air! if i was given the choice of eating or not i wouldn't. food is just weird.    well yesterday i went to the mall with my friend. like the only one i have. and i'm thinking of letting her go. her services are no longer needed. i wish to be a complete loner again. i get really tired of people. they make me go into deep depresions.   and today? costco. yes the whole sale place. and now i'm at my cousins. what more can i tell you? i've only just begun my new comic. i will not tell you what it's about. only a select few...... if you wish to unveil the secret evil burried in this&nbsp;comic, e-mail me. (i know no one will. that is why i say this) and that was my day. not very fun but it was something to do.    &nbsp;  -if

       well didn't go to the drive-in. but stayed up until 1am. on the internet. yay! at this rate i'll need coke bottle glasses by the age of 18! i must destroy my retenas! oh and i met someone in a chatroom who has canable tendencies, really into the texas chainsaw masacre, likes to torture grasshoppers, overly interested in death and black things giving outsiders the impression that he's goth, and likes cats and animals (thus also&nbsp;giving outsiders the impression that he's gay). but thank the lord he's not a sick pervert out to get cyber pussy only because he can't get any in real life. i hate those kinds. there's just too many like that out there.   oh well. and today was church. yay! praise the lord! halla-jelua! (yes. halla-jelua. you read it correctly.&nbsp;don't judge me.) i'm a roman catholic just to let you know. and i atten mass almost twice every week. and yes i do go to a catholic high school. and every last thursday of the month that i can i try to volenteer at the food kitchen with my parish. (sound really goody-two-shoes don't i?)    and also today my "homeless" (he's living above&nbsp;the strip bar he works at. and no he is not a stripper. ew. he does mannual work)&nbsp;uncle came to stay the night and help with the yard work. fun. but he and my dad always&nbsp;tell stories from when they were&nbsp;kids living in the projects and how good&nbsp;my life is and only having&nbsp;two siblings. (they grew-up with eight other brothers and sisters). over-all. today was great.    -if &nbsp;

      well. i didn't write yesterday because i didn't. anyway i was still at my cousin's and pretty much did nothing. i burned a CD that turned out to be crap. and every time i was on the computer i was looking for more things to post on the site. but obviously i never did. and that's my day! oh yes and for din-din: milk and cookies (yum....... oreos) and to day, cleaning the house for guests, then after all that crap is done maybe out to the drive-in to see spiderman 2 and catwoman. i love comic books. and well sence there's nothing left for me to talk about i will part with you with these little words of wisdom: DO NOT WORSHIP THE CHOCOLATE BUNNIES!  -if

       well..............today was uneventful. just like the rest of my life. but you should already know that from the first entry i made. unless you'r a lazy-ass jerk-off that doesn't take the time to read a whole entry. you know like the one i was talking about. yeah. you know. anyway, right now i'm at my cousin's house, having dinner(yum! cereal!), and watching one of my favorite movies: The Fifth Element. yay! for some odd strange reason i feel bubbly. it sucks like hell. so i will write later.    &nbsp;  -if

       hmmmmmmmm...........    today i have really&nbsp;nothing&nbsp;to say. i've been on the internet all day looking for websites and posting them on my page. i've done alot of work. i'm proud of myself&nbsp;i'm quite happy now. but, alas, the knowledge of the&nbsp;impending sufferage and depression soon to follow the short lived happiness really puts a damper on the moment.    anyways, how was today's weather? why am i asking? because i was shut in the house all day in my basement on the internet. what are you stupid?! come on! ok. hold on. i'm sorry. i'm just a little impulsive. and moody. you'll find out(if not already).    so................... yeah.................. i guess................... you should stop reading............... now ....................... i have&nbsp;nothing left to say........................ why are you still reading? i thought i told you to stop reading?! what the hell is wrong with you?! you must be a freakin idiot! you can't even do a simple task as stop reading! i would think you would since you'r IQ is probably lower than 75. especially since you'r reading my online journal. yeah you better stop reading! yeah you better close this page! yeah! yeah! yeah you better be gone now! .............................. &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   oh poo. i'm lonely now.     -if &nbsp;
