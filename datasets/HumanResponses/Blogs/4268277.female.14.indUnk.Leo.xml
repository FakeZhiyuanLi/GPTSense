      ..... But Colleen wasn't so sure. She was almost positive that those were angels playing out there, and if she looked really hard, threw the trees she could see some splashing in the river. That's weird she thought, it's not warm enough to go swimming. Colleen looked back down at her ring. When she took it off her finger it stopped glowing, but when she put it back of it started glowing again. after a few minutes the ring started to glow more and more, getting brighter as the minutes passed. Loud screams came from the other cars on the train and following them a horrific crashing sound, almost like a bomb. Things went flying and a fire roared down the center isle, spreading as it went. The lady by Colleen was screaming but Colleen was calm and quiet. The ring seemed to keep her safe. The fire was racing towards her and she found that her foot was stuck under a metal bar that had fallen from above. She screamed for help but no one could hear her. The fire was coming nearer and nearer. Colleen could feel the unbearable heat as the air around her filled with smoke.

               Colleen slowly opened the box and inside she found a pretty gold ring.  When she looked at it, it seemed to sparkle, even though it was quite dark on the train.  Under the ring Colleen found a note from her mom.                   Dear Colleen,                I wish you the best of luck during your oncoming Senior year.  You are going to the same school I went to.                            Be carful, and wear the ring always.  Call anytime you need my help or advice.                                                 Love,                                                    Mom   Doing just as her mom said, Colleen sliped the ring onto her finger.  As soom as she had it on she felt a calmness come over her.  Gazing out the window Colleen was atartled when she saw what looked like angels playing by the tracks.  She leaned over to the lady sitting next to her and asked if she saw the angels too.  "Are you crazy?" the woman asked.  Everyone knows you can't see angels.

        I am writing a story, and am going to post it on here in sections.         Colleen ran ahead of her parents as they made their way to the train station. Summer was ending and the crisp clean fall air was a refreshing change from the hot, humid summer. Colleen was more excited than she had ever been before. For her senior year of highschool she was going to Greenlake high, a private school in Greenville. This would also be her first time on a train. Colleen slowed down so her parents could catch up. As they got to the station her mom and dad smothered her in hugs and kisses. Just before she steped on the train her mom gave her a small red box. Colleen took it just as the train started moving, and turned to get inside and find a seat.    How do you like it so far?  more coming soon.
