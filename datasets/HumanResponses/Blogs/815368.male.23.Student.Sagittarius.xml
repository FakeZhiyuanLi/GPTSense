      I just finish practicing the 2nd movement of the Bach double.  I woke up around 9:00 p.m. and I’ve been practicing since.  My schedule is so messed up right now.  I feel re-energized though after my short nap.  Hopefully I won’t stay up to long like I did last night... I just got of the phone with Gloria.  She just got out of work and she wants me to accompany her to Whataburger.  Until next time.

      Waking up at 7:00 a.m. during Spring Break to get ready for work: SUCKS! On the other hand, playing Mario Kart Double Dash and Mario Party 5 with your girlfriend till 1:00 in the morning: PRICELESS. Heehee. I feel so exhausted right now. Mainly because of work but also because I only slept for a few hours last night. My girlfriend Gloria and I rented Mario Party 5 and we couldn’t put it down. She’s very competitive it’s hard to put my guard down.  Anyhow, Its almost 4:00 p.m. and I plan to break a new record by sleeping early.  Good think I don’t have to worry about waking up early for work tomorrow morning.  I plan to practice the second movement of the Bach double tomorrow. My recital is only a few weeks away.

      Hello World!  As you can see, I've been neglecting my site for quite sometime now.  It's hard to believe this website still exists.  I originally created it to help build my writing skills. Perhaps I’ll give it another try but I can’t guarantee you anything because of my hectic schedule.  Only time will tell.

      Practicing my violin at home can be difficult at times, especially with my sister’s pet puppy howling at me.  I can’t tell whether she’s singing along or singing the blues.   I really need to get some practice time if I want to be ready for my recital, which is in 3 weeks.  If this continues I might have to drive to Pan Am to use one of the practice rooms they offer.  Opps almost forgot, I have to get ready for work.  I go in at 2:40 p.m.

      I’m just about ready to get some rest.  Today, I mean last night, Gloria and I went to Wal-Mart to buy some windshield wipers and plastic rims for my car.  Afterwards we stopped at a local car wash to wash my car.  My car was in need of a wash BIG TIME.  Now all I need to do is fix the transmission and air conditioning and it will be good as new.  I also forgot to mention a new paint job. lol Anyway, TGIF.  Today happens to be payday.  Too bad I have to work  but at least I'll have time to practice my violin.

      What a day it's been so far.  I woke up pretty early to deliver some flyers on the string camp we’re having over at UTPA this summer.  Afterwards I traveled to UTPA to practice my VSO (Valley Symphony Orchestra) auditions.  One of my goals for this summer is to be apart of the VSO.  With the right practice and preperation, I'm sure I'll do fine in the audition.  Also, just incase I don't make it this semester, there is always next semester.  I belieive that the important this is to give it a try and gain some experence from it.

      Once again, I have neglected my web site.  I was surprise to see bloggger.com new revamp.  I like thier new templates and it’s user-friendly interface.  Let me just say, it was about time.  Anyway, enough kissing ass… So much has happened since I've last blogged.  I accomplished my goals this past semester at UTPA and I started setting new goals for this summer.  I'm also excited summer has finally come.  Now I have time to practice my violin, work out, and save money for a new car and a small trip to Houston with my girlfriend Gloria.

      It was great to hang out with my best friend Victor last night.  We went to visit some of our mariachi friends for some laughs.  To bad it was only for a little while, I miss hanging out with everyone. Perhaps we could do it again before Victor leaves to France.

      Lately I’ve been feeling somewhat lazy.  I’m supposed to be practicing at least 6 hours on my violin and prepare for my VSO audition.  I’m beginning to have doubts of the audition.  If I don’t start to practice , I’ll never be ready.  Hopefully Dr. Dawson will be able to give me an extra lesson tomorrow.

      I woke up this morning to wish my best friend Victor a save trip to France.  Afterwards I got a chance to spend some time with Gloria.  I called her up and ask her if she could pick me up.  We then went to the dollar movies to go see Butter Fly Effect.  I would have droved to her house but my car is at the doctor’s office getting surgery.  Hopefully she'll be ready sometime this week.  Doc said she would make a full recovery.

      Today I was supposed to show up for work bt instead I droved to Pan Am to practice for my audition.  I have 6 more days for my audition and I am going to do my best to become a VSO member.  All I want is a chance to earn my spurs next semester.  I'll let you know if I make it next week.

      I just finish my midnight practicing.  I have a few days till the audition I plan to take advantage of every opportunity I have to practice.  Finding the time and place to practice can be very difficult at times for me.  I hope I didn’t wake up the neighbors.  I better hit the sack for tomorrow is somewhat of a big day for me.  I have a gig, work, and spend my free time practicing.

      Last night Gloria and I went to go the The Day After Tomorrow.  I thought the movie was fun and exciting.  They really did a nice job on the special effects.  It was also pretty funny.  There was a scene where Mexico closes the border because to many illegal immigrants (U.S.) are crossing.  Anyway, tomorrow is my big audition and I plan to take advantage of the time to practice.  I probably wont post any blog's till Wednesday.  Wish me luck!

      Today I received a phone call from the symphony office informing me that they wont tell me if I made the Valley Symphony Orchestra until the 2nd audition is over.  The weird thing about all this is… today they send me a package that contained music for their upcoming concert.  Does that mean I made it?  I really hope I get an opportunity to be apart of VSO.  I would learn so much.
