      Annnnnnnnddddd the answer to the impossible personality question posted previously is B! I know I know C was very convincing. A was my exact opposite. Thanks for playing. See James at the door for your parting gift.     On a serious note, to the user named Muslim. Choice A was a huge exaggeration. I hope I did not offend you in any way with my post. It was not meant to be serious.

      I swear I'm an insomniac. I can never sleep. Here it's 2:33, and what am I doing? I find myself watching the infomercial for a  urlLink Ronco chicken roticere , while eating a bowl of generic apple jacks. What a way to spend the last night of summer. Why couldn't I come home from the party and go to sleep with fun memories of it fresh in my head as I doze off? NO! I'm stuck with fucking Ron Popeil!!! What a bastard. At least I have Douglas on my lap. (She's my cat)  Mybe I'l strum the guitar. Ho hum....     Songs:   "Cannonball" ---The Breeders   "Let Go" ---Frou Frou

      Blah Blah Blah. I could sit here and tell you who I am and what I'm about, but I know that's boring as hell. I mean come on, what do you care. So to spice this up a little bit I have made a little game out of this. So let's play   Guess Josh's Personality Sketch!              Personality A:  Hi, I am Josh. I am a senior in high school where I play linebacker on the school football team. I love football becuase I can score with a new cheerleader each night, especially if they're drunk. Speaking of being drunk, I love drink. Bud is my beer of choice. My hobbies are beating up pussies and gay people. I have no god except for Jack Daniels. I love to party. Every night I finish off with a 6-pack and a blunt. I have a .5 GPA. I skip most of the day at school so I can drive around in my Chevy and spit tobacco juice out the window. In the future I plan to play football professionally. Thank god, I mean Jack that I'm good at it or else I might actually have to apply my self in school. I love GW Bush and love watching watching our men fuck up other countries. I am a proud confed...I mean American. My favorite band is AC/DC!! Well there are places to see and girls to do. Later.        Personality B:  Hi, I am Josh. I am a senior in high school where I am editor of the yearbook. I love writing and photography. I just recently made a darkroom in my basement. I love making and watching music and movies as well. I like to think I am very outgoing and funny. I enjoy reading. My favorite book is Fahrenheight 451 by Ray Bradbury. I have two pet cats named Douglas and Kitty 2. (They are both she's). I also have a pet bird named pirate. I work in a music store. I am a democrat. I am in Key club, Hi-Y, Student Council, and Ski Club at school. I don't really have a "favorite" band. Well thats all for now. Today is my mom's birthday.      Personality C:  My name is Sally, and I love pink coats.      Soooooo! Which one is me? A, B, or C???? You choose. The answer will be posted later. Good Luck!
