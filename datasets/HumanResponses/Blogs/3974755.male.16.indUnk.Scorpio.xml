       I quit my job last night. Me and my boss got into a confrontation and i walked out. This way I will be able to hang out with my friends more before I move. Tonight I am going to Michael's funeraul bless his soul. I dont have much to say right now. I am tired. I am always tired. Thursday we have a show at Ashley's (corns) house which should be fun. Rock and Roll bitches.    &nbsp;   The Paper Chase- "subject two"

       The show on Saturday was just amazing. I am so happy with the way everything turned out. Last night kind of sucked though. I think I had the flu and I was not a very big fan of it but im feeling ok now. I have to be at work in a half an hour we will see what happens. Im starting to pack my room to get ready for the move. It sucks but I will roll with it. I met some pretty cool people from South West so hopefully I will be able to hang out with some of them at school. I work 9 hours today. That just put me in a bad mood. I am all dried up.      Call Me Lightning-  "Ghouls"

       Last night I went to Isaac's house where I got to hang out with Fat Hoods. We also had band last night, it was amazing we wrote some hot stuff. There were a lot of people at Isaac's it was good to see some of them again. Sleep is amazing. Sleep is amazing. Two more nights until the show, I am having anxiety attacks waiting for this damn thing. It will be a great time. I have work 4:30 - 9 and i really dont mind, thats a good feeling. Thats all i have, thats the done of me.    &nbsp;   The White Stripes - "I Just dont know what to do with myself"

       I am so damn tired right now. I had work at 12 and oddly enough thats what time i woke up. My head is killing me and my allergies arent that great either. Fat Hoods is back, cant wait to see him tonight. It should be pretty damn rock n roll. 3 days&nbsp; until the big show, i cant wait for it. I m putting in my 2 weeks notice soon. On the 4th of August I am on my way to Arizona until the 27th. Then when I come back we will already be living in Green Bay. I will be going to Green Bay SouthWest next year. Im guesing it will suck but I have to get my grades up anyways. I wish I would have bought Battles' CD. They were fucking amazing.&nbsp; Some girl at work was trying to tell me that Fuel is the greatest rock band ever. What a joker, i wonder how bad the rest of her life sucks if thats just her opinion on music. I have to get back to work, I have&nbsp; ten dollars to my name and i dont ger paid for another week.

       Today I am making this online blog due to the fact that I have&nbsp; nothing to do at work. I have been working too much lately. Tonight I am going home watching Donnie Darko and then going to bed.&nbsp; I am excited for the show on the 24th the CD turned out awesome. I am very satisfied with the way things are going right now. I dont have to work tomorrow so thats a plus, I am spending the day with Sara Hopkins, one year ago we started going out. I am moving to Green Bay in August. I am also going to Arizona. All is well.    &nbsp;  &nbsp;     The Pixies -  "Gigantic"
