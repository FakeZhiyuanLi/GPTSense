      I can never seem to get things right.  Although, I have to admit, this time it wasn't completely unexpected.  I still can't believe that my life is happening this way.  I'm trying to be optimistic about it all but sometimes it just doesn't work!!!  I'm too old to not give a damn and  I'm too young to give up.

      somewhere along the way, i have forgotten who i was.  its really hard to find your way back once you've lost your way.  and when you look in the mirror and you don't know who that is looking back at you, that's a scary realization.  life happens so fast, it's so unpredictable.  it just doesn't make much sense to just sit and watch everyone pass you by.  but the worst is when you know you have a purpose and you just can't live up to it...  when you know what you should be doing but you just can't because you have this obligation to someone who just doesn't get it.  when all you can do is just pray that something will change...  and then something does change, and it destroys what little you have managed to keep of yourself.  and then something really good happpens, but there is still misunderstanding...  it never goes away!!!!

      OMG!!!  Somedays I just hate being an adult...  I don't want to be a kid again, but I really honestly hate being an adult.  On one hand, I like that I get to make all the decisions for myself, I never was very good at doing what my parents thought I should but somedays, I'm just so tired of having to make all those decisions, of having to be so responsible.  It doesn't make it any easier on me that I still relate to teenagers so well.  It's like they are drawn to me.  They come to me for advice or some of them just want to hang out...  Honestly, they make me feel so old!!!  And I know that I'm not, I haven't even been out of high school ten years yet, but, geez...  And the things they know, I swear, I didn't have the knowledge about life that they have at that age.  I want to pull away from the teens, but since they are my baby brother's friends and he lives with me now, it makes it 10 times harder.  It's a nice distraction form my life though...  I mean, how can you think about divorce when you have teenagers asking for advice...  I'd rather be in my situation than theirs...  High school was so difficult, don't get me wrong, it was fun but the decisions you have to make at that stage in life, WOW!!!  Talk about life forming...  In my opinion, by the time you graduate high school, you have already chosen the type of person you will grow up to be, whether you know it or not.  Anyway, now that I have that off my chest...

      For so long I stood on the outside looking in Often I wondered if you even noticed me I made my decision to collect pieces of you I never realized how difficult this would be  It happened so suddenly we were instantly connected And now I'm left to wonder just what I did that was so wrong Everywhere I turn I seem to find pieces of you Your voice I hear inside my head softly singing our favorite song  I wanted so much to be that friend you so desperately need So often now I struggle to clear you from my mind Lingering deep in my consciousness are pieces of you I am haunted by memories of all I was forced to leave behind  I need so much to see your bright and beautiful smile But every time you are near we cannot be together Blurry snapshots from the past lay among the pieces of you I ask myself how much turmoil will our friendship weather  Forever a place you have Within my battered heart I shall cherish the pieces of you Even if we are always kept apart

      So I was thinking about all the friends I've had throughout my life... And I suddenly realized that all my really good friends have one thing in common.  Now, as for really good friends, I only have a handful, 4 maybe 5 but those are the only relationships that have lasted longer than 3 years.  And the common thread is that 4 of those relationships have endured long periods of non-communication between my friends and me.  My four friends are Jennifer, Chad, Emily and MaryBeth.  I've known Chad and Jen the longest, 14 years now.  Next comes Mary, we met freshman year in high school, 12 years ago.  And, finally Emily.  Em was one of my supervisors at my first post-high school job 7 years ago.  As for those long peiods of non-communication, the longest is about 10 years.  That was Jen.  The first 4 years was because I moved to Oklahoma for high school, the next 4 years was because she moved to Oklahoma to go to college, of course, I had already moved back to California by then, and the last 2 years was because I went through a anti-church phase.  But once I came to my senses, we mended our friendship and in the last 2 years, she has become my very best friend, a place I am sure she will keep for the rest of our lives.  Now for Mary...  This story is the most hysterical by far.  Like I said, we met freshman year in high school.  She is the only friend from Oklahoma that I chose to remain in contact with.  We have multiple periods of non-communication.  The first started less than a year into our friendship and lasted about 18 months.  Neither of us remember why or how but we do remember how it stopped.  That was the second day of our junior year, when we realized that there was no possible way to make it through the school year without being friends especially since we were in 5 out 7 classes together.  On that day, it was as if the past 18 months hadn't even existed.  The second period was three years after I had returned to California.  My grandfather had become ill and subsequently passed away.  Out of grief, I had to stop talking to Mary because she reminded me of the four years I spent so close to Gramps.  I don't remember how that one ended, I think Mary found me online about a year later.  Next would be Chad, we remained in contact through the 4 years I spent in Oklahoma and even through the years of my rebellion.  I chose to not talk to him after he asked me out when I was 19.  That lasted about 2 years.  Needless to say, we never dated, and that is probably why we have remained friends for so many years.  Last but not least, Emily.  She moved away fron southern California and I got busy with trying to live the wild life.  We spent about 2 years apart.  When I finally grew up I reached out to her.  She is my oldest friend, somewhere around 10 years my senior, but that has never made a difference in our friendship, well, not after I finally turned 21 anyway.  Now we have more in common than before, both divorced moms, but she doesn't know that yet.  The point of all this is for someone to see that friendships can remain strong even if the friends don't, or can't, remain in contact.  The promises will be kept.  The bonds of a friendship will not be broken...  Time passes by so much more quickly than you expect it to.  And eventually, you can look back and see this as a great learning experience, a time of growth.  143 4ever!!!  :) SMILE :)

      How many times have you been alone? Alone in a harsh world, feeling inadequately How many times have you suffered? Suffered the loss of love, been loved infrequently  How often have you sat and cried? Cried over the tortures of the past, times gone by How often have you laid in bed and thought? Thought of all the stories you have told, times you had to lie  How many times in life have you wandered? Wandered aimlessly in search of something, anything How many times in life have you come up empty? Empty-handed with no thoughts of survival, nothing  How often have you wanted to cry? How often have you wanted to die?  How often have you wanted to survive? How often have you wanted to be alive?

      So, I'm sitting in church this morning singing the worship songs waiting to leave to teach a rowdy bunch of 2nd and 3rd graders. I have no idea why it hit me so hard, I knew what songs we would be singing last night. I'm standing there singing and I suddenly have this urge to look around. Of the couple hundred people surrounding me, I only know about half. Of those, there are the people I have known over half my life; the adults that have watched me become the woman I am and the children that I have watched grow up. And those that I have become close to in recent years. There are the people who have stood behind me, holding me up during my weakest moments. And those that I have stood behind, giving them a bit of my strength in their time of need.   I'm listening to the words I'm singing...     I walk by faith, each step by faith;  To live by faith, I put my trust in You.   And something hits me, real hard, almost like a smack in the face but inside. So I look around again and the tears start to sting my eyes. The song ends in fellowship time and the one person I want to talk to, I can't, the one person I'm not sure if I can leave. I'm lucky today though, I got a smile. And in that smile, I know that no matter how far I have to go, that nothing will ruin this friendship. Because sad to say it, even though most days we are only at most 2 miles apart, it feels like there is an ocean separating us. The next song starts and it's even worse...     It is the cry of my heart to follow You.  It is the cry of my heart to be close to You.  It is the cry of my heart to follow you all of the days of my life.   And the pain runs through me like a wave. It's a familiar pain, the one that signifies that I already know the answer to my prayer. The one that says open your eyes and do it.  And the last straw...     Trust God for where your life is goin'.  God is in control, God is in control.   I've never been one to easily give up control over my life, even when it is so blatantly clear. I'm still a little unclear over what my answer is, so I'm not done praying over this. I'm scared though, cause I know that either way, I still have a lot of growing up to do. But at the same time, I also know that no matter what, the importance of some things, and some people will never change, no matter what my geographical location is.

      So I talked to my dad and step-mother tonight.  Now, normally I don't let the conversation go in the direction it went tonight.  But for some reason, today, I sat and listened.  When I was talking to my father, it was a belated Father's Day call, we discussed my availability for a visit.  Seeing as I am currently unemployed, I seem to be quite available.  I gave the phone to my son and when I picked up the second extention, we were talking to both of my parents.  My father was tired from a long week's work and the boy lost interest so I was left to talk to my step-mom.  It's funny how after all these years of estrangement, I have been able to build a pretty decent relationship with them.  Maybe it's because I want so badly to have a normal father-daughter relationship.  Or maybe it's because I know that I will have a better opportunity to properly raise my son in a different state.  But the most disturbing possibility is the feeling I have deep inside my heart.  The one that tells me that maybe, just maybe, that is where I need to be.  My step-mom is a pretty good sales-person so I hope I'm not allowing myself to be convinced by all the perks.  But at the same time, I am terrified to sit down and talk to God about this.  I'm scared of the answer that I will get.

      I was going through some of my old writings and I came across this story I was working on.  When I started it, I couldn't get a handle on one of the characters.  I don't know what it was, but I just couldn't relate to her.  I had created this situation that I never thought I would go through.  Well, as it turns out, I'm going through something so close to what I made up.  The thing is, now that I can finish this story, I'm not sure I want to.  I know how it has to end but I'm not sure I will be able to write it.  I've gone from one extreme to the other.  First, I couldn't write it cause I couldn't understand it.  Now, I can't write it cause I understand it too well.  Hmm, maybe if I wait a little while, after things have calmed down, I'll be able to write it.  Besides, there are more important things I have to write these days, my resume, for instance.

      Alright, so I had this amazing dream the other night.  It was romantic, well mostly, it was a touch erotic also.  Which only goes to prove how pathetic my love life truly has become.  But anyway, that's not the point, I was gonna tell ya about this dream.  Of course, I'm gonna have to save the 'good' parts for myself  (wink wink nudge nudge) .    I walk into this fabulously elegant ballroom.  I'm wearing this drop-dead gorgeous dress.  It had this leather corset and black velvet skirts, with lace accents.  Oh, did I mention it was a masquerade ball I was attending.  So I had this mask on, it was that iridescent purple-y black color with feathers, very sexy, very mysterious.  This man walks up and asks me to dance.  He's wearing this 'Phantom of the Opera' type mask so all I can see are his eyes and lips.  And he has this exquisitely tailored tuxedo on, the kind that accentuates the good parts on his impossibly built body.   (Mmm, there's just something about a man in a tux!!!) .  I'm speechless, so of course he takes my hand and leads me to the crowded dance floor.  As we are dancing, he's talking to me and I just can't seem to focus on anything but his lips.  And suddenly he leans in and kisses me.  When I open my eyes, I'm in this fabulous bedroom with a four-poster bed with silk sheets and rose petals scattered everywhere.  And the candles, there's nothing more romantic than candle light.  And then, well, I thinks this is where I'm gonna have to stop with the details.  Let's just say there was a nice hot bubble bath, a bottle of champagne and those lips.  Mmmm, yumm...

      Okay, so maybe that statement is a bit harsh.  Maybe I just don't particularly care for photos of me standing next to tall skinny 15 year olds.  Don't get me wrong, I know this picture will be a favorite of mine for the next few years.  But the truth is, I look like a frickin cow standing next to this disgustingly gorgeous young woman.   (And since I know that you are reading this...  You're beautiful, I love you to death, but honestly, hun, how on earth do you think that you are fat?)   I see these teenage girls today, they are stunning.  But for some reason, they think they are fat; they think they are ugly.  And if I were a teenager today, looking back at what I looked like at that age, I have no doubt that I would feel just as inadequate as they do.  I don't blame them, they are constantly slammed with the images of anorexic models and plastic celebrities.  But to hear them talk about themselves is absolutely heart-wrenching.  Image isn't everything and beauty certainly isn't skin deep.  Of all the beautiful people I am priviledged to have in my life, the majority of what I find beautiful about them isn't in their looks at all.  Not that they don't have good looks, they do, but I see more.  I see something deeper in that sparkle in their eyes, something much more than the surface happiness behind their smiles.  I see them for their hearts and their minds and their spirits.  Of course, I'm only human, and for all the beauty I can spot so easily in others, I just can't seem to find it in myself.  Self-image doesn't get any easier to deal with as you age.  I still look at my image in photos and only see that average-looking chubby woman standing next to the breath-takingly gorgeous young woman.  And I truly cherish this particular photo and the friendship that it represents.

       Which Queer Eye Is Right for You?  My Results::: Ted - Food and Wine   Calm, cool, and collected. That's how Ted Allen, your Queer Eye match, handles the dirty dishes, skuzzy kitchens, and hopeless cooks that come his way. Whether he's rolling out phyllo dough or stirring the perfect martini, this gourmet guru never lets you see him sweat. And that tends to be your MO too, even if you'd have a hard time telling the difference between a tea- and a tablespoon.  You've got a meticulous nature and an eye for detail that makes it hard for you not to follow through on anything you set your mind to. And if that means you have to search from store to store to find the perfect purse, cutest shoes, or particular spice, you can bide your time til you find what's right. Ted would be proud.    What's Your Theme Song?  MyResults::: Walking On Sunshine - Katrina and the Waves   Your upbeat approach to life makes "Walking on Sunshine" the perfect anthem for you. We can see you dancing down the vegetable isle with your grocery cart, smiling at all the checkout clerks. We sure hope you've had your Wheaties to keep up with your perky pace all day long. This happy, horn-driven tune carries you to work every day. And even in those brief lapses when you're not fully on your game, "Walking On Sunshine" seems to put things in perspective and get you back to your super groove. "And don't it feel good?" Who cares that this tune was a one-hit wonder for Katrina and the Waves? Even that quality matches your one-of-a-kindness. You're walkin' on sunshine and spreading it wherever you go.   What Kind of Monkey Are You?   My Results::: Chimpanzee   That's right, chimps are the Einsteins of the primate world (so long as you're not counting that species known as human). That's why you might find that you're known as the tinkerer and the "smarty pants" amongst your friends and co-workers. Like most chimpanzees, you're probably an excellent problem-solver and can often find an answer for any conundrum that presents itself — whether you're trying to escape from your cage, making new tools out of twigs, or figuring out how to lure that cute chimp from the next tree over with your charm and affections.  But beyond your brains, you're also known as gregarious and empathetic — you'd help a little old baboon cross the street and then run off to your next venture.  If you're like your chimp cousins in the wild, you'll also have an interest in homeopathic meds and will believe firmly in being healthy through exercise and play. Many chimps steer toward vegetarianism, though the natural world won't begrudge you a meaty meal if that's more your style.  In an argument, you rarely speak without thinking about the emotional toll it might take on the other person, but because you are such a rational thinker, you rarely find yourself in arguments for very long. You tend to convince people of your thought process and resulting opinion with very little resistance. And for you, the best part of the argument is when you can make up — kissing is one of your favorite activities, and one for which you're known.

      I'm so bored right now.  I'm on this site... www.tickle.com.  Some of my result are freakin hilarious.  Look:::   What kind of sexy are you?  My Results::: Sweet 'n' Sexy   You're not overt about your sexuality, but you're not purposely hiding it either — two traits that naturally draw people to you. You possess an understated zest for life, and a way of approaching the day with a can-do attitude that draws people to you. As a teenager, were you maybe a little on the quiet side? Even if you weren't, it's clear that underneath your occasionally understated statements, you have an undeniable sweetness that attracts people who see that special something burning from within.  Is it the way you carry yourself? That quiet sparkle in your eye? Those who know you intimately can't wait to uncover your sweetness. What's hiding behind that innocent smile? A little devil perhaps? A tattoo in a seductive spot saved only for your lover? Possibly, but you're so good, you'll never tell. Or will you?    Who is your inner rock star?  My Results::: Your inner rock star is Britney Spears!   Feel it, sweetheart; the rock star in you is all Britney—the envy of cheerleaders everywhere. One part girl next door, one part naughty sex kitten, you're definitely not as innocent as you look. And that is why nobody can get enough of you. You are the ultimate American girl with some serious staying power. Unlike other success stories, you and Britney are more than just a pretty face: you've got talent, confidence, and the brains to back it up. With a talent list like yours it's no wonder you're at the top of the popularity charts and young men's hearts. We love you. Shout out your inner Britney!   The Beauty Pageant Test  My Results::: Miss Originality   They just don't make many like you. You're an independent thinker who creates her own style in everything you do, from choosing clothes, to solving problems, to planning your next big vacation. The judges sure made note of your one-of-a-kind spirit — it could have been the belly dancing routine, or the funky formal wear — or it could have just been the way you sashayed across the stage with a little extra attitude.  Your unique way of looking at the world makes you a lot of fun to hang around. Who knows what you'll say next — or what fantastic plan you'll come up with for Friday night. So, Beauty Queen, need a platform that's as original as you are? How about encouraging others to stop worrying about fitting in, and start celebrating all our delicious differences?

      This has got to be one of the worst feelings in the world.  I don't even know what it is.  It's a little fear, a little anxiety, a little something I can't put a finger on.  I'm not even sure why I feel this way.  Maybe it's that I've been going through so much change and I know that there is still more to come.  I do know that I am more than a little afraid of re-entering the workforce.  I'm a little sad that my son will eventually be spending more time at a preschool than with me.  I'm terrified that I will easily slip back into the old patterns and habits I once enjoyed.  What if I can't prioritize my life correctly?  I know what they should be, but what if that person I used to be is stronger than the person I have become.  I don't want to be a workaholic.  I want to be a mom.  I want to be a friend.  I want to be the person I am.  But sometimes, I want a little of that person I was to be part of who I am.  The things I miss about my life aren't any surprise.  I miss all the interaction with adults.  I miss having things to talk about that aren't my son or the kids I work with at church.  Don't get me wrong, I love the kids and I LOVE my son but sometimes I just want more.  I know I have to move forward but at the same time, I'm more than a little frightened that I'll lose bits of the things I cherish so much.  It's hard to keep friendships alive when certain aspects change.  I don't want to lose touch with the people I'm close to but I know that I won't have as much time and attention to offer them.  I know that my son will be my priority but what happens if him being my priority turns into me having to make money so that I can care for him.  Will he even remember that I was able to spend so much time with him these past two years?  I certainly hope so...

      I'm writing this as an adult daughter and I'm sure in 20 years or so, I'll understand the answers to all the questions that I am about to pose.  But for now, as a mother of a two year old I just don't get it.  I'm hoping that this never-ending conflict I have with my mother is only because of a lovely personality clash.  I'm hoping that that is the case and that I won't try to control my son's life when he becomes an adult.  I'm also hoping that my mother is just having a really difficult time letting go of her babies.  I can only imagine how hard it is to suddenly realize that all of your children are adults.  I don't look forward to that day, well, some days I do, but not today.  Today, he wants to cuddle and watch movies and sing and dance and hug and kiss.  Today, I just can't get enough of my little boy.  Well, back to my mother...  I'm 26 frickin years old.  I've been on my own for the last 5 years.  Granted the last 2 were spent with my husband and I sharing a house with my mother, but she wasn't making any decisions on how we lived our lives.  The estranged husband would, no doubt, disagree.  According to him, I still do whatever my mother tells me I should.  I have my own theories on that, but that is most definitely another post.  Now that he is gone, my mother insists that I handle it the way she says I should.  Did I mention she harbors a little bitterness towards men?  Why can't she realize that I am not her?    I guess that is just one of the facts of life.  I've dealt with this long, I'll continue to do so form here on out...  And I'm sure that my son will one day have these same thoughts in regards to me and my mothering.

      I'm not always wrong about friends.  Those that I feel will be around for the long haul usually are.  Sometimes they aren't continually an active part of my life but I almost always circle back to them.  My only fear is that I push them away far too much and much too far.  I rarely offer them unconditional love and understanding, therefore I never expect it in return.  When I receive either from anyone, I am completely astonished because I never feel that I deserve it.  There are times when the way I initially think the roles will play out end up being the complete opposite.  I learn the most from those that I once believed I could teach the most.  The ones I end up loving are almost always the ones I started out hating.  Those I hurt the most are the ones I feared would hurt me.  Do I do these things on purpose?  Or are all these actions some sort of sub-conscious decisions I have no control over?  Am I destined to repeatedly make the same mistakes or will I eventually learn to read the signals?  I'm sorry for pushing you the way I do.  I'm sorry for trying to force you to prove your friendship.  I'm sorry for leaving you wondering if I truly care for you.  I'm sorry for doubting you. I'm sorry for a lot of things, but there's one thing I will never be sorry for, no matter what the outcome.  I am not sorry for loving you.

      I have this foolish idea that I do not need friends.  So when a person offers their friendship, I push them away.  I tell myself not to have any expectations of them yet I hold them to the highest set of standards.  Standards that I, myself, cannot even live up to.  I try so hard to be self-sufficient but it never works.  I hate myself when I realize that I have become dependent upon another person.  In the past, I haven't always had the best of luck with the friends I chose.  I always seem to choose those that want total control, the jealous type, the kind that suck the life right out of me.  And every time I end a relationship like that, I tell myself that is it, no more friends.  Because of all this, I do not trust myself when it comes to making new friends.  So many times I have thought that a friendship would be different than the last.  So many times I have been wrong.  I've ceased believing that this series of failed friendships is anyone's fault but my own.  I am the one that chooses these people as friends.  I am the one that allows those that treat me poorly to do so.  I am the one that sets the unreal expectations.  It is nobody's fault but my own.

      My thoughts have naturally wandered toward fatherhood, tomorrow being Father's Day and all.  Fatherhood is the one subject I don't think I will ever truly understand.  In my entire life, I can think of but a handful of good examples what a father should be.  It's really quite sad the acts that come to mind when I think of fathers...  A young man turns his back on his daughter.  He boards a plane ultimately headed overseas on her first birthday, not to return until she is three.  He re-enters her life as if time has stopped while he was abroad.  It hasn't.  He marries and moves away not long after his return.  They never force the issue of visitation.  A step-father takes his anger out on the face of a defenseless 10 year old, leaving her to spend her summer vacation hiding indoors.  He is forced to leave his two sons behind, the only punishment for his crimes.  A 14 year old is sent to live with the father she never really knew.  She has problems that he does not want to understand.  She is angry at the world and takes it out an anyone who is near.  Reacting to her fit of rage, he throws her across the room to prove to her that he is in charge.  She lays there, a crying crumpled mess, her body bruised and batter.  A desperate 15 year old does everything she believes her father wants of her.  She works so hard at school receiving straight As but nearly putting herself in the hospital.  She becomes the ideal child but still he only sees her flaws.  Nothing she does is good enough.  A confused 16 year old, finally allowed to date, has questions and fears about relationships and sex.  Her father's only advice is "you were a mistake, don't make one yourself."  She comes home from her first date, terrified her parents will know what she has done.  A bitter 17 year old knows only half truths when it comes to the story of her parents.  She has in her possession the only two existing photographs of her true family.  In the photos, her parents are just barely older than she is that day.  She found out the truth that day, that her father was pushing for adoption, that his father had to force him to be an adult, that he chose to run away.  She had to face him two weeks later.  She has never spoken with him about the things she knows.  A strong and foolishly independent 18 year old wants more out of life than her father believes she can accomplish.  Two days after graduation she walks out of that house forever.  A 21 year old finally returns home, if only to say good-bye to her dying grandfather.  She is still not ready to mend the shredded relationship she has with her father.  She says her good-byes, thinking this would be it.  She does not return for the funeral.  An embarrassed 23 year old places a long distant phone call to give her father the 'good' news, he's going to be a grandfather in a few short months.  She's hurt by the lack of surprise in his voice, it would have been easier if this had been a disappointment.  A few months later a message is left on the father's answering machine... "Your grandson was born last night.  There are some complications, I'll call you back when we know more."  A 24 year old wife calls to tell her father about the wedding he was not invited to.  A 26 year old calls her father to tell him that she is all alone.  Her husband left her for another woman.  He turned his back on their young son.  The broken woman this girl has become wants only one thing from her father.  She wants to know that no matter what, he has always loved her, that he always will.  She wants to know that he has always been there, ready to wrap his arms around her, ready to protect her, ready to heal all the hurt she has faced in her harsh world.  A father and a daughter....

      I'm sitting here wracking my brain to think of something to write.  I've been thinking about it for a little over 12 hours now.  So much has gone through my mind today.  I started by thinking about all the secrets I've kept or asked others to keep for me.  Then I thought about all the crazy summers of my youth.  And now I'm sitting here trying to convince myself not to be in love anymore.  3. LOVE He's been gone 3 months now and even with all the crap he's been putting me and our son through, I am still in love with him.  I tell my friends that I know that we are better off without him but the truth of the matter is, if he asked me to take him back right now, I'm not sure I'd have the strength to say no.  I do not want to love him anymore but every time I look at my son all I see is the best of my love.  I just can't look at my son and hate my husband.  I can't bring myself to file for divorce, even though I do not want to be married to a man who can turn his back on an innocent child so easily.  I pray each night for a release I know I already have.  I just can't bring myself to let him go.  2. SUMMER ANTICS I was at the mall yesterday.  It was filled with a crazy mass of teenagers.  As an adult, I hate visiting the mall during summer break.  I hate it for the very reasons I enjoyed it so much 10 years ago.  I was surrounded by aimless adolescents, wandering the mall pretending to have something to do.  I hated being there, feeling old.  Hiding in the corner of the mall with all the other toddlers and their mothers, I started to remember all those times when I was younger, when I myself was a member of that crazy mass.  There was that time that a couple of the sophomore girls got asked out by a couple of the senior boys.  We went to the opening showing of whatever Disney flick it was that year.  Sitting there in a pack theater, bored out of our minds waiting for the movie to start, we decided to have a quick round of truth or dare.  And being boys, they wanted to see how stupid they could get a girl to act in public.  Wonderful "B" was the unfortunate of our pair to choose dare.  Oh, the things a girl will do for the attention of a hott guy.  See, the thing about Birgit was she was blessed with the ability to do a near perfect impersonation of Taz.  And adults being adults, hating being surrounded by teenagers, especially in a packed theater, don't like it when a girl stands up and yells out at the top of her lungs "BWAH-UM-THWAU-HMM-THPAW!" (well, that took about an hour and a half to figure out how to type out?!?) After 'watching' the movie and ignoring all the dirty looks, we got home to suddenly remember that we were not allowed to date yet.  Needless to say, I spent a good portion of my summer vacation on restriction, at least until I arrived in California to visit my mother.  1.  SECRETS Of all the secrets that I've heard, only one was one I should not have kept.  Of all the secrets I ever asked a friend to keep, only five should never have remained secrets.  And if you read this thinking that I was going to divulge anybody's sacred trust in me... Well, now, they wouldn't be secrets if I told you, now would they?

      It's funny the random things you remember about your formative years.  Cherry coke, for instance, reminds me of how much of a rebel I was in high school.  I mean, go figure.  But I suppose when you grow up in a Mormon household, drinking a caffeinated beverage, by all technicalities, is toeing the line.  And for some reason tonight I suddenly remembered my weekly trips to the now non-existent Disney Dandy to purchase my contraband so that my cousin could snag us a pack of cigs.  Now you would think that the stolen cigarettes would remind me of my rebellious streak more so than cherry coke but no, that would be too simple.  But cherry coke also reminds me of my Gramps.  He was the most loving man I've ever known, and I'm sure that loving isn't the first, or even the tenth word most would think of when describing him.  Well, I'm glad that I am not most people.  If it weren't for my grandfather, and a handful of other caring adults, I would never have survived high school.  I know he knew about the cherry coke, he actually encouraged me to drink it, being the only Catholic member of our family, he just didn't give a damn.  And the cigarettes, well, I'm sure he had his suspicions, but he never mentioned it.    The only thing I truly regret about the way I've lived my life is the way I left Oklahoma.  It didn't even take a week after graduation for me to hop a plane for southern California.  And my grandfather did what I'm sure must have been one of the hardest things he'd ever done, concerning me, anyway, when he drove me to the airport.  The sad thing is, the last memory I have of the grandfather I grew up loving so dearly, is me walking away, pretending not to see the tears run down his face.  I saw him once after that, about three years later, but the only part I recognized was his eyes.  I could see that same look but that time it was him pretending not to see the tears in my eyes.  He died about 6 weeks later.  I quit smoking about three years ago but as I sit here tonight with an un-lit cigarette dangling loosely from my lips, I can't help but think about watching my grandfather working in his workshop with my cousin trying to keep up and pretending to follow the orders Gramps barked out every so often. Me, drinking cherry coke and ignoring my grandmother's ranting about why I shouldn't be drinking the stuff.  She didn't complain about the stench of stale smoke that lingered on my clothes when I visited them that winter, nor did she say a word when I came walking in with a liter bottle of cherry coke.  Disney Dandy is gone now.  So is my grandfather.  I've quit smoking but the cravings are there when stress is high.  One cigarette in the past three years is pretty damn good for someone who started smoking at 11.  But when you slip up and mention you want a cigarette so much it hurts....  When you don't have to see that person you said it to to know that if you could see them all you would see is how much they truly care about you, how much they fear that you could very easily turn back into that person they never knew and probably don't believe you could ever be... The craving dissipates.  Well,thank goodness I still have CHERRY COKE!!!

      Don't have a clue of where to begin...  These past weeks have been so hectic.  My best friend got married and will move away soon.  She isn't even back from her honeymoon and I miss her soo much.  But eventhough she is moving away, I know that I am not losing her friendship.  And I had so much fun being one of her bride's maids.  And the funniest thing happened while we were getting the programs printed for the wedding...  I walk into the store my grandmother works at and standing at the enterance is one of my long lost friends.  And OMG, she works with my grandmother!!!!  It was frickin crazy cause I've been thinking about her for so long and I didn't know what to say if I called her.  It's pretty amazing how things happen with friendships, how they change and grow throughout the years...  True friendships never fade, the just lay in waiting for you to stumble upon them when you need them most.  Someone just sent me this quote... "~somewhere there's someone who dreams of ur smile, and finds in ur presence that life is worth while. So when u r lonely remember it's true somebody somewhere is thinking of u" and this one too... " True friends are never apart, maybe in distance, but not in heart".  I just found those so fitting to the introspective mood I've been in lately.  Especially since, in the past 6 months, I've re-connected with 2 of my very best friends after 4 years.  I am moving to the next stage of friendship with a couple of friends as they take that next step in their lives... marriage.  And then there is that one friend who I never would have realized was such a good friend if it weren't for the unfortunate circumstances we have found our selves... divorce.  And a family member who I am fortunate enough to be friends with as well, that's the best cause not only do they love you because they have to but because they want to also.  And finally, the new friend...  the one that shows that you are growing up because you have finally taken on the role of mentor.  The one where you suddenly realize exactly how much you have to offer someone who is somewhere you have been before.  The one where you realize that just because you are 10 years her senior, you still can learn a lot from her.  The one that gives you a fresh look on life...  The one that reminds you of and makes you aware of the many possible reasons why the people that hold that place in your life that you hold in hers really honestly cherish their friendships with you.  But most importantly, she's the one that reminds you what it is to have unconditional love purely because you want to, even with all the flaws.  And all these friends, these blessings, they have done one thing for me.  They have helped me to realize that I am so incredibly blessed.  I can feel there strength as I blindly move forward in life.  Some are far ahead of me, guiding me through the fog.  While others are right in step with me.  And one even somewhere behind me, using me as a guide, reminding me to strive to be the best friend I can.  Reminding me that it is all a cycle.  A cycle of love and faith and friendship and trust.  But most importantly, it stregthens my unwaivering faith in God...  If by chance I have mentioned you in this post, I hope you would know exactly who you are.  I hope that you will never doubt how much I cherish and love you...  I love you forever!!!

      Hey §weet Potato!  &nbsp;  I'm so glad we became friends.&nbsp; You have helped me through so much.&nbsp; I am blessed to have had you in my life and I hope that you will remain in my life for a long time to come.&nbsp; Thousands of miles will soon seperate us, but that doesn't mean that our friendship will change.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have a lot of growing up to do and we may grow apart but I promise that I will always be your friend.&nbsp; You are a truly amazing young woman.&nbsp; Your beauty astonishes me, and I'm not talking about looks here.&nbsp; I know that God has a very important plan for you.&nbsp; I know that at times you are faced with difficult decisions.&nbsp; I know that you will make the right choices if you want to, and I hope you will want to.&nbsp; I'm sorry for the times that I have hurt you.&nbsp; Thank you for forgiving me so easily.&nbsp; But I suppose what I really want you to know is that no matter what I say or do, I will always cherish our friendship.&nbsp; You may never understand those fears I have in regards to friendships, and I hope you never will.&nbsp; I also hope that you will always be as patient and understanding with me as you have been so far.&nbsp; No matter where I go or what I do, know that you will always be a part of me.&nbsp; You hold a very special place within my heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;   If there is ever a time when you feel all alone, remember those quotes you sent me one night...&nbsp; "~somewhere there's someone who dreams of ur smile, and finds in ur presence that life is worth while. So when u r lonely remember it's true somebody somewhere is thinking of u"and "True friends are never apart, maybe in distance, but not in heart"   But on the lighter side of things...&nbsp; I've enjoyed our little private jokes and nicknames for each other.&nbsp; It's always nice to have a friend that you are so comfortable with that you can make a complete fool of yourself.&nbsp; I've lost track of how many times I've done that in your presence.&nbsp; From here on out, everytime I see Fruity Pebbles, Pop-tarts, Slurpees, or Kool-Aid, I will have to laugh and smile.&nbsp; Words that are meaningless to everyone else will always mean so much to me...&nbsp; HMPH, WHOOOOOOSH, Ho,&nbsp;brain cell, just to name a few.&nbsp; I'm sure I could think of a million more things but I seem to be&nbsp;getting sleepy&nbsp;and I still have a couple more things I need to say.   I love you babe, so much more!&nbsp; You will always be Stinky no matter how pretty you smell.&nbsp; You will always be a 'young one'&nbsp; no matter how old you are.&nbsp; You will always be a lazy bum no matter how hyper you may become.&nbsp; You will always and forever be my friend.  &nbsp;  Love ya tons of bunches and bunches of tons, forever and ever!!!  &nbsp;  Love~  ~Me

      So things are set in motion and my life is finally going somewhere.  My step-mom will be in California on the 29th of July and we will be driving back to Oklahoma a day or two later.  I have two Sundays left at church, that's the worst part of it.  I've known a lot of these people over half my life and a few of them, I've already had to say good-byes like this.  Some of my friends that I left behind before are still my friends, one is my very best and if it weren't for her family I wouldn't have been able to make the decisions I am making right now.  And I already have my first house guests!  YAYA!!!  And other friends, we promised to always be friends, we promised that things would never change.  Things changed and less than a year later we could barely smile and say hi when I was visiting the next summer.  Stories were spread, mostly untrue, and things were believed that a true friend should have known could never be said.  Some wounds never heal and you realize that at the most unfortunate times.  Something someone says triggers a memory and you instantly do something you know you will regret.  No matter how hard you try to fix things, you know it will never be the same.  A deep dark sadness fills the lonely places within your heart, the places left empty by the happiness you have forced out with fears and insecurities.  That pride you try so hard to hide from yourself keeps you from saying what you need your loved ones to know.  It hard to apologize.  And it's even harder to re-assure them that it was a momentary lack of thought.  Maybe now they will believe you when you say that you are not the person they think they love, not completely anyway.  But back to my moving, I'm very excited and I know that this is where I need to be.  I know that some of these good-byes may be our final good-byes.  I also know that most are just temporary.  But I know that whatever type of good-bye it is, it doesn't mean that there it was never a true and loving friendship.

      There is so much on my mind these days...  So much that I can't seem to form a clear thought.  I want so badly to move on with my life, but habits and people and I, myself, keep pulling me back.  I know what I need to do, but it's almost like I am afraid to take that step.  I've always done the safe thing, made the safe choices.  I've always done what was expected of me.  And now that I am finally trying to step out on my own, I'm being told that I am running away.  As much as I know that I need to do this, I still have those same childish fears that I've always had.  I love my family, I love my friends, but I use them as a crutch.  I use them as the reasons to stay in my comfort zone.  I use them as my excuses to not step into that shadowy place just beyond my line of sight.  I am not running away from anything, well, maybe some things, but sometimes, running away is the only way to set yourself free.  I've prayed and prayed, begged and pleaded with God to not tell me what I already know.  There is no way to deny that I know where my life is going.  The only way that I can get to where I truly need to be is to walk away from everything that I know, to take that first blind step into my future.  And the only way to do that is to put my complete trust and total faith in God.

      It's funny how life happens.  There's a point when you're certain you know all the answers.  You think you have your life all planned out, you know exactly how it will all unfold.  For me, that happened at 18.  I knew for certain that I would never want to return to Oklahoma for anything more than a visit.  I knew that I would go to college and work my butt off to get through in four years.  I was going to have a long serious relationship before I even thought of marriage.  I wasn't even going to think about having children until I was married at least 2 years.  Look at me now...  I dropped out of college at 20.  I was pregnant at 23, married at 24.  Today, at 26, I am a single mother of a 2 year old son.  More than anything, I want to move back to Oklahoma, right back to the family I ran so far away from 8 long years ago.  I know that my place is there.  I knoe that I will have a better opportunity to go back to school, to get back on my feet.  It will be better for my son.  I know the difference between living in a large southern California city and a small Oklahoma town.  I know what it is like to live with a single parent who has to struggle to raise her children.  I know that I do not want that for my son.  I want him to be able to run around in a front yard where I do not have to hover around him.  I want him to be able to sit in a classroom where the teacher knows his name.  I want to be able to know his teachers.  I want him to know all of his aunts and uncles, all of his grandparents.  The hardest part about all of this isn't leaving all my family behind.  It isn't leaving the place I've lived nearly all my life.  It will be difficult to leave the church famliy that has supported me for so long.  But the hardest part will be re-assuring a few people that no matter what, no matter where we all end up, I will always be their friend.  No matter how many hundreds of miles seperate us, they will never be replaced by anybody else, that place they hold in my heart today will be the place they hold forever.
