      Gday,  within the last 2 days, some news were showing that  one out of 1000 french people  were in jail, and  one american out of 75 americans ,  the imprisoned french population doubled in 25 years, I dont know about the american population but this is definitely "high"...:)~~~~~  leading since 9 years the evolution of a non profit foundation in france for 12 youth delinquents of 16 18 in sailing and refitting breaks on yachts on the oceans , it is more profitable for them to undergo the rules of the oceans then those of the street and ghettoes..., not in the first days and weeks as the rules are different :), seasickness :)  another subject I raise in the  value of elected persons  to rule a group, a governement, whatever as a whole, is anyone better then another one,   just different  , this was questioned in france in 16 or 17 century by the french philosopher pascal about the "grace" that god was delivering to some and not to others  nowadays, it would be  success, and being lucky , build your own,   do your own  , dont look for some opportunities to get your life done, is rather my motto...  god, gods and presidents are not ruling lifes :)   any comments ? salut a la compagnie tchoi leca

      gday, bom dia, being this week of june in sao paulo brazil at the eleventh unctad (june 10 to 18 , 2004), united nations conference ont rade and development, regarding the subjects of trade and development, the points of reflexion I stress being raised are socialism and capitalism and their pro and cons, as values and the people adopting them...  first of all, a subject I regard as completely wrong is considering trade for low developed countries, mainly in the sector of agriculture, france and senegal have long time used the peanuts as a export commodity from the second to the first, and forgetting the local market of crops ...  another subject is a tax on the financial transfers which will finance some development projects, these projects not being properly exposed, just the fact of getting of the "bad" financiers dealing "forged" money, or "black" or "white" or what you want dirty :-)  therefore before considering the World trade organization and the globalisation of the world mainly thru  the present Inofrmation technologies and the growth of the sector of low cost airlines, bringing more emigrants to many parts of the world, lets deal with our own local ground, sometimes before looking overseas to consider the advantages of these ore these ones abroad...  Information technologies are due to bring knowledge before the "money" or whichever dollar ...  comments welcome best tchoi leca
