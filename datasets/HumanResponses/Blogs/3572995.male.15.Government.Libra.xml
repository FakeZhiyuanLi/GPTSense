						   It was just yesterday that I was listening to a song by the Backstreet Boys, titled ‘The Call’. Its lyrics went somewhat like this – ‘Let me tell you the story about the call that changed my destiny…’ and so on and so forth. The remainder of the lyrics are of no consequence here, as they do not, in any way whatsoever, concern my telling you the story about THE CALL that changed MY destiny… It was a phone call from the Prime Minister of India, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayeeji to me, a mere teenager; not even eighteen years of age, thus, not qualified to vote in the Lok Sabha Elections, 2004. This event transpired some two weeks ago Getting ready to leave the house for another rehearsal of the play I was working in, I grabbed my bag and reached for the door when all of a sudden, the phone rang…very slowly… I was quite surprised, as normally, the phone rings…well…normally! I strode across the room and picked up the phone. I didn’t get a chance to even say hello when, all of a sudden, a familiar, yet strange voice bid me Namaste. My voice quivered with anticipation as I hesitantly said, “Hello?” I received no reply. Again, I attempted conversation. “Yes, hello?” I asked. Yet, the person at the other end of the line did not deign to reply. I was beginning to consider this call as a prank one and let out a stream of choice Hindi abuses, when the bomb dropped. “Main Atal Bihari Vajpayee bol raha hoon.”  spoke a voice that sounded EXACTLY like that of our respected Prime Minister. The words were spoken real slow, so that I could savour the sound of each syllable. There was no doubt about the fact that it was him: Speaking merely seven words in sixty seconds is an art that none but our Vajpayeeji have mastered. The conversation that ensued thereafter, is as follows:  Me: “H-hello sir…sir, thank you for calling sir…”  Him: “Aapka kimti vote…”  Me: “Sir…I’m not eighteen years sir…I don’t really think –“  Him: “Bharatiya Janata Party…”  Me: “ – that I can vote, sir…but I promise you, sir that –“  Him: “ Ko dijiye…”  Me: “ – I’ll tell all my friends and relatives who are above eighteen to vote BJP, sir! ”  Him: “Dhanya…”  Me: “ Sir, you’re most welcome, sir…sir, I was wondering whether you could help with my tenth           standard results, sir…”  Him: “ …vaad. Click.”         With that click, the direct connection from Number Ten, Janpath, New Delhi to Number Ten,  My Building, Mumbai, Maharashtra was broken. For nearly ten whole minutes after that call, I sat numb in my seat. I couldn’t move at all. I didn’t want to move.  I had to move for my rehearsals but even while performing, I couldn’t work at optimum capacity as ‘The Call’ was on my mind. I came back at night, at around 8:30 PM and making for the chair next to the phone, plonked myself down on it. I sat right there till 9:00 PM and at 10:30, I was forced to move from the side of the phone and to my bed.  I switched on my mobile phone and cradled it in my arms as I slept, hoping desperately that somehow, Vajpayeeji would find my mobile number and call up at two in the morning to discuss his political strategies with me. If he did so, I decided to see to it that ‘Atal, my phone-buddy’ would get the votes of all my eighteen-plus friends, contacts, relatives, teachers, etc. I waited and waited but alas! No call from the Prime Minister was forthcoming. As I finally drifted into a disturbed slumber at 2:30 AM, I got angry with Mr.Vajpayee for not having called and the very next morning, before I left for my rehearsals, I placed the phone off the hook. So what if Vajpayee wouldn’t be able to get through to me when he needed to speak to me most desperately? Served him right! Back from the rehearsals that night, I put all politics out of my mind and didn’t give it a thought till last week. The moment it all came back to me, I decided to write about it but didn’t get any time off from my busy schedule to do so; at least, not till today, when I began to write this article… I am a teenager. A fifteen year old teenager, to be precise. Hormones rage inside me, changing me; changing the way I think and the way I feel… I have, since last week, developed this insecurity about not getting enough attention from leaders of political parties… It makes me feel as though I am not important at all… Hence, even as I type this, I sit beside the telephone, waiting eagerly, for it to ring…very slowly… Maybe Vajpayeeji will call up again… Or perhaps…just perhaps, I’ll get a phone call from a certain ex-Italian senorita, telling me (irrespective of the fact that I wont be eighteen for another three years) to cast my ‘kimti’ vote for… shall I say…’Gandhiji’?
