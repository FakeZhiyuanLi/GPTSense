      I LOVE The Honorary Title. Concert Monday with Jen!  Work was cool tonight, as usual. Tommy is my homeboy. He gave me a kiss on the cheek, "so totally fab"... I smell like the work kitchen.  Well, as if anyone who reads this cares... I talked to Matt last night again and I sent him a few CDs. For me, that's pretty exciting.  I was planning on going to see the new M. Night Shyamalan movie with Nikole, but she saw it already, so if anybody wants to go see it, let me know, Kelly maybe? Other that that, I saw Napoleon Dynamite the other night, which I think I already mentioned, but it was really funny, at least I thought so.  "I'm filling in the empty spaces where you, you left your mark" Random Honorary Title quote from Cats In Heat, because I'm listening to it. Peace out  Cuidado Piso mojado Caution Wet Floor

      I just ran a few errands, went to the post office to send a few CDs to   someone   in Nantucket, and then I picked up my pictures from Walgreens... oh yeah then I stopped at Burger King because I'm fat. Well I have to say that I got the funniest roll of pictures developed, I haven't laughed so hard by myself in a long time. Unfortunately I can't post all of them because Nikole, Kelly, and I copied the pictures from something else... a long story. But I have a few to post, like my new hair cut, pictures of Matt!, and a funny picture of Nikole.   Oh yeah Steve Lega is cool.

      Today I opened the new bank account, and I have an ATM card now... yes! After that my mom and I went down to Elmwood and ate lunch and went in all the stores, I saw a cool pair of shoes that I would buy if i hadven't been spending so much on shoes lately...  I got my hair cut, then I dyed it... I like it a lot.  I think I am going to see Napoleon Dynomite tonight, but before that, Joe and I are getting the cake log at DQ when we visit Jenny.  And risking sounding like a dork... I like Ashlee Simpson, I don't know why, I guess she's just cute. Oh well, just call me mainstream...

      Saw  I, Robot  tonight... it was really good actually! I love big Willie style, aka Will Smith. He's "jacked" in this movie.  I think that maybe I'm going to start a checking account tomorrow at the bank, at First Niagara maybe, then I'm going to use my Fleet account to save for England next summer, and the First Niagara will be for shopping and for saving money for clothes and what not.  Also, I'm dying my hair tomorrow, not any different color, just a re-dye.  I got this wart froze off... it's gross. But, when I was at Nikole's yesterday we went to tops and I bought new bandaids, Disney Princess style.   Alright, I'm bored... talk to you soon

      Been a whole lot easier since the bitch left town  Been a whole lot happier without her face around  Nobody upstairs gonna stomp and shout,  Nobody at the back door gonna throw my laundry out  She hold the shotgun while you do-si-do  She want one man made of Hercules and Cyrano  Been a whole lot easier since the bitch is gone  Little miss, little miss can't be wrong   Little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong  Ain't nobody gonna bow no more when you sound your gong.  Little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong  What'cha gonna do to get into another one of these Rock 'n' roll songs?   Other peoples' thoughts they ain't your hand-me-downs  Would it be so bad to simply turn around  You cook so well, all nice and French  You do you brain surgery too, with a monkey wrench   Little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong...   I hope those cigarettes gonna make you cough  Hope you hear this song and it pissed you off  I take that back I hope your doing fine  And if I had a dollar I might give you ninety-nine   Little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong....

      Work was fun tonight, as usual. Tommy told me about his 19 year old boyfriend and his 22 year old brother who he is also dating... strange because he's 40...&nbsp;I mean, Matt is 22, Tommy and I in the same dating age range, hahaha... oh well, speaking of Matt, I wish I was still in Nantucket... sigh, I left my phone charger there to so my phone is dying and I can't make any long distance phone calls because for some reason that drains the battery, so I have to wait for Jordan to send that back before I even call him again.  I miss Jordan, I wish she didn't have to go back to school so soon after she gets back from the Isle, but I'll probably try and visit her a lot during the winter, it's going to be hard since I work weekends though, I'll figure something out.  I'm gonna go to bed because I have no life, and this is what I do, I update my blog. Boring. Later.

       I'm home! (from the best trip ever) I guess I'll post about it in a day by day fashion...    Monday : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well my flight from Newark to Nantucket was delayed a little bit so I didn't get to Nantucket until like 1:30pm instead of like 12:10pm, which meant that I sat in the Newark airport for like 4 hours... alone, it was so boring, but I finished one book for English. When I got to Nantucket Bree, Gretchen, and Todd picked me up from the airport and I went to visit Jordan at Fog Island. Then we went back to eat a cake that Sabrina and Andrew helped make for me with Mark, Ann, Bree, and Jordan. My cousins have to be the most beautiful kids on the planet, seriously. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monday night, Bree, Jordan, and I walked around downtown looking in shops and stuff and at enormous yachts in the private section... All the while my heels kept getting stuck in the boardwalk, it got annoying. But at one point one of my shoes came completely off because it was stuc right in front of some people, it was hilarious. Then we saw this guy tap dancing on the street and we gave him a cookie and a bottle of water, his name was Rick. He told us that he was in a musical on the island and it just so turned out that Jordan and I were going to see in the next night. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At night we went to the Irish boys' house... they are so cool, obviously they're all from Ireland, but I don't think many of them remember me visiting, they were all pretty much stoned.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well it turns out that sleeping in a twin bed with your sister is really uncomfortable.   Tuesday : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tuesday when we woke up, Jordan and I rode our bikes to the beach and spent the entire afternoon there, it was super nice out and fun. We had to leave though so we could get home and get ready for the musical which was at 6:30pm. We showered really quick and tried to catch the 6:15pm shuttle downtown... which didn't end up coming, so we had to hitchhike downtown. Grabbed a rollup at the Fog Island and proceeded to go to the wrong place... When we found the right place we were too late so we ended up going for ice cream instead.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that we walked past this really expensive restaurant that this cute Irish boy (Stewart) that my sister wanted me to meet worked at, so we ended up eating there too... it was so awful, I ate so much beforehand... plus... the food sucked! And I had to pay like $30... ugh.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well then Jordan and I walked around downtown and saw two boys playing guitar for money on the side of the street... let me add, two incredibly talented and good looking boys. So we sat and watched them for a while, we bought CDs and I left my number with the one kid named Matt and told him to call me after he was finished, apparently the other kid had a girlfriend... boo. We went back to the Fog until Matt called and we met him at the Juice Bar for ice cream really quick, but we ended up leaving like almost immediately, much to my disappointment. Then pretty much we just went to bed after that.   Wednesday : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wednesday was the best day by far... We woke up and went to this deserted beach with huge waves with Bree and Gretch, and two other girls I didn't really know. But as we were enjoying the huge waves, we all decided to go naked in them... so we did. Wow! It was awesome. And incredibly funny to see peoples butts popping up out of the waves, and getting smacked into other naked people as you are tossed in the waves. Hahahaha I am laughing thinking about it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wednesday evening we went out to Sushi by Yoshi... It was awesome, and they gave me a fork... they never give out forks, but it just came with my meal, luckily for me. It was bring your own wine, so we brought a bottle with us. After that Bree, Jordan, and I finally went to see that musical and hung around with Rick afterwards, who, if i haven't previously mentioned, looks just like Sylvestor Stallone. We got ice cream, again, then we watched the boys play some guit and bongos (they weren't bongos, but close enough for me). Then Dermo (my sister's friend from that house of those Irish&nbsp;guys) ran into us on the street and talked to us for a bit, he's so sweet (if you understand what he's saying). After the guys were done playing music, Rick, Bree, and Jordan forced me to go talk to Bongo Matt, so I invited him to get some tacos with all of us, which he quickly agreed to. Bree ended up going home early because she had to work in the morning, and Rick left at the same time. So Jordan, Matt, and I walked down by the yachts again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matt and I talked about Radiohead... he's so dreamy... he's got a beautiful voice too when he sings. We walked to Matt's house... and you'll never believe what movie he LOVES and wanted to watch... Moulin Rouge. It was so cute. So we watched that... and he had two beds which was more than Jordan had so we slept at his house... I didn't sleep too well because he snores like a maniac, but I can say this... he is a goooooooood kisser.  Pretty much from there it was just my trip home, I got Matt's number and I&nbsp;plan on keeping&nbsp;in touch, he's the most handsome boy I have ever met... sigh :)  Well I'm headed out now so... keep it real, homies.

      Ahhh... home from work, another good day. Work always is. TOMMY IS BACK!!! I walked in and I hear "Hey baby!", oh I love him. &nbsp; Went to that church in Hamburg this morning with Pete, Whitey, Melisa, and her friend. I liked it, it was huge though... they had like a coffee shop inside and an office building. A little too impersonal for me, but it was a great sermon. Forgiveness. And believe me I did something I've been needing to do for a long time, I prayed and I forgave. I feel great now, and I hope that the person I forgave can feel it too (though I haven't told him).  &nbsp; Anyways, even though it was great, I think I need to go back to Christ Gospel next week. I miss the people. &nbsp; Well I'm leaving tomorrow morning at 6:30 am for Nantucket, I'll be home thursday. See ya!

      Heading off to bed because I'm beat. I work a steady 4-9 but by steady I mean that i ate and drank diet pepsi steadily for 5 hours. Then Nicole, Kelly, Steph, Cait and I headed off to Pete's for a bonfire. I had fun, we made magic smoothies. MOHAWK! &nbsp; Anyways in the morning I am checking out Hamburg Wesleyan Church with Melisa Rae, Pete, Whitey and one of Melisa's friends tomorrow, and I have to be out in OP at 10:30... Alright, goodnight!

      My birthday ends in a few minutes. It was fun I suppose, I hung around the house with my family for a bit then went to work. Nicole and Kelly came to work and told Eric that it was my birthday which of course was a big deal... sheesh. Not so bad, I hung around after work with Mike, Eric, and "Andrew" (who did in fact find Nicole  very  attractive). Then my dad came and got me and now I'm at home listening to the new Honorary Title CD. It's really good, I can't wait for the concert. Goodnight for now!  &nbsp;   The Honorary Title - Revealing Too Much  &nbsp;  Accentuated by the mobile dungeon or fluorescence  As I fall out of love, this wasn't supposed to happen  Not according to you  &nbsp;  Please don't allow your voice to face  Don't fall so weak to fault or blame  To give yourself reason for an end  &nbsp;  We'd have our own subway car in the middle of the night  I'd work the same job and play the same bars on every weekend  As the grafitti scrolls by  &nbsp;  Please don't allow your voice to face  Don't fall so weak to fault or blame  To give yourself reason for an end  &nbsp;  And at the end of your low you pin my shoulders against the mattress  Arching your frame with your stomach pushed outward  Your head tilting back with your mouth partially open  The sounds slur and elevate slowly in volume  When you wake up with your family gathered round  Remember that our love was true  And I will not allow you to destroy yourself&nbsp; &nbsp;  I hope that I'm not revealing too much

      I'm going to Nantucket to see Jordan on Monday the nineteenth. I'm excited.   On another note, I've been thinking a lot about clothes I really want to buy, I want these pink shoes from Banana Republic, and a new pair of jeans I don't care from where I'm just feeling the jeans. I also want a new skirt and  urlLink this pair  of Ugg Boots. Well I figure I'll save my money this summer and buy it near the end when school will be starting up again.   Nicole, Kelly and I hung out yesterday we went to Ricottas and took some "cool" pictures, I went swimming for the first time this summer and it was great, I really want to go to the beach sometime soon.  Anyways, I'm out for now, Peace and God Bless.

      Tommy quit!      Apparently he wasn't getting paid enough, well... good for him I suppose, I'll miss him.  Missed church this morning hopefully I'll make it next week. I only worked two and a half hours today because we didn't get any customers. Well... I "worked" two point five hours, more like drank diet pepsi at the bar, ate stuffed shells, and watched a Jean Claude Van Dame movie (I don't know if that's spelled right).  I might post some pictures that i was going to put on my livejournal a while ago later. Prom ones... maybe.

      I ended up going to the mall this morning and buying that bracelet. Along with four charms for it... The first one was a peace sign, and then I went to look around in other stores and I found this one with a guit and it says "Rock n' Roll" so I got that too. Then my mom and I had a conversation that went as follows...  Mom: Well now your friends will know what to get you for your birthday.  Me: I don't want   charms   for my birthday mom.  Mom: Why not?   Me: Because they'll buy me some gay one probably.  Mom: Like what?  Me: Like that pig one.  So five minutes later we're back at new age and I bought two more charms...  Mom: So which one did you end up buying?  Me: ...the pig...  Yeah not that funny, but my mom made fun of me for it. Oh well. Later.

      Well i got my first paycheck today, I guess Nikole was right, I do get paid weekly. I really like my job, especially Tommy (the gay one)... and Mike is  very  cute, but of course, he's married. Anyways... I am thinking of buying one of those Italian Charm bracelets, or whatever they are, tomorrow, I think they're cool.  Becoming friends with Tommy has only reinforced the feeling that i have on gay marriages, because interacting with him I have seen that his homosexuality is not harmful in any way shape or form to anybody around him, and if he chose to get married, which he has in the past, it would have no effect on anybody but he and his husband. He is a sweet person, and I personally would be ashamed to tell him that he doesn't have the right to get married.  I'm going to be working tomorrow at 4pm again and Sunday as well, which means I won't be working Sunday in the morning and I can go to church, which I couldn't do last weekend. Church is awesome, except for one thing... and everybody who knows me knows what that one "thing" is. If not, his initials are CK and he's lame... I won't continue that because it'd be immature.  Goodnight everyone, I'll post soon, for you avid readers.

      I turned on HBO today and watched the last hour or so of an interesting movie. It was called  Lovely & Amazing  (  2001  ) I recommend it to everyone, I think I'm going to go and rent it to watch the whole thing. If my word isn't enough... Jake Gyllenhaal is in it briefly, and I know he's  my  ideal dream boy, so check it out. If you'd like to watch it with me, let me know. Here's a  urlLink website  that tells a little about it.   I don't know what the rest of you are thinking, but John Edwards is sort of good looking, I think he may swing the ballot towards Kerry with his boyish smile. Which is alright with me.  also, on a side note, I have decided that there are two "hollywood" couples that i really like, Jake Gyllenhaal and Kirsten Dunst, and Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow.

      alright, i've decided to create a blog, it's going to be a bit different than my live journal was. i'm pretty much going to express my views here on currents events, politics, and whatever is happening in my life. if you'd like to comment, you're open to.   yesterday i found myself in a heated argument with somebody about abortion and gay marriages. i feel that these decisions should be personal and decided individually. some (usually close minded) people feel that because they think something is wrong that nobody should be allowed to do it. this sounds to me like they want everybody to be the same, just like them... communism anyone? i mean, if you really oppose homosexuality, then don't engage in it, it's that simple, but you can't force that feeling onto somebody else. that's like the government outlawing buddhism because it's "not right" and the "bible doesn't say it's right". don't get me wrong, i'm a christian, and i believe in god and follow the bible, but also, i am human and i understand that people need to choose their own path in life, if those paths happen to be "sinful" then that is the individuals decision, not mine, nor anybody else's. i think that people should just view it as they view their own life, people generally choose actions that they perform by what they think is right and wrong and they think that by doing this they are choosing their path in life, and some believe that by doing this they will end up in heaven. well then let's let other people do the same, if you think that they are sinning and are going to hell... let them, it's their choice, not ours.  anyways, the comment box is open. i'll probably post again soon.

      David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust I think pretty much describes a friend of mine:  Ziggy played guitar Jamming good with Weird and Gilly And the Spiders From Mars He played it left hand But made it too far Became the special man Then we were Ziggy's band  Ziggy really sang Screwed up eyes and screwed down hair-do Like some cat from Japan He could lick 'em by smiling He could leave them to hang Came on so loaded man Well hung and snow-white tan  So where were the Spiders While the flies tried to raid our bowls Just the beer light to guide us So we bitch about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands  Ziggy played for time Jiving us that we were voodoo But the kids were just crass He was the nazz, with God-given ass  He took it all too far    But boy, could he play guitar       Making love with his ego   Ziggy sucked up into his mind Like a leper messiah When the kids had killed the man We had to break up the band  Ziggy played guitar   Not that that is a bad thing, because Ziggy Stardust is a sweet song. Anyways, work was slow tonight and the entire night Michelle and Mike told me that my butt was big, I guess that's what I get for calling Mike a creep and Michelle flakey haha... anyways I might go out with Pasquale and Eric in a bit... later

      To be completely random, something I was just thinking...  I have a total crush on Jake Gyllenhaal, as I think I stated I liked him and Kirsten Dunst before, but now that they've split, I'd take him. I watched two movies with him in it yesterday and today on HBO.  Also, I dig David Gray, he may not be the most attractive musician but in his music video, it wasn't he and a girl or anything, it was he and his guitar, I respect that, a musician that wants to show off his baby (his guit) is the most classic genuine and traditional type, the type I usually like.

      Well as most of you probably know, a friend of mine had a bit of an accident this week which I won't explain in details here because it isn't my business to. But I've been with him at the hospital quite a bit this week and so I haven't been home or online much if anybody was wondering. I want to thank everybody who prayed for him, and even for me, it was stressful. Um, well, he's home now, he's going to be okay, I'm extremely happy and relieved. He means a lot to me and to a lot of people.  Along with that exhausting me emotionally and physically this week, which I don't regret don't get me wrong, it was just hard to sleep and stuff, but besides that my blood pressure medicine was doubled this week after my blood tests didn't come back that good so the side effects of that medicine are wearing me down too... drowsiness, lethargy, dizziness... etc. So if I've been grouchy, I apologize.  Well if you want to know my mood right now, I'm extremely happy, work was fun tonight, my boss told me that Tommy has a present for me from his vacation and I get it tomorrow, and Eric is back at work and that's always fun. I'm also happy because my buddy is home and he is able to have his friends there and rest in his own bed or couch, and I'll be able to sleep! Here's to a very interesting week! God bless!

That night at like 2:30am Furlani and Carl called me and woke me up, then I didn't get much sleep because i had to get up early to drive my mom and my cat to the vet. I worked all day Saturday which was pretty fun, there was a white trash wedding reception at Eddie Ryans. After that nothing really happened so I got a good night's sleep. I went to church this morning which was a lot of fun, it was good to see Bobbo, and I donated $50, which is like pretty much all of last weeks pay check, oh well, it's for a good cause I suppose. I'm going to work at 4 today too... then sherkston Monday!

      Went for lunch with Nikole and Kelly today at Dennys... DEREK'S MOM WAS WORKING THERE! And for some reason Kelly already knew that. "Can I have... ONE EGG?"  Saw my dad play softball today, a double header, he won both! It was fun but freezing, I took some pictures of him playing ball, I might post them when I get them developed.  The Honorary Title has a video for  urlLink Bridge and Tunnel !!!!!!!!!!!

      My dad has been sending me these knowledge e-mails that he subscribed to for the past few days, and he sent one about the Statue of Liberty because of it's recent reopening to the public. I guess that the French actually planned, constructed, deconstructed, and shipped Lady Liberty in boxes to the U. S. where it there sat unconstructed for a long time, until an immigrant from Hungary finally pushed the Americans to put her up...  Well, I guess it's not news that Americans are fat and lazy, we've always been that way. Which reminds me that I want to see that movie Supersize that I saw a poster for when we went to see Fahrenheit 9/11, it's about McDonalds!

      I took a bike ride today, I was planning on dropping off an envelope full of Equal sweetener at Phil's house, but he wasn't home. So i rode to my dad's work and hung out there for a while.  And the comments in my blog are pretty immature, I think that if you don't like reading what I'm writing, you should probably stop reading it. Also if you're so concerned with what I wrote in the first post, I also said I'd be talking about whatever's happening in my life.  On another topic, I miss my brother, weird because I didn't really talk to him all that much when he was home, but, I guess I'm just worried he'll get hurt over seas. I miss Jordan, but she should be home in like 2 weeks I think, which reminds me... school starts soon and I have two books to read.

      I just got a funny postcard from 1-800-FLOWERS...  "Dear Molly,      Staying connected to the people you care about -- that matters to you. Last year at this time, you sent a great gift to someone important on their special day. We want to help you be a part of the celebration again this year. Below we have included some helpful information:  RECEPIENT: Christian Kosmoski OCCASION: Birthday ORDER DATE: 7/27/03"  I'll get right on that...

      Well the concert was amazing, it was the best night I've had all summer. And before anyone says anything to me, I know i misspelled bass in the first picture of Aaron, sorry I was typing without thinking. I was excited to see The Honorary Title again, I bought a T-shirt and talked to Jarrod and Aaron for a bit. I didn't really like the other opening bands and Jen and I didn't even stay for the headlining band. But it was the best concert I've ever been to, except for Radiohead and the other Honorary Title concert I went to...  I hope they come around again, or I will make sure to go see them somewhere, they said they're headed home now, and they hope to get their own tour going sometime. Well I wish them the best of luck, they are an amazing band. If anyone wants to check them out, their Cd is for sale for like $10 at Home of the Hits on Elmwood, and their website is  urlLink www.thehonorarytitle.com  or  urlLink www.purevolume.com/thehonorarytitle  .  Jen and I ate at Applebees after the concert and I used an ATM machine for the first time ever, it was exciting. We didn't have enough money for a tip so I left a note and a pack of gum, oh and a Sacajawea (I don't know if I spelled that right). Thank you Jen for making my night a blast.  We also had a screaming rant after the concert in the car on the way home which was hilarious, just yelling stuff that made no sense with a whole lot of profanities, I guess energy was high.  Well I'm in a really good mood now, I went out for the first night in weeks last night and I feel really good. I guess I need to start some sort of life to feel okay. I miss my sister, among a million other things and people. Well... I'll be hoping for snow days from the first day of school I guess... just like every other day of high school I've ever had... oh well, one more year  "Please let the snow swallow the streets whole, keep the bus from coming, let us stay at home..."
