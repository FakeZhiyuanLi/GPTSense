      So now that I have this intraweb diary, I have almost no idea what to write on it.  I don't even know if I want to care about proper spelling (no one else really seems to mind much) or punctuation (not many of you would even notice improper p, I'm convinced); I must though, as all but the occasional lapse will sour my soul. I've hemmed and hawed about entry number 2 for days.  As I had no purpose in creating this web diary except to reply to Palinode, it lacked purpose; I lacked purpose. But no more.  I am going to babble at you (don't worry, I will delete the worst of it before you even see it) until purpose develops; I purpose to find purpose. I now hate the word "purpose". Immensely.  I would delete all uses and mentions of it above, except that I wish to preserve the reason why I hate it so. Lately my remembrances of my dreams have been extraordinarily brief.  Not just brief by my usual standards (I have had my share of epic dreams, one of which I am still working on turning into a novel), but damn near Hegelian sense-certainty brief.  Last night I dreamt that I was running.  I have no idea where I was, what the light was like, what I was wearing, whether fast or slow, hot or cold, fatigued or exhilarated.  Just running.  Yesterday if you asked me in the morning what I dreamt, I would have told you that I was holding something orange.  No idea what or where, etc.  It is very hard to realize that you are lucid dreaming when your recollection amounts to doodly-squat.

      Somehow, I  accidentally  made this blog, so I figured I'd post.  This could be the start of something beautiful.  tear.

      Well, I had written a very nice, poking-fun-at-myself entry about how I haven't read Ulysses yet, and all the mock shame I felt about it.  I told you that I have been trying to read it for about fifteen years, but that I keep putting it down to read other things. I told you all about books I read in the summer of 95, although there was a star which led you to the bottom of the page, where you would have read that although I had read those books, I hadn't in '95, as I can't find my Have Read list from that summer. Ooh, I even remember typing something like "it (the list) was supposed to be over there, see, where clearly there is now only that stupid pink bear, the star-shape-icecube tray. And Ulysses."   I talked abit about the Quest, but not much (again from the memory hole: "the short version is that we were four good friends who fucked off a year or so of school to have a lot of creative fun, and every year since we get together to drink a lot of coffee."), only to mention that I did not keep my Quest goal for QE 10 to read the Big Books I hadn't read yet that I owned, which included Ulysses. I never read any of them. One of them was Infinite Jest, and I mentioned that after reading a  urlLink Mimi Smartypants  entry about her love of the book, I picked it up, and um, moved it to a new pile.  There was also a few lines about how I wanted to have read Ulysses for today, bloomsday, about how I was ready to not get a lot of stuff, but the book hasn't even been moved. By now it should be plain to you: I lost an entry. I was just about done, ready to preview it, and I wanted to find one last link on "summer of 95" using  urlLink Bananaslug . My browser crashed, and me with no back-up. I thought that there would be warning signs, as there usually is.  Not this time. grrr.  This entry is vastly unfresh compared to the original, as it had fun fresh links to reviews of books, and to a few other sites, which this entry clearly does not possess. It also had some stuff about me feeling like a fake intellectual, that soon I will get kicked out of the club ("bounce! bounce!! bounce!!!"). Oh! and there was this whole riff on the fake University course I had to take on faking knowledge of texts and authors, but it was really overworked, and I'm glad it's gone. I will, however, finish in the same spirit as before. I am off for a pint of Guinness, and will be carting the Big U with me for one more kick at the cat.

         I know I promised that I would write about "Idiot Proof" when I was finished it, and that was a long time ago.  Well, the truth of the matter is that I didn't finish it, as it is very annoying.  So annoying that I hurled it across the room (with only ten pages left), dinging the corner of it on the hardwood.  It still reposes near the box of homemade wine near the unfinished bookshelf Che gave me.  I have only hurled one other book previous to this: Grendel by John Gardner.  With three pages left, the book took such an infuriating turn I couldn't stand (well, sit) to hold it anymore.  Whing! Scare the crap out of Max (the psychotic cat) did I, yes I did.  I finished it, eventually, and I will finish Idiot Proof as well. Then you too can marvel at how many stupid things this man says. Hmm, and since Nick Hornby praises it in some issue of  urlLink Believer  I have kicking around, maybe I'll kick him around a little, too.     I did finish my mixed tape for work.  Following is the list of bands in the order they appear: Neutral Milk Hotel; Cat Power; Jesus and Mary Chain; Yeah Yeah Yeahs; Malcolm Mclaren; Sleater-Kinney; Modest Mouse; the Pretty Things; the Vines; Tori Amos; the Beatles; Telepopmusik; the Smiths; Pixies; Sonic Youth; Spiritualized; Dream Warriors; MC 900 ft Jesus; Tom Waits; U2.  Maybe later I'll be all linky with these bands, but right now sleep beckons.

         My name is Starcat, I work in a bookstore, and I'm a libraholic.  In the last four years I have acquired, on average, one book every two days.  Being a normal human, there is no way I can read this many books, and I fall behind by a book or two every week.  This week is certainly no exception, unless you count falling more than two books back an exception (which technically it is).      The new acquisitions are:  Bill Bryson: the mother tongue (for the purposes of a staff pick*); John Gribbin: the birth of time (yes, these last two books do not have capitalized titles on the cover), a Big Bang book about time, which I am sure will give me many a chuckle as the BB is a pile of  ad hoc  hooey, but more on that in some other entry; Bulent Atalay: Math and the Mona Lisa (a book capitalizing on the baffling success of the Da Vinci Code; well, the publisher is trying to capitalize on it, the author probably just wanted to write a book on the genius of Leonardo, and now finds this to be rather easy - in fact, the book is most likely rather poorly proofed, being rushed to publication);  urlLink Josey Vogels  (java alert): Bedside Manners (this one I read); Noam Chomsky: Middle East Illusions (this came free, and it will probably read like I've already read it - American foreign policy is a mixture of the incompetent and rapacious with rare moments of deeply self interested altruism, and the Media rarely reports anything of value as they feel the public is either not interested or wouldn't understand, or else they have a corporate interest in distorting the news for profit, blah blah blah); Dorothy Parker in her own words (when my wit and my drinking collide I can do a mean Dot Parker impersonation: rare, but worth it, at least for me); Robin Robertson: Fresh from the Vegetarian Slow Cooker (this title was all in caps, but I have no need to shout the title at you; yes, I am a vegetarian, and I don't have a slow cooker, but the book is free, and who knows about the future).  * Once a year the staff gets to pick two books to be put on a staff pick table/display for a month or so.  I want one book of fiction, one non-fiction.  The only stipulations are that the book can not be a hardcover, and must be somewhat non-expensive.  Suggestions are welcome, as this sort of thing overwhelms me with options.

      When I was conceived I was not alone.  I had a twin, a sister, and the two of us developed, slowly, together.  Until Fate intervened, and then my sister was no more.  Her nascent body, abandoned by the imperatives of life,  was consumed by mine for nourishment; this was of minor interest to me.  Of major interest is that her soul was subsumed by mine; she lives within me still.  As she exists only internally, and not externally, she matures at only half the rate of the rest of us. Inside me lives the soul of a 16 year old girl.  Like, oh my god! that explains so much! lol! (ahem.) She is a pale girl as she doesn't get much sun.  She has reddish brown hair, and likes to dress in browns and reds.  I have met her a few times in my dreams.  At times we are very close, and others she is quite cold, distant, and tests me.  I should be very wary of her, but I am incapable of mistrusting her, for I love my sister.  She told me her name, but of course that is a secret. She wants to be free; sometimes I let her out, and other times she forces herself out. To her I attribute my preternatural youthful looks, and she is the reason we will see my 125th birthday. I have a twin sister, and I am never alone.

      Hi all.  I'm currently making a mix tape for work. That's right, a mixed cassette.  This really is a lost art, I think, at least for me.  It's been decades since I made a really good one, and most of the ones I've made for work seem somewhat off.  The last tape I made I went with a two song in row from each artist format, which somewhat worked.  This tape I might put the same artists on both sides, if I can work it.  Currently I am listening to Sleater-Kinney's The Hot Rock to see which song has the right blend of energy, harmony, and non-offensiveness (note-wise) for work . I finally had a non immediate sense datum dream last night.  I was on the top of a cliff, which was fairly smooth and level, but it ended abruptly to drop sheer down at least a kilometer.  I was running along, about fifteen feet from the edge, enjoying the clear blue sky, the wonderfully fresh cool air, the general openness of the scenery.  Then I saw a crack in the cliff that I had to jump over.  It was only about two feet across, something that I could easily step over, but as I jumped over it I saw that the crack went all the way down, that if I fell in I would fall a kilometer to my death.  I kept running, still somewhat exhilarated, but now also nervous a little, very much aware of just how freakin' high I was.  I came to another crack in the cliff edge, and this time when I jumped it wasn't nearly so easy, my stomach clenched a little, my legs would barely jump at all.  Still I ran, compelled god knows why.  When I came to the next jump my gut clenched so forcefully I couldn't jump at all, I was so completely focused on the view down to the blurry green trees below (yes, I know, focused on something blurry). My momentum carried me over to the other side, but I couldn't move, I lay on the sun warmed rock, my diaphragm so clenched I couldn't breathe; this is how I woke up: in the grips of intense vertigo, my mind convinced that I was going to fall off the edge of my bed to my death. Now if only I had actually fallen, I probably would've floated down or something, then had an opportunity to fly.  But no, just stupid useless dizziness and fear. I'm currently reading a somewhat nasty book by Francis Wheen called Idiot Proof.  His goal is to reveal the stupidity of the media, of those in power, of us for supporting them, of fad religion and spirituality, fad economics, fad diets, whatnot.  As he was detailing what was wrong with Thatcherism and Reaganomics I was with him, generally; at a certain point he turned irrelevantly mean and nasty: "Why [Deepak Chopra's] longevity formula failed to work for Princess Diana, with whom he lunched shortly before her death, remains a mystery." He grossly miscaricatured (this word looks wrong) several things that I know rather well.  I really want to tear into this guy, but currently I am very tired. I think that I will wait until the next time I post; by then I will have finished the book, and he may redeem himself.  I am guessing he willn't, as his main point seems to be that humanity isn't smart enough to avoid doing stupid things; big deal.

      Well, that experiment went well.  I proved that I am still romanticizing things with my ex-girlfriend, flutterby, and that my emotional state is volatile and prone to extremes. If you are wondering "what experiment?", good. You're lucky.

      So my ex-girlfriend, Flutterby, calls me up. We're thinking about getting back together, and soon, but there was a snag: she hadn't called me for the last three weeks. The reason, I find out, is that someone told her I'd slept with N; I had to laugh when she told me this, as N is a good friend of mine and nothing more.  She doesn't know anything about my friendship with N, though, and I didn't know someone had said this to her. I've been an emotional wreck for weeks, as I was all prepared to decide to move out to Vancouver where she lives, finally, but she wasn't callling. Well, now that we've talked, we seem to be back in a weird limbo state. Moving is now far off on the horizon, and the relationship seems more damaged then ever. Everything in me says "drop it", but we both have a hard time moving on.  bleh.  Now you have to hear about it. However, I'll be merciful, and save you from all of that maudlin stuff. I really do romanticize everything, don't I?

      Like so many online, I am drawn to the spectacle that is American politics. As a Canadian, these things interest me far more than they should. For instance, why is it that practically every week I know most of the news that concerns the  urlLink top 10 conservative idiots ? When did I become one of  urlLink Atrios ' more regular readers? Why have I developed a morbid fascination with how many coalition soldiers have been  urlLink killed in Iraq  (this goes beyond my minor number fetish)? Do you too keep up with the blogging of  urlLink Tom Tomorrow  (if you don't, definitely read his  urlLink archived  comics)? This reading comes at the expense of reading  urlLink more   urlLink interesting   urlLink things , unless I spend way too much time online. Frell, I even  urlLink play / urlLink watch   urlLink way   urlLink too   urlLink many   urlLink flash   urlLink games . And how did I forget  urlLink this , of all things, when making these links the first time?! If you have got past level 22, let me know.   When I was thinking of what exactly  urlLink Whoopi 's joke about Bush might have been, the words " Animated Merkin " popped into my head. And I laughed! I don't know if anyone else has come up with this, and I am certainly not going to google for it, but if you know of anything, or are willing to look at a lot of  unrelated  merkin websites, let me know.   In other news, I discovered while reading Karen Elizabeth Gordon's  urlLink  The Well-Tempered Sentence  , that you don't need to use a question mark following a rhetorical question. She also agrees with me (and  urlLink Lynne Truss ;&nbsp; warning: questionable punctuation game) about the proper placement of punctuation as concerns quotation marks. And even though   Hmm. I saved this as a draft yesterday, no, the day before (umm, no), but apparently something got lost. I have no idea what I was going to write after that. Oh well. Hmm, I have a vague memory of leaving the entry unfinished like that, believing that I couldn't forget what came next. This memory may well be just one of those false beliefs the brain generates to make reality easier.  I'd link to something brain-y and psychological/neurological, but you know all about that, right? Well, there are a lot of false beliefs people have about the brain and consciousness. Do I really want to get into it? I don't feel like playing a flash game, so maybe I will.  First though, I will eat supper. Yes, I know that it is 10:40, but I am making a mix tape for work using songs I like from all my old  urlLink CMJ  CDs. Time consuming, listening to so many okay songs. So far I've only collected Elliott Smith, the Eels, and Amon Tobin.  And like, this is a week later. That brain stuff is going to have to wait. Why do I not post more often? cause I suck? do I care?  If you care about the line-up of the mix tape, email me. I finished it today, and called it  Days of Sadness and Medication . There is some stuff on there I am totally unfamiliar with, but kinda like.&nbsp; Who are "Essex Green", and "My Favorite"? I guess I'll learn in a few days, thanks to  urlLink Last.fm , your personal radio station (audioscrobbler fans should get excited, but not too much).  -Starcat, uneasy without U.

      Currently I have no cable TV. This isn't really all that bad, since the only show I really watch is The Daily Show, and CTV airs that. Oh, and Jeopardy, occasionally (even now that Ken is on his 36th win; you'd think that I'd tune in more often just so I wouldn't miss that moment of pop culture that will be him losing, but no). Even when I had cable, I discovered that I was watching not much more than music videos, terrible movies (especially the really bad ones, like crack they were to me - I watched Mangler 2, twice), and commercials.   I love commercials. What's not to like, really. They are generally more arty than anything else on TV, non-linear seems to be in, I love guessing what product is being shilled (I am scarily good at this, though I have a sneaking suspicion that many of us are), and they are one of only a few mainstream outlets to hear new, good music (now that I don't have cable, maybe the only one; the two others before were the WB and the Wedge on Much). Oh, and I almost forgot about all the sexy people (how could I have forgotten about the sex?).   There are bad commercials, though, and these come in two kinds* (well, if I stopped to think about this, there are probably more, but whatever. And a special category is reserved for Mel Farr, Superstar). The first is the kind that makes you shake your head and compose a better ad on the spot. We've all done this, and it doesn't take a marketing degree to add vitality and surprise to a bland commercial (I really am thinking about changing jobs, my virtual portfolio will make you laugh, I swear).   The second kind of bad commercial I despise; it is so bad you have to change the channel when it begins, or else risk contamination. These ads are almost always local, and manage to be simultaneously boring and irritating, devoid of any creativity, and are generally insultingly terrible. Dating service commercials also fit in here, as there aren't any sexy singles waiting for my call at midnight on a Wednesday in my city, and if there are, how lame for them. Which brings me back to the start: during the Daily Show, which is on at midnight in my time zone, there are very, very terrible local ads, and I am shuddering just thinking about them. No, I won't mention them, but if you are from around here you probably know which I am talking about.   Now, when you have cable, and a bad ad comes on, changing the channel is a wonderful option; almost too wonderful for me, as I am a typical male who channel surfs rather well, and sometimes forget to come back to the show I was originally watching. When you don't have cable, you don't have this option. Yet you must still change the channels, and simply must bear the brunt of what you find. At midnight, there are only two other channels (a fourth channel just does not come in at night on the rabbit ears). They are both CBC, and one is in English, and one is in French. Which brings me to my beef:   CBC, what is up with your late night movie language policy? The following happens practically every night: On the English channel, a French movie will be playing, with subtitles; on the French channel, an English movie will be playing,  dubbed  into French.  WTF!!    I don't have a problem with French, or with the French channel (some of my friends are French..., ha!), it's just that I don't know it that well, despite a minimal desire to learn (cause I actually do have French friends). I appreciate that CBC is playing French movies, and I love that they are subtitled, because I hate dubbing: this is beside the point. CBC programmers, why can't you put the English movie on the English channel and the French one on the French channel? Most of us have closed captioning if we want the appropriate subtitles. Or, somewhat easier, maybe: Don't dub the English movie, just subtitle it into French; this will not only preserve whatever "education" goals you had in mind, but will extend them to the realm of teaching French spelling to the anglophones.   I know return you to your regularly scheduled programming.     *You've probably heard this one, which is why it's at the bottom: There are only two kinds of people in the world, those who think there are two kinds of people, and those who don't. Whenever I hear "there are two kinds...", this automatically pops in my head, and invariably pops out of my mouth. Sometimes I sex it up by sounding like Dorothy Parker, but this works better when I am drunk.

       Except this blogger account isn't so nice. How come I can't fucking cut and paste any more? What the frell is going on? ah. If I click on the "edit html", then it will let me do the simplest of things. at least it wasn't complicated or anything. But seriously, why have the default mode be one wherein you can't paste-in information from elsewhere?    Anyways.   Because ads are so pervasive, and so always on the right in that easy to ignore column, I never look at that column, even when it isn't ads (except if it is flashing at me, but this just makes me want to go all Unibomber on their ass). Except today, in my gmail inbox. Now, when gmail first came out, there was many an angered grunting at the way google was going to "read" the content of your email to glean your interests for targeted advertising. I said: Awesome! finally, relevant ads; goddness knows that I am tired of ads that are trying to date me, sell me cars, etc.    But did I believe that this would be so? How much did I need to email before the content filters would feel confident enough to stop selling me sex and cars? (I know tonite she comes...)   Well, it turns out to be not that much. I have only been using my gmail account for about 5 days, but the ads to the right were right on the money (is there a pun here? sorry if you see one). They are trying to sell me music, and not just any music, but good indie music.   Not that music has to be "indie" to be good. In fact, I'm not really sure what "indie" means. Something like: interesting, different, eclectic, lo-fi, low budget. If google lets me know about a band signing to Barsuk, does that mean that the band in question, and the label, can no longer be "indie"? Whatever, I'm not interested at all in Indie politics or concerns. I just want to listen to good music.    And my emails reflect this. As I climb out of the seemingly endless hole that was my musical ignorance (recent acquisitions: Raising the Fawn -   the North Sea  ; A.C. Newman -   the slow wonder  ; Mission of Burma -   onoffon  ; King Cobb Steelie -   destroy all codes  ), I find that a fair chunk of my correspondence is about what music we are listening to (bands I need to listen to: the Fiery Furnaces, Ugly Casanova, the Books). And over on the right, when gmail saw fit to advertise, there were three ads for interesting music websites. I happened to have all three bookmarked already, so they weren't particularly useful, but it was thrilling to have reality vindicate my earlier snarkiness.    Yeah! for relevant ads.

      I went on a music purchasing binge the last few weeks.  I've drastically cut down on my liquid medication bill, so I had to waste my "extra" money on something... Purchases include: The Apples in Stereo - Velocity of Sound; The Walkmen -  urlLink Bows and Arrows ; Yo La Tengo - I can hear the heart beating as one; The Clash - London Calling; The Flaming Lips -  urlLink The Soft Bulletin ; Wilco - a ghost is born; and you will know us by the trail of dead - source tags and codes; Tragically Hip - In between evolution; The Cure - s/t. Some pleasures here, some disappointments.  The new Hip album is one of the disappointments, there doesn't seem to be anything that immediately catches my attention, just a lot of rock sounding music. Like most albums, I'll have to give it the six listen judgement, but I'd caution people to stay away from it.  The same goes for the new Cure album.  There are a few good songs, but absolutely no new ground is covered, and there are no songs with that wonderful pop hook they did so well in the 80s.  And Robert, can you please stop writing songs about how you feel so fucking sorry for yourself? These are the moments when you are at your most trite. The Clash, Yo La Tengo, trail of dead, and the Lips are albums I've wanted for a while but haven't had the opportunity until now to pick up.  I'm currently listening to the Walkmen.  Did they have a song on a car commercial?  The singer's voice sounds familiar. I first heard them on the mixed CD that came with the special music issue of the  urlLink Believer .  I could look it up, I suppose, but I'm too lazy right now. Okay, I looked it up, and the song was "We've been had" from  Everyone Who Pretended To Like Me Is Gone , the commercial for  urlLink S  urlLink a  urlLink t  urlLink u  urlLink r  urlLink n  (this planet, it has rings? hmm). Apples in Stereo I picked up because they are on the Elephant 6 label, home to Neutral Milk Hotel (enough of which lately I can not get).  This one is quite good, but I have not the skill to tell you what it sounds like, as "hard-edged, fuzz guitar sugary pop" is not really anywhere close. Oh, and the new Wilco album is amazing.   Ah, sweet work-filled weekend, how will I find time to sleep?
