      The harsh western winds beat at my face, a cold and bitter sting left on my skin. Here I hang on the edge of a cliff, swaying slightly with the wind, looking occasionally down to the blank depth below me. The ground is so exceedingly far below me that the colors of the landscape twist and turn, blurred into a marred image of the desert I have traveled and loved. The arms beside me are burned with dried blood from my callused, cracked hands, and I feel weak and empty. That drive to fight for what my life has become has leaked out of my being and slowly dripped to the dust below, the fervent will to survive has slowly left me as I become more and more tired and as my body seems to grow heavier and heavier. I came to be here because I had grown to despise the dank landscape behind me, yet I refuse to fall because I can't quite see the world below.   This is one place you can not stay. Eventually you will have to either crawl back on to the ground above you, the monotonous existence serving as the usurper of a life once vibrant, or you will have to fall and give your self to the land below.  Yesterday I fell.   My grasp relented, my stubbornness and intractability to move finally thwarted by the nature of life. I shed my masks, my facades, the costumes that have become my person; I stepped out of these self-made beauties.  And yet, it was not a loss. I had not given up to see my opponent laugh and fly with victory, I had simply made a move I had lusted after and feared for a long time. I allowed my body to jerk limp, thrusting my self into the cavernous space below me, twisting and turning. The wind blows against my bare back, beating me as I grow faster and faster until I reach terminal velocity and simply fall. I am terrified but free, scared but ecstatic to move my hands and arms and feel the beautiful elation that comes with change.   My release is anything but glorious, however; my eyes are drained and the vivacity that has possessed my face for so long is no longer present. I haven't been sure of my surroundings since I told my mother that I have been seeing Elisse and that I wasn't going to stop just because she used to be bi (or whatever). I haven't felt stable or secure since I told her that she had given up so much for a life I don't respect or enjoy, since I told her that I'm not sure I wish to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. My passion is this doctrine, this philosophy, the leaders and the community, but I cannot bear the sight of what my family has done for it. I could never live for this the way they do, I could never bear such unhappiness in the name of service. I love her and I quake in the sight of her ability to be truly selfless and live for her children, her family. I see the wisdom in her rules, in her kindness, in her passions, but I don't know if I want to live in Utah anymore. I don’t know if I want to live with her anymore. I don't wish to play for those at school that I work so hard to convince; I will not create for them. I create for no one.  I create for no one. I write for no one. I live for no one but myself.  Breath has never been this satisfying; the pain induced by this icy wind has never been more bittersweet upon my lips. The freedom to relax and to lie limp is mine, as I fall I can move in ways I never have before. My body, however, is still as lifeless as before, my eyes still tired and apathetic, glazed and fatigued. Even with this change, I am not excited, just curious: curious to see where I fall.

      Ok- my blog is being a little slut. My life in general is being a little slut. My day sucked. It wasn't mediocre, it wasn't horrendously tragic, it just sucked. And to me, that is the worst type of day. Other than the fact that I had to close tonight and I sat my servers terribly, nothing happened. Elisse and her absolutely adorable grandpa came to dine at OSF, so I chatted with them for a couple of minutes. She really cheered me up, even though the fact that she knew more people in the OSF establishment than I did was slightly depressing. Tomorrow I'm going to go meet her at the main library to set off and see her apartment. It's probably amazingly adorable, and I'll probably be sick with envy. At least I know what to expect from myself.  My life is such a little slut right now. It's not even on one side of the spectrum like my experiences usually are, due to the fact that I'm somewhat manic depressive. There isn't an extreme to feed off of; there is no emotion to sustain me. I can't delight in the purity of the black or white before me because the walls rising above my vision are gray. The dullest, thoughtless gray. This feeling swirls about me, enrapturing me, neither smooth like marble nor coarse like rough-cut granite. There's no word to define this, there aren't any distinctive characteristics or connotations to explain this, it's just present.  Such a little slut. Right now I just can't be happy with anything. After raising my pay, my manager sees that I don't care. What am I going to do with more money? It will all go towards college in the end. While trying to hit on me at work, two guys see that my apathy is not to be trifled with. I remain un-flattered, yet not disgusted. Do what you want. I'm going to bed in half an hour, and that's pretty much all I care about, because this world is a whore; A bleach-blonde tease, with a heaving inflated chest, so despicable and openly undesirable, yet craved by anyone belonging to this society.  And then I get home to see that, after spending all that freaking time on this stupid blog, it is being a little slut. If I have nothing, however, at least I have consistency.   Oh well. I comforted by that fact that I don't have to stop complaining. I don't have to cease my pathetic whining, because this is my blog and my thoughts are my thoughts. I plan to utilize this is every way possible.   I really think I need a shrink; not because I'm worried that I might just be seriously messed, although this might very well be the case, but because I think everybody needs professional help. A therapist is not for the insane alone, but for those refusing to settle with mental mediocrity.   Wow. I'm listening to a song by Sneaker Pimps, and it's pretty twisted. "spin spin sugar", said in a very odd tone, is repeated again and again to a retro beat. Why not? I finally got the song I wanted- sneaker pimps, 6 underground. This made me happy, considering how long I've tried to get a hold of that song. Now all I have to do is find out what was playing at Dior's spring/summer 2004 RTW and I'll be set. The last song of the show was totally post, I have to get a hold of it. I've researched this, but I can't seem to find it. Frustrating, to say the least.   I'm kind of worried. My little brother, Ricky, is turning into a punk. He's hanging out with these idiots that I don't trust. They stole some kid's scooter at school on Wed, and I'm getting pissed off. He's not going to turn into some mindless, impudent, scooter-stealing delinquent. He's too much of a sweetheart. He's having a big slumber party right now and him and his band of miscreants just snuck out to go toilet-papering. As if I don't know. Grow up Ricky, just grow up. The process of maturing is over rated, just get it over with.   I'm in a repulsive mood. I'm going to go eat toast.

      I had an extremely uneventful day today. Feeling fully recovered from last night, I got up and did nothing. I took a shower, read the paper, had some herbal tea. I was lounging until 10:30, when I decided to call Elisse. We chatted about going to brunch for some time before my mother came home and I was forced to hang up on her. Even though the occurrence was, hopefully, understood by the gal on the other side of the wire, I can't do such a thing without feeling an overwhelming sense of barbarianism. I feel so unrefined, so rough.   Walking through the hallway, my mom announced we were going shopping for Rosenthal Crystal. After going to 3 of the finest boutiques downtown, we discovered 1 pattern. Anything else, the crystal people told us, would have to be found in Chicago or New York. The whole valley of Salt Lake contains 1 pattern of Rosenthal Crystal. How depressing.   We found  urlLink Francis I  by Reed and Barton, though. Exquisite in every sense. While dining with such flat wear, one hardly needs tasty food. Food isn't needed at all, really; the fruit and blossoms folding around and over your salad fork creates an artistic meal in itself. This is what my family will dine off of, only grandiose subtlety such as this will touch the lips of my child. And averaging $87.00 a fork, I suppose I'll have some bratty kids.  Guess who doesn't want to go to work? Me!! I really don't want to. Travis is going to be in a bad mood tonight; the manager finally told him he couldn't work at the OSF anymore if he didn't dye his hair. He had bright blonde highlights that, I'll admit, looked a little gay- but he is gay, so it works. But not to our manager, so He's making Travis go back to his salon and pay another $65 to get it un-done. Poor Travis. Poor, poor gay Travis. He's so discriminated against. Why?  Oh- I found a cute gray wool duster for $4.99 at Meyer and Frank. I don't know why my mom thinks I spend too much money; I know how to shop around and do so whenever possible. It's incredibly adorable, I'm excited to wear it.   I think I shall go begrudgingly get ready for work. At least I can wear my new duster on the way to work. That's no consolation, though, mind you.

      I am becoming more computer literate with each passing minute! I have links now, and my text isn't centered like some stupid whore. I'm so happy. And it's orange, so orange. Trendy, I know, but mod in a sense, and I love mod. Huzzah.   So I guess all the computer-savvy readers that don't read my blog won't have to help me after all. Pretty cool, huh?   I'm going over to Jane's in 25 minutes. Apparently this red-head diety is at her house that I simply have to meet. It's nice being with Jane again, although she's going through serious family problems. Yes, her family is messed up, but they've never even began to challenge Jane's insanity. I suppose that's why I love her. I really don't feel that well, so I'll make an appearance and then make her drive me home in 45 minutes. Muhai!  My Enzio Angiolini bag is due any day now. My blog doesn't look stupid, only a tad bit typical (a fact I can live with), I didn't have to work tonight, and I got out of hanging out with Amy Jo, Jamie, and Parker.   Life is good.

      So I did it. I converted to a trendy but, you have to admit, adorable blog. Even though it does have "XXX" at the top and this is most likely the most innocent blog on the internet, I still adore it. It reminds me of oranges, and I like oranges. In fact, I'm somewhat obsessed with the happy fruit.  Anyway...one flaw. I'm sure you've noticed. The text is centered. CENTERED! It almost leaves a bad taste in your mouth after reading the blog. It won't work, but I don't know how to change it. Why? Because I'm incompetent in every way, shape and form computer-wise, and clicking the template button scares me. It really does. So, I need help from all my computer-savvy readers, even though nobody reads my blog. How do I un-center this template and redeem this atrocity?

      This is so freaking cool. I finally managed to alter my link list in such a fashion that it now says something other than Edit me. Huzzah!   Not only that, but I just realized I have spell check, a bold icon,  and   an italic icon available while posting. This is a big day for me.

      There's something extraordinarily releasing about paying your library fines. Perhaps because they are the least pressing of all fines the thought of them slides to the very back of one's brain. There they lie, quietly chanting their existence, so quiet the sound is easy to drown but never forgotten. Their reminder, however, is so rhythmic and so steady that your overdue library fines seem to dive underneath your skin, spreading throughout the body fluidly and evenly, demoralizing your existence and lessening you as a person. The quiet simplicity of the library ordeal is so unique that it simply will not stand to be left unpaid, so it proceeds to even the debt by robbing one of integrity and decency. There's not a creature lower than the non-library-fines-payer. The situation is so universally despicable, it's almost an adjective. "What's she like?” "Oh, she's the type that racks up library fees and doesn't pay them". Disgusting, I tell you. They take the one aspect of this society that doesn't seem to be driven by blatant consumerism and denies the foundation of the few rights a library is entitled to, simply because this squalid individual can. The act of refusing to pay a library fine is an unconscious indolence that is simultaneously so deliberate it borders on racism. The characteristics of a library define it as an edifice much different than a store or shop; its impetus is education, its tool kindness. It is true that, when unsuccessful, this kindness morphs into harassment through mail and the phone so severe the inhumanity can be sickening, I will not deny this. This is not a battle, however, but a crusade. Not an effort for the presidents and founders to reach the top of the monetary hierarchy, but an attempt to elevate society through schooling and intellectual edification. It is a race against decadence, one of the last hopes for our race. Join us! Release yourself and fight for the cause! PAY YOUR FINES! FOR THE LOVE OF HEAVEN AND ALL THAT IS HOLY, PAY THE FREAKING FEES!  I just did. Thirty-two hundred, forty three cents to this noble foundation. I could have blown it on a shirt, and waited until the Anderson-Foothill library dispatched their lawyers and mercenaries to make me give what I owe. But I did not. I walked right up to that library and slapped the currency down on the desk. I will be bound no more! I will not live for this, this momentarily enthralling procrastination. How sweet the liberation, how seductive this new-found deliverance is on my lips, in my soul, in my body, filling every cavity and organ. It's beautiful.  Anyway, play practice was fun today. I'm just enjoying my character so very much. I'm acting with John, too, and he is such a sweetie. Today Elisse was kind enough to inform me that my "husband" actually has no charm, and I'm silly for thinking this. Clearly she has no experience looking from the modeling perspective (considering this guy looks exactly like Julien Hedquist), but feels the right to correct my opinion all the same. But apparently she does know him from debate, so I'm stupid for not letting her aristocratic biases rule my judgment. I mean, what's wrong with me? Even though she does have my blog address, I'm not going to censor this. I do not write for her, or anybody else.   Tonight Jane and I might go see "girl with the Pearl Earring". I don't like Scarlet Johansson, but the movie's supposed to be good. We'll see; walking home in the rain wasn't the best thing for my head cold, and I'm beginning to feel slightly dotty (hence the pontification above).  Speaking of dotty, I talked with the bat today. She bounced up to me, clearly very excited. Upon inquiring about her cheerful demeanor, she informed me that she had a joke to tell me. Truthfully, I was intrigued. The bat usually doesn't leave her cave, especially for something like this. The women is surprisingly unpredictable, considering her current life consists of three basic activities (eating, sleeping, and staring into the abyss with her mouth open, slightly sagging to the left of her face). So she tells me:  "I heard this funny on the Carolyn Rhea show.” (I thought the word “funny” was an adjective. I must have been wrong.) “So a man is sitting at the dinner table eating with his son. He asks his son, who was raised in the city “do you know what a pig is?”. So he went in another room, then the secretary turned to the cat and said, “Only during coffee break”.”     She giggled and sputtered for about half a minute before realizing my face was one of worry, not the amused gaiety she apparently had expected.  I don’t get it, I said  “Well, I had to leave some of it out. Some of the joke was inappropriate, and not for the ears of a child.” She said this smugly, as if the pieces of the joke that together formed the meaning were all secrets that she would guard valiantly till death (which, I swear, will be any minute now. I don’t know what sustains her, I really don’t).  After saying this, she sighed, and then shuffled back to her room. What would my life be without the bat?  I don’t know why so many of us hide behind the sensational daydream that is sanity. The bat is perfectly fine without such balderdash. Perhaps that’s what nourishes this woman, the sheer fact that she is possibly one of the barmiest people alive. How philosophical.  Well, I’m going to go see what I’m doing tonight. I don’t know if I’m up to a movie, I’m feeling progressively worse. Maybe I’ll just curl up with a cup of tea and some crumb cake, and watch the news. I feel severely uninformed, perhaps I’ll do that. We’ll see.  But I haven’t yet told you, my dearest reader, about my day. I shall do this before I depart. Let me see, I:  1.	Took a Spanish test, which I’m quite sure I failed. The imperfect and preterit tense? What is this twaddle? I shan’t bother with it a moment longer. 2.	Skipped seminary to type up a resume for an interview that, I found out shortly after, was not today. 3.	I worked on my poetry only to have Elisse eventually do it for me. 4.	Went to Tesoro and bought a preposterous amount of junk food, only to share it with Frank the debate coach, who has dangerously high cholesterol. 5.	Went to Physics and decided that New Zealand is one of the most adorable people in the High School. The heroine and cruel behavior details only make him sexier. 6.	Went to play practice. Clearly the fate of a pill-popping perfectionist is the one for me; I’m perfect at this. I’m so excited! 7.	Traveled to the library, payed my dues and went shopping. 8.	Came home and blogged.  I know- I’m thrilled to have such an eventful life, too. Farewell, dearest reader. I’m off for a long weekend. Whoopee!

      I am so excited! My ward's murder mystery night is tonight. I am going as Baroness Crustia Von Pepperoni- heiress of a vast instant-pizza fortune. How spectacular that would be.  So it turns out that New Zealand is a heroine whore that likes to take advantage of women. So, of course, I am that much more intrigued. I never claimed sanity, why would I now? I despise such an illusion.   Well, I have homework to do today, and preparation for the dinner. Elise also gave me her blog address, and I'm afraid the reading of the precious manuscript will occupy my blog-writing time for today.  Farewell, dearest reader.

      After Physics, New Zealand and I are walking down the C floor:  NZ: "So, I got a lead in one of the plays."  Me: "Really? Fabulous. Who do you play?"  NZ: "(Name of some character), he's a pirate."  Me: "That's awesome. Pirates are sexy." (There you have it. The first of many phrases telling him he's sexy. I was rather surprised, really. I never thought I'd tell him that.)  NZ: "Pirates aren't sexy!"  Me: "I beg to differ; you clearly have never seen Pirates of the Caribbean."  NZ: "Ahh..."  Me: "Johnny Depp has some major sex appeal. He has my permission to shove me into a janitor's closet and do what he wishes."  NZ: "Really?" (Somewhat surprised, also. I've never been this open or nice to him; I'm typically very, very, very unapproachable. That's the way I usually prefer it.) "But I could never be that sexy."  *this is where I became a little irritated. He knew exactly what was coming. He knew it! He knew it, and in my moment of flustered weakness he made me confess! It was completely intentional, I could sense it. He knew exactly what I was going to say, and loved every second of it!  Me: "Actually, one of my friends and I were talking about you the other day. If we slapped some Gucci onto you, there would be some major sexiness going on."  THERE! I SAID IT, AND BECAME REDDER WITH EVERY STRAINED SYLLABOL! Are islanders always this cruel? I hated this loss of control. I was in control of what I was saying, and I could have agreed with the lie that I don't think he's sexy. Of course I could of, but it was as if I had a duty to him to tell him this. So in silent yet vocalized compliance I performed, defenseless and vulnerable. This isn't me; I should be manipulating, lying, destroying, plowing my way to what I want. What is this madness? This will never work.  I now hate New Zealand. I have a duty to no one, especially a male that at one point in time liked me. Nobody owns me, controls me, there is no one I am in debt to.    You know, when I'm too emotionally involved or flustered, I'm afraid I don't write well. We'll have to change the subject...  So I go the lead role in one of the 5 plays. It turns out I am the new Psycho mom for "mother's party". I landed a killer part, and cannot wait. The reading today went wonderfully, and it turns out my husband in the play is charming, too. Scruffy, can't dress, needs to shave, but has endless potential. Why am I so drawn to this type? It must be the need I feel to save the world, one un-bathed scruffian at a time. Hence New Zealand, I suppose. My husband, I forgot his name, has amazing facial structure, pretty eyes, and perfect skin (of course). He's a drama guy, though, which pretty much sums up his personality; crazy, tactless, odd, yet sweet and charming. All I need to do is GQ him, and all will be well.   Dang. I'm such a relentless flirt. Dearest reader, you have no idea. It doesn't matter- man or woman, beautiful or decrepit, rich or, (well, in this case, wealth does affect my ability to butter-up others), but it doesn't matter much. Maybe there is some truth in this "You led me on and manipulated me" rubbish I hear so often. No matter- I can just deny this until I score a rich 80 year old.  And yet I can't attract anyone decent. I suppose this does synchronize with the other bitter ironies that are my life, but I can't just accept this. Honestly, this isn't going to work. The men (or women) that are attracted to me fall into the three following categories:  1. Sweet and considerate, yet not pretty or suave. (Ex: Drama guy. New Zealand [he’s pretty and suave in his own way, but not polished]) 2. Beautiful and suave, but always have the following two flaws in common:             I. Usually claiming an IQ equivalent to that of a soap dish or lower             II. Sees my body as a stand with a large banner stating "Get sex here". (Ex: Kuy [you'll get to know him later], Sexy idiot that models with me at my agency, The Russian I met in June, etc.) 3. Adores me to no end, and I adore them also, but I am at a position in which it simply is not possible in any form or way. With my mother, it is quite easy to have people fall into this category. (Ex: Kyle, Thomas, and one person in particular that I'm afraid I can't mention, just incase my mom hears me thinking it. [as she is so prone to doing])  Because no person falling in any of these categories is even seen as playing ground in my eyes, I'm completely out of luck. I'm not too happy about this; I do, after all, desire to get married someday. And since I'm sticking to this whole chastity thing, It looks like I'll be a virgin serving Vestia unless my luck changes. And if I'm not still beautiful when my luck finally does decide to change, I'll still be a virgin serving Vestia my entire life. Rather bleak, wouldn't you say?  I have a trig test tomorrow, though I really don't want to study (a new emotion, I know). I'm also cooking dinner tonight, so I must get started on that. Farewell, dear reader. Please don’t become sickened by this pity party I decided to have. At least I invited you in some way or another…

      I've just returned from auditioning for Take 5 at school. It's a series of 5 plays written by alumni and students; I know two of the authors. I've always marveled at the fact that I'm not a thespian. I'm dramatic and tend to be attracted to these type of people. but I've never merged with them. I'm very disappointed with high school actors when they come together; collectively, I can't stand the people. People present laughed at everything, EVERYTHING. The majority of these occurrences and comments not being remotely humorous in nature, one can see that the laughers were laughing simply because the director wanted them to laugh. Not because of the script or anything, it felt as if the directors existed off the power of being able to control the facial muscles in the majority of those present. I was extremely vexed.  I think I did well, however. I was asked to read the part of a pill-popping house wife that finally explodes, and I think I was cut out for the part. Explode I did; screaming, ranting, violent hand gestures, the works. It was quite therapeutic. Due to a shortage of time, however, I was unable to read two parts I was eyeing in two different plays. I was so very frustrated! I knew exactly what I was going to do, say, and laugh at, but I suppose it's not my loss. I doubt I'll be casted (well, actually I think I will be, but I say this so that I can pretend to not be disappointed if I'm not casted. Absence of expectation is my favorite situation; If I attain what I want, I'm the incredible youth that simply doesn't realize her talent, if I don't attain what I want, then I'm the incredible youth that's simply must be incredible in another area because of my unrivaled apathy. No, I'm not mind-blowingly defensive, don't be silly. I think I'll be casted, also, because of Robbie. He used to like my in some year, until he realized I was far out of his reach and became very bitter towards me. Elisse thinks he still likes me, and I don't doubt it. I am a sexy beast, after all)  So postings go up tomorrow. If I make it, great, if not, less work for me to do. Huzzah!   So I've discovered another reason why I hate life. There's this absolutely beautiful New Zealander in my physics class that auditioned today. He has this incredible olive skin and these black eyes that I just can't look at without imagining what it would be like to swim in them. He also wears eye liner. He's gorgeous and just barely taller that me, which means that I tower over him when I'm wearing heels. So of course, he has to be gothic. Or an anarchist- I don't know. He has a Mohawk and wears Army boots with capri-thingies and flannel. DANG IT!!! I just want to shout at him- buzz off that protrusion on your head, wear those wire-rimmed glasses I saw on you once, take a glance at the latest GQ, and I will let you push me against a wall. Until, of course, my dominant side bursts out of my oh-so-calm demeanor and then I push you against a wall. But no- he's has to wear the flannel. And those boots! Why, oh why? Add to my lists of vices: this goth in Armani. He would be dangerous, so I guess that he's best in his cut off capris. *sniffs*    I can't even flirt with him in physics, though. I sit with these preppy prats that dislike him, and if they aren't there for me to cheat off of, then I won't get an A. They're also the group the TA in my trig class hangs out with, and she's the reason I'm getting an A in trig. One of their groupies is also dating the guy I cook with in foods, who makes the class semi-bearable. Their parent group are the only people I have to talk to in choir, and a member of that parent group covers for me everyday in AP History. They are the sole reason I have a 3.8 and I only do work in English. Connections are everything, love.    I don't really care, I'd get along without them; I'm just lazy. Sure, I could branch off and be "freed" from the chain of social obligations I have, but what would that be teaching me for my life in the near future? One must keep up appearances you know...  This entry has just become ranting and blabber. Hopefully this ranting and blabber is entertaining or something, because it's helping me think. I had no idea I really want to jump New Zealand before now. Interesting, isn't it?   My mother is screaming at Rob, my older brother, in the other room. Before this annoyed me, but I have a new-found appreciation for that gal; if it wasn't for her, I wouldn't have done so well today in my pill-popper breakdown audition. Everything serves a purpose, I guess.   Maybe I should give New Zealand my blog address. He would find out that I want him to go GQ, and he would do it because it's a really, really good idea. A hysterically good idea. He's so pretty. I'm also sure that he would get past this whole "I love blood" phase. I did, and I was very sadistic. I suppose I am still, but in a sense much crueler and colder that the physical. Perhaps he'll become the same way, and we can play mind games all the day long. Whoopee!    I've chatted a lot about nothing, glancing over every three minutes or so at the huge pile of work I have to do for English. I think I'll get started that and leave Elisse rolling on the floor after reading this entry. I'm so predictable, I know. Oh- I really want to see her apartment. Saturday would be good for me because I'm not working until 5 but I could tell my mom that I am. Call me.

      I got back from the University's fireside about 30 minutes ago. I loved it; the music was phenomenal. I was truly impressed by the choir and the orchestra, and the spirit was extremely strong. I'm glad I went.  I went with Angie and Bree, two lead hostesses from work. How refreshing it is to be around some semi-mature people compared to those at school. I'm so sick of high school- I am happy that I'm graduating early.   The weather outside is still cold, although slowly warming. Soon the snow will flee, and Salt Lake will give birth to the beauty that can only be seen in a desert. The colors will burst with strength hidden by the delicate shapes of the petals and leaves, the lovely desert grasses will be seen once again. The scents and smells will ride the wind, so potent one can almost see swirls of pink and purple perfume dancing on the planes of the breeze, filling the air gloriously with the triumph of the season. On the wings of the sweetest note will spring flutter onto the horizon any week now.  How enthralling anticipation is.

      One of the things that I don't understand in life is why my grandma is still alive. After a multitude of serious health problems, surgeries, and recoveries, the gal is still up and kicking; she’s 67 and alive, although she has become incredibly senile in a short span of time. Mormor (grandma in Norwegian) lives with us, and she has for four years. I don't know her real name; ever since I was born she was Mormor to me and everybody around me. The woman has lived an explosive, irresponsible scandal of a life, and is now suffering the consequences thereof. I understand the bond between us, but I don't love her. She's a barmy old bat that demands respect bordering on reverence which she simply hasn't earned. I don't know why being decrepit is reason enough for respect; perhaps it's some sort of consolation for the deteriorating of one's body. Well, I think she should die soon. I swear, one more sickness or problem will do the trick, I'm sure it will come anytime soon. Then, you see, we could have our downstairs den back that has become her bedroom, her bathroom, and the statuettes and luxurious knickknacks she blew her money on when she was wealthy back in the 60s. I don't think the bat is attached to life anymore, considering that hers consists mainly of sitting on the couch with her shifty eyes, staring at the dog. Boris the dog is just as old, so he lays on the floor with his shifty eyes, staring at the bat. It's a vicious cycle, I know. At least boris is cute in his feeble, venerable way; he'll see you when you come home and wait 3 seconds before lugging his tail up in the air and letting it plop back on the floor with a loud smack. He doesn't run, he barely walks, and his two goals in life are the following: 1. acquire food of any type, shape, and edibility. 2. Imitate a rug.  He's a pro at both activities listed above, so he must be very satisfied with himself, even though the bat swears up and down that he's depressed and needs Valium. I've decided I like boris as long as he's not in my way, and I've decided I dislike the bat as long as she's within view. This might seem heartless, I know, but the Bat would understand. She hates my aunt Susan for not going to prom with her best friend's nephew; she hasn't sent Susan or her offspring a Christmas gift since the ordeal in 1982 and reminds the family about it incessantly.   I come from a very interesting family. The strange thing is that my family in Norway, my dear relatives that pretty much don’t  believe in clothing during summer months, are the normal ones. My insanity is completely and wholly justified.

      Every time I get off of work I walk down to the lower level of the mall to call for a ride home. I wait on the same bench everyday, staring off into the abyss in the same, empty way. Approximately 8 feet in front of my bench is a display window for Williams Sonoma, displaying the latest nostalgic electric beater or steel fondue pot. The displays change with the season, from Christmas to Valentines and then to Asian cooking in between holidays. For some reason I find this incredibly insulting, how the last month we all just scraped through is represented by a pot designed to melt cheese, how the absolute kitchen must-haves change every time they decide to alter that display window. One could never have a complete kitchen; a new must is named every month as an essential to the well-rounded kitchen. Who do these people think they are? Someday I'll march into Williams Sonoma and remove everything from that stupid display window. I'll toss the heart-shaped cupcake molds, chuck the sea-green blenders, I'll take everything. The colorful posters, the lights, the antique table holding the treasures of the store. Then I'll leave the store and sit on my bench, staring into the pure emptiness of that window that once demanded so much of the owner of a well-rounded kitchen. There will be no must-haves, no handy knickknacks, no bright posters telling me why my kitchen isn't complete. Then there will be nothing I need.

      I really would like to study in Europe for graduate school. They have so many fabulous schools of architecture, I'd really adore studying there. Well, in four years we'll see, I guess.  I don't want to go to work today. I never do, but especially when I'm working a double on Saturday. Good new, though; we have a new hostess. I'm no longer the newbie and can give advice to her like I know the ropes. I'm so thrilled! She's shy and really reserved, and I think she's scared by some of the more, er, outgoing hostesses such as Jane. Well, everybody's afraid of Jane at one time or another. I think the new girl's name is Vicky. Pity; I've always despised that name. It just has too many hard tones in it for me.   I had the weirdest dream last night that two of the servers asked me to have a threesome with them last night. Considering I'm the youngest employee working there, it was kind of sick. It's so funny what  I dream up after surfing for an hour.  Still, I'm not going to be able to suppress a laugh when I see these servers today, though. It was a pretty awkward dream. After I turned them down, they asked a manager and then closed the upstairs of the restaurant so that they could have some privacy. I remember being so frustrated about the fact that I had no explanation for the yells coming from upstairs to give to the guests dining by the stairs on the lower level. It was a very interesting dream...  Well, look at this! According to this letter I just found by the computer I have library fines of $28.95 for books I have yet to return- and this is dated the 9th of January. I probably owe the library my first born by now. I have no idea where these books are; I haven't seen them since 2003. Well, this sucks.   I'm going to go shower now. After I surf some blogs first, I suppose. Farewell

      Well, It has been decided for me. I will marry an Italian.  Yes, I happen to be playing off false stereotypes and misconceptions birthed by the media and loved-crazed idealists. So? I see nothing wrong with that. As long as I can land myself an Italian that's tall, dark, handsome, and knows a thing or two about architecture, I'm afraid that's who I'm going to marry. It's not my fault; I've been exposed to this idea that Italians symbolize love and intimacy in every way, shape, and form. It's natural I long to push a couple against a wall.   I just finished the movie "Under the Tuscan Sun". Complete garbage, I know. The main character is supposed to be a writer and her narration throughout the movie is a sappy joke. Yeah, I know. But beautiful Italian men! Come one now, that has to count for something! That's the only good thing about the movie, but that's all I need in a film; a pseudo-plot and great angles of beautiful men (preferably Italian or French). I'm afraid this movie meets all of the tough criteria above, so I liked it. At least it persuaded me to move to a gorgeous Italian Villa and make love to even more gorgeous Italian men (which wasn't too hard, I'll admit I've never need TOO much persuasion for something like that).  Anyway, now that I've wiped the drool off of my keyboard and chin, I'll tell you about my oh-so-eventful day at work. The job of a hostess is never boring, you see. Right when you think it's become dull, BAM! You've got something new and exciting to do, like seat another table! Whoopee!  I was upstairs in the restaurant, which is preferable. It's easy to fill up and never has any annoying parties of, say, 75 people. (We had two of those yesterday. TWO!) It is, however, hard to seat the balcony, which has been appropriately named "the skinny". 20 of the tiniest tables and chairs have been crammed on the sides of an isle that, if it weren't for the 100 people dining on either side, would be considered pretty wide. But, since the builders of this fine establishment thought that this isle would make a great dining room, few people want to work up there. I myself happen to like it. If you chat and laugh with the customers all the way to the table, smile widely as you give them their menus then run away, they usually stay there, albeit somewhat begrudgingly.  I started the movie before I went to work, so I had Italy on my mind tonight. Ironically enough, I sat a party of 6 Italians right after I started working. I was a bit disappointed, I'll admit. They were old and fat, and seemed to prefer grunting to talking, which they apparently thought was very clever and appropriate. I seat them, and the lead man proceeds to violently jerk his head in a gesture that bears a faint resemblance to a nod. Is that how those in the service profession are thanked in Italy? Well, not today, Bucko; I'm afraid I have your menus. So I'm waiting for them to sit down at their table while the leader continues to perform this motion, and I start to worry. If he's unhappy now, which is what I'm going to assume he's feeling upon observing his mini-spasms, what state will he be in when he discovers what an insult our food is to Italian culture? After pondering this, I decide to pull my favorite maneuver; I drop the menus, mumble that their server will be there in a couple minutes, and flee. Let the server deal with them, I thought, I'm the one who's ridiculously underpaid. I wonder how well they tipped...  I work 11 hours tomorrow. Not too excited. In fact, I'm debating whether or not I should force myself to stay up all night watching infomercials so that they night might seem longer. That's never the best of signs; perhaps I wasn't cut out to suck up to spag-consuming imbeciles. Most elitists aren't, what can I say? My manager said I was getting a raise, so where the crap is it? $6.50 and hour is nothing less than exploitation in my book; just because the managers aren't the typical life-sucking wenches one usually sees in the world is no justification of theft. And that's what this is- robbery, pure and simple.  At least I find consolation in the fact that any time I feel bitter about my suckey job or Utah education, I can always turn to horrid, implausible chick-flicks. The world makes sense again! I did, actually, hear a great quote during this film that I don't think I'll be forgetting anytime soon:  "Why all the paperwork? You're buying a house, not a vespa."  classic. With a few lines like that and beautiful faces, it makes total sense that TV is America's hi-resolution deity. That’s not depressing at all, trust me.

      So it turns out I've been spelling Elisse's name wrong. It's so funny- I was one of the only people that knew how to spell her name, and during her banishment, I suppose I've just forgotten. I've never understood why people care anyway; if anything I'd rather people as a whole didn't know how to spell my name, so that I wouldn't cringe to think that they're debasing it every time it escapes their lips.   yhuyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyuuuuuuuuuuujuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu7yu. oops. I'm eating a Rice krispie treat right now, and I just got a krispie stuck in between the U, the Y and the H. In my attempt to retrieve the  tasty morsel, I ended up smashing it down into the belly of my horizontal friend. Man, I bet it was tasty too. I can see the remains; there they lie, mocking and taunting my desire. I suppose that's what I get for being lazy and using the puffed marshmallow crème as opposed to melting the marshmallows: a rice krispie treat that doesn't stick together and has to be eaten with a spoon. Best darn rice krispie treat I've ever eaten.  My mom's just gone to rent Under the Tuscan sun. It's supposedly a horrid plotless chick flick in which a writer goes to an exotic land and makes love the Italian men instead of working. I can't wait to see it.  Well, I don't really feel like writitng today. I feel scattered, as I'm sure some of the more observative readers are suspecting. I just realized it's the weekend, which means two steady days of working in roughly every minute of spare time I have. I closed last night, which was fun because we played pictionary on the front desk before I decided to nap on it.   I love my job...

      Today in cooking class we "cooked" microwave Mexican chip dip. This is simply too much for me; why must my entire educational career have to contain only subjects, classes, and people that incessantly point out how flawed the Utah educational system is? We have a minimum of electives we have to take so that we might become well-rounded people. Apparently nuking bastardized versions of food from other cultures is what molds American children into well-rounded, responsible adults.   Wow. America sucks.   Anyway, I nuke the insta-filler and pretend to scarf it while I sit, trying to devise a plan to discard the rubbish and save myself from developing a hatred for Mexican food. How can I save myself from these silly Americans? I'm feeling oh so patriotic today, in case you can’t tell.  So the class ends and I finally flee from the greasy purgatory foods class has become. I bump into Elise on the way to my locker, which makes my day. We were talking about this yesterday, how an intellectual begins to madly lust for intelligence if locked up in an imbecilic cage (high school) for too long. I've been so happy to see Elise lately; after my mother took a chainsaw to the extremity that had curiously joined our hips together during last year I haven't seen much of her. (That last statement is extremely funny and ironic to me because of reasons that remain unbeknownst to you, dear reader) She invited me to a play that I can't see and to a nice restaurant at which I can't dine. Why must I have a job, why?   Speaking of work, I have to do that today. At 5, or something. Actually, I have no idea, I'm just kind of guessing. In fact, I think I was supposed to work earlier this week but was too lazy to go into work and check. I might very well not have a job at this moment in time, thank heavens ignorance truly is bliss! At least I could go to the ballet Saturday, right?  So Amy, my best friend, made small-groups (part of the choir at my school). Many people yearn to be in this, um, prestigious group. It's supposed to be a lot of fun as long as you don't mind being with the chirpy drones of high school. I was going to try out until I decided to graduate early, which robs my audition of any purpose whatsoever. I could have made it; I know how to sing and enjoy the process. I guess that's just another art that these people have almost ruined for me. Luckily, I sing in the church choir, which is fun solely because of the fact that our director is a barmy old bat. I love it.  I have nothing else to write about; my day was, in retrospect, one of the most uneventful I’ve had in months. Wait! That’s not true. I read in preparation for my history exam- the very first time since the beginning of the year that I have dared to open the book. I think I did well, or better than I usually do (which isn’t too bad, surprisingly). I rushed home during 3rd because we had a sub in trig, and I studied! It doesn’t sound that impressive, but it actually is.  Well, now I have nothing to say. Other than the fact that I’m hungry and that stupid phone thing won’t stop ringing. Take that, Mr. Alexander Bell! I will not let your contraption of the devil ruin my life!  I leave you now to do some beautiful, therapeutic shopping.

      I just returned from my ward's etiquette night. The lecture was brilliant, the preparation was evident and the food was delicious, and yet I'm disappointed; even though the hard work of the leaders and guest speakers was evident, the guests were the most ungrateful swine I've ever sat next to.  I've known all these people for years, they are my friends and neighbors, they go to my school and I talk to them weekly, if not daily. They are the privileged kids of the upper-middle class/ lower-upper class rung in which i subsist; one is the son of the owners of thanksgiving point, another the daughter of the vice president of Sundance, the rest the children of prestigious lawyers and doctors. I live in the cheapest house in this neighborhood, big but old and rickety, beautiful in my eyes. I'm not one of these people; my mother is a teacher of mathematics and my father is a captain pilot for DHL.   Here these people sit before me, snubbing the gourmet our leaders worked so hard to prepare, ignore the lecturers and make fun of our "butlers".   "Is this vinaigrette on the salad? I haven't had anything but cream sauces on my salads since I was 7." "Tomato? I'm afraid I don't eat tomato. Especially fresh- no thank you, I don't think I care to try it." "Is this a blueberry on the cake?" asks a girl next to me that lives over a street from me. "Eeeeeeew, that's so disgusting." wrinkling her nose, she flicks, honestly, flicks it onto the table cloth. "Let's go to the pie pizzeria afterwards. This stuff is reasty."        "Word." Says a guy across from me to my right. Pizza? You're being served shrimp etouffee by youth group leaders and you want pizza?  Of course, after the meal they leave immediately (tucking their chairs in), and fly out to the Pie. There are 2 youth that even both to ask our leaders if they need help cleaning up or finding the Reed and Barton Francis I cutlery they can't seem to find after lending the $435-a-place-setting flatware to add a sophisticated touch to the night.   Do you see why being a mother is becoming less and less appealing to me?

      I promised myself I wouldn't post today until I have finished all my homework. Oops! I must have no integrity...   So I had lunch today with Elise. Definitely a character that needs explanation until met, at which time no explanation can be given. Luckily, I am at one of the places in my world where I need no justification to plunge into my sea of thoughts and past experiences and frolic in it like a porpoise. This is an online journal, after all. So we went down to great harvest, got some bread, sat at the porch and ate the bread. Good bread, too, but the company was indefinitely better than the past times I've been there. I think I'm finally at the place that I want to be with Elise. Now we're just like stark opposites that know every move of the person sitting across from us, so alike in every area that one can talk about, and on totally on opposite ends of the spectrum of other areas that can not be explained with a human tongue.   I gave her my blogspot address, so everybody wave. Hi Elise! Dearest little Elisie, what a doll.   Oh- I stumbled upon these yesterday while doing everything on earth other than my homework. These are the three simple reasons that Mormons and other non-users don't need to do acid:   1. http://www.ebaumsworld.com/rainbowtrip.html   2. http://www.trevorvanmeter.com/flyguy/   3. http://www.addictinggames.com/skeleton.html   I don't know if I did that right, but If I did you should check this out- pretty cool stuff. The last one's not really trippy, just fun- try to screw up the points then click "duo" under actions. Pretty weird stuff.

      How terrible are my work habits! This blog will be the end of me if I continue to write in it. I have a Macbeth essay I should be currently working on. The final draft is due- I could change around a couple sentences in my second draft and modify the thesis, sliding by with an A. But I can't- I would be able to turn in last-minute, shoddy rubbish in any other class (believe me, I do, and have yet to feel one pang of remorse), but never in English. It's not the subject; it's by far my best and I read and write avidly and passionately, but passion has never been a strong enough impetus to battle my amazing apathy. My teacher, Suzan Lake, installs fear. That's why I work.  Isn't that sad?  Mrs. Lake is by far one of the most fascinating people I've ever encountered. She's subtle, soft spoken, and has this amazing power over anybody she talks to. She won't hesitate to rip a student to pieces in front of the entire class because he or she didn't put any thought into a paper, but is kind and willing to teach if you are open, submissive, and ready to learn. She never interrupts anyone that interrupts her in class, but waits quietly to explain to him why he/she is so impatient, where his/her impatience stems from, and what depths of meaningless existence it will drive him/her to if he chooses not to abandon it.   Nobody has ever insulted Lake. She is one of the most learned people that has ever served as a mentor in my life; she speaks 4 languages, and knows the work of every author and poet ever mentioned in class. She studied the pronunciation of ancient Gaelic so that she might be able to read poems in the language to her students. And yet she is humble, never flaunting this immense wealth of knowledge; her wisdom is simply so pure and abundant that it seeps from her eyes and from her pores and from her very being, ever present and silent. She is willing to share this with any that yearn to partake of the sweet concept that is experience, but is ever ready to punish those that forsake what she has given them and try to use ignorance as justification for indolence. Before her I feel as if I am standing before Howard Roark (for those of you familiar with The fountainhead)   She is the reason that I will get only 4 hours of sleep tonight because of a paper that could technically be completed in 10 minutes. She is the only person in the world that I've ever thought of as a true objectivist. Her work isn't in architecture or in art, but in the shaping of human minds.   Quite an extraordinary woman.

      Yesterday my purse was stolen. It was terrible; I didn't have any credit cards, debit cards, my drivers license, or my social security number in the purse at the time it was viciously ripped out of my life, but my Christian Dior sunglasses are gone! Why, oh why? Why my Christians? I am a restaurant hostess, and I make 7 freaking bucks an hour. Those sunglasses cost me $250.  Note to self: Cease to exist as a brand whore and save up for college.  My family and I were at Domino's pizza at the time (which makes perfect sense, I know). I left the purse (which is my fault, I know). We came back to the greasy edifice to find that the manager had found it after I called to inform him of my loss, but had left it on the seat. A Hispanic man had come in, ordered and paid for a pizza, saw my purse and bolted without picking up the food he had paid for. Upon seeing the man frantically running out of the shop, he wrote down the license plate number and called the police. So now I have a case number, the policeman's sympathies, and no purse. Dang.  I'm fine with this; I'm glad I learned this lesson with a cheap purse containing nothing more than $4 cash and my precious Diors. I'm just bitter about the fact that it would be so easy to repossess my belongings. The store had the license plate number, from which the officer could look up an address and phone number. That's all I want- a phone number. I'd call Pedro up and say:  "Hello, are you by any chance the man that ran off with my purse last Saturday at Domino's? No hard feelings, honestly, I work hard for my money, too. I'm sure that you found out shortly after the incident that the bag contains only four dollars." AND MY DIOR SUNGLASSES THAT YOU HAVE PROBABLY ALREADY GIVEN TO YOUR BLEACH-BLONDE WHORE, YOU IMBICILIC MONKEY FROM SOUTH OF THE BORDER! “I’ll give you twenty if you just give it back to me- I'll even let you keep the four you've probably already spent. Quite a deal, eh?"  Come on- I can't turn him in, why would he refuse? Most likely because he knows that If I get a hold of his address I'll torch his car. Well, what are you going to do?

      My brother downloaded the Sims with all 8 expansion packs today. (legit? Of course! what a ridiculous question....) An 8 in 1 kind of deal, pretty cool. I don't know how to get to it though, dangit. All I want to do is design a house on Sims...oh, it's been too long. I'm going through withdrawal now that I think about it. Hmmmmm....Sims....  Things at my house are calm right now, which isn't saying much considering that my family is a bipolar, 6-part whack job that consumes any people, ideals, or insects to perch next to it. Bow down before the all-destroying collective, ready to freak out and scare anything, anytime. Beware, though; the ability to disappoint and panic is the only stable action one can rely on, this unit thrives on disappointing. It’s not too bad, though; Nothing $50,000 worth of therapy and a couple of pick-me-ups can’t fix. Fear not.     Do you fabulous people remember our dear friend Heather? The stupid one? Well, out of the incalculable sentences of unsurpassable idiocy, I managed to find one of merit. This is not to be seen as redeemable, however; the woman would have to write a Dostoyevsky to do that. Listen to this:   “I'm tired of love; it can kiss the fattest ass in the world [and] lick its cheeks until it bleeds for all I care.”  						                                           -Heather  This makes me smile. Ha. I’m going to start cracking up when I see her in English tomorrow. hee hee hee.   The play is over but I’m not sad. I’m continuing to bond with these adorable people; next week I’m going to a party at Dave’s and then throwing one of my own. How splendid.  Yes! Rob’s online and might show me how to get to Sims. My mother’s away for the evening, so I can play to my hearts desire (definitely NOT a good thing). I leave you now for my sexy flooring and improved wall paper. Hmmmmm, wallpaper…drool….

      The play went fabulously. Absolutely fabulous. We performed well, Travis and Maile were there, it was absolutely corking. Max and Dan and I went on a wild rampage to kiss everybody on the cheek, seeing as it was our last day. I had a spiffy time.   I'm going to miss the play. Honestly- I am. It was ever so fun, I loved it. I'm going to have a cast party (get this) at my house either this week or next. Dave is throwing a hot tub party soon. I think I'm going to stay in touch with most of them, I'm excited. I love these people so much. Huzzah.  Yes- well, there is a chance I'm going to the temple tomorrow morning at 5:00, so I think I'll leave you and sleep after taking off the extreme amount of makeup that is currently covering my face.    Bubye, all.

      I just finished contending with my mother. I can’t stand this family and I don’t think I’ll be able to take it for much longer. Apparently my mother, my brother, and my grandma have been reading my blog and Elisse’s blog. Everybody wave. They’ve been working very hard to prove their ever-so-mature temperaments to me and the rest of the world.  My mother is incredibly upset that I keep a blog. She’s fine with a physical journal, but not a blog. She hates the fact that the entire world can read it but her, that I’m discriminating against her. Why is the fact that I don’t want her knowing every thought that runs through my pessimistic brain beyond her grasp? Why is it insulting to see that, being her daughter, I become angry with her and I need to talk about it? Why does it matter whether only I read it or Elisse and two other complete strangers read it? The woman is driven to yoke me in my impenetrable solitude and eventually drown me in it. The rest of the world (the entire 2 people that read my blog) can’t possibly find out that my mom is actually flawed. I can’t possibly express myself in a way that produces a substance that has the power to benefit and entertain others. Of course not- I’m suppressed. Huzzah.  Rob has been reading this and informing my mom that I have a dirty mouth. I have used an entire 2 (count them) swear words, and I have a dirty mouth. What? My mother would break down if she actually had a problem child, a child with really massive problems. Argh.   I just don’t understand it. I don’t see why I’m expected to go hang out with all the other Mormon girls when I don’t respect them. “He who sins against the greater light receives the greater condemnation”- don’t the Mormon girls, therefore, have the bigger problems? No- they do not drink or smoke or have lots of sex with random people, but they are materialistic, exclusive, malicious people that taunt those not in their circles to the point of sadism. They know what they should be doing, and yet act in a manner entirely un-Christian. Why should I associate with these counterfeits simply because they make themselves look how they’re supposed to look?  I refuse. I will not do this. I’m not going to censor my blog; I do not write for them. I’m not going to feign respect for them when they’re feeding their insecurities by reading my blog. I have my own morals, and I’m a good child. I have done close to nothing. Nothing. My family is too unsound to compensate me with the trust I believe myself to by worthy of. They are too dependent upon the illusion of control to let me speak out against them. What does it matter if it’s on the freaking web or not? What does it matter if I type it- you can’t stop me from thinking it. It scares you to see it written because it robs you of your ability to turn a blind eye to my feelings and my hindrances. You can no longer pretend to have built a seamless family because my honest opinions are staring you in the face. I am revolted by such suppression and refuse to condone it by muting my views and judgments. This is what I think. This is what I feel. If you have a problem with this then rob me of more rights and privileges. I DON’T CARE. This is what I see, from my mind to yours. I give it unto you. Do with it what you wish.

      	So the inhumanly busy day that I went to bed early for has so far turned out to be one of the most empty ones I've lived in months. I awoke at 7, grabbing an orange while rushing out to the SAT. After sending me to 5, I kid you not, 5 different buildings, they kindly informed me that I did not have my registration packet and therefore could not take the test. The woman that I talked to last night on the help 1-800 line must have been an evil impersonator who was trying to deceive me, because only one of the eight things she told me was true. Surely, it wasn’t whoever I was currently talking to at that time who was at fault; everyone was wrong except for whoever was “assisting” me at the moment. I felt completely vexed at the incompetence that sprung forward to meet me at every turn, so I stomped home after informing the tester that his campus was of the devil. 	 I wasn’t too frustrated, however; I had work at 11:30 and was going to have to seriously push my physical capacity to get to work on time. I figured this was for the best and that I could take the test next month. I clean my room, go to work, and then spend 45 minutes waiting for busses and trains to take me back home upon realizing that I’m not working today.    	 Technically I’ve spent a lot of time frantically doing nothing today. What a frustrating feeling. Argh.  Anyway. Elisse was arrested yesterday for being assaulted by her 60 year old step-grandmother. Huh.  Apparently Sue, her grandfather’s wife, attacked her and then pretended as if Elisse had attacked her. Yeah, I know: kind of hard to see. So Elisse spent the morning in juvenile detention and emerged an incredibly depressed person. I was going to go with her to a friend’s house, but it was raining and I would have to tell an incredible amount of lies to do so, so I decided against it. Elisse became quiet and withdrawn, as if she was so used to me abusing her. I’ve always marveled at Elisse’s amazing ability to victimize herself, especially in our relationship. She viewed me as this pitiless addiction; her drug of choice. She would whine and whine and whine and make up these nonsense problems and dilemmas, then cry and scream out in self pity when I refused to waste my time trying to resolve them. She would complain to her friends about how hard it was to be mistreated by me and then become puzzled when they all hated me. Even when my mother decided I couldn’t talk to her anymore, she became mad at me because I wouldn’t “fight” for her. How could I do this to her? Yes, my family was falling apart, my mother didn’t trust me, I was handled like a disease at home, and Elisse cries and yells because she doesn’t like how I’m handling things. What does she want? Does she want everyone to stop and drop everything to play into her ideals every time she demands them to? She expected the same things from Hunter. Does she expect me to lie to my family and kill myself trying to hold on to the little rights I have left just so I can comfort her when her picture perfect net of manipulation and deceit finally starts to rip? I don’t adore her as everyone else does. I won’t let her walk all over me just like her minions do. How does such behavior classify as abuse? The only way I could get away from the false entity she saw me as and forced everyone else to see me as was to plant that letter and walk away as the ungrateful child. I’m glad this event has finally slapped her in the face with the callous hand of reality. I’ll never forgive her for some things that happened last year. She says that she has matured and grown, I hope she doesn’t think that growth comes without price. I hope she doesn’t think that I’ve forgotten about the tremendous impact her fallacious visions had on my life.  	 Yesterday, after I decided not to go with her, she acted so hurt and crippled. When I caught her walking, I came up to her. She wouldn’t talk. She said she was tired “of nobody being there when she called”. She ignored the fact that I was walking in the rain with her when I had a ride. She ignored the fact that I hate talking to her when she’s submerged in her blinding self pity, yet I was doing it anyway. That’s not what she wanted, so it doesn’t count. 	 Fuck. I’ve felt this for the longest time. I’ve felt so sickened and disgusted by this, so utterly mad, so consumed by this anger. I haven’t endeavored to surface this because she’ll twist it into whatever shadows her flaws and illuminates mine. I haven’t tried to talk about this because it’s over, and I’m sick of these warped feelings and synthetic emotions. I am so glad this is over, so glad. The most melodious emancipation was the first step I took away from her. She doesn’t even realize this.   She doesn’t even care.

      $40. Forty dollars. FORTY FREAKING DOLLARS. Had I worked tonight, I would have made a whopping 20 dollars and 25 cents. AND I AM PAYING $40 TO GET IT COVERED!!!!! I'm still in shock.  Anyway- performing is fun. Opening night was yesterday and we were sold out. I loved every second of it. I leave in 2 hours and 55 minutes for my second performance. I'm excited.  Yesterday NZ gave me a big hug. It made me happy but I overheard him talking about this other girl he is in love with. Meh. Yes, I love the boy, but I'm somewhat apathetic seeing as the attraction is purely physical. I am quite content with my virginity; he's quite set in his ways of taking advantage of women.   I can't help feeling swept every time he breaks into a smile, throwing his head back to laugh. I can't change the fact that his grin and his eyes and his being is adorable, as messed as he appears to be.

      ﻿I'm in Frank's room right now. The food fair is still going on, but I left 15 minutes into it; there's very little to do and it incredibly easy to get past the pseudo bouncers they have stationed outside of it. My marzipan was a big hit, Mrs. Child loved it. I want to go to sleep, but all the blankets are taken. Argh.

      Kransekake is so yummy. Such a yummy pain in the butt.  My mother and I just finished making the rings for marzipan Kransekake, and I’m ever so anxious to eat it. I’m taking it to the cultural food fair at school, so I’ll have to wait till the morning. Mmmm…marzipan…I’m going to give a nice big piece to Frank and he’ll love me even more. Huzzah!  Anyway- it was a pain in the butt to make. I had to grind the almonds into a fine paste, which, considering I used a blender as opposed to a nut grinder, took forever. We then added powdered sugar and egg whites until it was perfectly moist, then proceeded to roll them into rings and gently place them on the pan. It’s a lot harder than it sounds; the marzipan keeps falling apart and getting to thick or to thin and keeps being a slut.   But it’s so yummy!  Tomorrow is opening night. Seriously- in 22 hours and 25 minutes I’ll be shaking behind stage, struggling to feign effortless tranquility. I’m so sad; I can’t believe the play will be over so soon. it will never be the same and I won’t be seeing all of these dear people. So sad. *sniff*    I still haven’t gotten my shift covered. (hahahahhaha). I left an incredibly sad and guilting message on one of the girl’s answering machine, I’m screwed if she’s as unsympathetic and pitiless as I am. I’m not worried about it, though. I just won’t go to work, get fired, then live in genteel poverty. Sounds good to me.  I’m getting up early tomorrow so that I can curl my hair and look all sexy like, so I need to get to bed.   Wish me luck! (Considering how easy in is for me to dislocate and break things, I think this wish is much safer than the other expression.)

      My mother is teaching me to sew, and I'm making an Easter dress. It has layers of different pastel-color fish netting for the skirt part, and we haven't quite figured out the boddess yet. How fun it will be.  I wear such wacky clothes at times, I might as well make my own. Good idea...

      Apparently this girl at school, Amanda, had a dream about me. She's an interesting girl, a friend of Elisse's. Well, not really, but much more her friend than she is mine. I don't respect her, but we get along and I enjoy her company.   In her dream I was sitting in seminary, in an absolute fit. I was flooded with tears, pounding the desk, slamming and rushing my head into the wood. I was screaming wretchedly, loudly. "I can't do it! I can't do it! Personality and individuality have been sacrificed on the bloodless alter of acceptance! I have no choice but to conform!" And I screamed such things throughout her dream.   huh.  How true, how true. No matter what I exist as I always end up chatting about clothes and "hot" boys. I'm such a typical teenager. I'm a bitter, cynical, sadistic person who comes across as an intellectual in the right light. I'm like the rest of them, identical except for one key characteristic: I revel in it. I love it! I'm shallow and petty and I love every second of it. This is the only time I can accurately blame my problems on my age. I know this, and plan to rape this tidbit of knowledge to my full advantage. YAY!       I'm in a good mood right now. Play went fabulously, even though I did flirt with every guy there. The male population of the drama department is so open, I adore them all. And NZ was there, of course, looking as dashing and smoldering as ever. I chatted with Dave about color coordination in the spring, and met a new hilarious actor that's afraid of me. Good times, good times.  I hate being bipolar. These feelings of elation and distraction are so liberating that confinement is that much more painful when it plunges down to meet me. I am an instant gratifier, however, so it generally tends to work itself out. Oh well.  Yeah. So: “I would die for you” by garbage is such an exceptionally sexy song that it’s almost implausible. Talk about some fine make-out music. Yes, indeed, sexy make-out music. Mmmmm….  I just read Elisse’s blog and I think she’s in Moab. I’m not sure. How do I miss something like this, dangit? Ahh- I’m so confused. I think I’ll email her, but in her blog she said she was going without communication. What? Alrighty, I suppose I’ll find out whenever she chooses to respond.  I have nothing else to write. If I did continue to write, it would most likely contain nothing but details about how I want to rip certain people’s clothes off. (Surely no one from New Zealand, I’m sure) Since all of you already know about this, I think I’ll leave you now. For your own sake, you know.

      Dash it all! My study habits are terrible. I got up at 4:00 to do the physics I could have easily done yesterday, but I can't ever concentrate unless I'm mentally absent. Talk about ironic. Huh  Anyway-Opening night is in two days and I still have no one to cover my shift at work. I have a lot of work to do on my last scene that I really don't want to do. I am so sick and tired of acting all sick and tired of everybody and exploding; it's incredibly draining. After our run-through yesterday, though, NZ told me I was incredible. *sigh*  Speaking of such personas, I saw him yesterday after school. Mom and I went down to 9th and 9th to get some bread at great harvest (one of the many things I did yesterday instead of my homework), and to go lazily meander throughout the shops there. The bat has returned from her trip, and was waiting in the car. The woman brought me back a shirt. An interesting shirt. It's a cute collared shirt that fits well, but it's hideous; it's baby blue with this electric blue Hawaiian print on it. Insisting that I wear it out, I pull it over my tee and stomp out to the car wearing the blue monstrosity and long khaki shorts. I'm in tennis shoes.   I looked like a freaking tourist.   All I needed was a camera and a floppy straw hat and I would be the spitting image of a native Wyoming-an out for vaca in the valley. The color was terrible with my face, too. I looked ghastly. So, of course, right as I walked out of great harvest in my dinky wittle outfit, NZ is strolling down the street, 7 feet away.   "Hey Rachael." He calls.  I stand there with my loaf of bread in hand, force a smile and answer back. I blushed then bolted for the car. Dangit! The first time the bat has left town it 5 years! The first time she's gotten me a shirt this ugly! The ONLY time I EVER wore long khaki shorts! Of course they all come together when NZ is walking down 9th south debonairly, jacket carelessly flung over his back. Argh!  This is stupid of me, and I have no idea why I care so much. I don't think I even realized how much I cared until that moment, right after I had stepped off the imaginary charter bus from Cheyenne. I really shouldn't mind, but I do. I crave control at all times, and no one is in control while wearing neon colors! No one.  Oh well. I guess I’ll just have to look beautiful today to make up for the fact. Since I haven’t done my English and (get this) have yet to finish my physics, I need to leave you. I adore you all, so don’t find me too pathetic.   I’m just a conceited, arrogant, delusional control freak. Nothing wrong with that, right? :)

      It's 5:42 in the morning, and I've been up since 3:45, therefore I'm a little off right now. I finished my history essay on change in the roaring 20s in which I focused on architectural transformations in style, and now I have to start on my trig. Jo's (I'm sick of typing Amy jo, so we shall hence forth refer to her as "jo") coming over soon due to the fact that neither of us understand it. I'm trying to type really quickly so that I'll be finished by the time she comes over. Ugh- I haven't even started my trig yet. Argh!  The good news, however, is that I did no homework whatsoever on the Sabbath, which makes me happy. I had an exquisite day yesterday, it was fabulous. Hmmmmm.  Starting in a month or two, I might have every other Saturday night off. Redemption!  Jo isn't here yet, but mom's home from her route and I'm going to go have breakfast with her. Jauntome, all.

      I have the strangest feeling that I'm going to be writing about my cute busser quite a lot, and therefore need to bestow one of my own specially-conceived names upon him. I shall call him Claudio.   I'm beginning to find this boy more darling every time I see him. He dominates my thoughts at work; I can’t glance in his direction without blushing and turning my head the other way in order to hastily grin in a manner that’s anything but discreet. I can’t help but throw my hair back every time I approach his bussing station, I honestly can’t. He’s such a dear, and he doesn’t do heroine. Talk about a double threat!  I’m so sad that he’s old. Well, older. I think he’s 20, but he might be 19. Normally this wouldn’t deter me, but at work things like this never work. What a pity.  I had so much homework to do today that I didn’t do. (A surprise, I know, please do try to contain your shocked gasps and startled demeanors.) I don’t know when I’m going to do it, yet it has to get done. This isn’t fair; if my history teacher has the power to create a time warp in her class and command time to stop, I should too. I should be able to snap my fingers and work and sleep and eat, only to return back to this rushed reality when I feel prepared and well-rested. Stupid deadlines, gngngng…  Opening night for take 5 is in less than a week, and I still need to get one of the nights covered. If I don’t get it covered, than I’m not going to work. It’s simple; I’m not missing the play just so that I can be at work to serve dollops of spag to uncouth customers.  Oof. I’m tired. To bed I valiantly trot!

      What a beautiful day. On the wings of freshest exaltation has spring finally flown into the picturesque valley in which I live. Every element announces its return; the birds sing lightly, the wind brushes up gently against everything it meets. Even the hurried hum of the cars outside seems to fade into a rushing reverberation that reminds me of the sea. I love how the sunlight falls through in the mornings, slowly creeping up to the last areas of my neighborhood where it bursts within and illuminates everything in sight. This world is once again mine; this scenery delights and enraptures me, folding me in layer upon layer of seasonal splendor until I feel protected yet strangely exposed.     Today I did the paper route for Mom and Jeff. They’re in southern Utah, running in a marathon. I woke up begrudgingly, bitter at the thought of losing so much precious sleep. What a fabulous time I had, though, carelessly dropping off the papers at each doorstep, whistling the entire time. It was not work; each step came forward to meet me, every house sprung up, ready to be served.   Yes, I am sentimental. At times like this I truly am. I don’t care about walking at graduation or going to dances or the rubbish that plagues many of the minds that surround me, the mawkish and the maudlin. Why would I feel a reaction to any of these man-made incidences? Why would I bother to concern myself with such a thing when I find it so trivial? It is the moments such as the one I’m currently experiencing that lift my heart. I’ll always delight in the right to witness such things.   I have work today, I work lunch and dinner. I’m going to try to go running before, so I leave you now. The birds are beckoning me.

      Argh. So tired. So very tired.  I haven't written in a while (at least if feels like it, even though I think I wrote yesterday), so I'm just going to leave a couple words with you. Let's start with this: I'm freaking exhausted. Ran around all day today trying to get things done, and then worked for 6 hours. So very tired.  Good job, you assumed correctly; this entry is going to be nothing but a complaining session, how did you know? Fine, I won't whine. I suppose I can find something else to write about.  I am absolutely smitten with this adorable boy at work. Smitten in every sense of the word (except for any sense that's remotely biblical, simply because of the obvious connotation formed by years of reading the book of Job). The boy is so adorable. He's a busser, a shy busser. He's the type of boy to glance up and hold eye contact just barely long enough to noticeably look down, blushing. He has the deep brown eyes you want to swim in, I swear he's adorable. And his smile- by thor, his smile. He has these perfect, white, teeth that burst through his beautiful mouth every time he sees someone. The boy's beautiful.  *sigh*  Why do I have to be the youngest person working at the OSF? Why, oh why? This is terrible! I've decided, however, that I need someone with dark eyes. I'm such a slave for dark eyes. Dark, mysterious eyes and dark hair.   [Due to the liberal amount of drool found on Ivory's keyboard, she will now be leaving you so that she can clean it up and get at least 5 hours of sleep. Farewell]

      Once again, I miss my bus. Stupid UTA. Oh, how I hate UTA. The foundation is simply stupid for many reasons:  •	These people are never on time. NEVER. I understand it’s impossible to predict just how long it will take to get to a certain bus every day; it depends on how many old ladies will take 5 minutes getting onto the bus and how busy the traffic is. I know this; I understand they can’t be on time everyday. This does not change the fact, however, that having to wait for up to 10 minute intervals on both sides of the pre-stated arrival time sucks like a headache after St. Patty’s day. •	Those operating the bus are rude; they grunt, they bark, they drool while sluggishly announcing the names of the stations their monstrosity of a vehicle is currently approaching. These people aren’t nice. Once again, I understand they might possibly have the worst job in all of the salt lake valley, but I don’t care. I deal with inept schmucks everyday, I’m underpaid and unappreciated, but I still have to smile and laugh at every stupid joke that comes my way. Freaking deal with it. I have to. •	The bus rides are overpriced! Bollocks, people! After suffering the stomach-churning nuisances listed above, one has to pay an arm and a leg to get onto the eyesore mess of a bus that sputters before them. $1.35 for 4 blocks? I don’t think so.   Well, I have to go to my appalling job right now. And remember, my dear bus drivers of Utah: I’ll be smiling every freaking minute that I’m on.

      I have to go to stake cultural night tonight. I don't really want to go. I don't want to go at all. How, oh how can I get out of this? Maybe I'll think of something while I'm writing...  I've decided I adore Dave. The man is so adorable. He plays the depressed clown in the play, and he's fabulous. He's one of the most animated actors I've ever met, and he's so talented. He's the perfect metrosexual- the gay guy that's straight. He's a straight guy that knows how to moisturize and dress well. That's all I want in a guy, really; masculinity is over-rated. He's a smoker though, which is bad in my book. If only he were sexy. He's cute and endearing in his own way, I suppose, but he's just not beautiful. If only I could find a way of cramming his fabulous, addictive personality into NZ's beautiful lithe body. Dang.  Speaking of, I've decided that NZ is just lacking a personality. It's either not there, or it's currently being eaten by the monster that stupid boy keeps on injecting into his arm. Pity, the boy's so beautiful. Like I said before: a complete waste of olive skin. What a shame...  I'm talking with daddy on IM. Father's wonderful, I'm so blessed. He's a sweetie. He might take me on a cruise this summer. Definitely a sweetie.  Well Bugger! I see no reason why all the men in my life should be as sound as a pound except for the beautiful boy. Someone really ought to have a chat with him one of these days.  I haven't thought of anything yet. I suppose I'll have to go- what a shame.   Argh.

      So it appears that Elisse broke up with her boyfriend Hunter yesterday. Right after I went home, they just broke up. Huh.  Elisse is going to Highland, and I’ll be seeing less of her. She has no connection to east now, I give her my blessing and my encouragement. I’ll still write her, but things will change. I don’t think we’ll drift apart or become less close; once you get to a certain point this doesn’t seem to happen. We’ve reached a state of adoration and understanding that physical distance and time simply can’t spoil. It feels as if we’ll run into each other in 20 years and pick up a conversation right where we left off.    I'm content with the new simplicity found in my blog. No links, no images, nothing buy my words. That's what I wanted all along, I suppose, but my other template was adorable, you have to admit.   I had an absolutely grand time at play. I'm enjoying myself thoroughly; I have a lead, I adore those in my play, and I enjoy the beautiful boys not in my play. I'm beginning to have fun with the play, experimenting with and adding the details and movements that really endear a play to someone. I'm more comfortable with the cast, today Max and Dave sung the "family guy" theme song to me on the side of 13th. I'm beginning to see and appreciate Katie’s genius, to work with her and try and identify what she’s envisaged for the play. It’s going quite well.  I’m listening to “drive you home” by garbage as I gaze out my study window, witnessing the transformation currently occurring outside my door. How appropriate. My life is slowly changing right along with the weather; relationships are collapsing and others are materializing, more pressing issues worry me while those that previously dominated my life are fading. I used to fear solitude, viewing it as a sign of ineptitude, of weakness. I now lust after it, discarding the connections and forged friendships I’ve worked hard for. I used to feel vexed every time I was alone, goaded by the sound of my mind and thoughts. I now cherish them more that the shallow, petty voices that usually surround me. I feel more confident now that I’m no longer performing for distraction, but for entertainment.   Change is never easy; tension is growing in my family, and I’ve become less assured about my future. There is a price for progress, however, and I’m finally more than ready to pay it.

      Look what I do for you people. I sacrifice my beautiful trendy template and my small font just so you can actually read the blog. Silly people.  Today went fabulously. I woke up at 8, did my unit circle extra credit assignment, and went for a quick shopping trip with Amy Jo. I came home and went to Play practice.   Shopping was uneventful and fruitless. I didn't have any money, so I have nothing to write about. Play practice, however, went fabulously. I remembered all my lines, played splendidly, interacted just as I wanted.   Then came the time to go to the movie with Elisse. We went to go see lost in translation. The movie was cute, although I didn't really enjoy it. We went to Kyoto; I had a small bowl of soup and some rice and ran home.  I don't have the energy to write. My stomach hurts. Poor Ricky's done nothing all day, I'm going to go do something with him. I love him, he's a sweetie pie. He deserves a lot more than the meager things presented to him. I worry about him.  I go. Bubye, my dears.

      My family is having company over tonight. I don't like these people; they're tri-athletes, free spirits, and fairly odd people. The mother, a first generation German immigrant with 2 PhDs, is an intriguing and witty woman, but the men of the family are found somewhat lacking. They are found to be very lacking.  Gundi, the mother, has one son named Lucas. This little boy is quite extraordinary; apparently his entire existence upon this earth has been spent without taking a single shower. I swear, not a single one. There is no way someone who has ever bathed before could smell this bad, it's simply not a possibility. Rolling around in canine feces does not leave a smell like this, although the odor is just as penetrating. It's more subtle, less explicitly dreadful, yet far more pronounced. The second he enters an edifice it's as if a fetid blanket of malodorousness permeates the building, flooding every hallway and opening with this inconceivable, inescapable stench. The smell is so thick and so concentrated that one can almost see it; a normal human being instinctively attempts to extend an arm so as to feel it, catch it, and ultimately force it to disappear. It fills a room immediately, leaving the dwellers inside to languish and to suffer, to drown in a sea of an indiscernible poison. Overwhelming and inhuman, this boy's odor exists as one so unbelievable it appears fantastical to many. What crazy fool thought of something so horrifying? Such an extreme is hardly pragmatic to the majority of the populace, it simply sounds absurd. But it exists- this stalking, preying, unforgiving aroma. It exists, and is currently defiling my living room. I find such inimitability creditable; I almost respect him for it. Surely someone with the power to create such a substance is to be treated with reverence and esteem. Surely someone with the ability to be so disagreeable has supremacy of his own, a preeminence fought for with every second he's got. His power to dominate through repulsion is prevailing, and is therefore to be handled with disgusted awe.   They're leaving now, thankfully. His weapon completely departs with him. I don't know how one lives in such a putrid perdition; I'm left feeling quite puzzled. I don't understand it.   Tomorrow I have a busy day. I'd write about it, but I'm left completely weakened by the smell that's currently dictating my mindset. I'm destabilized, shaking on the floor, striving fruitlessly to recover.   You have no idea. This kid smells really, really bad. My eloquence has been ravished and beaten; my already feeble ability to articulate has been crippled. I can't tell you, I'm not a good enough writer.   He smells.  He smells so bad, I don't understand it. I'm almost in tears; what cruel, malicious beast would do this? Who is capable of such brutality?  Wow- I'm a priss. Huh.

      I'm going to be made a desk hostess soon. I'm very excited and, to be completely honest, surprised. Jane and Britnee have been there for over 2 years and they're still floor hosts. I must be chirpier than I thought. This isn’t exactly inspiring.  Desk hosts get paid more for doing less manual work. It's more stressful, but once you have it down you're doing less work. I've been at the OSF for 4 months, I happy to make desk so soon.   A couple things happened at work, none of which were too exciting. I have a couple of things I might do soon, none of which are too exciting. Amy Jo and Jamie just called; they want me to go to the stake dance. Eeck. The thought leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Horrid music, horrid people, horrid dancing. I'm afraid I'm simply not masochistic enough for that. Maile wants me to come with her to her best friend's party. I could sit in a corner and watch a throng of strangers get dangerously drunk and rub up against each other, but I'm just not cynical enough for that. Durham's watching the Princess Bride up at her house with her soph friends. I'm not bored enough for that.   Once again, I'm left feeling pleasantly inadequate. How sweet it is to only feel fit to do that which you desire to do. I had an epiphany while seating people today; I saw a beautiful building, and the second I work out in my head how the staircases will meet on the first floor, I'll draw it. That's all I'll do. I won't travel to the stake center and mingle with the drones while swaying to a morbid beat, I won't try to label and then become one of those at Maile's best friend's party, I won't force laughter out of my throat only to drip into the crippled minds of the pampered. I'll just draw. I'm very excited.  I attained the names of two architectural firms for whom I might work in the summer. Bad pay, unimportant work, positioned under many inept individuals: sounds like fun, don't you agree? The exposure would be beneficial, and I would eventually learn how to draw up some professional blue-prints and fiddle about with CAD a bit. That's all I currently want, really, so I'm going to aim for this additional job as opposed to working full time at the SpagFac in the summer. At least I'll lose my sanity to two different sources instead of one. I don't know why, but this is much more appealing; if I were to dump all my time, energy, and effort into one foundation, I don't think I'd be able to handle it. Maybe if I have two jobs I'll feel as if I have more control over my life. Ha.  Wow. Louis Vuitton’s fall 2004 ready to wear is to die for. So pretty and dainty. Love the shoes, I adore the shoes. The country fabrics would be much too ghastly if they weren't topped off with the flawless fur. I swear, Marc Jacobs is a genius. I've never been the biggest fan of Vuitton, but this was a good show. It wasn't astounding, overwhelming, or blow-your-pants-off good, but it was classy, well-designed, and of good quality. This might seem boring, but this is getting to be rare in the world of high fashion, sadly enough.   I still haven't figured out the first floor of this house, but I'm going to go materialize my visual and see what I have. Farewell.

      I haven’t written for three days, which is somewhat aberrant of me. I leave for work in 11 minutes, so I’m afraid my delayed entry will have to be rather pitiable. You’ll live.  Yesterday I came home from school, miserably sick. I went to a terrible night at work, came home and threw up 4 times during the night. I slept in after consuming liberal amounts of various over-the-counter drugs, and woke up feeling considerably better.   I got my nails done. They’re pretty and acrylic and fake. You’ll notice that I’m typing however; they’re short and extremely natural-looking. I couldn’t be happier with them. I have sexy hands now.  I went to go see my brother’s middle school play at 1. The play was “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor dream coat”, so I was satisfied, seeing they had nothing laudable to debase. I adore Andrew Lloyd Webber, I do, but this is just ridiculous. After seeing such marvels as The Phantom and Evita, one can’t turn back to any play a notch below spectacular.   I have to leave now. My 11 minutes flew by all too quickly, and I’m not yet wearing shoes. Farewell, dearest reader. I must do my duty to spag and my country!

      I'm in an odd mood right now. An extremely odd mood. It may not seem funny to you, but I happen to be reading this blog out loud in a ridiculous fake French accent. Funny indeed.  Maile came over at 3:30. We talked, lounged, and harassed Ricky and his friend until 4:00, when we left to take Amy Jo out to lunch for her birthday. Things turned out splendidly; upon seeing that no one at the training table would sing to Amy Jo, we decided to dine at the Olive Garden instead, an improvement in every way and sense. The experience really brought some insight as to how I come across when I'm with different people. When out with people from work, my group and I hold a quiet yet pleasant conversation, cheerfully addressing those waiting on us, smiling and listening to what he/she/it has to say. When out with people such as Jane or Elisse, we discuss topics seriously and vigorously, only talking to the service when absolutely necessary. When I'm with Amy Jo and Maile, we're the annoying, giggling, boisterous teenagers every server fears and dreads. I had a spectacular time.  The Waiter sat down with us, advising us what to get and warning against the more daring items on the menu. We chatted with him for 5 minutes before ordering, and then requesting a birthday song or two. We burst into fits of laughter almost forcing us out of our chairs, having contests to see who could inspire the most colorful reaction by twisting our faces into hideous expressions. Good times, good times.  I'm not quite sure when the French nationality seized me, I think this occurred about half way through the lecture at young women’s. Apparently we're going to be taking food to the homeless or something. Huh.  I think I gained 5 pounds today. I had the alfredo (what's wrong with me? I work at the OSF, I know the type of grams in alfredo.) and not only that, but I won't be starting yoga until next week, at the very earliest.   Argh. Lately I've haven't been able to feel attractive. Natural and healthy, I suppose, but not just plainly attractive. But I'm too lazy to do anything about this, I don't care. And I don't care about the fact that I don't care. I'm okay with this, all of it but the couple pounds I've gained over the winter. I'll lose them soon, I always do one way or another.   Well, I hate not being able to articulate. It frustrates me, and I'm tired. I don't need to be frustrated right now, not when I have pink and lime-green mammals dancing around my head, occasionally poking me.   I think I'll go to sleep in an attempt to calm them down.

      Guess what I do in an hour? I'm going fake-baking with Jane. HAHAHAHHA- die, skin!  I can't even type that without feeling guilty. I'm going to keep my face covered; I just need tan legs. I have long, beautiful, flawless legs (egoism! Huzzah! I'm not lying, though; My legs are probably my best asset, I kid you not.) they might as well be long, beautiful, tan, flawless legs. I went for a long jog yesterday, and I'm excited to get them in shape again.  I've decided against writing my thesis my paper. I shall endeavor to kill my skin instead.  I make so many bad choices when it comes to certain things.

      My family and I went to divulge ourselves at one of salt lake city's finest dineries- the pie pizzeria.   I was extremely against the idea in general. I don't do pizza, and I haven't since 7th grade. If I'm going to blow my fat-gram allowance in one shot, I'm afraid pizza is not what I'll  be spending it on. Yesterday, therefore, I was one of the snottiest little girls a family could ever dream to have.   But oh my Janus! Best Pizza ever! We got this alfredo broccoli thingy, and it was divine. I couldn't resist. I couldn't resist last night, and I couldn't resist this afternoon although it had sat out all night. Oh well- food borne illnesses will be one of the last things to stop me. I am invincible!  I have a ton of work to do today. I have to make my atom, which one I have not yet chosen, watch 30 minutes of a Spanish soap opera and take notes (Wow- they're all right! Utah education ISN'T a joke after all! Who knew?) And I have to write my thesis paper about Christina Rossetti. And I'm not going to let what happened yesterday happen today. I will not start working at 9:30 and spend all my time blogging, instead! I will fight, I will struggle, I will prevail!  (Unless, of course, Daddy's online. How can I ever reject such a dear man?)  Oh- note to Elisse: Do you see this? What is this Soirâ€ nonsense? Do you feel no obligation to the inferior of the computering world? What about us PC users who want to buy the machine without any previous education on implementing it, don't bother to research it or learn something about it, and then expect it to work? (my brother works tech support, if you can't tell) What about us? Help, this is ugly!  Don't make me call tech support!

      My day was flawless. The weather was absolutely corking today, breezy with this penetrating sunshine that subtly caught me between gusts of wind and billowing clouds. I'm listening to Debussy's “Beau Soir”, and I'm lost in ecstasy.   And yet I claim to be completely rid of sentimentality. Get away, you pesky beast of denial! Shoo!  I'm thinking of cutting my hair. Elisse cut hers today, it's all sexy and tousled and short. Mine's almost down to my waist, and it's hard only having two looks to work with- up and down. Really kind of frustrating.  Anyway- the bat left this week for Colorado. Apparently she's going to see her friend Betty who broke her hip, had two heart attacks, and gained 80 pounds all in the same month. Yeah- she's not alone in being completely and totally weird. The word "weird" is probably one of the weakest adjectives in the English language, but I simply cannot fight the fact that it is the most appropriate. She’s amusing yet depressing, alive with senile vivacity yet so withered; she leaves one in a neutral mindset that can’t be described. The woman is simply weird.   I’ve discovered another person I’ve decided to add to my hate list. Here is my new updated version:  1.	Boris the Dog 2.	That freaking 6’2’’ goddess that stalks the B floor. No one has the right to look like that. No one. I hate people who are prettier than me with an ardent passion that I don’t endeavor to curtail. Grrrrr 3.	The Bat- the more I think about her, the more disgusted I am. 4.	Amy Jo- sorry, love. Stupid people and I just don’t mix well. What can I say? I think I’ll allow JD Bernal to say it for me: “The full area of ignorance is not mapped. We are at present only exploring the fringes.” 5.	John Galliano, for doing what he does to Dior every other show. 6.	Tom Ford, for what he’s doing to Gucci by leaving. 7.	That stupid little girl that stares at me and sits in front of me at church. Why are those overly-large pale blue eyes always staring at me from two pews away? Why? For two freaking years she stares at me for the majority of sacrament. May you have glass legs and may the glass break, you yellow bellied comatose prant! 8.	And the newest addition to my list: Heather McGuire.   This girl was born of the lowest realms of mediocrity, yet raised and parented by arrogance and haughtiness themselves. She’s the type of creature to label an entry as her favorite, best written blog entry, and then proceed to show you the most vile of expressions and manifestations; a smoldering lump of goopy sentiment and cliché nonsensical avowals. I don’t mean to be rude, but you simply must view this:   “This eye followed me from childhood on up until this past week or so. Clearing my mind of childish disasters and broadening my feel for future life took its creepy toll just these past months. In its bittersweet victory my maturation both mind and spirit kicked me in the teeth and hanged me by the fireside. Honesty towards all others including myself became so palapable in my new reality. The clairvoyant mysteries of my family drenched me with harsh passion against anyone who dare discover the secret. In my mind I always knew my family was unhappy, yet we put on this show with great eloquence; one in which the carnival ride ceases to halt in its spinning and whirling. Like the titanic struck by an iceberg in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and still remaining "unsinkable", I so blatantly saw what came from beneath me. The boring reality of my new found maturity grasped me with both hands and dunked me under its tide for minutes that seemed like hours those which will now drag on for years at a time not without occassional moments of immature glory. In several hopeless attempts to save what has been done, I myself die with the inheritence. Simple questions with complex answers pressure me to grow up faster than I have to. It makes me sad to think that I'll be stuck in this rut forever unless I change my whole ideas about going through life, and as long as I keep myself busy. I'm not sad anymore, I'm not happy anymore, I'm not hurt anymore, I'm not fulfilled anymore. I'm just curiously bored out of my mind. In another hopeless attempt, I think all I need is affection without a schedule, and a new job to work on my weeknights.  Side Note: Sorry if you cannot understand my random mumblings, maybe someone someday will. I don't purposefully try to sound like a "yale scholar" even though my confusing thoughts may lead some to believe this and the fact that I used 2 or 3 of my English vocabulary words in this entry. (I'm proud of myself sometimes, but some people succeed in tearing down my walls and poking my feelings, so I become bitter and use it against them for a few months, then I give up because that too gets boring.) My best thoughts know no boundaries and usually only make sense to me and to those with great ability to analyze. On an ending note -- Ever since I cleaned my room it's been cold in here; I should have left all the junk in here, at least it kept it warm.   From my brain to yours, do with it what you wish  -Stupid.”  These vocabulary words are so obviously planted that the fact that she misspelled one of them is demoralizing. I suppose I am moved emotionally in a very distressing way, perhaps she felt this too, hence the feeling of prided she late expressed at writing such rubbish:          “I feel confident that I'm going to be a future achiever of America. I can handle the pressure, can you? I would consider myself a little above averagely mature for my age level, and it really helps you understand the feel of life. Underlaying ideas often prohibitted me from her true friendship, but in so many ways these past 2 weeks we've bonded the ancient gap. I love Ana, she's the sweetest girl, and such a smart one too. Our group against the world 2005; we'll show you all what we're made of. If you don't understand this disreguard it, it's not meant for those who just can't grasp what I put across. I still think my entry before this was the best.”  Now, if the homework I have yet to do was anything but history, I would not proceed to rip this absurdity apart and into my mental oblivion. I am afraid, however, that the homework I have left is history.   I find many disturbing things in such a bold statement. I keep on running my tongue across my teeth and lips, hoping to rid my mouth of the nauseating taste instigated by this entry; I find the very thought morbid. By the way, if you find any part of my actions arrogant, conceited or just malicious, congratulations: You win the prize for most meaningless observation made in one week.  1.	In the above two entries, she spelled the following words wrong:  •	Palpable •	Occasional •	Inheritance •	Underlying •	Prohibited •	Disregard  *Just a little note to Heather- before comparing yourself to a “Yale scholar”, try using a spell check, you arrogant little shit.   2.	Grammar- I’m afraid it’s late and I simply haven’t the time to go into this. No person in possession of an education, job or life does. Sorry! 3.	The abstractness with which she tries to write is poorly crafted and transparent. She does not write for herself, she’s like a cheap house disguised by plaster columns and inferior embellishment. This is for display; I doubt she feels anything for this excluding the joy she sees in impressing. I’m afraid that “those with great ability to analyze” will see no merit in this at all, just wobbly desperation that is poorly masked by pathetic egoism.      4.	I can’t even label these phrases, they’re so hideous:  •	If you don't understand this disreguard it, it's not meant for those who just can't grasp what I put across •	Sorry if you cannot understand my random mumblings, maybe someone someday will •	My best thoughts know no boundaries and usually only make sense to me and to those with great ability to analyze  Your thoughts do know boundaries, even your best ones. The individual built to serve society or a collective mind of any type is restricted by the very fixation for which it labors. No one can “grasp what you put across”; you’re not articulate. Not even those with “great ability to analyze” can understand this; there is no meaning. Your pride and the satisfaction you feel in dejection will not help you or make you taste superior; they will become your burdens and your vices.  Good luck with that.   I’m tired and it looks like I’ll be waking at 4 to complete my history. Huzzah! Inefficiency has never tasted so bittersweet. I did my trig, at least, kind of (not really). Wow- I need this year to end. Then I can spend three months doing nothing but showing people to their tables and napping on the front desk of work. My brain has either died or developed a very crippling personality disorder; it’s not working anymore. It might of decided to vacation in Europe; perhaps I’ll stumble upon it at an Irish pub someday. Maybe it’s just sleeping.   Oh my, I’m rambling. A couple more minutes and I’ll start sounding like our dear friend Heather who we met a couple paragraphs ago. I can’t let this happen, I leave you only because I must.  Farewell!

      I have just returned from one of the most fatiguing days of my life. I am much more exhausted then when I just drag myself up my dark mahogany stairs and collapse in my bed. When I am feeling truly drained and beaten I write.  The memory of today has turned into a blur that subconsciously I'm trying very hard to forget. My legs and arms are throbbing, and my eyes are stinging like mad, but it's this monotonous numb pouring throughout my mind that hurts the most. After giving everything to stay aloft, it feels like a time that I'd give all that I have to sink.   My day started early. My mother woke me at 7:30 to eat breakfast, which was proceeded by a shopping trip my mother and I took until I had to work at 11:30. I had a splendid time, really. We discovered this heart-stopping smoky gray gown that was marked down from $335 to $89. We decided to meet in the Library at 4:30 to go retrieve it after I cashed my check.   Work was terrible today. It was busy when we opened, when we closed, during every dragging moment in between. Every customer I sat was displeased, no one was satisfied. I couldn't get off until 4:00, sprinting to the library so that I wouldn't miss mom. Fifteen minutes later I hurried into the edifice, climbing the concrete stairs to the pre-arranged meeting place. I grabbed a Harper's Bizarre mag, and rested in the same spot that I had met Elisse the week before. It was pleasant, sprawled out on the orange pleather, nonchalantly flipping through pages and pages of high fashion. Of course, right when I stumbled upon an interesting article about John Galliano, Jeff hurried up to me, looking slightly shaken.  Apparently my mother had decided to go psychotic today, shouting in front of everybody that she wanted a divorce and that Jeff was a thief. She was freaking out, searching for me in the library, although we had agreed to meet at 4:30. She had run away from Jeff, searching madly for me throughout the city.   Whatever. I've learned not to question episodes such as these. My mother simply can't be controlled at this moment; she'll plow through anyone or anything, searching for a shard of peace that isn't to be found. When she loses control, she searches unscrupulously and frantically until it finds her again. She just needs time, and that's what I give her. I wanted that dress, and it was only on hold until 5:00. I forced Jeff to take me to the bank instead of looking for my mom. He wouldn't have prevailed; if the woman doesn't want to be found, she won't be found. If she wants to be found, neither you nor any mortal has the power to avoid her.   So we rushed to Nordstrom's, only to see that they accidentally put it back on the floor, even though it wasn't 5 yet. I ask you: why is competency nowhere to be found in the work field? Why? The dress is gone; we searched the racks, the other racks, interrogated the half-wit responsible thrice. It was gone.  Whatever. I'm pissed already, and this incident fits perfectly into my day. People don't care, people don't see, people just don't know. The dress was one of a kind, but I have to get back to work.  So we pull into the OSF parking lot to see my mother emerging from the building, in a rage. This is when I almost went ballistic. Twice before has my mother screamed at my manager for nothing, getting me an official warning. Why does she do this? I worked hard for this menial job and I'm working very hard to keep it. I started to cry, knowing my mother had just made trouble for me at work. She runs up to me, screaming at me for "picking Jeff over her", for "running away from her when she left skiing early to find me at the library", and for "abusing her and treating her with disrespect". My mother and I, mind you, were on good terms up until this point; we were both ecstatic about the dress and were happy to go get it. She continues to rage on in this fashion for another minute or so, until I start to scream back at her through the salty tears that have covered my face. Why does she have to be this way? Why can't she restrain herself ever? Why must it always be my fault? It's so frustrating...  We're sitting in the back of a blazer, shaking with rage, screaming the sharpest, most dangerous words at each other. Faces red with hatred, faces wet with tears, eyes swollen already. Finally she stopped, slammed the door open, and ran down 6th east.   I was tired; I wanted to run. I wanted to run in the opposite direction as fast and as furiously and as desperately as my mother. I yearned to leave the parking lot, to run until finally my body gave up the ghost and I collapsed beside a dusty road. I wanted to feel the last pang of breath slowly exit my body, and to feel my limbs and head go limp, falling to the earth below. I wanted to bite down on my lip until it bled, to see blood flow forth just as the life slowly seeped out of my being, taking me onward.    But I couldn't, and I knew this. I was in flowing tears when I entered the mall, I was composed and smiling by the time I climbed the last step of the stairway leading directly to the OSF. My wish was partly granted: I could feel my being and will giving up the ghost, I could feel the life slowly seeping out of me. Every time I smiled or laughed I could sense my mind going limp, while my drive pushed on to maintain the face, to maintain the air of a care-free young woman. I laughed stupidly with the other hosts and customers, my body collapsing beside the road, panting and sucking air madly into my beaten lungs. I skipped up the staircases, I filled up my sections, I amused the managers, I was not taken onward.  It becomes easy to hide so openly. It's almost intuitive, killing the urge to lash out, placing a drive to please in its place. Once such an act is accepted, the rest of my being follows, obedient and silent. Just once did a tear fall to the floor, while I was taking a bathroom break. To the rest of the world I was happy, I was spoiled, I was protected. To the rest of the world I new nothing but contentment, nothing but fed ignorance and naivety. To them I was perfect.   I came home without eating. At times there's nothing quite like physical emptiness to complete and to fill the emotional voids created by desolation. I collapsed on my bed to find I was laying on the dress, a shimmering curtain shielding the viewer from the lack of control and cruelty felt by every member in the house. I threw it to the floor, rushed to my computer, and began to write.

      So Ricky's been reading my blog. Everybody Wave! Hi Ricky! Thank you so much for showing an incredible disregard to my right to privacy. Thanks so much for not even trying to curve your curiosity just a little so that I might be able to express my self honestly in one way. Such a freaking sweetie, I know.  Yesterday, as I was leaving, he shouts "Rachael, don't like boyfriends who smoke!". I stop in front of him to shoot a glance of morbid curiosity and hatred, silently demanding an explanation. "Just random advice. Fun, huh?” he says. Wow, he has all the intellectual subtlety of a blind man performing brain surgery with a chainsaw, doesn't he?   I'm not trying to be rude, I'm simply endeavoring to tell him how offended I am. And since he'll never own up to reading my blog, I can insult him all I like and he can't retaliate. So, Ricky: knock yourself out, kid. I don't care. If I really have anything juicy that you would want to know, I'll write it then make my blog private. Schmuck...  So, now that we have concluded with our "Rant about family" section of this ever-faring blog, let's go onto "Rant about  " section. Should be fun!  Yesterday was just tiring. We were unbelievably busy, and Travis was lead and Britnee was desk. Bad combination , bad bad combination. I find them to be lacking at each of their jobs, so when paired together on the busiest night of the week, havoc and chaos dominate the noble foundation known to us as the Old Spaghetti Factory. I was so frustrated. Not only that, but our two newest hostesses were the other floor hosts. What twit thought up last night's schedule? We were on a 20 minute wait, yet half the restaurant was empty. I tried to keep my section full, as an attempt to input a redeeming quality into the views of hostesses held by the rest of the restaurant, but every time I would ask for a table, I wouldn't get it. I was so mad:   "Travis, call me a four" (three and a half minutes later, I get my four)  "Where you going with this, Rach?"  "8.4"  Vikki: “No, wait. I need a four up in 17, it's nearly empty."  So, of course, I go up there and there is ONE table empty. ONE! Stupid over-achieving hostess...  I am truly sorry about all the complaining that is going on here. This must be incredibly hard to read, but I'm so frustrated right now. I got into girls state, though. I'm leaving the last week of school, and Elisse made it, too. It will be fun. Not really compensation for the rest of my day being intolerable, though. This however, was:  I had to run back to school to grab my physics book. I didn't mind; the day was pleasant and I adore the way a cool March breeze folds over my skin, energizing me. I toddled a bit, approaching the school 15 minutes after departure. There, standing by the front door, was NZ. He was smoking, leaning debonairly against the wall, ignoring those around him. He looked up every once in a while, but seemed thoroughly bored. Smoke curled around his face, rising from a mouth that seemed so correct and appropriate. He tilted his head back, displaying his ample neck, blowing smoke into the wind and watching it float away. His long, dark eyelashes flitted about with every glance he threw while talking.  I was quite wrong. NZ reigns over my thoughts, as fervent and strong as ever.

      Ahhhhh....How perfectly absurd. Ridiculous in the sense that only Galliano can define. Neglecting entertainment value, however, I'm afraid I was a bit disappointed with this show. Not as disappointed as I was with the Spring/Summer 2004 Haute Couture, mind you, but pretty disappointed.   I swear- Dior's Fall 2003 Couture sucked me in. That was when I became a Dior addict, when I started to worship Galliano, and watch the show every other week. The sex, the beauty, the flow, the beat, it was this beautiful dance of strength and synchronized power. The models took the runway by storm, pouncing and beating on the runway with their high heeled shoes, stalking down with smirks most impertinent. The makeup was bizarre, the clothes were fabulously nonsense, I loved it. That show is why Dior is my favorite fashion house.   This current rubbish is poppycock. Galliano is loosing his touch. Shame...

      My day was completely uneventful. I went to school, went to play practice, went to work. Apparently I did well in play today, two people who were viewing came up to me and said:  "You scared me. Good job."  This role is really draining. It just takes everything out of you; even though "mother's party" is a comedy, the break-down I have in the end is tiring. I'm really happy with it, though. It's something when someone who is practicing in a room a floor above you comes up to you and says "I could really hear the anger in your speech." Blah....  I think that NZ's reign over my thoughts during most of my classes is soon coming to an end. The interest just isn't really there anymore. Although I found out today that he had a lead in Les Mis last year, and loved it, I'm just bored by almost everyone around me. Even the heroine-using, olive-skinned, Mohawk-clad New Zealander is boring me. There isn't one person who intrigues me. Amy is predictable in her pettiness, my mother in her unpredictability, Elisse in her scandal. I love all of these people dearly, but isn't there one who can excite me?   I obviously was not created for the Salt Lake Valley. I have moved all my life; 13 times including our move to Utah. I am easily disillusioned with one place or another. I am ready for a new breeze against my face, and a new beauty to surround me. I am ready for different people and a different dominate religion. My family has spent 4 years in Salt Lake, I'm still in shock. I hate it.  There was this absolutely adorable waiting for TRAX beside me today. Juicy Couture jeans and a Dior fashion victim purse. Why can't I have a $1400 Christian clutch? Because I am a hostess that makes $7 dollars an hour. Argh.  Well, I have trig to do. 9 problems, but they're proofs, so they'll probably take the better part of an hour.  I think I need to move to Nepal. That's exactly what the doctor ordered...

      I can't do it, I simply cannot go a day without writing in my blog. I really don't have the time or something to write about, but I simply can't do it. So, here I am, feeding an addiction. How wise I am.  So... Joan Jett and the Blackhearts- bad reputation. Best song ever. Today I submitted my first two lessons to BYU distance learning. In the comment box I wrote "purple monkey dishwasher. Yippee!". I hope they have to document and catalog every comment they get. Muwhahahaha....  Elisse is going to stop smoking. Huzzah! Save the lungs!  I have to go memorize my lines. Stupid lines. Stupid play.

      How I cherish a moment like this. I have absolutely nothing to write about; nothing hideous happened today that merits an account, and there was no smashing experience, lifting me. Nothing happened today. Nothing. I saw my Elissie, so my intellectual quota for the day was filled, however meager the short time I spent with her was. I saw NZ, my fam, talked to the bat, saw everybody I wanted to see. I had play practice and Young women's. Nothing happened. I love it...   I'm so content right now. I'm listening to sneaker pimps in my most comfortable jeans, laying decadently in my entrancing solitude, a feeling I rarely indulge in nowadays. I adore lying on the hard-wood floor, listening to my thoughts and my music. Nothing matters when I’m this way; there’s nobody I’m trying to convince, no one to please, nobody at all. There is no satisfaction like this, no pleasure so idolatrous. I love it …  Its at times like this when I realize I don’t need or want someone to share my life with. My thoughts are my thoughts, my mind is mind, this is one bliss I won’t parade in order to enslave others. I don’t need anybody; I can hardly stand anybody else. And yet I don’t feel forlorn, I feel privileged and free, I feel happy. I love it…  My ecstasy: a delight unexplained, an indulgence unwarranted.   I love it.

      Wow. Jeff is such an idiot, it's unbelievable. In an attempt to get out of preparing for ward basketball night, he claimed that "everyone else should do the work because they are lazy elitists who inherited their money anyway." I'm serious, he said this out loud, even though:   My laurels counselor grew up in a lower middle class home, working hard to start and own the advertising agency under her name.  Our other counselor up the street, who has worked to become a specialist on cardiology while paying for the education at the same time.  My best friend, who isn't rich.  The 3 lawyers in our ward who started their own firm when they were all under 30.  Lazy elitists who inherited their money? I think not. When I tell him he shouldn't open his mouth so as to prevent the tragedy of sounding stupid, he says that I sound stupid all the time. "Going on about how much you love Osama and how we shouldn't be helping Iraq out. And then how this is a sign of imperialism? You make your self look stupid every time you open your mouth, Rach."  I can't believe it. I can’t believe this is a 43 year old I'm talking to. I simply can't believe he's survived adulthood so far. I'm in shock....  But then again, he does work for the government.

      I adore my family. Really, truly, I adore them. Every member of this unity is just more justification for me being as messed up as I am. It's fabulous in every meaning of the word...  4 occurrences today reminded me of how lucky I am to have this type of family: 	 1.  Family Dinner - this meal has always been extraordinary in my family. A combination of people such as Rob, the Bat, and Boris the dog is extremely promising in whatever light you choose to view it. Today during leopard lunch, there was an activity in which you had to pick a partner and stare at their eyes for 3 minutes without laughing or smiling. This is one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. After expressing his doubts about the challenging nature of such an exercise, Rob tried it and lasted roughly 6 seconds before bursting into his endearing laugh. The boy is truly something. No words can express such a character; therefore it would seem silly for me to endeavor to do so here. I’ll merely say that he’s insane like me, but is capable of better physical comedy than  urlLink Michael Richards  .This boy can twist his face into any expression of disgust, pain, laughter, gaiety, whatever. One simply cannot avoid laughing when he’s in certain moods. Tonight was one of those nights, so the voices coming from the dining room were those of pure, unrestrained laughter that can only be found in a home. After trying in vain to accomplish this look-in-the-eye feat, he decided to voice an assortment of odd and anomalous noises in an effort to make me laugh first. I think I burnt off the calories gained through the meal by laughing alone. It was spectacular. 	 2.  Family Home Evening - With nobody being able to cease staring at each other in effervescent competition, Family Home Evening was a rather interesting affair. Even my mother kept on giggling during the lesson, throwing her head back charismatically, her laugh issuing forward graciously. After admonishing us, Jeff was disappointed to see Rob playing peek-a-boo with the Bat behind a pillow. Nothing was going to get done, and finally everyone present accepted the inevitable fate of the lesson. We decided between fits of laughter to prolong the lesson until next Monday, laughing madly for the next 10 minutes or so. 	 3.  The Bat’s daily display of abnormality - today she decided that as a confidence-building activity, we would play “I am a star”. During this game, every member of the family would jump up and declare “I am a star!” before continuing to share a talent with the family. For her talent, the bat demonstrated her rendition of the Polka. I mean, this woman is simply batty. She stood up, and proceeded with the dance. She began this number in an incredibly still position, before waking up to her passion and galloping around the room in uneven steps, occasionally slapping her large thigh. This was brief, luckily, but I shall never forget it, or the look of intense concentration upon her face. I sang the first verse of Ella’s “Black Coffee”, mom whistled Bach’s Fugue, Ricky sat down on the floor and folded is limbs up in knots. A very informative presentation was given by Jeff, who showed us the proper form for the American Crawl Stroke, and then explained why most swimmers were inefficient fools who have already deserved the drowning he hoped for them. Robert played a Rachmaninoff on the grand. It was a dazzling, astonishing display that will not soon be forgotten. But, before we leave this subject, I must inform you that the Bat is leaving on Monday to take a road trip to our cabin in Rand, Colorado. I think I’m quite right in my hypothesis that the end is near for this woman; she can barely drive in the daytime and has a debilitating case of road rage. I might add also that she was the grand winner in our staring tournament, due to hours of hard practice with Boris the dog.  	 4.  Talking and Singing with my mother - Things haven’t changed between us since our confrontation on Saturday, oddly enough. We sung for 45 minutes today, hymns, spirituals, bluegrass, and my mom even gave some classic Ella a shot. We then talked about when I was little, the quirky things I’d do and the mad escapades she had growing up. This all sounds horribly sentimental, but it’s simply how my family operates. We can’t get along, we verbally abuse each other daily, but all in all we’re bound with rope thicker than desires or rancor. 	 	I just realized how much I truly will miss then. Rob leaves for Switzerland in less that two months, and one never knows how much longer the Bat will hold out for. This is how I will always picture my family: giggling at nonsensical nothings, bashing the apple users and the Swedes, trying to get Boris the dog to wag his tail. I’ll be sad when this all changes, when people leave and/or die.   I come from such a noble lineage.

      So I spoke with NZ today. He had shot up before, apparently, because he was high. Considering I've never seen a person under the influence and have never been myself, I can only presume he was as such, but I think this is a safe presumption; he was staggering, falling, his left eye was twitching and he kept on talking about the Oscars and eye liner. He might of been severely sleep deprived, but all things in consideration, this is somewhat improbable. He was pretty funny though; I couldn't help but laugh at the boy.   NZ: "My Physics Buddy!" He cries, patting me on the back. (This is a term he's never used in reference to me before, and he's never acted this jocund or open.) "How are you?"  Me: "I'm doing just fine. I haven't started memorizing yet, but, um....is your eye okay?" I say once I notice that his eye is acting violently spastic.  NZ: "Yes, it does that sometimes, but it's okay. Did you see the Oscars last night? They thanked everybody from New Zealand for ring of the Lords. Speaking of, I have to wear eye liner and a ton of it not cool me a man and all." He then slipped into comatose, then started to laugh gaily.   Me: "But I love eye liner! It's so sexy!"  NZ: "Not on a guy." He said, staggering. I couldn't help but laugh. He looked so pathetic. I broke into a fit of laughter, trying very hard to stop.   NZ: "Are you laughing at me?"  Me: Thinking: of course I'm laughing at you. You probably just got through shooting up on the A floor, and you've run into 4 things since I started talking to you 3.2 seconds ago. Tourettes Syndrome is being mimicked by your uncontrollable left eye, and I'm reminded faintly of a hummingbird. You've worked yourself into a fit talking about eye liner, and now you appear to have forgotten all about the fact that you're here for play practice. How on earth could I not laugh at you? Me: Saying: "Of course I'm not laughing at you. You're just acting a wee bit strange."  NZ: "Define a wee bit."    Overall, I'm surprised that he would come to school like this. Or, at least, play practice, since I doubt he came to school. Kind of sad.  I still adore him, though.

      During the dark ages of having no internet, I "blogged" on microsoft word. The fruits of my labors are as such:  April 17th, 2004 Why must things change? Even with my short attention span and eager demeanor, I find myself wishing for a stationary environment and a frozen life at times, hoping for a world that can never deliver anything but consistency. I’ve upgraded and morphed and adjusted, but I’ve never changed. I’ve never had to make a decision that affected my life farther than a week ahead, I’ve never truly worried about the fact that my future is a blur and is progressively falling out of focus, because up until now I’ve had it mapped lucidly before me. Even when I decided to graduate early I just pictured myself completing my classes, going to the U, starting a career. I hate that this is anything but sound. I hate that there is a risk, I hate that there is a chance things might not work out.  Oh well. Now that I’m done fretting about my indefinite future I can explain where I’ve been for the however many days I’ve neglected to write. I truthfully don’t know how many, exactly, and I can’t find out. Right now I’m writing this on Microsoft word; we no longer have internet and I cannot update my blog. Rob was paying for the cable connection, and he left on Wednesday for his mission. Things are a bit quieter, but I miss the internet more than I miss him, to be completely honest. He and I are alike in the sense that neither of us sees a need to whine about each other when we honestly don’t care in that way. I love him and wish the best for him, but I’m not going to cry about the fact that I won’t see him till 2006. I admire what he’s doing and I’m not worried about him. I’ll write him though, occasionally.  Back to the internet connection problem- I don’t have any. We’re getting DSL soon but the parentals are slacking. That’s no good; I fulfill the slacker quota for this family and half of the Salt Lake Valley, we have no more room for idlers, dangit! I’m going to nag the living existence out of them until they get me my internet. I don’t think I could subsist without internet, I honestly doubt it. I don’t think I could. After about a week or so I would spontaneously combust and leave my tattered remains behind as a manifestation of weakness yet held potency. This is not a comfort item, but a matter of life or death. I need my internet! AAHHHHHHHH! I NEED THE INTWARWEB!  Until then I supposed I’ll be twaddling about Microsoft word, only to submit dateless entries upon the glorious morn of the internet’s return to my house. Huh.  Yeah- so it turns out a whole bunch of people have been reading my blog. Dave (apparently in polite revenge for my not calling him or some other rationalization like that), Joel (only an entry or two) Jeff (Not sure, but he commented about NZ, and speak of the devil) NZ did too. Whatever. I don’t really care, but it’s kind of weird that NZ found out that I really was obsessed with him and I wasn’t kidding when I told him that I think he’s sexy. More awkward still is the fact that it’s completely physical and that I’m not too impressed with his belief system or his convictions, and that I wrote about it. That’s okay- I’m LDS, I’m sure he thinks the same thing. We’re buddies, even if he doesn’t come to physics anymore.  I’m not too taken back by the fact that they got hold of my blog. I still retain the opinion that I’m quite possibly the most dull, monotonous person in existence, so if they yearn to read about it for whatever twisted reason they have my best wishes. I don’t think they’ll keep reading it anyway, so I hope it explained some things to them. I must be a very confusing entity to behold; I hope my blog enlightened them. Despite the fact that it can be such utter bliss, oblivion has the power to agitate and disturb.  My spring break was excruciatingly superb, how I dread returning to school! I’m too content with doing nothing to bear the last two months of school. I want to become a hermit and eat grass and assorted tree bark for the rest of my life, do nothing but breathe and taste of freedom’s sweetest fruits. Laziness is my vice and languor is my beloved adversary, I will fight them until the day I die. (Especially when I eat mizithra and ice cream when I work, like I did tonight).  Nikka Costa is actually a really cool singer. “Everybody got their something” is the trendy popular song that enthused investigation, “corners of my mind” is my favorite. Her voice can be very annoying, but sounds so cool in “corners of my mind”. I’m listening to her on my beautiful MP3 player that my daddy brought back to me, I’m so happy to have it back. I need to name it.   I shall call it Bartholomew the expressive.   Oh hush up- I never claimed to be sane.    Carter and I are dating now, and I’m very happy when I’m with him. I adore him, I respect him, and I feel affection for him. It all seems too delightfully self explanatory to explain. I’ll leave you with that.  I’m going to work on my drivers ed. *shakes fist pathetically*     ************************************************************************  (The rest are dateless. Bear with me)  I just got back from a runway show. Ugh. It was matrix, and I got to wear two incredible couture gowns, but it was work. Over a span of two days a team of 17 people spent 8 hours and 45 minutes on my hair. Yes, they did dye it a shade darker, and I love it by the way, but the other 6 hours were completely superfluous. Stupid perfectionists. Stupid hairdressers.  Carter and I decided to, er, part. We’re not dating anymore, in any case. I knew it wouldn’t have worked- he wants something serious and I don’t steady date- but I enjoyed our time together ever so much. I’ll miss being with him in that sense, but it’s for the best. I’ll still see him. He could get mushy at times anyway. How sad. Oh well; it will still be a while until any event or person will be capable of shattering my unadulterated apathy and capturing my emotion and trust. I don’t become attached; that’s stupid at this point in time. I don’t get hurt; I’m lazy, and would rather not deal with the heart-wretching yadda yadda yadda. Meh. I know I don’t worry about it…  What a blithe mood I’m in! I feel so unconcerned, so indifferent. Blasé and nonchalant, I sit here slumped in my chair with my beautiful dark hair swirling about my undisturbed face. That’s it- I refuse to write. I’m watching batman…  ************************************************************************  Yes- My family is full of slackers. It’s Sunday, April 25, and we still don’t have the intarweb. We won’t until the 29th. I will have gone two entire weeks without it. Applause, please. It sucks though; I wasn’t born as a being meant to live without internet access. It simply was not meant to be. My blog and my email are stamped on my mind, vogue.com flows through my veins.   Krishna, I’m a geek.  Anyway, my reluctant return to East High wasn’t quite the excruciating agony I had anticipated. Back to the salt mine kind of deal; the inevitable drop back into the monotony of lackluster living. I’ve got less than two months left till summer at any rate; the checkered flags at the finish line are in sight. After two summer classes I shall be done with high school, completely finished. The agony I feel when surrounded by the petty will dim, the tediousness of the majority of my work will diminish.       And then I will go to another institute of education that I will learn to hate and despise, and all will be well, I’m sure.  Okay- I’m going to go talk to my daddy using the evil dial-up we have on the other comp. Dial-up is morbid and against so many of my principles, but it’s daddy. I love daddy.   ************************************************************************  So Carter and I are back together now. Huh.  I adore him. I spent all afternoon with him, just being with him. How could I do this? He’s such a romantic- this isn’t characteristic of me at all. A romantic? Come on now, what is this nonsense? Romance? How silly.  But it’s not. I love the time we spend together.   But I’m definitely not mawkish. I despise the maudlin in all their weepy glory, and the slushy sentiment they choose to submerge their existence in.  Hmmm… didn’t do a minute of homework today although I had hours begging to be invested in the academic absurdity that is East high. The illogicality of doing something as inane as homework is daunting, so I simply don’t do it. Instead I eat pop tarts with Carter.   I’m going to go to bed now. I’m going to have to get up at such an ungodly hour of the morn so that I feel slightly prepared at school. Meh. What rubbish.  ************************************************************************  I should be in my first period right now, but all we’re doing in Jr. Choir is measuring the men for their uniforms, and I’m a bad person, therefore I’m home instead. So here am I, sipping a slim fast, typing about nothing. Slim fasts are disgusting- no wonder they’re only 2 grams of fat; it doesn’t qualify as food. It’s icky.   But I’m hungry and determined to keep my gram allowance down to 41grams a day, so here I bitterly sip. Even though I’m still considered underweight for my height (I’m 5’8 ½’’ and I’m 122) I want to get back down to 115 again. I just think I look better lithe and healthy. Granted my new found “curves” are nice, but I hate having a semi-squishy stomach. How vexing. These shakes are categorically ghastly, but nothing comes without a price. Darn.  I’m going to Evita on Saturday. How marvelous; I simply can’t wait. News has it that the actress playing Evita is superb, so I’m not even worried about the Utah theatre debasing the play. Huzzah.        My family is the most incompetent social unit in the world. Honestly- I kid you not. They are so incredibly incapable it’s depressing, and the fact that I have to live with them depresses me still more. Argh.  Today I had no idea what time I was working. Usually I’m on at 4:30 or 5:00, so I asked my mother for a ride around 4:15. She made me promise to do some of her grading for her, and after the oath had been sworn I was whisked away to Spag. Upon arrival I found out that I wasn’t on call until 6:15, so I walked home. I returned by way of bus at 6:15 to find my mother there, furious. Apparently she had been looking for me for 3 hours and had called up every single persona she associated me with, completely freaking out. She got mad, and then stalked away back home.   I can understand why she’s worried. It makes sense. It’s frustrating, however, that I know she wouldn’t have freaked out if she didn’t think I was with Carter or Elisse. If the only danger was me getting kidnapped by some freak downtown she wouldn’t have cared. We’ve been in situations like this before, and she’s stayed calm, usually waiting for the problem to work itself out. It always has. Once in Cincinnati she left me at church, a 45 minute drive from our house. She noticed my absence the second she got on the freeway, but figured I was a nice competent 7 year old and that I would find my way home. I did. I always do. If it was me lying to her, however, she has to freak out and hunt me down. The more time she spends looking the better; more to get me in trouble with. How annoying. Can’t they just forget that I live here? Can’t they just pretend like they have no daughter? I want to move out so badly. I think I would fare much better in an apartment then in the arduous confinement of family life. Bah. I don’t think I’ll write my scarlet letter essay. We have a sub during first period tomorrow; I think I’ll just do it then. I don’t care. The bothers of school no longer worry me; there is now very little I can’t shrug off. I’m sure this isn’t a good thing; a terrible change if it be anything, but it feels absolutely divine to cast my academic cares into the black abyss of ennui and complete indifference.   I need to finish this, though. I just need to push through and take my SAT and ACT and finish my classes and graduate and get my license. Every action listed has to be done sooner rather than later, I know I need to do this. I don’t want to, though. An incredibly violent case of Spring fever is attacking me; we’re wrestling and I’m losing. Spring fever is just beating me and making fun of me and then beating me again. It’s a pleasurable defeat, however, so my resistance is nothing staggering. I just want to become a hermit and sleep in a cardboard box downtown, never to think again. Why am I craving my intellectual demise? See what spag and public education in Utah have done to me? I stand completely robbed of all ambition. Not my fault, though; why on earth would I own up to this when I can blame it on East high school’s utterly pathetic funding? That would be something an emotionally stable person would do, you silly Canadian…   We still don’t have the internet. Slackers. Stupid stupid slackers.   I can’t stand my own kind….

      It's okay- I haven't died quite yet. This being the longest respite from my daily blogging since I began it back it early Feb, I'm sure you dears have suspected a scandalous plan involving the British Mafia and a corn dog, but alas, my life is as monotonous as ever. Things have happened, mind you, so I suppose monotony isn't as dominant as I present it to be, but I still feel quite the same. A lot of things have happened, though. A lot a lot a lot. I've written about them, I've just been unable to post them because we don't have internet. ( Dial-up is in our home, but Dial-up simply isn't internet, but a morbid mockery of connection that serves chiefly to frustrate and blaspheme. I don't believe in dial-up, I just don't. It's evil.) I've been writing entries on Microsoft Word and will transport them as soon as we get DSL (If there is any type of deity in that big blue sky this glorious day will be tomorrow, but Jeff is slacking off so I don't know when this will happen).  I have a couple phone calls to make, so I'll leave you now. Farewell, dearest reader.

       Five days. A lot has happened in the five days since I last wrote. Explanations are anything but necessary; details would do nothing but clutter. An overview, however:   Daddy came. He arrived early on the 10th, left at 8:30 tonight. We talked about what we needed to talk about (i.e. moving out, etc.), went out to eat a couple of times. Since Rob leaves so soon I saw extraordinarily little of the man, which is a shame, but understandable.   I gathered with people, I met people.   I met Carter. I adore Carter. The image of him still burns fervently, yet my mind is restraining the picturesque face from flowing to my fingers and out to you, my dearest reader. He’s a poet. He’s a philosophe. He’s cute. Almost everything I would want, but whatever bond is indeed wrapping slowly around us is undeveloped. Today he met my mother, father, and Jeff. I wasn’t expecting this at all, and definitely didn’t desire it, but it went splendidly. I think my mother likes him, which I’m happy with. He’s a good guy, he’s very honest. He didn’t hold back anything from dear old mum, which I was surprised with. I admire him.   Oh- and NZ! Forgot all about the lad, though I’ve hung out with him a couple of times. Yes- he’s still sexy. He buzzed his Mohawk and now he’s very, very sexy. Elisse and him have a thing going on, I’m not going to endeavor to name it. Yeah- I definitely didn’t expect it, but there you go. I’m fine with that; the conversation I held with him about beliefs, religion, etc., confirmed my suspicion that the attraction I feel is purely physical, as it still is. Yes- we’re better friends now and he’s with Elisse, but he’s still sexy. Nice to look at, and I told him that today. Still sexy.  Elisse is incredibly sick, and is about to die. Not really, but she was hospitalized. She’s currently away getting better, I do hope she recovers.  I go to bed now. Farewell.

      Yes- ivory is tired. Whoever thinks that ivory should quit her job raise your hands now. Unanimous? Fantastic. I give my two weeks notice tomorrow.  Not.  Today was tiring. Went to school, failed my physics test, came home and went to work. The simple dread my life has contained lately is disheartening; the minimalism of my days exasperate me at times. I don’t know what I’m going to do. I’m going to graduate early, but what after that? Appalling visions of my career at Spag lasting into my 30s plague me every time I close at work, distracting me. Distraction is so ambiguous, it can be either good or bad depending what light you choose to view it in.   My writing lately has been pathetic, I know. But today is the first day of spring break, so it can only improve. I’m going to bed now, I’m tired.  Yeah-  urlLink these  are sexy.  really, really, REALLY sexy. Hmmm….shoegasm…

      I hate my family with an ardent passion that will never flicker or spoil. They're evil. They're all evil. It turns out that Robert deleted ALL of my music. ALL of it. He saved five dido songs. The rest is all gone. Stupid slut.  I'm going to move out. I leave this house or I leave mortality.   I can't stand these people anymore. They're prying, inconsiderate, and selfish. I've had it. Honestly, I have.

      meh. I don't feel like writing today. I went running and then decided to blow my good deeds away with 40 grams of Reese’s pieces, being the brilliant philosophe that I am.  My daddy comes in precisely 4 days. These last two school days need to come to a festinate end so that I can uphold this illusion of sanity, therefore preserving my plans for the weekend. I'm going to do something with Elisse and Joel and hopefully Dave. Dave's an absolute doll. I adore Dave.  This entry never really had a purpose anyway, so I've nothing against leaving you all now. Bubye!

      I wore my sexy new shoes today. They look 80s punk, but I wore nothing 80s punk with them today, so they did look a bit too saucy. That's okay, though- everyone knows I have daring tastes at times and everyone I talked to today loved them. I like my new shoes....  I adore John. I absolutely adore him. There was an assembly today; the first one I've been too all year. It was the Utah Shakespearean Festival players, they put on 12th night (hence the impetus behind my attendance.) Everyone around us got lost by the second scene, so decided to re-write the play into something more idiot-friendly. We've affectionately dubbed it "The adventures of Sir Toby and the other strange guy wearing yellow garters (tee hee hee hee)". Overall we think it will be a smash hit.  Production will start in a week.

      Do you dears remember the busser that I was in love with a while back? I believe I named him Claudio. Yes, that was it, Claudio.  Well, I didn't forget about him. He's still beautiful and reserved and perfect on the superficial levels. I think he quit, you see, and therefore hasn't been present at work to dominate my thoughts. A shame. Such a beautiful boy. It seems like everybody quit at spag, I feel like a veteran.  What ever did happen to Claudio? I'll keep you updated.

      What a perfect day I've had. Relaxing and peaceful, two emotions that have fled my life recently. Tomorrow I'm back to the rush and anxiety of school, and I'm sad to go. Spring break, however, is four short days away, although I'm sure I'll fall into a motionless time warp the second I step back into school. Daddy comes in six days on the tenth. He'll be here for most of spring break.   Random persons come everyday to see the house. Mum thinks we'll sell soon.  Rob leaves for Switzerland on the 14th.  In three months or so I'll graduate from High school.  My life is about to change.

      I woke to the blinding sun piercing my curtains and encasing me. I feel drowsy, but happy to see such a beautiful Sunday ahead of me. This weekend has been general conference, thus the fear I felt when walking into work yesterday. Conference weekend is infamous; busy to the max and yet mysteriously thought to be fun by everyone. Yesterday wasn’t too bad, but we got incredibly busy around 7:00. If the truth must be told, I did have a lot of fun. I was doing to gos, and I think they are the most superb things in the world. Everybody thinks I’m crazy, but they’re fun. I like doing something that the other employees actually view as work, and seeing how fast I can do them is amusing. I get tips, too ($3 for the entire night, how could I resist warming up to them?)  I didn’t like missing the conference, but I watched as much as I could. I watched half the first session, and I’ll be listening to all of them today. I love conference; yes, some times it can be unbelievably hard to stay awake, but I most of the talks are able to hold my attention. Dallin H. Oaks gave a fabulous talk on preparation, one I was very glad to hear. I think David B. Haight is going to die, poor man; he had to be practically carried onto the stand to then counsel the people in his feeble voice. That’s okay, the man is going to have a killer time after this life.   I feel lethargic today, very lethargic. I think I’ll take a walk and let the brisk wind whip up my senses and excite my awareness. Farewell.

      My finger lazily circles the rim of my glass as I sit in the back room, staring blankly at the massive mess before me. Garbage cans full of bread and spag, bags containing every kind of filth imaginable, and cardboard boxes litter the floor around me, composing the immaculate atmosphere that has become employee dining at OSF. I was grossed out at first, but eating in the dark with the trash is an everyday occurrence for those who labor at the spagfac, thus I have adapted and don’t know what I would do with myself if I came one day to find a clean back room. My break is stupid; dumb labor laws have made sure to inconvenience me in any way possible. I feel terrible about this outlook, really I do; child labor in the past was abominable, I’m thankful this country has done something about the calamity. But I’m not going to deny that having to take a break every 5 hours sucks. I’d rather work and get paid then sit in the back, pathetically eating my spumoni while my eyes linger tenaciously on the clutter surrounding me. It does give me time to think though, I’ll give you that. While slowly fiddling with my food I allow my mind to glaze over the occurrences of the day, my eyes lolled back, my demeanor sloppy. I’m sure the managers suspect I use this time to strategically shoot up in the bathroom and then proceed to enjoy my high talking to the garbage; I phase completely out, only to wake once my thirty minutes of unremitting stupor have silently slipped by. Sometimes I don’t remember what thoughts and amusements run through my head, other times I dwell on them until the next day and beyond. I always remember the feeling, however, of immobility and incongruous stillness. It feels odd to have bussers and servers and hosts run about you, rushing to their food and yelling for follows and pick-ups, while you sit in a trance that borders on a coma. I don’t know if I like such a feeling, but I suspect I spend much more time in the unbefitting state then I think.  I stare at the cracks in the ceiling as my mind mulls over my actions today. Today I had a talk about religion with NZ and this boy we’ll call S. NZ is sexy, but I’m afraid he strikes me as a wee bit dim at times. Its funny that he comes across as so open minded yet hardly debates as such. He felt no need to support what he was saying and kept handling certain technicalities and personal beliefs as fact when, in any light, they were opinion. “But that’s stupid; the God head is one being.” He would roll his eyes at certain remarks he didn’t agree with, and then fallaciously inform me that I was wrong and fail to offer an explanation. I was disappointed. I think that he’s smart, and yet I stand overwhelmed by this outlandish folly exuded by him. S was nice about it, and politely disagreed. I think I like the boy- he’s adorable and so very very sweet. He’s funny, too. Why, oh why, does he have to smoke a chart-topping amount of pot a day? Elisse thinks I’m “playing” him. I’m not sure what she means by such a statement, because I’m afraid I don’t correspond with the conventional definition of a player at all. Yes, I’m nice to the boy and I esteem him and his beliefs, I flirted with him today. I like him, but I hate the fact that he’s a stoner. A very big stoner. This boy smokes a TON of weed. I still adore him, though.  I shrug and look down at my spumoni. The spumoni has begun to melt, the small portion of the ice cream that is still somewhat frozen bobs on the top of the melted cream, lulling about in the multi-colored pottage. I gape at the paste, stupidly wondering why anyone would ever dream of making pistachio ice cream. What an absurd idea. Huh. After school I didn’t do much at all. I came home, played some sims. I love that game. I’m building this house that is absolutely divine, I can’t wait to finish it. I never actually “live” in that game. Once I’ve finished the house I kill the inhabitants and leave the house standing as a lonely landmark to the career I have yet to begin. I do hope I become an architect. How absolutely corking that would be.  Mindlessly I glance down at my watch, realizing I have 30 seconds left of my break. This takes just a second to register, the realization slowly dawning on me. Forcefully I climb out of my buoyant reverie, peeking back to skim over the fruits of this session, which are now swimming lackadaisically in the palpable reality of my lunacy. I let the smallest of smiles escape from my tired lips, my eyes twinkling at my quirky mannerisms. I pick of my tray, drop my barely-touched spoon into the tub and return to work.

      I am unable to please. I set down my insecurities and my pride, attempting to put forth a semi-valiant effort to try, and I endeavor to assist those around me to find a relative state of contentment, but I can’t do it. Every angle is the wrong one, and every approach that I take is inappropriate. I am not troubled by this, however; when my desire to comfort is pure and sincere, I am assured in the fact that the confusion and happiness is one that cannot be repaired by me simply because the cause of such angst is something or someone other than myself. I give what I can, and that is all I can do. That is all that I care to do because it is unfair to ask me for more.   I have my friends that comfort me, that help me, but their enrollment in my recuperation is brief. I am appalled to find myself feeling this way, but after building so many well-planned walls and deceiving faces its frustrating to have to deal with the complete candidness of others. My source of strength is not found in anyone on this earth, and if I am ever consumed by the intrinsic gloom of the world I climb out of my black depths alone. Why must I always be the happy one? Why is the voice that greets me on the other side of the phone so dejected and drenched in self pity half the time? Do they have any freaking idea how all-embracing my despair can be? To play this off and to pretend does nothing but pull a sheer curtain over the problem, thereby allowing neglect to swell and magnify the pain. If they knew how truly strained my voice is at times when I laugh and try to lift their spirits, all while wiping the tears from my eyes during the chat on my cell, trying so hard to cheer.    Every time I jump from elation to despondency and back again I break. The panic that sweeps over me every time I feel this is sinister. It hurts. I realize, however, that the world can’t solve my problems. Why would I attempt to dump my cares on anyone else when only I can do anything to alter or obliterate them?   I don’t. Why does everyone else?

      I’ve decided to write more poetry. It just seems like the logical thing to do. My lackluster attempts at a novel died and died hard, but perhaps I simply started too big. I shall start with verse. Yes, that’s what I’ll do…verse… Honestly, what type of self-respecting person isn’t a poet? In poetry all things are discovered and found. How absolutely corking it is. There are many reasons for poetry, and yet so few boundaries. It can go horrendously wrong if done incorrectly, true, and there are mounds and mounds of bad poetry, but I like the idea. hehehe  Mum and I are going house shopping tomorrow. I really don’t want to stay in the valley; the word is my playground and how I yearn to play! Utah is silly, what type of geese would stay in Utah? Silly goose…  Yawn. I’m tired. What I am writing is so scattered and senseless, and I’m bothered by it. I’ll go ahead and post it, however; one’s view of me must be complete if it is to be correct.

      I entered a poem into a contest today. It was interesting; I rarely write poetry, and when I do I guard it like a precious disease. But if I'm not open with my blog, then why would I bother to write in it?     Plea  Why must you press me? Isn’t it enough to know that I won’t speak? My thoughts are my thoughts, my one belonging; these utterances that dance within me are the pillars of my certainty. Do not push, my love:  be patient and wait and then,  only then, can you claim that you know and love me. Do not pull me. Please, my passion, my dear, do not demand. My adoration will melt, will soften and spread and grow thin, dripping and fading away,  running from you fluidly, promptly, completely. And like snow in the early spring I will leave you dry and warm, safe for a season, but alone.

      Once again, I am awake at an extremely ungodly hour of the morning. Today I’m going to church with Carter, then I plan to proceed to attend my church as usual, which means I’ll be at church for 7 hours today (I kid you not- I’ll be with Carter from 10.00 to 1.00, then I will be at my church from 1.00 to 4.00, and then I’ll be at a leadership meeting until 5.30, so in all actuality I will attend church for 7.5 hours today) If I O.D on veneration, send in a recovery mission and retrieve me.

      Tonight I hung out with Jo& co. Don’t exactly know what to think. Surprisingly enough, I had fun. It was surprising. Hence the adjective preceding the word “enough”. It’s a good thing I’m not redundant, huh?  I haven’t seen Carter much this week. This makes me sad; I like seeing my Carter. But oh well, since his parents took his truck back to their cabin I finally see how big a problem transportation can be. He’s really down right now. It appears as if he’s been as such for the last couple of weeks, or at least when he’s talked to me during this time, which comprises around a third or a fourth of the time that I’ve known him. It’s truly weird to think that I met him a month and a half ago. It’s also weird to think that I met him at a party at Frank’s house, of all places. This is amusing; yesterday Abbey and I discussed the problem of meeting people on a UTA bus. Generally this is simply a terrible idea for many reasons, which are made apparent the second one chooses to view the occupants of the bus. Usually smelly, dirty, and fond of talking to themselves, those who ride UTA make a diverse, yes, but odd and brooding crowd. You don’t make approaches when on a bus, you just don’t. It doesn’t matter how beautiful or nicely-clothed they are, it’s an unwritten rule that they are off limits as long as they are sitting on the worn blue fabric of a UTA bus seat. It’s kind of the same dealie with a party at Frank’s house: you know some people but you don’t attend to “meet” someone. Come on, it’s Frank. Interesting guy, yes, but not one to establish communications through.    I’m tired. I woke early today (7 freakin’ O’clock, it was dreadful to be up at such an ungodly hour of the morn) and I’m pretty much beat. I have to wake up early tomorrow, too; I’m going with Carter to his church at 9:30 and then attending mine (that’s like 8 hours of church. I am SO going to heaven…) and I’ll have to wake up around 8. This is my long weekend! Why can’t I sleep in? Why?  Oh- yes. Mum and I went house shopping today. We went all over the valley and saw a multitude of gorgeous houses, and it hit me for the first complete time that I’m moving. In four weeks we have to be out of the house, and I’ll never again wake up to see the sun pour through my familiar window, falling over me as the friendly birds chirp and whistle to greet me. I have 4 Saturdays left, 4 more times this will happen to me. How I’m going to miss it! I’m glad we sold the house and made such a wonderful profit (50 grand, heck yeah!) but I’m going to miss it all the same. If I were silly and sentimental and attached this would just break my heart, but fortunately I’m not, so I’ll stand back and say “Pity”. Honestly. Either that or “huh”, in memory of our dear friend George Costanza.   I think I shall retire to bed now. Perhaps I’ll eat first, but hopefully not, considering that I’m not hungry and that I’d be eating just for the sake of eating itself, which is pathetic. I’m going to run to bed before I succumb to the beckonings of the random artificial-flavored pastries that inhabit my cabinet. Run AWAY!!!!

      THE SECOND BOOK OF NEPHI  CHAPTER 8 In the last days, the Lord shall comfort Zion and gather Israel—The redeemed shall come to Zion amid great joy—Compare Isaiah 51 and 52:1-2. [Between 559 and 545 B.C.]  1 HEARKEN unto me, ye that follow after righteousness. Look unto the rock from whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit from whence ye are digged.  2 Look unto Abraham, your father, and unto Sarah, she that bare you; for I called him alone, and blessed him.  3 For the Lord shall comfort Zion, he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving and the voice of melody.  4 Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation; for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a blight for the people.  5 My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arm shall judge the people. The isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust.  6 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment; and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner. But my salvation shall be forever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.  7 Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart I have written my law, fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.  8 For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool. But my righteousness shall be forever, and my salvation from generation to generation.  9 Awake, awake! Put on strength, O arm of the Lord; awake as in the ancient days. Art thou not he that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?  10 Art thou not he who hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?  11 Therefore, the redeemed of the Lord shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy and holiness shall be upon their heads; and they shall obtain gladness and joy; sorrow and mourning shall flee away.  12 I am he; yea, I am he that comforteth you. Behold, who art thou, that thou shouldst be afraid of man, who shall die, and of the son of man, who shall be made like unto grass?  13 And forgettest the Lord thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth, and hast feared continually every day, because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? And where is the fury of the oppressor?  14 The captive exile hasteneth, that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.  15 But I am the Lord thy God, whose waves roared; the Lord of Hosts is my name.  16 And I have put my words in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion: Behold, thou art my people.  17 Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the Lord the cup of his fury—thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling wrung out—  18 And none to guide her among all the sons she hath brought forth; neither that taketh her by the hand, of all the sons she hath brought up.  19 These two sons are come unto thee, who shall be sorry for thee—thy desolation and destruction, and the famine and the sword—and by whom shall I comfort thee?  20 Thy sons have fainted, save these two; they lie at the head of all the streets; as a wild bull in a net, they are full of the fury of the Lord, the rebuke of thy God.  21 Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, and not with wine:  22 Thus saith thy Lord, the Lord and thy God pleadeth the cause of his people; behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again.  23 But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; who have said to thy soul: Bow down, that we may go over—and thou hast laid thy body as the ground and as the street to them that went over.  24 Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city; for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.  25 Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit down, O Jerusalem; loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.

      Every soul has his or her limits. There comes a time when the pressure and the pain overwhelms you, when the confusion leaves you so lost that you lose all hope and cease to care. There comes a time when the battle dies down, and the opponent you love so dearly begs on bended knee, yet you can’t stop. The knowledge of right and wrong that you possess does nothing but burden you further, the responsibility of truth presses down on you so hard that you have no choice but to raise the knife and plunge it again and again into the gasping chests of those you adore. They plead in front of you, after giving their life and possibilities for you, but you can’t stop. You feel unworthy of humanity, you feel low and dirty and typical, in a land where heroes lie few and far between, extinguished suddenly and forgotten quickly.  Do I see point in preserving those around me? When I am consumed by my rage and the inequity that surrounds me I can’t, I simply can’t care. I see no worth in what I have to lose, so I bet it all.      And yet, through this thick mist of anguish and alarm my solace beams with brilliance unrivaled. My strength, my rock stands true. What I know is unchanging and dependable, and for this I am grateful.  I think Carter’s right: It takes much more faith to be an atheist than a Christian or a Buddhist or any type of individual that believes in a deity. How can one’s faith lie in the hand of man? How can a race so frail and delusional be trusted? How can you look into your life and know that your meaning lies in only what you see?  My savior, my comfort. I love thee and I will love thee forever. If I trust in thee I cannot fail, and you shall comfort Zion’s wasteplaces.

      I'm at Lutheran High School right now. I came to see my mom teach, but came so late that I barely saw the last 10 minutes of her last class. Oh well. She wasn't really teacing today, anyway, so not much lost. We're going to go look at houses in Orem now, so fare thee well.

      So I’m trying to edit my sidebar so that it says some more stuff. After fiddling and inserting and reformatting and twaddling I get frustrated and decide to delete the entire side bar section in the template.  And lo and behold, it turned out just how I wanted it.   Huh.

      Oh Blogger! You sexy, sexy program, you. So much better than live journal! So much! So very very much! Yay blogger!  Of course I'll be cursing you again the second my ineptitude befuddles my blogging experience, but until then you're just dandy in my book!  I’ve discovered photo-blogging, you see, and I can almost use it completely. How absolutely lovely! Pictures on a blog! Who knew? There are some things that continue to perplex me, mainly one thing: I want to put my picture on my profile and simply don’t know how. How do I find the URL to the picture that blogger posted for me? Where did it go? Where is the URL? Did I lose the URL? What happened to the URL? I grow discouraged about the URL (yes, Al Franken, we love you…).  This is definitely NOT good for my blog, though. Finally all of you will see how truly narcissistic I am. I kid you not. I am completely in love with myself, I am. I could lie to you and pretend to be humble and all that jazz, but what’s the point? I’m sure you’ve figured it out by now. I am THE MOST SELF CENTERED PERSON IN THE WORLD! Starving children in Africa? What did you say? Oppressed refugees back east? Poor defenseless animals? What? You’re not speaking my language, darling. I understand the following, and the following only: ME! Wheeeee…..    Yeah….I’m a bad person….Oh well. At least I flaunt it and revel in it. Surely there’s some merit in that.   I’m going to go see if I can fix my profile. Then eat a pop tart. Then pass out on my couch.  OH! The possibilities!

      I’m feeling adventurous right now. I’m tired and dead but I feel like running and breaking against the wind, diving into spontaneity. I’m feeling abstract and misunderstood, but I’m happy this way. I don’t think I’d ever appreciate someone who didn’t find me to be a puzzle, complex and strong in her concealed existence, yet always about to collapse.   These feelings could mark a significant change in my life, or could just be what happens when you listen to Portishead while you write. What are you going to do?  I’m going to go watch a movie and pass out on my couch. I’m so pissed off right now- the internet on our beautiful computer isn’t working, and the connection on the crappy computer works but it’s so slow I can barely surf. Argh!

      Physics was amazing today. We began the class with an interesting lab; we made ice-cream in a conventional ice-cream maker and related it back to conduction and states of matter and all that jazz. It was fun, and we made some killer strawberry ice-cream. The most stupefying bit of it, however, began when Mr. Christiansen pulled out the liquid Nitrogen and pouring it on the tables and fun stuff like that. It was awesome.  So Carter’s kind of depressed right now. His school won’t let him walk in graduation because he failed some classes and has to make up credits. It’s sad, but at the same time it’s what happens to those of us who slack off. It’s a beautiful life, yes, but it does have its consequences. I can’t say I understand the depression, though. I’m choosing not to walk because it’s absurdly inane. As if I’m going to pay money to rent an incredibly unsightly cap and gown so that I can suffer through the 3 hour graduation ceremony. I would pay money to not go! I’m apathetic that way, what can I say…  I’m going to go work on drivers-ed, and then go running. I leave you dearies now, bubye!

      Annie Lennox Keep Young And Beautiful Lyrics  What's cute about little cutie? It's her beauty, not brains... Old father time will never harm you if your charm still remains...  After you grow old baby, you don't have to be a cold baby...  Keep Young and Beautiful, It's your duty to be beautiful... keep young and beautiful, if you want to be loved.  Don't fail to do your stuff with a little powder and a puff.  Keep young and beautiful if you want to be loved.  If you're wise, exercise all the fat off, take it off, off of here, off of there... when you're seen anywhere with your hat off, wear a Marcel wave in your hair...  Take care of all those charms, and you'll always be in someone's arms keep young and beautiful if you want to be loved.  Disgusting, yes, but so hillarious!

      Just called my agency. The Acting division is completely swamped with jobs right now and what do the models got? Nadda.  Oh well. The little modeling work that I've done I haven't really enjoyed. The pay is great, but it's somewhat annoying to have so many people swarming about you. I almost prefer to be the swarmer (see 1st job, i.e spag)  Didn't do much today. I have a whole bunch of homework that I have to do, and I really really don't want to do it. Homework is so freaking mormon, you know?  My, how scattered my thoughts are! Here's a little bit of me over here, and some more over there, and LOOK! Behind the barrel- more ME!!! YAY!!! Anyways, my blog is a whore. It's always been as such, and always will be. I'm the blog’s pimp, you see, so our relationship is bittersweet, I suppose. Yeah- I'm a darn sexy pimp, what can I say? Oh yes- why my blog is a whore. On my profile it won't display this blog. It will display the other two which have a whole (you better sit down for this) 5 entries. I want to display this one and it won't let me so it is a whore. Stupid mexican jew lizard.  If I keep on writing I soon going to debase myself to the point that I'll have no reason to exist. So I need to stop. Right.....now!

      Oh my. I am so very frustrated. So very. The reason is as follows:  	Last night Elisse spent the night at my house. We had a splendid time, how I adore that girl! She picked me up from work, we went to emigration and then to Wendy’s. After ascertaining the best and finest grease-slabbed victuals available we went to Uintah elementary school and ate the food, dumped the remains and other trash in the parking lot and drove off. I had a corking time, really.   	We watched batman, went to sleep, woke up. We decided to write Rob, and spent the remainder of the afternoon making stamps out of potatoes. (don’t ask- mum’s from Texas, you see…) At approximately 11:41 I get a message from carter:  “Melissa just asked me out…Whoh…Weird”   Alright….What does one say when their boyfriend sends them a text like this? I suppose the possibilities are endless, but honestly, what does one say? Can I be serious about this, truly, can I? Do I remind him “You’re talking to your girlfriend, halfwit.” or what? I decided that the best approach is a comical one, since the question was somewhat lacking in tact. So, I respond, while laughing ferociously with Elisse:  “Go for it! Score!!!”  To be honest, it sounded like a good response at the time. Well, it sounded funny at the very least. I sent this at 11:43. At 11:48, a good 5 minutes later I get:  “Huh?”  I was so very tickled by this. I had to pursue it, honestly I did:  “Take one for the team, my man!”   3 minutes later my phones rings and I pick it up to see:  “Who is this? And where is my girlfriend?” written on the face of my phone. I laugh about this and continue my endeavor to embellish my potato-stamp.  Well, it turns out that a girl asked him out, and upon “seeing my reaction”, he considered it. He called me during church and asked me   C: “What should I tell her?”  Me: “Who? Melissa?”  C: “Yeah”  Me: “well…you kind of have a girlfriend…”  C: “Yes I do, and that’s what I initially intended to tell her, but when you wrote what you did…”  Me (thinking): What? Do you actually think I was serious? Could you not sense the sarcastic jest in which my utterances were saturated? I thought it a given you would say no. You have a girlfriend, smart one. Me (saying): I was kidding, Carter. Are you actually considering this?  It turns out that he was, and still is. Apparently it would be a double-date, although it initially was a one-on-one kind of deal, the kind of deals that are for SINGLE guys. Hello! Girlfriend! Carter, my love, are you listening? You have a girlfriend, silly. Granted, she didn’t want to become as such, because she doesn’t like to steady date, but she did and now you want to date Melissa?  I told him to go ahead. I am, after all, going to EFY and camp and Cincinnati and all those other fun summer things that are only truly savored if done while in single-tude. And I’m fine with this, but vexed by the fact that on Friday, less than 42 hours ago, he told me that he would love me till the day he died. We had a big long conversation about this, and he said that. He said that he loved me and that he did it completely.  Hello?!?!? Know you the definition of love? Do you, my dear?   Whatever. I’m frustrated. Are guys always this stupid? Are they always the kind of stupid that makes one want to spell it “stoooooopid” just so that the entirety of the stupidity is impressed upon the viewer completely? When you see the word “stooooooopid”, it’s impossible to doubt the stupidity. The stupidity is genuine and undamaged when represented by such spelling. That’s what this is: this incident is “stoooooopid” worthy, which is quite something to be. The stupid is all there. There’s simply not one ounce that lacks stupid, therefore the occurrence is not only stupid, but it is “stoooooopid”.     Honestly, pull yourself together, man!

      Sleep deprived and tired, I yawn as I sit in my desk in trig class. I talked with Elisse for an hour last night at around 1, so my yawns force themselves out from my chest frequently and sporadically. I’m really happy that I still have my dearest little Elissie. How dear to my heart she is. To truly have someone who understands, who offers comfort in face of troubles unspoken, who realizes the mentality and mindset in which I dwell, is such a reassurance. The conversation we held last night was no longer awkward and uncomfortable, but relaxed and extremely easy to enjoy. This doesn’t change the fact, however, that it transpired during the most ungodly of early hours, so here I sit, yawning and stretching, struggling to stay awake.   I half-haphazardly listen to the conversation Jo and Anita are holding, and my eyes wander around the room with no goal or sight to capture. Jon is discussing Canadians with Mrs. Nagle, who’s currently harboring 3 at her house. EasTV, the student-directed and student-produced news show of East high school, turns on. Normally I’m vexed by this. I see little/no point in EasTV, and I’m burned by the fact that it’s held during one of my few classes in which the teacher actually teaches. The show acts mainly to exist as yet another petty, sentimental procedure that robs students and teachers of class time. Jo informs me that this is the last EasTV, so it will probably be long and drawn out. AAArrgh.  After a couple reports about absolutely nothing, a boy turns the time over to Jamie, a talented video-graphics genius in my ward. I perk up for this. He’s incredible with a camera, he is. I don’t know how to name his piece; it was simply a well-made clip show of the most random events related to east high. There were shots of football games, random pictures from the hallways, a clip of me shrieking my heart out on the stage of Take 5, videos of the dances and regular student life. Kudos to you, Jamie.  Regularly I would roll my eyes and simulate the symptoms of bronchitis upon witnessing such sentiment, but rather I enjoyed it. It was a quality piece, and didn’t focus on one part of student life. This seemed to make everything less petty, all the rituals and ceremonies less ridiculous, even my classes now had worth. This is the last EasTV I’ll ever see. In two weeks I’ll burst through the side doors of this school and never return. Out of the 2,030 students enrolled in East High School, I’ll continue to see 10 of them or so. This population will not matter come June 4th, for me it will cease to exist. How can something that held so much weight in my life disappear in one fleeting moment? So easily!  How incredible. My high school career is almost over. Over.   Splendid…

      Do you remember our dear friend Heather? The one who decided to publish her thoughts on the internet and I decided to blast them apart with unadulterated cruelty? Apparently she's depressed, or something. It's a good thing I'm somewhat of a sociopath and sadist, or something as silly as this would actually bother me. That would be stupid...  Surprisingly enough I've kept up with her blog. Not that it's really entertaining; the writing is still as horrid as ever. I did like this little tidbit, though. I think it's a song, or something, but I'm too lazy to find out so I'll just hand the credit over to her.  “Let’s make love when we understand the consequences, Let’s make love under the stars we pray, Let’s make love with heart and minds, Let’s skip making love to save the love.”  cliché, I know, but nice.  Oddly enough, it’s nice.

      There are times when one looks at his or her life and realizes that he/she simply isn’t doing enough. As a human being, I feel as if my potential is wasting away into bitter nothingness. Not in my academia nor in my work, but simply as my ongoing role as a daughter of God. Where much is given, much is expected, and I have been given so much. I know exactly what I need to do, and yet I find myself not doing it. This is terrible, absolutely terrible, but I feel a need to list them. Oh my….  Things I need to change in my life:  1. First and foremost: Honesty. I think it quite possible that I am the most dishonest person in the world. I kid you not. I lie all the freaking time. Big things, small things, important things, stupid things. At times I find myself lying without rhyme or reason, for no reason at all. It’s quite possible that I’m a pathological liar, but I can control what I say enough to establish some integrity in myself. What vexes me the most about this is the fact that this has never bothered me at all; I’ve simply accepted it as an easy way of living, a low way of living. I’ve already taken steps to approach and solve this dilemma: lately I’ve forced myself into becoming more honest and I’ve decided to be completely sincere when dealing with my mother. We’ve finally reached an understanding in our relationship that I plan to honor with nothing but my utmost authenticity and sincerity of heart. Still, I have so little scruples when it comes to honesty, and this maddens me.   2. My treatment of those who love me is something I am currently ashamed of. I’ve been treating my family like crap. Poor, poor family. My mum has done so much for me, and yet I know not what she has given. How easily I take this for granted and push her away. I still don’t agree with certain rules and I despise the way I become her outlet for many of her frustrations. She deserves respect, however. She does.  3. I’m still so sadistic! I can’t help the fact that I delight in the disturbances of those around me.    4. Selfishness. Not in the conventional sense, but just in the fact that I haven’t really been prayerful about any of the decisions I’ve made lately. True belief is followed by trust, which is then followed by devotion. How far must I deviate before I realize which way I yearn to go? I am told by multitudinous voices in my head and in my being that I’ve truly found the path I wish to follow, the one that can bring me that one place I’ll sincerely call “home”, if you will.   What folly my life is! How foolish of me, to trust in the hand of man as opposed to the hand that created me! What am I doing? I am nothing alone; my belief doesn’t define me but it does support me, it does sustain me. My divinity, my deity, my God! I love thee now as I shall forever. In the arms of those above I feel foolish and imprudent, but never inadequate, never unloved, never unwanted.  Time is too fragile and beyond my grasp to predict. I don’t know what lies ahead of me, and I don’t really think I want to. It is imperative, however, that I find passion in living what I know, in becoming who I want to be. The money doesn’t matter, who I stand next to is inconsequential, what I do is insignificant. To be a useful servant in the eyes of He that reigns supreme is all I truly, honestly long to be. All the rest will follow, all the rest will work.   This I know to be true.

      The bat returned yesterday. She burst through the front door in all her dotty glory, bearing kooky gifts for even the most immobile of the family (Boris). I graciously accepted the pair of flip-flops she gave to me; they’re quite adorable, if I say so myself. She was so happy to see me (upon hearing that I’m a registered runaway she grew incredibly worried about me. OH! I FORGOT TO TELL YOU! I’m a registered runaway. To make a long story short: mum wanted me home and I told her I had decided against it, so I stayed with a friend for a night. I came home to a scared, tired family and the news that I was a registered runaway for one beautiful day. I’ll write about it later) She toddled up to me as quickly as her old, fragile legs would allow and threw her arms around me.   “I’m so glad you’re safe!” She said exasperatedly. “I ran away once. Ended up in a swamp. It was terrible…” Upon remembering this occurrence she seemed to forget all about her fears concerning me and my runaway tendencies, and twaddled back down the stairs after patting Boris three times on the head. Loony, eccentric, and just plain odd, but nice to have around after a month of near-sanity in my house (yeah right).     It’s late. I leave you all now to delve into the inexact realms of unconsciousness. I plan to do this right after consuming plentiful amounts of over-the-counter allergy medication. My nose is trying to kill me, see. Hmmm…little pink pills, how I adore you….

      I started another  urlLink blog , on which I intended to start my novel. I do plan to be published by 2006, and I figured I needed to get started. After 4 entries, though, I look over them and find them to be pointless. Beautiful and well-crafted, mind you, but pointless all the same. I embarked on this expedition to begin my first novel and to speak out against obsession, but mainly to start a first novel. This lack of motivation (or at least the existence of WRONG motivation) is quite apparent in my writing. It’s so very pretty, but says nothing. The complex and abstract words form together seamlessly as a veil, attempting fruitlessly to hide the emptiness of the piece. The flow is lovely, but does it say? I’ve written less than two pages, so it’s not as severe as it could be, but it’s going to need meaning at one time or another. Were I to continue, I doubt such value would float into my words and justify their existence accidentally. The crux of the situation, therefore, is as follows: I have no political or moral or sociological conviction to propagate or convey. I have morals, yes, but have I a stand to take through this book? Will there be a true impetus to push this book into existence? What exactly am I trying to say?  I look at the rubbish literature around me and wonder why I bother will such folly as merit and worth. So much trash has been published, so much! It’s terrible to think that I have to extend effort. I’m an elitist, darn it! Not only should I dream up something brilliant in my sleep, but I shouldn’t have to write it down while in consciousness. It all should happen after I pass out on my bed/couch/front desk at Spag. Yes…sleep….   I’m going to go running with Joel and Frank. I’m excited; these people will push me to run more and make me skinny. Huzzah!    urlLink

      I didn't do any homework tonight. I didn’t really have any, but I think I could have been much more productive. That’s okay, though; it’s nice to lay back and do as I please. Today I went to BDs with Joel and Jeff and Ian and Elisse, and the heart-pounding fruits found in this hole-in-the-wall eatery are exquisite. The fiddles are filling and nummy and oh so bad for you. It was fabulous.  I’ve decided I want to be published by the year 2006, but I’ve discovered that my attempts of this so far have all been common in their necessities: it needs a point. My description is fabulous and melodious and beautiful, but supports nothing. Blah. I’m to lazy to discover my inner drives and convictions. I’d much rather partake in my goddess, my diety, my master: luscious words.   Carter’s on the other computer working on homework. I think I’m going to go give him a hug and turn in soon; I’m so very tired.  Elisse got a new job. A holy, glorious, sensational new job. Get this: She’s got a job at this store called haight, and she’s getting paid entirely in shoes. I kid you not: $10 an hour towards store credit. Obviously this isn’t for the mother trying to raise a family, but for the fashionable teenager that would blow her money at the store anyway. If you think about it, it’s saving you the time and the trouble one must go through to cash a check. And since time is money, the job actually SAVES her money. I think I should work there…  I’m going to go hug Carter now. Bubye

      I'm in such a good mood right now. Whoooo, I am just SO loopy! The world is my playground...  Today I was an absolute wench to half the people who crossed my path. It was terrible, yet so very, very amusing. Ha hahahaha- I'm insensitive and inconsiderate. awesome.  Anyway, I suppose I'll endeavor to settle down so that I might inform my few neglected readers what is going on. Currently I am still a slacker who sucks at updating her blog. So what? Do you have a problem with that, you stupid Canadian...Wait, no. I'm seriously trying to be serious. It's just not working.  Elisse sat down in the park and discussed what was happening. She felt I wasn't exerting enough effort into our relationship, which, I might add, was a 125% true. I suck at calling people and making plans and keeping them. I'm sorry! So I've decided to expend effort towards this one cause because I adore my little Elissie. So I'm going to start calling her and making plans and keeping them and so on and so forth. Let it be written, let it be done.  Still so very elated upon beholding Carter. So cute. So sensitive. So mine.  I'm trying very hard to graduate. I've attended all my classes since my run-in with Sadler, and I am quite proud of this.  I have 3 weeks until I’m finished with the arduous confinement of high school. And then I’m done! Whooopee!   Okay- this isn’t working. I’m too loopy. I’m so very off today. I’m just insane. I’m having one of my highs right now that come with my manic depressive nature. Weeeeeeee…how I love them. I need to get to bed, though, before I slip out of my trance and fall into the trough of realization and dark hopelessness that intuitively follows. Oh no, trying to articulate such a tragedy will inevitably bring it about!!! We can’t let this happen! Quick- something funny, absurd, anything! What shall I write about?   How about Maile and Jeff’s break-up? Funny story, that. What with my being a terrible, terrible person and doing something terribly, terribly immature during their break-up, it’s bound to make me giddy. Yes- I’m a bad person…

      Scrunching my nose, I look blankly at the screen in front of me. Here am I: desirous to write yet unwilling to analyze. My life speeds ahead rapidly with such force that I’m afraid of falling off my path and having to watch my train of promise chug quickly away. Ha. That’d be funny.  I finally got in trouble for never going to class. Upon seeing my midterm, my mum decided to book a charming little meeting with East High’s assistant principal, Mr. Sadler. Sadler, a jovial, yet down-to-business kind of man is an interesting guy. Upon seeing my squeaky clean record he was good-natured and ebullient, but something tells me that I would have found him to be very different indeed if I fell into the troublemaker caste of East high. He basically told me to go to every class from now until the end of school and he’d help me to graduate, but if not he would make my life perdition and give my mother permission to sit in with me during class for a week. Thus, I have and am planning to attend every single class in which I am enrolled. Stupid class…   Carter’s still all romantic and cute and amorous like. One of these days I’ll write a serious piece about what he really means to me: an articulate Carter-Rachael manifesto type of dealie. I’m too content with him, though, I’d rather not complicate it by trying to vocalize it. It’s so simple: I adore him and I love him and he makes me happy. He’s my poet. He really is the type of guy I want to marry. (Don’t worry: I’m sixteen and we are NOT in Kentucky, so I’ve still got a decade of single-ness or so)  Elisse and I are having problems. Once again, we’re drifting and it’s not good. She’s getting so snide and rude about it, however, that it makes it hard for me to grasp what I’d be fighting for a times. If she’s going to be so unhappy no matter what then what’s the point? She wrote an entry in her blog the other day and stated “Thank heavens I have a real best-friend” (in reference to another person). I could weep and mourn about this, but if that’s that, then that’s that. She’s getting so rude in her tone and text messages, she makes it easy for me to read something like this, say “huh”, and give Maile and Jane a call.     I sleep in tomorrow! I got so little sleep this week, this is a monumental incident indeed.   Oh beautiful, intoxicating sleep! Steal me away and never return me. Lift me up on your subtle wings and carry me into the inner depths of my mind, never to resurface into the bitter wind that is reality. How I adore thee! How I crave the fulfillment I find in your emptiness! The refreshment, the awakening, the peace! Oh sweet and bitter sleep, how I adore thee! To wake with the sun pouring through my window and dripping onto my bodice is a rare one I’ve come to love, one that I clean my room up the night before just so that the moment can be as picturesque as humanely possible. I close my eyes and tilt back my head in melodious elation, allowing the thought to wash over me and cleanse me with thoughts of tomorrow. Oh sleep, I hear you beckon and I come immediately, obeying the summon with an exultant diligence. I come to you, open your arms wide and swallow me whole, for I am yours!

      AAAAHHHH! They killed blogger. They've made it all different and trendy and less-rough. Oh- I loved the old blogger so much. This is supposed to be better, I know; comments are now an option and everything else is improved, but that's not what I wanted from a blog. I never wanted to join a community, I just wanted to write. It all seemed so simple...  Not that I've been writing, though. This last week has been completely void of anything worth while. How sad. I have returned, however, and hopefully my nearly-daily writing habits return triumphantly with me. Maybe not. Meh.  Yesterday Carter and I went to prom. We're something of an "item" now, and I'm not sure how I feel about that. I adore Carter, and I love dating him, but do I want to be part of an item? Hmmm...I just don't know. But anyway: Prom.  Prom was interesting. I enjoyed myself, but I still retain the opinion that the ritual of prom is one without purpose or justification of any type, and that it's just plain stupid. It just is. For so many reasons:  1.	Though I believe in spending a night on the town in a nice restaurant, this isn’t the same thing. Take away the ribbons and the dresses and the colored fish-netting and see do you have: a stomp. Nothing more, nothing less. They play the same trendy, mindless music, people are just as dependent upon their social cliques and groups, the dancing is just as horrid. 2.	It’s so Freaking expensive! $40 a ticket? (not a couple, a ticket) For what? Terrible catering and careless service? One has to drop at least $100, at the VERY least. If you did anything that my group did last night (rent a stretch limo with a chauffeur [ $60 an hour + a $75 tip] and go to any activities at all, then the price bucks up easily. 3.	Girls bank so much on this one night. I’ve seen egos shattered because of one night they didn’t get to participate in. It supports and strengthens the social hierarchy that I find to be so damaging to those that look up to it. Why rest your esteem on whether or not you get asked to prom? The girls that don’t get asked are often the most deserving. Why desire something so stupid?  4.	It’s Stupid!!!!! Unless you’re dating the person taking you, it often ends up awkward anyway. Since Carter and I ARE dating, we didn’t have this problem, but saw it prevail in our group. 5.	It has no point.  There are 5 reasons why I think prom is stupid. I have to admit, though, I had fun last night. This is simply because I adore Carter and the time spent with him, however, had it been anyone else I’d come back with an even more drawn-out explanation as to why I hate prom. Stupid tradition…  I’ve converted to cellular, by the way. I have a cell phone. It’s cute and small and sexy and black. Hmmm….what shall I name it? Poor nameless cellular phone….

      Wow. I'm tired. And I suck at writing in my blog. Meh.  I've been really busy lately, keeping myself occupied with school, work, Carter. My last day is the 12th of June, the last year I’ll get out so freaking late (The U’s graduation was today.) I’m excited.   I can’t gather my thoughts right now. They float and dart about above my head; it wouldn’t be too terribly hard to catch one and analyze it. I’m tired, however, and plan to go to bed soon. Granted, I do intend to call Carter soon, which will probably throw my whole go-to-bed plan on the ground and beat in mercilessly. That’s okay. I don’t mind. He’s worth it.  I need a new job. Mine sucks. My manager got mad at me. Well, not really, but I was annoyed anyway. I was on at 5, I walked in at 5 and had to change. I clocked on 3 or 4 minutes late. After I had worked for about 2 hours, my manager came up to the front desk and asked snidely “So Rach, you were late?”.  I hesitated, smirked, and answered “One or two minutes, yes, I was.”   I don’t care. Honestly. I could find a better job so quickly. I’m not going to quit, I’m just planning to cease all attempts of outstanding effort. I just don’t care anymore. Ha- I lasted 5 months; I’m already spag-bitter. Yes- I’m not going to be crazy like some of the other girls at work and stay for years.   Elisse and I went shopping today. Lately I’ve been so very frustrated by her. I’m sick of only seeing her in mellow moods just because she thinks that we’re “drifting”. I’m so tired of contention. How ridiculous.  Basically, I’m sick and tired of, oh, just about everything in my life except for a couple of things. I think I need to move to Nepal and become a sheep herder. I’d be such a sexy sheep herder….

And it's draining. meh  I'll type just a little, though. Carter and a friend came over today, was interesting, mum kicked them out because it was a school afternoon, and so on and so forth.

      Why do I foolishly attempt to write as if I'm currently capable of summoning laudable thought from the purplish abyss that is my mind and correctly articulating it? Why must I pretend? I’m too tired to talk right now, why would I expect writing capacity or eloquence? Because I’m an impractical little fool who lives her life bobbing about in her delusions. I see nothing wrong with that…  I’m going to a BBQ Marliegh is throwing in about 15 minutes; I just thought I’d type out some rubbish before departing.  Where on earth did Natalia Vodianova go? Yes, she can still be seen in every fashion magazine, but no longer in ever fashion show. 2004 Fall RTW was almost completely deficient of the Russian beaut, and her face is becoming less and less common. Pity; I was just starting to warm up to the girl. Meh. Her time has come, I suppose, or is on its way. Funny, though, how she’s reached her peak and she’s barely 20. Ha. Talk about one big scandalous bang of a career.   I’m going to go get ready now. I’m as sexy as Mrs. Vodianova any day, I just have to spend 10 minutes to look it. So I’m afraid I must leave you now. Farewell.

      I've often wondered exactly what awaits those who have worked towards damnation. Purgatory, hell, whatever one wishes to call it, is an intriguing piece of work indeed. I believe, however, that I have discovered exactly what hell will be like:  An eternal cycle of, day after day of not going to bed, getting ripped from your slumber by your mother and forced to concentrate on abstract mathematics for an hour.  Honestly- I kid you not. Can you think of anything more disturbing? I can’t. How horrid.  Yesterday I went to bed late, insanely late. I got up early, insanely early. My bus leaves in a little more than 2 hours and I have to following tasks to accomplish:  •	Grade 10 of my mother’s math tests. I foolishly offered this service in exchange for a ride to work. NOT FREAKING WORTH IT. •	Shower. Definitely need a shower. •	Clean my closet. I’m not sure if it is humanly possible to do this in two hours, considering the state of my dumpste, um, closet.  •	Get as much sleep as possible. I got around 3 hours and 45 minutes of sleep. If I go to work like this I am going to be so incredibly dead.  •	Endeavor to transform myself into something slightly presentable. I currently resemble Jane of the jungle and smell something like her friends the apes. •	Call Maile, Elisse, Carter, and try and work out whatever I’m doing tonight, if I feel like doing anything at all. •	Torch my mother’s car for putting me through such angst. No man, woman, or mammal of any kind can consider my treatment earlier on today humane in any sense, way, shape or form.      I have so little time. I don’t know what to do; I want to sleep. So very badly, I want to sleep. Meh.  I guess I’ll just start from the top down, then.

      The soul of Achille-Claude Debussy bursts forth from the solarium, enveloping the walls and the floors of this home I’ve come to passionately love. The melodious sound ruptures, exploding into the casings so well, so completely, almost violently. The sweet notes dance as they quickly fill the living room, rocking back and forth in the torrent of harmony. How glorious the deluge! How frightening at first, how initially startling, this inundation of dark notes and switching volume. The sound drowns the house. The beautiful melody fills the room, reaching to the top, satiating all the inhabitants therein. Fluidly and gracefully does this liquid-like substance creep closer and closer, how loud the notes rumble now, roaring and bellowing madly like a quenchless beast, standing aggravated and ready to devour all. The sound beats upon me, until finally the overpowering cry dominates, and the house is submerged.    The room has changed. This composition has transformed the dwelling into something different, neither a slave nor a master, neither a father nor a son, but a beautiful plane built to hold such sound. The music, though still quite loud and pounding, is simply another fixture on the wall, another identifying characteristic of this house, as if the spirit of the home had materialized into this facet of the room. The sound gently washes over the wrought-iron and the oak flooring, brushing up against the Batchelder fireplace and dripping down the vaulted ceilings. The music encases the room and titles it.   How beautiful, if nothing more, it is to witness the sounds you love complete the places you adore. This is harmony, the one true definition.

      Alas! Why must irony dominate and reign over my life? Ever since I began to listen to my MP3 player, I’ve been on the prowl for AAA batteries. We hardly ever use AAAs, so there were none to be found. I had to go buy some, which was no fun, no fun at all. Well, yesterday after taking pictures of the new house, I come home to post them to see that the battery died just barely before I emptied the pictures onto the computer. One half-full AA would allow me to post them, so I’ve been searching madly since last night. And what have I found?  13 AAA batteries, I kid you not. Of all different colors, shapes and sizes (well, I suppose they’re all the same shape and size, considering they’re AAA batteries). 13!!! I couldn’t find one last week to save my life, and now 13 pop out of nowhere just to mock me! Just to taunt me and say “we can’t help you!! Haahhahahha!” Look! They’re pointing their non-existent fingers at me and laughing mercilessly. Why, oh why?  So I can’t show post pictures of the house like I promised Daddy and Jane that I would. I simply can’t. The world hates me and is conspiring against me, see.   So I suppose I’ll ramble about something else for the time being. Why don’t we chat about the argument mum and I had today, i.e. the reason I’m at home surfing as opposed to working on the house. She won’t let me sleep in past eight, which is ridiculous because it’s the summer and half my acquaintances are now technically viewed as nocturnal creatures. All I’m asking for is 9 o clock. That’s all I want, and she won’t give it to me. Apparently that’s a “wrong” lifestyle. Not different, not unhealthy, just wrong. I had to fight this sordid injustice somehow, so I turned the drum sander off, placed it on the floor, and came home. While eating a generic brand rip off of cocoa puffs that tasted remarkably like dog food, I decided I must battle this. I’m not sure how, but I have many options, which go as follows:  1.)	I could always just refuse to lift a finger until I achieve my goal and attain the 9 o’ clock right. I won’t sand, varnish, scrub, sweep, edge, sterilize, or speak audibly until those in the house I’m currently dwelling in respect my right to remain unconscious until 9 o’ clock    2.)	Hunger strike- I’d lose a couple pounds (the exact number depending on mum’s intractability, of course) and I’m bound to get publicity. “GIRL REFUSES TO EAT UNTIL ALLOWED TO SLEEP IN”. Would you look at that headline? Classic, I tell you. 	  3.)	There’s always the option of ignoring Gandhi’s way of doing things (nonviolent resistance my foot) and choose to follow Stalin or Hitler’s approach. “MILLIONS SLAUGHTERED DOWNTOWN WHILE MOTHER HOLDS STRONG”. Pretty intimidating, huh? A plethora of possible headlines face us, my friends, each more menacing than the next. “PARENTS OF MASSACRED CHILDREN BEG MOTHER TO CAVE” or better yet “TEENAGE GIRL RECRUITED BY ALCAIDA TO HEAD TORTURE DEPARTMENT AFTER FIGHT FOR SLEEP”. That’s bound to work.   4.)	I could somehow push her to sleep in, too. If I wake her up every 45 minutes by belting “Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen” into a megaphone that is situated approximately 3 ½ inches away from her left ear, she’ll have to sleep in, and therefore won’t be awake to rob me of my sleep. This wouldn’t get me any infamous publicity, but would be hilarious and I wouldn’t have to spend any money on WMDs.  5.)	I could gather up the other sleep-deprived children of Utah and we could picket, and maybe even march down Main Street. How would one go about rounding up the sleep-deprived children of Utah? After viewing my friend’s sleeping habits I feel like I’m the only one…     I don’t know- I’ll figure something out. But in the meantime- Narcoleptics UNITE!! FIGHT FOR THE RIGHT!!! ( The 9:00 Right!!!!)

      I’ve pretty much accepted the fact that the owner of this rental won’t sell to us. It was such a morbid dump before, but after 1 ½ days of us working in it it’s beginning to gleam with the charm that originally inhabited the house. The gorgeous hardwood has been exposed, the walls patched and painted, the disgusting carpet removed. He’s going to make a ton of money off of this house.   So we’re doing this work to:  1)	Make the house elegant and lovely so that the two months we’ll spend in it will be comfortable and exciting, not depressing. Plus, we’re paying $800 a month. After we exert ourselves for a week it will be worth $1400. We will be doing the labor, but we’ll be getting a great deal afterwards.    2)	Gain the experience. The landlord is paying for everything. EVERYTHING. We finally get to fiddle about with the expensive options of remodeling that simply weren’t practical before (i.e. crown molding, expensive tile, the nicest paints, new, modern lighting, the works) In the end he receives the monetary bonus, we get the knowledge and experience. Hard work is always good for a person’s mentality and their waist line. How exciting.   Today we finished removing all the carpeting, and it turns out that there is hardwood in two of the three bedrooms. We’ve ripped out the edging and the staples in the living room, its now ready to be sanded and finished. The rest of today’s work will be composed of de-stapling and de-edging the two bedrooms, and sanding and finishing the floors. We’re putting new carpet in the third bedroom, we’ll go pick that out today. Oh my.  It’s nice to be tired, though, to feel worn and stretched after a hard days work. And we still have to do the sanding! Aaaah! I’m going to die!  Anyway, this is what I want to experiment with, after letting the landlord's pocket foot the bill:

      I am so very tired. I went to work on the house at 11, went shopping for materials at 4, ate lunch, worked till 10. Needless to say we accomplished a phenomenal amount of work, and the shimmers of hope that once peeped through matted carpet and dirty walls are beginning to pour through the flawless hardwood flooring and fresh paint. I do hope we buy.   Today we: •	ripped up the gross, dirty, shag carpeting •	pulled out all the staples and sidebars and such •	swept, mopped, swept and then mopped the floors •	scrubbed the walls and the trim •	patched together the multitudinous holes with spackling (material of the GODS, how I love this stuff) •	painted two rooms, including detail work   Tomorrow we plan to: •	Sand and finish the floors (this will be the hardest part, even though we’re using a belt sander. I’m not sure how long this will take, but it will occupy most of the day) •	Apply the second coat of paint to the two rooms that we painted today. •	paint the trim. •	move on to the living room in which we will:        o	rip up the gross, dirty, shag carpeting        o	 sweep, mop, sweep and then mop the floors        o	 scrub the walls and the trim        o	 patch together the multitudinous holes with spackling (It’s so handy! So very    handy! Oh! Spackling, how I love thee!!!)        o	paint the room, including the detail work.   And then of course, we just have to clean up the mess that the previous tenants made in the other rooms. I was extremely reluctant to move in this house because it was previously inhabited by college students. A part of me hesitates to say “students”, however, because that would imply that they were human, which, after fixing all that they have done to this house, I doubt quite a bit. They’re not humans per say, but large, hairless apes. Apes who once had hair, but, due to grimy and positively filthy living conditions, developed a disease similar to leprosy that caused them to lose all their hair. These people couldn’t have been human, there is simply no way. There is no way someone could live like this: dirty clothes strewn everywhere (This is the condition we entered it in; they didn’t bother to take the clothes they didn’t feel like washing, so we have a huge bin of clothes that we plan to ritualistically burn under a full moon), old Chinese food stuck in random crevices of the house, an incalculable mound of empty diet coke boxes, and dirty dishes with food STILL IN THEM scattered about. This is how they left their rental house, and the landlord, though a pleasant enough man who’s willing to work with us, didn’t do anything about it. I had to scrub the hearty man dinners off of their cheap china so that we can donate it to DI and still have souls. I kid you not. I had to pick up their morbid jeans and throw them in a pile to be disposed of (I’m quite set on the moonlit ritualistic burning, but mum’s somewhat hesitant. I’ll have to talk her into it). These people were slobs, wasters, and downright disgusting people/apes. It’s terrible.  We’re hoping the incredibly low state of affairs will push down the price if the owner with give in and sell, so it does have its advantages.   I hope we buy, I really really do. Well, I’m dead tired from today and have an even more extensive day ahead of me. Farewell.

      My family has finally decided where to go. We’ve always had the motivation, now we have the direction. We’ve decided to rent for a couple of months, and we found this darling college-student dump with loads of potential. If we can get the owner to sell, we’ll completely renovate it and re-sell. Right now we’re just making it livable: tearing out carpeting and exposing the beautiful hard wood underneath, cleaning the walls and painting them, laying new tile, etc. We’d be able to make a pretty penny if only we can push the owner down and buy it. I’m so excited.  That’s what I’ve been doing all day, mainly ripping up carpet and plucking out the staples (I despise this job and yet I’m always stuck with it, regardless the house or the other people present) I’ve gotten quite proficient at it, however, so it’s easy and rewarding to see a handsome wood floor beam back at you from the blanket of loose staples that now litter the floor. I love doing this. I absolutely adore working on houses, and I’ve missed it quite a bit. It keeps me happy, it keeps me skinny.     We’re home for a power nap and we’re to leave shortly to go paint. We sand and finish the floors tomorrow, and then we’ll be done with the entrance, living and dining. Oh, how I hope we’ll be able to buy; the apartment downstairs is just as spacious and as promising as the one above, though currently occupied by a smoky and rambunctious family. If we buy we’ll be able to do anything with this property and I’m estimating a $35,000 profit, depending, of course, upon the price for which we buy it. We’d be able to pay cash, and it’s such a dump as of late that it’s not pooling in much money for the owner, so I’m pretty sure we’ll be able to buy. At least I hope!  It would be extremely unwise for me to skip my powernap, so I leave you all now. Farewell, my lovelies, wish me well on the painting and stripping and sanding that I have ahead of me. How positively exciting!

      The last entry I wrote told about some ideal person who bought tickets for Phantom months before the play came to town because they knew that some darling little girl named Rachael would absolutely love to go. Unrealistic, you say? Preposterous, you say? Why not at all, old chap, it just isn’t the person you think it would be. Upon vocalizing my dissatisfaction with the fact that Carter’s probably not going to take me to phantom, Elisse laughed at me and told me I was silly.  Me: “Why am I silly? I really want to go!”  Elisse: “Because I bought tickets for us a while ago, darling. I figured you would want to go…”   Kudos for Elisse! What a doll…

      I’ve been surfing a while, and I’d feel absolutely dreadful if I retired to bed without writing. So here I am, tired though not sleep deprived, semi-awake though in no state to write. I suppose I’ll just haphazardly stumble through my latest vexations until something half consequential springs to mind.  And lo and behold, something half consequential just sprang to mind. Alright: imagine you are in a certain situation. It this situation you are a male, and you have a girlfriend. You’re pretty happy with the situation, all content and besotted like. Is the picture in your mind? Have you become the male? Alrighty, we shall proceed.  This girlfriend of yours adores the theatre, and is quite the aficionado. She hasn’t quite reached the level of connoisseur, but she likes to attend whenever possible and has said once or twice that she would love to share the theatre experience with you.  The Phantom of the opera comes to town. Interesting; you have a girlfriend that loves the stage, has voiced her desire to go with you, and has said many times that Phantom of the Opera is her all-time favorite. Hmmmm….there seems to be some type of connection here. The crux of the situation is as thus: naturally, you spot the correlation and possibilities for this opera, but you don’t know quite what to do about it. What do you do when your girlfriend, who happens to love the theatre and Andrew Lloyd Webber and has said that she wants to go with you, presents a hint such as this? What can a guy do?  Obviously she’s trying to say something, although you’re not quite sure what. Being a male and completely oblivious to any type of hint, be it subtle or mind-bogglingly blatant, you say “huh” and proceed to forget about it. This girlfriend of yours, however, realizes that you are indeed a male and therefore are completely oblivious to any type of hint, be it subtle or mind-bogglingly blatant. She decides to dispense with the insinuations and bestows upon you a suggestion so open and directed that it borders on a command. One day, when frolicking about aimlessly and simply spending time together she looks at you dead in the eye and says:   “You should take me to The Phantom of the Opera.”  Once again, she’s trying to say something. What could it be? The conundrum bewilders you for a moment until you elect to simply say “huh”, and forget all about it.   A month later, you have two options. You can:   (1) Read her blog, and upon unearthing her discontent with her chances of going to phantom (which, considering the tickets are almost sold out, are getting slimmer by the moment) rush out, buy tickets, and pretend that you’ve had this planned since the first time she dropped the most subtle hint. Approach her 2 days later about her blog, accuse her of being insensitive just because you wanted to surprise her, and totally guilt her into sympathy and other fun things (which would be semi-tragic on her part, but not really, because she’s so utterly ecstatic about attending the play)  or you can:  (2) Continue to forget all about it, and fail to notice the problem until she starts foaming at the mouth and doing mean things, such as: writing cruel entries about you that portray you as a, um, less-than-brilliant character and intentionally stepping on your toes.    You have many options, my friend. Now you simply have to decide and execute the pre-determined decision. You could base your verdict on many factors, mainly two: your girlfriend’s happiness and the turkey sandwich that you’re really craving at the moment.  You simply don’t know what to do; you don’t know what to do at all.  Let’s see……Heads says you buy the tickets and tails says you go buy that sandwich….

      Fret not, darlings, I didn't turn in that wonder of a poem that I posted about To Kill a Mockingbird. I can't stoop that low. I did, however, write some interestin slam in 10 minutes before the project was due:  White, and exultantly clean, ready to fly.  So pure, so undeserving of this serving, not wanting to die.  The crime you didn’t commit, sublime, and ready to hit  It haunts because you are different  And lacking of adornment  Before they see the core, they abhor you for I adore you  And because you threaten them,  Your reverence condemns all them,  Your numbers then panic them,  And threatens to deprive all them  Of this unrighteous power in an hour  Too dark to truly see through,  This vagueness washes through you,  Hitting and beating, scathing your life and your soul  As the shadows drip and slide out of control.  And you don’t see why you are not allotted  The time and right and the claim to be plotted  On this land in which you were born and raised,  Beaten and hazed,  Driven to craze,  But never then phased.  How could they blindly, wildly, snidely engrave this anguish upon you just because you long to live and breathe and see, and perhaps ultimately take wing to the sky, and finally fly. Their unchecked power and force Will lead to an end of all they endorse. It is their ignorance, their pride, For that is the locking word Who could ever bear to survive, they who kill a mockingbird.

      It has finally come. The wretched heat of the desert has finally descended upon us and will soon swallow us whole! The blinding heat almost drains one automatically; the energy expels itself out of the being and surrenders to the intense warmth. AAaahh!!!! Run away!!  Yes. Summer in Utah is terrible. Truly it is a purgatory in every sense of the word and stereotypical belief. It is so incredibly hot and sticky and blazingly desolate outside that one barely dares to journey up to the upper level of the house, let alone outside in the middle of all the furiously hot commotion.   Why, Oh why? It came so quickly, yet it will last so long! AAaahah! How I long for a semi-moderate climate already!

      It’s amazing: the high school I attend is quite possibly one of the most under-funded in the country, yet I find myself again and again in awe of the extraordinary teachers that have tutelage over me. It would take too long, and no eloquence of mine would do the reason behind this justice, but let it suffice to say that hundreds upon hundreds of difficult students have weeded out the weak and the counterfeit, and have left nothing but the creative minds who think to survive. I have plenty of incredibly inept teachers, yes, but those who make an impression on me do so because of nothing other than the sheer genius and pureness with which they teach.    Mr. Christiansen, my physics teacher, is an awesome guy. Is he eccentric to the nth degree and completely insane? Maybe. But he’s effective and hilarious. Today he laid aside his normally jovial and comical behavior and assigned us our last assignment, which is due August 21, 2017.  On August 21, 2017, there will be a solar eclipse that will be able to be seen from the northern hemisphere. Two hours prior to the solar eclipse, each student in the class is to meet the rest of the class at Kemmerer, Wyoming. The saints will meet at McDonalds, and the sinners will meet at the soggy log bar (aren’t you glad that he’s NOT making fun of the LDS?) We will all gather for an eclipse party. We are to accomplish three things before this day:  1.	Find out who you are, don’t live someone else’s life/ serendipity 2.	Find a best friend to share your life with 3.	Discover what is real.   He is an exceptional man and an incomparable teacher, to say the very least.

      For history I’m writing 10 poems about To Kill a Mockingbird (yes, history. I’m writing poetry on a classic novel for a project in history. I must go to a public school in Utah, or something silly like that). The book’s lovely, I absolutely adored it. I didn’t like how scout’s faith in human kind was restored in the end, however; she lives in the south, where cynicism and a semi-fatalistic mentality conquer all, baby! What’s this horrid sanguinity I sense? I’ve decided that I’d focus on 3 of the poems and turn in 7 cliché, redundant pieces. I brainstormed with Amy Jo today in trig, and, with Jo’s brilliant assistance, I managed to summon up this:  Roses are red, Violets are blue, In this book whites hate blacks, And the blacks hate them too.   That's right, my dearest Miss Lee. Keep on rolling over in that grave of yours!

      We found the perfect house! Well, two perfect houses that are both so perfect for us that we can’t decide. We could make a huge profit off one after fixing it up, but the other has a huge, beautiful .3 acre lot in the middle of the city, which is very rare. The fixer-upper (we’ll call this little doll of a house Glenmare, affectionately titled after the street it lies on) is big and has so much potential- and we’d be able to get it for a great price, and still have money for a new car and enough side cash so that we could fix it up beautifully and pop a hot tub in the back yard. The other house (we’ll call this one Hollywood for the same reason as previously stated) has a cute house with not as much potential, and a gorgeous back yard with large fruit trees, resembling the south. I don’t know! Which one? Which one?  Meh. I’m not too worried about it. We’ll pray and go wherever we’re impressed to go.   The end of school is approaching. In 6 days I will be graduated from high school. 6 days! Creepy, huh? I’m so very excited, and in all actuality, I don’t have that much more work to do. I have a history project and need to study for a final in trig, English, and physics, but after that I am finished Whoopee!  Speaking of English, a somewhat funny occurrence happened today. I shamefully turned in a scarlet letter essay a while back that was dreadful. This paper was absolutely appalling! Very appalling, like almost-didn’t-turn-it-in-and-receive-credit-so-that-I-might-save-my-dignity appalling. I procrastinated, okay! Leave me alone. Yes, I’ve killed myself in that past before, getting up at 3 and writing fantastic analytical pieces, but they don’t fool her at all. Not that my writing is fake, mind you, it’s simply beautiful, beautiful description that attempts to hide somewhat shaky foundations. The bottom of every essay has read the same thing since the beginning of the year: “you have talent, now harness it”, “this thought is too promising to be incomplete”, “true writing has no room for sloppiness”, “You have a way with words but first need to develop your stance on this” and so on and so forth. I’ve gotten no help. My work is still novice and deficient in some key places. She hasn’t directed me otherwise (granted, I haven’t gone in to see her about it, but shut up). So, I…er…didn’t do that with this particular essay. I broke; I was sick of putting forth so much and getting nothing in return. I simply pushed the time limit to hard this time. I got up at 2:30 the morning it was due and passed out on my keyboard after copying a particularly repulsive essay off of 123helpme.com. The thought still makes my head turn away, and a shamed yet amused smile fall upon my lips. For the final I went through and rewrote the basic thesis before reluctantly turning it in. When it was returned to me, I was surprised to see the comments that now graced the familiar font and paper before me: “What a rudimentary thesis”, “Not up to your usual standards”, “No flow at all”, “???”, “SEE ME”. The break in monotony is somewhat releasing, but this is disheartening all the same. I feel terrible about this, that I allowed Nathaniel Hawthorne, of all people, to rob me of my pride! I know this is not the case, I took my pride by the shirt collar and hurled it at Mr. Hawthorne.   I think I’m going to go talk to her about it, and plead insane indecisiveness. I had no choice but to procrastinate!

      After such a seemingly long absence from the wide world of blogging, I'd figure I would wait until my return to salt lake to write.  But I have NOTHING TO DO.  NOTHING.  If I watch another movie I'll kill myself, I've finished the books I brought with me and bought over here, I've memorized the latest articles on vogue.com, and I've caught myself eating literal pounds and pounds of fatty, bachelor food out of sheer boredom. Hence the reason I've gained 5 FREAKING POUNDS over here. Oh my!  The problem is not that daddy doesn't entertain us. Today, after completing some school work, we treated ourselves to a rather lengthy but wonderful day back home. The museum was great, and the library was fun to walk through. I love this city, but it hasn't really spoken to me like I, for some un-explained reason, thought a city would. I don't know if I'd want to live here. Well, of course I would, I've fallen in love with the city, but more in the Carter sense, seeing as I'm absolutely swept away by the city within the first 18 minutes and love and adore it until I go to another city.  One day I'm bound to journey to such a spectacular city that my destiny to live within will hit me like a rather pleasant punch in the face (if there is such a thing, upon looking back I suppose there really isn't). But that's just the tiny bit of idealism in me talking, don't worry; I shall kill it momentarily.  Yes. I have fallen in love with the following music-producing people:        zero 7 - oh my. oh my. Where have you been, my sweet? Zero 7 strikes me as I imagine the depressed love child of LTJ Bukem and a more mellow Nikka Costa would. Kind of.      Sia Furler - another musician I stumbled upon while obsessing over zero 7.   Distractions  is a wonderful song that makes me happy (although it's definitely not a happy song). I love her voice! Absolutely Fetching.      The Smiths - awww.         The Cult - at least one of their songs (see  Painted on my heart )    I have developed an intense hatred for the following:        English . Oh language, my diety, my beauty! Why did you go off and screw me when I decided to graduate early, eh? Was that completely necessary? This online english crap is no fun.         This whole eat-too-much-and-you-get-fat concept . I'm not liking this either.      Cable TV  is corrupting the nation. The only redeeming characteristic of this putrid filth was The Real World. For some reason it went away, and left me with days upon days of Road Rules. I hate it so much...

         There I was, happily watching Sex and the City until I  accidentally  sat on the fated remote and stumbled upon an  Alanis  Morissette concert that daddy absolutely had to watch. Curses upon that woman and her homeland! Dirty Canadians...      Oh well, such is life. I can't get too attached to that show anyway, cable TV has never flowed through the house of my mother and I doubt it ever will.   You know, I've never understood the appeal many find in a concert. Yes, there is a certain degree of excitement that can't be achieved at home like it can in a noisy, dirty stadium where you sit 2 and a half miles away from the performance, but watching one on the TV makes no sense whatsoever. What  deranged  individual chooses to watch an angry Canadian hop around on a small stage belting song after song after song? What pointless charade has invaded my evening and prevented my entertainment? What poppycock!  We went to the Kenton County fair today and I'm afraid that I'm still a wee bit nauseous. The rides were fun, but the whole up-and-down and side-to-side feeling was only fun at the fare, and any  enjoyment  of the motion fled after I realized it wouldn't go away when I was standing or driving in the car back home. Not too much fun, to be sure. And then, of course, I come home to realize that Dixie the Jack Russell has consumed half of my Jamba Juice chapstic and completely shredded the cap.  I'm mad at Dixie and I'm mad at stupid Alanis Morissette. I'm also mad at the stupid petting zoo employee who wouldn't let me hold a duck. What kind of petting zoo doesn't let you touch the freaking animals? How exasperating!

      Charles Henri sat on the bench and lightly slid his tongue across the black raspberry ice cream. Black raspberry ice cream in an original cone with two extra napkins: the order he had placed at Schneider's Sweet Shoppe since it opened in 39', a little bit after he had turned 8. The old bench had been repainted since then, of course, but always the same glossy white, and Charles Henri had always remembered it chipped and peeling, as if the bench attempted to welcome and entice potential customers with its imperfections. He had sat on this bench with his father and mother until mother died in 1943, at which time he continue to sit on the bench with his father until he met Isabella. He sat with Isabella and father until pappy passed away in 1952, then it was just Isabella and his three children. Those golden days flickered in the old man's eyes; he remembered the evenings spent by the street, slurping up the home made delight of Schneider's.   His weekly ritual was different now, although he bought the same flavor and sat in the same spot. The smell of the road and the city no longer rose up gently to his nostrils, the atmosphere seemed hostile and foreign although the benches and the street that encompassed Schneider's had been altered so little. The sun shone differently now, and the heat it radiated was harsh and dangerous and refused to twinkle like it used to. His visit to Schneider's was more painful that enjoyable, yet he returned dutifully, week after week, never disappointing his old spot on the left of the second bench by the window. He knew exactly why he did it. Isabella's death wasn't going to shatter his life, though he loved her and loved her dearly. The kid's move away from the town and their distance that was unabridged by phone calls or letters wasn't going to morph him into a dysfunctional human being, unable to enjoy a nice cone of black raspberry ice cream from the best sweet shoppe in the state. He would mourn what is meant to be mourned, but he wasn't going to stop the custom he once held so close to his heart. He wouldn't stop just because it was empty and hollow and simply echoed the sweet voice of the sparkling sands of time.  So here he sat, licking his black raspberry ice cream in an original cone with two extra napkins flexed smoothly around the treat like rumpled wrapping paper. He had done this for many years, he was very good at it. It shouldn't have been hard to sit and to eat the dripping, sticky mess of a dairy product that had once brightened up his whole week. Heavens, he didn't even like this black raspberry flavor; it had gone sour after Olivia finally took that editing job in Chicago and crossed the bridge and soured over the river.  But he would sit, and he would eat, because that's what he enjoyed and that's who he was: he was a man who like ice cream and a man who supported Schneider's Sweet Shoppe.  The appeal of the visit to Schneider's had dwindled and reformed. It was interesting to watch the people who came to the shoppe and the different flavors that different people got. Today two teenage girls sat on his bench, a blonde who was eating the peach and a redhead who was biting into the moose tracks. They wore jeans that they slung low on their hips, and colored, sleeveless summer blouses. They chatted about different friends and boys, but Charles Henri focused on staring at the asphalt the blurred in front of him with trucks and vans and sedans.   He had made it down to the cone and had just taken his first bite of it when the blonde girl next to him asked: 	 “What's your name?” 	 Charles Henri looked at his cone and took a second bite, wondering who the youth was talking to. 	 “ Hey. What's your name?” She repeated, looking straight at the old man. 	 “Charles Henri.” He replied. 	 “Cooooool. Sounds French or somethin'.” 	 “Yes, it is French.” He said, somewhat bashfully. 	 “Why are you eating ice cream all by yourself.” 	 He looked down at the dirty sidewalk in front of him. Why not welcome sincerity into his life? He sighed. 	 “Because I have no one to eat ice cream with.” 	 “Here,” she cheerfully said, completely unafraid. “I'll sit with you.” 	 She scooted up next to him and peered at the remnants of his ice cream.  	 “What flavor did you get?” She asked, squinting at his cone. 	 “ Black raspberry. I always get black raspberry.” 	 “You must really dig that ice cream then, huh?” 	 He rotated the cone in his hand and licked a small drop of deep purple liquid that had fallen onto his wrinkled hand. 	 “No, not really, not anymore.” The girl looked at him inquisitively, inquiring with her eyes as to why on earth did he buy the stupid ice cream if he didn't like it and there were 13 other flavors. 	 “ But I always get Black Raspberry.” Charles Henri looked at his cone once more and allowed his eyes to wander about the street. He noticed a young woman sitting on the bench on the other side of the door whose presence had slipped by the observant man because of the conversation he had fallen into with the peach-consuming girl. She wore black high heels with rolled up jeans and a purple shirt, and she had long brown hair that flowed down her shoulders. She didn't take her gaze off of Charles Henri; she had been observing the interaction between the girl and the old man. Her eyes held the look of stone, with just the tiniest crack in the steel facade. She was curious. This brief conversation struck her, she did not scoff at it or roll her eyes as she so often did upon examining her fellow citizens. She did originally, as was her wont, but then she peered a bit harder at the two. A faint and muted smile flashed upon her lips occasionally, as if she were trying to be rid of it. Something about the colloquy warmed her immensely and lifted her. Finally her teeth burst through the pursed lips and fell naturally into a beautiful grin. She stood up and threw her napkin away but paused before disposing of the ice cream. Another faint smile came to her face, it was the first to truly reach her eyes. She walked down the sidewalk to the bench that housed the old man and the two girls. 	 “If you don't like Black Raspberry it's awfully rediculous to buy it. Here, try the cookies and cream,” she muttered, handing her cone over to the old man. “I get a new flavor every time I come and this one's absolutely delicious. I might just be sticking to it for a while.” She smiled  breezily and turned to go. 	 “ What's your name?” Asked the blonde. 	 The young woman opened her mouth to answer, but closed it immediately . A delicate frigidity washed over her and left her once again intensely arctic in her stare. She smugly tilted her head up and glanced at the girl. The smile didn't succeed this time, that odd moment of disorder had passed. She smirked and turned around briskly, clapping down the sidewalk in her black heels.  	 Charles Henri stared after the strange woman for an instant, laughed with the girl next to him and took a bite out of the cookies and cream. 	 “Pretty darn good.” 	 A red car rolled past, in the passenger's seat was the young woman. Charles Henri tipped his hat in thanks for the ice cream. The woman became still as another smile rose to her face. It failed, however, leaving the plane of her features as nippy as ever. She sighed, and turned her head, focusing her dark eyes on the mail box across the street.

       I went shopping today with Cindy and inadvertently stumbled upon the perfect pair of classic pumps for which I have been searching a good solid 3 months. I asked Cindy to inform Daddy about this, so that he doesn’t miss out on the perfect birthday present opportunity (which will be needed in about 3 weeks or so), for him to miss out would be ever so sad. Cindy’s a wonderful gal, very level-headed, open minded, and just an incredibly nice person with the ability to make even the most demure feel welcome and loved. I had a great shopping trip with Cindy.   Good news: Mum thinks that Doug, our landlord, will sell to us. I am ever so happy about this; we would get it for 220 so we would have 40 or so to fix it up and make it look perfect, and then we would have a little money left over for a new car for mum (do I hear the word "Jag" caressing the breeze about me?). I am very happy about the situation, and I’m exciting by the fact that I might have that home in my mother’s name to come home to. How fetching.   We’re due at a picnic at 6 PM at the Swainheart’s, absolute dears that we’ve known forever. I think I’m going to go take a nap, it’s a shame I didn’t bring my book!

       I sit before you, with Dixie the Jack Russell swirling around my feet and&nbsp;incredibly little to say. So far my stay here in Cincinnati has been utter bliss, yet almost completely uneventful. One must wonder why an interesting sequence of events is necessary for happiness and a sense of excitement in one's life when staying at home, yet not while traveling abroad. The change of scenery is inflammation enough; stimuli dwells within the foreign environment. Therefore I have yet to feel bored or disenchanted with my stay, but rather I am still in a frenzy about my being here. It will be very hard indeed for me to return to the drudgery of Salt Lake, and to the monotony that has buzzed inside me for the past four years. I understand that this will prevail anywhere if I let it, that Cincinnati would soon fatigue and irritate me if I stayed long enough while harboring such a mentality, but I don't think I like the idea of expending effort toward not letting myself get bored in Salt Lake. I'd rather move here and labor not to let myself get bored. All and all I think the latter idea would prove much more rewarding.    Today we lounged about until 11:00, at which time we took it upon ourselves to journey down to Covington for a nice lunch at the cock and bull pub, which was very excellent indeed. I had the chicken penne, which was delicious, but to be quite frank, not as ambrosial as one would expect from a dish with as many fat grams as I'm sure was in that one. Not only did I face this calorie-breathing beast bravely, but I solicited it by asking for a side of melted butter and garlic so that I might further adorn the platter and double the fat content. This was probably a bad move on my part, but penne must be served in a sauce creamier than olive oil and chardonnay, what can I say? Surely any level-headed pasta connoisseur would agree with me and would take a similar course of action, regardless of the heart attack that's sure to follow after about three of these meals. Usually I'm able to shrug this off and not think about it, but this inordinately fattening meal left me with an immense feeling of guilt that has yet to leave me. Today we made a recording for Rob to send to him in Switzerland, and upon viewing this I have come to the paranoid conclusion that I am the most corpulent female ever to pound about the city on the thunder thighs that are hers. Some who know me might take it upon themselves to scoff at me, but I assure you that this observation is neither stupid nor fallacious, because I simply feel obese. Too much rich food can do this to you, I truly blame European cooking for my lack of contact with reality, I do. It's absolutely laughable to think that the Italians and the French were the ones who invented Creme Brulée and Tiramisu Cheesecake and yet America is the fattest nation in the world. Just because we can't restrain ourselves and resort to stuffing ourselves to bursting in face of all the emotional retardedness that we as Americans are exposed to day by day isn't reason enough to turn us into the upholstered buffoons of the modern day world. Is mother nature completely merciless or does she merely have a painfully fiendish sense of humor?    I think I should move to Calcutta and dwell in a severe state of destitution until my unfortunate financial condition forces me into a semi-emaciated physique. I then can work to kindle all the rest of my dear little complexes into raging bon fires that ravage my life and leave me another servant of the deleterious wreck of a system that is North American society. Is one not disconsolate to realize that I am not alone in this skewed worldview? But alas! Do not fear! For my arrogance and dominating pomposity restrain me from acting on my dislike of my healthy body, or even from allowing my mind to dwell on the issue for a moment too long. And yet my dislike of my relatively healthy body restrains me from letting my conceit overpower me and destroy my life. It is a beautiful cycle of flaws that gyrates and spins closer and closer to overall balance than many other seemingly "healthy" aspects of life.    I believe therein that cycle lies the key to the success of the American nation. We, the people of the babbling, conceited, completely oblivious and biased, are a major power in the world not because we're healthy and level-headed. Good heavens no! It's because we have so many complexes, phobias, obsessions, fixations, and neuroses that they all each individually make the others less daunting and therefore less threatening. This balance of infirmities leads to an arrogance that doesn't cripple because it doesn't exist to hide or cover the infirmities, but simply exists to coincide with the infirmities in a beautifully askant symbiotic relationship. This beautifully askant symbiotic relationship exists because it, in and of itself, makes no sense whatsoever, and therefore holds a secure place in the American psyche. We are a powerful people because we are completely and utterly insane. Absurdity is a necessary attribute of the well rounded individual; it builds character.&nbsp;&nbsp;    Tomorrow I have to wake up at 7:45 for church, and right now it is 12:09. I have no idea why I'm wasting my time stating that Americans are insane, it's much like writing a dissertation about grass being green or mosquitoes being repulsive; it is a common fact that is well known and widely accepted. I leave you all on that note and beg that this has changed your view of us Americans. We're really not that bad, we're just unhinged, and quite content about the unhingement, if that is indeed a word. Farewell.&nbsp;

      You open the front door to see a charming wrought-iron fence sitting beside a cobblestone street. Grass pokes up between the brick sidewalk which groans beneath the thousands walking upon it. The bricks actually dip in the center of the walkway, curving down the well-trodden path. I find it interesting that the relatively busy street neither threatens or intimidates me, but charms me with the roar of the varied cars as they rush on by. Grass that is long but just barely short enough to please the eyes nestles around the trees that relax complacently by the streets and the houses. This, the town of&nbsp; stamped bricks and exquisite Queen Anns that sweep up to the sky, their widow walks and turrets grasping gracefully the blue above them. This, the town of the 32-room Book Loft, covered wall to wall and floor to ceiling with a voluminous assortment of every type of book, with hundreds of small, worn arrows stuck to the thread-bare carpet, directing the attentive shopper to the nooks and quoins holding the sought-after treasure of the shop. This, the town of the prince in his 150-year-old mansion and the pauper in his small yet charming loft in the back alleys. This, the town of the old. This, the town of the new. This, the town of German Village in Columbus, Ohio.&nbsp;   How I adore this place. How happily the houses wink back at me and how gentle the sun falls upon me. The climate here is moderate. Oh blessed moderation!   I'm enjoying myself thoroughly. Yesterday we drove to Columbus and stayed the night at Cindy's house, my dad's lady friend. She forgot the bag that she needed for work in the morning at my dad's house, so we drove to German Village for a bite at the local starbucks and a nap in her cute apartment. Basically, it's Seattle, but you don't have to pay to breathe.   A couple times I've encountered a few things here and there that have reminded me of Carter, but on the whole I don't think I get attached like mum does. She keeps telling me: “Give yourself 3 weeks, it always takes a while for the change to settle in. Of course you're not crying now, but you just broke up with him. It'll come soon enough.” Well, I'm still waiting for the water works, just for the record. I always knew mum and I had our differences emotionally, but I really don't think I get attached. Or I don't let myself. Or I do and am pretending so well that I've actually convinced myself otherwise. Either way I'm not crying. There will be first loves, second loves, third loves, and fourth loves. My love life has just begun, I'm not going to mourn it for what it is: a compilation of many acquaintances (not necessarily many, but more than one for that matter.)   Elisse and I switched phones so that I don't have to writhe under the burden of evil, evil roaming rates. You know that commercial where the man drops his phone in the bear pit at the zoo ( I think it's a bear) and he jumps in because he's afraid the bear will make a roaming phone call? Yeah. They're not over exaggerating. Anything smaller than a great white is going to have to fight me to make a roaming call on my celly, it's like 70 freaking cents a minute. I'm not down with that. Not down with that at all.   I also did end up going to that cocktail party on Wednesday, and I had an absolute ball. Fish (or phish, however the obscure nickname is spelled) throws delightful parties. Everyone was dressed up, or at least you would know they tried if you knew the person. Glen Miller strummed gently in the background (at least for the last part of the party; earlier on they were playing some dreadful violation against good taste that I have completely blocked out of remembrance) and we sat on a pleasant evening, talking about everything from Ella to dyeing underage girls green in, what appeared to me to be an insensitive one, myself being underage and all, an attempt to avoid the whole statutory rape issue (All in all I was against the idea, for obvious reasons). I've decided I approve of Fish on some levels, which is crucial, because he wants to date Elisse. I haven't given her final approval yet, though, something of this nature must be thought out.   I believe it is 12:26 Cinci time, so I must leave you now and slumber in my daddy's semi-musty basement. Adieu!&nbsp; &nbsp;

      I am no longer held captive by the snarling beast that is the Old Spaghetti Factory. Tomorrow is, indeed, my last day and I’m getting it picked up. Yay! I have escaped with both my sanity and all four limbs. I have managed the impossible.  Right now it’s too dreadfully hot to do anything that requires thought process or excessive movement of the body, unless it is between 10 am to 6pm, during which it is too hot to do anything at all. I’m going to go run errands with Elisse, which is okay because her air conditioning works (I hope).   She invited me to an old-fashioned cocktail party tonight, and my attendance is still uncertain. I don’t know if I want to go. Dressing up would be fun, but these things tend to be boring. I’m going rock climbing at 7 with the ward, though, and that I am excited about. Jon might be there, I really hope he comes. I’m still head-over-heels in love with that boy, he is ever so adorable.   I am single again. Oh, the sweet, sweet ring of words symbolizing freedom. How fabulous!

      Mystique of Sunlight By  R.S. Ivory          I remember, rather fervently, lying awake in bed one morning when all of a sudden I was seized by the deepest, darkest despair ever to touch my soul. The snow fell lightly outside my window, lazily drifting down to join the sea of white that had covered our city the previous night. Upon the wings of coldest purity had Change soared into view, the bitter wind and the blade-sharp cold trumpeting its grandiose arrival. The sky above remained blank, as if not wishing to detract from the glory of the first snow of the season. All around me it fell, not stopping, not pausing; just diving towards the ground. It seemed strange to me that change would be so monotonous, but it was, at least for that day. 	         I didn’t want to leave my bed that morning. The stark opposite of anything pleasant smirked at me through my window, encouraging me to stay in my warm, friendly bed. My bed was a miracle to me; wherever I dared to move or stretch or extend within its confinement I was greeted with the gentlest caress of the sheets on my bare legs. Outside you may be as free as a bird, but you’ll rarely find the comfort or the love that can be found in one’s bed. 	         Once again I turned my gaze to the window. Two single-hung casements, positioned side by side, with charming oak trim painted an ancient white stared back at me. I adored my window. There was something about the compilation of glass panes and wood that meant an incredible amount to me. I found this strange, my inability to identify exactly what it was troubled me. What was so endearing about this thing, this aspect of my somewhat featureless room, what characteristic bound this white-encased portal to me?   	It was early, and the darkness of the morn continued to envelop me. I continued to ponder about the conundrum the stood before me. My eyes trailed along the wood, searching for the component that engendered the veneration that billowed and swelled inside me. This was a puzzle, and the answer was next to me, silently waiting to be discovered, breathing slowly and evenly like a child lost deep in a reverie. Could it be the morphed reflections of my face in the hand-blown glass, or the image of the fresh greenery that danced through the window?   	It was at this moment that the sun rose. The rise of the sun is steady; evenly the star creeps up the sky till it blazingly reaches the climax of its cycle. The sunlight burst through my window. It poured into the room, filling every portion, every crevasse, every inch of the room.  It was complete, yet gentle. The change the room experienced was phenomenal, yet not startling or disturbing. I remained in my bed, curiously observing the light as it rapidly climbed up the walls and crept farther along the floors. It reached my bed, and swathed my body in brilliant light. The sunlight dripped onto my bodice, warming me and filling me. The room was transformed.  	It was such a simple metamorphosis. The transmutation of the appearance of my room immediately spurred a change in my mentality. The unexplained gloom that had dwelt within me earlier that morning had melted at the sight of such luminous radiance, and yet the transformation was so simple and uncomplicated. The addition of natural light to my room had robbed the area of all seemingly infinite doubt. The landscape that dwelt on the other side of my window no longer smirked at me, but beckoned me.   	I stood up and stretched. Fumbling around my closet, the ancient plaid scarf that I had acquired years ago was found and wrapped several times around my neck. I opened the door and exited the room.

      Carter just texted me:  “Hi….”  He said he didn’t want to be friends. This is going to be difficult for me. If we’re to break this off, then I really don’t think any type of contact will be conducive to an effective break up.   I don’t know what to do…

      Wow. I have seen so many bad movies in the past week and I’m still craving a semi-decent one. After seeing  •	Le Divorce •	Something’s got to give •	Along came Polly  I’ve decided that this “movie industry” thingie has had a good run, but it’s time to put ‘er down. Really, the gal has her good days but really she’s going through so much pain. We need to put the poor thing out of her misery and move on. Really.  Speaking of moving on, I broke up with Carter. It’s sad, but necessary. It was just getting too serious, we were getting too close. He’s a sweet guy, he’s just not what I want right now. I don’t want attachment, I don’t want a serious relationship. And the whole commitment part just scared me stiff like a Frenchie swimming in the strait of Dover, what can I say?  It’s not that easy, though. I realize that I am in a jovial mood after watching the nonsensical poppycock that was “Along came Polly”, but I am sad about this. The fact remains that Carter made me happy. Being around him was the funniest, happiest thing I’ve experienced in a long time. I don’t want commitment and I don’t want the emotion of a relationship like the one him and I shared, however fun it was at times. I’m going to Cincinnati and then I’m starting college, and I would truly like to start completely over, with a clean slate. I think this break up was better sooner than later; what must be done must be done.   Tomorrow I pack for Cincinnati; I depart on Thursday at 10:00 in the morning. I am so excited to see Daddy and Cindy.   This writing is just terrible. Wretched stuff, it is, one can tell that I haven’t been writing as often as I should as of late. Oh well. At least I’m posting rubbish, as opposed to posting nothing at all.

      Sylvia Plath - Mirror    I am silver and exact. I have no preconceptions. Whatever I see I swallow immediately Just as it is, unmisted by love or dislike. I am not cruel, only truthful -- The eye of a little god, four-cornered. Most of the time I meditate on the opposite wall. It is pink, with speckles. I have looked at it so long I think it is part of my heart. But it flickers. Faces and darkness separate us over and over.  Now I am a lake. A woman bends over me, Searching my reaches for what she really is. Then she turns to those liars, the candles or the moon. I see her back, and reflect it faithfully. She rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands. I am important to her. She comes and goes. Each morning it is her face that replaces the darkness. In me she has drowned a young girl, and in me an old woman Rises toward her day after day, like a terrible fish.

      I am such a fool. My beliefs are not meant to be molded and expressed by the frail, flawed language of mortals. True expression is not to be released, nor to be published, nor to be formed in any place other than in one’s own mind. Definition cannot be found in any place other than the hallowed depths of my being; purpose can only be discovered when a thorough search is conducted away from this world, and away from our silly, petty fears that are so important to us and can dominate so much of our lives. I hate being sincere. It is so futile while upon this world. To truly be frank with myself out loud is ridiculous.   I’ve decided I don’t ever want to publish. I’ve questioned the motives behind my doing so and I’ve discovered that they are completely aesthetic. Not for the fame or money or anything silly like that; I’m too lazy and worried to care about anything as completely stupid as that. I would publish to finally be able to hold, in my physical hand, the security of knowing and being able to articulate my beliefs. I have realized, however, that my beliefs should not be articulated. What folly that would be! Upon that day I would hold in my hand not what I believe, but the theory held by mankind for centuries that would bear strongest resemblance to my beliefs. This theory, or belief, or manmade conclusion, whatever it may be, is so dissimilar to what I truly live for. Why would I discuss this? What does this have to do with anyone but myself?  I will not find happiness in an audacious parade of events and details that have been circumspectly arranged by an ignorant hand that demands to know the things that are not meant to be known. It’s quite simple: all I have to do is live what I know. I have nothing else to do, so why would I do anything else? I need to stop dancing around this and attempting to find a middle ground in which I can have pleasure and serenity. One could say that these two things are synonyms, but no, my dearest, they are opposites indeed.

      Argh. I leave for Cinci in 5 days. Oh blessed release!  Today I took mum out for an absolutely lovely dinner at L’Avenue. I had a splendid time, savoring the red snapper and Crème Brulée. The service was wretched, but the atmosphere was charming and the food was positively succulent. I then watched “Somethings got to give”, and have landed at the intelligent conclusion that Jack Nicholson is the perfect dirty old letch, while Diane Keaten is an idiot who, for some bizarre, unknown reason, comes off as witty to most.

      “In the gospel of Jesus Christ you have help from both sides of the veil and you must never forget that. When disappointment and discouragement strike- and the will—you remember and never forget that if our eyes could be opened we would see horses and chariots of fire as far as the eye can see riding at reckless speed to come to our protection. (see 2 Kgs. 6:16-17) They will always be there, these armies of heaven, in defense of Abraham’s seed”  							-Jeffrey R. Holland,                                             “For Times of Trouble,” New Era, Oct.1980, 15

       Conversation around the breakfast table, Part II         Today mum, Ricky and I were talking in the dining room. We discussed new cars and my newly painted room, which, by the way, looks perfectly fetching. As we lounged, the bat walked past and opened the front door. 	       “I’m going outside with my orange to meditate about the eternal nature of the gospel. I’ll be back in 15 minutes”        She closes the door, leaving my mother and I quizzically looking at each other just to confirm what had been said. Mum’s lips break into a smile, as do I. 20 seconds later the front door opens to return the bat.        “I forgot my J. Crew catalog.”        Is there any hope for me? Is it physically possible that I will lead a relatively sane adult life or are the genetics too strong to allow this? I’m amazed I’m capable of coherent thought at the present…

       Conversation around the breakfast table, Part I    Mom:  “Mom, why do you have Rachael’s purse?”  Bat:  “She let me borrow it because I’ve lost all my purses”. (They’re definitely NOT in my closet, believe you me…)  Mom:  “Well, that explains a lot. I saw the purse in your room so I peaked inside and was confused when I saw all of your stuff inside. Where did you get that mascara? It works like a dream.”  Remind me as to why I ever felt privacy existed in this house….

      I’ve just returned from an absolutely splendid night with Carter. Our evening commenced with a meal from Flemings, which was fabulous. I had the Australian Lamb and Carter had the rib eye, and the majority of the time we spent in the restaurant was spent in silence, Carter and I leaning back and gently salivating over the tasty meat. The atmosphere was exquisite, although the server was obsequious. I most definitely plan to return.  We then went to the mountainside to watch the fireworks. We dozed under the sky while lying under a blanket. He took me home, kissed me, told me I was beautiful, and invited me to a family party tomorrow. I like that boy.  Anyways- I received my ACT scores today. I scored a 28, which, though far from impressive, is good when remembering that I didn’t study a word and was running extremely low on sleep the day that I took it. I’m not excusing anything, though; I’m happy and proud of my 28.   I don’t think I’ll go to bed yet, but I’m certainly not going to write anymore. My keyboard is a piece of crap and keeps holding down the control key, which, as any semi-sane person can imagine, is annoying. Farewell.

      It has seemed like the longest time since I've sat in front of this enticingly black screen. How I've missed you, my dearest, and how I've mourned your absence! This, my method, my child, I adore you and I've missed you dearly. It turns out my echo means more to me than I though it did.  I just got back from Spiderman II with Carter. The movie was good, or at least it was produced in the comic-like form that becomes our crime-fighting arachnid ever so well. I despise the actor who plays Spiderman almost as much as I loathe Kirsten Dunst (shudder), but overall it was good. Carter enjoyed the film much more than I did, bouncing around in his seat with glee upon witnessing the fulfillment of the comic book narrative. I think I'm in love with the boy. I found dependability in a 18 yr. old construction worker/romantic/prep school graduate and my discovery scares me quite a bit. I enjoy being with him ever so much! He makes me happy!!!!  Elisse is in Washington D.C. at debate camp. Apparently she passed up Stanford to go to this allegedly prestigious camp and found out it was crap upon arrival. Every time she calls I pick up the phone to hear disappointed whimpers and homesick groans from the other end. Poor baby. She has 11 days left till she arrives back in S.L.C and she can’t stand it there. At the same time it’s funny; she’s lodging in one of the most fascinating cities in the world and she can’t explore it because she has to attend a lecture explaining what a counter plan is. Poor girl.   My nonattendance, by the way, is not the fault of my laziness or my inability, I just want you to know. I’ve been traveling; last week it was Seattle (BEST CITY EVER!) and this week it was girls camp (WORST SLEEPING ACCOMODATIONS EVER!). This upcoming week I’m a.) painting my room the most adorable pastel-mint color and b.) working on Driver’s ed and the rest of my course classes. The week following will mark the beginning of my beautiful respite in Cincinnati which will last throughout the rest of July and the beginning of August. Exciting.  I’m tired, and I have to go brush my teeth. Tomorrow Carter is taking me to  urlLink Flemings , and I pine with anticipation. Huzzah!!!

       The Book of the Anti-Lowi-Acedemia-ightes   Chapter 1 composing verses 1-15 exclusive  1.In the 16th year of the reign of the judges it came to pass that there dwelt a fair maiden beyond the hills in the land of Salty Mc Salt Salt. The maiden was exceedingly fair and bright, yea, a maiden of only 10 and 6 years, yea, a searcher and a doer of all things beautiful and right. 2.But she was one of eagerness, yea, filled with the desire to rush, and it came to pass that patience was not a virtue known unto her. 3.She dwelt in the land of Salty Mc Salt Salt, however, where public education was a thing of ugliness, and of sin, and of low budget. 4.She said unto her mother “Yea, I shall leave this perdition in which I must stay, and I will wander yon over the hills to the glowing white town of UniversityofUtah. But I must first complete my journey in the smelly black pit of high school first, and labor towards a diploma of light and truth.” 5.And it came to pass that the fair maiden labored all of her days to achieve that which was desired by her and trialed and worked until sweat covered her brow, and her hands were black and scarred. 6.She journeyed to her school counselors, yea, even the evil, idolatrous Pharisees of Academics, and they said unto her: “You cannot leave this place, you must stay. 7.For behold, we find you to be lacking one half of a credit of the electives, and for this iniquitous technicality we shall bind you, and torture you in the smelly black pit until the moon has risen and fallen in all of it’s luminescent fullness 12 times. 8.And it came to pass that the fair maiden did rent her clothes. 9.But she did it in private, mind you, for she was modest and genteel. 10.And now, seeing the horror that laid before her, she did journey to the house of her mother after putting on modest, unrent clothing and did weep. 11.And she also knowing the wisdom of her gentle mother, she did ask for aid and did pray undo the mighty Lord. 12.And it came to pass that the Lord did open up the heavens, and did pour his love down upon the fair maiden in the form of a Clep test, which is native to the glowing white town of UniversityofUtah. 13.The fair maiden did take the test, and did pass with flowing colors of red and silver and a tad of pink, and she did obtain not one half of a credit of the electives, but one full credit of the electives. 14.And there was much rejoicing.  15.And the fair maiden did journey to the glowing white town of UniversityofUtah, and yea, did stay there for two years until the 19th year of the reign of the judges. And she dwelt in righteousness, and happiness for the remainder of her years.

      mtv p.o. box 2001 new york, ny 10108  Dear Sirs:  Upon turning on my television for the first time this summer I was shocked to see that your popular television program “The Real World” was not currently on the air. I have come here to spit in your face in defiance and lay my insulted body between this noble show and the figurative  bulldozer  that you and the rest of your  corporate  buffoons plan to launch upon it.   You say that there must be seasons in which certain shows do not run for the sake of production, but I find this reasoning to be skewed, unacceptable, and particularly ugly. How difficult can it honestly be to shove 7 strangers into a modern dwelling and press the “record” button on one of your video devices? How excruciatingly painful is it to take less than 6 months to do this? It is my firm belief that any quality soap dish of moderate size could perform the aforementioned task if presented with the appropriate materials, which I'm sure a rather large network such of yourself is capable of providing. If you honestly feel you cannot produce a season of “The Real World” in under half a year, then I would urge you to deliver the creative opportunity to the soap dish, which, I might add, can be found at any Bed Bath and Beyond or Linens N' Things in the bathroom accessories department.       Now that we have settled the issue of the producer, I might say something of the cast of this newly redesigned “The Real World”. I am disgusted by the young, corrupted offenses against good taste who attempt to act as civilized, refined human beings who have previously starred in your show. To see them squabbling over milk or sexual relations or whatever they choose to stupidly humor themselves with is not entertaining, nor is it conducive to a stable society. The general public, I can assure you, is in need of deep psychological discussion such as the dispute over dial-up i nternet  connection versus the pricey, petty opulence of cable connection. I demand persons capable of such  expostulation. I believe you can find such individuals in universities, in office max fan clubs, or in  employment  at any state DMV.     Now that I have outlined the expected results, I might indulge myself to add one more  comment  that is less  germane  to the issue at hand. I am nauseated by the fact that “The Real World” has  disappeared  from the channel and yet its ghastly mockery of a counterpart, Road Rules, plays on. The producers of this show should be thrashed and then impaled upon the cheap fountain pen they used to write such appalling feculence.         								Sincerely Yours, Ivory
