      Um okay can the time go by any slower!! I am so ready to get out of here (work that is)!!! I can't breath out of one of my nostrols......to much dust here!! Okay I have 30 more mintues I think I will survive! So Friday, Courtney and I are going to a Moroccan Restuarant in Pleasant Hill. First time and I am very excited. It's so cool, you sit on pillows on the ground and you eat with your hands (cleaned ofcourse), while women belly dance around!! I love trying out different place to eat. There is so much culture in food and variety in taste, it excites me so much! I guess that is why I am going to Culinary School. Then on Saturday we are going to my friend Kelly's house to kick back and chug a few brewskies!! Oh look, the time has passed and I only have 20 more mintues!! So I took this quiz on Courtney's site and it rated me as a "Liberal Democrat" I really don't know, I am not into politics and all that jive. Not that it's not interesting, I've just never followed up&nbsp;on it. I barely watch the news. My television is&nbsp;always on channel 35...cooking and maybe channel 50...TLC. I like stuff like that. Anyways, I think I&nbsp;should head on out now!!&nbsp;Got to go workout!! Peace out! &nbsp;

      Hello!! So Courtney's friend from high school is leaving back to Washington tomorrow (Tuesday). Her name is Jessica and I would have to say that she is one cool chick!! I really didn't know what to expect but it turned out that we had some things in common and I would now say that I could consider her a good friend. She is down to earth and very genuine.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am so full, I chowed down on ceasar salad for dinner and drank like a gallon of water, whew!!. Can't breath!! So I am getting pretty excited. I start Culinary school soon. I am a little nervous only because I have went to this school and dropped out and now I am going back 3 years later. I just feel a little stupid but I am not going to let that stop me. It's what I want to do and it's what makes me happy!! I love to cook and expirment with food!! So I guess I blog again when I have more to say!!

      Hey there!!!  We are getting ready to go see I,Robot!! I am pretty excited!! Courtney wanted to go see the Anchor Man but I really wanted to see I,Robot and I always get my way.......I am a brat, this I know!  So Courtney and I just got into a little argument about how we both deal with problems or issues differently. He deals with it head on and I usually do the opposite. I hold it in until I can't any longer and then all my agression bursts out. Not saying that his or my way is better, just different. But you see he is the older sibling so ofcourse he is never wrong. :0P&nbsp; I noticed that the older sibling tends to be more aggresive in arguments&nbsp;and the younger simply lets more things slid. So you see in a relationship that can tend to clash.&nbsp; But we are better now, some things are better left unsaid, we agree to disagree!  So I want to find a job being a waitress!! I know some might ask why? But I used to be a waitress and even though it is exhausting work, I really enjoyed it. It's hard for me to just sit in front of a computer all day, I am a mover and a shaker........I can't sit still for too long. So waitressing the ideal job for someone like me. But I want to work in a higher scale restaurant, like a steak house or a nice Itialian restaurant, ya know higher prices means bigger tips! Oh yeah, Courtney bought me a beautiful necklace (this is the first piece of jewelry he has gotten me in the whole two years) I love it so much!! It's silver with a heart locket. He scored some points there!! I don't think he really liked what I got him, I mean I know he likes it but I don't think he will use it much, o'well you win some and lose some. Okay we are leaving now!! PEACE!!!!

      Hello all So Courtney and I are at the airport waiting to get on our plane and of course low and behold the damn thing is DELAYED!!! This is the first time I have ever been on a plane that has been delayed……and hopefully the last. So I saw the Village……I thoroughly enjoyed it. I mean granted it wasn’t what you expected but I personally don’t always like to know what is going to happen next. You need a little switch up in life. If not, then you would basically be living everyday over and over….how boring!! The airport is a good place to people watch. I love to people watch!! It’s pretty fun stuff when you have nothing better to do. Like for instance the man sitting behind me is writing in his journal and little does he know that I can read what his thoughts are. Or the other man to the far right of me keeps itching his crotch……Oh hell no…..he just picked his nose. Damn the things people do when they think they aren’t being watched. Can I just say that there are way too many darn polluters in this world. I mean I am looking around here and no joke there is like trash underneath every seat. The sad thing is that there is a trash can in like every seating section…….people can be so smart but when it comes to common sense they totally fell off the wagon. On the lighter note we are here at Oakland airport because my family reunion is this weekend. San Diego here we come. I am pretty excited!! I want to go check out TJ this weekend but we’ll see if anyone wants to go with me. I have never been and I would really like to at least be able to say that I have been there. I haven’t been to too many places and I would like to start seeing more…more then Livermore California. Don’t get me wrong I love my town but sometimes I get restless and feel like I should be somewhere else… I don’t know maybe I am just weird or just inpatient. Maybe a little of both. Okay so I am going to sign out now!! Will blog soon again!!

      Hi there!! I am at work almost off and I have to pee, but my feet hurt too bad to get up and go. So I will wait till I actually have to get up or till I get off. Isn't that pretty pathetic. I am so lazy that I will risk hurting my blater inorder to not have to get up. Hey, it's been a long day here at Wamu. So I am not going to the gym tonight (taking a break). I want to go grab a bite to eat but I have no one to go with, so I think I am going to go solo. You know what I think? I like Diet Pepsi better than Diet Coke....anyone disagree? I can't really pinpoint why, I just do. My favorite new soda drink is Orange Fanta...YUM YUM!! Damn it's good. The comercial did it in for me. When I saw the comercial of all those beautiful exotic woman dancing around drinking FANTA, I actually thought "hhmmm....so if I drink Fanta then I'll look like those woman and have all the fun I want?"........ya right!! No but seriously it's actually a pretty tasty soda pop!! I like to use that word "POP" in place of "Soda". My high school friend Christine used to call it Pop instead of Soda (she was from Cleveland) and I always liked the way it sounded...it's makes it more exciting. Or maybe I am just weird...probably a little of both :0P     So I am finally going to go see "The Village", can't wait. I like scary movies. Courtney loves them. I think a little too much, it's kind of creepy but hey to each is own. I have been saying that phrase an awful lot.. I like it. I believe that it's true. Only 30 more minutes to go!!!!! Okay well I am going to go pee, can't hold it in anylonger.....might explode, too many diet pepsis!!
