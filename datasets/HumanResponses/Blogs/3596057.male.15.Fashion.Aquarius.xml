      Days by dayz, weeks by weeks, told myself to do hw on 2nd week kauz i was sick on the 1st..however, once again i'm so lazy..left Mother Tongue, Chemistry, Mathematics..so much!! Haiz..regretted not doing..  I definitely muz power full steam for studies when skool reopen le..argh..yesterday went out wif Wei Ting, Wei Shan, Cheryl n Cassandra..funny thing..2 names wif W, 2 names wif C..thinking tat i wud be late as usual, its was totally the opposite..hahax..  Went to Parco Bugis, Bugis Village, Tampines Mall, Century Square..had lunch wif Cheryl while Wei Shan accompanied us den later meet Wei Ting n Cassandra..  Hmm..haiz..they bought a couple of things..den later had lunch at Long John Silver..teased Wei Shan till she blush till her cheeks were pretty red..den later nvr disturb her le..  Went back to Tampines, on board the train saw Mr.Kelvin Lau, taught me in secondary 1 de..dunno he kan remember me mahz..he seem tanner n chubbier..hahax..tink he's getting married soon according to Cassandra..kauz her klass students were invited to his wedding i suppose..  Kontiuned touring Central den finally i went home bout 8pm while they were still window-shopping..had gastric attack..wah..so pain..medicine was at home..wah..at interchange the bus quee so long till the new-stand!! Goodness..den 1 double-decker kame n fetched us all..both decks were so full..reached home n mum nagged..say alwayz go out the whole holiday..but i tink only 2nd wk n today lehz..hmm, anyway i kind of oso wrong..lolz..  Went to tok on the phone wif Wei Shan, wah..i so sad sia toking about life..kan die..den until 5am plus..when mum caught me den hang up..haiz..die die de..report book when she sign on Sunday she will say n say de..how? Anyway, smsed Dou Hua later at 5am plus kauz i missed her voice, smilez, laughters, scent n her presence too badly le..she didn reply me at all..but even if u r busy, juz a minute for me means a lot to me..so sad..  When on the phone, talked bout life, family n definitely Dou Hua..haiz..still have feelings for her..like no longer love..but still quite strong though not as strong as before holidayz..told her on Valnetine's, wanted to buy her a watch i alwayz see when going out..on bout 2dayz before Valentine's, the watch was not there..asked the sales personal to check all branches for tat model, he said they had one n i asked them to bring to Tampines branch..yupx..den bought the watch lolz..it may cost a bomb ($138 shud be), but no matter how much it cost, she wud be alwayz priceless..  Told her the watch meant that during our teenage life, right from the start of secondary skool till poly..there wud definitely be lots of ups n downs..so the watch which has a background tat blinked wif a purple back followed by a mirror every 2sec, wud represent all her happy times she remembered wif this watch by her..cheering her up when she is down if no one is by her side..  Den on the start of March Holidayz, tat time went to Suntec City juz to buy her present..from Precious Thot..its was the figurine type of thingy tat i bought..had a boi n a gal..who were young..sitting on their chairs, putting the pieces of puzzle together..n the puzzle was a heart shape..hmm..den below it had the name which was "Put The Pieces Together"..  I den bought it costing bout $98..hmm..not juz bkauz i liked it.but oso bkauz she knew me since primary 2..she was my klassmate when i didn't know..now same skool, n oso having same ambitions n wan to study Hospitality in poly..so it symbolises tat we were frenz when we were young, but our frenzship develop into love..tats the meaning behind it..however, there is a 2nd meaning..the one juz mentioned was if i still liked her n if she still liked me..  But den, the 2nd reason was tat if i no longer liked her, it would meant tat it was a token of frenzship from me to her wishing her all the best in finding her Mr.Right..hmm..n oso tat she wud alwayz be someone special n have a special place in my heart even if i may no longer like her..lolz..  Den she smsed me yesterday when we were at Long John Silver..thanked me for the gift..den smsed a short while..den no more le..asked her things but she didnt asked me..haiz..so saddening..anyway, by skool reopen i wud den make a final choice of whether i wud love her or move on..it hurts so badly..  Haiz..silent tears..

      Sobz..tis month has been one of the most painful perhaps..besides January..dunno how to start of..yesterday things went wrong..terribly wrong n hurtful..hmm, guess i start an intro of my life first bahz..  :: Introduction ::  Born in a family which was financially stable n a disciplined environment..grew up into a playful n happy child during childhood..active n bubbly each n everyday..each time i fell down or spilled something, i wud get kaned by my dad..is there a need? Lead me to hate him since den..only in the recent years hatred has lighten..2nd brother alwayz so harsh on me..kud not felt the needed love from family..all my family could give was a place to stay n grow up..which i'm thankful for..i do not love or hate my family..a family should perhaps provide the essential qualites of a shelther, love, kare n koncern..but where is the love?  Years later, bkame an introvert..started suffering depression..broke down pretty often..all alone in skool throughout the day which turn years..got frustrated over why i should be treated so biased n turn into a xiao didi (Little Brother) to those Da Jie (Big Sis) in skools..turned violent n short tempered..got detention, in skool suspension n even got my name into the BETA system..leaving me without any edusave since then..had no frenz xcept 1 or 2..family knew wad type of student i were..but told me not to get into too much trouble..felt love for the 1st time in life..but it was 1-sided love..moved on a year later..Experienced problems like studies, frenz, love n family tat lead into long-term depression..  Had serious health problems..Arthritis disease (1999 till now), Syness (breathing difficulty) which was kommon, Ringworm skin infection (no longer having it), Baby Molars (over sharp teeth which needed to be rounded at the edges), Small lower jaw which needed me to have braces for 2-3 years (due btwn Sept-Dec 2004), Physiotherapy when aged 12-13, high-blood pressure (2002) n mirgraine..slant back bone of 1-2cm..sometimes ache so terribly..so much to bear for me..when my family members hardly have any..am i so ill-fated? Health den bkame any other factor tat caused a longer-term of depression..  Entered sekondary skool n turned into a normal student..nth from violence n bad influence..was obese..went on personal diet n TAF n ended losing 9.5kg in juz 11 months..felt love the 2nd time..gave up after 2 years..heart was terribly ripped apart..broke down sometimes..had plenty of frenz..studies were unstable though still met the criteria..family gave lots of pressure n high expectations..had to do well, pass n all..but i were born a retard or EM3, wun i be much hated n konsidered a waste? Managed to stablised studies well by sec2..used komputer n slack terribly in first half of year..family was outraged wif my results of SA2 last year..felt tat it was beyond acception..but at least still in Science stream..but does not mean have to be smart to have a great future..some kan bkoem media staff, models, fashion designers, councillors, reporter n more which dun even need much brains..juz the quality to be one is enuff..  Till now, the problems still remains..n its the 8th year of depression..usually frenz whose life are average breakdown kauz of relationship break-ups n after a few weeks felt like dying..den wad bout me..wun i wan to die much much more? Had the attitude towards life tat was "Perservere to The End"..only childhood was when i was truly happy..tats y i like Peter Pan movie so much..y grow up n feel pain? Rather be a child n play n have no worries..of kauz Peter Pan movie was touching n thrilling tats y like oso lahz..  Needed someone who kud love me as much as i could..since i kant feel love..but sometimes hurtz tat there isnt though i may look like got 2-3 exs..me so bhb..but tats not from my mouth..still like Dou Hua..miss her..skool reopen den see first lolz..  :: End Of Intro ::  Hmm, woke up late n slept late everyday during holidayz..useage on kom n phone higher den skool dayz..but its holiday n its lesser den kompared to last year..eldest brother tot i was chatting while doing work..say wan tok dun pretend see dictionary..so sarcastic..very frustrated..went to balcony washing machine to do hw..still on phone..asking Wei Shan to help mi think of words..hmm..after 40mins i guess, force me to hang up..got real mad n felt like slapping him initially..  Went to room..he smsed me to scold mi..told him off.conversation was not very bad..got better..told a lot of unsatisfied things..gave up..went to bed..with silent tears rolling down my cheeks..hardly able to breathe..already nosed blocked n crying..gasping for my every breath..so hard to breathe..felt so kold..hands n legs curled up..felt so lost..my heart was shattered n stabbed right through..aching n bleeding..kudn't stand..wud fall upon my knees if i were to..lips turned pale..hardly able to speak..one of my worst breakdowns ever..still alive by tis morning..things were back to normal..kud walk n all..  Missed Dou Hua..still have alittle feelings..hmm, let all be in the hands of fate..till den..

      Hmm, well i woke up pretty late once again..kant see why i've alwayz been feeling tired even during holidays..Cooked lunch today n noodles n veggie seems yummy..hahax..  Anyway, i've did my filling of my notes for almost all the subjects..hahax..one job lesser..yupx..oso i discovered there's 5weeks in June n 4weeks of holidayz!! Realised there were still 2 more weeks when i tot there was only 1 left..thanx gosh!! Or else it wud definitely be a hard to time to do my hw n as well as revision..  Talked on da phone wif Wei Shan, Shawn n Kok Kuang in a conference..Kok Kuang made a bet wif me after Chinese Orchestra (C.O)yesterday tat by 2weeks, his skin muz get better..n i promised if he did, he wud get a present!! Hahax..day dream bout his image ytr too..anyway, on the phone was fun..had Wei Shan komplaning n Shawn n Kok Kaung laughing throughout..Shawn left early as it was time due for tuition..  Later in the evening, had Black Pepper Beef Steak for dinner!! Yummies!! Anyway, parents went out n later 2nd brother kame back..Got alittle unsatisfied as i was being told a lie..Found out tat when i asked DH out juz for a second to pass her birthday present either on Tuesday 8th June or Wednesday 9th June..she klamied tat she wud be out wif her mum n wud not be able to meet..nvm..i understand..for a week ago, smsed mummy (Sharlene), n she asked where wud i bring DH out on her birthday if kan..n i said Sentosa or Zoo n stuff..mummy n Shahizwan n group who was together saw wad i smsed!!  Argh!! nvrm..they are my frenz n klassmatez..tat was like a week before her birthday..since den didn kontact much..breaking record of almost 1 to 2 sms those few dayz..smsed her asking bout things trying to start conversation n stuff..but all she replied was juz answers to my qns..sometimes nvr even reply my missed kalls n sms..where is yr koncern for me? Nvm den..anyway yr feelings r juz LIKE n we're not even steady..therefore i wasn't angry or upset..i'm reasonable..  Discovered tat DH went out on Tuesday 8th June wif Joelle, Desmond, Kai Li n Ivor to Sentosa!! Gosh..i like tat place n wanted to bring u there n u went there when u told me u were wif yr mum tat day?! Y tell me a lie? U know i'm straightfoward n will accept it if u tell me u wud be going out wif yr frenz..but i juz merely wanted to pass u the present..izit costing u a life? Was happy for u as enjoyed yrself n stuff but i dunno y u r kind of like avoiding me? Today is the 4th day i didn sms u n nvr start smsing?
