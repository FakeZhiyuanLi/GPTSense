      This is probably gona be the largest entry I have this is because I have all camp and stuff to tell plus I gota get some things straight with myself and typing helps.  Camp was awsome I saw all my friends from last year or at lest most of them with the exeption of jason danica Jeremy (bignose) ummm christin thats probably it.  I did mosty what i always did for activitys: canooing basketball rock climbing ultimate archery and stuff. But I tryed out umm sailing and dance sailing I took for a reason I will talk about further on  We went white water rafting it was "fucking awsome"  frase we shouted all through. Jake the couselor we had on the bote was a realy cool, inteligent, funny and  all around fun guy same whith mark the guy who guided us  he did the stearing for us and gave us instructions on wich side to paddle on. Befor rafting this guy told us about the  comands and safety regulations and adam was right the worse part of the whole trip whas the explanation of how we were gona die; or foot was gona get stuck under a rock and we'd sink and die. We went through some big waves nothing realy that exiting but we had a great time we realy did. They took us Ice skating it was awsome holding on to people makig them go fater, stoping with walls slaping maddys ass cus she slaped mine realy an awsome time. thirdly they took us to the clam fest at wich there where no clams regardless of whatever anyone says. Fell in love with gas stations; cheep soda. and last but not least they took us to the sea dogs game awsome we discovered that riple a baseball players  play cus thats the only way for them to get chiks. Taught dee take me out tothe ball game but she missed the 7th inning strech and couldnt sing take me out to the ball game wich was a shame cus it awas the only good thing bout the game. I met some realy interesting and awsome people : Deirdre (dee for short), Page, Christian , Lisa, Tiffany, Adam, Maddy Dee Is a realy awsome girl she's Irish wich makes her all the more awsome  and I have to send her a 4 leave clover from my brothers cus being Irish shes never seen one. Page is a realy cool girl whos a bit ummm well she thinks everybody hates her wich lots of people do but not everybody Christian  is a totaly awsome guy whom wich I had SOOO much fun we flashed maggie and did realy cool stuff I realy liked the guy oh we prtended to be a gay couple fun stuff. Addam is a realy cool guy who most people hat e but not me I liked him Maddy Is this realy hot girl from france who is awsomely cool. Lisa is a realy cool girl from Canada, she can be very understanding and is very sensitive in the way that she can "feel" when things arnt going too well for you and stuff like that. Tiffany oh where to start  sh's the reason I took sailing  she sailed I watched. She's a girl from France a very very good looking and hot girl. She is realy realy nice and realy sweet and can be a litle inpatient at some times but on the whole is an awsome girl whom I kinda fell for sh's the reason I took sailing  she sailed I watched even though I wasnt suposed to becasue of Pau but did anyway at first I told myself it would only be  for fun, harmless that I wouldnt fall so bad for her and would let go whene the time came but I sadly didn't, couldnt. we kinda went out for a wekk and then on the last day at councel fire we made out it was so ... well it felt so good I dont know I just loved it I cant stop thinking of that moment. Its probably just the impresion she made on me I'll probably get over it but its been over 2 weeks and I still cant get her out of my head eventhough I know I cant go out with her or anything since well she lives in france and has a boyfriend. Her and Pau are the only tow girls I've met with whom I can be myself just me and they still love me i dont have to prend they like me for whom I am. I know what I have to do but for some reason it doesnt seam right at least not  just yet. I gota get over it first.
