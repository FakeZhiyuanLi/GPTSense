        It appears China have said they will attack Taiwan before 2008, should Taiwan contiunue in their curring manner:  http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/98365/1/.html  This is well... bad. A country with billions of people, vs. well... a country who believe very strongly for what they are fighting for (their independece.) And what would happen if China did invade? Would the US help? Could the US help? All their resources are already tied up in Iraq... and lets be serious... they are running out of money. Australia? Umm... no. So what do I see happening? Well, first of all, we can say goodbye to cheap computers... since most computer components are made in Taiwan.... next we can say goodbye to cheap everything else... since everything else is made in China... and our countries would probably refuse to trade with China. So what do we need? Really, Taiwan to back down somewhat. I don't want to see them loose their independence... but it might be better in the long run. Down with communism. Down with China.  Why can't an island noone likes leave their country so no one cares... you know... like tasmania...

        A sick bag with 'bob' written on it turns out to be what made the pilot turn around yesterday, fearing it may stand for 'bomb on board'. Today many people were busy discussing whether he made the right decision. Did he make the right choice? I have no idea, but i do know one thing: the people who say it was stupid of him not to fly, would be the same ones to complain if he had done nothing and the plane had blown up. Serial wingers. Terrorists get called animals. Fair enough. But i ask you this: has an animal ever killed hundreds of his own kind... many of them innocent? In fact a normal citizen probably has more in common them a terrorist. There is nothing to compare such a lowly form of fighting too, yet it seems it is here to stay. Well... at least until China attacks the US. In other news... I am going to let go. Otherwise I think I might hurt myself. Life is a heartless Bitch. Heh... In other news, i just won the first official&nbsp; atomic debate. w00t! Too much tech is not bad.    &nbsp;  I've also decided I am going to try for advanced entry to uni at griffith. Its not where I want to end up, but I would love the feeling of knowing that at the very worse I am going to end up at griffith. Ultimately at the moment i would like to end up doing a dual degree at QUT. Really... I still don't know exactly what I want to do. Now I am starting to think psychology of some description would be cool. Ah... If only life was simple. 2 big plans for tomorrow, shall be interesting to see how both turn out. Apparently the headmaster has also announced that we will start school 5 minutes later, finish 5 minutes earlier AND get 5 minutes more at lunch. What a move! +1 to the headmaster. Why... For that i will even ignore the bad photoshop jobs of his head on various bodies. Thats gotta be worth something! Wow... Two PXT's worth of blogging tonight.&nbsp; i really have to sleep now. Tomorrow awaits!

        I can't stop thinking of you  You're always on my mind  These feelings deep inside me  Some I cannot hide  Your subtle words enchant me  Lead me from the path  Festering inside me  I want you in my life  If only things were simple  The greys all shades of white  Things moved down to simplicity  I feel you in my heart  The feeling feels of longing  The longing longs for hope  I hope that come one day  I have to hope no more

        There is a starting point for conversation. Our perception of reality is altered by hope. So  many things I look back on, and my actions look extremelly stupid, but hope is what seems to be  what drives them.   Something really annoys me at the moment, It's people who can't keep secrets. People who, for a  seconds attention of another, will go and spread something told to them by another in good  faith. Bitch Bitch Bitch. Its my blog... Deal with it. Why the appalling spelling, and entries  of almost always exactly 1000 letters? It's because i blog on my phone. I don't have time during  the day to sit down and blog... And so in bed or any time i am alone and bored, I blog away.   What's in the news? A terrorist scare at the sydney airport. Terrorists going to strike in aus.  Will it happen? dunno. Very scary thought though. The OC was on earlier. This show is now huge  at school. Why? Because these kids have it all: Money, happiness and the good life. Well, more  or less

        I find the michael moore situation an interesting one. On one side you have a manwho is twisting his facts to make a documentary... And on the other you also have peopletwisting facts to discredit him. It's hypocritical in the end. They are twisting his facts... Sothey can accuse him of twisting facts. In figure. meanwhile... More and more people are being taken hostage in iraq. The idea is from the capturespoint of view, is to blackmail some of the worlds countries into pulling troops out of iraq...Sure we know there troops should be there... Looking for the 'horrible' weapons of massdestruction. The thing i think most people overlook is who most of these hostages are. Most ofthem are people who have stayed in the country after being told to come home by there respectivegovernments. True... I hate to see anyone lose there head in the comfort of my lounge room...But there people realised that risk when they chose so stay in the country.

        I want to go to france. Sure they don't speak english... And hate anyone that does... But at least there government isn't as weak as shit. Over 150 countries in the unitednations had to vote on whether they believed that Isreal should have to tear down there fancy little wall. Guess what? Out of over 150 countries only 6 said they shouldn't have to. When youtake into account Isreal was one of them... The number comes down to 5. Let's now take out the 3 pacific islands...&nbsp;Whose definition of wall probably involves a picture a mud lump.&nbsp; Gollygosh... We are down to 2. You guessed it! Usa and their bum buddies... Australia! To say we support the&nbsp;US so if we possibly get attacked they will defend us is utter BS. If wekeep putting forward bullshit foreign policy there won't be and 'possibly' in the matter. Wewill get attacked. Come invade us indonesia! Lets face it... The way howard runs our governmentat the moment... We will&nbsp; deserve it! Yup, Aussie politics is fucked like a duck

        Max Ehrmann Desiderata  Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.  Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.  Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.  Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.  You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.  With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.       -------      I love the last line. Strive to be happy. Oh, what a challenge.

        Why is life never that simple? Why is life never life the nice margarine ads we all see on television?  Why?  It beats the shit out of me.  Feeling are never just happy sad angry or confused, not every emotion can be summed up by an emoticon, not every feeling with a word, every place with a picture or every situation with an example. World, why much you taunt me so?

        The things i blogged ever so briefly about yesterday are all coming to pass. My school appears to be in damage control. They need to be. Still on details on here. Try the CM tomorrow or the next day. Some of the things discussed around this whole debaskle, and other recent happenings in my life bring to life tonights blogging topic: promises and secrets. So often they are broken. Why do we tell people our deepest darkest secrets when we know it would destroy us if it got out. It seems to be an inbuilt human desire to share secrets. We tell others that which we promised to keep secret, for our 5 seconds of fame when this person shall look at us and think wow, thanks for telling me that. Its amazing how some people just cannot keep a secret. The only person that can be assured to keep a secret is number 1. I.e. Yourself. That's all for tonight... but shhh, please don't tell anyone that ;-)

        I had cross country today. I cam 90th... not tooooo bad. Thank God it is my last one though. The amount of cheating this year was huge.Ah well, I guess you get that.A few of the boarders have managed to get themselves into some pretty big trouble at school. I can't say much on here, but its pretty fast changing from rumour to truomour. Will be interesting to see if it makes the CM. Had my english assignment today and fucked it (understatement) Damn biased guidelines for starting assignments! Its ok for classes to start orals and hand in speeches days apart... yet it we write for 5 seconds too long in a test we get a frucking failure. cough* hippocrits *cough. Why don't they go spend more money on what they deem important, like flying the headmaster around the world while the school is falling to pieces? *cough*prefect shortage*cough* Its time for me to sleep now. I am exhausted from crossy. Goodbye.

        I'd like to say my life is like a roller coaster, at times I suppose it can be... but on the whole it is more like a merry-go-round. Circling around, the same charecters in my life, even if they have different faces and names. It's an endless loop. Apart from a large amount of assignments and homework I also visited UQ today. Damn it is an impressive campus. Looks like IPT at UQ might now be my first QTAC preference. I also spent this afternoon discussing ideas for the specwith troy. That man is a genius. I can't wait until the 9th of October. I have cross country tomorrow. Damn. I am not a cross country fan, but thanks to the fact that more and more people in my grade are filling their lungs with tar, my results seem to go up every year. I saw iROBOT last night. A frucking unreal movie. Funny, filled with action... and amazing special effects. Go see it. Its only let down is the slightly predicdable storyline, but oh well. English Oral some time this week : Thats all.

        WHat can I say. A new movie called 'Hero' by produced by Quinten Tarinteno (sp?) and from the director of crouching tiger... Considering I have heard no hype for this movie... I am well... shocked. The trailer makes it look about 5 times better then the matrix... and at least up there with LOTR. Looks better then all of them SFX wise. Check it out  urlLink   TRAILER

        Shutup, I couldn't think of anything starting with a S :P As you might guess we had a qcs practice test today... 3 in a day. My head now hurts. Its godamn torture and I hate it. Especially the writing task... damn writing task... just the way it looks at you, you know it wants to fuck you over :@ I love short response since i seem to do really well at it, and multiple choice is alright. Its a lot easier on the brain, especially when you add it up at the end and your numbers work out ok. Hooray for that! I doubt i will get any work done tonight... again... but hey... whats new. Bring on the weekend! Oh... and heres the spec poster, feel free to link as many people as you like to it by telling this URL:    http://www.sandstorming.com/spec04.jpg

        Wow, what a day. I woke to absolutely pouring rain. Great... walking in the rain. After sitting at the station for 25 minutes waiting for my train, we got on to be told it had been terminated. I am not going to go any further, except to say we went through 5 trains on our way to school. DAMN YOU qrail! Needless to say, we got to school late, and it turns out that some driver (possibly drunk) took out a bunch of lourdes girls walking to school. Dickhead. Needless to say, if he was drunk I hope he rots in hell. Day was pretty usual... nothing interesting. Mr Collins now has the dance tickets and poster, so they should be coming soooooon. Rain has stopped now and it is windy again. QCS practice allll day tomorrow. Hooray! (insert sarcasm here). Needless to say, I can't wait for the year to end (have I mentioned that before :P) I also got my english mark back today. A- for an oral off the top of my head. I make a good bullshit artist. Time to go bullshit on my 15 minute oral for english extension :| bye

        Another day closer to the end of the week Another day closer to QCS Another day closer to the end of the term Another day closer to the end of the year Another day closer to uni Another day closer to death (hopefully years and years away though)  I finally finshed the spec poster and ticket. I might post it here soonish. I am pretty happy with it... its very... ibizan. In other news... it seems the school owns 16 portable data projectors... sweet :D It also appears we represent aussie taking on the damn Kiwis in december now. Its ages away, but is interesting, since we (well andrew and I) will be representing the school when we are finished. Fuck I have a shitload of stuff i need to do in the next month. I need a plan. Maybe I shall plan soon. I should have planned a month ago. Damn

        Ewww... continuing to do my english extension talk on what I am going to do as a thesis. Its a 15 minute speech with 5 minutes of questions. I hate orals. My body is still really sore from drunk gymnatics. Damnit. My tailbone hurty hurty. I just finished a spec poster... tickets will follow in the next few days hopefully. Its a two colour poster... but not black and white... rather orange and white. I just had a thought... I could possibly try it in other colours... and white. So simple... will have to give it a go. Some time life scares me, amazing as that may seem. Its also amazing how fast word on somethings travel, and just how godamn immature some people really are. You know who you are Gl...

        Its funny, that after 11 years of school, that the last should go so fast. So far its been fun, but it is so quickly coming to an end. I've worked out, that this exam block I will only have 2 exams... most people have 5 or 6. I am going to be having a extremely easy exam block, since the two exams I have are usually on the first two days :) English I can't even study for. Thats all I feel like talking about for now... maybe I will talk more later tonight.

        When we touch.. I feel something happen When we breathe.. All the world is undone  Stay with me..! As my heart surrenders Comfort me..! As I fall I cry!  Standin' in the rain Twisted and insane We, are, holding onto nothing  Feeling every breath Holding no regrets We're still looking out for something  When we sleep Darkness brings us release All you need You can find it in me  Stay with me..! As my heart surrenders Comfort me..! As I fall I cry!  Standing in the rain Twisted and insane We are holding onto nothing  Feeling every breath Holding no regrets We're still looking out for something

        As you may see, this page is now being hosted back with blogger agagin. In the past I had been doing posting and everything from blogger and then uploading the blog to my host. I just changed hosts, and am having trouble getting the ftp to work, so I'll leave it here until i get the problem fixed :| Horay at the big banner at the top. I'm tired, and only slept like 3 hours last night. I should do some school work, but I don't have the motivation. I need something to motivate me.  Some things are reall strange. One such thing happened to me at Craigs last night. Its one of those things where its a one in a million chance, and you hear something and just think the conincidense in uncanny. I had my first driving test the other day, it was good to drive with someone other then mum and dad, who was able to help me with some of the other stuff... and tell me for instance: That I CAN go from 4th gear straight to 2nd. Go figure. Anyway, I am going to go for a drive now. Bye.
