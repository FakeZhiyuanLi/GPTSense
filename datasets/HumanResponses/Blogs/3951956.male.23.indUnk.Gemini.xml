      I am not a Scholar but a student of Islam. And it seems as if  this life is not enough to learn everything. For Islamic rulings which I am not sure about, just as other people go out looking for answers, I also do the same and ask those scholars whom I know and trsut. These are the scholars who spend their lives learning Islamic theology & science. They are humans like us but with far better knowledge of Islam than any common Muslim on the street. Their Job is to study Islam and go into its depths to find answers. And only then teach people, regular Muslims/Non-Muslims about the Fundamentals of Islam.      Taqlid literally means "to follow (someone)", "to imitate". In Islamic legal terminology it means to follow a mujtahid in religious laws and commandment as he has derived them. A mujtahid is a person who is an expert of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh); he is also called a faqih.  for details, please refer to these articles:   urlLink http://www.ummah.net/Al_adaab/fiqh/taqlid.html   and    urlLink http://www.al-islam.org/beliefs/practices/taqlid.html

      Hi folks, am back.. and this time I have a good news. www.Biogen.com, yes...i got a job in Biogen(Alhumdulillah). I will be working there as IT consultant and will be starting from 9th of August. Its a very big pharmaceutical company based in Cambridge, MA. I hope to get a place to live somewhere close by very soon. I am planning to move to Lowell, as there is a big Muslim Community there and a Mosque too. This would be an ideal place for me to live. Please, pray for me.   Anyways, I am happy and satisfied. ALLAH's Rehma is always there to help us all. I am here because of my Parent's hardwork and their prayers.   I just came back from Jumma Prayers. One thing I like about our Imam is that he uses one pharase quite often; in his speech or in his Khutbas...he saz, "ALLAH-O-AKBAR KABIRA". I think it means "ALLAH the GREAT and the Highest(in rank)". Meaning there is no one above his authority; and theres no doubt about that.

      Rains have flooded both Bangladesh and North East of India. Death toll in India has reached more than 1000 and almost 343 in Bangladesh. 75000 people in Bangladesh have been attacked by diarrhoea and almost 40% of the Dhaka city is under water. In some parts of the city, boats are te only way to move around. The drinking water pipes and the tanks have been contaminated with swerage water and now give smelly water. It looks like most of slums have been totally destroyed and thousands and thouands of people have lost their houses, family members and friends.   This is one of worst disasters of this year for south east Asia. I wish I could be of any help to my brothers and sisters their. Let us all pray for their early recovery and help from ALLAH. InshaALLAh , they will soon find their way out of this devastation.

      yesterday, at around 8 'o clock, we went to our mosque here in Lowell. It was Friday and there were alot of people there. The imam sahib promised us that we are going to have a Muslim Lawyer after Maghrib prayers who will speak about the importance of "Will" in USA. Right after Maghrib prayers, Mr. Ahmed, a renowned Lawyer in Mass, was ready with his power point presentation to talk about the concept of Will and the legalities behind it. According to him, everyone (specialy, Muslims living here in USA) should have a Will written before our death. The main reason behind this is if some parents die in an accident and they leave behind their kids and their property which goes to Satate of Mass(if theres no Will). And according to him, the court then decides where to send these kids for their upbrining. They can send it to any house, it can be a cristian house or it can be a Muslim house. But in most cases these Muslim Orphans end up in Non-Muslims houses if they dont hav any gardians. So, its very impotant for a muslim family here in USA to have their Will written befre anything bad happens. try visiting this website for more details on WIll Writing:  http://www.uslegalwills.com/  Or try to contact your local lawyers for further inforation on will writing.  -------------------------------------------------  and yes, after this presentation we had lot of food...biryani, chicken korma, mix-subzi, cake, zurdah.....it was a beautiful night. MashaALLAH, alot of Muslims were their with their families. The kids were enjoying, running around, ppl chating witheach other on different topics, a very good gathering....and then after pryaing isha we left at around 11 to head back home.  -------------------------------------------------

      a message from Answering-Ansar.org -----------------------------------------------  Salaam Olaikom Dear Readers,  Our book on Azadari has been published. This topic was under writing by the AA team for nearly year and a half, but it took much longer than anticipated due to heavy workload of translating the material in to english.  We recieved a lot of help from the readers of the AA, who offered voluntary service for this project. Our thanks goes to the below individuals who helped us immensely in translating the material and making the publication of this book possible:  1. Moulana Ali Shahid, P.Eng. (Canada) 2. Mujahid Husain Jafri (India) 3. Syed Munawar Hussain (Pakistan) 4. Syed Yasir Ali (Canada) 5. Anonymous (Pakistan)  Azadari; Mourning for Imam Hussain [as] The mourning rituals in the memory of the martyrdom of Imam Hussain [as], the grandson of Mohammad [saww]. Azadari is the core of the Islamic belief, and in this book we shall refute all common Nasibi propaganda against the mourning rituals for the martyrs.  As soon as the moon of Muharam al-Haram appears, the Mullahs express their outrage at mourning for Imam Husayn (as) and pledge to get mourning processions banned. Nasibi websites are flooded with articles against mourning for Imam Husayn (as)...  Click  urlLink here  to read the full Book.   Wa'Salaam, Answering-Ansar.org team http://www.answering-ansar.org

      today's Friday....16th of july '04...I just got back from Friday Prayers. It was different today. The Imam of the mosque was not there for the Khutba. Instead it was someone else who started the Khutba with a very polite voice. His voice was very different from other Khateebs. It was very pleasent to listen to him as he went on with his Khutba. The Mosque started to fill.     Soon, I heard something very interesting. The Khateeeb (Imam) started talking about Iraq. Actually, he belonged to a human relief organization which is working in Iraq. He said that his organization is approved from the US Authorities and has a licencse to opperate in Iraq. They are collecting funds to help the Iraqi people. He said that his main goal today is to collect 15ooo to 20000 USD to start a mobile clinic in the worst hit cities of Iraq. This mobile clinic will go around different cities and will help people with their medical needs.    After the prayers, the khateeb stood up and started asking people to help him out in achieving his today's target of 15000USD. Without any exaggeration, I would say that there were almost 150 people in the mosque(Inclusing children and women) and with the grace of ALLAH, the target was achieved within 5 to 6 mins. MashaALLAH...what a blessing.     With the help of ALLAH and some kind hearted people around, I am sure we can make this world a happier and more peaceful place to live.     -syed

        by S.S Hamid     A solemn and simple occasion like a marriage has unfortunately created several serious social problems for us. It is no doubt a desirable thing, besides being a religious obligation as far as the Valima is concerned, to entertain family members and friends when two people become man and wife. But the way our wedding functions are arranged and celebrated these days sometimes borders on absurdity, resulting in immense wastage of food, money and time. It also results in a great deal of inconvenience to the invitees, who come from all parts of the city and even outside.   The process starts when a mother begins looking for a bride for her son. The boy himself may be a poor specimen and may belong to the middle class or even lower, but his mother wishes to find for him a girl who is tall, slim, pretty and educated. More importantly, her parents should be rich enough to give their daughter loads of jewellry, furniture, refrigerator, colour TV, crockery, cutlery, etc. A car would be most welcome and would go a long way to establish the bride's rating as a daughter-in-law. Of course she has also to bring clothes for the relatives of the groom. The list might include anybody else as distantly related as possible. The key point here is that you should not leave anything undone in any respect if you wish to see your daughter happily married.   For several days before the wedding the houses of the bride and the groom are illuminated by hundreds of colourful electric bulbs. Punctuality is the worst sufferer on such occasions. If you are invited at 8pm 'sharp', you can safely go at 10pm and still be ahead of many others who will keep trickling in even after 11pm. Most likely, when you make it to the venue of the wedding, even the Barat might not have arrived. The anxious host will keep assuring people that the wedding party is on its way and expected to arrive any moment. Nobody seems to be in a hurry. Little boys and girls decked in their finest clothes run about to keep the proceedings lively, fires have not yet been lit under the dishes containing food, the liveried staff of the caterer is sitting and yawning and waiting to serve the equally frustrated and famished guests. Some professional match makers utilize the time to do some business by going round and questioning pretty girls present there to find out their names, the names of their parents and their addresses to explore the possibility of finding suitable matches for them. The neverending search for prospective brides continues at all marriages while the arrival of Barat is awaited.   Every wedding ceremony is accompanied by at least six functions, spread over two weeks, when the bride-to-be comes under the focus of the girls' family. She is made to wear yellow clothes, which she has to don until the day of her marriage, known as Mayun. Beating of the ceremonial drums starts and continues for the rest of the week. During this time, she remains surrounded by friends. It is essentially a function that is arranged to put the girl in the right frame of mind, but now Mayun is also held for grooms for fun.   On day three, Rasm-i-Hina or Mehndi takes place for the girl. The boys' mother and sisters, accompanied by their relatives and friends, take henna to the girls' house and the next day the compliment is returned by the girls' family. This takes us to day four. These functions are supposed to be exclusive purview of females of the two sides, but many boys also gate-crash the functions, of course with the connivance of the elders. These functions provide a good opportunity for young boys and girls to see and be seen for future matchmaking. The girls come dressed to kill and are even encouraged by their mothers to look their best.   All Mehndi functions are held with gay abandon, with loads of singing and dancing. The latest fad is that everybody should wear yellow clothes and shoes. Even the colour of the shamiana should match. An important event of the evening is the display of the dowry being given to the bride. Clothes and ornaments of the bride are laid out in a separate section and everybody is invited to see what the girls' parents have done to ensure that their daughter leaves their home well-provided for.   On day five, that is D-Day, the arrival of the Barat is the highlight of the show. The Barat takes its own sweet time to arrive. The Nikah takes place with signatures on the marriage contract. The bride is dressed in all her finery while asked three times in the presence of two witnesses if she agrees to marry her intended. The same question is also put forth to the groom in a separate section. As soon as this is done, everybody rushes to be the first to congratulate the groom and his parents, followed by warm embraces. While the wedding feast is still in progress or even before, an elaborate session of photography commences at the stage where every relative and friend of the groom and the bride gets himself, or herself, photographed with the new couple. If delayed, some of the guests start leaving even though they have had nothing to eat. The activity on the stage, however, continues for another hour or so. The time for departure of the newly-wed couple finally arrives and they walk to their car, followed by the girls' mother, brothers and sisters.   The bride's departure from her parents house is symbolized by the Rukhsati that takes place amid much sobbing and crying by the girl, her parents and close relatives and friends. Valima follows the next day or the day after that, and is supposed to be the drop scene of the drama.   All these functions are spread over as many days and each function has to be held with pomp and ostentation and, of course, eating to ones heart's content. It is all right for those who can afford to indulge in that kind of luxury. But others who are not so fortunate have to follow week-long drill just for face-saving, even if they have to borrow money from friends and relatives to put up the show. At the end of it all, the bride's father is left to foot the bill, while everybody congratulates him for having discharged the responsibility successfully.   Although we talk a lot about simplicity, one finds that nobody likes to practice it. You will find the most vocal social reformers (male or female} unashamedly doing all, if not more, when the time comes for marriages of their own sons and daughters.

       Sports and Nationalism   --one of my school papers; feel free to comment and criticise    Webster’s has defined nationalism as loyalty and devotion to a nation. An expanded definition of Nationalism states, " the devotion to the interests or culture of one's nation or the doctrine that national interest, security are more important than the international considerations.” Sports and Nationalism have a strong correlation between each other. Sports are a significant means through which nations and states socialize into common norms and values by showing a common display of patriotism and unity. Sports play a vital role in the building of nation-states and nationalist sentiments among the people. The opening ceremonies for a lot of sporting events display a huge amount of patriotic symbols and signs. Singing of the National anthem, the parade of each nation into the stadium with their flag and different kinds of pledges of allegiance show how closely sports and Nationalism are related.  Sports help in boosting morale and refining nation’s norms and customs. However, sports also have a strong bond with the political structure of a nation. This is because sports closely relate the political apparatus and the symbolic ideology of a nation. Sporting events are also considered as one of the basic reasons of increased conflicts and tensions among the international community. Goodhart and Chataway define Olympics Games as “war without Weapons”. In the “war without weapons” thesis, it has been well defined that sports are a substitute for armed conflict because nations can engage in it without doing themselves or others any material damage.  Sports ability to unite people on one platform is a highly influential way of bringing people together to support their nation. Citizens of a state provide a unique display of public and political opinions when they cheer for their nation’s representatives on the field. Their slogans and banners show their nationalistic ideology. Sports also provide good means of bringing people of a nation closer to each other. Regardless of their minor differences like age, sex, ethnicity or language, sports give citizens of a nation, a unique identification under one flag. On the international level, sports helps in increasing national prestige and importance.   The Olympics were designed to erase differences among the nations of the world but they were misused by many nations. “Outside of war the Olympics may well be the world’s most visible forum of Nationalism”, New York times columnist “Edward Wong” once rote in his article “The World; Olympic Cheer: Put Out More Flags”.    For instance, Americans in the eighties focused on how the USSR was different from the United States. American and Soviets focused on the differences of their opponents rather than focusing on the essence of the game itself. These obsessions of athletes made the Olympics more than just a sporting event. The public started taking Olympic arenas as battlefields and their athletes as soldiers fighting for their nationalistic ideology.   Some of the other examples of nations who take the sports ground as a battlefield are Pakistan and India. Nationalism is at its peak during these matches between the two cricket-mad nations. Sports do not get more serious than their games. The British novelist Alan Sillitoe once wrote “sport is a means of keeping the national spirit alive during a time of so-called peace. It prepares the national spirit for the eventuality of war”. This is quite true in the case of Pakistan and India. The game of cricket becomes a matter of life and death for national pride. The fans on both sides find it difficult to separate national pride from an artistic appreciation of the game. Cricket is a sport that easily reaches out to the public. Since their independence in 1947, Pakistan and India have played each other much less  frequently than they have played against other countries. Most of the time, the two teams faced strong political resistance to play against each other. For example, in Feb 1999, after  strong resistance from the Indian political party Shiv Sena, Pakistan toured India for the Asian test Championship. To stop this series, Shiv Sena dug up the pitch of the ground and threatened to attack Pakistani players physically.   In a close encounter of their first match, Pakistan won but only after the Umpire ruled against the star Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar. This led to a huge protest from the crowd and the throwing of bottles at the Pakistani players. In the end, Pakistan gained victory only in front of an empty stadium. In both India and Pakistan, the national cricketers feel that they have to defend their countries national pride by winning the match. After losing against India in World Cup 2003, Pakistani players went home in fear. Demonstrations were held against them in their own country and their posters were set on fire. This showed an extreme example of aggressive nationalism.  National sentiments only excel when a nation wins the tournament or the game but a defeat drives the citizens or the members of the nation away from their athletes. This is the reason that people invest millions and billions of dollars on sports. This brings a great responsibility on the shoulders of athletes and teams to show their best on the field. Sometimes athletes cheat on international games to maintain their nation’s pride and respect.  This brings a shame and disgrace for the whole nation if an athlete is caught in such act.  Hence, athletes are considered as the ambassadors of nations who represent nation’s ideology and norms. These examples show that sports seem to have both the ability to increase nation’s pride and respect and to decrease it.   Soccer, like the Olympics, reveals another simple and clear point that national pride and patriotism rules the field when two Soccer teams face each other in Soccer World Cup. In this modern era, Soccer enjoys worldwide popularity. In some parts of South America and Europe the World Cup Soccer games are compared to war between two countries. Many Japanese now believe that the Soccer event stimulates more Nationalism than Olympic. This is because Soccer being the most popular sport provides a unique opportunity for the hundreds of thousands of people to reaffirm their commitment towards norms and values that their Nationalist ideology gives them. Mike Cronin’s “The history of Irish sport and Nationalism”, explores the phenomenon of the modern sport and the development of Nationalism in the country. He says that soccer symbolizes an Ireland that Gaelic games cannot because they are not played internationally. Ireland’s qualification for World Cup in 1990 and 1994 redefined Irish Nationalism.   It is an irony that even in this modern era, sports are taken as a basis for developing nationalism and showing international community a legitimate way of protesting against other national ideologies. For example, many countries in 1980 refused to go for Moscow games because of Soviet’s invasion over Afghanistan. And again as revenge Soviet Union did not attend 1984 Los Angeles Olympic games.  Although it is true that not all governments have the same approach towards Sports, but many states and nations take sports as a main building block to present their political ideologies.    Sport is an appropriate venue for the expression of nationalistic spirit as it provides a common platform for all nations to present their views. As almost all nations have worldwide passion for Sports, this common uniformity has become a good source of nations to compete for their ideologies on international level. In Conclusion Sports and most of the big sporting events are the sites of production of Nationalism. They provide extreme boosting to the Nationalist beliefs. The modern Olympic Games show an extreme example of Nationalism where all the great nations of the world try to compete not only for the sake of the game, but also to defend their Nations ideologies. And these nationalistic ideologies in turn attempt to establish an absolute separation between the citizens of different nations and states. But at the same time one should not confuse Nationalism with Patriotism. When nationalism starts putting other nations down at the expense of your own nation then it deserves a bad name but being proud of your country and your norms and values means your Patriotic and not Nationalistic.

       Changing Gears-- Salim Vasani's point of view   I went through hundreds of web pages and articles to figure out what I could write here on this page. Well obviously, the initial idea was that of Copy-Paste ----Thanks to Microsoft. (For their Cut, Copy, Paste feature).  But as I went through these articles there was more and more confusion. All the articles trying to justify something, defend something.     I asked myself—Do we really need to justify some of these things.  Do we need to justify why a Muslim woman covers her body.  Do we need to justify why illegal sex is not allowed in Islam.  Do we need to justify why Abortion is not prescribed.   I think this is common sense. If someone does not understand this then I am sorry but you are not MODERN but an uncivilized person with a lack of common sense.  If we look at history we will know that all the characters these so called MODERN ACTIVISTS are trying to enforce were typical to the Barbarians. It is unjust on our part to blame the early humans for their behavior as they did not have a proper guide. But for the Modern man, God has provided an excellent guide in the form of Quraan. There is the Hadith of the Prophet (PBUH) which shows us a way of life. This is what makes us different from the early Barbarians.  Now coming back to the issue of Female Rights. My friend kept telling me not to write on this topic as the topic was very sensitive.  Yes!! Sensitive it was. But more confusing.  Call me dumb but even after all these years of education and training it is difficult for me to figure out the meaning of Female rights and Freedom.  A couple of weeks ago I saw a TV ad in which a woman was trying to say that she did not know what she would have done if she did not Abort her child and that it was a question of her freedom. Yeah right.  A lot of females I Know tell me how wearing short skirts and deep necks makes them feel confident.  If you think deeply, you would realize that a lot of these Modern girls do not have any other way to show their confidence or gain attraction.  I think these so called Modern girls have compromised their freedom and fallen into the trap of some wrong people who are using this sensitive issue to manipulate and corrupt the society in the name of Liberalism.  Muhammad Ali, the legendary Boxer gave a very good example to his daughter. He said that beautiful and precious stones were not found easily and were hidden.  Think for yourself; if diamonds and pearls were found everywhere would they have their value?  A woman’s body is her treasure. And besides as they say “Beauty is not in showing but in hiding.”  Some of the arrogant people give example of difference of sexes in Islam without thinking too hard.  No where does it say in Islam that a woman is supposed to cover her body and man is allowed to go out naked.   People usually only discuss ‘hijab’ in the context of women. However, in the Glorious Qur’an, Allah (swt) first mentions ‘hijab’ for men before ‘hijab’ for the women. The Qur’an mentions in Surah Noor: "Say to the believing men that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty: that will make for greater purity for them: and Allah is well acquainted with all that they do." [Al-Qur’an 24:30].  It doesn’t say in Islam that a woman cannot have illegal sex and a man can have it at his own will. It is prohibited for both men and women.  It doesn’t say that a woman is supposed to worship Allah and is responsible for her sins while a man can commit all the sins and is exempt from punishment and worship to Allah.  Both men and women are equally accountable for their actions and are liable to punishment for their sins irrespective of their sexes.  I used to think that Rights mean right to vote, to elect, right to education, right for a woman to say no to a guy who wants to have a relation without committing to marry.     Probably I am backwards.  But still I insist that we Muslims don’t have to justify why a Muslim woman wears a Hijab.  We don’t have to give examples of woman wearing a Hijab and driving a Car or a girl wearing a Hijab and going to school.  We don’t have to justify why going to filthy Night clubs or having illegal relations without marriage are prohibited in Islam.  We don’t have to justify why Muslims believe that Paradise lies in the feet of the Mother.     IT IS TIME THEY JUSTIFY.  Justify,  How a barely dressed woman being stared by a million eyes feels free?  How a girl wearing a Hijab and going to a renowned school like IIT is backward?  How a woman giving in to guys for improper reasons is free and a woman who refuses to be used and thrown is not?  It is about time they start justifying. NOT US.     Hey Muslim woman practice your Rights.  You are free.  Be confident. You don’t have to justify.      ---------------------------------------------Salim Vasani                                                         IIT Alumni (MS-Computer Science)

      AsSalam-o-Alaikum  20th Jamdi-us-Sani 1425 A.H. - Birth anniversary of the leader of the women of the world and Paradise – Hazrat Fatima Zahra(s.a.).  On this occassion of hapiness in the household of Prophet Mohammad(pbuh&hf), I wish to felicitate the Prophet Mohammad(pbuh&hf), Imam-e-Zamana(a.s.), the Ahl-e-Bait(a.s.) and all Momineen and Mominaat.  In keeping with the practice of the followers of Ahl-e-Bait(a.s.), please offer nazrana and special prayers on this auspicious day to renew your allegience to Prophet Mohammad(pbuh&hf) and his Ahl-e-Bait(a.s.).  Please also recite the Ziarat of Hazrat Fatima Zahra(s.a.) located in the "Madina/Hazrat Fatima Zahra(s.a.)/Ziarat" Page. A link to the audio and text of which is located in the "Whats New" Section on the main page at http://www.ziaraat.com.  Note: 20th of Rabi-us-Sani is the 7th of August in almost all parts of the world.  Here is some important information about Hazrat Fatima Zahra(s.a.):  Fatima(s.a.) The Radiant ======================== Imam Hasan Askari(a.s.) reported that his father quoted Jabir Ibn Abdullah as saying : ' The Messenger of Allah, Peace be Upon him and his cleansed progeny, said : ' When Allah created Adam and Eve, they strutted through paradise and said : ' Who are better than we ? ' At that moment they noticed an image of a girl like they had never seen before; from this girl came an illuminating light so bright that it almost blinded the eyes. They said : ' O Lord, what is this ? ' He answered : ' This is the Image of Fatima(s.a.), the mistress of your women descendants. '  Lisan Al Mizan Volume 3 page 346  Hazrat Fatima Zahra's(s.a.) other names: ======================================= Az-Zahra: She was named by Allah(swt), as Az-Zahra because her Holy Light used to shine among those brighter in all The Heavens.  Batool: Because of her absolute Purity attained from Paradise from The Heavens. And also because, The Lady Fatimah Al-Zahra, is not like all the other women in the world.  Siddiqah: The Honest, The Righteous Al-Mubarakah: The Blessed One Al-Tahirah: The Virtuous, The Pure Al-Zakiyah: The Chaste, The Unblemished Al-Radhiatul Mardhiah: She who is gratified and who shall be satisfied Al-Muhaddathah: A person other than a Prophet, that the angel's speak too Al-Zahirah: The Luminous  The Holy Prophet, her Father(pbuh&hf), loved her very much Whenever she would go to the house of her father The Holy Prophet(pbuh&hf) would stand up out of respect to her. Whenever he greeted her, and he would honour her by giving her a special place to seat herself in his house. Very often Her Father(pbuh&hf) would softly kiss her hands and say, "Allah, The Most High; is pleased when Fatimah(a.s.) is pleased. He is angered; whenever Fatimah is angered!"  He(pbuh&hf) also said: "Fatima is part of me. Whoever angered her angered me and whoever angered me angered Allah".  Probably the most important ayat revealed in Quran about the sinlessness of her and the family of the Holy Prophet(pbuh&hf) is the following:  "...Allah only desires to keep away the uncleanness from you, O people of the House! and to purify you a (thorough) purifying" - Sura Ahzab (33:33) translation by M.M.Shakir.  'Her Prayer' ============ One day the Holy Lady Fatimah Al-Zahra(s.a.) was taught by her Father, The Holy Prophet(pbuh&hf), a very special kind of Prayer. That he himself was shown earlier by The Trusted Archangel Jibrael(a.s.).  This special After-Prayer is to be said after each time, any Prayer of Worship is concluded.The Holy Lady(s.a.) in turn began to teach the short Prayer to so many others that in the very short time, it became to be known as the 'Prayer of Fatimah Al-Zahra(s.a.).  The Prayer ========== This prayer consists of recitation as follows: 34 times ALLAHO AKBAR 33 times AL-HAMDO LILLAH 33 times SUBHAN ALLAH  Most or if not all of the Mujtahideen express a great Mustahab (preferable) as near to as Wajib (compulsory) to say this Prayer after any Prayer of Worship is concluded.

      AsSalam-o-Alaikum  13th Jamadi-us-Sani 1425 A.H. - the death anniversary of Hazrat Fatima bint-e-Hazm bin Khalid (also known as Umm-ul-Baneen) – the wife of Imam Ali(a.s.) and mother of Hazrat Abbas(a.s.)  On the sad occassion of her death anniversary, I wish to extend my condolences to Prophet Mohammad(pbuh&hf), Imam Zamana(a.s.), the Ahl-e-Bait(a.s.) and to all Momineen and Mominaat.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Hazrat Fatima binte Hazam bin Khalid Ibn-e-Rabi'e Ibn-e-Amer Kalbi belonged to the clan of Banu Kilah, which was one the noblest families amongst the Hashimites and famous for the bravery and valour of its warriors.  She was born in 5 A.H. Some years after the martyrdom of Hazrat Fatima Zahra(s.a.), Imam Ali(a.s.) expressed his desire to his brother Aqil bin Abu Talib(a.s.) to marry a women of a brave and warrior tribe. Hazrat Aqeel was a very knowledgeable in tribe genealogy and he immediately proposed the name of Hazrat Fatima binte Hazam bin Khalid and the marriage took place soon after.  Much earlier during 8 A.H., Imam Ali(a.s.) had been given the prophecy by Prophet Mohammad(pbuh&hf) of a brave son who would be martyred alongside with his brother Imam Hussain(a.s.) on the day of Ashura. Eversince then, Imam Ali(a.s.) had been waiting for the birth of that son which came in the person of Hazrat Abbas(a.s.).  Hazrat Umm-ul-Baneen came to the house of Imam Ali(a.s.) knowing very well that before her the chief of the women of paradise, Hazrat Fatima Zahra(s.a.) was living in that house. She served Imam Ali(a.s.) in the same manner as Hazrat Umm-e-Salma had served the Holy Prophet(pbuh&hf)after the demise of Hazrat Khadija(a.s.). Immediately stepping in  the house, she vowed herself to act as a slave of the children of Hazrat Fatima(s.a.). Her sincerity was much respected by the children of Hazrat Fatima(s.a.) that they always gave her a high status and respect.  Fatima Binte Hazam was an accomplished and cultured lady, and bore Hazrat Ali's four sons, Abbas, Abdullah, Jafer and Usman. The meaning of 'Ummul Baneen' is 'Mother of Sons'. All of her sons were martyred along with Imam Husain. After their martyrdom, she requested people not to call her 'Ummul Baneen' ever again. When Imam Husain(A.S.) was leaving Madinah for Iraq Hadrat Ummul Baneen asked her four sons, Hadrat Abbas(A.S.), Abdulla, Ja'far and Usman to sacrifice their lives in the sacred cause of Imam Husain(A.S.).  On 10th Muharram 61A.H.,the day of martyrdom of Imam Husain(a.s.) and his 72 faithful companions at the battlefield of Karbala when Hadrat Umme Salamah witnessed that the earth in the bottle given to her by the Holy Prophet(pbuh&hf) had turned into blood she raised the cry of "Ya Husain" Ya Husain" and declared that Imam Husain(a.s.) has been martyred according to the prophecy foretold to her by the Holy Prophet(phuh&hf) about the martyrdom of Imam Husain(a.s.).  Then Ummul Baneen gathered women of Madinah in her house and all cried for the martyrdom of Imam Husain(a.s.).This was the first ever Majlis conducted after the martyrdom of Imam Husain(a.s.). Ummul Baneen had such sincerity toward the Holy Prophet's progeny that she loved Imam Hussain(a.s.) more than her own children. A feeling which was from the bottom of her heart. It was to the extent that when she received the news stating the martyrdom of her four children, she said: "Tell me about Hussain (A.S.)" and when she received the news of Imam Hussain (A.S.)'s martyrdom she said: "All of the arteries of my heart are torn. May all of my  children and what ever that exists under this azure heaven be sacrificed for the sake of Imam Hussain (a.s.).  The First Noha Recitor of the martyrdom of Imam Hussain(a.s.). After the arrival of Imam Sajjad(a.s.) and Hazrat Zainab(s.a.) in Madinah Hadrat Ummul Baneen used to gather women in her house and used to narrate them how Imam Husain(a.s.) and his companions were martyred by Yazidi forces.  Hadrat Ummul Baneen was a great poet and she is considered as the first Noha (lamentation poetry) reciter for the martyrdom of Imam Husain(a.s.).She used to visit regularly the famous Jannat al-Baqi cemetery in Madinah and recite her Nohas in a very sad and pathetic voice that everybody present there used to weep bitterly. She transformed the Jannat al-Baqi cemetery in Madinah as "the Centre of Azadari of Imam Husain(a.s.)". The Nohas recited by Hadrat Ummul Baneen for the martyrdom of Imam Husian(a.s.) are recorded in history and are considered as masterpieces in Arabic literature. It is recorded in historical accounts that Hadrat Ummul Baneen died on 13th Jamadi us-Sani 64 A.H. and was buried in the Jannat al-Baqi cemetery in the holy city of Madinah.
