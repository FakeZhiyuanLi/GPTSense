						   ... but I am working, even though... Or at least trying to ! The week-end alone went by rather fast, and I managed to clean entirely Christophe's office. It looks great now (don't know how long this will last !). I bought some picture frames to hang a few posters he has had for decades and never hung up, got a few more for my pictures, and I will have my brother in law Luc (the only one with some technical skills in the family) to do the holes in the wall next week-end.  Benoît spent four days with his mother and now is back. I have to take him with me to work every day, because, even if he is fourteen, I do not want to leave him alone at home : we have a swimming pool and one never knows what can happen, especially with his friends coming over to play. But he doesn't seem to mind being here : he has been reading all morning and watching video tapes. He is quiet and very accomodating, so it really is not a problem. I have received some news from a very old friend yesterday and it is great to hear about people you have lost touch with, not because you did not care, but just because life comes and goes and it is hard to keep track of everyone when moving so often : I just calculated that, when I settled in Saint Mamans 5 years ago, I had already moved 17 times ! Now, I am not very anxious to have to go through the hassle of finding and moving to a new place, and I am not alone any more. We have celebrated our fifth anniversary just a few weeks ago ! Does this mean I am becomming reasonable, adult, or worse : old ?  When I will be on vacations, I promise myself I would print out Bonnie's weblog from yesterday (the cleaning program) and try to do as well in my own house... Another wishful thinking ?

						   ...Clean my husband's desk while he is away (wicked, don't you think so !?) ...Earn (or win) plenty of money in order to go back to the States for a visit ...finish reading some books that have been piling up (lack of time ?... or lack of organisation ?) ...dive into the swimming pool without having to clean it first (too much wind and leaves in the area !) ...loose 40 kg in (how do you say this in English ?) "the wink of an eye"?  Day dreaming... But maaaayyyybeee, I'll get around to do the first thing on my list during the coming week-end. The weather is better today, and we have talked with Benoît about next year and what to do... We'll see how it turns out...He is much more busy planning his summer's fun time and reading Lemonny Snicket than thinking about school ! That's life...

						   So, here it is... Benoît has to go to a technical school, because his teachers think that he won't make it in the regular school system. I do not disagree with them, but what kind of orientation process can one follows when only fourteen ? He hasn't the foggiest idea about his future !  Otherwise, the weather is not exciting : "grey" and "heavy" seem to describe it correctly. But maybe it just goes with my mood today, and Christophe who is gone for ten days to Germany, and ... and... I have to give myself a good kick, because depression is on its way. Bouh... It will be better tomorrow !

						   Now, I am begining to understand how it works... Making great progress ! (Maybe not in English, so...)  Nothing really exciting in life right now, except that tonight, we are going to Benoît's "conseil de classe" (something like a end-of-the-year meeting with all the teachers) and he has not been doing well at all, so I fear for his future in school. I know he may discover in a year or two what he really likes and want to do (and do it well), after all he is only fourteen, but in the French school system, you have to keep at least average grades in about everything in order to go from one level to the other. And you have some subjects in which he has the equivalent of a D in the American system... So, we'll see and hope it gets better next year ! That's all, folks (for now) !

						   Hé non, y'a pas la clim !... Alors, on souffre en silence de la chaleur ! L'ère post-moderne (clim et tout cela) s'est arrêtée au premier étge, où sont les salles de formation informatique (normal, au delà de 38 °C, les ordinateurs n'aiment pas trop !), mais pour les pauvres humains que nous sommes, pas de clim. La machine est mieux traitée que l'homme !!! I was wondering (and now it is my time to practice some English !) what LOL means ? I see it used fairly often on websites and I haven't been able to figure out what this acronym is supposed to mean.... One more week of work and IT WILL BE VACATION TIME ! Waoh, I can't wait ! Tomorrow we have our traditional end-of-the-school-year-meeting with all the people working for the Regional Center, divided into five departement (county) centers. It should be fun, by a very nice place called Le Lac d'Annecy (about two hours from where I live). It is really very picturesque and beautiful...  Kristi said Benoît is very lucky to have me as a stepmother... I do not know ! You see, it is hard sometimes to know what to do exactly, to understand his reactions, and I think we got to take care of him far too late to really make a "change" in his life. I truly do not know how to help him sometimes, and it is true that loosing our baby a year and a half ago was maybe even more difficult from the fact that he was there, and that my little girl was no more. But it had nothing to do with him, and I did my best to not make him feel "unwelcomed", even if sometimes it would have been easier to just let go and cry "poor little me!". But when someone depends from your daily care, even if he is not totally your "own", you have to keep on going, and so at the same time it was a blessing to have him there. But as far as his school results go, there is alas no miracle... We'll see next year !  That's all for tonight... take care, all of you who read those lines, and ...until next time !
