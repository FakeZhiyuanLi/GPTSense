      Everyone knows I like the word "slacker". Makes me think of Principle Strickland with a shotgun every time.  But I don't want a hole lotta luvin lead in me. I have to study! You'd think that, with the gift of time, I would actually study hard for my last two exams. Get some As in there. However, Law and Information Retrieval are very boring subjects.  Very  very boring. No matter how many times we amuse ourselves with Iadh's "the Googles bombs" and "jigabytes of pages", we just can't hack it.  One thing I have been on top of, like a rampant...thing...ahem, is my visa application. The kind secretary at NTT remarked that "this is the fastest case I have ever arranged". God bless those hard working souls at DHL. The sooner it gets finalised, the sooner I can leave! Right now, I'm sitting at about t - 5 weeks. Last exam is at t - 3 days. That there's a lot of "slack".  While sorting the paperwork, I try to remind myself that "the exams will be over soon" and "you will not have to fake your own death after seeing the project difficulty". Those thoughts serve me better than that of the moving cost!  &lt;/slack&gt; Back to work :(

      "Goat some cream fur ma Ichiban?" A joke that occurred more than once on the way to the restaurant. Both of us, being in the same Japanese class, and having reasonable pronunciation, should have known better.  That place being, after all, where it started. Well...not technically. It had been gone over before with a  urlLink good friend  at uni. He suggested that it should start forthwith. He showed me his, and I, not hindered by shyness, could not show him mine. However, I thought I knew better. "I don't need it", I thought. "What use have I for it?", I insisted. But, as rarely happens, I was persuaded. Albeit a few days later.  We chatted normally at the restaurant, and caught up with things we had missed. The suggestion came from another classmate (I'm not sure if he could have shown me his). The idea was that I would use it in Japan - during my job there. "A sound idea", thought I. A sound idea indeed, for last time, I did not have one, nor anything like it.  So there it began, I guess, at Ichiban.  It? You're reading it.

      Every time! Every time I go to the range or for a game of golf, something ugly happens to my hands. Then I have to play in significant digital pain. Today it was my forefinger which had a nice slice (ho ho) of skin subtracted from it. That is the official reason I still suck...no really.  So what's happened so far? Well, I'm still heading to Japan, which is good. I went to meet my supervisor and advisor, and things look ok. Today I passed the moment which is exactly one week, to the hour, to when I leave! Wee I was so excited!  During that moment of elation, I was involved in moving the remainder of my belongings to my parents. One thing is for sure, I have too much crap. I mean really, wtf. All that remains are my (big) bed and my golf clubs (for easy access). My mum said there's no way the couch is coming back, so the chap who's moving in gets it. Moving it out was bad enough, but tomorrow I have to cart it up another two sets of stairs to the loft! Geeza hon big man! This was the even during which said finger was reduced in mass.  Now that I have my PC, and varying peripherals, back I can stick up the euroPics.  urlLink Scott  gave me some space for now and you can see what's there  urlLink already .  On Monday my cousin Ailie had her PhD graduation party. I went with my dad on Sunday to help my uncle set up one of the marquees. During the set up the weather was pretty hot, but as soon as the deed was done, back came the rain! I swear, normally one saves for a rainy day, but in Scotland, one saves for a sunny day! The party was great fun. Fun being measured by buffet quality: high; alcoholic content: we personally took ~15 bottles of champagne and then some; and attendance: plenty of people I wanted to see, including the cousin, and her boyfriend, I was supposed to visit in Spain. After stuffing myself, painfully, with booze and buffet, and having a good gab with the appropriate people, I took advantage of my sister taking the kids home to make my escape.  Previous to that, nothing special happened. In the next few days I have a few things to sort out for Japan. My arrival has been totally taken care of, and I have arranged to meet a member of staff whom will help me move in to my "apartment". Still to be arranged fully are: luggage, insurance and a look into bank accounts and phones. The night before I leave, on Monday, a few friends and I are going for my last supper. Luckily only 35% of the party are fussy eaters, so that puts the educated palates in majority. Nice.  Now fore (haha) those damn pics.

      Well, Road Trip 2k4 was good (overall). I couldn't update my blog because A)I was on the road 95% of the time; and B)some dick in Alicante nicked my phone...from my hand; C) the hotels charged laughable rates.  I arrived back yesterday afternoon, I have loads to organise in the next couple of days, but I will try to get photos (and maybe movies) up soon.  It feels like I've been disconnected for the past few days. Left to think my own thoughts - and they are scary. So now it's back to thinking ahead. My results were pretty bad, and I don't want to mess things up now. &lt;/begin_thinking_ahead&gt;

      Well, what's happened so far:  On Thursday  urlLink Iain  did me a great service by helping me finish off the remaining booze at my flat. It was really nice to have a good gab with a friend at that point. Chris Wu joined us later and we watched  urlLink The Fifth Element . Later, we dropped Iain back home and managed to find out way back to the flat (Chris drove and had not been drinking :P ). After several messages from Irene, we weren't sure what kind of favour we were doing Iain by taking him home...  Yesterday I packed some clothes and, in accordance with Weeble, some underpants (boxers) for France. Not only this, but there were several items I managed to forget, which I blame entirely on the washing machine at the flat being broken. You see, I had to take some waching to my parents place, so filled my bag with dirty washing also. Then, I arranged to meet Alan in Bishopbriggs. So, having packed almost everything I own into boxes the previous day, I left without taking my carefully arranged papers. My hair wax is also awol in the bathroom at my flat. I am dismayed...   After meeting up with Alan, I went to my parents place to stick on the washing. Then I gave my dad a call to see if he had arrived in Italy yet. I say Italy because I have no idea which area he is off to, only the business he is going to do - business being the mainstay of most of our communication. I cut the call short when I found out he was actually on  the plane waiting to take off.  My uncle David (the boats one) dropped by on his way home from the airport. He himself was just back from Milan, and was surprised to learn the reason that my dad wasn't home. I always enjoy it when he returns home. He, Alan and I had a chat about his travels, and a wee dram, while my aunt came to pick him up. He's heading of to Venice at the beggining  of July, a few days after I should be away to Japan. He told me about the boat he was on - a 56m ketch, one of the owner's 3 boats and 4 aircraft. I can't remember which type of rig was on it.  There was a funny story about the owner going ashore for an aperitif, and returning with a $170,000 painting. A lot of money you may think, but consider the  local crowd involved when I tell you that Microsoft's new boat Octopus was there (something was said about Bill Alan, but what I can't remember). Also, my cousin Ailie's graduation, that is PhD, and possibly engagement, party is the week after next.  Once my aunt arrived, Alan went home to get ready for another party, and I got a lift to my flat to collect said missing items. After sorting the new broadband connection at my sister's house, closer to home, my mum and I headed back home. I stayed the night and my mum went to the chippy. Mmmm it's been so long since I had a Franks pizza from Lomond  Drive!  So, I had started this post at home over tea and toast waiting for my ride. That was cut short and now I'm near Birmingham, posting at 75mph.  See you in Paris.

      I will thank you to be a little more politically correct (it makes up for my complete such lack thereof). My condition is known as  Specific Hormonally-based Interest Termination  Disorder (or SHIT Disorder for short), NOT obsession, and I have the medical certificate to prove it. So I will thank you to get your facts right... ;)

      "AutoRoute pwns your travels in the face...sideways"&trade;. THAT should be Microsoft's slogan for AutoRoute. Because it's true. It's pretty cheap too.  A short while ago I called my uncle to go over the travel plan for France/Spain. He said he wanted to avoid traveling through Paris. So, I had a little play with AutoRoute, sticking in waypoints for our trip. Click. Click. Two seconds later? Nice! Detailed instructions of the whole journey. Print it out you say? Great idea! (no laptop atm). Email it to my uncle you say!? Bravo!  So that went well. What didn't go well was calling the Japanese consulate in Edinburgh. Had I actually reached them first time, that would have been ok. You're thinking that calling the Italian consulate by mistake is hard to believe. Well believe it, you! I'm usually good at remembering phone numbers in my head, but when they are on a big list and I'm half asleep, things get a little confused. So I said my apologies and hung up. Then I made the correct call. What I learned was that 1)the internet is a great place to download application forms; 2)the Japanese love their paperwork (actually I knew this already, it just disturbs me everytime I have an official form); and 3)it will take FIVE DAYS to process my CE (certificate of eligibility) into a visa. I am displeased.  Displeased, I am, because I will no longer make the Friday 25th flight. So I have to get it changed to a later date. This means no free time in Tokyo. Which means no fancy hotel. Which means no dinner with pen pal for a while. Which is upsetting. Deeply so. However, now I can spend new year in Japan, to which I am really looking forward. I've been away from home for most birthdays since I was 17 (and repeatedly forgotten them - no really!), but never Christmas nor new year. I guess I can really appreciate them by not being at home with family...or live it up. The latter being the real plan btw.  The details of my accommodation are finalised. I will be staying in Zama city, Kanagawa. Rent is monthly at 5,400 + 9000 = 14,400 JPY =~ 72 GBP. That's more than I was told. Also, the room is unfurnished, which I was told. So I can get a "futon set" from the company for the duration, or for the first week then get my own. To rent for a week is 2000 JPY =~ 10 GBP. Insurance isn't provided by the company either, but it's not too bad.  urlLink STA Travel  do quite a good deal for students. 6 months standard cover is £156. Less than half my contents insurance with Endsleigh.  All in all, that's ok with me. The bit that's got me miffed is the commute. 1 HOUR! An hour! 60 minutes! 3600 seconds! 3600 of them! Originally I was told that I'd be within walking distance. I.e. get up at 8.20 and hoof it smart style to the lab. Now I have to get up at about 7. 7! I haven't had to get up at 7 for a long time, and it shows!The saving grace is that the bust stop is right beside the women's college. So there should be talent on the bus in the morning. Nice.  As for the flight, I have emailed the person responsible at the lab to get my air fare refunded. If I do, that's £830 for me to...um..."invest". New laptop sounds good.  Right, cuppa time.

      Right, so now I have to plan the trip from Glasgow to Alicante in Spain, via somewhere interesting along the way in France...by car. Not only that, but I finally received notice that my CE (Certificate of Eligibility) has arrived at NTT! Moreover, the documents I sent on Friday afternoon by Royal Mail Recorded Air Mail arrived on Monday at NTT! What a strange day this is.  Tony is on his way right now to discuss moving into my room, as it looks like I will have to move my stuff out a bit earlier. I still have to plan the trip. I still have to finalise the visa card. I still have to finalise travel insurance. I still have to confirm whether I can take my original Friday flight with the visa. And I had to turn down a golf game on Thursday!  The Spain trip is really cutting into my available time right now, but I don't mind at all. It's going to be fun, and I can get some cool gifts for my Japanese friend along the way. Last night I spoke to my uncle about the possibility of staying a few days in Alicante, with my brothers friend and his wife who now live in Spain. He need to travel to Algeria on Tuesday, so I would have gotten a train to my bro's mates place. But unfortunately that's not going to happen now, so I'll need to catch a flight back ASAP. So much to do and so little time. Better get to it I suppose...

      Enough already! So I've had about a week off. A week in which to do not very much at all. Summer has finally arrived, and I can drink and chill out all day properly. It was nice to do so little, but after a week, I've had enough of slacking! No, really. Now I'm getting the "ok, I really do have nothing important to do...damn I'm bored" feeling. The feeling that the last year (i.e. uni year) is over has washed over me. Now it's time to get stuck into something new. I'm ready to get back to it (including blogging)! C'mon!  For the past two days, thankfully, I have actually been busy. There was a bunch of stuff to sort for my dad's company, and a few things to do for the Japan trip. I've also got to think about a small business opportunity which was brought up regarding Japan. It makes me feel so much more alive when I have a task list, deadlines and goals. Slacking off is only worthwhile when you have something to slack off from.  However, over the weekend, I did get completely wasted, which was good. At one party I finally met my good friend's Norwegian girlfriend who went to Glasgow Uni too. He had wanted us to meet for a while, so that we could have a chat as we do quite similar courses. He told me to "be nice", but I have yet to hear any feedback :) He and I made it on to the roof for a nice view of the city at night. For once I could gaze out at the night cityscape and realise, not that I was in the library and had to get back to work in a few minutes, but that I had a chilled beer in my hand and a good mate to talk to. That's when I realized summer was truly here.   Kieran, one of my flatmates, once had to carry an office chair (unassembled) from PC world to our flat in the summer sun. At the time I laughed, but I bought a new laser printer for my dad at the place next door to it. So I had to hoof it back carry the thing. I now know his pain. What's worse, is that it not only came with a free USB pen (which is nice) but also a free 5-ream box of paper. Now, had my mate Andy, from Japanese class, been in a non-extremely-hungover state, he may have been more up to the task. Sadly, he had to cart the paper anyway. It's just as well then, that we went for lunch at Waxy O'Conners beforehand. Good energy in those Muscle Crocks and Guinness Sausages.  On Saturday I received my living manual and city maps from NTT. That manual is pretty damn useful, and the maps are good too. I'm not sure which apartment building I'll be in, so I emailed to find out. What's more, I found out more information about "Shoin Women's College" which, funnily enough, happens to be right across the road, next to the local bus stop. Nice. It seems that there are not only tennis courts (so I won't miss Wimbledon so much), but also a golf practice range. Now all I need to do is devise a plan for sliming my way in. Tricky.   Saturday was also the night of the grad ball. I knew I wasn't going to go as I'm saving for Japan, but had completely forgotten. It must have been a good night though. Dinner then a Ceilidh, fun to be had in a kilt. Many people said that it would also be a sad occasion, as they would never see some of the people from the course again. Personally I believe that if you rally wanted to stay in contact, you would be in frequent contact already. There has been, however, an ESE students forum set up by Ross from ESE. This will be good as most of the ESEs are going abroad, for industrial placements and other work, and can report about their experience (c.f. this blog). Ross asked me to link my blog, and the others will do the same, but I still like his travel forum there.  Professor Cooper remarked that he likes to see all the MEng (that includes some ESE) students going out to travel all round the world to work and represent the Uni, then come back and report on their experience. That's part of what made me choose the European MEng, which requires that you go abroad. I am now really looking forward to reading about everyone's experiences and seeing photos. (Incidentally, the department server got gubbed at the weekend. So most of the pictures will not show as the are on my filespace there).  Yesterday I found out that I'm off to Spain at the weekend with my uncle and cousin. He is heading a project in Algeria (he usually works abroad) and has some holiday time coming up. So his family will be meeting him in Spain when he's free. For now he is delivering the car to Spain for my Aunt to have, that way she can just fly down with the kids. Originally my dad was supposed to go, but he has to go to Italy on business with a client. It's to do with a big project he's about to start here. Therefore, I get his seat. If I'm forced to slack off, I might as well do it somewhere else - a few days on the road will be fun. Also, I found out that my other uncle is on the boat owned by the man who own the Italian Parma Ham company. Wonder if that entitles me to free merchandise...mmmm...ham...  Today I sorted out a new visa card, travel/medical insurance application, ISIC application, international roaming for my phone, and some more detail about transferring/suspending my phone contract when in Japan, info about flying back from Spain, some special items I want to take to Japan as Omiyage (gifts), and got a couple of books at Borders. Afterwards, Chris (flatmate), Sven, Ross and I went to the golf range for a little practice. Had a bit of a breakthrough with my swing, but lost it at the end. Not too bad for half a days work.  Now it's some games and then bed.

      ...the exact amount which I have to do now that the exams are over.  awwww yeeeeah... \o/     \o/   _o_ _o/ \o_ _o_ \o/  ok, enough crazy stick dancing. It's only just sinking in now that the exams are finally over. Never before, in all the ten exam diets and 38 exams have I ever felt so relieved!  Normally during exam diets, I get a strange stressed-out high. I actually feel pretty good about working harder, sleeping/eating less. Going day after day takes it out of you, but you know it's effort well spent. I like the feeling of self discipline.  This year was a very different story. No matter how much I tried, I just couldn't get into the spirit. I couldn't get up as early as usual, concentrate nearly enough (though, this may have to do with this years talent levels in the library), terrible diet and generally complete lack of motivation.  This years main diet was  just horrible. I just couldn't get with the flow. For weeks I was living hour-by-hour. You get like that, watching the clock constantly, praying for more time. More time to study. You're exam isn't tomorrow, it's 16 hours away. Today isn't Tuesday, it's 49 hours until your next exam. Saturday you say? Weekend? No, you've lost me there...  I've felt like this before, but those were particularly hard times - but at least I always get something at the end. And this time it's Japan again.  So now...nothing to do til then. Well, ok a few things to organise and wait for my visa, but altogether not too much. For the time being, my schedule is fuck-all point zero. Today, I watched half of the first series of 24. It was like a 12-hour movie! I know it's pretty old, but I never got to see that much of it. Even now, I never watch TV. We have all three series in the flat, so I decided to start from the beginning.  Originally it was my intention to go and see the new Harry Potter film, but recovering from complete exhaustion, especially after a long night out, demanded a day on the couch. What a night it was. From Jim's bar at the QM, to lying on the grass at a BBQ, to a mate's BDay and beyond. How I stayed awake til 3 I have no idea! From getting up at 5am for the exam, I almost did my own 24!  It was a bitter sweet feeling chatting last night. Apart from a handful of we masters students, everyone is buggering off. Most are going to London or Glasgow I think. Some are traveling, some don't have anything lined up. At the pubs etc, most were discussing their options for the next 12-18 months. Me being me, I have an exact plan already. So while there have been cigars and heavy drinking all-round, I'm still concentrating on the next 12 months of academia.  A lot of people have joked that their life now lacks meaning. No assessments, no projects, no exams - they don't know what to do with themselves. It's only a joke, with the tiniest bit of truth, but I hope I'm not at all like that next year. I like to plan ahead, and see what's coming.  But for now, all I'm going to see is the ceiling, as I lie my lazy arse in bed. The problem with fatigue, is that it really takes it out of you.  zZzZzZz....

      Consciousness should only run TO 5.30 am, never from. Getting up that early should be a crime. Illegal, as it were.  There were many illegal things in my law exam this morning, and quite expectedly so. Now I am shattered. Starbucks to the rescue!    The exam wasn't too bad, but I never want to hear anyone complaining about the length of an engineering or computing exam question ever again! 2 x pages of text = 1 x question! Cute lecturer's presence was barely appreciated due to the ammount of writing required :(  Tomorrow is likely to be somewhat harder - Information Retrieval. Ever wondered how Google works? So do I. But I have less than 24 hours to learn it, and a great deal besides that!  But still,  stultum est timere quod vitare non potes .

      I want my five seconds in the Crystal Dome! The student photocopier (first floor) at Lilybank Gardens  almost  defeated me! The games is: You swipe your card; you get a minute to figure out how the hell the menu is organised; figure out how to get what you want; after that minute, your account is automatically closed, and the menu resets - therefore locking you in the room (corridor)! ... Mumsy!  And all I wanted was a reduced size copy of my law notes. I'll apply those  well-earned  five seconds after the glorious comeback of the greatest show ever.  Speaking of greatest things ever, I have discovered the greatest invention by the mind of man, of all time:   I urge everyone to drop what they are doing (unless nuts kill you) and go eat one now. It will change your life, and the whole of society (but in a good way, even though it's American).  Alan, everyone's favourite picture of sobriety, called today. Party on Friday, after the exams-are-over binge, before the finally-I-have-a-day-off binge. Nice. But he's scarpering off to Dublin with his &lt;female acquaintance&gt;. Alright for some. Moreover, he's trying to weasel out of my "Good Luck Happy Family Super Mega Enlisted Visiting Compatriot Drinking Buddy Giga Laser Mega Ray Final Zero List" for Japan. *Shakes fist* The list is to be set in stone...and some kind of nasty ancient curse cast on it...yeah, that'll do.  So the Americans have created the greatest thing ever...I'm sure there was a Scot involved somewhere.

      ...ok that's not true. But you see, my contract law lecturer, she is very cute. What that has to do with anything, you'll never prove in court. So there.  The "Elements of Law for Engineers" exam is tomorrow. Once again, I'm slacking off at the PCs on level 4 (in the library). The exam is now less than 24 hours away. If only I could go Jack Bauer on my study, there'd be nothing to worry about.   People keep saying that "it's only a level 1 (first year) exam", "it'll be easy". Apparently us "mighty" fourth year students have little to fear from such trivial attempts at examination.  urlLink Pish  (so satisfying to see that there).  On Tuesday morning I received a message from a contact at NTT, saying that my "Certificate of Eligibility" was to be applied for, at immigration, later in the day. No further news yet, but I didn't really expect any. However, I was expecting my NTT supervisor to get in contact with me. We spoke a few weeks ago, and since then he's been in  &lt;insert random country here&gt;  on research matters. Come June 1 he was supposed to get back in touch. It's not particularly important at this stage, so I think I'll wait until Monday (read post exams and post hangover) before sending an e-mail.  Now, do you like remixes? Do ya luv tae hear some guys choon ript aff? Do you like it when someone messes with you favourite lyrics, and puts them to a different rhythm!? Well then, you just may like the following movie quotes link:  urlLink Hollywood vs Scotland   Back to it...

      ...and I'm in the office right now. I can't even begin to explain how exhausted I am. I haven't slept properly since I got here, and not for a week before I left. Plus I have been drinking quite a bit. Including last night, when I went to Shinjuku, in Tokyo, to meet some friends for a birthday drink. Shinjuku is about an hour away. For the people back home, it's like going to Edinburgh for a night's drinking and arriving back at about 2am. Man, do become jet lagged, exhausted, hungry then allow your friends to buy you inordinately strong long island iced teas - especially when they are bigger than a pint. Right now, I just want to sleep for a week...preferably with a nice "pillow" :P  My internet access here is very limited. FTP is also blocked in the office, and so is outlook, including web access. This makes it difficult to get uni email. In fact I don't even have a mobile yet. I can get a contract one in about a week or so when my registration card arrives at city hall.  I've calmed down a bit since I got here and started to settle in. I wanted to post really badly, but there are no internet cafes around and I have been pretty busy in work getting up to speed. So here is what I can currently remember about the past week:   Day 1 (7/7/04 - Monday)  An interesting trip over. Arrived early at Glasgow airport with my dad. We had coffee and cake for a while, then (wee fax just arrived for me) I boarded the 13.30 flight to London. The flight was fine and we arrived a few minute early. Then the trouble started. I had to go to my connecting flight, so looked at the connections board, misread the terminal, and went to the wrong one! Anyone who has gone between terminals there know that the bus take about 5-10 minutes. I had just under an hour to make the connection and had to go through security again (cause I went out of the terminal). So I ran the last couple of hundred meters and made it, just. Then went up the wrong ramp, but finally made in onto the plane. Now, having just ran, and not being able to do so very well, I had to sit sweating on the plane. Now, this would have been fine in the air conditioning was working properly. But we were delayed and the engines were not started. So we had to cook in the plane for about 20 minutes before we left. I was unimpressed at the recent events.   During the flight I mostly watched TV and read through my arrival instructions. My TV was a bit screwed and would occasionally serenade me with loud static. Nice. Didn't get much sleep, but I did manage an hour or two. The flight took about 11 hours I think, and the flight to London was about one and a half. I arrived in Narita airport (outside Tokyo) at roughly 11.30am local time.  There was more trouble to come (damn I'm hungry right now, I wish I had brought my birthday cookies in). I had brought about (fuck, no pound sign on this keyboard!) £285 in cash with me. I had intended to exchange it in Glasgow, but there was no Yen available. And, giving my antics in Heathrow, there was no time. However, worried I was not! "I'll exchange it at Narita" I thought. Thought wrong did I! The problem is that they do not accept Scottish bank notes. I could have expected this, but I completely forgot I had Scottish notes.   Needing to call NTT and being strapped for cash, I remembered I had a phone card from my last visit. This was a real break :) I called the secretary at planning section in NTT to let her know my situation. I managed to get about £20 from my visa card at an ATM in Narita. The bus ticket to Atsugi is about £15. I had to go there and meet a member of staff, who then took me to my dormitory (mmm just had dinner, a so far very pleasant experience in work - explain later, not what you think :P). We had a chat in the car about various things, nothing comes to mind at the moment. Several key landmarks were pointed out to me, like the Sagamihara river. The drive was around 25 minutes.  After arriving at my dormitory and being shown to my room, we discovered that it was covered in damp! So I was given a separate room temporarily. The room is Japanese style, with a entrance area where you take your shoes off and a lot of storage. The room has only air conditioning, air cleaner, desk and a chair. It's comfortable large, but in real terms the minimalism makes it look so. I hired a futon set until Sunday. The futon set is a foldable mattress, pillow and sheets. After moving the futon in, I was give £150 by the member of staff to survive on until I could arrange money. It was only today that I found out the money was from his own pocket! I had believed it was an advance from the company. I was incredibly grateful. However, people seem to offer loans on short term too easily. Personally I hate borrowing money from someone unless I can give it back to them at an ATM later in the day or so.  I was shown around the rest of the dorm. There are two buildings, a dining hall and communal Japanese bath. This style of bath is where you shower first at a tap and shower-head, then soak in the bath for a while. There's something about bathing with a bunch of naked strangers.  Afterwards, I unpacked my stuff and got cleaned up. Later I had dinner and went to sleep at 9 or 10. I had no energy to go exploring, and the staff member would drive me to work in the morning as his apartment is nearby.   Day 2 (8/7/04 - Tuesday)  I got up at roughly 5am - I couldn't sleep as usual. After getting washed I donned a shirt and tie, grabbed my bag and waited what felt like an eternity until the staff member arrived - he was prompt.   -  -  -  Right, I have to go catch my bus to the train station now. I will fill out more tomorrow if I can. Some things I should explain: 1- My camera was not charged when I got here and I only got a cable, from the endless supply of equipment in the labs, on Friday. Therefore I have only a few photos.  2- FTP access is blocked, so I will need o find other means to upload this picture.  3- I'm nackered and in a hurry. If the above doesn't make sense...ah well.  Fin.

      So it's come to this... My flight leaves in a little over 12 hours. I haven't packed. No currency. Half pissed (that's drunk for you American types). Still got some important stuff to buy. To full to sleep properly. Nice.  It was about 20 mins ago that I got back from dinner. Some good friends did me the pleasure of meeting for dinner and drinks. I miss you bastids. :( Get your arses over to Japan, I need some home team support! I didn't imagine it would be upsetting to say goodbye (for now) to those guys, but it was. But it's only six months! :)  Chris just found out today that his mum booked his tickets to Hong Kong! He is planning to come over to Japan (Tokyo) with his mum for a few days. I'm really looking forward to it. Andy-san is arranging soon to come over at new year. Originally he had considered doing JLPT3 in Tokyo, but decided he can get more time off near Christmas/new year, which is good :D Karaoke was discussed, so now I'm in full avoid-karaoke-contingency-generation-mode. As for the rest of them, we'll see.  During today I had so many bursts of excitement. Expedia's Mediterranean style guitar tune became stuck in my head, and got me in the "jumping around holiday mood". However, it's only very slightly a holiday. There's serious work to be done outside the perceived "recreational" activities. That is what has me the most nervous. I'll be taking some notes and trying to get a hold of my supervisor's text book (another thing I should have done before now - but hey, I bought my suitcase only today! :D ).  Now I'm gonna hit the hay, and pack my stuff in the morning. After the flights from GLA-&gt;LHR and LHR-&gt;NRT, I have to work my way to Atsugi. Once there, I will meet a member of NTT staff at the facility, whom will drive me to my accommodation. The plan is the bus, which I think will be a bit less hassle in my will-be tired state.  So it's next stop Japan! That is, after London :P To keep you amused in the mean time, feel free to have a perv at some pics I uploaded. These include some from my last trip to Japan. Go  urlLink here.  The euroPics folder is incomplete atm. I'll sort that out in Japan. Those are the pics from Road Trip 2k4.  Ciao.
