      Well today went really well at work...we are in Columbus, OH and are doing everything at an alarming rate...I am traveling with D and BR this week, so it should be interesting...I gave BR and D a while to catch up, I have been traveling with D for a while, so we are pretty in sync doing sets...I managed to finish a book on my drive, and start another...whoo, hoo...there is something to be said for taking the back seat on an 11 hour drive and keeping your nose in a good book...Well, I may have given BR the wrong idea, I wanted to spend the night in his room, because we haven't really hung out in a while and I see D all the time...I am trying to not get annoyed with D...hanging out too much, is eventually going to put us at each others throats...Well it hasn't happened yet, and we've been traveling every weekday for about a month and a half, but I know that I can be a real handful sometimes...futher updates in the future, I'm sure...Nothing else really to report...I would like to go to this gaybar in Columbus this waiter told us about while hitting on BR...lol...it is always the most comic thing in the world to see BR getting hit on, he just doesn't know what to do with himself...Talk to you later

      Okay, so I am really not into writing porn or having it on my blog...But this is my personal journal, so I get to do whatever I want!  And this dream was absolutely spectacular...Do you ever wake up after a dream and wonder why you just had a dream about someone that you haven't ever met but are already in love with...I had the strangest dream last night...I woke up, and actually ached for the boy my dream...I have never seen him before, never seen him in passing he wasn't my type...He was younger than I normally like, around 18 to 20...Blonde very athletic, but thin blonde eyes, about 5'8" to 5'9" angular jaw line, but soft features short hair, smooth, and just beautiful...I remember talking to him, it was his first time?  We didn't have sex, but messed around, it makes me aroused just to think about it...I can just visualize everything that happened...It was warm outside, there were palm trees just on the other side of the blue tile of the pool ferns gathered underneath the trees, leaving no visible ground just lush undergrowth...We were in the pool, treading water...Then he gave me a look that I recognized as one that we had shared for years...We both submerged, going deeper and deeper into the tepid water...I reached for him as he reached for me, both of us stripping our bathing suits off, reaching for one another embracing, touching, grabbing...I can still feel the taste of him on my lips, our tongues locking, and searching...Turning him around so that his back is to my chest grabbing his cock, and stroking it our feet skimming the bottom of the pool...Feeling the thrust of his dick in my hand, plunging deeper and deeper into my fist...Cupping one cheek of his ass in my other hand as I reach for his asshole...Feeling his pulse quicken in my hand, as I plunge one of my fingers into his warm tight hole and feeling him orgasm, his come rising to the surface and just being content with knowing that he is there

      Well the qi gong class on sat went really well...I had a lot of fun, even though it was a little difficult--I mean holding one position for 5 minutes then changing your arm positions...Ugh, it really did a number on my quads...I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes to stretch their bodies, or relax...Rest of the day went really well...

      Well, I didn't do as bad as I thought that I would...I went and saw the Notebook today, which was really great...I prophecised(sp?) 6 months ago when I saw the preview that it would not be a good idea to see in the theatre...what with the bawling and huhhhh, hhuuuu, ghhahhhh's...however, the movie was really great...so funny the humor was making me cry...then the end...lovely...AHHHH, to be in love even at 70, looks soooo good...Ok, enough homo...Well work today went really well, we did in 3 hours what normally takes 5, great for us...N, one of my co-workers that I have know for about 5 years, and I uncovered that we're a-okay with the bickering children roles that we adopt when we're together...I just have to be more nice...ok BR you win...so, that's my day in a nutshell...Oh yeah, I saw the movie with my roommate, which was really good, we haven't been getting along very well for the last few months...it's amazing what a tear-jerker and some OTB (on the border) will do for the soul...Tomorrow I have a Qi Gong class at 9 am...I have been looking forward to taking this class for about 3 weeks...we'll see how it goes...Later

      So, today started out much like every other...I woke up after hitting the snooze for about 20 min...crawl out of bed, get ready...D shows up and we travel to Sedalia, MO...yet another exciting city to visit on my whirlwind tour of broke, no-where cities of the midwest...However, today was special...after completing one set, I found out that we didn't have to do the one I didn't want to!!!  Yeah, justice rears its gorgeous head in my favor...I gave the manager my card, and told her to call when she had space!  So, hopefully she'll have the space and we can go in soon, but I am very glad she didn't have it today.  Oh, one let down...I was planning to go to a qi gong class today...there wasn't one, good thing I didn't drive 35 min to the class just to find out there wasn't one...I will be going at 9 am on sat...ugh...all to get bended into positions that noone in their right mind wants to be pretzelized into... "pretzelized" hmm good word.  Oh, I hate La Quinta...nuff said...maybe I'll call a KC radio station and record my FU...hmmm, no I'm not mad enough for bad publicity...I'm still a little nice...So, about college decided that I'll apply for deepsprings, and go to Univ of Pheonix online until I either get accepted to deep, or grad from Pheonix...1 question down...millions to go...

      So, I am currently looking at going back to school...Right now I am a service and marketing rep... Which is actually a really good job, and I am really surprised at just how good I do have it; even though it may not feel that way sometimes.  So, I am really trying to figure out what to do...I am really interested in going to www.deepsprings.edu which my boss actually pointed me to...but I am not sure how great of an idea it is to go to a school targeted at 18-20 yr old guys, and I will be 24 next september...hmmm...a gay man in an all boys school of 18 year olds...sounds great...hmmm...I'll keep considering...So, I also could just go to an online college, continue to work, and get my bachelors...I'm telling you questions, questions...  On the home front...I was in good ol Parsons, KS today for work...not exactly a mecca of activity!  But the set went well, and we drove back to KC...Hopefully, this weeks festivities of work will progress in the same manner...We'll see...Later

      In the beginning...there was a boy...a man really...of 23...who decided to put thoughts to paper...or, computer...and he called himself Chris... Chris was a rather average fellow...worked the daily grind...slept intermittenly with boys of his age and older...liked the way his life looked...then one day, average Chris began to think...uh ohhhhhh...now his life is tuned and tossed with question after question...what is my life for?  What will I do?  Can I be just another Chris in the crowd?  Is that what I really want...stay tuned for more updates on the life of this notorious Chris...

      Well, I still have not really recuperated from my little run in with the bad ear fairies...ugh...So, I have only been at work this week a total of 1 out of 4 days, that is so unbelievably unlike me that I am going CRAZY.  I am so stir crazy!  I went in for about 5 hours to one of the stores today, and was breaking out in hot and cold sweats; but, I did find out why I am having trouble sleeping.  I am having growing pains.  I thought that I was just sore from work, but yesterday I could see into one of the cabinets in my house standing on my tipy-toes when normally I would have to jump!  One day I may be 5'10" just like Cindy Crawford, Yeah, LOL.  Oh, amazing thing today, I was watching the news...and no that's not the amazing thing...and I saw GAY PROSTITUTION IN KANSAS CITY PARKS...I about died, so of course HAD to watch...it was the greatest thing I have ever seen!  Homos from all over, getting arrested and arguing with the cops...It was Queer Eye for Cops...I was dying!!  And the guy that was driving the Gold Mustang that they kept showing driving around the "Fruit-Loop" pure unadultrated comedy!  I swear!  However, I did not know about Swope Parks lively lunch time adventures...hmmmm...lol...yeah right!  So, tomorrow, off to work...I will work an entire day, I promise!  Wish me luck!

      So, we'll start with the weekend...it started out with me in the maryville store...ugh...8 hours in a store without air conditioning...i think it was about 80 degrees out and 110 in the store...fast forward to me chatting with my friend greg...I decide i'm going up to his aunts house, to hang out, but first i'll take a little nap-then call and go over...Fast forward to 4 in the morning...oops...slept through the alarm...ugh, I'm a deep sleeper!  Wake up at 10...that's 15 hours of sleep, something must be wrong with me, and I'm REALLY dizzy--Maybe I have an ear infection...I call the Doc's office, and schedual an appt...Start feeling better around noon...Go and pick up my bonus check...drama ensues!   I am not upset about my check...it's great, a bonus, nothing to complain about...but I am upset about the fact that N. one of my co-workers got the same Bonus, ugh...So, background:  I work harder, better and longer...Sounds like some really cheap bad porn...HARDER BETTER and LONGER...coming soon!! Anyway...So, I don't want to be seen as ungrateful, but really...I get paid the same salary, and work more and harder, it makes me frustrated...BTW Brian...Ungrateful is the word I was looking for... Fast forword to GAY POKER...occasionally, a few of us guys get together, and play an evenings worth of Poker...and just have an absolute blast...they get drunk, which means i do better, and we all have a really good time...This week there was a guy there, named Nathan...hmmmm....Well, nathan is really cute--has a boyfriend---which is there---hmmmm....I'm not really much for being a guy on the sidelines...so, I do all the nice guy things that you're supposed to do when someone elses boyfriend is hitting on you...don't draw attention to is and pretend it's all in good fun...UNTIL HE BITES YOU...I do draw the line at scarring and bruises...ok, no scarring, but really!  I have bite marks and a bruise on my leg, and didn't get any of the fun!  LOL...So, I did pretty well...won a few hands that I was proud of, beat Brian!!  YEAH!!  How the mighty fall!  So, that was really about it...Until my drive home, I get a call from Greg, and he is having dramam with his best-friend/wanna-be boyfriend, Chris, the only problem is Chris "the Guy" already has a boyfriend, so they can't be together...but both want to be...Ugh...how silly...Don't say a goddamn thing BR...So, I listen to Greg for about 2 hours, then hit the sack...Wake up...piddle around the house, then hit Dan's for QAF...Queer as Folk...fun...then go home... On Monday, I get even more sick, and leave work early, get my doctors appointment and pass out...Today, I find out I have an ear infection...big surprise!  I still have really big problems with vertigo...and standing is always a really fun and exciting adventure...So, hopefully tomorrow I'll feel better, and get to go to work...I am sooo stir crazy!  So, wish me luck!

      So...While I was driving back to good o' KC, I called my good friend and boss Brian...So Brian precedes to tell me what I said to him in my sleep...Just to give you a background, I do in fact talk in my sleep...and it's not uncommon for me to talk directly to the person in the adjacent bed...So, he procedes to tell me that not only did I just chat with him...I made him a list of reasons that I am not attracted to him...Fortunately, I did not have to hear all that I said, but he did tell me that it was quite a litany...Brian isn't mad...he said they are all things that he already knew, I am relieved about that, but unbelievably pissed about the fact that I could have done that...UGH!!  I swear that I'll never sleep in the same room as anyone that I have somthing left unsaid with!!  How creepy! I am just so freaked that I could have done that...as you can see still freaked...Brian said it was because I needed to say it, and just couldn't normally...Maybe that's true, but I would just like to be around when I'm chatting it up with someone...Comments, anyone?

      So, we'll start with the weekend...As you know I was supposed to go camping...Well, D and I got all our groceries for the trip...drove down to NoelPM, MO about 5 min. from the Arkansas border...and we're with our friends Rick and Chris...well it is absolutely pouring down rain!  So we get the tents up and are so soaked I can barely walk in my jeans...Then Jeremy and Ryan arrive, so me and D help them get their tent up, so we figure we're doing really well...We drink a few beers, and decide that now it's time for dinner...it's 10:30...PM...I'm STARVED...So we start the shish-kabobs, and it starts really coming down...cold and amazingly hard...Me and Jeremy are holding up an umbrella trying to cover the kabobs and meanwhile I have rain going right down the crack of my...well, you know...So, we finally get to eat around 12 and oh my god, Rick Rocks! The kabobs were amazing...After eating we all go to our respective tents...Jeremy and Ryan in me and D's, because while we were holding the umbrella, their tents went kaboom...so we all get ready for bed, and I slept like a baby, until 3:30...Then, I got a wakeup call that went about like, "You might want to move your tent, the water's getting high"  So I roll over to D and say, "Yeah, well I might want to paint my toenails pink, but that doesn't mean I am going to do it."  And roll over...HMMM, surprise surprise, Chris Hahn, being bitchy!!  Well, really!!  I am not much of a morning person...So, after he came back and said the water was about 10 ft from our tents, we got up...moved them and 5 minutes after we got the campsite moved, we were told they were evacuating!  So, we packed all we could, because they said we had 5 min to get out of there, and left the tens, food, coolers, etc. And drove our gay asses back to KC...I got home at 8:30 AM and went to sleep...ode to Camping!

      Well we're back in KC now, no more work for the rest of the week!  Columbus went really well...Now I just need to get ready for our canoeing (sp?) trip this weekend...I haven't been camping since I was a kid, it should be really fun!  I haven't ever been in a canoe, much less in a canoe drunk with 5 other fags going down some river in MO...Monday nights post should be very funny...HMMM...Well not much else really going on...I am no longer mad at La Quinta...They caused me to bounce a couple of checks...But they are paying for the damages to my bank account, I say that makes it okay...UHM....Shopping today went well...I was looking for a CD and ran into a gay bar in Express for Men...It was really frightening...I live in the burbs on the east side of KC, and I really did walk right into the Dixie Bell...I knew 5 guys in there, and none of them worked there...The fags really are taking over...LOL...Well that's it...I think that I am going to meet D out for a drink, and maybe kiss a boy I don't know...Just to clear the air...I haven't had a romp since Nov., so regardless of the fact that I may think in porn terms from time to time, I unfortunately don't get to live the porn life...Booo Hooo...Chat soon....Over and out
