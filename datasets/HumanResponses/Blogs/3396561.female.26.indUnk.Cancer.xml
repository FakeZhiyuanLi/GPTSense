      I love my husband, I really do, but I just get so frustrated sometimes!  I'm sure he does with me, too, but this is my blog, not his.  So, hubby's been out of work for about 4 months now.  He works IT and in our town, to get placed in IT, you pretty much have to go through an independent consulting company.  They've not had anything that even comes close to his salary needs so far.  I realize this is a tough thing to be going through for him, but I just feel sometimes like he's not trying hard enough.  I'll call him at home while I'm at work and he's on the couch watching tv.  Or, like today, I called him at 4:30 and he'd just gotten up to take a shower, because he had slept all day!  What really gets me is that we've had discussions before where if one of us made enough money so that the other could stay home, the person who stayed home would do all the house stuff.  Dishwasher, laundry, general cleaning, etc.  Well, he's done nothing, except laundry, this whole time unless I scream at him and start an argument, then there's about a 20% chance he MIGHT do it the next day.  His argument is that I don't make enough money for him to stay home, so the previous discussion doesn't apply.  Well, whether we can afford to live on one salary or not, we are, and he's home all day, so I feel he should be doing more, like just about all, of the work around the house.    Maybe I'm off base here, and I've been trying really hard not to start arguments at home over this, but I just need to rant about it somewhere!!

      It really gets me when people get a virus with your email address as the sender and start accusing you of sending them viruses.  This isn't me, but someone on one of my group lists.  Someone they don't know got a virus sent to them with the other person's email address as the "from".  The person who received it sent a threatening message back to the "sender".  Don't people realize that just because email address "X" is listed as from, that that person didn't necessarily send it, nor is that person necessarily infected with a virus.  I get a ton of viruses at my webmaster account, and also "failure" messages of viruses that went out with my from address to an invalid receiver.  Well, my webmaster address is on every page of my website, so it's fair game to the viruses!  Anyone else have an opinion on this?  I think it is ultimately the recipient's responsibility to make sure they DON'T open any attachments, especially .exe and .pif from someone they don't know.  Especially when there's no message, just a subject line saying "your message", "your document" or some other such nonsense.

      Hubby just asked me if I'd be amenable to a move to Wisconsin, Green Bay in particular.  Not sure how I feel about that.  He's currently looking for work, and apparently got a call today from a company in WI very interested in his resume.    I'm used to snow and cold, but I think Green Bay's colder than I'm used to.  I grew up in Buffalo, NY, and sure we got a lot of snow, but it wasn't really all that cold most of the time.  I personally think Columbus is worse, because we don't get the snow to insulate things, and it's a very dry biting cold....  I'll have to research Green Bay weather....

      By the way Gmail = very cool.  It's not so much the storage, because hubby maintains his own email server, and an Outlook web interface for accounts on his domain, so I have as much storage as I want and can check it wherever I am.  But, the conversation view has made my life so much easier.  I only have had the account for 2 days.  Did a trade on gmailswap.com (sent a custom etched beer glass to a very nice fisherman who sent me an account).  I subscribe to 3 quite active group lists, and another 3-4 not so active ones.  Often, when I check mail for any one group, there were 50 messages available.  (Before Gmail, I used 4 different accounts - excite, two yahoos - one of them from my DSL service, and my own domain; for my group mail - so I had to check each one).  Usually about 1/2 of the messages would be about the same thread, but mixed in with messages about something else.    On the conversation view, all the messages in that thread that are in your inbox show together, so you can read right through the whole thread and archive or delete all of them at once.  This is such a timesaver!!!

      So, you know I camp, in a motorhome.  Well, said motorhome takes A LOT of gas.  We're planning a trip to upper Michigan in about a week, and hubby was going to fill up today at a local station that was at $1.89 (last summer we were only paying $1.30 - $1.50).  They were filling their tanks right then and upping to $2.13  This is NOT going to be a cheap trip.....

      I only just found out about Blogger.  So forgive me for any weird things I might do!  I am 26 years old and live in the Columbus, OH area.    When I define who I am, it is primarily in relation to my dogs.  I'm a Weim mom.  (Weimaraners are the grey dogs that are photographed in people clothes, for those who don't know).  Maybe that will change when I decide to have skin babies of my own, but for now, that's who I am.    It's great being a dog mom, you can get a warm snuggle any time you want, and when they grow up, they don't hate you for not letting them do things, like teenagers often do.  Sure, dogs have their challenging moments, but they get over it reeeeal quick, just pull out a biscuit or give them a good scratch!  Most of my free time is spent at dog related activities.  Sometimes dog shows, Weimaraner club meetings, field trials, hunt tests, and even walks in the mall (Yes, in Columbus our ritzy fashion mall welcomes dogs!).  What we do the most, is camping with the dogs (often at the above mentioned events).  We have a class A motor home (the kind that look like buses, but ours isn't huge) and we take our own portable yard for the dogs (wire exercise pens, 3' high) so that they don't have to be tied up when camping.  They sleep with us in the camper, and get to go on hikes, etc.  I have really low blood pressure and feel that my stress level is pretty darn low, too, and I attribute it all to my pets (adding in the three cats here, in addition to the two Weims).  Everyone should have a pet, be it scaly, feathered or furred.
