      I could tell when someone was thinking about me. I knew when they spoke of me. My ears would burn. My head would pound. They are all watching me. But what for? Am I a threat to them? Are they a threat to me? They even speak my name. Usually when I am by myself. That way no one else can hear them in my head. It would get loud. Really loud. I could sometimes not hear others speak. The lights would flicker but only I would notice. Distractions they liked. Making my hands look different. Making people think differently of me. And the yelling... I was always being yelled at. Not by family. The teacher. She was always yelling. I would think something and she would yell at me like I said it out loud. She knows what's going on. But the pain. This spot on my head would kill. And then it would move to different parts of my head. My fingers were always numb. Then my hands. They would tingle alot. I saw it behind the pipes. The eyes. Watching me. Why can't they just leave? But where would they go? They took my emotion. I cannot feel sadness. Sometimes I dream of the future. I know this because the dreams come true. My potatos tasted funny that night. My mother - My own mother! - had put something in them taste minty. I cant remember the rest of the night. All black. I dont remember to eat. I no longer feel hunger. I have to remember to eat just to stay alive. I dont want to die you know. I will never die. They can't make me. No one else can see them. They dont let them. They want control. Thats all they want is control. But no me. No, they will never control me. Never. My mind will blow them away. But I cannot let them know this. I have to shut down. Build a wall of brick. I don't even like pudding that much. And the thoughts make no sense. They come to me at the speed of light. They don't relate to each other. I get looked at funny because of this. Nobody understands my thoughts. I can make sense out of them but no one else can. It leaves the world to suffer without my knowledge. If only they all knew what I know. Boy! What a world we could have!

      Red - His lover's hand gently strokes his cheek as he remembers the past months. The constant fear of being found out. Every look, every movement could have given his feelings away. How many nights did he spend drinking, trying to forget everything? He remembers the almost physical pain it was causing him, remembers the pain he was causing himself.   Green - A finger touches the scars on his wrist. He can recall every little detail about that one night. It had all become too much. Too much for him to bear. Too much to just go on. Too much to live with. He remembers the sweet pain the razorblade was causing when it cut through his skin, remembers the beauty of the deep red blood dripping down, staining the expensive champagne coloured carpet of his hotel room.  Blue - He feels his darling's soft lips brushing his neck. The first moments after waking up in hospital come to his mind. The sterile room, the needle in his arm, the plain white sheets... He remembers trying to shade his eyes from the blazing sunlight that the cream coloured curtains can't keep outside and feeling too weak to lift his arm.  Pink - He smiles as his lover's soft breath tickles his ear. He can almost see the look on his friends' faces when they entered the room, can see HIS look, the concern in his eyes, the love. It was then when he confessed his love, all teary-eyed and scared of being rejected. But it had to be let out.   Gold - As their mouths meet, he feels himself drift back to the present. This is where his thoughts belong. This is IT.  After a long divine kiss, their lips part and he smiles again. "I love you, Brian," he hears him whisper into his ear. "I love you, too, Steve," he replies as they watch the fireworks slowly dying down...excited about beginning their first year together.

      soon, my skin will be wrinkled..my posture would turn 'parabolic'..i would be feeble...even useless.  soon, i won't have to worry about my homeworks..i won't have to waste my time soling calculus problem or creating programs using C..i won't have to remember all the terms in botany..  soon, i will be forgetful..i will have to accept lonliness..i will have to tell everyone that i'm ready to die, even if i'm not..even if i know it will be hard..even if i know i can't leave behind the people i have been with during the ups and downs of my life.  soon.  "soon" could be tomorrow or the day after that..and still, i can't deny the fact that i'm fearful..scared to face those moments..   soon...everything will end..

      I believe that we can survive without the following things :  --> education, diplomas, medals, good grades.. --> money --> car, big house, swimming pool --> paper and pen --> math, physics, chem, p.e., computers --> cellphone, telephone, tv, radio, dvd, vcd...  In short, we can survive without any man-made thing or any man-made thought. The question is, why do we still earn them? Are we supposed to have them or do we need them? Primitive men or cavemen didn't own cellphones, cars, computers and even houses. They didn't have formal schooling. They didn't know how to write or read. They didn't need money. Yet, they survived..coz if they didn't, we wouldn't have been here.  Had it not been because of us, Life could've been much simpler. We wouldn't have to worry about getting good grades, asking for load, solving calculus problems, finishing chem experiments, buying gas, or missing our fave tv show. We would have less problems. We wouldn't have to worry about something as major a problem as finding a place to stay in or other things as minor as running out of quotes to forward to a friend. Life really would have been so much simpler and we stupidly preferred it to be harder.  It's just ironic to think that we consider ourselves as the highest forms of organisms and yet we made life so complicated and we created problems which have become unavoidable since time immemorial. That's just one of the infinite perks of human beings that I wanted to make quirks about.

      As living organisms in this vast and complex universe, we have been endowed with 5 (sometimes even 6) senses. We feel. We see. We smell. We hear. We taste. We sense. But, what really makes us human is how we make or give sense to our sometimes inexplicable existence in this cruel piece of the milky way.  The reason why I'm here remains to be a mystery for me. My purpose is something I don't think I'll ever really know or fully understand.  In my understanding, I think we're born to meet and deal with people. I mean, we're not here to get an A or to earn a college degree. I personally believe that we go somewhere or we say something because in the course of doing so, we will meet people. We go to school to gain friends and studying is just the "bonus" because when we reach our "final destination" and we come face-to-face with our Creator, I bet that he wouldn't look for our transcript of records or anything of that sort but I'm pretty sure He'd ask us about the people we've shared our lives with during our lifetime.  (I really don't know how to "concretize" my outlook on life and existence.) Another thing I'd like to point out is where we're going in our "journey " called life. When we go somewhere, it is inevitable that we will meet people who become part of us in one way or another. These people include the sidewalk vendor who caught your attention, the other jeepney passengers who passed your fare to the driver, the janitor who emptied your trashcan. "They" apparently include everyone you met, saw, smiled at, talked to or simply  those who were with you in the same place at the same time- you may have not noticed each other but you were, at least, in the same spatial location and possibly for the same reason. Anyway, have you ever wondered why they call it destination? I'm not 100% sure with my assumption but the word itself sort-of contains the word destiny. DESTINY. Maybe we really are destined to be who we have been, who we are and who we will be..and whatever we sense and what we make sense of or give sense to. If you think I'm being nonsensical, I was probably destined to be so and you're probably destined to think so.

      a star.. it twinkles and sparkles.. it somehow gives more reason to appreciate God's magnificence.. it makes you want to live in space to be closer to the "diamond up in the sky".. it brightens up the heavens at night..   just when you thought that it's one of the perfect things in the universe..  someone teaches you that they're nothing but plasma..  gases of all sorts forming a mass...  an extremely hot matter..  above all, you learn that the die..     suddenly, it seems ordinary..not as perfect and magnificent as it used to be.. it was not perfect after all..it has never been perfect..   though it used to be..some earthling made you realize that it's not..it wasn't and will never be.    how could anyone take that magic away..     life is cruel..people are more cruel..

      I was suppose to start by asking if you've heard the song entitled Rainbow by the very talented band called Southborder but I decided not to. That would be stupid 'coz every one has heard it, I assume (except of course the deaf and the people who don't have time to lisen to music). It's one of the best songs I've ever heard. It's one song that I know will go on playing for decades and even centuries. It's one of the songs that I like even more everytime I hear it. It's a song I think even angels wouldn't get tired of singing and listening to. Every single note and every single word seemed to fit so well. PERFECT. It has earned a space in almost every person's list of favorite songs. In mine, it's on top. I usually don't go with what everybody wants. That's probably one reason why green has become my fave color- coz everyone I knew just couldn't help but answer blue or light blue or baby blue or anything with blue, when asked about what their fave color was. But, I made Rainbow an exception. I couldn't deny how much I like the song because I love it so much that after I hear it, I wish I'd experience the so-called LSS forever. Southborder has really made me proud. Every filipino should be. It's nothing short of a gift that people as talented as Southborder (esp. THE Jay Oliver Durias)has made music the way it should be and more than that- truly inspiring and unexpectedly beautiful. This band is talent-in-the-flesh. They have proven the complexity of the purpose of human existence. Southborder has gone beyond my expectations of a what a band should be and their songs have exceeded my expectations of what quality music is.

      You're probably wondering- or maybe not- about the bright-green-apple thing. Actually, i chose it primarily because it was the first thought that entered my mind- yeah, i have one which works just fine- and basically, green is my fave color and bright colors are so me. About the apple, it's off-tangent.  Red shiny apples are usually preferred by most people. They're the best kinds. Majority even think that green apples are nothing compared to the shiny red ones. Make that a bright green apple and I bet people would doubt if that's even palatable.  The bright green apple is who I am. It's not that I am green minded or bright but because I perceive a bright green apple as something people wouldn't really waste their time looking for; nevertheless, once they see one...they either become one of two things:  a)someone who hates the bright green apple because it looks weird and so un-apple or b)someone who finds the bright green apple just the same as the shiny red ones.

      Despite the violent stunts and obscene aspects of wrestling, I never lose my interest in the "sport". It's the only game I'm well-acquianted with. I love watching it especially when I was still in grade school and television was much accessible. I didn't mind staying up late to watch the special coverages of its special episodes even if I know that they will be replayed a hundred times for the next month or so. There's just something in the game that I never found in other games. I was an avid fan of many wrestlers especially Dwayne Johnson who's more popularly known as The Rock, and I still am. Having learned that every match and every single fight is scripted didn't change my eagerness to watch raw or smackdown, not even a bit. I just love wrestling. Period. You might not believe me but one of my goals is to watch a live wrestling match of The Rock. In fact, I look up to most wrestlers because as always mentioned in commercials, the dangers are real and partly risking their lives for something they're passionate about and for something that will entertain lots of people is almost heroic.  This has gotten vague.

      They call it HELL WEEK and I don't really know why. They say it's when schoolwork has piled up. Others say it's the finals week. The week when you cram all the requirements. The week when you study your lessons really, really extrasuperduperhard. The week when others say you're lucky when you've had a 3-hour sleep. Well, I still have a vague idea about it.  I woke up today feeling lazy to go my 8:30 class. However, I did get out of bed 20min. after my alarm clock sounded- that is, after a couple of snoozings. Haha. While I was in the shower room, the thought about hell week entered my mind out-of-the-blue (and green!).  First, I asked myself why they call it hell week. I think I've had hell-week-like experiences in high school and although it really felt like punishments to students like me, I never really thought of it as hellish. It just wasn't. In fact, those were the times when, honestly, I prayed twice more often than usual. Nobody prays in hell, that's just so common sense.  Second, studying isn't supposed to be getting high grades. Well, partly, it is but there are times when not studying can help. In my case, I only study the night before an exam. And sometimes, I don't study even if a quiz was announced. Why? I'ts not just because I'm lazy or anything but I prefer to at least, for some moments in my student life, I preserve the essence of quizzes. Quizzes were supposed to assess a student's understanding of the topic and not a student's standing in class. They were meant to test (that's why they're called such) if student's have grasped the subject. Reviewing because I'm aware that there's an upcoming exam is like fooling myself. It's not that I don't care if I get a low grade, it's just that I wouldn't mind getting a low mark if that's what I really deserve to get. I don't exxactly know how it helped me but I believe it did.  (I know i'm getting off-tangent)  Enough of my senseless quirks. I know I'm getting nowhere.

      I should say that Spiderman2 is far better than the first. Aside from the fact that Tobey Mcguire looked much better in the 2nd part, the story wasn't crappy. Well, I'm not saying that the first was crappy. Getting back, I found the "story" of S2 with a lot of substance, a lot of meaning. It has something/s that goes/go beyond the with-great-power-comes-great-responsibility theme. Funny as it may sound, I found myself holding back my tears while I was watching the film. Every scene was just so perfectly made that for 2 hours or so, I felt that Spiderman was real. He may have these superhuman features and ablities but he is as human as we all are. He cries, he loves, he feels, he cares, he hates, he eats, he trips, he flunks like we all do. It's just that he's not that imperfect -or should I say his deeds compromises his mistakes- to be considered as one of us.

      If I were to answer a question as undeniably questionable as why I'm doing these, I'd probably give the lamest(?) you could ever get-- I don't know why. Now I assume you wouldn't want to go on.  I don't even have any idea on how to go on with this or if I should go on.  I'm just typing out my thoughts mindless of everything else.  Anyway, I'm doing this for me 'coz I bet nobody else would get interested.  I'm not reallly into stuffs like these.  N.B. : This is a product of boredom.
