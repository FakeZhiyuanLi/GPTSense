       "You know you are comfortable with someone (opposite sex) if you can drive three hours w/o speaking to each other."  I heard that two days ago at work from customer's conversation. I wonder if it is true. I was comfortable with my ex like the guy said, but we still broke up. I guess regardless how comfortable you got with someone still can't solve all the problems in the world.

       It's not that I don't like dealing with people, sometimes listening to someone's problems become a part of your own problems. I hate that.   Being honest is all good, but sometimes too honest might can cost you pain and suffering. At work I'm known for the straightest and honest person. If I have something to say to someone, I'll say it. My thing is... if it's right, it's right; if it's wrong, it's wrong. Even if my mom owns the restaurant, people still comes to me with their problems. It's not that they are seeking an easy way out between the conflicts of the boss and them, but rather I don't fall in favorite of neither side. I make my judgments based on fairness.   Sometimes take the time out to go out with co-workers are also good. You'll be surprised they are more relax off the work ground and are able to chit-chat a little more about their personal problems. Simply you can get know them more than you can at work.   Do I like my job? No, I really don't. But is it a very good experience both personally and socially? Yes, this is something I won't get from anywhere else. I"m almost hitting my one year mark working at my mom's restaurant, and it's time for a change...

       As I was reading my Computer Gaming World magazine today, I came across a article featuring the title "Size Matters: World's smallest first-person shooter in beta". They have three screenshots and my god... do they look impressive! And I come to read the small letterings next to the picture, "The game itself is 96K..." I was like XO! NO WAY!  I quickly got on the web and searched for the demo game (As they didn't include any link in the magazine). I came across Breakpoint 2004 Competition (in the magazine they also mentioned it) and proceeded to download the beta game.  I fire it up! BOOM! It is real! Considering it's only 96K in file size the in-game details are unreal! Whomever coded this game really makes John Carmack look like a kid on pacifier. (KIDDING!)  I used to be into demo scene but since I joined the Army I've lost contact. Today I found several very nice sites that is dedicated to demo scene and I downloaded 1.4GB of demos tonight. If you guys like to watch some cool stuff on computer you might want to check out the links below.   urlLink Breakpoint 2004   urlLink demoscene.info   urlLink a demo a day keeps the doctor away   urlLink monostep.org

       If you read my previous blogs, you know I works at a restaurant. Jobs like restaurants, tech support, salesmen... etc. all are  customer support jobs . I'm sure most of us don't like to deal with people. People are all different and from my experiences most of them are rude, crazy, and have some kind of mental problems. The rule of industry is: "Customers is always right". I'd like people to think about this too, we, workers are humans as well. I don't think anyone works that hard for money would purposely not giving you good services. Sometimes people just needs to calm down, think clearly, and have a little more patience.    You wouldn't believe what kind of crazy people I see everyday. There hasn't been a day gone by that I don't meet anyone that's not crazy... if any, but I can't recall it. I felt bad for the managers or anyone that's in that level of position. A typical worker doesn't know how to deal with customers and they go straight go the manager for help. I think they need to come up with some type of programs for workers to attend to sharping up their people skills. Managers are not the end-all solution to your problems. Most of the time is server's problems. I believe managers are there to coordinate and solve  certain  type of problems, not there to hold your hand to wipe your ass or warm the water in the swimming pool for your feet.    Overall you can make a lot of money working in any type of customer support related business. It's more about the attitude than anything else.

       I was away since Tuesday night at my cousin's house. We linked up three computers and played FFXI mostly for the whole night (Me, my cousin, and his girl friend). It was kind of fun... but my mind still haven't changed about quitting FFXI. Yup, that's not a mistake... I am quitting FFXI. I still going to keep my account, this is not a permanent thing I just need a break for a while.    Yesterday we went to Jacksonville, FL shopping and eating. Their mall is quite large and have a fair amount of good stores in it. We also went to CompUSA and I bought a wrist rest sponge thingy and a  urlLink  Antec LANPAL: Ultimate PC Case Carrying System  . This carrying system is nice, now I am able to hand carry my computer or just use the strip around my shoulder and carry it. Not bad for only $16.00. Now only I can find a way to change out my ugly black Dell case.... -_-

       Finally, I am mostly done with re-installing everything from ground up. Only thing I need to do now is install Linux.  I have to say... Doom 3 sure looks REALLY impressive! It's amazing the details that's in the game. I downloaded the interview between G4 TV and id Software that happened recently and the in-game movies sure is jaw-dropping. Good thing I've pre-order the game and just waiting until August 3rd. Oh boy... I just can't wait!

       I just re-installed Windows XP. During ATI Radeon 9800 Pro video card installation it crashed (the program, not OS) twice, it was extremely depressing. I wish people/companies would be a little more careful about the codes they are writing, I am really tired of poorly written codes.  Everything is fine now, the Unicode problem seems to be gone now. I am happy!! ^_^

       Wow, tonight is the first night I came home not drunk. Tonight I did not touch a drop of alcohol at all. Amazing! I don't recall when was the last time I came home not drunk...   Windows XP is starting to get on my nerves... It's having problems with any type of Unicode files. It would crash on spot if it encounters any files have name consisting of Unicode and/or the content have Unicode characters. Right now I can't even back up some of my media files because of Unicode. This is not the only problem. I can't even install WinRAR without it crashing within few seconds of activation of installation. How weird!!!  &nbsp;  Well, I'm backing up my stuff now and going to back up those 'problem' files in Linux. Tomorrow I'm scratching this and starting fresh with Windows XP. I'm so fed up with Windows weird anomaly problems!

       I've had some space reserved for *nix system for a quite a while but never found time to decide which should I install. I had some choices in mind: FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Gentoo Linux, Fedora Linux, SuSE Linux, and Slackware Linux.  After I read a recent review on Slackware 10.0 I decided that's what i'm going to use. I chose Linux over *BSD because it's more widely supported. An application usually is developed for Linux first and then ported to run on *BSDs. Everything is updated more frequent on the Linux platform anyway.  I've tried to install Gentoo Linux before but tripped with several times of failure during installation. I'm doing full custom install which download every individual application off the internet, config, and install them one at a time. Many times it fails somewhere along the line so I'm quite disturbed by that fact.  I first started out with Linux on Slackware back in 1995. I've used many various Linux distributions and found Slackware to be the most straight to the point, no BS, no bloatware Linux distribution. Though I haven't touch Slackware Linux in several years but it seems to me that basic underlaying concept is still the same from before so I decided to take the plunge and try it out! Wish me luck!

       My little sister is visiting from Taiwan today and she will be here till August when school starts back up in Taiwan. I am quite excited to see how she has been for the past year in Taiwan.  She was #1 student from her school in Taiwan. Grades, classes, sports; all #1!! I am so proud of her! ^^

           I got a new table today! The chair is new too, I had it for few days now. The chair cost more than twice the price of the table, surprised? The chair was $130 and the table was $54.  As any geeks would say, you can't skim out on chair. Chair is one of the most important stuff to a geek. A good chair provides baby-like comfort and a bad chair would cause you more than pain and suffering. Sitting on a chair for several hours at a time is a very intensive task, don't think so? Think this, imaging yourself on a chair with a decent pad and one without it, try both for few hours and tell me if the pad isn't any important. I speak from experience... so next time you getting a chair make sure it's a good one and not one of those cheap Wal-Mart specials on display.

       Have you ever so determined about doing something that you could trade off anything in the world to do it? It isn't something you want to prove to the world... just you want to see how far a limit you can push yourself to. Instead of proving to anyone, you are proving to yourself.  I've laid waste of my life for way too long... sleeping, watching TV, play games, slacking off pondering and day dreaming... etc. You know... the not-so-productive activities that everyone of us go through every single day. I don't want my surrounding people to call me a geek or anything by doing the usual 'geeky' stuff... like carrying and reading a book all the time. (I actually seen a geeky guy do that every single time he comes to my restaurant to eat... *shrug* What a fag...)  I've figured some of it out last night. Most of us can reconfigure our daily lifestyle just by watching out for the tinniest little things around us every day; mainly just organizing. When I get a book from my bookshelf, after I read it I just have to put it back. When I buy new stuff from store and very excited about it, just have to throw the wrappings and box away instead of laying they on the floor. Most important, a timed schedule... something not too strict but just a general idea of hourly tasks. I believe the hardest part is to follow your own schedule, because something always come up that's not according to your plan and ruin your time management. That's why I proposed a 'general time schedule'. Not down to very specific details but rather an organized time for myself.  Today would be the first day I'll try to make up a schedule and follow it, so wish me luck! ^^

          A totally new concept PDA called TDA!  Tactile Personal Assistant ! I just spent few minutes going over what is so different about it compared to PDA and the only major difference is... TDA uses a touchscreen instead of using handwriting recognition. Hurray! Whoopee!  It's interesting concept but I rather see the product in action myself rather than believe in hype... You can find more information about it below...   urlLink Jackito-TDA official site

       Recently I believe I started to fall into liking a girl that used to work at my place...  Since I broke up with my ex back in July 26th 2003 I've been not able to trust any girls for any reason. I've had girls that comes after me before I didn't realize at that time but I do now. It was this: 1) I was still not over my ex (I am still not over it now) and 2) I don't trust whatever girls says or do (I just started to begin overcome that now because of this girl I know from work). But now almost a year has pass by and.... I started to open myself up a little bit now.  This girl I met from work isn't the type I would like. Be honest, she is quite a character... compared to my ex she is no comparison in term of many things. In many ways my ex was way superior than her but I still fell into liking her. Isn't love a weird thing?  It's hard to earn back someone's trust again after so many repetitive mistakes. If my ex could give me a chance and look at me now, I've changed from 95% of the mistakes I've made before. But now isn't possible, that is perfectly OK. I understand. I can only blame myself for not realizing it earlier. I mean... who else is to blame except for my own immaturity? But changing one's personality requires a very personal caring and looking out, that's something I never got from my ex because of our situation and environment and she rather not waiting it out and abandoned me. So never ever again I will trust in long distance relationship again! Simply it isn't worth it.  Life is full of changes. I believe everyone learns something new every single day. But the hard part is taking in the good stuff and discard the bad ones, also it's hard to resist temptations. After all, we are all flesh and blood... emotions is everyone's driven force. The line between being rational and irrational is so often fine that you can't see it, not along try to judge it.  How do you feel about your past 'true' relationships? Are you still angry? sad? or no regrets about it? If you have the chance to start over again how would you be different? This is a question I often ask myself...

       I must say... everyone needs to watch what they say around people. Sometimes you just don't know who is around you and what type of people it is.  Tonight at work me and Abin (my cousin) was talking about this girl in Chinese. Eventually we felt like that the girl understands Chinese, it was embarrassing! Though she and her friends told us she doesn't understand Chinese, but to my believe I think she do. She was a full head blonde!  Come to find out that she is military brat, so we (me and Abin) is still suspicious about if she understands Chinese or not.  A lesson learned tonight at work... whatever you do and/or say, you need to be certain about yourself. Even if someone understands you or not they could be offended by your actions.  [It's hard to build a bridge but only take a single blow to destroy it.]

       I felt slight uneasy recently. Not sure what is bothering me but I've cut down my time in FFXI way lot! For the past two weeks I don't think I've plunged more than two hours of playtime at most... I am not quitting, but somewhat lost interests...  It's about half way into my summer break, I haven't done anything really productive other than catching myself up with computer news. If my work hours would be a little better I might have more time to do my own stuff. Getting home every night right about or after 12AM is started to get on my nerves. Seems like I don't have enough time for anything, don't you ever felt like that?  I bought a very nice $130 chair yesterday. It's very comfortable and all, I like it a lot. Chair to geeks is like tires to a car. A bad chair can cost you pain and suffering a few hours into geeking; bad set of tires can cost you precious time on track.  Well, this is my first post! ^^

       What is worse than the level grinds after lvl32 in FFXI? Damn n00bs!  I'm currently in Dunes right now and I've level to lvl16 4 times. BECAUSE PEOPLE KEPT PULLING 2 MONSTERS AT ONCE!! OMG it's so f**king annoying!  It takes about 2 days to gain a level in dunes. I did get some exp today, but it's more like backwards the time I've spent in. Last party I was in this lvl17 WAR (no sub) was the puller. Both times he pulled 2 monsters at once. First time Goblin Gambler and Goblin Leecher, and we barely survived that. Second time he pulled a Goblin gambler and aggroed a Ghoul on his way back. I mean... comon, if you see a Ghoul in the way why don't you run around it instead of running through him??!?!?!?!?!!? I don't f**king get it?  I was the first to die because me and this other RDM was serving as ghetoo WHM. I tried my best to keep the tanks (yes, we have multiple tanks and they all provoke at the same time) (I understand you want to spam provoke as much as possible but in certain situations you don't want to spam voke) and I was the first one to die. I've died in previous 2 parties before so this time I just had it. I quit the party and log out.  I don't hate Dunes, Qufim or Kazham.... I just hate people don't know or too damn stupid enough to know what they are doing.

       What goes around, comes around. Last night I got mocked by a co-worker about I will leave very late from work when he was walking out. Which I did, I didn't leave the restaurant till 12:48AM (which was ridiculous).  Today I left work way ahead of him, roughly the same amount of time he left me last night before. I didn't mock him about anything, I just said "bye" to him. Sometimes you just can't be too cocky about stuff. I was happy. I could've helped him clean up so he can go home early, but I want to teach him a lesson.  I could've left way earlier but I stayed to ensure the part of my job as an assistant/backup manager was done right.  I don't like being mock by infrequent misfortune and I'm sure none of you likes that neither. I even sometimes makes the same mistake, but it's all a learning process. You just have to think before you say, otherwise bad omens will come back to you.

       I used to never believe in fate, but more and more things happened to me in the past year makes me to believe more and more in fate. Sometimes stuff happens for no reason and there is nothing you can do about it. Sometimes regardless how hard you 'tried' and 'work' on a problem/situation the outcome still comes up short of your expectation. I believe, for now, the only weapon aganist fate is hope. If we can predict the future, then, we don't need hope since we can already view our future. Since we can't look into the future and future unknowns are unknown. The only thing we can rely on is "hope".  Sometimes I even felt I can't rely on anything...

       Last night I was bored out of my mind and I started reading " Ivor Horton's Beginning ANSI C++ The Complete Language" book. So far this is quite a good book. The author don't seem to bullshit around and go straight to the point.  I felt like something is going in my body again... something inspiration is happening again! Coding is fun. I dropped coding for more than six years now, I'm sure there are many new things and it's going to be hard for me to pick up everything again... but I'm up to the challenge!
