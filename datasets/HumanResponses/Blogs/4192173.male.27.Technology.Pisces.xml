      Ok get this, I call Apple and the laptop is back in action. Joyus beyond belief I rush there and pick up the laptop. I am told I have maxed the bitch out. Upon returning home, I go and transfer a ton of files to the tower computer, which is pretty much maxed out as well. Everything works in it ecxept of course for Cubase. I'm just happy to have my baby back. Then I go out for a few hours come back, and around about midnight, while moving some files out of it, it crashes again. I almost crapped myself with disgust. Of course this happen when I'm leaving for Chicago tomorrow and LA on Tuesday. I can't win.  I'm off to apple literally right now. Bastards.  F

      I'm off to Chicago this weekend to lend a hand to Jared as work continues on the new Chemlab record. I havent seen Jared in a year, so that will be great, and any excuse to see the Cracknation family is a welcome one. This record is coming along nicely, I might add...  The hard-drive in my laptop decided to take a dive yesterday, but luckily I had mailed all my work on the album to Jason (Novak, my dear friend of cracknation.com fame, and producer of the chemlab album) before all this crap went down. I would have been in MUCH worse of a mood if it wasnt for Ash consoling me and then Signficiant Other coming home and getting me out of the house for Tapas (thanks G) and a trip to the Chinatown Ice Cream Factory. Fortunately, any pending music work, including a remix of Pigface, was already finished or stored in my home computer. Fate of said laptop to be determined tomorrow. rrrrrrr.  Last night, I went to see the play SALOME, starring Al Pacino, with everyones favorite college graduate, The Kidd. Pacino was hilarious and Marisa Tomei topless was worth the price of admission.

      Focused (read: the boring process of burning cd's) at the moment  on the next aggression EP for THESE MILLION NIGHTS, which by the way, is my all time favorite aggression song. Ash's single mix so far is really hot. Lotta warmth to it. Remix kits are going out now. We've got the British , we've got the Russians, we have a few New Yorkers, and maybe even some midwesterner's remixing. And to top it off, we have a cover picture from Iceland. You can't get more international than that. Maybe it will come out this year. Maybe ;-)  F

      My former neighbor John Cale has a new EP out called "5 Tracks" which I believe is a precursor to a full length album due out early next year. This is great stuff. Anyone who is interested in something different, interesting and catchy should snag this. He's a tad grumpy in real life (he once almost kung fu kicked Chris Connelly), but he's a fantastic musician, who, like his former bandmate Lou Reed, seems to improve with age (not counting Reed's dumbass Edgar Allan Poe thing). "FRAGMENTS OF A RAINY SEASON" remains one of my all time favorite CD's. Many moons ago, Chris Link made Dr. Fury and I go see Cale at NYU while he was touring for "FRAGMENTS" and to say it was one of the best things I ever saw would be selling it way too short. I've seen the man perform dozens of times since and he never ever once failed to be incredible. To my knowledge he hasn't peformed here in NYC for quite some time, but when he comes, it's an absolute must see.  I have asked some of my other MOGpac members to post on this board about their likes/dislikes of all things music/film/books etc, cause honestly, I am bored reading myself. We all have such diverse tastes that I'm sure anyone who reads this as it progresses will wonder how we all haven't killed each other yet.  In the meantime, I have started preparations for the new aggression remix EP for THESE MILLION NIGHTS. Remix kits are finally going out. I'm hoping to get a few Russians on this one, cause the Russians, you know, GET IT.  F

      Acumen brought the pain to NYC and the way I am feeling this morning, the pain has been brought. First off, thanks to The Significant Other for putting up with the madness even though she had to be at work at 7am this morning. She probably doesn't read this, but she is appreciated. Having 5 guys crash in our tiny pad is not the most logical or easy.  Because of the graduation party for Ciao Baby and his sister, S.O. and I were late for the acu-gig. We missed the DJA? set, but got the full brunt of the rawk. I was quite pleased with the set list, especially since they played my old favorite, fuckface, which came out around the time the acumen/aggression (back when it was me and PH) pally-dom started. Such memories. I think. Anyway, the new songs are good and despite the lack of the ILC material, I was happy to see them for what they will never understand was a good and appreciative crowd for NYC. Also, I remain a huge fan of the Acumen rythmn section. Dan Brill blows my mind on drums and I'm not just saying that because he was sporting an aggression T-shirt onstage. He's no Robin though, but someday maybe he can try to be as good ;-)....  It was nice to see some familiar faces, like the kids from the message boards and thanks to Aaron the Pak for buying Irene and I some drinks. It took him 7 years to get around to it, but he did it, even though he is from a town made fun of on Sex In the City. the shock of the night was running into Charlie from Form, who just moved to NY from Dayton (Charlie and his bandmate Paul did a great remix for us on our newest single). And to Charlie, also, thanks for the drink.  Late night drinks were had locally, which of course led to the usual debates/discussions/rows, etc. and which of course leads to the one thing men need in the morning..Egg bitches. You can email Jason Novak about that one.  And now, a round of apologies....  First, to Matt Gentile. Acumen played "Gun Lover". I was told they weren't going to. Forgive me. it was good.  Second, to Ryan "The Sarcastic Bastard", who drank sour low fat milk in my house. I can't feel THAT sorry for Ryan as he CHOSE to be the merch guy for Acumen. That's masochism enough. No wonder why he's drinking whiskey at 11 in the morning.  Ok, gotta clean this place up now. rrrrr.  F

      Back from another trip to LA...saw Saintface last night at their biggest gig to date at the Mercury Lounge. Though they might argue, the gig was a success. Good crowd, band was tight, Peter's voice was in fine shape. They have new song called "There Is a Room" that is really solid. However, someone needs to convince my friend Peter Saintface to record a goddamn album already. The man has 4 albums worth of songs and only has 1 EP out. Leaving these gigs without having the songs at home to listen to makes me freaking mental. The person who convinces him to record an album gets a free drink from me (and Dorigen)...  Going back and forth with Jared on the new round of Chemlab demos, which I have just received. It's getting there. I think the record is at that point where it's a few weeks away from being great (and finished)...Jason/Jamie are now on tour, which gives Jared some time to go and record some more vox and think about changes, etc. I'm a big fan of this album. I'm gonna try and do some last minute synth parts before Jason and co. come to stay at MOGworld when their tour hits NY this weekend.  In other news, the hypefactor live experience is currently being pondered...Since there are only 6 HF songs, I'm throwing around eclectic ideas from the days of MOG past. Kudzu Rail anyone?  Live wresting at MSG next week, TWO nights in a row, God Bless you Matt Gentile.  F

      Still out of it from the Chicago trip. Lotta work, too little sleep. I was literally in the studio till the cab picked me up from the airport. Jared seems happy with the results, which obviously is a good indiciation of where this is going. Meanwhile, Significant Other and I saw FINDING NEMO, which is quite good and touching. I was surprised by its "adult" issues (death, single parenting, handicaps, etc.). I admit I got a lil choked up and S.O. found herself crying every 5 minutes. The animation is blow away. I still like MONSTERS INC. better.  Off to LA tomorrow for 10 days.   F

      Almost 3am here in Chicago...tired, beat, exhausted, and all things like that. Day two of Chemlab sessions have gone extremely well. We just spent the last few hours recording Greg "Slo' Hand" Lucas on the guitar. He's adding that dirty chem guitar sound that the kids love. Jared jumps for joy. Jamie, Jared, and I took a section of a song omitted from the album and turned it into some chemlab goodness. Maybe it will make it onto the album. Jared's voice is in fine shape, he's two songs and a few overdubs away from wrapping the vox up for this beeyotch. Phrase of the day is "Velveteen Pouch". Don't ask. Crackhouse is always a fun place to hang out and work and the Novak/Brittion clan are excellent hosts who take good care of their guests. And yes, the new Acumen record is as dirty and nasty and as hard as Jason promised. My poor ears. Good friends, good times, good music being made...home tomorrow.  F

      A brief hypefactor update: I spent the past two days writing choruses and tracking guitars for two hype songs, although I cannot tell you which ones because I haven't a clue about song titles yet. I can say with certainty that one of them is  not  the track mentioned earlier by F.J.: "They've Just" ("They've just... what?" I ask.)  I have a feeling that one may be rejected, or removed and used as a new track in its own right, but we shall see this weekend.  One element of the new recordings that diverges wildly from "The Distracted Lover" is the amount of production and layering going on in the songs, especially in terms of the live instruments. For one track - a slower, funkier number with a brooding verse - I layered seven tracks of guitar on the chorus alone, from acoustics to 12-strings to a harmonized six string. This practice, while complex, thickens up the sound, adds texture with multiple instruments and incorporates new melodies into an otherwise straightforward riff.  After I write the basic tune for a track, I put on a pair of headphones and listen to the song on repeat, searching for gaps in the part that can be filled in with new melodies and riffs. The listener will rarely be able to pick out an individual part when listening to the completed track, but each contributes to the melody, however subtley.  I am in the middle of writing a retrospective of  urlLink "The Distracted Lover"  recording sessions for the  urlLink hypefactor Web site , much of it focusing on the creative process and the progression of each song. To jog my memory, I listened to the record on repeat while writing, and I am amazed at times by the sonic simplicity of the entire EP, both to its benefit and detriment. During the 2001 sessions - my first major undertaking as an engineer and songwriter - we rarely multitracked any individual instrument more than twice. While this was not a conscious choice (and more a product of our own inexperience), it ultimately complimented the song structures, which were simplistic to begin with. This time around, however, everyone in the hype gang is striving for something less obvious: melodies up front, but bolstered by highly experimental production. Sound design in particular has become a major part of the process, with F.J. leading the charge.  While I am on the subject of musical sophistication, I have a few words about  urlLink Gustavo Cerati . First, this is a man whose production values have grown exponentially throughout his career, and never once at the expense of solid songwriting. If you listen to his most recent solo work -  urlLink "Siempre Es Hoy"  and  urlLink "Bocanada"  - you will understand what I mean. The songs have infinite sonic depth, layering part upon part upon part, and always to the benefit of the basic melody. Were there a Frederick Law Olmstead of music, Cerati would be it; his simple, engaging songs rarely belie the great technical sophistication behind their creation.  While watching Cerati live at Webster Hall on Wednesday night, I was amazed that his band - two keyboardists, a female singer, a bassist and a drummer - succeeded in replicating a great deal of that complex production live. Every effort was made to properly play the album live while also adding new sounds and melodies. The moody "Bocanada" material was notably elegant as Cerati and band completely recast those tracks in a rock framework. I cannot wait for the bootlegs of this tour. Viva!

      All you have to do is read my previous Cerati review and apply it to last night here in NYC, with a few noted changes:  1. You would think with the amount of money Webster Hall rakes in thanks to the millions of tourists, Long Islanders and Tunnell People they bring it weekly, the could turn on the freaking aircon.  2. Crowd was MUCH better than LA, a rarity in NYC.  3. Cerati thankfully didn't play the rap song from his album, which would have sent Ash home screaming bloody murder.   4. He altered the middle part of his set to fit on some more reworkings from his previous record Bocanada. Ace.  I'm glad Ash and B got to see this so they have a good understanding as to where I am at in my head musically.  Meanwhile, Chemlab should be done as I type. Looking forward to the final mixes, track order, etc. Now the fun beings. Web site and merch are discussed with Louche  And finally, back to HF2, which has been itching at me. Lots of new plug ins, courtesy of Ash for me to play with in Cubase. FUN.  F

      Lots of catching up today...  Chemlab is in the home stretch. It's down to a few days, for real. Jared is at work with the Crackers to tweak and settle on a tracklisting. My views on that are in. In the meantime, the powers that be at the label have given the album a big thumbs up after hearing the bulk of it.  Now the business begins, so it's emails and phone calls the bulk of the day. OXIDIZER is now slated for either the third or fourth week in October. There is initial discussion about a track appearing on a compilation, though that's not confirmed. It might possibly end up being the machine porn epic SCORNOCOPIA or the in your face rollercoaster rocker PULSE (aka WHITE ROOM BLACK NOISE though we're not sure which title to use yet).   I've asked Ash to get involved on an aggression remix for Chemlab, not just because I know he would do something incredible, but because I'd love to see Ash get his hands dirty in the machine world for a bit. I need to get him hooked back to a computer and away from guitars just for a bit.  Defcon Gilez (my pal and promoter of our UK extravaganza in 01) informs me the band he manages, Needleye, are remixing the aggression and could have something in a few weeks. These guys are hard and nasty. They are hurrying to wrap it up because have just drafted in a producer of some noteriety, also a friend of mine (and well known to industrial fans around the world and known especially to my advisor/lawyer/agent), to produce their new demo. I can't say who though!  I'm a man of many secrets, sorry. the only reason I get to hear this stuff (and keep my day job) is because I'm good at keep it secret.   It's no secret that Cerati is tomorrow night!  F

      Back home at last...But I  would like to vent against Apple and their hardware for a moment. How the HELL could they make a laptop battery that lasts only a few hours? This obviously was not designed for the bi-coastal types such as myself. Thousands of feet in the air, somewhere in the middle of the US today, I was in full swing on a new HF song called (at this moment) "THEY'VE JUST...". It has some haunting acoustic fingerpicking by Ms. Emmett, some broken beats courtsey of Baby B and Ash, and some melodic bassness from yours truly. Simple and moving. Anyhoo, I was just hitting my stride with the song , and the damn battery runs out. Time FLIES. I was so pissed. Luckily, S.O. was on hand to make sure the flight attendants provided me with enough tea to last the rest of the flight.  Apple, you can make a 30 gig freakin' Ipod, why can't you make a 4-5 hour battery? Douches!  Because of my bicoastal travels, Louche and I miss each other via Email today. He is in Chicago handling "the details", which I think is the nice way of saying "the record label bullshit". There are certain matters that need my attention, I'm told. I had a stop-over in Cleavland and while I honestly have no clue as to where Cleavland is in proximity to Chicago, I was tempted to just say fuck all and head over to Cracknation. But honestly, I am glad NOT to be part of "the details". Jared informs me that the thing I was concerned about in my previous MOGblog update is not the case, but I await the full story. I think there is some last minute manuevering to throw some more on the album, which has a firm cut off in the can deadline of...um..."sometime this week". It all depends on how much "wiggle room" there is. Look, if it makes the album better, go for it, I say. In the meantime, I am told Inivisible is quite "hot" for the new Chemlab album, now all they have to do is promote the shit out of it and treat it like the event it is. This album is a blockbuster and the second Summer of Hate is upon us (even though the record comes out this fall).  I have agreed to do a remix for my pals in K-NITRATE. However, I will not be remixing K-Nitrate, but will be remixing their side-project Audio War, which I have never heard, but I am sure is loud and nasty. Could be good! The Russians have sent me a note letting me know they are hard at work on thier aggression remix. I am salivating for that one cause I think it will be amazing if they do it the way I think they will!  I have come home to find Cerati tickets waiting for me. He plays here in NYC on Wed. Thank God!  F

      It’s no secret that I have a tendency to exaggerate a bit, hence the origin of the name Hypefactor (though that’s for another time). However, I am not exaggerating when I write that the seeing the Gustavo Cerati gig here in LA last night was a life changing experience. Lv23 (who redefines DANCE FEVER), Bradley J. Fox and I were all were blown away.  I wont get too deep into it, but quite frankly, the man is a genius. He has an uncanny ability to write incredible and emotional songs that perfectly marry modern electronics to rock instruments and pop structure. It was a flawless 2-hour performance .The Palace here in LA has a REALLY large stage, so Cerati was able to take full advantage of the space. He was enthusiastic and animated  and seemed to genuinely enjoy himself. He is such a thrilling musician to watch and is an incredible guitarist. You can’t help but be drawn in. He’s retained most of his excellent band of young musicians from the last tour (including his multi-talented sidekick, Falvius) and they were incredibly tight . Together, they were able to push the current songs to new heights while redefining the old songs to fit the current Cerati sound. It also helps to have a very young and hot back up singer (who I’m told is Cerati’s MUCH younger girlfriend…brilliant) to make sure the lads pay attention. It’s also the first time I have seen a drummer almost as incredible as mine. Everything about this show was first class and the music, as always, was inspiring. These guys are used to playing arenas in other parts of the world, and the entire presentation and dedication to perfection reflects that. Lv23 went to soundcheck and confirmed our belief that Cerati is a TYRANT when it comes to making everything sound perfect. He even went up to the soundbooth to mix certain things himself when he was unhappy with the mix.   Unfortunately, there is one thing that Ash will hate in the set, and I intend to ask him to get me a drink or something at Webster hall next week when I know this particular song is about to start.  For someone who has been in the business over 20 years, Gustavo Cerati continues to evolve and in my eyes, can do no wrong. In the same way seeing Revenge in 1989, the Sisters in 1991 and Ministry in 1992 effected me so significantly at 20, Gustavo Cerati defines the musical path I choose to make in at 30.   In other news, Oxidizer has taken an interesting turn and might possible have a last minute guest appearance. I don’t know if I necessarily agree with this move, but we have to see how it plays out. Jared might be in Chicago by the time you read this sorting through everything. When talking to the producer today, I complimented him on the programming in a song called SCORNOCOPIA, a song I thought I had nothing to do with the writing of. He then informed me that it was I who did the programming that started the song and the melody was mine. This instance of me forgetting something like that is not an isolated incident. This happened I think on the first HF CD as well. I would walk into the studio and say “man, I love that, good job!” and then be told I did the part a week before. Do I have musical Alzheimers? Shit!  F  P.S. I wish I had seen Dave Gahan in NYC just to have something new to argue about with your Saintface Comrades ;-)

      One of the common denominators among the members of the MOGpac is that we are drawn to new music by performers who have been at the game for the better part of twenty years. The music industry being what it is in 2003 - and excuse me for being  that guy  who believes there are fewer and fewer significant new artists being promoted in this age - much of our discussion revolves around performers from the 1980s and 1990s that are still releasing solid recordings.  There are risks involved in this practice, namely, severe disappointment (example: 2002's "Release" by the Pet Shop Boys.) But there are plenty of veterans out there writing material that is passable, charming, even brilliant ("Music of the Spheres" by Ian "Auto Tune" Brown.)  Dave Gahan, the Depeche Mode singer-turned-solo artist, is no slouch performer or singer. But "Paper Monsters" - his solo debut recorded while on hiatus from the Mode - proves that Dave can write a convincing pop album on his own terms. So convincing, in fact, that Martin Gore would be a dunderhead if he relegated Dave to the vocal booth on the next Mode record.  Based on "Papers Monsters" and Dave in concert - Matt and I had the pleasure of seeing him at the Hammerstein Ballroom yesterday, along with a  severely  intoxicated crowd - I would go so far as to argue that the solo Dave Gahan delivered what Depeche and bands of their ilk should have been doing for the past six years. The record is dark and intoxicating, the show is rowdy and defiant, and the whole package is cast in the form of stunning songwriting and production.  Dodgy lyrics aside, Dave on record is everything only hinted at in modern Depeche: brooding ("Hidden Houses"), romantic ("Stay"), sage ("Hold On.) It works alone with a bottle of red wine, or when your S.O. is in for the evening.  To stunning effect, "Paper Monsters" live is exactly what it should be: a rawk 'n' roll show. The uptempo numbers are booming, raucous affairs with Dave dominating the stage, while the album's moodier tracks are steamrollers, slowly building to a crescendo. Much like Al Jourgensen of Ministry, Dave's newfound physical and mental health grounded the show - he looks alive, youthful, energized - and his band feeds off the energy of a 41-year-old man convincingly acting 21 on stage.  To be noted: Dave even managed to enrich Mode standards - "Never Let Me Down Again," "A Question Of Time," "Personal Jesus" - that have had the life beaten out of them by retro radio, DJs and the band themselves. The dancefloor reinterpreted by a rock band. Synthpop this was not.  The watershed point of the show, however, was the second encore: Mode classics played on stand-up bass, acoustic 12-string guitar, acoustic drums and keyboards. Suddenly, "Enjoy The Silence" didn't sound dated anymore. Regardless of what you think of "Paper Monsters," Dave deserves credit for single-handedly reinvigorating his band's back catalogue.

      I'm burning new Chem-Mixes now again. Ive been through more blank discs than I own CD's this week. I can't write any more about how much I love this album, cause it's all I write about. i want you all to have it...  Today, Grandpa Al makes Grandpa Factor's day when he writes on his website: "WE START ON THE COCKS AND MINISTRY CD'S IN THE STUDIO STARTING AROUND AUG.15 (PRE-PRODUCTION) WE HAVE CONFIRMATIONS FROM: OGRE, GIBBY HAYNES,CHRIS CONNELY, LUC VAN ACKER, AND OF COURSE, PAUL, LOUIS, MIKEY, MAX, REY, AND MYSELF.  WE ALSO ARE GETTING LUXA PAN RECORDS UP AND RUNNING TO RELEASE A LOT OF THE OUT OF PRINT STUFF. (PAIL HEAD, 1000 HOMO DJ'S, OLD COCKS, ACID HORSE, BLACKOUTS ETC. ETC. ETC.)"  I just literally had two conversations with two different people about how they should be doing this shit. Well done Al!  Cerati tomorrow. It's gonna own like no other.  F

      Unfortunately, Raw at the Staples Center didn’t happen last night, but after a Looooong weekend at the San Diego Comic Con, I need all the rest I can get. 70,000 people and half a million square feet of Comic Con over the course of 4 days can be very draining. Poor S.O. has to deal with a ton of new toys and such in the apt, but I made sure that some of my purchases were NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS related (it’s like her favorite film EVER).  For you genre film buffs, you may have read about a fan-film called BATMAN: DEAD END, which had quite possibly the biggest non-studio buzz at the Con. It was all over the net that this was the “best Batman film ever made” and that perennial fanboy demi-gods Kevin Smith and Alex Ross gave it their stamps of approval. A still leaked to the Internet looked just like Alex Ross’ interpretation of Batman. Naturally, my curiosity was piqued, so I set out to see this alleged “masterpiece”. Well, needless to say, it was quite the letdown, not because it’s bad, but because it is basically a costume/monster/fx reel for some commercial directors, not an actual three-act film. It’s like a student film with an unlimited budget. What they don’t mention is that it’s Batman vs. Aliens vs. Predator and an excuse to show-off the crew’s talents as a creature shop. I found it laughable, honestly, though the hundred plus fan boys and girls cheered as if Jesus had risen from the grave in front of them. Snooze. My suggestion is to buy the animated MYSTERY OF THE BATWOMAN DVD later this year to get a good Bat-fix. However, if you want to see DEAD END, check it out at:  http://www.theforce.net/theater/shortfilms/batman_deadend/  Finally got around to start working on Hypefactor today. The process is slow and I don’t see it picking up in it’s pace, really. We’re writing some very complex stuff and the bulk of my time is sorting through the many different guitar and bass parts to see what works best together. It’s a fun process, especially when you have such a rich amount of material to choose from, but it’s certainly time consuming. Also, I don’t want to rush this one; I want to be able to make sure I deliver a solid first round of arrangements.  In other news, the latest (and almost last) round of Chem-mixes has come in from Cracknation. This was the biggest bulk of new mixes in quite some time, so there is quite a lot to absorb. What’s most interesting about these new mixes is how the crackteam has pushed the machine rock envelope to a new level. The record is very warm, but chock full of machine manipulation. It’s gotten into that weird twisted cyber territory…and I mean that in a good way. Jared is flying into Chicago this week to wrap it up with the boys. I, however, will remain in LA before heading back to NYC next week, which is smart anyways, as too many cooks in the kitchen at such a crucial point could be counter-productive and quite honestly, based on what I have heard so far, I don’t think I could add much as they seem to have it nailed.  For the record, I played a recent rough version of the album for my lawyer/agent/advisor who back in the day was an advisor and trusted confidant of the lab and she was blown away by Oxidizer’s “chemlab-ness”. This is a huge vote of confidence, cause if it sucked, or didn’t sound like Chemlab, she would be the first to tell us.  Cerati in 2 days. Too good.  F

      My "lovely underage girlfriend" and I were the sole MOGpackers to represent the most recent Saintface show on Saturday day night.  The gig was held in what used to be known as the "the Cooler" on 14th btw 9th and Washington (sidenote: my only memory of the Cooler was an AFI gig I was supposed to see there in November, 1999.  I was so anxious for that show as it would have been the first time in two years that i had seen them.  Unfortunately, I never made it to the show.  I had gone home after work and was halfway out my door when I received a phone call from then recent ex-gf, who since is being referred to as "the hussy".  She started a fight and held me up just long enough to have to miss the show.  I then had to resort to seeing AFI the following night in SUFFOLK COUNTY at a biker bar.  That's a whole other story.  But upon seeing how small and nicely set up the COoler is, I was angered all over again...feeling 21 again...something that my lovely companion cannot claim.).  The space is set up in a very cool way.  Decent size stage that is rather low to the ground, couches and stools in the actual performance area; a separate bar area (yes Frank, they had Stella); and a totally separate lounge type area.  Very cool space.  My companion and I got to the venue at 11.30, just to time to catch the last two songs of the final support act, The New Years.  I have to say - I liked them.  Their look definitely needs polishing (bass player was sporting a sleeveless t (surfer style) and an eyebrow ring), but the sound was pretty good - hipster rock with more of an edge and even the occasional post-hardcore drone.  I look forward to checking them out again.  For the main event, Peter Saintface made sure he wouldn't remember it.  Aside from that the band was tight playing mostly new tracks probably heard at the Mercury Lounge gig a few weeks back (by the by - they're back there in August - on a Saturday night.  Well done!), and included one entirely new "under-rehearsed" track.  I wish I could describe it for you but I'm too tried.  The set overall was very good eventhough I don't get to hear my faves from back in the '00.  One lighter point of the evening: two Poontang girls made an appearance along with some Dutch dude who was there to have "fun!".  No names, but when Peter sang a few words and pointed to one IP gal, she swooned hardcore.  When the same happened to me, I felt overwhelmed with wanderlust.  Dave Gahan on Wednesday night.  Looking forward.  Scary thing about this show: I checked ticketbastard.com this morning and tix were still available on the floor of the Hammerstein!!!  Crazy, but he apparently plays some fun stuff, so I am excited.  "til the end" M.

      I waited a few days before posting this, but the other night my lawyer/agent/advisor and I ventured to an obscure  part of California called Costa Mesa to see the reunited original 5-piece Duran Duran in what was supposed to be their first US show in 18 years (unfortunately they threw in a club gig in LA the night before, thus making this the SECOND gig in the US in 18 years).  It is no secret that Duran Duran are the first band I was ever a true fan of quite possibly the most important band in my life. And perhaps, with the exception of Skrew, believe it or not, I have seen Duran Duran more than any band. However, I never saw the original lineup as I was too young, so my first experience seeing Duran Duran live, was the NOTORIOUS era 3-piece line up at Madison Square Garden in 1987 (also the first for my lawyer/agent/advisor, though I didn't know her then!). For those of you old enough to remember, being a male duran duran fan in the 1980's was about as cool as being pro-hitler in the 1940's. Branded a "fag", "homo" or anything else for years as a teenager because I didn't love Motley Crue or Twisted Sister, I as Dan Hamill will attest, remained a loyal Duran Duran fan for 2 decades. And I never waivered once.  So obviously this gig in Costa Mesa was important to us. I'm not even sure what my expectations were, but they were shattered and surpassed by the third song (mostly cause the sound blew until that point, but I chalk that up to being in an outdoor amphitheatre). I realized that at that point that for the past 18 years I have seen nothing but Duran Duran cover bands, cause THIS is the real deal.  First, I was shocked at how good they look (always important), but nothing could prepare me for the incredible chemistry the original line up has and tremendous talent that the two members I had never seen perform, Andy and Roger Taylor, have oozing out of them. What they bring to the table is unbelievavle.   It also no secret that to me John Taylor, co-founder of Duran Duran, is without a doubt THE single most underrated bassist of his generation (and inadvertanty inspired the "Factor" name. Now reunited with Roger Taylor, his spirtual other half, the Duran rythmn section is second to none. I had been hoping since the day he left Duran in 1997 that John Taylor would return to the fold, and seeing him here made realize that he is the heart and soul of the band. And it's biggest fan. Every band needs that member who is unconditional in their love for the band. I can relate.  They played the hits, they played album tracks such as NEW RELIGION and CARELESS MEMORIES with the energy that musicians half their age couldn't muster, and they played new songs that potentially rival the best of their back catalog. They also played some hits from their post Andy/Roger period and again, the two returning members added their own unique touches to songs such as COME UNDONE and ORDINARY WORLD that were fantastic.   And did I mention how good they look?  Back in New York recently, the VH1 "I LOVE THE 80'S" (I DONT love the 80's btw) poked fun at the alleged limited keyboard playing skills of Nick Rhodes, which only goes to show how stupid people are. Nick Rhodes pretty much invented the Duran "sound". When SAVE A PRAYER starts, and thousands of people swoon, who do you think created those synth sounds that tug at your heart and make you a big pile of mush? Genius. That I say Fuck You to the singer out of Def Leppard who wishes he had a quarter of Nick Rhodes' talent. Pour some sugar on THIS, you bitch.  I don't wanna even get into the brilliance of Simon LeBon, who's voice has improved tremendously over the years and represents a lost generation of uninhibited, sexy frontmen who combine talent with charisma to cast a spell over their audience. He has charisma to spare and is full on.  By the 3rd song I realized we were seeing something very very special. By the encore, my lawyer/advisor/agent said to me "what MORE can they do?" and yet they do even more. These guys are playing for keeps and are very obviously determined to cement their legacy. I have never seen a band like this before. There is a reason this band has sold 70 million records. This isn't a comeback, this is something beyond that. It's not nostalgic. I don't know what this is, but this was one of the best gigs I have ever seen.  F

      Literally. As I type this at 4:40 a.m. on Tuesday, I am burning discs of the new hypefactor sessions for F.J. to work on during his two-week California sojurn. This is the beauty of the modern home recording system - provided that he has the necessary files, F.J. can mix, modify and arrange any work we do in the studio while he is traveling or out of town. When flying, the majority of us sleep or watch "Miss Congeniality" on the in-flight movie. The ever-efficient F.J., on the other hand, mixes. By the time he and I are both back in the same ZIP code, there will be a whole slew of changes and things will develop from there.  Conveniently, I am off to Chicago tomorrow for a week-long holiday with a couple of the crew from school. I'll have copies of the new material along so that I can write more guitar parts at home, which will then be recorded and fleshed out in New York come the end of July.  After Monday night's session, I began the tedious process of editing the new material and programming some drum loops. The synthetic drums are often the most difficult element to get right in a song's backing track. The reason: They must suit the song's purpose  and  be completely unique in tone and character. Dance music being, well, everywhere, the bar has been raised for rhythms because the tired ones are embarassingly obvious (hinting at laziness on the producer or programmer's part.) But the great ones - here I'll cite Telefon Tel Aviv, a current hypefactor favorite - stick in your head as much as a shimmering guitar hook.  The time-consuming editing process is a significant departure from The Distracted Lover sessions at Sauna (my old apartment on Water Street at the Fulton Fish Market.) When F.J. and I met after pre-production in June 2001 to share our material, the arrangements of the five songs we chose to record changed very little during the next year. As a result, we only recorded what was needed - there was almost nothing in the way of extraneous takes or arrangement concepts. This time around, however, neither of us brought finished songs to the table at the start of the recording process. The six embryonic songs with which we are working emerged from hours of jamming in the studio, all of which was recorded direct to disk. As a result, a single song may have hundreds of takes and structural ideas associated with it, all of which will be picked through at some point.  I have more to tell about Monday night's session, but I'll post about that after my flight and a belated Bastille Day celebration in Chicago. And for you squeamish types who never tried steak tartare, get over it!

      Guess, what? Today, I was invited to come play on my solo record. How cool is that? I get a call from Ash telling me he's going into the studio to work on my album and I'm more than welcome to come. Jesus, ok. Thanks for the invite (I mean that in good fun).  As I type, Ash and Brandt are working on guitar parts for our more Cerati sounding track. Ash is giving us those dreamy e-bows that I love and Brandt is....Marring the song up a bit, if you know what I mean. I wanted this to be a rocker, but they are pulling it into a very cool direction.   I, having recorded my bass and guitar parts for this particular tune, get to stare at some wrestling while listening to the lads record. The last time I did something similar, the song "J-BAR" was written, so I am going with the flow. And the flow is quite good.  An updated version of www.hypefactor.com is up and running. Check it out.  S.O. and I had lunch with the legendary Paris Trout today. Paris is an ace Chicago soundman, road manager and basic jack of all trades. I first met him when he was an engineer on the aggression's FLOOD album, and he has since moved on to be an in-demand soundguy. Whenever he is in town, he makes a call and we hook up for a bite or a drink. I can't tell you how enjoyable his company he is. He's a great guy and I'm always happy to spend time with him. We urged him to get the Year of the Rabbit album, which is out tomorrow, and has been in constant rotation at MOGworld for a few days now. GET IT.  I'm happy to report that PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN does not suck. it's good clean fun. Gore Verbinski, who also directed THE RING, is quickly becoming one of America's best mainstream directors. Hell of a director.  The world of Chemlab is quiet today.   The MOGpac reunion at the German Beerfest this weekend was very enjoyable and it was good to see the entire crew make it out (big ups to The Kidd for making it for a bit despite his bowel problems). Though I came home smelling like a homeless man, it was good to get the Pac gather on one big park bench at the retirement home to drink pitches of beer .  Happy Bastile Day, and don't think we didn't have dinner at Les Halles tonight, cause we DID. mmmmmmm.  F

      The Chemlab artwork continues to shape up into something very special. It's been a big thumbs up all around. You'll see soon!  In the meantime, more rough mixes arrive. This morning, via IM, Jamie and I review and discuss. We're on the same page, which is good. Because of the time difference, Jared will respond later. Almost there. Meanwhile, Jason's father in law, Russ, who is an excellent songwriter and a dynamic guitar player, came in to Cracknation to play over a Chemlab song called "Force Quit". He laid down a KILLER guitar solo that takes the song up to a new level. Russ comes from that Lennon/McCartney school of songwriting and guitar playing and he understands the ins and outs of a song. The stuff he plays swerves through this song like a bird. Well done and kudos to Jason for bringing Russ in.  A rough version of www.hypefactor.com is back up and running. I have some new designs for it that should hopefully go up soon as well. Brandt should be appearing on here soon to give more perspective to all things Hype.  I refuse to discuss my utter dislike for THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN. Anna Poontang is responsible, though I would have seen the movie eventually. I'm dying to see PIRATES. Hopefully I won't be disappointed.  Back to the mixes and then a mogpac reunion..at a retirement home. ;-)  F

      Well the guest stars SHINED last night, even though Ash forced us to record in the dark.   Ash, of course, comes armed to the hilt with gear and Robin shows up being Robin, so you know it's going to be a fun evening. My only demand as "boss" is that we lay down Robin's fingerpicking piece that I have been in love with. Other than that, it's free reign for anyone to do whatever they want. Ash JUMPS for the bass guitar. I'm not kidding when I say JUMP.  So you put all these rockers in a room and what do you get? Soundtrack music!! moody, atmospheric soundtrack music.  We wrote two songs, both of which sound like music for film, something I have been aching to do for sometime, but never really pursued. Ash's current obession is the bass guitar and his attention to it SHOWS, as he lends a unique rythmn to the material, which leaves me free to indulge in my Peter Hook fantasies, but at a new and subdued level. Robin is a master of the acoustic. Her fingerpicking piece, now titled "They've Just...", is excellent. Brandt and I stared at each other a few times, knowing that we had something, new, special, different and excellent to add to HF2. When Ash is telling me to record strings, you know we're on a roll. I forgot how fun it was to sit in a room with a bunch of friends and just create music. And it helps that the music is amazing!  Hopefully, this will be JUST the first round with these two...  Chemlab artwork is rolling in and is MASSIVE. Like an idiot I first hated the cover image, wrote Jared to say so, and then an hour later I was in love with it and feeling like an idiot. Anyway, it fits the album perfectly and the guy doing this, Mike, at Burnlab is solid. The contributor to this album and the fan in me both now want this album DONE so I can just hold it and play it for my friends. I'm dying to give a copy of the Chemlab to the kidd and yes, even Mark Mohtashemi.  F  PS: Big ups to the Great Grendali for his hard earned SMACKDOWN 2 Ladder Match victory of the The Legend yesterday. It will go down in history as one of the all time great matches!

      Hypefactor day 3: Reviewed B's guitar work since the last session. SOLID. Because of new additions to songs, I had to go back and change or improve upon some of my previously recorded basslines. Started a new tune that now takes us into the Cerati territory I have been hoping to go into. There is a nice groove to this one and a great light synth line that meshes well with the live instruments. Makes you bop yer head as it goes along. Finally got my hands on a guitar instead of a bass for a change to write some leads. Had been dying to do that since THE MOTIVE. Great Wall was eaten. We have six songs in the hopper now. Tomorrow the guest stars arrive.  I just realized you might not know who Cerati is. Go NOW to www.cerati.com. The man is a genius and an inspiration. Check him out. NOW. You'll thank me.  Chemlab artwork decisions to be made this weekend. I'm excited to see the options. The artwork is being done by a guy named Michael who has an excellent website www.burnlab.com (no relation to Chemlab). In the meantime, the conversations now turn to tracklistings and where to place the sutures. The Deadline might get pushed a week to make sure everything is perfect. I think thats a VERY wise idea.  S.O. has just made me tea. Sweet girl!  F

      Jamie Duffy calls tonight to discuss Chemlab. In the almost decade I have known him, I don't recall him this excited about a project. He and I are rivet geeks to the end. We share that bond. I know. Needless to say the new mixes are coming from his twisted brain and deft hands, so my cup of tea is hoisted in his honour for a job well-done...(so far. the record ain't done yet).  Today, i see the first print ad for Chemlab in Outburn. This shit is REAL now. Also in this issue is an ad for the aggression and Hypefactor. I'm sure it will take the label the same amount of time to figure out that Hypefactor is one word as they did realizing the Kidd is my younger brother. rrr  Ash calls tonight to discuss Hypefactor. Ash, along with the in-demand Ms. Emmet, will bring much to the table this week. He updates me on Ass Cobra. I update him on HF and Chemlab. We express our mutual excitement for the Cerati gig on the 30th. I predict some great music to come out of the aggression's "Power Station/Arcadia" phase.   Matt Gentile posts the first non-F.J. blog entry. THANKS. Matt is correct, I did in fact throw a temper tantrum regarding a new STAR WARS video game, which is NOT for PS2, but for the dreaded X-BOX (christened by me that very night as a "F**K BOX). Matt and his lovely underage girlfriend invite me to drink beer with them and old German people this weekend.  Brandt IM's to say "I'm laying guitars down for you bitch". Now THAT is progress.  Matrix's remix of the aggression song "THE LION's DEN" gets airplay on CYBERAGE RADIO (http://www.cyberage.cx). Very exciting.  S.O. goes out for the evening with the ladies. I stare at the Episode 3 WebCam. I watched them do makeup tests for Kit Fisto. You have no clue who that is, right? Oh I do! I love having a 5 year old cousin who, like me, has an encyclopedic knowledge of all things STAR WARS.  Back to the studio for tomorrow for HF Day 3.  F

      This recent trend of exclusivity among game producers is REALLY beginning to irk me.  I own a GameCube and an XBOX - why?  because certain games come out on certain platforms.  Owning the GC is key, however, because more obscure titles have been released (like Eternal Darkness) that are brilliantly fun and very challenging - it's not the juvenile machine most non-believers think it is (besides, how juvenile is the next Rogue Squadron).  My good friend and fellow gamer FJ (PS2 owner, btw) and I enjoyed an evening last night filled with professional wrestling and a couple of S.O.'s and one G.  Aside from a good match or promo or two, the highlight was watching the game ads and wondering which platform it was going to be on.  the first was the aforementioned "SW - Rogue Squadron" - exclusive to GC;  the next was "WM XIX" - exclusive to GC.  The third was more exciting: "SW - The Knights of the Old Republic".  The suspence was near painful...XBOX.  FJ then let out a few unmentionables as he relayed his disgust with the platform exclusivity that is over taking the gaming world.  We then got a few kicks because the red neck trucker game is available for all platforms - FJ was happy to see he got something.  I send this plea out to the game companies and developers of the world...have a heart.  don't make us spend more money than we can already afford to go out and buy the latest gear just to play ONE or TWO games.  Make it a level playing field for the consumer.  Don't be dicks.  M.

      In between the new Hypefactor sessions (and until the new aggression remixes come in), my musical attention turns to Chemlab. Granted, my role at this point is cheerleader (and sounding board for Jared), but the focus is still on the music and giving my input towards making this the best possible Chemlab is a major priority. Being asked to work on this album has been like getting called up to the Majors after being in the Minor Leagues for a decade. Like Bull Durham (maybe). So I feel some pressure and I know, as my S.O. will attest, that this pressure is totally self-inflicted.   The newest round of Chem-mixes came my way today and the progress is shockingly good. I’m so impressed by what is coming out of Chicago. The Cracknation crew, as producers, have really stepped up to what could be their best produced album to date (The last ILC record being my favorite thus far). As a musician who has written and performed on the record, I am happy with the results. Also, I am satisfied that these songs and sutures appeal to the massive Chemlab fan I have been for most of my adult life.  Chemlab has a unique fanbase, and my concern is that regardless of how good the album is (and it’s REALLLLLLY good), the “kids” (as we call them) will still find fault with it because certain people are not involved or it doesn’t sound like 1994, etc. I’m shocked sometimes how hardcore fans of bands cannot accept musical evolution. I like evolution. I’m one of those people who likes Depeche Mode’s SONGS OF FAITH AND DEVOTION more than MUSIC FOR THE MASSES and U2’s ACHTUNG BABY more than THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE (Robin will kill me for saying that). Growth is fun when it works like it did with those two Flood-Produced albums. Love and Rockets went dance, and went crap. The open-minded will love the new Chemlab. The fools stuck in 1994 can never ever be pleased.  F

      The first round of Hypefactor guest stars have been contacted and have agreed to pop into the studio this week to bring their unique stylings to the table. Knowing these first two guest stars quite very well and knowing what they are capable of, I'm psyched and honoured to have them come in. I stopped into the studio today to handle some Chemlab stuff (nothing major, just a few things Jared asked me to put together), and of course I had to pause to listen to this weekends musical results. I'm jazzed. Completely by fate and fate alone, my cameo at the studio today coincided with a delivery from Great Wall. An almost tearful reunion.  Going back and forth with the Chemcrew about the mixing and now the bullshit associated with releasing the album (i.e. artwork, credits, publishing, yadda yadda) begins. I heard the instrumental demo of a song called ATOMIC AUTOMATIC and I'm particularly pleased with how it's sounding. VERY Chemlab, very heavy, very nasty. mmmm. Jason sent me an update from the CrackStudio to tell me Mr. Duffy's dirty little paws have gotten a hold of some of these songs. I don't think anything pleases me more than a motivated Jamie Duffy. As this record develops, my confidence in the production team grows. Chemlab is in good hands.  And to top off the evening, I just found out that 88.7 WRSU FM, New Brunswick, NJ radio is spinning the track INFRINGEMENT from the Hypefactor EP. Nice!  Should be a busy week. Lots of studio time planned. Maybe someone from the MOGpac will write as well ;-)  F

      Day 2 of the new Hypefactor sessions were again productive and successful. The rocker I mentioned yesterday has developed nicely. It now has a hard chorus and some sweet wah wah guitars. Upon reviewing the material so far, which is now up to 5 songs worth, I'm noticing a Joy Division undertone to it. Not in an obvious way, like say, with Interpol, but more  in modern context. At the end of the day, we pinpointed what additions are going to be needed for these songs, and that is mostly some guitar work. Once that is done, hopefully before my next LA jaunt this month, I will then take the songs and begin arranging. While thinking ahead, I realize that we need to quicken the pace with the second batch of songs. I want it to move a bit faster in places. But this is all embryonic, but the melodies are strong and so far it's a real big step forward. It was fun just sitting there reading NME while saying "yes" or "no" to potential drum loops. Rough, innit?  I am sickened by the news reports of terrorism at a rock festival in Moscow. I think it's no secret that MOGpac is very pro-Russia and the thought of such violence in that part of the world, especially after having just played there, effects all of us. The fact that this was an act of violence against kids at a rock concert makes this even worse.  The day ended with G and I checking out TERMINATOR 3. I was shocked at how intentionally goofy it was. Arnold is given tons of one-liners, and most are quite funny, but it takes you right out of the drama. Its hard to take seriously. It's also Cameron By Numbers. It's entertaining, but it doesn't really add anything new to that universe. The Birdinator (as I call her), is just a normal hot blonde. Nothing special, so you never accept her as a threat. I see birds like this in LA all the time. When they introduced Robert Patrick in T2, he was unusual looking and you never saw these FX before. Now its just some actress and the same FX. They needed to find an otherworldly knockout who looks like no one else, sorta like Angelina Jolie when you first saw her. The one positive was that the guy who plays John Connor, who I believe is Nick Stahl, is a million times better than that crackhead Ed Furlong, who I doubt could have carried this movie the way Stahl does. The movie was fun for sure, but Cameron ain't losing any sleep.  Though I am. Back to the Lab tomorrow. I think.  F

      Since yesterday was Day 1 for the new Hypefactor material, I've decided to keep an ongoing journal about this record so a year from now I can look back and see what this album eventually started as and how much it either changed or stayed on course. Plus I want to see how scattered my brain really is when it comes to doing what I love the most, which is making music.   Day 1 was very productive. Surprisingly actually. It was very casual and the ideas were flowing. The first Hypefactor record started from songs that either Brandt or myself had already written and we would play over what already existed. This time it was starting totally from scratch usually from a simple 4 measure drum or synth loop. Already the sound is different. We've got four tracks in embryonic form and they seem darker, a little depressing, though the last song we started working on was a rocker. I'm interested in seeing that one come together.   Having not written on my own (i.e. not in a band atmosphere or with a producer riding me) in quite some time, it was a pleasure to just sit and play bass. I had spent the last year or so either just doing remixes, writing for Chemlab, or writing with the aggression in the rehearsal space (where Ocionic and Wedding Song were born), so I wasn't sure if I could immediately get back into the swing of writing for myself. However, I was more than ready and never really stopped for a second (other than the customary Wendy's break. thats when you KNOW I'm in the zone). I think it was the same thing for Brandt, who is a lot quicker of an engineer these days. I was jumping from bass to keyboards like a kid who needs ritalin and he kept up withour losing a beat.  Today is day two. I'd like to think we can pump out maybe 2 more. Once we have about 6 ideas down,  I want to start bringing people in to add over this stuff. I hear things and I'll say "this needs (insert name here)" Last time, we didn't do the guest star thing till later in the process. This time, I want people to be in the early stages to help shape the songs. At the same time, I would like to have different people come in trigger a few new ideas. For example, Robin has guitar piece I want to lay down and Ash has an ambient piece I fell in love in when I accidentally downloaded it off his hotline account. I hope to bring in some non Mogpackers as well some OLD schoolers. We shall see.  The other benefit to this is that the studio is down in my old seaport neighborhood, so I am looking forward to my reuniting with the greatest Chinese take out of all time, Great Wall. A wonderful thing indeed.  More after day 2!  F

      It's a national holiday. Everyone is travelling or bbq'ing or taking it easy. Of course, I will have none of that as I am literally packing up the bass to get started on the new round of Hypefactor songs. Should be fun and interesting.  Chemlab update: First from Chicago: Vocals are done and the album is officially in the mixing stage now. I think Mr. Duffy has gotten his hands on a few of the tunes so you KNOW good things are happening. From NY: I spent a few hours at Brandt's studio yesterday going through a cassette tape that Jared gave to me containing two full sides of old Chemlab demos from their East Side Sessions. There is so much incredible stuff on this mother. I immediately wrote Jared a threatening letter that we eventually had to go back to some of the songs that never saw the light cause there is a ton of good ideas on this that were never completed. Man, gimme some of the drugs they were on back then making this awesome music!  As usual, I have gone out and bought far too many discs lately. Everything from new Ogre (really good), Hate Dept (snooze), Type O Negative (a good return to form). But nothing and i mean NOTHING beats the long awaited live album from Primal Scream, called "Live in Japan". This Japanese only release is without a doubt one of the best live albums I have ever heard and I can't stop listening to it. if you are even remotely a fan, this is worth seeking out. As a hardcore fan of this band, I am blown away. I saw them earlier this year and loved it, but this disc surpasses that by a million times. It's one of those rare albums that makes you wanna go and be in a band. Incredible.  In other incredible news, the GENIUS that is Gustavo Cerati is doing a rare tour of the United States this month. To say there are happy faces in the MOGcamp would be an understatement. I'm seeing him in LA as well. DONT MISS HIM. What a trip to LA this is gonna be: the reunited Duran Duran, The San Diego Comic Con, Raw at Staples center (thanks AL), and Cerati, plus Brad Cramps bachelor party. oh yeah, I will work too ;-)  Have a good, safe holiday, kids.

      Spent the bulk of the working on two things:  1. The new HF track SOLAR (now jokingly called SOLARIS in my computer). Took a long time to get into this track because I wasn't familiar with a lot of the tracks (mostly Summer Douche's 200 guitar tracks) and I needed to sit and listen to Ash's loops which are REALLY cool. I would say I spent a good 8 hours on this one. My initial version was over 8 minutes long, but as of this moment it's just under 6. I'm going to sleep on it and then decide if any more changes are needed. Then we'll commit it to mp3 and pass it out to the Factor Corp for further development. This song cries for the vocals of Peter Face.  2. Chemlab art and other business things pertaining to OXIDIZER, it's follow up, and a new F.J./Jared collaboration that I hope becomes the project I do after HF2. I have been quiet about Chemlab as of late, mostly because it's now just a matter of waiting for the record to come out. There is a lot of activity behind the scenes. I'll learn more perhaps when I'm in Chicago this weekend for Bradley J. Fox's wedding (S.O. and I are stopping at Crack Central to see the "family" on Friday night)  I am obsessed with the MTV show NEWLYWEDS. That Jessica Simpson is a nightmare.  I just turned 31 years old as I wrote this. Blog Blog Blog.  F

      We ventured to Brooklyn last night to check out the Sigur Ros/Bjork show. First off, I am a dead sucker for anything in Coney Island as I spent a lot of good times there as a kid. Of course we had to get us some Nathan's Hot Dogs. I hadn't been to the Coney since I beat the poo out of John Darryl Sparks on the beach during the recording of ALTAMONT, so that's quite a ways back. For the record, I'm not a violent man, but Sparky provoked said beating and Former Aggression Vocalist Turned Important Screenwriter cheered me on approvingly (and HE later smacked around John Darryl Sparks for worse than I ever did. Again, provoked)  So we got to the baseball field just in time to watch Sugar Rolls. I don't think it's any secret that I am not the biggest fan of this band, but I am loyal to Iceland so I decided to give it my full attention. Over the years, there have been several cases in which a band I didn't like on record totally won me over live. Fortunately, I am happy to say that this was the case with Super Ross. I totally understood after the first song why people liked them. First off, their musicianship is stunning. The arrangements are bizarre and the approach to performance is unique. Anything goes with these guys, and they have an amazing string quartet to that adds tons of emotions to the songs. And that's just what this band is, pure emotion. The singer is a beast who is able to bring these songs over the top. The songs build and build, oftentimes to a beautiful climax. Anyway, really good stuff. I was very very impressed and happy to be proven wrong.  For some reason, I have never been able to connect with Bjork. I have always appreciated her and her work, but I never went out of my way to get her albums, nor have I ever seen her live (I think I saw the Sugarcubes once), so I welcomed this opportunity to see her in action. Again, like her opening act Salmon Roe, I was really impressed, especially with the set up that included a string section, a harpist and guys with laptops (I think, it was hard to see from where we were). I cannot believe that voice comes out of that midget. Again, the emotion of the songs was intense and the occasional pyro and firework helped punctuate some of the big moments (wonder what Ash thought of those!). The bulk of the set consiseted of very dramatic songs focusing on the strings with broken beats (am i right, Ash?) Towards then end, they broke out the dance beats and really got the crowd really hopping. I would like to have seen a more diverse set, combining the dance and the dramatic songs throughout, but honestly, it's a minor complaint. Time flew quick and now I can understand why Bjork is such a phenom (as we say in wresting). My only other complaint are the hipster morons who were at this gig. I would not be surprised if Ash killed someone, cause I was that close. Hipsters need to GO, despite my girlfriends enjoyment of making fun of them (I can't blame her).  This show honestly should have been like in Carnegie Hall or something, not a baseball field in Brooklyn.  But Icelanders and Hot Dogs are a solid mix!  F

      One thing I forgot to mention in today's post: For some time now, F.J. has been clamoring for a song on the record that embraces the vibe of Gustavo Cerati's " urlLink Artefacto ." I've had a riff kicking around for some time, and while working on it today I think I found what he is looking for. More on this in the next two weeks...

      As of 5 p.m. today - Saturday - there are enough guitars on "Solar" to injure a small animal. So much for minimal.  Honestly, though, I could not help myself. The track captured my imagination right off that bat in a way that few do. It has a slow, funky shuffle - " urlLink When The Levee Breaks " meets " urlLink A Northern Soul "-era Verve - that lends itself to all kinds of psychadelic jamming. I layered echo-drenched 12-string parts, harmonized e-bows, wah-wah'ed funk lines. Had I the time or money for  urlLink draw , this would be the track to which I would smoke.  I even added an extended track of  urlLink theremin , which previously made an appearance on the " urlLink Theme From J-Bar ."  Now poor F.J.'s job is to sort out the twentysomething tracks of instrumentation. My realistic expectation is that half of what I recorded will be wildly altered or removed altogether, but that is OK. While I enjoy jamming and layering parts on these songs, ultimately everyone on this record subscribes to a "song first" mentality. In other words, if the part does not work for the song, it goes. Plain and simple.  This working method also happens to be F.J.'s strong point as an arranger. I have never known him to discard a part that helped a song, and at this point in our long working relationship, I have the utmost trust in his discriminating ear. If something gets cut, it happens for a reason.  The process of arranging and cutting is also eased by the fact that there is little to no ego about individual parts among the members of this project. In all my time working on hypefactor, I have never known someone to piss and moan about  their  part being cut from a song. Well, there was that one time that all of F.J.'s bass parts were removed, and he went on a bender that ended with him capsizing his sailboat during the  urlLink Fastnet  race. But that's another story altogether...  Speaking of guitar parts, on Thursday night Ash played some sweet parts on a  urlLink Gibson ES-330  in between bouts of programming. His playing really stands out, and he clearly has an instinctive ear for a good hook. Like me and  urlLink Johnny Marr , Ash takes many of his cues from  urlLink The Cure's Robert Smith , a fine guitarist who has never quite received his due as a player from  urlLink the rock elite . Perhaps it was the  urlLink hair ?

      I had chosen not to post about last nights session as I felt Brandt captured it almost perfectly. Almost. What he states below about my "directive" to keep the new song "minimal" is in fact, 150% incorrect. If you read below, my intent with the song, and I remain quite clear on this point, is that the GUITAR playing in the song should be minimal, not the song itself. I feel the key to this song is to keep the amount of guitar tracks down to a minimum. if anything, if I had wanted to keep the song "minimal", the last person I would allow near the song is Ash. Anyway, I would like to reiterate that Ash was a freaking CHAMP last night and my "let it flow" approach to producing this track brought out the best in these two chumps. If I thought something sucked or I had a better idea, you KNOW they would have heard from me. (Of course you know, fucking Brandt has 200 guitar tracks now thinking in his underage brain that the "minimal" thing is out the door. Just wait till I arrage this sucker.)  And yes, watching Ash watch the monster Brock Lesnar beat the living hell out of the one-legged Zack Gowen was priceless.   In other news, I finally defeated the PS2 INDIANA JONES AND THE EMPEROR'S TOMB. Overall, I loved the game, though I didn't love all the supernatural shit at the end. However, that is applicable to the franchise and the makers of the game are to be commended for another great game that was totally worth the price of admission (thanks to the former high school classmate turned college roommate turned comic book expert buddy). Former high school classmate turned college roommate turned comic book expert buddy has shown me a preview of the upcoming BATMAN game, but before that, I think STARSKY AND HUTCH is going to be the  next big addiction, or most certainly the new SMACKDOWN game.  The big letdown of the week comes from my hero Jackie Chan who, with THE MEDALLION has single handedly killed the "Jackie Chan Genre" by going against everything that made it great. The film is horrible and sends the asian action film back 20 years thanks to the utter disregard for EVERYTHING that makes Jackie Chan films great. Shame on you Jackie, Sammo and director Gordon Chan.  F

      F.J., Ash and I had an extremely productive evening in the studio yesterday, and all four or five hours of the session were dedicated to the recently-unearthed "Solar."  If you read or recall my belated post yesterday, I was quite apprehensive about this session because of F.J.'s directive to keep the song very minimal. While I am a fan of minimal recordings, I am not a fan of recording minimally. I like  records that use many layers to sound mammoth — the whole greater than the sum method of production — and also those recordings that are multi-layered but are mixed in a way that emphasizes sparseness and empty space. I knew my natural inclination to take up 13 or 14 tracks with guitars alone was going to create problems on this song.  Well "minimalism" promptly went out the window yesterday, and we have Ash to thank for it. While F.J. watched  urlLink a one-legged wrestler  get the crap kicked out of him on national television, I cued up the track for Ash and he pulled up his  urlLink loop library . It should be noted that the man is a connoisseur of electronic sounds as well as a fastidious producer. His taste in programming - rhythm programming in particular - calls for an obscene amount of creativity on the artist's part, and his own work always exceeds these high standards.  As he plowed through loop after loop, we knew we had something good going on. The track's density grew exponentially in the next two hours, with Ash adding everything from funky rhythms to a brilliant synth line that is similar in tone to NewOrder's introduction to " urlLink Crystal ." Midway through his computer-based jam session, I picked up a guitar and started jamming along to his wall of rhythms. It was like having a live drummer in the room. I quickly worked out five or six parts for the verse and chorus, and F.J., like a wise producer, sat back and let it happen. The tune really came together for me last night, and Ash's rhythmic instincts and F.J.'s hands-off production technique were the elements that allowed it to happen. All around, a brilliant evening.  I was quite elated today to find  urlLink "The Distracted Lover" listed on Amazon.com . While this is far from earth-shattering, I am extremely gratified that the CD is available so easily. Both F.J. and I have some rather esoteric musical interests, and we are all too familiar with the arduous process of tracking down records by bands with little to no distribution and promotion. Now if some kid listening to college radio in Trenton hears "The Sweetest Soul," he won't need to jump through hoops to track us down. Nice work,  urlLink Tinman .  Less than one week until  urlLink Duran at Webster Hall . in the meantime, F.J. and I were browsing eBay for  urlLink Power Station tour jackets ...

      For weeks, if not the entirety of the hypefactor sessions thus far, F.J. repeatedly insisted that he recorded a moody piano part for a song dubbed "Exist," one of four or so that are quite well-developed at this point. The issue came up every time we listened to monitor mixes in the studio, and F. never hesitated to make a snide comment about my having deleted this brilliant part from the song, thereby ruining the entire album.  And for as many weeks, I insisted this was a load of bollocks. "Exist" emerged from a demo of a song I attempted with another band about seven years ago that I modified drastically in August 2000. I have a lot of pride invested in the track, and I knew there was no way I would have lost a part for this song were it as amazing as F.J. recalled.  Well, I was wrong. But only about 40 percent wrong.  While sorting through files on the computer before my trip to Chicago last week, I came across a Cubase file called "Stay" that I thought was nothing more than a drum loop I programmed last summer. Again, I was only partially wrong. It was indeed a galloping drum loop I wrote the summer before, inspired by the vintage techno of the  urlLink NewOrder-Chemical Brothers collaboration  "Here To Stay." But I had forgotten about the fact that, during our first or second session of the summer, F.J. and I slowed it down to about 90 b.p.m. He added bass... and piano.  Shit.  To say F.J. was pleased would be a slight understatement. He is right - the riff was pretty good, and we built on it last night by adding some synth parts and guitars. I was told that Pink Floyd was my inspiration, and we also worked out a chorus riff that hugged the minor key piano and bass parts nicely.  I know already that the track will be a struggle to complete. My natural instinct as a guitarist and producer is to take a  urlLink Phil Spector  "Wall Of Sound" approach to recording, and I will have to resist the impulse to layer guitar upon guitar and effect upon effect with this track.    I am sure that F.J. would rather he told this story first, but I beat him to the punch. But the way I see it, he has me to thank for the fact that we found the song in the first place. Of course, I am also the one who " lost " the track all those weeks ago. But normally he would have been up at 8 or 9 a.m. writing this. Too much " urlLink Grand Theft Auto: Vice City " the night before, perhaps?  Pick up the slack, F!

      Dropped into the studio last night. Had no agenda really, I thought originally we were going to have Robin and Ash in there, but both bailed.  Speaking of Ash, he handed in a rough draft of THEME FROM PROPAGANDA and I am quite happy with the results. I think it’s off to a really solid start and has achieved what I was hoping to have on this album, a good house track to serve as the centerpiece. Besides some minor mix notes as well as a few structure ideas, this track is well on its way. It was a perfect first track to listen to in my new Ipod (THANKS IRENE!)  Anyhow, got to the studio and Brandt unearthed a track we started last month in the initial sessions and then somehow was forgotten. It consisted of a drum loop, enough basslines for a verse and a chorus and my long lost piano that I thought I had done in the song EXIST. I had been ranting and raving for the first month of this album that I had done piano somewhere and it was lost. Needless to say, it was nice to be justified that I am not crazy and we now have our eighth song for HF2.  We re-recorded some of the bass that I wasn’t 100% on and then I threw down some sci-fi strings that Ash will hate. Brandt played some sweet guitars, and I tried to steer him toward a “less is more” approach to this song. the results were akin to David Gilmour meeting Richard Ashcroft. Atmosphere is the name of the game for this tune, which now has the working title of SOLAR.  We’re back in the studio tonight, hopefully joined by ash and possibly Young Oscar Hess aka The Kidd. He’ll be the first person outside of the core four to hear the work in progress. As evidenced by his work on FLOOD and THE DISTRACTED LOVER, the Kidd is the person you want to have come in and give you a fresh perspective  on the material. Besides being my alleged younger sibiling, he is the only man I know besides me who has seen Marisa Tomei’s boobs in person. It’s a unique bond to share. I hope he makes it.  Had a long catch up session with original MOG member and former aggressioner Chris Link, who is impressed I have several of his F-11 songs in my Ipod. Link is a talented musician who I learned tons from in my formative years. Also, he got me into stuff like John Cale, Lou Reed and other cool stuff when we were young at NYU and I am forever in his debt (though I got him into Nick Cave!). I have invited Link to get in on HF2 while we are still writing. I’ll see him in Chicago next week and we will discuss further.  Further to an entry below, after tons of Duran Duran fans crashed the ticketmaster server during the internet pre-sale, I got crazy lucky and was able to purchase tickets to see the Durans at Webster Hall on my birthday next week. Normally I would brag about this and poke fun at my comrades who didn’t get tickets, but I got VERY VERY lucky and without Matt Gentile telling me the tickets were back up, I’d be watching THE MEDALLION on my 31st birthday. VERY VERY VERY lucky. Fate maybe.  F

      Post blackout, Danny Boy, S.O. and I braved the hipster nightmare that is Piano’s to check out the glam man known as Saphin. First a little back story: A few years ago, while killing time at Luna Lounge, Danny Boy, Tom (excuse me, THOMAS), and I stumbled across a band playing what sounded like the soundtrack to VELVET GOLDMINE (The best soundtrack for the worst movie). Intrigued, we watched their entire set. The singer, who is Saphin (nee Jeff Saphin or JEFF) had the best elements of Ziggy-Era Bowie (including costume changes and a dressing room “tent”) and the band itself was INCREDIBLE. They had a guitar player who out-Bauhuas-ed Daniel Ash, a drummer who looked like he belonged in 25 Ta Life and a bassist who could best be described as an Israeli New Romantic. And this worked!!! And of course, they looked fantastic, so totally different, yet it all fit. This was one of those special bands in which you knew that if one element was different, it would flat-out suck. Together, these guys rivaled any major label band out there. Glam is a delicate beast to do properly and these guys tamed it and in my humble opinion, modernized it. Danny Boy was even E-mailing Saphin to make sure they would play their now classic I’M NOT GAY. Let me tell you, you have to be an amazing band to get someone like Ash to listen to songs like SEX IN THE NAME OF GOD and DAYGLO HALO. Nuff Said. They, like Saintface, became the band to see, and we were all huge fans.   And then, at one gig, JEFF announced “he” was going away to record an album and would be taking some time off. We were sad, but we couldn’t fault him (hopefully them) for wanting to make a record, at least now we could have the songs on CD! Plus, you could always surf their site, where you can learn all about JEFF, but really none of the other guys, which was annoying. Brandt ran into the guitarist, Evan Evangilista, one day in a train station and he ran away when approached. Then Evan started showing up in a band called Essex. Not a good sign…  Well, who knows what happened in between, because they did the record, and it was mediocre (and a total rip off, ask Matt Gentile, who, like me paid something like 30 bucks for a cd-r of this album). I don’t know if JEFF fired the rhythm section of they walked or what have you, its not my place to speculate as I don’t know the circumstances, but the record reflected none of that wonderful band we followed around for a year or so. Like Saintface, the frontman is the main driving force, but unlike Saintface, the band was made the frontman a star. No offense to my friends in Saintface, but the Saphin band had a unique chemistry straight off the bat that was tight and fierce. The songs were GOOD, but GREAT when that band played them. Saintface luckily has great songs (and not enough on CD, PETER!).  Then JEFF started playing again, but acoustically, which I didn’t go see as I am loyal to that band, then new band members started appearing on the website, and I wrote them off immediately. Then the decision was made to check out the all-new live band JEFF had assembled on Saturday night…It started off promisingly enough, as Saphin, in orange jumpsuit, went into the crowd offering people chips. And then the band played…  Well, S.O. didn’t make it through the first few songs, and quite Frankly, I couldn’t blame her. JEFF has a really good keyboard player (who actually adds to the material), a really decent guitarist, and a solid drummer, but that’s the problem. They’re all individually solid, but they are NOT Saphin. And to add insult to injury, Evan Evangelista was playing BASS. What the hell is that? It’s like Mick Ronson playing bass for Bowie. You don’t want the great guitar player who defined these songs playing BASS!!! UGH. The new guitar player lacks the style and substance of Evan. He is a power chord guy, and he can rock out, but the point is, Saphin is not power chord rock. I want Evan, not some guy who looks like Matthew Lillard. The problem is, these guys are good, REALLY good, but they have to compare to the previous incarnation, which was magic. Maybe they will develop in time…though probably into something different, and not something I would find interesting.  And what can I say about JEFF. He was once a glammed up androgynous alien half-breed that exuded irony like none other. Now he just seems pissed and looks like he wants to be in Interpol. The sexy innuendo is replaced by angst and it doesn’t suit those songs at all. He did show some signs of life during I'M NOT GAY, but it was too brief. Honestly, he appears to be an egomaniac, and I hope he didn’t piss off the other band members or did something stupid like fire them cause then I would be REALLY pissed at JEFF.   The costume changes are there but the fun is gone. Are Essex any good?  F

      En route back to NY finally. Because this LA trip was so hastily put together, I flew out of Long Beach, which is a timewarp to the old tiny airports of the past. Think CATCH ME IF YOU CAN with high tech security and you get what I’m saying. Even had to walk out to the tarmac to get on the plane. LOVE that (see previous Iceland/UK 2001 photos). Flying Jet Blue for the first time. It’s quite humourous. They have Direct TV on the flight, with about 15 channels. Of course one of them has to be VH1 Classics and I am immediately drawn to the Power Station’s SOME LIKE IT HOT. Speaking of which…  I’m obviously doing something right as the Durans have decided to play a club show at Webster Hall, which is 7 blocks away from us. And when are they playing? August 27th, my birthday. Now all I need are tickets.  Agent/Lawyer/Advisor and I went to check out 16 Volt the other night in LA. Well, we tried to. Because she was late to dinner, thus making me and former aggression vocalist turned important screenwriter wait forever to eat, we showed up at the venue at about 9:45. Eric Volt was kind of enough to guest list me, and his website and the ticketmaster site said “9pm” on it, so we expected to sit through some opening acts. At the door, the start times were listed and it read “16Volt 9:00-9:35” (or something like that). Um, WHAT? Who the hell actually performs on time on this planet and who makes tickets to a show available via ticketmaster for a band that is only going to play for 35 minutes? I can only assume this was a label showcase thing. So, sadly, no Volt. We then saw SWAT, which blows immensely. This was one of those days where you just couldn’t win. Two words: Los Angeles.  Some things l learned from the VH1 classics today. The 80’s BLOW and Madonna was a crap dancer. But Debbie Harry was AMAZING.  Ash has yet to deliver the mix of THEME FROM PROPAGANDA because of a pet related problem in his apartment. I am scared to ask for futher details, but the word “fleas” was used during a phone message. I spent a lot of time listening to the other current demos and remain quite happy.  I’m too tired and frazzled to think about anything other than being home, having a nice meal with the lovely S.O. and getting back into the PS2 Indiana Jones. I’ve missed some wrestling too. (it’s a shame that 20 minutes after I typed this, the power went out in the northeast, WHILE I was in the air…that’s a whole other story for another time)   F

      Saw Year of the Rabbit again with S.O. the other night at Mercury Lounge. We stood right at the front and just smiled the whole time. Put simply: they're GREAT and play excellent rock and roll. It was fun seeing them after having heard the whole album. They opened their set with a cover of The Cure's "PLAIN SONG". That right there earns my respect. Afterwards, it was a quick stop at the Pub to catch up with Pater and then an Indian meal with my agent/lawyer/advisor/houseguest. Yes, I ate Indian food. S.O. is trying to make me more diverse. It's working...  Well the long awaited package arrived from Cracknation containing the next two Cracknation releases: Acumen Nation's "LORD OF THE CYNICS" and a final yet unmastered version of the (extremely) long awaited and anticipated Chemlab album "OXIDIZER", which as you may have read, I worked on a bit ;-)  Here are my brief thoughts:  "CYNICS" is the best written and produced Acumen record to date. The whole key to this album is Jason wisely making the most out of his new rythmn section, Dan and Eliot, and writing with them as a band. Their welcomed presence is very obvious in the material and the album is more akin to the live Acumen experience than any previous album. Also, Jason is finally singing more (something I had been nudging him to do for some time) and his grasp of melody is fantastic. the songs are catchier than the last album and the last song, CAPSULE, is a fantastic and soulful tune. Production is Cracknation standard, meaning its aces. I look forward to getting further into the album.  "OXIDIZER" is tougher to review because of my closeness to it. I co-wrote some of it, did a lot of sounds for it, and have been extremely passionate and vocal about this record for a long time. i can't review it. I am in love with 90% of the album and the other 10% I like but that mostly has to do with certain choices that were made for the album that I don't agree with, but thats real nitpicky stuff (i.e. "oh i would turn the guitar up here" etc) and thats what happens in a band. 90% is a super figure. My curiosity about public reaction to the album is quite strong. I'm sure some fans will love it and others will not, and probably for the wrong reasons. They have to accept that this is 2003 and not 1995. This album is a full success and the hidden track on OXIDIZER will make the old schoolers happy!  Meanwhile...  Last night, S.O. and I saw the film SWIMMING POOL, which was quite good. I feel a certain member of the aggression, known for his love of the part of the female anatomy called the BOOBS, would like this movie, as it has a young woman running around without a top on quite a bit. Anyhow, I'm glad we saw this instead of SWAT.  Ash is in Boston visiting relatives, but informs Brandt that he will have an mp3 arrangement of "THEME FROM PROPAGANDA" for us late tonight or tomorrow. Brandt intends to have some rough versions of the other songs for me on MP3 before I head back to LA tomorrow night. Hopefully this will happen and I will have a lot to study on the plane. What a great solo album? I'm home packing for LA and playing the new INDIANA JONES video game on mp3 while everyone else works on the songs. HAH! winner.  Seeing Saintface tonight...more later maybe.  F

      I spent the bulk of Tuesday knocking another song into shape. I did some weird stuff with it, and basically what has come out of it is that we now have what we think is the album opener...  Last night, B, Ash and I gathered, mostly so Ash could hear the current arrangements and we could toss around idea for the next batch of tunes. Ash likes the arrangements, and everyone's comments are more "the song needs..." and less "I hate this" (In fact that never comes up). Concepts, thoughts, etc. are thrown back and forth. Ash is going to take the more acoustic oriented stuff and really mess around with them a bit. I created some atmospheric stuff for "THEY'VE JUST..." and he will clean that up and build from there. I am confident in what he will come up with.  From the discussions recently, it has been my intention to do a song that was more dance oriented. I'm not saying techno, but something that was more loop based, more groovy, etc. Cerati has an uncanny ability to make great dance music that doesn't seem out of place on a rock album and this is really inspiring, especially since my roots in music are electronic. When in Russia, the MOGpac spent an evening in a house club called Propaganda, which was very inspirational for Ash and got me more interested in trying music of that type (and now infamous as being the place where Danny Boy Hamill lost his coat check ticket, thus keeping us in the club till they closed one night). Anyway, I think doing something like this has been in the back of my head as well as Ash's for some time now.  So the three of us formulate a plan that would involve Ash bringing lots of his gear into the studio and we would sort of "jam" a song out electronically. However, this is put on hold when Ash plays a series of loops out of his laptop that B and I go mental for. Immediately we pick up guitar and bass and start to jam along. And what do you know, a few hours later we have tons of parts for a new song. Instead of using the studio computer that runs Cubase, we recorded straight from the mixer into Ash's laptop, where he is running the program LIVE, which he swears by and is excellent for this kind of music.   This song is now called "THEME FROM PROPAGANDA" and will probably end up as the centerpiece of the album. It's the 7th song written thus far and we were lucky that the stars were aligned last night and we wrote a VERY cool song. Ash is going to arrange it as he would one of his club tracks and I have a vague idea for a vocal melody that might work in an Underworld/"THESE MILLION NIGHTS" kind of way.  We left the studio quite jazzed. Ash also has come up with a GREAT idea for a guest vocal spot. I'll be getting on that invite right away.  Tomorrow, I should be writing about the final Chemlab mixes and the new Acumen album should they actually arrive (JASON!)  F

      Taking the streak even further, I cruised into the studio on Sunday to check on progress there. I played my new arrangements and received an enthusiastic thumbs up for the first four songs. B then played me some new guitar parts for a rocker called "Clean Up" (this is NOT the final title, I'm just sick of typing "the one where I play bass here and he plays guitar here", know what I mean?). I was dead into these guitars and demanded I'd be given the parts immediately to go arrange this tune. B complied and when trasnferring the songs from laptop to laptop, my powerbook takes ANOTHER DIVE!!!!!  Angry beyond belief, I dropped everything and ran to Apple. Got soaked in the rain as well. So I get to Apple and lo and behold all I did was hit one wrong button and everything was fine. But man was I pissed. But man was I happy to learn nothing was messed up and I was able to go spend a nice evening with S.O. and the nice people who raised me.  We have the agent/lawyer/advisor staying with us, but while she is off doing legal things and S.O. is working, I was able to arrange "Clean Up" and E it over to the studio, where B sang its praises. He would tell me if it was crap, so I am quite pleased.  Note that Hypefactor.com is now running with news and the "Making Of The Distracted Lover". Worthy reads. Pictures soon I think. I gotta get this beard on film, you know.  Ash and I talk via IM yesterday. He was messaging me from an airport in Florida, where he was able to wirelessly connect. How I don't know, cause i don't think it was via his cel phone. I am kinda scared of how he did that, yet I am impressed and ponder all the time I could save at LAX and Newark with that ability. Ash is into the HF2 material and we plot some new ideas based on things I have discussed previously with him and B. MP3's are exchanged for inspiration and reference. I am still scared of his ability to connect to the net in the airport...  I will try to maybe get to one more song today, if I feel it, and we might gather The HF Corp. this week to review what we have at this point and maybe work on new stuff.  Chemlab is being mastered this week by Dave Suycott of Machines of Loving Grace and Stabbing Westward. He's got some good ears on him, so I am confident the final product will sound massive. The label has the artwork and hopefully this will be in production quite soon. I can't wait to hear the final mixes! I'm sure you can't either...it's worth the wait!  F

      During my recent West Coast jaunt, I couldn't get focused on the HF2 material, mostly because the Chemlab mixes were rolling in and it was hard to switch gears. I've written music long enough to know not to force myself into doing anything or it's just gonna suck... I usually have to wait for the songs to call out to me...  Well, today I got that call and finally got my ass in gear. I started at 8am with the intention of doing the Audio Warfare remix, but the next time I looked, it was 3pm and I had arranged four HF2 songs. I'm REALLY happy with what I've put together. The bulk of the time was spent filtering through what's been played and picking out the best takes to use. Luckily, the talented people who have been playing on this record have given me a lot to choose from and work with.  I then went out for a stroll that ended up being several hours. I had to force myself to get something to eat, find out what's going on in the world, and listen to new CD purchases without distraction. Some of my time was spent with Peter Saintface, who I always have time for. We caught up on all things HF and SF. They are far along with the recording of their new EP, however, after their gig this coming weekend, Peter is off for 2 weeks in Paris. Poor guy ;-) Of course, the lightbulb went off in my head to steal some of his bandmates to come write with us while he is away. He likes that idea. When he returns, he's going to come into the studio to hear what we have.   I went back home and went at it a few more hours, mostly polishing what I had done today and starting the arragement for one more song. Unlike the old days, this would normally be declared as the final arrangements, but this stage is more for us to figure out what else is needed in each song and what we have to do to flesh everything out. It's a true work in progress. Also, I'm taking into account that live drums are going to go over these songs as well. Thank God I have an amazing drummer...  I might go into the studio to hear what Brandt has done with some of the guitars and to give him a feel for what progress I have made here at MOGworld. There's no deadline yet, so we can really take our time and do it right. This evening I finally explained to the label that Hypefactor is ONE word, not two. What a productive day!  Oh and I cooked too!  F

      After seeing a really good film called DIRTY PRETTY THINGS, starring Audrey "My eyes are bigger than your head" Tataou, the S.O. and popped into Kim's (her fave record store) for some late night CD shopping. Usually Kim's is a bit hipster for my taste, but last time we were there I found a flyer for the Cerati gig, so I thought maybe lightning would strike twice and I would discover something interesting. And sure enough i did, and I picked this up, which they had just gotten in:  "BE-MUSIC: COOL AS ICE: LTM are proud to present a compilation of stone classic old school 80's electro and dance cuts produced by Be Music, the tag used by all four members of New Order. The tracks were largely produced between 1983 and 1984 for release on Factory Records and Factory Benelux. Some tracks marked were co-produced by Be Music (Bernard Sumner) and DoJo (Donald Johnson, of A Certain Ratio). Nyam Nyam and the Be Music Theme were produced by Peter Hook, and Life and Thick Pigeon by Steve Morris and Gillian Gilbert. Several of the tracks, including Love Tempo, Looking From A Hilltop and Cool As Ice remain influential club classics, and have been extensively sampled and bootlegged. Several years before the great house explosion, with their own Hacienda club still empty every single night, yet way (too far?) ahead of their time, four guys and a girl from Manchester produced a whole bunch of pure sonic magic which made waves worldwide. The album has been digitally remastered and runs for 74 minutes. The set will be available both on CD and as a limited DJ friendly double vinyl set. The vinyl version will be limited to just 1000"  Well I'd be lying if I told I had ANY clue as to what the hell this was so I snagged it and am listening to it now. It sounds a bit dated, but is quite good and it all comes across as a testing ground for New Order's music around this time. There are tons of sounds and programming nuances that later appear in some of New Order's classic material from this period. It's all very electro, very 80's club friendly and very very influential. It's a fascinating document of a lost yet important period of a legendary band's career. Plus there is a cool tune at the end that Peter Hook did. Also, according to the liner notes, Johhny Marr makes an uncredited cameo on one the Sumner-produced songs, hence the early stages of Electronic!  However, this is for hardcore New Order fans or 80's club kids only. So keep that in mind...  Meanwhile, work continues on the HF website. The news section should be going up soon and we've written a very extensive "Making of THE DISTRACTED LOVER", similar to my "Making of FLOOD" over at the aggression site. I had to admit to slacking on the tunes a bit, but fear not, I'm getting back into the swing of things. Also, I have to start work on the Audio Warfare remix, and I'm happy to say, unlike most songs I remix, I quite like this tune and there is a lot of fun material in it to mess around with.  Jared is probably just back in London as I type. I don't know the results of the final day, but everything seemed to be going well. I think the artwork went into Caroline yesterday and the music has to be in on Monday. I'm going to try and call over to Cracknation this weekend for an update.  Ok, time for tea and remixing...

      Little B has the flu, so the studio is basically contaminated. Thus our Tuesday studio event was out the door. Sissy boy. However, news comes Mattagement that both HF and the aggression have received reviews in the newest issue of Outburn. THE DISTRACTED LOVER, which received an 8 out of 10, was a well written review in which I felt the reviewer gave it a fair shake and actually knew what the hell he was talking about. Most shocking was that his favorite track on the CD, PIRATED, is in fact my least favorite. Meanwhile, the aggression's DEVIATIONS ep got a 6 out of 10 from some reviewer who seemed more hellbent on classifying everything in a genre as opposed to actually getting into details about the music. While the reviewer is very kind to FLOOD as an album, it's shocking at how the two reviews differ. One is well written and really gets into the guts of the CD while the other sounds like some bored kid trying to explain something to a pal in the dorm room. Anyway, its fun to hear opinions like this, especially when they're good. Of course, right when we get reviewed, the label doesn't have an ad in sight for any of these records. No one in the MOGcamp is shocked.  Via the wonderful world of the Internet, Ash has delivered his parts for the second half of the track we call TWO BASSES. As a joke, I call it TWO BASSES THIN. If you get that, you get 10 points. Anyway, I am due in DC this week so I want to take this track with me to really get into it. The first half is slow, this new half is faster. The key to this will be to make a solid transition between the two. I see this at the moment on the second half of the album. (I write that simply so a year from now we can compare where the track actually ends up)  I close the evening reading about Raymond Watt's new project, which is called, and I love this...WATTS. My dear friend Marc Heal appears on this I think. This will give the Kidd and I much enjoyment as we love all things Raymond. I hope it's good. I hope I don't have to order it from Japan. I hope it's awesome. Meanwhile, Bryan Black is going to put out the long-awaited Haloblack album THROB soon. I'm curious how that album will be received by the kids. Louche slipped it to me a while ago. I dig it, its really well done. However, it is not fast, not hard, but unique and interesting. I can hear the douche coldwave kids (not you, Aero) complaining. But kudos to Bryan for expanding his palette. It's a tough sell of a record though. The only thing Coldwave I'm digging thats new is Christ Analogue's new one. That's a hot album.  Watts will probably be awesome. Hopefully  F

      Early AM call at the studio yesterday for us to review Robin's guitar parts from earlier in the week and alter NEW SONG to fit those parts accordingly. Quite happy with the track and it's new rockier vibe. Also went over my newer chorus basslines for EXIST, which I'm not as happy with, mostly because they conflict with the hook-bass I had previously written. The Hook-basslines are better and have to stay. Not sure what I'm going to do here yet, but one I idea I have tossed around is having Ash play bass over this part for a different feel. That might do the trick.  Then we settled down to handle basslines for 1956. Tough track and because its faster and rockier than most of what we have been doing, it took a long time for me to get the right feel for it. Also, this record is going to be as "live" as possible, meaning, we're trying to get the human element of having someone play consistantly over a song as opposed to taking a measure and cutting and pasting repeatedly. To get into the feel of the track, we put on some Primal Scream tracks that i would play along to. Once we felt I had the Mani vibe cooking, I got to work. The song is in three diverse parts, one is the very hard , the other is a synthy dance section (the verse) and the last is is a melodic string part (the chorus). So I had to play three different basslines that encompassed three different moods. I think what we got down works and should set the tune in motion. It's hot, rocky, and dirty. As everything should be.  We've started scouring through books and such for art inspiration. I'm going to be doing the art on this one so we're are throwing some ideas around. I want to do a photo session with everyone to get that vibe. Maybe this can happen tomorrow night if we can get everyone together. I'm thinking Anton Corbjin, but I always think that. I just need some photos to get the ideas flowing.  Besides playing the new Hybrid album non-stop (and not just the tracks with Peter Hook on them) I am really into the new UNKLE album, which is quite good and features a Stone Roses reunion of sorts with Ian Brown and Mani on the same track. Also digging the Manics for some reason this week. Over the next month or so we should be checking out some great gigs including: Spiritualized, Death Cab For Cutie, Twilight Singers and of course, Saintface. We're going to see the MAN Izzard on the 11th. HAPPY DAYS.  As for Chemlab, I am at a loss and have no idea what is going on. Frustrating!  F

      With Ash unable to make it last night, the spotlight focused on Ms. Emmet, who, while brought in initially to be the aggression’s first and only drummer (and quickly became my favorite member of the aggression), has become quite the impressive guitar player in Hypefactor. Because of changes made to the track she initiated, THEY’VE JUST, we re-recorded her guitar parts and tried different variations of it (i.e. acoustic and electric guitar takes), so we have lots to play with. As always, her focus and desire to see things come out perfect is a blessing. Once that was out of the way, we recorded her playing some Noel Gallagher style rock guitar on NEW SONG (obviously, just the working title), and by God did she turn this song into the rocker I was envisioning. Robin’s a really talented musician and my intention will be to make sure she is never underutilized. And yeah, she’s my favorite member of Hypefactor, too. Between Robin, Ash and B, I feel quite fortunate to have all these talented people working on my “solo” album.  We loaded 1956 in the computer, but because of our Robin-centric evening, we will get to this song during out next session, but everyone seems pretty hot for it.  Back in the other musical universe, our friends in Dubsinth back in St. Petersburg Russia have handed in their remix of THESE MILLION NIGHTS for the forthcoming aggression EP. Yura, aka Atom Fear, has really delivered a great, slow, moody, and cinematic remix that will fit very nicely on the final CD. Awesome work!  Sino, from Japan, informs me his remix of DREAMS TO DEATH is finished. Hopefully, I will be able to write about it shortly. Also, Cyanotic, an industrial band I know from the Midwest, wrote to tell me they should be delivering a remix on or before 10/1. Of course, my musical Alzheimer’s has kicked in and I can’t remember what track I gave them. Anyway…  Danny-Boy informs me I missed the NYPDBLUE season premiere. I must really love this album to forget such an important event. But there is no more important television event this year than the 24 season premiere on, I think, October 28th. I need TIVO. Immediately.  F

      I'm saddened to read reports that 16 Volt have called it a day. Once upon a time, it seemed as though Eric and co. we're going to be the break out stars of that scene we were all once a part of. The Kidd, Mark Mohtashemi and I were big fans of this band, especially during their Skin/LetDownCrush era, which I think many feel was their peak. Those two records are classics and really had a unique sound and feel to it. During this period, Eric did an awesome remix for us of CROSS, which is on our second CD. Later, they assembled what I felt was going to be the "dream team" with Krayge Tyler, Mike Peoples, and Servo, and while it kicked ass live, I felt Supercoolnothing was a bit of a let down (no pun intended. While I loved the songs, I felt it was too metal for my taste, though i find myself going back to it every now and then.  I don't know the circumstances of thier break up, but I know they had recorded new material via a demo deal with Capitol or some major, which I can only assume fell through. Also, Jason was telling me how he had been talking to Eric about an Acumen/16v double bill. I guess that's off, but it could have made for a hell of a swan song. Now I double regret our showing up too late to see them in LA last month.  I think 16V had a few more good albums in them. Perhaps later down the line they can bring it back. In the meantime, I hope this doesn't stop Eric Powell from continuing to make music. He's an extremely talented dude.  In the meantime, about a year or so ago, the aggression began demo'ing songs for what might have been their next CD. the material was quite good, but debate ensued as to weather or not these were aggression songs and they are currently in "limbo". A song or two from the "Fernwood Terrace" sessions will probably end up on the Ass Cobra album, but one of those songs, titled 1956 will now be appearing on the Hypefactor record. I'm REALLY excited about this track, which is very Primal Scream, and appreciate Ash signing off on it. We'll work on it tomorrow night.  F

      Quick Pit Stop in the studio yesterday for some bass overdubs and retracking some older parts to fit the current scheme of things. Quite frankly, it was too nice out to sit in the studio too long. We did some stuff, fixed some tracks and went CD shopping at Rebel Rebel. Of course we spent too much money (Brandt in particular), but it was worth the hit as the purchases between both of us (new UNKLE, Hybrid featuring Peter Hook, and Muse's new one) were all winners and now blasting loud on the Ipod.  The vision for the rest of the album becomes clearer. A track written in the aggression camp might defect to HF2 if I can get Ash to sign off on it. If so, we're going into Primals territory. More when I know.  S.O. and I spent last night at college galpal turned publicist to the stars 30th birthday party last night. Though these things are normally not my scene and despite the former TV star turned Batman pulling a no show even though he RSVP'd (and much to the relief of S.O. and the birthday girl who are afraid of that combo), it was fun to see my estranged pal Amidala dancing in the same room with Jean Gray and Chuck Barris (who can dance like a mother). The title of this entry says it all and you can credit that quote to Danny Boy.  Though we did make it to San Genarro this afternoon, I am sad to miss beer fest today though I enjoy the company of my very small relatives (and should be home in time for some PPV).

      Booted out of MOGworld for a girls night, I made my way to the cage last night to review our work with Link as well as address the outstanding needs for the album as it stands. It mostly became a night of fine tuning and bass overdubs. What I like about the brisk yet leisurely pace of this album is the ability to have some perspective and really focus in on things. Recently, Ash was pointing out something he felt was lacking in one of the songs and then added that he wanted to make sure everything was at the highest level it could be. Sometimes that requires throwing whole parts out (like we did with the verses to SOLAR) or sometimes it requires going deep into the song, listening to every individual part and either adding or removing something, which we did last night by creating a new chorus bassline for EXIST. Long, hard work, yes, but rewarding when you get the desired results.  A new song is brewing, I might have mentioned this somewhere. I think Brandt's working title for it is BITTER PARTY OF ONE or some gayness like that. Unlike the other songs on the album, he's written guitars, keyboards and such first and then I'm throwing basslines down. We did something similar on KIEKO'S LAST SMILE on HF1, but that was mostly because I hated the tune initially and was indulging him. Of course, it ended up being one of the best tracks I have ever been a part of. Anyway, the parts he has so far are quite good and he keeps throwing bits and pieces of this new tune at me each time I show up. I play bass and then I never think about it again. Then when I come back, I hear where he is at with it, and I dig it. Watch, this one's going to be a keeper.  With the exception of one track, which I need parts from Ash for, the next week or so is in Brandt's hands for guitar overdubs, so I get to breathe a bit (though I doubt I will). We spent hours last night figuring out where new guitars need to go or where current ones need to be changed. The rest of the evening was spent, almost in frustration for me, trying to figure out what the album is missing at this point. We have 8-9 songs, and I would like to see it end up being 11 songs plus the hidden track previously discussed. Therefore, there probably needs to be one last round of writing and I'm going to spend the next few weeks or so figuring out what else I would like to hear on the album as well as coming up with some interesting approaches to writing said material. My intention is to be ready to record drums by 10/1.   Well, have you see all this wonderful publicity for the Chemlab album? (read that as sarcasm).  I've got The Cure's TRILOGY DVD on. Forgot how good an album Pornography is, though I like Ash, Tom and Matt's version of 100 YEARS much better ;-)  F

      Former MOG founder and aggression superstar Mr. Link came to town, sax in hand, and though we had a short amount of time with him, it was very productive. Ash came in as well for this special occasion, and with Brandt, the 4 of us were able to hammer out a newly designed verse for SOLAR, which needed the revamp. Link plays some sexy sax in it. Its very deep now, more the album closer I was hoping it would end up being.  We then did an improv jam, totally over 10 minutes of the four of us playing to a click. Very light, very jazz. Look for this song, now called CHATTING BIRDS, as the hidden track. Last but not least, we recorded tons of Link just playing sax for future use. Lots of incredible material to go through.  We then had a fun pac/poontang meal and drinks. Great stuff.  ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO was entertaining, but see LOST IN TRANSLATION immediately. NOW. Go. The Links, Danny-Boy, SO and myself checked it out tonight and its wonder ful. I love Scarlett Johanssen. She's a heartbreaker. In the theatre was the guitarist from Interpol with the muttonchop sideburns and let me tell you, he LIVES the gimmick. All I'm saying.  Here's some product placement...  http://cn.rockdell.org/cracknation/attachments/IM000448.JPG  Thanks, Pally!  F

      The Factor Corporation gathered it's division heads at the cage last night. The Head of Engineering decided to show an hour and a half late, which gave yours truly, the CEO, the opportunity to have a nice drink at Les Halles downtown with Deputy Douche. Later we were joined by General Rabinowitz and I gave them a sneak preview of the new Chemlab, which they liked and appreciated. A good test.  Anyway, once we all got up to speed on where all the songs are at, we went back to those earlier acoustic tracks the four of us recorded some time ago. They hadn't been addressed since the initial recording. Well, one of them, which we just call TWO BASSES (obviously wont be the final title) has now morphed into a really cool trip hop track that suddenly goes dance. VERY cool loops from Ash and then Robin and I recorded some additional guitars and bass, respetively. B wrote some new stuff as well that he will be recording in the coming days. Suddenly this track has a whole new life and a new vibe that I am very into.  We then addressed THEYVE JUST, which will remain a sparse, acoustic based track (I think). Robin went mental (for Robin) and was pissed a certain take of her guitars wasn't used. I think she hit Ash at one point, even though this is really something I did. Anyway, we found the part and will be putting it in. I promise, Robin! I think Brandt has a track or two to add to this one and then I will take another pass at it. Very moody piece, very romantic and fits real well on the album.  Lastly, we tackled SOLAR, which we all have problems with. Everyone has pin pointed that the problem lies in verses, which are not as full developed as the choruses. People were a little hesitant to make comments cause I had done the arrangement, but I was fully in agreement with the comments made and am determined to get this song up to speed. Brandt had some guitar lines that I think I totally missed that will work on improving the verses. This weekend, the idea will be for me to write an entirely new bass line and get some sax in there. I see this as the album closer. The song is there, we just need to develop more.  A lovely trip back to the Gramercy area with Robin, the ass grabber. She expressed to me how much she she enjoys working with HF, but also misses the aggression. As Batman used to say in the old TV series: "Poor Deluded Child".  All in all, it was a very productive evening!  On a side note, America loses two great icons in Johnny Cash and John Ritter. Rest well, men.  F

      While the asses cobraed yesterday, it was back to the Birdcage (the new name for the studio) to work on the Audio Warfare remix. As I'm sure you can figure out, the track is pretty hard, and quite honestly, the remix is even harder. I think my friend Christian Nitrate will approve.   Needleye delivered big time on their remix of the aggression's MY WHITE NOVA. It's a stormer and does what I like best with remixes, uses a lot of the original song for the listener to know its a remix, yet adds so much of themselves to it that it becomes interesting and original. They manipulated a vocal that original said "you were so goddamn pretty" to sound like "you were so goddamn prissy". Hilarious. Kudos and thanks to Gilez and Needleguys. The remix reminded me of why I originally wanted to be in a heavy band.   However, now with half the EP now, I find myself in that position that I HATE more than anything, which is nagging the other remixers to hand theirs in by the deadline. This is even harder when you have people remixing in places like Japan and Russia. When I was watching over 12 or so remixers for PURE LIQUID EGO, I felt like the bigggest asshole in the world trying to get people to finish, especially since they were working for free. Hate it. I do like nagging Jamie Duffy though...he deserves it. ;-)  It's interesting that while I am chin deep in the Hypefactor album, I find myself going back to listening to very hard music. I'm loading the Ipod with old v23, Schwein and of course, old Chemlab. I think this is a yin and thing. Ash was recently disenchanted with one of his many musical projects and I explained to him that we all have different moods and the music we do reflects that. That's why now, in our Power Station/Arcadia phase, I feel a longing for the aggression and that kind of music. Eventually. Right now, I have Chemlab to keep me in that vibe.  The evening ended at the pub celebrating S.O.'s birthday with half of poontang and half the pac (in the form of G and the Kidd). The evening included cameo's from Bing and MURRAY! Good times, though we send good thoughts out to our dear friend Dorg, who had a bit of a spill earlier in the day and is in rough shape. Much love to her.  And now...brunch.  F

      Regarding a collaboration between Duran Duran and Gwen Stefani, Guitarist Andy Taylor said: ""It also has to work musically. We're not just going to bring someone in because they're Gwen Stefani ..."  Le Bon quipped: "Oh, I would!"  Genius.

      Took a brief pit stop into the studio last night for a few hours to fix up Solar. Some parts previously laid down needed to be re-recorded to fit in the song properly. When arranging, this happens. So of course a simple piano part now is three tracks of three different ideas that I will sort through today. Once this minor tweaking is done, I'll E it over to the studio, where B will prep it as am MP3 for the "Corporation" (as I call it) to hear. I have a good vibe about this song.  We had the Latin Grammy's on, hoping to get a glipmse of Cerati, who I have a feeling didn't bother to show, despite being nominated for Best Rock Album (I think).  Meanwhile, Brandt presented some parts for the new song he mentioned earlier here in the blog blog blog. Despite it's Thrill Kill Kult rip off strings that might need tweaking, I quite liked and laid down a quick bassline. I struggled for a bit to come up with more and decided not to push it and wait till B lays down all his guitars. His parts for this are good and I'm looking forward to playing with this one.   The new Twilight Singers EP arrived the other and day and all I can say is: Greg BY GOD Dulli, you have been sorely missed. Welcome back! Dan Hamill has taken a full week of work off just to listen to this three song EP. Can't miss this one and the cover is sweet too.

      Blog blog blog. Dear Bloggie...  Just got back from the Bradley J. Fox nuptuals in Chicago. Good time and good to see former aggression members as well. I think we have Mr. Linq locked in for an appearance on HF2. He has the demos and was digging them quite a bit when we parted ways. He and Nina should be popping into MOGworld next week. Came home to find the 24 marathon in full effect. Needless to say, I am a big 24 mark and was suckered in immediately as was Mr. G 70 blocks away.  The new aggression remix EP takes shape. Needleye has finished their remix and it's on it's way. I don't even know which song I sent them! SINO from Japan has agreed to do a remix and Brand't is getting the parts ready as we speak. The Russians have finished one and have asked if they could do more! Can't complain about that.  Saw the family Novak while in Chicago for a fun evening. It was good to be there in a non work situation. Which of course meant Jason and I went straight into the studio to listen to the Crack works in progress. With the Novak kids asleep, the grown-ups fast-forwarded through the much discussed MTV awards. The Madonna/Britney thing was a snooze, but Jack Black is a genius. Anyway, I thought the Duran Lifetime achievement award was a great idea on paper, but was executed poorly. Still, to see them on TV was great...and speaking of the Durans...  On the 27th, my 31st Bday, some of the crew caught Duran at their intimate gig at Webster Hall and by god was it incredible. Please refer to my previous post from the gig I saw last month and apply it here, except 500x better, which quite possibly makes this my favorite gig of all time. it was a shorter set, but we left that gig drained and amazed. I was also glad to see that the last gig wasn't a fluke and these guys mean it. Just see any recent review in the NY papers and you'll see. Amazing.  Spinning the new BRMC CD at the moment, so far, they have avoided the sophomore jinx. So far.  Chemlab's drop date is supposedly the 3rd week of October. I designed a Chem Tshirt that hopefully some of you will be wearing soon. A new project with Jared (not Chemlab) is in the planning stages and should be the project I segue into after the recording of HF2, though bough projects might run simultaneously.    Brandt tells me I have some work to do on SOLAR. I like the sound of that!  F

      Back again from another Saintface gig last night, this time an early show at Mercury Lounge. Solid as always, and some of these new songs, including the set closer, are great dance tunes. However the gig was too early and quite, ahem, Frankly, I think they are playing around town too much. They should be out there less while their album is in progress. It will build anticpation and they would have better turn outs at the gigs. PLaying too much gives people the opportunity to skip a gig because they can always see them "next time". The aggression would play gigs like events so if you missed it, you were screwed (that doesnt always work either, but hey). As for the Saintface album, I predict this album will be quite good and worth the wait. Peter again is cryptic when asked about certain songs being on the album. He should be when I'm around, I guess!   I met with with both Peter Saintface and Michael Saintface tonight to discuss the new Hypefactor album. I also took the opportunity to finally give them the HF2 demos. Brandt got a bunch of songs into better shape so I could give them to the guys. They seem excited and Peter in particular seemed really keen on getting into it. I hope they can be a big part of this.   As mentioned above, new HF demos are now circulating amongst the core crew. I had purposely stayed away from listening to the tunes for a few weeks so I would be fresh eared when hearing these new roughs. I'm happy to report I am still loving this bitch and want very badly to get back into this record tomorrow. We're ready for live drums!  Ill be posting less mostly because Former High School Classmate turned College Roommate turned Magazine Writer got me the new Smackdown game for the PS2...what can I say other than THANKS!   three words: Cerati. Remix. Album. I ran straight to Ebay and got this 2cd bitch from Argentina. I cannot wait.   And the day begins....

      Been crazy working on Chemlab. Jared is off to Chicago today for the remaining details and then he is off on the Pigface tour. I've been sorting through the new mixes, dong notes and also doing some last minute sound design work for the EP. Fingers crossed no one at INV screws this up (no offense to everyone there, im just anti-labels today, keep reading). The mixes are dirty and more Chemlab than Chemlab. It's harsh and I like it. Luckily, the songwriting is really solid and the music itself is excellent, so its just a matter of mixing and getting it just right.  Mr. G and I caught Paul Weller the other night at Town Hall. It was an acoustic set and he was joined by Gem Archer of Oasis. I don't own any Paul Weller albums (mostly because G owned tons of it when we were roommates), but man do I want to now that I have seen him. The man is energetic and the songs were excellent. Gem is a shockingly good guitarist and really added a lot to it. Amazing. G's review of the gig can be found in the title heading above...  Today I received a fan letter from a guy, Timo, in Germany. He had heard the aggression on various comps and such and wanted to buy "everything", but Tinman hasn't returned ANY E-mails to him. Horrible. I am so furious that I wanted to give this kid every record I have ever done. Sadly, Tinman hasnt returned any of MY emails and I have no cd's either. So i pointed him in the right direction and he is very appreciative. Timo is dead psyched for Chemlab. Me too, pally.  The season premiere of 24 was last night and WOW did it deliver. Jack Bauer: Heroin addict!??!!! I can't handle how good this show is. I have the Kiefer Madness like there is no tomorrow. This is the best show on TV in the past 10 years i think. Since AMERICAN GOTHIC, a lost classic featuring Gary Cole.  Back to the grind, kids...  F

      Hello again, everyone (all nine of you.) I know it has been some time since I posted here, and you have missed my impersonal musings terribly. You feel neglected. But I swear I will not let it happen again. There are simply too many thrills and wacky misadventures in my life at the moment, and I would be remiss were I to spare you any of the gory details. So here it goes:   hypefactor: part deux  I spent a fair amount of time working on the new hypefactor record during the past month, although I was distracted in recent weeks by school, real life shite and some other musical projects. Most of the guitars are tracked on nine songs, however, and I plan to wrap up writing, production and rough mixing on most of the material by the end of this week. There are also two new songs waiting in the wings - "Bitter Party Of One" and "Down To Brass Tacks" - that, for the most part, have yet to be tackled by the team. Both originated from guitar parts I wrote while messing about on other songs, and while they are shamelessly poppy and breezy, I am hoping they make the record. The plan now is to tackle them once we are well underway with tracking live drums, which everyone wants to see happen this month. My fingers are crossed.  We took a bit of a hiatus from work at the Birdcage in late October because F.J. was compelled to make one of his usual pilgrimages to Los Angeles. I gathered Ash and Robin for a session last Tuesday, however, where we reviewed some old parts (such as new guitars for the chaotic "Solar") and listened to some works in progress. But the bulk of our brief session was dedicated to "Two Basses Thin," which had become a thorn in my side as of late.  The song started during one of the June or July sessions with a basic acoustic/bass guitar motif jammed to inifinity, and was later expanded radically when Ash developed a slew of loops for a chorus. The result was somewhat messy in that we were left with two distinct sections that seemed incompatible, the tension between the two exacerbated by F's dense, seven-minute arrangement. The complexity of the thing had me both concerned and flummoxed for some time, and I found myself unable to write anything resembling a workable guitar structure, despite some excellent contributions from Robin and F.J. in the choruses.  The writer's block concerned me enough that I called in Robin and Ash to help me jam around the parts some more and see if the two sections could indeed be linked. At first, Ash also seemed put off by the arrangement, describing it as a "mess." I am not certain that he left the studio any less skeptical. But after an hour of playing, we tracked some lovely new E-Bow parts of Robin's and a new bass part of Ash's that seemed to make the transition more seamless. Having those two playing with me also gave me a much better handle on the chord structure, and I have now tracked a bunch of parts (on top of the 40 or so already there) that attempt to blend the verses and choruses melodically. I hope everything else thinks it works, because I still am not certain. We shall see at the end of this week after I have fleshed things out a bit more, assembled a working mix and circulated MP3s amongst the gang.  While I must leave now to write a paper about stress - in Portugese, no less - I will post again tomorrow in greater detail about some other recent work, including the hypefactor and Chemlab remixes, recent gigs (Spiritualized, Echo and The Bunnymen), record purchases (John Cale, Twilight Singers, Suede) and the continuing saga that is the hypefactor sessions. Until then, cheers.

      Here I am. Been ill since my return from LA and have a houseguest in the form of Bradley J. Fox, so time is at a premium at the moment. We saw MYSTIC RIVER last night which was solid, but marred by a few flaws and an unncessary final 7 minutes. Also, Sean Penn has fallen into Pacino/DeNiro mode where he is starting to become a bit of a gimmick. Tim Robbins however, was quite good.  Anyhow, been using the sickly free time to just chill with S.O. and to also catch up on the mad rush of Chemwork that needs to be ready for the Pigface tour and the subsequent release of Oxidizer in January. Jared's been great in asking my opinion on things (like approving artwork and such) and I've been hectic doing the art for the new T-Shirts as well as for the new limited edition 'MACHINE AGE EP". I've been really hands on with this release, working with Jared on sutures for it as well as the aggression (remember them) contributing a remix to the project. I did the remix, but then had to run to LA, so Brandt really took the reign and really brought it home. so kudos to him cause he saved this one. It's hot and the only place you're going to get 5 of the 6 songs on this bitch. The final track listening has a new song called BLACK SNAKE VOODOO HISS, two sutures, two ESM demos, and the remix of BINARY NATION we did. Hopefully Invisible will get this ready in time for the Pigface tour. Speaking of which, make sure you go to the NYC show, you might see yours truly onstage if all goes as planned.  While I was gone, Brandt took the downtime to flesh out some remixes of DISTRACTED era HF tunes. Quite simply, they are AMAZING and when done, will be made available for all to hear. IN a perfect world, the new album would have a bonus disc with the DISTRACTED EP plus the remixes. A  special edition if you will. Not light we ever signed a record deal for that anyways...  We have tickets to see Death Cab For Cutie tonight, but I might give my ticket to out friend from poontang who's apt went on fire and her ticket is now lost. She is a bigger fan than I am and I think this would make her happy.   Back to the grind this week. Now that the Lab stuff is just about out of the way, I'm aching to get back to the HF2 stuff.

      LA's been a whirlwind of early morning and late evenings. Despite what it seems like, it aint all glamour. Spent some time visiting the set of the movie we've been working on for years that features The One in his next big genre role and co-stars with My Current Favourite Female Actress Who Lives Near The Pub (who I paid money to see in her new movie this past weekend). I could watch her run out of an SUV and into a bowling alley for HOURS. And I did...  Meanwhile, my free moments are spent helping put together this Chemlab EP, which I am doing the artwork for and having my two cents as to what should go on it. I must say I am digging the artwork, I've been having some great bouts of inspiration. Lucky. Jared better keep the title I came up with for this. Also, if he has them ready in time, you'll be wearing Chemlab T-shirts of my design quite soon.  I have a sun tan. Horrible. Embarassing. Though I got it while doing the AIDSwalk here in LA this past weekend with S.O.'s sister. Nobody walks in LA, so this was quite entertaining and moving at the same time. But the tan. jesus.  I think I may have forgotten to mention that the night before I left, we saw Spiritualized. Thanks to G owning LET IT COME DOWN, I am a recent convert to Jason's music and I regret missing their last tour (which BRMC opened). I love the epic and orchestral aspects to the music and I think his lyrics are quite funny. They have a new album, AMAZING GRACE, which is their stripped down rock album, and while I like it, it lacks a lot of the things I love about his music. The live show, unfortnately, reflects that new album and while his band is tight, he sits to the side and just plays without emotion. This totally took me out of the show. I'm not saying the guy has to be a showman, but stand up for chrissake! You're not Robert Johnson. Dude, come on. Get up. lazy Sod.  The Factor Corp. minus the CEO gathered in NYC last night. Maybe B will get the courage to post what went down in the studio while I wasn't looking ;-)  Just get me home. Quick.  F

      I haven't forgotten you, I've been in LA doing the things that I guess I do. I spent a lot of the plane ride here working on the lyrics for a song now entitled THE MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE. Meanwhile, I have music to work on, but there has been so much material recorded recently that it's jamming up my sweet laptop. Speaking of which, I've worn the battery down to the bone so I stopped by Apple to grab me a new one and doubled the RAM in this bitch so it moves a bit faster. Feels good.  Spent a lot of time here with my friend the Famous Comic Book Writer who just gets better and better and is doing amazing job writing my all time favorite title TEEN TITANS. He is so good and such a sweet guy. We spend every Wed I'm in LA buying comics and hopefully we will be collaborating on something big in the future. He also has a cool wife and a very cool office which he shares with another cool comic writer you all read.   Meanwhile...for Mark Mohtashemi and a few others who asked, here are your answers on THIS:  "Greetings, wireheads:   Jared here. This is just a quick posting to explain why the CHEMLAB record’s taking so damned long to hit the streets. Jason and Jamie and FJ and I (along with a few other key noisists) had a fantastic, spring-wound, deepcut-groove time writing and tearing apart the trax that make up OXIDIZER. It’s a great record, very much in the vein of BURN OUT, while not imitating it. It updates and mutates and at its heart is a detonator coil set to go.   I’m really proud of it and everything that’s brought it this far. I want to make sure that all of Jason, Jamie and FJ’s hard work gets shown off in the best possible way, with the most power. However, everyone on the project felt that it got rushed at the end and needed more than we could give it at the time. It was a tough call but we’ve decided to bring in a second producer, Julian Beeston, to work with us on finishing off the record. This means that the record won’t be coming out until January but when it hits the streets, it’s guaranteed to be a multi-layered sonic beast even more improved by a second drag through the mixing desk.  To compensate somewhat for this disappointing delay, I’ll have copies of a limited edition EP with me on the Pigface tour. It’ll have a few trax on it that you might be interested in - a couple of trax from OXIDIZER, as well as two from some EAST SIDE MILITIA demos which I came across recently. The demos feature Geno and the late great William Tucker - very different versions than on the album, and they sound amazing!  Also, the official CHEMLAB web site will be up and running by the time I start the Pigface tour on November 5th. Be warned, it’s going to be in a state of mutation and freak-out for quite a while, shifting a lot as new discolorations are revealed. Check it out at www.hydrogenbar.com   OXIDIZER couldn't have happened without Jason, Jamie and FJ, and come January, I hope you’ll all agree that it was well worth waiting for. In the meantime, thanks for your patience.  Now hold still: here it comes...  jared"  A lof this was news to me, though now I'm hoping the remix in progress (now in the hands of Ash) makes it to the new EP. Timing is an issue and we will bust ass to try and get it on there in time. For the record, we (as the aggression, remember them?) are remixing the track BINARY NATION, one I co-wrote and play on, and is quite in the vein of BURN OUT AT THE HYDROGEN BAR. You'll dig it. Here is my comment on the EP from the Cracknation website "The EP should be interesting. There's a ton of stuff from JCPS that they never used that I compiled for Jared some months ago off a beaten up old cassette that will be on this thing. I'm curious as to what he will pick as there is some crazy shit (and honestly, there is some stuff that would have REALLY made that album a lot better, including alternate takes and such, as well as tunes they never finished)"  Anyway, everything is cool and I am driving a convertable here in LA, which is another story in itself. Forgive me, but it's time to eat at C'Brea, my favorite place to eat in LA.  F  PS: Stu Hart, legendary patriarch of the famous wrestling family, passed away today. Owen, I'm sure is waiting in that ring in the sky waiting to thrown down with his pop again. Bless.

      So Mr. G and I reunited to see KILL BILL yesterday. While I think I liked what I watched, I have to say overall, the film was disappointing. It lacks the cleverness and wit of Tarantino's other work. What I have always liked about his movies was his ability to put a new twist on American pop culture and make it ironic. In fact, that was the framework of his films and I believe the key to his success. However, by using Asian Cinema as his template, he is unable to get you invested in the film. And as some of you may know, I'm a "bit" of a fan of Asian Cinema and let me tell you this, KILL BILL is more of an homage than it is a parody. It's not ironic, it's not clever, and there's really nothing cool about it. The ending blows too. I think if it had been one lone 3-4 hour movie, I could have been satisfied.   Then the rest of the day and evening became quite British and here's why...  1. G, S.O. and I had fish and chips for dinner from A Salt and Battery on Second Ave. This is quite possibly the best fish and chips in the City, though I am somewhat partial to the pub. Poor G had to miss the last crucial minutes of the Yankees so we can meet Matt and Jax and something called Dougie at...  2. The EDDIE IZZARD show. Holy shit is this guy a genius. For years I had no clue about him other than he dressed up like a chick and then one night in London Jared and his wife played me some of Izzard's videos and man is he a blast. Anyhow, this was our first time seeing him live (and matt's 50th time or so), and it was worth the hit. The man has an uncanny ability to seemingly make throaway jokes only to go back to them later and make them funny as hell. During his set he tackled everything from Racisim, cavemen, super heroes, transvestites, the planet mars, dentists, horses, fighting, air flight, did the worst yet funniest Christopher Walken impersonation ever and even made a funny joke about 9/11 (based on the fact that the rest of the world writes their dates with the DAY first and not the month, thus "everyone was wondering WHAT exactly happened on November 9th!). Brilliant. The vibe we left with was so good. I think I was beaming from the laughter!  After a quick pit stop at the Tom aggression Birthday gathering, G and I met up with the Kidd, Ian Broon, and poontang to check out...  3. Saintface. Live. Taking a break from doing their album, the lads put on an entertaining rock show featuring all the ass shaking hits we love. They had a few technical snafus, which is always expected, but this is band which much confidence and energy and the tunes to back it all up. Later, I spoke at length with Peter Saintface about the album and while he told me which rockers are going on the refuses to tell me which ballads are being recorded for fear that I will "pursade" and I am one of the few people who can "sway" him. I am honoured to say the least. Things are looking up for this band and hopefully the album will be in all our grubby hands sooner than later. He and Michael Saintface both asked about HF2 and wheels should be set in motion upon my return from LA.  And now, a lazy day  F

      In the wake of the recent rythmn section shake ups in Ass Cobra, which I'm sure is going to lead to some nasty shit amongst the MOGpac, Ash and Robin made their return to the Birdcage last night. Ash was hyper, Robin was not, so I knew they were both in the proper frame of mind to work. On the way down to the studio, I played them the new versions of 1956 and TWOBASSESTHIN. Both were met with enthusiasm. Everyone seems pleased with the direction the album is taking, but we all realize there is still work to be done. Oh yeah, and for the 4,000th time, we listened to Ass Cobra's DETROIT, which has supposedly taken 6 months to do.   I was happy to see B's friend Kid Who Looks Like Kid From Witness All Grown Up in town and chilling. He is quite fey yet handsome and I think because of that he pulls in tons of chicks. I was happy to find he had bought some chocolate donuts. He is quite thin and can live on these things. He watched MR SHOW and realized it wasn't that funny after all...  B and I had an agenda for these two and we put it in effect immediately. The first big decision was to cut almost 3/4 out of SOLAR and start from scratch. No one was happy with the song, so instead of talking about it for hours, we decided to just get rid of everything that was problematic and go at it again. Even I, who normally is adamant about keeping things, felt this made sense. I think the crew were a little surprised how agreeable I was. I'm not sure yet what this means for Link's sax parts, which concerns me a bit  Robin has been playing too much guitar lately, so I felt she needed a bass in her hands. I challenged Ash to stop playing guitar like a jazz half ass and to rock out a little bit. B sat in the corner, I think with a guitar, its hard to tell when Bat-Ash needs the lights off everytime we work. Ash and Robin switched back and forth between bass and guitar and the results were awesome. It took a really long time, which is kinda uncharacteristic for us, but it was worth it as we got the necessary parts to work with. Thanks to these two, we have a good verse and a really nice melodic bridge that (and I didn't say this to Ash at the time) sounds like The Cure.   During all this, I sat with a laptop, checking E-Mail, talking to a few folks online and looking bored . In reality, I'm jotting down ideas for arrangements, occasionally a lyrical idea, and listening VERY closely. Sometimes I'll just spring up and say "THAT'S IT!" or "NO NO NO". Anyway, B will have to lay down his stuff (also quite good) and get all this to me before I leave for LA on Tuesday so I can hammer it into shape. After that, we'll figure out where this tune stands, but I think it's in really good shape.  It was late, but I wanted to flesh out EXIST because I just wasn't happy with the bass in the chorus. And you know its serious when it's ME playing the bassline I don't like it. At this point I was kinda tired, but I recall Robin laying down a lot of bass for me to play with. I also think Ash threw down some guitars.  Overall, it was a evening serious success. It wasn't like our usual sessions where the magic happens immediately. This was more about getting deep into the guts of two songs and mining the gold out of them. It's not easy. Robin referred to is as "unproductive", though I countered that it's quality, not quantity, and Hypefactor got some real serious quality out of the kids last night.   My immediate task ahead is to work with the new stuff discussed above and to tweak 1956. I have written some lyrics for the song, which are actually the first for this album and now changes need to be made accordingly. In the meantime, the decision has been made to not write any more for this album until we have the live drums over the tracks. When we have that, we will then make the next round of creative decisions. I am hoping we can spend November getting the drums into shape. Then we will assess what we have and then go from there. I'm not putting any time restraints on this one. I want it perfect.  And perfect it shall be...  F

      Hi Ashley:  After an early breakfast this morning with my old pal the famous Martial Arts Cinema historian/Author (who hated KILL BILL by the way), I decided to stroll through Times Square in search of inspiration for my mom's Birthday gift. I hadn't been up there since G, Matt and I spent an evening with Wrestling Superstar Who Used to Be Shinobi. Anyway, I am a die hard New Yorker, to the end hopefully, but there is some weird shit in Times Square. Based on my experience today, I would like to tell you that we live in a world in which:  1. Robert Evans has an animated series about his life (that's actually a plus). 2. Posh Spice shills for hip hop clothing. What the FUCK. 3. Why is my agent/lawyer/advisor spending money for me and my girlfriend to see "A Boy George musical" that is also a "Rosie O'Donnell production". This is BROADWAY? Where are the actors? 4. Jason Patric on Broadway. Nuff said. And no, he's not an actor, he's a method half ass. 5. And to make it worse, he is "acting" opposite Ashley Judd. 6. Bubba Gump Shirmp Company opens on December 6th. I'll be at Sardi's thanks.  This is all I can think of it. It was too much. I hate myself. Anyway, I ended up getting mom tickets to see Hugh Jackman looking crazy disco gay in THE BOY FROM OZ. and yes, I'm going too. Dan Hamill just told me "Moms love singing fags". I would have agreed with this, but Jackman IS Wolverine, so he's tops in my books.  My "celebrity" sighting was Robert Sean Leonard who looks like my relative who married a woman to cover the fact that he loved men. There's nothing wrong with that! Stop it! Gay is OK. Where the hell are the real stars!  Anyway, this sent me packing right into the Virgin Megastore where they expected me to spend 30 bucks on the new John Cale album. Luckily, Amazon UK has it for like 14 bucks. Screw you Branson. I ALMOST bought the new Interpol single cause it's the Arthur Baker remix, but its just two song. Lousy. Luckily I came to my senses and ran home, where I now have to go meet my former student, Edward, who is a nice guy.  Two more remixes have arrived: The first one comes all the way from Japan. SINO, who you can read about in the new Industrial Nation, took an interesting approach to DREAMS TO DEATH and made it a nasty machine dirge. It's very simple, but effective and fits in real nice on the EP. In the meantime, the lads in Cyanotic delivered their remix of THESE MILLION NIGHTS and have taken a drum n bass approach to it. Solid. I'm really happy with it and it gives us something we don't have yet on the record. One thing I have learned from all this is that Tom's vocals remix really well. Remixers love the smooth vocals.  Meanwhile I am working on a remix for a band you all know and love but are curious as to where their new album is. I am just as curious to be honest with you as I thought I would have it by now. Who knows. I'll get back to you on that. Also, I'll report back tonight or tomorrow after we get the crew together at the studio. Lots happening with HF. Till then...  F

      Despite my being distracted by Dan Hamill's discovery of classic wrestling on channel 70, the vision of the new Hypefactor album became significantly clearer with a whirlwind editing/arranging sessions yesterday at the Birdcage. With this session, two songs, 1956 and TWOBASSES took massive shape and now have the structure and guts they need to become excellent songs. I heard B's new guitar parts for 1956 yesterday and was really happy with them. As usual, there was a lot to listen to, and this actually led to my editing new sections of the song just based on his new guitar parts. This song is a stormer. Meanwhile, he was really into my weird arrangement for TWOBASSES, which is basically two songs now, and I think we are going to treat it as such. the first half is acoustic/electro and the second half is a Stone Roses-esque dance jam. But each part uses elements from the other. I'm REALLY psyched.   If all goes well, we should have the album laid out and ready for live drums in the next few weeks. of course, Ash will come in this week and kill the buzz by wanting tons of stuff changed (I mean this in a good way).  Meanwhile, S.O. and I caught up with Mr. G and we saw SCHOOL OF ROCK featuring the genius that is Jack Black. This movie is hilarious and makes the best use of the Jack Black gimmick, taking it to new heights. What made it even more interesting was watching these kids rock out and they knew how to really play. I'd be curious to see how they cast this movie (something, I'm sure for the DVD). Then we met up with members of poontang and sang Verve and Robbie Williams songs till the wee hours at the original MOG hang out O'Hanolans.  And now the best news of the morning:  Revenge/Monaco album announced  LTM are pleased to announce a deluxe 2xCD reissue of the sole album by Revenge, the electro/hard rock hybrid fronted by New Order bass player Peter Hook between 1989 and 1992. Following the release of Technique in 1989, the four members of New Order spent time apart to pursue other ventures. Always intended as a proper band rather than a solo project, Hook was joined in Revenge by Chris Jones and Dave Hicks, and later by David Potts, who would remain with Hook as part of Monaco five years later. Indeed in some respects Revenge can be seen as a dry run for Monaco, who went on to deliver a top ten album and single in 1997. One True Passion was first released by Factory Records in June 1990 and spawned a trio of singles, 7 Reasons, Pineapple Face and Slave. Given free reign to indulge Hook’s leather-trousered rockist instincts, the OTP material welded hard rock to dance beats, with a lyrical focus on sin and redemption. The artwork was just as contradictory, combining sleek Peter Saville typography with softcore imagery by Suze Randall. The band toured like bastards, and in January 1992 delivered the excellent ep Gun World Porn, which offered a more laid back, intimate feel. Deleted after the messy collapse of Factory in late 1992, One True Passion has now been retooled and reconfigured by Hook and Potts, and comes with a full-length bonus disc of rare remixes and unreleased songs in demo form. Standout tracks include 7 Reasons, Deadbeat, Big Bang, State of Shock, Pineapple Face and Jesus I Love You. All material has been carefully digitally remastered. The set contains over two hours of music, and the booklet includes sleevenotes by Joy Division/New Order biographer Claude Flowers.   I feel it appropros that in the middle of my second CD exploring these very influences that this retrospective is announced. Mega!  F

      In DC for a few days. For the first time since S.O. lived here when we were wee kids in love, I took Amtrack down. However, thanks to some travel experience, was bumped up to first class, which was a delight. The tea was always handy, just like on Continental's first class flights, but the difference here is that a. you can use your cel phone and b. they have outlets for each seat, which for a guy like me who seemingly has become physically grafted to his laptop, is a blessing. This is a far cry from the last time I was on an extended train ride, which was in Mother Russia (see theaggression.com tour diary for details), however, the Russian dining cars are the BEST (right, Matt?).  Therefore, the 2 and a half hours on the Acela Train gave me time to work on the HF2 song TWOBASSES, which I have mentioned previously. It's a tough song with a lot of parts, so the bulk of my time was spent figuring out how to mesh the very fast part with the very slow part. NOT easy, but I made some headway and thus I am looking very forward to my train ride back to NYC (hopefully) this afternoon to get deeper into it. I think, and this is for those in the corp. reading it, I'm going to add little noises and such from the faster part and pepper them throughout the slower part for continuity. I sound like a chef.  Anyhow, I am staying at the Willard in DC. Fancy-ass hotel. Awesome. My lovely S.O. would dig the hell out of this place. But historically significant because it is the bar where Ulysses S. Grant would drink. All the politicians who wanted his ear would hang out in this lobby to wait for him to get him to sign off on things while he was wasted on rye. Hence, the term "lobbyists". How cool is that?! That's your history lesson of the day.  The kids in Cyaontic wrote me to say their remix for the aggression EP should be done today. I'll report on once they send me an MP3.  In the best news of the week, former aggression vocalist turned important screenwriter and his Mrs. have had their long-awaited baby, a girl, who's name, at the moment I don't know how to properly spell, so I will refrain from trying. Needless to say, it's not F.J. Everyone is in good health. The Mom called me and she sounded like she had just come back from shopping, while the Dad sounded like he just did 4 tours of duty in Iraq. Hilarious. Bless! I have no doubt that S.O. is currently shopping for MORE for this new child, as my lovely girilfriend has bought more clothes for this baby than I have in my closet. But hey, kids are awesome. I get my lil cuz's on Sunday!  On the run.   F

      Last night, at a hotel in lower Manhattan, I met the man who influenced me to pick up a bass guitar when I FIRST met him 12 years ago. It's no secret here who this person is, but needless to say he was a total gentleman who was funny and sweet. This brief conversation totally justified my musical existance. We discussed Hypefactor, bass playing and Gibson Thunderbirds. When he asked for a CD, I was floored. Kudos go to Irene (for giving me the last copy of Distracted Lover we had in the house, so I didnt have to rip down my framed copy), G (for coming along so I didn't look like a stalker), and B (tipping me off about the DJ set). It gets better as said bass hero is performing tonight here in NYC.   What a great moment. Thanks, Hooky!  Meanwhile, lyrics are bring revised and honed for HF2. I've been taking advantage of free moments during the Turkey break to focus on the written word. Yesterday, I shot some lyrics over to B and he came back with some positive feedback. Jazzed, by that, I began arranging what is now called OUR FAITH (title to change, though I hated calling it BITTER PARTY OF ONE). I have a decent intro and verse, so this morning I'll work on the choruses before being beaten by a 5 year old AGAIN (no complaints though!).  F

      I write this with a headache a mile wide, so bear with me. With Irene off on a girls night (which I'm told was quite hilarious), I made my way back to the studio to with the intention to remix Saintface and work on a song Brandt's had cooking for quite a while now called BITTER PARTY OF ONE (That title won't last, I promise). However, Ash decided he had to buy his cats gourmet dried fish, so he wasn't going to make, thus that meant no remixing as he had the Face parts. Rrrrr. Thus, we decided to work on the new song..  It took Brandt FOREVER to load this song and all the parts up and I was bored out of my freakin' mind. When he did get the song up, I have to admit I wasnt nearly as pleased with the track as I was when I heard it many weeks back. So a lot of deconstructing went on. The first thing to go were Brandt's strings, which sounded way the hell too much like TKK. Brandt let his Wax Trax fascination get the best of him with this song. I had played some bass awhile back which I thought blew, so I spent a lot of time writing new parts. This took a long time, but I was able to write basslines for the verses and choruses, though the chourses went through a few revisions as the day went on.  At some point during all this, Brandt received a phone call from Ash, saying he was coming by "in a half hour" to drop off the remix parts and I received a phone call from my old pal Jamie Duffy (on tour doing sound for Saves The Day) saying he also was coming by "in a half hour". Its interesting to see what "in a half hour" means for these guys as they didnt show until many half hours later, and hours apart from each other.  Anyway, there was no way Jamie was going to hang out with us and not play, so after he spent 3 hours Instant Messaging people, we put a guitar in his hand and DAMN did he take this new track to the next level. He played the most UN-Jamie like guitars I have ever heard (I mean this in a good way). He played some 12 string as well as some E-bow and really added some sexiness to the track. I just left him and Brandt alone to make this track happen. Now the song went from Wax Traxy to sounding like Soda Stereo. This is good. Damn good.  Then it became the industrial This Is Your Life as the three of us had a big dinner discussing everything under the sun about Jamie's and my past in the world of machine rock (as we call it now). Some funny stories were told and I think Brandt got a kick out of hearing a lot of the behind the scenes stuff that has happened to us over the years.  And yes, Jamie confirmed the atrocity that was the aggression hotel destruction incident. Brandt was shocked that that story was NOT exaggerated.  Then it was drinks long into the evening at KGB bar, which was a good choice as the drinks are strong and priced reasonably and the place isnt overcrowded. Like Russia. I think.  All in all, a fun evening. Thanks, Kid!  F

      The Face made their Knitting Factory Debut last night for an early show opening for someone called My Favorite (who have a bit of a following, I'm told). Well, I'm happy to report that Saintface was in excellent form and played a very "hyper" (Irene's word) and "Spirited" (G's word) set. As a musician who knows the band members well, I could tell that they were having a VERY fun time on there. The music was tight, the band was loose. That's how it should be. Plus, they closed with an oldie called YOU BELONG TO ME, which confirms my suspicion that it's popping up on the album.  Right, Peter?  I would like to add that Saintface have fallen into an old aggression trap. With the aggression, every gig was "the last gig ever" and we'd play a month later. Saintface's gimmick is "last gig of the year" and they play a month later. December 29th will be their third last gig of the year I think. Love it.  And yes, Peter, that was me who yelled "Disco". Sorry. I wouldn't do that if they weren't my favorite band.  Had a nice round of drinks after with my girl, G, brandt and Peter. Good times.  F

      I miss you as well. But here I am.  Pigface, featuring Jared, came into town the other night. It was dilemma for me as we had tix for the Twilight Singers, who I dearly love, but I wanted to see Jared. Irene and I had a great sushi dinner with Jared, who I am always happy to see and have fun with. That was the highlight for sure. As for the gig, the crowd was dead, the venue blows and quite frankly, I feel like Pigface, other than as a promotional tour for Jared/Chemlab, is a dead topic at this point. Touring so soon after the last tour and touring the same market behind KMFDM (who I skipped intentionally when I found out they weren't playing Pig songs) was a huge mistake. Jared is a sole frontman and better off on his own and hopefully this tour at least gets people interested in Chemlab. I was invited to get up and sing CODIENE GLUE AND YOU with Jared (who treats me like a superstar, thanks), but legendary tampon jingle writer Siebold tried to boot me, obviously not paying attention to the fact that I was invited up. Kids stormed the stage, not helping with the confusion either, so eventually, I just sorta walked off the stage cause it was going nowhere. Maybe it was because the aggression was so much better than Douche Dept. when we opened for them. Just saying. And Curse Mckay? Thanks for the water. Dick.  Honestly, between us, I was nervous about going up, as this has been my scene since I was 18. Plus, I hadn’t been onstage in awhile. I was onstage maybe 2 minutes, tops. Irene and Matt were very protective of me post-leaving the stage as I guess I looked a bit frazzled. So my appreciation goes out to them. So while I’m thinking it was a humiliating experience, kids from the gig have been E-mailing me they loved the chaos. Go figure.  Anyway, post gig vibes were low, but thanks to a well-placed Text message from Mr. G, I was able to run down very quickly to catch the last hour of the Twilight Singers. Greg Dulli, fat and drunk, sang the new Outkast song and then played a bunch of Afghan Whigs songs. He was a mess. He talked non-stop. He doesn’t seem long for this world. I’m happy I saw this. I went to bed a happy boy.  The next night was back to the studio for some HF loving. THEY’VE JUST, the first song written for the new album, finally got the attention it deserved and is now a sweet, atmospheric song. Lotta soul to this one. Very pleased with it. 9 songs now for HF2.  Speaking of HF2: the new tentative album titles is EXIT STRATEGIES. You can figure that out on your own.  Last night, Irene found a great Vietnamese bistro for us to find solace in during a massive rainstorm before I headed over to the Coral Room to meet Ash and Brandt for the free Telfon Tel Aviv gig. This gig was nothing sort of EXCELLENT and the band impressed us with their ability to use live instruments instead of solely relying on a computer. Top notch, excellent music. Then I ran into Mike Burnlab, who did the artwork for the new Chemlab record and is a really good guy, so that was a nice surprise.  The evening ended at the Gramercy where Ash, Brandt and I had a very productive and positive discussion about all our different musical adventures. I left this summit quite jazzed and quite optimistic for the upcoming material. I wish everyone I worked with in music was as dedicated as these two (and Robinowitz).  Saintface tonight. More then.

      I am going to be in some deep shit with this...  Jackie Chan in talks with government to construct a Jackie Chan village in Hong Kong over the next ten years  by Wu Chi Ming 2003.11.17  Jackie Chan took interviews with a few Japanese newspapers the other day, and revealed plans to cooperate with the Hong Kong government to construct a village (the Jackie village!) in ten years time.  The village could have a Jackie Chan museum and a movie themed park.  Jackie Chan's "Shanghai Knights" opened the day before yesterday in Japan.  But because he was hard at work on "New Police Story, Jackie was unable to promote the movie in person.  But he still attracted a large number of Japanese media who arrived in Hong Kong to interview him.  He accepted interviews from "Sports Daily" and "Sankei Sports" and disclosed his planned construction of the Jackie village in Hong Kong.  Each part of the facility [would be world class.]  Jackie Chan said, "...I plan a Jackie village!  Besides having a movie themed park, we could have a theater, a [sports area?] and a Jackie museum.  Jackie had originally had this idea on his mind for several years.  He said, "Although Jackie Village is still in the planning stage, there has already been four or five meetings with the Hong Kong government.  The final plan isn't in cement yet, and I can't disclose details.  It was a secret!  There are still a lot of plans for the project.  Moreover, from the beginning until now it's been about two or three years.  I believe in order to complete the project it would take ten years!"  A few years ago there were rumors of plans to construct a Jackie Chan museum in Yokohama, but the plan was stopped.  Now Jackie has regained hope.  http://www.the-sun.com.hk/channels/ent/20031117/img/c21117_big.jpg

      Sorry, been buried. But here I am for your stalking pleasure.  Chemlab is literally consuming my life. This is not a bad thing. Tons of work, E-mails flooding in and lots of new interest in my musical world from the kids. The Chemlab message boards are a lot of fun so far. Hopefully, no jackasses will go and ruin it. Thanks to this new exposure, a few aggression/HF cd's are being bought up and the talk of the chat boards is the new Chemlab "MACHINE AGE" EP. Jared is out on the road with Pigface now selling it as well as the new T-shirts (can't wait to strap one of those on!). Finally, my copies of the EP arrived today thanks to the very nice Mike at Invisible and it sounds super. I think for a limited edition tour only item, this is the perverbial bomb, as they say. I'm  not 100% happy with the way my artwork was printed, but I have little to nothing to complain about. Its the first official Chem-release in years and I got to be a part of it. Now, onwards to Oxidizer in January...and beyond.  Hypefactor is no less busy. Tackling the song THEYVE JUST, now which has gone from moody acoustical thing to mini-Cure epic. Love what this is turning into. Its the last song to be developed before we being tracking drums. LOTS of inter-corp discussion about the drums, etc. Thats a new challenge for us as we have never directly recorded live drums for one of our projects before. It will certainly be educational. Ash has laid some of the groundwork for this with the Cobra's, but I think we're gonna do some really great stuff in the next few weeks. Robin's ready for this. I know she will come through big time. Also, Brandt has updated the news section of the site, so check that our and LEARN, asap!  Meanwhile, the aggression (remember them) have been informed by the label that the THESE MILLION NIGHTS EP is on the schedule for early 04 (to capitalize on the chemlab association, I'm sure), so I've started prepping the art for it. We're not sure if it's going to be in a slim jewel case (like DEVIATIONS), which is my preference, or in a regular CD5 case, so as soon as I know, I can go full out on the art. the cover is ready. I'm looking forward to getting back into that world for a bit. I think the label has a few of their artists doing some remixes for this, so we might end up with maybe TEN remixes on this mother. Quite the bang for the buck.  And no, i will not comment on Paris Hilton. Now back to Cerati  F

      Out of touch, but a little bit of time, so here I am...  Took a quick post-24 runner over to the studio the other night to make some cosmetic changes to SOLAR (yes, the real title), 1956 (yes, the real title), and EXIST (yes, real title). When listening to the versions that came out from Saturday's awesome session, I realized a few tweaks needed to be made. EXIST in particular, needed a bit of a change in the intro as the post-saturday one, as S.O. pointed out, sounded exactly like a certain song by a British artist of some note. I went and got the song in question and sure enough, she was right on. It was a minor tweak, but worth it.   SOLAR, the album closer, had a bit too much Hookbass in it, so to keep the impact of that sound fresh in the song, I took stuff I had written for the verses out. There's a great ending to this song, which could be compared to The Cure in their prime. To flesh this section out, B played some sweet piano over it.   I was only in the studio for a few hours, but they were hours well spent.  Now we are trying to formulate a gameplan for the next stage, meaning, its time for the live drums for the first 7 or so songs. Also on the agenda will be to write a track in the rehearsal space with the full band. I had wanted Peter Saintface to get on on this part, but he is neck-deep in the 'Face record, and we're gonna have to be patient while he does his thing there. If I didn't want that Saintface record so badly, I might be upset ;-)  While all THIS is going on, the Chemlab machine is in full swing. The new mixes came in from Jared and Joolz and I'm pleasantly surprised that they were able to take a Chemlab album and mix it to sound even MORE like Chemlab. I wish I had been there, but my comments, as always, are nitpicky. Meanwhile, the new website, complete with message board, is now functioning and I find myself posting left and right and innundated with instant messages about the album, the ep, and anything else related to it. The kids are jazzed for this album and I'm confident it will deliver. Meanwhile, Jared is getting the EP ready in Chicago and I myself am dying to see and hear the final result. I worked on 4 of the 6 tracks and did the artwork for it. It's the first thing kids are going to hear from the new Lab and I am (understandably) excited and paranoid at the same time.   The fan who wrote from Germany wrote to tell me that Tinman wrote him back and he has ordered his aggression CD's. Good! Now watch, he'll fucking hate it...  F

      For the first time in weeks, I made it down to the studio to get back to work on HF2. I had so much energy because I had been itching to get back into it. Hit the ground running and finally did the long awaited arrangement on 1956, which is now a lean mean fighting machine. Of the course of two hours, every time Brandt and I would say "it's done" and play it back, we'd get a new arrangement idea. We shaved a minute and a half off of it, and I'm loving it. Then B played me the new parts to TWO BASSES that they did while I was away and I was really into and was double pleased I didn't have to change a thing in the song. They've really smoothed that tune out and made the two very different parts appear to be seemless. Awesome work.  My next task was to tackle the new intro to EXIST because the newest version B sent me seemed messy. He has so many cool parts in it that it became just a matter of giving them room to shine in the intro. Quick work. I then extended the bridge Robin and Ash wrote for the song, simply because it deserved more ear time and is quite possibly the best 20-30 seconds of the album. Nuff said.  Then, as a nice surprise, Robin and Ash appeared and the band was in full swing. We first just reviewed the songs as everyone had notes (well, ash actually had writtern notes) and comments on the new mixes. Everyone is almost on the same page and even where we're note on the same page, we're at least in the same chapter of the book and quite close. Which is really good. Once we were done reviewing the tracks and set a gameplan for the day, we listened to some of our recent non HF work (i.e. Chemlab and Ass Cobra) and hammered out some internal MOG politics, which is wack, but has to be done sometimes. However, I'm happy to report I'm digging the Cobra.  Then we got back to the problematic SOLAR, which is less and less problematic finally. Robin recorded some new basslines for it while Ash and I watched New Order at Finsbury Park on DVD and checked out the new Peter Saville book. Awesome stuff. Watching the New Order gig sparked a new musical idea that everyone seems down with. Anyway, Robin did an amazing job and then I laid down some hooky goodness over some of the stuff. I now have the parts loaded up and will spend the next few days trying to bring that tune together.  All in all it was a successful evening. We now have 9 songs for the new album. 7 of them are ready for live drums and the other 2 are close. We will probably need one or two more songs. I've given us no timeline to finish this record. Its too good to rush. I've learned my lesson before, but on the flipside, I'm not going to let it go TOO long.  And now, some rest...  F

      There's a lot of HF going down, right now actually. However, I need some sleep. Will report tomorrow about today's awesome sessions with the crew. However, here is further info on what is easily for me the first great release of 2004...  February 2004 sees a deluxe 2xCD reissue of the sole album by Revenge, the electro/hard rock hybrid fronted by New Order bass player Peter Hook between 1989 and 1992. Following the release of Technique in 1989, the four members of New Order spent time apart to pursue other ventures. Always intended as a proper band rather than a solo project, Hook was joined in Revenge by Chris Jones and Dave Hicks, and later by David Potts, who would remain with Hook as part of Monaco five years later. One True Passion was originally released by Factory Records in June 1990 and spawned a trio of singles: 7 Reasons, Pineapple Face and Slave. Given free reign to indulge Hook's leather-trousered rockist instincts, the material welded hard rock to dance beats, with a lyrical focus on sin and redemption. The artwork was just as contradictory, combining sleek Peter Saville typography with softcore imagery by Suze Randall. The band toured like bastards, and in January 1992 delivered the excellent ep Gun World Porn, which offered a more laid back, intimate feel. Deleted after the messy collapse of Factory in late 1992, One True Passion has now been extensively reconfigured by Peter Hook, and includes Hook's new recordings of the late period unreleased tracks The Wilding and Televive. The set comes with a full-length bonus disc, Be Careful What You Wish For, with lots of rare remixes and unreleased songs in demo form.

      Well, Saintface finally had what they claim will be their last gig of 2003 (I'll believe THAT in 2 days), and it was a true test for the band in that they were plagued (and I mean PLAGUED) by technical difficulties that reminded me of the aggression's 2001 comeback gig in NYC. However, I think the 'Face's problems stemmed from the fact that there was incompetence at work at this venue, Sin-E (most famous recently in mogworld as the place where Irene and Anna watched Ed Norton play guitar), and the soundperson basically was either totally new to the club or a homeless person just brought throught the door. There was just too many problems for it to be a regular club problem. HOWEVER, as Irene astutely pointed out, to their credit, the face never missed a note or a beat and were able to keep the energy going. i can relate that it is terribly frustrating to have your momentum fucked with like that, and knowing Peter, I could see the energry draining from his face towards the end, but this is a true test of a band and these guys passed with flying colours. I was also very happy to see the guitar player is REALLY coming into his own and is really becoming a solid presence onstage with the 'Face. He was worth the wait.  They ended with YOU BELONG TO ME again, which confirms my suspicion that this will make it to the album. If not, a cover of it will end up as a hidden track on the new Hypefactor. You've been warned, Peter. Just go finish the goddamn album already, or at least give me the rough mixes to keep me happy. Please.  Peter also serenaded my little sister during this gig and implied several times from the stage that she was with child. She is about 80 lbs soaking wet, so I am confused, yet supremely entertained by this. I was going to ask him what that was all about, but I think I enjoy the mystery much more...  Anna and G went on their way, but Irene and stuck around to check out My Favorite, who have a bit of a buzz these days. I'm happy to say it was worth the wait, as they were quite good. We didn't stick around for the whole set, but I did buy Irene the CD (which I had been contemplating before she expressed her interest). My Favorite are quite good in what we in the MOGpac would call a "John Hughes" kinda way. It's very 80's soundtracky with a solid band and an excellent young lady, Andrea, doing lead vocals. The bassist occasionally dabbled in a Tones on Tail basstone and the guitarist, who looked like he stepped out of my old High School, was VERY good. I feel bad for the accordian player though, he looks quite bored and upset, but was really good on the 2 songs he was allowed to play on. However, the weak link, believe this or not is the main guy, who sings and plays keyboards. He was like everyone one of those Jon Cryer characters from the 80's who never got the girl and then in his 30's decided to start a band. I hate to say this, cause it's obviously his fucking band, but he annoyed the shit out of me. i can't tell if he's doing this all tongue in cheek or not. Unfortunately he's all over the album, but is less annoying. But they should just let this girl sing everything, she's a gem. I won't rush out to see them (cause of this guy), but if they play with Saintface again, I'm sure we'll stick around. Maybe I can adjust. Sorry. I don't mean to sound like a douche here, its just that I really like the songs and the band and especially when the girl sings. ugh. Sorry.  My day starts off on a sad note, as I wake to see news photos of my hero Jackie Chan mourning the death of his friend the famous HK pop star/actress Anita Mui, who passsed away yesterday from complications of Cervical Cancer. Horrible. She was only 40. She moved me to tears when she acted opposite the also recently deceased Leslie Cheung in the classic ROUGE. She was BRILLIANT as Jackie's love interest in MIRACLES and hilarious beyond compare playing his stepmother (!) in DRUNKEN MASTER 2. She was supposed to be in Zang Yimou's next film with Andy Lau (who she shared the screen with in one of my old favourites SAVIOUR OF THE SOUL, which Irene recently bought for me on DVD), Zang Ziyi, and my current favorite Asian film star Takeshi Kaneshiro. This is a big loss for the HK film community and the world itself. That's her quote above...  F

      I've not forgotten you, but I'm sure you, like me, have been busy with the holidays. What I learned this year having a live in girlfriend is that my family at the holidays now perceive me as an "adult" which to me is a four letter word. However, this means now that "we" meaning myself and Irene, have to go and buy gifts for everyone in my family. This is not an easy task and I have newfound respect for my mother, who has been doing this for decades on my behalf. As an only child, it was wasy for my mom to tack on my name to gifts she had bought for for my relatives. Irene, to her credit, and in spite of an insane work schedule, somehow managed to steer the ship to success. I did help even with the flu. However, now, instead of getting gift cirtificates and such (cause no one knows what the hell to get me anyways), I get things like gift baskets. What the hell is THAT...even Irene's adorable nephew, who is 5, bought me a shaving kit because "I'm always visiting". Actually, i thought that was kinda cool.  Despite now getting "adult" gifts, Irene managed to keep the 12 year old in me quite happy on Christmas with lots of Star Wars and wrestling gifts. And of course, she got me the Ash-Recommended Bose Speakers for the Apt, which is going to get us kicked out of here. I have them at 2, and its blowing the roof off this place.  However, next year I'm going the route of the 5 year old and making lists.  I'm slowly catching up on things, mostly non-music stuff, cause Brandt is out of town till Mid January, so we're on a sorta hiatus. However, Brandt and Robin had a productive initial drum recording session while I was sick. While I have yet to hear, both reported good things from it, Robin in particular was very excited. It was then when I realized that this was out first time recording with her as a drummer!! Well, its about time, yeah? Anyway, Ash reports to me that B left the drum recording set up intact, so we might head in there soon to do some more. Hopefully.  I wish I had more to report, but sadly, the holidays make things crazy quiet. Been catching up on my Asian cinema, and watched the first two INFERNAL AFFAIRS back to back. Awesome stuff, though I'm worried how they will handle the third one.  Anyhoo, I'll be around later  F

      This comes all the way from our new friend Timo, who lives in Berlin, who I mentioned a few posts back about having trouble getting our CD's. Well, looks like he bought himself the entire catalogue! Here's what he had to say (slightly edited)  "hello F.J.  the hypefactor record totally makes my day at the moment. i don't know what to say.....it is such an amazing piece of soulful and of honest music - yeah, this might just sound pathetic but damn, it is without the shadow of a doubt an incredible effort and i wanted to let you know. listening to the ep i really start to think it was absolutely about time that you did something on your own. this is your counterfeit ep. well kinda, but a thousand times better. distracted lover so totally takes me away, this doesn't happen too  often anymore. i am sure i love it as i love the last crack record and man, i truly dig that one.....  i love the hommage to some of the 80s heroes like smiths and new order and just how you turn these so wonderfully around and take out the best from those and give it a 2k3 facelift and throw in all of your honest feelings and thoughts and damn......awesome. i might just not find the right words, F.J., i am sorry. but hey, one thing's for sure. YOU DID IT.  as for the  the aggression material, i almost love flood album as i do love the distracted lover ep, hell it is so mad. there's so many new elements to be discovered that just aren't to be found on the forst two records and i absolutely salute that. it is x times more playful, more versatile, more achterbahn, more  progressive, more of an original sound as on the old ones. i hardly know a band that's joyfully making music industrial-style like YOU, yeah, you hear that all the way thru the album from the first second on, there's musicians at work who do it from the core and from their very hearts. flood has turned out a killer album and you guys deserve a whole fucking lot more recognition (well that's clear anyway, you sure don't need me to tell;-) for your music and your art.  i really like the two old albums as well. i have to say my faves on the debut aggro are the very last track ("permanent" - for its come armageddon, come, come, nuclear bomb - atmo) and the (quasi-hidden) chicago drinking song, that's a fantastic moment. the salvo remix on the remix album is killer as is the cydonia remixis really awesome!  damn, i almost forgot the precious little gem being the deviations single. highly inspired and decently worked out fuck-with-yous, like that one a lot, too. as i mentioned before, i somehow dig the very last remix totally. what  a twisted fucker. cuckooland supreme.  come on, F.J., i want an honest answer, you have been playing with the thought at making a full-length hypefactor album, haven't you?! can't wait for that to happen...."  He's going to be a happy Timo in 2004, I think ;-)  F  PS: 'cuckooland supreme" is the best description of Ash I have EVER heard!

      Sorry, its been so long, but thats not to say there isnt anything exciting going on. Honestly, I'm just happy to be back in NYC for an extended period (maybe 3 weeks max), so two of those weeks are going to be vacation. Brandt, who I think is recording drums right now with Robin, is going back to Chicago, so i will be forced to actually relax and not work on music for a bit. I have a bit of reading to get caught up on, so thats the plan at the moment. However, Leo v23 has been recruited to perform on one of the newer tracks. Dead excited about that one.  Chemlab is officially out on January 27th. It's available for pre-order now, which I was excited to see. I am really looking forward to the reactions that will flood the Chemlab and Acumen newsgroups in the weeks that follow the album's release. I'm supposed to rap with Jared tomorrow, so I should know more about what the gameplan is, etc. for 04. I'm also told he has the new Watts album, and I'm determined to scam this unreleased gem from him.  Speaking on unreleased gem's Chris Connelly, a gentleman if there ever was one, has sent me a copy of his new album NIGHT OF YOUR LIFE, which is quite simply, nothing short of excellent. As I mentioned to Chris yesterday, this new one, co-written and produced by the amazing Chris Bruce, shows Connelly at the height of his vocal and songwriting powers. It's a nice balance between his previous solo work in SHIPWRECKED and his recent album PRIVATE EDUCATION. I know a lot of the kids want him kicking and screaming Revco style, but goddamn I love this man's solo work beyond belief.  Saw Return of The Bing last night and it was quite epic and the filmmaking was excellent. However, as much as I enjoyed it, LOST IN TRANSLATION is still my pick of the year (and probably cost the same amount of the the hobbit's rubber feet in the Lord Of The Rings)  And now, some rest, but more sooner than later...

      Greetings from LA. I hear y'all might have some snow there...just a rumour I've heard while driving around in my convertible.  Not much to report other than I'm working non-stop, but I am happy to say I just got back from seeing THE LAST SAMURAI at Mann's Chinese Theatre (THE best place to see movies here, arclight be damned), and godDAMN was this movie incredible. I don't think it's any secret that I have a love of the Asian culture, and I felt this movie successfully told a great story and respected the world and culture of the Japanese quite well. Cruise was phenomenal as well, mad intense. This is rivalling LOST IN TRANSLATION as my movie of the year (only cause I have yet to see THE BROWN BUNNY). Anyhow, I strongly urge you to see this film. Quite moving stuff.  On music note, has anyone heard the new Die Warzau track, RADIATION BABIES? What a smoking return from one of the all time greats. Keep your ears open for this one.  Irene tells me the new Connelly album is waiting in my mail at home, as if wanting to get home to her wasnt enough, now theres an awesome new CD waiting there. ugh.  And yes, im working on music in the free moments. Listening to the demos and writing words and such. I'd like to think my colleagues have figured out when they are recording drums, but for some reason I doubt it...  And now for some long awaited sleep. Be well all.  F

      Been spending some time hanging out with Irene at home and working on loops for Jared's new project, which I think he would describe as "broken word". He's working with Mark Spyby of Dead Voices on Air, and they've asked me to send them loops and noises and such to work with. I've drafted B into this as well. I've got some ideas flowing, certainly enough to send them in the next few weeks. Dunno anything more about the project than that. However, it's nice to be asked to be a part of it.  My pal Gilez, he of the reknowned Armalyte Industries, was kind enough to send me a copy of his label's latest release: Haloblack's THROB. This version is slightly different than the one I've had for a year or so. The final version has an new track called FEEL which might be the best track on the album. It's fast and synthy and sexy and different for Bryan and co. Honestly, the album needed this as well, as the pacing is a bit on the trip hop side. However, that works for me as I quite like the album. Also, a track I hadn't heard called PERMANENCE towards the end really adds some nice atmosphere to the album. The production is super and the mastering job is top notch. It's "throbbing" out of my new Bose speakers right now (thanks Irene).Of course, the Raymond Watts cameo is always welcome. As I have mentioned elsewhere, I am curious to see how the die-hards respond to it, especially after reading some of the reactions to the Chemlab album (which range from "I love it" to "I like it, but it's not Chemlab").  Grabbed the new CURE box set and was quite pleased with that. The sound is great and while I am a big fan, I didn't own anything on this other than maybe the song from the CROW soundtracks. Therefore, this package is a big win. I'm weird and very unlike my mates with certain bands like The Cure and Depeche Mode in that to me their later years are more interesting to me than the early stuff. I mean, you KNOW Matt Gentile (even if you dont know him) sits around listening to STANDING ON A BEACH and SPEAK AND SPELL while I sit around listening to WISH and SONGS OF FAITH AND DEVOTION, thinking these are the classics. Anyway, this Cure Box has given me an appreciation of those early years and a lot of solid remixes and B-sides from the later years to make me happy. This Box is a winner.  Made a trek out to my birthplace last night in Brooklyn, to check out the 'Face at some club for hipsters. It was an awesome venue, with a large stage and nice sound, and this made very a VERY solid evening of Saintface. Big crowd too. Cheap drinks as well. Two hipsters were dancing next to me. The venue and atmosphere obviously amped the band up quite a bit as they gave one of their best performances I have ever seen. Also, the re-introduction of YOU COULD BE MY SECRET was ace. I wonder if that means its on the album, Peter? Anyway, I think band was in good spirits and always my time spent chatting away with the lads is always welcome. Peter informs me the album is progressing nicely. Oh how I want that album!   After, G and I, with a few pints each in us, ran to a KFC drive through while they were closing and each bought a biscuit. They had no honey, which G was very pissed off about, but they had plenty of butter spread, which i threw at Matt and Jax. All and all a fun evening.  Now I am off to the Isle of Long to watch me drummer in action as we record her for HF2. More later on that.  F

      Vocal demos continued through the weekend, with the heat at the studio going in and out at will. I love NYC. Robin came in to lend her support and spatula as I sang my ass off on tracks like ONENINEFIVESIX and CREATION DAYS (though I might have to write another chorus for that one). This session didn't go as effortlessly as the first session the other day, but Brandt pushed me and pushed me until I hit notes that I never knew I could hit. Again, it's a thumbs up all around from the crew on the lyrics and melodies, which are key. I think Ash will hate the lyrics and melodies, which is usually a good sign in my eyes ;-P  Listened to some more of Robin's drum tracks thus far and I'm quite frankly blown away by what she brings to the tabel. What a musician this girl is! I tell you, she's the shining star on this album. I need 5 more of her. Clone this woman! This weekend, our intention is to get Robin going in earnest on the drums.   Team Obscene (a MOG subdivision consisting of MOGpac members Matt, G, the kidd and myself) gathered last night for the first time in ages to watch some sport and play some vids. Kudos to Matt Gentile for getting me past the VICE CITY board I had been stuck on for an ENTIRE YEAR (i wont say which, for fear of embarassment). And now the adventure (and howling laughter in my home) will continue. Also, my Pac exclusive Christmas presents have gone over quite well with the troops!  An E-mail came in from former Skrew!frontman Adam Grossman today, always a welcome presence in my mailbox. Such a good guy. I think I may have mentioned I saw Skrew more than any other band ever. I think Saintface after this week beats that record believe it or not. Lets toast to both bands.  F

      "As of last fall, I am no longer writing music with nor working in the studio with Ministry. After the last tour- and years of collaborating with Al and everyone else we've worked with-I've decided I need to work on other music . So, I AM working on music right now in my studio in Austin. But don't worry. Distortion Rules." --Paul Barker   So, Barker leaves Ministry. 18 years and a few classic records. While Peter Hook inspired me to pick up the bass and play in that style, the first basslines I learned were Barkers. In fact, the first thing I ever programmed was the drumbeat to Lead Into Gold's FASTER THAN LIGHT. It was he, in the legendary IN CASE YOU DIDNT FEEL LIKE SHOWING UP video, that inspired me to save my money to get myself the Gibson Thunderbird bass that I still play today.  So where does this lead? What exactly IS Ministry now? Was the sum better than the parts? We're going to find out soon as Ministry has a record due out in May. I fear the metal. Paul's Pink Anvil album last year, admitted even by Barker himself as a throwaway, was crap, but again, Barker's Lead Into Gold is probably one of my all time favorite projects EVER. It's no secret my one remaining Holy Grail in music is the lost Lead Into Gold EP called LOW AND SLOW. I'm hoping Barker doesn't stray into metal territory. Actually, I feel the same way about Al. The worst part of this is now the oft-discussed RevCo reunion is now off. That's the true crime.  I hope Al and Paul both continue to entertain us for years to come, but I want to love it the way I did in my youth. Inspire me!  F

      With a big sigh of relief, I re-entered the birdcage yesterday to get back to work on HF2. Sadly, the special guest couldn't make it as his mother was making him a going away dinner (note: hes not living here on this side of the planet any more). However, plans have been made to give him loops and such and he WILL appear on this record. And we need him. He's talented, classy and foreign.  So this left Brandt and I to our own devices and the first thing we did was listen to the rough tracks of the inital drum sessions. I'm happy to say the test run was a success and Robinowitz is well on her way. I have some new ideas on how to push her buttons creatively, and we should be implementing those ideas as well. I have referenced recent Gustavo Cerati live show bootlegs as our benchmark for drum/electronic combos.  So B, knowing in advance I was interested in beginning some vox, had the mic and gear set up. It took till 3 am, but I laid down some scratch vox for THE MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE, SOLAR and what is still called TWO BASSES. This was more to see where my voice is at these days and to see if the melodies and lyrics I had this far for the album worked. Well, Brandt seemed happy with the melodies and lyrics, and hes a fucker when it comes to this stuff, so I think we're at a good point. I'm also happy my voice has gotten stronger with age, or maybe I just know how to use it better. Brandt says I'm hitting 70% of my notes, which for me is a miracle this early in the game.   What will happen now is that I will listen to mp3's of the tracks with vox for a few weeks before cutting the next round of vox. Thats usually when I hit my 95% (the rest is technology at play). But it's off to a good start, and I'm also ready to work out ONENINEFIVESIX and CREATION PHASE as soon as I'm back in the studio.  Happy to report the long awaited REVENGE 2CD set finally arrived yesterday and godDAMN was it worth the wait. I've been living a lie for 12 years as it turns out the entire previously released tracks from their second EP GUN WORLD PORN were all in fact edits and the original versions appear here for the first time ever. Brandt and I almost shit our pants hearing the full version of STATE OF SHOCK (a lost classic). So much of Hook's bass was cut out. Whoever was responsible for that should be killed. Immediately. Anyway, this disc is the best.  I'm enjoying some time at home with Irene and hoping to get into the new Primal Scream bio should I grab a few free moments. Hopefully it's good.  I'm sure we will be discussing Chemlab soon as the album is just starting to get to the kids who pre-ordered. The reactions will be curious.  For the die hards: I have corresponded more with Mark Mohtashemi this week than I have in the past 8 years. I'll let you speculate.  blog blog.  F

      I'm back in NY after a whirlwind week of LA and San Fran. Needless to say, I am quite sleep deprived, but always productive and always plotting and scheming. Of course, things happen, and I try to share them with you.  While on the plane to LA, I finally got the inspiration for lyrics and melodies for the one HF song that was giving me trouble, CREATION PHASE. There's a lot scribbled on paper and I'm actually about to go put it into the computer so it's legible. Then I'll play with it. However, this gave me the confidence to decide it's time to start scratch vocals. We've been incredible slow of late and it's time to kick it into high gear. Everyone is back in the same place, so hopefully we can make some big leaps, especially with the drums and vocals. I know Robin is game. First day back in the studio is tomorrow and I'm hoping we have a special guest in there, as he promises to show up.  Also on the plane flight, I found myself in a sound design mood and started creating some really interesting loops that might lead to the long discussed EK-7 project. This one will be for the "kids", if you know what I mean. However, I have to see if a certain someone knows how to wrap his fingers around a guitar again to see if my masterplan can come to life. We'll be talking more about this later in the year.  Had dinner with my agent/lawyer/advisor and our old friend LeoV23, who was a happy to inform me that his new project, AM PACIFIC, has begun and slipped me a demo. ohhh, I'm a happy boy as Leo usually never fails. He hasn't this time either. It's a continuation of his adventures as Sutra, but it expands on the sound, adding horns and a new female vocalist. He seems quite committed to this as a full time band and you know I'll be the first one checking it out.   Leo was packing a one two punch as he announced, thanks to my encouragement, that he and Krayge are FINALLY going to re-master a V23 best of and put it out this year. He might even get the very cool Warzone Demos on there as well. The versions of BLACK SKY and VALUE on that were mega. I hope they make it on there. I really have to ride Leo to make sure this all happens as I have been bragging on the boards (with Leo's approval) about this. You coldwave kids are in for a treat with this.  Thanks to the ever helpful Mike at Invisible/UI, I finally have a copy of the final real manufactured OXIDIZER in my hands. I am a happy camper to say the least. The mastering, which I hadn't heard and had no idea about, is very very good and the record sounds crisp and punches hard. INV actually spent some money and printed the art on nice glossy paper. Make it feel special. I think its ironic that I first heard the final album in LA as I spent the bulk of my work on the album (loops, listening to mixes, etc) from LA for some reason. Anyway, the chapter is closed and the jury will be decided. I know I can sleep at night loving this album. Despite all the chaos and drama, it was worth it. And a flying V to anyone who doesnt like or get it.   I hoped I would come home to find the two CD Revenge set waiting for me. Sadly, not yet. However, I am dowloading new Ass Cobra Demos. There is a God. I think.  Irene has a friend who has a friend dating Hong Kong star Anthony Wong. This is too much for me to handle. Too much.  I'm sorry to cut this all short, theres more, I think. I just need to get re-adjusted to the cold.  F

      I have to admit, I have been musically unproductive as of late. That's mostly because of the holidays and everyone is scattered, etc. There was a loose gameplan to try and record some more drums this week. The drummer and I were up for it, but Ash didn't feel comfortable doing it without Brandt, and it might have been more of a hassle than productive. Also, one of Ash's many projects, the glitch-y sounding Carbon Framework, which is quite good, has been picked up by a label and he has to rush some material out for a 12 inch. Congrats Ash!   Meanwhile, the musical behind the scenes always keeps me busy. I had my first Chemlab hissy-fit this week, for reasons I can't reveal, but unlike the aggression, where I treat everything like a soap opera, I tried to not be melodramatic about this. Like every album or band, there have been a few hiccups along the way, some I brush aside, others I tackle full on. In the aggression, I'm the "boss" so it means juggling 100 different things. In Chemlab, I'm able to focus more on certain things, while Jared, as "boss" focuses on the many issues. I think my job with Chemlab beyond the music is to give perspective, which is why Mr. Novak suggested my "quality control" credit on the album. I should give Ash or Brandt one of those on Hypefactor, maybe? (no fuckin' way!)  Sadly, but not life-threatening, Chemlab has been moved back 2 weeks. Usually it's time to blame the label, but this time its Caroline's fault. No surprises there. However, this is locked now. February 10th. I'm happy with today's reaction on the Chemlab site to the song BINARY NATION, which started in this very computer. I think this is one the kids will latch on to when they get the album. Very proud of that song. I've gotta learn to keep my gob shut when the narrow-minded dumbasses spuzz their stupid thoughts on the music on the sites. I feel like the defender of the cause. Well, you can't make everyone happy, I understand this, and I know people aren't going to love everything you do, but for fucks sake state the opinion with some intelligence ONCE. We'll get the point. Douches. However, that's just a small portion of the kids. I've beeen getting a lot of nice and well-thought out feedback from people. Even if they don't like it, I like that they really put their minds to it and gave it a fair shot.  Anyway, the point of all this is that OXIDIZER is now available for pre-order. If you're smart, order it via the Hydrogenbar.com site. I'm hoping to have some copies next week, but Mark Mohtashemi and The Kidd might blow gaskets if I don't give them copies soon.   Speaking of Pre-Orders, Haloblack's THROB is also available for pre-order (see www.thesickcity.com for details). I point this out because the album is being released by my dear friend Gilez over in the UK via his label Armalyte (http://www.armalyte.com/). Gilez has come a long way in the few years I've known him. Introduced to me by jared, Gilez put us on his Defcon 1 compilation and then brought the aggression over to the UK in 2001 for the release show. We've remained friends ever since . He's a helluva guy and a good family man. He works hard and it's good to see him being able to release an album of this calibre. It legitimizes him. Gilez and I spent a significant portion of the day yesterday trading secrets and ideas on how to eventually work together. We even laid out the terms of our deal. This could happen 10 years from now for all I know. It's not going to be Hypefactor, and probably not the aggression. But I know what Gilez wants for his label and it meshes with what I'm feeling like doing post-EXIT STRATEGIES. More on this, much later. MUCH.  Been struggling with the passing of a friend this holiday season, but I woke up this morning to a nice letter from a certain keyboardist in a band I have made no secret of adoring. It was a simple note expressing his appreciation for my support of said band. This started things with a smile, so kudos to the keyboardist in question. Made my day!  Off to LA on Monday. Not going to miss this horribly cold weather. Luckily for irene, she's coming out as well, so she can get away from this too. I'm hoping to have Chemlab copies next week, so I'll report in.  Bless  F

      I've been wracking my brain, trying to figure out what my musical BEST OF is for 2003. I'm sorry Ash, but I think I was too busy making music in 03 to focus at the moment. However, i did walk out of 2003 loving stuff I was unfamiliar with like South, Telfon Tel Aviv, Death in Vegas, Andreas Tilliander, and others; unable to stop listening to stuff such as Chris Connelly, Acumen, Christ Analogue, Interpol, Cerati, ILC, and Saintface.  2003 saw the aggression go to Russia and come back just to "split up" again, Ass Cobra was born, Hypefactor was reborn and yet the aggression is the only with a CD coming out anytime soon. Go figure, though 2004 is the 10th anniversary! However, you know who to thank at the cocktail party if that nothing happens to commemorate it.  I saw a career milestone reached as I got to be a part of the Chemlab relaunch, to which I would like to thank Jared, Jason and Jamie for letting me in on that. Hopefully, you will still love me on 27 January when the album comes out.  in 2004 these albums will hopefully own: Chemlab, Telfon Tel Aviv, NIN, Revenge 2cd retro, Ass Cobra, Oasis, and especially Saintface. Oh and maybe this Hypefactor album will come out!  Now for Film:  I wish I never returned to THE MATRIX, but Bryan Singer made X2 a near perfect comics book based movie. I also felt LAST SAMURAI was a huge awesome well of emotion, OLD SCHOOL will be seen as a classic for years to come, but no movie rocked my ass like LOST IN TRANSLATION. Bar none. The Best.  IN 2004, the movies to see will be CONSTANTINE, SPIDER-MAN 2 and HARRY POTTER.  In the world of Hong Kong film, Jackie Chan failed me with the MEDALLION though owned in SHANGHAI KNIGHTS. The INFERNAL AFFAIRS series is amazing, I have a gay thing for Takeshi Kaneshiro from THE RETURNER, and MEN SUDDENLY IN BLACK was one of the funniest films of the year. The loss of both Leslie Cheung and Anita Mui sucked majorly.  in 2004, my money is on NEW POLICE STORY and INFERNAL AFFAIRS 3.  In the world of comic books, nothing rocked harder than pretty much anything that came out of the apple computer owned by Mr. Geoff Johns. His FLASH issue 200 was THE best single issue of a comic book this year (even Wizard magazine agrees). He re-launched my all time favorite comic book TEEN TITANS to much acclaim and success. Honorable mention goes to Jeph Loeb who brought the HUSH storyline to an ok ending, but launched the awesome SUPERMAN/BATMAN series. However, my favorite non superhero book is NEGATION. I love it to death. This could make an awesome movie  I will run to the comic store to in 2004 to buy anything by Mr. Johns, Mr. Loeb (especially his upcoming run with Michael Turner on SUPERMAN/BATMAN), Brad Meltzer's DC Identity Crisis and KISS KISS BANG BANG.  Anyway, If I think of anything more, I'll let you know.  Back to the real world!  F

      Back from LA at last. Seemed like I was gone for a month, but I've returned to a welcoming New York that finally has good weather (certainly better than LA, which rained like a mother the whole time). While I did enjoy some leisure time with the kick ass nephew, it was mostly all work, little play, and a few stolen moments to work on some music.   One of my goals in LA was to nail down the audio portion of MOG-X. This required a ton of effort and attention, but thanks to a certain engineer making my life incredibly easy, I made leaps and bounds with it. This has been a good time, a fun experience, with few cringe worthy moments. The truth will be revealed as to what this all means in May. However when in LA, my mouth got the better of me in certain circles just to gague a reaction to this kind of project. Needless to say it went over well.  My priority however was my HF2 vocals. This means driving around all day and night through LA while blasting the demos in the car. I sing along to the scratch vocals in order to get more comfortable with the material so when we go back to record the final vox, the delivery will be more confident. I find this method works best for me. Also, I refuse to do final vocals until we have the drums tracked, so Brandt made it a priority to send me demos that had both scratch vocals AND live drums tracked. The feel, the dynamic totally changes. Anyway, I feel good about the melodies and lyrics and think I can kick some vocal ass when it's time to do the final vox.  Speaking of live drums, the HF crew had a field day in my absence and had several drum sessions. It seems, and I'm sure that someone will correct me if I'm wrong, the practice sessions recorded on to tape were very helpful to Robin. I can tell you that though I havent been there for the recording of these drums, what is being sent back to me is nothing short of amazing. It seems Ash and Brandt have achieved a great drum sound and well, I don't have to get into how awesome a drummer my girl Robin is. We're almost there!  On my last day in LA, I spent an evening at the home studio of Leo V23 to go through the track he is working on for us, OUR FAITH. It was mostly dissecting the song and getting into mechanics of it, but I did give him Carte Blanche to get all Cerati on this track. I have a good feeling about this.  Meanwhile it seems now that everything is about catching up with the real world. Not a bad thing. The Oscars are tonight and it shocks me that MASTER AND COMMANDER is nominated. I just watched it and jesus was it boring as hell. Awesome acting, great action, but terrible storytelling. A major disappointment.   F  (the title above comes from the enjoyable French racing film Michel Valliant, which I caught in LA. Fun as hell)

      Ok so no drums were actually recorded on sunday. Long story short: the mixer that tom supposedly fixed went on fire about 5 minutes after we set up. Tom Whitfleet, stick to guitars, pally. However, this gave us time to go over the drum parts with Robin. We taped it, so now she can study it and really get deep into it. She's mega. Anyway, I'm off to LA tomorrow so hopefully they will track this while I'm gone. I'm hoping.  The bad mood from that was lessed by an enjoyable WWE title win by Eddy Guerrero. The first thing that company has done right in ages. Now make it happen for Benoit.  Two things have made me laugh: 1. an 8 second mp3 of ash cursing, compiled by Matt Gentile. and 2. this: http://www.taleoftwocities.org/images/bushs_gallo.jpg  My man. I always know Barbra Bush was the hot one! Gallo-style!  F

      Saw South on Friday night who were very enjoyable, enthusiastic and technically awesome. I think they rushed the gig as the sound was a little off, but they have the songs to back it up, so no biggie. South will do nothing in this country simply because they're songs are too intelligent and well-played. But as long as we know them in our own little corner of the world here, its all good. Brandt never showed for this gig because he was too busy working on the album. Now call me crazy, but i don't think thats ever happened in any of my musical projects before. So while he missed a gig, making him a dork, he is dead into the album, which makes him cool. So kudos,  you dork.  Yesterday I learned that Caviar (complete with imported blini) is the best Valentines present EVER. Bar none. Irene and I now also possess a new digital camera. Details as to why and how we own said camera cannot be disclosed at this time. Lou Reed would call this "A Perfect Day".  Things are about to get better as I prep my return to Robin's to continue Drum Tracking today.  The question tonight that Dan Hamill and I need answered is: Can Eddy do it?  F

      I love women. I love my girl, I love my moms, I love the Ro Ro, but i LOVE LOVE LOVE my drummer. Went to the cage this weekend to check out some of the drums recorded thus far for HF2. DAMN! It's awesome. She's a monster skin beatin' babe. The 4 songs she's done so far have gone to a whole new level. And this was just the warm up. More this weekend. I'm dead psyched. Thanks to this woman, this album's getting some balls.  Brandt did some more tracking on OUR FAITH, which is a rocky tune, described to me as Cerati meets Oasis. It rocks. Now, the parts will go to Leo V23 in LA for his contributions. The intention is to meet with him a few times while I am in LA to work with him on the track and to find out what is up with the V23 best of.  Work on MOG-X has finally begun in earnest this week. I'm having fun with this. I've brought in a handsome and knowledgeable young man to help me with some of the visual aspects of this project. I'm working on the audio portion of this project to get it set in motion before I leave for LA next week.  I am not a reality TV guy, but goddammit I do love THE APPRENTICE. YOURE FIRED.

      Just when I think I'm too jaded and that I've seen or heard everything this planet has to offer me, i read this and I become that 17 year old at the Marquee again:  From the New Order website, worldinmotion.net  "Good morning Peter, what is going on Hooky's world today?  PH: Spending lot of time recording New Order new album and at the same time writing songs for my new side project with Mani and Andy Rourke. The name is "FREEBASS" or "STALINGRAD" but still not final."  Besides Episode 3 and a new Batman movie, I now have a new reason to live ;-)  F

      Reeling from the Indy debacle (and I know quite a bit about it what the hell went down with that), Irene and I cabbed it to her fave hipster hang, Piano's to check out some Saintface. They went on extremely late (shades of the aggression's first "headlining" show at Batcave so many years ago), but we had fun hanging out with the lads and having a few pints. I was excited to hear the DJ play some Colder (who right now is the one album everyone in the MOGcamp can agree on). Around 1ish (I think) the 'Face took to the stage and made it all worth the wait. I don't know how much more I can write about my favourite band. It's all been said. During this gig, Peter revealed the album title (don't think I didn't catch that, pally), and they played a new song, the title I don't recall, but another worthy track. Peter is intentionally fucking with me to make the album tracklist a surprise, but I did figure out how it ENDS. You'll see. Irene,  upset she had missed the last show, was dead into the gig and my highlight (lo-light) was Brandt getting his ass verbally kicked by Peter by not clapping to HUDSON AND DAY. What a douche. Brandt, that is. Anyhow, another fun evening topped off by 2am cheese fries with my girl at the Gramercy. Luckily, no sign of Ryan and Parker.  Back in the real world, we made it through cold and rain to the old aggression bunker and current Ass Cobra space (aka Robin's basement) for the latest attempt at recording drums for the Hypefactor album. I won't bore you with specifics, but technical difficulties made for a half frustrating/half productive evening. However, cameos from both Ash and Matt at separate intervals helped ease the pain. Somewhere during all this I learned of a potential REAL band name for Ass Cobra, which Ash created and I think is excellent. Which is why other cobra's will probably kill this. Ash also spun some of his new Carbon Framework material, which I'm totally digging hard. This kid is on fire. Matt Gentile and I discussed the Sisters of Mercy yet again, which for some reason makes me insanely angry that the last time they put a new album out I was still in my teens.  Eventually, we got some drums down for MORNING AFTER and EXIST. I'm dead happy working with Robin, who is a great team player. She really pushes herself and you never get less than 150% from this spatula weilding skin beater. Lucky to have her. Anyway, we still have a lot of drums to do, but I think we've got the set up down and are getting more effective by the day. At this point we have drums down for 4 tracks. I think Brandt will now edit these down and then eventually we will do re-takes so its cleaner and smoother. But finally, a bit of momentum at last. Oh and more buscuits at KFC at 1am!  Also occupying my time is MOG-X. All I can say.  F

      What a shity way to start the day. My dream Summer Trio of films for 2005 (indy, Batman, and Star Wars) is now shot to hell:  "Variety reports that the reunion of Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Harrison Ford for Indiana Jones 4 is on hold again as a new script draft is commissioned. Paramount had hoped to get into production on a fourth film in 2004 for a 2005 release. Frank Darabont had been brought in to script a concept the trio liked, but apparently Lucas wasn't happy with the draft. They will now bring aboard another screenwriter to rewrite Darabont's script.  The trade added that Spielberg had no comment on his plans. Spielberg, Lucas and Ford have been trying for nearly a decade to mount one last Indiana Jones adventure, on the condition that all three had to love the concept and script before proceeding.  Finding an availability window for Spielberg, Ford and Lucas is daunting, and it is now looking like a 2005 production start at the earliest"   RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR  F

      The elements had to smack somebody sometime, so thanks to a fever of 103, Brandt had to bow out of Saturday's drum recording, which effectively killed that. Learning of this only 10 minutes before I was leaving for the session, I was left with a blank day. Now normally I would be a happy lad about a day of hooky, but when one is focused on the initial plan and its killed at the last minute, cranky F comes to the forefront.  However, I got caught up on some reading (new issue of Tape Op, thanks to Irene for that subscription, and Kris Needs' new Primal Scream bio, which is excellent), and wandered about a bit. I stumbled across the new Industrial Nation. Now honestly, I dont like anything industrial any more and I dont think one feature (or the musicians) in the magazine remotely interest me (Give me Al over Ronan any day), I was happy to find both of my bands were reviewed quite favorably. I'm sure these reviews will be quoted quite freely on the respective band sites. This helped the mood somewhat, as did the back cover Underground Inc ad that had Chemlab on it.  Also, arriving on my door that day was the debut album from the french band COLDER, who Irene suggested to me after reading that they were compared to a pop Joy Division and Suicide. Well, that merited a looksee. I'm happy to report the album, AGAIN, is very enjoyable. It's not so much songs as it is moods. The man behind colder is a French-Asian dude who is also a multimedia artist, and Colder is both a film and music project. The package I got had a CD with music and then the accompanying DVD of short films to go with the music. I think the only reason it's musically compared to Joy Divsion is that some of the drum programming is very Stephen Morris like. Plus the artwork is very JD. Cool stuff.  With Irene out running yesterday morning, I popped in my long-awaited copy of the Thai movie ONG BAK, which has been making waves in the Martial Arts Movie circles for some time for it's frighteningly real use of Thai boxing moves in a Martial Arts Movie setting. The star, who is also the co-writer of the film, Phanom Yeerum had been described to me as someone who could fight like Bruce Lee and fly like Jackie Chan. Now, you know I don't accept shit like that lightly, so I went out of my way to check this movie out. Needless to say, the movie itself is totally underwhelming and cliche, but the fighting is the scariest I have ever seen on film. Ever. Thai boxing is an exceptionally brutal sport and this film captures that brutality in a way that makes you scream with delight while also cringing for the life of Phanom Yeerum as well as his poor stuntmen. It was scary good. The DVD bonus of watching them put these fights together is even scarier and better than the fights in the movie!! And yes he can flip and fly like Jackie and fight like Bruce, though he lacks the charisma of both. However, this dude is probably in a shit mood after being kicked in the head so many times. He's basically the ECW version of Kung Fu.  To me, the key will be to bring Phanom Yeerum to Hong Kong and put in a movie where an experience director and fight chroegographer can maximize that potential in a well made movie.If that happens and it works, the new era of fight cinema starts with this guy.

      So, Irene and I made the trek to a midtown Manhattan movie theatre to see a special preview of HELLBOY, the large motion picture based on the Dark Horse Comic. Believe this or not kids, I have never one in my life read a copy of this comic. Therefore, I was going into it fresh, with nothing to compare it to. Needless to say, I was impressed, especially with the first half of the movie. The set-up is great and the actors are super, especially Ron Pearlman as the title character. To be able to create a sympathetic and likeable character with all the make-up and gear on really blew me away. I love the character, I love the set up, and it’s obvious that the director loves this comic more than anyone. It’s exceptionally well-directed and the FX are top notch. However, the third act seems rather anti-climatic, similar to how I felt about SPIDERMAN, but I like these characters and are invested in them and want them to win at the end. That takes a lot these days, but it just needed that one kick ass moment at the end to put it over for me. So, in retrospect, HELLBOY gets a big thumbs up and I hope to follow more of his adventures.  CLONE WARS Season Two and while I loved it, especially since it’s starting to lead to the schism between Obi-Wan and Anakin, I loved it even more watching the first 10 episodes in a row with 5 Year Old Cousin who could be my Clone. This led to much playtime and web searching for Birthday presents for him. I think he will be quite happy with his Republic Gunship.  Thanks to one of the web savvy rivet kids (this time, its Aero), I just heard 5 tracks off of the new Skinny Puppy album THE GREATER WRONG OF THE RIGHT. Well, I’m happy to report it’s really super stuff. It takes the best of it’s two main principals, Ogre and Key and plays to each of their incredible strengths. The production is incredible and Ogre’s vocals are amazing. It’s actually similar to his solo material. When he works with Mark Walk, he’s usually either very straightforward in his delivery or Walk goes Pro Tools crazy on him. This works on the solo stuff, but no one knows how to get the best out of Ogre than Cevin Key. While I feel there are elements and sounds that go back to the old Puppy days, I feel this is very contemporary. It reminds me of RABIES era done in a modern style with better programming. It’s a big step forward from THE PROCESS, which remains one of the most underrated albums ever released. Yes this has guitars, but not in the way THE PROCESS had them. A great comeback and I’ve only heard 5 songs!  If Watts, Ministry, NIN and Die Warzau can live up to the Puppy album, The I-Rock old guard is gonna clean house this year. Now where are the kids!? Who’s next! Come on.  F

      While I don't have anything specific to report, I will just jot down my thoughts today:  1. Running into Joe Saintface yesterday on the subway was an enjoyable experience. Two bassists in mid album on the N train train complaining about their bandmates is the best way to ride down to Union Square.  2. Jackie Can V Donnie Yen Part II. Jackie and Donnie will have their second on-screen throw down in the TWINS EFFECT 2, the sequel to last year's surprisingly fun movie popcorn movie starring HK chick pop duo Twins. Jackie V Donnie Part I was in the extremely awesome SHANGHAI KNIGHTS, but the fight was too short (something I have told the director repeatedly) and I was left wanting more. Hopefully this will deliver. Jackie Chan's SON, in his 20's, is the male lead of this movie which scares me and makes me feel incredibly old. It was almost 20 years ago when I was doing a Jackie Chan fanzine speculating that he might have a wife and child. Sure enough, I was right!  3. Skinny Puppy's new album is released in May. I am cautiously optimistic. I feel deep inside that it will be awesome, but I feel it will not be for the diehards. Good I say. Bands need to move forward. These are not the same men we knew 10 years ago. However, they are no less talented than what they were. However, including the douche with the bad hair from Static X on a track is the first red flag. I hope I'm far away from Ash when this album comes out.  4. Meanwhile, Eric Powell has caused the industrial version of 9/11 with a vicious email to a rivet fan who is not so happy with Eric's direction with his new band, Ringer. Granted, he was provoked by this kid. The intial Email wasn't exactly Roger Ebert quality in terms of it being a well-constructed commentary, but to respond like that wasn't the coolest thing to do either. I understand Eric's need to branch out musically, I personally don't like the new music at all, but what i dont understand why Eric, according to his E-mail, walked away from so many record and management deals? Everyone's circumstance's are different, granted, and it's certainly not my place to speculate. Eric's put out some great music, but I think cooler heads should have previaled. Eric's frightening dismissal of the 16 Volt legacy post-WISDOM is more shocking and disappointing to me than any of this.   5. Meanwhile, on a better note, I heard some demos by a well established I-rock band who many love and have been hoping for a "return to form" from for many years. What I have heard thus far ranks in the "so far so good" in terms of harkening back to an older style that they made famous. It will certainly be the best thing they have done in ages and one new song in particular might be one of their best ever. Stay tuned. Thanks to you know who for hooking me up with that.  6. This I just read on Cracknation.com and it pisses me off to high heaven. It's regarding the second album from one of my favorite new bands, Defragmentation (who recently did an awesome remix for us): "Well...unfortunately...Martin has decided to sideline this release until more copies of Self Construct are sold.  Which means, this album may never get released, unless a resurgence in popularity of their 1st disc occurs (considering the zero promotion that it was given...well, I'm not expecting it).  Jeff's contractually bound to Underground Inc as well, so this really fuckin blows...he's pretty much stuck. " To say this angers me is an understatement. It's a bullshit excuse from a label that needs to be developing young talent and supporting established acts (READ: CHEMLAB, ACUMEN) that can actually make money for the label if they had the proper resources. I could write a book on this, just based on the past year of OXIDIZER, which has taken a large toll on me professionally and personally. Bullshit. You wonder why the "scene" is dead. Dumb.  7. Rumours abound that the new Episode of Star Wars will either be called "RISE OF THE EMPIRE" or "THE CREEPING FEAR". Gee, which one of THOSE suck?  8. In other Star Wars news, season 2 of CLONE WARS starts tomorrow. Bring it!  9. My dentist cleaned my teeth the other day with COOKIE DOUGH flavoured cleaning stuff. He also has full INTERNET and CABLE while you are actually IN THE CHAIR. He is also worried about my manager/agent/advisor and thinks she is "all over the place". She's been his patient for years and he just figures this out now? Also, he has robbed Dan Hamill of thousands of dollars. So thanks to Dan Hamill, I can blog while getting my teeth done. This to me is the greatest.  10. I'm REALLY glad i didn't go to Wolfsheim.  Bonus Musing: I wish Matt Gentile posted more.  I'll tell you about HELLBOY tomorrow.  F

      so there we were, the douche, the superstar and the recently legalized girlfriend, at Citizenfest '04.  after seeing way too many people on line outside and in the club that were totally not on my list of must-sees in the remainder of my lifetime, the show began.  actually, after seeing people i'd prefer to never see again on line outside, followed by an anal intrusion by webster hall "security", and then seeing more people i'd prefer to never see again once inside, we waited...and then the show began.  i guess it was close to 11p when the two german boys and their computer, collectively known as wolfsheim (that's pronounced VOLFS-hime for those who don't understand that the german language does not allow for a *sh* sound), took to the stage.  the show was a good mix of new songs (which i don't own) and fan/club-floor faves.  some history - the douche and i flew to germany for DOOMSDAY in august 2000 to see these guys in dresden (yes, there was a skinny puppy reunion at the festival, but we were already investigating the trip before we found out that fact).  this was back in the day when he and i would take over any venue that was lucky enough to have us show up.  and dresden, berlin and munich were no exceptions to that fate.  was i impressed by their first performance in nyc ever?  no.  was i entertained?  sure.  thoroughly.  the boys got smart in the past few years because they took a page out of de/vision's book by adding a live guitarist and drummer to the tour.  oh...did i say de/vision, i meant depeche mode (but i actually hate dm mit drums...definitely prefer dm sans drums - i can argue this with frank til i'm blue in the face).  they used the new live act primarily on the new stuff but added it, appropriately i feel, to some of the older tracks that really rocked out with the live feel of real drums.  case in point was 'heroin, she said'.  if you know the track, you know the chorus has a great breakbeat type drumline - normally lost when using synth-drums, but powerful with an actual person behind a kit.  other highlights, for me, included 'lovesong' (not a cure cover), 'sparrows...' and 'real'.  the point in the show which made me want to walk out was, of course, the final song of the evening...the last song of the second encore...a song which apparently "gives them touble in germany" - 'once in a lifetime'.  i used to pop for this song like it was martin l. gore singing an acoustic 'dressed in black' at jones beach.  but watching the citizens on parade as they recall the song from their like-new copy of metropolis' release of spectators (four years after the album came out, fyi)...i was almost disappointed.  it was an obvious closer...but still left me with an awkward, uncomfortable feeling - very similar to the once i received walking into the venue by a mark phingers-esque looking cro-magnon bouncer.  indeed.  all in all - a fun evening.  i learned a few things that night.  i learned that citizens can find true love, if you look for it in a basement in franklin square, li.  i learned that a good talking to could instill the fear of god in someone.  and most importantly, i learned that i never want to attend another citizenfest again.

      Well, I'm still coming down from the Wrestlemania experience. First, hats off to Matt Gentile, who, despite trying to swerve me into thinking he had accidentally burned one of the tickets, really came through big time by getting us 4 excellent seats at MSG. All for, as Dan Hamill would say GRATIS (though he would say it GRATIAS). The show itself was a blast, the crowd was fun and we saw some super wrestling. In particular, Chris Benoit pulled off the big one and  really made the evening special with his big win. Also, in the surreal part of the night, Brock Lesnar, the Next Big Dumbass, was booed out of the building. How stupid is this guy to walk away from the sport that made him tons of money and a star to boot? He's young and will regret this decision. Instead of being the next Kurt Angle, he's for now, the next Ultimate Warrior. He'll be back. Watch.  Anyhow, before all this Mania, I spent my Saturday in a German bar drinking with G and Matt, and later Ash. Also, we ate potato pancakes and "cupcakes". This was a good time, nay, a great time. It reminded me of our days abroad. However, the drinks took their toll and after a wine filled dinner with Irene, I found myself drunkenly harrassing tourists in Times Square. Man, that was embarassing, but Irene got a kick out of it and thats enough for me. Then we hit Broadway and saw AVENUE Q, which is amazing and hilarious. SEE THAT. Broadway is in an excellent phase right now with plays like WICKED and AVENUE Q that are very commerical, yet artistic, clever and entertaining. I hate musicals, but I love those.  I have to tease you with some info. A certain pal of mine, known in many circles musically, has reported via a mate that he has contributed to a certain album that will kick major ass this year. I didnt even know these guys were DOING an album. The I-kids are going to be pleased as punch.  F

      Last night the Factor Corp. gathered for the first time in ages for the next round of drum tracking for HF2. It was a well-coordinated operation. Ash, who has a car, would bring the gear, Brandt would set it up, Robin would play the drums and me, well I get to hang out with my mates and have Ash drive me to Wendy's. I don't do much, though I did read a great interview with John Taylor in THE FACE. Ash and I discussed wrestling on the way to Wendy's. Brandt has the drum set up down to a science so the set up time is now under an hour. Impressive to say the least. I know it sounds like I do little, but mostly my job is to comment if something ISN'T going right or if I don't like swhat's going on. Happily, I've had to pull very few of what I call "Executive Decisions" on this album, which to me only reminds me that my true skill is finding the right collaborators to make music with. I don't miss the aggression on days like this! ;-)  We had an agenda of 4 songs: OUR FAITH, THE THE MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE, LENINGRAD (formerly known as Two Bass), and THEME FROM PROPAGANDA. Ash claimed we'd get 1 done, I said 2 at best. Lo and behold a certain drummer did her homework and hit a grand slam and knocked all 4 out of the park. Big time. B reported to me this morning that she was dead on most of the time and very little editing will be required. I love this woman. She just makes my life so much easier.   So now the next steps are as follows: B goes to Chicago for a week and immerses himself in edits, which he will be sending me as he progresses. In the meantime, I continue working on melodies, singing along to the demos, etc to get into shape. Hopefully, when B returns I'll be ready to sing and sing like a mother. However, I'm going to take my time with this and not rush it.   Meanwhile, following up my previous entry, Matt Gentile has TRULY earned his Superstar nickname and has obtained 4 tickets for Wrestlemania at Madison Square Garden this Sunday. How he pulled this off was pure genius and totally legal to boot, so to say I'm impressed is an understatement. Dan Hamill has not been this excited since Bon Jovi released NEW JERSEY. I think we will be attending Wrestlemania in suits. 4 Classholes out on the town!  F

      Sorry it has been some time since I posted last, but an attempted graduation and HF2 have swamped me for the past few months. Consider this a bid to be a bit more disciplined, as there will be a lot to say in the next few months, and not all of it about factor.  Speaking of...  Yesterday Robinowitz, F and I spent the evening on Long Island (out of necessity, not choice) for what will be our second-to-last session of live drum recording. Ash dropped off the gear, made a run to Wendy's and trashed some '80s music before taking his leave, although we begged him to stay. After a whirlwind setup, we tackled four tunes: "The Morning After The Life Before," "Our Faith," "Theme From Propaganda" and "Leningrad" (formerly known as "Two Basses," and there's a free drink at KGB in it for anyone who can figure out the origin of the new title.)  F wrote extensively here about the devolution of our earliest drum sessions into logistical nightmares, the worst of which was the electrical blaze that temporarily retired Ash's mixing desk. Honestly, the first five or six sessions were total pains in the ass, between moving gear out to Long Island, moving  ourselves  out to Long Island, scheduling idiocy, incompetent parts suppliers and missing gear.   But yesterday's session (and the two previous - one with Ash and Robin and one with Robin alone) was, in a word, effortless. For the first time, we made it through the full schedule of songs for the evening (with time to spare for homemade biscuits.) Robin's playing was spot-on; I spent this morning at the Cage listening to her playing without any EQ or compression, and it was striking to hear how few edits would be required on the tracks. "Theme From Propaganda" is now a storming funk tune - house music played by a live band (which just might be disco, right?) - while "Leningrad" is Gustavo Cerati's Ocio project playing folk music. Nice stuff.  "Creation Phase" is undergoing a major overhaul at the moment thanks to prodding from Robin and Ash, although it probably will not be complete until well into April. During a tracking session for this tune and "Solar" in mid-February, we ran into problems with a rhythm arrangement for the bridge, and Robin and Ash basically said the song's second half was shit. I do not always agree with Ash, but he was dead-on right; I'd had reservations about the bridge for some time myself, and they validated that. The next week Robin and I tracked a drum part for the "new" bridge that, when complete, will mark the first time this band has written around the drummer, rather than loops. When this tune emerges from maintenance, expect it to be leaner and meaner. The meanest song on the LP, in fact, when F's vocals are complete.  A slew of gigs are coming up that I am hoping will be brilliant: Death Cab For Cutie at Irving Plaza, Squarepusher at Irving and The Rapture and Black Rebel Motorcycle Club in a double headlining bill at Roseland. And, were that not exciting enough, The Twilight Singers return for a Warsaw gig at the beginning of April. More on that later.  I know this is a few weeks late, but... Danny: I'm sorry about Scarlett. Benicio's a douché.

      Oh Darling, you know I've not forgotten you. It's just that while I live a fun life, there's only so much you can write about without boring the reader. I mean, how much can write about my excitement about Groovie Mann joining RevCo? I sincerely doubt you'll want to hear me discuss my views on Wrestlemania (though if Matt Gentile gets us into the show, he will truly be a MOGsuperstar). I doubt you want to hear about the large amounts of sushi Irene and I downed tonight.  Anyway, things are moving along here. I saw alleged members of the MOGpac at Ash's Birthday gathering the other night and this was a partial treat. It was good to catch up with the RJ's of the world (RJ is my bizarro twin in the life of Ash who happens to be an excellent musician and Ash's writing partner in the world of electronic music), and it was good to see Ash in good spirits. It was also a good opportunity to thank Ass Cobra bassist Charles from saving those bitches from a life of aggression covers (this is a JOKE). However, the absence of both Matt Gentile and the Kidd was felt, though, as the MOGpac lacked its heart and soul, respectively.  Meanwhile, we enjoyed STARSKY AND HUTCH for its homoeroticism (had to see it with G) and hated JERSEY GIRL for its hetroness. Affleck is just flat out lame and Kevin Smith disppoints as a director as he ages, though I am excited he is writing and directing THE GREEN HORNET.   I think I've seen Saintface a few times since we've last spoke. Again, full on. They take the stage on Long Island for the first time this Friday. I fear for them as I have been on many a Long Island stage and rarely has it been enjoyable. Anyway. Saintface. Impressive, ok but where's the album. Well, my gossip is as follows. It's just been reported to me that a certain lead singer from said band just walked out of The Birdcage with a keyboard belonging to certain lead singer who is typing this. Something about "strings" and then "mixing". Stay tuned.  I work daily on my vocals for HF2. It is a slow process, more based around developing the feel for each track. I sing along quite a bit. Thursday there will be more drum recording. This excites me as we are so close. I can't wait to get this album back into the studio where I can get into a routine.  In the world of I-Music, i discuss further work with Jared though nothing set in stone at the moment. I have to send some loops in for his project with Spyby. Hope they like what we did. LeoV23 writes to inform me that progress is being made on the V23 retro CD. there might possibly be a new song that they will finish for this release. I have begged to remix. My agent/manger says I have become the industrial Ryko-disc guy.  In the meantime, I remain happily domestic. I watch wrestling and Teen Titans, I play RISE TO HONOUR, which is making me mental, and I occasionally buy my girlfriend things for our kitchen. I find myself listening to Chris Connelly's new project EVERYONED and enjoying it immensely. I am looking forward to reuniting with the MOGpac spinoff group Team Obscene to watch Mania this weekend and I am dead psyched about Irene and I seeing Avenue Q on Broadway this weekend.  And then there's the cinematic side of my life, which I can never speak of, though many of you would love to hear. I did get a CONSTANTINE crew jacket, which is nice as hell. 8 years of script notes and all I got was this jacket (and a possible cameo in the movie). Anyhow.   I will report back to you soon about more drums, my new cel phone, and other assorted goodies.  F

      This warm and sunny morning started off with a chance run in on the corner of 17th and Park Avenue with the wonderful Robin, who as I learned in this brief time spent with her, is quite "busy and jangly". Where I'm from, these are good things, but obviously not in certain dim places. I always enjoy my time with my multi-talented bandmate and friend. If I can take one thing from this conversation, which included everything from comparing ipods to discussing school and New Jersey, it is that I wish the aggression a long eternal slumber in the annals (not anals, Dan Hamill), of history. See my previous post regarding "missing being in a band". I'd rather go back to High School, or maybe early college cause there were girls then. Anyhow, in the words of Greg Dulli, actually some French chick he recorded...goodbye motherfucker.  Onward, Ho's.  Then next time I checked email, I received this epic from a fan, who after much praise for the Chemlab album, writes:  "Alright, this was not the original intention to write this message to you, it was because of the Hype Factor EP which is just not leaving the "right-next-to-the-stereo-pile", I'm not even thinking about putting it on the "2nd-next-pile", no f'n way. I'm still caught in the beauty of it. I have told you before, it's true and by the time you might have gotten tired of people telling you such BUT, F.J, it is such a won-der-ful record, simple as that. Also, I recently discovered I never saw the beauty lying in your voice before this effort? I've tried a dozen times to write this sentence without it sounding so damn gay but I failed, can you xqs me? I maybe miss the appropriate words (no native speaker here, sorry) but damn it's such an honest effort, I can onnly presume this was the most personal piece of music / lyrical work you've ever done? By the way, "thieves" (which I'm sure isn't only my favourite on "the distracted lover") made it right into my all-time-favourite-achy-breaky-sour&sweet-luv-tunes-ever". What an amazing, amazing song. Thank you so much, F.J., I msut be getting repetitive, excuse me, but you know, I kinda had to let you know. Again."  Well, if I know the new album will sell ONE copy, here's the dude that will buy it. This letter makes everything we do worth it! And no I haven't grown tired of people telling me that they love DISTRACTED, the problem is, the only person who tells me that is Brandt! ;-)  This could be a good day.  F

      My Significant Other, a fine woman, ventured via Chinatown bus (the in thing to do, and extremely cheap) to DC to check out Neubauten. She and her friend Lauren have a Neubauten tradition where they get drunk and check out a few of their gigs. Personally, having seen them perform once before many of you were in nursery school, I think getting drunk and watching them is some form of torture. Not to say I don't appreciate them. As Dan Hamill put it: "It doesnt matter what the tradition is, its just good to have tradition" I, being someone who has never seen Greg Dulli perform while being sober because of "tradition" (with the exception of that one Pigface related incident which you can read here somewhere) cannot argue, especially in light of my recent actions in Brooklyn (see previous entry re: Twilight Singers at Warsaw).  Anyhow this was the first time Irene has gone out of town since she moved in. It's usually me leaving for LA and her staying here, but it was shocking to see how quickly I regressed to being a 15 year old again. When I wasn't working, I was either buying or watching Kung-Fu movies, playing videogames, reading comics, surfing the web (more ebay shit), eating unhealthy, and playing music at indecently loud levels. This was all done in the company of either Evan, G or both.  Though I have to admit, it was fun watching the directors cut of WRATH OF KHAN and reciting the dialogue for G and Ev during the entire movie. However, I missed being an adult!  Ok so then, mostly out of obligation to my non music profession, Evan and I went to check out THE PUNISHER late Friday night. I don't know what I did to piss off God, but making it throught his movie earns me the right to change my second initial to Jesus. Everyone involved with this movie should be shot, especially Travolta (who should fire EVERYONE who works for him NOW for letting him do this piece of crap). Poor Thomas Jane. He's a nice man who was right for the role but was saddled with a script that was seemingly re-written to be as shitty as possible.  Someday, THE PUNISHER will be taught in a classroom (probably by me) about how NOT to make a comic book based movie. Utter shit.  We were saved somewhat the next day when me and my two pals went to check out KILL BILL VOL.2. I don't think it's any secret that I am not a big fan of the first volume. I thought it was predictable, not too clever, and the action was so-so. Overcritical? Yes, of course, as its QT going onto my turf of Asian Cinema. Anyhow, Volume 2 is a very enjoyable film that is tight and fun, character driven and filled with great action. IN particular, the throwdown between Uma (looking better than ever) and Darryl Hannah (looking scary as fuck) was excellent. Also, Vol 2 made perfect use of Gordon Lui and Michael Madsen, which is what I really needed from this movie.  OK, QT, now save Travolta again and go make the Vega Brothers!   Meanwhile, my Ebaying has gone totally overboard. I have won a dozen Jackie Chan photobooks and two stunt crew tshirts. It's very weird that this has all kicked in, though I think it has to do with the fact that JC has just turned 50. FIFTY! I remember being a kid and him approaching 30 and thinking that he was only going to make 3 more movies or something. JC, despite that my girlfriend has to wake up every day and stare at a wall of JC pix and posters, is still the man!  F

      Again, it what seems like a decade, the main Factor principles of Brandt, Ash, Robin and myself gathered for the first official HF photo session. Correct me if I'm wrong, but this band in its short lifespan has yet to have an official photo. Everything you have seen so far, including the pix in the DISTRACTED sleeve come from other sources (ie. videos or candid shots). Sadly, despite my begging and pleading, Peter Saintface bowed out; most likely to prep rough mixes for me to hear (HINT). Meanwhile, Brandt enlisted his friend Kathie-Rose (forgive me if I've spelled your name wrong) to take said shots. Thank God this nice girl has the patience of a saint to deal with us.  A few days earlier while planning this, Ash had a smart idea to put us to work in the studio as we are all rarely in the same room at the same time. Based on that, Brandt, as usual, smartly did the homework and had everything ready and waiting for us. This evening would also give Robin the opportunity to hear some of her drum work for the first time ("wait, I played on that?"), and for Ash to review his basslines from 2 weeks ago that we all love ("eh, I'm not feeling it").   Though we all agreed on our love for the new bridge in CREATION PHASE and Brandt, in one his "Ideas that F.J. thinks is stupid when he first hears it but is later proven wrong" told us we would have to write a new outro to the song in a different key because that new bridge ended in a different key. I, of course, was like "that's stupid", but thats what I always say. However, then we got it going. As usual, the mandate of pushing these songs forward is proven to be successful as the new outro is awesome and allowed me to get some cool "F.J. bass" in there. The song BLOWS up at the end. I'm loving it.  For every great moment like that, there's some frustration. On another song, SOLAR, we decided to have Robin re-track her chorus basslines against her new drums. This proved tough. What she originally had was a very simple line that I felt drove the song perfectly, but Ash felt there could be more to it in a "dub" sorta way. After Robin's many attempts, Ash took over for awhile, but he couldn't quite crack it either. I think we all liked where he was going, but it just wasn't getting there. Honestly, I think we should go back to the simplicity of the original bassline, but we have to at least explore every angle before committing. We owe these songs, and each other, that much.  During all this, Kathie-Rose, took what seemed like a million photos. She's very sweet, very cool, but I think was upset to learn that Ash, Robin, and I all hate The Pixies. What was interesting was that after 10 years on and off working together, Ash and I didn't realize that we both hated them. I was convinced he loved them and he thought I loved them. EH! BOTH WRONG. This was a big bonding moment, for Ash, Robin and I. We spent a good half hour RAILING on The Pixies. Enjoy the reunion, Brandt!  Anyway, the evening ended late with Kathie-Rose taking more "band" shots. I think she coulda kept going all night taking pix, but my crew was getting cranky so we called it a night. FULL SUCCESS.  During this, I realized the only thing I miss about the aggression was the comraderie of being in "the band" with my friends. However, after hearing tales about certain mates other bands and the drama and high school kiddie shit that goes on within their unit, I was suddently quite happy to just have a "project" that is evolving into a band that will only have people who WANT to make the best possibly music they can.   Music should be the escape FROM the drama of the everyday, right?  In other news, I have regressed to my 15 year old self once again and I'm suddenly buying rare Jackie Chan movie programmes from Japan. These highly collectable books were my teenage obsession, but my collection was far from complete. On a whim, and encouraged by my significant other, I went on Ebay only to find that two places in Japan have unloaded TONS of them. So far I have yet to lose an auction, but I doubt the rent will be on time, especially now that I've found someone selling Jackie Chan stuntcrew Tshirts (I have the ORIGINAL from the early 80's!). I'm in trouble to say the least.  In news beyond everything, in a rare NYC appearance the other night, Bradley J. Fox, fresh from his travels to Paris, Capetown and Bucharest, announced that he and his Wife Dee Dee are expecting their first small Cramp. I feel this child will kick much ass and now I must concede my LA digs to this small baby. My request for bunk beds for the forthcoming infant and I was denied. Luckily, Agent/Manager/Lawyer has an extra bedroom just for me. Irene and I are inching closer to bi-costalness, i think...should know more this summer.  F

      The weather suddenly gets good and things get going here! First off, my laptop is back and to make a long story short, when upgrading to OSX, something went wrong and I wiped out EVERYTHING I have ever done in this laptop. Let's not use words like "backed up" or "saved", ok? Needless to say, thanks to the geniuses at DRIVESAVERS, I have all my erased files and I am significantlly lighter in the wallet. However, now my computer is running super amazing out of control awesome. Though I have no music software at the moment.  However, we have some amazing stuff brewing for this new album. Ash's bass playing is incredible on MORNING AFTER and the bridge we wrote for CREATION PHASE was looped over and over again when I spent my Saturday at the studio.  Before all this, Mr. G, Brandt, and I checked out the face in Brooklyn, just a block away from where my mom grew up. This venue, Southpaw, is the bestfor Saintface.They thrive there. Memo to the guitar player: Dont punch your guitar after the first song unless you have a backup guitar, pally. Just sayin.  Morrissey has often failed me in his solo life. I have yet to enjoy myself at any of his solo gigs that I have been to. His last album was utter shit. Saintface, who I have described as "what Morrissey wishes his solo career was" has my heart in recent years when it comes to music. However, he is always forgiven. I will buy his new album and already spent way too much money on tickets for his gig next month. I have to admit, I'm enjoying the Morrissey comeback. We live in an age where we DO need someone like Morrissey to be, ahem, our frank role model. Reading his intelligent and witty criticisms of our world in the NME this weekend made me smile. However, the SPIN article was terrible. Not because of him, but because SPIN is the worst music magazine pretending to be cool I have ever read. Put Peter Saintface on the cover and maybe I'll by it again.  I think the first photo session for HF2 is this week. Maybe Thursday. I'll keep you posted.  F

      Things post-laptop problems are starting to get back to normal a little bit. I still don't have my laptop back, but the initial shock of what I did to it (another time) has worn off. Again, I credit Irene for keeping me sane. However, my IPOD took a dive on Friday, which now makes me feel quite jinxed. This led to some time back at Apple in Soho, but the situation was saved by "the IPod genius". Also, thanks to Brandt, I was able to get 1500 or so songs, including some very rare ones BACK into my Ipod within a few hours. A minor crisis saved. Frustrated, Irene and I spoiled ourselves with an evening at Jules, a wonderful French place on St. Marks.  Post dinner, we spent some brief face to face time with Peter Saintface, who was in good spirits and certainly enjoyable to chat with. He now has his songs for this album and I expect we're going to get some greatness out of him!  The next morning, I was feeling refreshed, so I ran to the studio early  to work on more bass and surprisingly, Ash was only an hour and a half late. He had issues with the basslines in MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE. His belief was that while what I played in the song worked for it, it was more of my typical "hook style" bass playing than it was rythmic. Repeated listenings to the song confirmed this to me. Instead of me doing it myself, I suggested Ash record it as he was the one who pointed it out and obviously had been thinking about it. Also, my other motive, no pun intended, was to get him more invested in the song from the bass side, as he will be the live bassist.  Needless to say, it was interesting to watch him work. I've only jammed with him on songs as opposed to putting him in front of me, as a producer, and having him work out a part. Instead of full sections, he worked the chorus out a few measures at a time; eventually writing one longer piece. It's very mathmatical, very detailed, very technical and very successful. It was totally fascinating. I've worked with the guy for years and he still comes up with new ways to puzzle me. After I left, I believe the two of the laid down the rest of that song.   Then, Ash, Brandt and I reworked the bridge to CREATION PHASE, a section that had been troubling everyone in the group, except me of course. Brandt had a vision for this and even tracked Robin playing some random drums based on what he had heard in his head. When I heard the drums earlier in the week, I dismissed it as being too MARCH OF THE PIGS, but when he edited them into the song and presented a guitar part, it was very obvious that this was more akin to The Who. And this is NOT a bad thing. Ash played bass and I played   a quick Hook-style lead over this bridge and we hammered it out in what seemed like 3 minutes. It's awesome. I dream of it. I'm happy. In my old age, I've gotten good at letting my collaborators push the songs a bit to make things better. I've become less stubborn and am going to have a much better album because of it.  Later, while shopping on 5th Avenue with Irene and Dan Hamill, we ran into Robin and her man Damon. It was a birthday, so Happy Birthday to the best bandmate I've ever had! We discussed the real band name for ass cobra, which led to Mr. Hamill making a wisecrack that we will get tons of mileage out of. See you at Golden Unicorn, bitch!  The evening was capped off with a screening of THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, which should be huge, but won't be, but was nonetheless enjoyable. The kids in the movie, in particular one of the sidekicks (who Irene has dubbed the new John Cusak), really carried it. And the presence of AJAX from the Warriors, James Remar, never hurts.  I spent Easter immersed in all things Clone Wars. And speaking of Jedi, I ran into the star of my NYU senior thesis film, SUBURBAN JEDI, this morning. HIs name is Kosak, I love him and it was good to see him. He is strong with the force, still, especially if he moves to France. So jealous.  Note to self: Plan vacation!  F

      It's been an incredibly stressful week thanks to my totally screwing up my laptop while trying to upgrade my powerbook to OSx. I've been through too much with this, so I dare not explain. However, massively public kudos to my significant other for handling my "suicide watch" with a nice dinner at Wonton Garden. If my computer is salvaged, I will post in depth as to what happened and why and how. As for now, fuck it.  Brandt has gone on in depth in my recent absence regarding certain events and for once he is mostly accurate. The session with Ash was fun and to hear the edited drums for the first time really got the adrenaline pumping. It made me want to get this record out next week, but sadly there is still work to be done.  As for The Twilight Singers gig, my memories, based on copious amounts of Sake, Beer, Gin and Tonic and the DREADED Jagermeister are as such: the gig was too short (in my drunken mind it was a half hour), they played no Whigs songs (they played several), and Dull is, well, a fat fuck. I supposedly screamed this loudly. This is my attempt at being more "British." Also, I recall me and my friends huddled and hopping up and down singing along, which also means we have seen too many British people at gigs.  Last night we checked out the always impressive Saintface. They were fun and energetic and peter's CONSTANT abuse of Matt Gentile from the stage was super fun ;-) Before I start bitching about their album not being done, they ARE doing rough mixes now before bringing a mixer in, so they are in good shape. I am also told that I will be lucky enough to hear these rough mixes. Peter if you're reading, PLEASE don't forget me, Ill even give you NO notes at all so i don't fuck anything up ;-)   Also, Peter needs to watch out for crazy Goths dancing in front of the stage. HEY, this aint Joy Machine, sister!!  Saintface opened up for a band called Blondes, Inc. who I liked in a BRMC club kinda way. I thought the rhythm section was tight, allowing the keytarist and guitarist to drive the vocal melodies. I bought the CD, so I'll decide then if I like them or not! However, they were smart enough to invite Saintface to open for them, so that's a point in their favour. However, the scary couple making out next to Irene was wayyyy too distracting. You had to see that one.  In the end, we had a good crew and the face guys are always nice. Peter and I have settled on his singing two songs for EXIT STRATEGIES, which he has yet to hear, but those songs are called CLEAN UP and EXIST. I know that these two tracks will be massive with him on vocals. Also, I breathe a sigh of relief that he is doing those two songs as we have always had these songs in mind for him. He was the last piece of the puzzle for this record and now its in!  The aggression are making their return to compact disc later this year with a rare remix making an appearance on an upcoming compilation in the US. It will be Needleye's awesome remix of MY WHITE NOVA and I'll send more details when it's all official, etc.  While Brandt is editing, I have started to slowly move the HF Live Machine forward a bit. There is no timetable to play, but there is an idea as to who should be in this band. Besides Me, Brandt, Robin and Ash, I'm happy to report that the last aggression keyboard player, The Kidd, now is the first Hypefactor keyboard player. Honestly, I think this is a more exciting gig for him than the aggression. It's more of a challenge. I'm told Robin is concerned juggling two bands is going to be tough when it comes to playing live. I disagree and plus, double bills could rock! Assfactor, anyone?   I'm back in the studio tonight for bass overdubs, then we're checking out some Death Cab on Thursday. It's a good life, kids.

      A friend of mine once said that beer is the force that gives us peeing. And on Saturday evening it gave the MOGpac the resplendent  urlLink Twilight Singers , cloaked in a thick fog of soul, whiskey and illicit cigarette smoke at Brooklyn's  urlLink Warsaw . For their second major American tour in six months, Greg Dulli's post-Afghan Whigs project put on a storming set reminiscent of the 2001 gig we caught at Bowery Ballroom in support of  Twilight As Played By...  This will sound blasphemous to some longstanding Dulli fans, but the gig almost made up for my having missed The Whigs' final national tour - in support of the stunning  1965  - as the group closed with two of my favorite numbers from that LP.  Mind you, the gig could have been a disaster of epic proportions. And as F, Irene, The Kidd, G and I sat at the Polish National Home's bar drinking  urlLink Zywiec , this possibility lingered in the backs of our minds. During the first leg of the band's  Blackberry Belle  tour last year, sets ran three hours or longer as Dulli, a glutton of epic proportions, drank himself into a stupor and told 20-minute stories to the audience while the band looped introductions to their songs ad nauseum. We learned about   urlLink Amber Headlights  , the near-complete Twilights album that was scrapped upon the death of Dulli's friend, director Ted Demme. And about Elliot Smith drinking at Dulli's Los Angeles bar, The Short Stop. And about Dulli screwing his college girlfriend to Marvin Gaye and Kate Bush. It was charming and funny for a few minutes, then wore thin rapidly. How thin? The Kidd - the most ardent of Dulli fans and the man responsible for introducing the MOGpac to The Whigs - walked out of the gig.  Luckily Saturday's gig was brisk and succinct, wrapped up in a timely two hours. "Uptown Again," "Up In It" and "Somethin' Hot" sounded boozy as ever, while the gentler tunes from the debut Twilights LP were infused with new rock and swagger. Dulli said little but teased the crowd a few times, making reference to the fans' distaste for his Storytellers routine on the previous tour (he pulled the same gimmick at almost every show in the fall, and was deservedly reviled by fans and critics alike.)   And it probably did not hurt that copious amounts of beer were consumed before and during the gig, punctuated by a round of Jaegermeister for all. F was in rare form, putting 'em back in a way I had not seen since we hit up KGB Bar with  urlLink Jamie Duffy . The next time you see him, ask him what he remembers about this evening.  In other Dulli news, The Twilights are releasing a full-length album of covers this summer, while the man is recording a separate LP with ex-Screaming Tree Mark Lanegan under the moniker of  urlLink The Gutter Twins . Dulli and Lanegan claim that group will tour, playing songs by all of their affiliated bands and covers with a revolving cast of musicians. I am hoping we will be seeing more of Greg in the coming year.

      After more months of drum sessions in Garden City than I care to remember, the Factor Corp. - sans Robin, who was deservedly cavorting with her boyfriend - met at Birdcage for a meeting/listening session covering the drum recordings and edits thus far. We had not been in a room together for some time, and it was good to see everyone and catch up on life.  Reaction was largely upbeat, especially to "Our Faith," "Exist" and "Leningrad." "Our Faith" has the most work complete thus far, as it was the first edit I tackled using Ableton's Live, a stellar program for time correction. At best, however, the process is tedious. I  could  complete a song per day... if I were putting in a 12-hour day of editing. But real life shit means that I'm getting through a song about every three to four days, thereby making most of April editing time. Ugh.  The one point of contention came up during "Theme From Propaganda," Ash's Russian club monster with live bass and guitars. Robin played a staggered drum pattern over the 4/4 programming that I love, even in its unedited form, but that Ash and F hate on the basis that it makes the song too busy. I am standing by my opinion of the drums... for now. But the song is Ash's baby, so once I finish my edits this week, I will hand over the drum parts to him and let him make the final call.  Yesterday the band also had the opportunity to meet Kathie, my long-time photographer friend who will be shooting the Factor photos for the CD art and Web site. Kathie sat in on about half of the session, listening to us bicker and lending me cigarettes. And she was quite charmed by F and Ash, who have rubbed off on me, apparrently. I am not certain what this means, and Kathie did not care to elaborate, but I will assume this is a good thing.  Random aside: About half of the new Skinny Puppy album is amazing. Absolutely fucking amazing. Industrial may not be dead after all, if only the kids will rally to support this.  The evening before I caught the hipster gig of the year, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and The Rapture in a double headlining stop at Roseland Ballroom. It was my first time seeing both bands, as I made the massive error of missing BRMC during their stops at Warsaw and Irving Plaza in 2003. The good: BRMC were stellar, and The Rapture sounded far more tuneful and coherent live than they do on their "breakthrough" LP,  Echoes , revered by every white twentysomething in Brooklyn with an afro. The bad: The audience, which was exactly what you would expect at this gig. The worse: The vibe of both bands' best performances was ruined by the crowd's indifferent, muted response to everything. Shouldn't blistering performances of "Stop" and "Love Burns" warrant a bit more enthusiasm? I would think so.  The unexpcted: The audience popped the hardest for "Olio," "I Need Your Love" and a few other Rapture tunes with only electronics and drum machines. Strange, given the hipster crowd's fondness for sloppy guitars. And the ridiculous: The Rapture's Gabe Andruzzi, whose onstage antics proved that, unlike Blue Oyster Cult, his band does  not  need more cowbell.  Speaking of up-and-coming bands playing obnoxiously large and overhyped shows, seeing BRMC and The Rapture reminded me of why I  didn't  bother to see the Yeah Yeah Yeahs at Hammerstein Ballroom earlier in the year. As much as I adore this band, I cannot imagine their energy translating well in any venue larger than Irving Plaza. And at the risk of sounding like the elitists who selfishly want success to elude small bands, the point of all this is lost on me when gigs become hipster clusterfucks. A friend of mine put it best the other evening: "Damn, we were lucky to see them when we did."

      First things first, thanks to the Quizmo website, I have created "Test Your MOGness" quiz for the members of the MOGpac. This quiz is designed mostly for the 8 or so people that would possibly get it, but dammit of those 8 people who have taken it thus far, there has been much amusement. It really takes the piss out of the whole crew. Further to the 24 Quiz discussed previously, Brandt took it and was Tony, and Ash took it and was Michelle, Tony's wife. If you know these people, this makes perfect sense. Then Dan Hamill took it and was Kim Bauer, Jack's daughter, which in this silly world of ours, makes even sense that G himself would be a hot chick...  Moving on...  Being as burnt out as I am from the recent LA adventure and then subsequent real life work related matters that have kept me from home this week, I was excited to have a good nights rest yesterday and then hit the studio for a solid (half day) or work. We began with the computer-based grunt work of adding the new parts Leo did in LA for OUR FAITH to the original song file. I loved the arrangement Leo and I conceived for the song, so it was my job to get that in shape. Arrangement is one of my strong points, so while this may be a boring job for some, this is my bread and butter. It didnt take too long, but I wanted to spend some time going through everything thats been recorded for the song to see what would stay and go. By doing this, I was able to create a cool blend of the original (recorded with Jamie Birthday Boy Duffy) and the new version (recorded with Leo). We got us a hot song here.  Next was more fun, as I finally got to get my musical hands on the latest track, DESCRIPTIVE, which I had yet to do anything but arrange. As I type, I'm waiting for B to send over the mp3 of it, but we created a new intro that has all the elements of the chorus, minus the guitars, but with the addition of some F-Bass.  Brandt wants this song to end as a fade, so we added this bass to the fading chorus at the end. Inspired, I began writing some lyrics down so I wouldn't forget while B added some synth and strings to the chorus. I'm really loving this song, and while I don't think it fits on the album (and was never intended to be), I am enormously proud of what my mates did here and I hope we can play this baby live.  Upon discussing where we are at with the albun, it's been decided to start vocals earlier than planned as the drum editing is going to slow for my tastes (however, this will bring us nothing short of perfection thanks to B). So I should be back there on Monday starting this.  It was too nice outside after a few crap days of weather, so B and I hit the record shop for our usual round of spending way too much. Got the new MOJO/NME special on The Smiths and seeing Oasis on the cover of the new Q made my day.  Later that night, Irene, G and I went to see SHREK 2. I am not a big fan of the first one, which I liked, but damn this second one is HILARIOUS, thanks in part to really funny voice work from Antonia Banderes and Rupert Everett. Really funny, go see it.  And now I must prepare for the long awaited Pizza-Off event in which Irene and my dad will battle to see who makes the better Pizza here at MOGworld. My dad, who doesnt cook is about to get his ass handed to him I think, as Irene makes a damn fine Pizza. The Winner in all this is ME, who gets to eat all of this!  F

      So while arranging the song B, Ash, Robin and Charles wrote, DESCRIPTIVE, we paused to eat some Great Wall and watch the Season Finale of 24, which was really good. Not great, but really good. Jack's breakdown at the end was a good way to end it. The War goes on and Jack Bauer will not tire! Anyhow, The show's not back on till January and I have a feeling it will be a very different show. Seasons 1 and 2 were classic and quite frankly, Season 3 had a lot to live up to and occasionally delivered. It's time to change up the formula. However, speaking of season finale's, SMALLVILLE was awesome and they re really shaking up that show in a good way. They got rid of a lot of characters supposedly and had a well crafted cliffhanger. Kudo's to that writing staff.  I took a quiz that was called "Which 24 Character are you most like" and this was the answer: "You are MOST like JACK BAUER. Your motives are pure, but your tactics are ruthless, fearless and uncompromising. You value loyalty, honour and tradition. You don't trust people easily, but when they do earn your trust, you are loyal to them, sometimes to a fault. You are quick-witted, resourceful and a bit of a badass. You love danger and taking risks, but will not hesitate to put yourself on the line for your beliefs and the people you care about."  I think i AM a bit of a badass, though I hope I don't have a heroin habit by next season.  As for the new song, it's damn good and the kids have left me a lot to work with. I don't know if they will love the arrangement, but you can't make everyone happy. I already have vocal melodies for it. It gets quite electronic in the middle, which I love. It will be great for the single.It needs some more meat on it, though I'm not sure what it needs yet or if even I'm the man to do it. Regardless, this track is certainly worthy of the HF catalogue. My compatriots are a mean force.  Meanwhile, Brandt gave me a new edit of CREATION PHASE where the intro was significantly chopped. The song has much more punch now, which really takes it over the top (a good thing). it makes sense. Also, he recorded some extra guitars for LENINGRAD, which were good but needed proper placement, so we spent sometime on that. Now that song's just about perfect.   Brandt will now be spending the next week plus editing drums. Closer and Closer. We need to be careful not to start overthinking shit.   While I am a newcomer to THE SOPRANO's, my love for Drea De Matteo is everlasting. Watching her get beat up and now supposedly killed on that show is too much for me. I have a feeling which she appears next season on the FRIENDS spin-off JOEY, I doubt we will see Matt LaBlanc smacking her around.  And finally the newest issue of the BATTLE ROYALE manga has arrived, so I'm off!  F

      As I got up to grab some iced tea from the fridge (now a staple at Birdcage to cut down on Wendy's bills), the searing pain in my arms reminded me of something I forgot to mention in my previous post: the MOGpac's first appearance at the Tournament Of Champions dodgeball league.  I will keep the history and details about this event to a minimum, as I hope Mattagement (an organizing principle of MOG Athletics) will go into specifics about that here. But a few key observations:   - The MOGpac should probably spend weekends brushing up on their skills, as the team went one for five, despite a good showing during our warmup session outside MLK Jr. High School.   - A defensive/catching game is probably the way to go because, with few exceptions, we throw like girls. Sorry ladies.   - The MVP award for the day belongs to Charles LaBarbara, who went one-on-one against a chick and brought the MOGpac its only victory of the championship. The ref would take umbrage at Charles' name being used in the same sentence as MVP, but he's not here right now, so fuck it.   - The only team the 'pac beat has a player who the crowd referred to alternately as Tolkien or a Hobbit. I am not sure what this says about us.   - The "Nastiest Smack" award goes to Robin Emmet, who took one for the team square in the chest when she was the only one left on the court. Not even FJ's frequent spatula attacks could have prepared the poor girl for that hit, which resonated throughout the gym. While we lost that match, the hecklers booed the opposing team for beating up on a lone girl. Do moral victories exist in dodgeball?   - The MOGpac received its most savage beating at the hands of a team named after a Spinal Tap album. We hath smelt the glove, and the stench was foul.   - If you are a team of irate alpha males, calling yourselves the "Richard Ryders" is an unfortunate decision.  The good news is that we met a couple of other dodgeballers who were competing for the second time at the tournament, and their team made it to the playoffs after a one-and-five showing the month beforehand. Indeed, miracles do happen. Now all we need are t-shirts.

      I admit I was supposed to write this post days ago, but I am back to editing drums for  Exit Strategies  and keeping everyone up to date went on the backburner for a few days. So please excuse my poor sense of timing.  But as FJ wrote yesterday, while he cavorted with industry types in Los Angeles on Wednesday, the Factor Corp. board met at Birdcage to hammer out the foundation of the band's first new song in seven months. The recording was planned at my encouragement, and I admit it is nonsensical to dive into a new recording while we are waist-deep in edits and overdubs for the full-length. That being said, the fans will be treated to a new hypefactor release this year before the album - I'll leave it up to FJ to fill in the details when he sees fit - and we wanted to include something exclusive. This track will most likely be it.  The directive for the song, per FJ, was to compose something emphasizing electronics rather than guitars. Guitars drive the melodies and rhythms of  Exit Strategies , with few exceptions, and we both thought it would be clever to do something radically different here. A number of structural ideas and potential "blueprints" for the tune were bandied about via IM before F left for Los Angeles, and the general consensus was to fashion a pop song whose melody and atmosphere are driven by rhythm loops and synth melodies. I refined some structural ideas further while listening to some NewOrder b-sides from their  Get Ready  era, both of which were synth-based tracks recorded during that band's otherwise rockist period.  And as always happens with this band, plans and ideas rarely materialize as intended, and for the better. The core of Robin, Ash and I were joined by Ass Cobra bassist Charles LaBarbara the evening of the session, much to Robin's surprise and delight (as she and Chaz get along swimmingly). Ash and I cued up some loops we had prepared in Ableton Live, while Charles played bass and Robin played synth drums on her Roland electronic kit... a first for us. As Charles' funky bass part came together, however, both Ash and Robin drifted toward guitars, and they recorded some dark, chordy progressions of which I am quite fond. Ironically, no electronics (aside from the basic loops and Robin's drums) were tracked that evening. Not what I had intended by a long stretch, but the result felt right.  I took that direction one step further the next day while jamming along to Robin's drums and Charles' precise, machine-like bass line, which will probably form the verse/chorus structure for the tune. Their playing had such unexpected drive to it that I tracked some acoustics and a brisk, zingy electric riff in a few hours of inspiration. I also pulled in a lot of new loops from a prep session I had done earlier in the week, many of which may stay pending FJ's arrangement overhaul. As I wrote to F today, the song is only 10 to 15 percent of the way there, so it could be a reggae song by the time we are wrap it up next month. But the song in its current form has far more verve than I anticipated, and I am thrilled with the direction it has taken thus far.  A substantial part of the song's feeling derives from Charles' bass part, which I think is one of the best things this group has committed to tape in some time. There are countless studio moments - Ash's guitar riff in the bridge of "Exist," FJ's bass in "Clean Up," Robin's drumming on "Solar" - where I thank my lucky stars I play in this band, and Charles' performance on Wednesday was of that quality. I, for one, hope (and think) this will not be his only appearance on a hypefactor recording.  The last time I posted I promised to say something about ex-industrialist Chris Connelly's new record,  Night Of Your Life , which came out last week. FJ and I had the luxury of digesting a pre-release copy of this album for a matter of months, and after listening to the finished product I still believe Connelly has not recorded anything this brilliant since  Blonde Exodus , if not  Shipwreck . This feat is all the more impressive considering that those records were recorded with full bands, while producer/longtime collaborator Chris Bruce and a keyboardist are Connelly's only accompaniment on  Night Of Your Life . Bruce, a wildly talented multi-instrumentalist and member of Seal's backing band, deserves a huge amount of credit for providing the lushness this batch of tunes required. Given hipsters' penchant for singer-songwriter types these days, I will never understand why "Stella Stand Up And Take Your Man" is not a massive hit. Other than a certain record label's penchant for blowing goats. Oh, and the cover art, all of which was shot in Scotland, is sublime and worth the price of admission alone.  Edits and overdubs continue this week, and if all goes well vocals start on one or two songs next week. Stay tuned.

      Just back from the Harry Potter premiere here in NYC. Good movie, solid direction and an extremely hilarious cameo by ex Stone Rose Ian Brown (a pal of the director's, hence the cameo). Of course in all of Radio City Music Hall only two people went mad for Ian Brown: myself and Dan Hamill (though you should have seen Mr. G pop for Emma Watson when they came out to introduce the movie, not that I blame him). As for the movie, it lacks one thing, which is a major bad guy. Let's just say Kenneth Branagh got more screentime in the last movie than Oldman does in this. Special thanks to Mattagement for hooking Irene, G and myself with tix. The post show dinner at the original hardcore Benihana was most enjoyable and as always, the company (G, Matt and Jax) is always first rate.  Stepping back to my industrial roots, I've heard the new WATTS album for the first time today. It's always fun to hear something new from Raymond, and this is no exception. With WATTS, Raymond tries some new things, going into more electronic territory while also stripping down his usually thick sound. It was a smart decision not to call this a PIG album, because with the way its produced and performed, its not. When it does sound like Pig, its more of a reference than anything. I know some of you die-hards are pissed, but quite honestly, he's smart not to fuck with the PIG brand name. I know that sounds kinda corporate, but when he goes back to doing something as PIG, no one can fuck with him when he wanted to try something different here. Having spent years tracking down almost everything the man has ever recorded, I'm a sucker for most things Watts, so I might be a bit biased.  I am told in their first outing, MOG Athletics won ONE game and lost FIVE in dodgeball. I would like to congratulate these beatiful losers on a job well done!!  F

      This might be my first blog from the air. I am 3/4 of the way back to NYC from an extended stay on the West Coast. While here in the air, I want to wish Team Mogpac well on their first dodgeball game, currently being played somewhere in the big apple. I hope Matt Gentile will report the results here on the blog and I look forward to participating in the next round of what we call MOG Athletics. Considering it was Irene’s idea, I should participate.  A lot happened on my LA journey and it’s hard to remember it all because I’m so tired, but I’ll try to give you the update, as I did actually work on things to benefit the world of MOG. I won’t get too deep into my adventures at E3 as it was a massive headache and basically a huge arcade on steroids. I did enjoy seeing some of the new games and in particular, the new tech. I think we’re all going to be playing the Playstation Portable in the next few years. It was also fun to see my man Evan walk the floor of this convention like a massive rockstar (He’s an important game reviewer in the real world). The convention is huge, it’s loud. Note to self: next time bring aspirin.  Quick story: on my way to the convention, LA’s finest pulled me over for jumping into the HOV lane (like an idiot I pulled right in front of a fucking cop). However, upon seeing my Ipod in the front seat, the two policemen, who shall remain nameless, and I got into a conversation about their desire to play their Ipod in their police car. When they learned I was going to E3, I not only avoided a ticket, I also got a police escort for my trouble. Only in LA kids.  Anyhow, at a party held in honour of my lawyer/agent/advisor, Leo V23 and I huddled into a corner to discuss our musical work for the upcoming week in LA while also trying to avoid (unsuccessfully) as many entertainment industry types as possible. With our game plan set, Leo and I spent a few nights in the wee hours working on the new HF song OUR FAITH. We had been looking for Leo to come through with his unique style of atmospheric guitar playing and singing and boy did my second favourite Argentinean come through. We took what was a wall of guitars and britrock and turned into a sexy explosion of the subtly and noise. Tons of loops were removed and by doing so, the melodies really came through while also making Robin’s drums really stand out. Leo laid down some beautiful guitars and even better vocals, in Spanish no less. I used my skills in an arranging capacity and we have a brand new and interesting song that is a million times better than what I walked in there with.  Leo is used to being a solo performer, but I was really impressed with how collaborative he was. Working with him was no different than working with my best collaborators: Brandt, Ash and Robin. He would listen carefully to my ideas and even if he thought some of them wouldn’t work, he would try them, which sometimes led to him being surprised, me being surprised and most importantly, really allowing us to push the material forward. After working with “producers” and “musicians” whose egos and need to be in charge overwhelms everyone else in the room to the point where they won’t let anyone push the music forward because of their own insecurities, Leo was a joy to work with and has a place in the Factor Corporation any day.   On the topic of Leo, in between all of this I managed to catch the debut gig of his newest project AM Pacific, which continues the musical style he began several years with his previous project Sutra. This was at a private party filled mostly with hipster douches out in Los Feliz, the Williamsburg of Los Angeles (Fuck you, Fury). Leo had a very simple set up of himself on guitars and vocals, one girl on lead vocals, and another girl on vocals and trumpet (who was amazing). Beats and loops were run through a PA via Leo’s Ipod. They came on late and the people were annoying, but damn was this short set worth it. The AM trio was excellent and really delivered a beautiful set and the best cover of Chris Issak’s WICKED GAME you will ever hear.  Meanwhile I worked on artwork for a potential HF single, while my 3 cohorts teamed up with Ass Cobra’s amazing bassist Charles to work on a potential B-side, which they have titled DESCRIPTIVE. An mp3 was sent my way of the material written for this song and boy am I excited. I had a few requests of what I would like to hear in a B-side and the Factor Corp really stepped up to the plate. I’m already writing vocal melodies. I hope Brandt will go into detail about the making of this song somewhere here.  Luckily Brandt took the space to review Morrissey’s new one and I’m happy to say I’m loving the album. Another amazing return to form by a legend of days past. We need Moz and he has not let us down. Duran was the comeback of 03, and Moz is truly the comeback of 04. Thank God.  My celebrity sightings included former Melrose Place douche Patrick Muldoon, the Legendary Mickey Rourke, Apollo Creed himself Carl Weathers, current Playboy cover star Charisma Carpenter (who I was tempted to ask why she refused to show her nether regions in said photo spread, thus making the spread quite Maxim instead of Playboy), and the man Dan Hamill and I call Mr. 100 Million Dollars: Oliver Martinez, who might be the one human being Brandt hates the most on this planet besides Benicio Del Toro (who is on the airplane movie screen right now in 21 Grams). Oliver was sans Kylie, but was wearing these horrible glasses that reminded me of Dan Hamill Circa 1993. Not good. Special thanks to my friends at Ca’Brea for sitting my lawyer/agent/advisor and myself at a better table that the movie stars.  Also, the highlight of my trip was spent with the younger crowd, including the new Fury baby, in from San Fran (it was fun seeing Bradley J. Fox and my sister Dee Dee looking into their future of parenthood while playing with the Fury child). And of course, as much time as possible was spent my 5 year old nephew, who becoming more of a clone of my girlfriend every day, just as my small cousin has become a Star Wars loving Benihana eating clone of me.  Oh I saw TROY and the best part was seeing the trailer for CONSTANTINE.  New York approaches. More, much more, soon!  F

      With FJ loitering outside all-male theaters on Santa Monica boulevard and sharing iPod tips with law enforcement, news on the home front is my responsibility for another week.  The past few days were rife with gigs, record purchases and hypefactor work, thankfully, so there is a lot to keep you occupied until FJ writes about the "gig" he saw Saturday night.  First stop of the week was on Thursday at the dreaded Piano's (where personality goes to die) to see The Dansettes. Joe Babic, the perenially youthful bassist in Saintface, has dated a charming lady named Jamie for as long as anybody in the MOGpac has been going to see his band.  Unlike the worst rock 'n' roll girlfriends - a lecherous lot who date talent because they lack it themselves - Jamie is a musical firebrand in her own right, and The Dansettes are her band. A 1960s-styled girl group, no less, with Jamie and two others on vocals and a quartet of male instrumentalists. While The Dansettes are a nostalgia act in the sense that they are not doing anything to modernize the soul genre, they stay true to the tenets of the best groups from that era and have more talent and style than any other contemporary outfit claiming to be "soul." The set mixed obscure Northern Soul covers and originals, and it was obvious the band knows its roots because they nailed the best elements of the former in their own material. It is tragic that The Dansettes have yet to commit anything to tape, as Jamie truly has an excellent tropue on her hands.  Revelation of the evening:  Jamie can belt out those soul numbers with as much vigor and flair as her 1960s predecessors. Who knew the spirit of Dobie Gray was alive and thriving in the body of a 5-foot, 3-inch Polish girl? Utterly remarkable.  My original plans to see Saintface at Lit on Friday night were scuttled when, at the last minute, FJ discovered via Irene that Colder had their debut New York gig booked for the same evening at Rothko on the Lower East Side. Colder is the alias of Marc Tan, a French video artist who wrote and recorded some tunes to accompany his visual work. "Again," the album borne of those recordings, ended up being more interesting than anything Tan committed to DVD, and he was promptly signed to Output Recordings (the über-hip home of The Rapture, etc.) Reviews pegged the record as a more electronic Joy Division or Revenge, naturally piquing interest among some MOGpac members. And for the most part, the record lives up to the hype, as its absence of memorable hooks is more than compensated for with Tan's spacious programmed atmospheres.  When FJ or I carp about electronic artists' live shows, we almost always note the reliance on computers or pre-programmed material (Squarepusher, you asshole: take note). In Colder's case, however, the exact opposite was the case. Tan brought a three-piece accompaniment (guitar-bass-drums) for the tour, and his group proceeded to wreck the album's subtle delivery. It was not until the middle of the hour-long set that the group struck a rerasonable balance between the live rock and the programming, and even then with mixed success. I will rarely argue that something is too live, but the criticism holds true for Colder. Even Ash, an ardent fan of  Again  on the first listen, was underwhelmed. And our talkative guests did not help matters.  That being said, Colder drew a heck of a crowd for a show with no promotion. Every crisply-dressed indie snob in the city packed into this tiny club, making for a crowded, overheated and unpleasant wait... save for the DJ playing Die Warzau's "Land Of The Free."  I made the trek to Rebel Rebel on Saturday for no particular reason, only to discover that Dave had limited edition versions of Morrissey's  You Are The Quarry  in stock. In short, this is the best set of tunes old Moz has assembled since the early 1990s. There is nothing earth-shattering here, aside from the liberal use of programming and synthesizers, but the melodies are strong and as arresting as anything in the man's solo repertoire. I  will  argue that a stellar lyricist like Morrissey should align himself with more innovative songwriters and arrangers, as stated in the New York Times' review of  Quarry . Nevertheless, Boz Boorer and Alain Whyte are competent players who deliver some fine work on this album. Kudos.  PJ Harvey's new single  The Letter , on the other hand, was a letdown. Harvey chose to produce her new record herself, and limited her instrumental support to longtime collaborator Rob Ellis. While the song is pure Harvey, the production leaves a lot to be desired when held up against  Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea . A shame, really, though I will reserve final judgement for the album.  Album to be discussed later that you must pick up now:  Chris Connelly's  Night Of Your Life , out now on Underground, Inc.  Tonight:  Guitar work on "Leningrad" to test my theory that the song is far from complete. Stay tuned...

      From today's NME comes this years most awesome event:   NOEL GALLAGHER and IAN BROWN have collaborated on a track for the former STONE ROSES vocalist's new album. According to The Sun newspaper, the pair met by chance at the Electric Cinema in London’sNotting Hill. "We got talking about music and agreed we should do something," explained Brown . He added: "Noel sent me some music he’d done and I recorded a vocal. The result is brilliant, I’m really excited. I hope it will be a single." The news comes after denials from the Oasis camp that Liam was to form a supergroup with ex-Roses guitarist John Squire. As previously reported onNME.COM, the band claim the story was "dreamed up" by editorial staff atThe Sun. Oasis are currently working in the studio on the follow-up to ’Heathen Chemistry’, which is due for release later this year. Brown’s new album is expected in August or September.

      Though this blog is usually reserved for the musical portion of my life, I must report today that I am a victim of false reporting on the internet. It was reported on "respected" internet movie sites this morning that I have become an Executive Producer on the forthcoming BATMAN film. While I would love nothing more in life than to produce a Batman film (and believe me this new one is going to be the bomb), I can truthfully tell you that I AM NOT an Executive Producer. I just happen to work for two of them in my "other" life. I wanted you all to read this first as the E-mails are already coming in.   NO I AM NOT. OK? I would love to know who does this shit.  I have asked the websites to remove the false article simply because A. It's bullshit and B. Could get me in trouble. THANKS, Jett.  F

      Upon finishing the post below, something was nagging at me. Like I had forgotten something. And then it hit me.  Besides this week being the 10th anniversary of the first time Mark Mothasemi and I took to the stage with the teenage versions of Ash and Tom, a year ago this past weekend, the aggression played what will be most likely be their last ever show. From what I recall, it was a good gig, though honestly, we were always good (though we got REALLY good once Robin came in). We played here in the City and the other band no showed, so we were able to do our extended set without having to cut anything. it was sparsely attended, especially in comparison to our previous NYC shows, but it was hastily put together and we had just come back from Russia when the opportunity to play arose. While we had several gigs over the past 10 years that were supposed to be our last, the one time I didn't think was the last one, was in fact, THE LAST GIG EVER (TM). I've not seen a video of this gig because, according to Matt Gentile, the tape is "fucked up". I nag him occasionally about this, but there's a romanticism to never seeing it  I always felt like the aggression should have gone out like the end of Michael Mann's HEAT, in an overblown blaze of glory. That gig has been played over and over in my head millions of times. From what I would wear to what I would play, the gig was preconceived for the past few years. I don't think I was alone in that as I recall Ash having a set list for such a gig (as well as several drafted letters of resignation).  I was about to share with you my thoughts on what that gig should be. I've decided against it as I think what you are speculating might be better than what I had planned.   I thought I would be more emotional about it, but I guess I got over it more quickly than I anticipated. This could be because I remain in such close,  daily, contact with the people who did matter and worked hard to make the aggression something special. Another reason, and I can see this with time having passed, I was fucking miserable in the band thanks to the lack of focus and maturity within it. But if I am anything, I am loyal and I was the general who took the ship down to a noble death.  Let's be frank, we only sold a few thousand records, we were never even a blip on a radar. However, for ten years it was the world I and a few others lived in and while I can never forgive the few who tried to fuck with it,  I love that the music and the experiences will be something no one can ever take away or tarnish. I wanted to save the industrial scene when bands i adored like Chemlab and Skinny Puppy went away. With all of these old schoolers coming back and putting out records, I can rest easier knowing we kept our elders seats warm in their absence.   From the pits of the Underworld to the former Soviet Union, the casualty rate was shockingly low and most of the friendships remain intact. Plus, some records came out that I love to pieces. They proudly hang on my well as reminders of the wonderful life I have led for 10 years.  And don't think I don't seen the irony in the fact that the one of last songs the aggression ever played was in fact, Hypefactor's SWEETEST SOUL.  HAH.  F

      Been running around like mad man as I get ready for another LA trip, so bear with me if I seem, if I can coin my dentists description of my agent/manager/lawyer: Scattered.  We did the customary Mothers Day celebrating yesterday, honouring the woman who dares take the responsibility of claiming to have given birth to me. She's a nice lady, I like her, though she needs to stop working so much (which is something she would say about me). Anyhow, this brought us to Long Island (hopefully for one of the last times in my life before the nice people who raised me finally move into the City at last). Completely by coincidence, Irene and I had tickets to see her absoulte favourite band, CAVE IN, on Long Island as well. Farmingdale, no less. Notice the first part of that town's name is farm. I must admit to having a strong appreciation for Cave in, but I am less appreciative of these far out parts of Long Island. Well, it was another flashback to pre-drivers license days, as Irene and I were driven by my aunt and uncle (also nice people, who have seen many aggression shows in their lives, poor things) to the venue, which was on the "main street" of town. Talk about Suburbia. We couldn't wait to get the hell out of this town! Who in their right mind lives out here!  Anyhow, the gig was good. The young guys in this band are shockingly gifted musicians. They write complex, catchy songs and this was the first time I was able to check them out in a small venue. They are loud and talented as hell. I love their album ANTENNA, which strays from their previous hardcore sound, so when they dip back into the catalog, I am not as excited, but because they play so well, it's enjoyable nonetheless. Their new material steps back a little bit to the harder side of things, but with a 70's rock bent. Could be good. Stay tuned. Great band!  Irene being up at 5:30am for work this morning really kicked me in the ass and it sent me straight down to the studio in the morning for what will be my last round in the studio for the next few weeks. I spent the whole day there, and we got some work done. It may not feel like much, but what we did was very important for the record. We offficially wrapped up guitar tracking today as Brandt laid down his acoustics for THE MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE. Again, I played the role of engineer and it's something I need to do more of instead of letting everyone go and just do their things. Hypefactor was orginally intended for me to improve on my bass playing and singing and I think I have met those goals. Now, I need to focus on producing, though I'd like to apply that to another project, i.e. Chemlab, and then bring what I learn into the HF experience. Anyhow, something to think about. I also took the opportunity to have B tutor me in how to use the program LIVE, which he and Ash often use to edit loops and such. I need some practive on this fucker!  We also wrapped up a remix that has been sitting around. A while back, Brandt had started some remixes of two songs from THE DISTRACTED LOVER. They were good drafts, but I felt they needed some more work. We just never got around to it. Last night at Cave In, they were selling a limited edition live CD that they pressed on their own and this inspired me to want to do something for HF; possibly a giveaway using those remixes. In my mind right now, and it's being planned that way, it will be THE SWEETEST SOUL EP, and we will give it out over the website. I spent part of the morning re-listening to the remixes and I heard changes that could be made on the remix of THIEVES very quickly. Needless to say, we worked fast and have a nice completed remix. I have to really sit with the other remix as it needs a ton of work on my return.   In my fan boy moment of the day, I ordered the new solo album from Sakurai Atsushi of Buck Tick. My old friend Wayne Hussey of the Mission, who did a wonderful remix for us years ago, wrote a song on the album as do Bryan Haloblack and Mr. Watts himself. These are more than enough reasons to buy this disc. Hope it rocks.  My posting will be less frequent over the next few weeks thanks to my heading to the left coast, so hopefully my comrades will fill the void a bit. Behave.  F

      An extremely productive time was had at the Birdcage today as we came closer to wrapping up all the guitar overdubs. In fact, we might be done entirely if Brandt kept working after I left (though I doubt it). Regardless, the light at the end of the tunnel is growing brighter as we progress in large measures towards the mixing stage.  Like last week, I again stepped into the engineer's chair as Brandt not only re-recorded several guitar parts, but committed some new ideas to disk. I won't bore you with the details as it was a tedious but necessary task, but he started off doing some wonderful work in the rapidy evolving CREATION PHASE. The parts he wrote for this song are not simple, but the ease in which he lays them down would make you think otherwise. His attention to detail may be as tight as as Dan Hamill's anus, but it's worth it. Anyway, I think now we can finally put that tune to rest.  Next came the guitar lead for 1956. When the song was originally started in the aggression, Tom had done a riff which I thought was a good starting point for something that could work in the chorus. It was the usual Tom throwaway riff that he probably wasnt even paying attention to when he wrote it, and probably couldn't remember even playing. Anyhow, I remembered it and wrote my vocal melody to it. Realizing his riff wouldnt work as written, I took the extremely rare opportunity to pick up the guitar and re-write and perform the part myself. I'm happy to say my favourite two words: FULL SUCCESS apply here. I am under the impression that this is the only time I have picked up a guitar for this album, and this was the first guitar lick I have written since the verse leads for THE MOTIVE way back when. This worked out well and inspired Brandt to pick up his guitar to layer something over it. In a matter of minutes, the song went to a new level. Stay tuned!  Afterwards, we attempted to re-record Brandt's intro guitars to SOLAR, but I wasn't happy with the guitar tones he was working with. After some time, and much to my delight, Brandt decided to stick with his original recording from the demo and would fix the timing of it in Live to make it dead on perfect. I'm very much sold on that sound so Brandt, if you're reading this, don't change your freakin' mind. KEEP THAT PART...  Sometime during this, we had a special guest visit us in the form of Matt Gentile. As some of you may or may not know, Matt laboured many years as the aggression's manager and my original bass tech. I refer to him often as Mattagement. Thanks to him we've seen places and things on this planet the average rock band will never see or even dream of in their lifetime. He's the guy you call and say "I wanna play some shows in Russia" and days later,  you're headlining major cities in foreign countries. Along with Dan Hamill, he is the co-conspirator of our MOG trips abroad and has never failed in his duties to us as a mattager or as a friend. I never question a thing when Matt is leading the charge and this had led the some of the greatest adventures of my life.  Anyway, he had some time to kill before seeing Morrissey's last night at the Apollo, so he came to listen to the new songs for the first time. It was good to have a fresh perspective on the material from someone who knows that the hell they are talking about. Because the aggression has gone the way of Suffolk County, Matt and I have existed soley on a friendship level this past year. However, I was excited to see him slip back into his professional mode and start discussing things like what the single should be, what song we should open gigs with and how we should have an EPK on the new CD. All great ideas.   I guess I should ask the handsome bastard to manage the Hype. Someone remind me, thanks. ;-)  I'm off to LA this week, so time is short and we're stealing as many moments as possible to make sure Brandt has everything he needs to work with in my absence. We're in good shape. The idea now is to be ready to mix the whole thing in JULY. I make note of this now to see when we actually DO start mixing someday.  In the meantime, say hi to your MOMS.

      Jesus, where do I begin? Last night, and at long last, Irene and I made the trek to Harlem to the legendary Apollo Theatre to see Morrissey take to the stage for the first time here in many years. We’re both sick with colds and the weather was crap, but we were psyched.  There was a large line to get into the venue and who of course was at the near front of this line? None other than Peter, Joe and Michael, three-fifths of my favourite band Saintface. Decked out in identical denim, the lads were, to say the least, excited. It was an NME moment. To say Saintface loves and has been influenced by Morrissey/The Smiths would be an understatement compared to one describing me as a “casual” Star Wars fan. These guys were ready to rumble. Little did I know what was to come…  This was my first visit to the Apollo and I was shocked at how small this venue was. However, my shock turned to pure joy when I discovered that our 4th row Orchestra Left tickets gave us an extremely close, unobstructed view of the stage (this moment was observed by Joe Saintface from the last row of Orchestra Left). I’ve had some choice seats before (i.e. the legendary Depeche Mode Jones Beach show a few years ago, thank you Matt Gentile), but these were CLOSE. Needless to say, Irene and I were buzzing when we arrived at our seats while former NY Doll David Johansen was playing.   In between sets, a disgruntled Peter Saintface came by (did I mention, all the way from the last row of Orchestra left) to tell us how inherently wrong it was that we had better seats than the Saintface crew. Without saying so, my dear friend was saying “motherfucker, you don’t DESERVE those seats” (and quite frankly, I concede that those lads are more hardcore than I could ever be and deserving of the best seats). In another NME moment, I told him which band he should stick with if he wants to see some rock n roll up close. All light-hearted though, I’m just busting balls, because quite honestly, I know we were all happy to be there.  Finally, the lights went down and the intro music began. The die-hards ran to the front as did part of our row, giving Irene and I a lot of room to watch the show. Suddenly, Michael Saintface appeared next to me. His genuine excitement for the imminent arrival of Morrissey reminded me of when my mom took me out of school to see the first showing of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK in 1980. He’s already an intense dude, but this was pure love (though slightly scary), and I must admit, it was infectious. Before I could even respond, Michael had run to the dead center of the security barrier to join his two bandmates as they welcomed their idol to the stage with hundreds of other screaming fans. We were close, but Saintface was now closer.  And there he was, Moz himself, looking lean, handsome and stylish. And honestly, with this crowd, the man could do no wrong. Granted, he’s not the wildman of the olden days, but he commands the stage in a unique and special way. His band, led by the ever-talented Boz Boorer, was tight and kept the pace up. The addition of a keyboardist (who also played horns and bongos) was welcome. And the fans, including the three members of Saintface dead center, went ballistic. Morrissey delivered a great performance. His show was centered around his forthcoming album and I’m happy to say the songs don’t suck. He chose his set list carefully, a Smiths song (THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT) here, a solo classic (EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY) there. It was enough to keep us engaged and entertained while serving as a reminder as to why this man deserves his status as “legend”. We sang along, we laughed, and we had fun.   But the fun came not only from the gig, but from the audience…A guy seated in the row ahead of us decked out in a painted denim jacket that said MORRISSEY IS GOD, had run to the front to deliver Moz daffodils (someone had to). While his friends stayed in their seats and kept bringing him drinks, he patiently waited for Moz to come near him. This dude’s hard work paid off as his love of Morrissey was consummated not only when Moz graciously accepted the flowers, but then later allowed this man to kiss his hand. The look on this guys face when he turned back to his friends was priceless. His patient friends were very excited for him and I have to admit, Irene and I were quite happy for him. It’s rare when you can feel that kind of pure joy for someone at a gig.  After years of being pissed off by his 45-minute sets of the past, Moz played a very full and hearty set. He returned to the stage to do the Smiths’ classic HAND IN GLOVE, which for old fan like me, was a welcome surprise.  Even better was when Moz ripped off his shirt and threw it into the front row and left for good while several fans, like SHARKS, jumped for the shirt. Now normally I wouldn’t even mention such a thing if it hadn’t been for the fact that of the half dozen or so fans fighting for a piece of this shirt, the scariest, most intense fan vying for a piece was none other than Michael Saintface. Now, at this point the houselights are up and this shirt is STILL being violently fought over. These fans are not letting go! Security can’t even break this one up. They’re rolling over the seats! Upon realizing Michael was in the thick of it, Irene and I rushed over to cheer him on. “C’MON MIKE! DO IT FOR SAINTFACE!”, we yelled. Pieces are broken off, and some fans are leaving, but Michael, reaching levels of TAXI DRIVER era Deniro ferociousness, is still struggling to get him some Moz. Suddenly, the joke wasn’t funny anymore.   Peter jumped in on this chaos when, after 10 minutes of struggle, it came down to Michael vs. one very aggressive woman. Little did Michael know that this woman is Saintface’s ASCAP rep who handles their publishing!!! Realizing this, Peter started asking Michael not to KILL this woman, thinking of course they will never see any publishing money. Eventually, thanks to Peter, they were able to each get a small piece of the shirt. I don’t think Michael spoke after this, but as I said to him on the way out, “Man, I’m glad your own our side!”. Joe Saintface, non-plussed by any of chaos, quietly convinced a roadie give him a set-list, so he was quite happy.  Later, as Peter was walking out with an oversized mounted poster of Moz on the cover of Spin (given to him by the same ASCAP rep!), he informed us that this fight for the shirt is a regular tradition amongst them. Go figure. Also, and I’m warning those of you who are going to see Moz this week, Michael Saintface is going to be BACK for another show (not sure which). When the shirt flies, RUN. Let the man have it, for God’s sake! He’s a good guy, but he’s got a bad case of Moz-it is! (I hope he takes this all in good fun!)  To say Irene and I were entertained by both the show and the events afterwards would again be another understatement. To the guy with the daffodils, I applaud you. To Saintface, It was an honour to see you leather clad warriors lose your cool and be true fans of music for one night.  And to Morrissey, all is forgiven.  F

      It's a lazy day in MOGworld as Irene has been downed by a mediocre 2am cheeseburger that didn't agree with her (damn you Gramercy!) and I'm just flat out beat. We enjoyed seeing the entire MOG collective last night for the KIDD's birthday; however I am sad I missed Dan Hamill lapdance both men AND women. I'm sure all I have to do is ask...  With Irene asleep, I've just finished watching Serpico, completing my inadvertant study of old school Al Pacino movies. GodDAMN, he was so good when he was young! I also used this weekend to catch up on recent Korean cinema. I watched first watched NATURAL CITY, which was described to me as the Korean BLADE RUNNER. Sure enough, it's almost the same plot, just with a few different twists, and not neary as good a film as Ridley's masterpiece. However, it looked fantastic, it was bloody and violent and I had fun watching, but it lacked substance. Next up was the highly recommended 2009 LOST MEMORIES which was pretty good, but not the classic I was told it was going to be. It had an interesting plot, but it meandered on. Plus it was shot on video, which was a big problem for me. However, I think Korea is the next big center of action movies, they just need to focus more on the stories and characters cause the directors are quite good and the ideas are very original (except when they're ripping off BLADE RUNNER).  Anyway, I made two pit stops into the studio this weekend and here's what went down:  LENINGRAD, originally known as TWO BASS, has finally been edited down to an acceptable length. It's original running time was over 7 minutes and after some rough vocals and some notes from Ash, I realized that this song would work better as an instrumental at a shorter length. Brandt and I had gone over the changes a few weeks ago with Ash and I pointed out what I planned to do, but I made sure to give myself some time to go over the track to make sure those changes are right. I got in front of the computer and it got it down very quickly to about 4 minutes plus change. It's tight now and I think it's going to work out great when we have the final drums in there.  Yesterday marked, in my mind, a pretty historic moment as for the first time Brandt asked me to record HIM playing guitars. Usually he just goes and does his own thing, unless we're jamming or writing, but he's never asked me to play producer for his guitar playing till now. Due to a computer crash some months ago, some of the parts to THE MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE has to be re-recorded, and then several other parts had to be re-recorded to fit Ash's new basslines. I recorded a LOT of Brandt and all of it was quite awesome. The song rocks, and like every other song, it's going to blow up when we have the final drums in there.  I don't think Brandt has much left to do other than re-track a few things here and there, but then its on to the final drum editing. Once he's done with that, I'll start on the final vocals. We've started to talk about HOW to release this album, and right now we're leaning towards putting it out ourselves just to avoid the problems I've had over the years with labels. I'm at that age where the record deal means less and putting out a finished album that I'm 150% happy with means more.  Now I must make soup!  F

      I'm still digging the Ryan Adams album immensely to the point where it's taking me time to get focused on the new Cure album. Upon the first few listens, I'm really liking the songs and the band sounds really inspired and motivated. In particular, Mr. Smith is pissed as hell on this record. I like that. However, I think the production blows, the mixing is flat and the severe raping of the defining Simon Gallup bass tone severly damages this album for me. I have a feeling that after seeing them perform these songs live at the end of next month I will appreciate them more. While I love the influence the producer has had on the band in terms of writing and performance, I think he should have stayed far away from the mixing.  Since you last read me, I have been spending signficant time between both of my bands. For the aggression, I solidified the tracklisting for the album and it will truly complete that era of music. I then proceeded to go hogwild (heheh) and do 95% of the artwork for it. The front cover is something I have been dying to commit to CD for some time, It's a photo of Iceland at night (taken by Brandt), but I'm just waiting on a few fonts to get it totally into shape. Thanks to Leo, I have all the fonts from FLOOD, so there will be continuity from the previous full length (Similar to the first two aggression CD's). I'll post the cover when it's done.  Meanwhile, check out www.theaggression.com for details on the new album as well an update on what the various members who DON'T post on this Blog are up to.  As for Hypefactor, Brandt and I took another stab at 1956 on Monday. We cracked it even further. Usually I would think at this point we are overthinking the song, but in reality the song needs this work and it's becoming more organic as we progress. This time, Brandt finally had the live drums ready to play with the song and Robin is so fierce on it that we dropped another load of loops out of the song. Like I said, organic. Thanks to those new guitar parts from Leo, the vocal melodies need to totally change. Thats my next assignment. B did a really cool rough mix for me to take along so I'm at work as we speak!  I've started to give friends and family a sneak peak at the material and the response has been very strong, I'm happy to say.  I gave Almost Bar Fighter Dan Hamill a sneak preview and he was impressed and very complimentary. He's probably my biggest litmus test of music outside the musical core. Because he is not a musican (he is a stage actor), he represents "the people"...I think.  In the meantime, the THIRD band I have had the pleasure of being associated with has a nice review in Outburn this month and a good interview with Mr. Louche himself. Read it HERE: http://trixvintage.com/outburnchemlab.jpg (Thanks to whoever posted it on the Cracknation site).  On deck this week is seeing SPIDERMAN 2 tomorrow night. Then, we have a gathering of the Factor Corp. principles (Brandt, Ash, Robin, myself and now Charles) scheduled for Thursday night to review everything. Hopfully no one will flake because I really want all of these people in a room asap. All that's left is the vocals for 1956 and Peterface. The light at the end of the tunnel grows brighter.

      I'd like to take a quick moment to announce the arrival of the newest little member of the MOGpac...Lucia Mary Magdalene Link, born June 24, 2004 12:36 a.m.  7 pounds, 8 ounces and 52 centimeters. First child of longtime founding member of MOGworld Chris Link and his wife Nina. Said child is already being spoiled by me and my significant other!  In other news, NAPOLEON DYNAMITE made me pee myself silly. Not a great movie by any means, but entertaining as hell. SWEET!  F

      A whirlwind of a day ended at 3am last night and after a long day of the au bon pain, studio, chinese food, fixing my fonts, more studio, Pluck U, Saintface, many drinks, soical time with the ladies of Internationalpoontang.com, a near barfight, a guy in a thong (yes he was the near barfight), a very public threesome (yes this involved the guy in the thong), and some pizza, I feel we all earned the right to sleep in this morning...  We were able to find Leo somewhere in NYC yesterday and after a fun breakfast catching up, we dragged his ass into the Birdcage and put him to work. As predicted and hoped for, Leo again left his mark on EXIT STRATEGIES. Let me be frank with you, I was handling problems in my other professional life, but Leo, at B's direction (Earn that producing credit, son!) did some sweet ass backing vocals for THE MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE. I had many ideas for backing vocals for this, but they went way out of my range (and believe me I tried), but Leo really came up with some great stuff that I think really punctuates the choruses significantly. While doing all this, Leo somehow fixed a recent font related problem in my computer, for which I am very very greatful, while giving me thousands of new fonts to play with!   We then gave Leo a playback of the song we wrote with him and Jamie Duffy, OUR FAITH, because he hadn't heard our changes. There weren't many other than my new vocals, so he he was really into it. He will be playing his own version of the song with his band, AM PACIFIC, at their upcoming shows in LA. You can't get a better compliment than that! After some Great Wall, we put a guitar in his hand. Brandt had wanted him to tackle LENINGRAD, but honestly I feel that song is truly developed, so, as mentioned in a previous entry, I knew we could do more to 1956, so we got him on the verses and boy did this turn out to be one of my better decisions. I won't give much away, but it's still getting further away from Primal Scream and closer and closer to Hypefactor. The effort is worth it, and like Charles before him, Leo now has opened new doors to this song that I think are going to make for an amazing final song. We're almost there with that track.  Thanks to Leo, always the pro, for coming in and really pushing our material forward again...  Later, I met back home with Irene for some Pluck U (which means she worked late and is too tired to fight me on the topic of dinner) and then had a few drinks with the ladies of Internationalpoontang.com, some of whom are quite sunburnt from extended sunbathing on either Long Island or Asia, depending on which poontanger you are speaking to. Congrats to Poontanger D on her new digs and the excellent drinks and kudos to whoever made the jello shots that Dan Hamill and Irene consumed like it was nobody's business.  From there we were off to see the Face, back in action. I think I missed a gig due to an LA visit, so I was psyched. I think I have mentioned my hatred of the venue, Sine-E, before, mostly because of their horrible technical problems. This time, the face were problem-free and the gig was another enjoyable experience. If anything, my dear comrade Mr. Peter is far too prolific for his own good. I feel like we're on album 5 when I don't even own album 1. Right when I get attached to a song, he goes and writes three more. My concern is that songs I loved a year or two ago will never see the light of day in my ipod. I know the album will own and don't get me wrong, the guy doesn't write a bad song. It's just we're 5 albums in when I still want albums 1-4. I love the man, I love his band, (and yes you SAW me singing along to the last song, Joe) and I say all this purely out of love for the music that I want to own. As a musician, I understand not wanting to be stuck playing the same songs over and over again, but songs like I LOVE YOU, MADLY and THERE IS A ROOM (which I'm certain has to be on the album) got you to the dance and got a lot of people in that venue last night. Give them the hits, lads, give them the hits!  We spent some time with the lads after the show. Peter, B and I discussed the HF album, and while he has his head around EXIST, melodically, CLEAN UP is a problem, so we are going to get Peterface into the Birdcage in July to work on it as a gang. I have now given him a deadline and he promises to stick to it. He's the last person we need to finish recording this album (No pressure, guy!).  Then at some randumb (intentional spelling) lower east side bar that seemed straight out of 1981, Dan Hamill didn't like the way a drunk man (with his thong exposed and shirt lifted) was treating one of our friends and he made this known. Dan Hamill is not an easy man to provoke so when I accidentally walked into this I just stood quietly backing him up while he defended the honour of our friend. I'm still not sure what this was all about, quite frankly. In fact, I am going to try to ask him to write something for the blog explaining, but he made quite an impact on this crew. After, one of the guys, obviously intimidated by my beard while backing up Dan Hamill, tried to sweet talk me, and I responded with "As long as none of my friends are fucked with, you'll be ok". After that, they went to the back of the bar so the guy in the thong could resume his dry humping of the two girls who were making out (yes we have photos). We have travelled all over the world with very few problems, or three ways so this is one for the books just to see Dan Hamill as Harrison Ford. I already respected that kid, but after last night, I respect him more.  The lovely day ended with a slize of pizza and garlic knots for my girl and I. As Leo and I sing in a song: Mas Bien.  +F

      I'm leaving shortly to go to the studio to work with B and our special guest Leo V23, who is in town for a spell and has been roped into to add even more to this album (hopefully in the form of some sharp backing vocals). I'm psyched to have Leo on our turf for a change and I expect a productive day (once we stop talking about the genius of Cerati). Stay tuned.  In the meantime, last night, Irene and I checked out RUNNING ON KARMA starring my man Andy Lau and the beautiful Cecilla Cheung, at the 2004 New York Asian Film Festival. I might have discussed this film when I saw it some months ago (I'm a big fan), so the chance to see it on 35mm in a screening room was a must do for me. Irene had heard about it and had wanted to see it as well, so that got us to the theatre on time. Seeing a HK film on a movie screen in a movie theatre brought me back to my youth when I would sneak down to the Bowery (aged 10) to see whatever new movies were coming out of HK. Sadly there are no more Chinatown movie houses, so one must recapture their youth at these new kind of events. But the feeling was great. Go to the festival before this week is out. Some awesome movies are playing (like HERO and INFERNAL AFFAIRS). You can learn about at the Festival at http://www.subwaycinema.com/frames/nyaff04home.htm  Meanwhile, and I'm not sure why she bought this, while we were wandering about the upper west side the other night (don't tell anyone we were up there), Irene picked up the Ryan Adams CD LOVE IS HELL. Now, honestly, the guy seems to be a douche. When I first saw him, he was a douche singing in front of the Twin Towers and happened to grab some press because he filmed it before the Tradge (as it's called here). He's always in NME being, well a douche and because he lives nearby here, until recently I would see him quite a bit, quite often at the Gramercy, looking like, well, a douche, and usually with extremely funny but insane movie star girlfriend (who I hope is not a douche). He was recently photographed at my least favourite bar ever Black and White, which confirmed his huge douchedom. Also the cover of this album has two photos of himself, which makes it twice the necessary daily dose of doucheness.  I'm under the impression Irene bought this for Adams' cover of Mr. Gallagher's WONDERWALL, which is quite legendary if you read NME enough like I do. I'm told this CD is two EP's combined into one CD because his label, obviously douches, felt the material was "too dark" to release as a full length. Well thats kinda wack because this CD is REALLY awesome. And the Oasis cover does live up to the NME hype. Yes it's dark, but his lyrics are solid and his melodies are sweet and I keep going back to the CD, no matter how many times I have the urge to listen to Ministry ;-)  Well, thumbs up for that douche at the Gramercy. The fucker can write some tunes. Lesson learned: look beyond on the douche and listen to the tunes. You'll be shocked what you hear.   Do that with Ass Cobra as well.  F

      Matt is obviously poopy from the lack of aggression in his life, so let me tell you about the Skinny Puppy shows. The fact of the matter is, as Irene put it, this was a "reunion" show and no matter how much we loved this kind of stuff back in the day, and I was fortunate enough to see Puppy in 1992 (the best year ever), whatever we were about to see in 2004 just wasn't going to be the same thing. For some, like my significant other, this make the show skippable. For me, I can appreciate the challenge that was laying ahead for Mssrs. Key and Ogilvie.  Most of my interest in this was helped by the fact that the new album is really good. I respect their NOT going back and doing something they had done before (screw you diehards), so I expected them to do something different live. The quick comparison: Puppy was very performance art based in the old days, tons of props, big set, etc, which you could pull off back then without losing your shirt. in 2004, its impossible to pull off a big stage show, so the emphasis was focused on musical performance and to that effect, a guitarist/bassist was added as well as a drummer, while Mr. Key manned the keyboards. Honestly, I think that his moving from drums (he is amazing) to keyboards was perhaps the only true error of this tour. His style is unique and while I'm not knocking the drummer they had (he too was amazing), it did take away from their particular sound.  It seems I have spoken negative about this, but quite honestly, I had a blast, especially the first night. In an unusual move for me, I avoided reading about setlists, so I went into it all fresh. it was an open book for me. They played a great range of material spanning their whole career, including gems like GLASS HOUSES, TIN OMEN, TESTURE and INQUISITION, and other "hits". I was impressed by the way the music was presented and I thought the live versions, particularly of the olders stuff like SMOTHERED HOPE, were sharp without insulting the original versions. I would like to note that Ash marked out like a maniac at this gig, which is a big compliment. Also, we got TWO encores at this gig, which I'm told is very rare on this tour. By the time I left the first night, I was pumped to see it again.  The second night was interesting in that its like seeing a movie you really liked for the second time and you find things you like even more and now a few things you didnt like as much. But nothing I hated and I wasn't as excited as I was the first night, obviously, but it allowed me to appreciate the show more. I had heard from TODD RYAN (I spell his name in caps, so you can all yell at him), that Puppy had rehearsed 18 different set lists, but the set list was pretty much the same the second night. We stood in a different spot and got a better view than the night before, so it was fun to watch even more. Ogre's voice was much better the second night, and the music seemed tighter, but the crowd and the vibe was lacking the second night.   However, just when I was ready to get myself a drink, out of nowhere they brought out Grandpa Al to guest on TIN OMEN. It was 1992 (the best year ever) all over again. I don't think Al was plugged in, and he seemed quite zombified (and industrial Ozzy), but the idea of Al guesting with Puppy after all these years on a classic song he helped produce was enough for the crowd to lose their shit and for the 19 year old in me to flash a wide smile. It may not have been a classic performance, but it was certainly a classic moment. And in this day and age, a classic moment here and there with our old heroes is good enough...even if they look like theyre straight out of WEEKEND AT BERNIES.  F

      first the "sad" news...  http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story?id=6197868&pageid=rs.Home&pageregion=single1   next, skinny puppy was alright.  i didn't walk out with the shock and awe i was expecting or that i had seen before - but i also didn't walk out.  the guitarist/bassist guy - no complaints.  the drummer - no complaints.  cEVIN key - well, quite honestly he's fat, but he seemed appreciative of the crowd.  ogre - homeboy can't navigate his own costumes, but that's ok - he's canadian.  but on the whole, you spend two nights in NYC and you alter the set by one...two?...songs?!?!?!  sure we got some bonuses that most cities won't: smothered hope on the first night as an extra encore and Al "i don't KNOW what to say about him" Jorgensen on "guitar" for tin omen - i'll let someone else comment on that one...i'm left speechless.  but seriously, even the aggression would switch things up for gigs within a short time period (btw - i've heard they might be making a comeback). the techs for the band SUCKED as there were multiple occasions when ogre was left sans mic or mic stand or both.  and let's not even get into the crowd.  i give the first show a generous 3 out of 5 for the first night and a 2.5 for the second.  they highlight of last night was seeing the ESPN Radio dodgeball interviewer who remembers chatting with irene at length - like that's shocking ;)

      I keep talking about how we are in the home stretch, and while these songs are pretty much up to snuff and just need drum edits before mixing, one song, called one.nine.five.six (which I'll herein refer to as 1956) has plagued us. It's been through several arrangement changes, and everyone has had a feeling for sometime that this track was not quite there yet. So now, thanks to our newest addition Charles breathing new melodic life into the song by adding some new basslines, I was now ready to tackle Track 2 of the new Hypefactor album, which by the way, is the angriest, heaviest song HF has ever done, and will appeal to the few aggression fans who might pick this record up someday.  This song was intended to be our Primal Scream homage. And while it's still a nod to Booby G and co, I decided to loosen the reigns while molding this song into shape. Again, kudos to Charles for his solid work the other night. Because of him, I was able to blow this tune wide open. The track is very loop-based and repetative in nature, so I decided to go over all of these parts with a fine comb. Doing so, I found that these verses could be cut in half without losing the intensity of the song. Originally, the song opened with a quick POW, similar to the aggression's CHEMICAL SUN or Primal Scream's MISS LUCIFER, but after going through these loops, we found several loops and feedback guitar (and of course some of Charles' bass) that I loved and was able to turn these into a cool new intro . B and I agreed that the intro should remain loop based so when the song starts, the impact of the drums guitars will hopefully knock the listener on their ass. At least that is the intention.  During all this, Brandt's musical brain was working overtime and we tracked some new melodic guitars to put over the non-vocal verses. That nailed it as far as I was concerned.   And by the time it was over, 1956 had evolved into something new and exciting. It's in good enough shape for me to now lay down some vocals this coming week, but don't be surprised that once we have the vocals and live drums edited in that this song goes through another draft (mostly because there are so many loops that can probably be removed once Robin's drums are in). Not bad for a song that started 2 years ago with the aggression fooling around with laptops and guitars in my parents living room.  SPEAKING of the aggression, they will have a CD out in early 2005 featuring 14 (mostly unreleased) remixes from the course of their entire history. I'll get further into this as time progresses and details have emerged, but as Dan Hamill says "Nostalgia is IN". It is nice though to meet people who appreciate the aggression and their body of work and who want to hear more.  Keeping it old school I-Rock, The MOGpac at Skinny Puppy tomorrow and Monday, look for us. I'm the one with the beard (facial hair, not Ash)  F

      Between an evening at the movies and a night in the studio, Thursday was a good day in MOGworld. This week I edited drum tracks for  Exit Strategies  about eight hours every day, so it felt really fucking liberating to do something  else  for one evening, even if sitting in front of a G4 PowerBook was still involved.  At last Saturday's dodgeball league tournament, the organizers were kind enough to give every team free passes to a screening of the new Ben Stiller/Vince Vaughn flick  Dodgeball . Vince is consistently fantastic, but Stiller is a hit-or-miss comedy writer (see  Envy ), so I was not expecting brilliance when I met FJ, Irene and her coworker at the Kips Bay Loews yesterday. And while this movie is not mediocre (though many will call it that), nor is it stunning (and a few may call it that), we laughed. A lot. Like  Zoolander , some gags were bizarre or simply did not make any sense. But the great material veers between brilliant one-liners ("You're as useful as poo-flavored lollipop!"), cruelty ("You were adopted. Your parents don't even love you.") and pottymouth laughs (a bar called The Dirty Sanchez), not to mention the nut-punching physical comedy. The non-sequitors and Mexican jokes also had us in stitches.  By the time FJ and I reached my block of Maiden Lane, Charles was already outside. We had planned a full band gathering at the studio yesterday, but Ash and Robin both bowed out for personal reasons. So rather than summit about the progress of  Exit Strategies  with everyone, we focused on three specific songs with Charles that needed bass overdubs or full-on rewrites. As the live drum edits came together for the record, we took the time to replay or completely refashion many instrumental takes recorded against drum loops. The recent addition of Charles to the hypefactor studio crew gave even FJ - typically reticent to re-record anything - impetus to erase a slew of old parts and start from scratch. In the case of the song "Solar," last night marked the third time we had revisted the song's bass part. On "Exist" and "Oneninefivesix," early performances that we found somewhat lackluster were axed as well. We blew through the three songs quite quickly as Charles works at a steady pace and possesses a drum machine's sense of tempo, enabling us to keep takes to a minimum. There were some slow points during "Solar" and "Oneninefivesix," although I chalk that up to the fact that Charles was exhausted and I was pushing him to both write  and  play long, seamless takes for both songs. A bit much for midnight on a Thursday, perhaps, but he pulled it off.  While the work we did last night may seem mundane, I cannot stress the significance of the evening enough in terms of improving band dynamic. FJ and Charles had never been in a room together under creative circumstances (as FJ missed the "Descriptive" session in May for a Los Angeles trip), so it was important that they get a feel for each other (in a completely straight way.) By the end of the evening, FJ and Charles were avidly reminiscing about obscure 80s new wave (Nik Kershaw) and other "stuff," so all in all I would say it was a stellar session. Most importantly, Charles is smitten with the hypefactor material.  Plans tonight include !!! live at Bowery Ballroom, followed by another day in the studio tomorrow morning working on "Oneninefivesix" with FJ. The sold out !!! gig will almost certainly be a hipster clusterfuck, so I can only hope the set will be worth it (and better than Out Hud.) But I would settle for a mediocre set with an indie celebrity sighting (like Le Tigre's Kathleen Hanna moseying down West Fourth Street last Friday.)

      Well, after months of anticipation, Irene and I were finally able to stay in town long enough to join MOG Athletics' Dodgeball Team for their second tournament. The whole experience was quite funny and enjoyable. It's an organized monthly tournament filled with a few hundred 20 and 30 somethings, all of whom take this game either quite seriously or in some cases, FAR too seriously. But believe me, those who took it far too seriously were heckled by the MOGpac and their cheerleaders, consisting of some of the ladies from Internationalpoontang.com. Most of the other teams were cool, but some were massive douches, but I guess in retrospect, it made it more fun to have heels to boo at (though people like the Douches of Rock, as I called them, reminded me way too much of why I never embraced the world of organized athletics or High School for that matter).  We had a solid (much better than I thought) and ethusiastic team, led by Matt, who is a focused and determined Captain and the man who scored our most dramatic victory. It was exciting to cheer him on as he claimed a huge victory when we he was outnumbered. It was easily the highlight of a very enjoyable day. Everyone played their hearts out and you can't ask for more than that. There were several times I was worried about Irene and Robin getting smacked around a bit (especially after hearing how robin was smashed in "the womb" last time), but everyone ended the day in good shape (and with free passes to the see movie DODGEBALL this week).  This was followed by a fun afternoon of beer and food at some German place uptown and a nice long walk back home to Gramercy. Of course the evening was spent dead on the couch watching my newly purchased FREAKS AND GEEKS DVD. I remain in extreme pain as I type.  Meanwhile, in the musical world, a remix the aggression did for the band DUBOK, has surfaced on their website www.Dubok.net. There's a pro and con this. The pro is that something I have worked hard on is now available and is receiving some nice comments, and the con is that this EP (which features lots of remixes by a lot of great artists that you can also download) was supposed to be released by Tinman last year, with the aggression's remix EP for THESE MILLION NIGHTS to follow it on the schedule.   In my heart of hearts, I kept hoping I would hear from Tinman asking them for the EP so we could get the last of the aggression's FLOOD-era material out. It might in fact be the last ever aggression release. There are some amazing remixes that have yet to be heard from artists all over the world who busted their asses at my request. It makes me look like an idiot to them and makes us look flakey to the few fans who have seen the EP teased on theaggression.com and Tinman's site (which hasnt been updated since last October) and want to buy it. I have tried repeatedly to contact Tinman to resolve this as well as to get copies of my records, in particular the first HF CD, of which we have no copies of. I know we're not a band thats sells many records, but the last thing I want to do is not be able to release something thats been advertised. More if and when I know.  I'm hearing good things about the Skinny Puppy tour, which member of the MOGpac will be attending here down the block from me one week from today. Some of us (like me) are going to both nights. I have a good feeling about this show.  And I'm wondering, does Brandt wear his dodgeball kneepads when he mixes?  F

      Well, hipsters, I'm looking forward to seeing you at the Cure's travelling festival next month and if you see me there, you can thank Mattagement because thanks to a Ticketmaster screw up, the Internet Pre-Sale didn't start as scheduled and computer glitches made it EXTREMELY difficult for Dan Hamill and I to obtain our tickets this morning. Jokingly, I said to G "If we don't have tickets in 5 minutes, I'm bringing Matt in", but then when I realized the situation wasn't improving, I, in fact, had to call in the trusty pal/manager. I was desparate. Matt, being Matt, once again brings good ticket karma to the table. As I conferenced called him and G on my cel while I rode through New York City in taxi cab on my way to the studio (normally, I take the subway, but I had to make myself available to the lads to get into my account to get the tix), Matt worked a miracle and was able to get the 4 tickets we needed for myself, Irene, G and Ash. Kudos to Matt, who's not even going to the gig (but he is seeing them in the South of France in a few weeks, so don't shed any tears for the fucker). This should be a good show. The Cure never disappoint and I haven't had a chance to see Interpol live, nor The Rapture. On the second stage, the music gods shine as Irene will finally get to see her beloved Muse and Dan Hamill will have the orgasmic time of his life experincing the hippy redheaded goodness that is Melissa Auf De Maur. And I'll laugh the whole time, I'm sure!  Anyhow, this ticket fiasco made me incredibly late for the studio, so we rushed right into the album's opening track, THE MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE. This song was written well within my vocal range, but what happened since I did the scratch vocals is that Ash came in and re-wrote the bassline, thus changing the whole dynamic of the song. Also, this was my first time hearing Robin's live drums and they are nothing short of excellent!! She OWNS this album, but I needed to spend considerable time re-adjusting the vocal melodies to fit the new material. Of course, we got a better song out of it, but it took quite a while to do. I was able to get everything down eventually, but it took a lot of effort. However, I'm quite happy with the final result. I had a lot of ideas for backing vocals, but they are way out of my range, so we are contemplating bringing in a female vocalist. I also heard Brandt's new closing guitars and closing edit of DESCRIPTIVE, our new B-Side, and it's mega. We just need to get those verses in shape next. I did speak at length with Ash yesterday about this and 1956, so I think we're going to see the Factor Corp gathered together in the next week.   Luckily, I finished my work today in time to make it to lunch with famous comic book artist currently drawing a popular book with an "X" in the title. We had a fun and productive 2 and a half hour lunch, and I really enjoyed my time with him. Plus he signed a copy of his latest hit for me! Speaking of comic books, the first issue of DC's big summer event book IDENTITY CRISIS, by bestselling author Brad Meltzer, came out today and it's pretty flipping amazing. This is a MUST READ. And since we're on the topic, big kudos to my friends at DC Comics for having the stroke of genius to create a DC Direct figure based on the old Earth-2 Robin. This is my dream toy and an wonderful, unexpected shocker. Can't wait for that!  And lastly on the can't wait front, thank you Mr. Lucas for allowing Cartoon Network to make a second season of CLONE WARS next year. Just don't screw up Episode 3, ok?  F

      Obviously he's been too busy staring at the birds across the way, as Brandt, in his genius, totally skipped over our Memorial Day session at the studio, which was in fact the First Official Vocal Session (tm) of the album. Let's start with this: I love writing lyrics, I like coming up with melodies, but I hate singing. Hate it. If I had my way, HF would have its own singer, but the only man I feel to be worthy enough to be the HF frontman has his own band to worry about, but he occasionally graces us with a vocal or two when it counts. You may have read about him here before.   In the aggression, it was easier because you could get away with not being perfect because we would just slap distortion over it. Hypefactor, fortunately (or unfortunately) is different. Doing vocals with Brandt is a much different experience than working with Tom and Ash on FLOOD. Quite honestly, while I love the lads, recording the vocals for FLOOD with those two mo's was a horrible and frustating experience as they kept forcing on me what they wanted as opposed to making the most out of what I am capable of doing vocally (which isn't much to begin with, but hey, you try it).   Brandt, while often a slow-mo, has the know-how to get the best performance out of me. He understands my range and what I can and can't do. What I learned from the last HF CD was that I work best demoing my scratch vocals and then listening to them for a month or so before coming in to record the final tracks. This approach also helps me in places where I feel the lyrics might be weak. I always carry my little lyric book with me to jot down revisions, so when the time comes to record the final vox, I'm ready to go.  One final thing I thought was important to this process was my desire to record my vox against the real drums recorded for the album. Brandt has been editing the drums in bits and pieces, so if something had a real drum edited together, I focused on those first. I felt having the real drums to sing against would create the right emotion for each song as opposed to singing to loops. This went out the door somewhat when I started getting into the groove of things but lets see what happens when the drums are all in there.  Because a lot of prep has gone into the vocals BEFORE I step into Brandt's bathroom to record, we're able to hit the ground running and this past Monday was no exception. We started with CREATION PHASE, and were able to wrap that up very quickly over several hours. Brandt would record several tracks of me recording different things in different ways so we had the pick of the litter later on when mixing. With this track we had the new ending that Ash, B and I wrote and I was able to come up with something on the fly to add to ending. It's a short vocal passage, but perfect in terms of the song coming to it's conclusion. This one is a stormer.   After a long tea and biscuit break, We then tackled SOLAR, the album closer. This had partial drums but I got caught up in the song, so we laid down the whole song over the course of a few hours. Again the same approach of recording several different takes was applied. Also note, Brandt is a stickler for detail. If I fucked up a nuance of a vocal, I was ordered (in a nice way) to re-take it. This kid is determined to make this album as live and as real as possible and I think he just doesnt want to have sit and play with auto-tune for a month. Needless to say, i did my best and he didnt argue or make fun of me too much, though he keeps telling me to sing "More Gay" on the mushier songs like SOLAR.  Feeling the vibe, I asked him to roll THEME FROM PROPAGANDA, which isnt a song as much as it is the dance ceterpiece of the album. I originally wanted to leave it alone, but I had an idea to take an Undeworld-y approach to it, so we put a lof of effects on the vocal and I just improvd a bunch of random lyrics about clubs, coat checks, and assorted random BS that you hopefully not be able to make out when you hear the final song. I'm not sure what I did here, and I don't think B did either, but hey.  So we're off to a good start. B has already filled you in on our Spanish Language Experience (tm), which was scary and fun. Luckily, Leo did all the hard work in advance, so I just had to make sure I was pronouncing everything properly. This is a lot harder than it sounds, kids. Anyway, I'm very high on this track, OUR FAITH, and the album itself here in the late stages is evolving into something better than what I thought it could be a month ago.  There is still more work to be done, but luckily my next two songs, THE MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE, and ONE.NINE.FIVE.SIX are currently in the very capable musical hands of Brandt and Charles, respectively. Until they do their things on those tracks, I can't cut my vocals for those tracks, and I don't want to be in a position where I do vocals and then someone alters something musically in the song. In the meantime, I have to finish lyrics and verse melodies for DESCRIPTIVE. This will keep me occupied as I'm trying a whole new approach (for me) to lyric writing and vocal recording with this song. Brandt touches on it below, but I'll get further into it later on.  Special thanks to my man Bisquit for sending me the studio version of RevCo's CATTLE GRIND (hilarious)!  F

      I almost forgot to mention...  In non-hypefactor news, a recent Guardian newspaper interview with Scotch charmer Kelly MacDonald included some wonderful news for fans of British drama (such as myself). The BBC ordered a second season of  State Of Play , a six-part series about investigative reporters and political corruption in modern-day London that debuted in the States last month. While substantially shorter than MOG favorite  24  - it is customary for a British TV season to run a mere eight or nine episodes - the two shows share a great deal in terms of pacing (relentless action, frantic dialog, radical camera cuts, heart palpatations.) In the first season, the i-team tied a government researcher's murder and a drug shooting to an energy scandal in the British parliament, with plenty of unexpected twists. Admittedly no arms were severed in the making of the series, but this program can effortlessly hold a candle to  24  or any other mystery-action show.  Need more convincing? The original cast, most of whom are tipped to return, includes MacDonald, John Simm (Bernard Sumner in  24-Hour Party People , a raver in  Human Traffic ) and Bill Nighy (the aging rock star in  Love Actually ), among countless others. And MacDonald, despite being married to a twit who plays bass in Travis, is worth the price of admission alone. Sadly, the BBC is rubbish when it comes to issuing DVDs in a timely fashion, and the first season of  State Of Play  is no exception: The Beeb's Web site lists a release date in February 2005. I hope, however, that BBC America will run the series a few more times in the interim for those who missed MacDonald's gorgeous accent. And the other stuff, of course.

      For the second post in a row the MOGpac heads south of the border. The circumstances: FJ and I booked another 10 a.m. session at BIrdcage on Wednesday to continue work on vocals. The day was unique, however, in that we decided to tackle a vocal track for the song "Our Faith." Which, as it happens, is sung entirely in Spanish... a language that neither FJ nor I speak.  The backstory in 100 words or less: I demoed in the song in the fall of last year, then FJ came and re-arranged it. Jamie Duffy of Acumen Nation/DJ? Acucrack/Chemlab stopped in the studio and added guitars, followed by another few months of writing/arranging. Then, in March, we mailed the computer files for the song to Leo Canneto (Virus 23/AM Pacific), who recorded more guitars and a Spanish lead vocal while FJ visited him in Los Angeles. A Gustavo Cerati homage, basically, and a damn good one at that.  While FJ knew he wanted the song to be a duet of sorts, he came to the studio with no real arrangement game plan yesterday. One idea floated earlier was to mix Leo's Spanish vocal with FJ singing in English. But after listening to the track on loop for about an hour, we realized that altering or eliminating any significant part of Leo's vocal to accomodate FJ was, well, pretty fucking stupid. It is a brilliant vocal, so why fuck with it? But in keeping with the duet plan, FJ saddled himself with the challenge of learning Leo's vocal in Spanish and doubling it. And he rose to the occasion, I must say, as he hammered the song out word-for-word over the course of a couple hours. One of his strongest deliveries yet.  We also found the time to track a rough vocal for a chorus of "Descriptive" yesterday, marking the first time we have ever recorded a vocal so early in a song's gestation. There is not much to write yet because the song is far from complete, but I think the final version of this particular vocal will be one of the finest performances FJ ever commits to tape. I predict that will be a difficult session, however, as the tune requires a delicate croon unlike most anything recorded by either hypefactor or The Aggression. More on how this plays out once we have the verse figured out...  Aside from the vocals, I have been putting in a lot of hours at the studio editing drums and trying to keep the album on schedule. "The Morning After The Life Before" is the priority song right now; we recorded a slew of guitar and bass overdubs in late April and early May, and we want to wrap up the vocals within a week. Once the live drums are mixed with some programmed rhythms (courtesy of Ash's wonderful TR-909 and, perhaps, Robin Emmet), this song will be a monster worthy of comparison to recorded music's best album openers. Modesty? Not in this case.  Also near the front of the editing line is "One.nine.five.six," the aborted song we recovered from The Aggression's final demo sessions. A vocal session for that tune will have to wait, however, as FJ and I agreed earlier in the week that Charles should be invited to re-write and re-track the bass line. While FJ and I have been on the same page from day one about what the song  should  be ( Exterminator  and  Evil Heat -era Primal Scream, mostly), we both seemed to have reservations about our instrumental execution. In an effort to breathe some new life into our thinking, we gave Charles a wide berth in terms of what he can write and record, and I hope his ideas will allow us to revisit the guitar and vocal melodies later this month. If his performance on "Descriptive" is any indication, Charles' playing will properly anchor the song, and that is exactly what it needs.  And now for a non-sequitor: While the Birdcage studio (aka my apartment) has three rooms, most of the recording takes place in a room tucked in the northeast corner (as it is farthest away from my fifth-floor neighbors and, therefore, less noisy.) This is also the only room with a clear view of neighboring apartments, as it abuts directly on two other buildings. Lately, the view from my mixing desk has been getting more and more Cinemax. About two months ago, my distant neighbors decided to eat dinner in their lingerie. Last week, the people whose kitchen window looks out on the studio had some sort of professional photo shoot in their space, replete with many shirtless men. And last night, in a moment that would have thrilled Ash, I sat editing drums while a girl in the same kitchen walked around for ten minutes... topless. Now who said studio work was boring?

      If you weren't at Rothko's on Friday night, you missed it, meng.  I caught my first (and rare, for a NYer) glimpse of what would have been the result if Stephen Patrick Morrissey had been born in Tijuana instead of Manchester.  This well-coifed man is Jose Maldonado, on loan from LA's Sweet and Tender Hooligans.  He's got the hair, he's got the specs, he's got the cuffed jeans, he's got the cardigan, the paisley paisley shirt (i think it was paisley), the malnourished yet amorphic physique - but more than anything else, he's got the voice and the on-stage disposition and relationship with the audience that truly captures his idol's mystery.  much unlike the fag (oh btw the douche - NO ONE LIKES YOU) that used to head up the Salford Lads (btw, guitarist John "Johnny" Capp if you're reading this - how's RVC, pally?), Jose possesses class.  ash and i walked out on a Lads gig 4+ years ago at Don Hill's because the fagsinger was such a (coining G) nightmare.  back to the gig - kicking it off with the Queen is Dead, a few forgotten lyrics are quickly forgotten as he belts out the outro "life is very long when your lonely", the set consisted of standard Moz and Smiths tunes including Shoplifters (sent out to Winona Ryder), Last of the Famous..., Girlfriend in a Coma, November Spawned a Monster and This Charming Man.  The Lads even assembled a great rendition of First of the Gang to Die off the new one.  All in all, SummerMan, my recently legalized S.O. and her teacher friend were all thoroughly impressed by the performance.  did i mention the four go's right in front of brandt and me that led us to make a pact to never smith smiths/moz tunes to each other?  i'll let him tell you about those guys.  i'll leave you with a post i left on the Sweet and Tender Hooligans yahoo group in true fan appreciation...  hey all -  brand new to the group and i joined just to say thanks to Jose for making the trip out here - your performance was jaw-on-the-floor amazing. the last time i caught the Lads i WALKED OUT because the old lead singer was so terrible - in talent and personality - but that's neither here nor there.  i'm sorry i didn't get a chance to catch up with you, but i expressed my appreciation to both ez and brian, the promoter. you kids in LA are damn lucky to have this guy as i'm sure you are aware!  hope to see you out east again sometime soon. cheers. matt.  JOSE MALDONADO REPLIES: Thanks for that, Matt. Sweet and Tender Hooligans played at The Knitting Factory New York last October and hope to return very soon. I was real happy to come back and visit The Big Apple again and I'll more than likely be back to run the marathon. Hmm.. maybe I can work a gig around that..?    PS - someone had to respond to me...  From:  "Jeremy Alisauskas"    Date:  Mon May 31, 2004  4:43 am Subject:  Re: [Sweet and Tender Hooligans] NYC gig...  How very cruel of you sir!  Terrible in talent and personality? well if you walked out than you certainly didn't speak with him, so how may I ask do you know anything about his personality?  Thats just a nasty thing to say, and being nasty doesn't make you look cool, it makes you look insecure.  Goodnight Sir!    AND I SAY THIS TO YOU MR. JEREMY ALISAUSKAS...being a dick-sucking homo doesn't make you look cool, it makes you look GAY! \ / Sir!

      There is literally never a moment of rest this month as I woke up at 4am, got on a 7am plane, flew to NY, walked in the door, kissed Irene hello, ate some Pluck and then ran off to see Saintface in Brooklyn at my favourite venue Southpaw. The band were in TOP form and played with a lot of energy and the sharp musicianship I come to expect from these lads. Also, they played some more of the hits, including my two current favourite songs, which proves this very blog has some sway. And yes, that's been confirmed. Anyhow, the gig was REALLY good, they were firey and had the swagger of a band that is confident and excited about playing music. I love that. Also, Peter pulled an old school Frank move by dedicating the last song to one of his many ex-wives, which to me is always a genius move, so respect to him to that. Of course said ex wife was one of the ladies of internationalpoontang.com, which made it all the more enjoyable.  Normally, this is where I would start bitching about their album, yadda yadda, but Peter has two days left of actual mixing. I told him I would be on his doorstep Wed morning ;-) I expect big things from this album and I doubt I will be disappointed. And you know it will be reviewed here first.  Speaking of reviews, a ton of CD's have showed up here in my absence that have yet to be consumed, such as the new Damage Manual Remixes, Pigfaces' crackhead (I love getting things early), the Cracknation Sampler (thanks El!), and two CD's by Gustavo Cerati's bandmate/programmer Leandro Fresco, who is AWESOME. Lots to listen to, but not enough time as our day will be spent on Randall's Island checking out the Curiosa Festival. To say Irene is psyched to see Muse would be like saying I am a casual Star Wars fan.  F.

      i've been in this city for an hour, and already i've seen:   1 transexual - pre or post-op, i can't confirm - we didn't get a chance to chat about it  2 asian men speaking french - which is one of the few things that freaks me out as much as midgets  3 homeless men  4 americans  and tons of rack!!!&nbsp; not necessarily exposed, but still there.&nbsp; the only things for me now that would complete my trip are my boyfriend (ashley)who appreciate the rack, my girlfriend (who would appreciate the rack as much as ash or me)&nbsp;and my luggage, which some french fuck forgot to put on my flight from paris to nice.&nbsp; you's think that since these fags aren't spending any money or man power in the mid-east that they'd at least get the whole "take the bag from this plane and put it on that plane down".&nbsp; HOWEVER - me being the winner that i am, my suitcase has already been checked onto the next flight down which arrives at 5pm local time (it's 1115am now) which means that since my baggage is more than three hours late and i bought my plane tickets thru AMEX, i get some sort of make-good in the form of $$$ :)&nbsp; happy, but to say that i can't wait to kick it former-eastern-bloc-turned-genocidal-dictatorship tomorrow in croatia is an understatement.&nbsp; fuck the eu.   i've been up for a full 24hours now, so as soon as my hotel room is ready i aim to sleep.   i wish my friends well and i'll check in with updates of uncharted lands soon.  NOTE TO FRANK: since you're into taking advice from the 5yo, what are his thoughts on REVENGE OF THE GAY?

      My nephew, Cameron J. Bradish, informs me that we must never, EVER talk to the Mondu, which is a korean dumpling that Irene's mom makes that is blow away the best dumpling I have ever had. However, we're not allowed to talk to the Mondu, especially when we are eating it. I trust this 5 year old, so I will proceed to eat said Mondu and never EVER speak to it. I wanted this on record.

      My LA trip is taking its toll, but it does allow me a few fun moments. Took a quick pit stop in to see the nephew, who is recovering from dental surgery, which could suck for a 5 year old, but some Yu Gi Oh swag can be super medicine. Also, ran into young assistant friend of Agent/Lawyer/Advisor who wants to quit the biz to play guitar. Good seeing him, but too brief. We have a tentative plan to meet at The Short Stop, owned by one Greg Dulli, later this week, but I have a feeling I'm gonna get swamped and have to cancel, which sucks.   I was able to end the evening on a high note for two reasons:  Firstly, Dr. Fury himself, the original aggression vocalist turned screenwriter, was in town and we were able to catch up at Ca'brea, which thank fuck, is still open and in fact being renovated. The sweetie who runs the place gave me the full report on the renovations and made me feel like I own the place. Fury and I discussed his recent adventures in Alaska as well as our respective businesses. He is often eager to hear of my musical adventures as I feel he secretly longs to be in music again. I think. Don't tell him I said, but tell him I DO appreciate him treating.  Nextly, I return to LA HQ to find a nice surprise in my E-box: an mp3 of Mr. Peter Saintface's vocal demo for the new HF song EXIST. I've had it on repeat repeatedly for some time and I am VERY VERY happy. He doesn't know this yet, but I love it and am quite happy. It's quite Depeche in nature. This is a very good thing. As always, Mr. Face was worth the wait and he gets a free drink from me when I hopefully see them back in NY on Friday night. I havent heard from Brandt on this song yet as he is in Chicago with family, but I have a feeling he will be pleased as well. More on this soon.  F

      The con was THIS close to a full success, mostly because I got screwed big time out of the convention only Batman figure. Lost the raffle every day. I suck. However, I scored a rare new BATMAN BEYOND Kubrick as well as a convention Teen Titans special Robin Mini Figure. I type this yet again in my SITH t-shirt, so the 2004 con will go down as the best so far.  So now its back to LA for the week until the Cure gig Saturday. I'm going to try and catch Saintface in Bklyn on Friday night if I am awake (Hello, Peter!). Not much to report here other than a brief but enjoyable phone conversation with Mr Pally Neet, who is in Albany being visited at the moment by Agent/Advisor/lawyer, who's room I type this from. My chat with Dan was a nice surprise and uplifiting. He is a good vibe. I hope to get my grubby Machine Rock hands on their new material sooner than later...probably before Die Warzau if they keep delaying!  Yes, I was seen at Skybar today, but I'm not proud of doing such LA things. Yes, I did make up for it by watching the awesome Iron Man match on Raw while eating Pizza. However, because former students turned pals have Direct we actually watched WWE on East Coast time, which has totally thrown me off. With Wrestling done at 8pm, I have no idea what to do with myself. Thus I am writing to you.  I had a brief scare on Sunday when Mrs. Cramp (and unborn child) attempted to eat at my favourite LA eatery, Ca'brea, last night and found it was closed. I panicked big time, but called tonight and they answered, so maybe they are just closed on Sunday in the summer. I hope. I will try to make it there tomorrow night with former aggression vocalist turned screenwriter turned parent. I'll keep you posted.  Back home, Irene informs me that Inv has sent some CD's. I think the Damage Manual remixes are in there, which is an interesting album to me. As you know, I adore my friend Connelly, but I felt the Damage Manual fell short, mostly because I thought the production wasn't up to snuff. The CD's sounded muddy (no pun intended, Neet) and failed to grab me like Murder Inc. did several years before.  The lackluster show Brandt and I saw them play years ago didn't help either. However, hearing remixes could allow the project to take on a new meaning for me. Ill keep you posted. It's a shame Chemlab doesnt have a remix album out...we know who to thank for that, i think.  Meanwhile, the UK trip gets even better, as Irene and I will be seeing Mr. Greg FUCKING Dulli himself and his Twilght Singers the day we get there. I will stay sober for this gig, I promise. Unless G shows, which isnt likely. I just got the tix and I am dead psyched, kids.  Hope you like the new Blog look. I had no idea I had OPTIONS, so I looked into it...

      The Rollercoaster I am on called ComicCon continues to run me ragged. I won't bore you with my true reasons for being here, thats part of my OTHER life, but I will tell you that it is exciting and exhausting to the extreme. I wouldn't trade the opportunity to be here for anything, its that much fun!  First off: Irene is down in DC, but is a winner here in SD as I have not only gotten her a rare NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS item (Kubrick related, of course) but she about to be the proud owner of a personally autographed lithograph by her fave artist, Mr. Michael Turner. I don't know Mr. Turner very well, but I appreciate his going to the extra step to personalize the autograph for my significant other. I think she's gonna be happy...  While working as well as searching for gifts for the nephew, cousin, and girlfriend, I took the opportunity, as I do every year here, to make some time for myself and attend the annual STAR WARS presentation along with 6,999 other people. This is always a highlight, especially when there is a new movie on the horizon. I'll skip over the details, you can always find them on the SW website, but being there for the first announcement of the new movie title, REVENGE OF THE SITH, at the end of the presentation, was something special for a diehard like myself. However, this is just where the fun begins...  Immediately after announcing said title, Steve Sansweet, the Lucas "guy" who gives these presentations, displayed a new tshirt with the new movie title/logo on it and announced the shirt would be onsale in "Five minutes at the Star Wars Pavillion" (which is huge, fyi). Well, you dont say that kinda of thing to 7,000 insane fans, who all then RAN, and I mean RAN to get the tshirt. I didnt rush as I had calls to return, but when I made it to the line, there were literally THOUSANDS of people in front of me. In fact, Con security had to cut the line for safety reasons and of course, I was part of the line that was cut. RRRRR.  Frustrated, I went on my way, not realizing I was walking past the back of the pavillion where said shirts were being sold. The securtiy people were so busy forcing people against the wall that they basically left the SW salespeople/cash registered unblocked, so yours truly had no problem walking RIGHT UP and buying a tshirt within 3 minutes and before they even let anyone get there!! In my perverted mind, I am the first person to ever buy a REVENGE shirt, but I know its not true, but ALLOW me the moment, ok? I got lucky here and was so scared that they were gonna bust me that I ran off as soon as I purchased the shirt. Within seconds, someone from Lucasfilm had grabbed me. I was ready to give the shirt back, but it was actually the girl working the register giving me my change!! I was so excited that I split before getting my money. While I am a sith badass for cutting thousands of people on line, she would make an honorable jedi for bringing me my change. Cheers to Lucascashregisterchick.  My other highlight of the evening: While on my way to dinner with a wonderful TV actress who I grew up watching and having a major crush on, I was stung by a bee for the first time in my life. It SUCKED. I don't recommend it. Especially when dining with TV stars. However, it was a great conversation piece, especially when putting a bag of ice on my swelling neck. Fortunately, no allergic reaction. Yet. Pray.  So its back to the Con for a bit tomorrow, then off to LA again for the week. I'm tired, but I have seen the wookie planet and thats enough to make me happy and sleep well.   Goodnight, all!  F

      Despite not being here for a few months, California is just how I left it: Sunny, hot, and filled with the usual suspects. I flew into town early to check out the rough cut of a certain movie that I am associated with that stars The One and current favourite actress who irene hates who lives near MOGworld despite being from accross the pond. I'm happy to say after 8 years, this movie has been worth it as it is great and you will hopefully all see it early 05.  The sweet irony of it was that the next day, while sipping tea at the Four Seasons at a table next to kevin Spacey (who has a very large head, yet is more handsome in person than you would think), the same current favourite actress came walking in looking nothing short of amazing and justifying my longtime love of her. Cheers, Ms. W.  I was only in LA briefly this week, sharing my time only with my lawyer/agent/advisor (now en route to NY) and cool as hell nephew who is the best. Thanks to Irene's moms for yet ANOTHER great meal. Cheers, Mama Bradish.  I'm now in San Diego for ComicCon and it is quite frankly overwhelming. Its too big, but the Star Wars stuff is great this year and I type while wearing my new Original Trilogy tshirt. God somehow blessed me that I can live with a hot chick, put out records, and make movies while being a HUGE geek of epic proportions. And no, despite what some may tell you, I am not dressed like Han Solo for the convention.  Being here at the moment puts my musical life on hold, but my art career is taking off. I have been asked by a new band (featuring ex members of my favourite all time industrial rock band) to create the new logo and look for the unit. I am excited about the challenge, so cheers to Ash and Ass Cobra!  Ill try and write back regarding the con, but quite honestly, its going to kick my ass until I head back to LA on Sunday morning. I will then be in NYC for only a few weeks before Irene and I FINALLY make our way to Europe for the long awaited vacation. We will hit the UK and pay a visit to the French. We will be lazy and eat well and see Primal Scream with the Louches. This is a good life, kids.   In the meantime, if youre in SD, say hello and come visit me at the Warners presentation tomorrow. i think you can figure out which presentation Ill be at with bells on.   Also, for you Hollywood types, read VARIETY today and you might see yours truly mentioned there.  F

      Since all is quiet due to MOGtravel, let me throw in a quick note about the Prince show I attended on Monday, 7/12.  Two words: UN-real.&nbsp; The man has been doing it for 25 years and he hasn't lost a nanogram of it.&nbsp; Prince is a pure entertainer and a damn fine one at that.&nbsp; He got the entire crowd into the show; so much so that even this writer caught himself clapping along once or twice (this as opposed to the standard folded arms with the "try to impress me" smugness on the face).  For a capacity crowd at the World's Most Famous Arena, Prince delivered hard.&nbsp; He played the hits, he played the old school, he played the hits and the old school on a stool with an acoustic guitar.  You could he missed the big shows.&nbsp; When he went into exile during the "slave" years due to fights with Warner Bros, he'd play epics sets in tiny European clubs - that's well and good but someone of his caliber belongs on the big stage - he feeds off of it.&nbsp; The louder the crowd got, the more intense he got.&nbsp; No one walked out of the show feeling in anyway disappointed (except for my sister who wanted to hear '1999' - I tried to explain to her that since we've passed the year 1999, that it was kind of a moot point) - and good thing too since the tickets weren't exactly price like an all ages Fugazi gig.  Prince, as expected, brought with him a stellar band.&nbsp; No, Sheila E was not there, but the 'precussionist', to his credit was outstanding.&nbsp; Prince also had one guitarist, bassist - both superb - two saxomaphonists - one of whom used to play with James Brown or something like that - a trumboner, and two keyboardists.&nbsp; All geniuses at their trade.&nbsp; And not to be out done, Prince can wail on the guitar.&nbsp; All the virtuoso rumors I had heard are TOTALLY valid.&nbsp; He started out with his traditional telecaster and eventually ended up with his signature swirly-glyph looking guitar.  I was truly happy I experienced this - and, to boot, everyone who walked in the building received a copy of his new album.&nbsp; That's full-service stardom.

      Well, the above phrase was uttered by MOGpac Athletics team captain Matt after the Pac lost a crucial dodgeball match to the tournaments first ever (at least from what I've seen) All-Girl team, and I think that sums up last nights D-ball performance. We managed to win one, but we suffered nothing but losses the entire evening.  About this loss to women, I put the blame squarely on the shoulders of G, The Kidd, and our newest player, the utterly useless (yet enjoyable to have around) Lurch, who saw this match as an opportunity to "play nice" and meet some girls. Since our team has girls, one of which is my own girlfriend, I felt no need to pull punches and eliminated several girls without mercy (and without injury). Matt I dont have to worry about as he doesn't respect women, Brandt, who played sleeveless and will never hear the end of it, is so young that he is still in his "girls are yucky" phase, and Irene and Robin ARE girls. My other three mates, however, we're thinking with their willies and we were served up a big hulking plate of defeat. THANKS GUYS. Of course I mean this all in good fun.  However, I must say, I had a ton of fun, even though weeknight dodgeball can be quite tiring as opposed to Saturday Mornings, in which you are rested and raring to go. I played all right, I guess. I think I played better than last time, but I was the victim of several bad calls and even got hot under the collar at one point with the ref, which is very unlike me (i was proven right though and allowed back). As a protest, I have decided to be the Brock Lesnar of D-ball and retire at the tender age of 31 to possibly return to my backyard wrestling career. If the money is right, I might return to D-ball, even though it has become a corporate monster of camera crews and Red Bull endorsements. I am about the GAME, the SPORT of Dodgeball.  Special thanks to Pete and Damon for no-showing at the last minute, leaving us short. Cheers, bastards. Also special thanks to G who brought the driest, least chewy, Chewy Granola bars ever. Asshole!  Anyhow, the night before was spent partially at the Birdcage, with me in the producers chair recording Brandt's new rythmn guitars for THE MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE, which had to be changed in light of Charle's recent bass revisions. B worked fast and with great skill and the night breezed by. I was only there a few hours, but left a very happy producer knowing that the opening track of the album will have the kick I want it to have. Brandt also threw in a few new brushstrokes which brought later parts of the song to life. Well played, guy.  B also posted the new version of 1956 for the others to hear and while we havent heard from Ash about it, Charles really was into it. In some instances, he couldnt tell the difference between his basslines and my new basslines, which to me is a HUGE compliment! We might get him to tweak some of his bass because I used different drums in certain places now in the song and he feels he could tighten his stuff up. Bring it on, I say.  I'm leaving for LA on Tuesday and B is off to Europa for a long spell on the 24th, but we're in super shape. The only thread dangling is Peter Saintface, who is mixing like a madman for S-face. We're patient people and he is worth waiting for as we have plenty to do. He's gonna sing two songs and is going to be the exclamation point on this album. To answer some of your E-mails, I have no idea when this record is coming out. Honestly, this is a new band starting basically from scratch and this album is crucial in defining who and what this band is and thus, it has to be perfect to us before you can hear. I love this record and won't sell it short, but damn am I itching to play some gigs with these people!  Tidbits: IDENTITY CRISIS might be the best comic book mini-series since KINGDOM COME. Congrats to my pal Mr. Carlin on editing a potential masterpiece...I just wrapped up Ric Flair's autobiography, which is wonderful, funny and educational when it comes to a business that I love, but have very little knowledge of. Foley's books are a tad better, but this comes close...I count the seconds until new record label PULSEBLACK gets up and running. It's the Die Warzau guys and all of their projects and I'm expecting huge things from them. The new DW songs are amazing...  I'm sure there's more, but the day must begin!  F

      First off, I just love the above title which is a quote from a description of the new Jackie Chan movie NEW POLICE STORY. My love of Jackie and his work is no secret to anyone, especially my lovely significant other who has to wake up every day to a wall of framed movie posters and photos and JC and me. Anyhow, I love the trailer for this new movie, so I'm hoping it's good. JC has supposedly decided to go back to HK and just make movies there for a few years. I can't say I disagree. When I'm not rushing to see his latest Hollywood work, we have a problem. It's ok JC, you made your millions, just do what you do best...  Speaking of doing what you do best, I found myself back at the Birdcage this weekend working again on problem-song 1956. We've got the musical part of the song in great shape, so now it was time for the next step. I had the lyrics and the vocal melody all ready to go and upon my first delivery, Brandt felt quite frankly that the approach was flat and needed more. Weeks of work down the drain in 10 seconds. However, it was the kick in the ass I needed because we sat there for quite awhile going through the track line by line and after a relatively short time, we had a new vocal melody cooking. Once I nailed the first verse, the rest of the song just poured out of me. It was a weird night and day experience in the studio, as I felt quite stymied early on and then suddenly, as if someone had flicked a switch, I was able to figure this song out with little trouble.  The other positive that came out of it was that while using a guitar to figure out certain notes for me to sing in the newer parts of the song Brandt, unbeknownst to himself, had written a new guitar part for the bridge. I convinced him to play what he was initially playing to figure out my vocal melody as a new solo. I then went and wrote a new vocal for the part and we had an even BETTER song.   And with this, and I'm probably jinxing myself here, my recorded contributions to EXIT STRATEGIES have come to a close. All that is left is one P. Saintface coming in to the studio to make some vocal magic happen. More on that soon...I hope.  With all of my musical work accomplished, I spent the later portion of the day/early evening with an assembled MOGpac at the annual German fest back home on the Island. Last year was a drunken mess of light and dark beers, sausage and potato pancakes. This year was a more reserved affair as we all got there much later, and we were all exhausted from our various musical projects (the Cobras had worked on tunes till 4:30am the night before and THEN rehearsed, which is a work ethic I can admire). Though brief, seeing the crew is always worth it.  Yesterday, Irene and I tried to sleep in, but there's just always something going on that keeps us from sitting still (In fact, I couldn't even get time to watch the WWE PPV till 1am last night). We checked out the off-Broadway show COOKIN', which is really good in a STOMP kinda way, but this time with Asian cooking. It made us quite hungry, so we immediately ate like champs. Of course, it was no rest of the weary as I spent the rest of my night with Country Music's finest, THE NASHVILLE ATTITUDE, fronted by my talented cousin Marc Vincent, who writes better original music than the covers he plays.   I'm catching up big time on recent music, but I'm too swamped too go in depth. But quickly: I'm shocked at how much I hate the new Prodigy album. I like the new Interpol, but felt it was too much of the same thing and they played it too safe. However, more tracks from the new Die Warzau album have emerged and I'm loving everything I'm hearing so far. That album has a lot of potential! Also, has anyone heard the new Clay People song FAILURE? It's a remix, but I like it. Mr. Neet, like Jimmy Marcus, remains one of the best singers ever in the genre and along with Jared, one of the best lyricists. No one can touch those two. Anyhow, the new Clay song reminds me of recent Chemlab. Funny, innit?  Little time, little sleep, but nothing to complain about, kids.  F

      Starting with this post, I will start a new section of this blog entitled "What I've Learned From..." in which when I feel I have learned something for better or for worse from someone. I will relay this to help you as the reader learn from our experiences here in MOGworld. These entries will appear when necessary.   The very first entry is: "What I've learned from Mike "The Kidd" Hess"  I have learned to never go into bars my siblings frequent and try to namedrop them when my friends and I can't get served because we are drunken douches. And if you want to get kicked out of said bar (the best pub in NYC) just say to the bartender: "BUT I'M IN THE AGGRESSION!"  This does not work. You have been learned.  F

      Beat from what seems like a week of non stop insanity, I will try to recollect the past few days to the best of my abilities.  First off, SPIDERMAN 2 was nothing short of excellent. I don't think it's any secret that I love the first hour of the original film and hate the second hour of bad CGI, plot holes the size of mars, and bad pacing. For me, and as some of you know, comic book movies are my "thing", and I can find very little I didn't like about SPIDEY 2. Every huge problem I had with the first movie, some of which are listed about, was addressed and it seems Sony has lifted the shackles off of Mr. Raimi and have allowed him to make not just a great superhero movie, but a great Sam Raimi film. A lot of the the quirkiness of his earlier work shines through here, and don't even get me started on the awesome Bruce Campbell cameo. Anyway, see it. Repeatedly.   As planned, the entire crew got together Thursday night for a long listening/commentary session on the current status of EXIT STRATEGIES. Well, they got half of the record, really, but mostly the stuff that have made leaps and bounds in recent weeks. Of everything, OUR FAITH, received an overhwelming thumbs up from the group as did all of Charles' recent contributions. Thats not to say everything was peachy keen. Charles and Ash (and occasionally poor Robin, who I think was asleep most of the time) had a lot to say, and luckily in our grown up post-aggression drama years, their comments can be taken as how they are intended: to HELP improve the material. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean I agree with all of what they say, but these are the people who's opinions matter most and what they say WILL permeate my brain. It's nice working with people who don't have the ego's the size of continents and are trying to push you to be better at what you dol.  Anyhow, notes were taken, suggestions were addressed, and by the end of the night, we had Charles hard at work on re-recording Ash's basslines for MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE. Charles lent a whole new dynamic to the song, and wisely took the opportunity to play his parts in and out and around my various F-basslines (no longer Hook-basslines, ok?) to create some awesome dueling melodies and a sweeter chorus than the one we had written (and without making it sound like fucking Ned's Atomic Dustbin). Because of that, I edited a significant amount of my own bass out, which now makes those lines that much more dramatic when they enter the song. I'm psyched!  Well believe it or not, everyone had huge and I mean HUGE problems with the revamped 1956. At first, internally, I was a bit defensive about it, especially when Ash begged for it to be turned off (fucking drama queen), but once we got into a discussion about it and started to dissect the parts of the song, I began to understand the real problems of this song. The band really gave me the ability to stand back and look at this song, flaws and all. Along with Charles' new bass in MORNING, this was the most signficant thing that came out of the group meeting.  It was a fun night, and I got a ton of positive feedback from the aggression members on the artwork for the new remix album. I'm going to step away from it for a bit to gain some perspective and get back to it. Of course, during the evening, everyone stole each others IPODS and traded music. Ah, the modern age. So, much appreciation to Robin, Ash, and Charles for making some time for the Factor Corp. I would say 3/4 of what they suggested will be incorporated. the 1/4 is just artsy crap that they can do in their own band (j/k). Speaking of which, their material just improves by the second. I'm really feeling what they are doing...and you will too.  I think the group comments on 1956 effected Brandt as well as we spent a lot of Friday just talking about the song and what didn't work, etc. This led to Brandt and I meeting up early this morning to get to work on the next wave of this difficult song. Charles had called the song a musical "Franksentein" as it had lots of good parts, but nothing that tied them together. Also, everyone seemed to have issues with the fact that there were so many loops. The new intro that I busted my ass on last week went out the door and I went back to the quick bang immediate start of the track (like THE MOTIVE). Then, the next thing we did was strip the song to its bare essentials of guitar, bass, drums and strings. Taking Charles' advice, I grabbed my bass, and B busted out his 12-string and we went and wrote a new section of the song that would successfully bridge the verse and chorus. It took a LONG time, it was a lot of hard work, but once we did this, we knew we had this song in a million times better place than it was when we started. It totally made sense to us why this song, up until this point, hadn't worked right. Brandt really took this one and ran and did several melodic and rocky guitar tracks to flesh it all out. While he was working out his parts, I was able to go into the computer and do some cool sound design on the guitar line I played in the verses. I smoothed it out, made it a little bit otherworldly and it fits much better within the song. Brandt later went in and re-did some of his verse wah guitars while I tightened robin's drums up to make it much more dance, more Stone Roses-y, which you know I love.  Again, none of this was easy, but it was totally worth it. This new section works incredibly and we were able to change the big guitar solo towards then end to incorpoate this new section (believe it or not, the solo fit perfectly over it). With that, I went and created a new arrangement that has VERY few loops (maybe some one bar loop flourishes every now and then) and can easily be played by a rock band live.   I got some Wanton Garden to go straight outta Chinatown as well as some DVDS (including the new BETTER TOMORROW remastered box set, which everyone should own instead of renting PAYCHECK). I checked out the new Andy Lau movie JIANG HU (also starring Irene's favourite Cantopop idol Edison Chen), but the movie was a bit lacking. Great idea, poor execution. Nice DVD package though.   10 bucks to anyone who can figure out what the hell happened to the release of the new Die Warzau album! It's killing me!  F

      While I cannot write volumes about the KMFDM debate as I am on holiday in Praha and writing this on the clock in a 'net cafe, I will say this in response to FJ's query...  Sascha's comments about the making of  Money  are quite accurate, although some of what he said in the aforementioned interview was news even to me. At least two "drafts" of  Money  were presented to Wax Trax! before the final version, and at least one of them was "test pressed" (more on this in a minute). I knew very little about the first draft, but can only assume now that it was the  Split  LP mentioned by Sascha in the interview.  When I spent at least one day per week trolling the used bins of Chicago record stores in the mid-1990s, I came across two Wax Trax! "test pressings" within the span of one week that were quite unusual. For the uninitiated vinyl geeks, "test pressings" are produced by pressing plants to see if the master being used in the duplication process is flawed. Almost every record or CD is test-pressed at some point, often in limited quantities (as few as five to ten copies.) Sleeves and jackets are rarely included, with pressing plants substituting generic "white labels" in lieu of real artwork.  Wax Trax!, however, test-pressed many of its records in far greater quantities and used the extras in promotional mailings to DJs and radio stations. Wax Trax! test pressings are relatively easy to spot, as most have computer-generated labels with the artist/album information and were produced by an American company called Hub-Servall.  These pop up in record stores and on eBay every few months, most selling for little more than a few dollars.  The identical Wax Trax! test pressings I found were for a KMFDM album called  Apart . Upon listening I realized that both were preliminary drafts of the  Money  LP that had made it as far as the test pressing stage, but had been aborted for whatever reason. I wrote Sascha for more information and he said that, indeed,  Money  went through two separate drafts, although En Esch was still "in" the band at the time and he failed to elaborate on any of the backstory cited in the recent interview.  He did, however, ask for my one duplicate, as not even he had a copy, and I duly obliged with a mailing to Seattle.  For you KMFDM completists out there, you need not worry about missing any material.  Many of the songs ended up as remixes on singles from that era (ie "Split-Apart" from  Vogue ), and the rest saw the light of the day on the KMFDM rarities compilation Wax Trax!/TVT released in the late 1990s.

      In response to my previous post, the person I called out on the H-bar board regarding KMFDM's MONEY album has responded and with factual back-up to boot. He pointed me to a recent interview with Sascha KMFDM that gives the whole story: "In 1991 we started recording MONEY. MONEY was not supposed to be called MONEY. It was supposed to be called SPLIT because En Esch and I decided to break up during the tour with Thrill Kill Kult in 1990. So we decided that our next recording budget would split half and a half. I would get one half and he would get one half and we would both make 5 songs. Back on those days it was all still on vinyl. So he made 5 songs, I made 5 songs and we threw the coin and decided who gets the A and who gets the B side of the record. WAX TRAX rejected B side which was the En Esch's side. They said it didn't sound like KMFDM at all and that they didn't like it.They didn't want to put it out because it didn't meet the criteria of the label. So they gave us more money. That's why we called it MONEY. That record was all about the money. And I finished up the album without En Esch and certainly that was kinda really bad blood between us because he felt sort of rejected."  This is just a bit of what is probably one of the best interviews I have ever read with Sascha:   http://www.electromeda.net/audio/interviews/sascha_KMFDM.html  It's a good read, though I prefer Lucia interviews. I for one am surprised Wax Trax even rejected stuff back in those days. Discuss. You learn something new every day. And again, hearing stories like this confirms my belief that someone needs to write a book on all of this!  F

      A few things on my mind while I have your attention:  On a late night visit to a magazine store on 3rd Ave, I noticed that some "rock" magazine called REVOLVER had not only an article on Ministry, but also some kind of "definitive" history of industrial music in. When I saw a 12 year old photo of Grandpa Al (not related to Grandpa Frank, Ash) I decided not to read the article, and I turned my attention to the horrible, inaccurate and insulting "timeline" of industrial music. While I no longer have any love for the current state of this genre of music (mostly because no one good has come along in about 10 years), I do hold "my" era (late 80's to late 90's) of it dear to my heart. To write something so poor and again, inaccurate, infuriates me beyond belief. The moron "writer" who put this together goes so far as to talk about how Wax Trax founder Dannie Flescher passed away in 1995, when it was in fact Jim Nash. (God rest his soul). To me, this is a huge shitstain on the genre I started my musical career in. Fuck you, Revolver, you piece of shit magazine.  On the subject of I-rock, a member of the Chemlab newsboard stated this regarding KMFDM: "For the money album, En Esch chose to do five songs and have Sascha do the other five, and WaxTrax rejected all of Esch's submissions. " For some reason, I find this hard to believe so I have called this person out to state where this comes from. Some of you who read this are well versed in the history of this music (Meaning: HEY BRANDT), so I ask, have you heard this story before? Answers to come...  I feel its more than necessary for someone to go and write the history of shit shit down in a book and make it accurate. Mr. Gassman has been planning this for some time, often with my encouragement, and I hope being in a band doesn't distract him from writing said book. I constantly watch my employer get frustrated with the massive historical innacuracies in his chosen love, comic books, of which he knows basically everything (and I'm understating that), and I feel I'm going to fall into that same pit of frustration as time marches on. What happens when some 17 year old, curious about the genre, read REVOLVER's History of Industrial Rock and doesn't know better? Bullshit.  Anyhow on a better a note, the Durans first single with the original lineup in a million years has surfaced and it's gay and awesome and is called SUNRISE. I love it. I saw them play this when I saw them in California last year and my agent/lawyer/advistory said as a compliment "ohh, its nice and gay. They sound like The Pet Shop Boys". I liked the song, but felt it was semi weak when I first heard it. Obviously the Durans did too as they have made it a lot harder than I remember it and the results are awesome. It's still nice and gay, but unashamed in it's Duran-ness (listen to that funky bridge), yet entirely modern and NOW. The future bodes well for the full-length album, ASTRONAUT, due out in October.   I smell potential upcoming Album of the Year candidates in Duran Duran, Ian Brown, and Die Warzau. I was hoping for Oasis this year, but I don't think that's happening. Oh, and Saintface, of course! Speaking of which...  Last night, Irene and I spent some quality time "summiting" (as the MOGpac would call it) with Mr. Peter Saintface, who has been way too busy of late to read this blog. Hopefully by now he is caught up, but suffice to say, he is quite busy, still mixing and is THIS CLOSE to finishing the record. I remember being THIS CLOSE to finishing records and there were many weeks and months and in some cases, years, to go. Regardless, I will refrain from bitching about not owning the album at least until I fly back from Paris. Peter is looking well and relaxed, especially for a man THIS CLOSE to finishing an album. He was helpful in my search for this weeks NME (Ian Brown cover!) and encouraging of our adventures to come in the UK and Paris. We then discussed our respective and mutual musical worlds and he is excited to someday meet Charles. Our mutual musical worlds should be criscrossing again sometime in September I believe.  Despite playing a lot of whiffle ball and Star Wars today, I was able to start work on another piece of art for Ash. Maybe he will like this one as much as I like his new songs. We shall see.  Anyhow, there is a pay per view tomorrow that I need to rest up for. Cheers  F

      The days draw near before Irene and I head to the other part of the world, so the chaos is at double speed (even though I am taking the time to blog and she is on the couch watching a screener of TROY and I think slowly regretting it).  My morning was spent with our new friend Ben at at the Apple Store. Finally, someone there with some class and patience (though it was his last day there!) He handled a lot of my post-crash problems (reinstalling os9, etc) so I can get back into musical shape and he then addressed the physical problems facing this beaten-down Powerbook. I won't get into details, but its only 2 years old and looks like its been around for triple that. This stems from the fact that this computer has been all over the world with me and never stays in the same spot too long. You would think they would make these things a bit sturdier. Anyhow, lets just say Ben gave me the rock star treatment and this laptop will be as good as new by the time I return from Paris. Just so you know, his last two "celebrity" clients at apple were myself (!) and Claire Danes, who i think he now has a crush on.  The rest of the day was spent interacting with lots of cool people. Observe:  Ash and I had a fun exchange all day via E-mail. I finally showed him my first piece for Ass Cobra and he started out REALLY liking it, and then in his own "special" (as in special ed) Ash way, we had pretty much trashed the whole thing. HOWEVER, he gave me the music finally, which wil serve as the soundtrack to my European vacation. Hopefully, by the time I get back I'll have my head around the Cobra and get into it. Ash, Robin and Charles have an excellent new song called THREE WEEKS, which I am very fond of. I love that I be a fan of this band...  Leo V23 has found his way onto I-Chat, which is a big pleasant surprise for me. Instead of now waiting every month to see him and exchange new music, we now have the direct line. As he prepares for his first official gig as AM PACIFC, he sent me a new song called 11:11 which is one of the best things he has ever done. I'm sad I will be missing this gig for sure, but he knows my schedule and hopefully can book around it next time I'm in LA. As I type. we are trading various rarities, live tracks, etc from the likes of Cerati and Fresco, et al.  As if this isn't even a crazier day, Joe Saintface and I had a brief but nice exchange regarding the status of the new Saintface album. Regular readers of this blog will know that I am somewhat impatiently waiting for this album. It seems Joe is too. Supposedly, it was officially finished last night, though I will believe it when D'orge hears it, know what I mean? However, Peter, prepare to be stalked by your number 1 fan. I leave TUESDAY and need this in my I-Pod!  Speaking of Mr. Face, I might have failed to mention that a few E-exchanges with Peter have taken place this week regarding the second of the HF songs he is singing for EXIT STRATEGIES called CLEAN UP. He sent in his suggested edit for the song, most of which I didn't have a problem with other than the fact that he totally cut everything I loved about the song (Read: F-bass parts). Needless to say, he trimmed the song by two minutes, which it totally needed, but I think and shortened version of the long F-bass parts will come back as a bridge somewhere. The compromise should be very easy to figure out once he finishes the vocals.   Meanwhile, while Mr. Louche celebrates his anniversary and in preparation of our socializing in London next week, I have presented him a "gameplan", which outlines some of what could be our immediate musical future together. Yes that sounds gay, but hopefully down the line, and if all goes according to plan you Louche fans will be happy labheads a year or two from now. Watch this space  I keep hoping Irene falls asleep watching TROY so I can watch the OASIS gig I taped on Trio this afternoon while we were at dinner. Fingers crossed!  F  PS: SOMEONE TEACH ASH HOW TO USE THIS FUCKING THING! THANKS.

      Taking a break from music (and having a sick girlfriend at home) I caught up on my movies while also checking out several TV pilots that you all will be watching in the Fall. I'll clue you in on what I'm liking and what I'm not.  First off, though still ill, Irene (A real trooper!) mustered up the strength to see COLLATERAL with me on Saturday night. It's very very entertaining, but ultimately is a bit over the top. Cruise is good and occasionally scary, and while Jamie Foxx is starting to display the traits of a young Denzel, the role he played was better suited for someone of Denzel's age. They should have made Foxx look a bit older to get the character across better. Jada Smith, who I normally don't like (and can never figure out that middle name of hers), is entering a hott phase, which is never a bad thing. She was really good in this, though she didn't do much. Michael Mann, a brilliant director, has a knack for making LA look like the coolest place on the planet, when it is, in fact a wackass town. It's incredible how he films the worst parts of Los Angeles and makes it look "cool". CONSTANTINE is like this as well (and a much better movie). Anyhow, COLLATERAL was satisfying,  yet cartoony, but was ultimately good fun.  The rest of my movie viewing was all straight out of Hong Kong:  First off was Johnny To's new film BREAKING NEWS, which is a great semi-satire/political statement on the media and how it effects modern police tactics. As it progresses with its "Die Hard in an Apartment Building" storyline, the police and criminals use the media and the internet against one another and it's very clever in it's execution. Simply put, I loved this film. It was smart and energetic and with the exception of the annoying as fuck Kelly Chen, the film was cast perfectly. I was happy to see Simon Yam (the Deniro to Johnny To's Scorcese) in a cameo and I think casting non-to regulars in the main roles was a smart choice. With movies like this, the superior PTU, and the stunning RUNNING ON KARMA, Johnny To has become HK's most diverse, daring and interesting director. He's the best thing to happen to HK cinema in a long time!  Next was the lighter ENTER THE PHEONIX, which features many of HK's younger stars (including Irene'sfave supporting actor Chapman To) and is directed by first time director and popular young star Stephen Fung (who looks like he could be a young and better looking Jackie Chan). it's a triad based identity switch comedy with gay overtones. Sounds like a lot, yeah? Well, its really ambitious, perhaps a bit too ambitious. Daniel Wu, who I watched a lot of this weekend, is a good looking young guy who can actually act and he plays the role of the gay son of a dead triad leader with a lot of emotion and wit. He reminded me of a young Yuen Biao (one of my all time faves, of course) and sure enough Yuen Biao plays his dad in it! To say I marked out for this would be an understatment. The long lost Third Brother (along with Jackie and Sammo Hung) really brings some much needed emotional weight to the proceedings and grounds the film in his all to brief moments on screen. if anyone in HK cinema deserves a comeback, its Yuen Biao, who was so awesome in his movies with Jackie and Sammo and in classics like PRODIGAL SON, ON THE RUN, and his best film bar none: RIGHTING WRONGS. Anyway, the rest of the movie was light and fun and it breezed by with some fun cameos, best of which was Jackie himself in the very last frame. In 2004, seeing Jackie and Yuen in the same movie is enough to make me smile.  Last but not least was the critically acclaimed ONE NIGHT IN MONGKOK, which again stars Daniel Wu, this time as a country bumpkin hitman who has come to HK to assassinate a triad leader while also searching for his lost love. The amazing, beautiful and underrated (and supposedly underfed) Cecillia Cheung plays the hooker he befriends along the way. This is more of an ensemble piece in which different stories intertwine throughout the most densely pouplated city in the world, Monkok. No one is clean in the movie, especially the cops, who do anything to cover their own flaws. The movie is dark, nasty and violent and is the first movie of that kind to really stir me in awhile. I think Cecillia gets a bum rap as an actress as she is GREAT in this (and also in RUNNING ON KARMA) and Daniel Wu could be, with some experience, the next Andy Lau. I can't recommend this movie any more highly. Probably the edgiest thing I've seen in awhile. GREAT stuff.  For more about these movies, check out http://www.lovehkfilm.com, which in my expert opinion is the best HK review site on the net.  I then turned my attention from HK Cinema to American Television and checked out 3 new shows that some of you will be watching in the coming season:  THE MOUNTIAN is typical WB fare except this time at a ski resort. Not a terrible plot, but the acting is so so, and Oliver Hudson, who I usually like, is kinda flat here. Basically its about a family fighting to keep the resort alive after the death of the family patriarch. Skinner from X-Files is the bad guy and Barbara Hershey, who has gone through a terrible face lift, plays the mother to the family of good guys. The show is filled with women who would make great ingrediants for a dope bowl of ass soup, and thats the best thing going for this. Not terrible, it's set up very well actually, but not something I'm going to be DVRing in September.  One show that is without a doubt on my must DVR list this season is LIFE AS WE KNOW IT (formerly knowin as DOIN' IT), which is an excellent modern coming of age series focused on three horny teenage boys who can only think about, well, doin' it. While the show seems like a straight up sex comedy while going into Ferris Bueller territory with the 3 leads breaking the fourth wall to talk to the audience, halfway into it the show takes a dramatic turn and suddenly pours on tons of depth for all of the characters. It's EXTREMELY well done. The cast of total unknowns helps as well as they are not all WB pretty kid types and it helps make it seem more real. Kelly Osbourne (!) is part of the ensemble is shockingly good as the "fat chick" who one of the boys really likes but is afraid to date for fear of being made fun of for dating the fat chick. This is a show full of surprises and funny moments, but has a lot of depth and out our of nowhere (but not out of place) character development which makes this my top choice for the 04 season (along with Drea D'matteo in JOEY, cause she is just the best). I learned after that certain writers from FREAKS AND GEEKS are involved with this show which explains a lot, and explains why ABC will probably cancel it quick because its smart, edgy and intelligent: things we normally don't associate with network television these days.  The third show is the highly touted JACK AND BOBBY, which is a smart and original show about two brothers (one in High School, the other just starting) in the year 2004, one of whom will become president of the United States 40 years from now. The show contains interstitals from the year 2049 in which they discuss the life of said president and how events in his younger life helped form the man he becomes. VERY clever. The two boys, though WB pretty, CAN act, which is good, but Christine Lahti as their overbearing and pothead mom needs to bring it down a few notches. She's a pain in the ass. Anyway, the set up is great, but my only complaint is that they reveal which brother will become president by the time the episode was over, which I think was a huge mistake. They could have milked this one for ages, and now it just becomes not "which one becomes president", but "what makes him president". I think they may have jumped the shark with this one, but knowing the writers involved with this show, I have a feeling that my minor issues will disappear as the show progresses. This is one to watch!  In other TV news, Dan Hamill's favourite actor and former bandmate of Vincent Gallo, LUKAS HAAS, has joined the cast of 24 this season. I have a feeling that with the show being revamped, this could be a much stronger season than last.  Anyhow, I've rambled WAY too much and now you have Matt back to keep you occupied with his tales of gayness while I prepare for vacation.  F

      Hello my friends. While taking holiday in eastern Europe I have gone for a record ten days without doing the following: checking my voicemail, checking my email, checking the DrudgeReport and checking the MOGworld blog. It is with great anticipation that I review all of these the moment I land in the USofA.  So, how am I able to type this now? Well, I am actually typing in into MS Word now – fortunately I have borrowed my legal gf’s laptop for the flight home – I have blogging as well as an Advertising take home final to attend to. I ended up borrowing this laptop because she is actually on a different flight than I – she is flying KLM back to JFK. Long story short, I was supposed to fly out on AirFrance tonight at 6.55p local time but since her flight was this AM at 10p, I got on the first flight for the NYC.  Having to pay a slight fee to allow for this, I learned at check that I was bumped up to business class – how brilliant – it reminds me of flights from London and Paris in trips gone by. When finally boarding, I was further delighted to learn that I had been upgraded again to First Class from Business. J Let me tell you – First Class is hard living. I’m about to down my third glass of champagne and consume a cheese plate prepared especially for me since the vegetarian meal was not available.  I think that after I blog and eat and work on my final, I might watch some Curb Your Enthusiasm as I know for a fact that I have that DVD in said laptop at the moment – what I am not sure, however, is whether I have my cd envelopes with about 15 other DVDs for my viewing pleasure. My only complaint is that the power outlet in my chair seems to cutout every 5minutes…so tough this First Class livin’.  Maybe later I will continue this blog to talk about my holiday…it includes but is not limited to the following: drug smuggling, French cars, industrial gods, gothic fags, German National Socialists, Hammerskins, miles of pavement, litres of petrol, millions of bugs and a black cat.  Ciao!  Someone near me is watching that Broken Glass movie with Hayden Christensen – HC is the Ryan Phillippe of the early 2000’s but without the hot wife. I don’t know what Lucas sees in this momo.  And the flight has been a bit on the turbulent side. And I’ve switched from champagne to Sprite – much more refreshing. I’ve already had the chance to load my pictures into this computer – some keepers, some real losers. I’ll share those at a later date. Now I have to try to finish my final so that I don’t have to worry about it once again on terraferma.  Well this flight continues to be turbulent – making me honestly nervous – and I never get nervous on flights. Let me use this opportunity to report on the musical aspect of my trip – M’ERA LUNA.  What started as a one day festival, M’ERA LUNA has ended up being one of the surviving German events bringing in over 25,000 visitors to a beautiful little town that is pretty much over run with jerks in full clad black outfits in middle of the summer. This is something I will never understand. I don’t care who you think you are or how embedded in the “scene” you think you are – there is no reason to dress head to toe in black, whether it’s cotton or polyester or PVC or leather – it’s just stupid. And the other thing I don’t understand is why these people who love their snow white tans don’t enlist the services of sunblock. I witnessed some of the most horrific tan lines on Saturday that I was in shock. These kids don’t make any sense to me. When the Douche and I were exposed to the “tanned-goth” of the Doomsday 2000 festival – that, too, didn’t make sense to me until this weekend: M’ERA LUNA 2000 was a week before the Doomsday fest we went to, so by the time we saw them, their terrible burns had turned tan. Just sayin’.  So the music. The Jax and I drove from Munich to Hildesheim with much ease and settled into our hostel only long enough to freshen up and hit the festival. Complaint number 1 – when you are charging 45 euros at the door for a single day ticket – ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS YOU FUCK! Or at least accept cards inside at the official t-shirt stands or have an ATM inside or something!!! After that setback and the realization that our purchasing power had greatly diminished even before entering the venue (an old airport), we wandered over to the main stage for the what was the second song of goth-rocker legend Wayne Hussey and The Mission. The band does not fit the man. I’m probably all wet on this but the guitarist looks a lot like Danny Lohner of NIN fame. The open-air affect was not nice to these guys. They put on a good performance considering the heat and the daylight and the stupid crowd. Following The Mission was L’Ame Immortelle – a band enjoyed by the Jax and a band I was interested in checking out because of the hype surrounding them and boy was I not disappointed – they sucked even worse than I had anticipated, though the crowd seemed to enjoy them greatly – see where I’m going here? This 6 piece included a drummer, guitarist, bassist, keyboardist, female vocalist and male vocalist who doubled as cheerleader and occasionally hit a key or two. These cats were weak. Even the Jax was like asking if I felt like making a 4+ mile roundtrip walk to the nearest ATM rather than watch these guys. Pathetic.  We next ventured over to “the hangar” in great anticipation of Fixmer/McCarthy. We headed over a little early and ended up catching the end of In Strict Confidence’s set. I’m not positive, but I think there was another industrial band from LI called ISC, but this is not the same band. This four piece, including a female vocalist for one song, owned the hangar. Their music was a bit simplistic, but was catchy. The lead singer reminded me of Ash if he were a bit more assertive and could sing in a deep German voice. After leaving the stage at promptly the moment they were supposed to (these Germans are proficient at some things) about 70% of the packed hangar left. We made our way to pretty close to the stage and I was beaming with anticipation. Then all of the Nitzer Ebb shirts started filing in. Everyone was ready for something special. Terrance Fixmer, some techno guy, came out and did his own soundcheck only to retreat back behind a curtain for another five minutes before showtime. Truth be told I was not a big fan of this album – but that wasn’t stopping me from strapping on my messenger bag as close to me as possible in case I had to remind the Germans why we won WWII. So Fixmer comes back out and gets some sort of beat going…DUH DUH DUH DUH and the germans are going nuts b/c that’s something they can dance to. Then Douglas McCarthy comes out – aviator Ray Ban shades, close buzz haircut, dark blue Levis (hanging a bit low though), black shoes and a dark blue button down with the sleeves rolled up – and shouts “REMEMBER ME?!?!?!” This man knows that everyone is there not because of his new project but because of who HE is/was – and he didn’t make us wait a single second and Fixmer’s beat/ambient tune turned into the main bassline and drum tracks from “Join in the Chant”. I instantly handed the Jax my camera (What do you call a girl at a hard core show? Coat rack.), then first I said “I’m going to cry” and quickly followed it with “I’m going to go elbow some Germans in the face”. Less than 5seconds later I found myself 3feet from the barricade in the dead center of the stage. All I can say is that McCarthy has been doing this for about 20years and his voice is still like is on the So Bright, So Strong e.p. Other NE songs included Murderous, Control, I’m Here and Let Your Body Learn (as the encore). My only slight complaint is that the old NE songs(except for JItC) were a bit more big 4/4 beat as opposed to the originals and also he tended to leave out verses settling for the big payoff of the bridges and choruses – I guess best delivered over the big beat. I was disappointed in that but I do understand why it was done the way it was, but like DM bringing back Black Celebration for the last (?) tour – it’s just plain not as good.  Aside from having a wound on my elbow reopened by some faeg’s spike (causing blood to pour from my arm), I was thoroughly entertained and look forward to seeing them in the States – maybe Cesar can book it.  Looking at the interactive flight map I can see we are over Québec now – only an hour + outside of Newark – it’s a wonderful feeling entering your own timezone again. Returning to work tomorrow is going to be a giant nightmare but I guess it’s what one has to do in order to take these adventures.  Enough philosophizing – back to my homework for the remaining hour. Tchüess!!! (Brandt can correct my spelling)

      Sadly, with a girlfriend with flu-like symptoms, my planned screening of COLLATERAL didn't happen. I tried to pawn off the tickets to various friends, but no takers. Hopefully tonight my significant other will be in better shape to see this film. I read the script and while it was good (not great), I feel the director and actors will elevate it to where it needs to be.  Meanwhile, I am hard at work doing lots of things NOT related to my music. This is only helped by the fact that one Brandt is somewhere like in Poland pretending he is "cosmopolitan" when he is in fact, nothing more than Summer Man. Someone is gonna figure that out at some point and there will be some big ass trouble. Probably involving a big ass chick, knowing B. However, I have my own European trip to worry about, which will be Irene's first time in that direction of the world. While many people plan tours of historic sites and such, we are taking a more rock n roll approach to the trip and are just seeing gigs (at least in London) and being lazy as hell. So if you're British and you are at either the Twilight Singers, Primal Scream or David Cross (!) gigs in London this month, come say hello to the New Yorkers. Also on the cultural agenda for this trip: shopping, eating, and sleeping (probably in that order). And yes, I do intend to see a few old pals in London, mostly while Irene shops (Gilez, save me!).  Anyhow, I've become preliminary art idea for the band In Loving Memory, which has been referred to here jokingly as Ass Cobra and will be referred to as such from this point on. Yes, this is Ash and company and I'm fascinated by the challenge of coming up with a "look" for this project. However, i have no fucking music for this project, which doesn't help me (ASH!). I heard some more of it last week and damn do I like it a lot. Charles has been the difference maker big time and has brought out the best in Robin and Ash. I have one concept piece done already, but I really want to spend time with this and do it right.  Our house continues (happily) to be MOG Central Station this week. Most of the week saw Agent/Lawyer/Advisor using MOGworld has her NYhomebase, though Irene has seen her more than I have. Also here was the 5 months preggers Mrs. Cramp, who is a riot and was introduced to Sizzling Rice Soup for the first time ever this week. Another convert! We dined with our new friend, Ben, who Irene and Mrs. Cramp befriended while trying to get Mrs. Cramp's laptop fixed at the Apple store. Ben is a cool dude and is studying to be a priest of some sort, and works at the apple store during his time away from Seminary School. Anyway, he too enjoyed the finer dining in Chinatown and as soon as I'm done with this entry, I will be heading down to see him to get this laptop into fighting shape. Aces.  FYI, I have tried to re-listen to new albums I have recently had problems with or didn't love just to make sure they weren't lost in the shuffle in the recent onslaught of "too much new music at the same time". Sadly, very few of the opinions stated in previous entries have changed. I still hate the new Prodigy album (Q Magazine agrees), i still hate the production on the Cure album (so does Simon Gallup supposedly), and I still just like the Interpol album. I have new respect for Muse since seeing them live and am now enjoying the albums much more. I'm still digging the Damage Manual album immensely and the new Clay People stuff (only have a few demos) rocks my pants silly.  I have tried to control my urge to run to a certain nearby bookstore to haunt the singer of my favourite band for mixes of what I think is his now completed album. It's so hard to be so restrainted. I know you read this, PLEASE PLEASE send me the album!  OK. Out for now.  F  P.S. The headline quote is from my 6 year old cousin, Eric, who is my clone who, upon hearing the title of STAR WARS EPISODE III, proceeded to quote every instance the word SITH (or has he pronounces it: Seeeth) was used in the previous 5 movies. I can't think of much that would be make me prouder of this boy. To hear him quote a random Darth Maul line is astounding and brings great joy. Attack of the clones indeed!

      I forgot to add in my blog yesterday that despite the Cure appearing sluggish, the musicianship was solid as always, and Bob's voice was in AMAZING shape. He's an incredible singer...  Speaking of incredible singers, my pally Dan Neet (via my other pallyl TODD RYAN) sent some new Clay People tracks my way. Well I'm happy to report that so far, its another comeback worth salivating over. Dan is in TOP shape and the music is melodic, diverse and very very interesting. I like where this is going and I'm psyched to hear more. I believe he is working with some of the former members of Stabbing Westward, though the guitars are classic Clay. I think by now, many of you have heard the remix of the new song FAILURE, of which I have a fondness towards.  The Damage Manual remix album is also so far very very good. Maybe I'm a sucker for anything Connelly, but this CD is filled with very cool and different remixes. It doesnt really get boring and thats VERY tough on a remix album. This should be in the ipod for awhile (more than their previous releases).  Also, I acquired the VERY rare (so rare I literally got the last copies from a very random online store) of Leandro Fresco's CD's INVERNAL and VACACIONES. Both were released on the now defunct Fragil Discos label out of Argentina which also released Cerati's OCIO project some time ago. AMAZING ambient music. Impossible to get, but worth the month it took me to find it. Soundtracky and atmospheric and just kick ass. love it. I want to do something like this in the future.  It's a good time to love music...finally.  F

      Still without any time to really take a day to rest, Irene and I, joined by G, Lurch and Ash (who graciously provided transport) went out to the landfill known as Randall's Island to check out The Cure's CURIOSA festival. The festival on paper is a good line up, filled with interesting bands, most of whom, with the exception of The Cure, I had yet to see. Therefore, this tour provided the opportunity for me to see bands I had been, ahem curious, about seeing perform live.  We hit some traffic so we didn't get to see all of Mogwai, so I have no review to present to you. Thus, the gig starts with Dan Hamill's dreamboat, Melissa Auf Der Maur, who is a redheaded hippie with sweet thighs. She's a bit spacey (not kevin) for my tastes, so once she started singing about horses, I felt it was time to get a smootie. Dan Hamill seemed pleased with the gig, so thats enough for me.   On the main stage, The Rapture took to the stage and they are super talented and super young. These kids look young enough to be The Kidd's kids, and that is saying something. However, they were fun, energetic and played a good set. The dude with the cowbell who dances like an idiot was at first very funny, then annoying, and in retrospect was back to being funny. There is something about The Rapture that never quite clicks with me musically, but they are crazy talented and have potential to really grow as a band. However, until then I felt like this tour had to be over in time for them to register for Freshman Orientation. They get a thumbs up from me.  Then we checked out something called Thursday. Total shit. I recall very little other than Irene deciding to stay at the second stage in order to get a good spot for Muse. She was rather focused and determined and downright scary. But I get like that too...  So then New York's supposed finest, INTERPOL, took to the stage. I'm a fan. I'm not a fanatic, but a fan, so I was really intruiged to see them more than any band on this tour. Sadly, this gig didn't deliver at all. They are lazy, they lack charisma and their performance flat out sucked. The best thing in the band is Carlos D, an amazing hipster douche, and that takes a lot for me to say. He had technical problems with his rig, which might have killed their momentum, but he literally is the only one besides the drummer who looks like they belong on a stage this size. The rythmn section carries this band far beyond anything it should be. The guitar player is a hack who's lack of style or distinction in his guitar playing and sound cripples this band immsenly. The singer's Ian Curtis gimmick goes way too far live and he sings without any conviction or passion. There is a BIG fucking difference between being cool in a nonchalant way and being nonchalant because you dont have the courage or skills to back it up.  However, let me say that they do have some great songs on record, especially the new song NARC. After seeing Saintface give their fucking lives in a clubs the night before, Interpol come off as hipster douche hasbeens at 30. The singer from Interpol should go to Mercury Lounge on August 28th for some serious lessons on how to be a frontman.  And yes that was Michael Saintface walking away after a few songs telling us "I've seen enough"...  Luckily this horrible experience and the whole day was saved by current UK sensations MUSE who made everyone on this tour look like fucking amatuers. While I have always liked them on CD, my concern was that they were products of the NME hype machine. Well, I am happy to report that they are more than deserving of the hype they have gotten in the UK. They are shockingly good musicians and the energy they had on stage was staggering. It was the best 45 minutes of the day and one of the best performances I have seen in ages. Matt Bellamy, the frontman, plays guitar in ways that are alien and while this is a rock band, the use of occasional loops makes me a sucker for them. Worth the hype. And thanks to Muse for making my girlfriend a very happy fan. Great stuff.  And well...The Cure. They came on, and they played, and it was the first time I felt that they seemed, well, old. They seemed sluggish, especially when the limped through HIGH, and the new songs didn't translate nearly as well as I had hoped. Poor Simon Gallup kept trying to get the energy going and it just wasn't happening. I felt the set list lacked the diversity of other tours and I feel like I have heard this all played before. Of course the older stuff came across well and this was the first time I was REALLY into the very old stuff (Forest, 10:15), but the gig just lacked the spark, the energy, that they have had EVERY time I have seen them since 1989. The encore was great, however, and that helped a lot. I'm a sucker for a good outdoor gig, but when youre sitting on the grass swapping spit with your girl, you know the band just isn't delivering as they should.  The evening ended with the crew grabbing a late dinner at the Gramercy. No sign of Ryan Adams (who is playing here soon, but is so not worth 40 bucks to see). All in all it was a good day, saved by the brits in Muse, so cheers.  F
