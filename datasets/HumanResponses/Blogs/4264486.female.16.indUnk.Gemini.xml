       Oh wow, let me just say that this has been the all time best summer. I never would have expected it to be this good. I have so many friends that i have gotten so close to, and some that i have drifted apart from, and yeah i regret it sometimes. But what's the point in living in regret? I haven't had any boyfriends this summer, but who says you need them to have fun?! haha, yeah i have had my crushes that didn't work out, or my crushes that i still have a crush on... hm... hehe.    When I look back to the very last day of school, I see RyRy throwing all of his papers in the air like confettii, and us all walking out the door's to go to wendy's then off to frisbee and b-b-q at Vasich's...I wouldn't have thought that day that those people who were at frisbee would become such good friends of mine, and certainly not a crush of mine now. If I could change any one thing about my summer... it would be more babysitting, and a ton of more time with my friends.. yeah we spend like everyday together, but we have so much fun doing the stupidest things.. such as LIVE, DO, CLIFF... haha great game.    I was thinking the other night, that for us juniors, we only have 2 years left, that's only one more summer before we go off to college, only one more summer of having to go back to highschool. It's kinda scary, I'll be the first to admit, that i'm not ready, mature, or ready... enough to be this old. I want to be 6 years old again, everything was so carefree and so much fun... yeah bedtime was like what 8 30? or something like that... haha i dunnoo...    And for all of my friends who are going to be seniors... my gosh, i would be scared out of my mind. I am so excited for them and i know that they are all excited. So I have officially decided that this school year is going to kick ass!!! minus the act's and all that other crapp...... BUT WE HAVE PROM THIS YEAR!!! well.... if us girls get asked... and if the boys ask someone... but still... we have the oppurtunity to go!! HAHA woo-hoo!!! okay that's all for now!    urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/BrowsePhotos.jsp?&amp;collid=83206631306&page=1&amp;sort_order=0  urlLink

      Okay, so we went to dinner tonight, and we ended up going to Olive Garden, and it was so much fun. It was me, colin, britt, mattie, danny, em, chris, sam, angie and shawn and we had a lot of fun. So after dinner we came back to my house so everyone could get their cars and some people were gonna go over to Sam's house and colin britt and i were going over to jay's.... Apparently, well according to everyone who went to sams, that isn't allowed with that group of people. I wasn't aware that i had to pull each and every person to the side and tell them that i was going to jays'. I announced it, it's not my fault none of them were listening. So then britt and i are leaving, and you know how immature they got? They seranwrapped our cars!!! seriously, who does that? and i love how they think that it totally go to us, but it didn't at all, so this will be interesting.    Later that night while i was talking to shawn online we got into a huge fight, and this never fails, he is the only person that i fight with who makes me cry everytime. And he was all like, well we feel like you dont wanna hang out with us anymore, when ever we call you you always give an excuse. and i  was like when was the last time you called me that i gave an excuse. And he was like... oh well i havent been home the past three weeks because of work, and i was like okay so don't pin that shit on me, you never call me anymore and yadeeyadee ya... so we just fought forever until i was crying and mad and got off the computer.   But on a better note, everyone looked amazing last night... especially colin... aka chest man... haha, good times

      wOO-HOO!! I'm so excited for dinner tonight!!! a bunch of my friends and i are going to Maggianos (how do you spell it?) for a fancy dinner tonight, and i'm totally psyched. We did a nice dinner last year before school started, so now we add people, and kinda make it a tradition. Cause half of the people that are going this year didn't go last year, so it's going to be soo much fun!!! I love dressing up, and with all of your friends, it's like a minnie homecoming or something of that sort... haha yeah anywayz.. i'm excited.    There's frisbee today at 1:00 but i havent decided if i'm gonna go... i dunno, it'll be fun, but i don't know what girls are going..  no girls ever go..haha all right, well i'm gonna go shower

      Okay, so yeah, it's been a while since i've posted last... my sister has had our cable modem for her computer so i havent been able to get on lately. We had our FMP training, and frosh fling the other night. Man what a great time!! haha, we had a lot of fun, chasing down little freshmen dipshits who think they can run away from us.. uh-uh... tackeling them in the middle of the football field. And getting all of them to dance was so much fun, dancing with all of them... some of them were pretty cute!! woo-hoo! haha, anyways yeah we had a really good time.      So I've pretty much decided that i don't like this guy that everyone wants me to like. And i feel so bad because people would say i led him on, but all my really good friends know what a flirt i am, and that i usually don't mean for it to be harmful, but i guess sometimes it is... so i'm really sorry for any trouble I've caused..           Oh, and I babysat at the Mortin Arburetum again tonight, and i have decided... again... that that is where i am going to get married. In the back yard of that house... omg it is absoloutely fantasically gorgeous and i am in heaven everytime i walk into that backyard.. So yeah, there's my thoughts for tonight. Oh, and i'm soo excited for dinner tomorrow night!!! woo-hoo!

      Okay, so i was just over at my neighbors house, and i was talking to the mom over there, and i found out that my neighbors are all turning into little sluts!! no joke!!! they sneak out at night to make out with guys... one of the caught, the other parents are clueless... they drink all the time, one of them is hanging out with year older guys... Fine, i do it too. But none of my friends drink and smoke pot or whatnot.. Oh well, I guess it's there lives for them to ruin. I never realized how completely gullible parents can be, seriously, who doesn't know if their daughter/son drinks and smokes pot, and sneaks out in the middle of the night!? What is the world coming too? All these litttle kids.. i'm still a little kid.... doing all of this stuff.. What's the point? It's not bringing you anything good in your life... oh well nothing i can do about it.

       Okay, so I just finished watching the season finale of Summerland, and I am balling my eyes out. The three kids have lost their parents in the beginning of the series, and they live with their aunt Ava. Cool, whatever, so in tonight's episode it show's them finding things of their parents in a box, and all of them crying. So it got me to thinking... what would it be like to loose both of your parents?        I know, everyone dislikes their parents every once in a while, but what if that happened, i dont know how i would recover. Espcecially because now i'm living with my aunt..  in the middle of no where, they havent changed their will to let me live with Kelly, (my sister). I am such a daddy's little girl, i have always gotten along with my dad so much better then my mom. Like when my last serious boyfriend and i broke up, and i cried for like hm... 3 hours..i  didnt' cry on my mom like most girls, i cried on my dad... wonderfull....   I just dont' know what i would do without my parents, i love them so much, and of course i'm sitting here crying again because i'm talking about it... yeah so now i'm going to go watch a Disney movie!!! WOOOEEE

      Gooo... right now I am so confused, I don't know what's going on, or what I should be thinking or anything.  I feel like I should like this guy because everybody wants me to, I just don't know how I exactly feel about him. I guess I still kind of like this other guy, but maybe I dont... Maybe I should just curl up in a ball until school starts, so i don't hurt anybody, or myself... if that makes sense. Oh well... season finale of Summerland is on soon so i gotta run!
