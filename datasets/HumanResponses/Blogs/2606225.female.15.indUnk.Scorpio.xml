      hey people howz it goin? im fantabulous. just sittin here thinkin about how important my friends really are to me. i spent this weekend with a friend of mine who is moving out of state in well... one month today. this friend of mine is so special and amazing. she makes you laugh at all the right times and she will always be there to protect you or when she needs a little protecting of her own! lol!  she is so sweet and i love her so much she is just such a great part of my life and i really dont want her to leave. i understand the fact that she has to go but it doesnt help the me any because im going to miss her so much and its so unfair that "life" is takin away such a great friend from me. i always hate when people say life is unfair so let me correct myself... i think her parents are unfair. but even so i love them too. i really dont have anything else to say but you go whitney! ill really try to help you with your motto/resolution as long as you help me get a few "needed" things. call me and ill tell you! lol! well guys and gals out there b'bye!

      its early in the day and i am already ready to go to bed. this day has been nuthin but extreme chaos and im ready for it to end. i was up late again last night but i was so tired. then i got up early to bid farewell to my friends and then i only wish i could have fallen back into my dreamworld where things are so perfect but not again until the sun retrets in the sky and i slip into near unconscienecness.

      nothing happened today... it was normal. normal, thats a word i dont often use because i dont like it. its so stereotypical but thats exactly wat today was. my life is finally getting back to the way it was before break... i have a good time, i get my work done, and i still ? myself about why i hang out with the people i do! i had a really good day. kim (vu) made me laugh and made me smile, billy had me going, whitney was whitney just the same, cayce and i didnt really talk, go finger, jordan is great, and life is life. im really happy and thats good because after all the crap i went through during break i need to be! the only thing that surprised me was kim (g). she imed me today. like i dont hate the girl i just dont like her. ive never really even talked to her. i just knows that she dont like me becauce of cayce and thats enough for me not to like her right? why should i be nice to someone who doesnt like me because of a guy im not even with hell ive never been with him. were just friends and im sorry if we hang out and talk i cant help the fact that im social! its just me but im not goin into that today. b'bye

      there isnt much to say today... life happened i guess. one thing i would like to be able to do would be reading peoples minds. lately it seems as if there is a lot that people keep from me... like things i know OF but dont know ABOUT. its really driving me crazy. now i cant say much because i know that whitney and i do the same thing to everybody else but we only hide our little inside jokes and i must admit there are quite a few of them but most of the time when people ask we try our hardest to explain... its just some things need to stay on the downlow if you know wat i mean. well wat im talking about is bigger that the constant giggle of two freshmen high school students... wat im talking about is something big that i dont understand and i honestly doubt i will know unless the person keeping the secret tells me and knowing him i dont think ill ever find out... thats okay i guess... outta sight outta mind huh? wat else wat else... i heard from a friend that i had a little surprise on my locker today its just unfortunate that i didnt get to it before it was stolen from the door of my locker. it was a sticky note that read -- sara call me ???)???-???? -- well obviously there were numbers where the ? marks are but hey i just wish i knew who put them there wat order they went in and if i could get them back! lol! i have a feeling that i know who left them there but i dont think that im gonna ask this kid ya know!?!? whitney got to see my "crush" today and i was happy and like me she agrees that he is way more my type than the other guys ive been interested in this year! and she approves so thats good! yea for once i have homework so i besta be gettin to that!

      today has been an absolutely fantabulous day! but then again its only 4:20 lol i had so much fun even though i totally dreaded going back to school. i learned a lot about the people that i liked and then about the people i like! something that made me smile today was a comment made by a friend of this kid i really like. i didnt know for sure if he liked me too but i know now. i was getting in to my locker and i heard my name being called... i looked down the hall and there he was! my "crush"! so i turn and say hello then go back to digging in my locker... then i hear the friend of my "crush" say... "hey hey i wanna go check her out!" as these two guys approach me i have to stop and think about their reasoning for coming over to me. you can only imagine wat was going through my head! so they get to me and the friend goes... "damn ______, she is hott! you would look so fine with her!" and all i could do was smile! now i cant wait to go to school and see my new hottie! the world just better not end today... then again if it did you all know i would die happy!!!

      i think that the world is going to end. all hope for the human race is over. i was talking to a friend to day and she made a good point... since u and cayce arent watever u want to call it.....is it possible that u 2 would begin to like eachother??? she was takling about this person who doesnt like me because i like cayce and like she said since cayce and i arent whatever is it possible that we could become friends? my response... hell... no! thats how i kno this world is done for. i am not really hostile toward anyone. but i just dont like people who dont like me because of stupid reasons. wat can i say? put yourself in my position... and im not even mad at cayce! i mean why should i be? oh i have my reasons and ask my friends ive made them evident but cayce is a great guy and im just lucky to have the kid as a friend but as for the people who doesnt like me because of cayce... they can just... ahahahaha!!!

      ive had the whole day to think about the people and the relationships in my life. there are some people that i interact with only because i have to and then there are those that i talk to all the time and no matter how much we talk i still have something that i need to say to them. but on the other hand there are people in my life that i want to talk to all the time but when i get the oppertunity the words never seem to come out right... in some cases they did at first but as friendships grow and relationships blossom and whither, the amount of time spent on these people changes and you lose touch with the real reason you talked to these people in the first place. i have people who i just want to be around all of the time but the felling isnt mutual so wats the point??? do you know? if you do please tell me because i really need to know...

      today is a new day, things happen and life goes on. will today be my day to shine? possibly... but only the great God above can tell... well for my sake i hope so. i found this website through a couple of friends and decided to give it a try because there are things that people need to know that cant be directed to anyone in particular so hopefully when you read this you understand my point of view and the way i live my life...

      stephy left today. but i did get to see her and say goodbye one last time. i was so thankful for that its not even funny. went to the mall with my cousin, saw some friends from northglenn but i didnt talk to them. they were there with their new friends having their own lives and we never really talked in ms anyway so i was like naw how bout not. so i didnt. i really feel like talkin to whitney about everything that has happened in like the past week or so. ive kind of distanced myself from her so that she could spend as much time with stephy before she left as possible, and im not sayin now that steph is gone ill be like hey new bestfriend im here to fill in stephanies spot!!! nothing like that at all its just i would normally have told whitney pretty much everything that happened with everybody that i talked to but i wanted to give her the chance to really  focus on steph and now i have a lot bottled up that id like to tell her. i went bowling last night it was a lot of fun. i was the only girl. it was GREAT!!! hehehe no i did have fun though. the guys made me laugh way to much specially with those carebears!!! never again will i let 4 guys be alone with two carebears! especially cayce and mark (NOT cayce and sara) ones! yall had too much fun! oh yea, and a by-the-way i won the first game we played! too much fun way too much fun! well ima be bouncin outta here. catch ya on the flip syde.

      today has been one of the hardest days of highschool for me. today was the last time i would see stephy in a ths hall, today was one of the last times i would be able to pass her notes when i ran across her on my way to class, today was the last time i could do the little giggly thing when she would talk about "her hotties"... today was stephanies last day at thornton. i havent talked about this much because i have really tried not to believe it. i still forced myself to think that she was "just sick" and that shed be back tomorrow... but she wont... and i dont know wat to say or think about that. i love stephy so much because even though i havent known her for all that long she has really made my life better. you see stephanie was always the girl who would stand up for you if you were in a fight, she was always the one to calm you down after you stood up for her (which i have to say didnt happen often because she has always been one to take care of business). she is just amazing!!! i really didnt get a good chance to get to know her in middleschool because we were never in the same core but when we got to highschool i saw her daily and i got to see how wonderful she really is. every time i think about steph leavin i just burst into tears because i cant stand the thought of her not being here. it is beyond all words that i feel bonded to her in some extraordinary way! for those of you who are reading this and never got the chance at all to meet stephanie and you never knew just how great she is i am really sorry for you because she is one person who in her (soon to be) 15 years of life have made unremarkable changes in the world. she is just more amazing than all the words and sentences and letters and thoughts and ideas can describe. i love you stephy and i hope that you have a wonderful time in alabama and i cant wait for you to get back to colorado this summer so that we can spend more fun filled moments and memories together.  i love you so much!!!  and will miss you  too   much! bye sweetheart!

      this weekend has been so tiring. friday i came home watched my cousins kids, went shopping last minute, and left for whitneys. when i got there we headed to the movies to see dirty dancing havana nights. it was actually really good... well all but the ending. i think that it should have been a happier one. after the movies all of us... minus cayce jon diane nicole and lauren (who i miss so much), went to whitneys house to hang out. it was fun we had cake and it was DORA! it was so cool! and really yummy! whit unwrapped her gifts, which amounted to quite a bit of cash lol, and some nice things for her room and bathroom we all went and chilled in the basement. the guys (mark, jake, andy, and nick) went outside and wrestled and it sounds as if jake whooped a little ass... very nice my little ninja turtle! haha! the last person to leave whitneys house was steve, yes the same one who didnt come to the movie, but was sick, really, left at about midnightish. then becca whitney and i stayed up until way too late... playing carebear cards. much fun we had. then we had to get up early and i went home, sat around for a while, then crashed. i was asleep for like 3 hours, and i cant go to sleep if its daytime and i was so out of it that i fell asleep at 1 in the afternoon. it was insane. when i got up i had to deal with my sisters and their little friends bc jennifer had her 11th birthday party. finally my dad said that it was time to go to bed! and i was out by 10:30 and i didnt get up this morning until around 11:40ish! it was great. but really thats all i have done this weekend. rather boring and unfun except for friday. this week im gonna go to the movies and see dawn of the dead, but i have to take my cousin jeff for his birthday which means i prolly wont be myself given jeff would rat on me any chance he got. but thats wat cousins are for, because i kno that i would do the same to him if i was given the opportunity! haha! and its not like hes turning 10 or 11 or some crap... hes actually my age, turnin 15. kim youre coming over to my house sometime this week... got it? good. and im going down to denver to visit my buddy lydia! man o man do i miss her. im gonna try and see if i can find sometime to see erica and jessica this week and i also have to go to the zoo! i love that place! its great fun! but i have nothing to talk about, and i only blabbed all this out so that andy would have something to read... :) so im gonna go talk to yall later. b'bye.

      today has sucked, plain and simple. but let me start out with an apology to a certain person. i am sorry for talkin about you behind your back, and even though i dont kno much about you and you the same with me i hope that you could forgive me. im not sayin lets be bestfriends... im just sorry. thats all... but anyways... people are crappy and i feel like i should just give up and move to an island far away from civilization and never return. and honestly, i dont think id really be missed all that much... which is really sad. yea of course there are those ppl that would cry for me: whitney, kim, lydia, my family, and probably a few others but really there are not that many ppl who would be sad to see me go. and that is the worst feeling in the world. to feel unloved. and today, thats all i have felt. my hatred for humanity has grown so much in the past week it is unbelievable. and yet i go on. because no matter how horrible life gets it always works out and gets better. and i kno that, so i can forgive and forget. and thats wat i have been doin for the past year. and today i let it go and im sorry to all the people that i have blown up on these past few weeks. which also implies to the person above. well im glad that i got all that off my chest. it was killing me today. and once again to everybody... im sorry.

       move in or move on 

i used this title for my blog because it seemed to have really good meaning for me at the time i started this. i was really angry with a lot of people and it helped to get it out even when noone in hell understood what i was talking about. then i changed my tone... and i found new guys to hang out with and talk about and eventually like. but one of them turned out to be the wrong kind of bad... and to the other one i was a major itch with a bee... and im really sorry for that. but for some reason i believe that that was the only way to get my "unfeelings" through to that particular person. and now ive decided that ONCE AGAIN its just about time for me to move on... i cant wait for things to happen to me forever. and i wont... kim i think that you understand what im sayin and for the rest of you its not really important to you beacuse most of you would just be thinking "oh the drama", and "get a life and just get over it". so you ppl can just stop reading right now... on the other hand it would be beneficial for the other people who kno me well and who are pretty important in my life right now to be listening to this...
kim: you are so amazing and i love you so much... you are the most wonderful person in the world and you only deserve to be happy... and i kno that you will be it will just take time and you need to kno that and i understand that it really sucks and that you are just going through a hard time but you will love again and trust me you will be loved... noone ever stopped loving you. or atleast i never did!
whitney: you make everything so much better. you are so great and you are so important to me. i think that you need to start taking better care of whitney tho and not so much everyother person in the world... for once JUST think about you! please!!!
andy: you are so great and im so glad that ive gotten to kno you like i have these past few months. i really hope that we can get closer because you are awesome!
cayce: you are one of the most inspiring people that i kno. you have so much talent and creativity. you are so great!
and lydia: i dont kno if you read this but if you do... i love you so much and i miss you even more. i cant wait to see you and ill talk to you soon!

nobody may understand why im doing this and really neither do i, but i do kno that i love all of you (even those of you who dont have special little notes) you are all so important to me and you rock!

lots and lots of love

        this past week has been so crazy... for some reason ive had this really odd attitude toward a lot of people. people that i have no reason being angry, frustrated, or pissed off at. to you people... some of you with no names... i am very sorry. i thought that i should just come here to make sure that you all knew that. but the biggest apology i owe is to my boyfriend. i was a major bitch to him. and im sorry. i dont kno wat to say. i feel so terrible and even though he may not kno wat i did, a lot of you do. i didnt do anything bad lol i just wasnt the greatest girlfriend in the world. and thats my job. i need to be more receiving... i was just... i dont really kno. but in any case, im sorry. really...

      today was so much fun. i went and tutored with whitney, which is an amazing way to spend your free time helping others. then i went to elitches with andy and whit and josh. it was so great! i had a lot of fun just chillen with some really awesome people. then whitney and i babysat, which was also fun! lol! BUT the thing that was the most fun for me today, was realizing how wonderful my boyfriend is. he is so amazing and i love him so much. hes definitely one of the greatest people that i kno. im so glad that i have him to "call my own" lol! do you want to kno the greatest feeling in the world? the most powerful? the down right best? well its knowing... not just thinking you kno, that you are loved. by anyone... but especially by someone that you kno that you love back. love is a very strong emotion, that i dont feel should be used too extremely lightly. now i kno that ive said it and not truly meant it. but lately ive realized that to say it and not mean it is worthless and just a flat out waste of time. im sure that we all kno who this is really to... so im just tryin to say that i really love you. ;) bye ppl...

       Kari came over yesterday for a girls night. It was so fun. But I am so tired, lol! She got here at about 4 or so yesterday and we left as soon as she set her things down, because I took her to the movies and we went and saw Sleepover. Which was a pretty good movie, and of course the main man, was so hott! Oh yea and it was so funny because we were the only people in the entire theater, surprise surprise! Hahaha! Well when we got home we ate dinner and, again youre going to be surprised, Joe called. So all the time that Kari was here I was talkin to Joe. Ok, not all the time, and Kari was talkin to Jamie Morgan anyways, lol, but still. So when Joe and I, and Kari and Jamie, finally got off the phone, Kari and I just talked till like 3 or so in the morning. It was fun. Then we decided that we were hungry so we ate chips and dip (that we made at 3!) Then we were like really wanting to hear certain songs so we were gonna call the radio stations but we couldnt think of the name of the song she wanted to hear so we were just gonna sing it to the DJ, but then just as we were callin, the song came on! It was crazy! Then I wanted to hear Blackstreet "No diggity, no doubt" so I was gonna call in and I changed the station and it was on! Creepy was like the only word to describe it. Then around 4 we layed down in the bed and just talked, and next thing you knew, it was 6:30! So we called Tyler Stoakes, lol, and he was just gettin up for work, so we talked to him for a while. But Kair and I were so hyper by this time that we started calling radio stations asking for, "Super Hott Rockstar Tyler Stoakes, who had blonde hair and cheez-ited." LOL! But we called 93.3 and the guy started talkin to Kari and me. But he called Kari my retarded friend! It was so funny! But we dedicated Ocean Avenue to "Super Hott Rockstar Tyler Stoakes, with blonde hair, who cheez-ited!" It was so great! But the damn announcer guy never played the song. Kari and I were pissed! So at like, 8:25 Kari and I went to sleep, then we got up at 9:10. Yea so Im runnin on that much sleep, and I only blogged this much to keep me from fallin asleep, but I really dont have anything else to say so I think Im gonna go. BYE!!!

       One thousand words cant bring you back, I know because I tried. One thousand tears can't bring you back, I know because I cried. You left me with a broken heart, and lots of memories too, but I never wanted memories... I only wanted you. 
  &nbsp;
 You knok who you are, Im sorry for all of the time I made you waste, obviously it was too much bc... ugh... nvm. Im sure you get it. And if not, you know how to get in to... thats a little ironic, the way it starts out. You know how to get in touch with me. 
  &nbsp;
 I didnt think I could get hurt by him so much... whoever said time heals a broken heart, LIED.

       here it is, not even noon and ive already been on the phone for about an hour and ive already emailed 3 people. lol. tired does not even begin to describe my state of being. where to start... well on friday i had to babysit brandis girls. i got them at 2 or so and i was supposed to keep them till about 6 on saturday! but luckily i already had plans to go to the&nbsp;movies so for those precious 2 1/2 hours i got to relax. lol. but i got home, and had both girls sleep in my bed (that was just crazy) and then i finally got to sleep, but not until after about 10 phone calls. then on saturday i had the babies all day and finally john picked 'em up and by that time i had to get ready to go to the movies again! on friday synthia, joe, dano, and i went and saw white chicks... that is such a good movie! and then later that night my neighbor called and asked me to go to the movies with her so thats y i went on saturday too. we (toni, joe, dano, and myself) went and saw i, robot. its a pretty good movie too. but its totally not wat i expected. about this kid joe. hes i dont kno, a friend of tonis that ive been talkin to and he really likes me. and like hes cool and all, its just i really dont want a boyfriend and i "have my sights set on 'others'" so i dont kno wat to tell the kid. he always calls me, asks me to go places. it bothers me bc he thinks theres more than there really is. i just dont kno how to tell the kid no. i mean we go to the movies, i sit next to him, he asks to hold my hand... but thats nothing to me... im just afraid that thats everything to him. now this kid is by no means prude. but im not gettin into any relationship i dont want. and this is one of them.  
  &nbsp;
 ugh holy hell hes calling me again, he wants to do something today... i gotta go. save me!! bye!

       so much has happened since the last time that i blogged. wow, what seems like an eternity ago has really only been 3 days. on monday i had so many things to do and organize, from coming home from vacation, to getting things ready for what ive had instore this week. before i start... WHITNEYS BACK! isnt that just great?!?! i saw her last night at practice. lol yes, i did something. whitney and i are both on the... oh youll never guess this one... gymnastics team! now how funny is that? neither of us are athletic in the "gymnist" sense. we about died at practice last night. we could bearly do handstands, therefore you all are going to come and see us be complete and total idiots at one of our meets. lol! just kiddin! dont ever come! were terrible! so not only did i start that, this morning i went and... du du du... drove! yes, i, sara burney, drove! and not just here and there... i drove for 3 hours solid, on 4 different highways! im good, i drove for something like 150 miles! so along with all that good has come the bad. joe and dallas, ugh... they hooked up, or something like it at a party, but when she told him that it was her or me,  luckily  he chose me. then jay, man... all i want for that kid is happiness, hes my boo. damn. hes gone through so much hard shit, and i just want it to all clear up for him. but im not about to share his life im my blog. and i dont think he wants me to. so i guess you could say that joe and i are "dandy" again. im pretty tight with his mom, and she seems to like me. i adore his sisters, and his brother is hysterical! i dont kno wat else to say in here other than, and i already said this, YAY WHITS BACK! lol! wahoo! oyea... and stan wants to give a shout out... wat goin on yall?!? ;-)
