      Well I have a blog .... hmm ... what to do with it ... I think it will mainly be an entertainment tool for my friends.  But since that is what I love to do then it will all work out great.  I guess this first one will be nice and short.  :-P

      nothing here for days .... then 2 in one day ... go figure.  It's 10:25 ... my b/f said he would call right after 9.  Maybe it's not a big deal, but he knows it's one of my pet peeves when someone says they will do something and then doesn't.  If he had even messages and said he was busy with something and would call later it wouldn't even be a consideration at all ... but now an hour and a half late and nothing ... ugh.  why do i worry about such rediculous things?  i cant even remember what i put in here on my last entry (even tho it was only a few hours ago [sad huh?]).  i dont remember if i mentioned my latest toy (i think i did briefly).  well i discovered today that I ran out of hard drive space for lunix (nice of it to tell me).  so now i am cleaning off some space and going to resize my partitions so as to create more space for linux ... fun fun.  then maybe i can get it working like i want.  i still have to recofigure the network every time i reboot.  i really dont like linux .. but i am learning a lot and keeping myself busy at work so its all good.  i went to see the family today.  not really because i wanted to but because they had a computer problem that they cant fix (and it seem its a doozie of a problem).  so i was over at mom's and she made dinner .. now this is a rare privaledge and treat for me these days.  chicken pot pie .... i LOVE chicken pot pie ... and my mom makes the BEST chicken pot pie ever ... and i gorged myself (is that how you spell that?!? oh well).  then i had forgot it's wednesday ... my family goes to church on Wed (and twice on Sun [we have every since b4 i was born]).  SOOOO since i was there .. and mom knew i wasn't working or particularly busy ... i had to go :-\   I don't like going there anymore.  i was sitting there listening to the sermon and realized YET AGAIN that i haven't missed a single thing in all the time i have been away.  its the same old tired stuff resaid in a slightly different way.  i ALMOST got up at the end and said something to that effect, but i am chicken and couldn't do it.  ok so now i am home ... yay ... and sooo freakin tired .... i should go to bed, but i need to finish copying data ... the ? will be if i can resist working more on linux once the copy is done ... we shal see

      man ... I was going to write at least a little something in this every day ... well we all see how well that has worked so far.  Maybe if i can get into a habbit of doing it.  i was going to put nice juciy incriminating things here.  Like how anoyed i am about certain things with my b/f.  he does EVERYTHING with his friend ... which is great except that it seems like he can't do anything without them (even something like going to a movie with just me and him).  The last few weekends I have been down there I have wanted to go to a movie.  he hasn't seemed that interested in going and that is OK ... the one time we were actually trying to get things together he called his friends to see if one of them wanted to go.  it didnt seem anyone else was going so he didnt want to ... now granted there were other things (like the time and such) that he said were a factor ... but it just seems to me like he doesnt want to do things with just me.  i dunno - maybe i am just paranoid.  he was kinda down all this past weekend, said he has a lot on his mind.  i know he does - he is getting ready to move - and had many decisions to make in the very near future.  some of it is kinda driving me nuts tho.  i love him ... and sometimes i feel that returned very well ... but at other times its like he is almost sick of me.  ok enough about that.  work .. ugh ... UGH.  I am now scheduled to work Sun - Fri yet somehow working 6 days a week I still don't get 40 hours. some days i drive an hour to work .. work 4 hours .. then drive an hour home ... it sux!!  especially with gas prices as high as they are.  oh well i need to money so I guess i suck it up and go.  nothing else is really going on in my life.  i have been playing with a new toy -- Linux -- it's relatively evil, but I get some measure of pleasure bending it to my will muah haa haa (evil laugh?).  ok that enough fer now ... more to come .... i hope

      he never did call ... and i waited up until nidnight ... and left the phone ringer on so i could hear ... and he didn't call.  yesterday was the first day since we met that we didn't communicate in some way or another.  maybe i am unusual in this, but when someone is sposed to call and doesn't i usually wont try to contact them again until they contact me ... (at least not for a long time).  with a b/f its a little different tho and i wanted to hear from him so bad that i messaged him this morning.  just wished him a good day ... and he messaged back and said "baby i miss you so much".  how can i stay mad at him when he says things like that?  but it was like nothing at all that we didn't talk yesterday ... i bet he forgot that he was going to call ... but he didnt even message me all day .. sooo unusual... geeze i am messed up worrying about this so much.  i really dont mean for my b/f to take up so much of this blog ... just seems to be what is on my mind mostly now.  well that and linux ... ugh there is another nightmare.  i learned that it is a bad thing to let the linux partition get completely full.  it won't boot now.  i am actually dlding another version of linux (one that runs completely off a CD) just so i can resuce the one I already have installed.  partition magic can't modify the size of a linux partition apperntly ... (in fact its now unable to modify the ntfs partition on my laptop and i don't know why) .. only 3 and half more hours to dld the CD iso.  more later

      ok just got back from seeing Troy.  First let me say, Brad Pitt!!!! OMG!!!  he is sooo freaking hot!!  Nice skin in the flick, but of course it left me wanting more.  Brad wasn't the only hottie either.  Orlando Bloom was showing off as well.  Moving past the cute bois - Troy was a great movie.  I really enjoyed it, quite a bit of violence, but it was part of what really happened and a little hard to avoid.  They didn't dwell on the gore THAT much.  I think the movie as a whole was very good even tho it was a somewhat sad ending.  well there is one movie off my list to see ... so many left to go.  i really want to go see a movie with my b/f ... but whenever i am down there he just doesnt seem to want to.  I know he really wants to see the day after tomorrow.  and even tho my roommate want to go see that i am not going to go with him until i see if my b/f will wait to see it with me.  i havent asked him to wait or anything ... but he knows i love movies ... and that i have been wanting to see one with him ... and if he knows me at all should be able to figure out that i am waiting for him .... guess we will see.  ok so last time i talked about him on here i think i was anoyed that he didnt call .... well i messaged him that next morning like i said and just said that he missed me ... nothing else.  later that day we messaged some more and he said that he was sick.  maybe that is why he didnt call ... he never explained .. i dont think he even realizes he was sposed to call ... oh well.  only a couple messages that afternoon then nothing for a long while.  i sent another message at about 10pm (normally this is not at all late for either of us).  i got no reply.  i hope he was asleep ... it would be the only 'excuse' i would accept without getting mad (since he was sick).  today i heard from him again (still not a reply from my message last night at 10 .. nor a reply from the text i sent this morning).  it was a voice mail that basically said nothing other than he was real sick.  i sent him another text saying i hope he feels better soon this afternoon ... and have heard nothing since then.  i am just not sure what to think.  i am sooo freaking tired.  it really hasnt been a good day.  i wasnt supposed to go to work until 12:30 .. but they called and woke me up (the one day this week i had decided to sleep in).  so i went in early.  i spent most of the day (again) trying to get my linux where i want it.  i had actually managed to completely screw up my laptop so that it wouldnt even boot.  i was trying to fix that all last night to no avail.  then finnaly i just decided to blow it all away and start over.  i got a new distibution of linux (mandrake 10) and installed it.  it did some things better than redhat but others worse.  it immediately picked up my regular network card (which i never had working in redhat), but it failed to get my video driver right.  i got the video working, but as of yet have not been able to get the correct driver installed.  i also have to start over from scratch on the wireless network card (but at least now i know aproximately what to do).  i should be sleeping right now.  i have to get up in the morning to go help my cousin pick out a computer ... ugh .. to early .. hehe  hmm .. i had one more topic that i was going to put here ... but i am thinking twice about it.  first i am very tired ... and twice i dunno that anyone (except my one special friend) would even want to hear about it, lol.  Oh well maybe later maybe not.  gnight all ... sleep well ... and dont let the bed bugs bite (not that i have ever seen one)

      so i went to church today.  my grandfather was preaching.  he even got around to the subject of how homosexuality is wrong.  then we had a specially dinner for my grandparents because its their 50th wedding anniversery.  ok so after the dinner my cousin asks to talk to me in private.  she and I have always been prety close (she is one of the closest to me in my whole family).  she starts out saying "i know you are leading a prety open gay lifestyle".  I just think oh great.  side note - my church believes in church discipline ... when someone isnt behaving "in a christian mannor" they are put out of the church.  now to make a long story short my cousin has started the process of church discipline on me.    i didnt really want to be part of that church anymore anyway.

      ok .. well i talked to Richard (my b/f if i haven't mentioned name yet) today ... first time we have actually spoken since Monday ... seem that he didn't forget to call ... he just didn't.  I almost wish I didn't know this.  when i asked him why he didn't call he only said 'I don't know'.  saying that i am not happy about it would fall short.  i sent him a couple texts today too ... and no replies (this is getting to be a normal thing).  if i am honest with myself I dont see this lasting much longer.  he just isn't showing any intrest in me right now ... this all started very suddenly last weekend when i went down to visit.  i could feel a change in him but i have no clue what or why and he insisted everything is ok.  well guess we will just see what happens.  i dont know why i am torturing myself with linux.  i think its to the point i that i cant quit just becuase that would mean it has beaten me again.  so now i am back to redhat (where i began).  i had made a lot more progress on it ... but now its not working like it did before.  it seems i missed a step somewhere.  ugh.  .... ok i have been working on it as i have been trying to write this and it seems i am getting somewhere ... lets hope anyway.  (Man I am such a nerd).  I have a rahter bad headache and it just keeps getting worse.  i am going to take some drugs and try to survive.  more later

      well my cousin doesn't waste time.  she continued with the discipline process right away.  so i had to talk to her and my aunt and another guy from the church who i am also very close with.  and i turned into a coward ... i lied to them and told them that i don't have sex with guys.  i admited i was gay and attracted to guys, but said that i wasn't acting on it.  i don't really know why i couldnt tell them the truth.  if it wasn't my family ... i don't know.  they still had more issues.  i don't beleive that the Bible is 100% accurate anymore and this came up in the conversation.  it is the main thing they had a problem with after I argues them down about the gay thing.  in the concultion they basically said that I should go before the church and ask to be disciplined myself.  and i think i will.  i don't mind leaving the church for that reason - but i dont want the gay issue brought up in front of everyone else there.  many people there dont know that about me and i would just assume leave their ignorance in tact.  i know i shouldnt care if i am leaving anyway ... but oh well.  i talked to richard some over the weekend.  he says he's been really blah the past week (seems like an epidemic around here).  he was more like his old self but still not quite back to where he was when we met and the first couple weeks.  i so don't know what to do .... he hasn't done anything THAT bad ... certainly nothing i can't forgive him for (even if not calling when you say you will is a pet peeve or mine).  i definately still love him - tho i have to admit that the feeling is not as strong as it was.  guess i will have to see how he reacts the next time we are together.  part of my problem is that i react strongest to someone who reacts to me stongly.  ie - as long as he still shows he loves me i will love him back.  wow we just had a power outage ... thank goodness for the UPS. i didnt loose a thing :-D  what to do ... what to do ...

      ok ... last night after i finished watching spiderman and tried to actually sleep (a little after 4am) i realized that i was actually very depressed.  i dont know exactly why but more than likely it is mostly due to the whole church thing.  some people may wonder why that has me so upset but to understand that you need to know a few thing.  first my church is comprised of ALL my family in the area.  We have 3 pastors -- my grandfather is one, my uncle is another, and the third happens to be my uncle once removed.  I am directly related to almost half of the church.  my mom, brothers, sister, cousins, aunts, and uncles all go here ... and we have all gone here prety much as long as i have been alive.  i was baptised and became a member at about age 6 and have been fairly active in the church off and on since then.  i am current one of the song leaders and have been in the choir for years as well as helping direct the choir.  most of my life has revolved around the church and the people in the church.  until after i graduated from highschool almost ALL of my friends were from church.  leaving this church is leaving the single biggest influence in my life.  but i think i need to.  i am very afraid of how my family will react.  i am dreading the talks they will inevitably want to have ... the nagging i know i won't be able to avoid.  all in all there is no wasy way out of this.  some have said that i should just leave without saying anything .. but i feel that i owe these people more.  they believe they are doing the right thing and i cannot be mad or upset or critical of them for thier belief.  work was maddning (sp?) today.  simply crazy.  too much going on.  i got off at 8 .. i got home a lil after 9 .. and they want me back at like 7 in the morning.  this means i have to get up at 5 .. which means for 8 hours of sleep i need to go to bed at 9 (oops too late).  wow there is no time left.  i am also starving becuase i have no money to afford food right now.  life is great [i am sure the no money thing is contributing to the depression].  anyway i am going to try to sleep ... wish me luck   PS - if you are wondering about the title .. its about what i am feeling just now ....

      Ok so it's been a while since i wrote.  i konw you are all dying to hear how things are developing in my life  (like anyone really cares ... [ok yeah i know YOU do but i chat with you almost every day :-P ]).  So wow ummm ... last entry was the day after i talked to my cousin and aunt and other friend ....  at that time i was thinking that this past wednesday was business meeting and i could just get this all over with.i was wrong.  business meeting is the 2nd wednesday of the month which makes it this coming Wed.  So last week I went to church and sat there like a good boy pretending nothing was wrong.  One of the pastors (the one that is my uncle once removed) had been wanting to have lunch or dinner with me for a while ... just to "catch up" as he put it.  What this really means is he wants to talk about how i am doing with the gay "issue".  He already konws some of my past history ... he knows i am gay ... and knows about one particularly bad episode that happened about 6 years ago.  so we went to dinner thurs night.  it didn't go very well.  i told him that things had not really changed with the gay "issue" - that i am still attracted to guys and not to girl .. etc etc .. and he was "saddened" to hear that.  then i said that we needed to talk about something else and started on the whole subject that I don't beleive the Bible to be 100% anymore.  This got him going.  To make a long story short (I already know this post is going to be a big one) ... he argued this and that and we came to no conclusion.  He said that he wants me to sit down with him and my grandfather (one of the other pastors) and discuss this.  SIDENOTE -- I hate dentists ... I loath them ... the smell of a dentist office is just about enough to make me sick to my stomach (yes this will have some bearing on this post in a moment).  Ok I would rather go to the dentist for a root canal than sit with my grandfather and talk about all this.  It's sometimes all I can do to not go nuts just talking about the website I work on for him.  ::sigh::  Yet now here i am scheduled to meet with the two of them on Monday night. .... prepare the traquilizer ... so after i got home i was a bit upset about the whole meeting.  keep in mind that i had 3 hours of sleep the night before this and was feeling sick to my stomach ever since lunch.  I tried to call Richard and only got voice mail.  I left a message almost in tears and then just went to bed completely drianed.  i talked to Richard some this week ... well I tried to most of the week ... and actually got to some this weekend.  seems he has been going to bed very early this week and so hasn't returned my calls or messages very much.  tho it's been a lot better this weekend.  I was hopeing to go down to see him friday ... but he has moved and is staying with friends and sleeping on the couch.  so there really isn't room and he feels it would be weird to invite me to stay there since it's not his place.  i totally understand that have no problem.  so I told him I would come down Sat ... he was going to call me later friday and we could finalize plans ...  well i decided to go to a movie fri night and he called during it (i had expected him to call hours earlier but oh well).  he left a message saying that it kinda rediculous to drive down for just one day and waste the gass and such and that he is coming up here next weekend anyway and we can just see each other then.  all very reasonable ..... excpet he is my b/f and the drive is nothing to me to get to see him.  however ... i really did need to get the oil changed in my car (it has oil dificulties and if not changed on time it will run out).  I also was unable to sleep last night and didnt get to sleep until after 4am.  so i decided that i would not go down today.  instead i got my oil changed and tried to get my stero fixed (Best Buy was too busy tho ... ugh).  I am planning to go down to the show tonight in Atl.  I should be able to see Richard then.  I also plan to get a hotel since it really won't be that much more expensive than driving all the way back to simpsonville and then back to clemson again the next day.  (plus i save 2 full hours of driving that i can use as sleep time :-D ).  we will see how things go with Richard when I am down there .... he lost a lot of points the past couple weeks with how distant he has been and not calling when he said he would and not returning voice mails or text messages.  .... guess we will see ... maybe i am too forgiving but oh well ::shrug:: its who i am.  one of my friends was reading my blog and read all about this church situtation.  he seems to be quite anoyed with my church (and i certainly can't blame him).  we had dinner tonight and talked about it all among several other things.  seems that a few of my friends from back in clemson are not happy about it ... and it sounds like some of them may show up at my church Wed for the business meeting.  this promises to be MOST interesting.  I really hope that gay "issue" doesn't come up at all in the meeting.  I don't mind being disciplined for not beleiving the Bible is 100% accurate (in fact want to be disciplined), but I do not think the fact that I am gay should have any part in it.  if it is brought up ... well lets just say I don't think my church is prepared for what may happen.  I love my friends!!!  so .. how i am now .. i guess i am OK.  certainly better than i was about it, but still dreading what is to come.  i have been asked why don't i just walk away from it all ... and the main reason is that it would simply drag on a lot longer.  i want to get this all over with as fast as possible and try to move on with my life.  let's hope things dont get much worse before they get better ......

      well i shoulda seen it coming ... the way Richard was when i was there 2 weeks ago ... how much he ignored me last week ... it was way obvious ... but i didn't see it ... not until we sat down on the couch last night.  I could go into all that has been going on in Richard's life but frankly right now i don't care.  Suffice it to say that I am single again.  He said it's becuase of how much crap he has to deal with in his life right now and the distance.  whatever.  I will say that he has absolutely wonderful timing. NOT.  I wouldn't be that upset about it except for all the other junk in my life.  i still love him but was never in love with him so its not that big of a deal ... just one more log on the flames ... just salt rubbed in the wounds.  what i do see coming is the conversation tonight with my grandfather and pastor hawkins.  i am dreading this soo much.  i am supposed to let Kevin know how it goes so he knows what to expect on Wed night (he is going to be there along with several other friends it seems to suuport me).  It also seems there may be some people from the sc pride association (or something like that) as well as some other churchs in the area.  it sounds like its going to be a mad house.  i dont think i am really looking forward to that either.  well whatever happens .. my life will be different after wed ....

      ok i have been trying to post all morning.  it hasnt been letting me.  but here i am now posting ....  last night i had that talk with mr hawkins and my grandfather.  it went about like i expected - they fussed at me and told me how wrong i was and how i am going to ruin my life .. etc.  They prety much dismissed the idea that the Bible could have errors and completely ignored that subject.  They instead talked almost exclusively about the gay issue.  the amazing thing is how much we really agree on.  we all agree that the Bible says that any sex (or lust or thought of sex etc ... ) outside marrige is sin.  But they say I am trying to defend homosexuality becuase I don't beleive that having the attraction and such is a sin.  they were like "just give us a year and follow what we say to the letter and really want to change and you can have deliverence from this ... " blah blah.  i tried that i have been there it didnt work.  they say that it didnt work becuase i "put a time limit on God".  and yes i did decide after like two years of misery and no change that i was going to stop trying to be something i am not.  so really no ground was made either way.  i am going to be put out of church tomorrow and it looks like its over the gay issue and not the Bible issue.  according to the Bible you are NOT supposed to talk to other people about a discipline issue (unless you are asking them to come for the 2nd phase as a witness).  HOWEVER it seems that my grandfather told my mom about all this ... she in turn has told all my brothers and sistes ... even my uncle knows and has sent me an email continuing the fussing.  they dont follow thier own precious rules when it doesnt suit them.  talked to kevin after the meeting.  he has realized how nuts they had gone with the getting people out there for the meeting and knows i dont really want that.  he is now working to stop all the crazyness about it.  i dont really care who comes ... the fact that my friends are going to be there to support me is plenty enough.  kevin even says he will do his best to keep his mouth shut.  we will see what happens but as long as there isnt press i dont think i will be upset by it.  life goes on

      I forgot an important section in my last post ...   Several of my friends came out to suuport me last night in the meeting.  7 people showed up (2 I had never met before and 3 I have known a very short time and 2 i am rather well aquainted with [and one of the last 2 happens to have been my b/f not too long ago]).  I could tell the members of the church were afraid that my friends were going to cause a "scene", but they knew I did not want that.  They sat there through the whole 2 hour meeting and didnt say anything even though I know they had much they wanted to say.  They showed that "those people" (i e gay people) can be just as reasonable and considerate as anyone else (usually more in my experience).  I think my friends behaved a lot better than the people of the church.  I want to thank them all for comming out to support me.

      Last night I went through the ordeal of being put out of my church.  It was spearheaded by my family.  It felt like I was the target of a witch hunt.  They misrepresented what I said and wouldn't listen when I tried to correct them.  They were determined to burn me at the stake of my mistakes from the past.  They brought up 6 year old charges that I had long since repented of.  They refused to make the issue be the actual differneces in doctrine but prefered to say things like "he doesn't want to change" (referring to me not wanting to change the fact that I am gay).  There were about 3 members there who at least somewhat supported me -- they at least listened to what I was saying and made the only issue be that I disagree with the church concerning the complete accuracy of the Bible as it is today.  Anyway, I don't really feel like belaboring it all.  The actually motion that was made said something like I would have to say that I believe the Bible is acurate and capable to speak to the gay issue.  This was made by one of the people who believe me and it actually managed to satisfy everyone (even me).  I of course would not agree to say that since I don't believe it and so I was put out of the church.  So altho it was not technically for being gay, to most of the people there that was the issue.  Sad really.  Now I don't really hold any bad feelings for anyone there.  I belive that did what they think is right and they did it becuase they love me.  I have no doubt of that.  However they did some things that do upset me.  I know VERY well what they believe and teach; I have grown up with it litterally all my life.  I know that they teach it is wrong to talk about a discipline case with anyone from the church except those who are going with you to be a witness.  Dispite their belief in this they told my ENTIRE family before we got there.  Not even an hour after the meeting I had monday night with Mr. Hawkins and Grandfather my Mom called me to talk about it.  She had be told even before the meeting that it was going to happen and most of the details.  She then proceeded to tell my brothers and sister.  They also told my uncle (I got an email from him tues about it).  It anoys me that they don't follow their own rules yet put me out for simply not believeing the same things they do (not even an action).  Is that not hippocritical?  I also am anoyed that they twisted what I said and claimed that I said what I did not. .... oh well ... it's not my problem anymore.  as for me I am doing ok.  I hate crying and almost never do ... but seeing my Mom cry last night after the meeting sure got me going.  I am sorry things had to happen this way.  I am sorry that I "dissapoited" everyone.  But it is really thier own fault for being so close minded and unable to see even the possibility that they could be wrong.

      Well I am afraid that I won't be nearly as entertaining as I have been.  My drama level has dropped severiely since Wed night.  (Thank goodness).  However, since Wed I have also been extremely blah.  There are several reasons for this.  Part of it is that I needed an emotional break from the stupidity of my family and church.  Part of it is a lonely feeling since it feels like most of the people that I thought loved me turned thier back on me the past 2 weeks.  And a large part of it is worry about money ... since I have none.  Someone offered me $100 for him to give me a b/j .. I ALMOST considered it.  But that is just too yuckky!!  I have been talking to a couple guys online.  One of them had agreed to go to a movie with me but we never actually set a time.  I even gave him my cell and said to call if we didnt run into each other on chat ... did he call ... no of coruse not :(    Whatever, his loss.  So I thought the Richard drama saga had probably come to an end ... but who should message me last night but him.  He said "I know this is weird, but I miss you".  In truth I had wanted to message him and say that to him all week.  But I didnt!!  He broke up with me ... if he misses me and wants me back he has a LONG hard road ahead of him.  He asked me if I had missed him, and I was honest but left it there and didn't give him anything extra.  I am still anoyed with him.  So the blah days continue for now.  I just don't care about much of anything right now.  I am not upset, not happy, just kinda here.  oh well.

      I hate it when I loose things.  I know I wrote a peom called Apathy.  Since that is what I have been feeling lately i was trying to find it and see if it was any good.  I just can't seem to locate it.  It's rather frustrating to know something should be out there and not be able to locate it.  I guess, however, that I am no longer feeling apathetic about everything (now that I am frustrated, lol) so it may not even matter anymore.  Though not as apathetic as i have been I am still blah.  I have the worst sense when it comes to men (I must have got that from my mother [take my dad and step-dad as refernce there]).  It seems that the ones I would be best of with I just dont feel that way about.  and the ones that are going to be nothing but trouble for me are the ones i fall for almost insantly ... go figure.  As usual there seem to be a few guys at least interested in me on the surface (they will probably all dissapear when they are sure they arent going to get easy sex from me).  Tho almost all of them are quite a bit older (around 10 years older for most of them).  Not that its a problem ... after all my last b/f was 9 years older and he sure turned out to be a winner .....   Age doesnt really matter to a point.  I am not going to date a 50 y/o (yes they do try).  But someone at least somewhat close to my age who looks attractive to me (and there is a WIDE range of guys I find attractive) and nice and HONEST, certainly has a good chance with me if they will only treat me right.  There is also this very young guy I have know for several years.  He is only now 17 but has been declaring his love for me and how much he wants me since he was 15 (i of course told him there was NO way anything would happen between us with him being that young!!).  He has been there consistanly though and I do care deeply about him (tho its still more of a brother type love).  He really wants to date me and I am just not sure he is ready for that ... he (like me when I was younger) ... has lots of issues with being gay and I don't think he has really delt with them yet.  besides he lives almost 3 hours away and I DO NOT want another LD thing!!    I am not wanting to get right back into any type of relationship right now.  it would be better to stay single for a while and try to make some friends before i even think about getting involved with anyone.  ::sigh:: but knowing me there will come along some guy who really wants to date me and seems really cool and i will agree to date and things will be ok for a couple weeks then he, like every guy i really like, will rip my heart out, jump on it, and shred it to tiny bits yet again.  fun

      OK ... well as I think I have mentioned already ... I have been chatting with a couple guys online.  They all seemed nice and at least somewhat interested in me.  I went to meet one that seemed most promising Wed evening (despite the fact I had no money - not even for gas - since he paid for everything).  Before I left I promised myself there would be no sex ... (you can probably see where this is going).  He was kinda cute but looked a little old (probably becuase of the drugs he used to do [but he has been clean and sober for years now]).  I was not over attracted to him .. yeah kinda cute .. fairly hot body .. but i didn't want to do anything with him.  apparently he did with me tho .. and he started kissing etc ... then one thing led to another .. blah blah.  and there in lies the most stupid thing ever .. i didnt want it .. i didnt want to do anything .. but i didnt stop him .. it was almost like i LET him rape me ...... but its not that becuase as far as he knew it was fine.  UGH what is wrong with me!?!?  OK well i don't plan to meet up with him again.  I am just tired of guys in general .. is that going to stop me from going out on dates ... no ...      cuz i am stupid.  nothing else is really going on.  working a lot as usual but not enough ... wasteing SOO much time driving.  bank things finnaly a little better since i got paid today .. but the negative balance i had will still leave me with practically nothing.  i am sposed to have a date sat with another new guy ... to go to movie .. but i dont really want to go becuase i met yet ANOTHER guy online who I already like better (see i am stupid, idiot, dumb, ugh).  but i will go becuase i agreed to it (and because i still love movies).  he does seem like a nice enough guy, but i am afraid we have nothing in common.  oh well ... it's ok.  i really want to meet the other guy i am now talking to, but it seems our schedule is just not working out together well yet ... if i didnt already have plan sat night we could meet then, but again .. oh well.  what i should probably do is just not meet anyone, not go anywhere, save all my money and work on getting completely over everything i have been through the past few weeks.  but that's no fun.  blah ....   blah ....  blah and blah....

      OK well i believe that I mentioned in my last post that I had a date with a guy to go to a movie Sat night.  .... it didn't happen that way ... but the story teller in me wants to start with some other information first to make it all sound (hopefully) a little more dramatic than it actually was.  I find it strange how guys appear in my life in spurts ...  I may go 3 months not many anyone new of any intrest what-so-ever .. then alla sudden I meet 4 guys in one week.  I have been chatting with 4 new guys lately that seemed very interested in me.  The first was the guy who prompted my last post (you know the one where I proclaimed how much of an idiot I am .. maybe I should remove that one ... ::shrug:: .. ).  The second was the guy I was sposed to meet Sat night for a movie.  The third is a somewhat unusual guy who has taken me to be a therapist of some kind and continues to pour his mind out to me in email and seems to want to meet, but then also doesnt want to ... a little strange situation there.  The fourth is who I actually spent Saturday with and the only one of the lot that is really showing promise for a good long term friendship (and maybe more).  I did not stand up the guy I was sposed to go out with Sat to go out with someone else .. don't get me wrong.  I would not do that - it would be immature and petty and extremely rude.  However I did reschedule meeting him.  It turned out that it worked well for both of us.  I called him when I got off work Friday ... now keep in mind that I work MUCH close to where he lives than where I live.  So when we were talking I had the briliant thought that maybe we could hang out Friday instead of Sat (since I would not be in the area Sat and was hopeing to meet the other guy then anyway).  Now when I started this plan I had decided that if it went well and he wanted to still go to a movie Sat that it would be cool and we would ... however after getting to his house and talking with him I learned that he was actually relieved that we got together Friday instead becuase he didn't want to miss USC playing baseball Sat.  So problem solved.  He also seemed about as intelegent as a log ... not that I am trying to be mean here but that is how he came across.  So that is 2 of the 4 definately out of the pic ... and the other one so close to out that it's almost sad.  That leaves the newest guy ... David.  He really seems like a very nice guy.  But not perfect (like anyone ever is) ... first he is only 20 (which isnt a bad thing of itself but there is a level of immaturity that goes with that) ... second he seems to have some issues still plaugeing him with family.  Now as anyone who reads my blog should know I certainly understand about family issues ... but he is still in the middle of the mess.  He lives at home and doesnt feel he can do certain things becuase of family.  For example he had to get home before it was very late Sat (even tho he said he wanted to stay longer).  He also is talking about me having to pretend that I am a str8 friend to his parents ... and I don't really mind that - I can do it wihtout lying unless they ask me directly.  People always assume I am str8 and I usually just let them continue that assumtion.  So while I see some very good potential there I am leary of a couple of things.  He seems to be quite ennamered (sp?) with me tho.  He actually said "I feel like I have met the man of my dreams".  Does that scare me ... maybe a little  ... but only in that I am afriad he will get hurt if for whatever reason it doesnt work out.  I am at work today.  I am the only one here working today.  I am not supposed to be the only one working today.  I am not happy about it.  I am rather bored and alone.  Not to mention I have to do all the work myself and still being somewhat new around here still don't know the answers to a lot of the ?'s.  Oh well ... it does mean that I will be able to close the lab a little early tho.  Richard messaged me again last night at about 2:30am.  I was already asleep and didn't get the message till today.  He asked if I was going to atlanta today ... I did reply this afternoon and tell him no.  I don't really want to talk to him though until he apologizes for the way he treats me ... ignoring me most of the time then expecting me to answer when he messages me.  Whatever .. I think I am almost over him all the way.  So if any of you who are facinated by my blog (like anyone is [xcept maybe one person]) and have been just dying to know what ever became of linux ... lol yeah right.  Well I got it working to my satisfaction for almost everything I do with a computer.  I could not get open office to run (a program that is like MS Office), but I almost never use that.  I got both networking cards working (however I must enter the wireless key everything I reboot).  I actually quit usuing it all together tho and went back to windows since everything is so much easier there.  Today I am back on liux becuase it is the default boot OS and it started booting to it and i am too lazy to reboot to go back to windows, lol.  I really don't have any more playing to do with it right now tho.  Hmmm ... any other loose ends I left on here?  I can't think of any right now, but if there is anything that you, the readers, want to know please ask them in comments and I will try to get back to them as soon as possible.  laters

      OK ... so I have met this guy, David.  I don't even know where to start.  First I will say that I LOVE spending time with him.  He is fun to be around and seems to really be into me.  I am already starting to have prety strong feelings for him and I have only known him like 4 days.  He is very energetic and youthfull (and we all know how much that attracts me).  Not to mention he is very cute.  we seem to have the feelings when it comes to what we want as far as a relationship (like we both eventually want something long term), neither of us are the jealous type and and we are both open and easy going.  We don't like people whe are controling and we aren't controlling.  We both have very religous families who give us a hard time about being gay so there is a certain bonding and understanding there.  Anyone who knows me knows that I have a bad habbit of going to fast in relationships (case in point my last one with Richard).  I am trying very hard not to go to fast.  It's like my best friend said "I don't see how taking it slow could ever hurt anything".  So that is what I should do ... what will I do .. i guess only time will tell.  There is a part of me that is scared ... that's the part that has been hurt over and over and over again, the part that remembers the previous guys who simply dissapeared from my life with no warning or reason, the part that remembers being torn to shreds time and again whenever it made the "mistake" of truely caring for someone.  He says he loves me .. he says he thinks he wants to spend his life with me ... which sounds great but after the short time we have known each other it seems a little like infatutation rather than the kind of lasting love that a relationship needs.  I do believe he feels the way he says, I certainly don't think he is lying to me or anything and he really seems to be serious.  I only worry that his feelings will change as he gets a little older.  So what am I going to do ... I am going to keep on like things are now.  Spend time with him when I can, get to know him and let him know me, take it as slow as I can.  In time the feelings, if real, should deepen and grow.  Then we can start a something more serious and long term.  For now I am simply enjoying every minute I get to spend with him.  I already started missing him only a few minutes after he left Monday (which is VERY weird becuase I rarely miss anyone).  Some of my friends think it's only becuase of how good he looks ... but I don't think that is really why I feel the way I do.  I letting him read this blog .. and if he can read all the stuff here and still like me then i spose there is hope for us.

      what I am about to say won't come as a suprise to any of you that know me. ... I can't stop thinking about David ... He permeates my thoughts and feelings ... taking it slow or not it's already to late to "not get hurt" if somehow it doesn't work out.  This is not to say that I am not still going to try to take it slow.  Still think it's possible that going to fast will had an adverse effect on the relationship, so I am still all for taking it slow, but man I can barely stand the time apart sometimes.  I haven't seen him since Monday and I really am not sure there are words in the English language to describe how I miss him.  It's just been so incredible to feel a closeness to someone and have that feeling returned.  I went to a movie Tues night with a friend and even though I really enjoyed the movie and had a nice time - the whole time I sat there all I could think about was David and how I wanted him to be there.  Am I being stupid?  Am I running headlong for a heart break?  I sure hope not, and I don't think so ... there is something differnt this time.  I can't quite put my finger on it - maybe it's the frist time this strong of feelings has been there on both sides?  Who knows; but I am prepared to ride this train to where-ever it leads me.

      Well, nothing new is really going on in my life right now.  David is still awesome.  I am getting fed up with work ... a measley $7/hr.  I made more doing one hour of work for my uncle (as a contractor) than I would have made if I felt up to going to work today.  (I have been sick and just didn't feel like making a long boring drive just to be bored at work for 5 hours and still only make a grand totaly of $37 that almost $10 of which would have been eaten up by gas to get there).  I need to do something about this work sitch.  My sister was in a wreck today.  Seems she was speeding and hydro planed (sp?) on a wet road and hit a building.  She is OK, but is going to be rather sore for a while.  Her car, on the other hand, is rather a mess.  I have been in my share of wrecks so I know what she is going thru.  I went to see her and other than feeling very sick and not being able to even keep water down yet, she is fine.  I know tis not going to be fun at all for her trying to get all this taken care of.  I have been talking with one of my newer friends about RPG's.  So I have been telling him all about EQ .. it has soo made me want to play again.  Unfortuanetly (grr i know that is not spelled right but I refuse to bother with it enough to care)  Steve is no longer keeping my account active.  This means I can't get online at all unless I cough up some money to reinstate the account.  I am thinking I may start it back up for a month and see if I can have any fun with the new featurs.  Something to do since I no longer have much to desire to chat.  Hmm well guess that is all i have for now .....

      David left his watch over at my place when he was there yesterday.  I decided to "keep it safe" for him by wearing it.  I had forgten how much I like the feel of something on my wrist (I had stopped wearing thing there for the very silly reason that it messed up my tan, lol).  I also find it nice to wear something of his ... reminds me ever more of him (not that he wasn't already in my thoughts all the time).  I think I need to get me a new watch.  I used to go for the bigger digital ones with all the features ... but I am thinking something small and elegant would be nice (tho it will still have to be digital since it takes me so long to read an analogue that by the time i read it ... it's a different time.  OF course I still don't have any money.  I will get another $300 (aprox) check next Friday (week from today) and I don't have a lot of bills due out of that check ... but I am prety far behind on my gas card (the minimum was made but I want to pay it off every month).  Plus car insurance will come of it ... AND I know that my next check will be smaller dure to the help desk being open less hours during summer break.   :::sigh:::  I need a better job or a lot more hours ... or both.

          Daniel Bedingfield Unofficial   Lyrics   - "If You're Not The One" If you’re not the one then why does my soul feel glad today? If you’re not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way? If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all  I never know what the future brings  But I know you are here with me now We’ll make it through  And I hope you are the one I share my life with  I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am? Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?  If I don’t need you then why am I crying on my bed? If I don’t need you then why does your name resound in my head? If you’re not for me then why does this distance maim my life? If you’re not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife?  I don’t know why you’re so far away  But I know that this much is true We’ll make it through  And I hope you are the one I share my life with And I wish that you could be the one I die with And I pray in you’re the one I build my home with I hope I love you all my life  I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?  ‘Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today ‘Cause I love you, whether it’s wrong or right And though I can’t be with you tonight And know my heart is by your side  I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am Is there any way that I could stay in your arms

      Here it is ... almost 1:30pm on a lazy rainy friday afternoon.  I am sitting at a desk ... looking at scores of hot guys and girls filter in and and out of the lab here at work.  It's another day of orientation, and while that usually means we are busy; it hasn't been very busy today.  I am doing nothing (well nothing but blogging [as should be rather obvious seeing as this post is being created]).  I am tired .. wasn't sleepy enough last night and didn't get a whole lot of sleep.  I am off Sat and Sun (the help desk is closed then).  Jamie was talking about going to Atlanta for pride.  I was interested in going(and told him I would go with him).  I know i will probably enjoy it but it's an rather long drive (especially going down and coming back in the same day).  So it wouldn't bother me if we decided not to go -- he said that he may not want to if it's going to be rainy and messy like today.  UGH ... well this will end the boredom ... just had two laptops dropped on me to fix ... better get to it

      OK .. so last night was the first time David and I actually slept together.  I mean we slept in the same bed all night (we did not have sex).  It was awesome .. we both slept very well (except for a few minutes when we kinda both woke up a little horny and rubbed each other down [ok yeah if this is too much for you then don't read my blog :-P ]).  Before we went to bed there was a thunderstorm.  I LOVE thunderstorms and as it turns out so does David.  We stripped to our boxers and went out into the rain and lightning to see the storm.  We stood there just holding each other close (trying not to freeze) getting soaked and enjoying the moment and being together and life in general.  I was almost magical.  Then we both started to get hypothermia (lol well not really but it was freaking cold).  So we came inside and went to take a shower to get warmed up.  When we were laying in bed he started to open up to me a little more and tell me some more things about his past.  He still had things he was afraid that if I knew then I wouldn't like him anymore (silly boi after all I have done I could not judge anyone).  He was crying and very emotional with me and all I wanted was to hold him closer and take all his pain away.  If only I could ...    He is so sweet to me and shows remarkable love for me.  I haven't felt this way about anyone since the first boi I ever fell in love with.  I think this is going to last a very long time.  Well we didn't go to atlanta for pride.  Jamie decided not to ... oh well.  It would have been interesting and all, but I was dreading the drive down there and back (all in one day too).  So in a way I am relieved.  There will be plenty more chances to see what pride is like in the years to come.  I don't really agree with the whole thing anyway.  Here they are saying all they want is to be treated the same, but then they go and celebrate being different.   Go figure.  I think I will go to church tomorrow .. then to Sunday dinner at grandmothers.  Man I miss her dinners .. it will be such a treat.  I don't konw how things are giong to be, but I bet no one will say much of anything about what has happened.  WE'LL SEE.  Well I am very tired and my back still hurts (think I pulled a muscle or something).  So I am going to cut this short.    ..laters

      I know I haven't put anything new up here in a while .. that is because there is nothing at all new in my life.  Thing contibue as they have been.  David and I are still doing well and are happy.  I am still working and making WAY too little money.  I am going to seriously look for a new job (a second job becuase I just can't make enough money on "student" jobs). .... Wow ... nothing else to talk about.  I still haven't started back on EQ tho I am still thinking about it.  I have been real tired the past couple days for no reason.  I feel a general frustration with life ... not enough money .. not able to plan things becuase of too much uncertainty ... it's starting to get to me a little.  I know things will be fine and work out .. they always do .. but untill I am a little more stable its just going to be tough for a bit.   blah (if you haven't noticed this is my favorite word)

      people are simply obnioxous.  this is especially evident in driving.  most people simply do not have a clue how to drive.  they are almost without exception interested in one thing ... themselves.  the smallest amount of courteousness would improve the overall driving situation 10 fold.  When I drive I attempt to be polite ... and it often costs me time and a great and frustration.  I am so sick of inconsiderate drivers that I wish I could carry a gun and shoot out the tired of anyone I see doing something stupid becuase they can't stand to wait 0.2 seconds!!  I mean I realize that in a car ever 0.1 seconds can feel like a full minute (or 30 minutes of "having sex time"), but still come one poeople.  ANYWAY guess i am done ranting ... for now

      OK so I am sitting here in the library bored out of my mind.  Why? you ask (or would ask if I gave you the chance to).  Well the answer is simple ... there is a new branch of the help desk here in the library and I am working here today.  From 1 until 7.  It feels like monday (i guess becuase I have been off for 2 days and the real Monday was a holiday).  I had a nice weekend.  Went to Atlanta just to get away and to take David to see the Armorettes show.  Now the show is in a gay bar ... and you generally have to be 21 to get in there ... but David is only 20 and looks maybe 15 (something which I certainly like but that does not help when trying to get in such places).  So we met up with my of my friends (an armorett [forgive me for not being able to spell]) and helped him/her carry stuff in so that the door man would not question David's age.  It worked like a charm.  He loved the show (and I knew he would).  The only bad part about the whole weekend was the very long drive to and from atlanta.  David has been dealing with a guy he knows from cola for a while.  They are supposed to go to Las Vegas together to learn about some business stuff.  The guy is being a totaly jerk about some things tho.  I am not going to go into any real detail here because it's David's private life and not my place to talk about it much "in public", but I am going to comment in how it is affecting me.  First it's upsetting David some and I don't like that in the slightest.  Second I don't really want him to go for my own selfish reasons.  Third David is having to make the decision to go or not to and it's stressing him out.  He wants to go to learn the stuff, but is not sure about going with this guy.  Even tho I don't really want him to go ... I don't want him to always wonder what he missed if he didn't go.  I am completely trying to stay out of the decision and to be objective for him by pointing out the good and bad points of both going and staying.  It is of course his decision alone to make and I will support him either way he goes.  I will just be very glad when this whole thing is behind us.  ... and I hope I don't have to break the legs of that guy in cola ... cuz if he hurts David .... grrrr

      I absolutely hate being sick.  Why I seem doomed to spend so much of my life in that state is beyond me.  Been feeling sick since Friday, actually extremely miserable.  It feel like one of my "usual" sinus infections.  Since it wasn't going away (not even with the drugs i snatched from mom's [maybe cuz they were expired]), I had mom take me to the Doctor (needed her to pay for it and I was too miserable to drive much).  We went to this place called Doctor's Care.  It's open weekends and evenings to be more convient for people who work.  It's a nice concept but I found the whole experience rather lacking.  It was in fact just about the worst visit to the doc I've ever had.  First, when I got there probably about 5 people were waiting in the lobby.  This is not too many one would think for a doctors office.  But as called them in only maybe one ever 30 min ... well lets just say I ended up waiting for like 3 hours before I got to see a doc.  My meds worse off after about 1 hour of being there so by the time I got to the doc I was shivering from fever and in severe pain.  What really anoyed me about the wait tho was this.  There were people who had left - I mean came and checked in and rather than wait in lobby they left then came back.  In my opinion if they are not there when called they should be be put at the very back of the line.  But no, when they came back they took them right in ... and they obviously weren't very sick.  Meanwhile I was still sitting there shivering and obviouly beyond miserable.  So I finnaly get back to see the doc and the nurse has to do nurse stuff (i.e. take my blood pressure, check heart rate, and) take my temp.  HOWEVER, when she got the thermometer it wouldn't work.  She kept trying and trying but nothing, then she was like "well let me go ask him what he wants me to do".  We are like thinking 'what they only have one thermometer'.  Then more waiting and finnaly the doc comes in.  He asks a lot of questions, no prob.  Then he starts pokeing me.  The usual feeling lymph node etc but he pushes WAY too hard.  He hurt me how hard he pressed in places that I wasn't even hurting before.  I told him I thought it was a sinus infection, but he thought it was more.  So to be thourough he took blood (well he didn't but he had the nurse come back for that) and they ran tests for infection and mono and also too a throught swipe to check for strep.  It was only an infection tho ... he said "it's not a sinus infection, just an infection" ... well I say it's an infection, and it's in my sinus so yeah it IS a sinus infection.  He gave me enough samples of an antibiotic so I won't have to buy any and wrote a prescrip for some decongestant and some stuff called magic mouthwash or some junk.  It's basically nothing more than chloroseptic (sp).  Interestingly enough my cousin had some and had given it to me to try just earlier today.  I told him that and that it doesnt work very well and asked for some stronger pain meds and fever suppresant, but he was like no (and not real nice about it).  In fact his overall demeaner needs some serious improvment.  I WILL NOT be going back there if I can help it.  I learned today that NyQuil is awesome stuff.  I have always heard people say it was good and boy they were right.  So for the moment I am feeling better and hopefully in a couple days it will be all gone.  I have missed two days of work and can't afford to be out anymore.  Nothing else new going on with me at the moment.

      I realized something about myself while I was sick this past weekend.  Well I guess I have kinda known this for a while, but I didn't realize the extent of it till now.  I am a very emotional person.  This may or may not be a suprise to those who know me.  I am sure there are those of my friends who realize that I am very emotional and even know that my emotions can switch in an instant and be extremely intense.  I think the Doc very well could have been right when he said he thought I may be bi-polar.  I am sure I have ADD to a degree as well.  BUT, this is my main revelation ... I control my emotions and mind extremely well ... until I get sick.  I found myself overwhelmed with emotions on several occasions while I was sick.  It took every ounce of control I had left not to cry over stupid things.  I found myself starting to get actually angry (something that almost never happens) when I heard about injustices to my friends.  I mean I always get indignant when I hear about injustice to my friends ... but this was more .. it was a raw anger .. the dangerous kind.  I had to tell my friend to stop talking about it becuase I was afraid I may actually loose my contol over it.  I don't even realize the power of the emotions I have when I am not sick becuase I just keep them solidly under lock and key.  I realize they are there, but I rule them not the other way around.  That resolve and control breaks down more and more the worse I feel.  When I don't feel well it's not the time to joke with me ... not the time to give me a hard time ... not the time to prod me or try to find my limits.  When I am well, it takes extreme things to upset me much and people get used to nothing bothering me.  That is the way I like to be, but sometimes it just happens differently.

      Yeah ok .... I know it's been a long while since I posted.&nbsp; The only thing that has happened recently worth posting about is a phone call I got last Fri night (at least I think that's when it was).&nbsp; It was at 4am so I was really asleep when I got it.&nbsp; Seem that my last X (Richard from atlanta) was moving to greenville this past weekend.&nbsp; He called at 4am to tell me this.&nbsp; Again remember that I am almost completely asleep ... so about all I say is "oh yeah"&nbsp; and maybe "cool".&nbsp; It was clear that I was not thrilled by this info.&nbsp; He kinda lingered on the phone ... I think he was waiting for me to be real excited and happy that he was here now ... it wasn't going to happen.&nbsp; Even now, days and days later, I am still not really sure where I stand on that.&nbsp; I almost want to try to be friends with him but then I kinda want to simply ignore him like he did me.&nbsp; There&nbsp;are no romantic feelings there anymore at all; I have a great b/f and don't need anyone else.&nbsp; hmmm guess since I haven't called him back in this long I won't.&nbsp; If he makes and effort to be friends with me then I will consider it (it's not a certainty); if not then I won't contact him again prolly.&nbsp; oh well it was his loss way back when ....  David is still in Las Vegas.&nbsp; He is not having a good time at all.&nbsp; Seems he isn't learning anything like he thought he would (I could have guessed that would be the case).&nbsp; The guy he is with is being a jerk.&nbsp; And things are generally not good out there with him.&nbsp; But, he will be home Thursday and we can put the trip and that guy behind us becuase he is not worth the trouble or time.  One other thing of note.&nbsp; I have a job interview at Clemson for a full time potision.&nbsp; I have no idea yet how this would affect my school if I got it, but one thing is clear ... I can't go on with no money forever.&nbsp; Keep your fingers crossed that I get it.

      This evening I was extremely tired.&nbsp; After I got home I was trying to watch Batman, but was feeling soooo tired that I didn't even care if it was on or not.&nbsp; So I laid down and fell asleep.&nbsp; It was only about an hour long nap, but that was enough.&nbsp; Now I can't sleep.&nbsp; I know it's a combination of the nap and hyperness about my interview tomorrow.&nbsp; The more I think about it the more I want to get this job.&nbsp; I am almost certain that I will be able to go to school part time still and it will likely be free.&nbsp; If it's free that would be more than great for me.  David comes home tomorrow (thurs [today technically]).&nbsp; I am really looking forward to seeing him.&nbsp; This has been by far the longest we have gone without seeing each other since we met.&nbsp; We have talked some everyday he's been gone tho.&nbsp; I am really missing him and it's obvious that he feels the same.&nbsp; I went to look at the deplex we are thinking about renting today.&nbsp; It's prety nice tho it needs a little TLC.&nbsp; The rooms are spacous and the whole layout is very open.&nbsp; The place would make an interesting house if the two sides were joined together (I got to see both sides of the place).&nbsp; I am anxious to see what comes of that.  I am still playing EQ.&nbsp; It's almost an obsesion, but nothing like it was before.&nbsp; If I could get my friend that I used to play with back on then there would be a lot more that we could do and more fun playing.&nbsp; I refuse to let it consume me like it used to tho.&nbsp; I can walk away from it prety easy now.&nbsp; I barely played any at all today simply becuase I didn't feel like playing.&nbsp; There is also a good chance that we won't have internet for a while when we move (unless I do get this job then everything changes), so if we don't that will force a sabatical (sp?) from EQ anyway.  BLAH .... I need to sleep.  There are a lot of movies that I still want to see.&nbsp; Wish I had the money to go (and someone to go with me).&nbsp; Friday David and I are going to have dinner at my friend's house.&nbsp; Her name is Kristin and I have known her since I was in middleschool.&nbsp; She is a really nice girl and a lot of fun.&nbsp; She could talk a three toed sloth into a stuppor (sp?) tho.&nbsp; I love her to death.&nbsp; She is very open and candid and I like those kind of people.&nbsp; It will be the first "social" event David and I have done together as a couple.  Oh well guess I don't have anything else to say right now.

      Insecurity is an amazing thing.  Just about everyone has it in one area or another.  Take me ... I am very secure in a lot of things.  I know I am fairly intelligent (at least not stupid); I know I am somewhat cute (at least not completely unfortunate looking); I know I am a nice (nice to the point of being walked all over sometimes).  However, I don't feel like I really deserved to be loved sometimes.  I am insecure in that I worry about whoever I am dating leaving me.  The main reason I have come to feel this way is from past experience.  When you have 2 people who claim to love you simply dissapear from your life without so much as a good-bye. when you have person after person be not interested in dating you, when you have boyfriends break up with you for no good reason you beging to wonder what is wrong with you.  Even with David I feel some insecurity.  I know he loves me; I know he wants to be with me; I know he wants to spend his life with me (his words not mine).  I can see the truth of it in his eyes, his actions, his touch.  Yet I can not stop the stupid worry that he will change.  Well .... I know he will change as a person.  Anyone who has lived thru ages 20-25 will say that they changed during those years ... some a LOT (like me) and some maybe just a little, but ALL changed some.  Will David's feeling for me change ... will what he wants in life change ... I don't have the answer to these questions ... he doesn't either ... only God Himslef knows for sure what will happen in the future.  David gets upset at me when I say "I hope" when talking about us.  Like I will say "I hope it works out" and David will say something like "You HOPE?!?"  as if it's an insult that I would say hope instead of I know.  I can't say I know tho becuase I don't ... he doesn't ... we don't ... none of us ... WE DON'T KNOW THE FUTURE ...

      I find the work here at the computer helpdesk on a college campus somewhat disturbing during break.  What concerns me is the smell .... let me explain.  There are no classes right now yet there are still quite a few people here.  Of the people here probably 90% of them are indian (or asian at least).  Of this 90% at least 80% of them stink.  I don't mean stink as in a sweaty smell ... I mean stink and in they havent had a bath in several days and are usuing perfume to cover it up!!  It's very bad and if you think I am exaggerating you should walk through the lab here and see for yourself.  At times it is all I can do to keep from gagging.
