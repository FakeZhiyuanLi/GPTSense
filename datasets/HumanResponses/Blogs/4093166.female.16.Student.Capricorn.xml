      I just got back from a movie.  I went and saw "The Village".  It was ok, I expected to be scary, and it was just cool.  There were a few parts that made you jump, but it was mainly normal.  Who ever wrote it was a good writer.  It had a lot of irony, and the end was full of suprises.  My opinion, if you can, you should go see it.  Today was the first time I have been to the mall in a LONG time.  I saw soo many people I knew, it wasn't even funny.  Half of them I don't like, so I guess that really doesn't matter.  After the mall, we went to a mexican resterant and stuffed myself.  I know that makes you fat, but I didn't care today.  I'm gonna lose weight in band camp anyway.  Ohh, and a BIG HI TO ED!!!!  I know you're going to read this so I figured I would say hi.  Anyway, I need to go burn some calories but it's dark outside, I don't want to get kidnapped, lol.  I guess it would be teennapped now.  Ohh well, I need more people to start readin this so I can have more posts, they're like opening presents.  Lol...  Well, I'm going to go and run around in circles now. L8er, Jami

      Yah, thats right, I am bored again.  I just got finished watching whose line, and I'm watching Mad TV.  I am a comedy freak.  I am kinda happy right now.  I found out that someone I have liked for a long time (that crush) kinda likes me back.  That is soo much better than what I was expecting.  I was expecting to scare him and run him off.  Ohh well, it's a great thing I haven't, although I might before this is all over.  I am a freak... lol...  anyway, I still haven't burned anymore calories.  I beat up my little cousin, but I don't think that did anything.  I am going to be soo bored tomorow.  I am going to be here all day with no where to go and no one to see.  I hope I have a dream tonight, I haven't had one in a while.  I usually have freaky dreams anyway.  I don't want band camp to start, that means my summer is basically over... grr..  I have a question, how old is Bob Barker?  He has to be cryptic now.  He was old in the 70's, lol.  Well, I'm gonna go and hopefully live my life more interesting... Maybe I will post again later, Jami

      Hey again...  I just woke up and it's NOON!  Man I am sooo lazy.  I think it's that teenage thing again.  My aunt tried to wake me up at 8 this morning, but I fell back to sleep.  Anyway, I think I am going to the movies today with my family.  I don't even know what is playing so I have no clue what I am seeing.  OMG  My 9 year old little cousin is running around outside in his underwear.  I think there is something wrong with him...  If you can't tell by now, I don't write in journals or blogs, so this blog probobly stinks.  Ohh, update on that crush thing, he says I didn't ruin anything, but he's still in love.  I can understand that... I know it takes a long time to get over someone you love.  I have been there and done that.  Well, there really isn't anything new to write considering I just woke up.

      Grr, I have a crush on someone, but I can't tell them because they are in love...  Ohh well, I guess that's not the way to start off my VERY FIRST BLOG!!!  I guess I should introduce myself.  I am Jami, I am going to be a junior in high school, and I am a band geek (have been for about 6 years).  I am first chair sax and I am teaching myself piano.  I also am bipolar.  For those who don't know what that is, it's when you have a chemical imbalance in your brain and your moods change uncontrollably.  I can be happy and nice one minute, and the next I look like someone off of the exorcist.  I am trying to controll it, but it's hard, the teenager in me doesn't really help it either.  OO boy, those teenage years, they're killer. LOL  Soo, I guess I'm introduced for now.  I just have to say im a very weird peron, I am an off and on again Wiccan, and I am kinda worried about my sexuality.  Let's put it this way, I know I'm not a lesbian, but i have fantasies... NEWAYZ....  That's not something to talk about on a blog....  I guess I have freaked out over half my audience by now..  So I'll write in here later!!!    Peace and much love,                 Jami

      Hey, I am allready bored again...  I just thought I would post again because that line about my sexuality was misleading...  I am not bi either, I am strait...  I just go crazy every now and then and end up experimenting.  That is it.  Nothing big, don't think that....  I just reread my blog and figured I would clear that up a little...  I do believe the guy I have a crush on knows about my feelings now.  I think I ruined a lot by letting him know, but he insisted.  Anyway, Band camp starts Monday.  WOO HOO!!!  I have to march around in the hot sun for 10 hours everyday for two weeks.  Then school starts.  But at least I'll lose weight and get a tan before school starts back.  Well, I hope someone posts for me... Don't be too bored....,    Jami

      I finally am no longer single.  And it is with someone i really like.  Soo, I am happy in that department.  Last day of band camp was yeaterday and we have all of our show on the field.  I am excited because it is a fun show.  My ex-boyfriends sister had a wreck the other day, she cracked somthing in her neck and is wearing a brace.  As much as I don't like my ex, I'm still friends with her, so I hope she gets better soon.  She flipped the truck 3 times then went end over end 2 times.  I would have been soo scared. Lol.  I have lost weight like I thought I would, so I'm happy in that department also.  All of my burns have went to tans and my ears are healing.  So I guess life is pretty good right now.  Well, I have to go do some chores (yuck).  I'll try to write more later. Jami

        I have been burned, blistered, and I now have sun poison.  I also have freckles!  These things have never happened to me in life.  EVER!  I don't really like them.  Lol...  Anyway, I have my class schedule now.  I am taking child development my first term, driver's ed my second, and I have my favorite teacher for the whole second semester.  I am happy.  I found out that my ex boyfriend lied to me!  I thought I was in love with him (key word, thought) and he dumped me all of a sudden.  Well, I kinda figured it was for another girl because of events I wont talk about on here.  Well, I told him my suspicions, and he denied them.  Well, I found out that every one of my suspicions were and are true.  I think guys are soooo stupid.  They don't think a girl can figure things out.  Lol... No offense to all the guys that read this.  Well, I am hoping to find a respectable guy soon.  I am not desperate, but I am worried all guys suck.  I am very picky on what guys I like...  There are VERY few that I even would date at this point in time...  The ones I have a crush on, either don't know, don't like me, or are takin.  Like the saying goes, "Guys are like parking spaces....  The good ones are takin and all the rest are handicapped"  Lol, I thought that was cute.  Well, I am going to go now.... Peace, Jami
