       all i want to do is sleep today, from the minute i woke up that's all i've felt like doing.&nbsp; must be the weather, so even though i don't drink coffee i figure it's the only thing that might perk me up while i'm sitting here at work. i'm not in the mood to do anything, really - just sit here.&nbsp; i wish i was at home sleeping!!!   oh well, at least i have one more day to come in to work before my boyfriend gets here and i have a 5 day weekend.   i can't fucking wait

       we got there around 9:30 on friday night, set up our tent, had a few drinks and went out to check out the music.&nbsp; i didn't really get into it on friday night, none of the rooms seemed to keep my attention for very long and we ended up going to sleep around 4:30am.   saturday night was different though, it started out a bit slow and i thought it would be a repeat of friday night but then shy fx came on in the jungle room and everything was super.&nbsp; he played a wicked set, had me dancing and basically saved the night for me.&nbsp; freestylers came on next and i've never really gone to any breaks parties and i must say that i do enjoy breaks! they also played a great set and i danced the night away and was very content. lots of crazy, sketchy people - but hey, it's wemf.   very organized and clean and easy to get around.&nbsp;  the weekend took a lot out of me and i don't know how much longer i can do this.&nbsp; i'm thinking maybe this might be the last time, but i think i said last year that i wouldn't go again and i ended up going... so who knows, i'll have to wait another year to see where i'm at in life and if it's something i feel i can do again, i just might.   now i'm looking forward to a 3 day work week and my wonderful boyfriend who will come visit me in 2 days.    &nbsp;  hooray :o)

       the summer is great, but those days when it's humid and gross out are the worst!    work is super slow right now, only 6.5 hours left to go.....    the good thing about blogging while i'm at work is that i can change the colour of my fonts, which i can't do at home.&nbsp; must be because i'm on a mac.    i've pretty much got everything ready for wemf - i still need to get one of those foldy chairs with a built in cup holder though.  tomorrow is going to be a day of rush, rush, rush.&nbsp; i have to get up earlier than usual to be at work for 8 am.&nbsp; after work i swing by the liquor store and then go home to get changed and ready to go.&nbsp;    i hope it's a fun weekend.

      i'm looking forward to the next 2 weekends! this entire week i've been planning my adventure to wemf. i want to be well equiped and prepared and bring with me the bear minimum.  last year was my first time going, and it was total crap due to the fact that they had problems and had to change the location at the last minute. i'm not going to let my first exeperience stop me from trying it again.  this year's location looks promising, with a beach and water park nearby. i'm very excited :o) i'm leaving friday evening and coming back on sunday, only to return to a 3 day work week because i took thursday + friday off. which brings me to next weekend! matthew is flying up here wednesday night and staying until monday.  really excited for that! we haven't seen eachother since march! that also happens to be a long weekend so i have monday off.  the next 2 weeks are going to be grrreat!!! i can't wait to just be able to chill out with him and take him around the city, i want to go to the islands for a pic nic! plus it's caribana, i'm not really into that whole scene, but it might be something fun and different to do. we'll just end up shopping, and eating and having sex :oD i always feel like i'm on vacation when he's here, we get along so well.  he's by far the best boyfriend i could ever ask for.  we both consider it a very wonderful thing that we found eachother. love is a wonderful thing :o)  i'm going to be giddy for the next 2 weeks!!!

      no surprise to me, i've always known that and so has she, i don't know why she acts shocked about it whenever something happens. even as a kid i've always had a lot sarcasm in me and an i don't really give a shit attitude. meh i haven't changed much in that sense, even now at 25. the way i see it, if i'm still pretty much the same about a lot of things from when i was younger [my sometimes bad attitude, the fact that i pretty much hate dressing like a girl]then this is the way i am and i'm going to be.  there's no sense in me, or other people for that matter, trying to make me something i'm not. i can't explain why i'm like this, i just am.  in the same way that everbody else is who they are. i'm not like most girls, and i'm fine with that.  fuck what anybody says

       i'm done work in about 2 hours and then the weekend starts....&nbsp; i don't plan on doing much this evening, seeing as i'll get home by 10pm. i know i said i wasn't going to do anymore shopping, BUT there's a clothing sample sale going on this weekend and i'm pretty sure i'm going to go.&nbsp; more clothes won't hurt, plus someone told me the prices are really good and i can probably find a birthday present for my friend jasmine there.   my plan is to wake up relatively early tomorrow... hit the gym and then head downtown for the sale.    &nbsp;  sounds good!

      thank god it's *almost* friday,  it's the second best day after friday!  i got paid today, however i did have a few bills that i needed to take care so i won't be doing any crazy spending in the next couple of weeks.  i also did a little bit of shopping a couple of days ago so i figure i should cool it for a while... easier said than done though!  i'm going to stay in on friday night and save my energy, money and brain cells so that i can go out saturday for my friend jasmine's birthday.  next weekend is wemf, which will [hopefully] be a lot of fun and maybe a little bit crazy ;oP  and the weekend after that my boyfriend is coming to visit me for a few days. we haven't actually seen eachother since march [but if you want to get technical we see and talk to eachother almost every day with our webcams]   so lots of stuff to look forward to in the next couple of weeks! &nbsp; oh, and i didn't go to the gym but i did do pilates so i don't feel like such lazy fat ass :oD

      happy hump day i probably should have gone to the gym this morning, but since i had to get up early on monday and tuesday for appointments i decided to let myself sleep in a little. thursday and friday morning i have no excuses, so off to the gym i will go. i got up at my liesure and began my day in a relaxing day with one of my favourite things to do  *wink* *wink* the fact that i got some new pants makes me feel just a little bit better about going to work  :oP

      another sort of slow day at work today... meh and it's only tuesday!!!  i did have a decent weekend though.  kenny ken on friday was a lot of fun, and my friend anthony had a good time which is a plus.  lately he's been feeling sort of blah and not enjoying 'parties'.  we have been attending a lot dnb / jungle parties and i think he's just getting a little sick of them, but whatever.... i myself have been feeling a little 'blah' these last couple of days, but that usually happens around this time of the month.  i get all weird about a lot of things and i can get pretty fucking irritable!  i start to hate the way clothes look on me, and how i need to find my ideal dream job where i'm doing something cool and dressing in my normal clothes. i had somet time to kill before work today and i ended up spending almost $200 at the mall! but i actually did need some new clothes as i was getting really sick of my current wardrobe.... had to change it up a bit. i think i still need to get some more stuff, but for now i managed to get 4 pairs of pants, some hello kitty underwear and a camo watch ['cause i love anything with camo on it] i figure i get paid in 2 days and it's not like i can't afford it!  hopefully this work day will fly by like it did yesterday.... and the same goes for the week in general!

      thats right, friday is finally here hopefully my day at work will pass by quickly and with much ease...  after work i will rush home to shower and get changed and then head down to theory at the koolhaus for some kenny 'superhero' ken. as for the rest of my weekend...not sure.  my friend ana bela will be in town and i haven't seen her in a while, so it would be nice to hang out with her.  i'm going to call her and see if she wants to go to the toronto electronic music festival happening at harbourfront this weekend. sunday means i have to work at my part time job...and then it's the start of another work week  crap

      thursdays are good days, because they are the day before friday... and that means the weekend is almost here.  ever since i started working full time i have never looked forward to the weekends so much.  i'm actually at work right now, sitting in my semi-cubicle type thingy and it's not very busy so what a perfect time to de-stress between my internet surfing and message board posting! work is not a bad place, at all... it's just not a fun place.  it's not a place where i come in and think 'i'm doing something really cool' - and that's how i would like to feel.  i realized not everyone is fortunate enough to feel this way about their work, and i'm thankful that i at least have a job.  well i actually have two jobs, one part time and one full time so maybe i'm luckier than most. i don't mind doing this for now, as it is a means to an end and without it i would be pretty fucking screwed. my work days aren't very stressful in any way [sometimes a little bit, but nothing i can't handle] and i get through the week knowing that there's a weekend waiting for me at the end. this friday i'm going to see kenny ken and dieselboy, what better way to end the work week than with some jungle, drinks and weed!

      so i created this blog because i've always loved writing what i'm feeling down and i feel like it's a good way of dealing with things.  i don't do this enough though and i feel like this blog will help me with a lot of things.  the creation of this blog is for various reasons, but i would say the main reason is so that it can help me reach my goals by writing all my thoughts and feelings down. my issues are quite simple, really.  i feel like i have a very good life, i'm still young and ambitious.  i live at home and i'm aiming to get my own place in about a year or so.  i met the love of my life 2 years ago and we're very happy [even though we live in different countries]and we see a great future together.  i just recently started a full time job with a decent company that seems to treat its employees pretty well and it is what i needed to move forward with my life and eventually move out of my parent's home.  but here's the thing....  until very recently i was at a period of transition in my life, having finished post secondary education and faced with finding a full time job as my next step.   i studied graphic design for 3 years and i realized just how much fun school could be. then it ended. my entire life i had been told what to do and all of a sudden i was supposed to convince people in 'the real world' [as my profs. would always call it] that i was the shit.  yeah, ok. at that point i was considering staying in school for a little longer, in reality i was scared of 'the real world'.  i didn't though, i worked my part time job 6 days a week for 2 years while looking for a job in the field in the meantime.  mind you i wasn't being very agressive with my searching and applying... but for some fucked up reason i thought it just *might* be easy.   so after 2 years of searching i decided that i would have to start some sort of full time job, regardless of wether it was graphic design related or not. so here i am, not completely unhappy in any way - i just think it's important for one to do what they enjoy doing and even though i'm not working in my field at the very moment... i still haven't lost hope that one day i might be.  along with other things that are floating around in my mind....i hope to use this blog as a tool to further my dreams... as silly as that my sound!

       i've been trying to log into my blogger account for a few days now and i finally got in.... it's not that big of a deal, but when you're at work and there's not that much work to do, blogging is always good. my last 2 or so weeks have been pretty good - i've been excercising almost every day - i've been going swimming 3-4 times a week with my mom at the community centre and going to the gym and doing pilates on the days i don't swim. i really enjoy swimming more than anything though, it's so relaxing and even though i have to wake up at 6:45 it wakes me up and i feel really great afterwards.  i've also been eating better, not that my eating habits were very bad to begin with, but i want to make it a point to eat more fruits and veggies than i normally do, as well as cut down on the carbs. work is going ok, the last 2 weeks they have made thursday + friday 'jeans day' and even though it's not a big deal i really enjoy going to work in jeans + running shoes! i just wish it was like that everyday...  but it won't until i find my dream job, whatever that may be.   my friend anthony from college gave me a call, i hadn't seen or spoken to him in a little while - we're finally getting together for lunch on thursday, which is cool.  he just came back from being in europe for 3 weeks with his boyfriend and he's always got crazy stories of his escapades...      looking forward to the weekend, as i always do.  it's my parents' anniversary and they're going away for the night on saturday.  there's a free outdoor hip hop festival that i'm going to and then my work is having a free boat cruise [with food and 3 free drinks - alcoholic of course- included!], so my other friend anthony [the one i work with] is going to accompany me.      now it's back to work for me....

       so this week is turning out to be a good one.  despite that my vacation is over and my boyfriend is back in new york i'm in good spirits anyways.  since monday was a holiday this week is going by faster than it would normally [bonus], i managed to get to the gym early yesterday morning and i woke up again today and went swimming with my mum - it was our first time going and we both swam the length of the pool 20 times.  i actually really enjoyed it and i love the idea of doing it maybe 3 times a week!  hopefully my mom will be able to wake up with me but after going once now i think i would even feel comfortable going on my own. when i got in to work today i checked my e-mail and discovered that the company will be ordering lunch on thursday AND friday - not only that, it's casual day on both those days and i can wear jeans and running shoes to work!  i fucking LOVE it.   the rest of my work week will be just that much easier because of those things....

       so yeah, here i am back at work on tuesday afternoon after being off since last wednesday evening.... i wish the weekends were always long! 2 days just isn't enough and i firmly believe the weekend should be at least 3 days in length. i got my week off to a good start, i woke up early and went to the gym today and it felt really good.  i would really like to get into the habit of doing this a couple of times a week, mainly tuesdays and thursdays and then go to the pool mondays, wednesdays and fridays with my mum.  this way i will be getting some physical activity 5 days out of 7.  i will be really happy if i can do this. i called matt to make sure he got home ok last night, his flight actually only left 20 min. after it was supposed to [ that's pretty fucking good for jetsgo] and i was really glad he was able to come visit me here.  i suppose it will be my turn next time, and with both jetsgo and westjet flying to laguardia after sept. 20th i think it will be easier and faster than taking the bus. i'm guessing i'll be going there maybe sometime in the winter, when i have a long weekend or something.....   i've also started to think again about what it is that i'm supposed to be doing, and i figured that it probably wouldn't happen for a little while.  even though i'm not completely excited about work i still feel that it's not bad compared to the alternative [dominion] and that i'll have to stick this out for at least maybe a year or so until i've got a better idea of things...  i think i need this stability and increase in income so that i can finally move out and get my own place... and i think then i might better be prepared to plan and execute things.  what  things? i don't know yet... but that's ok because i have time to think about it.  i'm hoping that somehow, somewhere it will come to me... like an epiphany
