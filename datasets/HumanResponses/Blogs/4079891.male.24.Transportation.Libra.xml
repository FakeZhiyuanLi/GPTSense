      In a country where I decided I didn't need to vote for the past six years I finally registered.&nbsp; Yup I know, people have died and fought and suffered for their right to vote.&nbsp;&nbsp; However I have never fought, or died, or suffered.&nbsp; I have been content as a clam my whole life.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I turned 18 and the first chance to punch the card came and went I didn't lose a wink.&nbsp; I wasn't going to vote until I felt like I needed to...makes sense to me.&nbsp; So, in a time where our current leader seems most unpopular and even though, to be very honest,&nbsp;&nbsp;I am still (personally) happy as a clam, I have registered and plan to vote.&nbsp;&nbsp; The main reason is because I think the Bush family doesn't need any more power then they've had for the past 15+ years.&nbsp; I will vote for John Kerry.&nbsp; I&nbsp; don't love him, but I don't hate him either.&nbsp; Now that I'm register and getting all amped up to punch the card there faces another big problem.&nbsp; Can someone please tell me how in the world&nbsp; a vote using the electoral college system is fair to anyone?&nbsp; I've been racking my mind for the past few hours and cant decide whether it is just fear of change or plain stupidity.&nbsp; It really makes me feel as if my vote is completely unimportant in a state where we will no devotedly vote democrat.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think ill skip it, the vote that is.&nbsp; It's my own little protest.&nbsp; Anyways that's it for now.&nbsp; Sometimes I feel like I'm living in crazy world.&nbsp; More to come about the complete idiocy of the California worker compensation small business situation. I might even add some bits and pieces of my daily life, family, girlfriend, dog, car, and work!! Like you care!

      I am an uncle to an adorable baby girl.&nbsp; She was born on July, 14, 2004 at a perfect 7.3 lbs.&nbsp; First one of the next generation for our family.&nbsp; She is such a little cutie I can't believe it.&nbsp; I will get some picture very soon so everyone can see.&nbsp; I am going to be her favorite uncle.&nbsp; I just can't wait until she gets to be toy age so I can spoil her silly.&nbsp; Mom and Dad are doing well.&nbsp; I'm sure they are a little sleep deprived and a little nervous about their first child but they are obviously ready and ecstatic with the new delivery.&nbsp; I held her for the first time today.&nbsp; It was fun, and I didn't even drop her.&nbsp; I know it sounds bad but I was nervous...

      Of all the different foreign polices in the United States during my lifetime the one that stood out to me the most was introduced by a great man. President Ronald Reagans policy toward the Soviet Union in those three simple words is to me a very interesting concept. Even though it seems to me that most of the people in my life haven't really lived their lives to the rule, I think I have. Its so beautifully oximoronic and hypocritical that it makes me wonder why it worked so well for Mr. Reagan and not for me. For me it raises uncertainty in things that should feel safe and secure. It makes me doubt what I should know as truth. It makes me wonder if I was ever even better off knowing the things I knew or didn't know. How can one truly trust and still have the urge to verify? I think to be perfectly honest it is much like a knock off Louise Louise Viutton purse. Looks real from the outside but in truth a cheap imitation on the inside. Is it a lack of trust in oneself that produces a lack of trust in you by others? I will work to trust and not verify because without faith in humans where are we really? Can you ever relax and be at peace when you have to keep one eye open and over your shoulder at all times?   MR

      Lately I have been a machine. A cheating machine but non the less a machine.  I have been trying desperatly to get back into shape at no avail.  Seems like every year or so I will work out and work out and workout and get down to about 180 lbs from my normal lazy 195.  After I do this I get lazy again and sit around my way back up to 195-200.  Its an endless cycle of defeat and I feel like I have had enough.  I am just going to be an athletic person from this point on.  I have quit smoking which was an off and on dirty habit for about 4-5 years.  I have been running 2-3 miles 4 times a week lately and eating healthy (this is where the cheating comes in) .  I cant shed a pound and its driving me nuts.  This week I have decided to begin cross training.  Inspired by the olympics I am going to start swimming and jogging alternatly throughout the week.  I will combine this workout with a very healthy diet (no cheating) and see what happens.  I want ripped abs.  Is that so much to ask...?  Apparently it takes a lot of work.  Im up for it.

      So I did something which I would call unusual for me. About a month ago I heard tickets were for sale for a Country music show at the Mid-State fair. Tim McGraw was going to perform for 10,000 cowboys and girls up just north of San Luis Obispo in Paso Robles. I knew Annie loved the music of Mr McGraw and I am basically forced to listen to it nearly everytime we are in the car so I called up and got tickets. Country music is not really my thing, never has been but I decided why not. Lets try it, see what happens. Lets open up my so called little box and peek over the edge and see what else is out there. So the day came. We got in the car, made the two hour drive, fought for parking, looked at cows (it was the Mid-State fair of course) and saw a country concert. It was pretty cool. I was surprised. I actually knew a lot of the songs which made me feel a little hick but I was down to mosey. I yelled yeehaw a couple times, wore the tightest jeans I owned and even sported a cowboy hat. It wasn't a Stetson but it worked to keep the sun off my neck. It was a hoedown. It was fun. I would do it again. In fact, I would recommend to anyone who dislikes country music, rock music, opera music, gothic music, rap music or any other genre of anything to check it out before you make up your mind. So many things out there. It really goes back to what you don't know that you don't know. More on that subject later.  Mikey
