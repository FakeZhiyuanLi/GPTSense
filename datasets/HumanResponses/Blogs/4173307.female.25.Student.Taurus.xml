        Yesterday I went to the hospital i will be working at and did some processing paperwork and immunization/drug screenings. I am assessing the PPD on my left forearm and i am happy to say...i dont have tuberculosis =). But I still have to get it read tomorrow.

       So i got my test results the other day, and I am sad to say I did not pass my board examination.  It's okay, I'm okay.  I'll just have to take another one in a month and a half...at least i don't have to wait 3 months or a year!  So anyway, I went to Barnes and Noble last night and I just couldn't push myself to study.  I went to the nursing section and found this really great book for the NCLEX-RN!!  It was just what I was looking for! I skimmed through it and thought it covered exactly what I needed to know!  I hope it will help me pass this time.        I spoke to my fiance last night longer than we usually get to.  I am so happy!!  I love him so much.  Gawd, do I love him!! He is the best!  Everytime i think about him and our future together I get all soft and girlie like...it's like being in love for the very first time.  I get butterflies just thinking about the next time I get to see/touch him.  I have to wait a couple more weeks, and I will be in Washington again!  woo hoo!! I cannot wait.  Oh yeah, we are going to go to Canada this time.  I hope it's cold enough to wear winter clothes.  Well, any place but here is cold to me...im from Florida (i get cold easily)!      Ok, the end.  i am going to the mall now.

        i am so bored right now. i rented "legally blonde 2", but im waiting for my fiance to call before i watch it. he's in military school right now and we only get to talk for 5--10 minutes every night (for a month). sucks huh? i get to see him at the end of the month though. im going to a military ball!! woo hoo...i get to wear a formal dress. i bought 2. one is black and pink and the other is black and white. i dunno which one to wear!! he will have to choose for me. i get to model them for him =)      ok, so im waiting for my test results for the RN board exam and its killin me!! i hate waiting like this. hopefully by the end of tomorrow i will know if i passed...and IF i passed...WE ARE GONNA PARTY! ok the end.
