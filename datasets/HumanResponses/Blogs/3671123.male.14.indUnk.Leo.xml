      According to a wage gap study released last month by the U.S. Census Bureau,Experts do not dispute that a wage gap persists: A comparison of 1999 median salaries showed earnings of $110,000 for male dentists and $68,000 for female dentists; $70,000 for male pharmacists and $63,000 for female pharmacists; $17,000 for male cooks and $15,000 for female cooks; $20,000 for male teacher assistants and $15,000 for female teacher assistants. Wal-Mart is even worse with men making 9 dollars to every seven dollars that his female counterpart makes. This is not just outrageous its illegal. According to a recent  urlLink article  by the Beacon Journal, when women ask for training to become managers, they often times get turned down and told that they dont need to know how to become a manager. Finally there is a lawsuit against wal-mart and not only will it hurt wal-mart but possibly spark similar debates and lawsuits across the country, but only if women win the lawsuit. Please feel free to post your comment.

      Today the Socialist Worker online published three excellent  urlLink articles  on wal-mart. The first article is just about the many problems that wal-mart employees are facing. The second article is asking "can wal-mart be unionized" and the third article is a story of Rosetta Brown and how wal-mart has basically ruined her life. These articles are a must read. But I dont think that wal-mart could ever be unionized, which is why we have to stop it, now. Please post what you think.

      Here's a  urlLink report  on the biggest class-action lawsuit ever. Great news! The federal judge has now just ruled that 1.6 million former and current female workers can sue wal-mart for sex discrimination making this the largest class-action lawsuit on record. This will probably hurt sales at wal-mart, and popularize wal-marts already bad public appearance. There is also a  urlLink soundclip  from npr that you can listen to.

      I just read this article and thought that it is a very good and well written article about the struggles that unions face when battling wal-mart. But what I am thinking for this problem is that the unions have to band together to fight wal-mart. I think that if this doesnt happen soon then there is a very high chance that wal-mart could drive all the unions out of the retail businesses. Please voice your opinion on this problem facing unions.  See this recent article in  urlLink The Nation .

      According to CNN's recent  urlLink article  "Anti-Wal-Mart ordinance in LA", The LA city council is backing up an ordinance to ban all stores larger than 100,000 sq. feet! There have been numerous protests and strikes in that area when wal-mart was introduced by Grocery workers which has influenced this new ordinance. Hopefully other cities will agree and follow through with this ordinance. Please feel free to comment.

      According to the Cinncinatti Enquirer's article " urlLink Kroger tilts with non-union giants ", Kroger is being forced to stop being unionized due to pressure with wal-mart. All because of wal-mart there are so few places to shop and feel good about nowadays. What with how they take away local businesses and force other big businessses to stop being unionized.
