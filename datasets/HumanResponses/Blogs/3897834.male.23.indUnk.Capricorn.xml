      So in this brief entry, I thought I'd share some interesting geographical and historical facts about Hawaii, the first stop of our conference.  You might be surprised to learn that the Hawaiian islands are a chain of underwater volcanoes, where the volcano tips stick out of the water. Here's an illustration of the island Kauai, so you can see how 95% of it is underwater.      Next is a picture of the whole volcano chain. If you look closely, you can see how the tips of certain underwater volcanoes stick out of the water, forming the islands.     And one more overview...      As for some basic history, Hawaii is a chain of South Pacific Islands that was originally discovered and inhabited by Polynesian explorers. Although no one knows exactly when these explorers got here, most estimates are around 500 AD.  In a second wave of exploration, the Tahitians (people of Tahiti) stumbled upon Hawaii and brought their royal hierarchy with them. As a result, for the next several hundred years, Hawaii's islands were ruled by Kings.  Captain Cook - the great explorer of the British Navy - showed up in Hawaii in 1778. Although he was later killed (and possibly even eaten) on the islands in 1779, Cook intiated the relationship between Hawaii and the West.   In 1835, sugar plantations started springing up all over Hawaii and by the end of the 19th century, US business men had overtaken much of Hawaii's land. Hawaii established its first constitution in 1840 and by 1848 feudalism was abolished. Beginning in 1850, foreign labors were hired from Asia and Europe - in particular China, Japan, the Phillipines and Portugal - to work on the booming sugar industry. These foreign laborers contributed to the islands' fabulous ethnic diversity.  In 1875, the US and Hawaii signed a Treaty of Reciprocity, but only 15 years later, the US annexed Hawaii depite dissent from Hawaiian residents.  In the early 20th century, Hawaii became a giant producer of pineapples, and today it supplies 1/3 of production around the world.  On December 7th, 1941, Pearl Harbor was fatefully attacked by the Imperial Army of Japan. The attack resulted in 2,500 American deaths and gave Japan a strategic edge in the war. The US declared war on Japan the next day.  In 1959, Hawaii became the 50th US State.

      Welcome to my JASC blog where I will be sharing some pics, stories and thoughts for the coming month. Recently, I began my 30 days of travel with a 3 day visit to the Hawaiian island Kauai, which in short, is absolutely breathtaking. I begin with my arrival at my hostel-  [Upon arriving at my hostel in Kauai and greeting the owner]  Me:  "Wow. How does anyone get anything done around here?"  Hostel owner:  "Well, we dont."  Indeed the man spoke the truth. During my few days on Kauai, I witnessed (and experienced) the laid-back lifestyle that largely defines our 50th state (as of 1959), and found that though the residents of Kauai are not busy backsoons, they are happy, hospitable Americans who live very very well. Here's the view from my hostel-       Anyway, as for Kauai in particular, the island contains about 55,000 people, most of whom live in small town scattered along the West coast. The geography is stunning and lends itself well to movies, having been shot in both Jurassic Park and the less memorable Seven Days and Seven Nights.  I began my exploration of the island with a killer 1hr. helicopter tour. (Mom, I owe you for this one). Although I was hesitant to take the tour at first, I found it to be well worth the money since the helicopter affords unbelievable views of river valleys, canyons, and waterfalls that are otherwise unreachable by foot or car. If you don't believe me, check some of these pics I took from the air-                   Next, I explored the island on foot and by car, but mostly the latter. Since I was short on time, I only hit the main spots, which were Waimea Canyon, Kei'ei Beach and Wailua Falls. I list some pics below, but first I feel like I would like to introduce my hot rental car, Bertha. A 1989 Plymouth Sundance, Bertha got me where I needed to go without stalling too often. Here she is-    Isn't she pretty?  Anyway, here are some of the places she got me to...    Sunset from the first post of the Kalalau Trail    Wailua Falls    Wailua Falls (after hiking down to the bottom)    Swimming in the falls  Let's see...what else? In town, there is no metered parking, minimumn internet fees of $5, and a very very competitve gas price...ouch!     Here's a pic from the very cool coffee plantation I visited. The product, Kauai Coffee is available on the mainland, and if you're into flavored coffees, I think you'll dig it.     And a random mailbox in the middle of nowhere...    My current booklist consists of The Wisdom of Crowds (by James Surowiecki) and A Short History of Nearly Everything (by Bill Bryson). Both are great, but I am finding the former especially interesting...check it out if you are interested in group dynamics and the power of collective thought.  Anyway, that's it for the first post. Tomorrow I'm headed to Oahu where I will be meeting up with the other JASCers (the other 39 American delegates on my confererence). I promise to give more updates soon, as well as some background and history on the Hawaiian Islands.   Nite nite, Nick

      Last week we visited the American military base at Pearl Harbor, and as expected, our experience was both educational and emotional.  My first impression of Pearl Harbor was quite different from what I had imagined. For some reason, I had always envisioned it as a beautiful port showcasing Hawaii's natural splendor -- not an estranged military base resting in a world outside of Hawaii. The base reminded me of the US navy and airforce bases I once visited in Okinawa, Japan.  The day began with a briefing from one of the Navy Commanders, who gave us a 1hr. talk on US national security and US navy operations around the world. I found the talk informative and fascinating, especially because the Commander discussed the growing importance of Asia in the 21st century and how Navy will have to shape its policy to address the changing security issues. The talk was aboard the USS Missouri, which was the last battleship ever built by the US. (*we no longer make battleships because they are not economically or militarily efficient. today's attack ships are much smaller).  While aboard the Missouri, we also had a tour of the control room, barricks and deck. This experience was phenomenal. We saw the American flag that Commodore Perry flew while sailing to Japan (in 1854) as well as the Japanese surrender document that ended WWII. Just think -- after decades of war and a death toll of over 50 million lives, WWII came to an end in the exact spot we ended our tour. Indeed, it was here that the Japanese heads of state met Gen. MacArthur for a 20 min. ceremony of defeat.  We concluded the afternoon with a somber visit to the USS Arizona memorial, which is located about 20min. by boat from the USS Missouri. For those who don't know, the Arizona was sunk by the Japanese and about 1200 Americans went down with ship. After taking a motor boat the memorial, we walked around for a little while and payed our respects to soldiers who were sacrificed. Their names are beautifully engraved in a white stone wall and the entire structure of the memorial floats above the sunken ship. Gazing down into the water from the memorial, I could see parts of the ship sticking out from the water and oil from the fuel tanks leaking to the water's surface. It was an eerie sight, but a poignant one.  None of the bodies, were recovered and today it remains an underwater graveyard.  Here are some facts concerning the devastation we experienced at Pearl Harbor:  -about 2,500 lives, + numerous casualties -3 battles ships including the USS Arizona, the USS Oklahoma, and the USS Utah. (the latter two were retrieved for their steel) -the attack was particularly devastating because it occurred on a Saturday morning, when the soldiers were allowed to sleep in late.  We heard many courageous stories that went on during the attack, but what I found particularly heartfelt was the loyalty that the crewmen showed to their ships (let alone the country). According to the Commander, the crewmen considered themselves less important than the ships they worked on. When the ships went down, the crew fought to the end and sacrificed their lives to keep the ships above water.  In essence, some soldiers died out of choice and out of loyalty to their ships.

      Following our trip to Pearl Harbor, we split up into small groups and shared our some of our feelings (as we usually do after field trips). Most of the conversations centered around the sadness we felt while visiting the US Arizona Memorial, but some also addressed the history of Pearl Harbor and how such history could help us understand the grave threats we face in the world today. Of particular interest to me here was the comparison between Pearl Harbor and the 9/11 attacks. Though many people tend to equate the two and focus on their similarities, my opinion is that they are fundamentally different, having little in common except a high cost of life -- 3,000 innocent lives. Let me explain-  The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941was a strategic move with one driving purpose -- to draw the US into war and inflict as much damage as possible to the US military. This was not the first time the Japanese had employed such a surprise attack on a foreign power. They surprise attacked Russia in 1904 and incited the Russo-Japanese over Manchuria and ironically, the US gov't supported them. As for effectiveness of the attack, Pearl Harbor was devastating. Within a few hours, the Imperial Army killed 3,000 Americans, sank 3 major battle ships, and secured an upperhand in the war for Japan. But that was only Pearl Harbor. One should keep in mind that on the morning of December 7th, the Japanese also attacked US military bases in Guam, the Phillipines, Malaya, and Hong Kong. What we can tell from this is that Japan had a well-thought out strategy that was designed to give them a headstart in a war that was sure to last no more than two years (both sides estimated that Japan only had enough resources to fight for two years). Their motives were were rooted in decades of economic and political tension with the US, and their attack was not an irrational act of brutality, but a brutal act of war (allthough undeclared).   The 9/11 attack differs from this Japanese attack in a number of fundamental aspects. For one, the hijackers/attackers of the planes did not represent a global imperialist power that challenged US economic interests. They represented terrorist cells who have goals of pushing Western influence out of the Middle East and installing radical Islamic governments no matter what the cost. Such a different goal is evident in the fact that they targeted the US civilians (not army personell) and the WTC (not miltary bases).By going after the common people and attacking our way of life, these islamic militants are hoping to instill fear within the entire country while remaining highly elusive.  The next crucial difference between Pearl Harbor and 9/11 is that Pearl Harbor was not an attack on American soil, while 9/11 was. Keep in mind that Hawaii did not become a US state until 1959 and for the first 40 years of the 20th century it was an annexed US protectorate (1898). It might be hard to imagine these days, but In 1941, Hawaii was not even close to becoming a state. The majority of Hawaiians still opposed to a US presence in the islands and most Americans on the mainland opposed making Hawaii part of the US for (mostly) racial reasons.  So, why does all this matter? Because understanding how the Japanese attack of 1941 is different from the 9/11 attack is crucial to ensuring our national security right now. (Same goes with understanding the very different nature of the US occupation of Japan from 1945-52 and that of Iraq now). Undoubtedly, different types of threats require different types of foreign policies and in my opinion, blurring the important facts keeps us from effectively addressing such threats. One thought comes to mind: although brutal, the Japanese Imperial Army did not aim to destroy innocent US civilians as a war goal in and of itself. They were determined to maintain and exploit their colonies in SE Asia, even if that meant confronting a much larger economic power such as the US. Islamic militants like Bin Laden, in contrast, are out to destroy Americans and the American way of life as a primary war goal, and they will continue to do so until their voices are heard. I consider today's threat far more severe considering WMD are more easily obtained and there is no clear enemy or war end in sight.

      Hey there-  Having experienced a week of JASC now, I am able to reflect and share. In short, things are fantastic, and I am having a ridiculously good time. It's thrilling to be surrounded by bright, motivated individuals who enjoy discussing issues during the day and chilling at night. And it's particularly special to have half of these students from Japan, where there exist alternative perspectives and alternative drinking games.   For those who are interested, I thought I would give some background on the Japan-America Student Conference (www.jasc.org). What is it? How did it begin? Let's do this in note form.  (As for those who are not interested in JASC background, please close this window right now. It is your last chance.)  -JASC was started in 1934 by a bunch of Japanese students who were concerned about the worsening relations between the US and Japan  -The purpose of JASC is to bring 40 Japanese students and 40 American students together for one month. These students travel around Japan or the US together (it alternates every year; this year it's in the States), conducting daily discussions, making field trips, attending lectures, and going out at night.  -Although the Confererence is primarily concerned with maintaining strong US-Japanese relations, it also strives to define the type of role these two economic superpowers should play in the world.  -The Conference was suspended during WWII, but resumed after.  -The Conference is entirely student organized, and thus, we have no adults with us. Wait, I guess I'm supposed to be an adult by now. Scratch that.

      Last week we attended an interesting talk about what happened to thousands of Japanese citizens who were in the States upon the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941. I'll try to keep this short, but let me quickly summarize things for those who have not heard of the camps:   Immediately following Pearl Harbor and the death of over 2,000 American military personnel, the State Dept took action to capture and detain 120,000 Issei (1st generation) and Nissei (2nd generation) Japanese, putting them into internment camps all around the continental US and off the coast of the Hawaiian island Oahu. The rational behind the racist policy was that all Japanese living in the States - regardless of background - posed a threat to US national securtiy. The state dept. had convinced themselves that "democratic institutions were incompatible with the Japanese philosophy" and thus, all Japanese living in the US had to be taken out of the system.  While the government was largely targeting Japanese citizens rather than US-Japanese citizens, the majority of these detainees were hardworking laborers in Hawaii and California who had lived in the US for years and even decades with their American-born children and wives. They did not and could not obtain US citizenship due to the 1924 Exclusion Act - (a law which imposed quotas on  the number of specific immigrant groups and all together denied citizenship to Japanese immigrants) - and thus were doomed to live permanently as "alien residents." These detainees were trapped by US law with no chance to defend themselves. They were stripped from their families (along with the Nissei) and sent to live in concentration camps for 3-4 years. Concentration camps? Wasn't that Nazi Germany? Well, we unfortunately had a few of our own, and even ones with barbed-wire fences.  The story goes on, but I'll leave it by noting that these Japanese internees finally gained the chance to apply for citizenship in 1952, the presidential commission finally concluded in 1981 that the camps were "not justified by military necessity..." and the survivors of the camps finally received some sort of compensation ($20,000) in 1988.   I think the important point to take away from this historical injustice is how easily major civil rights violations and blatant racism can be disguised beneath the rhetoric of national security. 50 years after the fact, we can more objectively evaluate our domestic policy toward residents of Japanese ethnicity and wonder: why didn't the 250,000 or so German aliens living in the US during WWII ever receive such comparable treatment? Surely, the answer is racism. Even the US military commander in California during WWII, General DeWitt , made this clear by justifying the camps with: "A Jap's a Jap -- it makes no difference whether he is an American citizen or not."   Though it is less likely that large-scale historical unjustices such as the Japanese internment camps would occur in the modern era, we still face issues of national security and civil rights. Take, for example, the Patriot Act. While it won't imprison as many as 120,000 residents/citizens without the right to an attorney, it rests upon some of the same "rights of state" that caused the Japanese internment camps. This is very troublesome...Thoughts?
