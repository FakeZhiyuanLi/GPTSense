       Isn't it amazing how one email/phone call/conversation can change the tone of your entire today? My mood fluctuations never cease to surprise me. Really, it's an art form…being moody. I think I'm just very easily influenced by my environment. Maybe it's part of being a Pisces. I should go read up on that. Because I know I'm stereotypical Pisces - just can't quite remember what that entails.   Moving date is set for August 13th - I can barely stand it. I just want to go NOW. I made a spreadsheet of everything that I owned in the hopes of jarring my memory and recalling what I have in storage. I only remember the dumb things like: tennis racquet, fireplace candleabra, breadmaker. Unpacking will be so fun! Almost like unwrapping gifts, not knowing what's in that beautiful piece of newspaper wrapping. Sigh.   I'm really unhappy with my career. I've just lost all motivation to be on the corporate ladder climbing track. It would be so much easier to jump off it if it didn't finance my lifestyle so well. However, I'm seriously debating a complete career change. I need to sit on it for about 6 months and make sure it's what I really want to do….but since no one will pay me to sit around and write all day (...yet. ha.) then I need to find an interim occupation. My sister always has these "I help make the world a better place" jobs that make me feel like dung, so maybe I should look into the non-profit area. Except that also involves sitting at a desk a lot of the time, and I'm just really, really tired of that - and it's only been 5 years. Am considering a) pharmaceutical sales, except I'm not really sold yet on joining an industry with such stereotypes. But I love hospitals and doctors and drugs. Legal, of course. b)  Automotive sales consulting - specifically internet sales tactics   c) Teaching.   See. I'm just all over the place. Suggestions/feedback welcome. sigh.

       Lots to discuss today.   First and foremost: tonight's plans. It's my sister's bachelorette party, and I have to admit that I have mixed feelings about it. I just have a gut feeling that I'll be doing some serious babysitting at some point. As long as I don't see/smell/hear vomiting, I'll be ok. I'm getting too old for this crap. But we'll be on  urlLink this  , and it's bound to be entertaining as hell. Jello shots are involved. Again...way too old for this.   Secondly, but not second in importance, one of my high school girls is in town this weekend and we get to play tomorrow night. I'm so excited! This coupled with my trip up to Minneapolis in two weeks has me feeling almost connected to them again. Distance is difficult.   There is this couple that I have seen outside of my office building twice now, each time doing the same thing. They have two dogs on leashes and are always stopped on the sidewalk brushing one of them. Big tufts of dog hair blowing off in the wind. Why? Why do they do this here? Does one of them work in the building? Is this a lunch dog-grooming date? Do they not want dog hair in their own yard? I love dogs, but even this is too much for me. I just don't understand. The dogs don't look particularly thrilled either. This just isn't making anyone happy. I may have to say something to them next time I see them.   What's your "ideal" temperature? I'm most happy when my environment is between 70-75 degrees. I detest summer because of the temperatures. And not for the normal reasons. I hate air conditioning habits that kick into gear when it starts getting hot outside. My office building suddenly becomes an ice cooler. Stores are freezing. I actually look forward to stepping back out into the heat because I can't handle being chilly. Even knowing this about myself, I still find myself dating a Penguin. The boy cannot handle warmth....not even heat, but warmth. Winter is miserable b/c he doesn't believe in heating his abode. I seriously think people who enjoy being cold have a messed up genetic code. We woke up one morning and I quickly realized that I could literally see my breath. It was 55 degrees, according to the thermostat. FIFTY FIVE DEGREES. Homocidal tendencies kick in at that point, although I was too cold to lift a blunt object to use on him. (To his credit, he admits this was "pushing it" and has become better acquainted with the heat setting.)   Point is, I'm cold today. And it's not making me happy. brrrrrr.

       I don't understand people sometimes. Ok, a lot of the time. Most of the time, really. That includes myself. I can't even put my finger on what's bothering me today, but I'm hella (didn't that word go out years ago? screw it.) annoyed with life in general. I think it's because I started out the day drinking a Pepsi One. I had a decision to make: drink what's available (aka free) in my fridge or spend $1.09 to get what I really want. I suffer when I'm cheap. I think this is why I blow through money like I'm being graded on it. I'm so unhappy when I compromise or talk myself out of something that I really need/want/desire/crave - be it a new purse or a $9 sandwich. And besides - who the hell buys Pepsi in Atlanta? I'm going to have words with my roomie when she returns. No I won't. I'm too non-confrontational for that to actually happen.   I went to reschedule a girls happy hour since the scheduled date isn't looking good for people, and quickly realized that I didn't have another free weeknight until July 19th. JULY 19TH. That is insane. How do I book myself up like this? Why? Why can't I sit still? Why do I have to fill every day in the week and make plans for every weekend? How did I get to be like this? I'm traveling 3 weekends in a row next month. August doesn't look much better. Is there some gene that I have that doesn't allow me to be idle? Because seriously, I'm flat out miserable when I have more than a few hours of down time. When I was laid up after surgery last month I thought I was going to have a coronary from being in bed for 2 days straight. And half of that time I was knocked out.   So annoyed with myself. Blah. Am I the only one that's like this? No, don't tell me. I'll feel even worse if I am.   (and on that note - I realized I have comments on this template. sweet. so feel free to comment away. not that anyone's even reading this. Ok - bigger pity trip. I need a diet coke.)

       There's this show on Food Network called Unwrapped. It's a pretty cool concept - basically showing you how different foods and products are made. It's a lot of factory type shots, showing you the automation and things you just never thought about like how those millions of dum-dum lollipops are created, packaged, and shipped out. You know...like how Mr. Rogers used to show that crayon-making process that was so fascinating? Or was that Sesame Street? Regardless....  I am now boycotting this show. Last night was focusing on Summer Foods. Paper plates, potato salad, cold cuts (which was gross to watch, but tolerable), and then they got to the Hot Dogs. Oh. My. Dear. Lord. I was literally *writhing* while watching this. I think I screamed once. It has ruined me forever, and never again will I be able to enjoy those little guys. They *shoot* this mushy *pulp* looking stuff into *casings*. Cannot deal. I'm ruined. Am literally shuddering just at the memory of that visual. I know what you're thinking. "How in the world did you think they were made?" I didn't. It was a concious decision not to focus on that aspect of ballpark guilty pleasures. But it was like a car wreck. I couldn't look away.   I could not possibly be more bored at work right now. I got all excited about a report I was asked to put together...and it took 3 minutes. Maybe I need to learn how to be less efficient.

       So here we are. A new beginning and a clean slate. After some recent occurences, I'd thought about just ending my blogging life and calling it a day...but I just really need this outlet for some reason. I don't even give a rat's ass if anyone else reads it - in all honestly, I'd sometimes prefer that no one else would. It's scary putting yourself out there, even if it's in a somewhat anonymous manner. Scarier to know that people criticize you for what you choose to share. But I grew up keeping a journal and I'm just too lazy these days to pick up paper and pen so this forum fills that need in me.   If you like what you read, keep reading. If you don't...well, God Bless America and your right to never visit this URL again. Please feel free to exercise that right. Amen and Hallelujiah.

       St. Louis is so pretty in the summer. Who knew.&nbsp; This is just the worst possible week to be traveling. I can't believe I'm moving tomorrow and I'm not even home to stress out about it. Maybe it's a blessing in disguise. We'll pretend like it is, at least.   Question: How big of a pay cut would you be willing to take if it was for a major career change, into an industry that's&nbsp;hard to break into and really fascinating.&nbsp; 20%? 40%? 50%? More? I'm really torn. I know it'd be worth it in the long run....but it's really hard for me to wrap my head around the things I'd have to give up in the meantime.   What to do, what to do. Maybe they won't even like me and I won't have to decide. :)

        Got my haircut yesterday. Try not to yawn. I just love this place I've been going to for awhile now….it's an Aveda salon and it's just really cool. Love the environment. They even give you scalp massages with scented oil before you get your hair washed. Sounds weird, yes, but it's heaven. I went during lunch and within about 15 minutes a woman walked in for her appointment with her dog. A big weimaraner. Beautiful dog. But it's a dog. In a hair salon. And apparently no one else though this was strange. I was sitting there silently pondering why a place would ban cellphones but allow dogs, when out of nowhere there was a piercing bark and everyone jumped. Including my stylist. Who was at the time holding a pair of scissors to my head. Luckily she hadn't gone in for the snip at that second, but she looked at me, laughed, and said "wow. That could have been ugly." um, YEAH?! You think that's funny? This is my head! My hair! Let's focus here, can we? Very disconcerting.    I'm hungry. I've been doing really good about not eating out. Moving has made me broke. That and my sister's wedding. But these are all good things so it's worth it. I just hate not having money to spend as I choose (i.e. frivolously) J. Crew is taunting me. Why do they keep sending me catalogues? They should invent an "I'm broke - do not mail" list that you can put yourself on temporarily when you need to avoid temptations.

       A huuuuge thank you to  urlLink Gatoreena &nbsp;for her entry on lists of things to do in life. I made one in the back of one of my journals when I was about 18, and had been so diligent about crossing things off (hot damn, I love crossing things off lists. Why is that so fulfilling?) I'm on a mission now to find that journal.&nbsp; I'm such a listmaker at heart. Even if the list is written on my hand. Some people don't understand that, but that's why they forget to do things and I don't.   I'm in the office five days next month. That's just sick. Although I won't complain too much since one week of being out is due to being on a cruise in the gulf of mexico. I know...but somebody's gotta do it. That and my sister's getting married in a little over two weeks. My little sister. Married. Just can't quite wrap my head around that one. I still look at her and sometimes get flashbacks of her crying because I stole her blankie.&nbsp; She can't be someone's wife, can she? She's like....4 years old. I swear.   &nbsp;

       Went to my 1o-year camp reunion this weekend in Tennessee. No, I really did. And it was probably up there with the best weekends I've ever had. There's just something to be said for having girlfriends that you grew up going to camp with every summer, and getting back together and it feeling like nothing much had changed...except this time we were in a bar instead of a canoe.&nbsp; Sooo many laughs, a few tears, lots of squealing and reminiscing, and one infamous picture of a plumberesque butt crack. Oh good lord. My stomach hurts just from thinking about how hard I laughed. If that ain't what life is about (the laughing, not the butt crack), then I don't know what is.  &nbsp;  Speaking of crack. We're moving next weekend into a house we rented in Midtown. Cannot. Wait. It's seriously so kick ass, and I think the only reason it's being rented and not sold is because it has a ginormous crack in the foundation. So I heart the crack for being there and enabling me to live above it for at least (hopefully) a year.  &nbsp;  To complete the trilogy, I found a little baggie of cocaine (coulda been crack. I'm actually quite pleased that I don't know the difference.)&nbsp;in my elevator a few weeks ago. "Found" is really exagerrating, since all it involved was looking down near my feet. I was bent over looking at it, examining it as closely as I could without having to actually touch it. You know someone in my building was pissed as hell that morning when they realized what they'd dropped. Oops. Serves you right for being a crack smokin' dumbass in the first place. But how random is that? Is that a sign that my building is going up or downhill? Should I have just left it there? I didn't want my fingerprints associated with it, and I'm wondering if that makes me really lame. Of course, I tell my friend this story and the immediate response is "dude! You know we know people that would've taken that! Why'd you leave it?"&nbsp; About&nbsp;six reasons popped into my head instantly, but what it all boils down to is&nbsp;I just believe you&nbsp;shouldn't mess with crack.&nbsp; It is where it is for a reason.

       There are few things I hate more in life than moving. Packing is just not up there on my lists of things I can tolerate. Considering this will be my 4th move in two years, I guess it's understandable that I detest it. I'm already bitching about it and haven't even put a box together. The bright side is, of course, that I'm WAY excited about moving into a house again! woo! a yard! a garage! a guest bedroom! It makes me dizzy just thinking about it. But it sure sucks being a pack rat and moving crap around.   The surprise party for my roomie was last night, and I have to admit it was a smashing success. Good times had by all, and I'm just so in my element when organizing such events. I wonder how you become a professional party planner. Although really, who wants to plan parties that you can't stay and enjoy as a guest. Honestly.   For her birthday, my roommate's boyfriend gave her two kittens! Oh dear lord. Kittens. I heart them so. I literally spent a full hour yesterday afternoon just sitting on the floor, watching them tumble around and slide into furniture after busting ass on the hardwoods. And everytime I'd laugh it would startle them and they'd jump in the air and take off running. Such simple joy. Then they woke me up at 7:15 this morning. Kitties are gonna have to learn  really  quickly not to mess with a night owl at that ungodly time of day. They're lucky they're cute.

       Things in the works:   - Trip to Minneapolis tomorrow - trying to nail down what to do over the weekend - Surprise party on Monday night for a friend (hope to god she doesn't know about my blog) - Camp reunion next weekend in Tennessee that I've organized. Bringing 16 girls together from all across the country just ain't easy.  - Moving 3 weeks from tomorrow. Guess I should start packing.  - Helping my sister tie up everything for her wedding in less than a month - Upgrading our alumni web site with a new functionality, which is the LAST thing I have time for right now. Why do I sign up for jobs like this? Why?  - Have to finish my book club book by next Tuesday  I serously think my head is going to fall off. Don't even get me started with what I have to do at work (obviously procrastinating in that arena). I think I have officially reached my "I've taken on too much" threshold. I was beginning to wonder if I had one.   Oh, and my parents are putting my cat to sleep next week. Can't even talk about this. I had to put my other cat to sleep about 6 months ago - these two had been around for 15 years and I grew up with them. blaaaaaah. cannot deal.   On the bright side....I am so, so completely happy with so many things in my life right now. And they're the pretty major things so I know I should be thankful. And I am. Really, I am. The daily minutia just starts to take its toll after awhile.

       My dad and I drove up to see my grandfather this weekend as part of my New England weekend adventures. Since they'd just moved to a new town, we were given the Driving Tour of Uxbridge, Mass.  It included such noteworthy parking lot visits as the local Post Office, Wal-Mart, CVS ("the biggest CVS ever", according to my grandfather) and the visitor's center. Yes, Uxbridge has a visitor's center. I actually really enjoyed the drive. I was in the backseat, presumably because my dad needed to be upfront in case he needed to grab the wheel and steer us away from curbs. Windows down, beautiful day, and really, I was quite content to be driven just about anywhere. As we were turning back into his neighborhood, I suddenly realized I'd been hoping he'd turn into a candy store and let me fill a bag with whatever I wanted. And I was a little let down that it hadn't happened. Yes, I'm 27. Yes, I know I'm not even all that into candy. But he used to do that when we were little and I think I had reverted back to being 9 while sitting in that backseat and listening to his stories. It was the saddest feeling of "I hate being a grown-up". Then my grandfather took out his teeth to eat his ice cream and I felt young again.   How many times do you have to be polite to someone when they ask you the time? Hypothetically speaking, let's say you're sitting next to someone on a plane and they ask you every 20 minutes what time it is. Even when you're asleep. After 3 or 4 times, is it ok to say "time to get a watch"? I really considered giving this man my watch about halfway through the flight. I even tried to fall asleep with my arm on the armrest so he could visibly see it and not have to ask me. If you're that concerned with the time, you should own one. Seriously.

       Of raindrops...that's all we hear around here anymore. Make it stop!! What gives?   Off to NYC in a few hours for the weekend. Here begins my non-stop crazy schedule. I'm sure to have a mental breakdown at some point from sheer exhaustion, but I apparently need one at least once a year to feel fulfilled.   My new mantra of being upfront and honest with people is actually working wonders. I'm a certified non-confrontationalist and tend to let people walk over me, and just choose to simmer about things and be secretly mad at them forever. It's amazing what happens when you just tackle the issues head on. It really feels good. Even better when you're dealing with mature people who like to work through things and bury the hatchet instead of continuing to hold a grudge just for the sake of having something to fester over. But who needs people like that in their life? Not I, said the fly. Not I.

       Working from home today. Didn't have much choice, really. We went to drive to work and realized a huge tree had fallen across our driveway last night  - which is what I heard at 4am, but was so out of it that I grabbed my pillow off the floor, thinking that's what I heard fall (I know) , rolled over and went back to sleep. It's a beeeeautiful day here, so it's nice being able to work in our sunroom with all the windows open.  Do me a favor and support my friend, Jason, as he rides again for MS - you can pledge  urlLink here  - last year he was the #2 fundraiser in all of Georgia and he's going for #1, and I just think it's so kickass that he does this.  He's my partner in crime for visiting shady Bulgarian nightclubs in NYC. Cool cat.  Hope everyone in Florida holds up through today...sounds like it's going to be a rough one. I have this vivid memory from when I was younger and lived in Orlando, and a passing hurricane brought gale winds and crazy rains, and rain was shooting up under the door in our classroom that led inside. It was so cool. Although probably not so cool to anyone other than eight-year-olds.  Book rec of the week:  Who Will Run the Frog Hospital?  by Lorrie Moore. Good stuff.

       I cannot believe I survived this weekend. Nor can I believe my little sister is married. But I suppose I must come to terms with both ideas, before the crush of Monday morning hits.  Quote of the weekend: "He was very curious about the candles in the candleabra above my bathtub dripping wax, and said he'd worry about burning his ding-dong." Amen.  Less favorite quote of the weekend:  "oh, I forgot to get a garter. I should probably have one to throw since we're doing that whole thing." - en route to the church. for the ceremony. only tres annoying because five minutes earlier it was "oh. I left my engagement ring at Nordstroms. oops. can we swing by?"  Also on the way to the church. God love her, and love me for knowing of a bridal salon en route. What are the odds.  I need a vacay. Had an absolute blast this weekend, but holy hell am I exhausted.

       Somehow I made it through the move, although the boy and I did almost kill each other about three times. I think we both react to stress the same way - and apparently that way isn't meant for sharing. But it actually was a semi-enjoyable experience. It's so invigorating to start the next chapter of your life. I'm in love with this house - it has so much 1920's charm and character. Although the slanting floor is quickly losing favor with me as my chair rolls away from the computer desk every few minutes. And the problem with moving into a new place is that you feel like you can justify blowing money left and right. It's really expensive to set up house. We even bought each other housewarming gifts. Was that necessary? My god, no. But did it matter? Please. We may be stressed out, but deep down we're stressed out shoppers who love to gift each other. And that's part of why it's all so fun.  T-minus two days till wedding madness officially begins. Am I horrible for buying my sister's lingerie shower gift at Target instead of Victoria's Secret? You know she won't wear that VS crap more than once. Am I getting practical with old age? or cheap? The PJ's are damn cute though. I'll give myself that.  Work blows big donkey butt. It's so typical that the two week period where all hell breaks lose and I'm busy and stressed out coincides with my move and this wedding. Typical, I tell you.  And I've lost a flip-flop. It's somewhere in this house - I know that much. I wear these flippies almost every day and I feel like I've lost my left foot. Seriously traumatized over this, and no one seems to be as concerned as I am.
