      We finally found out that we can move as early as June 4. Which doesn't give us much time. I have been telling ny husband that we need to start packing and he hasn't agreed and now we find out we can move as early as NEXT Thursday. We probably won't be moving that soon, because we probably won't be able to schedule the movers that quickly. But we are hoping to be out of here by the 10th. (Still doesn't give us a lot of time!) He is calling the townhouse place now, to see if we can get in there earlier. Hoping we can! Otherwise we are just wasting our time down here.   We are trying to do a partial-dity move. That means some of our stuff will be packed and taken by the movers. We will rent a truck and pack some of our more fragile/valuable stuff, and pull his car. I will drive my car and stick important stuff in there including Mr. Tibbs (the rabbit). This is going to be A TON of work! I'm not looking forward to getting started, but at the same time I can't wait to get out of P-Cola!

      Hmmmm...being married isn't so bad after all. You always hear the horror stories and rarely hear about the good stuff. I love being married! I can't imagine not being married. I found out over the weekend that married people still can make out like the best of them! :) We finally got his orders today. It looks like the next big step in our lives and our marriage will be happening pretty soon. His orders are for June 30, 2004, that's his lsat day in the Navy. Which means I have to start packing this week for our move to Rochester, NY that will be happening in just a couple of weeks (actually I'm not even sure if we have a couple of weeks!). I'm sure my stress level is about to hit an all time high (i hate packing and unpacking and moving) and this moves comes with alot of uncertainty. Considering we will both be unemployed come June 30. Also he may be entering the reserves. This causes me stress because I have recently heard of alot of reserves being sent to Iraq. NO WAY DO I WANT MY HUSBAND THERE! AHHHH! I'm starting to feel stressed already. This will be a test of our marriage that is for sure.

        One month    has come and gone. Milestones that we have been through: well we bought a new car yesterday. We traded in my Protege for a Subaru Impreza TS Sport Wagon (red). Yes I am now the owner of a wagon. Could I feel any older?! Luckily it's a sport wagon and not an actual station wagon (I'm not that much of a loser). The reasoning behind getting the new vehicle was that I needed either a car with all wheel drive or 4 wheel drive since we will soon be moving up to Rochester, NY. Now I have one and should hopefully be able to get through Rochester winters in one piece. Hopefully. News? Well we are thinking of moving up there between June 6-June 15. Not sure of the exact date yet. Other then that our marriage is awesome. I was told yesterday by the guy who sold us the car that, "I have a good husband." I was smiling and nodded. I know I have a great husband! The only bad news is that we can't spend any money from now until after we move since we need to save. We barely did anything before this move, now we really aren't going to be doing anything. Sigh.

      Well I have been married for almost a month now. I really don't feel any different at all. I do have an awesome husband who would do anything for me. He also cooks which is a good thing since I suck at it. I do like knowing that people will call me Mrs. D now. As far as our living situation we will be moving soon which will be our first challege as newlyweds. Oh and we decided to start trying to get pregnant in the spring/summer of 2006. Other then that being married is the same as being engaged for us. Except my husband introduces me as his wife and that also is cool.

      Well we are now in Rochester, NY.  How do I like it? It's not bad. I haven't found a job yet and my husband is on unemployment, but other then that everything is going well. I'm not bitter, because I wasn't doing any better in Florida. I actually prefer being up here in the north.  That opinion will surely change once it starts snowing though.  At least I am closer to friends and family, which is very important to me.  I just wish the townhouse that we moved into was alittle nicer. There building were built in the 60's and they just were not put together very well.  The windows being too thin is my biggest complaint.  I think it's a valid one considering the amount of cold they have up here.  I can't wait to start working so that I can meet some people.  We have being hanging out with my husbands friends alot which is fine, but I need my own friends up here too.  My family is visiting next weekend.  We are going to go up to Niagra Falls on Saturday and Sunday, can't wait!    My marriage is great, just as I expected it to be.  I wouldn't have married someone who wasn't perfect for me.  We only fight about stupid things, nothing important.  Since we get along more then we fight about 97%-3%, I have nothing to complain about there.  We need money, but what newly starting out couple doesn't.  Eventually once he finishes nursing school and I finish hygienist school we will be doing well.  Assuming I go to hygienist school.  I know, I know...I need to do this since it's what I figured out was the best career for me, but I'm kindof hoping I get an interview for this job working at a downtown advertising company. Its a decent job that I can get through the temp agency, but it wouldn't be a temp job.  Of course I think I'd still be happier being a dental hygienist. What should I be when I grow up? If you have any ideas send me a message.
