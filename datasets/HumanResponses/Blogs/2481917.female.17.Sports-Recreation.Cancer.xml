Kaki ku berat seperti batu    Berlari dengan pantas    Menuju ke arah kemenangan    Walaupun hatiku mengatakan amat sukar    Aku tidak akan putus asa.    Aku terlihat garis penamat    Terdengar ramai penonton bersorak-sorak    Rakan-rakanku menjerit namaku    Memberi ku semangat dan kekuatan    Lalu ku gegas berlari ke garis penamat.    Akhirnya...    Aku jatuh dan rebah ke bumi    Terukir senyuman di wajahku    Walupun diriku sudah tidak bermaya    Kerana aku tahu, aku telah berjaya    Hatiku diisi dengan kepuasan dan kelegaan.

       A moment just like heaven, A kiss so filled with love, The night so clear and quiet, Just like a Turtle Dove.  My heart is pumping wildly, As I hold my girl so tight, No feeling could ever compare to this, No feeling has been so right.  Not ever would i share such time, Nor enjoy it quite so much, The moment I melt into you, Is the moment I feel your touch.  Your touch so soft and lonely, Female bodies in a cool caress, You know we I enjoy our passion As you lay upon my breast.  My body continually used to wonder, Between those of the men, Yet little did i realize, All I really wanted was a woman.  Now my life is complete and safe, As our passion continues to grow, You are the only one I love, And now this you do know.
