      My flute is a wooden Yamaha 874 with a B-foot, an inline G, and French style keys with pointed key arms. The flute is hand-made from grenadilla wood and the keys are made of solid silver. It's a beautiful thing to see, for sure, but it's real glory is only known through playing it (or, if you're on the other end, through listening to it.) It has a wondrous dark, rich sound. It's not so unlike the sound produced by a silver flute that it can't blend. Rather, the upper register is not so bell-like. It's more "reedy"...but in a good way. And the lower register. Well...that's where the difference between my flute and a silver flute is really heard. The lower register is warm and delicious. I love my flute. And I'm beginning to suspect that it might love me, too. The more time I spend with it, the better it treats me.

      This flute is approximately 15 years old and is in excellent used condition. It has no dents and no scratches. The case is original and is also in excellent used condition. Besides the French style case shown in the photos, this instrument also comes with a zippered leather-ette case cover with handles (also in excellent condition.) The flute has a solid silver head, body, and foot. The keys are silver-plated. The springs are white gold. The flute is open-holed with French style pointed key arms. The flute has a B-foot and an inline G. This flute comes with Yamaha's CY cut headjoint. This flute was cleaned, oiled, and adjusted in May 2003 by  urlLink Lagerquist Flute Service . This is a very fine semi-professional quality instrument with excellent intonation in all registers.  $1750.00    urlLink Click here for photos of the flute.

      This flute is in very good used condition. It has no dents and only very minor scratches associated with age and use. The case is original and is also in very good used condition. It is approximately 30 years old. In July of 2003, it was complete overhauled by technicians at  urlLink Flute World . All new pads and corks were installed and the flute was thoroughly cleaned. Gemeinhardt flutes of this vintage are known for being high quality step-up level instruments. (Do some research on the quality of new Gemeinhardt flutes before you pass up this older flute!! The older models are BETTER.) This flute has a solid silver head and silver-plated body, foot, and keys. It is open-holed and has a C-foot. The flute has a lovely sound and was instrumental (heh, heh) in my winning many contests and other honors (including "first chair" flute in the Minnesota State Band in...whoa!...1975.)  Price just reduced!... $500.00    urlLink Click here for photos of the flute.

      Okie dokie...so I'm through (for now) with the Mozart and I've moved on to the Haydn. My teacher (the excellent Lois Wynn) gave me a CD to listen to in conjunction with my working on the Haydn: Ashildur Haraldsdottir doing the Benda (E minor), CPE Bach G major), and Haydn D major) flute concertos (or "concerti" if you prefer.) I haven't listened yet, but I'll report back when I do. I'm told that Ashildur does some particularly nice ornamentation work in the Haydn.

      I have to assume you're interested, right? ;-)  On oboe, I'm working my way through the Rubank Intermediate Method. I'm about 2/3 of the way through. Once in a while I'll also pull out one of the Barret exercises. I'm making progress with the oboe so...that's heartening.  I'm considerably more advanced on flute. I've been working through the Andersen 24 Etudes Techniques (Opus 63) and I'm about 1/3 of the way through. I usually spend at least a couple of weeks on each etude with the goal of playing it as smoothly as possible and as close to the tempo that's marked as possible. (If you're familiar with these etudes, you'll know what a challenge that can sometimes be!) This week I'm on etude number 9 (...number 9...number 9...number 9...) (If you're too young to have been a Beatles fan, that won't mean anything to you.) Number 9's not too bad. I'm looking forward to number 10, though! How can you  not  get excited by a notation like this:    ff  con tutta la forza e molto furioso   :-) ...e  molto  furioso!!!   Hey, baby. Bring it on! I'm ready!  Besides the Andersen etudes, I'm also working on the 3rd movement of the Mozart G Major Concerto using the Michel DeBost cadenza. Very nice, indeed.   And, for piccolo fun, I'm working on the Two Duos by Roger Nixon. I had never heard of this piece before my flute teacher hauled it out. Cool!

       I can almost hear all you men who are reading this page thinking, "Oh sure... if only the average American housewife DID look like that!" Well, we can't all be Bettie Page. Actually, when I snagged this photo off the web, I had no idea who this woman was. I just liked the look of her--sort of naughty and coy. My husband recognized her immediately, though. "Wow! Bettie Page! I haven't seen any pictures of her in years!" (Yeah, sure.) He claims a guy he knew while he was in the Navy who had an entire scrapbook filled with photos of Bettie Paige. Apparently, this photo is one of tamer ones she ever did. She also posed for a lot of pictures wearing strange leather outfits and a ball-gag. And all this was back in the 50s! I had no idea.  Whatever. Enough about Bettie Paige. Let's talk about me. These days, being a housewife is a pretty rare thing. Being a housewife and being healthy and educated and not having any children is almost unheard of. I think it's revealing, though, that very few people ever ask me why I wanted to quit work and stay at home. Just about everyone I know wakes up every morning desperately wishing they could just stay home. It really makes you wonder about the kinds of jobs people are getting themselves into, doesn't it? There is one question, though, that almost everyone does ask: "Don't you get bored?" There are two ways to approach that one. The Short Answer and The Long Answer. I recommend you take The Long Answer but, if you're pressed for time or you just don't care, feel free to go with The Short Answer. (Of course, if you're pressed for time or just don't care, I'd have to wonder what you're doing reading my web pages to begin with, but far be it from me to pry into your personal. business. So... Go ahead... Choose either  urlLink The Short Answer  or  urlLink The Long Answer .)  In case you're wondering, here are some of the reasons for why I wanted to become An American Housewife.    The food is better.   The house is cleaner.   There's no more arguing with the spouse over housework. I do it all. I do it better than he ever could anyway. When the spouse gets home from work we have our evenings and entire weekends free for relaxing and goofing around. There are no chores waiting to be done because I've done them all during the weekdays. Consequently, we both have more time to do the things we really like to do.    When I decided to become a housewife, there were certain expectations I developed for myself. After all, since my husband makes a very meaningful contribution to our household by bringing home money every week, it's only fair that I should also make a meaningful contribution.  I prepare a lunch for the spouse to take with him to work every day.  I have dinner ready when he comes home from work.  I do all the household chores including laundry, yardwork, cleaning, cooking, dealing with repair service people, taking the cars into the shop, picking up packages, taking out the garbage, whatever.  The idea is that when the spouse comes home from work every day, he isn't expect to do anything but relax and enjoy himself. This makes his life easier. It makes my life easier. There's considerably less stress for both of us. And we both feel that we're making worthwhile contributions to the relationship.  Here's the deal: If you can afford it and you don't particularly care about a career, I highly recommend that one of the people in a couple become "the housewife." It's a lot more affordable than you might think. You'll actually find that you save a LOT of money by cooking your own food and doing your own laundry and cleaning. Believe it or not, I usually spend around $75 per week on groceries. If you do any grocery shopping, you'll recognize that as a fairly low grocery bill. (At least, it is here on the east coast where we live.) It's surprising how much cheaper it is to buy a bunch of fresh raw vegetables and some flour and yeast and make your own veggie pizzas than to buy frozen ones made with questionable ingredients. If you make your own food, you know what's gone into it. You know all the bugs were washed off before it was cooked. You know the potatoes didn't have rotten spots in them. Have you ever experienced this? You're digging into some frozen concoction from the grocery store and you come across some odd little grayish-brown bit. Is it a mushroom? A hunk of rotten vegetable? Or a shriveled up bug?? Who knows??? If you'd cooked the food yourself from scratch, YOU would know.

       I've been a vegetarian since 1975 which, not coincidentally, is the same year I graduated from high school and moved away from home. It's nice to know that I've been a vegetarian for longer than I was ever a meat-eater. If you're interested in knowing why I became a vegetarian, please feel free to write to me and I'd be glad to go into it in excruciating detail. It's been my experience, though, that people--particularly people who eat meat--are not interested in hearing about this and, in fact, quite often find harangues about the evils of eating meat quite off-putting. It seems to me that the best way to persuade people over to my point of view (at least as regards diet) is to demonstrate how healthy and tasty and ethical a vegetarian diet is with the example of my own life. Nobody like an uninvited lecture.   My husband is not a vegetarian but he is impressively supportive of my diet choice. Not only is he okay with not cooking meat in the house, he also specifically chooses restaurants for us to eat in that have some vegetarian choices on the menu. What a guy! Since the spouse does eat meat and likes that flavor, we have made some compromises on the kinds of foods we eat at home. For example, we use Morningstar Farms "Breakfast Patties" (a meat-y tasting vegetarian product) in spaghetti sauces and tacos--when I'd probably be quite happy without that stuff. It's pretty heavily processed and is high in fat. Apparently, though, it's a fairly convincing meat substitute. Every one of the people I've served this stuff to (all meat-eaters) has liked these Morningstar Farms products. It's not what I'd probably choose just for myself but it's a reasonable compromise.  As I mentioned on the American Housewife at Home page, I cook most of our food from scratch. For the past couple of years, we've really been getting into Indian food a lot. What a discovery this cuisine was for me!! Incredibly delicious-- and so many MANY different vegetarian recipes.  Here are some of my favorites:  Daal Spicy Indian Potatoes Curried Squash Soup Labra  ....actual recipes will appear in future blog entries!  If you're not familiar with Indian food, don't let these recipes scare you. The spices are different from what you're used to, but once you try it you'll be glad you branched out. Even my sainted mother (a midwestern meat-and-potatoes kind of gal if ever there was one) found that she really liked Daal and Spicy Potatoes once she'd tried them.   In truth, I don't use actual recipes much anymore. When you cook a lot you develop a sense for which spices tast best with different kinds of foods and how much you'll need. The best thing is to cook a lot and experiment. If you're home all day, you'll have time to do that. Of course, if you don't like to cook (strange, but I've heard it sometimes happens), you probably aren't cut out to be a housewife. In that case, go to a good restaurant for your meals. Just about anything's better than most of the prepared foods you get in grocery stores.

         I have one question that I wish someone could answer to my satisfaction: Why are people such slobs? I'm serious. How do people live that way? It's a mystery to me. I can't really relax if the house is a mess. You know what I'm talking about? If there's stuff lying around on the countertops and tables, dirty dishes in the sink, crud on the bathroom floor... It just makes me tense. Maybe it's a control issue. I need to be in complete control of my environment--and that means it needs to, at the very least, be NEAT and CLEAN.  The way some of my (messy) friends explain it is that they don't have time for cleaning their houses. It all just seems so overwhelming that they don't know where to begin. It's easier to just keep adding to the mess. I suppose there might be some truth to that-- once your place has become a big mess, it takes a bit of extra work to clean it up. For these folks, then, I offer my plan for taking charge of your environment!  The initial work of getting your mess under control will take some time so...if you work, you might want to consider taking a week off. Here's the Beginner's Program:   Get rid of your junk. It's amazing the crap people save. Throw it out, for God's sake! You don't need most of the stuff you're hanging onto. You'll be surprised how freeing it is to unload a bunch of your stuff. Look at it this way: Do you want to be defined by your stuff? Of course you don't. You want to move on. You want to be free to become.  Once you've cleared out the junk, organize what's left and put it away somewhere. Stuff that you don't use often can be put away in a relatively inaccessable place (attic, garage) and stuff that you use often can be put away in a place that's easy to get to. Makes sense, right? Be aware, though, that an "easy to get to" place DOES NOT mean a pile on the counter in the kitchen. Buy yourself some organizers or something...baskets, attractive boxes, whatever.  Okay! That's the hardest part! Now comes the easy stuff...  Clean up while you cook. Rinse and put pots and pans and dishes in the dishwasher as soon as you're done using them. You're already just standing there in the kitchen! Make use of your time! Put that stuff away!  Same with the mail. Look through it as soon as you bring it in. Immediately toss the junk mail. (You're not going to have time to look at it anyway. Be honest with yourself.) Immediately open the bills, toss the junk that comes with them, and put the bills all in a single place to await payment.  PUT THINGS AWAY WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH THEM. Jeez! Were you born in a barn??  Now that you've got your stuff under control, you're ready to move on to actual cleaning of your space. Do this: Vacuum everything at least once a week. Get yourself a really good vacuum cleaner with multiple settings and attachments. Nothing can beat a good vacuum cleaner for all-over cleaning. Use it on the floors (of course), the furniture, the window blinds, attach the brush thingie and use it to clean dust and cobwebs off the walls and ceilings, vacuum out the insides of the cupboards.   Get yourself a  urlLink Swiffer  wetjet mop. Laugh if you will, but the Swiffer is a good product. Sure, it's expensive... well...heh, heh,...I guess there's no getting around that. But it's the best tool for quick mop-up jobs that I've seen. Don't bother with the other brands. Swiffer is the best by far. The pads are thick and absorbant--like disposable diapers. The liquid cleaning stuff smells pretty good. Wash your floors regularly. It's simple if you use a Swiffer.  Dust. I'm actually not all that crazy for the Swiffer brand dusting-thingies. They do pick up the dust, but they don't shine your furniture like good old-fashioned furniture polish and a rag will. Dust once a week. It's easy and pleasant. Put some really good music on the stereo and just...dust. Since you've thrown out most of your knick-knacks it won't take all that long. (You have thrown out those goofy knick-knacks, haven't you?)  The best way I've found for cleaning bathrooms is to use just one product (Pinesol), hot water, a cleaning rag, and some rubber gloves. Put on your rubber gloves. Fill the bathroom sink with some hot water and Pinesol. Toss in your cleaning rag to get it good and wet. Start cleaning. It actually only takes a few minutes to clean a bathroom using this method. Use the same rag/Pinesol/hot-water approach to every surface. Wash down the counters first, then bathtub/shower, then the toilets (you've got rubber gloves on...don't be shy), then drain and wipe out the sink. The last thing you clean on your way out is the bathroom floor (assuming you're not going to Swiffer it.) Just get down on your hands and knees and wipe the floor up while you're backing out of the bathroom. TaDaaaa! Done! And fast. I learned this method of bathroom cleaning when I worked as a hotel maid a long time ago.  That pretty much covers it. If you keep up with things, it will never get out of control again. If you keep up with it, it doesn't take long at all. Don't be a slob. Get neat!

       First of all, get RID of all that clutter. If, for example, you collect these "Precious Moments" figurines, here's what I want you to do. Gather up all those dear little statues in a box. Take them out to the curb. Smash them on the sidewalk while chanting over and over, "I will never, NEVER again spend my money on such ugly, useless crap." Believe me, it may hurt at first but eventually you'll be glad you did it.  Next: Leather furniture, plasto-wood (you know, like lots of entertainment centers and desks are made of), and anything that's PLAID has to go. Out with it all!  Here's what you need. Get yourself some real wood furniture. Real wood is always ALWAYS preferable to anything made of plasto-wood. If you can't afford new real wood furniture, check out the  urlLink Salvation Army  or  urlLink Goodwill  store nearest you. People often give away perfectly nice real wood stuff. You can always refinish it if it's in rough shape or is painted some bizarre color.  Keep in mind, too, that you don't have to use a piece of furniture for its original design purpose. If you cut the legs down a bit on an old wood kitchen table, it makes a wonderful big desk. An old buffet is good for storing your computer accessories. If you cut the legs down on a kitchen table even more it makes the best coffee table you ever had in your life.  When it comes time to get upholstered furniture, make sure you get something PLAIN AND SUBTLE. No plaid, no big flowers, no leather. No, no, NO. If you insist on having plaid or flowers or (gads) leather, get a couple of pillows with this stuff on it.  A good way to add color to your house is to use nice pieces of art glass. Just a few pieces. Don't over-do it. And don't be intimidated by the term "art glass." Art glass is just anything you're using as a decorative object (and not, for example, as a fruit bowl.) I have some colored glass bowls that were absurdly cheap (less than $10 each) that are really beautiful as artistic objects. Art doesn't have to cost.  People have a real tendency to want to line every wall with furniture and pictures. This is a mistake. Less is more. Space is a good thing and will make your home feel much more restful.  Personally, I don't care much for Victorian or French Provincial type decorating. I think it's fussy and uninviting. What I've been doing for years is a mixture of Scandinavian, Japanese, and Contemporary styles. When I get around to it, I'll take a few snaps of the interior of my house and put them up here for you to see. (I know...the excitement is almost unbearable.) Our furniture did not cost a lot of money. Most of it was purchased from  urlLink Ikea  back when Ikea was still making their furniture out of real wood. (Now they use a lot of plasto-wood. Sigh...) To that, we added some inherited stuff and some flea market stuff. Voila!

      Are people who ask, "Don't you get bored?" lacking in imagination? I always wonder. Why would they think I might get bored being alone all day if not because they get bored with nothing but their own imaginations as entertainment?  No, I don't get bored. I could entertain myself for an eternity, I think. I enjoy my own thoughts. There's a statement for you: I enjoy my own thoughts. I like the way my imagination works. I get a kick out of reading books that provoke flights of imagination. I love reading a book that has so many interesting ideas in it that I have to stop reading every few minutes just so I can gaze off into space for a while thinking about what I've read and how it fits in with other things I know. I like making the connections that flower into brand new ideas, brand new ways of understanding. Thinking give me tremendous pleasure.  There are more extroverted people in the world than introverted people. Or--maybe it just seems that way. The extroverted people are the ones you see. All the introverts are home reading. I think it's the extroverts who ask that question: "Don't you get bored?"  I never wanted a career, you know. I only worked at whatever jobs I've had for the past 30 years because I had to in order to get the money I needed to do the things I really wanted to do. What I really wanted to do was read books, cook delicious exotic food, listen to music, play on the computer, work in the garden, think about things... With most of the jobs I've had, I was being paid to think about whatever it was my employer wanted me to be thinking about. You work at an insurance company, they expect you to be thinking about insurance while you're there. It's only fair. One of the best jobs I've ever had--in some ways--was when I worked as a hotel maid cleaning toilets, vacuuming floors, and making beds. I could think about whatever I wanted when I was doing that job. I'm telling you the truth: I did some of my best thinking while cleaning hotel rooms! Unfortunately, the pay sucked so I couldn't afford to do any of the other things I really like to do.  The truth is, there's no paying job on earth that would allow me to do the things I really want to do. My interests are simply too broad to be pigeon-holed in a career of any sort. As an old friend of mine once said: Specialization is for insects. What's a Renaissance Woman to do? I really just need a wealthy patron, I guess. And, I guess, I more or less found him.  Now I have the time and--thanks to my spouse's income--the money to finally do what I really want to do. I read. I garden and cook. I play flute and oboe. I mess around with the computer. And I do all the cleaning, cooking, and chores associated with running a household. Since I'm not bringing any cash into the relationship, it seems only fair. Besides, I don't really mind it. I like it when things are orderly. I keep pretty busy. I bake bread. I listen to music and sing along. I think things through.  No, actually, I don't get bored at all.

      Daal  (This recipe is from the "Sundays at Moosewood Restaurant" cookbook)  1 1/2 cups red or brown lentils, yellow or green split peas or split and hulled mung beans (I usually use yellow split peas) 4 cups water 2 dried chiles, whole 1/4 tsp turmeric 1/2 tsp salt 2 T ghee (that's melted, clarified butter) or vegetable oil 1/2 tsp cumin seeds 1 cup chopped onions 1 tsp grated peeled fresh ginger root 1 cup chopped tomatoes 1 T fresh lemon juice 1 tsp garam masala (get this in an Indian/Asian grocery store or the herb/spice department of one of the better-stocked general grocery stores) salt to taste  Wash the lentils, peas, or beans in several changes of cold water. In a medium pot, cover them with the water and add the whole dried chiles, turmeric, and salt. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer, stirring often, until very tender. This will take about 30 minutes for red lentils, 45 minutes for peas, or an hour or more for mung beans. It may be necessary to add more water to prevent sticking, but only 1/2 cup at a time, because the final consistency should be fairly thick. Use a heat diffuser if necessary.  When the lentils are almost cooked, heat the ghee or oil in a small pan, add the cumin seeds, and cook for 10 or 15 seconds. Stir in the onions and ginger and cook for about 5 minutes. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook for another 5 or 10 minutes until most of the liquid from the tomatoes has been absorbed.  When the lentils are tender, remove and discard the hot peppers. Stir in the onion mixture, lemon juice, garam masala, and salt to taste. Serve, passing additional garam masala to sprinkle on top if desired.  We usually eat this with rice. Put a cup or so of cooked rice in a bowl and pour the daal over it. Mmmm. Another good choice is to serve the daal with naan--an Indian flat bread. You can dunk the bread in the daal. Equally Mmmm.

      Labra (adapted from a recipe in Bharti Kirchner's book "The Healthy Cuisine of India")  2 T vegetable oil 1 1/2 tsp sugar 1 bay leaf 1/4 tsp Indian 5-spice powder* 3 T peeled and minced fresh ginger 1/2 tsp turmeric 2 tsp ground cumin 3/4 tsp salt 3/4 cup chopped tomatoes (I usually use just a regular size can of chopped tomatoes) 1/2 cup water 2 or 3 cubed potatoes 1 small cubed sweet potatoes or 3 large diced carrots 2 cups cauliflower florets 1 cup green beans cut into bite-sized lengths 2 cups cubed eggplant 2 tsp Indian red chili paste (Indian grocery item) 1/4 cup thawed frozen peas 1/2 tsp garam masala (another Indian grocery item)  Heat the oil in a big dutch oven type pan over medium heat. Add the sugar and fry until it darkens (a few seconds), add the bay leaf and the 5-spice mixture and fry them for a minute or so. Then add the ginger, turmeric, cumin, and salt. Stir it all up. Add the tomatoes and water, then the potatoes and sweet potatoes (or carrots). Turn the heat to medium low, cover the pot, and simmer for about 15 minutes.  Add the cauliflower, beans, eggplant, and red chili paste. Simmer, covered, for another 10 minutes. Then uncover it and cook until the vegetables are almost done. Add a little water to the pot if the veggies start sticking to the bottom.  Add the peas and simmer, covered, for another 5 minutes or so. Finally, mix in the garam masala. Use the back of your spoon to "smoosh" some of the veggies into the sauce to make it sort of "stew" like.  Eat! Enjoy! Yum!  *Indian 5-spice powder is easy to make yourself and probably tastes better than what you'd get at the Indian grocery. Mix equal by weight portions of: black mustard seeds cumin seeds fennel seeds fenugreek seeds kalonji seeds and then put them into a dry skillet over a low heat for a minute or so. Some of the seeds will probably start to pop. After a minute or two in the pan, empty the seeds into a spice grinder and grind them into a powder. Good stuff!

      Spicy Indian Potatoes  4 T oil (I use canola oil) 1/8 tsp asaphoetida (this is one of those ingredients you'll need to get at an Indian/Asian grocery store or order it from Penzey's) 1/2 tsp whole cumin seeds 1/2 tsp black mustard seeds (again, might need to check out the local Indian grocery or Penzey's) 4 or 5 cubed potatoes (try it with half white potatoes and half sweet potatoes!) 1/4 tsp ground turmeric 1/2 tsp ground cumin 1/2 ground coriander 3/4 tsp salt 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper  Heat the oil in a heavy frying pan equipped with a cover. I usually use an electric frying pan set at 325 degrees. When the oil's hot, add the asaphoetida and let it sizzle for a second or two. Then add the cumin seeds and the mustard seeds. When the mustard seeds begin to pop (which should be almost immediately), add the potatoes. Sprinkle the potatoes with the turmeric, mix the whole works up well so all the potato pieces are coated with oil and seeds, and then cover the pan.  Gently stir the potato mixture every 5 or 10 minutes so all sides of the potato cubes get browned.  When the potatoes are pretty much cooked all the way through, sprinkle the ground cumin, ground coriander, salt, and cayenne pepper over the top and gently stir the mixture to coat all the pieces.  Let it cook for another 5 or 10 minutes. Enjoy! These potatoes are extremely delicious served with a green salad as a meal. You won't believe your taste buds! Zow! Even my omnivore spouse regularly asks for Spicy Indian Potatoes and a salad for dinner!

      Curried Squash Soup  1 medium butternut squash 2 T butter 1 medium onion chopped 2 medium apples, peeled, cored, and chopped 1 tsp curry powder 1 tsp dried thyme 1 quart vegetable stock (I use 2 Knorr vegetarian bouillion cubes dissolved in 4 cups of hot water) 1 tsp salt pepper  Cut squash in half. Coat the cut surfaces with cooking oil, place face down on cookie sheet, and bake at 350 until squash is tender (about an hour.) Remove and cool.  While squash is cooking, watch TV for a while...perhaps an old Star Trek episode is on. Then chop up the onion and apples. In a heavy saucepan, saute the onions until transparent. Add curry powder and cook another minute. Add apples and cook some more. Start scooping squash out with a spoon and add hunks of it to the pot. When squash is all there, add thyme, salt, and pepper. Then pour in the vegetable stock and simmer 15 minutes. Correct seasonings. Toss the whole unappetizing-looking mess into the blender, adding water if necessary, and puree it into a lovely golden soup.  This is REALLY pretty if you dress it up with a dollop of yogurt or heavy cream when serving. You can even do the extremely impressive swirly thing with it!

      Buy good herbs and spices. Without good quality herbs and spices, much of your food will taste like crap. Is that harsh? Perhaps so. Trust me on this, though. (You do trust me, don't you? Of course you do!) Also, throw away herbs that you have used within 6 months or a year. Throw away spices that you haven't used within 1 or 2 years. (Maybe less depending on what it is.) If you don't have access to good quality herbs and spices at your local grocery store (and, trust me again, you almost certainly don't), you need to buy them from  urlLink Penzey's Ltd .  Don't refrigerate your potatoes or your bread. They taste better if you keep them at room temperature.  Grow your own food if it's at all possible. You can grow very nice tomato and pepper plants, for example, in big pots on your deck or balcony. Likewise, herbs, leaf lettuce, radishes, and lots of other vegetables all do quite nicely if grown in a big enough and/or right-sized pot.  Don't use those nasty supermarket "fresh" tomatoes unless you absolutely have no other choice. Have you noticed that they wax them? (At least, I've assumed it's wax... God only knows.) They've got this weird hard coating on the outside to keep them from bruising during shipping and on the inside they're never as ripe or good-tasting as their red color might lead you to believe. I use canned tomatoes for almost everything. Canned tomatoes taste better than fresh tomatoes purchased at the supermarket. (What a weird state of affairs that is, eh?) And they haven't got that icky waxy junk on them because they were processed right after they were picked. You can get organic canned tomatoes. Yummy. Which leads me to...  Buy organic vegetables. They cost a fortune. I know. But at least you have a better chance of knowing sorta-kinda what went into producing them.

      Tonight we're having one of our favorites: A big tossed salad and boiled potatoes. That may sound like a strange meal to you but you'll be surprised by how delicious and satisfying it is.  The Salad It varies from time to time, of course, depending upon what's available. Tonight it contains iceberg lettuce, baby spinach leaves, sliced radishes, diced tomato, sliced onions, and pecan halves. (I got a really good price on a big bag of pecan halves at BJ's Wholesale Club this past winter. I store them in a plastic bag in the freezer and just take out however many I need. They've held up really well this way.) Serve the salad with whatever dressing you prefer. For me, it's blue cheese. Mark likes italian.  The Boiled Potatoes ...are just that. Just plain old boiled potatoes. I serve them hot. I usually put butter and salt and pepper on mine. (Mark doesn't like butter--yes, he's very weird--so he just has salt and pepper.)   I usually have a glass of wine with dinner, too. Lately I've been enjoying Rosemount Estates Cabernet/Merlot blend. Pretty good stuff for $6.95 a bottle. (I think that's what I paid for it last time.)  Bon Appetit! (And may Julia Child find peace and a banquet in her honor in "the clearing at the end of the path")

      Not-Meatloaf  Ingredients 1 package Morningstar Farms "Ground Meatless Crumbles" (This is available in the frozen foods section of most major grocery stores in the US) 1 small onion, diced tomato ketchup 1/4-1/2 cup olive oil 1/2-3/4 cup dried bread crumbs or matzo meal 2 eggs (organic from nesting, free-roaming hens please!) garlic powder to taste salt to taste pepper to taste  Preheat oven to 350 degrees (Fahrenheit)  Mix everything but the Meatless Crumbles very well in a large bowl. The Meatless Crumbles come frozen in a plastic bag. Smack the bag around on your kitchen countertop a few times to break up the crumbles. You don't want any really large chunks. When they're smashed up enough, mix the entire bag in with the other ingredients. Stir really well to mix thoroughly. Put the mixture in a greased loaf pan, pressing it down and into the corners of the pan. Squirt more ketchup onto the mixture and spread it out with the back of a spoon to cover the top of the loaf.  Pop it into the oven and bake it (on the middle rack) for one hour!  When it's done, take it out of the oven (of course) and let it set for about 5 minutes before cutting it into slices for serving.  Not-meatloaf is particularly delicious with mashed potatoes and/or apple sauce on the side

      As anyone who's spent any time reading blogs can tell you, there's a  huge  ego component to blogging. The blogger must assume that her life is interesting enough that other people will want to know about it. She must believe that what she writes is entertaining and/or educational.   I figure that if you're reading this, you're the kind of person who'd actually like to know what I had for breakfast this morning.   I've been really big on rice lately. I got a great deal on some 10-pound bags of basmati rice at BJ's Wholesale Club about a month ago and I make a batch of it probably once a week. Here's how I make it: Put 2 cups of rice in a pan. Rinse the rice a couple of times under running water. Pour off the extra water from rinsing. Add 3 cups of water to the pan. Stir. Bring to a boil over high heat. Once it's boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer and cover the pan. Let it simmer covered for 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Let it sit for a few minutes. Eat.   That's it. Easy.  This makes enough rice to last one person about a week.   Here's what I had for breakfast. It's a fried rice kind of thing...  Chop up a small onion. Cut 4 or 5  Morningstar Farms  Veggie Bacon strips into half-inch pieces. Heat a couple teaspoons full of olive oil in a big frying pan over medium heat and toss in the onions and veggie bacon. Put 2 or 3 big spoonfuls of rice on top of that and kind of flatten it out so it covers the onions and veggie bacon. Put the cover on the pan and let it cook for...oh...10 minutes...however long it takes for the onions and veggie bacon to begin browning. Stir it up then to distribute everything evenly. Make sure to get most of the rice down onto the heated side of the frying pan and the onion and veggie bacon up top where it won't burn. Cover again and let cook for 5 minutes or so. Stir it all up again and toss a small handful of grated cheese on top. Cover it again and let it cook 5 minutes or however long it takes for the cheese to melt. Add ground pepper and lots of salt.   This is a very good, nutritious (well...relatively nutritious) and filling meal. After this breakfast I usually don't need anything to eat again until dinner time.  Oh...use a non-stick pan for this recipe because otherwise the rice will stick like crazy and you'll have to really scrape to get it out of the pan.

      [This was posted to the main site on 7/22/04. I'm re-posting it here because it fits.]  Dirty Dancing (washingtonpost.com): " This year's version of the Roomba is the slightly tweaked second generation of a product line that debuted in 2002 and has sold, according to iRobot, more than half a million units."  And I am the proud owner of one of those half million units! I have owned a Roomba (a robotic vacuum cleaner, in case you didn't know) since...last Christmas, I think it was, that my husband gave me one. Ours is one of the earlier models that doesn't automatically go "home" to its recharging station when it's done cleaning. Also, ours was produced before they worked out that people don't want to have to get a screw driver in order to take the thing apart to clean it.   I have to admit: I sorta want one of these new and improved Roombas! I do use the one I have--but probably not as often as I would if it were easier to charge and easier to clean. So...   The Roomba does clean pretty well. And it does, in fact, save me some time. I very often will be cooking in the kitchen while Roomba is vacuuming in the living room.   The dog is terrified of Roomba. Most of our cats are curious about it but not particularly afraid. The best animal-reaction came from our cat, George, who is an unusually aggressive beast. George is accustomed to having people and other animals back away from him. It was most amusing watching his reaction when Roomba not only didn't back away--it sometimes went right towards him! You could almost hear him thinking, "What the fu....?!?!"

       urlLink   Earlier this year I happened to be in the local Safeway and noticed that they had a big set-up for Passover related stuff. I always look at Passover stuff because that's when the biggest selection of kosher products is available. I like kosher products for a couple of reasons. First, if it's a dairy sort of thing, you can be  sure  the company didn't slip any meat into it. It's amazing the things a company will put chicken fat in, for example. Amazing and disgusting. Like they're doing you some kind of favor by sticking parts from dead animals into your food. Thanks, but... NO. The second reason I like kosher food is because I figure that people who take their religion seriously enough that they want to keep kosher are people who are more conscientious about their jobs. So... maybe they're less like to spit in your food or let bugs get into it. Stuff like that. This is probably just a happy fantasy that I tell myself, but...hey...it's MY happy fantasy and I'm sticking with it.  Okay. Matzo...  So, the Safeway had this big display of Passover products that included big cases of 5 or 6 boxes of matzos for only something like $8.99. It was such a good deal...and the paper wrapping on the boxes was so  pink  that I bought a case. I gave one box to my sister. And I ground up a couple of matzos from another box to put in not-meat-loaf (recipe to follow some day.) The other boxes, though, are still sitting in my cupboard.   Does anyone have any good recipes that use lots of matzos?

       urlLink Former President Carter's Remarks to the Democratic National Convention (washingtonpost.com) : " After 9/11, America stood proud -- wounded, but determined and united. A cowardly attack on innocent civilians brought us an unprecedented level of cooperation and understanding around the world. But in just 34 months, we have watched with deep concern as all this good will has been squandered by a virtually unbroken series of mistakes and miscalculations. "  If only Jimmy Carter's presidency hadn't been tainted by events over which he had no control... If only people had listened, really  listened , when he tried to get this country on track for developing alternative energy sources. If only... We certainly wouldn't be in the shape we're in now-- fighting a war which, despite the pronouncements of the spin-meisters, pretty much everyone with more than two neurons to rub together realizes is about  oil .  Of course  it's about oil! If it were about human rights, we'd be spending our tax dollars cleaning up the outrageous conditions--stuff that's worse than anything Saddam ever did--that exist in some other countries. If it were about "weapons of mass destruction", we'd be invading North Korea. (And what a crazy move  that  would be.)   Jimmy Carter was always too good for the presidency. His honesty made him vulnerable to the attacks of less honest, less honorable people. Goodness does not always win the day, unfortunately.

This actually comes from a Salon interview with writer, Jim Knipfel. I haven't read any of his books, though they sound interesting. This bit about the alien/scorpion hybrids is just a throw-away mention in the interview but it fit in so well with yesterday's mutant lizard thing that I felt compelled to include it here.   If nothing else, read the Salon interview and then consider getting one of Mr. Knipfel's books.

       urlLink Salon.com Life | "Isn't she a little young?" : "A new public service ad campaign in Virginia uses billboards and bar coasters to remind men that sex with a minor is against the law. But will it work?"  Okay...maybe I'm naively optimistic about the general intelligence level of Virginians, but...is there anybody who is capable of  reading  these billboards and bar coasters who really doesn't know that screwing children is illegal? (Not to mention immoral!) I mean...come on!   Okay, so the article quotes an official as saying, "We agreed that people who are going after children 12 and under are not going to be fazed by a billboard campaign". Later, the article quotes another official: ""Statutory rape is a significant public health problem nationwide," says Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. "A large percentage of births from young women can be from older men.""  Hm. Okay...I hadn't thought about it but I suppose that's quite possible. It's interesting, though, that Mr. Benjamin says, "births (...) can  [emphasis added] be from older men." Apparently, they don't really know. I suppose most of these underage pregnant female aren't telling (or don't know) who the father of the child is.   I wonder whether these ads will really make a difference, though. Do men who screw around with teenagers really take seriously the possibility of jail time--much less the immorality of the relationship? (Isn't any 'relationship' where one party takes advantage of the other party's emotional immaturity immoral?)  The Salon article continues: "One of the goals of the campaign is to urge men to start talking to each other about the reality of statutory rape -- to remind each other that dating underage girls is against the law. "If he hears it from enough of his friends, hopefully he'll change his behavior," Odor says. Billboards and bar props seemed like the best way to reach groups of men when they might be meeting up with friends or going out for the night."  Sounds like maybe it's a reasonable approach after all.  (Oh...if you're not already a member of Salon Premium, you'll need to watch a short 'commercial' before you can read the entire article on their web site.)

      We have four cats: Mickey and Marjie, who are from the same litter; Lucy, the cutest of the group; and George, The Beast Of Terror. Mickey and Marjie were adopted from a cat rescue outfit where they'd been kept in a cage since they were young kittens. Apparently as a consequence, neither of them ever learned to jump  up  onto countertops. The whole idea of jumping that high is just unimaginable for them. A lot of people would be thrilled to have cats who won't/can't jump up on the kitchen counters but to us it just seems weird. Lucy, who is now about 14 years old, came to me as part of a litter needing a home when I lived in Minneapolis. I adopted her and her brother, Roy. Roy died a few years ago from cancer. Lucy remains healthy, though, and we hope she sticks with us for many more years. She's very small for an adult cat and she likes to curl up in a little ball on my lap. George showed up in our back yard one day. My mother was still alive then and, at the time, I was thinking of getting her a cat to have as a pet. (It seemed like a good idea at the time. The truth is, she never liked cats all that well.) At any rate, here was this cat in the back yard so I figured I go check him out. I sat on the deck stairs and waggled my fingers at him and called him over. Sure enough, over he came. I was surprised to find that he had been let outside to roam even though he was declawed. I was  appalled  to later discover that he is deaf! Can you imagine leaving a deaf declawed cat outside to fend for himself?! He'd clearly been out for a while, too. His paws were rough and dirty and his fur--which turned out to be almost entirely white--was dirty. Poor little guy. Well...he wound up living with my mother for a few weeks but when she was hospitalized for a long time I decided to just bring George home to live with us. George is a great cat. Really he is. He just hates all other animals and tries to kill them if given the opportunity. So...George lives upstairs in the master bedroom "suite" and he seems to do just fine.    The dog is Ashley. She's an elderly miniature dachshund who was adopted by my mother about 3 or 4 years ago. Ashley had belonged to an elderly man with Alzheimer's disease. The man's son told me that his father had reached a point where he no longer recognized Ashley as his own dog. He'd say, "I don't know whose dog this is." He wouldn't feed her. So...Ashley wound up being boarded at our vet's office with a sign up saying they were looking for a new home for her. My mother really needed a pet and Ashley turned out to be the perfect match for her. The last couple of years of my mother's life she had this sweet little dog to keep her company and to keep her motivated. We always figured Ashley would wind up as our dog and, as it turned out, once my mother started spending more time in the hospital than out, Ashley came to live with us full-time. She is a good little dog. Even if she does sometimes bark too much.

       urlLink The Rake - Hardcore Corn : "For me, it was Corn Days in Long Lake, where our corner was prime squatting for the parade, my sister was a Corn Princess, and for two days you could eat all the corn you could handle for $1.50. "  I don't think I ever knew Stephanie March, the author of this piece, though I might be wrong about that. I've forgotten so many people over the years. I am also from Long Lake in Minnesota, though. Long Lake is part of Orono, you see. While, I didn't actually live  in  Long Lake, it was the closest thing to a town that was near by. Actually, I grew up in a house that is situated pretty much halfway between Long Lake and Crystal Bay--both part of what was then the Village of Orono. My mailing address was Wayzata, though. It was all very confusing. It still is.  I may have forgotten Stephanie (or not), but I haven't forgotten Corn Days. I was there when it was first starting out as a church-related festival. It's apparently still put on by the local Catholic church--St. George's.   I don't remember the corn being all that delicious. I think a lot of times they just used field corn--the kind you feed to livestock--instead of actual sweet corn. The idea being, I suppose, that if you slather enough butter and salt on it, pretty much anything will taste good. It doesn't hurt if you've also already made a few trips to "Das Biergarten" before digging into the corn.   I wonder if they still have the Polka Mass during Corn Days weekend. I never went--wasn't Catholic at the time--but I always wanted to. Just the idea of it...a Polka Mass...intrigues.  For the most part, my Corn Days activity was limited to Biergarten, eating corn, and maybe dancing like an Egyptian at the big street dance they usually had on Saturday night. One year though I got to be in the parade! Oooooo! My then husband, Chad, was trying to start up a solar panel business (he was, alas, way ahead of his time) and we kitted out his truck with solar panels and solar-related decorations and such. We dressed up an acquaintance's cute little kid and called her the "sun princess" and rode in the parade. This was more than 20 years ago but, amazingly, every now and then when I'm back in Long Lake I'll run into someone who mentions it. Hm.

That's very troubling that he would use such a homophobic way of trying to put down legislative leadership,' said Kuehl, one of five members of the Legislature's five-member Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Caucus."  If that's an "image that is associated with gay men" then I say gay men ought to seriously re-think the images they associate with. Gee...let's see...is "asshole" an image associated with gay men? State Senator Sheila Kuehl is an idiot and I very much doubt that she's qualified to comment upon the "images" gay men associate with. "Girlie men" is an amusing term used to describe men who don't measure up--physically, or in terms of bravery or character. It's clear that this is the context in which Schwarzenegger was using it. He said, ""If they don't have the guts to come up here in front of you and say, 'I don't want to represent you, I want to represent those special interests, the unions, the trial lawyers ... if they don't have the guts, I call them girlie men..."

It's because Sharon--probably with some justification--accused the French of being anti-semitic. The French may be intolerant of minority religions (and if you doubt that just do a little investigation into their "anti-sect" laws and the French ban on Muslim women and girls wearing head scarves (hajib)), but at least--so far--they haven't put up walls and barbed wire to keep the Muslims in "their part" of the country.

      I've been thinking about this whole Anti-Gay Marriage Amendment thing a lot over the past few days and I'm hugely relieved that it didn't pass in the Senate. Quite honestly, I'm still not sure what all the fuss is about. Why are some people so offended by the idea of gay marriage?  Do they think homosexuality is perverse or morally wrong? Considering that history clearly shows us there have been homosexual humans for as long as anyone's been keeping track--thousands of years--it's obviously a normal, though relatively uncommon, variation of human sexuality. Any concerns about the morality of homosexuality are based in religious teaching. I have absolutely no objection to people believing whatever religious teachings they want--but LAW should be blind to religious preferences.   Do people fear homosexuals? Do they believe them to be more prone to child molestation or other crimes? Research has proven this fear to be unfounded. Homosexuals are no more likely to molest children than are non-homosexuals. Do these people think gays are going to make unwanted sexual advances on them? The very idea is ridiculous. Gay people--like any other people--want to be accepted. They are not going to hit on someone they know is straight because they don't like being rejected any better than you or I do.  I fully support the right of religious groups to deny sacramental marriage to gay couples if that's what they want to do. LEGAL marriage, on the other hand, MUST be an option for gay couples. Just laws MUST be based upon humanist values rooted in individual rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Denying the tax and other legal benefits of marriage to gay couples is just plain wrong. It is, I believe, unconstitutional!  If there's going to be any constitutional amendment regarding gay marriage at all, it ought to be one that GUARANTEES the right of legal marriage to gay couples in every state.

There's a guy there--Steve (a mutant desert triffid, in fact)--who's been doing an ongoing fiction project called "Diary" for about a year now. It's really an excellent read...all about the every-day life of a fellow who's survived a plague that killed 99.99999% of the population. Great!  There's another fiction project called "The Journey" by Matov. It's got a similar premise to Steve's "Diary" but is set in England. (As is Matov, himself, from what I understand.) "The Journey" is also a really fine read, though Matov hasn't added anything new to it in a while.   There are other fiction projects on the BB web site but these two are my favorites.

       urlLink David Moody - Horror and Science-fiction author - creator of the AUTUMN living dead novels   I've read a couple of this guy's books: Autumn (which is available on his web site (above) *for free* and Autumn: The City. They're both quite wonderful. Now he's coming out with Autumn: Purification. You can bet I'll be sending him some money to read that one, too.   One of the things I particularly enjoy about David Moody's books is that they're so engaging that I often find myself thinking, "that's not what I would have done...I would have got rid of the zombies by..."   I'll leave you in suspense for now. My zombie-extraction method is complex and requires more time to describe than I've got right now. Suffice it to say: the method involves a long blunt stick.   Check out David Moody's web site. Read Autumn. Prepare for the coming zombie invasion.

       urlLink Flying Pig Soapworks   I created this web site for my sister's business. She makes all of the products herself. By hand. Even the labels on the stuff. It's really very nice stuff--and I'm not just saying that because she's my sister. Truly. I would spend my own money on this stuff. It's that nice. Luckily, I don't have to because--as the webmaster--I get pretty much whatever I want for free. There are perks, you see.  My particular favorite products here are: Bath bombs...they're like giant "fizzies" that create bubbles and smell really good. Lotion bars...I've used the rose-scented one. It's almost all gone. I need more. It smells just incredibly wonderful.   I don't use lip balm much so...I don't have a strong opinion about that.   I've never tried the body mists...gotta get me some of that.  The soaps are very nice. But..you know...how much soap can you use? I suppose for a person who takes LOTS AND LOTS of showers...  Whatever. This is good stuff. Go to the web site. Buy this stuff. You'll be glad you did.  Go do it now.

      So I'm trying out yet another blogging option. Blogger. As in  urlLink BLOGGER . The advantage of this option is that I can blog from any computer using any operating system and the blog will be uploaded to my own web site. That's mighty convenient. Supposedly I can even email in blogs--though if I've got access to a computer for emailing, I don't know why I wouldn't just be able to go to the blogger web site. I suppose...  Anyway. I think this may turn out to be the way I want to go. It's easy. It's attractive. And it's free. Free is good.  Let's see what happens.

        urlLink No Pain, No Gain (washingtonpost.com) : "These are the sorts of shoes that tempt a woman into recklessness. Like scoundrel boyfriends, vodka-soaked olives and flourless chocolate cake, the shoes have little redeeming value other than a delicious, fleeting pleasure."  Say what? There's certainly no physical pleasure involved (unless one is of the masochistic bent) in cramming an innocent foot into one of those too narrow, too unstable contraptions known as a "fashionable" shoe.    I've been meaning to write about this for a while now. What  is  it with lots of women and  shoes  anyway? I understand that a few people were traumatized somehow when they were children and, as a consquence, can only get off sexually on feet. These folks fall into the same category as those guys who like to dress up in their mother's underwear. It's sad, but it sometimes happens. That's why it's all the more a mystery why so many women insist on fetish-izing their own feet! I mean it...how  weird  is that?!?! They're  feet  for Pete's sake! Don't get me wrong. I don't have any particular problem with feet. I don't think they're dirty or anything. They're just...feet. They're what you walk around on. They're...functional. Not particularly attractive. Not hideous-- but not the sort of thing a normal person would want to pay special attention to.   So then, what is it with lots of women and their feet? They dress them up with nail polish and goofy "toe rings" and crap and then cram the poor things into horrendously uncomfortable and, frankly, stupid-looking shoes and hobble around town like this.   It doesn't make any sense. I simply do not believe that the majority of men have a foot fetish and can only get excited by a woman who does this. My own experience as a woman who has  never  done the whole shoe thing has shown me that most men really don't give a shit one way or another what kind of foot-gear a woman is sporting.    So...women are objectifying and sexualizing (and torturing) their own feet for no good reason.   That's just bizarre.    My own favorite shoes, in case you're interested (and of course you are!) are black canvas numbers I got at Wal-Mart for 2 bucks a pair. They're comfortable. They're not made out of dead animals. And they're inexpensive. That's all I need from a shoe, thank you very much.

       urlLink Powell's Books - Review-a-Day - My Life by  Bill Clinton, reviewed by The Atlantic Monthly : "A reasonable semblance of soul-searching was what Knopf paid him $10 mil for, and it's certainly true that My Life features damp wads of much more intimate pseudo-introspection than, say, Eisenhower's memoirs -- not that I've gone back to check. ('What caused my hostile feelings about German armored divisions? Mamie, years of therapy -- and okay, golf -- helped me face the truth.')"  I'm almost certainly not going to read Bill Clinton's magnum opus but  you  should absolutely read Tom Carson's very amusing review of it.   Another tease...  "Saluted long before she actually appears, Hillary, by the way, is simply and grandly "Hillary" from the start; the Titania-and-Oberon aspect of this is delightful."  ...as is Tom Carson's prose, I might add.

          Today was my first day as a volunteer at the Meadowlark Botanical Gardens in Vienna, Virginia. It's one of those truly wonderful places that, on the one hand, you want to tell  everyone  about because it's so great but, on the other hand, you don't want to tell people about it because then it might get crowded.   Fortunately, Meadowlark charges an admission fee and that scares a lot of people off. Plus they have very firm rules about not messing with any of the plants and there are lots of volunteers (people like me!) surreptitiously floating around in the background most of the time to help enforce the rules.   I'm a horticulture volunteer so I'll be spending my time working with the plants. Today I helped transplant seedlings from their "group" pots into their own individual little pots. Next week I could be dead-heading flowers out in one of the gardens or weeding somewhere or... who knows. One of these days fairly soon my "boss" is going to wade into one of the lakes to remove some or all of the giant lotuses that are growing there. I wouldn't mind helping with that... it sounds like fun! (As long as one of the snapping turtles or giant catfish-like carp doesn't take after me!)   I'm really looking forward to spending time at the Gardens. I'm happy to be helping support such a beautiful place, of course, but I also get a chance to satisfy some of my intense gardening and nature-type urges.   This morning, when I pulled into the side parking lot where volunteers enter, there were two fawns (still with spots!) eating grass next to the lot. Pretty cool...pretty cool, indeed.

Truly, her site--along with  urlLink the townhall.com site  where she's a featured columnist--are the sort of things that make you want to take a long hot shower with strong soap and...maybe a brillo pad. I guess I should have known when I noticed the name Ann Coulter among the list of columnists at townhall.com that I was going to get dirty.   Malkin, Coulter, and their ilk are the sorts of people with whom you either agree (in which case you are almost certainly some variety of "really stupid") or disagree. You can fault me here for not specifically addressing any of their ideas. Fine. It's true--so this blog entry is hereby officially dedicated to mere scorn. I have subscribed to Malkin's blog feed now, though, so you can be sure that, as it comes to my attention,  I'll occasionally be challenging her particular brand of nuttiness.

       urlLink Blog Interrupted (washingtonpost.com) : "'She's a sign,' says Daniel Yankelovich, the pollster and analyst who has been studying American values for 50 years. He means a sign of our times, as is Jessica's frumpy 21-year-old contemporary, Pfc. Lynndie England, whose gleeful mugging for the cameras as she mocked naked Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib unsettled the national conscience. Both women have left many people questioning: How did we get here?  "Jessica's 'behavior is not mainstream majority behavior in the same way that most soldiers in Iraq are not abusing people,' Yankelovich says. 'She's an extreme, but she's a sign. These kinds of signs are breaking out often enough that you know they are signaling something much larger and more important.'"  This is from a Washington Post article about blogster Jessica Cutler who lost her job for posting explicit blog entries about her sexual encounters with other Washington worker-bees.  I'm astonished that anyone--much less a "pollster and analyst...studying American values for 50 years," who you'd think would have a better sense of perspective--could compare the exploits of Ms Cutler with that of prisoner-abuser, Pfc England. There is simply no comparison. If there have been periods in history when sexual "misconduct" among consenting adults was equivalent to engaging in torture of prisoners, those times are long  long  gone.   The story of Jessica Cutler is one great big  SO WHAT . She screwed around with co-workers, some of them married.  So what.  She then wrote about her adventures in her blog.  So what.  I'm not sure her behavior even qualifies for being called immoral at all. It was, perhaps, in poor taste.   Yankelovich says Cutler's an extreme. What planet is he living on? Sure, juggling six guys at once had to have been tricky. Maybe that's what he means. Most young women can only manage 2 or 3 at once. ;-)   The Post articles goes on: "Feminist author Naomi Wolf agrees, and says modern sexual conduct offers a window into what's been gained and lost in the nation's values revolution. The sexual revolution, now stripped of much of its feminist political ideology, has left legions of young women free but confused." Cutler doesn't seem confused to me. She seems like a young woman who enjoys sex. Again, I say,  so what?    Sex between consenting adults used to be something that people got all upset about. People used to get all confused--thinking that there were real moral issues attached to different sorts of sex. Aren't we  over that  by now??? Aren't we past that, people?!? Good grief! Get a grip! It's  sex !! It's not hurting or killing people!   In the Post article, Wolf says: "The downside is we've raised a generation of young women -- and men -- who don't understand sexual ethics like: Don't sleep with a married man; don't sleep with a married woman; don't embarrass people with whom you had a consensual sexual relationship. They don't see sex as sacred or even very important anymore. That's been lost. Sex has been commodified and drained of its deeper meaning." Whoa. Hold everything, Nellie. The woman who sleeps with a married man has possibly demonstrated poor judgement. If anyone in that scenario has behaved immorally, though, it's the  married man  who sleeps with the  single woman . It's the married person, after all, who's presumably made a committment to remain sexually faithful to one person. As for embarrassing one's partner(s)--again, we're looking at a judgement or maturity problem, not a morality issue. And for the idea that sex is sacred or has deeper meaning...that's a completely subjective thing. Subjective and situational. Sometimes a walk in the woods is an experience of the Divine. Sometimes it's just a hike. I wouldn't presume to say that no one should be able to go hiking just because they're not having a transcendent experience every time they lace up their boots.   More from the Post: ""This vulgar little episode reflects a larger, disturbing media trend toward normalizing and glamorizing sexual promiscuity among young working women," [Michelle] Malkin wrote in an online column titled  urlLink "The Skanks on Capitol Hill," which was posted on the townhall.com Web site. "It harms those trying to succeed on their merits in the professional arena. And it also harms our own daughters, who will be forced to fight harder to protect their dignity and credibility in a 'Girls Gone Wild' culture.""  Jeesh. Get real. These people are ridiculous. And scary. Don't you get the feeling that they're trying to shove their version of morality down your throat?   Yankelovich continues: "The usual model for societies is that they have a very thin layer of law and a very thick layer of social morality. What this expressive individualism has done, as an unintended consequence, is weaken that layer of social morality to the point where it's almost disappeared."  If you've been reading any of the stuff I've recently posted about communitarianism, this all ought to ring a very familiar--and disturbing--bell.  If your individuality allows you to enjoy sex with multiple partners and  gasp!  write about it online in amusing detail then you are an immoral "skank".

      Okay... so it hasn't escaped my attention that some of my recent posts could be mistaken for being anti-semitic.   I want to assure you all that I am not anti-semitic. Neither am I a Holocaust-denier. I believe the Holocaust happened and I think it was a horrible and monstrously immoral thing. No people should be persecuted solely because of their religious beliefs or their cultural background.   Having been the victim of a Holocaust does not, however, give a people a no-expiration free pass to do whatever they want.   If you insist on labeling me, I suppose you could call me an anti-zionist. Does Israel have a right to exist? I guess that depends upon what you mean by "right" and "exist". If Israel's existence relies upon persecuting the Palestinian people then... no, I don't believe Israel has a right to exist.   Why do so many Americans support Israel in spite of its criminal behavior towards the Palestinians? I think it has everything to do with guilt and--amazingly--anti-Semitism. I think people in their innermost thoughts go through something like this: 'Oh my God! We were denying them (Jews) membership in our country clubs and then the Nazis went and actually rounded them up and started killing them! Oh my God! I must never never NEVER ever again do anything that could even remotely be seen as anti-Semitic because, if I do, people might think that I actually  approved  of what the Nazis were doing!'   Get over it, people. The Holocaust was 60+ years ago. If you're anti-semitic, you should be ashamed of yourself and stop being that way. If you're a Holocaust-denier, you're an idiot. (And you should be ashamed of yourself and stop being that way.) People need to look at the situation as it exists  right now .

Sent by the British to the big island down under, criminals and other kinds of "undesireables" did a fair job of cooperating to build their own supercolony.  Must be something in the water.  Still, a 62 square mile ant colony under the city of Melbourne is something to get excited about! And these aren't just any old ants--- they're  mutant ants !   Australia is strange. It has more deadly snakes, insects, spiders, and sea-creatures than any other place on earth. You've got to love a place like that.

Eleven-year old Safwat Saqer said, 'Sometimes I am late to school. I get angry at the soldiers because they turn back sick people who are going to the hospital and sometimes they do the same to us children. I wish I had a gun so I could attack them all. Kill them, not leave any of them alive.'"  Checkpoints and walls with barbed wire to keep people in or out of the cities in which they were born... in which their ancestors were born... It sounds like something the Nazis would have done, doesn't it? Sort of like the Polish ghettos?   If a young Polish Jew in the late 1930s had talked about killing the guards at a Nazi checkpoint in such a way, we might have praised him as a budding freedom fighter.

       urlLink Powell's Books - Review-a-Day - Imperial Hubris: Why the West Is Losing the War on Terror by Anonymous, reviewed by The Atlantic Monthly : "But Anonymous will draw the most fire for his cogent arguments -- contrary to both Democratic and Republican leaders who orate that Islamist terrorists hate America because of its freedom and values -- that al-Qaeda and the Islamic world hate this country because of its specific policies and actions, and that bin Laden's war against America (which, Anonymous asserts, has made him the Muslims' most admired figure) isn't an act of rage; rather, it aims to alter those policies. Accordingly, Anonymous advocates a combination of stronger military action against Islamist terrorists and insurgents (although he understands the grievances that fuel al-Qaeda, he's convinced that 'we are in a fight to the death' with it) and -- crucially -- 'dramatic foreign policy change. ' "  Read the entire review. Then get the book. (I'm going to look for it at the library.) I don't know about the idea of stronger military action against terrorists and insurgents--I'll have to think about that for a while. I completely agree, though, that the United States needs to withdraw its support of Israel and seriously re-think its support of the governments in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan.  Not only that...just who in the hell do we think we are, trying to shove democracy down the throats of people who don't have any historical or cultural predisposition for it?

       urlLink Washington's Road to Outward Growth (washingtonpost.com) : "But the real-life price for the vast majority of residents is a daily commute that takes about an hour or more. "  I have to admit that this article is a bit confusing to me. The writer seems to think that commutes of over an hour are unusual in the greater DC area. Ha! Ten years ago when we lived in Manassas (significantly closer to DC than West Virginia, in case you didn't know), Mark's commute from DC to our home was regularly over an hour each way--sometimes it was close to two hours. Even then, the trafffic on 66 was slow. It would be half an hour on the metro from Crystal City to Vienna and at least another half an hour in the car on 66 from Vienna to Manassas. It's still this way.   Lots of people living much closer to DC than West Virginia already spend over an hour each way commuting. The only reason the West Virginians have such a  short  commute is because there aren't many of them yet--their roads aren't as congested as ours.

       urlLink Planners' Brains vs. Public's Brawn (washingtonpost.com) : "'Smart growth is something people want,' said Marsha McLaughlin, Howard County's planning director, who had supported more homes on the property. 'They just don't want it in their own neighborhood.'"  When I first moved to Virginia about 11 years ago, we would sometimes drive on Fairfax County Parkway past the neighborhood where I now live. It was beautiful--the parkway wasn't used much and there were acres of woods and streams surrounding it. I wanted to live there but it was too expensive for us. (My husband was still in the Navy then.)   When we bought our townhouse here 8 years ago it backed up to woods where we often saw foxes and raccoons. One day I looked out my livingroom windows and saw a buck eating from the bird feeder tray in our yard!   Of course it couldn't last--not here in Fairfax Virginia where the economy is doing just fine and new people are arriving every day. When the bulldozers came I pulled the shades down in our livingroom and didn't look out again for a month. It was just too depressing--not so much because of our loss of privacy. I kept thinking about all those thousands of animals--deer, foxes, raccoons, oppossums, snakes, turtles, birds, and more--who had been killed or displaced because of the new "development" that was going in.   We got lucky, I suppose. It could have been a lot worse. They left a strip of land about 150-200 feet wide between our neighborhood and the new development. And, when I compare our neighborhood of townhouses with the newer neighborhood...I'm glad I'm where I'm at. Our neighborhood is unusual. Our townhouses are sort of a Cape Cod style--not the faux Colonial that the vast majority of townhouses in northern Virginia affect. And our streets are curvy and we have green spaces with mature landscaping. Our neighborhood is far FAR nicer than the new neighborhood that's behind us. And the new townhouses were  expensive  so the values in our neighborhood have skyrocketed. Still.... I'd rather have the woods back. I'd rather have the foxes and the deer.   Until telecommuting becomes common, though, I suppose they need to put all the people somewhere. Our area ("Fair Lakes") has been well planned out--all things considered. We've got some ponds (they're not really lakes) with walking paths around them. There's all the shopping and restaurant options you could possibly want within very short driving distance. There's mass transit--metro buses in the immediate area and a park-and-ride nearby and the Vienna metro train station relatively nearby. All things considered, it's pretty well done. Even so, Fairfax County Parkway has become so congested that there are plans (once the funding is available) to add another lane each way and to create an overpass at Fair Lakes Blvd so the traffic won't get backed up anymore there. I guess that's a good thing.   So...I'm kind of rambling here and, if you're still reading, you're probably hoping I'll just make my point and get on with it. I guess my point is this: We've got to re-think this whole thing. Neither of the current options is good. Spread people out, but destroy more wild habitat in the process? No good. Cram people together, and preserve wild habitat? Also no good. (I don't like being crammed together with other people. I don't like other people's children running around in my yard. I don't want to look at other people's crap in their backyards. If I don't like it, I'm sure lots of other people don't like it.) See? Neither of these options is any good.  We've got to re-think the whole thing. Spread people out, yes. But spread them way WAY out. Put some of them in North Dakota and Montana, for example. There's lots of space there. And get going on this telecommuting thing. Most of the people who live in Fairfax do white-collar type jobs that they could do  anywhere  if they just had the proper telecommuting tools.   I think the federal government should take the lead on this thing. The reason most of the companies that are in this area are  here  is because the federal government is here and they want to be close by to facilitate face-to-face meetings. If the feds moved to telecommuting for most jobs, though, there wouldn't be a need any longer for the contractor companies to locate in this area. They could be anywhere since they'd be meeting electronically with their government contact people.   There are  so many  reasons why a move to telecommuting would be a good idea! Reduced population congestion, reduced pollution from cars.. and just think of how much more difficult a terrorist target a telecommuting federal workforce would be!

       urlLink Salon.com News | Contract to torture : "In a still-classified sworn statement, she also admits to hearing other interrogators instructing the military police to abuse prisoners, and once witnessed Spc. Charles Graner slapping a detainee. Asked why she didn't report Graner, Spencer told investigators that she didn't know that what he had done constituted abuse. That's not surprising given her level of experience."  Bullshit. She had experience being a  human being , didn't she?? There is no excuse--save severe mental illness--for the abuses that occurred at Abu Ghraib. (That is not to say there is no explanation--simply that there is no excuse.)  The blame isn't all hers (Army Spc. Luciana Spencer), though. She and many of the others assigned to interrogate prisoners at Abu Ghraib were not experienced or mature enough to handle the situation there. Each individual there had a moral and legal responsibility to refuse orders (or "suggestions") to abuse prisoners. That so many did not refuse tells me two things: There is an apalling lack of conscience among these young people and there is a frightening unwillingness or inability to take responsibility for their own actions. Being a morally mature person requires not only knowing what's right--but doing it.

       urlLink Salon.com Arts & Entertainment | How does Tom Cruise rate? : "At a certain point -- maybe because I stopped expecting anything from Cruise -- he stopped seeming so annoying."  Salon writer Charles Taylor is a better person than I am. Not once in this article did he mention that Tom Cruise is a Scientologist. I'm fairly certain that I'll be saying something at least mildly insulting about Scientology before I'm done here.  Tom Cruise is still annoying to  me  and it's not just because he's a Scientologist. I can't understand this guy's popularity. He's not particularly attractive. Really-- he looks like a guy who's spent tons of money eliminating his uni-brow and looking as good as he possibly can and...it's not enough. It's just not there. He has the kind of sloping forehead and beady eyes that--to me--immediately say "sleaze-oid". And he's a crappy actor. He has one expression that he uses every time he's trying to convey deep emotion of some kind. You've all seen it. He stares off into the distance with his mouth half open and a kind of "duuuuuuuuuh" expression on his face. This is the limit of Tom Cruise's ability to appear sensitive.   Obviously there  are  people who must think he's got something going. He's certainly made enough money. All I can say is that it's a sad testament to what people are willing to spend their money on that this guy is doing anything other than caddying for some rich country club bitch.   Okay...and if you need any additional evidence of Tom Cruise's status as a complete loser, consider the fact that he's a Scientologist. Scientology, folks, is stupid. People who stay involved with Scientology any longer than it takes to find out about the OT levels are stupid. (Don't worry, faithful readers, I'll go into detail about the OT levels some other time.)  Yes, he's rich. Yes, he's stupid.   Okay...enough about Tom Cruise. Well...one more quote from the Salon article: "...in his climactic scene in "Magnolia," crying over his dying father, played by Jason Robards, I almost felt sorry for Cruise; there he was, shaking and crying and emoting, and Robards, playing comatose, completely outacted him."  Yep.

       urlLink Salon.com Technology | Ask the pilot : "Excavated from the rubble of Sept. 11 could have been, and should have been, a crucial and instructive lesson beyond the expected hand-wringing over security and preparedness. Specifically, a call for American citizens to broaden their horizons and develop a smarter sense of the world's mechanisms and conflicts. Instead, we appear to be growing even more insular, myopic, and unimpressed with the fact that large numbers of people despise us for reasons a tad more complex than 'they hate freedom.' It's a path we follow at our own peril, and it is exactly opposite to what global tensions mandate. We can't tell the difference between an Indian, a Tibetan, and an Islamic radical. More to the point, we don't seem interested in learning what those differences are."  This is a continuation of an earlier Salon story about Annie Jacobsen--the WomensWallStreet.com writer who was frightened by a group Syian musicians who were on the same flight with her.   WomensWallStreet and their reactionary pals at the Washington Times continue to play up this non-event as though it meant something other than that people need to just chill out and get a friggin'  grip  on themselves.   Read the entire Salon article by Patrick Smith. It's really well written and he makes excellent points that desperately  need  to be made.

       urlLink Salon.com News | "It was just for fun" : "Private Lynndie England is said to have shown no alarm when confronted with pictures of her gloating over naked and cowering Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib."  Is she the same person in that one horrible photograph of a woman smiling and giving a 'thumb's up' to the camera next to a burned corpse? I read somewhere that her parents (that person's, if not Private England's) explained that their daughter felt very comfortable around corpses so they didn't see this as a particularly big deal. Apparently, her father--a homicide detective of some kind--would bring home crime scene photographs and the whole family would gather 'round the dining room table to discuss them.  Amazing, isn't it? No wonder she apparently has no ability to understand that her actions at Abu Ghraib were immoral. Her sense of right and wrong became twisted when she was still a child.   I quit looking at these abuse photographs after the first few. It was simply too disturbing. It's not just the images themselves that are upsetting-- it's what they represent. I have no doubt that I am naive and, at times, a bit of a "polly-anna".  No matter how awful the reports of happenings in other countries--things like the Taliban stoning women in front of a crowd at a soccer stadium--I always took comfort in my belief that here in America, we're better than that. We don't torture people.    I really believed that.  Not any more...  I don't believe for a minute that this Abu Ghraib abuse was an isolated incident--the work of a few out-of-control soldiers. I believe their superiors knew what they were doing and approved of it. And I believe that the superiors of the superiors knew, too. I don't doubt that military officials--perhaps all the way up to the top--knew exactly what was going on and approved of it. Worst of all, I've got a feeling this sort of thing has been going on for  years and years  and I just never suspected it.

       urlLink Friendly Fascism: The Political Implications of Communitarian Ideology by Valerie Runes : "...Bush's advisers consulted on the writing of the speech with leading communitarian thinker Robert Putnam, who has suggested, 'this administration is doing some surprising things' (Milbank 2). Perhaps most surprising to those who value civil liberties and the Constitution was the USA PATRIOT Act.."  If you've ever asked yourself what kind of twisted philosophy could inform the policies of people like George Bush and John Ashcroft, the answer is: Communitarianism. I'm guessing that many people have never heard of communitarianism. I'd never heard of it before reading this paper by liberal smart-person and trouble-maker, Valerie Runes. Apparently, though, communitarianism is  the  hot idea in political think-circles these days.   It sounds good on the surface. Who could be against stronger communities, right? Kids keeping in touch with their grandparents...that's a  good  thing! But don't let the soft fuzzy exterior of communitarianism fool you. Ms Runes explains it well: where our Bill of Rights is based on the idea that people have certain rights just by virtue of being individual human beings created by God, communitarians say ~all~ rights derive from the community in which a person lives. When I look at this from a sociological/anthropological point of view, it seems to make sense. Sure...rights come from cultural values. Our culture values children so we don't have a right to make our kids work in a sweatshop to help support the family. Sounds good... And I'm attracted to the idea that God will be out of the picture in determining what a person's legal rights will be. It  sounds  like that's what the communitarians mean. But, NO, that's not what they mean. Quite the contrary! It's the view of prominent communitarians that American culture is in fact Christian and that, as such, the rights afforded to American citizens should be in line with the values of "our" Christian culture. Want an easy "no-fault" divorce? Forget it. Prefer that your children not be required to pray in school? Tough luck. Scarier yet, since these rights would no longer be seen as inviolable (given by God), they could be taken away or otherwise amended at any time as the leaders of a communitarian government decide the needs of the community have changed.    Truly spooky stuff.  Comparisons have been made between fascism and communitarianism and, without a doubt, there are parallels between the rise of European fascism in the 1920s and 30s and some of what's been going on in the United States since 9/11 (see  urlLink this review of  The Coming of the Third Reich   by Richard J. Evans at powells.com for an interesting discussion), but how far are Americans willing to let the communitarians go? In Germany, fascists came to power during a time when the economy was in ruins. Are people willing to give up individual rights to privacy and expression as long as profits aren't affected?

       urlLink Salon.com Books | God wars : "Is the upsurge of faith in America and the West a glorious spiritual reawakening, or a barbaric superstition that must be stamped out? Two opposing new books turn religion into a heavyweight brawl."  The nature of The Creator is unknowable.  The true Religion is that which inspires people to behave lovingly (creatively) towards all other beings.  Simple.

      Okay...so one reader asked (yes, it was my husband): If a shark ate one of the zombies that fell in the ocean, would the shark itself turn into a zombie?  Answer: I don't know and it doesn't matter. Unless the sharks learn to fly like those fish in the movie "Pirhana! Part Two: The Spawning" (which is a truly great film, by the way.)   Anyway, stop and think about the defining characteristics of a zombie (besides it being dead, I mean): It's relentless and without conscience. And the defining characteristics of a shark....?  Uh huh. Now you get it. How would you even be able to tell the difference between a live shark and a zombie shark? (Except for the chunks of dead shark-meat that would occasionally fall off the zombie shark as it swam around... I wonder if a zombie shark would eat its own shark-meat chunks....? hm...)

      Do you ever wonder how long it would take a zombie to decompose to the point where it'd no longer be able to walk around menacingly? I figure the rate of decomposition will vary depending upon general climactic conditions. A jungle-zombie wouldn't last long at all. Before you could even say "Yuck! Get out of here!" it would already have decomposed into a disgusting stinky puddle of zombie-goo. One place you absolutely would NOT want to be during a zombie invasion would be a desert climate. In arid conditions a zombie would just dry up and get really tough on the outside. A tough zombie is a dangerous zombie.  Do you ever think about what kinds of strategies would work best for getting rid of zombies? In British zombie books (the one's I've read at least), they never seem to think of simply shoving the zombies off a high cliff into the ocean. Why is that? They're on an  island , for Pete's sake! Many zombie stories mention that the zombies are particularly attracted by sounds, so here's what you do. You set up a very loudly amplified boom box right next to the cliff where you and your zombie-hunter pals are waiting. As the zombies approach the cliff, you simply shove them off with a long stick. It shouldn't be a  pointy  stick because that could just go right through a particularly ripe zombie. You need a long pole with a flat board of some kind nailed on the end. A zombie-shover. Or...how about this. You find a nice OLD barn filled with dry DRY straw. Douse liberally with gasoline. You rig up the loud boom-box on a cable so it would be up too high for the zombies to reach. Wait for many many zombies to gather inside barn. Light the match. Poof! (More like KA-BOOM!...but you get the picture.)  See...the reason  I  will survive a zombie invasion and you won't is because I actually spend time thinking about these things. It's good to be prepared!
