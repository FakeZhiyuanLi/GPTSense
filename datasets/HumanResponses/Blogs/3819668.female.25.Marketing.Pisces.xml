      Beleive me, if you really apply yourself to this business, you will earn a lot!! I just came back from our regional conference and one lady has sold over $6,500 dollars worth of retail this month!! That is $3250 in her pocket because once you hit $6,000 in a month you make HALF the profit!! So that right there proves how much product people are willing to buy.  I am just going to run through the basics with you:  First off, I make 40% commission on all the merchandise I sell. Most of my parties average $500-$800 so I make around $200-$320 per party and I have about 5 parties a month. So I take home $1000-$1600 per month! My parties are around 4 hours with drive time factored in so that equals $50-$80 dollars per hour just from parties!! Think about this, I get paid to party and talk about sex!  I also make a commission on what the people who have signed up under me sell! Eventually, I will be making 5% commission on every girl under me, every girl under them and every girl under them!!! THAT is where the REAL money starts to flow in. For example:  You sign 15 girls up; they each sign 2 girls up; and they each sign 2 girls up. You then have a total of 105 girls in your "down line" Lets say they each have one party in a month that has total sales of $500. Since you would make 5% off each of their sales and their sales together are $84,000 you would get a check for $4,200!!! Thats per month!   Now that may not seem like a lot but take into consideration that MOST parties are $500 dollars in sales if not a lot more and women usually do more than one party a month. So letâ€™s look at their next month:  They each had 3 parties (still low) averaging $500 per party. Now their total sales are $157,500 and your 5% check is now worth $7,875!!! Remember, that is not including the money you actually WORKED for at YOUR parties!! So, so far in two months you have made $2,000-$3200 on your parties and $12,075 on your down lines sales, for a total of $14,075-$15,275!!! Pretty good deal huh?  To get the most out of your business you want to invest 10 hours a week for marketing and parties so about 40 hours a month. Divide that all out and you are making $351.87-$381.87 dollars PER HOUR!!!!!   So, the real question is, since I have shown you exactly how much money can be made in this business are you ready to start now or do you have further questions?
