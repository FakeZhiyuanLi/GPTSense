      You'd think with all the advancements in optics and micro-technology that somebody would have developed the beer corrective-lens to phase out those clumsy goggles.  Isn't it about time that not only the other person looks good, but so do you?

      So I'm in the restroom parting ways with my morning coffee when I realize that I am actively being discriminated against.  All of our men's restrooms are equipped with these fancy-schmancy flush-free,"hygienic,"urinals,     urlLink http://www.falconwaterfree.com .  Basically, the premise of these things is that you piss in a hole of oil and the piss is more dense so it sinks below the oil...that way it doesn't smell.  However, there is still piss-residue on the inside of the urinal!  What is discriminatory is that this company does not make water-free "sitdown" toilets.  Unfortunately, this means that women are not able to help save the environment when they piss, but TRAGICALLY and more importantly, this means I'm not afforded my God-given right to piss in a piss-free toilet.  What happens if I piss at the wrong angle????  I could get splashback! And not only is it my piss coming back at me, but it's also the remnants of piss from every other male that pissed in that toilet before me!  How degrading! The emotional stress that incurs everytime I have to relieve myself is overwhelming.  I think the only thing that can even remotely alleviate these irreparable damages is a multi-million dollar settlement; for both the emotional damage and a few pairs of those Docker's Stain Defender Pants.

      When you blow your nose and the tissue doesn't hold.  I know they hint at that during commercials, but they should just really show people with a bunch of snot on their hands.  That way, all of us consumers would look at that and say "Yup, I know exactly what they're talking about."  It happens to everybody, and what's worse, we lose at least 30 seconds to faulty tissues.  That may not seem like much, but if it happens to everybody, then that's 9 billion seconds lost by the population of the US.  150 million minutes, 2.5 million hours, 104,667 days, 285 YEARS lost to faulty tissues.  Imagine the lost revenue!!!  The government really should step up and regulate tissue manufacturing.     And don't even get me STARTED on toilet paper...

      So I get in my car this morning and the trip odometer reads 666.6.  Now usually I'm not superstitious, but to begin my friday with such an ominous sign, I did the only thing you could do in such a situation.  I drove as fast as I could 0.4 miles to give the old middle finger to satan or whomever put those damn numbers on my car.  I don't care if the prince of darkness has some grudge with me, he can take it up with me tomorrow.  Don't fuck with my Fridays.

      That's my new thought for a TV show.  Get some boring, blackhole o'fun guy who never drinks, liquor him up (with fruity drinks if you must), then tape him.  Perhaps give him a series of "physical challenges" kind of like Double Dare, but with more nudity and profanity.  Leave the slime though.  Gotta have the slime.  There must be a market for it, I mean shit, there's a reality restaurant show on tv.  I haven't seen it but I really could care less who can properly torch a creme brulee. I say we get back to the days when tv was fun and controversial, like when we couldn't figure out if Jonathan from Who's the Boss was gay or not.  With "Beer Eye" people would hang out at the water cooler, or coffee pot, or whatever else you hang out at just so you don't have to work, and debate whether Joe from last night's episode really knew he was hitting on a transvestite or whether that was just the beer goggles....you know, something with real, contemplative substance.

      So get this!  In the past few days I have received three emails each telling me that a separate long lost relative and his family died in a car accident in Nigeria.  The kicker is that each one was a multi-millionaire!  I don't know what gods are looking down on me, but damn, I have to be the luckiest rich man in the world!  Three guys I never knew each meeting the same horrible fate in the same location roughly around the same time?  I should play the lottery too!  On a related note...What kind of moron thinks that I'm going to fall for this sort of scam.  Yes, I realize that there are other morons that fall for these morons, but seriously.  What lawyer is going to contact me by email and not even leave a phone number?  Wait, I guess there are moron lawyers too. Shit, there goes my argument.    Anyway, to all my friends...It was nice knowing you.  I'm going to be moving away to some little land of my own soon.  If you want to get ahold of me, you can email my lawyer.

      You know, it's nice to see that the world's biggest gazillionaire is also the  urlLink biggest philanthropist , but the guy's worth like $43 billion, and he only donated $600 million?  While it's still a shitload of money, he could give at least $1 billion and not even feel it.  Perhaps, though, it would deplete his vault enough that he would no longer meet the depth safety requirements for that diving board he installed for swimmming in all his dough.  So I guess we should blame the safety inspectors instead.  Damn the man keeping us down!

      So my friend just sent these pics from the Women's right to march or whatever it was in D.C. a couple of weeks ago.  There were a couple of pics I thought I'd post and comment on, just because I feel like if I was there, these would have been the comments I would have made.  (Disclaimer:  In no way am I commenting on women's rights, just utilizing my right to make snide, off-hand remarks).     Doesn't she mean Clinton?      Now, I'm pretty sure Jesus wouldn't touch these women with his 10-inch pole, so what are they worried about?

      So everybody who's anybody has their own blog and since I want to be somebody, or just anybody, I'll join everybody in this endeavor.  So what am I gonna post?  Who knows, but I found that it's a good way to procrastinate.  Besides, I come up with all sorts of random tidbits of enlightenment when I know I'm supposed to be doing something else, so why not make you all dumber by letting you read it?  Anyway, you know that random shit that crosses your mind but you always filter out and never tell anybody?  That's mostly what I'm gonna put here.  I figure in the end, the world needs more dumb people.

      So I've never felt as lonely as I do now....sitting day in and day out, alone in my house, working on this damn exam.  Sure I go to work, but there's something wrong with going to work to get away, you know?  What makes it worse is that all my friends are doing the same exact thing, so there is no escape for the next two weeks.  Just reading, and writing, and reading, and writing.......I think you get the point.  Having all this time gets my mind wandering, thinking about why I'm doing this.  That's the scary part...I'm not so sure.  I sit back, close my eyes, and think about my dreams.  Not the simple "I want to be a doctor" but those mental images you produce, the snapshots of some future event many years from now that you keep with you, that you use as a reminder of how you want things to be and what you're working toward.  I don't know why it took as long as it did to realize it, but my dreams, those mental pictures I've been carrying with me for several years and have worked hard to achieve, aren't going to happen.  They're empty.  Sure they can be modified, but it's not the same.  They were a culmination of a series of pieces, like a puzzle I suppose, and when you're missing just one piece, it isn't perfect any longer.  What's the point of the puzzle, if it can't be completed?  It's a strange feeling, not having any dreams.  It's a hollow feeling, a void, like I have no purpose, or goal.  It's a temporary situation, I guess, but one I have never actually encountered.  In a way, it's interesting.  At this point in my life, I'm no longer trying to get the pieces to acheive my dream.  Instead, I already have some pieces which allow me to build dreams around them.  Unfortunately, major pieces are missing, but I suppose this presents an extraordinary opportunity.  I guess the question is: will these dreams be as good as before?  And all I can say right now is, I don't know.....that was a damn good dream.

      So I've finally have all of my stuff moved into my house.  It's still a little disorganized but at least I know where everything is.  Unfortunately, I've discovered that the worst thing about moving into a place alone is not having cable hooked up.  I get home at night and my only option is to watch PBS, which gets a little old....especially when all they cover is Ronald Reagan.  One day of that stuff is enough.  Anyway, I've found some solace in my new friend, Ed.  Ed's the spider that lives in my bathroom underneath my cabinet.  The only reason I have not relocated Ed is because he was living there before I actually moved in, so who am I to kick him out?  Besides, it's comforting to see him there when I get up in the morning.  I've discovered that having a spider as a friend is nothing like that book, Charlotte's Web.  First, Ed doesn't spell cool shit in his web.  He doesn't spell anything.  In fact, the only shit coming out of his web is HIS shit, and it kind of litters the floor underneath.  One advantage of spiders though is that their shit doesn't stink...at least I don't think it does.  I have yet to get down there and take a big whiff, though.  Ed doesn't say much, either....especially anything wise or enlightening.  However, I swear I heard something the other day tell me I needed to cut my toenails.  That's just like Ed.  Not very smart but he's always thinking of others.  It's too bad all spiders are not like Ed, the world would be a much happier place.  Here's a picture of Ed with his breakfast that I took with my new camera phone.  Really, it was just an excuse to use the camera, but if it immortalizes Ed, then all the better.

      So I took the afternoon off yesterday to do a little home improvement and stopped by Lowe's because a little voice told me to the night before......ok, so it was Gene Hackman on the TV but it was damn convincing.....anyway, so I'm in the store, pushing my cart through the aisles when I stopped to look at some bathroom cabinets.  Now, I usually consider myself a very courteous cart driver and always move my cart far over to the right, which is what I did, even though I'm the only one in the aisle.  I then proceed to check out the cabinents when a rude voice behind me says "excuse me, you're in my way!"  I turn around, astonished that somebody is actually that rude and say "pardon me?"  It is then that I see this BEHEMOTH woman in one of those little electric carts.  So, after my eyes shift to superwide angle, she says "I'm handicapped and I can't get by your cart."  Usually I sympathize with the morbidly obese, but this lady picked MY aisle to simply cut through, then proceeded to rudely request that I move my cart because her fucking fat ass can't walk around a damn store, ALL WHILE INHALING ONE OF THOSE LARGE BAGS OF PEANUT M&Ms!!!!  This is what killed me.  That's like me walking around on crutches claiming to be handicapped while beating myself on the kneecap with a hammer.  So I politely say "well, my cart's pulled over as far as it goes."  She then says, NOT asks mind you, "well, push it to the end of the aisle" even though I'm about midway through it.  Naturally, this flipped my pissed off switch (which usually never happens) so I say, "doesn't that thing have reverse?" and then she says "well I want to go forward."  So then I say, "what, do you want me to fucking climb the shelves with my cart on my back?"  Keep in mind, I have no Sherpa blood in me whatsoever.  I now see that she's either about to throw her thirty pounds of M&Ms at me or eat me for a midafternoon snack so I grab my cart and storm it down the end of the aisle.  Then as she past me I told her I hope those M&Ms go straight to her arteries.  Needless to say, I didn't buy any cabinets.  Instead, I went home and had a beer.  Never has a stranger pissed me off so much.  I feel guilty because I know I should feel bad but I actually did hope that as she drove her cart off one of those M&Ms would find a way to her heart and plug it causing it to explode.  In fact, I still feel that way.  Then, when she arrives at those pearly gates, find out that they're not wide enough.  THAT would be sweet justice.

      After several draining softball games and a weekend spent moving all of my heavy shit, I think it's about time to wind down, relax, and break out a little of THE man.  No, I'm not talking about the Captain, though usually after a few swills of his Private Stock Rum, by Captain's Orders of course, I'm definitely in a more relaxed state.  Nor am I talking about my friend Jack D., though time flies when you've got him and a little cola around.  Perhaps you thought I was talking about Mr. Clean, with his shiny bald head, manly biceps and gold pirate earing.  I can see how you may come to this conclusion as just looking at that guy makes you just want to just kick back on the couch, knowing that his secret, deep-cleaning formula is doing all the work for you. But alas, Mr. Clean is for another day.  No, I am talking about the man that envelops you in a warm sudsy blanket, the man who's soft aroma whisks you to a far away world where aches are the red-headed stepchildren and they're beat more often then a teenager with a Sear's catalogue, the only man I will allow to blow bubbles around my intimate areas.....  Yes, I think it is time to break out Mr. Bubble.
