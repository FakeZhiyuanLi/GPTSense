       urlLink    This is some of the view from our cabin. The fjord is mirror-still (blikkstille) so you get a pretty good reflection of the mountains. And that boat on the right is 'Hæxa' (the Witch).

      It is hard sometimes to be an international man of mystery. All the travelling has it's obvious disadvantages, although the lab tells me they've almost completed the teleporter beam. It should seriously cut back on time spent in airports, and therefore save a lot of money on overprized foodstuffs. But I cannot help but wonder where I will find time to read books and magasines.. The bigger problem is having a name with norwegian letters in it, as they do not translate easily. The obvious solution to this is to adopt a few foreign names. My norwegian name apparently means 'one who works the earth', a farmer. The british equivalent to this would be George, which also means farmer. Fortunately George has several well known foreign   "translations": In Spain it is Jorge, and i Catalunia it is Gorka. Any other translations or comments would be welcome, in case I need yet another local name on my travles ;)

       urlLink    Yes, I am a night-time hero, for sure! This is from may 16th, the day before our Constitution day, when one traditionally go out for a drink or two. Only to induce a marvellous hangover on the day itself. An added bonus is all the kids in the streets, screaming for icecream and baloons...&nbsp; urlLink

      So I got myself set up a blog - what now? Hehe, I guess time has come to figure out what i want to put on this page. My guess is there will be a few pictures every now and then, with comments. Other than that, I have no clue... This is more or less an experiment at the moment.

      So I've finally put up a small photoalbum from the summer 2002 in france with Becky and the family. I've only put up some of the better looking ones and some edited ones. It was a brilliant holliday with plenty of sun and even more beer :)

      So I've got this rss-feed up and running *crossing fingers* and figured there should be a link on my blogpage somewhere. But I won't be doing any "quick fixes" while I'm in Tromsø, so I'll just post a temporary link here:  urlLink

      Here are some pictures from when Becky and I went to Umeå to visit my grandparents. It was a nice trip, even if the weather wasn't quite brilliant all of the time.. Oh, well - at least we got the honor of opening the holiday season in the house.
