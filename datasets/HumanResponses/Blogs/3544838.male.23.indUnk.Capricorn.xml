      Its my bebe birthday.... Mmm... dun really know if she feel happy anot....Haix. It was a pretty hectic day. Nothing seem to be right. First i gotto go for some movie trailer stuff but then i was late cuz cant wake up... bad bad - my fault *sorry*. By the time we started filming in NUS, it was abt 1330hrs already. We r already rushing for time and thus everything have to be done pretty chop chop but with professionalism. We tried our best and put in our very best effort to make it work. Everything seem to be in place until a freaky phone call rang at abt 1630hrs... was it a ghost? Nahz... it was actually the *CEO* of the company. He din like it so it has to be changed. Well nothing against it but before we start filming all this shld be approve first right? It is basically a waste of time and money. Imagine the effort put in by the director? - as well as all the co-workers? = The top will never understand wad the men r doing until they r doin it themselves = In any case I gtg cuz i gotto meet my dear... cuz its her bday. *Happy Birthday*. Well i m suppose to meet her at 1630hrs... but then i have to inform her to meet later becuz of the filming. (How do u like when its ur bday and u have to wait for the other party... and esp ur bf/gf to come?) Of course will be angry rite! Yah... haix i feel so bad.(I m sorry dear) Guess from today on i beta stick to my own decision... dun care too much abt pple. Cuz u cant make everybody happy! Choose very carefully... There will be opportunity cost , sarcrifice tat u have to make. Why do something tat amounts to nothing? Though there r times tat u need to do smt important or attend to ur career but spending time wif ur spouse/ love ones is equally important. Thus be sure to spend time wif them and never let them down. Because they are the one tat really appreciate u. Many others are juz hypocrites. When they need they will come to u... and then talk behind ur back. But nevermind , learn to ignore (esp those bootlickers and wayang champions) LoL~

      man~... sometimes life is so tough! When u tried all means and ways to do something right, it somehow ended the other way round. Life is meaningless and bleak. Darkness surrounds an empty soul. How will we emerge from this negative and selfish society? The best answer yet again can be found from the bible - believe it or not. (read it for urself) The Bible says tat Love is the greatest. And we r commanded to love one another juz as ourself... so Love. I praise God for all His teachings and everlasting Love for us.

      A camel and an elephant met, and the elephant asked: "Why do you have your tits on your back?"  >  >The camel responded: "What a silly question from someone who has a dick on his face!"
