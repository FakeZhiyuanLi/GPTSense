        urlLink     My parents have to understand that I tread two disparate lives....that there are two facets to the Robin Chan enigma. At times I may seem callow, incorrigible or unfledged--and rightfully so..I'm just a 15-yr old trying to live my life on par wth everyone else in this harrowing, not to mention, carping society. They have to realize that at the end of the day I decide how I live and what is perceived of me in all walks of life. If we're ever going to subsist in this house, there has to be some sort of middle ground...don't you agree?     *indignant sigh*    Please feel free to comment with any word of advice you might have..   urlLink

        Here’s a conundrum for all you avid and ardent gamers out there……do you think a console controller is a conduit of L33tn3ss rather than an immerse piece of equipment?    Penny for your thoughts on this…

        urlLink     Of course, I would love to mingle with my all-male fanbase....but wouldn't that defeat the purpose, if you get my drift. Come on, give me a break..I'm practically dancing with wolves!   urlLink

        I was recently scammed by a girl during an online gaming experience; she had touted to upgrade my garbs for, get this, free!!! In retrospect I should've known something was awry, but I guess deep down I wanted to believe there was truth or at least some sort of intrinsic verity in her words, logic need not apply--I was duped. Nary a loss....I suppose. Suffice to say, that I'm quite resilient and hence able to bounce back, no pun intended, from my lack thereof. If you really think about it, the charlatan did me a favor; mmorpgs are an infintesimal, even trivial, part of life anyways. Deviating from the matter at hand (on a lighter note), I finished  No Second Chance  by Harlan Coben, a book I was currently reading. Well, let me just say what a convuluted consummation for a book with more plot twists than a coaster! And the implications of a father-daughter bond theme pervaded in a subtle yet villifying manner..  a real page turner at that    ~one tough cookie~

        urlLink       In the interminable scheme of things, I have always been intrigued by urban legends and any other paranormal phenomenon. I have also found dreams a rather fascinating matter as well. How would one manipulate a lucid dream? What do dreams portend? What do recurring dreams mean?    Feel free to e-mail me with any tidbits concerning this topic.....   urlLink

        I apologize in advance for altering any of my existing blog entries--you see, I accrued a capricious or fickle disposition over the years…however you have to admit hindsight is 20/20

        urlLink     In my flurry of profoundly heart-rendering thoughts, I mused over two questions Why do I repel women (especially the cordial ones) ? And why is it that I can't help but admire another guy's ripped abs? I don't belong to a crime syndicate nor do I teeter on the precipice of sexual reticence.....   urlLink
