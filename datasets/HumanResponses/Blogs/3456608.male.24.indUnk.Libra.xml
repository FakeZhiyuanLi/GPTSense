      I reckon as you get older time goes faster. I remember being in primary school and if there where 4 weeks to the holidays it would seem like an eternity. now 4 weeks goes like lightning, thats only two pay cheques!  gotta go get the train.

      Lunch. Thats a pretty funny word if you say it heaps.  I'm playing indoor netball tonight, Our team is called 'The Michael Bolton Experience', last season it was 'The Kenny G Perm Explosion'. We go for the bad muso names. Next season it's going to be something to do with Craig McGlachlan.  I'm having a pretty bad day today because Like the title of my last entry, Council People are wankers. They're retards that don't know how to do there jobs. They make my job really hard.

      Work is done for the day. I'm now waiting for the train, sort of, I'm at the office for about another 10 minutes.  I'm not really sure about this whole blog thing. I don't know who would ever read mine, or how they would find it. Its not like its funny.......Yet. Wait for it.

      As the title suggests I'm waiting for some guy to call in regards to driveway conflict as stated in RTA Guideline 6.2.2. Riveting stuff.  Plans to go to the Haze later, I'd live there if I could. I love those guys!

       urlLink www.homestarrunner.com   I've gotta say, this is the coolest website...... Possibly in all of time. Strongbad's email replies are like nothing else, and by that i mean there is possibly nothing funnier. Ever. What are  you  gonna do about it! Go there and laugh you hands off!

      My computer had the sasser virus and I just got it fixed today, it cost me $35. That's shit!  But on the up side my home computer now works so I don't have to do this at work as much, which I'm sure will please the boss. Not that I would be wasting company time cause I did it in my breaks anyway.  It's a long weekend which is heaps good. I don't have plans yet, I'm just going with the flow. Hopefuly that flow takes me somewhere fun!

      What can I say, I've had a really bad day. Not bad for me personally, just bad, like I've been retarded and haven't got much done.    I'm going home to pitch the idea of a blog to Zoe at the Haze and see what she thinks.

      This weekend two of my friends got drunker than I had ever seen them before. That was pretty funny. On Friday night Kathryn wrote herself off completely at Robey and spewed a few times. She is THE loudest drunk in the world. On Saturday Abbie, playing a drinking game called Trunket, got so drunk it wasn't funny, and it wasn't funny, just annoying.   So, I think I'm gonna start one of these things for our excursions into a smokey haze at The Haze. It is bound to be funny, how can it not be?! "He died by sneaking around.........Forget I said that".

      Sanity, the CD shop seems to have gotten rid of the alternative music section. I assume they've intergrated it into the rest of the music. It was bad enough before cause Nickleback and Linkon Park and shit like that was classed as alternate, but now I'm gonna have to search though  all  that poppy bullshit to find the stuff I want.  Its Friday, the start of the weekend. I just got a credit card so tomorrow I'm going shopping to buy a heater and a pair of ug boots.

      You heard me. How bad is mainstream music? And commercial radio for that matter. I just had to work down in the other office for an hour or so and they listen to a dumb mainstream channel. We on the other hand listen to Triple J. The only channel worth listening to. Except the one I happen to do a show on.............But then that one's only good when I'm on.  Yes, I have my own radio show.

      So, Now it's sunny and warm which is excellent, good balcony weather.  We have this balcony at work which looks out over the street. We get to see some pretty funny things when we are out there having breaks. In particular, people trying to parallel park below us. There is this pole right next to the Kurb and heaps of people back into it trying to park. Some people are so bad at parallel parking it takes them maybe 6 goes and they still end up about a metre from the kerb. SO funny to watch!  I should be working.............I'm bludging. I bet bosses all over the world hate the internet for the amount of time employees waste doing crap like this.

      I thought this thing would only last me a couple of days and I was kind right.  There's not that much for me to write about. I couldn't be fucked writing everything I do in here that'd get boring real fast. I'm still figuring out exactly what this whole thing is going to be about.  It's raining today, I like rain. Also it's not cold which is heaps good, I hate the cold  SO  bad.   It's possible that I might be getting my hours cut back at work because we are entering a slow period. That'd be shit, I need the money.

       Yeah, I went to Splendour In The Grass last weekend, I had such an awsome time. The bands weren't as good a last year but the company this time was perfect.      I only missed a couple of the bands I wanted to see.      Here's what I saw:     Xavier Rudd    Franz Ferdinand    Spiderbait    Electric six    1200 Techniques    Ozomatli    Ash    Hilltop Hoods    Jurassic 5     Franz Ferdinand went off so much it wasn't funny, I've never seen anything like it before. The only band I was disappointed by were Electric six. They seemed like a bunch of posers, which sux cause they were one of the bands I was most keen to see.    We stayed in cabins at a caravan park, we didn't end up camping which is good. On the Sunday night we all sat up talking till we got told to shut up by the manager of the park, turns out we were sitting outside his house or something. That conversation had some weird drug induced topics like ewoks and I don't remember what.    I went out last night and had a pretty crazy night, I met this chick who was at Splendour called Zoe. I can't be bothered going into details about this but what followed was weird, it involved my friend Zoe and this other Zoe getting an email from some guy who met a Zoe from the uni out one night and then sent an email to every Zoe at the uni to track her down. The Zoe I met last night was THE Zoe from the email. My crappy story telling abilities don't do this story justice.

      Ok, I'm at a radio station doing a radio show. It's called Funk and Acid.&nbsp;I'm on my own tonight so I thought I'd update this thing.  &nbsp;  The guy that does the show before mine is such a mainstream wanker jock. He always runs into my show and tonight he was playing this shit metal and it was running into my show so I faded it down and started my show. He was all "What about the listeners man?" What about mine Wicksy, ya fuckin' wank. your show ends at 11 not 5 past. Go on cry in the car on the way home cause you suck at radio and sound like a tool when you open your mouth.  &nbsp;  I hate that Mother Fucker!  &nbsp;  On a brighter note I'm going to Splendour in the Grass this weekend Franz Ferdinand, Jurassic 5, Electric 6.... I'm so keen. I'm leaving on Thursday night with a bunch of friends and coming back Monday. It is going to be the best road trip ever! We are camping so chances are it's going to rain, but I reckon that'll just add to the experience.&nbsp;

      I've just spent the last hour watching cartoons at urlLink  www.homestarrunner.com . I can't get enough of those crazy cartoons. How can anyone be that funny? Surely it's against the law.?!  I woke up this morning and thought it was a week day and I had to go to work. Then I realised it was Saturday, I love that feeling. I slept in till 11. Yeah  I've also been looking for some other blog that would be cool to read but I haven't found one yet that interests me enough. To many depressed people make these things and talk about how crap life is. C'mon, life is good, even if it is boring sometimes.  I'm gonna go hang with friends.

      Today I haven't had much to do at work, it's abit quiet at the moment. I've spent the morning researching Professional Indemnity Insurance. Woo Fucking Hoo.  After weeks of having nothing in particular to do on the weekend I have been invited to two parties on Saturday. Conundrum. One is a suit party (wear a suit), the other is an 80's party (wear the shitest thing you can find). I think I'm gonna go to both, I'm not at all keen on the 80's so I'm just gonna wear a suit. A cool suit, 70's, flares.  I wonder when people are going to start having 90's parties? Parachute tracksuits! YEAH!..................... YEAH! ....Wait a sec...... NO   Lunch break just ended.

      It's the start of July and yesterday it was 23°. This is the middle of winter I bet it's probly about this hot in England right now and it's summer there. So, anyway, me and my flatmates took advantage of theexcellentt weekend weather and went and flew a kite and kicked a soccer ball around in the park. Who my age flies a kite these days? Me and my flatmates I guess. Maybe we could start a trend, like how young people love lawn bowls now.  Some chick in Sydney got suspended from school for some 'provocative' photos she had of herself in her Blog. I tried to have a look at her thing but it seems to be gone. These blogs have got a few people in trouble I think.   Splendour In The Grass  is in 3 weeks. YES!

      Kenny G is back and in championship winning form. The Return Of The Kenny G Perm Explosion is the name of my indoor netball team. Last weekend we won the Championship and we are back for another waz at it this season. I rate our chances.  Like I said before, I got an iPOD. It is so fucking cool. Now I listen to music everywhere I go. It's a 15Gb one and I've only filled about 3.5Gb so far.

       Tomorrow two friends of mine are going to New Zealand, then America (BOO), Then England / Europe. They'll be gone for two years or something.      On Friday night someone threw something at my car while I was driving and smashed my windscreen. Now I have to get a new windscreen and that is so crap. Why would you do that to someone. It's such a dumb thought.      Last night my flatmates and I talked about what would happen if the train going past across the park exploded or turned into a giant dragon train, with wings and talons. And it lifted off the track up into the air then turned and swooped over us. Then, if you try to shoot it down carriages fall off and turn into mini dragon trains.      Then we had Apple Pie and Apple and Berry Pie and Custard and Whipped Cream and watched the end of Ocean's 11.      Today I went on a site visit for work and at this house they had this clock with a heaps 80's picture of John Farnham on it. It's the funniest thing, I bet they're so proud of it. He has the  biggest  mullet in the world. MAN.

       I am so hungry I could eat something, like the sugar packet I found  in  my hot chocolate today at Grind. No wait, not that hungry, and why was that even in there. "woops, I dropped a packet of sugar in this dude's drink,........Oh well."      But I am really hungry. I want cake or a muffin. Chocolate or blueberry (muffin). No, Caret cake. And a Milo or a steak, I'd like a steak, and pasta, carbonara or something.

       The Watts Breakaway by The Johnny Otis Show is a really good song. Get it and listen to it.  I was only going to do the show till midnight but I'm enjoying myself too much to stop now. 24-Carat-Black by The 24-Carat-Black is playin' now, such a sweet break.  I had a sick day today and even though I actually am sick I had a good time. I went op shopping, hung out with friends and got a hair cut then went out for tea. My fringe is now abit short but it'll grow.......right?!       Bring on the juice, Bring on the juice, Bring on the juice, Bring on the juice, Bring on the juice, Make me sweat.      James Brown - Funky Drummer      I don't know how Clyde Stubblefield does that for the nine minutes or whatever of this track. It sounds so effortless.
