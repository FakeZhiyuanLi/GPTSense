      I love that word. Ponderings. If you break it up you get pond, like lake, eh, like oh, ring like disaster. Because wedding rings do tend to end up in disaster. So pondering is like dipping into a lake of disaster. Mmmm. Maybe if I shut my eyes I'll be able to feel the waves washing over me, hear the delicate ripples as leaves fall into my pond and breathe in the air of immortality. If the Philosophers Stone is a soluble tablet, my lake of disaster is the solution for it. Like in chemistry. I dreamt the other night that I was in a cold, dark lake and that I was below, watching the world through a rippled mirror. I saw myself peering down and a white hand slooshing the water and slooshing my view. When it was finally clear again, all there was was a star that lit up the lake. And in the middle of the star, there was me, spread out in a crucifix shape with my eyes blazing and my hair fanning out like it does underwater. I reached out to feel the wetness on my hair, but I felt only heat as the star plunged into the icy water and I melted into oblivion. I love random dreams.

      Hi, I'm Tash and this is my random blog which I created for two reasons. One is because I was bored, two because I wanted a gmail account and three because I decided the world needed to hear the random Ponderings of a Nutcase. So thats me. The nutcase. I live in New Zealand in a house with a cat and a dog. And I like to be random. And my pet peeves are French keyboards, the sounds MSN makes and jingle singers. I mean who really puts on their CV, 'Ah yes, that's me. I sang in the Felix Catfood jingle.' ??? Also, I don't like Bush. At all. And I don't like Micheal Jackson because he has a dead nose and sings like a sick hippo. There are lots of things I do like though. I like melted mozerella, the number 666 - just a random thought but if there is an apocolypse, wouldn't it happen on 06/06/06? Just a random vibe - and I like redheads. I love shopping. Shoe shopping. But I hate French keyboards and porridge. I think that is enough randomness for now. More later. Tash P.S. If anyone has a gmail account they don't want well... lets just say I know a taker...
