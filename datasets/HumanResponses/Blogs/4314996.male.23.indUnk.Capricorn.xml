       *Absolute Insanity Warning*  The following post contains gratuitous vulgarities not suitable for anyone, especially members of the Llama Genus and/or children. Clinical studies have shown an increased likelihood of lowered IQ in Fluffy Alpacas who read this post. In all seriousness you have probably lost at least 10 IQ points just by reading this warning.    You have been warned!    Lingual Anomaly Begins Here--------------------->  First off I would like to say that unemployment sucks. Not the insurance, which is just a plain slap in the face after the kick in the teeth you recieved when you lost your job; No! I am talking about the actual act of being unemployed. The day in and day out boring, monotonous, stare at the walls until your eyes dry out kind of sucks.       "All bland and no work makes Pat a dull boy!"   I can't take it anymore... Argh!      "Well then Mr. Whiner, why don't you just go out and get a job?"  Oh Neat! Why didn't I think of that? Oh wait, I did think of that. You see here is the problem... The County in which I reside isn't exactly The Mystical Land of Golden Opportunites. It's actually alot like the land that time forgot... just not as cool, cause the only dinosaurs we have running around are some of the useless professors at the local college. Which I won't mention the name of this particular college, but if you used your thinking caps, I bet you could guess; especially if I were to tell you its in upstate new york and rhymes with "Puny Amigo". All that having been said here comes the problem. I am "Mr. Computer Guy". You got a comp? I got what you need. Kinda like a nerdier version of the crack dealer down on the corner... But, out here in La-La Land people are still figuring out that electricity is a good thing. Thus leaving the last of the potential employers out here to fathom and wonder about what in the hell a Wi-Fi is, and whether or not it's edible. It's all sad, but true.  So here I am, stuck in a very real technology hell; Not to mention the bottomless pit of employment woes. But, at least I can say that I can keep myself amused by playing the all time classic game of screw with the collections people.      Collections People: "Hi, can I speak to Patrick *Beep*, please?"     Me: "Speaking. What do you want?"     Collections People: "We are calling on behalf of *Beep* and the debt you owe them of $*Beep*"     Me: "What? I'm sorry I couldn't understand that, would you mind repeating it please."     Collections People: "We are calling on behalf of *Beep* and we would like to discuss the terms of your debt."     Me: "The what has worms at the vet?"     Collections People: "No, no... we want to discuss the terms of your debt, and how you are going to repay it."     Me: "Who is going to spray it?"     Collections People: "Sir. This is a very important matter, and I am going to need you to be serious."     Me: "I beg your pardon, there is nothing wrong with my bladder, and I am not delirious!"     Collections People: *Long Pause Followed By Sigh* "Sir. We will call back another time, have a nice day." *Click*  Haha I win! Seriously I have a perfect score so far... able to irratate them into hanging up in less than 5 minutes WOOT! I swear I should write a self help book entitled      "You too can win. Learn the secret methods of screwing with collections people"  Oh well... I suppose that is enough of a rant for tonight... its 3am now, so Im tired. Nighty night all! :)   *Post Insanity Warning*  Pay no attention to the first warning, as this post did not contain vulgarities beyond the scope of everyday conversation. The writers of said warning will be shot accordingly. Thank you for your time and patience.

      Whoohoo! My first blog ever! It's more exciting that watching cows regurgitate cud, and that's pretty exciting ;)  In any case I expect I will have alot of fun with this over time; but for now it's really early in the morning and I need some sleep.
