        I have driver's ed. Monday - Thursday for the next 4 weeks. I've already completed one week and started the 2nd week today. I have so much studying to do. Tomorrow is the chapter 3 and 4 test and then Wednesday is the permit test! I am so freaked that I won't remember anything! I mean I've barely even read any of the chapter form our "Rules of the Road" book we got to help us study for&nbsp;our permit test. I really should be studying right now but I really don't feel like it. I'll just stay up late and study tonight well, at least until Inuyasha comes on because then I have to stop and watch it. I love that show. Anyway, Sammie and her mom give me a ride to dr. ed. everyday. Sammie's taking that class too and it is way more fun with her! Mr. Hovanec just drones on...and on...and on. I wish there was a funner way to learn everthing you need to know in driver's ed.

       Last week I got a job working at Subway! I love the food there. Anyway I love work and working there, even though I have to peel and chop the onions sometimes. Yikes! The people there are great. Everyone is really nice to me and patient. Whenever&nbsp;I don't know how to make a sandwich they help me&nbsp;out.&nbsp;I'm so glad that the costomers are patient enough to deal with me. So far I only know how to make a few sandwiches...The Subway Club, BMT, BLT, and the Meatball Sub. Cut me some slack It's only been 2 days. I work again tomorrow at 10 untill 2. I can't wait! The Subway club is my favorite to make because that's the only sandwhich I eat. Even since I was little I've only eat the Club at Subway. Wednesday when I worked I even got to work the cash register a few times, but man was I embarressed when I accidently gave the customer the recepit when we, the workers, are suppose to keep it. The person working the cashier has to sign it and put it onto this clip thingy. My face grew so red&nbsp;I decided to clean and make sandwiches the rest of the day instead of doing the cash register. Even though&nbsp;I must have made hundreds of mistakes I'm really happy working there and I'm learning. I can't wait untill tomorrow!
