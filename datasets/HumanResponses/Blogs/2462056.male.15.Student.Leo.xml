       Music:  Ying Yang Twins - By Myself  Mood:  Tired like whoa  Hmmm, it's been a while since the last time I updated this thing... haha.  I got an MP3 player which is pretty cool.  I'm still working on putting all of my CDs on it, only about 20 more to go.  Claire came back from camp. Hehe it wasn't soccer camp like I thought, it was band camp.  Whoops!  Yeah, and Chrissy had a birthday/going away party, so that was pretty fun, because everyone was hyper it seemed.  On Sunday I went to the skatepark with Jesse for the first time in forever, because he wanted to try out some of the stuff taht he learned at Woodward.  We got down there and Ben showed up.  We were about to start riding when a storm rolled in like, instantly.  We sat underneath a ramp and we were going to wait it out but then like, we saw some lightning stike like, crazy close, so we took off quick.  Jesse and I went to his house and watched TV and played PS2 and stuff for a while, then I went back home.  Tyler (my cousin) came over that night and ate dinner with us.  That night Claire came over and we watched Gothika.  That movie is freaky as crap.  Especially the 2nd half because i was sitting in the dark downstairs watching it alone, haha.  Yesterday I sat around the house for a long time, until that night around 7 when I went to Zach's with some people.  We played Xbox and Gamecube for like, 4 hours, and it was fun.  Yep that's pretty much all that has happened lately....

       Music:  The Matches - Scratched Out (Untitled)  Mood:  weird... this is strange  Ahh... for some reason I'm not in a good mood.  I don't really have a reason to not be in one... and this is like, the first time I've really been in a bad mood since like... a really really long time, because I always try and make everything into a good situation. I'm sure this will go away tomorrow when I wake up.  I miss my friends like crazy! They all just got back, and now they are leaving again.  I'm really happy for them because they are going to have a great time where they go to.  Claire is going to a soccer camp until Sunday, and Jesse is going to Panama City Beach until Sunday.  I have a lot of other good friends in Auburn, but no one can really replace Jesse or Claire... At least I got to hang out with Claire a little today.... I haven't even seen Jesse in like, 3 weeks.  I went with Claire and Dabney and Edward and saw Dodgeball today, which was funny.  Then I went home and I was stuck at home because my parents went out to eat so I had to watch my sister.  It sucked too, because I wanted to hang out with Jesse and Claire, but I was stuck at home, and Claire or Jesse couldn't come over.  Jesse had to pack and Claire couldn't get over here.  I'm working on another song... just kinda cutting and pasting stuff like, inside my head... nothing written on paper yet though, hopefully I'll get to that step soon.  I'll post it up here whenever that happens.  Much love.

       Music:  Flashlight Brown - "Praise The Day" and "Whoa Man"  Mood:  totally stoked dude... haha just kidding, i don't really talk like that... but you know what i mean   Yay! Everyone is home! Yesterday me and my family went to Atlanta to pick up my brother from the airport.  We got up around 7, which gave me a total of 4 hours of sleep, which made me feel like a pile of warm fuzzies in the morning.  We went to Waffle House on the way there though, so that made it a little better.  We got to the airport like, 2 hours early, and sat on our asses until around 1, when my brothers flight finally came in. (ooh I just found a baby lady bug on my shirt!) Then we went home, and everyone was lazy and tired, so we all just sat around and watched TV.  Mom, Dad, and Lacy watched The Cat in the Hat, but I fell asleep right at the beginning and woke up right at the end, so I don't know how it was.  That's all that happened yesterday.  Today I slept in fairly late, around 11.  I had Driver's Ed at 1.  That was interesting because I was the only one in my group who had more than 2 weeks experience behind the wheel, and also the only one to have my permit.  Tomorrow I'm going to be in the car, in traffic, with 2 people driving that have never driven in traffic before, so that is pretty scary.... hehe.  I came home, and beat Half-Life: Blueshift, because I'm a loser and I'm at the computer way to much.  Claire came home today!! That made me crazy happy, cuz I missed her like crazy.  We went to Jordan's house tonight and watched Vanilla Sky, which was a pretty good movie, but confusing.  But I got to spend time with Claire after a week of not seeing her, so it was alllll good.  After the movie we all messed around in Jordan's backyard, and me and Conor and Ben and Chrissy went on an "adventure" around the neighborhood, which was really fun.  Me and Ben made a new drink called Dr. Cokagatorspiteinade, and it is really good.  It will soon hit store shelves, and we will make millions.  So yeah... my dad set an 11:00 cerfew for me, which is gay as hell, because that is waaaay early.  So yeah......... hope that gets changed.

       Music:  Against Me! - We Laugh At Danger (and Break All the Rules)  Mood:  Longing (is that used correctly?)  Countdown:  2 days! Oh so close    PHONE UPDATE!!!!  My phone works again! I'm so happy, even though I barely ever use it, I'm just glad I didn't have to pay for a new one! The only small problem is it is hard to use the 5, 6, and 0 keys.... okay, now that you guys know about that... you can call me on my cell instead of my house... if you were going to call me in the first place...   Man oh man, I so wish Claire and Jesse and Trevor were back in town.  Its been like, a week!  It feels crazy weird not having Jesse or Trevor or Claire to call just to like, come over and keep me company while I have to watch my sister.  Hmmm, last night me and my mom and sister went to o'Charley's to eat, and it was okay.  The shrimp I got was kinda nasty, so I got some totally sweet soup, and it was really really good.  It was like, cheesey and potato...y.... i guess that describes it, hehe.  YEP! Well actually, I don't think that was last night, that was two nights ago.... because last night my dad got home from Alaska, and we watched Something's Gotta Give, which is pretty funny.  Today we had an early Father's Day.  We went and picked up the new recliner we got for him, and then when we got home we gave it to him, hehe durr.  Then we all just kinda chilled for the rest of the day, until later that night, and I went to Andy's house.  We started watching Along Came Polly, but then we switched to The Shining.  Eh it was pretty freaky, but it was way to slow for my liking.  It was more like, psychological freaky than jumpy freaky.  Yeah I got home from that not to long ago, now I'm sitting here drinking an orange soda... hehe.  Tomorrow mornign we are going to pick my brother up from the airport because he was in Alaska also, at one of his friends weddings.  Yessuh, so that's all I have to say now.

       Music:  MxPx - Everything Sucks (When You're Gone)  Mood:  Tired, but in a good mood  Countdown for Claire, Dabney, Jesse, Trevor, and Titus:  4 Days  Haha yesterday night was pretty interesting.  First I went out to eat with my mom, and we went to La Bomba, some new mexican restaurant that was kind of not good.  Their cheese dip was a lot better than Laredo's though, so I guess I'll have to give it a... 4.5 out of 10.  Then after that I went home and sat around for about an hour.  Theeeeeeen I went to Tom Hess' house with a group of people and we played capture the flag for a while.  This is when the interesting stuff started to happen.  We got out some bottle rockets, and we were throwing them at each other, and I freaked out cuz one was like, right next to me.  I started running, and I completely fell into Tom's pond, and got totally soaked all over.  I smelled like shit, my clothes were soaked, and I was laughing my ass off, hahah it was great.  But then I remembered my cellphone was in my pocket.... and so yeah, thats not good for the phone.  Hopefully when it completely dries out it will work again.  Yeah then a little later that night, Ben was melting some electrical tape, and for some reason decided to throw it on my foot, which was a great idea!  It stuck to my foot, and it was hot as hell and burnt like crazy!  When I finally reached down there and ripped it off, it got stuck to my hand, and it hurt like crazy bad there too.  Result: I got a huge blister on the top of my foot, and it burnt until I woke up this morning, hehe.  It doesn't hurt anymore though, which is a good thing, and I popped the blister, so it just keeps oozing instead of getting really big, which is kinda a good thing.  So yep, thats pretty much all that happened.

      I was just sitting here and these lyrics popped into my head, so I wanted to write them down before I forgot!   I'll lay in my room and think of you And Waste away the afternoon The sun has set and risen again I really hope you come back soon   Yessuh! Well, I'll probably add more to this song later! So, yeah, not like anyone reads this thing anyways, hehe!

       Music:  Millencollin - Man or Mouse  Mood:  Awwww... (haha)  Countdown until Jesse and Trevor get home from Woodward:  6 Days  countdown Until Claire and Dabney get home from North Carolina:  6 Days  Yeah.... 6 days.... thats a while!  I havne't updated this thing in like, 2 days... hmmm, what has gone on in those two days...  On Sunday I went and played soccer with a bunch of people for about 2 hours, then went home and ate dinner, then that night I went over to Claire's house, along with Ben and Andy, and we watched TV, ate pizza, played Uno Attack and Apples to Apples, then we just kinda hung out until we left!  Thats pretty much all I did on Sunday, cuz I got back from Claire's around midnight.  Then on Monday... I didn't really do anything cuz I had to stay home and watch my sister.  Then that night, around like, 9:30 or so, Claire came over and me and Claire and Lacy played Uno Attack and Candyland!  It was mucho fun.  Then when we were done with that we all sat around and talked until around 11:30 when Claire's mom came and picked her up!  She left for North Carolina today and she won't be back until Monday, which sucks, because that is a pretty long time!  Today... I did nothing at all, just kinda sat around and played Half-life, which I beat! Then I went straight into Half-Life: opposing Force, cuz i'm a total dork, hahaha.  My sister has 2 of her friends over for a "sleep-over," so they better not get loud tonight or I'll have to whoop some little kid ass tomorrow! Haha not really, cuz I'll probably be up way later than they are.

       Music:  The Anna Bocci Band - Hook Line and Sinker  Mood:  Kinda Hyper, Kinda Tired  Well! I just got done reading my summer book for a while, and so far it is pretty good.  It is called I, Robot by Isaac Asimov.  Big Willy Smith is going to be in the movie of it, which comes out next Friday I think.  Wonder if it will be any good.  Tonight was the grand opening of the Auburn Hooters, so I went with a group of people (Claire, Dabney, Andy, Ben, Jordan, Chrissy, Max, Jen, Zach, Ashley, Conor, Phillip).  It took us like, an hour and a half to get a seat, and then when we finally got in there... the food kinda sucked and the waitresses weren't that good looking, so it wasn't worth the wait.  But it was still a lot of fun because of all my friends being there and us getting to hang out and stuff.  We got Claire and Dabney to fake that it was their birthday's so the people did a little birthday thing for them at the place, and it was cool, haha.  Then afterwards, we went to Conor's house and hung out, played darts, watched TV, played pool.  It was fun stuff, then I left there around 11:30 and came home, got on the computer, drank some lemonade, read my book, and then decided to update my journal, which I am doing right now! What a coincidence... Man, we are out of orange soda, which pisses me off, because I really want some orange soda right now....

       Music:  Beloved (us) - Failure On My Lips  Mood:  Tired  Yeah, I'm tired as poop.  My sister comes in at 10:30 this morning and wakes me up to ask if I can watch her play Super Smash Brothers, and then gets mad at me when I say no.  So I laid in bed and listened to Atticus II for about 30 minutes, then decided to get up and go watch her play for a little while.  Then she wanted to do something else, so I watched some TV for a while while i was eating breakfast.  Last night I went and hung out at Claire's house, because Dabney got back from the beach yesterday, so she was over there too.  It was pretty fun, but I was really tired and stuff so I didn't talk that much... even though I already don't talk that much, which kinda made me mad at myself, but oh well, can't change what has already passed.  I don't have any plans today, might go to the Hooter's grand opening with Trent and Andy, but that's the only thing that is going on... Oh well, I'll probably find something.

       Music:  Boy Crazy - New Found Glory  Mood:  HYPER!!!!  YIPPEE!!!! Driver's ed is finally over... well.. not really finally, since it only last a week... but it was still boring as crap... and having to get up at 7 in the morning during summer break? What is up with that?  Now all I have to do is wait 2 weeks to do driving practice and a road test, then I'll have to wait for my 16th birthday, which is August 13th.  Last night I went to Andy's house, along with Claire, Trent, Emma, Cathy, and Megan.  We watched the MTV movie awards, then everyone left except me, Claire, and Trent, so Andy busted out some DDR, haha.  Yep, so then I got home around 11:00 or 11:15ish, got on AIM for a while, drank some lemonade, then went to bed like, crazy early, it was like, midnight:30.  That was the most sleep I've gotten since Saturday, which is crazy.  I had a bass lesson today after driver's ed, which was cool.  Then I came home and ate some ramen noodles, then laid down for a while, which felt good. Yep, that's it.

I'm going over to someone's house and we are going to hang out with people and watch them and stuff! Its going to be fun.  Yesterday I went to a pick-up soccer game, and we played until around 7, then everyone left.  Then I went home and ate some FRENCH TOAST! That stuff is so good.  Then Claire and I went over to Andy's house!  We played DDR, fooooooozball, watched some Tv, and just hung out.  It was fun stuff!  Yep, then we left around 11:00 and then I came home, and i did some stuff for driver's ed, then I went to bed!!! Whew, I've gotten like, a total of about 18 hours of sleep since Sunday... that's like, almost as long as you're supposed to sleep each night on summer vacation.... crazy stuff.  Yep! The two people that I'm riding with for driver's ed have never driven a car before... that should be interesting.... haha.  Wellllllll, yep! Thats all I have for now.

       Music : "The Astronaut" and "Fall" - something Corporate   Mood : Happy but Tired!  Well hello to anyone who is reading this! Hope your day is going wonderful.  Just started this so I could write down stuff that I wanted to, hehe.  Yep, I'm tired as butt, because i went to sleep at like, 2 this morning, and had to get up at 7 for drivers ed.... so yawn, that was pretty tiring.  Yesterday was fun.  After driver's ed, i came home and ate lunch, and the nextdoor neighbors (my sisters friends) came over and we had a big pillow fight, which was totally awesome.  Then Claire came over and we hung out for like, pretty much the rest of the day.  She's awesome.  We walked down to Cary Woods and messed around there for a while, until we lost a kickball on the roof, then we left.  We came home, and I went out to eat with my mom and sister, and Claire went home.  Then after dinner I met back up with her, and we ended up meeting up with Trevor, Vladimir, and Titus.  We went over to Vladimir's house, and played with fire.  They had some fuel for gas-powered remote control cars, and it burnt a really cool color.  They ended up blowing the bottle up on accident, which made a huge fireball, which was totally awesome!  Then we just hung out for a while, until around 10:00, then we all went home.  It was totally fun though.  Well... yeah, today has just started, so... can't really say much about it, hehe.

       Music:  Chronic Future - Stop Pretending  Mood:  Totally awesome!  Ah... what a nice refreshing bike ride to the pet store.  I love riding my bike around town, its so fun!  Cuz you get all the fresh air and you see all these people and you get to ride around and stuff, and its really fun.  So yeah! On to more important things, like how FRIGGIN SWEET Warped Tour '04 was!  You have no idea, unless you were there also, then you would probably have a pretty good idea... So yeah, I got a backpack full of free stuff, which is always awesome.  An ass-load of free stickers, some posters, and a bunch of sampler CDs.  So yeah, the line-up that I saw was something like this: chronic Future, From Autumn to Ashes, Motion City Soundtrack, Matchbook Romance, then after Matchbook we walked around getting free stuff for about an hour and a half, and listening to small bands music, and buying CDs and such.  Then we hit up the two main stages (Teal and Brian) for the rest of the show.  The line up was something like this: Coheed and Cambria, New Found Glory, Flogging Molly, Story of the Year, Yellowcard, NoFX, and then Sugarcult.  We headed out after Sugarcult, cuz we were all spent and hot and tired and were ready to get on the road.  On the way out I stopped and listened to another small bands CD, and they were really good.  It was hardcore and I usually don't like hardcore that much, but it was kinda melodic hardcore instead of just like, bash your face and don't play music hardcore, so it was cool.  I wanted to get their CD but I only had like, 4.50 left over.  He said he woulda given it to me if I had a few more bucks, but he was really nice about it and he was a totally cool guy so I gave him a dollar for his beer money donations box.  It was great.  While waiting out in the parking area for my mom, we chilled and listened to Taking Back Sunday and Bad Religion rock the crowd.  So yeah, yesterday was the best day of my summer.  We upheld the 2 year long (and running) tradition of eating at Wendy's on the way home.  We even sat in the same booth... haha.  Yeah so when we got home we kinda sat around in my room for a while listening to some of the music we got, then they all headed out.  I was so tired.... so yeah, that my friend, is what Warped Tour '04 was all about.  Awesome music and hanging out with friends.  See you guys later!

       Music:  My Chemical Romance - Helena  Mood:  Wondahful  Dude, WARPED TOUR TO-FRIGGIN-MORROW! I am so stoked.  So many great bands, so much free stuff, so many weird people! Its going to be GREAT!  So yeah, today was pretty interesting...  kinda crazy though.  Yeah.. so these last couple (few? i forget) posts have been about Claire.. we split up today.  Things just weren't working out like they shoulda, but we talked about it and it went down nice and smooth and we are still cool with each other, so what more could I ask for?  It was pretty much a mutual feeling also, so that made it easier.  I mainly sat around the house today.  I went and played soccer with people, and it turned out being really fun.  It was a small group, and I liked it a lot better than when we have large group, because it just seems to be more fun.  Tomorrow is going to be an early morning, but it doesn't matter, because no matter how much sleep I get I'm pretty much going to be running off of pure adrenaline tomorrow.  I can't friggin WAIT.  Well, I'll post tomorrow night when I get back! I'm so friggin stoked!!!!

       Music:  American Hi-Fi - Nothing Left To Lose  Mood:  Dubya tee eff, mate?  Man, shit is CRAZY. Not like cow shit or anything, but like, crazy shit... that goes on... and you can't really do anything about it... Sometimes I don't see why relationships occur, because they usually just end up hurting people.  Yeah, they are fun to get in to, and I'm sure I'll have more in my life time because it is natural, I just don't see why people deal with the shit that goes on.  Guess its natural.  Yeah, well I guess it's a good thing that stuff doesn't always work out, because this world would be crazy as hell if it did.  America would be gone, the South would own Africa, Indians would be scalping Whitee because he stole their land... well, everyone out there reading this, wish me luck, this is all i have for now.

I'm so happy!! Ah... okay, now that that's over, hehe.  Yeah today.... didn't do much, yet again! Hahah.  I finished reading  I, Robot , which was really really super good, and I'm glad I got it. Its kinda weird that they made a movie with the same title, and yet they aren't anything alike.. except there are robots... whatever, let those gay movie makers do what they want, because I still liked the movie.  Yeah my sister went over to her friends house for almost the whole day, so that was cool having the house to myself so I could blast music and stuff.  Man... what sucks about being done with english summerwork means I don't have an excuse for not working on history summerwork.... guess I'll have to get started on that.... poopee. Well! See ya!

I don't think.... yeah I pretty much just sat around doing nothing, being fat and nasty, hairy old Willy G.  I've been playing Battlefield 1942, Counter-Strike, and Pokemon Gold a lot lately, hehe.  Yes, yes, Pokemon.. I know.. so 6th grade... but oh well.  I recently found my Gameboy, so I might as well use it, you know?  Today I sat down by the creek for about an our laying out on the rocks reading  I, Robot .  It was very relaxing, hehe.  I am almost done with my English section of summer work... then off to working on history... which will be oh so much fun.  My cousin went to a Less Than Jake concert in Birmingham, which is awesome, hehe.  Hmm... Warped tour in 7 days, Claire back in 3!  So many good things happening soon! Hehe.  Yeah... soo, yeah.

I went to Chewacla today with Jesse and his mom and sister, and we swam for almost 5 hours straight... so I'm totally tired...  We swam across the whole thing, it was fun.  Then we jumped around on the big rocks and stuff, which was really fun.  Then I came home... sat around for a little bit.  Me and my brother watched like, 3 hours of South Park tonight, which was fun (he just left a little while ago).  Ah.... Smartees are so good.  Yesterday I saw I, Robot, which is a lot better than I thought it was going to be!  Then I went to the park with a group of people, and it was fun.  We played hide and seek, hehe, then we kicked around the soccer ball for a while.  Around 7:30 everyone went to Jordan's house, but I didn't because I went home because my brother and my cousin came over and ate dinner.  Then we had a wicked game of clue afterwards... hahaha.  So yeah... hmmm.. Claire gets back on Saturday! I'm so excited!

        Music:  My Chemical Romance - ... their whole CD "Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge"    Mood:  Middle-ish    &nbsp;  Yep, sooo I shall start off this post by saying that Nadia is totally cool and she's a P.I.M.P. for real, and she's a true gangster.... so watch out, if you see her coming down your street, I'd go inside before you get hurt.&nbsp; On that note, I guess I can move on....    &nbsp;  My eyes are dry... maybe it's because my fan is on... but I don't wanna turn it off because then I'll get hot.&nbsp; So yeah today... I watched TV, listened to music... same ol' same ol'... yeah then me and my sister watched Jeepers Creepers which is really good, and then we played the boardgame Goosebumps: Terror in the Graveyard.&nbsp; It is quite possibly the best boardgame ever invented.&nbsp; Then.... David stopped by and let me borrow some CDs... The Killers, My Chemical Romance, Motion City Soundtrack, and Dashboard Confessionals, so that is really cool.&nbsp; I went to Andy's house tonight with a group of people.&nbsp; We watched Forest Gump.&nbsp; It was kinda for this guy that was in town visiting Codi, cuz she met him on a cruise.&nbsp; I think he thinks I'm weird, because when I first walked in the door I saw him and I was like "heeeeeeey!" and then he was just like  "hey"   so I derno, haha.&nbsp; Yep.. so I left his house around 10:30 and came home, thanks for the ride Saba.&nbsp; Now I'm home listening to all of my new music... I still miss Claire... haha I'm pitiful.... hahaha.&nbsp; I want her to get back so I can show off all of my new social skills to her, hahaha.&nbsp; Well that's it for now.&nbsp; PEACE OUT BRIZZONE... CALZONE! those things are crazy good

        Music:&nbsp; Alkaline Trio... no specific songs, just their 2 CDs Good Mourning and Goddammit     Mood:  Weeeee!! I'm hyper-tired... you nkow that feeling you get right before you get crazy sleepy?     &nbsp;   Hmmm... for those of you who couldn't figure out who Billy Bob and Ms. Crap-apple were in the last post, i'll tell you this: I don't think I want you to know if you couldn't figure it out on your own.&nbsp; Yesh... so today, all of the baby lizards we found in our garden finished hatching! Well most of them hatched yesterday/2 days ago, but today the last one hatched.&nbsp; It was cool.&nbsp; We set up an "environment" for them in an abandoned terrarium I used to keep my frog and fish in.&nbsp; So yeah, now I have a dozen baby lizards in my room! Yay! But they are just babies, so they mainly hide in the dirt... I haven't seen one come up today... oh well... Yep, and I got to go to my second favorite fastfood restaurant ever!! ARBY'S!!!!! Which FRIGGIN ROCKS by the way... but I mean... Arby's would have to bow down and kiss the feet of the ALL MIGHTY CZAR OF FASTFOOD SUBWAY! So yep.... I gotta pee, but I wanna finish this post first...&nbsp; Yep... we are getting a puppy! In about 4 weeks! Its gonna be a Boykin Spaniel... so I'm excited about getting it, because I absolutely love dogs.&nbsp; Yep... Claire doesn't like dogs... I miss her a lot... haha. Its been soooo long since I last saw her... or even talked to her.... so yeah, that blows.&nbsp; Nine more days! I think I can handle it, especially since Andy is having a party tomorrow night.... yay! Finally someone having a party! I'm happy!&nbsp; Hmmm if someone knows a cool song with a sweet bass line, tell me, because I want to have a really cool bass line to play over and over and annoy people with!&nbsp; Peace out holmz

       Music:  Not Long After - Times Forever Ours  Mood:  Nuts Itch...  Hmmmm, how is it that I just about always update this thing after midnight? Probably because I have nothing better to do at that time of day.  Well Ben and I decided spontaneously to make a Counter-Strike clan, so we did!  Its called A.K.A., standing for the our oh so original slogan "Also Known As." Man, we are clever, coming up with A.K.A., man those 3 letters just roll right off your tongue.  So yep, someone is finally having another party this weekend! God bless Andy, the master of the parties.  Hmmm so yesterday... nothing happened, at all.  I had to cut the grass, and I did it with out music for once, and finished really quick! It was cool.  I'm pretty sure I didn't do anything else.  Last night Jordan and I had a "deep" conversation (over AIM) for a really long time for like, the first time in forever.  It was really cool.  Hmm then today... I still didn't do anything.... just kinda sat around, played a lot of Counter-Strike.  Tonight a mean game of Clue went down in the Grand residence, or as I like to call it, La Casa de Grande.  It turned out to be Professor Plumb with the rope in the kitchen.  That dirty BASTARD!  Yep, then when that ended... came back in here... played Counter-Strike.... I'm working on a site for the clan! So yeah, I'll give the URL when its done.  Hmmm well, I'm going to say this using code words, because I'm not allowed to say it normally.  Billy Bob and Ms. Crap-Apple date, and Billy Bob really likes Ms. Crap-Apple, but he isn't quite sure if Ms. Crap-Apple feels the same way back.  He really hopes Ms. Crap-Apple feels the same way back, and also really hopes that Ms. Crap-Apple would tell him if she didn't feel the same way back, because Billy Bob does not like to be played.  He also wants Ms. Crap-Apple to be happy, so he doesn't want to hold her back.  Yesh... silly little Billy Bob...

       Music:  Yellowcard - Only One  Mood:  Bored as CRAP!  Hehe I'm listening to the Gorillaz right now, for the first time in a looong time.  I was at Trevor's the other day and his brother turned on their CD, and that reminded me that I have their CD, so that's what I'm listening to.  So yeah, yesterday I had to do some yard work, which wasn't that bad because there wasn't that much to do.  Then I just kinda sat around the house for a long while, watched TV, read my book some.  That night I went to B-Webb's birthday party at Buffalo Connection.  It was really fun.  Haha I was expecting there to be like, a bunch of people I didn't know since he was a senior, but it turned out to be pretty much a Varsity Singers reunion, haha.  It was really fun though.  So yeah, we all just kinda sat around and talked and ate until around 9 when everyone started leaving.  So yeah it was a fun night.  I couldn't get much sleep last night, so I read my book.  I'm ready to write another section of my summer work on it, but I really don't want to, because it is boring and time consuming.  Claire gets back in 12 days! Yay!

       Music:  Dashboard Confessional - Vindicated, Blink 182 - Not Now  Mood:  Good, but missing my special someone more and more  I just made the coolest playlist I've ever made, its SWEET. Here it is:   Dashboard Confessionals - Vindicated Finch - Ender New Found Glory - Head On Collision (like, OMFG, what a bunch of like, SELL OUTS!! just kidding, you fags) Blink 182 - Not Now Oasis - Wonderwall MEST - Chelsea Don't Look Down - Hindsight Fenix TX - Tear Jerker Matchbook Romance - Tiger Lily Doozer - Dare You To Try Finch - What It Is To Burn Good Charlotte - Motivation Proclomation Reggie and the Full Effect - Happy V-Day Foundation - Engines of Alienation MEST - Rooftops The Matches - Scratched Out Something Corporate - The Astronaut Matchbook Romance - Playing For Keeps Goldfinger - Happy Green Day - Macy's Day Parade Hoobastank - The Reason Good Charlotte - Complicated Incubus - Warning Blink 182 - Please Take Me Home Matchbook Romance - Stay Tonight Yellowcard - Only One Goldfinger - Counting the Days Never Heard Of It - I'll Change For Now Not Long After - Times Forever Ours Saves the Day - Nightingale Something Corporate - Fall MEST - Jaded (These Years) Never Heard Of It - Hard Headed Sparta - Glasshouse Tarot Story of the Year - Until the Day I Die The Ataris - The Hero Dies In This One Matchbook Romance - If All Else Fails Unwritten Law - Seein' Red   hmmmm... that took too much time, considering only about 3 people are ever going to read it, haha.  Well yep, like the mood thing said... I really miss Claire, haha like, really really really.  I had a dream about her last night, which makes me miss her even more!  I hope she is having a good time.  I've only talked to her once since she has been gone... which kinda sorta sucks, but she is probably doing a lot of stuff, so I'm not really expecting a call... whatever, hehe.  Hmm lets see, what has happened.... I got invited to B Webb's party tomorrow night, thats going to be fun.  I went and saw Spiderman 2 today with my family.  That movie is really good, I liked it a lot more than the first one.  I felt bad for Peter, hehe.  Then afterwards I came home, then almost instantly went out again with the family to go eat at Laredo's.  I got a CHIMI CHANGA!!!! It was awesome, I think I'm going to get those from now on, they are crazy good and when the waiter brought them out he said chimi changa really really funny, so I was like "props to ya, hombre" and he was like "holla back youn'un, whoo whoo" and I was like "you straight up trippin' yo" so we are tight now.  Yep, so that's pretty much all!!!!! yaaaaay

       Music:  Strike Anywhere - Sunset on 32nd Street  Mood:  Yawn... kinda tired... derno why, its way early  Today wasn't very eventful.  I got up this morning around 10:30, then about an hour later I had a bass lesson, which was cool.  I learned Play The Funky Music, cuz we are working on slapping and popping.  I came home from that, ate some pizza, then I listened to music for like, a really long time, watched some TV, lazied around.  Later tonight I went with my sister over to our neighbors to water plants because they are out of town, and that turned into a big hose war, we both ended up soaked, so it was fun.  Came home, ate dinner... now I'm here listening to music and talking to ANNE! Who I haven't talked to in forever.   Yep, so Claire still isn't home, and NOTHING has gone on for a while... I'm so crazy excited about Warped Tour, I need to hurry up and order my tickets, I'll probably do it with Ben so we will get them at the same time.  So yep, that's it..

       Music:  MxPx - Quit Your Life  Mood:  Not so dandy, hehe  Dude, I have a headache, and I've had it since like, 4:00... it sucks.  I think I'm dehydrated..  Me and Jesse went riding today.  We started at the skatepark, then we left his truck there and road off around town.  We went on campus, and to the coloseum and stuff, the normal places.  I came home around 4, listened to some music and played some bass, then started getting a headache, so  I laid down, fell asleep and woke up around 8:30.  Some shit is bothering me... but I'm not going to post that here, because I don't post stuff like that on here, hehe.  It's soooo boring here, there has been nothing going on this week at all.... it sucks!  It seems like no one is home... or at least I haven't been talking to many people, haha.  Oh well, yeah, so nothing is going on, I have a headache, and I'm bored as crap.  We can watch these two smilies make babies now...

       Music:  Reggie and the Full Effect - Happy V-Day  Mood:  Jittery  Damn dude, I've peed like, 10 times today. It's CRAZY.  Yeah anyways.  Mississippi was really fun.  Whenever my dad's side of the family gets together, we always have fun.  It mainly consisted of pool time, and a VERY competitive badmitten tournament, haha it was really awesome.  Claire's gone in NY, I got to talk to her last night, and she is having a great time, which was awesome.  Still haven't seen anyone since I've gotten back.  So yeah, I got to test my mp3 player "in the field" a.k.a. on a road trip, and it is really awesome, so I'm glad I got it.  I wrote a new song today, along with a bass part that sounds pretty good with it.  Too bad I can't play guitar, or I might actually have a full song:   I Saw this in a dream A dream that never ended I just wanted to wake up (wake up) Walk with toes in the sand Wake up, Wake up Kiss your face once again Wake up Wake up Pinch me if I'm dreaming I never wanted this to end  Just last week we were having a blast Hanging out with friends, not moving to fast Had all the time in the world, and places to go There's one last thing that I want you to know  I just wanted to wake up (wake up) Walk with toes in the sand Wake up, Wake up Kiss your face once again Wake up Wake up Pinch me if I'm dreaming I never wanted this to end  It wasn't your fault It's a misunderstanding I wasn't prepared For this crash landing  I just wanted to wake up (wake up) Walk with toes in the sand Wake up, Wake up Kiss your face once again Wake up Wake up Pinch me if I'm dreaming I never wanted this to end   So yep, not sure if I'll add another verse or not, I think I kinda like it being short though.  So yeah, the next few weeks are going to consist of near constant music/bass playing, and summer work.  I'm reading I, Robot, and it is really really good.  My goal is to finish the book and the writing by this Friday.  Then I have to get started on my American History stuff.  So yeah... the rest of this summer will be great fun...

       Music:  Brand New - Failure By Design  Mood:  Tired, Kinda Bummed, but still pretty good  Well, Yeah I know I updated this thing only but like, several hours ago, but I don't care.  I'm bored, and don't have anything better to do.  I've been listening to Brand New's album "Your Favorite Weapon" lately, and it is totally awesome, even though I've had it for a really long time.  So yeah, I'm leaving today around lunch time for Mississippi and it is going to be pretty fun.  I'm debating on whether i should bring my bass or not, in case I get bored.  But I don't know how much I would play it.  I borrowed D12 World from Greg.  Hehe that CD is awesome.  There is a troll on my desk.  I'm not going to take a shower today.  My dad and sister are at Books-a-Million.  My mom is at work.  My stomach is empty.  Okay, I'm done.  Well I'll see everyone again next week, stay safe, much love, bye.

       Music:  MEST - Night Alone  Mood: Sad...  Man, this blows.  I'm not going to see Claire for like, another 3 weeks.  I'm leaving tomorrow (well technically today) for Mississippi, and Claire is leaving on Saturday for New York.  We were planning on hanging out tonight, but her parents wouldn't let her come over... so that blows.  Good thing phones were invented (props to ya, Bell).  Well Jesse came over tonight, and we kinda sat around, played guitar and stuff, then played PS2 and computer and stuff.  Then he had to go home.  Wednesday night Ben, Edward, Dabney, and I were at Claire's house and we were going to have a bonfire but Mother Nature had different plans for us.  So we made a fire in her charcoal grill, and we roasted marshmallows on it.  Then we went to Wrights Mill, and Ben was being his normal pyro self, and lit a trashcan on fire, which eventually melted through, so we dumped it in a puddle so it wouldn't burn down the school.  We went back to Claire's house and Edward, Dabney, and Thomas had to go. Claire, Ben, and I played Timesplitters until like, 11:20.  On the ride home, my dad called me and told me I was late getting home... so I get home and he gets mad at me for being 40 minutes late, which I guess is understandable, but whatever.  So yeah... looks like this month will be pretty sucky! Everyone seems to be going places.  If you are going somewhere, I hope you have a great time! I'm glad you get to get away from Auburn, you lucky bastard! Haha, well, see ya whoever is reading this.

       Music:  New Found Glory - The Great Houdini  Mood:  Ehh... decent..  Okay, lets try this one more time... it just erased my whole post... bleh.  So yeah, today I actually did some stuff... I had to cut the grass, which isn't fun... especially when it is as dry outside as... uh... lets say... an empty cup of water... yeah that sounds good. Then I got my haircut, which doesn't look too bad, except its short.... but oh well, what can you do when your parents "care about you..." Then tonight I went to Zach's house, and it was fun, except I don't think people appreciated the board games that much.  We were playing Risk, which was my first time, and I found it really fun.  We played for a while but then people started getting bored.. hehe.. get it.. bored... board game... okay not funny. So yeah, it was fun tonight!  I stayed until about 11:00.  I came home and did some summerwork... for about an hour... got bored, got on here... Ahhh, kinda in a shitty mood... hopefully it will go away with some sleep and then tomorrow some loud music... like... some loud punk or hardcore or something, whatevah! dun dun duuuuuuh... thats all I have now.

       Music:  The Killers - Andy, You're A Star  Mood:  Tired, but good  Yeah there was a choir DDR party tonight at Andy's house (who else?) and it was fun but like, no one showed up, which is why I am home.  It would have been even more fun if more people from choir showed up... hehe.  I'm not sure if I'm looking forward to choir this next year.  The new people that I know of I don't like that much... and I think its going to be a lot more than I was planning on getting into choir for.  Supposedly we are hiring a choreographer, but I am not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing yet, because I don't want it to be too serious, because then it wouldn't be any fun.  Oh well, hopefully everything will turn out alright and stuff.  I so wish that I had a little dude who lived in my closet or something and played guitar really well so we could jam out all night, that would be really cool, because I really wanna play with someone.  I haven't played with anyone in FOREVER.  David came over today and we messed around for a bit and then he copied a bunch of CDs that I got at Warped, it was fun.  So yeah..... see ya

       Music:  Billy Talent - River Below  Mood:  Yawn  Man I am tired.... had to get up for school registration.. which isn't really registration... you just get lockers and pay dues and stuff...  whatever.  Haha, but it was somewhat cool because I got to see all these people and stuff.  It was way to early though... they should have had it like, this afternoon.  And damn, it was like, 100 degrees outside, well, actually 98, but still, thats hot as butt.  Tonight there is a choir DDR party, and that will be fun, getting back together with the choir and hanging out.  I'm excited.  I started working on a new song last night, this is what i have so far:   Is it me or is it you? Or is it the shit we both go through We've had our ups and we've had our downs We've had our smiles and our share of frowns And now that we've both gone our separate ways This reminds me so much of those highschool plays The girl and the guy, the problems at hand The struggle between them Snapped like a rubber band    So yeah... haha I wish I took creative writing this year... I'll take it next year though.

       Music:  Stutterfly - Gun In Hand  Mood:  Purty good  Wow, I've barely watched any TV at all today.  I've just listend to like, hours and hours of music, constantly... Yeah so.. damn I haven't updated this thing since Warped Tour, that's crazy.  Well now that Warped '04 is over, I'm looking forward to Warped '05.  Oh, and If anyone has the Billy Talent CD, I'll love you (long time) if you copy it for me.  Well nevermind, I decided to buy it off of iTunes, thanks anyways.  So yeah, since Warped Tour I went to a LAN on Friday night at Phillip's house, stayed up pretty much all night again playing CS and messing around and getting hyper as hell on energy drinks.  LAN parties are so fun, especially when we set them up ourselves, because then we don't have to pay for stuff, like we would have to at eBaang.  Well yeah, they do have machines that are like, 20 times better than the ones we use, and the internet is a lot faster, but oh well.  My parents went out of town from Saturday morning until Sunday evening.  During that time my brother came over and took me and Lacy out to eat, and my cousin came too.  Nothing like Chimi Changas from Laredo's.  We came home, my brother went and got his N64, and we ended up staying up until about 1:30 playing Mario Tennis, which is one of the most addicting N64 games on the planet.  It was very fun though.  My cousin left after that, sister went to bed, and I stayed up and watched James play Starfox for Gamecube.  Great night.  Didn't do anything on Sunday, except sleep, until like, 1.  I got up, did some more nothing.... and again today I have done nothing.  Yep.  Sorry for everyone that has problems, and I hope they all get fixed!
