      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wow, so I could possibly get promoted at work. How kool? I learned some of the key holder procedures today and it was a lot easier than I thought it would be. My manager and the current key holder approached me about the position and I was undsure of it at first...but y'know? More money and showing that I'm sumwaht responsible would be great! Finally, I can tell people I've earned something on my own!   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talked to my cousin today and well...these travel plans are really screwy! Now I mite go to Florida with my older cousin for a week. Sounds good to me. As long as I get into a different atmosphere for a while, then sure! I'll just go so I can sit in the sun and draw, write and dream.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanx to everyone who's been supporting me through this hard time. I know how the family wants me to go travel with them or elsewhere so I can have some fun and get things off my mind, but to be honest, I jsut want to stay home and fix my room...I mean REALLY fix it. Work towards buying new furniture and painting the walls so I can have my dream room. That may take a while...I still have to save money for the Corrs concert at the end of the month which my brother promised to take me to. Then I owe money to my brother still and then I owe mom money cuz we all pitched in for dads b'day present. Ugh, I still have lotsa stuff on hold at work...I gotta stop spending money. Shit, I need to get to university so that I can stop spending money on things that aren't necessary. I know I'll be great on my own :)   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was hanging out with Kevin earlier. The guy's a lil down. Cheer up! I know how hard it is u guys! Amanda! Live it up! j/k. I know guys...life's a bitch. But at least we know we can survive on our own right? No need for money with us three! and yep, taking in life's beauty is the best thing, i tell ya!   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yep! Got my web site in the making again! Can't WAIT for this one to get goin'. It looks amazing so far and I finally came up with a name for my future animation/filming company. Yeah...it's obvious aint it? but hey, gotta love it!   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So tomorrow, mom and dad are taking me and my bro out for lunch and then we're heading to Quebec for a few days...The on sunday? ELEMENTS! -Headsprung!- HAHA!   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -staying strong- but for how long?...

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I like that song. I like the video too. Damn I'd kill for legs like that!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today was pretty fun. I have to admit it was actually really fun... It started off with Kevin calling me at ten am to tell me to get the fuck outta bed. Took me a while after my everyday morning anxiety coughs. But I ended up going to sportsworld no problem with him and amanda. Yay for rides and other good times. But like hell was I gettin into a bathing suit. Not till these babies *points to thighs* get toned.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterwards I went to work and spent most of the night going crazy cuz the store was dead and unbelievably clean! It was scary. I decided to bring kai some of our home style asian food cuz he never brings food to work lately. He said it wasn't much different from a cambodian dish they eat often.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amanda and Kev showed up to pick me up after work but amanda got in trouble and headed back home. IT was halarious, Kevin and I sped around in his car the entire night. We drove kai to fairview mall's bus terminal, drove to fast eddies, drove his brother to a friend in preston and then we drove aroudn the mall and back to my house. how fun was that? I'm startin to think that this kid is WAY too much like me but hey, that means he's trying to make the best of life and trying to be a good friend and make peopel smile. It'sall good!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow/Today I'll be able to get my hair cut FINALLY and I'll go to karate and then work. After that I'll be in quebec for a few days. Then...clubbing on sunday with amanda and kevin. Can't wait.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shane should have his internet back up soon and I can't wait for that so I wont have to wonder where the hell he is or have a hard time gettinga hold of him anymore. Can't wait to get my web site going again. This time it'll be professional cuz I'll have sum help making it flashy (literally). I'm hoping to update this one more often and make it look more professional so that I can display my art there as well.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My stomache is still turning. I jsut want to be able to speak face to face one last time. I still haven't forgotten. Nor have i stopped caring.  -Looking up to the sky &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lonewolf

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here I am at my desk. Another night in my room. Watched sum movies today, sat around today, slept a bit today, went out a bit today. I took my first class back at karate in a couple years. Felt great. I'm looking forward to designing the new Demo Team Uniform for my sensei.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went out with Kevin to work today so I could preorder a Street Fighter Action Figure (Yes I'm a dork). I talked to Amanda for a bit today. She let out sum steem from the stuff she's going through. Be strong Amanda, you can do it.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y'know how people say that you can tell peopel are happier and healthier when in a relationship? It's true. Cuz right now I'm obviously not healthy.... it's not good. I dont know what's wrong with my system but it's not being too kind at all.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I talked to mike's sister. Thank goodness I could talk to her. She's so different from the rest of her and mike's family. She told me that she'd tell mike that I want to talk to him one last time if it's really over. Thank you Again.  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't really know what to write right now...I'm not feeling too well...I feel like someone stabbed a screwdriver through my chest while they shoved a pindone down my throat to choke on.... Amanda and Kevin wanna take me out to Sportsworld tomorrow. I want to go but at the same time I don't. I really need to get stuff done in the house. I started clearing out some of the basement in order to fit the boxes that i keep under my bed, downstairs instead. I guess I'm not going to the Phillippines. But that also means that since I'm not going, my parents will have sum sort of money to help me fix my room. Can't wait for that. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shane and Ben want me to go to the anime convention with them this year....I wanna go but I don't... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shawn called me from Winnipeg today. I couldn't help but cry. It was so good to hear his voice. No one has a best friend like I do. He's so good to talk to.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Candice wants to hang out and cheer me up this weekend. It'll be good to see her since I haven't seen her in such a long time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asked Katy bout hanging out sum time. Maybe camping or just sumwhere away from here. Hope i get to. I really need to just run and fly away. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to write to megan and liz...evil camp people...I miss them.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll most likely keep to watching these chick flicks i borrowed from melanie...yep...just add onto the loneliness and depression. yay...  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breathe...Just Breathe...  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know what else to write...I'm not feelin so good so I'm just gonna stop here.  -Livin it up &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lonewolf

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heh, so I went to work today. It was great as usual. Ogre Battle 64 came in...I had originally planned on giving it to mike as an anniversary gift of sum sort....but I guess that's not gonna happen. I dont' even have an N64.&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I told Kai and Bryan what happened. They knew i was looking for it for mike and well...yeah...the story had to come out. Kai told me how sorry he was for my situation cuz it hurts cuz it's just like the story he told me about an ex gf...her parents hated him because he was asian and they told him their daughter never wanted to speak to him again, then closed the door on his face. Afterwards they moved away in a week without telling him. She didn't say a word...meaning she never loved him... sounds pretty damn close to my story...  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I played Tales of Symphonia today for a bit. Good game. After work I went to melanies to hang out with her and jasmina. it was great. we were throwing chocolate chips into each other's mouths and melanie kept shoving cookies into my mouth only to crumble all over her bed! Good times!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow I'll be starting Karate again. What i need is to get my anger out on a punching bag. Thank the lords. After, maybe I'll see candice or melly. Candice and I are probably gonna sit back to a few sappy movies and have a few chugs of vodka this weekend. That's definately what I need.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So if I don't go anywhere this summer, my brother said he'd drive me to visit my friend in the states. Can't wait for that. *yawn* I'm tired...  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Funny how I'm up late every night now just to write these. Wonder how long this'll last.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking for that light...  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still searching...   -Lonewolf

      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was another plain ol' day today. I stayed indoors and slept in. I was in Habbo Hotel for a while and became&nbsp;chief of a SWAT group and the 2nd owner of a mature habbo's club. It was pretty fun. A lot different from the european habbo. Actually, slightly better.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My head is hurting, my eyes are sore, my ears are ringing&nbsp;and my back is in pain. Melanie and Jasmina were sweet enough to invite me out to the club tonight cuz they wanted to cheer me up. When we got there we were in for SO much fun! IT was foam night and the place was packed! I'd never been before, but I had enough fun to take things off my mind. It was sooo kool! The foam came out of this big black can thing hanging from the ceiling and dropped over everyone. Imagine the look on my mom and dads face when I got home at 3 am. Well,&nbsp; mom expected it. Dad looked a bit stunned by the fact that I was drenched. Thanx Jas and Melly!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were a few icky guys that tried putting their hands all over me. Boo urns to them. But man, it was great dancing all night and raiding the boxes and cages. At the end of it we were soaked. Melanie and I ended up changing i the parking lot. She had no idea when she was changing her shirt that there were a few guys watching her from behind. I just thought, fuck it, and changed my shirt there and then while melanie started talking to the guys saying "oo it's cold. sorry you gotta see me change like this!" Lmao, as if they minded. Woo hoo! Fake phone numbers are great! We took theirs but mel just handed them a digit off piece of paper.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm actually pretty hungry. My stomache is aching... Hmm...my grandma offered to send me to las vegas sum tiem this summer or sumwhere else in teh states to get things off my mind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other day she gave me a matching bracelet and necklace that say "friendship stones" on the box. I told her I'd put it away. Then she hugged me and started to cry while I did and she said "You are too beautiful. There are so many more men out there. You'll find someone who will treat you the&nbsp; way you deserve to be treated. You know that no matter what I will always be here for you." That's about when I started bawling... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm considering where to go now. I'm most likely not going to the phillipines because ther's a high risk of me getting sick there due to the heat and my asthma. Maybe I'll go to Las Vegas or San Francisco. It'd be really nice to go back to LA and see the places I usetago to...The problem is, I don't know the family that well down there anymore and well...I don't wanna go traveling alone.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really do need to get things off my mind. I just wish I had the right people here to support me. Here I am. Lonewolf. Numero Uno. Start back at one. Who knows that will become of my life. It'll be interesting to watch...  -Lonewolf

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm at home now after getting back from heather's place. I had the greatest time at her house. Her mother is such a sweetheart and Heather, although our schedules clash, is a wonderful friend and is there if I need to talk to her. Her mom made an awesome mango and chicken dinner with a side of rice and mixed vegetables. Ooo! best part- they had Nestea! That's the one drink I can't resist or get sick of! A house with Nestea is a happy house! LMAO! Heather and I got to play cards, watch Versus and she showed me a few things on photoshop that I need to remember in order to create my pretty pictures. She's leaving for algonquin tomorrow...*cries*!!! I wont be able to see her for a month or more but she said she'd try and call me. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This morning I hada good time with my mom at the Farmers Market. We hadn't been in a while but we had a blast. I bought a couple of leather cuffs to wear on my wrists and i got a Beenie Baby Dragon for my older brother cuz I know he love's dragons. We brought our puppy along and man is he hard to pull along. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After when we were driving home my mom and I spotted a few nice cars and one was this kinda crappy chevy thing, but it was in good condition and kinda rare to see. I thought "oh kool" untill i saw the liscence plate "MIKESSS". I just cracked! I jsut went, "AAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!" and my mom told me to calm down and to take a deep breath the way she does when she knows I feel like I wanna punch something. Of course it was kinda funny the way we both reacted to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not quite sure what else to write. Hopefully I can get a holf of my bro and visit him at his friend's/my managers party. I was supposed to go earlier, but I couldn't pass up on a chance to see heather. Saying no to seeing heather is like missing a solar eclipse! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll be starting to take apart my room just to clean up my walls with posters and taking down things that remind me of things I don't want to cry over. Maybe I'll be able to cover up the new hole I made when I kicked it... (-.-)'  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How much longer do I have to wait in order to see or hear from the one who claims to love me?  -Still holdin together, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lonewolf

       &nbsp;&nbsp; Wow, my first blogger entry. I guess this is sumwhat exciting. It's a place where people get to read my deepest and darkest thoughts....if i decide to post them.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course I'm not in the greatest mood because of so many different things, but i'll have to do what everyone is telling me to do. Forget about the person I love because they don't seem to be worth it. IF they can act as though I'm not important to them, then I shouldn't let them or their stuck up family win. I should show them how strong I am and that I can succeed to a higher level then   ANY   of them ever could in their antisocial and money obsessed lives.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the begining. Although I have not yet finalized that this relationship is over...he is making it seem that way. So I should prepare myself now.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm hoping that this journal will be a fresh start so that I don't have to think of too many bad memories, but to keep track of the good ones. Of course I'll write about my horrid days and issues that really piss me off, but this is for my own good. Life's too short and I should remember the best of it...even if it means getting over heartbreak over and over again.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today my brother tried to cheer me up and took me out to eat. It was great cuz I got to tell him about a few funny things and he laughed at me really terrible jokes. He's become one of my best friends.&nbsp; Working for the same company at a different location is halarious. When I need to call his store to ask if they have something our store doesn't, people look at me funny when I said "Hey big bro" or "Can you check if you have this item for a customer?....Aww! Why not!?" Of course he's joking. We always joke about how if we ever worked together, work would never get done cuz all we ever do is talk and laugh and make crack jokes and act like hyper children, meaning we'd never get anything done in the store. In some way's it's kinda good that the company wont let anyone with any family or dating relationships work together. Cuz whew, everyone in the company is either related or is dating someone within it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bumped into Kelly at the mall. Can't wait to hang out with her tomorrow for a bit. Hopefully take stuff off my mind. I'll be helping her and her sister prepare for their other sister's baby shower. Wow, can't believe the baby's almost here. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I'm really looking forward to is seeing Heather this weekend. She's so hard to get a hold of, but hey, I know she doesn't do it on purpose. She's on of those people I'd love to hang out with more though. She was gona for teh first part of summer and on Monday she'll be leaving for about a month...*sigh* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shawn's leaving for Winnipeg tomorrow/this morning. It's almost 3 am... and Shane has summer school and will be working at rogers all day-every day when he's done. There aren't too many people that I'm close to anymore and I feel as though I have no one. I gotta stay strong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yup, gotta hold my head up high. &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a possibility on me going to the phillipines with my mom for a few weeks. Damn, i'd love to go cuz I've never been in my entire life (other than going when my mom was pregnant with me).&nbsp; The question is, will I be able to last there with my breathing problems? I'm hoping to talk to my doctor about this first and then see if I can go or not. Also, I wont be back for the first week of school. Meaning I gotta figure out how to work that in. Arg...That's okay...all the first week of school is is shuffling people from class to class anyways...  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So here I am again....The Lonewolf...I'm lonely...and I miss him so much...If only he knew.  I gotta stay strong. If it ends here, then I have to end it right. The proper way. It can't end the way it is now.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, there's my first ramble. I hope I can stick to a routine to write in here at least every few days at the VERY least once a week.  From the depths of dispair....The Broken Heart -Lonewolf

         Okay first things first. I put my online journal here so that people could get a piece of my mind and what's going through it, although I haven't been putting in ANY of my deepest darkest thoughts. Let's start with this. This is for you to read and to keep to yourself. If you have something to say about what i wrote, make sure it wont piss me off.    That's right, the intense dark shadow that I have not seen in a long time is back. For the first time in a very long time i felt it's presence (I don't care if I can't fucking spell). This means that I saw my future again. That's right. It's a future without my dearest friends. Why? Gee...look what's happening. But let's be real. I should be able to cope with the little BS going on around me. I'm usual understanding when it comes to reality. Wait a secong...I'm cracking up. That means I WONT be able to handle diddly squat all right now.  You, you and you! I can't talk to you anymore. No I WONT talk to you anymore because it hurts to talk to people that are a bunch of bullshit liars. IT's one thing to lie, but for crying out loud! WHAT the hell are you peopel doing!? Stay away from me! That's right, I can't handle your crap! "He's not my friend!" my fucking ass. That's exactly why you love talking to him all the time and you care abotu his every fucking oppinion. Uh huh! SURE BUDDY! Oh, what's that? Can't live without me!? FUCK YOU TOO! You're the one that left!  YOU! I CARED FOR YOU! But Nooo you're too fucking special! YOU! You'll never be there for me no matter how much I want and need you to! YOU! I'll never be good enough in your eyes! YOU! You stabbed me in the back! YOU! You're a fucking hipocrit! YOU! I would have been a good friend if you acted like a better one to me! YOU! So what if I don't have a car! I'd walk in the freezing cold to spend time with you! YOU! I stuck up for you! You NEVER stick up for me!  I really can't handle anyone anymore. Like my vision always told me. I'm supposed to get away from it all. No matter what anyone says, I'll be alone and I'll be on my own. That means I'll have to fucking reach my dream by myself. No real support. Can someone please tell me what a friend is!? In the past 3 weeks, I've started hanging out with people I barely know or just met and they've proven to be such great people to everyone; themselves, to me, their friends, their family, strangers! WHAT THE FUCKING HELL! Is there something wrong with me!? YES! My friends are great! But I"M NOT! I'll leave them alone. I'll let them be joined at the hip and let them ignore me without giving them a second thought. FORGET IT! I'll get to the top without anyone!  It's just like i said. I'll dissapear. Someday I'll come back to step on those who crushed me...but what's that!? I believe in karmha! So I CANT step on you! not literally! I'll just crush you but letting you see how I'll be after all of you fucked over my life! I'm tired of helping people! But I can't help it! Do i get anything in return!? Oh sure...lots of stuff, but what about the things that AREN't materialistic! Read that NO MATERIALISTIC friendships.  What the fuck was I thinking!? A thank you dinner for my friends!? WHAT FRIENDS!? Thanking them for what!? Leaving me alone in my thoughts and when I cry or when I need them!? YEAH! Tha;ts what I'm talkin bout! THOSE PEOPLE!  My parents wanna know why I don't wanna celebrate my fucking 18th b'day party!? BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE NO FUCKING POINT!? Who's gonna be there!? My friends don't ask to change their plans to be there for their friends like I do! WHY did I WASTE MY TIME!? No one knows what kind of party I would have wanted. The people i would want to be there wouldn't be there! Maybe they don't exist...maybe that's why they never show up when I need them most...  So I sounds  crazy and fucked up now right? well guess what EXACTLY! Go on with your fucking life without me...wait, why am I telling you this? YOU'll DO IT ANYWAY!  Just make sure you shoot yourself when you see that I get sumwhere sumday and you don't.   There is no such thing as a friend. Only people who play with your mind and emotions. That's right. Two faced humans.  -The Lonewolf

           What can I say...*yawn* I'm all worn out. I worked from 12:30-5:30 today and had a great sales report. All of my stats were up to start the week off. I didn't wake up till 11:00 though...i had another late night last night but thank god it wasn't as late as other times.  After work, Amanda came over and we picked up my lil cousin Amanda lol. She's gonna stay at my place for a few days while my aunt prepares for a hair styling exam. *tired...* i dunno what to write. I've been really exhausted lately. But then again...that's the way i wanted my summer to be once in a while.  We had every intention of playing man hunt tonight but kevin's thing in hamilton today took way to fucking long. He didn't meet up with me and amanda till 10:45. Amanda and I met up with Tony (guy she's seeing) and his friend uh...I think it's Mickham...amanda things it's Beckham. Oh well. Either or. We went out for a drink at Williams and then went to Sportsworld for a couple games. Afterwards we went to the park for a walk. I REALLY wish we played manhunt cuz the weather was PERFECT! Nice and dark out, a little fog, a bit cool out. Damn it. We BETTER play it next weekend. Supposably Kevin knows of a party he wants me to go along with him to. Hmm. We'll see about that.  Manda and I are talkin online now about being sexually frustrated and shit like that. Good conversation to be honest. No we're NOT weird. I wanted to bring around my video cam today but I forgot it!! *cries* There were so many good moments to film...Wish i didn't miss it.  I'm most likely gonna sleep in tomorrow. maybe sumone can help me find boxes. I REALLY want my new bed before mom and opa go to the phillippines. If not, looks like I'm stuck without furniture. SOMEONE GIVE ME BOXES!!!  My lil cuz amanda and I are playing MArio party right now but I'm getting tired. I should go to bed. Wow. Everyone I'm talking to online is going to bed at this very moment...How wierd...  I'm off to sleep now.   And the day goes on the way you planned.  -The Lonewolf

        Chili, Nacho's and Oreo Milkshakes are a VERY bad mix altogether. Kev and I were really bored tonight and we drove around kitchener to find something to do...we ended up finding nothing and did our usual filming around and in the car thing. We stopped by jack astors for our food and then went back home with really bad stomache aches. Ugh... it hurts...  Earlier today I went in to work, thinking that I started at one...boy was i stupid...i didn't work at all today... I could have slept in... but nooo I got my ass up and went to work and got laughed at..yeah I laughed at myself for it. It proves that I love my job too much. I worked two hours for free and then went out for lunch with Kevin and hung out at the mall.  Later on we hung out at his place and talked online to people. I met up with Mike at McDonalds when I Told him to meet at Mac's corner store. lol...Anywho, i let him borrow ogr battle 64 last nght and he gave it back to me today. When he went home after i saw him today he was going to talk to his parents. I hope it went well.  I gotta work again tomorrow. We're all planning on getting together for a game of Outdoor manhunt. I hope I can get a hold of a lot more people. It'll be great playing out in rieverside park while it's dark out. Just like in gradeschool...heh.  I'm out for the night...I need sleep for tomorrow.    Open your eyes and you will see everything.  -The Lonewolf

          This one is probably going to be short.  I basically slept the day away today since I was up all night last night. Then Kevin came over and drove me to work. Melissa is our new ASM and she's hilarious. Damn she's funyn as hell and she make work fun.  After work, Mike picked me up and we talked. Earlier today he wasn't doing so well at all. I sent him a giant email explaining to him that I will always be there for him, friend or more, and he can always come to me to talk. I also told him that if he loved me as much as he claims, he'll come back to me someday after he's sorted out his problems. He's pissed off at his brother for being a big mouth and not respecting his privacy, he's pissed of at AJ for being a jerk and thinking he's going to be his friend again and he's been angry with his parents. Thank god...he's finally angry at them. He's finally angry at the right people.  I think I need to go to bed. I'm going to pass out...I'm really tired.  I'm working tomorrow. Hopefully I'll hear from josh when he gets back from NY. Shawn's back and I'm happy as hell. I can't wait to see him! I love you Shawny! Meggos's back too! I love you Meggo! Yey! Everyone's back (cept heather). I let mike borrow ogre battle for the night.  I'm picking it up from him tomorrow. I gave him his neckalce back that he left here a while back and i put the bracelet i bought him on his wrist again. He wore that hat i bought him today. The one where I sewed his name on the inside. I really do care for him still. I don't think anyone knows him like i do.  He's planning on moving out from his parents house once and for all and getting a job elsewhere so his homelife and work life to clash. Also, while he's on his own, hopefully his parents will have a better appreciation for him when he's on his own. I told him I'd help him search for a place and a job next week if he needs me to.  Well I should go to bed and put sumthing in my stomache since I'm starving. Night Night All!   Carpe Diem...  -The Lonewolf

           What an interesting night. Hmm...let's start off with earlier today. I basically did nothing but fix up my room a bit and finally got rid of a bunch of stuff.I mostly just have to clear out my closet and finish up with the rest of the posters that need to be put away. I got most of em. Other than that I sat on my ass in the morning and watched a few dramatic movies and cried my brains out to them cuz I'm a sap. Yeah...i had cookies for breakfast *tear* and now they're all gone! Hahaha...       So later on today Kevin ended up showing me a giant box from across the street cuz I can see into his friend Jeff's window the house behind the one in front of me. Yep, the box was big enough for me to put my stuff in. I ended up putting my stuffed animals and junk in it. So what happened next? Hmm...Kev came over at about ten or so and we hooked the Cube back up to my tv in what's left of my room. Suddenly I started talking to Katy, Amanda and my brother online. In attempt to show katy what my room looked like, she turned on her cam when i turned on mine and Kevin saw. Yep, he was like "Yo man! She's hot! Invite her over!" Freakishly enough, we picked her up at midnight and we jumped in the hot tub...for...well...y'know how you're only suposed to be in the hot tub for 30 minutes? When we got out and everyone was raiding my fridge, I noticed the time was after 3 am...we were in there for over 2 hours. It was actually really relaxing. I ended up looking at the stars for a long time. Hey! I even got a foot massage from both of them! Ha! Then Kevin kept talkin bout threesomes, telling me and katy to kiss and stuff like that. Then I asked him if he would get mad if I slept with his friend, jsut as a teaser. Hm...That was funny. Anywho, KEvin ended up taking his shorts off while in the hot tub and wanted katy and I to take off our shirts. I did, but I kept my sports bra on hahaha. Katy did for a short time but remained in the water with her hands over her chest. So ha to that.  Afterwards, we headed out to mcdee's and sat back for a short meal. Mmm late night fast food...I took the video camera along and bumped into mario. Haven't seen him in a while. Him and Cintia are still together. They've always been such a cute couple. When i first met mario i remember him and I raiding Becky's famous brownies at Lisa's party. Hmm...i could go for sum junkfood like brownies now...but my stomache hurts and I wanna go to bed.I have to finish my room tomorrow and I gotta work at 6 too.  Well, I'm off to bed. Another akward but very fun night. I hope there's more to come.   The Road ahead is long and winding.  -The Lonewolf

           First off I have to say FINALLY! YES! Jorel's car is the KOOLEST thing ever! Gotta love the turbo blow off valve...omg...i love that sound...I'ma get me one when I get a nice car...       Let's see....who did I see today out of nowhere? Lisa stopped by my store. HAven't talked to her in a while. Miss that chick. Um...Meggo surprised me when she came in with Ian at my store. I didn't know that she'd be back from vermont so soon. Who else?....ah yes...I saw mike...       What was i saying to Amanda? That's right...I told her on msn just now that now matter how much i hate a person, It kills me to see them breakdown...Yeah...I have a soft heart...sometimes too soft...so soft that I forget about how badly I'd get hurt...I wonder why i care for peopel so much sometimes... When I saw mike breakdown i couldn't let go of him...I can't believe that he thought we would still be together these past 3 weeks...How could he? He left without telling me, he was back on sunday...he didn't call me...And today, Kevin and I were driving around with the movie camera and we suddenly turned onto mikes street and I Shoed kevin where he lived. I saw mike's car had moved from his usual parking spot...It broke my heart that night...remembering that night and what i saw hurts me now...How he lived as though I weren't alive...It hurts..It hurts...It kills...but I'm living on. I'm trying..Yes, I'm taking deep breaths and remember how beautiful life is without remember people like Mike's parents...and i recall his brother telling the world about mike and my personal life...yeah...i'm not a big fan of that kid anymore...not at all... Mike has to remember that he makes his own decisions...and if he thinks his father is a wonderful man for telling an innocent girl crying on his doorstep to leave (no matter what the circumstances are)...then he's cold hearted and brainless. I've never met such horrible people in my life...and I feel terrible for saying that, but it's entirely true...       Cold hearted...brainless...selfish...rich...rude...snotty...narrowminded...conceited...those are the words that remind me of mikes family...  On a happier note for now...I'm looking forward to seeing my best friend shawn this weekend. I'm looking forward to talking to Megan tomorrow. I'm looking forward to seeing Heather when she gets' back and I'm looking forward to hearing from Josh when he's back frmo new York on saturday.  Yep...I'm still cleaning out my room. Almost done...Anyone got any boxes for me?...I can't wait for my new bed set...I'll finally live in my dream room and I'll be able to sit, relax and think in the atmosphere that I remember from my old house...    Your life is what you make of it...You are in control...  -The Lonewolf

             I took a notice to how everyone is having relationship problems lately...my best friend shawn and his gf had issues when it came to her family and shawn, kelly had a prob with her husband...big prob with him...gosh...i know there's a few more I'm jsut too tired to think of them. Not mentioning my own problems...         So what happened today? I hung out with Kelly of course! Good ol Chief and me went around town today. She got her helix pierced and we picked out a few things for her new place. Yeah...i talked about how much i loved interior design. I showed her where i got my new bed sheets (that I'm planning on using in my new room) and we chose out a small comforter. Then when we got to her place we picked out colours for her walls so we could paint them. She has THE coolest bachelorette pad ever! I want a place like that sumday! Well, single or not single. It's a really great place! We sat around talking about guys and what we've been up to lately. I really really wannt go clubbing with her sum time but no...I'm not 19 yet..Haha oh well, I'll live.         Okay...so once again jorel's car isn't ready. The part they needed got delivered late so it wont be ready till TOMORROW...damn...taking too long...the kool part is, they're cleaning the car out even more and they threw in a 300 dollar stereo system as an apology for it being so late. Pretty nice eh? My dad even liked the car when we stopped by to see it today.         I've been having a hard time breathing lately...who knows what it is..I need to refill my perscription...         So tomorrow I work, I'm hanging out with Kev and we're going to look at desks and stuff for my room, and then I'm going with my mom and my bro after work to pick up the car...I hope...stupid thing took so long! *Cries* hahaha. the car is sooo kool...         Yep...I can feel success in the palm of my hands. I wont let anyone take that away from me. I promise to dedicate all me success to all thsoe who ever put me down in my life. I don't know what it is...I've been thining abotu it a lot lately. I have to keep believing in my dreams in order to make it somewhere. I have to make my own choices and listen to my heart. I have to want to change and to live and to see two sides to everything in order to come up with a decision, a point of view or an action...yeah...lots to think about lately.         Almost been 3 weeks...hmm...my grandmother seemed fond of josh and she didn't even meet him. She just asked me who he was and said that he seemed very mature. I'm glad. Taht's a good sign. No weird questions or anything like that.         guess I should go to bed already...need to heal my breathing...                         One's actions reveal their true self. That's why he ran...he showed his true self...heartless...    -The Lonewolf

                So...still going slow on the room. Someone PLEASE help me. I hate taking things apart like this. Actually, you wanna help? Bring me sum big boxes! I need them!           Today I basically slept and talked online. I got a message from megan but she was online for a second when I was taking a nap in the basement. Arg! I can't believe I missed it!  got to talk to shawn today :)  I can't wait for him to come home. I want to give him the drawing i did of him in first semester.           Going with Jorel tomorrow to pick up his car FINALLY! Booya! Turbo engine! Yep, he promised I'd be the first one to ride in it! thanx for switching shifts with me kevin! Yay!           Tonight I was hanging with Shane and Kev. We kicked back to some KFC, chocolate bars, Mike&Ikes, Maltesers, what else...i dunno but i got sick in the end...yep..my stomache hurts...           I sat around today questioning life's beauty and the pain that we also feel. I was thinking deep again of course. It's funny how one moment I believe that life is full of surprises and is absolutely beautiful but the moment that one second change occurs, it's hell on earth... It's a hard thing to do, balancing out your emotions.          I wanna go shopping...i need new clothes to match my new room...I haven't been on a real shopping spree for clothes and not even close for a year or two now...damn that makes me sad. Yeah, I really should stop spending my paychecks so early....           Well....I should go to bed now. got a pick day tomorrow. Kel wants me to go with her to get a piercing...maybe the helix? That'd be kool.  I want my helix pierced too...hm...                                    Life is what you make of it. You take control. If you choose to follow, then follow. If you choose to love, then love. If you choose to fail, then fail. But if you choose to succeed, then try.  -The Lonewolf

              Today started like any other day. I woke up and i decided to sleep in a bit. I was purely tired from the night before so the only thing i wanted to do was stay in bed. Then the phone rand and I closed it out since I was still asleep to a vertain degree. It was josh and we booked to meet up tonight. We were supposed to go to elements but I couldn't go cuz my family had planned on going to toronto to meet up with my aunt and to go out for dinner. Mom and dad, of course, suggested that i should ask josh to come along. I did ask him and it felt really akward, but later he called me back with an answer...he said he could come with us. I was really surprised but yes, happy in every way. Of course the only thing on my mind about the situation was "my family is gonna scare him away" but honestly, i couldn't believe what I saw! He talked as if he knew them, he was friendly, he smiled and he openly understood everything around him! I was purely amazed. Wow, guess that adds on to reasons why I think he's cute! He'll be going to New York for a week tomorrow. I'm hoping to get together with him again to see Collateral starring Tom Cruise when he gets back.         Earlier i started taking apart my room again. This time I took apart the damn bed. I figured if I took the bed apart, I'd be forcing myself to clear everything on the floor and couldn't possibly hide everything everywhere. I'm not working tomorrow, meaning I'll be able to finally get this place emptied so I can paint it and get my furniture at last!         I emailed shawn today and told him everything that was going on lately. He left me a message on my computer and I had a huge smile on my face when i read it. I'm so glad he wrote back! I miss my best friend...Yep! See! here's proof! I'm writing about you in my journal shawny! I can't possibly forget u! Hahaha!         I really really really should be getting to sleep...but the problem is...I have no bed! Ha! Guess I'll go sleep on the couch! Nighty nighters!                               Small steps must be taken if you want to move on...  -The Lonewolf

               Today would have been my nine month with mike...yep...today...           I went to work today for a while. it was a good shift! Jorel picked me up for lunch and I went to his store for a couple hours till mom could pick me up. I went across the street to mcdonalds for a while and sat by myself, eating and thinking...imagine when I'm older...I'll be living in toronto on my own, taking care of my own life and minding my own business...that's the way it'll be. I know I'll be successful someday. I can feel it in my hands. I WILL make my dreams come true. I am truely happy living my life even when I'm down. Though life may feel like hell, i look back on the bullshit and tell myself it's all apart of the next step towards tomorrow.          My brother told me last week about how my dad saw something in me as a child that made him picture big things for my life. My brother admitted that it hurt to hear it, but it made him wonder what people saw when they got to know him and things like that. He told me that dad has high hopes for me. Whether my brother was making it up or not...it added on to me wanting to make it sumwhere even more. The fact that my family knows how to make me smile and they know how to live a happy life while also making others happy, is a big reason as to why I know I can be sumbody. They'll be there to support me. They respect me and I respect them. Everything I do will not only be for my sake, but for theres to say thank you to them for being such wonderful parents...yeah...they don't know it...but they are.           I met up with Amanda, Kevin and Tom tonight for a movie. We saw I Robot and I thought it was good. I liked it. Lotsa good stuff in it. At the end of the movie I chucked the pop corn bag over Kevin's head and he ended up taking th leftovers and getting me back. Ah, good times, good times...            Tomorrow I'm hoping to meet up with Josh at elements, but I'm supposed to be in toronto for my dad's b'day get together. I think I can get out of it. We already had his b'day party. This one is just basically meeting up with my aunt. I wanna go dancing again! It'll be my new workout! Ha! Josh will be going to New York for a week so I'm hoping to see him before he goes. *sigh* everyone is so far away... yep, megan's in vermont, shawn's in winnipeg, heathers in algonquin, god knows where mike is, mom and opa are going to the phillippines for a month, may's going to florida for a week...Oh well, I've got amanda and kevin to keep me smiling and busy!                    She looked back...and she became a pillar of salt...  -The Lonewolf

                  So today i hung out with my brother and no...we couldn't get the damn car! *cries* they moved it to monday. That's so evil... But anyways, we drove around today...a lot! We were at chapters for a bit checking out really kool art books and language guides. We stoppe by canadian tire and picked up new pedals and a shift handle for his car. Pretty spiffy stuff i say. I payed him back the cash i owed him and I still gott pay mom back for my hair cut...damn...i need money.              Man I'm tired...to be honest...I think this journal entry is gonna b really short.              I met up with josh tonight after his work. It was really great to see him. He's so cute. He's really interested in cars and we talked a bit about video games. Mostly cars. We couldn't meet up tomorrow night since it was his mom's b'day party. I'll most likely see him on sunday night. I hope i get back from toronto on time that night!              My room is slowly being taken apart...My schedule has been a bit messed up at the moment...yep...lotsa weird stuff going on in my life...Kevin asked me to hang out with him tonight sumwhere far but I couldn't go out that far...i wouldn't be allowed to at the moment.              Omg...I'm really falling asleep... Gotta go to bed. My ribs hurt from last night when tom picked me up from my ribs to pull me outside....i didn't feel the pain till this morning...

                      When was the last time that I hung out with Candice and Tom? IT was great seeing them again! We played our usual truth or dare game. We really dont' care how childish it is because it's not if you dare and truth the right tpye of things. Like Tom...he jumped into the pool at 11 pm naked...we only told him to jump in the pool...he did the naked part on his own...Candice knows I hate beer so I stuck to my vodka and pepsi.When's the last time i had that either? Hmm...I dont even remember the garbage I said or did two hours ago...that can't be good. I hate being an easy drunk!                   Mom made banana muffins today and I took sum to work. Yum...fresh home made goodness... Anywho, there were a bunch of retard kids that walked into the store asking us shit questions and being retards when they were probably my age and older. I fucking hate kids like that. I told my manager how much I hate seeing people my age act like shit heads and he said "you should have said to them -why are you guys being retards?- and if they said anything to me about what you said I'd say, -she didn't say that. what are you talking about?- and i don't think the rest of the customers in the store would have cared if you said anything." lol i should have sid sumthin to them damn it!                   MWAHAHA! cna you believe we're picking up the Turbo Talon tomorrow!? I can't wait! VrooomPSSSHT! I love that noise of the blow off valve....taht thing is so cool....it's gonna scare the shitty ricers in my neighbourhood. I hate it when they try racing the benz...it's like "okay...we're not racing you" so when they drive off when the light turns green and we just mind our own business, what does it prove? Honestly...stupid cambridge kids...                    I get paid....omg it's 1 am! that means I got paid! Woohoo! I better check how much money I have...it'll probably be zero by tomorrow....yeah...i owe my mom and my brother money....damn it.                    I went to Karate and got my hair cut today. How great. It felt nice having my hair fixed up! Paul is the greatest guy ever. The sensei and the hair stylist all in one....though he hasn't taught me for 4 years. But man, Kelly taught me some new moves in class today...it completely threw me off from the old style to the new style...now i know why I can't wear my red belt anymore since I last taught there...I'm a white belt again! *Cries* nah, actually it's cool. It's neat that I have another goal to get to again.                     Guess i'm off to bed now. No i will NOT wake up to a hangover nor am I drunk anymore...so...I'm gonna go wash my face, get changed, brush my teeth and all that junk. Nighty Night!

                        That's a god song by Sugar Jones. They're such an under rated band that ended too quickly. Too bad :(                    Anywho! Today my brother and I went out to look for car accessories and he ended up buying a new 200$ navigational watch...i want one...*drools* it can even recieve msn messages...*i want it more* LMAO! Actually I saw a wide screen lap top for really cheap so I think I'm gonna save up for that!                    I can't wait for my new room....I'm still emptying it out...yes I'm slow...I'm a lot weaker than I useta be...I wonder how much harder my slap would have been 2 years ago in comparison to when i hit mike recently... I probably woulda knocked him out with my old strength! but gosh...I'm as weak as a kitten now. I'll be going to karate tomorrow...I've misse the last few spots...arg... i need to train more.                    Yay! i talked to josh today and it's for sure I'm meeting him on saturday for a movie and possibly mini golf. I'm so excited :) Kevin took over my computer while I was talking to him online and well...ah! i hate when people touch my computer lol! Ack, I feel bad. I was boring when he was hanging out here today so he left early. Arg! Damn me and my boy crazy night.                    I'm still questioning where mike is...As much as everyone is telling me to forget him because of so many different reasons....i still wonder if he's thinking of me at all...I wonder if he cares abotu what his parents said to me and to my mom that night...

              Woohoo! My brother and I went to look at a car in Toronto today and he bought it! Yup! A nice and purdy Eagle Talon Turbo! BOOYAKA! Yes...I AM hyper...and I'm in a slightly better mood today. We test drove the car and it was amazing! the turbo engine on it was great! Smoke all the lil civics in the neighbourhood. Now, I'm not a big fan of american cars, but the talon is still mitsubishi! Well...the turbo one is...the ESI version is just a neon engine put inside a nicer body.          We stopped off at a store to buy paintball equipment for my bro. I'm considering buying myself a paintball gun so that I can start going. The only problem is my breathing. i can't run cuz of my terrible health.            Today I learned more closing procedures at work and a few more keyholder responsibilities. I'm really liking it and I'm getting the hang of things. I'm gaining a bit more confidense in myself towards work. Once i get more hours and a better paycheck, I'll be able to buy off all the games in my hold bin!          I got to talk to Josh today online. I'm so happy! We're possibly meeting up on saturday to hang out. I'm most likely going to elements again to meet up with him this weekend. Kevin and I will probably head out there.         My neck is itchy...I wore Mike's necklace a few nights ago when i went dancing...and i forgot how allergic i was to it...i can't wear metal...ow! somebody stop the burn!          Well, I'll be home all day tomorrow until karate starts and then I'll be hanging out with Kevin to play games and binge on junk food once more. In the morning I'll be clearing out my room cuz I'll start painting it on thursday. YAY! My new room! I can't wait!                       Just keep smiling.      -The Lonewolf

              Once again I didn't write online last night cuz I was hanging out with Amanda and Kevin. Yep, we went to Elements and I had a pretty good time. I'm glad Amanda did too. I just hope Kevin cheers up for different reasons.         At first, the music was a bit bland and it wasn't loud enough. There were so many teeny boppers there I was kinda afraid hehe. All of them were short and hadn't hit puberty yet. Wow, I actually got to feel tall for a night! Yay!         Later on was a lot better. Amanda ended up dancing and getting to know a guy and I started to dance and talk to someone really cute. He seemed like such a sweet heart. I hope I get to talk to him again.            We had a hard time getting a hold of drinks before we went, so we ended up trying my mom and dads whisky. Oh...did that hurt...it was a hell of a lot stronger than i thought it was. I ended up stopping after a couple. Amanda kept going and Kevin downed some when we got home after dancing. We took pictures before and after we went and we caught a bunch of boring/weird things of us on video. Thanx for buying me a new tape for my camera Kevin!          Today I worked for a few hours and had some fun learning a thing or two about stuff I could do to get me bonus points as an employee. I'm really getting use to how long and how often I go to work now. In fact, even though I always knew i had a great job and loved it, now I can say I REALLY REALLY love it! There's something about it that I've gotten use to. I'm really feeling more comfortable being myself at work now. It's better than having panic attacks at my old job, that's for sure. The crazy thing about today? I went to work with abosolutely no make up! Funny, 2 years ago you would have had to hold me down with a couple wrestlers on each side of me to get me to wear make up. Nowadays, I'm your average girl putting on make on when i go out someplace. Of course I still refuse to wear mascara...           Well, I'm going to go sit outside in the warm sun right now. Maybe I'll draw or read while I'm out there. I wonder if I'll like this book that Heather's telling me to read. Hm...maybe I'll do  what I was doing earlier when I came home from work. Maybe I'll sit down in the back yard and take in the beauty around me :)                      Holding On, Moving On...  -The Lonewolf

      Well I didn't write in my journal last night cuz I knocked out after Melanie and Kevin were over. I ended up falling asleep on the basement couch and waking up to a sore throat and a terrible head ache. Fun fun...  Last night was great. The three of us were depressed as hell so Kevin bought us a shit load of junk food. Cake, cookies, smarties, chips, pop, salsa...oh man...i was pretty sick in the morning. we caught it on video too! We called it our fun and depressed junk food night. Yeah...I had to throw my comforter in the wash today cuz we spilt salsa, crums and cake on it. Ooo messy! So when we were asking each other on teh video camera the cause of our troubles...it was obvious what mine was, melanie's was C and Kevin's was A. Love sucks... it really does...it causes so much fucking pain and we knew it!  Today I went to Ikea with Mom and Kevin. Mom was amused as hell cuz kevin kept making us laugh. I haven't seen one of my friends make mom laugh that way in a long time.  Looks like I'm not going anywhere other than places in Canada this summer. Yep. The deal is, if I stay home, my parents are remodelling my room. FINALLY! My dream room! I'm getting a new Double sized bed and a bunch of ikea shelves :) I can't wait! We're painting my room white (the way I've missed my old room)!!! I picked out new sheets and I needa new comforter. I'm emptying my room out now so we can start painting it by probably the end of the week. LALALA I'm soooo excited!  So tomorrow we're all going to Elements. Fun fun fun! Can't wait for that either! Gonna be spending some time with some great people! Of course I hope that I can get rid of this headache by then. I wanted to go drinking with Candice last night, but I was out shopping with my mom for too long so it was too late by the time i called candice *cries* I want my vodka! lol!  Chin up, Fist high.  -the Lonewolf
