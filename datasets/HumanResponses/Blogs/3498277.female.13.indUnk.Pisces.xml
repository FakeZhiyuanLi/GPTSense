      OK Aaron, the boy with condoms from the play that i mentioned earlier-- i thought he was gonna leave me alone now but today his friend spencer gave me this note--  Julia, As you know i like you and well... i was hoping maybe you had maybe got over your ex-boyfriend. And i know you cant just get over your ex but i just wanted to know.  because if you were i was hoping me and you could go do something together. and if you are ready maybe we could go out. So what do you think? -Aaron  so i didnt respond, right? but i showed the note to Dani and Christine and Madison. then during notes for ACT II,and spencer had seen me so he gave me this other note that aaron wrote to him b/c he thought it would make it better:  Spencer, i like julia but i dont know if she likes me. I know she said that she thought i was a great guy but she also said that she needed time to get over her ex boyfriend but i dont know when she will be over him. I know it takes time but it has been a month plus days. i want her so bad but i do not want to make a move until she is ready. so im hoping she will tell if she likes me. -Aaron  the getting over my ex boyfriend thing was, by the way, an excuse because i mean he is nice and he is kind of hot but HE CARRIES CONDOMS AROUND!!! HE'S AND EIGHTH GRADER!!!and also, he seemed like really over sensitive. so i figured he was either really sincere or really fake and oh such a jerk. jack saw that i had a note and he asked me about it (he's lookin out for me he's like a big brother)and i let him read both of them. after reading the first one he asked me if i responded and i said no and he said smart move. after he read the second one, he said   "No. no. see, i know aaron, and he only wants two things. he wants a relationship, and he wants sex. he's playing this game.this is the way it works at his school.the girls at his school...this works with them. see once he gets you..." "you need an eighth grade version of me. i know a couple of those...i think i was like that for a while, but i realized it wasnt working. its alot better this way" jack is a good guy. jack is my foster (couldnt figure out how to spell surregit) brother. and he needs to go ahead and call my sister!!! for those of you who read MY LEG IS ASLEEP (my sister's blog), jack is, infact, the "hot play guy" her blog is at http://my-leg-is-asleep.blogspot.com  ttyl

Pachelbel's Kanon is the one i really wanted to play, and ill get to so its yayish. but this way i dont have to play pomp and circumstance or chorale, both of which i dont like, so its all good. i would like pomp and circumstance if i wasnt on second. first is pretty. chorale is just boring all around.  but thats ok. hey, i fixed the time. exellent. im on the east coast like im supposed to be now.  the flaky biscuits were very good as promised.  we're not having people over anymore today. i dont have to move my ass off this couch until five oclock if i dont want to. oops...i just did...teehee

      Today is sunday. I woke up and like laid in bed for like an hour. And then i had a doughnut. And then i started watching the Cheers 48 hour marathon. then i did work outside on the pool because we're having some people over tomorrow. *sigh*. this has been like an amazingly boring day. the only good thing will be rehersal tonight. yay! i'll get to see maddie. Adrienne (the director keeps telling me im going into story mode when im telling that     STORY in the third scene. IMAGINE THAT. i dont know how to stop though. but she said its getting better. Nick wasnt there yesterday so the kiss scene was me like standing there. lol. i   think he'll be there today though. i need to relax with that. Dani and Christine are like obsessing over nick. or atleast they were. dani keeps asking me if i think he's cute. i cant really think about him that way though. its wierd. being forced to kiss him so much kind of makes it impossible to do. hmm...opposite of what you'd expect, huh? no school tomorrow!! and then only three more days. whoa. im OLD.     urlLink      I am Rapunzel!  urlLink  Find your fairy tale character  at  urlLink kelly.moranweb.com .    thanx, andriia ;)

      Guess who called me again last night? AARON! THATS RIGHT! AARON CALLED ME AGAIN!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH i have caller ID so i looked at the phone and braced myself. he asked me why we hadnt talked in like two days. i said i was just in a really bad mood yesterday, and i didnt really think he wanted to talk to me. and then he asked me if there was anything wrong today and i was like well not really. and then we talked about a bunch of random stuff, including where we're going to highschool. i said i would go to public school but my parents wont let me. theyre overprotective. and he's like well i can understand that, youre a beautiful girl and they dont want you to get hurt. i was like...ok... and then he got around to "we should do something after the show" and i said "yeah i think everybodys goin to la carretta" and hes like "no i mean after the run of the show we should do something, like go see other shows or something" and im like "yeah we should get a group of people together and do that, that would be fun" aaron: "i knew you were gonna say that...i was waiting for you to say that" me: "what do you   expect   me to say, aaron?" aaron: "You're freaking out" me: "and   how   do you want me to respond to that???" aaron: "chill" me: "what is the purpose of saying that? is it to get me to calm down and...(do what you want me to do)" aaron: "julia- chill. calm down. ive gotta go.bye"  NO I WILL NOT CHILL AARON!!!!!!AAAARRRGHH!!!!! Opening night tonight! yayayayayay! i think im ready. i think the cast is ready. its a pretty good show, i think. tonight's show is sold out, so thats good. before the show i have the luncheon thing at the country club before the TIP recognition thing. and then i go to Wait Chapel, and then i go home and relax and call is at six thirty! ooo im starting to get nervous...eeeeeeeeeeee

      i thought i was off the hook after aaron called me last night...i was wrong, i guess! ugh. I came into rehersal yesterday absolutely exhausted and in a really bad mood. i was feeling really overwhelmed by the whole aaron thing, i had been at emerald pointe all day, and i hadnt slept well the night before. so i really didnt feel that great. Jack came in from eating at La Carretta, and he was talking to aaron and alexis and nick and everybody. i was like jaaack...and shot an evil glance at aaron. he was like come here, and we went over and sat on the stacks of chairs and i told him about what i said to aaron and him calling me. Jack said that he was trying to cover his tracks. Or if he's mature, he was calling me for closure (or what he sees as closure). I tried to calm down a little bit, and we started running the show. that made me feel a little better. it made me feel a little better until i was sitting with Dani and Christine, and they gave me another note. it was folded up and it said Cristin (hehe he cant spell christine right)in aarons handwriting. my stomach just dropped. i was like not again!!! They told me i absolutely could not let aaron know that they had given me that note. dani actually said "put it in your pocket! do not read it until you are home safe in your bedroom and you have locked the door!!!" so of course, at break i went in the bathroom and read it. even after jack had told me not to. i couldnt help myself. Dani and Christine came in the bathroom with me. As i read it, my eyes widened and i could barely stifle a scream. Dani and Christine were trying to shush me...it wasnt working too well. i counted to ten, went back into the rehersal hall, and sat down next to Jack. I thought i was saying "Jack, i read the note even though you told me not to" but i guess he couldnt understand me that well. "whats the matter, did he say something?" i told him that i read the note again. "Why'd you read it, jules?" i didnt know why. i said i had to read it, but i think i was too exhausted to feel suspense. i probubly would have if i was feeling normal. i gave the note to jack and told him to read it but told him to make sure aaron didnt see him. we did ACT II. when that was over jack beckoned to me. he said "is this really bothering you" and i nodded my head. then he asked me what i want. i asked him what he meant. he just said "what do you want?" and i said that i dont know. Then we had to go over to the trailors b/c Annie Get Your Gun had to rehearse, and they're a mainstage show so they have the right of way if you will. we sat down in the trailor and jack told me that it looks to him like aaron is talkin about all this depressing stuff like how bad his life is, but then he sees him laughing and acting normal, when im the one whose upset and putting emotion into it. he said he's trying to put me on a guilt trip and i need to just not think about it. then we ran the last scene and worked out curtain call. im inbetween jack and nick, and when the other line is bowing jack keeps using me as an arm rest. lol. he's great. maybe nothing will happen with aaron today...maybe... today we have the closing ceremony at school. next year we r gonna b eighth graders, and rule the school...hehehe. revenge! yes!
