      Ok so the orientation started...n classes started too!~!~...n honestly..first official physics lesson n im as if in another land...hardly observing wat the teacher is teaching..everything is in english n our brain cells have to work harder to translate the usual malays context tat we learned....ok..maths was ok...chemist was ermm...ok gua????  Anyway...each lower six student we're given an  EGG  to be taken care of...we're suppose to take care of the EGG the entire week...not to be broken or stolen by other group members..once broken consider lost...means u have to pay for another egg n also be fined..n the fined is actually dancing on the stage in front of 80++ lower 6 students n seniors....lots of them..n also protect it from stolen by the seniors.... we're also to reply letters written by seniors...each student receive a letter...n reply....n so on n on....n guess wat..the EGG n LETTER thing is actually tradition....not only in La Salle... ok...they were a few games today..so far...their ok.... they will be more tomorrow.....considering we're stayin for 10 hours in school everyday..... classes will start all tomorrow too...since well..most of them started liao......n we got two new girls from keningau....which makes our class 51 students.... form 6 is damn hard...OH No......

      Ok..i was tired n i forgot to mention tat during our erm...last introduction..which is my Maths Statistic teacher..he's young..n he's well a bit funny in a sort of way..n he ask us to introoduce ourselves one by one...our name..previous school..n also our Maths n Add Maths Results.... ??????????!~!~!?~!~!~! .....well the fact tat i din score well in my add maths..duh....  The la Salle Canteen  sucks ...worse than all saints..worse than Lokyuk...Its small..not much variety.....n its well..very Malayish...if thats wat u called it... Duh....i need to bring my own lunch bag....  N it seems to me that is either La Sallians are use to mingle up around boys too often..they doesnt seem to be GENTLEMEN at all....N they got well...picked by our MUET teacher...a lady with  superb  english...really superb.....well anyway she said sth like ex-lasallians from our class should have show us or guide us a bit lah..instead of mingle back to their own group..should have set examples or sth...well in which ovbiusly they didnt...hahahhaha......n well they called this SHY....heheh..since there is only about around one class of girls if all the girls add up together..in the entire school...since La Salle only  accepts  girl starting from Form 4...in which majority of the girls are in Form 6.......  N orientation to be dread the entire week........
