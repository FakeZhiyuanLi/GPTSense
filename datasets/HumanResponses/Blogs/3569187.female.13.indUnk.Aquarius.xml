      I love to play soft ball its my favorite sport and I'm pretty good at it. And well not to be conceded but I carry the team I'm the best on the team so they expect a lot out of me right? Well I mess up once and so does everyone else we all made a mistake but for some dumb reason I get blamed that we lost every one made me feel bad about it which is so retared you know. Anyways so I'm one of the most hated people in our school because of what they say is that I'm pretty and I get a lot of guys which is not true I hardly even date guys. And one of my best friends is kind of the opposite of me and she dates a lot of guys gets drunk stupid shit like that well everyone likes her, but not me they hate me because some one they like, likes me and I don't even like them anymore its was along time ago. Which they should be able to get over like I would you know. Now they want to beat me up and basically make my life a living hell which is working out pretty damn good for them. I just want them to like me and I want a best friend that will stick with me through thick and thin....
