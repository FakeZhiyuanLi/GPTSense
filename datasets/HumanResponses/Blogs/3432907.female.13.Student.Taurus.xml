      Lauren, you are cool.  Well... ok yea your cool.  And you throw good parties.  Sorry- bonfires.  I got pretty damn cold though.  Jumping in the pool WITH my clothes on was probably a little stupid.  But oh well. I got to wear Larry's pants so I guess it was all good. lol that was weird.  Sam needs to stop sniffing sharpie's. sharpies are bad for you.  they destroy brain cells and shit. if ur gonna get high at least use somethin good.  such as, maybe, oxy cotton?  lol. dont ask.  I went to go see that movie 'the day after tomorrow'. Oh god it was funny.  They attempted to stick every possible movie element in there AND use too many special effects, all at once. and it just wasn't working.   The general plot was that there was another ice age coming, and for all the science geeks they stopped and detailedly explained exactly how that would happen.  Then they have the main characters- a father and son- get dramatically seperated.  The intense father-son connection was over-dramatic and... retarded.  There was a scene in which the honor-student son stays on the phone with his father as water slowly rises to like, his nose, and then he fucking STAYS there and almost dies.  Its supposed to be moving, i think.  They also throw in the totally pointless touch of some kid with a tumor.  then there's the amazing romance of a divorced couple falling back in love, oh so very over-used, and the son falling in love with a girl he gets stranded in a library with for the entire movie. he risks his life for her like, 4 times.  there is also a scene in wich she shrugs off her jacket and holds on to him half naked.  of course, logically, when your crush holds on to you half dressed and your a 16 year old boy the first thing you say is 'what are you doing'? and, duh, the logical answer is (this said slightly monotone) 'i'm using my body heat to keep you warm'.  To add to the drama and suspense, there are timberwolves on the loose during the movie.  yea. not even going to try to explain why the hell they threw that in there.  but OK the special affects were good, and hey, they tried. i just dont recommend spending the 8 bucks to go see the damn movie.     anyways, we started packing for OHIO today. goddamn it.

      Hey guys.  I think I finally found a hosting site that will satisfy me. But I guess I'm still not done so I could be wrong. So far it's pretty cool.  Thanks to Stacy for discovering the niftyness here, I kinda stole this site off her profile on AIM.    Stacy's my home dog.  We've been kind of drifting apart lately though, which sucks because we're BOTH moving so yea.  All my buddies are moving.  It sucks so bad.  In case you haven't heard, I'm moving to Ohio.  Oh joy.  Thats okay though, I'm sure something big will be waiting there.  Or it could be a bunch of cheap-ass hicks.  Even then though, maybe I'll wreck a tractor in somebody's haystack or some shit like that.  Well, since I'm not gonna really specify a subject in this post I don't want to go into to much detail with any of this stuff. More posts later, I promise.  Byye guys!  --If your reading this then I love you!!--
