       Rreaching out to the wolf, and reaching out for the human they both fall to the ground. Waking up to see the moon overhead and lying on soft cloth under a willow tree. Semily looks around wondering were she was, what happened and what the time was. Then she saw a woman and a wolf appear. At this time Arou was thinking the same thing. *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  The woman said to Semily, "You are finally awake. You might be wanting to know who I am. I am Serena, Mistress of wolves and this is Manri. We are the ones who made you meet. You might know me as Ella." She said changing herself into Ella, Semily's best friend. Manri said this to Arou chaging into Liry heer best friend. *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *   Then Serena explained, "We wanted you to meet for a reason that only must find out. Here in Gesusa we need you to complete a quest that only you can do. You must find the crystal of Lissar and return it to its rigthful owner. You only can find this out.              "Onto you and with this word,              Speak the tounge of each of hers.              Go to lands, complete this quest              Only you can do the rest!"

        Running as fast as she could, hitting stones, and dodging trees, she sees the full moon through the trees and howls. They're dawning upon her now she as keeps on running, burning with excitment, she howls again. "You won't make it, Arou!" the pack yells to her. "I can, just watch me!" she yelled back. She howled again, then came to a sudden stop and looked back. They were gone and she was alone, only with the moon infront her. Looking at the cliff opposite her for a way to land and then she looked down. There was no other way, she had to jump.                                  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *   She had everything she needed, her necklace that Ella gave her, her knife, her backpack with some food and some clothes. Everything was ready, all she needed to do is get out of the house. She climbed out the window and jumped onto the roof, then from the second floor to the hill. She made it! Then, ran to the cliff with the moon behind her. Semily always had this feeling that there was something on the other side waiting for her. As the moon came to the middle of the sky, she was at last at the cliff. But the only on the other side, was a lonely white wolf staring directly at her with a ambitious look in it's face.                                 *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  The moon was directly in the gorge now, both human and wolf were looking directly at each other. Then Arou started running towards Semily. Semily took two steps back.  Arou leaped  and howled. Semily stepped back again, watching Arou fly into the moon. Then Arou felt a tingle on the sides of her, Semily's necklace gowled, then wings grew out of Arou and she flapped the feathery wings and howled a painful cry as Semily screamed in pain.
