        It seems that TamilNadu has once again got a  urlLink lions share  in the current ministry. It had to- afterall it gave all the 39 seats the  urlLink Democratic Progressive Alliance(DPA)  it has to be seen what they will be able to do for the state. it is heartening to see that after a long time the country is being ruled by a seasoned professional rather than a hardened politician. i think this bodes well for the country as a whole as this would herald the begining of a more serious era in Indian Politics. Hoping for the best- But the Govt. has to face many challenges- from it's own allies this time.  urlLink TRS  has already started making noises in that direction- of a seperate state for Telangana. Laloo has already made it clear that he wont join the govt. without having the restraint of Collective responsibility that  participation in Govt brings, Laloo can and will be a nuisance to the effective functioning of the government.He will continue to make noises of Bihar's Pride- just a mascot for a better bargain. The state of Bihar's pride is being seen in every corner of India.  The  urlLink Common Minimum Program  as proposed by the Congress led alliance is a program of Left- as already mentioned- i dont beleive in privatising loss making companies and telling disinvesment. Disinvestment has always been in  aprofit making Industry.The Govt is there to Govern not to run factories-but it India it runs factories, Trains, Buses, Generate, transmit distribute Electricity and what not except Governing. This has to change.Lets see if that Change- Only if this change, Politicinas can be made accountable for their Duties and what they are supposed to do. Nou they find reason in running these Functions for not governing. The Politics will change- Let me see what is in store for India. Nothing can Stop an Idea whose Time has  COME  -  ManMohan Singh .  Has that Idea Come??????????

        This is a very good article I'm reading after a very long time. Completely analytical and devoid of any jingoistic ideological baggage. the author has taken a very good view of ground realities and given a good analysis of the options available to the  urlLink BJP . the  urlLink Congress  any way has made it very easy for its future leaders- read rahul or priyanka or both to adorn the mantle of leadership without any thing hindering their image. But India is engaged in singing the praise of Sonia that it has no time to think of any thing else.when the entire nation speaks something you need guts to speak the opposite and the auhtor seems to have it in abundance. i think  urlLink IE  would be the only newspaper to have it.

        The politics is taking a different turn with the announcement by Sonia Gandhi that Mr. Manamohan Singh will take up the top post.I somehow get a feeling that sonia is making the path of her children less tough. we have papers that  urlLink claim her  to be the tallest Indian and equating her with Mahatma and Christ, telling us hou this act of her( urlLink Renunciation ) had turned the tide off from the BJP's foot and hou this act wouldf usher us in the erz of morality in politics. I for one doesnt beleive in this view. Had she been that good as claimed, then she must have not accepted the position of the Congress Leader. Nou Mr.Singh is  urlLink promising  Reforms with Human Face. I dont understand the logic behind reforms with human face. Hou can u take away subsidies without affecting anybody?. i am comlpetely at loss.May be some economist has to clarify that.

        It is yet again in the open- Leftist's idealogy through the back door. I admire the leftists in this- they are never at the front of storm and they get what they wanted. may be they r true bunch of cowards. They have led to a crash of another 230 points and off gone Rs.50,000 Crore, may be they dont knou hou many zeroes are there in a Crore. I doubt they might know.After all they have been counting the number of " ". They have stalled the Power reforms in the name of "Redistribution of Poverty". I wonder why they should distribute Poverty when that energy can be used to create wealth to all. May be their world view is so negative to even see that. Its time Leftists understand that r else it would be too late for the country.

        This behaviour is not expected of any Indian all the more of a CM of an Indian State. I dont knou how can any person in a responsible position like this. I am shocked. Our Jawans need support for protecting the same people who are least concerned about them. Brave Soldiers. Let us be Indians.

        Atlast Left had had its way. This is unfortunate. If u r not goin to abandon Disinvestment, then there has to be a seperate ministry for it-isnt it?. The real Free india will come into being only when the Left is silenced. Hell with the Left! Left is the prime reason for what India is today. The Leftist Idealogy didnt let Nehru perform and the same "Idealogy" is ruining India even nou. In the name of equity they are wasting Tax-payers money in Govt.Monoliths. I wonder when they will come down to earth and understand the reality.

        There is no surprise in this state. As invariably happenign in India alliances are not formed on any idealogical plank but in the sole motive of keeping the other party out of power. This sort of negativism doesnt take India to anywhere, other than Grave.We have parties openely saying that they come together only to keep BJP out of power without any shame in telling so. They should be ashamed to say so as the state of politics has come to such a pass that other's fall is hailed ur victory and not ur own victory. Parties take pride in not they had won but that the other had lost. I only hope  this too will pass

        The mood in the Newspaper circles over DMK's dilly dallying and  Tail wagging the Dog  story is one of disdain and i share it with them. In his mad hurry to settle scores with Jayalalitha, Karunanidhi is acting in a irresponsible manner and it doesnt speak well of him. This is not the way to extract what u want. Also it seems to suggest that there are two power centres in the government what with Mr.Dayanidhi Maran announcing that" Sonia's Intervention" was the key. This suggests that ManMohan Singh wasnt keen on giving this to DMK but Sonia overruled him. Also this wasnt the way DMK behaved with NDA. It was a willing follower and it never arm twisted Vajapayee.May be that was bcoz of his towering image and that anyone in Congress lacks them. Already things are moving that way with Musharaff inviting Sonia to Pakistan.Is pakistan playing games with India?. He hasnt Invited PM but the leader of the party heading the government. This may also be to drive a wedge between the party and the Govt. The PM should not give in to these gimmicks and see to that govt functions smoothly.

        The  urlLink gamble  that Karunanidhi played has paid off. Today morning i was reading a news bit in IE about the  urlLink whining  going on in the DMK head's mind.However, i never expected the solution to be so quick.Anyway once he had had his way, i wonder what will be Jayalalitha's plight now. He had got the Revenue Portfolio with him and many of the cases on Jayalalitha would have to be vetted by the Revenue department.Hope some wisdom will prevail upon the septuagenarian and he will understand that Jayalalitha was trounced in the elections precisely because of her  urlLink high handedness  when dealing with Political Opponents.

        Chidambaram as finance minister is better for india. though being not a supporter of congress i think chidambaram to be the right candidate for the job. he is capable of delivering and this is a clear message for the left about their role in the economics of the new government. i think Leftists cannot understand the nitty gritties of the market as they dont even want to listen to the other side of the story.For them, their's is the only story and there can be nothing different from their's. The one thing i would like to coment particularly here is the apparent thought in the congress or any other camp about correcting the blunders of the previous govt in the national interest. I dont understand hou can anyone assume what they do is in the national interest and what ever others have done has been antinational. this meatlity of politicians really baffles me. Iam at loss to understand this phenomenon across the ploitical divide. Lets see what this govt will do towards the  urlLink Golden Quadrilateral . it would be a silly and costly mistake on the part of congress to ignore the project.

        This is  THE  most hilarious posting still in the congress ministry. I have never seen a man like  urlLink LALOO  and I don't think I will ever see such a man in my life time.He is the sort of man who told Computers are not necessary for Bihar.Nou what will he say?. Just my Imagination(who knous- it may turn out to be true) 1.Railways doesn't need Electric Engines-they can run with bullock. 2.Reservation of seats based on caste- No Upper Berth(No upper Caste) 3.All Trains to pass through Bihar- even ahmedabad to Mumbai trains. 4.All trains to have a separate coach for cattle n fodder 5.Railway staff can do reservation by paper and pen- computers to be abolished. 6.India to be made a Bihar in 3 months. 7.Indian Prime Minister will be asked to travel in Trains to all the countries in the world as Ingenious Technology will be used. 8.Instead of tickets the passengers can give a Kg of fodder to feed the cattle in his house. 9. Remaining will be issued in the next order......

        The decision by the apex court of the country doesnt reduce the high respect I have for the judiciary. The bench instead of viewing this as a settled matter just because she has declined to accept the post of PM nou, should have taken a view of the future.What will the honourable bench do tomorrow if she again tells that "My innner Voice tells me to take up the Post of PM". Will there be any one to Protest the decision then?. I hope the bench will reconsider its decision sometime. It is unfortunate and the lawyer is pitiable to have shell out Rs.30,000 for the petition.

        I should have posted this b4. Now they have removed the link from sify. Actually i read that Laloo had said that God only must save the passengers of Indian Railways.He had said that God Vishwakarma must save the passengers as he is the god of machines. That He is the real minister and laloo is just donning his mantle.What will the communists with strong "Anti-Hindu-God" belief do now?. Will they withdraw the support to the congress Government as it has openly become communal- one of its most important minister has invoked the name of god. They were holding the secularist's flag high when the Saraswathi Song was played by the Previous Govt. But now Vishwakarma has been Invoked n running the ministry. Atleast the previous govt only prayed to god. This Govt is truly god sent as it partners with the god and is a representative of Him.

        I thought I have already riten about this topic but a recent blog has made me to change my mind. The so called denunciation of the PM's post by Sonia Gandhi is nothing more than a strategic decision keeping in her mind her ability and capability. I don't think even in my wildest possible dreams that she is a person capable of ruling India, leave aside the foreigner part of it. The mere fact that it took her about 15 years to become Indian speaks it all. How did she not know that she would be "elected" by the parliamentarians of the congress if it wins the election. This oversight might be coz She didn't expect that congress would win. Plain and simple. When NDA was able to project its candidate why was there no mention of Sonia not in fray if it is that Inner Voice was there b4 the elections, then why was she not declared "not in fray". Double Standards- Indian have been, are and will be easy prey for these people.

        The title tells it all. Iam confused on what to put after the word. Should it be surprise or should it be question. Considering that the PM has asked all the states( Inculding the ones ruled by Congress), it seems to prove that all claims of Congress that they have been ruling nicely have gone into din, or so it seems. MAy be PM didnt think it fit to seperate Non-Congress ruled states for criticising and goding for good work.

        This news had been doing the rounds for quite some time. I am not surprised at the silence of the Red Brigade at this. They would be at the fore front on any religious issues concerning any other religion. When it comes to Hindus Communists would be no where to be seen. They are "secular" you see, they cannot interfere in Religious matters. When it comes to extending the Haj Pilgrimage or increasing the Stipend to the Haj, they would come out and support any kojoling up actin by the Govt, but not in the case of HIndus. It happens only it India( Read it like the popular song)

        Rabri Devi died and went to heaven (Don't Laugh). As she stood in front of yamraj, she saw a huge wall of clocks behind.  She asked, 'What are all those clocks?'  Yamraj answered, 'Those are Lie Clocks. Everyone on Earth has a Lie Clock. Every time you lie, the hands on your clock will move.'  'Oh,' said Rabri,  'Who's clock is that?'  That's Gautam Buddha's. The hands have never moved  indicating that he never told a lie. 'And whose clock is that?' That's Abraham Lincoln's clock. The hands have only moved twice, telling us that Abraham only told 2 lies in his entirelife.'  Rabri asked, 'Where's my Laloo's clock?'  Laloo's clock is in my office', replied yamraj, 'I'm using it as ceiling fan' !!! Just a joke- laugh and forget. I am not personally agianst Laloo and his herd of cattle.

        The budget is out and with it all the reviews and analysis. I am yet to get into the details and by the caution the market has shown by diving down on hearing about the tax proposal, I think this budget might have something peculiar. The Education cess is a good idea, but as is always said, the problem is not the lack of money but the efficient use of it. So, if Mr.Chidambaram can find some ways to use it efficiently, that would spell success to India

        Can this be the suitable title for this post? where had the railways gone to come back?. It has never gone anywhere. The only way it had been going is down and there is nothing to suggest that it would change in the near(far) future. By far the signals that are coming are proving the other way. The analysis done by the Rakesh Mohan COmmittee was good and I think they have zeroed on the exact cause for the sorry state of Indian Railways. It confuses the twn identity it has and has not been able to come out of this state. The subsequent ministers who were there treated Railways as their feifdom and that tradition of ours is still continuing. Hope that will end soon.

        We have always known that the Governer's post in any state is more of a political post than a government post. The manner in which the four governers have been shown the door smacks of any decency that this government can claim to have. The major votaries of democracy and probity in polity (Communists n who else) is still not out of their long slumber.They would not mutter a word coz it was "De-Saffornising". I also dont understand the logic behind assuming the colour of safforn with fundamentalism.The colour of safforn is in the Indian Flag and the manner in which that has been humiliated by these self proclaimed saviours of nation has only added to my alienation from them. Iam witness to the numerous "Ramzon fast" session of various hues of politicians but is yet to come across a single politicians(Other than Ofcourse BJP n its more idealogically close allies) who had enough courage to sit in a "Vinayaghar Shathurthi" festival. These  urlLink "I-Wear-My-Secularism-In-Sleeves"  type of politicians make me sick.

        Left has shown their true colour. Just when the Govt is settling down to real business, they are rearing their ugly head. Seetharam Yechuri has just now  urlLink said &nbsp;this. THinking of this i can only sympathise with the UPA governement. They dont really need any opposition parties. Their partners in power itself will do it. Though I dont like early elections just because they are just a drain of exchequer, I feel that will happen soon.

What is the surprise in a foreign Govt enquring about a comedy strip that has come to don the railway minister post in the name of democracy. I strongly beleive, the politics as practised by Laloo is a bunch of Mabocracy. sigh...... n there is a newspaper, which publishes this as a great event and takes pride. Where are we still?. In 18th centuary?

        I too suspect this might be a conspiracy or a sort of showing who's THE BOSS attitude from the FM. After the show of the markets and coming as it is the first budget of Manmohan Singh as PM, this proposal to tax the transactions will have an adverse impact on the Stock brokers. The margins for these short term transactions are wafer thin and the .15% tax on it would wipe out even that. Though there are some who dismiss this theory, there is no solid proof of this theory being completely wrong. The mere fact that there are leaders in the ruling coalition who wished markets to hell would not make this thoery redundant.

        This is unfortunate. But why cant India do a Entebe? Are we not capable of doing it or we lack the guts to do so.When our people are in trouble, it is our duty to do what ever it takes. We have to do this if need arises. Already we cowed down once and had the ignonimity of a foreign minister escorting the militants to safety at Kandahar. We dont want something of that sort happening. Why Dont the govts in power evolve a policy to act upon such contingency. Its high time we got one. Now we just pray the almighty to settle matters and think time heals all wounds. But NO time doesnt heal all wounds especillay that of Self-Esteem

        The Hindu's urgency in giving this governement a sense of ligitimacy is striking. Hindu never looses an oppurtunity to equate all Congress Governement to that of Nehru's. I am not surprised. Given the current political situation in the country, Left and Left of newspapers face this uncomfortable situation. Though they doesnt want to support the Congress Government on issues like FDI and others, they find it inevitable in other issues. So, they try opposing the Govt over the issues selectively and start glorifying even trivial issues like writting letters. Even with a single letter, Hindu has pronounced judgement that PM is following Nehru. The desperation to give credibilty to its opposition to the Govt and to its own credibility and so called" Neutrality", they would continue doing this. But said what may be, all my knowledge(even substanially small n trivial) about politics in this country, I owe it to "The Hindu".

        This sort of view had not been articulated in th e Indian Press till now. It is good that atleast there&nbsp;is someone to look into the matter in this prespective too. This has long intrigued me. The avowed objective of Tigers is to have a Aganda Tamizhagam- including the present Tamilnadu and parts of Srilanka. This will never be possible without riping apart both India and Srilanka- which is completely unacceptable to me. Though I speak Tamil Iam an Indian First and then comes What ever. I dont also understand the behaviour of Tigers- They know for sure they will never be able to get their demand met, yet they keep killing themselves and others. It took India the Life of a Young Leader with lots of Potential to understand that Tigers are&nbsp;Never to be trusted and only after this, there had been some improvement. Though even now, there are certain select few who still prefer supporting LTTE, there is no popular support for the Movement. People have understood their back stabbing and I dont think will forget that Incidence ever.

        Expected!!!!. This is a necessity for the Communist party, if at all they want to keep their base intact. They have grown through confrontation and their identity is confrontation, armed or otherwise. The Congress had to come to terms with this cocky attitude of ommunists- else, the Govt might not last for it's term. They still live in the Ivory Towers and they also dream of bringing IT&ITES Industry under Trade-Unions. I am afraid if their confrontaionist approach will spoil the IT&ITES Sector also. When the seat of Communism- West Bengal itself has told that IT&amp;ITES sector is out of Strikes, I dont know why they need to take up these issues and reduce the attractiveness? The HR dept of all these Firms themselves deal with these issues quite effectively and the workers there arent "Proletariat" for the Trade Unions to intervene.

       urlLink Henin-Hardenne -Shock  Atleast I never expected this. I hoped she would reach the finals if not win the grand slam.But the way in which she was packed off is another sort of Indian Elections'04. Shocked in a single Word. also, americans have been wiped out from the race. Never had Americans been wiped out of French Open this soon. But this nationality connection doesnt inspire me much. Its OK in sports.  However the  urlLink Spirit of Navratilova  would always continue to inspire me.

      The recent  urlLink changes proposed  in the rules of the Hockey that there can be no blocking when there is a shoot by the opponent. Till nou when a penalty shoot is taken, the defenders used to run from the Goal-Post towards the Shooter and block the shot. but now it cannot be done, and the goal post will be virtually empty. though it gives oppurtunity, i read in an article that it would put India in a disadvantage. I didnt understand his logic. still iam unable to understand.

       urlLink Krishnan's comments unfair: Bhupathi  The story in  urlLink The Hindu  is completely different from the story in  urlLink TOI . Really speaking I dont think Ramanathan's comments were bad. He simply put forth the plain truth- that the due is not in very good terms and they have joined together just for this Big Game. Is it possible for two who are at loggerheads for what ever reason u give to play and win a game in which coordination and understanding had to be maximum?. may be they will do it. i eagerly hope they do it in  urlLink Olympics . The story in TOI went to say what Boopati told Verbatim - that was like a bit more splashy and more dramatic than  urlLink The Hindu  which was more conservative and put that in a more Parliamentary way. This just goes to confirm my feeling that  urlLink TOI  is a Tabloid.

      As such iam not a great sporting guy but i love playing n watching football. in a cricket crazy nation, iam a bit  out of focus , as they call, but i was a player in my school football team and that emotional bondage still remains with me after all these years. i took up hockey for some time but i was unable to cope with the hits i got in the legs with the sticks, so i decided against it and settled for football- a relatively safe game- provided u dont go and bang with the opposition defenders. i played as a center right forward and changed position to  extreme right forward( incidentally my political leaning also), but had always been there till nou. i play for my section in the college also, but lack of practice has taken its toll and iam not that efficient in running or shooting it to the post. I plan to keep track of sporting events- what with olympics approaching fast.

      The  urlLink fall of France was a shock ultimate. I never expected this and so didnt even watch the match. The rules of chennai made sure that i dont watch the matches while I am in Chennai and the schedule here in the college make it even more harder to get a glimpse of it. I wonder what had happened to the famed French strength. As I havent seen the game I am unable to give any opinion but sure this is a rude shock.What happened to Zidane. To go down without a goal is a shame. I dont think this will ever be erased from the french Memory.

      Greece Wins!. I get 100 bucks. This was a bet with one of my friends. Today morning when we were in the summit meeting about the "Loga-Ishaemam", we got into a dual as to who will win the match today. Invariably the match was loaded( Atleast I thought so) in favour of Portugal. So, I bet him that Greece would win (True to the name of the blog). Out of over-confidence, he bet me a 200/100 deal for Greece win and a 100 win on portugal win. Nou, Midnight masala-100 Bucks. Viola!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Greece has got one goal at the 57th Minute. Portugal's fate has been sealed by Charisteas.  The striker beats his marker, Costinha, and the Portuguese goalkeeper to the ball to power his header home from the corner. - the description of the goal. Ronaldo and Ricardo fail to deliver. Unable to see the match because of preparation for presentatoin but when the net is near nothing is far. Will try to catch the finishing glimpses of the match!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
