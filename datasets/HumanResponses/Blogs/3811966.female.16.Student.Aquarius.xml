       Yeah !  Kay  replied my email, and she remembers the kids from the dance. Although she's not sure which one I am. But she still  remembers !! Yeah!!   So happy  .  She's agreed to help me ! She asked about my dancing too.   I'm really very happy  . (",)  Tomorrow's  Brenda 's birthday, and we've set up a  surprise  for her. We're going to  pretend  to forget that it's her birthday, and then surprise her after school. Hope that she'll like it.  Ms Lem 's going to help us keep the stuff first. (",)  Hmm.. I think that's all for today. Can't think of anything else to write down anymore. Perhaps I'm too happy. Oh yeah! Portugal lost to Greece in the Euros 2004. Boo!! Too bad. The score was 0-1. They just weren't on form yesterday night.  -"Love someone with all your heart"  *Listening to   [Candle in the Wind]   by  Sir Elton John     urlLink

      Hmm.. Feel rather ok today. Smsed my teacher  Ms Lem  today, she made me see things in a different way. Sort of " kai jie " me. She's going to help me in my studies, so all the more I  must  work  extra hard  now, so that I wouldn't let her down.  She really has encouraged me alot.  In a way, she's sort of like my ex-teacher  Ms Tan , who also encouragedme to study hard.  Both of them are my favourite teacher .  I have decided to email Kay today. Hope that I will get a reply from her. Monday would be  Youth Day , so there wouldn't be school. Celebrated in school. Had a '  PHS    Idol '. Was really very funny.  Mr Lai ,  Mrs Lau  and  Mrs Wong  were the judges. Contestants were  Mr Ng ,  Mr Sim ,  Mr Ang ,  Ms Teo ,  Ms Sibira ,  Mrs Ang ,  Mr Teo ,  Mr Wee ,  Mr Lau  and our principal  Mrs Tan . We had lots of laughter hearing the teachers sing. The judges were equally funny too. We had a ball of a time. Some of the teachers (Ms Sibiria, Mr Wee, Mr Lau, Mr Ng, Ms Teo) sang quite well, and so did Mrs Tan.  Really enjoyed the concert .  Well, think I'll end of here for today. Going to send the email to Kay.  -  "To get the full value of joy, you must have someone to divide it with."   Mark Twain   *Listening to   [This I Promis You]   by   N'Sync

       Hmm... I've set up some blogs before, but they were always not successful. Now, I've set my mind to complete this blog for  as long as possible .  Went to school for only about 2 hours today, as I'm still having my mid-yrs, due to the opening ceremony. Think I'll most probably fail my Physics, so as usual will fail science too.  Since school reopened, I've been home very early everyday, mostly before 11am, due to the exams. But even after that, I've decided to come straight home everyday after school. I've given myself a time-table, and hope that I'll follow it. It'll begin next week, when my exams end.  When I come home these few days, I'm all alone, except for my Dad who's sleeping in the room. There's no one for me to talk to. Hence, I feel scared and frightened and lonely. The feeling of emptiness comes, and I feel that there is a part of me that is missing. And I think I know why. I miss  DANCING  ( Ballet  to be exact). I miss the weekly lessons, and the 2 times that I performed with Frontier Danceland. I miss the " big sisters " and " little sisters " whom I performed together with. I can still remember their names and faces, but I doubt that they still remember me. I've kept all the stuff related to the performance, including the schedules. I found the pictures that my mum took during rehearsals and the actual dance too. After seeing them dance on TV the other day, the feeling has grown even stronger. I really miss them. I found Frontier Danceland's website a few days ago, and also saw Kay's website. I really admire her since then, but I've never told her. I dream of e-mailing her, and telling her that she's my idol and all. But i don't think she'll even remember me in the first place. I've sent an email to Frontier Danceland, hoping that I can contact my teacher, Ms Loke, but I've yet to receive any reply. I'll wait a few more days, before I pluck up the courage to email Kay to ask her instead.  I really   hope   that I'll be able to go back to dancing again. It's already been  1.5  years since I stopped ballet due to academic results. I can only go back to classes at the end of this year, after I take my O'levels. I hope I still will be qualified to dance, and that I wouldn't be rusty. Hence, I've started doing stretches and some steps before I sleep every night.  I was thinking, if I didn't choose to go to ECH in poly after I graduate, (which is my other love and dream), would I be able to take dance as a course? Can I go towards the ARTS direction? I could combine  my 2 greatest love ,  Ballet  and  kids , together, and that could be my career in future. I could teach Ballet. I don't know.  Right now, all I want is to go back to classes .  Oh well, think I'll end here for today. Bye!
