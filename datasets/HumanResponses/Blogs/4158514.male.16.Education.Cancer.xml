      My life is so screwed up right now. My emotions are play with me too lol.  Ok i hate school until it really gets goin, and so im not gonna be in a good mood about it, But thats too be expected. Band has been taking away so much outta me, my ankle is like in constant pain, but i gotta suck it up lol.  And heres the Big part. IM like all confused about these 2 people that i feel like i cant live without. And natalie knows why, and she cant even help me lol. But Its sooo funny cause ive never felt this way and it messes with my brain, cause i try to think of what to do, but i always end up doing the wrong thing when i run it through my mind. I really need some help. And the best advice ive gotten is tell them both how you feel, and go with the one that doesnt laugh in your face. neway Ive gotta go read some stuff for English LAta.

      Lol neway lol im just gettin new clothes and shoes today thats about it then relaxing. lol neway i found this really cool song on the Princess Diaries 2 soundtrack, i know what your thinking "Your gay guys dont listen to the princess diaries." lol but this is A uber song.  "Breakaway."-Kelly Clarkson.  Grew up in a small townAnd when the rain would fall downI just stared out my windowDreaming of a could-beAnd if I'd end up happyI would pray (I would pray) Trying not to reach outBut when I'd try to speak outFelt like no one could hear meWanted to belong hereBut something felt so wrong hereSo I pray (I would pray)I could breakaway [Chorus:]I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to flyI'll do what it takes til' I touch the skyI'll make a wish Take a chance Make a changeAnd breakawayOut of the darkness and into the sunBut I won't forget all the ones that I lovedI'll take a riskTake a chance Make a changeAnd breakaway Wanna feel the warm breezeSleep under a palm treeFeel the rush of the oceanGet onboard a fast trainTravel on a jet plane, far away (I will)And breakaway [Chorus:]I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to flyI'll do what it takes til' I touch the skyI'll make a wish Take a chance Make a changeAnd breakawayOut of the darkness and into the sunBut I won't forget all the ones that I lovedI'll take a riskTake a chance Make a changeAnd breakaway Buildings with a hundred floorsSwinging around wild indoorsMaybe I don't know where they'll take me butGotta keep moving on, moving onFly away, breakaway I'll spread my wingsAnd I'll learn how to flyThough it's not easy to tell you goodbyeI gotta take a riskTake chanceMake a changeAnd breakawayOut of the darkness and into the sunBut I won't forget the place I come fromI gotta take a riskTake a chance Make a changeAnd breakaway, breakaway, breakaway   Didnt feel like fixing it so it could be read easier, So you'll have to strive. lol neway lata.

       Im in a yellow mood today lol. neway I wrote a new song. Wanna read? wel im gonna make you cause im puttin it on here ne way so NEH to you....It now has A TITLE Lol i thought of a good one.      "The Cruelest mistake."     You gotta suck it up And deal with the pain. You gotta suck it up Cause you'll never see her again. And you gotta face the facts, You pushed her away.  Its been a lil' while since that night When it all went down. Since you made the biggest mistake of your life, You cant turn back time You Gotta move on.  Its like you think about her every night And what you might have lost, Cause you knew it was a bad mistake Right when you made that call.  You gotta suck it up And deal with the pain. You gotta suck it up Cause you'll never see her again. And you gotta face the facts, You pushed her away But now you want her to stay.  You told her you loved her But did you even mean it. It came from the heart, And its Kinda what you felt. But you put it all on words, Never showing how you truely felt And now shes gone and shes never coming back again.  You gotta suck it up And deal with the pain. You gotta suck it up Cause you'll never see her again. And you gotta face the facts, You pushed her away.  You just gotta Face it. Its all you can do, Their aint nothing in life To make her come back to you.  You gotta suck it up And deal with the pain. You gotta suck it up Cause you'll never see her again. And you gotta face the facts, You pushed her away.  And now its all over,  You told her good bye. But you know its a mistake When all you do is cry.   Neway thats the new song i wrote, Comment on it and tell me how much it sucked, and im gonna start Writing Happier songs lol instead of depressing ones.      Neway i have pics, and practice tomorrow so i need my sleep. NITE ALL MY FRIENDS, and some random strangers. lol
