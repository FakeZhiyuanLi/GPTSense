      Non-romantic physical closeness with friends is a very good thing.   Romance should not be reserved for lovers.

      I am unable to express my emotion in a way understandable to others.  I can see myself repeling what seems to me is all life but am unbale to stop myself.  For the past week or so I have been having emotional breakdowns over the smallest things.  I think that I am usualy a relativly easy going person which makes it kind of scare me.  I have had one of the worst summers this year and I think that is why I have been feeling so lousy.   I want to move to France or Italy and become fluent in their languages and customs.  I want to travel around europe with nothing but a backpack, a camera and a classic book that I will read over and over again until I know it by heart.  I want to be with someone that wont disregard me if somthing better comes along.  I want to be with someone that will share their passion with me.  I wonder if I have already met that person but am unable to be with them for an unknown reason.  I have yet to experiance true passion.  I believe that it is impossible to truly know what passion is until you have experianced it.  I also believe that the majority of people will never experiance it.   That is tragic to me.

      I feel like shit today.  My friend got mad at me for smoking today.  This was just after he'd been smoking weed.    I seem to be liking who my some of my oldest friends become less and less as time goes on.  Or maybe it's myself that i'm begining to hate.

      I'm going to west palm for the weekend to chill with some people I graduated with.  It should kick ass! And the guys will all be back when I get home(even though their camp is right down the road from where I'm going I'm not sure if I'll get to see them or not) Nicks already back but I haven't seen him so it doesn't really feel like it.  there's not much else to say except...   Tyler Durden for President!

        You have an entrancing kiss~ the kind that leaves your partner bedazzled and maybe even feeling he/she is dreaming.  Quite effective; the kiss that never lessens and always blows your partner away like the first time.    urlLink   What kind of kiss are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      I wrote this two years ago.  Thanks David for giving me the idea to find it again.   I'm shutting you out  like a dying dream  I'm hiding away  not wanting to be seen  I'm looking throgh  the smile on your face  I'm wandering around  a forbidden place  I'm crying tears  from deep inside  I'm running away  looking for a place to hide

      Today I saw the most fucking romantic movie ever...and it wasn't a chick flick.  Now thats true passion.  Every french film I see,  nomatter how much I don't like it has been extreemly passionate.  Americans at large are missing somthing. After the movie we went over to O-zone(a small music store with used vinyl)...it was closed but Robby (who works in the tattoo place nextdoor) and emily made a deal for him to do her tattoo when she turns 18.  He did't have a cigarette and the guy at the gas station carded me but we found some guys that did so we just chilled out for a while.  I bought the book 1984 by George Orwell today.  I've already read it but it's just one of those books you get more out of everytime you read it.  I hate it when people think its all conformist (or whatever word you wanna use) when a persons favorite books are the classics.  Theres a reason they're classics: Because they're damn good books.
