      The city I work in, which feels and seems much more like a town, has a courthouse square downtown.  There is a big courthouse surrounded by a fair bit of grassy area with lots of trees, a beautiful little spot really.  It really adds to the whole town feeling.  All sorts of things happen in the town square: art festivals, performing art festivals, food & drink tasting, local merchant festival, and many more.    Well, one thing I've noticed since I started working downtown is that people (men mainly) like to take a mid-day nap in this courthouse square.  I lived outside of new Orleans before I moved here, so at first I thought these nappers were homeless people, untill I paid a little more attention to them.  The majority of these napping people are wearing clean, well kept clothes, and are clean-shaven.  In other words, they are just people who live/work around downtown who like a little afternoon nap.  They pick a tree, lay down, and just doze off for a little while.  I find that kind of interesting.

      I’d like to share a quote I particularly like:   	“We find comfort among those who agree with us - growth among those who don’t.” 									- Frank A. Clark  How are we ever suppose to grow and learn if we are constantly surrounded by people who agree with us?  When you sit and discuss a topic with someone else who has an opposing view you will learn more from that one person than if you sat and discussed that same topic with 10 other people who believe what you do.  Although, I have found some very interesting conversations start up between people with the same views who are just pondering other possibilities.  I have a friend who is interested in the building sciences like I am, the two of us can get together and just bounce back ideas about what if this were to happen or if this one thing changed wouldn’t that make a huge difference to the houses and buildings going up right now?  It’s really cool to have someone on the same wavelength as you.  But, as far as growth goes, I feel I learn more by talking to someone about a topic that we are opposed on rather than have the same feelings.  When I come across a good conversation like this I’ll try to remember to share it.
