      Sum1 told me about "Hope" recently.. I dunno how did our conversation get into dat.. but like he talks about hope.. he gave me this simple story of a movie called Shawsack Redemption. The simple message was - "When ur hope is gone - u'r gone 2.." I dunno why he said dis stuff to me.. maybe juz to share or maybe the comment of my nick.. Indeed dat time maybe my msn nick showed dat my hope to wait 4 him nearly gone.. I dunno whether I should remain to wait patiently or not.. I dunno.. I want the answer noww !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I really can't wait any longer.. >_<>_  + vc +

Sumtimes I dunno y should I care 'bout my ex anyway.. and so, I dunno.. weird huh?!  School was pretty gud 2 day.. I had lots of fun.. except last nite my bro didn't cum home till like I went to schl in da morning.. I was so panic 'n I couldn't calm myself down in da morning.. till I called his mobile again (after trying thousands of time last nite) and  he finally picked up da phone 'n said dat he's sorry making us worried @ home.. cuz he slept in da train 'n got locked in da train maintanance building.. Piuhhh... after dat I'm glad.. 'n dun haf anything to worry about.. I couldn't go to sleep last nite till 'bout 5am.. wonder he's goin'.. but its ok now.. at least he's safe back home.. ^^  Sepanajng hari aku kepikiran ma Bebekk.. gw sayang bebek.. emang mungkin sumtimes I know dat I was being selfish 'n stuff.. but.. I was selfish cuz I luv him.. pa lagi soal maen game.. gw bener2 mo menang sendiri.. gw ga mau bebek maen game mlulu.. tp ga tauk ach.. yg dah berlalu biar berlalu.. tp.. hix.. gw cinta bebekkk !!!!!!

      Have u ever luv sumbody but u're not supposed to? Well.. I guess I'm in dat boat.. I still luv my ex.. but now he already got a new gf.. me 'n him juz frenz. I know dat he doesn't luv her anymore.. but he said dat he won't betray her.. He won't tell me whether he still luvs me or not.. I told him dis, "Say dat u dun luv me, then I'll neva bother u wif dis matter again.." but he won't say anything.. neither yes or no.. But I know.. deep down, he still luvs me.. I wonder whether I'm rite or wrong.. I dunno.. I haf no clue.. therefore I made my own conclusion.. Even if he still luvs me and I luv him 2, both of us can't do anything about it.. soo.. the only thing dat we can do rite now is juz to be frenz..  But for me.. it does really hurt to know dat hes going out wif another gal.. but the weird thing is.. I dun hate my ex.. but I hate her new gf.. I hate her !!! She knows dat I was going out wif him.. and she knows me too.. and so, y should she go out wif my ex? Is dat wat u called a fren!? Honestly.. I want to call her as a B**cH.. but like I'm not allowed to say it.. In my whole entire life I dun believe if der's any B**cH in dis world.. but I guess she's da first one dat I know.. the first one dat I can catogorized as dat creature.. but my ex dun like me to say dat about her.. and so, I dun say it.. not b'coz of her.. but b'coz if I do say it, it means dat my ex dun haf any dignity cuz he go out wif a B**cH...  It's weird u know... I supposed to hate my ex.. but I couldn't.. I dunno how long dis thing gonna go on.. He's far away from me.. I dunno what he's doing.. but I trust him.. 'n I do believe in him wif all of my heart.. If I only can b his frenz I dun regret it.. I dun think my ex know dis site.. and so, I dun think he knows wat I'm thinkin' bout dis.. I promised him not to talk about dis thing anymore wif him.. All dis long I've been waiting for him.. it's been like half a year or so.. but I guess I can't wait all the time.. besides, when I told him dat I was waiting for him all dis long, he reply me bak asking, "Did I ask u to wait?" And ofcoz the answer is no..  I dunno.. I'm confused... sumtimes he's kind to me.. but sumtimes he seems soo mean to me.. it's juz weird.. I know dat all dis long I've been lying to myself saying dat I dun luv him anymore.. but wat can I say?! I really do believe in wat I said - dat is, I dun luv him anymore.. until the day when Jessie, one of my fren was like yelling at me.. telling me to stop lying to myself.. I wasn't aware dat what she said was so true dat time.. and so, I yelled at her bak.. we were like nearly having a big war afta schl dat time.. but den both of us were quiet till I said to her dat I'm sorry.. asking her to explain it to me again.. It took me pretty long time to realised dat wat she said is true..  Anyway, to cut the long story short, me 'n her be frenz again.. I told my ex dat I still luvs him.. he got freaked out 'n confused cuz all dis long I've been telling him dat I dun luv him.. and sooo.. yeah.. he said to me dat he dunno..  and the story goes on.. he can't say or do anything about it.. so, both of us.. knowing dat we luv each other haf to be quiet till the rite time cums by...  What should I do then? Even if I keep on covering myself by saying, I'm ok wif their relationship, is dat mean I'm lying to myself again? cuz honestly I dun.. I dun like her to be around my ex.. I dun like her.. I can't trust her.. she betrayed me..!! Juz becoz she's in da same city as my ex 'n I'm not, she can betrayed me like dat.. gosh..  The only answer dat I'm waiting for dis time is whether my ex really luvs me still or not.. dat's the only thing dat I want to know.. But I guess by the end of this year if I can't find the answer, I'll take it as he doesn't luv me anymore.. and he only considered me as his fren.. and afta dat time, I might go out wif sum1 else.. but who knows?! I'm not the kind of gal who can fall in luv easily..  buy let's juz see...  I luv my ex so much.. I can't keep him off my head.. he always in my mind and in my heart.. I luv him.. I miss him.. but once again.. I wonder whether he still loves me or not.. wonder whether we could get bak together or not.. If the worst cums to worst dat we can't be together again, I'll move on.. I'll look for sum1 dat luvs me in return..  Did I make the right choice?? I dunno.. let's juz see wat's ahead of me dis time..  Love, >> vcToRia
