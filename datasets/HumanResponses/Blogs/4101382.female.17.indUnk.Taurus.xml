      Well, I am not good at writing my thoughts out so here goes...  I was on my way home from my Dad's after dropping him off, after a long day of movies, and I couldn't help but watch the lightening streak across the sky.  I kept thinking of all that has happened in my life:  apendectamy, 2 knee surgeries, wisdom teeth removed, death of my grandpa when I was too little to remember, all the friends I have gone through, the new ones I have met along the way including my twin... Lacey!!..., it really made me realize that everything I have gone through doesn't really matter anymore.  The thing that really matters is what is happening right now as we speak.  The lightening to me kind've symbolize me putting all my memories away so I can live in the present and not in the past.  I need to grab life by the horns.  Live life to the fullest.  Do what I need to do. Although I am not sure what that is right now, but I am sure that when I get older that I will come to realize what that is.  However this post is getting quite long so I am going to end it.  I am also getting tired.  I am going to try to sleep tonight.. I watched Dreamcatcher tonight and I have a feeling that I won't sleep very well.  So until next time.  Ta Ta

      Well today was fun.  After not being able to sleep because I kept thinking about the good times Kari and I have had, I had to go to work, two hours early I might add.  I got to go to JCPenny's before to pick up an outfit, which didn't fit when I tried it on when I got home... GRRRR!  And I also got to get two new pairs of shoes.  Then I headed to work just to find out I had to work with MIKE SKINNER!!!!!!!!!!!!!  AWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I came so close to walking out today.  After not having had a good night or day I was put on express ignored by Mike and called Audrey about 20 times by Mike.  I was so mad, but to lighten the mood, Mitch and Ryan Phillips decided that they would drop about 30 bottles of apple juice from the display.  It was an accident that broke 14 bottles, soaked the floor, fill Ryan's shoes and make him smell like apple juice.  Then I had one of the creepy nightstockers hitting on me (that was scary but I laugh at his attempt, it was very good).  I ended up walking out on Mike with 10 mins left.  He wasn't happy when he saw me getting groceries at like 9:55, oh well.  If he pulls his normal shit tomorrow, I will leave at 9:00 and not stay to help.  He is such a jerk, he needs to be fired.  I actually think Jordan was a better manager then he is.  Oh well, enough of me venting, I am going to go to dream land now.  Until Next Time... Ta Ta

      Thanks to those who pulled me out of the house to do stuff to have somewhat of a good summer. Good bye to the friends I have lost, whether it be to college, fights, moves, or whatever the reason. Hello to the new friends I have made.  Tonight I had the privilege of saying goodbye to a life long friend, one that I later found out lied to me. Makes you feel great doesn't it. Then I also got to say good bye in a nother way, a fight perhaps, to a nother life long friend whom I hope to not see again for a while. I just hope they had a great summer. I just had a peachy one, besides the few times I was with Lacey, Jeffery, Geoff, Jacob, and friends from work, my summer sucked. I hope they are happy with themselves for what they did, I just want to know one thing, am I important enough for anyone's friendship? No one besides the few I listed above seems to be proving that. Hope this year goes fast, I can't wait to leave. I dont' even want to walk into the school on tuesday where I spent 3 years with those people. I don't want to remember. Well enough. I am done. Until Next Time... Ta Ta

      I was thinking the other day, hard to believe I know, but I was thinking about all the good times I have had in life.  Sneaking Kari out of her house when she was grounded, going to the concert with Kari and Lyndsey, all the wonderful football games in the cold, the football championship where we crushed Gregory 34-6 (or was it 34-7, I can't remember), mine and Kari's notes in math and study hall.  Everything that I will miss greatly.  I am going to miss Kari and Paul and Lyndsey so much.  I will miss the First Priority Group from last year (Andrew and Josh and Ben).  I will miss everything.  But I was also thinking of everything that will happen.  All the great times that are next to come.  One of them is going to happen at 8:00 Wednesday night -->Beach Boys concert.  I am greatly awaiting the football games to come, homecoming, prom, graduation, everything.  So I am goign to charge full speed into my senior year hoping to have more wonderful memories for the future to look back on.    Until next time... Ta Ta

      I haven't posted in a couple days.  Not much has happened.  Went to work on Tuesday.  Nothing big happened there.  Except, Emily almost tripped over the flat bed trying to get away from the falling water.  Other then that nothing big.  I went shopping with my dad on Wednesday.  He bought me some jeans, cookies, and lunch.  He was feeling really generous.  He was going to get me a couple outfits for pictures but we didn't find anything.    Well right now, I am watching Blue Collar Comedy Tour (I got thrown out of a bar in New York City- that part is on right now) just waiting for Lacey to call.  If you are reading this call me!!  If anyone wants to come out just give me a call (743-2706)  Until Next Time... Ta Ta

      I set up my Senior Pictures Setting yesterday.  September 14!!!  I am so excited,it is in the after noon so I can go out in the garden at sunset.  I can't believe I am a senior.  I can still remember the first day of Kindergarden and First Grade.  I can't wait to be done with school though and to finally get out of Harrisburg.  I never thought I would be so happy when I realized that I only have one year left.  From what I have heard, it isn't going to be easy.  I am goign to miss last year's senior class a lot.  Most of my friends were in that class.  But oh well, we are now the big dogs in the school, and then the next year, we will be at the bottom of the food chain.  I still remember freshmen year, in the old school, at lunch time.  Lunch was the worst, getting 5 to 10 mins to eat after everyone else cut in front of you.  Mr. Marshall, my science teacher, well kinda, was only there for like 3 months, then having sub after sub after sub, then finally Mrs. Tschute for a week, and then another sub.  I don't think I really learned anything out of that class, except the fact that Pre-Algebra students waste tax payers money (Mr. Christensen--stupid sub that got fired.).  My freshmen year was probably the most fun, then it would be last year.  I had so much fun.  I don't know why either, as much as I got pushed around and bullied, it was still fun.    Well this post is getting long. Until next time.. Ta Ta

      Well for those who don't know the story of the seperated twins that found each other at HyVee... Here it is.... A long long time ago, about 17.5 years ago, there was this lady that was giving birth... she was supposed to give birth to siamese twins.  She started on November 8th, and she had the first one, but there were complications so they had to detatch the first born from the other, supposedly the second baby wasn't fully developed.  So about May the she went into labor with the second child.  Because of complications during the labor the mother had to have a sesarian section (sea section for those who don't know) and didn't make it through the birth of her second siamese twin.  So the doctors and hospital staff thought it would be a generous thing to give the twins to families who had still births.  The first named Lacey was giving to Mr. and Mrs. Dubbe and the second named Bethany was giving to Mr. and Mrs. Bawdon.  Seventeen years later the twins found each other at HyVee were they both worked.  They both had scars on there hands so they figured that they were connected at the hand.   The End.

      For those of you who don't know what movie my title came from, I have one thing to say to you... Get with it!!   The reason for the title was because at work today (wow a hole 8 hours) I had to check beer and after I made the list, I was back looking for it in the back room and well there wasn't much there.  I was working on it for about 3 hours (yes that is a long time... no thanks to Aaron...grrrrr.)and finally about 1.5 hours in to it, Lacey came back to help me (thanks lacey) and she was helping me finish the displays.  We got to the Coors display and there wasn't any.. so Lacey asks "Why is all the Rum gone?"  That really brightened my day... I don't know why but it did.    I found out today when I got off work that Jacob can't go with me to the Beach Boys concert.  However Geoff said that he might go with me if he can get out of what he is doing.  Pauly, if you don't have to work you can go with me  :P.. j/k, you wouldn't have fun.  Plus you will probably blow all your money at the Trapped concert (I am still mad at you for that, I want to go but can't).   Until Next time... Ta Ta
