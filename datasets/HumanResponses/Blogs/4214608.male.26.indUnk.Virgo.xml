      I realized after reading that last posting that it was starting to sound like a Penthouse Forum, or even worse, a posting on okayplayer.com's GD (yeah, I'm there too, just not on the regular) And it got me to thinking-is pornography the only universal use for the internet? And how many dudes troll the internet with the expectation that it will get them some ass? I admit that I have hooked up with a few girls I met on the internet, but those were thru dating sites, not via chatrooms. It just seems to me that the internet has turned into a gigantic sex clearinghouse, where you can get all that you were looking for but were afraid to ask about (kinda like that skit from Chapelle Show where he dreams that the internet is like a shopping mall-"I'm Spamblocker Bitch!")

      I tried to log into this last week to make a post, but I wasn't able to for some reason..anyways, for some reason women are on my mind right now..ok, I'm a heterosexual male, so women are on my mind 75 percent of the time (along with, in various percentages-pizza, beer, God, law school, TiVo, convincing myself that John Kerry a) looks presidential b) will beat the village idiot November 2nd, convincing myself that the Bills will win 10 games this year, because Drew Bledsoe will not have a shitty year, my cell phone bill, why Allen Iverson is so hated despite the fact I think he's my favorite basketball player ever (what are we talking about, practice?), how mucd debt I'm in, why this doesn't bother me more, should I wait to buy Madden '05, or wait until I'm finished with my season in MVP Baseball, how Jim Rome and I have been cool for 6 years, and I have yet to call the show (emailed about a dozen times, never read on air), how I need a new job, but I haven't actually started looking for one, why I haven't done any work since last Thursday, and why am I complaining, etc. etc. etc.  So as I was saying, women are on my mind. There are few things on earth better than a woman woman with a tight t-shirt/sweater, tight jeans, painted nails and sweet smelling perfume. The kind of girl that walks by and takes your breath away, the kind of girl who upon seeing her you start to daydream about her in a thong, and using your tounge on each and every inch of her body..ok, I'm at work now so I'm going to stop before I get myself in trouble..I need to talk politics or something to keep this from becoming some kind of porn infested website..of course, this is the internet, where it would be fitting

      I'm sure that if you somehow managed to come across this website you may think to yourself "Scary Black Guy, huh? Why would I want to read this?" Well, the title is a tribute to that great American Patriot Michael Moore (yeah, I said it..whatchu wanna do?!) In his film "Bowling For Columbine", he talks about the culture of fear, and how the scariest thing around is the "Scary Black Man." So as you've probably guessed, I am a black man, and probably a little scary (seeing as how I'm 6'3", 235..and single, ladies..lol) On more than one occasion I've gotten the "Please Mr. Black Man Don't hurt/rape/rob me" look, and it's not like it was warranted on any occasion..ok, that's probably not true, but the bottom line is that I'm far from the scary black man..I'm not a thug, drug dealer, or overall bad guy..I call moms every day, I even wear glasses. So, should you pass through this corner often, what will I be talking about? Here are a few things:  1. I hate Republicans..period 2. I love Direct TV..espically NFL Sunday Ticket, which is the best thing ever 3. I love my friends, even if they're all mental patients (not literally..at least not yet anyways) 4. My job is kinda boring right now (thus I have started blogging, to fill the hours of my day between 9am-5pm) 5. There is nothing better on the planet earth than a woman with "hips, lips and fingertips" who smells like a woman should, and has her hair did... 6.My city, Buffalo, New York,  frustrates the hell out of me, because it is a place that has so much promise, but at the same time, has so many problems. If we could only manage to get our heads out of our collective asses..but I digress 7. I used to love HER..if you know what that's about then we gon be alright..  I've decided that I will finish this now, but I may be back later in the day..Dick Cheney has me inspired to expound on why I hate Republicans
