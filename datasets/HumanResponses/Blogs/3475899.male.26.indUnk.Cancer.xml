         I'm kind of nervous. I've never told anyone this before. It's something that if I do tell it, people will know that I am, in fact, not cool. That I could give a shit about Mom and/or Pop. That despite my intellectual and moral commitments--often expressed, and loudly, in any number of social contexts--to the contrary, my interest in the maintenance of a real, authentic urban landscape--not to mention in staunching the proliferation of jobs that require the wearing of cheesy green aprons or the lexicological institutionalization of an irritating, pretentious, utterly arbitrary, and probably fictional "Italian" system of liquid measurement--is, at best, skin-deep. But I'm going to do it. I'm going to say it.  My name is Bobo and I drink Starbucks. Often and alot.  I won't bore you with the details of how it all started-- except to mention that it's been going on for longer than I care to admit --and I will most certainly spare you the excuses-- like how I got addicted to really strong coffee and could find no other locations near my workplace to purchase it that wouldn't involve trusting a deli cashier to understand that a "little, little bit" of milk doesn't mean a pint . I will only say that the subject has always been a curiously resillient, if minor, source of shame in my life.  We are all compromised consumers in one way or another, right? What's the big? Even the crunchiest, Birkenstock-wearing, armpit-hair braiding, deodorant-abhorring G.O.R.P.-eater has to settle for an evil corporation for some of their daily essentials. (I hear Tom's of Vermont has hideous, union-busting labor practices. Plus that shit cleans your teeth about as good as...well,  shit .)  But see I am not only a Starbuck's consumer. At the Starbucks on the corner of 102nd and Broadway--you know, the one just down the street from the Starbucks on 101st--I have become a  regular .  The barrista knows me by name. In fact, all three barristas know me by name. The cashiers, too. They know what I do for a living and what kind of music I like. And Beth, dear, sweet, ridiculously charming and engaging Beth, knew me well enough to tease me the day after John Kerry began sweeping the Democratic primaries. (I supported, at various times, all the other candidates).  When I enter the Starbucks in question every morning, I am invariably spotted as soon as I cross the threshold and my order--my very own "the usual"--is shouted out from register to bar before I've even reached the counter. They all know what I want. They know what I like.   A Venti Americano, one extra shot. The only variable, the only thing they need bother asking me is: "Iced or Hot?"  "Feels like an Iced day to me, Beth." (I actually said this, or something to that effect.)  "Sure thing. Hey, Bobo," she asks, leaning forward in a mock whisper. "Howabout an extra shot on the house?"   I begin to blush. "Beth, what are you doing to me?" We smile. What the hell. Yes. Definitely."  "Here you go, Bobo. You look kind of tired today."  "I haven't had my"--I raise the Venti cup she's just handed me--"yet." I take a big, demonstrative swig. And I smile.  Is there a bigger shithead alive?  The worst part is that Beth is cool. I like her. Hey, she's a Democrat and she manages to keep relatively cheery while serving and indulging assholes like me all day, the kind of jerks who are too rich and/or lazy to go elsewhere to buy their lunch and will settle for a crappy pre-made sandwich that costs like six bucks all because the cheese in it is called "Brie." But the limits on our interactions are apparent. Our repartee, though typically livelier than the odious sample I've just selected, is somewhat forced. Because every time we talk, we are talking  in a Starbucks , and every time she does me a truly nifty favor like giving me an extra shot for free she is performing that act  in a Starbucks .   And though I will concede that this could be nothing more than the product of an overeducated, elitist imagination, I can't help resenting that this atmosphere has become such a regular part of my life. I do this almost every day. I go to Starbucks, get my coffee, chat for a moment, then walk to the office with my steaming double-stacked and recycled-paper besleeved cup, advertising the whole way there a central way in which I've managed to fall short of my adolescent ideals. I suppose the fact of where I'm going--to work--is another sign of the same.   The saddest and most stinging part of it all, the icing on the cake, the proof that I really have changed--oh, and so much for the worse--is that I kind of don't care. I care less every day. And if a Starbucks were to pop up in my until now chain-free neighborhood, I would most likely bitch for a few weeks and then, after a second's hand-wringing, go get myself a nice, hot--or iced!--Venti Americano.

         Is there anything duller or more narcissistic than bothering to sit down and write out the things that bug or bother you; to list your peeves and your grievances; to, instead of shrugging off that vague insult or overstressed demand at work, the unforgivably depressing atmosphere in the place you get your coffee, the annoying thing your girlfriend or boyfriend did last night in bed; to actually bother to catalogue all of the slights and disappointments, all of the many new and delightful ways that life has discovered, despite all reasonable expectations, to keep getting suckier and suckier?  Sure there is! You can post them on the internet! You can pretend, even if just for a second, even if the only person you succeed in fooling is you, that others might actually enjoy hearing about it.   So that's what I'm embarking on here: It is my mission to create the dankest, dingiest, dourest, whiningest and whingeiest space currently on the Web. Brace yourself for heaping daily doses of adolescent self-pity, solipsistic smugness, and self-indulgent self-hatred! Topped, of course, with the trademark heavy-handed, tone-deaf, humorless bile you will no doubt come to expect from yours truly.  And if, by chance, someone actually manages to stumble across this meager little hut I call a home...that's fine, that's good...but don't come back! Repeat visitors will not be tolerated. I want an absolute minimum of "unique visitors," "page views", "hits" or whatever-else-the-fuck. Remember: I will settle for nothing less than abject failure.

        If you're looking for further proof that Hollywood is irredeemably fucked, just step on over to Bridget Fonda's page on the IMDB and take a peek at the top half of her  urlLink filmography .  Yeah, yeah, maybe her agent's a total rebo, maybe she's made some bad choices-- the obligatory thankless gf in  "Monkeybone,"  anyone? --maybe she's lost her skills...  But wait, that latter possibility is utterly im-. We are talking here about the Bridget Fonda of Singles, Single White Female, Scandal, Point of No Return, even such otherwise pathetic comic duds as It Could Happen to You and Doc Hollywood! We are talking about the actress from Jackie Brown who, whether getting high, smoking a cig, drinking a delicious vanilla protein shake, getting unsatisfyingly rear-ended by a stiff and sexually incompetent Robert DeNiro, or teasing an unstable man--"Lewis. Lew isss . Lew- hiss ."--to the point of femmicide, teased out that slender, delectable thread of self-satisfied, self-indulgent malice latent in all stoner chicks. We are talking about the best actress ever.   Look around at the actresses getting steady work these days: Charlize Theron, Angelina Jolie, Kate "Please Die Soon" Hudson, Jennifer "Radio Face" Aniston, Vanity Fair's latest quickly forgotten "discovery", like Gretchen Mol and all the other  whatshernames .  The only thing they have more of than Bridget is fat in their lips. Harlots and hussies, each and every last one of them.  And then look at  Bridget , languishing in TV movie, straight-to-DVD hell. But don't worry, Bridget--I'm coming for you. I'm coming to Hollywood soon, and I've got a plum role ready and waiting for you if you'll deign to accept it. Your HW stock will soar again, just you wait. You are my light. You are my inspiration.  Bobo

          'Has a' or 'is a'?  Back before gmail when friendster was all the rage, I remember I used to get these patently mass solicitations to come over and hang out with  urlLink Houston Bernard  at his lame-ass Yahoo newsgroup. It was a very bland and rote bit of self-promotional boilerplate, but he did have the courtesy to mention his generously portioned 9 inch dick in the text. (Cut or uncut, I can't recall, but I'm sure he mentioned it). I downloaded a few Houston tunes, looked at some Houston pics, contemplated buying a Houston hat or keychain. I decided against it, of course, because this guy is about as openly rebo as a person can possibly be without getting put in a home for the terminally rebo.   I thought at the time that he was the perfect specimen to prove my thesis that electro, which was already over at the time, represented the nadir of NYC's subcultural possibilities, with all its lame-o "downtown" posturing and potty-mouthed fronting. If you didn't mind wrapping your titties in saran wrap or your package in a dirty sock and getting onstage and lip-synching in-front of a small audience predisposed to thinking saran-wrapped titties and dirty-sock beclad baskets are the apex of cool, you could be briefly, marginally famous. Perfect for bored rich girls in NYC who wanted to be a)shocking, b)popular, c)famous, but who were too lazy to a) write songs, b) sing songs, c) do anything that hadn't already been done in the early 70s.  Sex in pop songs, like, obviously rools, but rhyming 'tittie' with 'clittie' and 'coochie' with 'hoochie' gets old pretty quick.  Of course, I'm totally over it and I've decided two years too late that electroclash is  where it's at!  Check out my new rhymes...I promise to get some audio streams up soon.   I'm gonna cum on your titties I'm gonna cum on your pretty, little, titties Now sit on my face let me lick that clittie Damn girl I said damn that cooch as fine as hooch.  Bobo hats and keychains coming soon.  Word.

         I'm back to what sucks. As we-- all ten of us --know, bands like Nickelback really suck. Suck in a deep, dark way that hurts our hearts.   It's not just like they're bad. Millions of people listen to them and love them. That's what makes the sucking hurt. That music this machine-tooled, mass-produced, and soul-dead gets consumed and loved while there is so much good music out there is...sad. That the record companies, MTV, and radio programmers continue to get away with this scam is...sad.   That this has always been happening in some form or another is  not  sad; it is a fundamental paradox at the heart of pop music's tug-of-war between art and commerce. If you can't enjoy the friction, listen to opera. But that the battle between the two, at least on the airwaves, is pretty much lost is...sad.  But who can summon the will or energy to try to put the shittiness of bands like Nickelback into words? I can't. I don't have the musical vocabulary, for one thing; for another, there are simply too many shitty bands to know where to begin.  That's why I'm so thankful for this amazing  urlLink audio stream . It says it all. Seriously, whoever did this should get airtime on MTV and all the major modern-rock Clear Channel affiliates, to demonstrate the findings of his experiment and to present these villains with an opportunity to apologize to the vulnerable and so ruthlessly exploited rock audience. I don't see how this is any less of a scandal than the Milli-Vanilli brouhaha fifteen or so years back. But standards and corporate accountability have slipped so far since then I doubt this marvelous expose will get the airtime it deserves.  (Thanks to the blog whose name/url I can't remember for linking to this in the first place).

         I get a lot of deranged letters from crackpots at work, most of which I promptly toss into the recycling bin. But, unethical as it is to post this poor, paranoid woman's rantings, it is simply too good to resist:  Dear editors,  My story isn't of paranoid-- sic --but of multiple attempts to poison me. My life has come under scrutiny by various government intelligent-- sic --agencies. That every step I make is known this constant surveillance has cross-- sic --the line of illegal activities. The surveillance and listening devices have been placed in the house I reside in and every move and word spoken is known. All personal electronic devices have been bugged also. To include my computer the CD drive just shut down. As I was talking with a customer service representative that had me to delete-- sic --a previously installed free online service. ( Um, sic ?) There after-- sic --the computer wouldn't recognize the CD drive. My recently purchased cell phone have-- sic --numerous problems that include not receiving telephone calls sometime. (Ok  sic  um  sic , I give up  sic .)  Having always been a consumer of water for years drinking up to 80 fluid ounces a day. After returning to any store more than once the water products are constantly coming up poison. To the extent adverse reactions are felt immediately. This has happen at every store I have returned too. Some of the water products are so blatant that the smell is foul. As the problem with the water is so pervasive that it is unsafe to drink any water products at any of these stores that I frequent.  The use of public bathrooms had become so severe that a constant infection would occur immediately that include a burning effect. Mostly from bathroom at hotels downtown their paper products, toilet tissue, paper towels, and hand tissues all were infected that caused a vaginal burning.  I have written Jeff Lampinski the Director of FBI Philadelphia informing him of these incidents. It is no surprise that no reply have been forth coming. I also have sent letters to Mr. William Mueller Director FBI Washington DC and Mr. Tom Ridge Director of Homeland Security.  Sincerely,  Lady X  These crackpots, in all their lunacy, always manage to come up with shards of lovely poeticism..."coming up poison" and "a vaginal burning" would both, I feel, make excellent titles for albums or collections of poetry. I would advise lady x, however, not to seek help for her u.t.i. or yeast infection from Mr. Tom Ridge. He makes a great Director of something-or-other but a pretty lousy gynecologist.

      It's not all bad news. There are still some great places to go on the web to get unbiased, useful information and insightful analysis. I go to this site at least once a day, and it hasn't let me down yet.

         Is anyone looking for further proof that Andrew Sullivan's self-love knows no bounds?   Me neither.  But still. Surely he could have ooo-ed and aww-ed over this sweet little missive and kept it to himself. But no: he has to show us how he touched the lives of these young go-getters by wrapping it up in the guise of showing us how  touched  he himself is that they would share how  touched  they've been by him, with us.   And now we're  touched .   EMAIL OF THE DAY II: After a couple years of trying, myself and a classmate succesfully ressurected our school newspaper...We became so attached to this paper that, for the final semester of high school, everything we did was in some way related to producing a thought-provoking weekly. As the paper expanded and became quite popular in our college town of 30,000, my co-editor/ressurector, Hannah and I shared deep intellectual discourse on local, state and national politics...The two of us taught each other alot but I am ecstatic over one thing that has come about from our friendship: we both read your blog. I turned her on to it and she now feels that there is at least one insightful conservative who is not a religious zealot. As a token of her appreciation Hannah's graduation gift to me was - yup you guessed it - a donation to Andrewsullivan.com in my name. My first year at college will be filled with updates and special features from the Daily Dish. I hope you'll run this letter so that people out there know that honest, intellectual and respectful discourse still exists even if it is only amongst a 17 and 18 year old. Running this letter is also a terrific plug for the importance of donating to the dish." And so it is. I haven't run a pledge drive this year because I'm unsure of how long I can keep this up, but you can help keep this blog alive by donating here. - 4:05:26 AM  (OK, I'm not  that  touched.)

      I love this  urlLink young woman . First of all because she is hot. Second of all because her awful complexion and sour demeanor come through with stunning digital clarity despite the photo's grainy, b+w low-resolution. Third of all because her name is Blandford.  I love her!

         I promise to stick it to the patriarchs and phallocrats of the world soon; I do know that Bush and his cronies pose a greater threat to the world than The Vagina Monologues' Eve Ensler and the--at least somewhat--worthy 'off our backs' crowd. But besides Ann Coulter, can you think of a single national pseudo-celebrity whose work is more deserving of death by bonfire than Eve Ensler's? The pied piper of Hollywood's amateur feminist set, the kind of person who writes a play composed of ten monologues about the humiliation, pain, violence, and degradation inherent in all heterosexual sex and thinks she is "empowering" women; an idiot with a ridiculous and unflatteringly witchy Louise Brooks/Little Lulu hairdo who spends a good chunk of her time onstage simulating really unappetizing and crazed-simian orgasms; someone dumb enough to start an organization whose mission it is to end "all violence against all women and girls," more or less for all time when what her charity actually accomplishes is making middle-aged lesbos more smug in their politics, middle-aged heterosexual liberal ladies more comfortable saying the word "vagina" but less comfortable actually using theirs, and making Eve Ensler herself ever richer and ever more famous, despite being a second-rate performance artist and having a fourth-rate mind.  They should make little rotund Eve Ensler wind-up dolls that squeak when you crank 'em: "Rape! Violence! Vagina! Rape! Violence! Vagina!" I know I'm just a boy but real feminists must silence this woman if feminism hopes to hold onto what shreds remain of its credibility. Because "V-Day" is about the worst appropriation of feminist rhetoric since the music industry started buying stock in "Girl Power."

      I don't claim this ridiculous piece of archaic, p.c. crap is really indicative of anything in particular. I don't think people like this pose any real threat to anyone but themselves. This little sample of overeducated, hypersensitive-feminist insularity is evidence of nothing but the...hypersensitivity and insularity of a small group of--probably very young--feminists.   But, really,  come the fuck on!    "Dear oob and Constance Reeder: I was pleased to see that you had an intelligent article about 'The L Word,' and I was even more pleased that I completely agree with your take on it. However, I was greatly disappointed with your use of the word "lame," along with many other "L" words to describe how horrible the show is. I was surprised to see "lame" being used in such a negative way, since I had read your past two issues devoted to Women with Disabilities and know that you understand why "lame" is so offensive and problematic when used."   Editors' note:  "You are absolutely right in everything you said. We should never have used the word--it was included by error. We were brainstorming negative words beginning with the letter L when it came up, but we immediately agreed that it was ableist and offensive and we thought it had been deleted. Unfortunately, it was missed in proof-reading. It was in no way the fault of responsibility of the author of the article.   "Please accept our heartfelt apology for this offensive and hurtful error, and thank you for taking the time to point it out. You are right that we should have known better and, in fact, we did know better, but we erred in such a way that we failed to live up to our own standards."  --the off our backs collective   What? Where's her free lifetime subscription to Off Our Backs? This collective is obviously far too easy on itself. It is a relief to know that they "immediately" agreed it was offensive, though; and that, "in fact," they did "know better." For Goddess' sake, what were they thinking?  This was taken from the letters section of the May-June issue of Off Our Backs.

        Ever since David Brooks landed his cushy op-ed position at the Times, he has consistently produced trashy, logical-fallacy loaded fodder for critics of the op-ed form. His June 1st column was really no better or worse than the rest, and for that reason makes as good a target as any. His topic was the recent National Journal-sponsored ranking of the Bush administration's economic policy record. The Bush team was graded on a very scientific 'A+' to "F" scale, and received a handful of low Bs and a C- (the latter for "long term fiscal policy").  Having set this up, Brooks commences with:   "I thought it might be interesting to see what the Bush people themselves thought of their marks, so I brought The National Journal into the White House and asked a few senior officials to respond.  "Their first answer, not surprisingly, is that you have to understand the reality that confronted them when they took office in 2001. Business leaders were calling in to say that economic activity was falling off a cliff. The dot-com bubble was over, manufacturing was getting a hit..."  Et cetera. Et cetera. Can you spot the inanities in these paragraphs? First off, he "thought it might be interesting"? So he just bumbled on over to the White House to get their word on it. Where's the harm. "Their first answer, not surprisingly, is that you have to understand..." Is he joking? That has to be one of the most devious and yet most poorly constructed sentences I've ever witnessed in a major publication. "You have to understand" is not an answer to a question; it is a prelude to an excuse and a transparent evasion of the question. Surely, being the good Bobo that he is, Brooks is well-educated enough to note that distinction? But rather than interpret the excuse/apology, Brooks allows this unnamed "senior official" to run on and on, effectively giving Bush's folks free airtime..on the op-ed page, the place where, you know, this stuff is supposed to be--whether positively or negatively--interpreted, analysed, explained.   But then, where would Brooks be without his bumbling, faux-naif style? It allows him to pose as a fuzzy, socially moderate political centrist while selling a fundamentally conservative vision of America to upscale liberals, who yuk it up over his nasty and politically motivated (mis)characterizations of them in his bestselling works of "comic sociology," oblivious to the harm in it because, as Brooks is so quick to point out, he is one of them too! He lives in a blue state! He spends a lot of money on clothes! He's a flaming careerist who's never mowed his own lawn and probably wouldn't know how to even if he wanted to! He's just like us Bobos! Aren't we Northeasterners and West-Coasters total frauds? Howsabout next election we abstain and let the real Americans in the flyover region decide who gets to rule the country! I mean, because they're all so real and authentic and they wouldn't spend more than twenty dollars on dinner if you put a gun to their head.   Not because Brooks is secretly an arch-conservative or anything, oh no.  For more evidence on Brooks (half-conscious? fully conscious?) duplicity and mendacity, simply compare his pre-Times Weekly Standard articles with his work for the Times and his books. You get a nice sliding scale from fuzzy moderate to economic arch-conservative, all conveniently tailored to each formats' target audience.

         Crikey! Is there anything worse than settling into a "nature" program featuring some terrific and exciting animals, only to discover that the animals in question are, at best, mere supporting players to the colorful antics and engineered mishaps of some obnoxious pseudo-naturalist host?   The sonorous, dignified intonations of David Attenborough used to get on my nerves, too, but now that I've suffered through the effusive inanities of  urlLink Nigel Marven , The Kratt Brothers (pictured above),  urlLink Steve Irwin --a.k.a. "The Crocodile Hunter"--and a host of similarly high-personality nature show upstarts, I've come to recognize him for the (inter)national treasure he is. At least David (the narrator and producer of such high-quality nature series as "Trials of Life" and the peerless "Blue Planet") knows when to get out of the frame, so we can actually watch the creatures in question. "The Crocodile Hunter" should be called "The Reptile Molester;" his show consists not of high-quality nature footage but of tiresome, croc- and snake-baiting stunts that reveal more about the psychological defects of a certain kind of thrill-seeking, attention-hogging human personality than anything about real animal behavior.  The Kratt Brothers' programs--like PBS's "Zaboomafoo"--are geared primarily to children, so they can be forgiven for their frequent bouts of camera-mugging and excruciatingly unfunny madcappery. (And when they aren't making cartoon-faces, they're also kind of hot.) What's Nigel Marven's excuse? At least Steve Irwin has contributed the word "crikey" to the field of obnoxious nature program hosting...Nigel Marven's catchphrase--I swear it's the only word he knows--is the far less interesting and entertaining "Fan-tastic!" Nigel Marven has earned himself a special place in Hell for participating in one of the worst nature films of all time, the execrable  urlLink Sea Monsters , in which Nigel Marven "interacts" and "observes" the habitats and behaviors of marine creatures...that died 35 million odd years ago. It's an expensive C.G.I. fest like "Walking With Dinosaurs"--which I happen to love--only it's got this preposterous and intelligence-insulting structure of bogus naturalist observation. Nigel Marven blue-screens his entire shtick, pretending to get nearly attacked by diplodocii (I made that spelling up) and to conduct--wholly scripted, wholly animated--"experiments" on Carcharadon Megalodons "in the wild." Every fifteen minutes or so, the language of Marven's narration will tip off that the whole thing is an elaborate put-on--meaning he occasionally gets around to mentioning the trifling fact that all of these creatures are long extinct--but for the most part, the program attempts to maintain the illusion that aspects of these creatures existence is being discovered and documented by the intrepid Nigel. Like it wouldn't be more fun and interesting and edifying for us to see, "Walking with Dinosaurs"-style, these creatures just behaving and existing, as scientists have concluded they did? Do we need to see Marven fending them off with cattle-prods--the anachronisms are too numerous, pointless, and perverse to mention--to make it exciting? How dumb do they think we are?  The reason there is so much shit nature programming on TV right now is probably that there are too many nonstop outlets for it: Animal Planet, National Geographic channel, Discovery. That is, too many hours in the day. There is only so much great --or even just noteworthy--nature filmmaking out there, and so much airtime to fill. Steve Irwin and his ilk are useful to these networks because, as recurring hosts, they create a kind of brand loyalty to their programs--otherwise, people who like spiders would watch the program on spiders, but wouldn't bother to tune in next week when grizzly bears are the feature creature. Also, their misadventures can be used to stretch 3 minutes of interesting nature-footage to an hour-long block of infotainment.   And the idiots out there, myself included, will tune in. I've already begun my once-a-year "Shark Week" experience--or, if you will, depressathon--and, true to form, every program they've aired so far has been utter shit. The week kicked off with the story of a "shark attack", hyped in advertisements for its astonishing real-life footage. It turned out to be about a diver who allowed herself to drift out of sight of her dive boat into a shoal of Jacks--a fish that, as she must've known, sharks LOVE to eat--and who, having neglected to check her air gauge, ran out of air while surrounded by reef sharks. She went to the surface and proceeded to scream and thrash for help for what seemed like twenty minutes, letting the camera run the whole time. (Hence the thrilling, real-life footage). The sharks, sensing her distress, began to get closer to her. Eventually, she realized that if she stopped thrashing and screaming, the sharks would leave her alone. And they did. Thrilling!  All of this was scored and edited for maximum "terror", even though nothing in the least bit frightening even happened.   And still I watch.  Crikey.

      I saw him again the other day. He was standing on the other side of the subway platform. I kind of stared him down for a moment and I'm pretty sure he recognized me.  He was dressed much better today: mid-priced jeans; a fancier T-shirt; shoes, not sneakers. Which means that he is definitely not homeless. Which means he absolutely had no excuse for doing what he did.  I had also just seen, on my walk to the subway, his little gift to the sidewalk. It was still there. So when I saw him, the memory of what he had done days before was still fresh in my head.  Excuse me while I vomit.

      I'm sure you're like  wha, no pictures?  but trust me you're glad. I came  this  close to using some of the images I found on a google image search for "shit on a sidewalk" and "dogshit" and "did you mean:  dog_shit ." I thought it might add some punch to my story. But I don't want a picture of actual excrement up here at the top of the site. Would you?  Anyway, I would like to start off by saying that  pissing  in public is the apex of the cool. It's hippie, it's punk, it's earthy  and  urban, all at once. Fuck the past four mayors for not actually doing anything about the public bathroom shortage/crisis in NYC.  Piss . Fuck the stores that oh so prominently place "Bathroom for CUSTOMERS ONLY" signs on their doors and windows.  Piss . Fuck the establishment for making me feel pathetic and gross because I'm about to spray in my pants because I a) don't want to pay a dollar for a tasteless biscotti just to pee and b) because I'm too afraid to whip it out on the street and let it flow because I've heard the public urination law actually does get enforced. Apparently, frequently.   I should've just  pissed .  Pissing in public is just plain badass, and it  feels  really good. It gives you deep shudders of urination pleasure like no other kind of peeing. I was at Veselka on 2nd the other day, and this guy, in broad daylight, just took it out and started peeing against the crosswalk sign. The street was crowded, there was a cop parked only half a block away, and he just took it out and let it rip. Awesome. And then he came in and bought a roll for breakfast. Without washing his hands first. Double awesome. It was pretty early in the day so it wasn't like one of those I'm-drunk-what-the-hell pissings in public.  Super  awesome.  But  shitting  in public--that is, in the street, in the park, behind a dumpster; basically anywheres that isn't in an actual toilet--is truly gross. I didn't know how gross I thought it was until I witnessed it myself. This morning. I was walking to the subway and I saw this fat guy crouched down around a corner. I thought from his posture that he was maybe changing out of running shorts or something, so I didn't slow down. I walked right past, as he hiked up his sweatpants-- no wiping! sick! --and made his way back to the pizza parlor he had, apparently, come from. (Their bathroom, I know for a fact, is chronically out of order.) He even had the dignity to tuck his t-shirt into his sweatpants afterwards. And as I walked past, I couldn't resist turning...and  seeing ...and  smelling ...oh christ, it was  awful .  I have three questions for Sir Shits-a-Lot.  1)Why, if you aren't homeless, would you shit on the sidewalk just like that?  2)Why, having gone out to that corner with the express purpose of dumping right there on the curb, didn't you bring some nappikins or baby wipes?  3)Who the fuck do you expect is going to clean that gnarly mess up? Your mama?   I HATE YOU.  Oh yeah, and a fourth question:  What the hell are you doing eating pizza at ten in the morning! Sick! It's no wonder you can't control your own bowels!

         It had occurred to me to bash iPods here before. But as a proud and adoring owner of an iPod myself, I thought it might be a bit hypocritical to use this forum to savage all iProducts and all iConsumers. To be perfectly honest, I didn't even mind being hypocritical, as long as I didn't get found out. Most certainly someone who knows me personally--that is, anyone who actually reads this b**g--would've thought to mention in the comments section that I was a dirty, two-faced liar and iPod owner.  But hah! My iPod broke the other day--from a measly 8 inch fall to the floor--so I can make fun of you all I want. iPods suck. (I miss you iPod). First of all, they are way too expensive. (Thanks Mom and Dad!) Second of all, they are ubiquitous in NYC. Which used to be annoying in a fun way, in that you could waste breath stopping to think or comment about their ubiquity. As in: "Look at how 60% of the people on this subway car are idiot idrones." But now the whole phenomenon has passed into the realm of the unworthy of mention. And that's just weird. We have this very specific-- and expensive --consumer choice in plain sight all day long, broadcast directly from 1 in 3-- the richer or more spoiled 1 in 3 --of every individual we pass each day. It's gone from amusing dimestore sociology fodder to the stuff of dystopian nightmare. Everybody does it but NO ONE dares comment about it.  Plus, that ad campaign is nightmarish. Plus, even if I hadn't dropped it, the--essentially irreplaceable--battery would've died out of natural causes in a few months. Plus they're going to keep building better ones each consumer cycle, to make all of us who bought the early model--" What? You only have 40 MBs?"-- feel stupid for not having waited. Plus as you can see even Celine fucking Dion has one now. Plus...  Fuck it. I'm going to the iPod store to see if they can fix this. I love you, Baby!

         Uh-oh. Mom's in town. What to do? Where to take her?   Well, my mom's a pretty hip lady, so I usually take her to my favorite boutique-style vinyl store. She loves it! Turns out, she's totally down with the hipster lifestyle of me and my sister! Which is a good thing too, because she  finances  it!   I could even leave her alone for a few hours--I had to go downtown to replace my designer "haagen-daaz" purple t-shirt, cuz I dripped fish sauce on it last night at Nobu--and turns out she had a great time at the farmers' market. No one can say Mrs. Liddy Davenport doesn't know how to have  urlLink a good time !   Mom, you rule!    urlLink Dad , don't think I've forgotten about you. I know you think my single-occupancy East Village duplex is kind of a dump, and that you wish I lived with  urlLink my sister Tennessee  on the Upper East Side, but as a part-time DJ at small New York nightclubs, it really pays for me to be closer to where the action is. So keep those checks coming, Pop. Love ya!

         You know what movie I love? "Little Shop of Horrors." You know what my favorite part of "Little Shop of Horrors" is? (Except for the plant and Ellen Greene's hilariously breathy pronunciation of "Doctor", of course). Those Downtown doo-wop girls on the corner, singing and commenting on the crazy doings of the--white--cast of characters. But I always thought it was a bit problematic, even though I was only 9 or so when I first saw it. I mean, why is it that those three girls aren't granted characterhood? Why are they never even conceivable as potential food for Audrey II? Why is it that all they get to do is sing and dance?  Ultimately, Little Shop of Horrors is campy enough and stylized enough to get away with this borderline racist dynamic. But what the hell is "A Cinderella Story"'s excuse? Why is it that everytime Hollywood wants to hip up a square and uninspired romantic comedy, usually of the "urban and/or modern fairy tale" variety, they have to cast a black actor or actress in the role of "wisecracking, 'you-go-girl' best friend," "prophetic and wise homeless man," "sassy fairygodmother," etc.?   Think about it. How many movies have pulled this shit in the past twenty years? I don't have a figure offhand; I should've kept notes. But off the top of my head, there is: "It Could Happen to You" (Black homeless man narrating white lovers' story, directly addressing the audience about New York as the city of dreams), "Pretty Woman" (Black homeless man directly addressing audience about LA as city of dreams),"The Hudsucker Proxy" (Black man runs the clocktower; knows all; narrates the comic travails of the white--read  actual --characters). These three--and there are others like it--are probably the most egregious. But there are also slightly more subtle variations on this: Whoopi Goldberg in "Ghost," Djimon Hounson in "In America," Morgan Freeman in "Bruce Almighty". Not to mention that eternal character of the savvy Black homeless man in disaster movies, who always--correctly--prophesizes the imminent disaster, seen most recently in "The Day After Tomorrow."  Regina King is an entertaining and vivid actress--she was pretty terrific as Cuba Gooding Jr's grasping NFL wife in "Jerry Maguire"--and I'm not calling her an Aunt Tammy for taking this role. Actors need whatever work they can get. But the producers and screenwriters who perpetuate this crap need to be called on it. Middlebrow, risk-averse racial humor has been a drag on movies ever since Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy paired up in "48 Hours"--and even that had some kind of edge to it, especially compared to current race-based comedy, like "White Chicks." Does Regina King have to play sassy best-friend/fairy godmother to  urlLink Little Miss Whitey-White  and her beau,  urlLink Master Whitey Corngood McWhite ? Should she have to? What impulse or idea are HW suits trying to flatter by having these happy second-fiddlers cheer on our whitey-white couplings and romantic wish-fulfillments?

      I finally got around to checking out the blog co-written by Josh Chafetz, the critic who poison-penned Thomas Frank in the Times a few weeks ago. Wowzer! Are these boys  dull .   I decided to turn how boring their blog is into a kind of game, a test of endurance. If you can read  urlLink this post , and then  urlLink this post , and then-- still with me? -- urlLink this post , straight-through, without snoozing, snoring, or even yawning, I promise to mail you a quarter. For real. If you-- honestly, now --can read this self-serious, dry-as-dust, new-generation, post-Sullivan conservative garbage without yawning-- even tiny yawns count --I will put a quarter in the mail for you.  Just e-mail me your address with a formal-sounding statement to the effect of: "I hereby solemnly swear I read the entirety of these blog postings by the good people of oxblog without falling even briefly asleep and without yawning even a tiny little yawn. Now give me a quarter."  Can e-mails be notarized?  Nomatter. We will abide by a strict honor system. I trust you to be honest; you trust me to send you a quarter.  If you're a glutton for punishment, here's further proof of the snooze-factor of oxblog, their homepage tagline: "The off-the-cuff political commentary of Josh Chafetz, a 2001 Rhodes Scholar and graduate student in politics at Oxford, David Adesnik, a 2000 Rhodes Scholar and graduate student in international relations at Oxford currently residing in Cambridge, Mass., and Patrick Belton, a graduate student in international relations at Oxford."  Also of utter non-interest, David Adesnik chaffes at being called a humorless elitist  urlLink here , offering up this astonishingly pompous and regal-sounding statement as a rejoinder to his critic: "Actually, no. Rhodes Scholars may be part of an elite, but 'elitism' refers to those who look down on the mass public. When push comes to shove, I've got a lot of faith in the aggregate rationality of the American public."  The "aggregate rationality," eh? Way to set us straight on the point of your humorless elitism, Davey. Of course, it would never occur to prigs like these that the reason they come off as humorless, self-serious elitists is not because they have Rhodes scholarships or because they are graduate students in something-or-other at Oxford, but because they plaster this information, prominently and frequently, all over their friggin' website! They probably thinks it makes them sound professional and accomplished. All it really does is make them sound like the credential-mongering respect-whores they are.     Postscript   OK, ok, I'll admit it. Sometimes oxblog has some interesting things to say. I found this  urlLink tippy-top post  quite illuminating.

         I've always been the first to complain about the New York Times Book Review's editorial policy of encouraging cuddly, anodyne, judgement-free criticism. But in the past three weeks I've seen two worthy books get savaged by morons and it's really ticked me off.  A couple weeks ago,  urlLink Josh Chafetz  took down Thomas Frank's new book, "What's the Matter with Kansas." And in yesterday's section,  urlLink Richard Brookhiser  took a leak all over Hendrik Hertzberg's collection of essays, "Politics: Observations and Arguments."   I've read and admired Frank's book, and although I haven't read Hertzberg's collection yet, I've read enough of his columns for the New Yorker to know his book deserved more than the hatchet job it received in the Times. Worse, this was a  hack  hatchet job. It is one thing to let an obvious ideological opposite review someone's book--even one by a writer as estimable and honorable as Hertzberg--but another to be so editorially lax as to not require said critic to make some kind of caveat, some fair warning about where they're coming from. (Brookhiser is ID'd by the vague title of one of his books; it isn't mentioned that he's a Senior Editor at National Review). Brookhiser's judgement is summary, resolute; he doesn't appear to be intimidated by the fact that Hertzberg can write and think circles around him, because from his safe perch as a contributor to the Book Review he can be as selective as he wants in describing Hertzberg's book. Really, Brookhiser's argument, such as it is, hinges on one measly sentence from the whole of Hertzberg's book. If you've never read Hertzberg before, you'd have no idea that he is one of the two or three most eloquent, reasonable, and fundamentally decent of all liberal commentators. Even an enemy should be able to acknowledge this; a decent person might even feel compelled to.  The less said about the Chafetz piece the better. He'd have us consider Frank the Ann Coulter of the left. Last week I think Ted Rall was the Ann Coulter of the left. (Where would conservative bloggers and commentators like Chafetz and Andrew Sullivan be without good old, reliably stupid Ted Rall to offer up as a 'representative' example of left-wing inanity?) If we're moving in that direction, soon enough we're going to have to find some liberal Republicans to peg as the new Ann Coulter of the left.   Neither review bothers to argue substantively with the content of the books under discussion. Isn't there a word for that? Oh yeah: shit criticism. And isn't there a word for an editorial staff that allows shit criticism to grace its--incredibly influential, book-sale making-and-breaking--pages? Oh yeah: yellow-bellied journalism.   The New York Times needs to stop cowering and catering to its right-wing critics. Do its editors really think this charge will ever go away? Do they think these people will ever shut up? Then the editors must be dumber than I thought.   I won't even mention Michiko's  urlLink insipid review  of Bill Clinton's memoir....except to say that there is no writer alive who so proudly brandishes received ideas as their own freshly-minted insights. Ugh.

         I hate to say it, but it might be about time to rescue Cesare Lombroso's theories of physiognomy and social deviance from the junk heap of long-discredited pseudoscience. Sure, his work is now about as respected in the scientific community as phrenology, a related and contemporary phenomenon. And his theory--that criminality could be determined from facial bone structure and other physical characteristics--may have some eerie similarities to eugenics, and was essentially a way of demonizing people based not on crimes they actually committed but on crimes they might one day commit. Men with overbites will likely go on to rape someone...long noses and short eyebrows = potential child murderer. This is obviously bunk.  But as there is no denying that  urlLink "gay face"  is a very real and widespread phenomenon, so there is no denying that a whole lot of  urlLink Republican males  look, well, creepily  samey . I'm not saying it's a bad thing. It isn't even exceptional ugliness that defines it, either, though, to be sure, they are all mostly quite ugly. It's almost indescribable, yet quite apparent even to the untrained eye. Which party does  urlLink this man  vote for, do you think?   It consists, I think, in a kind of physical obliviousness. These are all men who would fart loudly in a crowded elevator and pretend--even to themselves--that nothing at all out of the ordinary had just happened. These men look like they've never had a trauma-free bowel movement in their lives. They have uneasy, unpleasant faces; when they frown or  urlLink look serious , you half expect them to keel over from either a massive coronary or the sheer eruptive force of a 30 pound fecal impaction. But then  urlLink they smile ,and you realize their brightest smiles are far worse and more nightmarish than even their grimmest, most constipated grimace.   This is all almost universally true, at least of the  urlLink white ones .   Oh wait, even some  urlLink black Republicans  have it!   Wow, even the  urlLink gay ones !  This thing is definitely genetic.

         Have you seen that video where there's like this band, and they're either on a stage in a concert hall, at an arena, or on top of a car in a parking lot at an impromptu concert, and all their fans are cheering and screaming and raging and pumping their fists in righteous-looking support for this, their favorite band, and like there's shit flying around, cuz sometimes the band is bluescreened and there's weird chaotic cgi shit going on around and above the band, like sometimes when the drummer goes real wild or the distorted bass line gets really funky the whole image will shudder, and distort, and we'll get weird, roto-scopic shots of the fans in the audience, and the whole thing is edited real fast, and the audience of pierced and tattooed and obviously paid extras, who are all either skater-punks, creepy purple-tongued neo-goths, or ridiculously attractive teen models pretending to be either, are just loving this shit, they fucking love it!, because THIS is their FAVORITE band, and the lead singer is hopping around and bouncing into and out of the camera's frame, sometimes even falling to his knees, and then we see quick shots of the band's fans at home, staring the camera down righteously, "this is my sanctuary", their bedrooms, look at the posters, I like the same stuff they do! and they are wearing the t-shirts of the same band whose video they are currently in and their faces are just the peak of adolescent, indignant disaffection, and then one of them raises an arm and gives the finger to the camera, which is digitally blurred, blocked-out--fuck you MTV!--before we cut back to the concert on the roof of a car or in a shopping mall or in what looks like some kid's dingy rec room, man that could be my rec room! and all the homegrown, local fans are loving it cuz this band is so fucking REAL man, YES, I love Knucklebutt! I can't live without MamaSLUDGe I'd die if Kracklewuss ever broke up or stopped putting out awesome records and it's so cool that they are still thrashing and keeping it real by kicking ass in parking lots and I know they're doing it cuz they got something to say and not because the camera's are on, and that they are taking part in this elaborately staged representation of a small punk concert instead of an actual small concert because they just love the music and NOT because they are selling a vision of my disaffection right on back to younger and stupider and more gullible and more vulnerable disaffected Crudd fans than I in order to move on, keep on moving on, moving on more and more units. NO WAY!  Papa Roach would never do that.

         Looking for ways to spruce up your tired, pseudo-19th Century village? I find that a coat of puke-yellow paint, applied evenly to the bark of the trees that enclose my little Mennonite community, really spruces things up. Be sure to wear a robe while you do it, to avoid any unsightly yellow stains.   It's a great way to sex up the village's border. Plus, it helps keep the fake monsters out!

      The following is taken from the letters section of  Entertainment Weekly . Yes, I read  Entertainment Weekly . Not usually the letters section, but I was on a plane when I read it. That is my excuse.  "While reading this week's movie reviews, I was reminded of the  Friends  episode in which Joey uses a thesaurus to replace every word (to a hilarious end) in a recommendation letter he writes for Monica and Chandler. Was it necessary for Owen Gleiberman to write of  Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy , "Yet his stentorian tones and myopic gleam of authority are just a lightly packaged version of his off-camera singles bar swagger," when what he really meant was "Ron Burgundy = unfunny crap?" Gravely, whilst yours truly remains overwhelmed via your astuteness, I emphatically inscribe the assessment subsequently with the intention that the arithmetic mean individuals originating in the cohesive territories of America will be capable of deciphering said magazine's estimations approximating the filmic depictions. Is that too much to ask?"   Sherry Mann   Carlisle, Pa.   Sniffing out and whining about perceived snootiness in what is patently, professedly middlebrow is a common hobby of the proudly idiotic. Like Sherry Mann.
