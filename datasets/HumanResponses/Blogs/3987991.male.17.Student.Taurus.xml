      A Buddha   A happy face there The ears there for compassion A self god sitting.   School   Don't want to be here I would rather be at home But my friends are here.   Nirvana   A world of peace The sky looks like the water My soul looks like bliss.   Meditation   Calm water so still The language of my mind In meditation.

      A couple of nights ago I had a dream that I was back in school. I saw my schedule and was so happy that I had a different biology class this time. Hopefully that will happen though. Last night I had a dream that I was hanging out with Crystal and Naomi but they were acting like they didn't want me around them. I haven't seen them since early 2003.  I wrote a new Haiku and Tanka last night. Both of them have the same title. A Haiku's syllables go 5-7-5. A Tanka's syllables go 5-7-5-7-7.   Illusions  (Haiku)  Illusions are fake Reality is for real Find it within you.    Illusions  (Tanka)  Illusions are fake Reality is for real Find it within you. To others it is not real But they are all part of it.

         My name is Clint. I was born in the year of the rabbit, month of the Hare moon, 28th day. I was born in Dallas at about 8:30PM on a stormy Tuesday night. Through out my life I have had a few connections to spirituality. I knew that dreams are not there for entertainment, they are there to show us what is going on in our life and our future. The first symbol that had me staring at it and soon having a spiritual connection to was the tao aka yin & yang. I have always believed that as humans we can still change our life and the lives of those around us with our spirit.  My interests in spirituality are: dreams, meditation, and Buddhism. My other interests are: music, poetry, writing, reading, love, friendship, parks, and the internet.  I used to be a Neo-Pagan Witch. One night it just came to me that Paganism was not my path. I only worshipped deities because other Pagans did. I only did magick because I knew how. Walking the Pagan path in general had me feeling like I was trying toomuch. I simply just quit and I felt like I was myself in spirituality. I started meditating more and seeking harmony. Buddhism is something that has interested me for a long time. I started studying it two years ago. During my Pagan path I bought a Buddha statue because I just had to. Now I have more Buddha statues and my altar is now a Buddhist shrine. Practicing Buddhism (I am into  urlLink Mahayana  Buddhism) feels more natural and even familiar to me. I don't feel like I'm trying at all. For four days I was deciding if I should change to a Buddhist and I did. This path I embraced feels so familiar to me. It's like I'm picking back up where I left off long ago. During my Pagan path I myself was hedonistic. I read the Four Noble Truths and was in denial that desire and hedonistic life causes suffering. I was wrong and I realized it. So now I am meditating everyday infront of my shrine, saying mantras, and sometimes praying with my mala. I feel I have wasted my time walking the Pagan path, but as a Buddhist I shall forget the past and start a new present life. I do not necessarily see Buddhism as my religion. To me it is a life philosophy.  My favorite bands are Nirvana, A Perfect Circle, System of a Down, Windham Hill, Cradle of Filth, and Marilyn Manson. I enjoy any kind of music. Music is music; a very beautiful art.  You can chat with me on  AIM . My screen name is  candlewyck3 .
