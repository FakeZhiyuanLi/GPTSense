      well, saturday night was quite interesting. forst we were going to noodels, and mart told me a LOT too much information about a new skill that she learned about.. You will have to talk to her about that. Then   we went to bearsies, and as usual the dog she just got was being fought over for tha majority of the time. The other time we were just fighting in a large brawl ( as usual) it was brian  and me vs. mart and claire and ess tess. Any pretty much we all just got pissed at eachother and nothing went good. Then afterwards, claire and sarah got mondo pissed at me and brian for all of our innaproperite sex coments throughtout our lives. And some other stuff. Like we make some juskes, but i think they;re pretty funny. Obviously girls disagree about the nature of them> Like boats classisc "lets play the nipple game" and Brian " haha sarahs gonnna loose because she doesnt have nipples" well it was kinds funny at the time, but whatev. So yea sarah needs to stop getting grossed out with people KISSING in truth or dare. Just cause u hvaent isnt a reason to be mad!!!!  Im david wilkinson, and thats the was the cookie crumbels

      whast up to the peoud few that read this peice of literature. WOW WE ARE FINALLY DONE WITH sCHOOL!!!!!! now i only have to real 3 friggen books this summer... wow that sucks balls. So, last night we lost another soccer game to Eagen 3-1. and the last two times we played them we tied, so i am just getting pissed at soccer cause we cant find a way to scome together and win. THen after soccer a bunch of peoples came to da CLUB shaggin. that would've been a good time if i wernt in a bad mood. We did play this ineresting game that invloved taking off an item of clothing if you drew a lower card then everyone else. All i have to say is i admire clair stringers courage in actually playing the game limke a player and setting an example for the rest of us to follow. someone who will remained nameless quit in the game casue she was "scared" of removing items of clothing. wow who does that?  anyways, the MTV video awards are on tonight and we should all get pumped cause a dimalicious dime is hosting it, named lindsey lohan.  GOOD SONG- Pump it up by Joe Budden

      wow what a long time since i have last spoken my words to you all. thjats cause i almost lost my fingers in a sad mowing/figure skating accident but luckily they were sowen back on. So a lot has happened since i last have spoken. First off, we got through Euro. ok enought talking/speakibng about that shit class for the rest of my life. School is only 1 day away from being finished. THANK GOD and another god i worship, sarah the goddess of love. Today i started a new processes in my life called- expanding my web and phasing out any of my old friends that are girls in particular andrea martinson. O wait, thats just what she thought i was doing cause i didnt sit with the usual people at lunch today. but then we realized i didnt sit there cause the entire friggen school had the same lunch. So, soccer has been going well, if any of you are wondering. We are like 0-10000 but hey were doing well... we have a game on WEDNESDAYW at 7 at oak park so you should all be there or i will haze you all by making u drink, run outside in the rain, suck down twinkies, make u suck a raw bratwords, and kick you endless. o and ill also get caught and get a ticket for DWI and get expelled from highschool (o wait thats not me). anyways, im the popularist guy in the group, big ass titties bitches think im cute. and im out

      last night was a good time. i went to jonnys casa and first we watched a nice&nbsp; movie, the 6th sense. wait a&nbsp;minute i hated it. but then after taht we did something else that was quite a good time. now i cant say what it was but it invloved going to cub foods at about 12;30 which was interesting cause we saw tyler nygrens mom and she was tight. then, as we were driving around at about 1 ish by the susan lindgrin parking lot, we saw no other then clayton burrows. gosh, what is it with that kid and doing stuff in the SLP. we should rename it the memorial clay burrows parking lot of pimpdom or something like that. for all of you who dont know what im talking aobut, we have randomly caught clay in that parking lot on numerous occations going at it wich such names as andrea martinson. ill leave you with that  and  stay  classy

      well this is what i realized today. that on next monday, school unoffically starts. firsrt of all, its becasue capitans practices starts which gets us all in the swing of things for school and marks that its close enough to have practices realeating to the HS meaning its gotta start soon. next off, it will make my days structured again, also a sign that school starts. also, it will mark the beginging of august (almost) also meaning school is coming. next, it will make all of us relaize that we only have like a month to read anywhere from 1 to like 4 books that we will have to cram in to the last week of august, or night, because some idiot decided that summer homework would help. pretty much we will ahve to get off our lazy asses and do something productive for the first time in 2 months.  i know it sucks and i want to like hijack two planes and run them into somewhere cause of it but im not gonna cause i know what would happen.  well i&nbsp; just got the call so im outta here.

      well, what is up todos. tonight was a pretty good time. first me and brad and mart discussed how david is the biggest pussy when it comes to girls and he needs to change that in a big way. also how he has potential but doesnt utalize it. then clay and boat and brian and bouchard and wenzel and will and megan folkes show up all at different times and we just had one grand of a party. we played some hot donut and i just remembered how incredibly fun that game is. especially seeing brian wince in pain cuase clay hits a ball and pierces brians left testy. we also watched this hot britney spears concert and we all must have creamed cause she is such a good singer. o wait, no shes afwal (but shes definitely bonable). well thats about it except that when i went to tell my parents that everyone was gone their bedroom door was locked and then about 5 min later my mom&nbsp; comes out with just a shirt on. thats pretty discusting. so to leave you with that pretty picture in your head, im gonna go now so adios

      and then,on&nbsp; the third day god created the 34 calibur shotgun so we could kill animals... and homosexuals  anyways, it feel that the time is right to pick up where i left off and blog a massive corn filled entry as if i were sitting on the toliet reading. so last night i hung&nbsp;out with who some like to call "the chosen ones". i dont really like the classification of sammy, tina and emma (maybe a chelsmo04 too) as the chosed ones so we just wont calll them that. and i realized two things. as much as no one likes to admit it, some girls just cant stand when like em of al or blt of anyone hangs out with those girls. the other thing i learned last night is that "some girls" pretty much just means sarah. o, and another thing, that f-ing girl gets so mad because O MAN she has to pay david back for doing something nice like paying for her like 3 weeks ago when she had money herself but was to scared to break a twenty. sory&nbsp; that this has turned into a sarah basshfest, but it seems that every time i hang out with her there is just something more that pisses me off and i need to vent. kinda like in sarahs blogs when shes like ITs that time of the month again where i list 8 pages of things that i hate... on a pleasenter note, lots has happened since i lasted blogged. lets seee, jonny had made his return from his camp, which is a good thing cause the kid is tight. also, brian had made his salir to mexico which is a bad/good thing for him or us however you look at it. also, for u that havent been caught up in current news claire stringer is in the outter banks ( i hate you&nbsp; claire) lets see whoelse is gone... c wenzel is at the&nbsp;cabin, sarah i hear is at her cabin, i know that b brink is at camp... and i think that daine johnson is visiting his grandparents in Kentucky. did i miss anyone,... o yes ann is in paris.   well i think that i shal follow in alex's footsteps and make my own list on who i predict is going to homecoming. and unlike his list, this one is emnt to affend, hurt or make fun of anyone i list. i hope you all feel deep hatred and pissed off-ness after u read this.  alex and ms paige (or sarah thompson) andrea, sarah and ally with&nbsp; clay brian and the dog for all of you who know who the dog is sammy and maybe x tina or emma chelsmo04 and jonathan thompson alaina and brink - i dont know if they'll get around to actualyl showing up. but trust me they will be together jon rich and hannah terhar claire and spenser clair and some random freshmen katey and swaskabson andy sack and the entire hot section of the girl sophomore section bradly and kathryn peters and me.. thats a good quest. dont we all wish we knew  well i like scotch and im gonna go drink some  and by the way. i know it&nbsp;says that im not a virgin b/c i use extra exorbant tampons and that tampons somehow relate to if i had sex or not cause of the breaking of my hymen and blood flow releated to that... but i cant help it that i have a heavy flow and a wide set vagina   david wilkinson is out the window  &nbsp;

      the rules of life. i know many of you have never heard of them but i have and i think that you all should knw them so u can generally live better lives. the orgins of these rules start with none other then boatsky byers, and flourished over many days and random spirts of influance from many people. so pretty much they go like this  1)  get pumped  2)  come with speed  3)  get past the initial shock  4)   play the game like u aint got nothin to loose  5)  cream left, cream right, cream center  7)  worship the sacred families(kong, glotter, meyer)  8)  aint no shame  9)  put chur thang down, flip it and reserve it  10)  timing is everything  18)   Always have a latin lover  Its very obvious where these come into play, and for the most part 2 or 3 or 4 will come into play each and every day. For example, if you are having a bad day or have nothing to do, get pumped, then play the game like u aint got nothin to loose and call someone new. Now timing here is evrything, cause u have to get a hold of that person at the right time.  Lets see, in HS you really have to play the game like u aint got nothin to loose, becasue u really dont have anything.. no job, not much money, no wife, no kids, no taxes, nothing to do except playing the game like u aint got nothin to loose.   Or lets see we find Clay burrows in the Susan lindgrin parking lot like we have many a time before, we would have to get past the initial shock and actually make the situation into somehting that much better. for example, pull or a video camera and record it or picturaize it.  Pretty much, these rules of like are utility things that u should have memorized and should use because i really know that they will help your social, academic, sporting and sex life. trust me on that. so just use em cause thats why they're there

      school dances whata great thing in life. id just lie to give so much credit to any dance/club or anything where people dance bacause they are so amazing. i got in the mood to just let loose on  the dance floor a lil bit ago because i made a GET PUMPED mix and it made me want to be at homecoming so bad. i reminded me of the sweating bodies rubbing against eachother and the beat of the bass exhoing through your entire body as hundreds of people rub their bodies in constant motion. WOW am i excited for homecoming. me and brad will have to show out so hot of dance of moves on the floor for hours and hours. SO i really hoep u all are practicing all the latest moves and getting as pumped as i am because homecoming is gonna be amazing. just picture the croded, 100 degree dance floor that is at least two times to small. and then picture get low coming on, or yea or even a little lean back and picture the amazingness and energy of everybody within a hearible distance. then picture after the dance when your body is coated in a fine salty sweat and walking outside into the brisk air and as you load the bus you are in the best mood possible. i just cant take it right now i need to be at homecoming

      well i just realized that its soo much more fun doing stuff with people u havent huing out with in a while or that u dont hang out with every day than pple u hang out with so much. like all u junior gals. we havent been hanging out as much so tonight when we did it was so much better. and u sophomores its also sooo fun because we never have hung out and so its just cool to hang out with you too. so i just have to say that if you are getting bored in HS which is hard to do then u should really try to expand and make new friendships casuse it makes life more enjoyable and not so boring.  also, i have also just realized that one of the good things about getting older is that its not Jr. High style when it comes to liking someone or telling someone ur feelings. like since we have got into HS, it just sems like kids finally can feel confident enough to open up and tell someone what they're really feeling. it makes things so much better and eaiser and people dont get mad anymore or as jelous and i would have to say that if ur one of the poeple who doesnt or cant open up when it somes to feelings about a friend or a boy or a girl that u really need to b/c it makes things soooooo much eaiser. so yea i hope you take my peice(piece) of advice bacasue it has really worked for me lately.   -what a corny blog-

      id just like to bring up the topic of TPing. Most of us know that TPing means toliet papering(unless ur travis jacobson and didnt realize taht till like a month ago). i think that TPing is a good time and if you TP someone u should do a good job for the purpose of them having to clean it up linger and teh self satisfaction taht u actually did a good job. yes i do TP people, and yes i do get TPed. id just like to bring up that someone tried to TP me last night and it was the most embarising job ever. so i hope whoever did it brags about it and tries to fell cool about it but then they will read this and feel like an idiot becasue they used about 5 rools. and all of those rools were about shoulder level in my tree. my cat cleaned it up. it took him 5 minutes. and hes fat. so there you have it i will see u all in about 16 minutes.

      let me repeat kids(BOYS ANSD GIRLS) in my grade, this  statement is entirely true that i published a couple of days ago about the girls that are going into 10th grade     ...they aren't just girls that david hangs out with to get action from as some girls/boys in my grade like to think...(1)     i hang out with them bacause i have a fun time with them for numerous reasons. i never have so its fun b/c they are new. they are cool people and i like hanging out with cool people .   so whatever your common misconceptions are just dont think something just cause u wanna think that    but ive made too big of deal out of this anyways so this is over

      todays topic. the club shaggin also known as as the shagin wagin id just thought id dedicate a blog to it cause it really deserves credit. first of all, what it is is a  small house that david, brian and his dad built 2 summers ago in daves backyard. sounds like a dorkey treehouse but its nice. it was electricity, carpet, drywalls and paint and phone and cable. so its painted like a deep redish color and there are a bunch of shelves in there and candels and places to put ur cell fones and stuff like that. its about the size of a large bathroom, 8 by 8 to be exact, so its not too big but its nice and secluded and that is key. so thats what it looks like, and the stuff that happens in there is tight too- just becasue its so small and there is nothing to do in there except  as some like to call "taping". just stuff that u wouldnt tell ur parents about. so there are so many good experiences in there and so many things that have gone down that i really think someone needs to get on making a book describing the greatness of it. also, someone needs to make like a plaque of sometihg that would be the tap list for all of the names of people who have taped in thurr. so if someone would please get on that it would be great. the only other thinkg i can think of that she club shagin is missing is come type of good air conditioning system as we found out a couple of night ago when everyone was sweating perfussely and personally my shirt was drenched with sweat. it was gorss, almost as gross as what goes on in club shagin which gets back to my origional point that the shagin is one of the bast things that happened in life. so i know that some will try to deny that the shagin doesnt posees some magical power of love but  i think it does and IF u havent been in there, go tthere cause i gaurantee u will have a good time

      well im not gonna lie  its been apparent that i have started hanging out with the girls that were formally known as the "freshman girls" and id just like to comment about that and what not... contrary to the common misconception, they arent just girls that david hangs out with to get action from as some girls in my grade refer to them as, but they are actually just like all of us except a year younger. and its just fuin to hang out with them cause its fun hanging out with new people and i think that they are all pretty. so id thought that id jsut throw that one out there casue this is my blog and i can pretty much say what i want to. like alex has one testicle.. yea thats right, what are u gonna do about it. im jsut speaking the truth. or that sarah has no nipples... or how about that ally/andrea thinks that shes like fat or something crazy like that. well if i talk anymore i will reveal the next attack thats being planed on america.. yea maybe that one would be a bad idea.  but as i always say, dont find yourself buried in a pile of warm cheese mixed with breast milk. untill then its been a pleasure
