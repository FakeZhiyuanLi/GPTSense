       Hello again,   As i doubt i have any faithful readers out side of those that know me i'll dispense with the apologies for not posting in almost a week.   I've been in a little town in Idaho called Mountian Home. On the Air Force base to be exact. I was visiting family up there and truth be told i had a blast. My uncle is a Lt. Col up there and he just got himself a new command. That's why we were up there. I got to see an active duty F-15 whle it was still on the flight line. Seeing them in a museum is one thing but when you have other F-15's and F-16's taking off less than a hundred yards from you it's a whole new experiance. The other cool thing was that i got to see the Charlie Daniles Band play at the base. i guess if any one out there has ever heard "The devil went down to Georgia" you can guess what that was like.   Amber took another pregnancy test and it came up negative to. Next i see her i'm going to buy her one of those E.P.T. things for her to take when she gets home in about 10 days. Hopefully it'll say the same thing.   My big sister Sara and my Girl freind Megan have been hanging out together. it seems like i created my own worst nightmare when suggested Sara help Meg with her mom. Both f them know things about me now that neither should. It's going to be one hell of a time when i go back for a while in December.If it were possible i'd say i was a little scared.   While in Idaho i was taching some of my family to DDR. (Dance Dance Revolution) For only having a crappy pad to use they did well. My cousin jason got really into it prety fast and got pretty good for only having a week to play. My little cousin Ryan is like 7 and he can already do Max Unlimited on beginner. He's not aceing it but that's still something.   Well that's pretty much all i have to say today. I have the next couple of days off so if i think of anything you can bet it'll be here.   7-31-04

       hello all,   I have enabled comments on this blog so if any one out there wants to say something to me feel free. You don't have to sign up any more.   Today is back to work. I found it exremely hard to get up. But doesn't every one on Monday?   I have great news. I now know for a fact I'm not going to be a daddy. Let's just say that there is one thing that proves with out a doubt that a girl isn't pregnant and it happened. I'll leave it at that.   My worries as of recently however still reside around one person. My former brother Julian. I say former because well....things happened with his girl friend Cora while he was in jail once. Before you think badly about me let me just say that it was equally her doing as mine. So any way Julian and I have obviously had troubles. However, since I left it seems to have become worse. He now feels the need to carry a gun and consort with men of low honor. (makes me sound like a wannabe samurai I know but that's really how I think) I even think he may have gotten into worse things. Despite my problems with him I still consider him like my little brother and have been looking out for him from a distance for a while now. That's why this bugs me so bad. I can't seem to convince any one to talk to him for me so I guess I'll have to do it myself. I often times find myself missing the camaraderie we once shared but I see now that a fight between us is inevitable even now that I have left. More so now that I think about it.   A lot has passed between us through these few years but it must come to an end. I fear only his near or total death will make him realize. Or mine in the process. But I wont be the one to do it. I'll teach him because now I'm confident I could take him but I wont hurt him to bad.   I owe him to much.   8-2-04

       I want to reply to a comment by an annonymous person.         Anonymous said... How do you think that your girlfriends Amber and Megan feel reading this and having their hearts ripped open? From what I have read Amber trusts you with all her heart and has had a hard life did you even think about her when you were with Cora? Or how about Megan? Do you think that she really needs your bullshit? It seems to me that if they can forgive you then they must really love you alot. Because they could do a hell of alot better.      As is stands now yes they both could do very much better than. But when this went down Megan was just a good freind and i was only begining to date Amber. They both love me very much and for that i am extremely grateful. As for how they feel when they read this...i do know. It kills me to think about it as well. But when i was with Cora...no. I had no thoughts but the moment. Please understand anonymous this was the worst time for me because i saw the worst human being i could possibly be at the same time i found a life i was happy with. Realize that up untill Cora told Julian i was happy. Vey happy. I had everything going for me. Then everything went to hell. But now i am happy again. I have more than i ever had before. Two girls that love me enough to forgive me for this and move on not being the least.    Despite my past transgressions i am not a bad person. I am a High Preist of Ral. Purification is what i do. That's why i wrote this down. This blog is not ment to be a journal or a confession booth, it is ment for me to show what i'm really thinking. I cannot say half the things i have written because something i my head wont let me. But when i write it i dont have that problem.    I have since talked to Cora. She actually commented on one of these posts. I can't believe she still calls me Lee-chan. Things between us can now begin to heal. Things with in me can now begin to heal. That is why i posted the information.

        Soon Eric came back and Cora had second thoughts about all that went on. She wanted to tell him. I didn't. But she did eventually and i was forced to cover. I lied to all of them. Julian, Amber, Endy, (my other then brother) to save myself. That is now my greatest regret in life. Those days became my most desprate and i more than contemplated suicide many times. I came so close that i had a gun to my own head at one point because of the fact that julian was now out for blood, Cora hated me, and i was having to lie to the girl i loved. But each time i stopped because i thought of a new way out. Eventually i blamed it all on Cora. Like she was lieing for some reason. It didn't fly.   Julian and i were at each other's throats for months after that. My life was never the same from those days on. Eventually things calmed down.   Cora disappeared from my life. My biggest regret from this. Julian and i began to talk again but it was never the same. Amber now dislikes Cora very much because she belives(with good reason) That their whole relationship was lies. Julian and Cora are no longer together and Julian is no longer the man i knew. I hope for peace between Cora and i. I know it will never be the same but i have to set these demons to rest before i can go on.   I miss the sense of togetherness we all had. When we were all together everything was possible. But it's gone now and i am lessened for it.   Though i still some times wonder how things might have been and if she still knows how often i think of her and regret what i did. I'm not attempting apologize or make up for what i did. it's far to late for that. I either want to attone for it by what ever means or to out it behind me once and for all. Either way i know some the people that read this will have some things to say. At least as far things no one but i knew. perhaps this is how i will attone for my sins....... by loosing everything again and starting over.......at least it will be with a clean heart and concience.

       I know i haven't posted in about 5 days but then my every day life isn't all that interesting. But recently, as in the last 3 days a few things from 'back in the day' have come back to the forefront of my attention. I'll start from the beginning:   It was almost a year ago that it all began. My then brother, Julian, was dating a girl by the name of Cora. I had just begun dating Amber so our relationship was still in the begining stages. Well Julian went to jail, (i recently found that he went on vacation) and assigned me as Cora's guard. ( break monolouge for one second. I am a faighter. A good one at that. I was the only and best choice he had.) Well i accepted as i would for my brother. My honor was at stake and i was determined to do well at the task i was given. This was around halloween. And in Ohio that is a very nice time of year so we were out running around all the time. I went over to Cora's just about every other day to check up on her. Again i took my job very seriously and kept the relationship professional. But then things began to change. My memory on the night isn't what it was but we were walking along the highway to Cora's house. It was Cora, Amber and I at night. For one reason or another a passing driver threw and egg that hit Cora just below the collar bone with enough force the knock the breath out of her. I never saw it coming. I thought i smelled blood to i removed my shirt and pressed it to the spot untill she could breath again. As we were walking some one Cora knew gave us a ride back to her house. Once we got there i examined the wound closly. (i have first aide certification so i knew what i was doing) It turned out to boil down to a small cut and a nasty bruise. As soon as she was able she went and took a shower. As soon as she left i almost broke down. I had failed in my protection of her. I never delt well with failure. But it being Cora hit me hard. Amber tried to help but i had to bury my anger and sorrow as usual. By the time Cora returned i had things under control. I remember the conversation like it was yesterday. Word for word.   " Are you going to be ok Cora?" I asked   " It's just a bruise and a small cut. I'll be fine. I think they got me by my waist though to."   "As soon as you get dressed let me take a look at it."   " Why do you need to wait till i get dressed?" she opened her towel to her quite naked form. I attempted to not have my heart leap from my throat and examined the cut. I quickly told her it was of little or no concern and she re-wrapped her towel. Eventually she went and got dressed and amber and i talked and i went home.   I went back to Cora's about every day after that. I was devistated that i had failed so misserbly and i apologized incessantly. Eventually over about a week our relationship grew to small flirting and eventually a bit more. I had no problem with that. i enjoyed it actually.   Then one day it happened. Amber had gone upstairs to Cora's room for something and Cora asked if she could talk to me. She sat on the couch and i followed suit. She danced around the issue for a moment but eventually she got to it. I will never forget that moment for the rest of my days. She told me that even though she was with Julian she also loved me. I had no idea what to do. I had two choices: Stay with Amber and go that route. Or i could tell Cora about my feelings for her and go be with her. But due in no small part to the fact that i had waited three years for my chance with Amber i told her that my heart lay with Amber but i did have feelings for her. Silence stood for a long moment untill amber came down. We informed her of what was said. Eventually Cora came to a compromise: if Amber agreed i would be shared untill julian got out of jail between the two of them. Being the not stupid male that i am i agreed and so did amber. (they were dating at the time any way) So it went for a while. I still took my job seriously and came over every few days to see that she was doing well. But it became a little more than flirting. Twice we had sex. Both with out Ambers knowladge. i regret it only in one sense. I lied to Amber about it. It was some of the best i have ever experianced and i had feelings for Cora. In that i have no regrets.   But one night we went to a teen club. I couldn't please both of them by paying attention to them both. Amber went nuts and made everything difficult. But i tried to play mediator to them to no avail. The night ended ona good note but that's were things took a down ward turn...

       You know the more i think about the more i think i should have done this a long time ago. These bloggs are a very helpful things. But any way...      Here i find my self at 7am and merely a couple of hours before going in front of the college admissions board. I am nervous as hell. It seems like my wholw life has lead up to this so far and now it's all in shambles. I have all the necessary paper work with the exception of my high school transcripts. They require those but they are so horrible i think i'll take my chances with out them. I was to busy doing "other things" in high school.*laughs evily* But i will post when i get home tonight and let every one know how it turned out.   I am working ont he pic but i dont have any real good ones that aren't me in a tie or wearing preppy clothes. (it was one time damnit!) So i think i will have to have some one take my pic on the DDR machine when i am in the tourny thins weekend. I will loose but not nearly as bad as last time.(last i placed 13th out 35)   But any way things are going well. I talked to Amber last night cause she called me from a pay phone. Her father took her phone so now she has to walk down the road and pay to talk to me. I told her to just write me an email but sh just likes to hear my voice.   Meg is doing better. Her wounds are healing quickly and she gets her bandages off today.(she's verbrechen so i do not forsee any problems) I have no doubt despite what Jule did to her she wil come out for the better if only for being a little wiser.   Well folks i'll see you tonight.

        About three years ago Endy and i brought our collective minds together and came up with a name, symbol and uniform for a laser tag team. We called them the Outlaws. Our symbol was a sword with angel wings spread out behind it. Our team was eventually placed fifth in the district. We were good. Of course the most we ever had on our team was about 18, but we only had a max of 7 play at one time. The team eventually just became our little crew of friends and thugs. That's basically what we were. Thugs. We owned Aaron's neighborhood with an iron fist.   An honor code eventually formed. It was sort of unspoken but the driving force was these words: Verbrechen fur leben! In german it means Outlaws for life.Above all be true to your own. We ended up just calling ourselves the Verbrechen because it just sounded better and because there was a biker gang with a lot of wheight to throw around by the same name.   Our crew ruled the school as well. Not directly but no one messed with us. I personaly had contacts in every class in the school. However our down fall was marked by one thing in particular. When Julian was allowed to join. At first everything was great. He was our third in command just under myself and Endy. Endy and i were always fighting about who go to lead. We tried may ways to pick our leaders including voting and just outright beating the crap out of one another. But it never saw more growth than when i was in the lead. Jule said he was content to take orders but that was a long time ago when he was still decent. But when Endy gave him the lead things took a dive. I left. Endy left. Almost every one followed. The Verbrechen died when its founders left. (there were 4 founders none of which were Jule)   Now only Endy and i are true Verbrechen. Jule brandishes our name like a sword for his own perpouses. We have one other person that exemplified our beliefs and that was Meg. When Jule stabbed her he destroyed all ties he had with our once glorious collective. And that boys and girls is the story of what could have been great but was destroyed by a wanna-be Hitler.

       I think now is the time to tell you about my "little brothers."   First i will tell you about the pure one. Endymion Sheilds. Or Endy as he was know to us.   Endy is not in fact my brother by blood. We were bound by a similar honor code and a ranking system within the Verbrechen (i'll tell you about that in the next post). I am older and taller so to me he will always be my little brother. We were best freinds untill the whole Jule and Cora thing went down. We sorta drifted but were still freinds. He was the mediator most of the time. Endy was a gental soul at heart. He was a fighter same as I and Jule but his heart wasn't in it. Even when his brother Ronnie tried to stab him he couldn't bring himself to hit him. Eventually he was our Commander at one point and he is still the only man i would follow. Not really willingly but i would. Now however he lives in NC with his grandparents.  A self imposed exile because the girl he loved (first and only girl to get him laid) broke up with him. They were always fighting so it was only a matter of time truth be told. She actually threw him out of a moving car once but he still came back. Now he contemplates suicide on a regular basis but is to cowardly to either do it or get on with his life. Crule to say i know but we had honor once.   Now the fallen one. Julian Delphiki. Or just Jule. He was my mentor. The one that taught me how to fight. I think i suprised him how fast i learned and took up the skill. Pretty quickly i caught up to him though he would never admit it it. I was the only one stupid enough to try and take on Jule and Endy in a sparring match. They backed out not me. Jule was the strong one. Physically anyway. He went through women like popcorn and i found gold in his scraps. Or rather they found that a man that listens and learn is so much better than one that just wants them for cheap thrill. But that is why things went nad between us. I picked up on eo fhis girls. I'm not sure which was the first but i do know that Cora was the last. And when i seemed to steal Amber away from both of them it made him furious. But that was then. Now he's a low class street punk that thinks he's a revolutionary. He carries a pellet gun and brandishes it like a 9mm. He beats on his family, women included. And tried to stab Meg the other night. Our mutual friend Amanda still believes in him though i can't see why. He's not who i knew and with out Endy or i there to keep him in check he runs rampant. It makes me angry now that when i go back i can't touch him for fear of going back to jail.  Because he is a minor i have to let him hit me 3 times before i can defend myself. And three hits is to much with him. His honor is gone. That much i can see clearly now. He acts tough but he's only been to jail once and tries to lie abot a few more times. I've really been there. Juvy and county included and i know that if he goes to county he has a serious wake up call ahead of him/ Its a shame to because he has the potential to be a real decent human being.      Now to reply to a couple comments:   Cora you never told me you web site. I need it to go there. I only update when something is on my mnd or some thing interesting happens.      Hateamo: If that ever happens i will be suprised. You know what happens when i turn 27. It's definate now. i cant get away from it. Oh and i need the addy to your blog again/      Amber: I have been doing soe thinking and while i love you with all my heart i cannot promise fidelity while i am away. Based on my track record i have about a 90 percent chance of loosing. I leave the decision to you weather or not you still love me but i promise you i will at least try my best to stay true.      Lynne: I didn't do this to be comended or for it to be a diary. I did this because i have a serious problem with telling people what's going on inside my head. I do this so i can tell people what i can't bring my self to say. So don't give me any credit beyond that.      To any one else: Thank you for reading and keep commenting so i get some feed back. In one or two cases your advice has helped me a lot. I will try and post a current pic as soon as i figure out how so you can get a better i dea of who i am. Thanks and keep reading.      8-16-04
