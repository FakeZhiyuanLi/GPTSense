      Ok. Frusterated? Yes. Why? B/c this is like the third time I am trying to post someting on this site.   Blog. So, if you look at dictionary.com, you can see that Websters had already included a defintion for the word blog. I have only recently only heard the word blog. I can't believe it's already in the dictionary. Wonder if it will also be in printed dictionaries, or just an online one.   So, thanks to my ubergeek sis and some other friends who attend nerdrus lawschool, I am now aware of the relatively new phenom of blogging. Courtesy of Mac. I love my mac. Mac is to a PC as a Manolo Blahnik's are to Payless. That's just the way it is.   All right, going to see what happens with the "blog." It will turn out one of two ways. Either, I will continue to bore whatever readers somehow happen upon my site. This will be the result of intolerable lectures I will feel better spent in a stream of conciousness. Option 2 -- I get bored of blogging, and forget about it for a while. By the time I think I'd like to give it a go again, I have forgotten my username and password, and am SOL.   Stay tuned to see which way the cookie crumbles.

      ok, is this working???? All right, I think I may be doing it right. Is this bold. ?? I don't think bold is working. Let me look in preview. Nope. WTF. I am so glad that no one actually reads this. What a completely frusterating process. I can't figure out how to do anything on this site besides post titles of my current blog, and yes, I AM A LAW STUDENT. Whatever. F off. You would be confused to. It may be b/c it's almost 1:30 in the morning and I shopped like Paris today. Whee! Oh, woe is me, shopped myself delerious. Isn't life grand? I think it is. Shannon thinks it's better. I'll let you ask her why. Okie dokie, absolutely nothing to say, just typing b/c I have obsessive compulsive disorder and no one else is awake to talk to me. No one really is on instant messenger either, so I am sitting here giving myself arthritis b/c I had a diet coke too late and have to do something to keep busy. Some read Shakespeare, I am aimlessly blogging. What is this world coming to? I'm outie.
