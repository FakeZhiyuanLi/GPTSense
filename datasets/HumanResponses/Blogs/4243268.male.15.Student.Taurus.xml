      I deleted the "True" post because it was stupid and pointless. Which, of course, is representative of my entire blog... however, it was not as depressing as I want my blog to be.  You know what, I'm starting to feel like a stalker. Every time my phone beeps that there's a new message, my heart jumps and I flip it open as fast as I can... only to find that it's someone else. Then I get all depressed, and end up sending a message to Kat. That's really the only way we're communicating. As she is in Vegas, she can't get to her IM, or the internet. That's right, she hasn't read this.  Boy, how creeped out will SHE be.  Go read the rest of my blog starting from the bottom up.  Bye.

      Wow! North of Pittsburgh is getting POUNDED by severe thunderstorms. There's talk of a possible tornado about 25 miles northeast of where I live, and the sky has been turning all these different colors.  My camera is out of film and my dad's camera isn't working, or I would take a picture of the sky.  Fortunately, they say that the tornado is probably going to be moving northeast(if it even forms, which is unlikely... I mean come on, it's Pennsylvania), so that means no exciting stuff for me. Bummer.  Band camp ended today which is a big hooray for free time. Got my schedule and turns out that I have French 3 and Lunch with my best buddy at school which is a definate score. May God protect the French teacher... Shane(my bud) and I have been terrorizing French teachers at our school for 3 years now, but this is the first year we've been in a class together. Loads of fun, I'm sure.  I know a few more friends who are in my lunch, and some who are in some of my classes. It'll be a pretty cool year.  Alright, that's about it.  Bye.

      Today's BLOG entry is dedicated to " fake__dude."  fake_dude gave me a comment the other day on my blog. fake__dude writes:   "Hey Mate,I don't think this site is boring at all. The way you express yourself makes it very intersting to read. Keep up the postings. p.s maybe you could put a picture of Kat so we know what she looks like"    fake__dude, I thank you for your vote of confidence on my site. I express myself through writing and I'm glad someone understands me.  I do, however, want to say a bit more about why I like Kat. Ever since about 1st grade, I've always been the class clown. I'd do anything to get any sort of laughs, from dirty jokes, stupid pranks, and just being downright inconsiderate. I made friends with people like me, hence the close handful that I have today. I don't, however, have many friends at all, and I'm not saying I do. Most people, girls especially, look at me today and remember the 2nd grader that licked the trash can, the 5th grader that turned the cafeteria water green. They don't accept changes in people which is one reason I absolutely hate my school district.  The sad thing about my life, though, is people see me as a simple person that likes to get laughs, and they think because I have a large sense of humor they can say anything to me.  I know this is beginning to sound feminine, but stay with me.  To have someone that cares about you and likes you just because of what your personality is like, just because of your way of treating  them , is great. I don't much experience it at my school, and the 3 or 4 times I did, well, let's not get into those.  Kat's one of those people, and that's why I like her, because she likes me for who I am(see first post). For this reason I won't post a picture of her. She could be the funniest looking person in California and I'd still like her for who she is. Imagine a person with a personality like this. You don't need a picture.  Bye.  Also by the way I don't know who fake__dude is. He has some sort of blog account but I don't recognize the name from any of my online friends.

      So yeah, another day in the life of me. Band was good today, not that tough, except my tooth is still hurting. However I get to get it fixed tommorrow at 3:30, which means I get out of band an hour early. Score.  Nothing special happened today, so I really have no idea why I'm posting. Haven't heard anything from Kat, and I love hearing from her.  Bye.

      I'm so extremely bored that I'm going to make ANOTHER post for today. I had a very odd conversation with a buddy of mine {EA}Chris. In it I used Matt's line from one of his improv shows about the coffee and the bagel. Only the cult would understand.  I got to talk to Kat today which is awesome. She thinks all the guys at the camp are jerks(or most of them at least) and she says it's a lot of walking. This is because her classes are across the campus from where she sleeps. Pre SAT camp is one thing I wouldn't be caught dead at, but if Kat were there I'd quit anything to go(if it were only in PA).  Band tommorrow. Dandy.  This one time at Pre-SAT camp...

      So I really have nothing better to do, so I'll come back here. I think what I'm sick with(see previous entry) is a bit more than a cold. I felt terrible during band camp today so I had to(got to?) go home about an hour into it. Matchett can't be too happy about that but he let it slide.  So I've been sitting at home watching cartoons and doing random stuff.  You know, I realized something today. No matter how many friends I have from camp, people here will still hate me. No matter what. It's funny how people can't accept that someone has changed. I mean, I acted(mainly) myself at the camp, more or less like I do here, but people still hate me. Sure, I have a handful of close friends, but no girl takes two looks at me like Kat, Mary, Lindsay, Sam, and Avi did at the camp.  Ignore that last statement.  Well whatever, today was too lame to write anything of importance. If you're so bored that you're actually reading this, read the post down from here, it's way better because it is filled with depressing sentiment about what I explained in this post.  Bye.

      Why did I do this? I don't know. Perhaps it's because I'm in such a depressed state that I need to get my feelings out. I mean, friends are great, but really, what else do you need than a small machine that sits on a desk and beeps from time to time? Life's greatest companion.  But really, who's going to read this? Hahahahahahaha. Just the idea of anyone actually caring enough to read something this pointless and stupid makes me laugh. I chose a unused URL and the most boring template for my blog. Who'd want to go here?  So I'll start my first entry with why I am depressed. I went to California not too long ago for acting camp. Going in I was afraid that the people wouldn't be cool there, but they definately were. Problem is, all joking aside, I miss them like a mob informant misses his non-concrete shoes.  But one in particular - Kat. I miss her the most because in the last week or so of the three-week camp, we started a sort of sweetheart relationship kind of thing. It grew faster than any relationship I've ever had, and Kat liked me for who I was, and I liked her because she liked me for who I was. Hah, like THAT makes sense. Problem is, of course, the camp was in California. And I live in boring old Pennsylvania. Bummer.  So that more or less means that I'll never get to see Kat again, unless I come back next year. It is so depressing knowing that we'll never get to cuddle like we did during camp, with everyone pointing at us and saying "Connor and Kat!" It bites. Really. It bites REALLY hard. We still talk via cell phone and IM, but it's not the same, and any chance of a relationship has been ruined.  Aside from that, camp for band here sucks, its 7:30 to 3:30 every day, and I'm sick, and missing half a tooth on the left side of my mouth, but I still have to go. And I can't get out of it. My best bud is going to an amusement park on tuesday but I can't go. I can't even get out of it 2 hours early, let alone the whole day. It SUCKS.  Blah. I'm done for tonight. Remember folks...  DOUBLE DECKER BUS! And the chairloaf in my arm the birdy says TWEET TWEET and that's a summaray!
