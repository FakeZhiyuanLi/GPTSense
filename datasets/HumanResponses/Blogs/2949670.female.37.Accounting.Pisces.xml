      Well, we're back!  Actually had a really nice time, despite the weather!  Headed over to Camp Kanaka Friday night and slowly settled in.  I was bunked with a lady from Korea who didn't speak very much English AND 5 very rambunctious, loud, prepubescent, 10 year old girls!!!  What a weekend!  One of the girls introduced herself as soon as I walked through the bedroom door....by coming about 2" from my face and screamed "Hi" (over and over and over again)...she referred to me as "Mrs. Teddy Bear".  The other girls were a little (and I do mean "little") quieter.  But the girl that was bunked above me....was an extremely restless sleeper.  After talking about this and that until 2:00 a.m., I was allowed to go to sleep....or was I?  The next 5 hours were spent listening to her talk in her sleep and flip from one end of the bunk to the next (and I'm not exaggerating) every 5 minutes.  Needless to say, as soon as I got out of bed (at 7:15), I went to the first "leader" that I could find and asked if they had "done that" to me on purpose, to torture me?  They knew full well what those girls were like and that's why I was assigned their room......  That morning (even though I was only asked to come to be an "extra eye") I was put to work....I got to stand in front of a hot, industrial (restaurant type) stove and cook bacon for 41 people!  The amount of grease that came off that bacon was absolutely disgusting!!!!  So why does the stuff taste so good?  So I think it turned out to be 10 (extra large) packages of bacon that I fried up.  Then I helped clean up.    Despite the weather, we went for a bit of a walk...came back to set up for another "game".  All of a sudden a couple of the boys came running down the hall saying that someone had fallen and had lost 2 teeth.  Panic sets in......turns out, this boy had sure enough fallen (because they were making bridges out of the mattresses between bunk beds) and had broken his arm!!!  So once this guy got his arm set, we headed over to the hospital. His father was there to greet us and after 2 hours....well, this boys fun was over (although maybe not, cuz he was smiling when we left...maybe due to the Tylenol 3 with codeine)...he was headed for the operating room.  Went back to camp and got ready for dinner....where I got to cook the pasta for 40 people!  And then help clean up.  Considering I had no sleep the night before...I was doing okay.  The kids were spent and went to their rooms by 10:00 (the grade 5 boys stayed up until 3:00 a.m.).  Sat and chatted with the other leaders (adults) until 12:00.  The girls were much quieter (and calmer) and I think I managed 3 hours of sleep.  Could have kept sleeping....but it was time to get up and help make pancakes for everyone and then of course....help clean up!  Headed back at 10:30 a.m. and filled the van to its capacity....7 people and bags and sleeping bags and jackets and shoes and crafts.....good thing I filled up at 99.9 cents a litre!!!!!!  Teddy has now gone swimming with his buddy and I'm ready to sleep for a week!  How do these kids do it???  Should have the main computer home later this week....hope to share some pictures.  I have to veg.

      Yes, I'm PMS'ing and I'm normally pretty good about it, but for some reason this time....ugh!  I feel bloated, I'm tired, I'm cold, my boob hurts, I'm crampy AND I have to go and spend the weekend in some camp!  It just better not rain like it's been doing today, the whole time!  The boys were supposed to be tested in Tae Kwon Do (Teddy for his red-stripe and Aleks for his blue-stripe).  Well they finally got their shit together and started to actually do some studying for this test!  No, it's definitely not all physical....they actually have to know stuff!  Anyways...I can't blame Aleks, he's the younger of the two and has done remarkably well, considering the transition in schools last winter.  Teddy on the other hand, has left and always does leave everything to the last minute.  I already gave the school $170.00 to cover the test fees, but thankfully they agreed with me that the boys just weren't ready.  So.....they get to go to the test anyways, and sit on their rumps for 2 1/2 hours and "watch and learn", which means I'll be "watching and learning" as well!  After that's over (around 7:00 p.m.), I get to drop Aleks off at home and then head over to the camp (which is only Maple Ridge)....it won't really be "camping" per se, we'll be in cabins, on bunkbeds, with electricity and running water and a 7-11 only few kilometers away.  And then my weekend of supervising a bunch of prepubescent kids, eating fire roasted weinies (not likely), hiking in the rain and mud and getting zilch for sleep will begin.  I'm actually looking forward to it and can't wait to share pictures of  the weekend.  It'll be great to sit down with Teddy and have some one on one with him.  Despite what he puts me through and the nagging he gets from me......I love that kid with all of my heart!   Saw the Personal Trainer at the Gym Today   On a different note...I finally met up with a personal trainer at my gym, who has specializes in "rehab" curriculums.  I was most horrified and heartbroken to hear him say....."Firstly, I STRONGLY recommend you DO NOT continue on the Stairmaster or the Tread Mill".  "What!?!??!" I said incredulously..."the Stairmaster is my life!  I don't go on the Tread, can't stand the bike, can't swim (because of my torn ligament), can't do aerobics".  So what the hell else am I able to do.  Technically I'm not even supposed to do some of the weights that I do.....but they call out to me, they want me to sweat, they want to build my muscles!  Oh woes me....maybe if I'm lucky I'll still be able to do the Elliptical....but knowing my luck, probably not!  I meet with him for a full consultation on Tuesday, I'll let you know how it goes.

       urlLink    No, I don't have my computer (to download new pictures to) back yet.  This was one that my neighbour sent to me....it's Krystina's most prized possession!  CeeDee (Kitty)...she's been a part of the family since Krystina was 2 months old....and was even lost for 3 weeks at one point, only to be found in our local Save-On Foods!  Oh the joy when we located our "lost love".  Hello everyone!&nbsp; urlLink

      So I was up with the birds this morning....had to meet with an architect (new client) in GasTown.  Meeting went well and he passed me over to another major Accounting firm in the city, to possibly get more leads!  Stopped at Costco on my way back and spent $300.00 on groceries and then another $90.00 on flowers for my yard.  Came home, put the many bags of groceries away and then off we went to Tae Kwon Do.  Dinner and then to the gym for a brutal leg workout.  And now....I'm ready to pass out.  Tomorrow Teddy has an appointment to get his mouth "measured" and "photographed" cuz there's a possibility that he'll need braces?????  I have 4 loads of laundry staring me in the face across the room.  Aleks' infection seems to have gotten alot better and Teddy is gaining more hair in the arm pits....I mentioned that it might be a good idea to have a shower more often. "Yeah, whatever mom!"  Well my blog is a pretty boring one today...I can't even think...time to go to bed.

      I'd love to post a picture but the computer that I download pictures to is being repaired.  Something always comes up, just when you think things are going smoothly.  This weekend was especially busy, and to compliment it...it was just gorgeous - not that I got to enjoy any of the sun!  But than again, I'm still a little leary after my recent "fry session".  Saturday morning:  Got Teddy and Aleks up for Tae Kwon Do.  Aleks started to cry and say that he didn't want to go.  He said that his scar hurt.....I thought he was just making up an excuse and didn't believe him at first. Then I took a closer look....sure enough, his scar had become infected and was hot and swollen.  He complained that his cheek and neck were sore as well.  Great!  I knew what this meant.  I told him to stay in bed.  Took Teddy to Tae Kwon Doe, dropped him off and raced over to the mall to get a birthday present for my nephew (who was turning 9 on Sunday) and for my mother (who had turned 57 on Thursday).  Came back and picked Teddy up and took him home.  Checked on Aleks, he wasn't doing any better, so I did a couple of quick things, had something to eat and took him down to the medical clinic, since our family doctor was closed for the weekend.  Sure enough, he had an infection and it had already managed to run itself through to two glands in the face and neck.  Antibiotics, right away, 4 times a day.  That night (and we were aware this would happen) the scar ruptured and he started to bleed.  By the next morning, there was a lot of dried blood, but the swelling had gone down and Aleks was acting like his old self.  We went to my parents for dinner on Saturday...I have to admit, as much as I say about my mother in the negative, there is one positive thing about her...she knows how to cook!  She made a feast of lobster, salmon and mussels (with some other accompanying dishes)...the evening was civil, with only a couple of minor jabs here and there.  Sunday:  Went to church, got the kids back to Sunday school.  Raced home, wrapped my nephew's birthday present, went to the ice rink where is was being held.  Learned something new.....I cannot skate with a torn ligament!!!  Raced home, got ready for dinner at a family friends, and had a very nice time.  Monday:  Got to sleep in...yay!  Did some work and Tone finished the flooring in Krystina's room.  Whew!  I have an appointment with a new client (an architect) and have to get up for 6:30....so nighty night!  Talk to you soon.

      So as you can see from the picture below....my son is not a very humble, shy person.  A friend was chatting about letting her daughter go to the pool with her friend and her concerns over that.  Well.....today Teddy asked if he could go to the local pool to swim with his buddy.  I said sure, but I'll stick around.  He wasn't too impressed with that, but I said you either take that, or you just don't go!  So okay fine.  After Tae Kwon Do and dinner, I packed up my workout stuff and some bookkeeping work and we all headed for the pool.  Thought I'd take advantage of there being a workout room there (I could still watch the boys through the glass wall).  So anyways, after my workout...I grabbed a table and sat down to do a little bit of work while I waited for the boys.  A few kids showed up and decided to sit down and carry on a conversation behind me (or what they thought was a conversation).  Turns out that they're in grade seven...turns out one of them was on crack!  Two girls with them were dressed like tramps and had mouths like sewers.  What got me was the fact that, here I was sitting (and while I look younger then my age {perhaps you'd disagree} I don't look that young) and they had absolutely no regard, or respect for the way that they spoke.  Hey, I cuss... but hello, for a 12/13 year old to be saying "fuck this" and "fuck that" and that guys an "asshole" and that girl is a "bitch" in the presence of an adult....just blows me away!  This is the level of what society has degraded to.  So I see this 12/13 year old boy fried out of his tree on crack, these girls dressed with almost nothing on, swearing and talking about sex and how they're going to "beat up" this and that girl.  Then I walk out of the building and there's a cop car driving through the parking lot and about 30 more kids just "hanging out".  I have three children...I don't seem to worry about the middle guy (Aleks) so much.  He seems to have life figured out and seems to be very "sensible", at this point.  I looked at Krystina when I came home and saw the innocence that is a part of all toddlers and it made me sad to think that she would be exposed to the pressures that girls go through nowadays, just to fit in.  But Teddy is the one I worry about the most.    Teddy has a very good heart and caring, loving attitude towards his sister (and his brother) but he is sooooo influenced by society and that which goes on around him.  He's the kid that, given the chance....would drop school, wear the "hanging below your ass" jeans, experiament with drugs, have a girl on his shoulder at all times, drive the souped up, low riding, customized cars of today.  He'll be the one driving down Boundary Rd. racing against another car.  He'll be the one to keep me up most every night and make me worry endlessly.  We see that in him already and we're trying to curb that behavior...sometimes, it just ain't good enough!  One can only hope and pray.    Yes, I'm scared for what the future holds.

      Today I was getting ready for my workout and since I have 6 loads of laundry to fold, I had to resort to a bra that I haven't worn for a while.    Well, let me tell you....I'm not sure why I even bothered!  I tried to collect as much skin as I could to try and fill out the air pockets that I had just strung over my shoulders.  There was barely enough there to fill half the cup.  I thought well it'll just flatten out when I put on a t-shirt....not!  You could see the bra material clumping and looking as though I had stuck cotton balls at the points.  It was not a pretty sight!  When I was at my heaviest (not pregnant), I was easily a "C" cup.  Nice size but of course (and this is the case for me) bigger boobs means bigger hips!  And I had those too.  When I was nursing my babes...I was about a "D" cup...a little too big, not to mention painful.  Now...babes are growing, no more in the future (100% sure of that) and I'm barely an "A" cup!  So to that I sing....."Oh where, oh where, have my boobies gone, oh where, oh where can they be?"  Well, at least I don't have to worry about any black eyes when I'm running around!  Yuh, time to go....

      Hmmmm, well I figured out how to do the picture thing.  Of course, this is all when our main computer (where we download new pics on) has now gone in the shop....I have more to download and share, but I guess I'll haver to wait.  Anyways....this is so easy to do now, but I'm not sure how to add pictures to current posts that I'm writing in.... Baby steps, right?  You have to admit....this has got to be one of the nicest views to wake up to?!  The picture above is the view from my most favorite spot...Tofino, B.C.

      Today was a very busy day.  We got up, bright and early and set off to the dentist (for the 4th time).  Teddy was getting yet another filling.  This boy already has silver molars and now he's getting the rest of his teeth filled!  He's almost 11 years old, so there's no chance in "H.E. double sticks" that I'm going to be brushing his teeth myself.  Anyways...it was done and over with within 20 minutes.  I talked to my dad while I waited for Teddy...he went to see his probation officer.  All charges were dropped (so he will not have a criminal record) but he is on probation for the next year.  He will also need to attend A.A. (which I'm kind of glad about).  I don't think i can ever forgive my mother for this.  But he seemed to be in good spirits.  "Sigh"....I love my dad.  Did a bit of "blogging" work.  It's getting a little complicated there on the side?!  Boys came home and we got ready for TKD.  While they were in class, I took Krystina up the hill to the IGA and did some grocery shopping...I cannot believe how much we spend on groceries per month (and the boys aren't even teenagers yets!)....we're looking at $800 - $1,000 per month! OMG!  Teddy had a science project that was due like yesterday!  We asked for a days extension and he just finished working on it at 11:30 this evening.  Can we say, "you're going to be tired in the a.m."?!  Anyways, it looks good...it was a poster on the "circulatory system".  He's trying so hard to be better behaved.....I love that kid!  Teddy and Aleks will be testing for their next belt levels in a couple of weeks.  I really hope they're ready.  Aleks will be testing for his blue stripe and Teddy for his red stripe (Teddy only has his red stripe, red belt, 1st black stripe, 2nd black stripe before he becomes a full fledged "Black Belt" in TKD.  Aleks has 2 levels added to that.  There's a girl from their TKD school that's heading off to the Olympics in Athens this summer.  Can you believe it?  Talk about awesome or what.  She's a 17 year old girl that can kick anybody's butt with her 49 kg. frame.  I wish her all the best.  Well, that's really about it for today...maybe tomorrow will be a little more exciting????

      Today was my first day back to church in about a year and a half (except for one service at Easter).  We belong to a very popular, very large church in Burnaby.  Each service holds anywhere from 800 - 1,000 people.  Tony helps out once a month and was gone by 7:00 a.m.  I decided it was a good day to "get back into it" and got the kids up and ready to go....not an easy task!  After the service...which was moving (thanks to Pastor John Neufeld) I ran downstairs to pick up Sunday School registration cards for the kids.  There's no point in them just sitting there listening to stuff that they just can't comprehend.  We have such a mixed variety of people in the congretation.  There's this one guy "Chris"...he rides a harley, has long hair and a moustache/beard and swears like a sailor.  But he knows where he stands and he'll probably have an easier time getting through Heaven's pearly gates then some of the stuffier, high number tithing, stiff colored elders that go there.  My favorite part.....the singing, always has been!  Have to admit.....it was good to be back.  It's good for the soul.

      So I'm still working on my "new look", but I'm good with it.  As I mentioned (and I think I've lost some of my previous blogs....too bad) I was spending the day at my old Alma Mater yesterday to watch my son kick some ass.  I'm sorry I shouldn't refer to it that way but if you could only see him "spar" (fight).  Most moms get all stressed out about their kids going up to fight....for some reason, I feel completely comfortable with it (now anyways). I'm just so confident of my son and while anything can happen....he's still not at the point where he's allowed to do "head kicks".  So I think with that in the recess of my mind...I'm not freaking....yet!  So we got up at 6:30 Saturday morning, just me and Ted.  We got ourselves ready to go, and while I packed us some snacks and a lunch...we did do our traditional "Micky Dee's" (MacDonald's) breaky.  Teddy always gets the Bacon and Egg McMuffin, orange juice and hashbrown and I always opt for the Bacon and Egg Bagel, orange juice, hashbrown and medium coffee.....so bad for you, but so tasty for the tummy!  We headed off to Port Moody Senior Secondary (only a 15 minute right from our home) and entered an stomping ground that I hadn't visited in 19 years!!!  It was so different and yet soooo comfortable.  The lockers were still the same multi-colored beat up lockers and while I was hoping to get down to the office area (to check out my grad pic), I refamiliarized myself with the "big gym".  Believe it or not....school was one place that I enjoyed being at and I rarely skipped a class.  Trust me....I was one of those that, should you have known me back then, looked like a "frequent skipper".  Anyways.....we signed in and got ready for the tournament.  I can't tell you how much I enjoy going to these with Teddy (same goes for soccer).  Teddy finally got to do his pattern and received a bronze medal.  Could have/should have done better (but I'd never say that to him)...they don't spend a whole lot of time in this area at the TKD school - they focus more on the "sparring" side of it.  He was thoroughly not pleased with himself and quickly tucked his medal in his bag.  Later in the afternoon, Teddy was ready to go for his sparring match.  He won it 11-4....against a girl....whom he made cry.  I don't know why the officials did that....normally they don't match male against female.  Then came his second match which was against a boy from Washington.  It was much more of a challenge and they tied 6 a piece.  Unfortately they gave it to the other boy because he was just a little more agressive (it was fair though).  And Teddy walked away with a silver.  Again....he was disappointed....Teddy has been walking away with golds and has a hard time settling with anything else.  I think, it's good to be humbled!  Regardless, I'm proud of my son!  He's the hardest to handle, he's the most difficult on the nerves, he's going to be the most trouble, he's most like me.....and I love him!  with all of my heart!

      Got my first "tan" of the season.  It's on the border of "burnsville"...BUT, I was very conscious to keep the face covered!  No, I didn't walk around with an umbrella, or keep my foot long, plastic visor shielding my face....did wear my sunblock though! Krystina was slathered in sunblock....she's the fairest in the family...poor thing.  Had a really nice time at Buntzen Lake.  Krystina played in the water, we talked, we had lunch together, she discovered what it was like to "pee down your leg", I read my book "Desperation by Stephen King" (highly recommended, if you like his stories), Teddy's classmates "hit on" Krystina.  And tomorrow marks the final day of grade 1 (for Aleks) and grade 5 (for Ted).  Oh!  I almost forgot....Teddy got his first phone call from a girl, on the weekend - AND she even left a message!!  She mentioned that she "missed" him???  I'm thinking you just met this girl last night at the public pool.....what the hell does she "miss" about you???????  All of a sudden I've become very protective!  I asked him if he had kiss her??  He said no.  I asked if dad had talked to him??????  He said yes.  I reminded him that we don't "do that".  He looked at me like he was going to puke....so I knew we were still okay!

      Well it's over!  As you can see by the pictures....she looks pretty darn happy, doesn't she?  I can't believe that three years have gone by....better yet, I can't believe that almost 11 have gone by since Teddy!  The evening was pretty much what I expected it to be.  It wasn't horrible (or maybe that's just cuz I expected it and have gotten so accustomed to some of the garbage that goes on).  My parents and the first family friends arrived at 5:30.  My parents brought some food (prime rib, schnitzels and a few chicken wings oh, and some "Russian eggs" - they're quite good, very eye appealing) and Tony and I helped them bring it up.  My sister-in-law also brought some chicken wings (hers were better than my mother's).  My sister-in-law was late.....1 1/2 hours late!!!!  We finally sat down to eat at 7:15.  The table was full of food....I made the chicken braids (2) and a bunch of other stuff.  Made sure there was beer, wine (red and white), brandy, rum and vodka in the house. (Oh I also squeezed a knee x-ray today)?!?!?    Anyways....first thing she (my mother) says (as she sees my sister-in-laws chicken wings).  "Why the hell did I spend 1/2 my day in the kitchen making my chicken wings"?  Um sorry, she made 3 times as much as you and it didn't take her 1/2 the day?  But she said it with such a bitter tongue.  I just looked at her and said "It's time to eat now"!  She bitched about this and that and sure enough, she told Tony that I'm too skinny and need to be "fattened" up!  Whatever.  Then she didn't say not a single word about the newly painted, renovated, decorated, kids rooms and main bathroom....Extremely hard to miss!  Unless you're fucking blind!  After I was the last one to sit down and shovel some food in my stomach (I ended up eating with my plate on my lap, cuz there was no room).  She quickly started with her demands for me to get up and start cleaning up the dishes and put out the eggs. "You get up and starting cleaning up.  When's the last time you had 22 people in your house?!?!?!"  A good friend of mine was over as well.  She's very forthright and direct and I had a feeling that her and my mother might rub the wrong way.  It actually started out really well and I took a sigh of relief.  Then my the end of the evening.....they "scratched"!!  My mother corralled me into the bathroom (that she still hasn't commented on) and said to me, as she grabbed my arm...."that woman might be funny, but she's poison!  And you should not have her in your house."  Well I don't fucking thing so!  This is my house, not yours, mine, we're paying for it, you're the guest and right now.....I shouldn't have you in my house!  What an awful thing for her to say!  And with that....(no, I didn't actually say that to her) she got her sweater and left with my dad.  There's so much more to the story...those are just a couple of things.  But like I said, the evening actually wasn't too bad....or maybe I really have become desensitized.  I don't like my mother, I don't like the fact that I don't like her...but she makes it very difficult for anyone to like her - they've lost almost all of their friends because of my mother.  Ah well, I still have my brood and the smile on my little girls face and the excitement that she expressed all day, makes life and it's "downs" so very well worthwhile!  Tony and I finally hit the sack at 3:30 a.m.  We sat for the last hour and had another (yes, I said another) bottle of wine and chatted about the kids, the party, and love.  We head off to Buntzen Lake in the morning with Teddy's class to enjoy a day of sun, water and picnicking!  Krystina has already packed her "beach supplies".  Will post pics later.

      I might as well not sleep tonight....I have so much that I need to accomplish before Krystina's big birthday party tomorrow.  This morning, I'm sitting here enjoying my jav and writing in my blog but then it'll be time to move my sore ass (it's sore from the second round of squats and leg presses) and get this house cleaned....it's been a while, I just haven't had time and if I don't want my mother to bitch about how "her grandchildren" are living in a dust-pool, well..... anyways... I have to go to the grocery store and get a few supplies for the dinner that I'm not really making, yeah whatever....you bring whatever you like mom, doesn't mean that I really enjoy  everything  you make either!  I'm going to make a couple of chicken braids, some chicken legs (for the kids), veggies, salad, rice (jasmine), a "Babka" (an old fashion European bundt cake), some appi's - I'll have to pick up the "Swan Lake" birthday cake tomorrow morning.  I'll have 12 adults and 10 kids here......OMG!  So I gotta do that, plus decorate, plus wrap the presents that the boys got for Krystina (or maybe they can do it themselves this year). Do laundry of course!  I didn't really buy her any gifts...she got new "butterfly" curtains from Ikea and some little nic nacs to decorate her room with, but goody bags and the party itself doesn't cost $10 so, I figure...she'll get enough from everyone else.  She's getting a bike from her grandparents anyways...that's a pretty nice gift for a 3 year old.  So there you go....I managed to clean my kitchen, cupboards, fridge, oven, already.  Tony said he's going to try and come home early to help....I'm not holding my breath dear.  I'll be checking my blog during the course of the day, I can't not...I love keeping myself up to date on my friends and reading what they have to say.  So have a great day everyone!  :)

      I didn't get as much accomplished as I had hoped...I was too busy ramming into other cars!  JUST KIDDING!!!! lol  Maybe that's why my neck is sore????  Basically, I got up, did a bit of work....people can be so unnerving....one of my clients is freaking out because they received a letter from Rev. Canada regarding their GST....when they faxed me the original remittance form...I noticed that it hadn't been filled out!  Well hello, if you don't fill out the form (or give me the authority to do so) and mail it in....then yes, the government will be on your ass!!!  And then, I spoke to my father's accountant (new accountant) and it turns out that his "old" accountant never filed his 2002 income tax return!!!!  This is a woman that couldn't even file his name correctly!  Ugh, stupidity!  Anyways....then I took my father-in-law (he's 82) shopping - awwwwww, isn't that sweet? Yeah well, he's got 3 children and I'm the only one who helps him in this way!!!  He's such a sweet old man.  He calls me "Ruza" (which means "rose" in Polish)....rhymes with the way my name is "technically" supposed to be pronounced.  Came home, check out things on the computer, kids came home and then I took them to TKD.  Had dinner.....they hated the brown rice!  Oh well....  Went to the gym....did a good workout and here I am relaxing.....  We finally got the "main" computer back and were able to download some pics off the camera...including my "before" pictures....Krystina had a good laugh as Tony zoned in on my butt and any flaws there showing!  "Whatever dear....and when was the last time you were at the gym??????"  Yeah go ahead..have another slice of cheese!  On a more serious note....I was arguing with Tony the other day, can't remember what about exactly, but one of the things I had said to him was how I cringe at my mother's voice, or how even her touching me makes me shrink back.  And I said...."isn't that really sad that a daughter is saying that about her own mother"?  Don't you think it's sad?  I think it's really weird that I can't even stand my mother touching me.....  I keep thinking that other's have probably had it a whole lot worse...but I don't know, it's just the way that I feel.  Time for sleep.

      I'm so glad that today was a little bit cooler!  Okay, so I have this birthday party happening for Krystina, this Saturday.  There will be 12 adults and 10 kids in my house....can we say "psycho"?  Krystina is turning 3....and has yet to be pottie trained!  She has no interest whatsoever, but demands that she wears those ridiculously over priced "Princess Pull-Ups".    Today....she's freaking because she started to take her pull-up off, to change for the 100 millionth time today and she discovered little poo poo balls rolling inside.  Well, she's screaming for me and yelling "pee pee, pee pee" and I look at her and tell her to calm down....we'll change the darn thing.  And then........a little poo poo ball falls out and rolls on her new laminate flooring.  Well, if I've never seen a child go ballistic, I certainly did today!  In the end, we managed to change the pull-up, round up the "get away poo poo ball" and all was quiet once more!  Oh and on another note.....why do little boys have this obsession with their penis'???  I am constantly telling Aleks, "Aleks, get your hand off your penis".  He says to me, "But mom, it's standing up".  "Well yes Aleks, of course it is....because you're always holding it!".  Sheesh.  No my kids aren't bizarre, they're just "interesting".

      Sorry folks....I've been away.....no, actually I've been slaving away!  Things have calmed down just a tad and I decided to give myself a "night off".  A night where I could just "veg".  I haven't sat down and watched the tube in over 3 weeks now and decided I would watch an episode of "Friends" after everyone had gone to sleep.  It was a repeat.  So here's a lo-down of what I've been up to:  Friday:  Worked during the day, made dinner and then raced off to my neighbor's daughters' dance recital.  It was really nice to watch and be with them, until I saw one of the performers.  She was a girl of no more than 8 years of age.  When I saw her....my heart ached.  She was nothing more than skin and bones - trust me, there's a difference between being "skinny" and being "anorexic" and she was definitely "anorexic"!  I was once bulemic (in my teens) but I've read and seen horror stories on anorexia nervosa and for a child (girl) of such a young age to have this disorder....well, it makes me angry that society, media, etc. etc. has done this to so many of our youngsters.  Anyways....kind of put a damper on the evening.....I will always remember that little girl and will always hope that she gets well.  Saturday:  Well......let me tell you about Saturday!!!  It was a day like no other!  First of all, I'm already tired cuz I went back to work when I came home from the recital.  The kids were taking their time and they had to be at TKD at 10:00 (it was now 9:40).  I parked the van (the newest vehicle I've ever owned), my 2002 Dodge Grand Caravan Sport, in Onyx, in the garage to keep it cooler and because I figured....we have a garage, why not use it!  Unfortunately the garage door is rather narrow and I have to be very careful not to take off my side-view mirrors as I go in and out.  So anyways.....I'm rushing the kids, we're all loaded up and I start backing up the van.  Okay, we're doing alright, we got the mirrors through, so I step on the gas....I always do this, could almost do it blindfolded.  Then...... BAM! .  My fricken coffee spills all over the carpet (a full mug, of course), the kids gasp and I do anything not to yell out "FUCK"!  I knew exactly what I had done.  You see the night before, when I went to the dance recital, I took Tony's company truck. When I came home, I parked it just a little ways away from the edge of the drive way....too far away from the edge.  Cuz I just rammed the rear end of my beautiful "taxi" into my husband's company pick up!!!  "Oh shit", I say under my breath!  I get out....walk around and check out the damage.....not good!  I run inside and tell the husband....he just glares.  I leave...for my own good.  Well the damage is pretty severe....well over $1,000 for the truck and well over $2,000 for the van!  Thankfully I have "Roadstar" and haven't had an accident or done anything this stuuuuuuupid in the 20 years that I've been driving....so I'm okay, insurance wise...just have to pay the $500 deductible!  Which I don't have right now.  The worst part..........my neighbour was outside and saw the whole thing!  All he said was "Ouch".  The insurance adjuster thought it was pretty funny.....especially when she asked "on what street did this happen?" and I replied "um....in my driveway".  Oh well....live and learn.  It's only a material possession.  Then....I'm supposed to go for an x-ray on my right knee....the requisition form says they're open from 10 - 2.  Great...plenty of time...I live home at 12:40, get there at 12:58.  "Oh, I'm sorry....we're done for the day".  "But the form says 10 - 2?"  "Oh that's our old hours....it's been 9 - 1 for a year now"  Ugh!  Went to the gym to work off my frustrations...came home and worked until 2:30 in the a.m.  Sunday:  Did the church thing, did the lunch at the parents thing, came home and went back to work until 2:30 in the a.m.  Ran out of ink and paper at 2:00...freaked, went to bed.  Monday:  Raced to Staples, got my ink and paper.  Came back home to finish printing off financial statements.  Couriered them out at noon, went to the gym, came home, took the kids to TKD, made dinner in sweltering heat, folded laundry.....went numb.  And here I am once more.....semi-sane, relaxed and ready to go to sleep.

We did 2, count them 2, leg exercises....one was the proper squat using a tension band and one was a lying, leg press (both legs and one leg at a time).  It pains me to even sit on the flipping toilet!!!!  And I thought I worked out before???????  Ouch!  I need an icepack!

      I've been sitting here looking at numbers for the last 4 1/2 hours.  Everything is going smoothly and I suspect that I'll be able to make my Thursday evening deadline!  If I don't....you can contact me at the local "loony bin".  It's been one of those days....but I did manage to enjoy a bit of it when I dropped the boys off for Tae Kwon Do and Krystina and I walked up to the Starbucks in Port Moody.  I bought myself a couple of really cute mugs (they're pink and green with little flowers on them) and Krystina and I sat and had our coffee and apple juice with a lollipop and biscotti enjoying the warmth of the sunshine and the screams of vengeance from the cars and motorcycles whizzing past us!  Tomorrow, it's an easy rise and then an appointment with my trainer at the gym.  I'm still sore in the arms and chest from my workout yesterday!  I've lost a pound....so now I'm down to 124 lbs!  That's less then I weighed when I got married, 12 years ago!  But it's just water and I know where it's coming from!  Anyways...I'm beat and I'm really hoping that I won't have to sleep on the couch again tonight!?!?   Oh, I didn't tell you.....I went to bed last night, only to find my husband snoring like a fricken chainsaw. I gently prodded, then I shoved him, then I turned his head, then I covered his mouth and nose and finally I kicked him!!!  but to no avail!  I had finally had enough and moved into the living room, taking the top quilt cover thingy with me.  It was cold on the couch last night....and I think it was about 3:00 a.m. before I finally crashed, only to be awoken again at 6:30 when the fucking alarm clock is blasting music in our bedroom, but hubby's already gone!  You'd think he could have at least turned it off!!!!!  Ah well....time to saw the logs.

      My oldest son is heading off to Middle School for the first time tomorrow.  This is the "welcome to your new school" preview day.   I have to say that it saddens me a bit.  It seems not so long ago that I was waddling around, carrying an extra 52 lbs. on me, waiting for my first child to be born. And now....he's heading off to teen-hood. It scares me too....because of how society is nowadays - oh don't get me wrong, I don't worry about him being bullied, not even that he would be the bully, but I do worry about his attraction to teens, the peer-pressure that he'll have to deal with (and he will cave), his love for fast cars and his already too great knowledge of drugs and paraphenelia!  Why does time have to go so fast?  I looked at my youngest today....and she's no longer "that young" either - she'll be celebrating her 3rd birthday in 2 weeks.  I had 2 more in between and I feel as though I haven't even enjoyed them to the fullest!  Will time ever slow down?  I guess it will....when I'm old, when the kids are gone, when my garden is filled with beautiful flowers and fresh vegetables ready for the picking.  Until then....I watch and I cherish every moment I have with them and when the time is right....I let them leave the nest.  Good luck Teddy!

       Due to a power outage, only one paramedic responded to the call. The house was very, very dark, so the paramedic asked Katelyn, a 3-year-old girl, to hold a flashlight high over her mommy so he could see while he helped deliver the baby. Very diligently, Katelyn did as she was asked. Heidi pushed and pushed, and after a little while, Connor was born.  The paramedic lifted him by his little feet and spanked him on his bottom. Connor began to cry. The paramedic then thanked Katelyn for her help and asked the wide-eyed 3-year old what she thought about what she had just witnessed.  Katelyn quickly responded, "He shouldn't have crawled in there in the first place, smack his ass again!" :)

      The other day I saw a man vacumming (yes you heard me right) his driveway.....with an "upright"!  There's this woman who drives up and down our street, honking her horn the whole way....maybe it wouldn't be so strange, if our street wasn't as quiet as it is - we probably get 30 cars drive by in total, per day!  There's a woman at the gym who wears a "parka" when she works out....no joke!  Even in warm weather!  I once saw a woman, dressed very "office like", very intellectually on a very busy street in Vancouver hoarking on the sidewalk....just like a man!  This isn't strange....but it's really gross....the other morning Tony went downstairs to the laundry room, in his bare feet and then stepped on something that felt like a small, plastic bag that was sealed and had some air in it.  The "item" went "pfoof" and when Tony looked down, he noticed it was a slug that had crawled in and it's guts propelled out both ends when he stepped on it.  Ugh!!!!!!!!!!  I once sent to grab the garbage bag that was in the can outside and stuck my finger right through a slug!!!  I still get shivers thinking about it.....it took me an hour to get the sliminess and goo off my finger!  :)

      Oh one quick comment.  Met with the trainer at the gym today....it was awesome!  He took all my measurements etc.  Turns out (and I could already tell) that one thigh is 1/2" smaller than the other.....I had surgery on the smaller one 20 years ago and have overcompensated for that leg over the years.  Now I end up like the old pirate guy....with one skinny wooden leg (not that mine is wooden)....k, I'm not being very funny right now.....time to hit the sack!  Ciao.

      Well, I'm all set and so totally excited about starting this new "training program"!  My appointment is at 1:00 today, but I'm going to head down at 12:15 (so that I can pay up).  Chris (the trainer) promised me that he would work me hard over the next few weeks.....I have a picture from a Muscle and Fitness magazine that I'm using as my constant "motivation" tool!  Tony took some "before" shots of me in a bikini....you'll have to wait until "after" to view.....sorry.  He seemed to "enjoy" taking the pics.....lol!  I told him to wait a few weeks and then tell me what he thinks!  We got a "La Vie en Rose" flyer in the mail the other day....they had these most awesome bathing suits (bottoms are like short shorts)....that's where I'm headed, if I pull this off!  So anyways.....I best get myself going here....I'll post later and let you know how it went.

      So, I'm reading (when I can) a new book, titled "Desperation" by Stephen King (a friend recommended this to me)....if you like King's style of writing....it's a damn awesome book!  Took Teddy to TKD (Tae Kwon Do) today....he did great!  I had a couple of ladies come up to me and say, "man, Teddy's really awesome to watch fight"!    Aleks spent the night at Grandma and Grandpa's....that's fine...he seems to get along with the "old lady"....ohhhhh, that's so mean!  Let me rephrase that....he gets along with his Grandmother! and that made her, him and Grandpa happy....and the added bonus was, that it was just a little quieter at home too.  But I missed him! His scar is not healing....I think we may need another trip to the doc's....it's getting red again and there's a flap of skin that just won't close....yuck!  Krystina sat on the potty for the first time today!!!  Yay!  She didn't do anything...but that doesn't matter.  It's a HUGE stepping stone that she just say on the damn throne!!!  Well, it's 1:20 a.m.....and I really need to go to sleep.  Night.

      1. Who are you? 2. Have we ever met? 3. Give me a nickname and explain why you picked it. 4. Describe me in one word. 5. What reminds you of me? 6. If you could give me anything, what would it be? 7. Ever wanted to tell me something but couldn’t? 8. Are you going to put this on your weblog and see what I say about you? 9. What do you love like a fat kid loves cake? 10. What makes you come back here?

      There's nothing I can't stand more then when I drive into a parking lot where there are handicapped spots and some fricken moron decides he/she has "reserved" that spot for themselves....even though they're as healthy as a horse!  I total empathize with those that might have a heart condition or something like that.  But when you park yourself in front of a liquor store and can haul in/out 3 cases of empties/beers without any difficulty.....well sorry, I think the only thing that might be handicapped is your fricken brain!  I don't know, maybe I'm being too harsh...but I've just seen this so many times before and you know what?  I have two bad knees and a muscle that was torn off a bone in my butt/hip and I can make the distance!  My father-in-law, who's 82 can walk farther then some of these moronic imbeciles! And he's usually carrying a 40 pounder of Vodka, a half sack of beer and a micky of Brandy.  Ugh, it just gets me!  Leave the spots for the needy...please!

      So I met with   my   "personal trainer" tonight.  It was actually a very good meet....and Cindy, you were right all along....it was a very good idea to get someone who has experience with injuries etc.  His name is Chris and apparently knee injuries/rehab are his specialty.  We hit it off pretty good, I told him what I wanted out of the training and he told me what he was able to give me.  So now.....I just have to cough up some cashola!  It makes my stomach a little uneasy to think of how much this is going to cost me, but in the end..... #1:  I'm worth it.  #2:  My knees are worth it. and #3:  Doggone it, I'm going to look damn hot when I'm done!!!  Chris has already told me that he's going to push me hard and that I will definitely see results in an overall body revamping AND I will get what I need to strengthen my poor, damaged, older than my age knees!  I'm so looking forward to it.  I've already signed up for the "Easy Zone" diet thingy at the gym...I should really take a look at that again, a little more seriously.  They say that while you're in your 30's you can still push your body just as hard as you did in your teens or 20's....I'm 37 and I'm going to give it a push it will never forget.  I will give it one last hurrah!  I am going to make my hubby (and my kids) proud to call me their mama!  I should take a before and after picture.....just to show myself, what I've accomplished!  Again....I don't need to mention your name...but you know who you are and you know it's because of you that I'm so motivated! I'm the type that needs constant motivation.....well I have it three fold now.  I'll keep everyone up to date on how things progress.  Oh and yes....as I suspected, the Elliptical is the machine of choice for me, as well as the bike and spinning.  I've never tried spinning, is it really a good workout?

       So I managed to get the house in decent shape.  The laundry was all folded and put away, I had my cup of coffee and was ready to head out and pick up Teddy.  (Tony had already gone ahead with Krystina and Aleks to enjoy some time at Spanish Banks and check out the "really low tide".      So I get to the Harbour boat launch at Stanley Park.  Maria and her family were already there but there was no boat in sight (well, at least not the one we were looking for).  We chatted for a few minutes laughing about the boys and things were going to be as soon as they were back, when the boat finally showed up.      I walked down to the dock and stared up at the kids waving their hello's to family and friends.  Teddy was no-where to be seen....but I wasn't surprised.  Then I noticed that there were about 6 boys on dock with "Mohawks"...yes, you heard me right.  Some were longer and spiked, some were short and coloured but they were all very fresh...so I knew that they didn't have them when they left Vancouver just over a week ago.  My stomach turned....      If you know Teddy at all....this would be straight up his alley and I held my breath trying to convince myself that it was not a big deal...the hair would grow back, the colour would fade. I could always shave off the "spiky" part of it....but we had to go to the Grandparents tomorrow for dinner....my mother was going to give me an earful!  And then I'd have to listen to what kind of a "bad parent" I was....again!  Then I saw him......      And I almost started to cry.....his hair was "normal"!!!  If anything, he  needs  a haircut!  I can't tell you what a sight for sore eyes he was....and his hair was intact!!!! Did I mention that?      He came off that boat and I kissed him and hugged him and told him how much I missed him.  He's sporting an even darker tan then when he left and his hair has been "naturally" lightened by the sun and his blue eyes.....look even bluer!  I'm biased but.....damn, he's a good looking kid!      We got our stuff together and headed to the van to make the trip over to Spanish Banks to meet up with dad and the kids.  We caught up on news, he thanked me for the letters, he said he was excited to "meet the cat", he was tired and very glad to be home.  He said he had a great time but became "homesick" by the time Thursday came around.  He's still "Teddy" but he's somehow "changed"....in a good way.  He's "grown up" a bit....but he'll always be "my baby"!      Oh and I sent him away with 3 towels.....came back with 1....haven't figured out if anything else went missing....but at least he came back in one piece!

We're (the whole family) going to spend the day at Spanish Banks.....can't wait to see him!      I must get "prettied" up (like he'll care).  Oh I must be nuts....it's only been a week geesh!

        1. Who always puts a smile on your face?  - my kids of course.    2. What was your most memorable first date?  - well there were two....one was a blind date....and I vowed never ever to go on another one again!&nbsp; But the real "memorable" one had to be with my "now hubby".&nbsp; He took me to dinner and then to see the Rolling Stones (Steel Wheels Tour) back in 1989, paid $150.00 per ticket, drove me in his 1966 Ford Fairlaine (beaut of a car) and at the end of the night......gave me a box full of a dozen, long stemmed, red roses (I still have them) and a kiss on my left cheek.&nbsp; Wait till you hear how he proposed.........    3. Where did you first feel bliss? &nbsp; - in "his" company (hubby's).    4. When did you realize that life really isn't fair, nor does it have to be?  - when I lost my second baby.    5. Why are so many people angry?  - they haven't seen how most of the world lives.    6. How do you make the world a better place?  - the question is....can you?

       So I had my meeting today, which ended up being a 3 hour affair.&nbsp; But it turned out way better than I had thought and we even shared some chuckles amongst ourselves.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Unfortunately, I also walked out of there with a bigger pile of work to finish.&nbsp; I'm feeling&nbsp; a little overwhelmed and anxious....not because I don't think I can do it, cuz I know I can -&nbsp; it's just that I already have so much on my plate and I'm trying really hard to make the summer "semi-fun" for the kids.&nbsp; I know come September and yuckier weather....things'll be different.    &nbsp;  When I look at what I've got....it's seriously a full-time job (which I love) and I'm trying to stretch myself to be 100% available for the kids.&nbsp; I'm starting to feel a little "worn" and I think my emotions are being affected too...just because I'm finding that I'm choking up for the silliest of things.&nbsp; My only "time to myself" is when I workout and/or when I blog.&nbsp; And yes, I did go for a workout today....I really didn't want to go, but I did and I feel that much better for it.    &nbsp;  Tony and I had to do Teddy's paper route for him today....so as I was BBQ'ing dinner and Tony walked in the door, I reminded him that they needed to be "put together".&nbsp; He says...."I'd really rather just sit down and veg".&nbsp; I looked at him and said, "yup, so would I".&nbsp; He says..."my day went non-stop".&nbsp; I looked at him and said, "yup, so did mine".&nbsp; He got the hint and while I finished up a dinner of one of his favorites (curried rice with chicken) (the BBQ was for the kids), he put the papers together and we delivered them "together" after dinner.    &nbsp;  Anyways...I'm not complaining, hey I'm building my own business.&nbsp; A year and a half ago I was worried that I wouldn't make enough money doing this, and now.....I think I've done pretty good for myself.&nbsp; Krystina's in school in 2 years and if I can just hold it together until then....I'm laughing!&nbsp; People would kill to make what I do, while working at home, in their pajamas!    &nbsp;  Plus.....I'm really missing my "big boy".&nbsp;     &nbsp;  I have another meeting at 9:30 in the a.m., then off to my father-in-law's to take him shopping and then I think I'll take the kids to the water park before I settle down for more work and a workout.&nbsp; So.....I'm signing out.

        Description of Your First Name of: Lujza      &nbsp;   Although the name Lujza creates the urge to be both logical and technical, we emphasize that it limits self-expression and friendly congeniality with a moody disposition. This name, when combined with the last name, can frustrate happiness, contentment, and success, as well as cause health weaknesses in the elimination system, heart, lungs and bronchial area.     Your name of Lujza has created a practical, patient, scientific nature able to concentrate on the finer details of a project or undertaking. You would function best in settled conditions where you are not called upon to meet and mix too closely with others, but are able to work on your own. This name restricts congenial expression and association, creating much aloneness .   Hmmmmm....thanks  urlLink Cindy .

       Okay seriously, why the heck don't people pick up the crap that their dogs leave behind????    &nbsp;  I was at the park this morning with the kids and since it was so nice and warm, Krystina decided to take off her shoes and run around....who can blame her right?    &nbsp;  So we've spent pretty much most of the morning there and just as we're ready to leave, she starts freaking out.&nbsp; I look at her to see what the heck is going on and sure enough...she has crap all over her foot and leg!!!    &nbsp;  It was so much fun wiping off the dog dung and then giving her a bath in the middle of the day.&nbsp; She can't stand having a bath at the end of the day much less in the midde!    &nbsp;  Well, I've done a bit of work today and am ready to meet with the accountant and our client tomorrow afternoon.&nbsp; Did I mention how much I hate these kinds of meetings??????&nbsp; Ah well, it'll be over soon enough....I hope.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  I've managed to ship Aleks off to a friends (so he doesn't have to sit in the reception area for an hour to hour and a half) and Krystina is going next door to play with the girls, which means....I get to drive in peace with the tunes cranked!    &nbsp;  I think I'm actually going to go and rot for a bit in front of the tube.....long time since I've done that.    &nbsp;  I still have a lot of stuff to do with my blog, ie. add a bunch of links and "new reads", but I can leave it for a day or two....you guys don't mind, do you?    &nbsp;  Oh and did I mention that I got another client today?&nbsp; That'll bring me up to 14!!!&nbsp; I'm going to need to hire an assistant pretty soon!!!! Apparently it's an engineer and his wife (and she's got 3 small proprietorships) - not a hard account, but will definitely need some organizing.&nbsp; Hey, I'm up for a challenge....plus you gotta like the cashola....it always helps.

       So we took little Rocky to the vet today.&nbsp; Here, when you buy a pet through the SPCA you get a free vet check if you do it within 3 days after purchase.&nbsp; Anyways, it was good timing because our little feline friend was definitely not feeling too great.&nbsp; He'd been coughing a little since we brought him home and today....he was just not himself.&nbsp; Slept and slept and slept, threw up a couple of times and just was not in the mood for anything.    &nbsp;  He got his look over and everything was fine except that the Dr. could hear a bit of raspiness in his throat/chest.&nbsp; So out come the antibiotics.&nbsp; Plus he had a fever (I had to witness the little guy get a thermometer stuck up his ass..."meoooooow"!) and was already getting dehydrated (they injected some fluids under his skin to "rehydrate" him).    &nbsp;  Well he threw up a couple more times and it was a comical sight to give a cat antibiotics....but I see just a little bit of "perkiness" coming back....is that a good&nbsp;thing?    &nbsp;  But the most important thing......no fleas!   &nbsp;

       Okay, now you gotta picture this.&nbsp; It's kind of sad but really, if you think about it, it's pretty funny!    &nbsp;  Yesterday...I was busily working in my gardening, getting rid of all of those pesky weeds.&nbsp; I think Krystina was inside throwing a temper tantrum and Aleks was riding around on this electrical scooter thingy that he and Teddy got from my parents.    &nbsp;  So anyways....I'm digging away and he's whizzing by me, around the pond, back up again, over and over.&nbsp; Well this one time...."at band camp" (kidding), I decided to look up for whatever reason and look at him.&nbsp; I basically watched this kid speed by me, little skinny body bumping down the little hill, over the wire flower bed fence, into bark mulch, over a plant and straight into the wooden fence.&nbsp; I mean straight into it!&nbsp; And then it was over.....    &nbsp;  He ended up on his side, scooter dead silent and blood curdling screams coming out of his skinny little lungs.&nbsp; He just scraped his knee is all but blood was definitely coming out.&nbsp; It took all that I had to keep from bursting out in laughter and all I could say to him was, "What the heck are you doing....your fruitcake?&nbsp; Where the heck did you get your license to ride that thing?".    &nbsp;  He was back on it today....so no worries.&nbsp; He may be skinny, but if you've ever seen him compete against a boy double his weight in Tae Kwon Do..."you can knock him down but you can't knock him out!"

       Take a look at the time....in reality where should I be right now?&nbsp; In bed!&nbsp; Where else?&nbsp; I have to get up for 8:00 and I'm still sitting here staring at my computer screen.&nbsp; I did a bit of work tonight but all I can think about is working on my blog....ugh, I need a good couple of days to myself to learn things.&nbsp; Thanks for your advice Cindy in referring me to the HTML Goodies site.    &nbsp;  Have you ever been so intently doing something, ie. staring at your computer screen, when all of a sudden something makes a noise and it scares the crapola out of you?&nbsp; I'm sitting reading about "unzipping" files and all of a sudden the VCR decides to go into "rewind".&nbsp; No one else is up...not even the cat.&nbsp; And all of a sudden things are happening in this house.&nbsp; It's like an episode out of "Poltergeist"!    &nbsp;  I miss Teddy.&nbsp; I've written to him 3 times already......yeah, I know...."give my head a shake".    &nbsp;  I have to meet with an accountant on Wednesday (he's cool) and one of my (his) clients.&nbsp; It's the biggest client I have....I'm actually pretty nervous.&nbsp; It's to go over the year-end file that I just completed for them and I'm just hoping that everything looks okay.&nbsp; I don't know why...but I've never like sitting in on meetings.&nbsp; Oh well...it's a time to "dress up" anyways....it's been a while since I've worn "office attire".&nbsp; I just hope that the temperature here doesn't spike again.    &nbsp;  I take the cat to the vet for our "free vet check" compliments of the SPCA.&nbsp; I'm gonna stuff that little furball into it's box and get it a good "once over".&nbsp; Actually he's making a funny coughing sound and I don't know if it's "furballs" or if it might have that common feline virus in the respiratory system.&nbsp; I don't know much about cats....I've always had dogs.&nbsp; Well no, that's not true....I had a kitten once...it was a tiny little thing and one day my sister opened the front door and the fluffball ran out, got attacked by a Siberian Husky and had it's guts ripped apart.&nbsp; Then I had another one....but I had to give it&nbsp;away cuz the house where the other kitten got chewed up at, was sold and so my sister (who let my first cat out and gave her her death sentence) gave this cat to her friend who...ended up keeping her for 18 years until she dropped dead from old age.&nbsp; At least this one is pooping very nicely in it's litter box....I had to clean it out today....you gotta love technology and how you can go in with your scooper and scoop up clumps of poop and peep and you don't have to dump the whole box of that gravel stuff out.    &nbsp;  Did I mention that I once had a bird?&nbsp; Yeah, it was just a little yellow budgie....one day I noticed that it had something growing on its beak.&nbsp; I took it to the vet...I was told that it can a cancerous growth on its beak and the best thing to do was to "put it to sleep".&nbsp; I cried, but I told the vet that I had to take it home for a few more days so that I could say my goodbyes.&nbsp; I came home the next day and my dad told me that "Buddy" was gone.&nbsp; Rather than spending $35 on "euthanizing" a bird....he sprayed it with air freshener and killed it.    &nbsp;  Oh and did I tell you I had a dog once....oh never mind, we'll leave that one alone.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       If you had your choice between this and that, what would you do?    &nbsp;  1. Skipping and Running -  running! skipping is harsher on the "chest".    2. Coke or Pepsi -  I'm not a "pop" person, but if I had to choose...Coke.    3. Rock or Hip Hop -  either....depends on the "mood of the moment".    4. Laptop or Desktop -  I have grown to love my laptop....so laptop.    5. Cold Weather or Hot Weather -  hot...most definitely.    6. Swimming or Bicycling -  swimming....sheesh, I'm a Pisces!    7. Chocolate or Vanilla -  Vanilla, by far!&nbsp; Especially "Mum's" natural vanilla.    8. Day or Night -  either...I'm just glad to be alive to enjoy either.    9. Looks or Brains -  looks will fade....brains.    10. Cable, DSL, or Dial-Up -  do you have to ask????

        1.&nbsp; What is your favorite mode of transportation when traveling? -  by foot (or car)....I don't fly.&nbsp; You'd have to drug me, drown me with alcohol, tape me up, handcuff me and carry me on in a panic attack (and I'd still be sober....by the way).    &nbsp;   2.&nbsp; If you had the means to travel anywhere in the world, where would you go?  - if it wasn't so scary....I'd love to go to Jerusalem, the Bahamas would do me just fine too though.    &nbsp;   3.&nbsp; Have you ever been to another country?  - course!&nbsp; I didn't say I NEVER flew....I was born overseas (Czechoslovakia), I've been back.&nbsp; I've been to Hawaii, Mexico, California, Vegas (and yes....i know that Hawaii, California and Vegas are not "countries"....you get the drift?).    &nbsp;   4.&nbsp; If time were not an issue, how long would could you stand to beaway from home?  - if kids weren't the issue.....how long are you allowed to be away from your country?    &nbsp;   5.&nbsp; What is the funnest or most interesting trip you've taken?  - The time we went to Hawaii with my mom and dad......never again!

       urlLink    Okay, so I got rid one kid today.....sent him off to camp for a week.  And this is what I came home with!  I wanted an orange one....but this little guy (he's 6 months old) caught the apple of my husband's eye.  And so...."Rocky" has now been adopted by this psychotic family!  He was given up by a family in Surrey to the SPCA.  He sure is an affectionate one and he's already rid of his "ya ya's".  Plus it helps that he's housebroken too!&nbsp; urlLink

      Today I took a chance.  Today I met someone who I've grown to like very much.  Today I met someone I've never met and yet we share so many similarities.  Today I met  urlLink Cindy .  It was actually a fluke that I was going to be free.  She contacted me late last night and mentioned she was going to be in the neighbourhood....did I maybe want to meet up?  I had a deadline to meet, but it had to be dealt with as of last night, so.....I said sure!  As soon as I saw her beautiful daughter Ashley, I knew I had found Cindy.  I was a little nervous, because this isn't something that I would normally do.  I'm a very shy person.....at first.  But I felt totally comfortable with Cindy, right away.  We headed over to DeDutch Panekoek (sp?) and had lunch.  The boys were being turkey's for the first little while, but then warmed up and became their usual nutty selves.  Krystina....hasn't stopped talking about Ashley all night (well now she has, only cuz she's in bed!).  She's taken quite a liking for her.  Cindy suggested we go to a park and after a quick errand headed over to Lyons Park and continued to get to know each other and let the kids play.  By the end....they seemed like they knew each other for quite a while.  Before I knew it, it was 5:30....I couldn't believe it....time had really flown.  But you know what?  I wouldn't have wanted to spend the afternoon any other way.  And I really do hope that we get together again and again and again.  Thanks Cindy and Ashley!

         1. Do you prefer the beach or a pool?    Most definitely the beach....but I'll go to either.   2. What kind of tan are you most likely to get during the summer... a beautiful, bronze, laying out in the sun for hours tan; a gradual, few minutes a day tan; a "farmer tan" from working outdoors; or do you just get as red as a lobster and peel the next day?  &nbsp;  I've always been pretty good at tanning.....so I'd have to say the bronze type....now just to find the time.     3. Which summertime water activity are you more likely to enjoy the most... boating, jet skiing, waterskiing, swimming or floating down a lazy river on a tube?  &nbsp;  Can't waterski (knees), I've never jet skiied but would definitely love doing it.....I love speed!     4. What is your favorite picnic food?  &nbsp;  Okay, you're asking someone who loves food in general!&nbsp; I would say...some good chicken, nice fresh salad, a fresh bun, ice tea (oh heck...make mine a Long Island) and a nice blueberry pie!     5. Do you know how to cook on a barbeque grill?  &nbsp;  Course!&nbsp; Don't you?&nbsp; lol   &nbsp;  I've been so super dee duper busy....things should calm down a bit now....hence the questionaires!    &nbsp;  Night!

       Who the heck invented "heels" and why do we (women....well, come to think of it, some men too) shove our beautifully painted toes into these things?     &nbsp;   Yesterday, Tony and I went to a wedding at a gorgeous golf and country club.&nbsp; It was an outdoor wedding....I am still thankful that the wedding was at 10:30 in the morning rather than at 1:00 or 2:00 in the afternoon - it was an absolute scorcher of a day here!&nbsp; And I am also thankful that the ceremony was only 20 minutes long!&nbsp; Have you ever tried to stand in heels, on "golf course" grass for that long?&nbsp; Yes, people were expected to stand through the ceremony, there was only a handful of chairs set out.&nbsp; I thought having not worn heels in months (maybe even a year or so) and having 2 bad knees gave me no excuse to need to sit.&nbsp; I am of course, only 37!     &nbsp;   So they are this gorgeous, elegant heel.&nbsp; They are a pale grey in colour, a slingback type with about a 2 - 2 1/2" heel (I guess....they're average....not slutty high or anything) and a very pointy front - well not "really" pointy (Tony didn't call them "nose pickers").&nbsp; And I have barely worn in heels since I've had Krystina and more recently since I bunged up my knees.&nbsp; And I'm merrily walking in these shoes, trying to look really elegant in them, trying not to let on that my fricken toes are squashed and bent and screaming, "let me out, let me out".&nbsp; Tony was complaining about his new "Aldo" shoes...he said that they were rubbing on his heel, he said that the "flat, soft leathered, fully closed" shoe was "hurting" his foot.&nbsp; I just glared and pointed down at my toes.     &nbsp;   The wedding came to an end at 3:00 p.m..&nbsp; I found some new energy in these aching feet as we left the reception and as soon as my ass was in the truck.....those gorgeous shoes were off my aching feet, not to return for another few months or so....until I can once again, write a post about my aching feet.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   To conclude......my tootsies looked damn good though!&nbsp; And well....sometimes, if you wanna look good, you gotta suffer a bit.     &nbsp;   We're off to a friends "house warming" party today....and you can bet your bottom dollar I'm not wearing "those" shoes!     &nbsp;   Stay cool everyone.

       This is actually pretty funny....my parents were having hardwood floors put in...this of course, was because of the demands of my mother.&nbsp; There was absolutely nothing wrong with the floors that they already had.&nbsp; Nobody fell through them, they weren't covered in green shag and they were actually quite pleasing to the eye - but noooooooo, she had to have hardwood floors put in.&nbsp; She just had to "top" our laminate floors with something better.    &nbsp;  Anyways.......the idiot that was installing the floor, that gave them such "a deal" ended up screwing them pretty bad.&nbsp; He was misleading in the total cost of materials, would show up "whenever", would leave without saying a word....just left, wouldn't show up at all.&nbsp; To boot, my parents asked him if it would be better to paint the walls before the floor went in, or after.&nbsp; He said before was just fine.&nbsp; So they spent hours and hours and hours painting the walls in a beautiful darkish brown, Benjamin Moore shade.&nbsp; And now......they have like 20 - 25 holes in the freshly painted walls.&nbsp; Not just little pin holes....we're talking golf ball size holes!&nbsp; AND......their brand new "black" furniture.....has holes in it too (around 6 - 8).&nbsp; This was all because of the carelessness of the installer and the tool that he was using.&nbsp; Although looking at the damage, you'd think it had been done on purpose.    &nbsp;  So anyways........they fired him!&nbsp; And now, they're stuck with all the damage.&nbsp; My dad found a place that would be able to repair the furniture.&nbsp; So Tony was asked to come up and take the armoire and dresser in his 2000 Ford Ranger pickup (hardly a "moving" vehicle).&nbsp;     &nbsp;  So they get the furniture in the back, have it strapped in snug (my mom even checks it out and gives it the okay).&nbsp; Tony pulls away and drives to the repair shop, passes by Coquitlam Centre (a major shopping mall here), drives by the bus depot and under the railroad overpass and then KABOOM!&nbsp; He loses the dresser on the highway!&nbsp; Nobody stops to help him.&nbsp; Cars go zipping by driving over splinters of wood, thudding over broken legs from the dresser.&nbsp; Tony risks life and limb to pick up the one major piece that he can sort of save.&nbsp; It's heavier then stink but somehow manages to get it in the back of the pick up.    &nbsp;  He manages to take it to the shop and is told....sorry, there's not much we can do, it'd be cheaper just to go and buy a new one.    &nbsp;  This is all because "she" had to have new floors.  &nbsp;

      The wind started to gust pretty hard right around dinner time yesterday and if you've ever lived in Port Coquitlam....as soon as the wind breathes we have a power outage (probably due to all the trees around....or maybe it's all the idiotic drivers plowing into the posts and it's just a coincidence).  Anyways sure enough, about an hour or so later we had a power outage.    Tony took Teddy to deliver his papers, Aleks and Krystina went into the backyard to play....quietly.  Have you ever noticed just how quiet things get when there's a power outage?  We live in a fairly quiet residential area...away from a whole lot of traffic, so when the power goes out....it gets quiet. But it's not just traffic that gives off noise.  There's a tonne of humming from other power sources that we are unaware of until the power is cut.  So where am I going with this????  I don't have a clue.....except that we have a fairly noisy family...my daughter has a good set of lungs, Aleks can be heard a block away and I've been told that my voice "carries" at times.  Put it all together.....we can be loud.  And I love peace and quiet....so I took advantage of it with everyone out of the house, the sun poking through the trees as they stood tall and silent and nothing else going on.  What I would give for more of that...but then I'm told I'll miss all the noise and commotion in a few short years...ah well, I'll take it in bits and pieces.

Me:  I've only finished half my coffee and I still need to pack.  5 minutes later  Kids:  Mom, mom, are we going NOW?  Aw mom it's cloudy. Me:  If you don't stop bugging me...we will stay home....and the clouds are light, they'll burn off.  2 minutes later  Kids:  Mom, it's going to get dark!  (it's 9:30 a.m. as I write this) Me:  Go to your room and wait for further instructions. Kids:  Awwww mom!  Ahhhhh peace and quiet once more!  Have a good day one and all!

      So the weekend went by pretty good.  Actually the weekend went by in a haze a couple of nights....well, that's cuz my weekend (not that I ever really get a "weekend") started Thursday night, cuz hubby decided to take Friday off, then he decided to take Monday off and now....he's taking Tuesday off!  Yipee!  So anyways....I made a nice dinner for his birthday on Thursday.  Salmon fillet, jasmine rice with corn, asparagus and another request of his....Curried rice with chicken. Then...for desert we had apple pie with Breyer's 100% natural vanilla ice-cream!  And then 3 bottles of wine!!!! (between the 2 of us mind you).  Friday....hmmm, I can't remember that far back (must've been the wine).  I do remember working in the evening...oh yeah, I went for a workout too.  Saturday, I actually dragged hubby to the gym and we did a workout together.  I worked out my legs and am still paying for it (on that note...do you know that since I've "upped" my level of intensity on my leg workouts...my right knee (not the torn ligament) is actually feeling better!  So we did that, left the kids (except for Teddy) with my parents for a bit and went to Chapters and Milestone's with Teddy...had some more wine (I didn't have anything Friday...just in case you're thinking).  Then went up to my parents to pick up the kids...and had way more wine (you have to if you want to get through spending a whole lot of time with my mom).  Needless to say....I did not drive home and haven't touched the stuff since....I think the acid has finally returned to normal levels in my stomach since then.  Sunday, we went to church, went for sushi (who would've thought Krystina would love sushi?? - she ate cucumber rolls and California rolls!  Today I did a bunch of running around, went to the gym and did a workout with the trainer (Chris).  He's helped me so much and today he said that I'm one of his "better" clients.  And he's really surprised and happy to see how far I've come in such a short time...Cindy watch out! :) just kidding lol.  Tomorrow (well I guess it's actually today) the whole family's going to spend the day at White Pine Beach.  It's a very "family" type lake close by (near another big lake - Buntzen) and the kids are just completely ecstatic.  I'll catch some rays too and hubby will probably turn lobster red...as he always does first time out (he's pretty fair skinned).  Well if I'm going to enjoy it..I better get some shut eye!  Ciao.

      Hey Moinens.  Happy Birthday to you!  Can you believe that you're 41 today?  Neither can I....  You were just a mere 26 when we first met.  Oh how our lives have changed.  We've gone from the carefree, party every night, pot smoking, who gives a crap, let's go for a cruise, let's get another six pack, "hey is Bruce home", let's stay up all night - to.... can you brush her teeth, when are you going to be home for dinner, I need my oil changed, oops sorry honey, I drove into the truck, not tonight...I'm beat, I need to have my legs waxed, did you want "winged" or "not".  Wow how our lives have changed!  One thing that hasn't changed though.....and that's how much I love you!  And how much you mean to me....and always will!  I hope you had a really nice birthday, I tried to make it as best as possible, considering I had a headache, considering I went through at least 8 temper tantrums, considering you were on the phone at work,  seven out of your 10 hours, considering I burned my hand, considering....I'd do pretty much anything for you.  Just as I would have 14 years ago....nothing has changed, really!  I love you with all of my heart, with the deepest depths of my soul.  Without you, I am nothing, with you, I am everything!  I love you and wish you all the best, now and always, forever and a day, I wish you Happy Birthday!  And just to remind you......you will ALWAYS be older than me!  :)  Love you!

      So I went to the doctor's today to go over the results of my most recent x-rays.  As I suspected....nothing was to be had!  Well of course not, it's not my bones that are giving me trouble....it's all the other stuff....you know the stuff that doesn't show up on x-rays! like ligaments, tendons, cartilage.  So this is what he said.  He suspects now that it's not my cartilage, but a frontal ligament that's messed up on my right leg.  He did take notice of the difference in size in my two quads and showed me some exercises I can do to help build the smaller one up.  The pain and swelling that started on the weekend in my other knee (the one with the torn ligament) was probably the cartilage right under the knee cap that's been irritated.  So he wrote me a prescription for some extremely expensive anti-inflammatory and told me to...........exercise more!  Uh yeah okay.  I'll add an hour to my already daily exercise routine.  Oh and I'm probably looking at another 6 months, just to see the surgeon (it's already been 6 months) - I haven't even met the guy yet!  So I'll probably be retired and unable to walk by the time I finally have this flipping surgery!  I have a headache....time for bed.

      I forgot that I was pissed about something.....  My sister-in-law has a really nasty habit of needing everyone to feel sorry for her and always pulls these little "woes me's" when there's a special occasion.  The latest thing was last weekend (on Krystina's birthday).  My mother-in-law (may she rest in peace) is buried about a block away from our house (not a very good idea).  Whenever we have a gathering "J" goes up to the cemetery and comes back all depressed.  Don't get me wrong....I miss my mother-in-law, loved her more than my own mother!  But the circumstances of her death were self-inflicted and well....it's a story that I'd just rather not get into.  So anyways....we're going on 4 years now since her death and I'd still like to move away from here.  Anyways....so she went up and came back all upset because the flowers that she planted were not doing so well (um hello, it's been extremely hot).  Basically she came back and gave Tony shit about her flowers being dead.  Tony's the type of person that doesn't believe in having a memorial type thing done up at a cemetery plot...we visit, we pay our respects, we occasionally put flowers but we don't go on a daily pilgrimage to tend to someone else's flowers.  Even though it's only a block away, we just don't have the time.  If "J" wants to have a "garden" set up there....then she can take care of it. Are we being cruel and unfeeling?  Again, the circumstances of her death have a lot to do with my own feelings but you know what?  "Fuck you and your needing everyone to feel sorry for yourself.  You've become a self-righteous, pious individual who can't be herself anymore. I'm sorry if we've offended you, I'm sorry if we're not "pure" enough for you, but you really need help and need to get off your high horse!  I get enough of this crap from my own mother and I'm not about to tend to someone else's self-pity.  She's gone, she's not coming back, she did this to herself and to all of us, she didn't care about anyone enough to save herself (when she was 100% capable of it, and was warned over and over) and now...you want me to go on a daily trek to water  your  flowers.  You've never even said "thanks" for taking Tata shopping, or for cooking for him, or taking to the doctor's, dentist's, for tests, the bank etc. etc. etc..  Once again....it's the same old shit, I'm not heading out to a "real" job so I should have time to water your fucking flowers!  Sorry!  I DO have a full-time job, I just try to cram it in when I'm worn out from all my other duties of being mother, wife, taxi driver, bookkeeper and the list goes on!"  Okay, I'm really sorry guys.....that stuff just started pouring out.  There's so much more to the story between myself, Tony and my sister-in-law.  Tony could probably write a book on it.  You see, I don't go through crap with just my own family, ie. my mother, but with the other side as well....Tony will be the first to agree.  Maybe it's just too much to ask for people to be themselves, to be positive, to be fucking glad that they're alive!  Hell we're on this earth for such a short time....let's enjoy all that we've got, we could all be doing a hell of a lot worse!  Wouldn't you agree?  It's Saturday night, I'm in pain (OMG, I'm feeling sorry for myself?!?!? no I'm not!) I'm enjoying some vino....thinking about my friend Cindy, who I'm hoping is having a blast! and I just had this urge to vent.  Like I said...the story goes so much deeper....maybe one day I'll fill you in on everything...but for now....the tips of my fingers are getting numb, so are my lips for that matter....and it's time to sign off before I start writing stuff that I'll look at tomorrow and go "OMG what the hell did I write that for?"  Cheers!

Oh by the way.....we didn't know that we had a pond in our back yard when we bought the house.  The guy who lived here (for 7 years) never touched the yard, the entire time...you can only imagine the stuff that we came across!&nbsp; urlLink

      I took Aleks to the library today, he took out 6 books on insects and bugs....he's writing a book on them.  I got my hair hacked....I really like it!  Didn't get it coloured though...maybe when Shalah comes back from holidays in August.  Went to the Hannam Korean Market on North Road and bought some cantelope, red currents (which Krystina just loves) and a mini Tae Kwon Do uniform to hang from the car window so everyone can see that I have killer kids in the car!  Went to Michael's and bought a poster frame for the Swan Lake Barbie poster that Krystina got for her birthday.  Checked out "Planet Organic" - a new concept in organic shopping.  Shit I should be a sales lady talking like that.  I see no one really liked my picture of Vinny??  That's okay....  Took it easy today....woke up with an extremely swollen, red, hot and painful left knee...I don't know if something bit me? or if I hurt it working out yesterday...although the only work I did with my legs was the Eliptical and wall squats?  Doesn't look/feel very good right now though.  Ah well, I'm going to the doctor's on Monday anyways.  Came home and did a bit of work, cut hubby's hair, dinner, DQ with the kids...all in all, a very nice day to be had.

      Would someone please tell me how the hell you can workout (and pretty hard), in a gym, wearing jeans (with belt) and workboots????  Have people gone mad?  And also.....why do they have 2% cottage cheese (with 512 mg sodium), 1 % cottage cheese (with 434 mg sodium), no fat cottage cheese (with 412 mg sodium) and only 2% cottage cheese - no salt added (44 mg sodium) - so it has 4.6 grams of fat?  Yeah....like hubby said...maybe I am becoming obsessive?  Anyways...did I tell you guys about the sign my son Aleks, made for his door last weekend (for Krystina's birthday party)?  This is what it said..... "Do not   cum   in my room, only Teddy, Aleks, Thomas and Michael".  I burst out laughing and just about choked on my own saliva.  What the hell do you say to a seven year old who's learning to "spell by sound"?  Teddy's little girlfriend is calling....and calling....and calling. Tony and I have decided to get him his own phone for his birthday.  And if he wants....he can pay for his own line.  Oh I might add....all these girls are 1 - 2 years old than he is!!!!!  I'm taking Aleks to the public library tomorrow to look for "bug books" so he can continue working on his "facts" book.  And then.....I'm getting my hair hacked!  My bangs have grown back a little...but I need some serious help.  Someone suggested getting "caramel" streaks put in?  Hmmmmmm, we'll have to see.

      It's been a great week and Canada Day so far.  I mean, how the hell can we complain with this gorgeous weather that we're having?!?!  I went to the gym yesterday and had another body composition done.  I'm down from 24% body fat to 21%, I've lost 4 pounds in 3 weeks (120 lbs) and I'm definitely seeing the shape coming in.  I was so pleased with this...so when I came home, of course the first thing I did was tell hubby.  He replied by asking me if I was obsessed and that he was worried I was going to end up like Karen Carpenter.  Oh brother!!!!!!!!!! and Whatever!!!!!  all at the same time!  Blood pressure has stayed the same at 135/87, which I was really hoping would come down....oh well, I'm having fun and I'm feeling good!  I tried to take the boys to see Spiderman 2 yesterday.  It was a 2 hour wait, so we decided to see "Dodgeball".  It had some funny parts and pretty stuuuuuuupid parts too.  We had $15 in coupons, so it wasn't like we wasted the money or anything.  Today I got to sleep in...yay!  And then I did a few things around the house....lots of laundry of course, baked more banana bread (I know, I know Cindy - but this heat is killing my bananas, so I had to do something with them!).  And then.......I decided to "relax" for a while in the sun, with a good book - I tell you, Stephen King's "Desperation" is just awesome!  Anyways, I was out for absolutely no more than an hour and a half (that's 45 minutes to roast each side).  Well "roast" is exactly what I did...at least to the chest (but that's probably because it's so damn flat that the sun can find it real easy!).  So needless to say, I'm a roasty toasty marshmellow right now. Ah well, I guess I have my "start".  Tony thinks I've gone off the deep end, working out, losing weight, tanning (burning)....I've already asked for the "boob job" - kidding!!!! Well I have, but it's just a joke between us.  Hey, as I took a quick peek at the redness on my belly and saw my belly ring...I just realized that I'll be able to buy "new" jewellery for my belly at the end of this month!  Woo hoo!  Now just to come up with the money to buy something nice!  Well that's about it for today....I'm going to upstairs and put an ice pack on the burn and watch it sizzle for a while.  lol  Oh, I just crack myself up sometimes.  Yeah.......not!  Oh and P.S.  Teddy's already "tired" of the girl that phoned and left a message (at least that's what he's saying).....they haven't even seen each other!  And no, I do not permit dating at this age.  Not until he's 25!  LOL

       Now there's a flashy title for a webpage?!      This was brought up by a very good  urlLink friend    of mine.  I noted to her in a drunken conversation that we were having on this fine evening (me - drunk on wine, her - drunk on water)...well, to be honest with you....I don't even remember what it was that I "noted" to her.  But the title "ILoveMeat.com" came up and she said that it would be a good title for a webpage...especially since my dad's a butcher!        Did I mention that my dad's a butcher?      My dad....the greatest man on earth (well at least in my eyes), next to Jesus (cuz you know he walked these soils), is most definitely and has been for the past 30 years, a butcher!  He is the finest man that one would ever come across.....he's incredibly hardworking, exremely supportive (when his wife isn't around), always welcoming and always happy (again when his wife isn't around).  I love my dad!  It'll be a very sad day when he leaves this earth...I pray that he'll go onto Heaven....but I'm not the "judger".  Until then.....I love him and I always will.      Okay anyways......my dad is a butcher.  Every week I put in a "meat order". Every week he brings home 75% of what I ask for and 25% of what I don't ask for.  But I always get 100% of my order!  Last week, I asked for goulash meat.....I got a chunk of this red, bloody piece of flesh that I had to take into my hands and cut, all the while feeling the knife penetrate each layer of muscle fiber.  I made "Curried Beef Stew"....it was deadly.      Last week I also asked for 6 pork chops and 5 New York steaks....I got just that.  We ate those on Sunday and on Monday....BBQ'd, of course.      Sometimes I get ground beef....sometimes it's really bloody, sometimes it's not.      Every week, I ask for 3 x 200 grams of some sort of lunch meat....every week, I get just that.  But he surprises me....sometimes I get Cooked Ham, Lyoner and Turkey Breast, sometimes I get Cooked Ham, Genoa Salami and Pastrami, and other times I get, Cooked Ham, Crackow Salami and Beer Sausage...but I always get my Cooked Ham!  That's cuz dad knows what I like.      This week I also got some cheddar cheese and then to boot....he threw in some broccolli, tomatoes and butter lettuce...who would've ever thought that I could get that stuff through a butcher?!?!?  lol.      Today we picked out a new phone.....he bought himself a new Samsun A650.  I have a Samsung 406 (I think)....I never bought it....someone bought it for me (that's another story)....I will never get rid of it.      Back to my dad.....you'd think that will all the meat that I see....I'd be sick of the stuff....never!  I'm a red blooded, type 'O' positive, 100% brunette, Slovak born...Canadian raised, meat eating woman!  If I don't get my meat.....I'm just not complete!      I'm taking orders!

        Purses        Do you carry a purse?  - Does a diaper bag count?  Is your purse strap long or short?  - Longer.  Is your purse big or small?  - It's a diaper bag....what do you think?  Is it neat and organized or full of stuff that shouldn't even be in there?  - It's full...I'm a "you just never know" kind of person.  Have you ever forgot your purse at a store or any place at all?  - Blasphemy!!!  never.  When shopping for purses do you have a hard time finding exactly what you want?  - I shop for backpacks....not purses.  How much is the most you have ever spent on a purse?  - $60.00  Is your husband allowed to go into your purse?  - Yeah...but he never does, he just stands by it and waits until I get whatever he needs.  Does your husband ever ask you to put things in your purse so as he doesn't have to carry anything like his cell phone or sunglasses?  - Yup.  If he does ask you to do that does it drive you nuts?  - Only if it already weighs 20 lbs.  Are you happy with your current purse or are you in need of a new one?  - Did I mention it's a diaper bag????

       urlLink    Brought to you by Cheddar X   - Wednesday      Would you rather:     Sing country songs buck naked to the PTA or come across your "art" photos on a porn site?  - Definitely not sing buck naked...I can't sing anyways, so I'd have to be completely looped!  Maybe someone would "spot" me and I'd make some money off my "art"...then again, maybe not.    Have a biker gang for neighbors or five chatty Chihuahuas within barking distance?  - I could always shoot the Chihuahuas...it would be harder to shoot the biker gang.    Be addicted to sniffing modeling glue or be addicted to huffing butane from Bic lighters?  - WTF?    Lick a 9 volt battery or lick the bottom of your foot?  - Okay, that's just gross....I'd lick the battery...done that before.    Ketchup soup or mustard soup?   - Ketchup soup without a doubt....it's make out of tomato's and I like tomato's.    Live in a great house in a place you don't like or a bad house in a place you love?    -  we bought a bad house in a place we love and made it into a "nice" house in a place we love.    Spend a weekend at a spa or spend a weekend camping?  - If it's the Ancient Cedars Spa at the Wickinninish Inn on the island......I'm there!       And finally, just a couple of questions this week to maintain the continuity.     1. What would you host a cable tv program about?  - cooking    2. What or who do you lust for?   - what's with all these trick questions????  Vinny, of course!  lol  and my husband....of course.  :)  and a brand new Corvette.    3. You've got a spare $5,000, what do you do with it?  - pay off my debts and spend a weekend at The Wickinninish Inn.    4. How often do you see your family?  - too often....oh that's bad....about 2 - 3 times a month.

       Beneath the branches of the mighty oak I stand   with the winter wind in my hair.   Remembering the face I yearn to see,   wanting the touch I longed for there.      As I tread through the wilderness    where Gods hands has shown its love,   the creations of his making are together,   as intended   Hallowed are the gifts from up above.      All seems complete as I wander there   with all these belessings bestowed upon me   Of what more should I seek?   For what else should I care?      Without the love I long for night after night   Without the passion I so desire   Nothing God nor man has ever given   Would make my life seem right   withouth this love I require.      For when I see the might oak   the branches appear cold and bare.   The lovely wilderness is seen by blinded eyes.   As I stroll aimlessly there.      Still an eternal flame of love   kindles the fire within me    As the warmth of the passions of thy love   lights the amber within thee.   This, as we stroll amongst the mighty oaks    hand and hand   heart and heart are we   God has blessed our love with his heavenly grace   All is right   All is as meant to be.

       Today after dinner, I was cleaning things up, checking e-mails, etc. etc. and trying to get out the door to get in a workout.  The phone rang....it said "private caller"...since I wasn't expecting a call and I didn't know anyone that was listed as a "private caller", except for hubby...but he was home, I chose not to answer it.  Then it rang again, and then again, and then again, and then one last time.  Pretty bad of me huh?  Hey, I was rushing...my time is valuable!        Two minutes later Aleks comes up the stairs and asks me, "Mom, if you phone the emergency will anything happen?".  I said, "Pardon me?  Oh no...you didn't?"  "Okay, Aleks you need to tell me the truth....did you phone 911?" "No mom, Teddy did...because he said that if I didn't put something away he would call 911". And then it hit me as to who "private caller" was....it was the 911 department!!!      I called for Teddy  to escort me outside...I already knew the scene I'd face when I opened the door and no-one had even knocked yet.  Sure enough.....a nice, shiny, white, RCMP patrol car had pulled up to my house and two officers stepped out.  I started explaining what had happened.  And then one of the officers basically gave me a look like, "okay, lady...shut up now...we wanna talk to the kid".  Teddy just stood there for a few minutes, unable to say anything.  They grilled him....just to make sure that I hadn't threatened him by making him say something that wasn't true.  Then the officer seemed to soften a little and asked Teddy if knew what 911 was for.  Finally he made sure that Teddy understood that if there was a problem....he  should  phone 911 and that it was okay to.      Just before they left the other officer (a female) took down my name, birthdate, phone number and address...you think they wanna send me a birthday card next year?        Kids!!!

       urlLink Wednesday Whatevers   1.  If you could have your future accurately told, would you want to know and why?  - No, I'm a believer of "there is a plan for me" and I take each and every day and enjoy it to it's fullest. I know full well, that tomorrow may never come and I need to be the best that I can be today and never have the attitude that "tomorrow will be better"...each and every day comes with something that should make you appreciate being alive.   2. When you are upset do you prefer to be with people or in solitude and why?  - Most definitely solitude....I'm a thinker and I like to be able to sit and think things out in quiet. It's hard to do with 3 kids ya know.   3. Is brainwashing possible and why?  - Oh yeah! Look at David Koresh. How about the JonesTown (I think that's what it was called) massacre. Charles Manson....I think you get my point.

       Nothing in the world could have prepared me for the pain that I'm feeling today.        My workout yesterday at the gym, was intense to say the least.  My trainer showed me how to do "chin-ups" and "pull-ups" properly (without any support)...of course, I was not able to lift my own weight, so he says...."let's do it backwards".  And so I did...all 6 sets (3 and 3) of 5 each and there was no "slacking".  Chris said I was going to "hate" him after this....I think I really do!?!?  :)        Today...if I can pick these arms off the keyboard, I'm taking the kids to the blueberry farm to do some picking....maybe I'll just "supervise"???      As I write this...the boys are having a snack and Krystina is fanning the cat with some sort of blanket she found in her room.  It amazes me that that cat hasn't clawed her eyes out.

       I so miss my side-bar not being where it's supposed to be.....I think in just a few more posts....I'll have that one post down far enough (I don't really want to delete it), that my side-bar will float back on up!

       I was going to publish a post about something that really made my day today....but I changed my mind only because it's that dear to me.      Suffice to say.....I connected with a very very good friend today.

         1. What's "it" all about, anyway?  - I have no idea......"happiness", "love", "money", that three lettered word that's starts with an "s" and nobody can live without???  "The meaning of life"....what's "it" to you?         2. What radical political ideas do you have, if any?  - Oh my...I like to be as far removed from politics as possible!           3. Do you believe that you 'fit' the profile of your astrological star sign?  - While I'm not a huge believer in the whole idea....yeah, I do belive that I do "fit" the profile.           4. Will blogging survive 2005 or is it a fade?  - Fade???  That's just blasphemy!!! I'm addicted to it...how the heck can it fade?  How is that possible?  Seriously....no, I think it'll become bigger and better!           5. Do you Ebay? If so, what and how often? Is it a full-time job, part-time hobby, or just to clear the junk from your house?  - Nope...I've never done the e-bay thing.  Hubby on the other hand......wheels and deals continuously.  He bought me a 100 year old Bible from the UK that was owned by a woman who had 11 children (one died).           6. True or False: When I vote, I am all for one party.  - I vote for who hubby tells me to....I told you....I'm NOT into politics.           7. Meat or veggie sauce on your spaghetti?  - My dad is a butcher....what do you think?           8. Would you ever be on a TV Reality Show?  - No...I'm too shy.           9. What is one thing (or place) that you would like to do (or see) that you have not yet done (or seen?)  - The list is too long!  Ummmm, jet skiing, visit Jerusalem, maybe get some boobies (lol), own a mortorcycle, get over my fear of flying.........           10. Do you answer memes honestly?  - You betcha!

       I so need to get my blog revamped.....I just hope that I'm not missing anyone's comments....      I'm having so much fun with my blog....okay, I'm addicted.  And I'm buzzed and it's time to go to sleep.  I shouldn't really admit that, should I?  It's a Saturday night...why the heck not.

        Another This and That      1. How do you like your eggs?   - scrambled or sunny side up (but not wet).         2. What do you collect?   - wine....lol, no seriously....dirty Pull-Ups (sorry, it's the truth).         3. Do you carry a purse, backpack or briefcase on a regular basis? If yes, does it contain only the essentials or a whole lot of everything?  - only my wallet (which is big)...I like to be "free".         4. When is the last time you've read a book, put together a puzzle,built something or did something crafty?  - right now...I'm just about done "To End All Wars" and then it's off to "The Philadelphia Experiament Murder"...thanks to my friend  "Vinny" ...Cindy, you know what I'm talking about.  I don't have time for crafts....have you checked out my itinerary lately?         5. What was the highlight of your weekend?  - finishing up a client's books....now onto the next one!  Or....getting the laundry done?  Seeing my friend "Vinny"?  Making it to the gym after indulging in a bottle of wine...yes you heard me...a bottle (but I had it the night before...not like, right before I went to the gym...that would just be plain stuuuuupid!).      LOL...Ciao!

       So because I'm too brainless to figure out how to make the post smaller.....you'll have to live with the side-bar being down at the bottom of my post.  I know for a fact it will come back up....when my most recent post moves down.  So I guess I should just write a really long story or something...something to bore you all to tears...at least then you'll see my side-bar again.      Well I'm going to the gym today and then to my parents, so I'm sure I'll have a story or two after that excursion.      Did I ever mention to you that I have a friend who very much looks like good old "Vinny"?  Ah yes....let's all take a deep sigh!      :)

       Where is everyone this morning?  I like to sit with my cup of jav, before the rug rats get up and catch up on the goings on of my fellow bloggers and.....nobody's made any posts.  Ah well.....I guess I'll just start on the work then....thanks for nothing folks! - :)  you do know I'm just kidding with that comment right?  I know that you all of have busy lives and don't always have time to "blog"...it's just that when you've got like 12 blogging friends and no-one's made a move in the 4 hours that you've slept...well it gets a little worrisome..."Have they given up?" "Have they had enough of me?"  "Have they changed their blog and didn't tell me about it?"  Okay....I'm just being a goof....my brain is still in "sleep mode" and I'm just passing the time while I finish the brew.  Teddy's up and he's already complaining that he's "bored".      Busy day ahead....I'll check in later.

       Okay, so it's not one word. Tonight I was racing around cleaning things up and getting ready to get out the door to head over to the gym. Did I mention that I  needed  to go to the gym. God bless my kids...but they're a pain in the rectum! So I had had enough of them and needed to GET OUT!      So as I'm cleaning the floor in the kitchen, Krystina starts freaking out and screaming at the top of her lungs...."mama, poo, mama poo!" So here I am thinking that another "bobek" (as we like to call those hard, circular balls of "stuff" that somehow find their way out of my daughter's butt) had fallen on the floor...somehow. So I go running over to and find that no, there's no "bobek" but something is dripping beneath her. I'm thinking...."hmmm, this is strange, these new Pampers are shit!" Then I realize that she's not wearing anything but her panties. "OKAY.....Who the hell took off her diaper and didn't tell me about it?????" Everyone was silent. I don't know how....unless I was hiding in a mask of Alzeihmers (sp?) and took it off myself without having the brains enough to put another one back on....she managed to slip off the Pull-Up and then put her panties on correctly, without me knowing. When I asked her....she said "Krystina did it". So the case of the mysteriously disappeared diaper....remains a mystery - I may find it a month from now...somewhere in the house.      Anyways.... so here she is, dripping and had been dripping from her bedroom to the kitchen (a mere 7 feet) and freaking out about it! Then...she demands she sit on the potty...."okay sure, go ahead....but you're all EMPTY now!!! It's a little too late Princess to be asking to sit on the potty now!!!! Now that you've pissed all over the floor!" Again, thank you for laminate....cuz all I had to do was wipe (or call the cat) and a bit of antibacterial spray and the job is done!       And hey....at least she now knows what it's like to "piss her pants"!      Here's a question...."Have you every laughed so hard that you actually (really) peed in yours?"

       I figured it out!!!!! I can now read all your comments again....for some reason, all of sudden, my pop up ad filter affected my comments and I wasn't able to view them! And  urlLink Jenn    I can   post on yours again!      I'm so smart it kills me!!!  Whatever......... :)      Dinner time!

       Well I can see that you're all able to make comments....and that's awesome!  Please don't stop just on account of the fact that I can't.....read them!!!!!      I have no clue as to why I'm able to open and read everyone elses comments and why you're able to leave me comments.....but I can't open my own!  Argh!!      Anyways.....I don't want my day ruined all on account of some silly commenting system.      The sun hasn't returned to our city as of yet...I miss him dearly.  The kids are having a grand old time terrorizing the cat...well, can't say that he doesn't get his exercise!  He's an indoor cat but it quickly being converted into wanting to be an "outdoor" cat!      Went for a workout last night....not sure why this week is killing me.  Did a lower body workout on Tuesday and I'm still in pain.  It's all good though.  There was a guy there wearing headphones (like who doesn't) but no, these weren't any old headphones...these were those really big (bigger than the one's you wear for ear protection) headphones....looked a little outdated.  And tell me....why do people do one set on a machine and then socialize for the next 15 minutes at it and then do one more set before they move on!  Like hello!!! there are others around.      Oh it looks like I'm almost turning this into a griping session?!?!      Anyways....I better move this sore butt of mine....it's Thursday, which is Grandpa's shopping day!  So off we go.      Hopefully I'll be able to read the comments again soon.

       Well actually I'm having tea.....and oh look, the rain's starting to come down again.      I've been working my butt off today and thought I'd take a quick break to enjoy some "blog time"!      I managed to finish up one client's books, so I'm glad about that.  I'm hoping to finish up another one tonight (or sometime in the wee hours of the morning).  If I could just have some more uninterupted time....I would be doing and feeling a whole lot better.  Oh well....September is just around the corner.      So I did 3 loads of laundry today as well....I should just forget making money at bookkeeping and just count on all the cashola I find in the laundry machine every few days.  Today I made a whopping .50 cents!!!!  oh and a bullet casing fell out too....(souvenier of spending some "quality time" with dad).  No seriously though, do you know how many times I find change in the washer....and there's been a few times that I've found bills....$20 bills!!!  That doesn't happen very often anymore cuz I threatened hubby that I'd keep the money...for real!  So he's been checking his pockets more often.l      I should get some dinner organized so that when we get back from TKD (Tae Kwon Do) we can sit down and shovel it in.      The boys have generally been pretty good today...actually they've been really good.  They managed to clean up the family room, living room and bedroom and deliver the local rag without arguing and now....they're downstairs building these really cool "cities" with Lego...together...no screaming...no swearing. (did I ever mention that Aleks was grounded for a week for calling Teddy an "asshole"?!?!?!  that's what school did to Aleks this year)      Krystina was walking around earlier with a full (and I mean full) Pull-up and when I asked her if we should change it, she replied...."no mommy, it's empty".  I knew better....the thing weighed about 10 lbs and was plenty full of all kinds of reminders that she's been pigging on blueberries lately!  lol.....ewww gross!      Well, coffee break is over.....      Oh here's another observation I made yesterday.....I'm always amazed when I see individuals who have just had a workout in the gym and when they're barely two feet out the door they're already lighting up a smoke?  I could do that when I was a teen....but these ain't no teenagers!  That's gotta hurt!?!?!

      Okay, what the heck am I still doing up? I worked and I worked and I worked......and now it's time for some shut eye.  Did you know that the kids don't really give a hoot that you've been up all night working? No siree....."get up  mom, we're hungry"!  Why do I do this to myself?

       Okay, do you see what time it is?  I must be mad?!?!?      I'm superswamped with work. I'm addicted to this "blog".  My cat is terrorizing the house (and my children) and I need sleep.....      Here are some funny questions that could be used in a "meme" that I was thinking about while at the gym.      Why is it that middle aged men wear striped "Speedo's"?   Why do people wait until they're 15 inches away from you on a "cross trainer", to fart?!   Why do (most) people think only of themselves?   Why do you go to the gym?  Cuz I'm beginning to wonder about mine....      I'm burned out.....

        1. In general, do you treat eating as a pleasure or a need?  - I love "good" food....definitely a pleasure.    2. What is your opinion on recent low carb craze?  - Well....Mr. Atkins is dead, isn't he?  No seriously.....you need a bit of everything (carbs, protein and fat) to function properly and stay healthy....you can't overdo is on anything, the body is just not made that way.    3. Do you wake up when you have to, or do you stall / snooze for longer?  - I'm a staller.....only cuz I'm up so late.

Are you the kind of person who loves to go on most rides or just aselect few?  - call me boring....rides don't do much for me except make me want to puke.    3. What is the scariest ride you've ever been on?  - like I said......    4. Do you prefer rollercoasters, water rides or the kind that go roundand round?  - ugh....water rides, definitely.    5. What is the longest amount of time you would stand in line to get on a ride?  - like I said.....
