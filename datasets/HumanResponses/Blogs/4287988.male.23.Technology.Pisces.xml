       Well today I decided to start my little blog here. I figured since I don't have anyone to talk to I could set this up and talk to everybody. I don't really plan on anybody reading this but who knows. All right seeing as how nobody knows me and this is my first posting I guess I should give you a little background infor on my self. Well to start I am engaged to a beautiful girl named Jaime. We are engaged to be married on June 18th of 2005 and when we are married I will have two step-kids, Jimmie who is 6 and Lexeigh who is 3 who I treat like they we're my own kids. I work for the wonderful ISP earthlink as a technical support agent. Pretty much when someone has something wrong with their computer they call me up and I get it working again. When I'm not working there I am running my own home based business right now. If anybody is even interested click this link to visit the website for my business  urlLink CompRenovations . I just started that so if anybody sees anything on there that needs to be changed or added let me know by sending me an email  urlLink here . Any ways, what else is there to tell about me? I just moved into a new house that we're renting. Jimmie is getting ready to start school. We enrolled him into a private school thats in the neighborhood. I don't know much about it though, I left that up to Jaime. Other than that theres not much left to tell except all the new drama thats in my life. I despise drama to let most of you know but it seems to find me lately. Take for instance the biggest drama in my life, Jaime's ex-husband. People this man has gotten away with stuff every single father would love to get away with. He sees the kids every other weekend, only pays $200 child support for two kids and thats total not per kid, and got Jaime's old car since we got her a new kia. I mean I know guys that would kill for this and yet he still complains about helping out with the kids. Then theres some other little drama but I try and stay out of that. My biggest problem though is Jaime's cell phone. I have never in my life been jealous of a cell phone until Jill, Jaime's friend, came into my life. I find myself constantly fighting for attention with this phone. Jill works with Jaime but still sees it necessary to call every half hour to talk with her. I know, I know, I sound like a big baby but I can't help it. Anyways I'm going to sign off for now and next time I post something I hope to have some neat stuff for you guys to look at.

       Yesterday was a fun filled day.  I got home yesterday just to seee Jaime's ex-husband walk in the door.  Well for those of you that don't know we don't get along.  We don't fight mind you, we just kind of get along cause we have to.  Well when I walked in the house Lexeigh ran at me to show me her new dress.  That wasn't what bothered him so much as what she called me, "Daddy".  Now James gets them every other weekend and this was his weekend.  As him and the kids were leaving though Lexeigh again came running at me to give me a kiss goodbye.  Needless to say James was so upset about this that he wasn't paying attention and slammed our screen door in poor Jimmie's face.  Well people I am dying today.  You see every Friday night me and Jaime, my fiance for those that don't know, go out to a local bar that my father and I DJ at.  Well, Jaime and her friend Jill decided to stay later than usual and talk with some guy who a friend of theirs likes.  Well needless to say we didn't even leave there until 2:00 am.  Now the only problem with this is that I have to get up at 5:00 am to get ready for work and let me tell you I didn't want to get up today.  Then to make matters better I've got a killer headache but thanks to chat at work I found someone here that had some meds.  Isn't technology a wonderful thing.

       Heres a couple of pics of the kids from when they were with their dad. The first one is of Jimmie who is six and the second is of Lexeigh-Morgan who is three.  P.S. Don't ask me who the kid behind Lexeigh is cause I have no idea.

       Now I want to make something else clear here.  Some of you are probably thinking bad of me cause I don't like Jill.  Well first let me say that she is the only friend of Jaimes that I have problems with.  Probably why shes become Jaime's best friend.  second, I'm not the only one who feels this way.  Sharon (Jaimes's Mom), Marty Jr (My dad), John (A friend) have all said that we need to get rid of Jill.  Its not just the fact that I'm jealous, which I will admit I am, but shes just a bad influence on Jaime.  Plus I probably wouldn't hate her if she didn't do half the stuff she does.  Like when Jaime is upset and I try to comfort her Jill, even though she sees what I'm trying to do, takes Jaime and comforts her while I'm standing there looking like a Jackass.  Thats probably why Jaime thinks I don't care for like I used to and why she tells Jill stuff that she doesn't tell me.  Well anyways I just wanted to point out that I'm not the only one who feels this way about Jill.  I'll quit the bitching and let you all go.

       Hey folks, well yesterday was a toss up.  After work I had to go have my father cash my paycheck as I can't cause my license got suspended I found out.  Well after I got that done and a little bit of shopping done I went home and Jaime was home getting ready for tonight.  Well I told her I couldn't stay out that late cause the night before I didn't go to bed until 2:30am and had to get up for work at 5:00am and since I had taken somebody elses hours at work I couldn't stay out late again.  Well we came to the agreement that I would lay down and take a nap so if I did stay out late I wasn't so tired.  Well that didn't work either.  I fell asleep and woke up about 20 min. later to the dog barking at Jill, Jill's phone beeping, and Jaime blow drying her hair.  Anyways then I find out that Jill is over cause despite the fact that we don't have the money Jaime was going to get new shoes and Jill was going with her cause it was buy 1 get 1/2 off day.  Now for those of you that don't know me let me explain something.  I trust my fiance and never have a problem with her going to do whatever but I do NOT trust Jill.  Jill is single and I think that she treats Jaime like shes single.  She doesn't actually try to set Jaime up with other guys but she introduces her to all these single guys who are out to get a piece and they end up some how getting her phone number, not all guys just a select few... aka Will, and calling all the damn time.  Then you guys wonder why I hate Jaimes phone so much.  Well because of all this instead of staying home and taking my nap I went with them.  That was a mistake too.  I forgot how long it takes a woman to buy a pair of shoes.  By the time we finished it was time to get ready to go out.  Now pay attention people cause this is where it gets really interesting.  We got ready and picked up Jill from her house and then went to the bar.  Now even though I work there every once in a while I can't stand the place.  Its just not for me anymore.  When I was single it was one thing but a bar is not a place for a taken man/woman.  This is where some of my anger comes from.  You see just about every week we go some guy is hitting on my fiance and doesn't care that she is going to be married soon.  Well today that didn't happen but for some reason Jaime was getting upset every time I came around.  So I went out to the lobby of the hotel the bar belongs too.  Well it was pretty much like that the whole night and Jaime was in a mean and nasty mood.  I hate when she gets like that cause I'm not a mean person.  Well I kept my distance and then the real drama showed up.  Jill was crying because her kids were with her husband and he wouldn't let her talk to them so she was crying and upset and making a big scene.  See this is why its hard for me to fight for Jaime's attention with Jill.  Well since she was so upset she didn't stay the night as planned and we dropped her off at her house.  YEAH! I mean I hope things get better Jill.  Now heres the kicker.  Remember how my license is suspended well because Jaime and Jill like to drink till they can't drive guess who the DD is.  You got it, ME!  That was pretty much it after that I went home and passed out so I could get another three hours of sleep before I went into work.

       Well, well, well.  My week as been a living hell and now I'm going to catch you up on everything.  All right where to start.  Well last week I got pulled over for speeding and found out that my license has been suspended since July 14th.  Then my father took me off of his insurance and I had to get my own but didn't quite have the money for it yet.  I figured if I was just driving from home to work and work to home I should be ok.  Well today when I got up it was just starting to rain.  I was a block away from work and decided to stop and get gas but the gas station I stopped at was closed so I cut through a parking lot to get to another gas station.  All I could see was the lights hitting the rain on the parking lot well then before I even knew what happened I ran smack dab into a pole.  Wonderful!  I've never been in an accident my entire life and the week that I find out my license is suspended and I have no insurance is the same week I get into my first accident.  I'm not going to complain to much though.  I mean luckily I didn't hit anybody else.  Then I'd really be screwed.  Well, my father came out and gave me a ride to work and he's going to have the car towed to Mike's, our mechanic.  Now all I got to do is explain to Jaime about how bad the car is.  I called and told her I hit the pole but I don't think she realizes how bad the car is.  I never thought hitting a pole would do that much damage.  I'm glad that I wasn't in a real accident as something really bad could have happened to me.  Well we'll see what happens.
