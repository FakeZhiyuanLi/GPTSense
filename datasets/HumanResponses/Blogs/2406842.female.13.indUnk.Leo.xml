       ok so i just made my profile it still needs work but i like it for now! omg!!! last friday i went to NYC as a spanish trip with my class. it was so much fun!! i got to hang out with people who are actually nice and sweet.(Daniel, James, Zach,Bill, Kevin.) I also got to hang with some of my girls Riley and Katie. We had so much fun! I think everyone loved the trip but i mostly think that everyone like the bus ride there and home. I loved it i wish we could have another one! But i cant wait til' the final to see everyone and hangout. That  is if they want to. Anyway hope we all get the date partner that we wanted!   ~*~nikkie~*~
