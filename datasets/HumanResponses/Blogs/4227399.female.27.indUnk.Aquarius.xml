       Wow.   Weekend was chock-full of packing.   Well....almost. Does all night Friday and most of yesterday add up to "chock-full"? Happily, I think I may very well be able to finish up getting the god-awful attic packed by the end of the week. There is just SO much up there ! And it surprising to see just how much stuff I used to have in my old apartment that I STILL haven't unpacked since I moved in with J. J has COMPLETELY deconstructed the computer room...and it's SCARY to go in there. For as long as we've been together I've NEVER seen the room like that. All of the desks are in pieces and there's only 1...YES ! ONE !....computer up and running.  Now. We just need the dumbass sellers to get off of their butts and finish up their end of the deal so we can close ! Origianlly we were supposed to be moving on the 28th of this month (closing on the 27th) but at the rate we're going we'll be lucky to close by Christmas ! That being the case, this whole living out of boxes thing is going to be getting REALLY old REALLY quick ...even more than usual.  We went to bed around midnight ... and I woke up considerably later than my usual 6:15....yet I'm STILL exhausted and have been toying with the idea of using a sick day. I could tell them I hurt my back while packing and that I want to take the day to lay low. However, that god-damned work ethic of mine won't allow for it. We have WAY too much going on these days for me to take a sick day...and "the man" has been so good about taking everything in stride. One can never really tell what will set him off....and I'd like to NOT find out that my taking a sick day is one of those things.   sigh   Don't want to go to work.  Must pry self out of cozy robe, shove cat off lap, and go get ready to face yet another Monday in hell.  Hopefully it will go quickly.

                                         Well. The date has been set. Tuesday night. 5:30 pm. And I'm already getting nervous. Why am I nervous here???? I shouldn't be ! I'm the one in the right here ! I'm the one who's addressing the issue. SHE'S in the wrong and this is to ensure that I point that out ! So why am I nervous???? Why do I doubt myself so much???  At her first response I thougt he was right about her being dumb. But as we went back and forth, via e-mail, I realized that one of two things happened. Either she's not as dumb as she likes to play like she is ... OR Someone's talked to her and explained that when you have a friend with a girlfriend...and that girlfriend is requesing a private audience with you that MAYBE it's not a good thing and it's got nothing to do with having a "girl's night out" with her.  Now I just have to figure out how to begin the conversation when Tuesday at 5:30 gets here. That, and I need to ensure that I cover EVERYTHING.  So, I guess that means it's time for me to put my little thinking cap on and start making a list...and then make sure I remember what's ON that list so when the time comes I don't leave ANYTHING out.   Sigh

                                         Yeah.    That would be me . . . .    And welcome to my blog !    As this is my first entry, there isn't much to say yet . . .    But oh !    I assure you that will change quickly enough !    I am in a crazy time in my life right now and am positive there will be PLENTY to post in the future . . . And so, I'll close with another "Welcome" and close up shop for now.
