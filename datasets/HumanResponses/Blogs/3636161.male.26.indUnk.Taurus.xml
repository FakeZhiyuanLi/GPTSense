      Some people would disagree with me when I insist that Florida is indeed part of The South. I would challenge these nay-sayers to go to a restaurant, drink some sweet tea, and reflect upon the strength of their convictions from the comfort of the establishment's facilities. Nowhere is supporting evidence for annexation of Florida to the South more visible than in Her Bathrooms. Because nothing says The South quite like a piss-riddled toilet.

      Before I left California, I had my first massage. It was given to me by my coworkers, who were somehow of the distinct conviction that I needed to relax.   I'd had a certain amount of fear concerning massages, which prevented me in the past from going. As I feel I am a fairly tightly-wound and repressed person, I feel I need not trifle with things that have potential to  1)	Cause me to burst into tears when some secret pain attached to some back-alley chakra is prodded, thereby making me look a sap 2)	Cause me to sport a very public erection, thereby making me look a pervert.  Thusly, I have avoided massages with the kind of intensity reserved for high school reunions and rehashing the past with drunk ex-girlfriends.  Nevertheless, I was presented with this Japanese-style massage, and there was no denying my secret fascination/fear any longer.  So prior to the massage, I was instructed to bathe myself “ritually.” This entailed sitting completely naked on a wooden stool, pouring buckets of water over myself. I tried not to think about how this bench had seen more ass than Rob Lowe in the 80’s and concentrated on rinsing out my chlorine-ravaged hair, as ritually as I could muster. Then, I was to step into a jacuzzi, built into the middle of the room, and ritually soak. Again, buck naked. I sat in there for some thirty minutes, looking into a zen garden, listening to the sound of falling water. Very naked. Very ritual.  After the 104 degree soak, I was somewhat overheated. So, during the beginning of the massage, I was breathing jaggedly, desperate to not sound like some pervert getting off on being touched while wearing nothing but a kimono.  Finally the lady giving the massage (magic fingers) broke the silence. I told her that I was moving home and living with my parents, at least initially, while I figured things out. I mentioned that we’ve had our difficulties getting along, my father and I. She told me that when I go home, my job will be to find a new language to use with my Dad.  It was so ironic and prescient that, as SOON as I had finished my massage and come home to check my voice messages, Dad called and essentially negated the relaxation obtained from the experience. Instantly. And none-too-ritually, I might add.  And that was the first time I started practicing my new language with him. One largely populated with F-words.

      Even having lived here some eight-odd years ago, I can recall nothing of the insects of this land, except the red ants, whose homes I would routinely mow over whilst doing the yardwork.  When I announced I’d be leaving for Florida, there were the expected twenty-odd jokes about The Damn Bugs. Cockroaches so big, they defy the phylum to which they’ve been relegated, and due to their heinous proportions have been named, euphemistically, Palmetto bugs, so as not to scare off the would-be settlers of this place. “Palmetto” sounds like some line of rattan furniture at Pier One. We’re talking BUGS that could strap your refrigerator on its back, and run off with it during the night, people.    Everyone is lousy w/ stories about their experiences w/ bugs in FL. A very dear friend of mine sends me photographic evidence of her Kills, grainy polaroids with a ruler or some other ad-hoc reference marker next to the Carcass, to illustrate the dramatic proportions. That’s all very funny and whatnot, but one cannot grasp the gravid nature of the situation, faced even with all this anecdotal evidence.  But clearly, I suffer from short-term memory loss.  This evening, after returning from Harry Potter, I set about calming down the Nervous Beagle while my brother makes a frozen pizza and settles in with Instant Migrane™ (AOL Instant Messenger). Shortly thereafter, I hear him cuss several Shits and an avowal that He Can’t Believe It You Have Got To Be Kidding Me.  He calls me into the bathroom, and tells me that there is a spider in there.   I gingerly part the shower curtain, to reveal the offending arachnid.   I encounter the largest spider I have seen outside of a laboratory, to date. It was hairy, it was the size of my fist. I could hear it gnashing its chelicera. You could have put a saddle on this bastard, and ridden it around the Grand Canyon, like a pack animal.

      I like to run, and frequently do so at night. It isn’t only the oppressive, slavish Florida heat, which causes one to sweat, Naked-At-School-in-a-Dream-Style, that makes night-running my preference. Rather, it is a feeling of speed which I imagine I am better able to achieve whilst under the sexy, sheer fabric of a nighttime backdrop. It’s sort-of an enhanced proprioception, which is otherwise totally shot to hell under the harsh light of daytime. The usual orchestras of cicadas and crickets, endlessly warming-up their string sections, do provide some company, and the rhythmic throbbing of the golf course sprinklers serve as a metronome for my dirty old nikes, as they pound the ground (alternating grass and pavement).  Actually,  im Wahrheit , the thing that running at night grants me is the ability to keep my pride intact.  There is, firstly, this business of my running cadence, which I imagine to be rather rough and loping, rather like a mental patient running from his next shot of thorazine in the butt cheeks. Secondly, the nighttime cover allows me to wear some pretty heinous t-shirts—-the kinds that I have no business wearing, as I do not meet the Bicep size minimum required to wear them. (And please don’t make fun. They make me run faster. Also, have I mentioned it’s bloody hot here?)   Anyhow, a few nights back, I went running, just before sunset. I started earlier than usual, as I was attempting to replace the Cacophony of fear and self-recrimination of the day (What the hell am I really doing here?), with the White Noise of physical exhaustion. I was just getting to the point where I was hitting a second wind, closer to the river.  As I was approaching the climax of a runner’s high, I promptly aspirated a bug. Rather, it would be more accurate to say that a bug dive-bombed my uvula, kamikaze-style. The damn thing flew directly into my gag zone, and became lodged.  And I did what any person in an ill-fitting muscle tee, with a bug lodged in the throat would do. I very noisily threw up in someone’s bushes.   The punchline here is, I don’t really know what. Except I’ve always had a low-grade fear of large insects flying into my mouth, and now a really significant one has, and it’s okay.   So, I’ve decided that everything will be okay, despite that I’m living at home at 26, but feeling like I’m sixteen. And my mom still closes my shades for me at night.   We will deal with that one tomorrow.

      I'm not sure exactly why I'm challenging myself to do this.  I grew up believing that seeing the truth of things can set one apart.  But then childhood intervened in its usual cruel way and I found that delivering truth to others, in the form of simple observations even, was a surefire way to find oneself in the stew. To this day, I am ashamed to say that have been kissing the ring on the finger of the proverbial Emperor and forcing myself to believe in the wisdom of his fashion statement, as evidenced by his New Clothes.  Except now, I desire to state the inevitable; the obvious. I want to scream it. The emperor is not only bare-assed naked, but he is also morbidly obese, is going bald, and has a remarkably small penis.  Thusly, this is a record of my self discovery. This is the proof of my re-grooming as a human being, and hopefully a better one at that.   And since I’m a sucker for the path of most resistance (and not a little bit narcissistic), I have elected to publish it here, under the garish light of electronic chaperones.   This is the story of me, a man, in a self-alotted one year-long process of figuring out his Place in the World, if there is such a thing. While living in Florida. In his Parents' house. Who are both republicans, and receive 8 X 10 pictures of George W and his wife, thanking them for their contributions.  Thanks for coming.

       This week I am in Jupiter, FL. I’m told that the beaches are beautiful here. However, I’ve been busy being in shock after the realization that it is 86 degrees outside AND I’m still in Florida AND it’s still summertime. I’m seriously thinking about moving here. Plus, it’s really beautiful. The cloud formations are amazing, and they’ve got some pretty nice hills. And yachts!—everyone here’s got yachts.  This time, my Dad has accompanied me on this trip. I spent the better part of three hours silently critiquing his driving style and marveling at the fact that he hasn’t killed himself or anyone else while navigating toll roads, while attached to a cell phone.  I guess it must be admitted that Florida has its fair share of more seasoned (read, nearly-dead) drivers. Perhaps for this reason, Florida has installed what is termed “rumble strips” on the margins of most highways. The way it works is, when Grampa starts nodding off behind the wheel of his Cadillac of Death, the strips create a noise and reverberation loud and obnoxious enough to wake him up to enjoy a few more days of Adult Depends and shuffleboard. For me, the noise is obnoxious enough even one time to keep me awake on all subsequent trips. Dad crosses the strips at regular intervals. It’s the damned phone. I think he traded in a lobe of his brain when he signed up for his cellular plan.  Anyhow, during the course of the week, I’ve begun to really wonder whether this job’s for me. It’s not just the trouble I have visualizing myself as a marketing guy or a salesman—it’s just that I can’t really get…hormonal… about this industry in which I am now representing.  I sat down the other day with a student friend of my Mother’s—they’re both in Nursing school—and I was asking her about a thesis she is in the process of writing. I have an interest in theses myself, as I am beginning to write one for an old professor at Cal Poly. I found myself talking about viruses and induction and vaccines and getting totally worked up about it. That is, until my father came into the room, having been on the cell phone for tens of minutes, looking pretty peeved that I was not speaking a language he understands.  The other thing is, the people that I normally deal with are a bit different than me. I don’t intend to say that’s a bad thing, to be different from me. God knows, it could only be a plus. It’s not the Nascar references I routinely don’t get, or even the fact that I’ve never been to a Pork Pull. There’s a certain lack of candor or polish that’s lacking here. And again, that’s not a bad thing, necessarily. But is it really necessary to use the term “fucker” to refer to the current product of discussion? I’m all about the F word, but that doesn’t mean I want to use it like this, especially while I’m trying to do business over the cloying fog of your cigar, which frankly, smells like smouldering dog shit.  So, my thoughts have turned to whether it’s a good thing I’m doing this thing here, w/ my Dad’s business.  Then today:  We had essentially clenched a touch-and-go deal with a very influential customer, who, despite some pretty concrete info, had ultimately decided that we could be trusted because the company we represent happened to be owned by someone who is third- generation Eastern-Bloc. Which, you know, is the  sine qua non  of integrity, apparently.  During this sentimental exchange, my Dad caught my eyes, and for a split second, the same flash went across his as did mine. It was the equivalent of rolling one’s eyes, but almost imperceptibly so. Then we both smiled knowingly.  And then I realized, that in some way, my Dad totally makes this job worth doing. Well, SOMETIMES. But you know, I was absolutely shocked to come to that realization.  So many years that we’ve butted heads; refused to see or respect each others’ differences—and it turns out that the same kinds of things irk us.   I was so glad he was there.  Tomorrow morning, I hope to see the beach before I leave for Delray Beach, Coral Springs, and ultimately, Naples. I will be telling everyone down there that I am of Lithuanian-descent, so for those of you who know I’m Italian, please keep it on the down-low.

      I have recently returned from a week-long business trip from the Panhandle, which included stops in Pensacola, Panama City, Port St. Joe, Apalachicola, Destin, Fort Walton Beach, and many, many more. During the course of this trip, I have not only learned that Florida is divided into two time zones, but that Florida is one damned big state. Granted, one look at a map and a pass of the eye over Florida’s rather flaccid geography, and it might be tempting to write off this state as one without staying power. However, despite its perpetually-detumescent condition, Florida is a state of magisterial length and girth, I'm here to tell you.  Those who travel to the Panhandle on a regular basis have a special term of endowment--er, endearment--for this part of the state: L.A. This would not, in fact, have anything to due with Miami’s showy cousin-city on the West Coast, but everything to do with its proximity to other Confederate States, namely Alabama. Which explains the nickname, L.A, (Lower Alabama.) During my guided tour of this area, I was treated to some of the incredible local vernacular, which I am determined to start incorporating into my regular speech patterns:   Aw’m wrapped up tightah than a fiddle string!  It’s slam empty!  Watch youself theh, aw made uh devil of uh mess!  That’s jes’ wottamelon talkin’!   I have also been treated to stories about an unfortunate folk in Alabama termed inbreeds--or IB’s for short. One fellow told me I could spot them by their “5 gallon” heads. (Despite my constantly roving eye, I was not lucky enough to spot one). Another told me a story about a particular IB who was born with his left eye positioned on the upper-left area of his forehead, which endowed him with an ability to see around corners. (For a split second, I wished   I   could be an IB. But that moment quickly passed, when I reminded myself that at least I can flip my eyelids over. And I’m double-jointed.)  And if I wasn’t already worried about not fitting in—having a complete lack of anteriorally-located eyeball, nor having any original story whatever about IB’s, coupled with the fact that I have no cool vernacular of my own, save the ever popular “stoked”, I was counseled to sound as little as a white-assed Yankee as I possibly could, because the locals wouldn’t take kindly to me otherwise.  Greaaaat.  . As a kid, I was routinely mistaken for my Mother when I picked up the phone. (I still carry the complex.) And, having lived in Southern California for a good portion of my childhood, I have been accused of talking through my nose, like a gayer version of Don Johnson. But moving to Massachusetts in the springtime of my adolescence did somewhat help my speech patters sound more testosterone charged. But now—apparently sounding like I’ve done time in New England is a deal breaker. What to do? Go back to talking through my nose? I spent a good portion of the day ruminating about how to sound more like a southerner, and wishing I spent more time listening to country music.  All of my worries were for naught however, because one solid day of being in the world of the panhandle, surrounded by some of the thickest accents I’ve heard south of Georgia, I was twanging with the best of them.  Heck, I was even telling my new friend J, who was my tourguide through the Panhandle, that he was “jes’ tawkin’ wottamellons” by the close of the day.

      I admit it: I have a bit of a weakness for things that come of out Bath and Body works.&nbsp; Certainly, I do feel a bit less of a man, strolling in all flipflops and poloshirts, to find some aromatherapy lotion that will help me get a good sleep. But you know, sleep is quite a valuable thing, and therefore, I'm willing to shell out a few bucks and take a hit on the old Pride, even if it makes me look like the kind of guy who might knit, or&nbsp;highlight his hair, or even shave his scrotum occasionally.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I surreptitiously perused the pinkish baskets of floral-scented goodness, and when I had enough, I oiled up to the counter where a knock-out brunette was at the register. At the last moment, I chose to rifle through a basket of lipstick-sized&nbsp;air fresheners, whose smells included, among others,&nbsp;"fresh linen." I must have looked a big agonized, because the brunette leaned forward and said silkily, "You know you want it."  &nbsp;  Taken aback, and embarrassed, and somehow simultaneously turned on, but wishing to look bold, masculine, in-control, and directed--directed! "I made decisions easily and powerfully!"--I bought it.  &nbsp;  She gave me my total, and I gave her exact change for the amount.  &nbsp;  "Wow, you're the first person that's given me exact change today!"  &nbsp;  I was going to start stammering, having fallen into a narcotic wooziness induced by all the feminine energy around me, and become shy in front of this Vision of Brunette Loveliness,--start to explain about the handy change purse that I bring with me, which is&nbsp;just perfect for exact change scenarios, like paying for that soy chai to sip while reading  Memoirs of a Geisha.     &nbsp;  But instead, I leaned forward and said in a husky voice, "Gosh, I've always wanted to be someone's First."  &nbsp;  To which, she&nbsp;turned a heart-vibrating hue of red.

      I invited my father to see "I, Robot" with me on Friday. Upon arriving to the movie theatre:  &nbsp;    Dad  : Eleven dollars? That's ridiculous. I'm not paying that kind of money for a damn movie!  &nbsp;    Me  : Well, Dad, that's okay, because I'M paying.      &nbsp;    Dad  : No, goddamit, you're not paying for me. That's ridiculous. I'm waiting until the 7:50 pm show.      &nbsp;    Me  : Okay,&nbsp;sure,&nbsp;Dad. No problem. Whatever you want.      &nbsp;    Clerk  :  ...that will be 22 dollars, sir.       &nbsp;    Me  : Okay, great. Here you go.    &nbsp;   Dad : (incredulous) What are you doing? I said I was going to pay!      &nbsp;    Me  : Geez, Dad, I'm sorry...it all happened so fast. I didn't mean to!  &nbsp;   Later on that weekend, at a moderately-priced Italian restaurant ...  &nbsp;    Attractive Waitress  : (bringing check for 75 plus dollars) Thank you!  &nbsp;    Me  : (reaching for my wallet).      &nbsp;    Dad  : Oh, Tom, just throw that on your business card. Let the business pay for it.      &nbsp;    Tom  : (shocked) Dad, have you SEEN my Amex card this month? It's higher than Robert Downey,&nbsp;Jr&nbsp;on the day&nbsp;after&nbsp;his birthday!&nbsp;      &nbsp;    Dad  : Relax, Tom! It's only money. Go ahead and charge it.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      This week, I am visiting the great city of Jacksonville, FL, on business. I've got a list of clients, given to me by Father Mussolini, which could be measured in cubits. Considering the torrential rain coming down at the moment, cubits might be a good measurement to be familiar with, should I need to resort to building an Ark of biblical proportions, to sail out of this place.  I was told today (by someone very much In The Know), that Jacksonville is growing faster than President Bush's nose. There are some 100,000 homes being built in the area, this year alone, and no doubt,  all  of them will be built on newly-synthesized golf courses designed by Jack Niklaus's son-in-law. (Or Tom Fazio's son's best-friend's neighbor's cousin. Or some other terribly-extruded relationship to some (likely aged) Golf dignitary.)  It turns out that Jacksonville has a good bit of historical credibility. It was named after Andrew Jackson. During the civil war, the city served as a base for blockade runners, and during Reconstruction, was a popular winter resort. Presently, it really is a quite-nice place; tons of families,  urlLink good schools  in the area,  urlLink nice homes , good economy. They've also got good beaches proximally-located, has a decent historic area that's been freshened up, and  urlLink Mayo Clinic  is here too. It's undeniably on the up-and-up.  Regardless and not withstanding which, most of us who've lived in Florida in the past ten years know Jacksonville from a more infamous standpoint: its involvement in the paper-milling business. Why paper-milling, you ask? And why Jacksonville for that matter? I don't know exactly; may have something to do with its juxtaposition on the St. Johns River. But whatever, none of that is important.   What  IS  relevant to know, however, is that Jacksonville's involvement in this industry had perfumed this 750 some-odd sq. mile sprawling city with a singularly heinous scent. I like to describe it as, the Collective Ass of a Thousand Counties.  I am much chagrined to have determined today, after a 9 year absence, that this smell is all but undetectable.   Which got me to wondering on the various ways to market this pleasing fact to would-be home buyers in the state:  "Now with less Ass Scent."  "Jacksonville: Denuding vegetation every day for your golfing pleasure."  "Jacksonville! Doing our part for the Great North American Enclosure Movement. Visit one our many gated golf communities today!"  "Come to Jacksonville! We've got that  Fresh Feeling  your mother forbade you to talk about."  "Jacksonville: Protecting your affluential family from other undesirable affluential families, one security kiosk at a time."  "Jacksonville: Because everyone should have a golf-course view."

      My dad convinced me to go see Spider Man 2 with him this evening. This brings the number of movies I've seen in theatres, this summer alone, to a grand total of four. This is more than I've seen in one year, and I expect I'm going for several more visits. I was otherwise dancing eye to eye with an evening spent with my  Studying for the GRE  book. Spidey, therefore, sounded like a marvelous plan. So, Dad and I piled into the Volvo and headed to  urlLink Ybor Centro .  The movie was great; a certifiably excellent, sound sequel.    Me : Thanks, Dad. That was a lot of fun.   Dad : Well, I didn't pay.   Me : I know that, Dad. Thanks for coming out. It was fun.   Dad : Oh, yeah, well..um (clears throat). Oh, you mean, thanks for the company.   Me : I just mean, thanks in general.   Dad : (Happy sounding; rattling off expectations and projections for Installment 3).  I am struck, as ever, with the sense that my Dad's knee-jerk view of himself may be one of a bottom line. It never seems to occur to him that his kids generally accept the concept of spending time with him; time that does not involve pedantic and critical suggestions about Our Lives and the Way We live it, tied in concert with some cash outlay. That we may enjoy our time with him, and that we like it when he's simply content himself.   It must be difficult to keep us at bay and at the same time, feel duty-bound to ensure our individual progression through life by his own financial investment. (Which, let's be honest, is probably a far-sight more like venture-type speculation than a solid financial investment.) It's as if he's afraid that we'll take or deplete (what he views as) his only bargaining chip (money) and thus, steal away his power (have no need for him anymore). It's a terribly confusing dynamic, especially to those of us trying to make an honest go of rewriting the history of This Relationship. In fact, it is not unlike a web of sorts, confounding us who are affixed to it.

      Every time two or more of us kids are gathered around the dinner table, it turns into a hotly contested argument about the state of things in the US, particularly under the peerless leadership of the Current President of the United States (heretoforth referred to as The Hedge). My parents usually play the role of The Blissfully-Convinced Republican.    Brother:  Answer me this: why the hell are we in Iraq?   Dad:  Because we're fighting The Evil that lives there.   Later..    Brother : There's absolutely no reason to go there if it weren't for the oil; that's all there is to it.   Dad : So, you're saying you wouldn't want to go to Iraq?   Brother : (Dumbfounded) Dad, why the  hell  would I want to go to there?   Dad : (Thoughtful) Well, they have dark-skinned women there.   Pause. Silence.    Dad : I thought you liked dark-skinned women!

      I've been going to the gym frequently, in a desperate attempt to meet new people and perhaps make a friend or two. The going's been rather tough, thus far.  During my workout, a dude and, ostensibly, his [slightly zaftig] girlfriend arrived, ostensibly, to do a couples workout. I went about my own business, methodically plodding through my routine. At some point, I looked up to see aforementioned Dude sitting at a bench with some 5 sets of free weights arranged around him in some speechless U pattern. I was completely irritated at this boldness. Was it really necessary to sit there and heave through all these dumbells in order to impress his girlfriend, at the expense of depriving everyone else of the right to use the equipment? For God's sake, couldn't they do their foreplay somewhere else? Somewhere not in the vicinity of those trying to finish their exercise?  Then I felt bad for being so judgmental. I mean, big deal, right? If it's helping the guy get lucky, then why should I be such a player hater? Do I really want to be a bitter, jealous person who is going to resent heavily anyone else who's getting laid on a regular basis?  No, I don't think I do.

      On Friday, I was alerted by Dad via Nextel DirectConnect, only to have the proprietress, (with whom I was working) ask for my phone, and then subsequently moan into it, "Uh, we're kind of busy right now!" while faking an orgasm. My dad was terribly confused, and then embarassed. For me, on the other hand, this was pretty much the highlight of my week.
