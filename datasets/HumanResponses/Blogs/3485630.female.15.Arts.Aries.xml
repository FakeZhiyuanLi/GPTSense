      We just finished our gig at the warehouse, i think it went pretty well.  I couldn't hear myself so i just was hoping i was in-tune.  I can't wait till Ian graduates.  He forgot that i had to be at the warehouse at 3:30 today, so he went to jennys instead.  Then when he got home he was blaming it on me.  He was like, "You shoulda walked bitch!!!".  I hate him soooooo much.  Then my mom got home today from picking up my dad at the airport, she came to see us practicing at the warehouse.  She lectured me on how i need to "ask" before i do anything.  Our practice was re-schedualed so i just showed up at three when it was re-schedualed for, and my mom got mad because i didn't call her cell and ask if i could go a little later.  What does she care??? She wasn't going to be at home anyways, she just wants to know EVERYTHING that's going on in my life.  Then she watched our ENTIRE concert, and insisted on driving me home afterwords.  I was gonna help load the truck back up, and she was just sitting alone at a table.  AAARGGGHHHH!!!  This summer she's gonna make me study for next year, she's buying me all of the textbooks for sophmore year and making me read them all.  Let me have a LIVE PLEASE!!!!!!!  Anyways, today was pretty nice, i watched harry potter all afternoon (DRACO IS SOOOOOOOO F***ING HOT!!!)  I guess i'll be studying tomorrow all day.  I NEED at least a B on my math final to pass the class, i hate that class.  My teacher, johnson, thinks i have a learning disability so they are going to test me.  I have been tested by SOO many people for an LD but the can't find anything big wrong with me.  I guess they'll just keep trying till they can stamp me on the forehead with the word TARD.  All i need is a lil extra help in math, i'm not that stupid...really.  This one time when i was taking a tard test (that's what i call my LD tests) they had one of those big mirror things that people watch you through.  I forgot that people are accually behind those things and i started making funny faces at the mirror!!  That day they diagnosed me w/a minor comprehention problem(don't laugh at me, i can't spell anything!!).  I can't wait till the next HP comes out, all the guys will be sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo hot!!  I could eat them all *chomp* *chomp*.  I like these blog dealies, they are fun.  Ok, there's this one dude that i like, but he never notices me...he notices everyone else, but me.  I try to make myself stand out, but to him i'll just be Jordy.  Maybe i'll just wait around, and someday he'll finally look at me and notice that i'm a lil more than just Jordy.  I'M JORDY!!!!!Maybe i should scream that in his face, tha'd be funny.  Hey, what's up? I'M JORDYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!  Damn it, now i can't do that, because for all i know he's reading this or maybe is friend will read this and tell him about it and he'll be like, "if anyone says I'M JORDY!!!! Then i'll just ignore them more".  Eh, i doubt that, i don't even think he knows i have a blog, good.  I'll just say his name over and over again....nah, maybe not.  What do u think i should do to get his attention?  He likes this other girl though, and i don't know if i should do anything to interfere just incase this makes him super duper happy.  The least thing i wanna do is make him worried or stressed or sad.  I'll stop rambling now, and write a list of all that things that make me happy so i can be happy again.  Everyone should read this list and i might make them happy too.  This is not in order of importance. 1. warm sheets out of the dryer. 2. waking up on saturday morinings, and knowing that i could either get up or stay in bed. 3. Having my brothers be nice to me. 4. Orange Sherbert 5. Seeing my guy smile. 6. knowing that i have numerous packages of sugary candy hidden under my bed. 7. Dancing w/a good dancer. 8. Shaking my tambourine 9. People laughing at my stupid jokes. 10. People knowing my name, when i don't know them. 11. Being noticed by people, anyone really. 12. Eye contact w/hot dudes in the hallway. 13. Wearing my favorite jeans and me chucks. 14. I bet you're bored now so i'll leave 15. If you're still readin this the you have no life 16. Bye This song is for that one special boy that i was talking about earlier. "White Flag"  I know you think that I shouldn't still love you,  Or tell you that. But if I didn't say it, well I'd still have felt it  where's the sense in that?   I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder  Or return to where we were   I will go down with this ship  And I won't put my hands up and surrender  There will be no white flag above my door  I'm in love and always will be   I know I left too much mess and  destruction to come back again  And I caused nothing but trouble  I understand if you can't talk to me again  And if you live by the rules of "it's over"  then I'm sure that that makes sense   I will go down with this ship  And I won't put my hands up and surrender  There will be no white flag above my door  I'm in love and always will be   And when we meet  Which I'm sure we will  All that was there Will be there still  I'll let it pass  And hold my tongue  And you will think  That I've moved on....   I will go down with this ship  And I won't put my hands up and surrender  There will be no white flag above my door  I'm in love and always will be   I will go down with this ship  And I won't put my hands up and surrender  There will be no white flag above my door  I'm in love and always will be   I will go down with this ship  And I won't put my hands up and surrender  There will be no white flag above my door  I'm in love and always will be

      Well, this is my first blog EVER.  I've wanted one of these, but i never had the time to write one.  I dunno who'll read this, i guess anyone can i guess.  Well, today was fun.  Nothing interesting.  I had lunch w/Maja today and met ben Brizell.  Today i accually talked to this one dude that i'd had my eye on for a LONG TIME!!!  He's a senior so i figured what the hell?  I'm watching friends, i like friends.  I wish it wasn't over.  I'm glad freshmen year is pretty much over, but i'll miss all of my senior pals.  I don't wanna be a sophmore, they are like 2nd year freshmen.  Does anyone but me have dreams of people and they are really really nice in your dream, and when you go to school you like them, but they don't really like you.  Damn you dreams!!! Eh, ian's having a keg of root beer at his grad party, that's sooo awsome!  At Ian's party i'm gonna try and see how many times i can hit on Jon Stack, and maybe get a reply.  Hee hee, i'm brutal.  I hope something interesting happens soon, my life is boring.  I can't wait till the new freshmen come into band, it'll be soooooo much fun! I was at rocks yesterday and i saw a table of these completely hot guys, and i couldn't help but stare.  After that i felt so wierd, like someone that'll never get a guy like that.  I felt inferior, and ugly.  I don't often feel like that, i'm a confident person.  I hope that that feeling goes away, it's lingering.  I think like I'll leave now, and continue eating my M&M's. Bye, -Jordy
