      The Science section of The New York Times is one of the best reasons to read that paper. I didn't blog the day that this was published, but the link still works:  urlLink Revenge   I've read many obervations about how our genetic makeup has affected our psychology (mostly sexist articles about men being hunters and women being gatherers used as justification for a hunter to sit on the couch and demand a beer from the gatherer) but this one struck me as particularly intriguing. The idea that we all have a sense of justice and that our actions can often be sourced to an imagined slight on which we act in a manner consistant with our sense of justice. To which the other person reacts, thinking that he/she didn't deserve such a punishment. On and on till someone calls a stop.  Raised, as I was, in a passive/agressive world where I was forced to constantly read the subtext of everything I grew to be overly sensitive to slights. More than a few arguments in my life have started because I mis-read an attack on me and then responded as befitted my sense of justice only to be seen as the one who started the fight in the first place.

      At its Greek roots, the gym (gymnazein, to exercise naked) is the big open place where men get oiled up and wrestle naked. For a sexually terrified (not just awkward, absolutely terrified—I’d lose my soul if some evil woman seduced me. I’d also not be able to say “no”….) 13 year old being required to change clothes in front of dozens of other awkward teens was just about the worst thing that happened in my adolescence. Some Sean-Penn-in-Fast-Times-at-Ridgemont-High asshole used to call me “stinky” and hit me as he pushed me out of the way of his locker.   I spent most of the rest of my secondary school years trying to avoid ever going into a gym locker room again.  Almost 20 years later, fat suffocating my internal organs, I went back. After 3 years of fits and starts I’m at 13 weeks of regular workouts (and twice as many pounds shed). And more than 20 years have done nothing for my locker-room anxieties. Indeed, they are worsened by my adult knowledge of the world of micro-biology.   I workout at a downtown Seattle gym, which means that I have a larger assortment of odd characters than I encountered at the suburban gym I started at 3 years ago. I’m glad that I didn’t start here—I’d have never gone back.   They gay men flirting with each other doesn’t bother me (ok, just a little when they start the half-naked foreplay…), it’s just a little shocking for a sheltered lad from Utah, and the mentally unstable with poor attention to their bodily functions can be excused (except the one who glared at me from far too close a distance because I was at “his” sink) as long as I don’t have to get too close to their mistakes (ick) or smells, but the ones I just can’t get over are the 50, or more, year old men who seem to have no sense of shame at all. Just let it all hang out there, grandpa. We *want* to see your wrinkly ass and grey pubic hairs—that’s nifty.   Must be a generational thing (as opposed to just my neuroses). They just don’t seem to notice or care. Then again, maybe it is just me—I need to wear my giant, white, beach-towel around me at all times. Maybe it’s part of getting old—they don’t care what, if anything, anyone else thinks. That loss of inhibitors that becomes worse (better?) as we age.   So I go back 3 days a week (I have the weight set at home and I can, actually, walk on pavement twice a week—don’t always need that treadmill…), wrapped in my tent of a towel, plastic shower slippers with drainage holes on, and with my preventative, anti-fungal, foot powder. I feel too much like Niles Crane and look forward to finally moving to a new place and buying a treadmill of my own.

      "Looking for your fingerprints  I find them in coincidence  and make my faith to grow"    --Suzanne Vega     urlLink This  from The New York Times as a reminder of the unending depths of the gullibility of humanity.  I have looked, briefly, at some of the people on blogspot who share my taste in books and movies and I have been very disappointed. On my list are things like “Foucault's Pendulum” and “The Ninth Gate.” What is difficult for me are the number of people who like such stories not because they are well told and captivating for the mind, but because they actually believe that the stories are real!   This gets into muddy waters, of course, because—as the Greeks noticed—all words are lies; illusions crafted by the sounds of our voices and the shapes of our letters. As my most feared college professor, “Dr. Doom,” often said: “all history is rhetoric.” But does that give us carte blanche to hack up old churches searching for the Holy Grail? It becomes a question of reasonableness and consistency.   We can believe that magical lines of energy intersect hither and yon, waiting for us to tap into them, but what evidence to we have? What kind of energy? How do we measure it? Energy is an event—vibrations at a molecular level. We can measure those vibrations. Do we find any lines of vibrations crisscrossing the planet?  Well and good for science, but what about history? Perhaps there was a grail and perhaps someone did hide it and leave clues to its location in the architecture of a church in Scotland. What is our evidence? A work of fiction—not the historical kind of, say, Suetonious, but the modern kind which says right on its inside cover: “fiction.” Not the strongest place to begin, but so we must.   I can’t speak to the specifics of “The DaVinci Code” I haven’t time to spend (waste?) reading it. I can, however, return to the master of all such works: “Foucault’s Pendulum;” my favorite book of the last 100 years. People who like it seem to forget one key point: the story is made up! Not just that Umberto Eco wrote it as fiction, but that the characters in it make up the story within the story. As they say to each other: “everything must be connected” even if they have to make it up. Everything must mean everything. Patterns in the chaos. Meaning from the madness.   Indeed, that is the whole point of “Foucault’s Pendulum:” we make our own realities and those realities are very seductive and powerful. The surprise of the four friends when they find out that dozens of “secret societies” are all busy running around looking for a purpose. These groups find a purpose in the fiction of these four editors and then proceed to kill over it.   Nothing has power to influence and lead people like these quests for magical powers, the grail, the philosopher’s stone, the elixir of life. Everything falls under the categories they represent: endless life, endless wealth, endless power. Dot.com bubbles, cures for cancer, wars. Our emergence from the Dark Ages began with Christian monks looking for more and finding it in Jewish Cabbala. The great figures of science during and after the Renaissance are less well known for their failed quests for immortality—gravity, calculus, astrological navigation, were all an afterthought.   So go look for the holy grail, but make sure you donate to the church’s remodeling fund while you are there. Don’t see the actual beauty of the architecture and art—just subsidize it for those few of us who actually see what is there instead of what we want to be there.

      I think that most resonably intelligent people (ok, that does exclude the majority of Americans) suspect that George W. and those around him are stirring up troublie in Iraq in order to line their own pockets with the proceedes. The LA Times offers some  urlLink names and dollar amounts . It's really quite shocking (no-fee, login required)  Initially I find this appaling because of the number of people who had to die for these people to make their money. But if that outrages me I'd better re-think most of what I do in life. The fact is, to live is to destroy. On further reflection I still find it dispicable simply because I hate the born-again, manifest-destiny shit of dubbya and company. But are those reasons enough to be upset by warmongers and war profiteers?   No, I think that Livinstone and Woolsey (see the article) bother me because they do the "investment circut" thing.   You see, it isn't just that I grew up Mormon but that I gew up lower-class Mormon. This means that I saw my parents be at the bottom of every scam that blew by the Wasatch Front. I remember my father getting his first bar-b-q grill by attending a time share pitch. He and my mother went just to get the free grill. They would have actually bought one week a year in a shitty condo in fucking Galviston Texas (or name your own lousy vacation spot) if they had any money (it was all tied up in trampolenes and plankton). So to hear about these shit-bags trupeting Iraq investment oppertunities just makes my hair stand on end. They aren't making money off oil or military logistical support, no they are making money off the *idea* of oil and military logictical support.    Bush Politics  gotta love a line like  urlLink this   "The Republicans' campaign is all about scapegoating John Kerry for the ills of modernity. It's about exploiting homophobia, provincialism and cultural insecurity. Or, as they put it, values."  Ok, Washington Post editorials are not exactly "fair and balanced" but they are at least witty. If I can stomach The Wall Street Journal's right leaning surely I can handle some left leaning from The Post. Fox "News" can fuck themselves.

      Paul Krugman is a controversial economist who writes a few columns each week for The New York Times. He is controversial because he has a liberal slant on a traditionally republican area of expertise. His column in  urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/13/opinion/13KRUG.html">The Times  today makes the audacious suggestion that the collapse of Enron was a good thing (no-fee registration required)  Besides the fact that he’s correct about Enron, he makes a much more disturbing point—the religious zealotry of Tom Delay (Texas congressman, leader of the House, and the mastermind behind the Texas gerrymandering). How and why this man has so much power (and how it ties to Ken Lay and Enron) is a striking example of why the Puritans run this country.   The LA Times yesterday had an  urlLink article  (no-fee registration required) on the extreme conservatism of George W. Bush vs. the mainline views of George H.W. Bush. At the start of the article is a scene from a 1988 Republican rally where George W. won over the hard-line conservatives in the room (daddy was just too liberal for them) by telling his own conversion story. He stood up and stated his Christian beliefs. That’s all it took for a room of good little Puritans to be won over: a statement of belief.   Why is it we are even debating a constitutional amendment on same-sex marriage? What does the definition of marriage have to do with the constitution? Does the constitution affirm the King James translation of the Bible as the only true and inspired translation? Does it even affirm the Christian God as the only god? No, and if these brainless Bible-thumpers would bother to read anything besides a book whose original language they don’t bother to learn in a translation which is almost as closed to them as Hebrew and Greek and even when put into a readable language (think NRSV or such) is still so completely out of historical context as to be akin to trying to apply the Athenian Tribute Lists to modern day Cambodia they would know that the first constitutional amendment was all about keeping their God out of our politics!  But it works—Tom Delay gets Texas and George W. has enough support that no one seriously pursues his hijacking of the constitutional voting process. It goes back to belief. Delay and George W. say, with conviction, that they believe that God is using them to promote a “biblical worldview” in politics. What this means—and why the rest of us are so angry and scared—is that they believe in a theocratic monarchy supported by a fanatical armed force. The Bible teaches that such a government is God’s government. Any means necessary to achieve this form of rule are acceptable—God is behind them.   Do most Americans agree? Do they want this? Well, no—but no one asked the Canaanites if they wanted to be slaughtered either (of course they weren’t, at least not as the Bible says they were, but history didn’t matter to the authors of the Bible, why should it matter to the readers?). They simply did not matter because they were idol-worshippers. And so are the rest of us. Ask a good Christian what modern-day idolatry means. Specifics will vary, but the theme is the same: anyone who isn’t part of “us.”  So belief turns nasty—if you don’t agree with our vision of the future, then all bets are off. Thoughts become words and actions. Can’t convert them? Kill them. Get a few of our own in the crossfire? No matter—God will sort them out.   We don’t want to see the Nazis as human, but they are just like all of us. Specific fanaticisms are merely symptoms, human nature is the disease. We can overcome, but it so much easier to not.   Besides, George W. has vision—he behaves like he knows more than we do, maybe he’s right.

      Why must we believe? My theist friends, particularly the spiritualist type, insist that I cannot be an atheist because it is impossible to prove an absence.   Bullshit  They don’t think of themselves as strong believers, but they allow the possibility—they say that we all must. Yet they lean towards theism. That is itself a belief without knowledge. They don’t *know* that there is a God. Indeed, no one can offer any externally verifiable proof, yet they all still believe. So why can’t I believe that there is no God? If their belief does not rely on any proof why must  mine?   And there‘s the rub. They invented the God, they made up the rules. Like a child’s game they change the rules whenever things don’t go their way. Look at the argument carefully and you find that for them, belief is a result of some external force, some spiritual entity graces them with faith, with belief. How can one have belief without the external entity? To them, one cannot. But when you start to peel away their argument you see that it is circular: belief is required in order to have belief. God must exist in order to give us belief in God.   Strip out their catch-22 and we are left with belief as a hope that what we want to be true is or will be, in fact, true. Anyone can believe anything, it is how we survive the uncertainty of the future. We don't know if we will die on our way home from work tonight, we drive because we believe that we will not. I don't do good things because I believe that God will reward me, I do them because there is no God and if we don't take care of each other then no one will.  There is no God. I know it.

      I've found myself taking a step backwards lately. Where I used to spend two hours in front of the computer every day reading news off the AP wire and through a subscription to the Wall Street Journal online I now wake up at 05:00 every day in order to give myself an hour to read through The New York Times—in print! I then spend an hour at lunch doing the same with The Wall Street Journal—again in print.   In addition, instead of spending an hour every day playing mindless online games (like “bejeweled” or “alchemy”) I now spend as much time doing the NY Times crossword puzzle. Oh it’s not much less mindless—I cheat shamelessly.   Have I lost my technophilia? I sometimes go days without sitting at my home PC! It was once my best friend.   Perhaps.   It certainly isn’t information overload. The information on the web just isn’t as good or as accessible as it used to be. Try searching for something—Google, MSN, Yahoo, it doesn’t matter; ads are the first thing you see. They’ve skewed the results.   I could just read quality online, though—I still subscribe to WSJ online and the NY Times is free. Well, sort of. Free if you can ignore the flashing banners. At least the print versions have the decency to make the ads visually attractive. And the layout in print lends itself to reading better than online. Too much time staring at the computer all day as it is, my eyes need a break.   I think, in the end, it is about quality. Read Yahoo news and you get up to the minute crap. Everyone repeats the same story on their own sites, exactly as the AP wrote it. Do a search sometime for a string of words from an article, see how many times it shows up exactly as printed. Sure the NY Times has had some egg on its face of late (nothing like the Post though! Way to go Rupert!) but they also have quite a string of wins to their credit. And the right-leaning WSJ? Well, I just skip the editorial pages… at least they aren’t owned by News corp.   The strange thing is that by reading the print news I seem to find stories that no one of my technophile peers has seen or read. And I’ve read all the stories that they do. It’s, by analogy, like bio-diversity. They read their homogenous, wide-spread, manufactured, news and think that they have a good grasp on things. I read my “heirloom” news, old seeds, developed for flavor and resistance, and end up always being immune to the information bugs that wipe them out.   As for crosswords, well, I guess I just like to intimidate people. I’m not really all that smart, I just play like I am. Did I mention that I keep the crossword on my desk all day? That I carry it to meetings? No? hmmmm. Must be slipping….

       urlLink This  from the Washington Post. They are usually a left-leaning rag so I was surpirsed by the article about the author's difficulity in choosing for whom to vote.   I just needed to take issue with a few things: "that [terrorisms] root causes lie in poverty and state failure"  WRONG. It was common belief before (and apparently after) 9/11 that terrorists were poor folk with no hope left in life. What else could explain their decision to give up life just to hurt someone else? They must not have had much to live for. Quaint, but untrue. The profiles of the 9/11 hijackers are more chillingly close to middle-class than most people expected. See, it's not a life of poverty and a belief that you can have nothing more that drives people to commit such horrible acts. Turns out that it is plain old middle-class guilt. The same motivation that drives vapid young white college girls to turn vegan and "bi-curious"--they want to show just how devoted they are to their ideology. They want to show just how much they care about the ethics of their class. They want to be fanatics to show that they are more devoted than anyone elase. That, and they are too stupid to realize that they are being used.  So let's get off the poor of the planet--they are too busy trying to eek out a living to get all caught up in radical theology. The rise of terrorism has coinsided with the rise of the middle class in the Middle East--Franz Fanon be damned.    Then this: "[Kerry] refuses to support the Central American Free Trade Agreement because he says it has inadequate labor protections, even though there are real labor protections in the deal and even though the best protection for workers is the economic growth to which free trade contributes."  What?! Are you saying that sweat shops won't exist as long as goods are being sold and companies are making profits? What world is that in? Oh yeah--the US! Funny how having labor laws and worker's rights (ok, not many, but better than El Salvadore!) with government oversight spreads out the value of economic growth. I'm no socialist, but let's not pretend that the invisible hand of free markets is anything other than Greed (with a capital "G"). It's sure as hell not God!  I'm all for free trade (even as I watch my fellow computer folk loose their jobs to India) but don't think that those cheap clothes at Wal Mart come... well... cheap. They can afford to pay the Chineese worker 5 dollars a week because they don't have roads to maintain, sewage to clean, workplace saftey, or worker's comp. Send the jobs overseas, but level the playing field by forcing the other countries to raise the level of human rights to the same (low) level of our own country.  So waffle if you want to, but it's not between two good candidates, it's between a purely evil one and a mostly evil one. If you don't know which is which, then move to fucking Georgia, don a white pointy-hood, and get fat on pig parts while lamenting the days of slaves and plantations and leeches as good medicine.
