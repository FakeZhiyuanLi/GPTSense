      Went for Spiderman 2. Alright, many of you are working...stop b****ing!!! Need to get out of the house for the whole day. Feels so good adn enjoyed myself, deep in my own thoughts and dreaming and imagining. I find blogging as a good thing 'cause it lets us network and share ideas and thoughts.  WeLL, all-in-all, sorry to be a spoiler, Spidey2 was pretty eMo, in my opinion; but it could be otherwise for you out there. That's all I will say. Oh, check out the ad for Euro 2004. Damn funny. "Where's all the men?". Euro really takes the cake off everything. Yeah, sure do. Haha.  What really kicks in Euro? Comments?  Cheerio

      The terrible sense that I am feeling right now is (*gosh*), never really felt that low before, frustration. Hey, I have high self esteem. I am keeping it that way. God damn everything and every job there is.  How long does a job application takes? IS it that hard to get a job? Economist claims that jobs are abundant right now. But, where is it? Why isn't it the hotel and tourism sector? Questions and questions.     The wanderers between stars, constellations and the universe walks the plain of cyberspace. The World Wide Web, the creation of Blogs have made a revolotion in todays cyberspace, making an online diary and for those whom want to be heard. Right bloggers? Info-tech makes no boundaries, well, except for federal state laws or such. Caution.  My daily rant is about to end with a compunded sigh of frustration and sadness. My buddies are all working and being productive and me...waiting for replies from "prospected" employers.  This is my 4th day not smoking. Miss you lusciousluc!

      Oh nuts...called my friend in Mindshare and she said she forgotten to submit my job application!! Man... Sunway Lagoon Resort Hotel called, they are offering my a position as a Butler. There is non better. Nope, did not accept the job cause it would be a waste of my time going into something new. Furthermore, it wouldn't even serve a purpose in the position I applied. Banquet and Conference. YEs, I know the new Sunway Villas are nice ans exquisite, but, I am not cut out being a butler.  Anyway, no harm done. I hope the other application are doing well. I pray that it goes well. Haven't had breakfast and going for brunch.   Undeniably right.

      2nd day I had not touched a cigarette. I am going Cold-Turkey. Was watching a video-clip by The National Tobacco Campaign. Oooo, really disgusting. I have seen a smokers lungs before and a drinkers liver, in JARS. Here, the clip is real with live organs. The brain was cool though and the lung...   So, I live up to this day that I really need to quit. Don't ask me why but even without the clip or any campaign, I felt it myself. I respect my life, I love myself more than anyone else.   So, ladies and gentlemen, if you start, know how to stop or else don't.  Life is Precious Precious it seems  like a speck in the sky so vast, so open yet, we throw life away?! What has become of us we reside in complacence we dwell in ignorence Where is the Chance for  Precious life? Gone forever...innocence is taken away, never to return the fire within, will not burn, Life, has never been so precious!

      Hey boys and girls,  A very interesting topic I have read on MSN.com. About Asian women and fair skin...eevry product that comes out from beauticians assures that when applied, women can get fairer skin. Even the dark ones become fair. (no pun intended) it's in the ad on TV. You might remember.   Is it the saying that dark attracts evil? Or is it just bad feng shui? So, what do dark skin people have to say about this? What happens if every community, group wants to become fair? Maybe it is a marketing tool or conspiracy theory that if everyone uses their product, peopel become fair and there will not be anymore coloured jokes. Your say.  IS it the product or is it the people? Speak of their attitude, perception, personality or just a phase?  Comments are encourage.

      Hey boys and girls! Quite a while isn't it since I blog?   What is wrong with the world? The people? Recently, well, two days ago, a fellow citizen was beaten to death by a group of 15-20. It was a sad night for he was engage, what's more, beaten in front of his fiancee! Goodness, where were the people's integrity to help or a group to stop the fight? What has happened to society? I say that those that are involved be sentenced to life imprisonment, never to be on parole, bail. Let them suffer in their prison cell until their end of days.  It's so sad, only son, 23 y.o. lost his life just because of some dumb group of peoples' behaviour of showing off or venting their anger bacause they cannot get a woman or a girlfrien. They are such low-degenerated life. They are so repress, then, don't allow them at the famous night spot! Keep these type of people out of the good society.   Really, I think those what committed it should have life imprisonment or have them *whacked* individually by prison inmates or other people.   We wish this would not happen.

      The whole gung-ho ego oriented Dir. of company is accusing me of siphoning out information through proxies (friends/colleagues). From what I heard from them, that person was tinkering with my PC in the Co. and suddenly, made up a story that someone is copying Co. "intellectual property".   Goodness, wonder if the Dir. is paranoid or just plainly blatant in wanting to tarnish our names.  First: Dir. accused that my friends were doing it on behalf of ME! What the f**k??  Second: Stealing P&C info in the motive of selling? Where's the proof?  Third: The notion of installing MSN Messenger or enabling Win Messenger. Is it a crime (caused of unproductivity, we know). But, why did that ever come up in the 1st place? Fourth: Threatened to tarnish our reputation as fresh grads/entry level.  It is uncounted for that the Dir. has to do that? We won't know the reason. DAMN! We shall see.

      Haven't been doing anything lately but surfing the net, reading and visiting friends, plus clearing my room for a new computer table. Cool design. There'll be a picture soon when I get it. Gotta love digital photography. Second interview is up, this morning at 9.30am till 2.30pm. Taking candidates around to meet the clients I think and giving us assignments or overview of our daily task, I presume. Nothing fancy.   Wonder how does it feel to get a job, where once before you not having one? I don't know. I have the least of all feelings except that I dread the days. Brother is still in Singapore, no-one to throw "tantrums" at...Hehe! Oh, evil.  Ex-colleagues are frustrated and bored. Scared and fear the Iron Fist. Goodness. Why do we live in fear? Because of being unemployed? Colleague also suffering from loneliness cause spouse-to-be is in Indonesia. Funny couple in my opinion. Does the funniest and wackiest things.  Sent an application to an Event Management company as an Event Executive. I'll be glad they call. No words from Hilton. Sentral is full. Shang is full except for waitering....man, what a life. But, to top that all, a barbeque this Sat where I am the Chef! Woohoo...potato salad, baked sweet potatoes, mesclun salad, lamb chops, chicken wings, thighs, drumsticks...the works, not to mention beers and whiskeys, yah, and punch.  See ya.

        Hey all!   &nbsp;  This weekend will be my first camping trip. Saturday and Sunday! So nice. How it came up you ask?  While having a drink with my friend, Jade, conversantly wished that I could or get a group of close friends for camping. Then, she said she goes often with her dad, uncle and others.  &nbsp;    THE CONVERSATION    &nbsp;  Lam:   You know, I wish I could experience camping...    Jade:  Camping, I use to follow my dad and uncle for camping since young. So, I am kinda 'veteran' *smiles*   Lam:   Oh, why not we organise a camping trip with the rest of   the gang.    Jade:  That'll be great, but will they want to embark on this?   Lam:   Well, I don't know either. Let's do some analysis and deduction...one, has toilet issues (on spades, holes and leaves), eeeew leech, why camp where we can party? Is it safe? I suppose not?    Jade:  Well, we can still try. Better inform them and then ask them to apply for leave on monday or something. We have to work this out.   Lam:   Yups. We have to. I mean, we are always going to clubs and partying all night long...'lepaking' at friends place all night long, watching TV, doing nothing productive but deducing that some group and people are crazy and boisterous.    Jade:  hehehe, you're right.   Lam:   so, what do you ......    &nbsp;  Well folk, that's how the idea came up. Camping. Wanted to go camping when I was in Secondary School under Scouts but family did not approve to that...so sad. Now, I get the chance! Woo hooo!  &nbsp;  So, few days after that conversation, think it dawn on her that she hadn't camped for a while. Called me to check if I have any plans this weekend. Say no. (Actually tentative) she said going camping. I accepted and here I am, blogging bout it! Can't wait for that day...  &nbsp;  Alright, going to bed now. Catcha some time later!  &nbsp;  zzz.zz.Z.Z...z.z.>Z.>..z.z.Z

       It's a gloomy day,  rain pouring down on my window,  I look put, it's just grey,  grey as in my feelings,  feelings of down, but not up either,    Oh, a clap of thunder,  ghastly, horrific!!! I must say.  Is there Heaven up there?  Is there Hell below?  I don't know,  None knows.    Together with my brainchild,  I yearn for it, an addiction,  Oh, another clap of thunder,  When will the lightning strike,  Strike with all thy might!   Heaven strikes Hell with force.    No, this cannot be....  Undo for God sake.  What is God?  I lay down for good.  My fate. I shall not run.

       Can I consider myself a city boy? But I went camping, canoeing, staying outdoors....is is still city boy? I sometimes wonder.... Anyway, just arrived back home after camping one day in the jungle. Really fun, even that you just sit around (mind you, don't let the movie fool you) there's no campfire; only at times due to season and a bitch to start). :)    &nbsp;  So, we arrived at the base of Gunung Nuang about 800 ft. above sea level. Took a 3 1/2 hour long trek up steep muddy slopes, partially tarred and just plain laterite ground. Shoes dirty, leeches cling (almost got it, was clinging to the tent holder)...IT WAS ATTRACTED TO MY BLOOD!!! Vampires.. there's a story bout leeches back during my younger days but will tell about it sometime this week. Stay tuned.    &nbsp;  Alright, back to the trekking part. Yah, mud, laterite, leaves scrathing, bone aching and muscle cramps...oh my got one while trekking up...can't move my upper legs but kept on moving cause camping, they say, you play a mental game...if you say "I can't do it" means you can't already and should head back down....vice versa.    &nbsp;  We reach a campsite, rest and some had lunch cause the designated site was further up....so, those hungry ate while the others (only 4 of us) just rest ourselves. Then, was back to trekking up; this time, roots, mud, moss and lotsa ground shrubs, grass, etc...     &nbsp;  At the campsite, made tent, unpack, prepare dinner of Rendang Ayam (packet), Rice, maggi Assam and Kari....luncheon meat, fried dace (can) and cabbage. Sumptuos meal I might say when up in the hills...MAggi mee and luncheon meat just tastes so nice....compared when you are home and back on firm ground. WOW THE POWER OF NATURE AND BODY!!!    &nbsp;  Then, we just sat back, talk, joke, started a small campfire but did not turn well cause the twigs were too wet and hard to ignite and 2 members dranks Chivas Regal whiskey of 1litre. Me and friend just chatted along through the nite till 1.30am    &nbsp;  Tell you what, when you are free from everything, time just seems to pass so, so, I mean REALLY slowly. It felt like time stood still.....cool.    &nbsp;  Next morning, had breakfast, jump into the waterfell early in morning, (WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOO) cold and freezing...does wake you up.... packed, and left the campsite with our 1 night rubbish to throw at the bottom of the mountain. Washed our legs, face and hands....change clothes and home...    &nbsp;  Back to PCs, dust, smoke, and fast-paced life....    &nbsp;  - the end -

      Well, all hell breaks loose as my dad's notebook/laptop is out of commission for the meantime. Something to do with motherboard or something according to his technician. Cost RM 2000 to change. Time to get a new one....Well, (touch-wood) that my PC does not crash on me once more.  This is the 3rd BLOODY time I am reformating and installing windows again. I am on the process of migrating to Open Source Software, which I am using now. Free downloads. Free support. Pay once and that's it unlike propriety and commercial software.  Learning and learning how to operate Linux and other Open Source Software. Yes, I know that it does not contribute to the economics, but look deeper....it creates a knowledge society of common users who is able to manipulate and develop new software. Isn't the government encouraging a knowledge society?  Sometimes, I wish that I had taken up IT as a profession. I could be in the testing and development team. Love network management and enterprise security.  Well, dreams are always dreams...

      Nature of bloggin'. It was a great day today. Had lunch with ol' friends and had a good chat. Tomorrow, meeting the Dir. of Studies of TCHT. Might get to working sooner than I thought. Well, unless something better turns up.  Sometimes, I think that I pursued the wrong studies....should have taken up IT? Or journalism course. Since my flair for writing and my love to read, everything in front of me without filtering can make the best candidate as an author. Creating newsletter, writing my thought, feelings, events, etc. etc. etc. etc.  I wonder why so many colleges are still offering single or only one type of studies, which , by example, hospitality, gearing you towards hospitality and tourism only? How come business finance makes use of the proprietary software and such. They get to use the great stuff...what we get? Manipulate MS FrontPage, Access and what is "WYSIWIG" and also fidelio. The blue and green screen and POS systems.  We shoud be able to use, the least, to operate other systems like Linux, Mac or Sun Microsystems! Why only Windows? Don't know cause we are not able to operate it fully. Well, it's a selfish world.  Alrighty, aint gonna rant and complain more 'coz I'm real sleepy.
