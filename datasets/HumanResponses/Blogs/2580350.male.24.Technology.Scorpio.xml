      Getting out from the college is nice but I would like you to get prepared for the next battle of life – work. When we are in college, so many things are taken for granted. Just like you said, you have people of common interest (most of them are shrewd but that is another story) and then you have the facility (so called) of hostel and food. I mean you don’t have to fight for them. The biggest change that you’ll notice in your life will be the fight for survival.  The fight begins the moment you land up at the pace you work – find a place to live, find roommates to live with, arrange how the food will be managed, what about laundry and house cleaning. Overall a total nightmare. Going to a known place will give you distinct advantage as this is a place where and you have the people with same cultural background and speaking the same language as you do. Had you been to some city / country with different culture and background, things would have been much worse.  After this fight for managing these things, the real fight comes – pressure to perform. At work you’ll see all kind of people. Your colleagues who will always try to beat you in every aspect of life, your bosses who will try to take every advantage of you and will overload with all the work you can do in 24 hours (not 8 hours) and of course you have to deal with this on your own and the support of parents gets diminished during this phase. Then of course there will be long working hours and erratic schedule. You’ll have to make sure you balance your office and personal life in the right way so that nothing suffers.  I am not trying to scare you or something but this is a reality of life and you have to live with this. Things look bit complicated in the beginning but evevtually this phase passes away and few years down the line if you look at it, you’ll say – Hmm… this wasn’t too bad.

      Pretty good movie... Loaded with emotional stuff.   The female actor has a non-curable disease, falls for a womanizer, womanizer turns into nice guy, falls in love with the dying lady, some drama and finally a long climax.   Cenrtal Park at NY had been captured beautifully in the movie although this is not the first movie which tried to capture the entire park.   Some characters like female lead's grand ma don't add much value to the movie.  Overall a recommended movie ut I would advice to keep some tissues at hand.  These guys are better than the Indian directors and story writes who for the sake of making audiances happy make an really impossible operation successful and even bring back life to characters in the movie after they have been declared dead. The funny part is it's not the doctors who revive the actor. Most of the time it's other actors' hue and cry that brings back life to the character. If that does not work some deity would be kind enough in the movie so that it grnats life back to the character. The actor gets up from the death bed and goes and kills the bad guys. Great ending.   Actually these guys are also not at fault. The movies where the lead character dies in the end have not been successful at the box office. For instance Dil Se was a disaster at box office. But it was one of the best movies I ever got to see. More about Dil Se later...

      Harry Potter 3 is on the darker side of the world and it seems that there has been a deliberate effort on director’s side to drain the colors out of the movie. But the best thing about these movies is Hermione. I am so impressed by her character and the female playing the part in the movie is doing a justice to the novel character. More about this later...

      I happened to see Shrek 2 last week. What I read in the reviews actually depressed me before going to the movie. There was mention of a sequel never been able to out shine the original movie (except Toy Story 2) and that the characters had gone stale from the first movie. The reviews also projected donkey as the mean animal who won’t understand Shrek and his newly wed wife’s feelings.  So I didn’t have many expectations while going into the movie. But the review writer was completely wrong.   The movie is more hilarious than the first one. Although the characters have more or less remained the same but the surprise package was Puss in the Boots. I’ll leave it to you to watch the movie to figure it out how stylish and cute he is. And 100 points for guessing who is paying the voice in the background. Because once you guess that, you’ll immediately fall in love with the character.  The donkey is as stupid as he can be and nothing much has changed so I am sure if you liked him in the first part, performance in this one will not disappoint you. Shrek is the usual stubborn guy but in this movie it is shown that the only thing that can change a man’s (or an Ogre’s) stubbornness is the love of a lady.  Rest of the characters are also very refined and the instances of American things in the movie like Starbucks’, Mission Impossible clip etc. actually make the movie a fun to watch.  It is amazing how much the world of animation has improved as you are able to identify with the cartoon characters which used to be the case with actors and actresses on the screen. I think DreamWorks has already started working on Shrek 3 and 4 and looking at the second part, I am hopeful they can meet the high bar set by the first two parts.  I would definitely recommend the movie to the ones who have watched the first part and definitely to the ones who have not seen the first part.  For those who haven’t seen the first part, the leading lady is voiced by Cameron Diaz. In the first part the character had distinct similarity with the actress so it was easy to identify her voice. In this movie you’ll take some time to recognize her.  That’s all for now.
