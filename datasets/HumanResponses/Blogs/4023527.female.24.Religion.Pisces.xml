      NATAL DAY-that's the name of the huge harbour festival happening in Halifax-Metro this long weekend.&nbsp; All of the tall ships come into the harbour to be toured, etc.&nbsp; I haven't quite understood yet why it's called Natal Day, but I think it has something to do with the birth of Halifax-Metro.&nbsp; There's a bunch of Acadians doing stuff, and buskers, and TONNES of beer gardens serving, you guessed it, ALEXANDER KEITH'S.&nbsp; Went to the harbour last night, and looked around a bit-might venture down this evening as well, i think there's this thing happening called 'Natal Idol'-should be funny.&nbsp; ANYWHO-lunch is ready, better jet.&nbsp; LATERZ.

      Just like the title says, that little cute apartment I was looking at is now MINE!&nbsp; And for the rough price of $625/mo. (not too bad for fully furnished, everything included type of place), it now belongs to me (on a month-to-month leasing process!).&nbsp; I am very relived, and even excited.&nbsp; I'm pumped to go 'HOME' tonight, and put all of my junk away in the huge, gigantic wall unit.&nbsp; Dropped $150 on groceries, etc., MAN, that always hurts.&nbsp; SOOO, what&nbsp;have I been up to in the last few days, you ask?&nbsp; Quite a bit, but i'm not sure if I can recall everything?!&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the&nbsp;apartment finalization, I guess I've somewhat sem-started working.&nbsp; Today Pastor and I went through a bunch of stuff I'll be doing here.&nbsp; Lots of Sunday School related ministry, which I was expecting, but looks like I'll be heading it up (can you say, 'PRINCIPAL MESERVIA?').&nbsp; And lots of music, organ stuff (they have NO accompanist here, so I'd like to bail 'em out).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My job is finally turning into a reality, and I'm getting pretty pumped for it.&nbsp; We have VBS here in 2 weeks, so there's a bunch of prep. work that needs to still happen.&nbsp; OH, and the weekend it's 'Natal Day' (something about Halifax-Metro's Birth or something), and the tall ships are coming in, as well as a big fireworks display over the harbour-I LOVE FIREWORKS.&nbsp; Hmmmmm, what else should I say?&nbsp; I think my friend Lisa's suppose to come to town pretty soon, so I'm kinda pumped about that.&nbsp; ANYWHO, that should be it for now.&nbsp; LATERZ.

      YES-today I felt adventuresome and decided to hop on the transit all by my lonesome (what motivated me was a free art gallery pass).&nbsp; SO, I headed on down to the ferry at Alderney Landing (had a bit of trouble locating the terminal), jumped on the ferry, and got off in Halifax.&nbsp; Walked around a little bit (and by little, i mean LITTLE-i think i only covered a 2 block radius the entire time i was there-guess i was afraid of getting LOST!), and found the Art Gallery.&nbsp; I've never been to a REAL art gallery before, so this was quite a nice treat.&nbsp; Lots of exhibits based on Nova Scotia's famous Tall Ships, but the more interesting exhibits were the&nbsp;modern ones.&nbsp; This artist named Gary Hill had this crazy mofo of a thing that he called 'art'-this pitch black&nbsp;hallway with projections of blurry black and white photos on the walls.&nbsp; I was too afraid that it would turn out to be performance art or something, so i quickly turned around and found my way downstairs!&nbsp; After that hopped back on the ferry, and when i landed in dartmouth, i started walking, trying to find the apartment i'm after.&nbsp; Found it after 15 min. of searching, and it was reaffirmed my 'want' of living in that area-right by a lake, and a beautiful old heritage area.&nbsp; SO, from there I hopped back on the bus, but i was on the wrong side of the street, so i j-walked right in front of the oncoming bus, but, alas, i was not hit, but welcomed aboard.&nbsp; The bus took me to Penhorn Mall (thank goodness-'cause that's where I was headed), and whilst I was in Wal-Mart, this crazy guy ran past me and hid behind the rack i was standing at, on his cell phone.&nbsp; I eavesdropped, and heard, 'they're in the jewellery section, i'm going in'.&nbsp; SO, I followed him, and sure enough, he busted these 2 ladies shoplifting.&nbsp; VERY EXCITING (and sad, OF COURSE!).&nbsp; Now I am back at the Maffett's and just enjoyed a nice steak dinner.&nbsp; I talked to the apartment guy on the phone, and I'm filling out an app. tomorrow-i'm praying that it's all i hope it to be.&nbsp; That's enough for now.&nbsp; LATERZ.  PS-the link will take you to the place I'm looking at.&nbsp; Go under dartmouth listings, and then find 'sulivan suites.'

      Like the title says, i've been a nova scotian for a little less than 4 days.&nbsp; So, does that mean that I should be well-seasoned?&nbsp; I DON'T THINK SO!&nbsp; Things are pretty different out here-the weather for one, but also, it's very rocky.&nbsp; I went with the Maffett's (pastor and family who i am staying with) for a walk and some fishing, and the bugs were HORRIBLE.&nbsp; At the inlet we went to, there were all of these crazy plants growing along side the path, and even some poison ivy-YIKES.&nbsp; This morning was my first church service here, and I was INDUCED, I mean, uh, INDUCTED (what a strange word?!).&nbsp; There were only 10 ppl at the service, so the singing is fairly limited, and they use cds and this thing called a digital hymnal (I absolutely DESPISE midi!) as accompaniament.&nbsp; ANYWHO, we stuck around for an hour chatting over coffee, which, for all who know me, know coffee time is one of my favourite times-so I was pleasantly surprised!&nbsp; Everyone is super friendly-i think that is the benefit of such a small congregation.&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't explored Halifax yet, but I hope to do that soon.&nbsp; Carla just gave me a free pass to the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, so maybe I'll do that tomorrow.&nbsp; I'm hoping to tour the Alexander Keith's Brewery sometime this week as well, so I'll keep you all informed (i know you're dying to know, kirb!).&nbsp; Better go, grub's almost ready.&nbsp; For the benefit of the readers,&nbsp;I hope things sound&nbsp;more exciting as time goes on!&nbsp; LATERZ.

      SOOOOO, here I am writing in this here, um, BLOG-following in the footsteps of my good friend Kirb!&nbsp; Looks like I've joined the geek-club as well, but saves time on emails, etc.&nbsp; ANYWHO-I've arrived in Dartmouth, and things are going just fine here.&nbsp; I haven't actually started working yet, but that will start Monday.&nbsp; I've been apartment hunting quite a bit, and have had no luck-what a frustrating process!&nbsp; Hmmmm.....what else do you put in these things?&nbsp; I wanna keep my life somewhat anonymous and private, so, maybe I'll stop there, so that I remain mysterious?!&nbsp; It's REALLY humid here, and I kinda miss the HOT west coast weather that I left behind.&nbsp; My plane trip was not too shabby-on Air Canada, if you travel to Montreal, you get a meal AND a movie (hard to believe after the Winnipeg fiasco!).&nbsp; Since my trip, i've been experiencing a wee bit of jet lag, believe it or not.&nbsp; My body is not liking the change.&nbsp; I better jet, but I just might be back, and write some more.&nbsp; LATERZ.

      THAT'S the name that I burst out laughing at last night whilst watching the Olympics-'And the silver medal goes to Peter van den Hoogenband'.  MAN, what a name!  Don't get me wrong, I love the Dutch-who doesn't?  ANYWHO, this is the week I've been waiting a LONG time for-VBS WEEK.  I absolutely LOVE VBS, and a group of peeps and youts from waterloo are out to help us with it!  They're totally prepared and have lots of cool stuff for us to do with the kids, however, we've had an average attendance of 8 kids which kinda bites the big one.  We just don't understand-there were 15 pre-registered, but all of their moms' forgot!  I guess we'll have to phone the night before next time!  I had 2 of the waterhooligans stay with me for the weekend which was an experience-a good one, at that, but i forgot what it's like to be giddy and 15-wait a sec, I was never giddy when i was 15?!  I gave my very first, sort of, tour around halifax on transit.  I think it went ok, but i'm definitely not an expert yet!  Heard from Paul Schoepp (my internship supervisor guy), and he said that he's pretty sure that I'll be going to Nicaragua, so that is my exciting news for the day!  AWESOME.  Now all I have to do is find a decent spanish class to take!  Better scat, VAN DEN HOOGENBAND (i had to include it once more-i couldn't resist!).  LATERZ.

      Ok, after reading Reggie's latest blog, it reminded me of some of the odd, hilarious things I've witnessed while living in Nova Scotia (they might not seem funny to you, but I was laughing out loud when I saw 'em!).  FIRST-while at the Natal Days fireworks display in Dartmouth Harbour, this firework was let off that was in the shape of 'HEARTS'.  What really got me was this Newfie Lady (not quite sure of her origin, but she had a cool accent nonetheless) started shouting out (seated directly behind me), 'LOOK, THERE'RE HAERTS, THERE'RE HAERTS!!!'.  For those of you who know Reg's story about 'I was a plumber, but my haerts just not in it!' might find this more amusing.  FRIDAY-while at the bus stop, I was waiting patiently for the #59 to get to the Pastor's place.  This older black man with a 12 pack of beer in his hand asked me if he missed his bus and proceeded to sit down (this is like at 11am).  Sure enough, not even a minute later, he cracked into one of the cans and downed a beer in a minute flat, RIGHT THERE AT THE BUS STOP!!!  TODAY-I was sitting at the Tacoma Plaza bus stop, and sure enough, right across the street, ran a FERRET, not a squirrel, but a FERRET, right through the parking lot!!!  Where that ferret came from, only God knows.  The guy sitting beside also informed me that they were filming an episode of 'Trailer Park Boys' at his trailer park on Gaston Rd.  I guess they use trailer parks all over HRM (Halifax Regional Municipality)-i always tend to say MUNICIPITALITY!!!), but get complaints, so I think they're looking into building their very own 'Trailer Park Boys' TRAILER PARK-when that happens, I'll be sure to take pics!  MAN, this is getting longer than I thought, better scat.  LATERZ.

      That's right, I finally went on the Alexander Keith's Brewery Tour (if you click on my title, it'll take you to the AK Website, and you TOO can take a virtual tour of the ever prideful brewery!).  Man, it's the most worthwhile $10 I've spent in a LONG (I mean, LONG) time!  Not only do you get a kickin' 1 hr. tour by peeps all dressed in costume and acting, but you also get 2 FREE 16 oz. of Keith's ever-so-delicious BEER.  I had to down my beer so fast to get through the tour, I think I had a bit of a buzz.  This all took place on Friday with my friend Lisa (from home), and her boyfriend Matt, and sister Sarah.  It was nice to see the sights of Halifax with people who 'somewhat' know their way around (but for some reason, they couldn't find the Scotia Bank!).  We went to this AMAZING candy store called Freak Lunchbox where Lisa proceeded to spend almost $40!  It was quite a misty, damp day, but fun, nonetheless.  Now that I have a phone, I feel like I am repeating myself to all those that I have talked to, but for those who I haven't talked to, here you are.  On Saturday, I went back into Halifax for the Buskers Festival taking place on the Harbour-we saw this guy who can fit his entire body through a stringless tennis racket!  Then, I went to Point Pleasant Park to see the aftermath of the Sept./03 hurricane, and the Atlantic Ocean.  Work is picking up pace again, with VBS around the corner.  I went to SOO many dollar stores today, and you would think that SOMEONE would have black streamers and balloons, seeing that they're so common-place (and NO, it's not a goth-themed VBS, it's construction-I picked up yellow ones already!).  NOW, I am writing in this here blog right in the Dartmouth Public Library-they have finally issued me a card, so i consider my self a full-fledged Nova Scotian (well, not quite...).  ANYWHO, that's what's up for me right now, what's up with you?  LATERZ.

      Yes, that is correct-Aliant has surprised me, and given me a phone line faster than expected (seeing that they're on strike and everything).  This morning I woke up, checked my phone (like ALWAYS), and WHAM-dial tone!  First thing I did was call my folks at 6am (much to their chagrin!).  It's been a while since I wrote in this thing, but I have been without computer for quite sometime, so I appologize PROFUSELY!  Things here are just dandy-the weekend was rather slow, but with the happenings of Natal Day, I got to entertain myself somewhat.  And now that the new week is well under way, work has picked up its' pace a bit.  We're heading into VBS-land pretty soon, and there's a group coming from Kitchener/Waterloo to help, so I actually have stuff to do now!  I'm all settled in my little (I mean microscopic) apartment, and I am quite fond of the area.  Right near 2 lakes, and there's ducks EVERYWHERE.  Tonight my friend Lisa (from home, but now living in Antigonish) is staying the night, and we're going to bomb around Halifax tomorrow (I'll finally be able to be a tourist!).  Other than that, I went to Stats Canada yesterday to pick up the 2001 Census-MAN, what a scary place-locked up tighter than Fort Knox!  One difference I totally notice out here is how friendly the people are-I'm living in a city, but it often feels like a small town (I love that).  I haven't really met anyone yet, but I'm sure that will just take time-I'm getting more used to spending time alone, and I think it's good for me to be content with that.  When you're not busy socializing, it's amazing what one can keep oneself busy with-I'm actually keeping my house clean, filing stuff, putting stuff IN drawers (for those of you who knew my last living condition KNOW that it wasn't that way!)  ANYWHO-lunch is on, and if you want my phone number/mailing address, just email me at  urlLink rooshootles@hotmail.com  .  LATERZ.
