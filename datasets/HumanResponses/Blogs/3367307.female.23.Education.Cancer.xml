      Well, here I am in Cottonwood, Arizona, enjoying the hot sunshine and lots and lots of hiking. My stepdad and I have hiked 13 miles in the last two days, and it's wonderful. I flew in to Phoenix on Friday and met Bobecia at the airport. Lovely! We had lunch, then she took me to see my friend Jason from Union, and he took me to Jamba Juice. Yum, yum. Anyway, then we went back to Alicia's place and we waited for my stepdad to come pick me up. After a long drive to Cottonwood, we went out to dinner with my grandparents at this really great Mexican restaurant called Casa Bonita. No, it is nothing like Denver's Casa Bonita, thank goodness. Anyway, yesterday we hiked Boynton Canyon, which has great views but the 5 mile hike was a little too easy. We had dinner at this place in Jerome called the Haunted Hamburger. That was amazing . . . but the people were really loud and really drunk. Oh well. Anyway, today we hiked Sycamore Canyon which was definitely more challenging, though still only a moderate hike. This one was 8 miles, and the very end was about a 200 foot climb in about a half mile worth of trail. By the time we got to the top, we were exhausted. But the hike was absolutely gorgeous, we saw some really interesting rock formations, a sycamore tree with a path through the middle of the trunk, and another sycamore tree in the shape of a question mark. Very cool. It followed a stream all the way into the canyon, and on the way there was a nice swimming pool and we got to watch some people cliff diving. Not really. More like jumping feet first from a cliff. Right now, I'm waiting for my grandparents to get here and smelling the sweet smell of steak stroganoff cooking in the kitchen. After a few more hiking adventures and a couple of days in Phoenix, I'll come home on Friday. I'm having lots of fun, but I'm missing certain people ;). That's it for now, if anything earth shattering happens in the next couple of days, I'll blog again, but probably not. Oh, and Eric, I'm getting a great tan, so shut up. Bye!

      Yesterday was a grand day. We decided not to go to church (not that that was so grand . . . ) so I spent most of the morning picking out hymns on the piano. Then, around noon, Amanda and Mom and I went to Green Mountain (which is in Lakewood) and drove around and looked at our old houses and our old neighborhood. Wow, it's amazing how much can change in just a few years. There's a Taco Bell right across the street from the high school! What kind! Why couldn't that have happened five years ago when I was in school?? Anyway, then we hiked around in Hayden Park, looked at wild flowers, saw some deer, a nice old lady, and many many drunk people with many large antennae (on their vehicles, not on their heads . . . what were you thinking??). It was a nice hike, and we reminisced about how much we miss the old neighborhood. Ah, memories. Anyway, we came home, Mom and I took a nap, and Amanda kindly brought my ringing phone to me while I was zonked out on the couch. It was my friend Steve from Union, and we talked for a while, despite the fact that AT&T is prejudiced against my neighborhood and I can't get any good cell reception here. Then, I got ready to go out with my friends from high school, and only three of us showed up . . . but that's okay. We saw Shrek 2 (which is hilarious), then we went to this place called the Yard House. Good food and apparently good beer, but I didn't have any. :) But, supposedly, we are going to get together sometime later this week and catch up with all the old buddies from high school (supposedly being the key word here). It's strange seeing people I haven't seen in four years, and even stranger how much we've all changed. It reminds me of that John Lennon song "In My Life":     "There are places I remember All my life, though some have changed Some forever and not for better Some are gone and some remain  All these places have their moments With people and friends I still can recall Some are dead and some are living But in my life, I loved them all . . . "     If you get a chance, Selah did an arrangement of this song and "If We Never Meet Again" on their Press On CD. Wow, I didn't expect to get all sentimental, but if any of my friends are reading this, there aren't words to express my gratitude for all you've added to my life.   On that note, I shall sign off. God bless you all!

      Well, it's Saturday morning, and my fam has decided not to go to church. We'll go to the mountains today, and sing hymns around the pianer, and relax. Yesterday I got a CD rack, and last night I spent a couple hours alphabetizing and organizing my 175 CD's. Geez. There's a certain point when a person has enough of something . . . I haven't gotten there yet. :D   My sister is leaving tomorrow for St. Louis. She will be working there and in Davenport, IA, for the rest of the summer. I am very sad, because she will only be home again for a week in August before she leaves to go to Taiwan for two years, but at that time I will be in Paradise, CA, busily preparing for my schoolyear. I am very sad. And there's not much more I can say about that.  Anyway, I'm quickly running out of things to write about . . . life is just not that exciting these days. I tried to publish a pic, but I can't get it to work. Oh well, no one wants to see my pic anyway ;). I'm very excited to see my friends from H.S. tonight. Hopefully everyone comes, because it would just be weird without everyone there. Ok, I'm going to go now. Happy Sabbath and God Bless.

      Employed!! I accepted the terms of the offer from Paradise yesterday. I'm way excited! I have to leave the day after my birthday to move to Paradise, but with my mom's surgery this summer, she will not have enough hours to help me move. Oh dear. Hopefully I can find someone else . . . any volunteers? Oh, and I'm still looking for a summer job, but I'm sure I'll find something. Well, that's it for today. Must go play Nintendo 64 with my brother. :D

      Too bad I'm not playing my trumpet more. I need something to play for . . . maybe someday I'll get the motivation to play some, but I hate my trumpet, and since I'm not going to get as much money as I expected from the school this summer, I can't get a new one yet. Crap. Oh well. I'm going to my dad's house for a couple days, and my sister is leaving me on Sunday. Boo!! So, another boring summer commences. I NEED A JOB!!!  But, I finally got my computer set up, and my room is still far from being organized, but it's getting there. I've been playing the piano like four hours a day. It's great. I love it. Someday I too will be a pianist. I watched Bull Durham last night. I bought it cheap because my english teacher in high school said it was good, but as the infamous Erik and Eric say: "meh". I mean, it's okay, but it's a dumb romantic comedy . . . predictable, too much unnecessary cussing, and it's all about sex. Boo. Anyway, I'm planning on going to a movie on Saturday night with a bunch of friends from high school, two of which I haven't seen in FOREVER!! I can't wait. But, going to movies are not the best way to spend time with people, so I wish we were going bowling or minigolfing or something social like that. Oh well, I'm sure there'll be plenty of time for that later. AUGH!! I only have two months here!! Blast. Guess I'd better live it up and not waste time watching TV and dumb waste of time stuff like that. I'm leaving now, in order to be social . . . HA!

      Not the place, exactly, but the people. I keep having these dreams in which my friends from Union show up in the most random of places. We're never actually in Lincoln, which is the weird part. Last night I missed everyone a LOT. As I was telling my globe-trotting friend Erik (who's currently in Sweden), in high school we used to talk about loving someone so much it makes you cry. It seemed like a silly concept back then . . . after all, shouldn't loving someone make you happy? But then as I left Union, I came to realize that I had all this love for my friends and teachers at Union, and now I have no place to express it except on my silly blog. My friends keep talking about going back to school in the fall, and as excited as I was to be done with school, I envy them so much. I MISS Y'ALL!!  But I'm not entirely sad to be getting on with my life (whatever that means . . . aren't we always getting on with our lives until we die??). Last night I talked to the lady I will be staying with in Paradise for the first few months of the school year. She used to live in Denver and knows my aunt pretty well. But she reminded me of how much fun I had while I was there for my interview. It is so nice to look forward to the supportive community, and I'm really looking forward to having something meaningful to do. And, as much as I love my family, I am definitely looking forward to having my own bathroom, my own space, and my own life independent of them.   I got a new phone the other day. It's a Verizon plan, so if anyone is interested in buying a new cell phone plan (Jen!!), you should get Verizon. The coverage is great, and I can talk to you free because of the IN-network. (Not to mention that if you tell them I referred you, I get $25!) The number is a Paradise number: (530)513-0438. And, I actually get coverage at home. Whoa, crazy. Hopefully the coverage is good in Paradise, too . . . I'm crossing my fingers.   Well, dumb me . . . I realized the other day that Sean Penn and Tim Robbins were not only nominated for Academy Awards, they both won acting awards for Mystic River. If you haven't seen it, you definitely need to. Yup, that's it for now. PLEASE if you're reading this, post a comment once in a while. It's free! Bye now.

      Today was a good day. Not fabulous, not exciting, but good. I got up early which always helps my mood (seriously). I went to the bank and deposited some money (which is so much nicer than withdrawing!), then I went to Blockbuster and got one of the best movies I've ever seen. Mystic River. I know, it came out last year, but I hadn't seen it until today. Oh my goodness, the acting was absolutely phenomenal. Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon (after all, who doesn't love Kevin Bacon?). . . some of the best acting I've ever seen. No wonder they were nominated for Academy Awards. There was quite a bit of swearing, but the writing was otherwise good. The story was incredible . . . ah, just about everything about this movie made my day a little better.   Anyway, after Blockbuster, I went to the doctor. It was great. More information later . . . maybe. You might have to ask me if you want to know more. And that's all I have to say about that.  I got a new comforter set last night, with sheets and everything. Definitely brightens up the dreary paneled dungeon that I call a room. I think tomorrow I'll wash my windows, maybe that will help brighten things even a little more. I finished The Hobbit last night, so this afternoon at the doctor's office I started in on The Fellowship of the Ring. The prologue is a little less than riveting at the moment, but I'll wade through it, I'm sure. Hmm, what else . . . . Well, I've been sitting here for five minutes trying to think of something else exciting to say, but nothing is coming to mind. So, with that, I shall attempt to finish the prologue before I go to sleep. To Middle Earth I go!

      Yesterday was a grand day. Steven (my 8-year old brother) and I went to Six Flags for the day. We rode lots of rollercoasters and lots of spinning rides, and I was unfortunately mistaken for steven's mother more than once. Which is funny, because if he were my son, I'd have been 14 when he was born. Yeah, not cool. Anyway, we shared a funnel cake (he'd never had one before and every kid needs to experience a funnel cake at least once in their life), got soaked from the water ride, and won a stuffed animal for our baby sister who was very disappointed that she didn't get to go. All in all it was a superb time. Steven behaved himself reasonably well (for an eight year old boy) and we were both exhausted by the end of the day.   Not much else is happening around here. We finally got rid of all the kittens so we can have our kitchen back. Mom and I are searching for a new comforter set for my bedroom in order to brighten things up a bit. My cat bites are healing quite nicely with the help of antibiotics. I'm almost done with The Hobbit (45 pages left to go!), and I'm starting to think about what kinds of stuff I need to take with me to CA. I'm still a little nervous, but excited. And . . . nothing else exciting. But I'm okay with that. Well, I'm off to do laundry.

      After a fairly long and uneventful week (alright, alright, I was bored!) today was significantly more interesting. I woke up feeling as if my allergies would cause my head to explode. Needless to say, I went back to bed after breakfast instead of going to church. Naughty me. Anyway, I woke up around 11:00 or so, got up, took a shower, walked around the garden with mom, and then came back inside. I played the piano for a little while until I heard cats growling and screaming behind me. I looked back just in time to see Sam (our tabby) and L.S. (the white cat whose actual name is inappropriate for blogging purposes) flying through the air, kicking and biting each other. The dogs (who would have broken this fight up if they'd been there) were outside with Mom. No amount of yelling, shoe-throwing, and loud noise making would break up the fight. Mom finally came in with the dogs, and L.S. ran into Mom's bedroom. Sam chased after her and was preparing to attack her again, and since he was already upset, he wouldn't leave. I finally decided to throw him (as gently as I could of course) out the door, but not before covering him up with mom's robe, which I didn't think he could scratch through. I was wrong. But instead of scratching me to death, he bit me as hard as he could through the robe. My hand started bleeding through about 10 different wounds and I screamed for all I was worth to get him to stop biting me. I ran to the bathroom to wash my bloody hand, and mom decided to take me to the emergency room, because as my friend Eric remembers, the last cat bite I had led to four emergency room trips to drain the bites and receive IV antibiotics. Anyway, all they could really do for me there was soak my hand in a solution that hurt like crazy, put a bunch of neosporin on it, and wrap it up. So now my hand is wrapped and I look like an early 80's Madonna wannabe. My hand doesn't hurt much anymore, but it looks horrible. Anyway, Sam feels bad for biting me (he's my favorite cat, too), but I'm sure this won't be his last fight with L.S. For some silly territorial reason, they hate each other. Stupid cats. Why can't we all just get along?   Also, I heard from my principal in Paradise. All the arrangements have been made as far as where I'm going to live. The first couple of months I will be living in Chico, which is about 20 minutes away from Paradise, with a member of the church. Then, after Labor Day, I will have a nice little apartment which is attached to a garage, separate from the main house. Ah, privacy! Lovely. I'm getting more and more excited! I'm still scared to death of teaching, but I'm sure I'll learn a lot.  Well, that's it for now. Thanks to Amanda and Jen who faithfully comment. I hope the rest of you know that you are free to post comments too! I'd appreciate it! Lots of love to everyone who takes the time out of their day to read this!

      Believe me, from personal experience, this movie is not worth the $9 ticket. If you do go see it, be prepared for bad writing, bad acting, unbelievable characters, unbelievable scenarios, and just about the worst "glittering generalities" I've ever seen. And believe me, I also have a problem with the subject matter of the movie as well.   If you haven't heard about this movie, read some reviews. They sum up the plot pretty well. While there were a few redeeming qualities at the very end of the film, overall it made me incredibly sad. I realized as I was driving home, listening to KLOVE, that a lot of people out there see Christians as hypocrites (including my best friend who went to the movie with me). Not that I am denying the fact that a lot of Christians are hypocrites, but the fact of the matter is that a lot of PEOPLE are hypocrites, regardless of their claimed beliefs. I agree, many Christians are judgemental when it comes to controversial subjects such as teen pregnancy and homosexuality. I know that I have passed judgement before really getting to know people. But I believe that a truly Christian attitude should not be to just ignore or try and hide these things (which the main character asserts in the film), and I know that I am not alone in this. I'd bet that most Christians would agree with me. I know that I am not the only professed Christian who is uncertain of their salvation. All the Christians that I know are painfully AWARE of the fact that they are sinners, no different than those whose sins are physically or otherwise apparent. Furthermore, in the four years I attended Christian college, I never met one who appeared to be self-righteous who wasn't hurting because of some sin in their past. I'm not saying that there aren't people out there who point out the speck in their neighbor's eye without seeing the plank in their own. I'm aware of the fact that there is a reason that people outside of the Christian world dislike Christians. I was out there once too. It was just blatantly evident that the filmmakers chose to ignore the fact that Christians are not as naive, closed-minded, and legalistic as their film portrayed. I guess what I'm trying to say is that there was a gross unbalance between those who were still searching for what they believed in (which is what Christianity ought to be -- always searching and never believing that you have all the right answers) and those who believed in "black and white" religion.  Well, I've said my piece and will proceed to step down off of the soapbox. I guess this movie really hurt my feelings . . . not my faith mind you . . . . I just hope that when people see this movie they will understand that it is an inaccurate portrayal of the way things really are.

      Well, mom went back to work today, so now I have to entertain myself. Grr. Today I shall pay bills, fill out paperwork, call Union, go to the bank . . . what else . . . maybe take Maggie the puppy to the dog park, or go for a bike ride or something. I also finished  A Widow for One Year , so I'll have to find a new book. The book was very good, but the first part is very . . . um . . . strange. It's one of those books in which the plot is so carefully woven with all kinds of complexitites, and unfortunately, there's lots of sexually confused people. But the story is incredible and the emotions it induces range from hilarity to intense sadness and everything in between. I recommend it to peole who can look past the vulgarity to the literary elements. If you can't do that, though, don't bother.   Last night mom and I went to Media Play and I bought two CD's (The Beatles and Journey) and a hiking book. I'm excited about the hiking book. Now when I plan a hike I can actually PLAN it instead of driving up to the mountains hoping to find a good trail somewhere. I'm also excited about the CD's, in fact, I'm listening to The Beatles now. Good stuff. Last night we had an incredible thunderstorm which had lots of rain in it. Lovely! We got soaked on the way from Chipotle to the car, but the lawn and the garden got watered. We can handle that!    I cleaned my room on Monday, and I felt much better about my life after that was done. And, aside from my cat dumping my plant into my laundry basket, it's stayed pretty clean. Speaking of clean, I'm off to take a shower. God bless!

      Well, after five days of kicking AZ, it has kicked me back. I am a tired, tired girl. But I'm happy. The grand total for my hiking mileage this week is 23 miles. WOO HOO!! I climbed some really great rocks, saw some really great streams, and took some really great photos. And, I ate lots of amazing food. Arizona does well at providing a Mexican food lover with real Mexican food. We ate at Casa Bonita again the other night, and today we ate at the Javelina Cantina in Sedona. Yum. Best beef taco I've ever had.  Anyway, aside from playing with the dog and watching the quail run across the street (if you've never seen this, it's hilarious) and visiting with many different types of lizard, I finished two books while I was here. I watched a very little of the Indy 500 followed by a little good ol' fashioned NASCAR, but other than that, the TV stayed off. Ah, how relieving. I am exhausted from the sun, the heat, and the exercise, but I feel great. I can't wait to do some more hiking in CO this weekend. Hopefully my legs will stop hurting by then! HA! What I referred to as a tan in the previous post is actually a very nice sunburn (wow, it's hot in here). Oh well. Very shortly it will turn into a nice tan. I hope. I'm not real fond of the whole peeling thing. Ick. I have also been bitten by spiders, yucca plants, and cactus, and I have the scars to prove it.    Wow, I saw so much beauty this week and I can't wait to come back. I am in Phoenix again now, and Alicia and I will spend the day together tomorrow and then I'll go back home on Friday. Ah, to sleep in my own room and have my own computer back . . . sounds blissful. But, of course, this means back to boredom. Oy. At least now I'm motivated to get a CO hiking book and find some awesome trails. Hey, today in Phoenix, it's 107 degrees out. Yeah baby. Nice cool Denver sounds nice about now.   Anyway, I hiked down four different canyons this week: Boynton, Sycamore, Fay, and Long (which was the best of the four . . . challenging and beautiful). Today we climbed this huge rock called Cathedral Rock. That was very challenging (for an amateur hiker, that is) but the view was incredible. The sky was so blue today . . . can't get that kind of blue in Nebraska, I'll tell you that much. It was blazing hot, but man, we had fun. This rock is actually a vortex site which means there's extra energy flowage or something of that sort. Anyway, as I was climbing a little higher on the rock, I found a broken crystal. Cool. I also irreverantly did a very loud Tarzan yell that would have made my papa proud (he did one at his wedding). Ah, good times. There's about a million other things I could write about, but there's not enough time, and I'm being a boring guest, so I shall sign off now. God bless!

      Well, as you've guessed by now, I'm here. I've been having a good time so far. Not much of a social life yet, but I'm making progress in getting my filthy office cleaned up. So disorganized I can't stand it. Paradise is beautiful. I'm actually living in Chico right now, which is about 20 miles away from Paradise. I had to get my car fixed when I got here, which was very expensive, but it's running so much better now. The people here are great. There is a Chipotle in Chico, as well as a Jamba Juice and a Cold Stone, so I'm all set. The lady I'm living with is amazing. She's got a little dachshund named Rusty, and we have a good time together. My first day of work (Monday) my principal and his wife took me to a movie. That was a little shocking, but it was fun. Last night, Eunice (the lady I'm staying with) and I went to the Farmer's Market and got some really good peaches and tomatoes. The fruit here is amazing. Anyway, I'm loving my time here, and I'm sure it can only get better. I can't wait for church tomorrow. I'm excited to meet new people, hopefully there are a few my age around here during the summer. Well, I&nbsp;should be working right now, so I'll update more when there's more to tell.

      This day, I leave for Paradise, California. I'm nervous, scared, excited, and freaked out because I'm not done packing yet. I just know I'm going to forget something important. Anyway, I have been horrible in the last few weeks about blogging. On Friday, July 2, I had cosmetic surgery to reduce the size of my breasts. I already feel a difference in my back pain and shoulder pain, and it's really nice to be able to wear normal clothes again. I know this may be "TMI" for some people, but get over it. Anyway, since then, I've been trying to keep my muscle spasms in control and that means not sitting on the floor for long periods of time in order to do stuff at my computer. Yesterday was my birthday: My best friend Eric took me to lunch at Armadillo and we drove around the neighborhood where we grew up. We lived in the same neighborhood, and his best friend lived around the corner from our house and we could see each other's back yards. We ended up at the same high school and didn't know that we had lived so close to each other and even had the same third grade teacher (but a year later for him) until we started dating. Anyway, we've been best friends ever since. Dad took me to a Colorado Rockies game last night, which was great. We had really good seats, and thank goodness they were under the second level so we didn't have to deal with the rain. And now, it's 7:30 in the morning and I'm frantically trying to tie up loose ends and PACK, so I have to go. I won't be online again until probably Monday the 19th. Three days of driving . . . but it's all worth it, right? Ok, I'm going to pack now. See ya on the flipside.
