      dear ***,  nothing will ever be good enough for you will it?  everything i do seems to never reach your impossible standards.  what do i need to do; what do i have to do?  do you want me to win awards?  hah! awards.  ive tried really hard to win awards.  i guess personal awards and achievements mean nothing compared to a plastic trophy or a stupid peice of paper.  do i need to be recognized?  i am recognized, but not as an elite athlete, professional, or over acheiver, but at least people know my name because of what i am worth to them, as a collegue, person and friend.  do i really need to work myself to insanity in school inorder for you to appreciate me, respect me, feel proud of me, love me?  what is it?  you call me a failure, and in you doing that, i am led to believe that no matter what effort i put into my work, it will never please you.  i cant be like all those other people who spend their lives trying to please someone.  does my own happiness and well-being mean nothing to you?  i guess not because you want me to take 5 courses on top of working part-time, while in sports.  would you like me to run a marathon as well?  compete in the olympics?  write a best selling novel?  stop world hunger?  discover a cure for cancer?  what?  what do you want from me?  why cant you  just love me for me, despite of all my obvious character flaws which you have so nicely pointed out to me in the past?  i dont get it.  you will never be proud of me until i do what you want.  it's always what you want.  always.  yet you call me selfish.  are you living vicariously through me? i doubt it, because you are too perfect.  or are you using me to show off to your stupid little friends?  if that is the case, i will not be a pawn in your sick little game of show-&-tell.  go buy a sports car or a new house.  even better, go focus your attention towards something that can benefit your demands, like opening up a sweat shop, or kicking poor people on the streets, or opening up your wallet to give a beggar change, revealing 8 100 dollar bills, but only giving the poor fellow a nickel.  if there is a day in this lifetime where i reach a standard of some approval in your books, i hope that we are still talking to each other, because i would love to hear you say, just once, that you are proud of my decisions, and that you are proud of me.  just once. it may be a huge blow to your dignity, but it's about time you came down to earth.  i don't even need you any more.  so why do i even care?  i care because i need someone to love me.  it sucks going through life not knowing what it's like to be loved by someone.  but it's worse going through life loving someone beyond all of their flaws and mistakes, even though they cant seem to do the same for you.  i know you love me.  i know you want whats best for me.  but all your pushing is moving closer and closer to the edge.  one of these days i will jump, and i will be gone forever.  i wont push back anymore, and i will let you send me over the edge.  i dont want that to happen.  just let go.    love, me

      what an emotionally draining day.  today i went to the park and wrote a letter to one of my closest friends...who knew that i felt so strongly about him.  who knew that writing a letter could be so stressful and tiring.  but it was worth it.  his letter to me was very funny and extremely sweet.  at least that's one thing that going right in my life.   i think i screwed up...there's this guy...he's totally awesome...and i think i totally messed it up because im stupid.  and not the "duh" kind of stupid, more like the stubborn selfish stupid...i havent felt this way about a person in years...last time i felt so strongly about someone, it was in grade 9 and thats when me and the guy went out for over a year and a half.  relationships are so emotionally exhausting and painful. no matter how great the guy is, and how well you get along, theyre still painful.  i hate pain.  i hate uncontrollable pain.  maybe that's why people inflict harm on themselves, because it's the only kind of pain they can control, it's also the only kind of pain they can take a pill for and it will just disappear, atleast for a while. i told him that we'll keep the thought of an "us" open and all that...you know for the future...but it should have been now.  shoulda, woulda, coulda...aaaaahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  hopefully he'll find someone who has their life in order to avoid crap like this.  he deserves someone like that.   i hate this...it's so frustrating...now i know why timing is so important.  time. time is my enemy.  there's never enough time, there's too much time, it's not the right time...it's like when your with someone special...time never seems to exist, but suddenly it's late and time went by way too quickly...or you meet someone absolutely amazing but your already married!! that would suck. i hope that never happens to me.  time is uncontrollable...

      isn't it wierd how you can walk through life feeling confident in everything you do, everything you say, but your never confident in who you are...who ever your around, you change to conform...your never the same person twice.  identity crisis?  perhaps.  loss of your own sense of self...who knows?  but what is it?  why is it so hard to truly define who you are or who you want to be?  i mean, most ppl have their shit together and all that...but then there are those who have no clue who they are and where they are going...there are times when you think that you finally have everything figured out but then someone walks in and tells you that it isnt right, it isnt good enough, it isnt what they want...who cares what they want?  i mean, come on! seriously ppl, just leave me the hell alone and let me live my own life for a change. stop trying to hold me back and tell me whats best for me.  for once i may know whats best for me.  it may not seem like a good idea at this very moment but in the long run whatever happens now, may it be a success or a failure, it will make me stronger.  i cant always have this sandy foundation..i dont want to be babied my whole life...i want to build my own strong foundation on my own.  i'll never learn if im always being told what to do, if im always being guided down the "right" path.  let me walk down my own path. let me travel an alternative route.  "the road less travelled...." let me make mistakes and for god sake's let me live...let me breathe...let me be free from your suffocating grasp...

      well well well, look at me.  a journal entry for all to read.  do i really think that my life is that interesting that i need to write about it for all to see?  no.  but will i anyways, yes.  who really knows the psychology behind this...perhaps it's just a good way to vent hidden emotions, reveal haunting secrets and confess to the world the thoughts that continue to corrupt ur mind at night when you should be asleep, dreaming.  whatever...
