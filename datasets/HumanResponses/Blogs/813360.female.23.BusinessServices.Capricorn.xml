      Just to start, a little about me: Curiosity, determination and friends run my life. I am an economics major at UC Irvine, but currently work at a publishing company in Newport Beach writing for a magazine. While being a level headed capricorn, spontinaity and an open mind make my life a little less 'square'. I do not respond to negativity and could be considered a grounded dreamer -- yes, conflicting but true! While I am originally a Nor Cal girl, my heart is in Italy, where I lived for 5 months...ahhhhh Above all, I love to travel. The world is so big, yet so accessable. With ten countries already under my belt, I aim to conquer another ten more within the next decade. Formerly, I was an avid athlete who love to run and play soccer. Unfortunately intermural soccer has to cover for now. Some of my friends as well as my mom would say I am a shop-a-holic, but really I just have a nack for finding the cutest things for under $20. E-mail me for tips...there is a stratagy! Whenever I am not feeling up to par, a hot bath or a favorite CD pump up my mood, that is of course if I otherwise don't have a special someone to help me out ...wink, wink!  My house up North is filled with women. My mom, my sister (26yrs), my cat (Siena), and our two boarder collies (lily and chloe). My dad and his very fat cat (Zoonie) live twenty minutes away and treat my sister and I to dinner quite often. While a whole sorority of 75 girls is always a start to a fun night, my good friends are my saving graces, who without them, I would be smiling a whole lot less.

      Today especially my butt seems to have formed a perfect mold of my chair. I worked through lunch due to a high level mouse requesting ridiculous data. Why the bottom must suffer for the top I'll  never get, shouldn't it be the other way around. I mean, if I made 6 figures I would have no problem parking my 745 BMW myself--actually I'd prefer to park it myself. But here at Disney, the big shots not only get a car allowance every month to help pay for their beauties but they get their cars valet'd everyday. Yes that's right. The rest of us, not in the preferred mouse club, must circle around the parking structure finding the widest compact parking space so our "un-luxury" cars don't get more dings.  Really, the more you get paid the fewer the benefits you should receive. It is those of us that don't get paid 6 figures who should get the benefits to make up for the limited funds. (Those of you who don't make bank and are far from it will completely agree I'm sure. And when I make 6 figures--yes I said when--I'm won't agree with me.)  So life is good right now. The poor soul who has bought my old car rescued me from financial debt this month, I have two job opportunities on the horizon, Hannah is coming home in 13 days, the girls and I are going to party our asses off in Vegas in two weeks, and I have 2 dates this weekend. I'm not sure what it is in LA but I've never dated so much in my life. You'd think that you'd date the most in college, well this has proven not to be true for most. I think I went on like 3 formal dates in college total. The "lets hang out at my house" offers came up way  more often than the "lets go out, eat dinner, talk and get to know each other..."  It can't help that many of the boys, yes boys, I met were at the club. What do I expect if our first interaction is my ass and their crotch? Funny though, we always tried NOT to meet men at the club but for some reason most of the guys there are trying to meet a girl. (I'm sure many of you are like, duhhhh) Note: there's a reason the music is loud a the club...I'm not trying to talk to you I'm trying to dance with you or avoid you.   I'm moving in January, please start praying now because I'll need all the help I can get. I have more stuff than I even know of and moving 5 times in the last 5 years hasn't taught me anything about getting rid of things or not buying more things. Issues...Kim I need you help!!!  Ta Ta for now...my random thoughts have subsided. Oh, FYI--I've discovered why my ass is getting fatter working here. Today I didn't spend a dime and just munched on Disney food. This is what I ate: a bagel (wheat...only healthy thing all day) half with Peanut Butter and half with Cream Cheese, 5 small raspberry jam cookies, a Balance Bar, 1/3 of a cinnamon roll, and half a roast beef sandwich and I've been sitting here all day except for the walk to the kitchen, 2 trips to the bathroom, and 1 to the sink. YA MAN....I'm one sexy bitch!  (I did drink green tea which is mucho good for me)

      Last night Disney held its annual Holiday Party at Disneyland for all employees--interns included! They closed  the park to the public from 7:30 to 12:30 and let the employees run rampant through Disneyland and California Adventure. Admission was free for me and a guest, and food was discounted (still way over priced). Lily came with, claiming that she was an employee who worked under the Vice President...or more accurately ON the Vice President. he he he...  We were suppose to meet all my other intern friends at the part, who arrived early to party in Down Town Disney, but after several slurred phone calls of "What I can't hear you..." and "Wait where are we..." I gave up hope of ever meeting up with them. I guess there was a lot of drama, better that I wasn't there and didn't have to deal with it I guess. One of the girls was fighting for hours with her "3 year booty call" who came along, arguments who owed what over the $400 bill arose, and another eventually got arrested for being drunk in public...Ya, only half of the group showed up for work today--most with hang-overs and one in jail.(we think, not sure)  So Lil and I regressed to giddy 12 year olds, wandering around the park wide-eyed. We went on all the Fantasy Land rides: Peter Pan, Snow White, Alice in Wonderland (my favorite), the Casey Jr Train, Storybook Boat ride, and on the classic It's a Small World--Christmas Edition. Lil seriously knows the words to every freakin' song. I couldn't believe it. I hadn't even heard half of them and her she was singing along to every single one and blurting out character names. I had to have her recap each of the movies for me--I felt really old. We also hit all the "grown-up" rides like Indiana Jones, Haunted Mansion, Pirate's of the Caribbean, and the Matterhorn. Good times. I guess these benefits are suppose to make up for the low pay we receive as interns. It works for now, but I'm sure the appeal of receiving free stuff will wear off after a while. I have more Disney pens and notepads than freakin' Staples and just looking across the hall to my managers office, I can imagine what years of collecting this crap (arguable for some) would look like. Scary, very scary.

      It has been a while since I last wrote…almost two years. Hannah has inspired me to write journals again—she just started to a blogger account (holdingontothedream.blogspot.com, good name Hannah!). If anything, it will help to relieve my head of the many random and useless thoughts that get tangled up inside it everyday.  Not that I can’t blame my brain for trying to entertain itself with uselss thoughts and unanswerable questions. Sitting at work with little to do is an good excuse I guess…either way, hopefully you’ll find my randomness entertaining at the least, and maybe even insightfull. We’ll see…

      Yesterday Hannah posted a quote in her blog that rings so true for me.   "Women become attracted to the men they fall in love with, men fall in love with the women they are attracted to." -some really smart anonymous guy on craigslist.   So true. All of my serious and significant relationships have been with people who I became good friends with first, then I fell in love with who they were, and then became incredibly attracted to them physically. They were all attractive men, but initially their appearance isn't what struck me. One of the guys I've been talking to lately is exactly this. He is such an awesome person: inspirational, funny, talented, and thinks I'm something special--always a nice bonus ;)  But when I first saw him I wasn't drooling at the mouth, however the more we hang out the more I just want to pounce on him! I love that we have just remained friends...the sexual tension is building and it is exciting! Just the way he hugs me is so different, weird I know but there's chemistry there! I'm hanging out with him tonight, hopefully I'll have more to report later. (Lil stop laughing at my crush on Chestnut!!!)  The other guy I'm seeing is totally hot, but not so sure about the rest of the package. We had a nice dinner and all but it took him a while to warm up I think. Again, we'll see. We're going out on Sun or Mon.  Enough about boys....Hannah's coming home!!! Only 6 days to go and then we're off to Vegas to creating more stories NOT for the grandchildren! ;) I just can't wait to be with my ladies and relax, party and find that inner child again! ;)  This corporate work thang makes me feel all old and responsible--need a break that's for sure!   So I had an interview yesterday for a Segment Marketing Associate for Disneyland Resorts down in Anaheim. It went well, but I can talk to almost anyone so who know how it really went. The job would pay bank which is definitely needed at this point. (I was a victim of a scam last weekend and my bank account was in the red by over $2400, ya don't ask. It has been a really really really crappy week, all will be taken care of soon.) Next I will be interviewing with the VP of Marketing and her senior manager (a formality I think more than anything, bc I probably wouldn't see her again after that) So keep your fingers crossed. The job sounds fabulous, the only bad thing is that I'd have to move to the OC again. I think Long Beach would be fun (Kim, I'm thinking of you and your love for the LB) and it has the same initials as me...ahh how cute. I'm such a planner so it is hard to be in limbo between where I'm working, where I'm living, and how I'll be paying my bills. I must be patient as my mom would say...I have no patience so this is a challenge.

      So today is the day I've been waiting for...Hannah is home and we're off to VEGAS!!! I can barely contain myself. This morning I woke up with such vigor, it was amazing. I underestimated the excitement of seeing a best friend I haven't seen in a while and acting a fool with all those who know you the best. Ahhhh, such contentment right now. The car is getting washed, money has been withdrawn, legs have been shaved, and The diamond studded "Vegas shoes" have been packed. Holy cow, I am afraid of the amount of fun we're going to have this weekend. My nervous system is on overdrive just in anticipation of the stories I'll come home with. I'm definitely going to a tad bit more tame than I was last year...but just a tad! ;) Stay tuned bc I'm sure I'll some stories to share...or not share!  Wooooooooooooooooooo--freakin'--hoooooooooooooooooooooooo, and I'm off!

      Today I finally feel that someone in the world of business actually has a heart and is interested in my best interest and not just the company's. As some of you know, I've had to make a rash decision to accept a job that isn't exactly what I want to do and doesn't fit my criteria for a full-time job with benefits and all. I was in the process of interviewing for a job I really wanted down at Disneyland Corporate (in marketing) but was forced before I could go to the second interview to accept a "casual" position with in my current group doing retail analytics. If I didn't accept the job then I could potentially be unemployed--everyone's worst fear in these times. In order to gather the most information I could before making a decision, I called the recruiter for the marketing job down at Disneyland to see where I stood as a candidate and if I really had a good chance of getting hired on. She talked with the main guy that I interviewed with and called me back saying that, while I consistently came up on the top of their list they were a little hesitant because I don't have direct marketing experience. After that discussion I decided that I was better off being safe than sorry.  So here is where the shit hit the fan--pardon the expression--I was at lunch meeting today with my manager and our director, whom I've always gotten along with, and when she found out that the manager trying to hire me in our group forced me to tell her today if I'd take the job or not she was furious. She actually cared that I was being forced against my will to make a decision that really wasn't in my best interest. Then, she proceeded to tell me that she'd give me a recommendation and that she'd talk to the director overseeing the open position to see if something could be worked out...halleluiah! Someone is trying to help me out, I was just floored.   Now I need all of you to keep your fingers crossed and hope that I can go through second round interviews, that they are convinced through recommendations from my manager and director that I can do the job, and that I get hired as a Segment Marketing Associate for Disneyland Resorts! Finally on a career path.   Time will tell...more on this later. Funny how as soon as you think things are settled and you know what you'll be doing for the next 6 months that things change so abruptly. Now I'm back to we'll see...  So here's a much more fun topicÃ¢â‚¬Â¦boys! Okay, I'm not 12Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Anyway, it happened. Just like that last night I started becoming very attracted to Cesare. It is weird, like all of a sudden he looked different to me. I started to see HIM and not just the physical. It was pretty cool. I kinda sad bc he left this morning for Europe and Chicago (to see family) and won't be back until Jan.10. Boo. That's okay though bc I'm going to VEGAS. Yes Ladies and gentlemen..1.5 days until we're off on another girls only weekend! I can't wait...these last 3 weeks have been way too stressful. Some steam will be let out on the dance floor, that is for sure!

      This year it was my job to write the Christmas letter that we send out to everyone and their mother. I guess not much happened in my mom's and in alison's life, but hey 2003 has brought about more change than any year yet in my life. So heck...I went to it and wrote our letter for the family. So below is a glimpse of the Bailey women and their lives!  Dear Family and Friends,  Another year has swept by leaving the Bailey ladies wondering, “What did we  do in 2003?” At first we all stared blankly at each other trying to recount  exactly what we did, but golly gee we did stuff. This letter almost didn’t  make it out the door due to lack of exciting things to report, but hey, even  the mundane is stuff! So here we go on a journey with the Bailey women  through a year of growing, learning, and laughing—thank heavens!  Marylouise has been busy running Weible Elementary for the seventh year in a  row, where she finally feels she has gotten the hang of being the head  honcho—no more weekends at work or nights at home filled with paperwork.  This year she got a worthwhile secretary, which in turn has made her life a  little easier managing the 800 plus kids and 40 staff members. Water  aerobics, Curves, and even yoga have made their way into her life keeping  the stress out and allowing the endorphins to run loose!  In the little  spare time she has not working or working out, Marylouise enjoys her  weekends shopping, relaxing or gardening at her leisure and without a  schedule. While Lizzie is always sending her mom e-mails with listings of  the “Top Ten Places to Retire”, Marylouise still resides in Fremont, CA.  Insider information has revealed that the house and yard may be getting a  face-lift soon, but an official statement on the matter is still to be  released. Stay tuned!  Early last year Alison moved out and onward to Oakland, CA where she over  the last two years has experienced the many adventures of urban living. From  the 2 a.m. bar crowd down the street to the fresh goodies at the farmer’s  market, she has made a comfortable home for herself but is looking in 2004  to find a place of her own. Alison still works at Aradigm, a pharmaceutical  device company, as an Associate Scientist and enjoys being an active member  of the Charity Committee. This year Alison made it to Indiana to visit  Granny and Gramps at the farm for the Fourth of July. Fireworks, lots of  food, and rides on the Toro made for a memorable visit! Along the way, a  “girls only” weekend to Hearst Castle arose where ooohs and aahhs ensued  from the spectacular mansion, or compound really, that lays on the San  Simian coast. She asks that you wish her luck in her apartment search and  that Mr. Right will appear on her doorstep soon!  For the youngest one, Lizzie, 2003 has been extremely eventful. One  unforgettable phase of her life, college, ended and a new one is underway.  While the transition hasn’t been easy, she has learned a lot about “the real  world” being on her own over the last 6 months. In June, she graduated from  the University of California, Irvine with a B.A. in Economics. Just three  short weeks after graduation, she moved to Burbank, CA to pursue a job as an  Associate with Disney Consumer Products. Recently, she was offered a  position as a Retail Analyst within DCP and looks forward to furthering her  career within The Walt Disney Company, or the Mouse House as she calls it.  Trips to Disneyland, stuffed Nemos, and hallways decorated with Mickey  Mouse memorabilia make work fun and relaxed—most of the time. The annual Las  Vegas trip with her best girlfriends is scheduled for the weekend before  Christmas, and in January she’s off to enjoy a trip she won at a concert to  New Orleans. To top off this year of change, her old beat-up car was donated  to charity and in its place resides the most beautiful of all autos (she  believes), her new car: a 2004 Toyota Camry Solara.  The Bailey women did manage to squeeze a vacation or two into their busy  schedules; a seven day cruise to Mexico and a trip to Yosemite made time for  some much deserved quality R&R.  Lily, Chloe and Siena the cat keep Marylouise on her toes, but the affection  and love from this part of the family is always cherished by all.  We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. May love and peace  surround you in 2004!  Sincerely,  Marylouise, Alison and Lizzie

      What a weekend! It was a weird one for me, in bed at 9:30 on Saturday night. But other wise it was great. I went out with Cesare on Friday night. He gave me a driving tour of USC and downtown LA, and then we headed to Santa Monica to wonder the streets and window shop. I finally got to see the Santa Monica pier, apparently a site for gang activity at night--cop car started showing up and "talking" with some teenagers who looked like trouble (but what does that tell us!) Then we had a late sushi dinner and back to his place for Gin and Tonics...my fav!  It was a nice night and I got to learn a lot more about him and who he prides himself on being.   Saturday was Christmas shopping....that Sucked! Especially since I'm living on such an extreme budget. The fam is getting minimal presents this year. I guess the gesture counts, as my sister has informed me. I picked up some take out--don't worry I had a coupon and it was only $4.00--and headed home to watch a movie. What an old lady...I was out at like 9:30. Beside the Joe Schmoe that called me at 10:30, who I still do not know who it was, I slept soooooo soundly. Ahh that felt good!  Sunday was a great day. I got up early, finished my Christmas shopping, cleaned up the apartment and then headed back to Cesare's  to hang out again before he leaves for Christmas. When I walked into his apartment waiting for me on the table was a beautifully wrapped bag of Godiva Chocolates...ya he sure knows how to get to my heart, with chocolate! What a sweetheart. I love surprises and that he thought of me while out at the mall. Still though I feel slightly uncomfortable about receiving gifts and having him always pay and take me out to nice dinners bc I am not sure how I feel about him yet...friend, more than a friend...I'm not sure yet. The whole attraction thing is still developing. I hope!   Today I interviewed this absolute gorgeous guy for an intern position with in our group. He had well polished answers, but I couldn't get a sense of exactly how he felt about the job and about commuting. I know he'll get the position and hopefully I'm still around to help train him!  Seriously, 4 freakin' days until Hannah is home!!! I can't wait to see her, catch up in the car, act like teenagers and of course,  and party in Vegas. We are Double Trouble...Ya Man!!!  On the work front, who knows. By Wednesday I'll be able to report what I'll be doing. But I could be unemployed depending on my decision on how things work out. Keep your fingers crossed!

      Gotta love living in California--earthquake country! An earthquake struck just a few minutes ago, leaving our 32 story building swaying like a drunkard and its contents--us--feeling dizzy and confused.  I have no idea how strong the earthquake was, but it must have been a big enough one to make the building creek and sway. What a sense of loss of control...which now kinda freaks me out. Talking about loss of control...here's the Vegas low down:  1. Actually quite calm compared to previous visits. 2. Few really cute boys in town, but more people than last year.  3. Tons of fun had by all, both acting like 6th graders in the hotel room or shaken' it on the dance floor. 4. I ate it trying to step over the divider into our VIP booth, falling on my ass with a skirt on and flashing all around--Nice Liz, real nice! 5. Not too much money won by anyone. Lil won $40 once...but the rest of us didn't win jack! Booooo. 6. Lovely to reconnect with friends and remember that these are the people who will always be around to share life with.  7. Remembered, or realized, that transition isn't easy but that it is worth hitting the bumps along the way to get back in the swing of things again. 8. VEGAS rocks, it always will, and next year we'll tear it up again! 9. Next year we'll fly...or at least I won't drive! (the drive there isn't bad, but the drive back sucks a fat one!)

      For my friends on the job tip or who are just plain interested in what our economy is doing: For all of 2003, the economy grew by a solid 3.1 percent and represented the strongest showing since 2000.  For out of work Americans, though, it may not feel like better economic times.  Job growth has been slow. The nation's payrolls grew by a scant 1,000 jobs in December, disappointing economists and frustrating jobseekers. The economy has lost 2.3 million jobs since President Bush took office in January 2001. (good one Bushy, way to go on improving quality of life for all)The president believes a stronger economy will lead to more jobs. Democrats point to the job losses as evidence of what they say are the president's failed economic policies. Analysts are hopeful that stronger job growth will take place later this year (looks like the anticipated 2nd quarter job growth is now pushed back...just great!) as businesses feel more confident in the economy and see their bottom lines improve.

      I officially have one month to catch up on all the Oscar nominated movies I still have yet to see. I figure, if I'm going to spend an evening watching the award show, I should have some idea of who I think should win--otherwise for me it would only be about who's wearing what and come on...no need to sit though the show when you've got Extra's worst and best dressed list! (E! has better coverage, but there's no cable in my casa)   Last night Cesare brought over Whale Rider--it's a movie for those of you with you mind in the gutter. It was a really good and a very spiritual movie. Frustrating at times because the grandfather is such an A-hole and can't imagine that a girl could ever be equal to or better than a boy. I won't spoil the end, but go see it!    Had a weird morning. Cesare slept over bc we both just passed out at like midnight and woke at 3 a.m., figured why leave now I guess. So, ya...he watched me get ready this morning--not sure I liked that but sweet I guess. It made me think what it would be like if you were on a reality TV show where people were watching your every move...that would suck, remind me of this if I ever have the urge to sign up for one of those stupid shows--although I watch all of them and even have Cesare TVo the ones I miss. Sad I know...  The more I sit here at work, the more unsatisfied I am! I just am not happy with where my career is going or not going for that matter. As a college graduate you go from top of the totem pole smack down to the bottom...ahhh I wish someone would of warned me of the frustrating and rough times after college. Supposedly, at like 24 or 25 it all gets better and live starts look bright again. The only time I must say that I want a year or two to pass! Of course it is nice to not have major responsibility at work bc I can write in my blog or be brain dead for a day and not have it really affect anything. Trying to be positive here...  After work today we have a GBS social hour (GBS is my department, Global Business Services department).  Until about 6:30 there are appetizers and drinks...ya man! Although, not planning on delving too much into either--only two months before bikini season. Yikes, sorry to remind ya'll. Then a whole bunch of the interns and casuals are heading over to Camps to suck down a few more and play a few games. Should be fun, and a good teaser to my weekend with Mom. Yup, my Madre is heading down tomorrow morning. Not sure what we are going to do yet, but I know a movie, a manicure, maybe Disneyland, some good eatin' and a meeting with Cesare are all in the plans somewhere. Should make for some good stories next week...  Now it is time to go back to the white walls of corporate America--a much less colorful world than I'd prefer--where the precise placement of Winnie the Pooh graphics is the difference between a job well done and a redo! Ya, it is amazing how much I use "Ctrl + arrow" to adjust things in PowerPoint--equivalent of moving something 1/32 of an inch. Oh my, what has my life come to. Thank god for friends or else I'd be totally depressed...Finally, I stop rambling.

      I know, another quote...but I especially like this one. I believe this calls for a special shout-out to "Double Trouble"!  A good friend will come and bail you out of jail...but, a true friend will be sitting next to you saying, "Damn...that was fun!"

      Ahh, I forget what it is like to get a full night's sleep. I was out for the count at about 9:30. I couldn't help it. I had a bowl of chicken dumping soup for dinner, then proceeded to take a warm bath, and followed by a half hour of perusing the pages of Newsweek. What could be a better recipe for a good night's sleep? Okay, I can think of one or two things, but for a regular Monday night in the studio alone...I think I did pretty well.   My whole life, I have never been a big reader. While I have always enjoyed magazines and national geographic (like anyone actually reads that one anyway) I just never had this urge to read. It was always last on my list of things to do. If all my friends were busy, the dogs weren't in a rambunctious mood, and it wasn't nice or early enough to take a jaunt around the neighborhood then I may read, if staring at the wall got too boring. I don't know my deal. But...all is changing. During the last few years of college I began to enjoy taking time out to read. Sitting in front of the boob-tube for a while made my brain feel like it was becoming softer by the minute...always being stimulated by something outside, not internal effort required. TV can't be good for you. I'm convinced that during my Junior year in High School I became quite dense from the summer of TV watching. Thankfully, college stimulated many of the previously numbed neurons and having a roommate to exchange thoughts with also helped. I guess what I'm trying to say is that last night I was reminded of how much I do enjoy reading. It is relaxing, you are learning, your brain is working, and it opens your eyes to new ideas. For many of you reading this you're thinking, "Duh" but just thought I'd share. What I'm going to do with this...read more! So send your book recommendations this way....!

      It has been a while since I wrote last...before Christmas I guess. Since, a lot and little has happened. I've been on more vacations this holiday season that ever, which is making the daily trek to work just that much harder. After Christmas in Fremont with the family, I ventured back to LA to spend New Years with Hannah and the gang at our friend Jeremy's in the Valley. At first what looked like a "Pleasantville" high school dance eventually turned into a proper New Years--champagne popping, horns blowing and most importantly of all drunken' booty shaken' to celebrate 2004. Quite a nice time...no kisses but definitely fun. Oh, and just for kicks and to remind ourselves that we are sexy women, we dressed to the nines in dresses, heals and all!   Then came my 23rd birthday on Wednesday Jan. 14th . Yup, I'm officially the oldest of my friends. Even the guy I'm dating is younger than me!  It still was wonderful and once again my friends revealed to me just how much I'm loved...lucky girl I must say. Lily, Tracey and Loreg (sp?) took me out to this Spanish place called "La Luna Negra" Ohhh, the sangria was to die for and the food even better. On Thursday night, the work gang and I headed out to the Burbank Bar & Grill to take advantage of the happy hour--good times! Friday was awesome. Cesare took me to this swanky restaurant called Crustation in Beverly Hills. I had crab, a whole crab that is, that was marinated in butter and garlic...holy cow, what a party in my mouth! The evening was fabulous and I'm definitely appreciative to have a man that has taste!!!  Friday night at about 11:30, Cesare dropped me off at the airport. I was taking the red-eye to New Orleans to meet Hannah for our tour of the Big Easy! Lily was suppose to accompany us but she became deathly ill the night before and couldn't join. Boooo! Once I finally arrived after a stop in Minneapolis, MN, Hannah and I took right to the Big Easy. First stop: Binets (French donuts), then we bought Cigars for that night, and then we headed to Pat O'Brien's for a Hurricane. We were set to take over and definitely live it up in the Big Easy...well it had different plans for us. Around 5pm it started raining cats and dogs...pouring like I've never seen it. Hannah and I, soaked, headed back to the hotel to rest and nap before that night's festivities--Bourbon Street!    Hannah treated me to dinner for my birthday. We weren't sure where to go, but after consulting the concierge we decided on a Creole restaurant named Murielle's. Holy cow...definitely one of the best meals I have ever had in my life!  Everything was unbelievable and just melted in your mouth. So when in New Orleans go to Murielle's!  That  night we got on our party tops and headed to Bourbon Street. Ya, basically we were in bed by 1:30. Bar after bar, we tried to find some place that has some class and just wasn't full of disrespect. Quite an eye opener. The last straw was when some gross, pervy guy rubbed his stuff on Hannah's calf...ya, it was time to go.  The next night we ended up at a nice club called 360degrees. Quite nicer and definitely more our speed. We danced the night away and enjoyed experiencing a club in the south. Overall, we had a blast but I definitely can cross New Orleans off the list and don't think I'll be returning any time soon...  The best part of the whole trip was the Funeral parade that we were fortunate enough to see on Sunday. It was amazing. The street was full of "Tuba's" (the guy who died) friends and family and also mixed in tourists and funeral regualars. Boys played on their Saxiphones, trumpets and tubas--perfectly performing many hot popular radio songs. People were dancing in the streets, drinkin' and just celebrating life. We overhead one woman wisper quite a profound statement that made all the maddness infront of us make sense, "How you live is how you die." Sounds simple and obvious, but really it is so true. Celebrating the life of the deceased is so much more important and less selfish than mourning for them. Really, death is a time of celebrating one's accomplishments and simply who they are. Easier said than done I'm sure. But that is how I want to go, in many many years that is, with a celebration!

      Interesting article regarding health and diet from MSN...I guess it's true: You are what you eat.  It's a bird ... it's a plane ... it's ... walnuts? Don't laugh. The humble walnut, along with a dozen other dietary choices -- from beans to yogurt -- is no less than a "superfood," say some health experts.    Steven Pratt, MD, is one of them. In his new book SuperFoods RX: Fourteen Foods That Will Change Your Life, he goes into detail why he thinks these foods are so potent.    Pratt, an ophthalmologist who specializes in ocular plastic surgery at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, Calif., says he became convinced of the power of these basic foods when he saw the positive results of a few simple diet changes in his patients suffering from age-related macular degeneration -- a leading cause of blindness.    "Whether you're trying to prevent cataracts, macular degeneration, cancer, or cardiovascular disease, the same type of preventive dietary measures apply," he says. "The whole body is connected: a healthy heart equals a healthy eye and healthy skin. You'll hear about all these special diets for special health needs, but really, the same diet and the same lifestyle choices prevent the same diseases. With rare exceptions, you don't need 20 different preventive modalities -- just one really good diet."    And that "one really good diet," Pratt says, should be founded on these "superfoods":    Beans  Blueberries  Broccoli   (Ya Berger! Miss. Broccoli USA) Oats  Oranges  Pumpkin (Pumpkin Pie count?) Salmon   (had it twice last week!) Soy  Spinach  Tea (green or black)  (Greeen every morning, except today. I'm out so I'm having Black Chai Tea) Tomatoes  Turkey (My favorite...) Walnuts (yummy in salad, and free from Uncle Larry the farmer!) Yogurt   When incorporated into your regular daily diet, these foods, says Pratt, can stop some of the changes that lead to diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, Alzheimer's, and some cancers. "I picked them out after researching all of the world's healthiest diets: for example, Japanese diets, Mediterranean diets, and even some of the healthier dietary patterns in the United States," he says. "I noticed that it's the same food groups wherever you live."    Walnuts: The Good Fat    Every nut, even macadamias -- the fattiest -- has been found to improve cholesterol, Pratt reports. "Walnuts are among the superstars. They're an excellent source of plant-based omega-3 fatty acids," he says. Salmon is another great source of these heart-healthy fatty acids.    "Studies show that you can lower your risk of cardiovascular disease by 15% to 50% if you eat a handful of nuts five times a week. If you found a pill that did the same thing, you'd make a fortune." Of course, chowing down on a huge tub of walnuts can be counterproductive, so as always, watch your intake. A handful of dry, roasted, unsalted walnuts -- about 14 walnut halves -- has about 150 calories, and is enough to yield "superfood" benefits.    Add Some Color to Your Diet    It is true that good things come in small packages. Used by Native Americans for medicinal purposes, blueberries are a tiny fruit that combines a wide variety of nutrients. "Blueberries don't have a huge amount of any single nutrient, but they have the synergy of multiple nutrients," Pratt says. "There's vitamin C, folic acid, fiber, carotenoids, and hundreds of other compounds in this one small fruit. Blueberries also have a very thick skin, which is where nature packs most of its nutrients."   When you're thinking "superfoods," think color, says Beverly Clevidence, PhD, a research leader at the USDA's Diet and Human Performance laboratory. That means foods that are deep blue, purple, red, green, or orange. They contain health-enhancing nutrients that protect against heart disease and cancer, and also improve our sense of balance, our memory, and other thinking skills.   Nutritionist Kathleen Zelman, MPH, RD, director of nutrition of the WebMD Weight Loss Clinic, offers these tips on how to add some color to your diet:   Top your cereal with almonds or berries; add tomatoes to sandwiches, soups or stews; layer your whole grain bread sandwich with slices of peppers and fresh spinach.  Pack a snack bag of nuts, baby carrots, raw broccoli, grape tomatoes, and bell pepper slices for a nutritious pick-me-up between meals.  Fruit and nut granola bars stash easily into briefcases for quick energy and a tasty treat.  Soy for Cholesterol   "No, adding soy to your diet does not mean pouring more soy sauce on your Chinese food," says Leslie Bonci, MPH, RD, LDN, director of sports nutrition at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. It does mean adding soy foods such as tofu, soy milk, soy nuts, or the green soybeans -- called edamame by the Japanese.   Not everyone is convinced about soy's heart-healthy benefits but its cholesterol-lowering benefits do seem powerful enough. A study reported July 2003 in The Journal of the American Medical Association showed that a diet of soy fiber, protein from oats and barley, almonds, and margarine from plant sterols lowered cholesterol as much as statins, the most widely prescribed cholesterol medicine.   Tofu takes on the flavor of foods that it is cooked with, says Zelman. Try a stir-fry of colorful veggies and cubed tofu with a light Asian sauce for a quick meal. You can also find cereals at the store loaded with both soy and fiber. Serve with skim milk and you'll get three super nutrients for breakfast.   Take a soy protein bar for a quick snack or lunch during the day. Soy nuts are another great portable snack option.   Edamame (Japanese name for green soybeans) are snacks even kids will love! Find these nutritious nuggets in the freezer section at your supermarket. Serve them plain or with a low-fat dip.   Fiber for Your Whole Body   Beans and oats are great sources of fiber. Fiber helps keep our cholesterol and blood sugar levels low and our bowels functioning smoothly.   Studies show that dietary fiber -- including foods such as apples, barley, beans and other legumes, fruits and vegetables, oatmeal, oat bran and brown rice -- clearly lower blood cholesterol. High-fiber foods are also digested more slowly, so they don't cause spikes in blood sugar levels like white bread, potatoes and sweets do. Of course, everyone knows that fiber helps keep you regular. High-fiber foods also help us feel full, making it easier to control weight.   Read food labels to find whole grain breads and cereals that provide three or more grams of fiber per serving, says Zelman. A bowl full of bran or high-fiber cereal is a great start. Whole fruits and veggies are great for a healthy dose of fiber. Aim for five to nine servings of fruits and veggies a day for a healthy dose of fiber. Juices don't contain as much fiber as whole fruit. And beans are loaded with fiber and protein, so add them to soups, stews, salads, eggs, and salsas.   Calcium for Your Bones    Yogurt and other dairy products help keep your bones strong and lessen your chance of fractures as you get older, calcium also keeps teeth strong, helps your muscles contract, and your heart beat. Recent studies have even shown that calcium may lower your risk of colon polyps, and help you lose weight. Researchers at Purdue University found that women who consume calcium from low-fat dairy products, or get at least 1,000 milligrams a day, showed an overall decrease in body weight.    Dairy products are the best source of calcium. Choose skim milk, low-fat yogurt, and low-fat cheese to avoid saturated fats. A single serving can provide you with 20% of the 1,200 milligrams a day you need. You can also add calcium to your diet with calcium-enriched cereals and orange juice. Foods such as dark green vegetables, dried beans, and sardines also contain calcium.   Start your day with café au lait made with half skim milk and half strong coffee, says Zelman. Add a bowl of whole grain cereal topped with skim milk and fresh fruit for a breakfast of champions. Snack on low-fat yogurt or cheese between meals for an energizing treat.   Another plus for the "superfoods": they can all be found in pretty much every supermarket in every town in America. You might not be able to buy bok choy everywhere, but every grocery store sells broccoli. Both dark green leafy vegetables with similar health benefits, broccoli makes the "superfood" list and bok choy is one of its "sidekicks."    So are "superfoods" for real, or just another diet-book gimmick in a market flooded with them? "I think it's a good message," says Beth Kitchin, MS, RD, assistant professor in the department of nutrition at the University of Alabama-Birmingham. "There's good data to support the health benefits of all these foods. They're what we might call 'functional foods,' because you eat them for a very specific purpose. The walnuts and the salmon are a great source of omega-3 fatty acids, yogurt is a great source of calcium and natural bacterial cultures that help maintain a healthy digestive tract, and tea has been shown over and over again to have a role in preventing some cancers."    Can you lose weight on a "superfoods" diet? Of course you can, says Pratt, although that's a side benefit. "The Superfoods way of looking at things is a lifestyle choice, not a weight-loss program," he says. "But if you make these foods a lifestyle choice, you'll feel better and you'll look better."

      Very strange but right now my vision is extremely blurry. I just downed a triple shot cafe latte...could that be it? I don't know but damn I'm having trouble focusing out of my right eye. Weird...  Very strange but right now my vision is extremely blurry. I just downed a triple shot cafe latte...could that be it? I don't know but damn I'm having trouble focusing out of my right eye. Weird...  Last night I saw Lost in Translation. A good movie, but not one of my favorites. Cesare and I made salmon for dinner and drank some of my new favorite wine...German wine that I can't pronounce. Lately I'm all about the vino. Not sure why, but I've bought like 5 bottles in the last week. I haven't drank them, except for last night, but I look forward to tasting all! We had a good night and slept well. This morning I got dressed after trying on 3 different outfits, and then proceeded to drop my mascara wand on my shirt forcing me to return to the disheveled closet in hopes of finding something else that isn't homely, makes me feel young while professional. Not easy, let me tell you. That reminds me...yesterday one of the new interns said, "Oh, you look homey." I said, "Gee thanks, Homely or homey..." "Ahhh, no just comfortable." I wanted to respond, "Ya, I try not to look like a slut when I come to work. I usually reserve the lace tops for the club or the bedroom!"  Most of the new interns suck.  Hannah is home in two days!!!!! I can't wait. I hope we get a chance to go out and tear up the town...ahh we have so much fun. Either way, at least we'll be able to all hang out for a little bit.   Tonight's agenda: cleaning our part of the closet, exercise, a chat with Kim, and healthy eating. Yesterday I felt skinny, today...ughhh today I don't. How quickly things change.

      Yesterday I was feeling very unsatisfied with my job. For the first time since I took this new position, I browsed online job postings looking for anything a little more intriguing. Preferable somthing in marketing or business development. Well, a man named Sandy with impecable timing e-mailed me regarding an analyst position with Notel Co.--their sole comodity, Ketle One Vodka. He is a headhunter within the wine and spirts sector and seems like quite the sales man. I sent in my resume today and hopfully will be interviewing on Friday. Only problem, the job is in Laguna Nigel...back in the OC. It is not that I don't like the OC, it is just that I moved to LA to pursue opportunities out here and to live in a place that always has things to do and that is full of diversity. OC is nice, but boring. We'll see. Way to early to tell if I'll even get the interview...keep your fingers crossed though. I could use the raise!

      Today has been a good day. Went to bed early last night, around 10:00. (Belinda called at 10:15 and was like 'Old Lady...!") The new featherbed mattress is like the best thing ever! My bed was a little firm so this has made any minor back ach I used to have vanish...thanks mom! So I woke up feeling extremely refreshed and rejuvenated. Then when I put on my work khakis that I ware probably once a week, they were loose! Ya man, waist line is diminishing...or at least today isn't expanding. Always a good start to the day. Then I made the most fabulous lunch and trotted off to work, only 10 minutes late--not the usual 20. Ya man...a morning was much needed!  Over the last month I have been spoiled rotten with excellent meals. Not just good meals, over the top excellent! It all started with Christmas dinner at the Anderson's--one of the best ever, then was followed by yummy dinner at Hannah's house (her mom's lasagna), then my birthday dinner at La Luna Negra, then another birthday dinner at Crustation with Cesare (who many times has tantalized my palate over the last two months), then one the best dinners ever at Murielle's in New Orleans compliments of Hannah, then dinner with Mom at the Vineyard Room at CA Adventure, and finally on Thursday fine dinning at Yamashiro's with Cesare. Mixed in many dinners, lunches and mornings from Starbucks to Burbank Bar and Grill to Sushi Zawa--All of this to tell you that I have found a new appreciation for food. Red Robin just doesn't do it for me anymore. Ambiance coupled with rich petite dishes are what I crave lately. Fresh ingredients and even organic products have made their way into my cupboard. Don't get me wrong, convenience still occasionally wins over decadence--last night for example, a can of Chicken Dumpling soup, garlic bread with olive oil and a bite of Cadbury chocolate to finish the meal sufficed.  Still different than what I previously would of concocted. Instead of the organic garlic bread from traders and olive oil (special delivery from Italy, thanks Cesare), I would of had Lo-cal toast with butter spray. I'm not saying that a burger and fries isn't on my wish list anymore, but simply that I've discovered that quality was under-rated in my book. Thanks to all that made fine dinning possible for me: Hannah, Lil/Tra, Cesare, Mom and Mrs. Anderson. The party in my mouth continues...

      Thank you to Kim and Hannah who finally updated their blogs! Whether it be full of profound statements or blabbering on about nothing, I enjoy learning about what is going on in my friend's lives. I wish more of them blogged!   This weekend was really nice. My mom was in town Friday morning until Sunday afternoon. On Friday we went to Disneyland and California Adventure for free of course...thanks Mickey....and ate at the most wonderful restaurant for dinner at CA Adventure. I wasn't looking forward to eating at the park. Past experience says that park food is too expensive, tastes cheap and is greasy. Well, for all of you fine dinners out there go to California Adventure's "The Vineyard Room. Seafood soup, a main course--salmon for me, chicken for my mom--and a chocolate cheesecake souffle all went down the hatch effortlessly. All the while, our openly gay waiter rolled his eyes in jealously wishing he could have a bite but arguing with himself over the calories...funny but slightly disturbing at times.   We left Disneyland happy campers, the parks goal accomplished--happy customers who spent a lot of money.  Saturday, mom and I headed down to Santa Monica. We walked on the beach, walked down 3rd street promenade, sipped on Mochas and went to see the movie "House of Sand and Fog" (compliments of Cesare...) Then we were off to dinner at another Italian restaurant. The first table the hostess sat us at wasn't good enough for the Madre, so we moved into a cozy corner where on the left a "first meeting" of a boyfriend and the family was taking place and on the right a model type, her mom and her way cute gay looking man sat nibbling on tomatoes and mozzarella. Good dinner and good conversation. Mostly about the movie--good, but depressing. Makes you think, which in my mind is always a sign of a good movie. It made me realize that forcing anything will only make this worse for you and probably for other people as well. You have to see the movie to fully understand, but take this advice. If it isn't meant to be then let it be...don't force it. Things have their place and their time to settle, all will work out. A lesson I still struggle to learn, but at least I know that I shouldn't force things. Whether I do or not...well that is a whole nother issue.  The other thing I realized this weekend is that everyday I take so many things for granted. We all do I guess, but things like feeling the sun on your face or the smell of a forest are all things I love and feel good yet I rarely experience. Do I go outside during the day? Nope. Do I take walks on the weekend in a wooded area? Nope. Watch TV, go to the mall, go to bars, eat out...make out....ya need to get back in touch with the simple things in life. Really cheesy I know but something I realized while at California Adventure on the ride "Soaring over California." Remember this next time you're having a bad day. Sit in warm water, and feel its warmth. Take the deepest breath you can--in a place with clean air of course--and feel your lungs fill deep in your belly (this one is a good one, it is amazing how little we use our full lung capacity.)  I'm sure everyone has their own things to help them feel "in touch" again...these are two of mine. Working in an office, sitting on my ass, and trying to keep myself mentally stimulated all day isn't good for me, hence why I come up with these stupid things to keep me going. Ah, need to change directions but right now I'll let things be. I kinda feel like something good is on the horizon...we'll see.

      Quick update before my meeting...talked with Cesare on Wednesday night and we are now going to continue dating but just casually, nothing too serious. First he said he didn't know how we got to the point of ending it...ya hello you said you wanted to be friends, and then all became clear on what was really going on in his head that night.  He is afraid of getting too latched on and then loosing sight of the big picture.(Kim you were right...) I can see what he means, it can happen when people start getting serious. Especially right now in our lives, a significant other isn't what we should be focusing on. So all is good now, we'll see how it goes. It lifts a lot of pressure off of me to be ready to commit to him, so that is nice I guess.   In other news...last night Michelle and I headed to Skybar for pre-club drinks. We thought it would be fun since we've never been. So nice inside and damn it was so freakin' romantic. Great place for a date or just an intimate evening. We were lounging on the stairs, sitting on pillows, when an Argentinean man swaggers over and plops down next to us--and close to us, not the same sense of personal space I guess. We're chatting and eventually wonder over to meet his friends who were laying, yes laying down, on the huge mattress by the bar. Michelle and one of his friends taking a liking to one another and I continue talking to my new friend--can't remember his name. Then the Moet is poured and he toasts..."To our first child..." Whoa, funny these South American guys--weird. The second glass...and toast, "To our second child..."  That one was followed by in broken English, "Do you want to spend the rest of your life with me..."  At this point I just was laughing, what guys will say to get some. Being the klutz that I am, a little champagne dribbled on my chin and he lungs at my face and starts to kiss/lick it off...what the hell! Back off there bucco. This continued and eventually I had to keep pushing him away and said, "don't make me violent bc I will..." That's right! Anyway, supposedly he was a professional golfer in Argentina and he and his friends were just traveling around the US before his season starts back up again. We had to leave to go to the Century Club so I wondered over to find Michelle and there she was making out with the other guy...oh, so weak. ;) She jumped up with no problems and we bounced. Funny evening, and could have been quite eventful if we had stayed there all night.  Century club was kinda ghetto. I have never seen so many short ass tight skirts in my life...it seemed like there were video hos everywhere. It was suppose to be Allen Iverson's party thingy which I'm sure is just a ploy to get people there. We didn't have to pay since we were on the list thank god, but damn were people using every tactic to cut in line. It was ridiculous, both guys and girls were cutting and coercing--ridiculous. Good music, danced a lot but that's all. Left at about 1:00 and headed home. Overall a fun night, and definitely new experiences.   A new guy has joined our team at work. I am going to be working directly with him on our In-Store execution project where I may be going to NY to help train!!! Not sure if I get to go yet, but we'll see. He is cool and seems to have a lot of industry experience so that is nice. Totally flamboyant too which is fun and already he makes me laugh--seems like we'll get along just fine. I've been happier at work bc I'm actually getting things to do and being exposed to other sides of the business. I just think I need to work on communicating to my manager when I feel bored or unchallenged. I'm sure she'd help to find things for me or to at least let me go to meetings just to listen in. Another thing to work on....yippie!   Speaking of things to work on, I need to become more emotionally self sufficient. I depend way too much on my friends and family to help me through the harder times. It is not like I have a lot of them, but when I do I just can't seem to function without being depressed or mopey. I need to get over it and just deal with the pain and work through it on my own. Things do work out eventually, just at the time I hurt so badly that I want to talk to a friend, someone who knows me and loves me for who I am. Still I'm sure it gets old and I don't need to be bogging my friends down with my issues, not that they don't want to know what is going on but whatever, I still need to be less reliant on others to feel emotional secure. Through the Cesare experience though I did get reminded of what I deserve and how I deserve to be treated...a very important lesson!   Life is all about learning and growing I guess. Mistakes are made here and there but overall if you're learning from those and moving on then I guess that's what matters.   My manager just came in and was like what are you doing...so I better move on and get some work done. ;)

      It has been way too long since the last time I wrote. A lot has happened though. I've been in such emotional turmoil and confusion that I don't think I could of wrote a clear and complete sentence.   So aside from my last few entries on food...get over it Liz!...Cesare decided that on Friday night, the day before Valentine's may I remind you, to break it off--no not break off a piece, to end "us", the dating... Shocker!!! to say the least. I guess when I told him on Tuesday that I wasn't sure if I was ready to call him my BF it affected him a lot more than he lead on. He said that after that moment he started thinking...which lead to these conclusions: -my life is just starting, maybe I don't want to be committed -been in these situations before where both people don't feel the same and got hurt -I think you're great, want to hang out...but not for a while can't handle it yet  We both were a mess, crying and talking. I was in such shock I didn't know what to feel or think or do for that matter. It took me two whole hours just to figure out what he was trying to tell me--I original thought he just wanted to slow it down not end it. After hours of confusion, I left. At first I thought, this is okay. It's meant to be, I wasn't in love with him and don't know if I ever could of been. Then I get home, hours pass and I start thinking about it more and more....sitting in the bar, have to leave bc I'm crying, talking on the phone, start crying...a mess, a complete mess. Didn't expect to be that way but apparently I didn't realize how much I liked him until he was gone. Story of my life I tell you. Anyway, long story short...once again my friends pulled me through it, going out with me and just chatting with me on the phone. I still am sad and still miss him. I want to be with him, how long our relationship with last I don't know, but I know that as of right now I have strong feelings for the quirky guy I was a little unsure of. I began to love all the little things i was unsure of about him. As of now, we haven't talked. He wrote a little e-mail in response to my call requesting we hang out saying wants to hang out in the next few weeks but isn't ready yet. I wrote back saying that I wanted to talk about this bc I feel that now that I've been about to digest some of this we can actually talk about what he's feeling, so we'll see if he picks up my call tonight. Ahh, why I remember it is so much easier to be single and not deal with this ish...  THANK YOU to my girlfriends, to which I would not be sane or dry eyed at this moment if it wasn't for them. (I'm still wierded out by how much this affected me)  Had a second interview today with Ketel One. I think it went well but I may have messed it up at the end, we'll see. I'm not even sure how I feel about moving anyway at this point.  Tomorrow night I plan on shakin' my booty on the dance floor. Allen Iversen is hosting some party at the Century Club so I want to go...hopefully Lil will want to join me. I know Michelle and Claudia are going, but Claudia and Lil don't mix so we have to avoid that situation.   This weekend is totally open, more cleaning I think. I cleaned out my bathroom the other night when I was bumbed out--the best medicine alone--and I felt like my Chi was relieved, better flowing and less bogged down. Damn, just think how I'd feel if I actually cleaned out my whole place! Working on it...

      Okay, guess things are back up and running. I thought they cut me off for blabbering. ;)  Last night we hit The Standard Downtown. It was pretty hot, very good place for a first date and drinks with friends. Seeing that it was a Tuesday night, the roof-top bar was filled with mostly business men and a lot of foreigners--I'm assuming hotel guests, which made for an interesting and eclectic crowd. Design wise, very LA and very "mod". Everything was red. The carpet, chairs, tables (okay some were yellow), lighting, even the bartenders were wearing all red outfits. The best part besides the open air and city view--downtown LA skyscrapers surrounding--were the water beds that line one side of the pool. Yes, that's right water beds! I haven't sat on one of those things since I was like 8 when my parents had one of those, half waterbeds half mattresses--suppose to help support the lower back. They were encapsulated in these red, of course, space age like domes with little eye drop cut outs so that you could climb though and plop. Being the slightly perverted ole me, I slapped the water bed and said, "Ah, now doesn't that sound familiar..." I'm horrible. Everyone was busting up, but still who's the Ho now, hu? Just fabulous. They also had an old time movie playing that was projected on the wall of the building across the street. Couldn't hear anything, but a cute idea. Music was this retro-funk stuff that got old after a while, but eventually after 12 the dj started playing some hip-hop so of course I made way out on the dance floor. I ended up dancing with some guys, one of which was some scary weird, metro sexual type. The other who I had spotted across the room earlier and said, 'hey hey now...', he ended up asking for my digits. Gave them to him, but don't think I'll talk if he calls. Anyway, good times and definitely a place to take out of towners for a very LA experience, during the week that is. On the weekends I hear it is way stuffy and the $10-$20 cover is enough to turn me away, especially if I'm just going to chill and hang out and not be at a club. ($10 parking, Gin and Tonic $9, Long Island $12) If you were a true baller, this would be a great place to rent out for a party or special event. Smokers can smoke, intimate places for getting to know you moments, and plenty of room to mingle and dance....if there was appropriate music that is.

      Oh, one last thing...I'm addicted to nuts, trailmix, you name it. Yummm. Not good though, well good in small amounts but if you know me you know that small amounts of something I like is hard to do. Better keep this ass moving or it may double in size by next month! Oh, that would be scary...

      Heading home from work in a minute. Overall not a bad day. Now that I am in this whole new mindset--a positive one that is--I am much happier and feeling more "lizzie-ish" than ever. Why I was such a downer for a while, I don't know. But like Diana said I lost my fire. I'm back ladies and gentlemen. My new fun mission for the next few months: go to a bar I haven't been to in LA County. Whether that is by myself or with friends I don't care, but I moved here to experience it and I have the options available to me, so damn already...take advantage of it.   I just signed up with "Disney VoluntEARs" (oh the magic and cuteness has no boundaries here at the mouse house) to help with a silent auction for the La Canada Flintridge Educational Foundation. It's giving up a Saturday night, but no big deal...it's just one of many. It should be fun. We get to dress up in cocktail dresses and have a yummy dinner (i think we do, may have to eat in the kitchen but that's okay) and an evening at the Biltmore Hotel in downtown. Fellow intern Patrick is going to join me, which will be nice so I don't have to play "making friends" with all the other volunteers. It's not until March 13th...  After work I'm heading to Verizon to get my phone fixed. It never fails. Every 7 or 8 months something breaks. This time it is my antenna "holder". The antenna itself is find, but the hard casing around has come loose and now slides back and forth on the antae like a ring on a string. Annoying! So we'll see if that is covered in the plan.  Tonight it's "New bar of the week" night. Heading with some fellow interns to Flint's down in Santa Monica...will give reviews tomorrow. ;) At least my friends can think of this as me wasting my time going to the crappy places to find out where is worth while to go and where isn't!

      Miss Kim is on her way to stardome! Little by little she is making her way into the big business of publishing. Keep your eyes peeled for "Her Home" a magazine that is on shelves at Barns and Noble and soon to be at Wal*Mart. I'm working on finding opportunities as well in the publishing arena. My dream, to be an editor of an interesting hip magazine. Baby steps they say. Just trying to get my foot in the door right now, sending e-mails, mailing resumes, talking to people, et... I know that if I put my whole self into it something has got to happen. At least some sort of opportunity that is remotely related. Even if it was in PR and then a move into magazine editorial. We'll see, but keep your eyes peeled for me!  Work is getting better. Seem to fit better with my manager now. Not that we didn't get along before, but we never chatted. Now I am taking more of an initiative to go talk to her, keep her updated on what I am doing, and let her know what I'd like to do in the future, we have gelled better. She already suggested writing Barbara Walters just for kicks to see if I could do a meet and greet or something. ABC is part of the mouse house, maybe she needs an assistant ;) Ya right, but what do I have to lose right? Diane Sawyer is also a mouse house member so should try her as well. I'm waiting until I have a clear vision of what I want before I start contacting people, then all hell's going to break loose. I still think one of my ultimate jobs would be for work for oprah in some capacity. I just love that woman and love her shows. They aren't retarded like most talk shows, they're classy and interesting. Many don't agree I'm sure, but if I had TiVo I'd tape it everyday. Oh, what a devoted fan. ;) She's coming to LA, tickets are like impossible to get but I'm going to give it a shot anyway. You never know...  I also thought it may be fun to work for a travel company and help host tours around the world. Most likely though it would get boring because you probably do the same tour over and over again. How fun it would be would depend on your group, and that you have no control over. Just a thought though.  I may be going to Hawaii in the next month or so. Diana lives there and thinks what I need is some time to rejuvenate my spirit and to restate my priorities--find myself again. I agree 100%. What a better place to do that than Hawaii? I can get a round trip ticket for about $330, won't have to pay for lodging or that much food, and will only have to take maybe 1 day off work--which I can make up so no missing days pay.  Sounds like a plan to me...now I must see how the finances are doing and then I'll know when it is actually possible to go.  My computer died the other day too, so that is another thing on the list to buy. I can't spend too much time at work on-line researching publishing companies and searching for jobs, so I really need to get my "home base" started up again. Hopefully I'll be moving in with someone within the next month so that I'll be about to save money on rent. I need to head out to Nebraska too to visit Kim and George. Never been, but always always visit my friends where ever they move at least once. Just my thang I guess.   This morning I had a breakfast burrito from our restaurant downstairs and damn was it good. Not really worth the fat and calories but definitely scrumcious. Now I feel like there is a rock in my tummy. It is only 12:00 and I've already had 3 pieces of chocolate, a Breakfast Burrito, and an orange--better lay off for the rest of the day. At least I worked out last night. Squats up the hill in front of my apartment, pushups on the brick wall across the street and ran 1 mile and walked another. Today at lunch--in a minute that is--I'm going to head home and do a little pilates. I think it will help me feel energized for the rest of the day. I get so drained sitting her all day. Thank god for blogging and for friends e-mails or else I'd be bored out of my mind!

      So today has once again made me realize things I didn't want to know. Things I didn't even want to think were possible. Once again I think I trusted too much and made assumptions on what little I knew of a person. Lil has reminded me that guys are guys, and that I shouldn't be surprised when I think that they may be playing games just to get what they want and then take off. Sad, but may be what my situation was about. Don't 100% think that is what happened bc there are a lot of other factors that don't add up to that, but could be a really good act. Whatever. Hung out with you know who on Sunday. Treated me like any other Joe Schmoe you'd run into on the street. Not sure if that a forced I must only like and treat you like a friend or if that's a "I never really had strong feelings for you anyway..." thing. Moving on....  Last night I had a great, absolutely wonderful conversation with an old friend from Jr. High. We've known each other since grade school but didn't become good friends until Jr. High. Diana is so full of life and she is the most spontaneous, wild, and utterly giddy person I have ever met. She goes through a lot bc she takes a lot of risks, but after it all she still has a love and passion for life. Amazing. Just chatting with her last night filled my soul with a little bit of the fire that I've been missing. I've realized that I've been sitting on the sidelines watching my life go by and not playing hard in the game. So today, I wrote some e-mails I've been meaning to get out, did some research about potential fulfilling careers, and am trying to LIVE. Weird but sometimes I forget how to...or I forget that this is my life, my story, and only I can dictate how it goes day to day. I also said something last night like, "When I'm forty..." Diana stopped me and said, "Liz, no one ever guaranteed you 40." Wow, never really thought about that. We assume that these dreams we're putting off will eventually come true. Well, who knows what we'll accomplish so as long as we enjoy and make the most of each day that is what should be important. People create their own happiness and misery...I just need to find out exactly what makes me tick and then go from there in creating my life story and what makes me happy. Only I know what will fulfill me. Damn, a time for growing is understating what it is like graduating form school and being thrown in  eh real world will all doors open to you. I'm lucky that all doors are open to me, a lot of people don't have that option. So I better take control of that and find which one I want to open! If anything, I hope this reminds you that making your life great and enjoyable is up to you...take control bc no one else will.

      New day at work and got irritated with one of my managers. He knows, he definitely was being a little "softer" around me. I'm stubborn, he's stubborn...doesn't always make for a smooth meeting. At our staff meeting today though he got a little cut-off so I think he's getting the point that he's the new kid on the block and needs to step back a little, be less aggressive but still communicate his ideas.  Found out today that my-exboyfriend Dan got into GW University and American University in DC for grad school. I think he is pursuing a masters in Public Administration. Congrats Dan...my hat goes off to you for making it happen! He'll excel no matter where he goes. Said he'll be there come August...Berger, if you'll still be there Dan's coming to town!  Great quote I found the other day. Makes you rethink what kind of people you surround yourself with, but at the same time is a little harsh. I don't fully subscribe to this but it is important to have role models who don't have an agenda for you, i.e. parents, boyfriends, and even some friends.  "Eagles don't fly with turkey's"  Kinda lame quote I know, but makes a point.   I think Mat is right (see his blog) that if people just had more sex--safe sex--then the world would be a better place. I have my own issues regarding sesso, but when you feel good about yourself and sexy and have a safe and comfortable environment to be intimate life is good!  And on the gay marriage thing, shouldn't we be celebrating love where ever we find it in this day and age? Seriously, people need to get over their phobias and let people live!!! (which applies to many other social issues as well.)  I'm excited for my busy weekend ahead. Starting tonight with sushi and sake with Jeremy, then dinner with Lil (finally, we haven't seen each other in two weeks!) on Thursday, second date with Stephan on Friday, brunch on Saturday morning with Jennifer from work, and the Charity event on Saturday night....! Definitely a lizzie weekend--jam packed with no time to let my brain wonder off and start pondering life and all that I am suppose to be doing. In my mom's words I need to "Chill out." Ya my mom said that. "You're going to go crazy if you keep stressing yourself out! Have a glass of wine already!!!" Good advice mom. And yes, I may be going crazy, but hell what a better place than LA to do that. As Lily would say..."Look at all the freaks!" Since many of my friend's claim they are a little nuts as well, at least I know that they'll still love me if I went nut-balls. I bet most of them already think I'm there...

      My gosh it has been a while since I've written...but I've been thinking "I need to blog!" for the last two weeks.  Weekend before last was filled with birthday parties: my coworker Anjannette turned 30, my old Editor Melinda turned 26, and another one I can't remember--nice of me. Went to Busby's in Santa Monica with the old intern crew from work: Jorge, Michelle, Anjana and myself. Good times, and drank way way too much. Got propositioned by an older Aussie guy to take a trip with him to San Francisco and surrounding areas. Right like I'm just going to take off with this stranger... The guy I met at the Standard, Will, was there too and was pissed that I was dancing with some other guy, "the square" as he called him. Left me a funny message later that night, which left him void of any pride he once possessed.  Went to eat at Bob's Big Boy after and regretted eating in the morning...anyone notice a cycle?!? Seriously, drinking and eating late night is destructive to my waistline as recent times are showing...!  Melinda's birthday was much more low key. We went to Cobra Lily for tapas and sangria. The food was excellent and sangria wasn't as good as the sangria at La Luna Negra. Met a cool girl who works in PR--gave me the low down on how all that works. Always networking....!  Last week was one of change for me. I started reading this book--which I have trouble putting down--called Rich Dad, Poor Dad. It is about being financially successful and taking charge of your wealth. I've learned so much already and plan on finishing the book tonight. I have quite a few more to read, "Smart women finish rich." and another on legal tax evasion and real estate. I've realized that your profession and your business are two separate things. Good since what I want to do won't pay a lot for a while...not that I know exactly what that is. Soul searching...always leads to interesting insights about life and the world we life in.  This last weekend was quite packed--my apartment suffered and it a mess right now. Thursday night went to a Whiskey tasting event at Avalon (the old Palace in LA). Hate whiskey, but free food and good entertainment made up for the whisky ridden martinis. You could tell who just came for the free food too. People were bum-rushing the waitresses once they stepped out of the kitchen with a new plate of treats...calm down people. It's amazing how people act when something is free versus if they have to pay--quality is not an issue. For the first time on Thursday night I was attracted to an older man! Kinda weirded me out, this guy must have been 45 or 50, but there was something very sexy about him. I know, I'm a sicko but hey it was a first! We were exchanging glances all night but I was too weirded out to make myself available by stepping away from my group.   Friday night Michelle, Claudia and I went to Clear--my "New bar of the week"! It was cool but not too exciting. Good for a drink and to chat with randoms, but no where I'm jumping to go back to. Got to wear my new top that I got from ArdenB--thanks for introducing us hannah!--and met a guy. I was so trashed. More trashed that I have been in a long long while. I had 4 drinks while I was there, they're hard to turn down if they're free. I was throwing up all night when I got home and had this job interview thingy the next morning. Ya good one liz. More on that later. So Saturday night went out with the guy I met at Clear, Stephan. Ya wouldn't picture a 6'4" thick durable man now would you with a name like Stephan. He's from England, father Nigerian, mother Brazilian. Met him at his condo in Sherman Oaks, then we headed to Mexicali on Ventura for dinner/drinks, then to the Sunset Room, then to an underground after-hours place, and then to Jerry's...long night. Didn't leave his place until 6 am and nothing really happened! Go me...he was disappointed but hey he'll have to deal with that. He treated me to everything and must of spent way too much moolaa but don't think he has to worry too much. Drives a black Escalade with fancy rims (don't know dimensions) of which I got to drive! Ya, lizzie rolling on dubs around the town and then driving it around! Hot, very hot. People kept stopping their cars next to us to look inside to see who it was...very funny. He owns two clothing boutiques in LA and invests in real estate. Perfect for what I just started reading about...what are the chances of that. Problem: he's 33, kinda old, and has a kid. Yup, a 16 month old. The mom is some girl he was casually sleeping with, called him 4 months pregnant (weren't seeing eachother anymore) and he said, "it is up to you" So he is involved in his son's life but not too heavily I think. Whatever, just planning on having fun for now. He says he wants to take me to Vegas, England, etc...and says that he means it. I said last week, "I'm tired of being this 'I'll make it on my own....' I need a sugar daddy" Viola...definitely kidding in the long run but for now cool. Not sure if we'll even go out again, he did call last night but we didn't connect yet. We'll see.  Really happy for Lil. She met a guy that she digs and that is way into her. Keeping my fingers crossed that this is a good experience!   Went to this shady PR intern open house on Saturday morning, Levine PR. This very focused and weird guy who owns the place recruits college kids or just out of college kids to participate in his "internship". Internship, meaning you work for him for free for 6 months and you get a letter of rec out of him. He acts like he is all important but not sure really how important he is. Need to make sure that a letter of rec from him would be extremely valuable, and that he's not just some old fart who likes feeling all powerful over these young people who are desperate to make it in Hollywood. Haven't made up my mind yet if I want to do it or not. May be fun and just a good learning experience but I don't like working for free, makes me feel like I'm being taken advantage of. He claims he will be a good mentor, but not sure how involved and how much personal attention he gives to each person in mentoring their career. Once again, we'll see.  Kim's off skiing, Hannah's coming home in the next two weeks, and my life is rapidly changing and evolving. Life is good, and always keeping me on my toes. Belle and I are meeting up soon too which makes me extra happy. She's going to laugh so hard when she hears about my weekend. Still haven't heard from Cesare. Still miss him too, but realize that timing was off. Also, still pissed that I opened my mouth and now think did I even really feel that way? Was I just scared of being in a relationship, bc even with Stephan I want to pull away. I'm not comfortable anymore being in relationships...different for me. Not sure why I feel this way lately. Anyway, I'm going to give him a call in the next two weeks just to say hi and to see if he got into grad school. It's been two weeks since we've last talked and a three weeks since we "broke-up". I'll wait another week or two until I contact him.  Another day at work....it is already passing slowly. Tonight I'm going to see a room for rent in Sherman Oaks and am going to clean up my mess of an apartment. Still haven't decided if I want to live in Hollywood or not. Saw an apt yesterday that was cool and located on Laurel and Santa Monica Blvd in Hollywood but the room is small and the closet is definitely not adequate for Lizzie--but is any closet? The girl who lives there seems really nice and like HGTV and TLC too! Hope tonight's place is cool, and that the people aren't freaks...far and few between as of my late experiences!    If you made it to the end...thanks for reading, I know I blabber but now you're all caught up!

      I think I may go into toxic shock from all the food coloring I ingested yesterday: green bagel, green cookies, and green beer. And of course to combat the crappy-ness that is this morning, I am drinking green tea. According to my 1st grade 'award winning' book titled "The Red Rabbit", I should slowly be turning green right now. So far, I'm in the clear.   While celebrating St. Patty's day last night, it occurred to me what my biggest pet peeve is--people who lag. I always knew it was something I got annoyed with but damn I was going to bust last night. Some guys from work invited me to go out with them to Pasadena, I told them that Lil and I are going at 9:30 or so if they wanted to join us, and they said, "We're not leaving that late!"  Lil said she wasn't sure she wanted to go anyway, so I decided to go with them. I said I'd be there in an hour, 7:30, and that I'd call when I was out front and we could leave. They acted like they were going to be waiting for me so I rushed around and go there a little early. Then, they said, "oh, come up for a minute we just opened another beer." So I did. When did we leave their place? Oh, 9:00 and then had to make a trip to work to pick up one guy's keys and then drove the 25 minutes to Pasadena. Did we get into any bars? Nope all packed. Mind you, during the hour and a half that we were sitting at their apartment, I said twice, "We should get there sooner than later...." Forty-five minutes later right before they were opening up their next beer I said, "I think we should leave or else were not going to get in anywhere..." Their response, "Have a beer, calm down, it will be fine." Ya, turned out just great. I was in bed at 10:45 and didn't even have the beginnings of a buzz. (which is why I am clueless to why I feel like such crap this morning) First mistake: going out with only guys. Second mistake: actually going to Pasadena at 9:00 when I knew we weren't going to get in anywhere. Damn it, I could of saved $5 and been able to watch American Idol. If, okay when, my girlfriends lag that is another story, ya irritating but not to the same extreme! I'm not anal, I'm just punctual. For some that makes life very difficult and for others it makes life so so much easier....which one are you?  In my irritation last night, I broke down and text-messaged him, Cesare. Nothing big, and nothing I knew I'd regret doing in the morning. Just a simple, "Happy St. Patty's Day" note and that was it. Just want him to know that I still am thinking of him and that I still care, that's all. If I don't hear back that is fine, but if I do, he better be ready to 'talk'. I hope it's the latter.

      Ta Dowww...Like the new look? Since I can't afford to do a total make-over on myself I've decided to give my blog a facelift--content still the same but looks so much more hip! Okay maybe not, but hope you enjoy!  Instead of going on that date last night, I spent my time at home and on the road--running that is. I ran more last night than I have in a long time, probably about 3 miles....and I walked an additional 1.5 or so. I got back at about 8:30, showered and plopped in bed to let my shocked body relax. It felt so good to be physically exhausted. Since I don't have a gym or a man to %&*% for hours I don't get really sweaty that often. I think it is probably the best thing you can do for yourself; to sweat like mad at least four days a week. A lot of toxins get released I'm sure, as well as your heart gets a work out and your bones stay strong. (it's been shown that resistance training helps your bones stay hard as rock! No osteoporosis over here thank you very much...)  Flat out, you just feel a whole lot better. Now the challenge is to remember all of this when I'm sitting on the couch munching' and feeling blah. "Get up and move!!!" Whoa, I sound like a cheesy motivational speaker...gross!  Happy St. Patty's Day by the way! Should be going out tonight, but not sure if I'm actually going to make it out. I have an apartment to see at 7 so by the time I leave work, get to a bar and have a drink it will be time to turn around and go see the apartment. Lil and Tracy may be heading to their favorite place in Pasadena, McMurphy's, to party tonight. It is going to be packed unless we get there early, and knowing how this crew rolls out, early is not likely. As usual I'm down for anything so we'll se what happens.   I've decided that people don't dream enough. Yesterday I was sitting at the lunch table with some fellow interns and the topic of "your dream house" came up. I of course have all sorts of "must haves" in my baller-mansion like fresh flowers, tropical fruit washed and ready to eat in the fridge, an endless river in the back yard, etc... To my surprise, when I asked others they would like in their dream homes they said, "Uhh, lots of rooms..." Seriously, how uncreative is that? Now another girl said something I totally don't resignate with, "I don't think about it unless I can afford it." Okay, but shouldn't you dream? Doesn't that help drive you today so that someday that dream will be a reality? Maybe this is why I'm so impatient, I have so many dreams in my head that I just want to get there and live them already. According to the Wise Ones "The success is in the journey not in the destination." Not sure how much I subscribe to that, but it makes sense. I've enjoyed my life thus far, just want to make sure the rest in the not so friendly 'real world' is just as good.

      I am offically a lame-ass. I called Mene today to schedule the date, then all of three hours later I call to cancel the same date I scheduled. Can we say issues! I'm sorry but you need to offer to pick me up, damn it! Once again, can we say issues! I'd rather stay home, eat dinner, watch the boob tube and go on my nightly walk then try and find Mr. Right. So I called as said, "I'm not ready to date again...I just ended something and think it would be a waste of both of our times at this point....maybe we could reschedule in the next month or two...sorry and talk to ya later"  Ya, don't I sound very stable. Oh, well. At least I have a night at home to myself!

      This morning started off well, with a meeting at the Disney studio and breakfast burritos on the Mouse! With a full tummy I sat through the two hour meeting, putting in my two cents every now and then. Only had to return to the office for an hour before I was off for lunch! I visited an apartment for rent in North Hollywood. The apartment is nice, the people living there seem cool, but the area isn't too great. I have another place to see tomorrow in a house off Barham so I'm waiting before I make any decisions. I've promised myself that I'll move before April 1st!  I got slightly depressed when leaving the apartment. Down by the pool were 6 perfectly bronzed twenty-something girls just hanging out, enjoying the So Cal sun. I thought, "don't these people work?!" The girl showing me the apartment was also appropriately clad in a black bikini and a little pink from her hours of laying out. What a life, someday. I don't plan on working forever!  What is it with guys in southern California that insist that you meet them at their house and then they'll drive to dinner. I don't get it. Hello, you're suppose to pick me up or we are suppose to meet somewhere. Since when has this, "come to me" mentality become standard. All the gentlemen I know always insist they pick me up; making the date convenient for me. I am very close to calling this guy back and saying I'm not interested. Seriously, I even tried suggesting that he either pick me up or that we meet in downtown, but no he didn't get it. Okay, here's directions to my house and we'll leave from there. Over it!   Last night really sucked. (talking to Kim was fabulous don't take offense my friend) but trying to fall asleep sucked. I kept thinking about you know who, Cesare. I just hate that I have no control over the situation even though it effects me. I'm mad, pissed, hurt, hopeless, hopeful, just so confused. I liked him a lot more that I was willing to admit to myself and now I'm kicking myself for opening my fat mouth. Yes, I should be honest with him but now I wonder if I really felt that way. Whatever, I just wish we never met then I wouldn't be going through this.   Moving on to other people's love lives, the next season of the Bachelor started last night. Adam the dorky finalist from "Average Joe" is the new Bachelor, or maybe it the new "Average Joe" not sure the show's title. Either way, this season isn't going to be half as exciting as the last couple. I like watching the Bachelorette so much better bc it is full of good eye candy! The only show on right now that is slightly similar is the one where the girl is trying to decipher is a guy is gay or not, and then has to pick one of the eligible straight guys to win any of the money. I could do that hands down. I still think I have better gay-dar than my gay friends! I'm sure they wouldn't agree...  I guess I need to go back to PowerPoint, who I'm sure is continually jealous of the attention I give to Blogger, and finish up those oh-so-exciting process flows. Operations analysis, the most fundamentally boring task ever!

      So this morning I had one of those moments where you need someone else to brief you on the day and year and your current locations. I awoke at 9:40, contemplated for a couple of minutes if I was suppose to be at work or if it was Sunday, checked my phone for the date, then checked my calandar for the day. Monday it is, and late for work I am! Fifteen minutes later I'm out the door and headed to work which is only 5 minutes down the road; 10:06 and I was at my desk...now that is talent. ;) Thank god no one really noticed bc all my managers were in meetings until 10:30 so bascially a short day for me!  The reason for my late awake...I assume I turned off my alarm in my sleep. I had horrible nightmares last night and at one point remember trying to wake myself up, which I did, but realized I was in REM stage bc my eye balls were jittering all over the place. Very strange, and almost supernatural bc I was awake and remember everything, yet couldn't keep my eyes open and when I did get them to open a little the room was bouncing around. I laid back down and thought happy thoughts. Then not too much longer-- I'm guessing--I had another not so good dream. This time I vividly remember what it was about and know why I'm dreaming about it. So this Friday is my friend Robin Chan's birthday party. At the party will be that whole circle of friends I only really see when I'm at his parties or hanging out with Greg and Jeremy. Most likely, Cesare will be there, bc Andrew will be there. (Remember I met Cesare at one of Robin's parties) I'm slightly anxious about this. He may be out of town or not show up, but still I'm nervous. So in the dream he was acting non-schalant towards me, was getting some sexual favors from some random girls at the bar in front of me, I proceeded to through a beer on him, we continued to argue, I was crying, he was being a typical "I don't care guy", and then I left the bar in tears and was surrounded by pairs of dancing cats and dogs in costume! Adding to my confusion this morning I'm sure.   I really don't get guys right now and don't get why things never work out between me and them. I swear the Bailey women are cursed! For example, this little thing with Stephan, already over I think. Went out on Friday had some issues during the night and then by Sat. morning he left and we haven't talked. Not sure if we will or if I want to but damn, can't things just be merry and work out once in a while!  To get away from my man issues, I went to the race track on Friday with my friend Jorge and won a whopping $10!!!! (one one race that is) I bet a total of $12 on two races, lost both bets the first race, and then won all three of my bets on the second race. So I was only down in the end $2. Very fun and would love to go back on a Sat or Sun just to hang out all day, eat drink and bet. Definitely an interesting and diverse crowd--but oh so exciting.   Still looking for a new place to live...have coffee with two girls on Friday to see if they want me in their apt, going to see another tomorrow afternoon, and wrote another this morning. Keep your fingers crossed!  To Kim's point, hormones are just fabulous. I too was PMSing last week and life did seem just a slightly darker shade of gray. I tried to make it a little brighter by buying ice cream, wheat thins, and cheese at the market--didn't help too much, but for the 10 minutes I was enjoying that rocky road nothing could bring me down! ;)   This weekend I also realized what it meant to be ridiculous. At the charity auction, a 8 week old chocolate lab went at the live auction for $9,000. Yup, you can buy a pure bread for $600. Money to toss around I guess, at least it was for a charity. Tax ride-off I'm sure. Guy probably owns his own business. That was just one of the many ridiculous bids. Another was for a "modern sculpture" that was basically an old, used bicycle seat on a rod that went for $1700--named Lone Rider. It wasn't even by a famous artist!   I'm still devouring every 'financial planning' book I can get my hands on in hopes that I will become financially stable. I will in time, first step: lower rent! Next step, higher paying job. Third step: investment portfolio building. Oh so exciting I know... ;)

      This is the first time I have blogged from home. Usually, a much needed brake from all too often mundane work leads me to blog at the office--what a good employee! ;) I guess I was compelled to write bc I haven't conversed with anyone today, except Jules about 5 minutes ago. For the last week I've been pretty sick--cold, cough, etc...--so I've been trying to recoup today by laying in bed lifeless and mindless, which has left me feeling like a useless waste of space. So, I figure actually doing something slightly productive, like writing even if it's rambling, will get my Brain to do a little work today. It's hard to write though bc I keep getting interrupted with coughing fits. I don't know what my left lung has against me, but it wants OUT! I've been taking Alieve Cold n' Fly coupled with Cough medicine. I keep forgetting when I took each dose so I just take another dose when I start feeling 'drippy' again. It says on the package only take 1 every 12 hours...well, I take one every 8 hours or so. Should I be worried? If I turn up blue in the face somewhere, you all know why: I O.D. on cold medicine.  During my lifeless afternoon laying in bed, I was 'watching' some show on women who all go to this house to try and change or accomplish something they are struggling with. One of the 'life coaches' brought up a good point. "you have to focus to succeed, and you have to have a clear idea of what you want." Duh, right. Then I realized, no wonder nothing in my life right now is going anywhere. It starts then ends. Everything from dating, to new career ambitions, to my lifestyle, to my dreams. I just haven't figured out yet what it is that I want more than everything else for myself. Who I want to be is pretty clear,but what I want to do and what is going to make me the happiest isn't clear. Timing just isn't right yet for me to be extremely prolific. I need more time to sort out what I want to focus on, and then I have no doubts that I will give it my all to make it happen. I just hope I figure out exactly what that is sooner than later. I'm not talking about what I inevitably want to do with myself, but right now, what do I want to do. What would that lead to, or what opportunities does that open up, and how do I get there. More thinking and self discovery. Someday I'm sure I'll look back and think, who would of thunk! I need to take a first step before I can cross the finish line. I guess I'm scared of taking the wrong first step, but hey, any step is better than just standing there. I can always turn around or change directions. I may get my feet pretty tangled for a while, but with time they'll get it--I hope!   Speaking of getting my feet tangled up, tonight--despite the cold--I'm going salsa dancing. Watch out now! ;) I'm wearing my 'salsa shoes', the ones with a red flower on the toe (very cute if I may say so) and some outfit that hides my growing waist line! (damn trail mix!) I realize that I shouldn't be going bc I'm sick, but I've been promising my coworker Jenna for months, and I mean months, that I'd go with her. I've canceled twice and so this time I refuse to be a flake. I have a feeling that there will be a lot of older sweaty men dancing circles around me, but I'll go and give it a try. She's 32 and her friends I'm assuming are the same age or older so this should be interesting. Hopefully I don't bust out coughing while some wana-be 'ricky martin' is spinning me in circles. That would be embarrassing...and gross. I'll be sure to take a couple shots of Robitussin before I leave. Alcohol and cold medicine isn't a good mix I'm sure, I'll just be sure to take it easy on the drinks.

      For anyone who needs a good laugh this morning, here ya go:   Every morning I have green tea and a handful of nuts for breakfast. This morning however, I was out of tea so I opted for coffee. Usually I have a large cup of tea, but for coffee I use a small cup--trust me this will become relevant. I place the handful of nuts is a small cup so that I can pour them out into my hand throughout the morning. While being completely distracted reading Kim's blog--very funny and I feel for ya Kim--I reached for my cup o' nuts. Instead I grabbed the cup of coffee, about 1/3 full, and proceeded to throw it all over myself. I usually kinda toss the nuts around in the cup so I can choose which one I want...this time I tossed coffee all over myself. I sat at my desk, covered in coffee realizing that I mistook the small cup of coffee for the small cup of nuts. My manager walked by and after a good chuckle said, "Why don't you go home and change."  So that was the start to my morning. My cube still reakes of coffee.  Let's hope the rest of the day doesn't follow it's tune!

      Another day at the office...one short from yesterday though. One of our interns got fired yesterday. At 4:00 they had a meeting, and by 5:00 she was gone with her desk cleaned out. I feel bad for her. That has got to be traumatizing and it follows you for the rest of your life. You got fired. You didn't quit, didn't get laid off, didn't move on--they didn't want you and bad enough that they got rid of you immediately. Almost like you are a threat to the company. Funny, once when I worked at the magazine our publisher went ballistic and was firing our Graphics guy. He went in there yelling, "Step away from the machines!!! Don't touch anything. Leave!" (remember that Kim...) That was frightening and only about 3 weeks after I started working there. Funny now, scary then.   Speaking of the magazine, I am writing two article for them for the April issue. I just finished one and sent it to my friend Kim to edit before anyone else see it...and thank God I did. I totally lost my touch. There were so many edits and good ones at that. I have forgotten how to write!!! Well, for magazines anyway. You have to be direct, specific and entertaining. Thanks for the help Kim...I'll be sending another your way when I finish it ;)   Just ten minutes ago I got a call from my coworker Melissa. (we went though the internship program together and now both are casual employees) She said that a friend of hers has an opening as an Assistant Buyer for TJ Max and was wondering if I was interested. Heck ya! I've always thought that would be fun, to pick out what gets sold in stores. I hear that if you're good, you can make bank and it is quite a glamorous job, but if you're not good, you're unemployed permanently! So a gamble, but why not give it a try!  This could also lead to a Category Manager position if the buyer thing doesn't work out or I don't like it. Have no idea if they'd even consider me since I don't have experience, but I think she's going to put in a good word so they give me a try. Keep your fingers crossed...not sure about the details but change can be very exciting!

      Take this quiz and see how you'd do...definitely makes you appreciate the times! (answers on bottom)  1. It's 1928 and this once-taboo activity attracted thousands of women, thanks in part to an aggressive public relations campaign.  A) Working outside the home  B) Smoking cigarettes C) Wearing hats in public D) Wearing sleeveless shirts  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  2. It's 1952 and Reader's Digest publishes "Cancer by the Carton," explaining the dangers of smoking, which many considered safe. What happened next?  A) Cigarette smoking decreased dramatically. B) Sales of filtered cigarettes increased dramatically. C) The United States made smoking illegal for five years. D) The article had little effect on the public.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  3. It's 1923 and you've been invited to the local saloon for a beer. Wanting to remain lawful, you say...  A) Tell me when and where. I'll be there.  B) No thanks. Prohibition makes it illegal to sell beer. C) Sure. I'll buy the first round. D) Not tonight, any consumption of alcohol is illegal. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  4. It's 1907 and women can be arrested for wearing this now-common item in public. Just ask Annette Kellerman.  A) Lipstick B) Shorts C) One-piece swimsuit D) Open-toed shoes  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  5. It's 1885 and women all over are wearing a one-piece blouse and pants outfit called the "Princess Cut." What were you likely doing if you were wearing one?   A) Gardening B) Farming C) Dancing D) Swimming  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  6. It's 1920 and you're suffering from a minor illness. What would a doctor commonly prescribe as medication?  A) Aspirin B) Mud baths C) "Sun Therapy" (tanning) D) Grapefruit juice (freshly squeezed)  Answers: 1.B Before the 1920s, smoking cigarettes was largely a male thing. But George Washington Hill, president of the American Tobacco Company, changed that in 1928 by commissioning the father of public relations, Edward Bernays, to make smoking attractive to women. The promise of glamour, sexiness and fun led thousands of women to light up and make a formerly taboo habit soar in popularity.  2.B The article led to a spike in sales of filtered cigarettes. The following year, however, overall cigarette sales dropped slightly for the first time in more than 20 years.  3.B National prohibition of alcohol (1920-33) - the "noble experiment" - was undertaken to reduce crime and corruption, solve social problems, reduce the tax burden created by prisons and poorhouses, and improve health and hygiene in America. During this time selling intoxicating beverages was illegal in the United States. However, physicians could still prescribe alcohol as medication.   4. C Actress and swimmer Annette Kellerman made a brief publicity appearance on Boston's Revere Beach wearing her usual Vaudeville costume - a boy's black woolen racing suit that clung tightly and left her legs, arms and neck bare. Other women on the beach were wearing traditional swimwear, which included skirts, long-sleeved blouses and stockings. Unhappy with Kellerman's "immodesty," a fellow beachgoer called a cop, who arrested Kellerman for indecent exposure.  5. D The "Princess Cut" swimsuit let women lounge by the pool or the ocean without showing too much skin.  6. C By the early 1920s "Sun Therapy" was very popular and was prescribed as a cure for everything from simple fatigue to tuberculosis. More recently, however, doctors have warned people about the dangers of excessive and artificial tanning.   From MSN Family, Social Taboos

      "I've learned that maturity has more to do with what types of experiences you've had and what you've learned from them and less to do with how many birthdays you've celebrated."  Amen Julie, I couldn't agree with you more!!! This quote is perfect for me. My mom always said I acted years older than I actually am. I remember being a kid, even a teenager, and wanting to wear "mature" clothing. Not trendy stuff, but like my firends call it, "old lady geer". Not sure why I'm attracted to more conservative, Jackie-O clothing but I am. Don't get me wrong now. Some cleavage and leg are definitely necessary in some instances, and I'm glad to bust them out, but on an average day "old lady" cloths it is!   So drama at the office. I think one of the interns is going to get fired soon. Ya, most of the managers aren't a big fan and she lost or "misplaced" many of their pay checks. Talk about misplacing the wrong things...lots of personal information is on those things and they are pissed.

      Finally the cold is subsiding. Last night was the first in many that I actually slept the whole night without getting up to blow my nose, cough up something, or pee! When my alarm went off I was like, "Yes, finally a full night's sleep! I did it!" This morning I don't feel anymore alert than usual though, funny how that works.   Last night I made up for my lazy sick week, I was hyper productive! Besides finishing my second article for Options magazine--which was like pulling teeth to write--I vacuumed, did the dishes, cleaned out half of my shoes, went on a power walk, and cooked like mad. I don't know what it was but I just couldn't sit down. I felt so antsy. Overall I was really impressed with my cooking abilities. Usually when I get home I draw a blank when it comes to preparing something for dinner. A sandwich, canned soup, really that's it, all I eat or "cook". But last night I was determined to 'clean-out' my freezer before the move, which inspired me to become creative. I made lemon caper chicken, curry chicken marsala, and my most proud concoction, a spinach shrimp and rice bisque. Just tried a spoon full of this one and it seemed tasty, we'll see how it really is this afternoon at lunch. I guess I realized I'm not as much of a cooking degenerate as I thought...there is hope!   Yesterday I filled out the application for the Apprentice. I love that show and think it would be fun to be on it. Unfortunately, I think I'm past the deadline. The web-site says semi-finalist interviews are March and April, but then they are holding open calls this weekend across the country (not in LA though) so wouldn't that mean if I send my tape in by mid next week then I'd make it? Not sure, may still try but also may just wait until next season. The probability of actually getting on the show is so low, and they're probably looking for 'super model' type girls and that is definitely not me, but it is worth a shot. Whether it's this season or next, I will be applying for The Apprentice!   A coworker of mine has offered to set me up with one of his friends. This is the same coworker that set me up with that guy that I thought was sooo great over the phone and when we met in person it just wasn't there, at all. This time however, I've seen the guy he wants to set me up with and introduced myself. Definitely cute, and graduated from USC with his MBA so I know he is motivated and hopefully has a good job/future in front of him. We'll see, I'm not sure if David suggested we hang out or if this guy asked if I'd want to hang out. Who knows, but I hope he was the one inquiring.  I'm sending a shout-out to Kim this morning. Sorry for your blah day, those suck. Just remember, you can use these three years for the rest of your life to make George do anything you want...you've paid your dues ;)  Hang in there!  One more thing...I'm seriously contemplating do the Atkins diet. Not psycho carb-a-phobic method but just trying to eat few carbs. I learned at that health lunch I went to that your body burns carbs first, fat second, and protein last. So if I eat too many carbs my body doesn't get to my fat storage for feul. I guess the key is then, low-fat protein and veggies. Working out will just expedite the process of burning this layer of fat that is becoming thicker by the week. Don't want to be super skinny by any means just want to be very comfortable wearing shorts, being naked, etc.... I don't want to fully subscribe yet to trying this but it's on my mind for sure!

      The Date  I met Julien at his house in Pasadena at 7:30, kinda in a shady alcove with other random houses but whatever. Just to be safe, the night before on the phone I asked him what the attire was. He said that the attire "wasn't a cocktail dress but...." so I wore a black skirt, pink and black tank-top and a black blazer with heals, thinking no jeans. He compared the attire to a freakin' cocktail dress for goodness sakes. When I showed up, there was definitely a little bit of an awkward, "uh you're over dressed or I'm under dressed" moment but we got over it. He wasn't wearing jeans but nothing I wouldn't wear to school on an everyday basis. After a glass of wine at his place and a quick chat we went to dinner at a really nice place in Pasadena called Cafe Bizoux--a french place. (Did I mention he is French, from Paris actually? He's only been in the States for 5 years yet he has no accent. bummer)  The food was great and the ambiance even better. Conversation is always good and never stops. Didn't find out anything bad about him and on paper he is great. In person, good but he's a little more animated and 'dorky' than I'd really like but hey, maybe he was nervous. During dinner he had to use the restroom and excused himself. While he was gone an old man came by and was admiring the paintings behind me. We chatted for a brief moment then he returned to his seat. A moment later Julien came back to the table. About five minutes after he returned, the old man came back over to our table, leaned in toward Julien and wispered, "You know she's too good for you, right?" Holy crap, I almost died! Julien said, "Ya, I know that trust me." Whoa, that was funny. I just laughed. Is it normal for strangers to come interupt your date, especially with a comment like that?  Anywho, after dinner we headed to the Ritz Carlton to get drinks. I offered to pay for the drinks bc he paid for dinner, and he let me. I guess that's what I get, I was hoping he wouldn't let me but that's fine. Again good conversation, and being that this was our 3 drink each conversation was a little less philosophical and more racy. A great thing about him is that he isn't shy one bit about sex or anything like that and I definitely find that attractive. I'm pretty sure he'd been good in the sack. Anyhow, here comes the kicker; what's been off-setting since the date. After drinks we decided to walk around the hotel bc it is just that beautiful. Along the hallways there are antique dressers with plants and vases on them. He proceeded to open the drawers and snoop around in them. I'm kinda like, okay kinda weird but moving on. Then we pass by a little phone booth. In the booth is a notepad and pen with the Ritz Carlton seal on it. He goes in the phone booth and takes some of the paper and puts it in his pocket and says, "I could always use some nice Ritz notepad paper, I'm always running out of notepads..." How TACKY can you be. It is one thing if you are staying there and you take the notepaper in the room, it is another thing to be roaming the halls to try and find free things to take that say "Ritz" on them. Not impressed. I didn't know what the hell to say, so I just stood there shocked. Moving on, we went back to his house. He asked if I'd like to come in and I said that I needed to get home, it was 12:30, bc I had to work early in the day. He walked me to my car, gave me a kiss on the cheek and said he'd like to see me again. I said sure, that next week would be good.   So overall, good guy, cute, polite and respectable but not so sure on the notepad thing. That really threw me off...at least don't do that on a first date, later whatever but try and not be a klepto right off the bat!   Then driving home I stopped to get a donut. Not sure why. Haven't' had one in months and just felt like something tasty. There this old guy buying donuts said to me, "You look nice, but you wont look that good in 20 years if you keep eating donuts!" What the hell...okay, thanks for the advice. I replied, "Thanks for the advice, but I don't do this every night." Then he offered to buy my donut. Weirdo! Then heading back to my car, these two guys 'hanging' out smoking tried to pick up on me. What he hell, I'm buying donuts at 12:30 in the morning, how can that be attractive...and I'm not skinny so even more reason it wouldn't be attractive. FYI- donut shops seem to be the new 'pick-up' spots for young people.  Very strange evening overall.  I can't wait! I'm flying home tomorrow and I get to see the pups and my kitty...way too excited to get away and have cable TV! Ahhh, no more golf on Saturday morning....it's the little things, isn't it?

      Once again, Lizzie learns an expensive lesson...  As most of you know, I was suppose to move last weekend to West Hollywood. I planned on renting a room in a 3 bed one bath apartment with two other girls...who I didn't know. On Thursday, my mom made the trek down to So Cal to help me move as she always does. We spent Thursday cleaning out my cluttered apartment and I got rid of a whopping 14 bags of give away--most of you would of had a field day and had new free additions to your wardrobe, too late now unfortunately.  On Thursday my mom took a look at the place and said she didn't think "this is going to work"...room is too small and she thought the complex was too 'ghetto', not that she used that verbiage. I said, "No, it'll be fine. Lets just clean out stuff and move in tomorrow." Mind you we had movers scheduled for Saturday afternoon. We go home, Friday we spend packing and dropping stuff off at good will. Both cars are packed full and we head to the apartment at about 7:00. After two loads and a struggle getting my car in and out of the "parking space" I broke down. With a worried look on my face, I said, "Wait, let me think about this." My mom could see the panic on my face, gave me a hug and said, "It's okay, you don't have to move in, you'll just lose first month's rent." So we decided then and there, standing in the middle of the street with boxes in my arms that I wasn't going to move--well not this weekend anyway. So we went back to the apartment, and brought it right back down to the cars. Thank god neither of the girls were there to witness my state of panic. So to solve this problem, I lied. I haven't lied in years, beside the "I have a boyfriend already" lie you use to get rid of scum bags. I felt so bad after I lied about why I couldn't move in--something about my Dad's health and that I'm moving up to the Bay Area for a couple of months...my Karma is so screwed!  They were cool about it, are mailing me my security deposit and trying to get someone in the apt by the 15th so I can get $300 dollars of my first month's rent back. All in all, this was a $600 mistake, max, and the last learning lesson was a $2400 mistake. Still expensive, but a least they're getting cheaper!!! This one did put a serious dent in the little bit of moola I have saved, but worth it...I think ;)   I'm about to head home to get all dolled up for a date I have tonight. I met this guy about two weeks ago at a friend's birthday bar-get-together. We've talked a lot since on the phone, and hit it off so well. He's fabulous, in a manly way of course ;)  I just hope in person--face to face for the second time--all goes just as well. I don't want to jinx anything yet so I'll leave it at that.   Work has been super crazy...I've barely had time to breath. I enjoy the rushing around but it leaves me exhausted at night. Good think new reality TV shows are starting up... ;) I'm also reading the Da Vinci Code--starting over--and I can't ever put that thing down. I now spend my lunch hour reading by myself in one of the free conference rooms, what a nerd!   Thursday I'm heading home to Freakmont, and I'm returning Monday morning. Easter should be great at my Uncles...lots of food I'm sure. I can't wait to see the pups and my kitty!   A special shout-out to Miss. Berger,  HAPPY PASSOVER!

      Happy Easter to all that celebrated! Hope is was full of chocolate and visiting with family...not in that order of course ;) I had a nice long weekend at home. I think I ate out every meal except for breakfast Thursday through Sunday, and managed to make sure I sampled every chocolate egg within my reach throughout the weekend. On Friday morning I almost killed out older dog Lily, she's 10 yrs old. I decided that I was going to hike the near by "mountain", name Mission Peak, which is about a moderately strenuous 2 hour hike up and hour hike down (running most of the way down bc it is so steep) I took both dogs thinking they'd like the walk and exercise. Chloe was fine, Lily barely made it. We go to within 100 yards of the top and Lily just stopped. She couldn't carry her fat butt one more step. So we sat, they drank my water, and we rested with the top in plain view. Two middle aged "fitness America" types ran by, muscles bulging and smiling ear to ear. Whoa...talk about endorphins. Anyway, we headed back down and met my mom at the base. Good exercise and makes me miss the beauty of the Bay Area. The rest of the day I was pretty out of it and until I ate dinner at Red Lobster, I had a stomach ache. Good news, my butt, upper butt that is, was so sore the next day. Ya! The part that lunges don't work out...I need more hills to climb damit!   Anywho, Easter was good. The food was even better. Nice to be home but know why I couldn't live there. kinda sad bc I can see my mom getting older and the house starting to fall apart. Too much for one person to take care of. Makes me want to move back and help out but that's not going to happen anytime too soon. I really felt like Fremont and the whole Bay Area in general was such a 'sleepy town' when I was home. I guess it is just so much different from LA, the whole pace of the city is different, and you know what, I missed it. I missed LA. Never thought I'd say that!  Guess times are changing....

      Good news...kinda. I just found out that I got a raise, only 2% which is barely nothing. But the extra money per month will help me save just a touch more...when I start saving that is ;)

      Twenty something : issues, as  running : sweating  Again, it seems as if the planets are just not aligned correctly. All my friends seem to be going through some kind of emotionally trying time, including myself. Confusion about what to do with ourselves, confusion about relationships with men (or women), and confusion about careers, confusion about where to live, and most of all confusion on what really is going to make us happy!  I guess it just comes with the time, beginning our lives outside of school. Fortunately for my friends, hundreds of doors are open to them, they just have to choose and figure out which one they want to open. Sometimes it is harder to have to pick than  to have only one option. Either way, we all want to be successful, we all want to be financial stable and then some, we all want a  job we're passionate about, we all want to be happy and we all want to be surrounded by the people we love. It seems so hard to get all this to balance out. I guess you work most of your life toward getting this all to work, making decisions good and bad and then learning from them. I personally just feel like I'm sitting in Limbo. Nothing really is going on but at the same time I can see opportunities they're just not being activated. I feel stuck, like I go from "box to box", apartment to cube at work and back.  Once again, my dreamer quality is persuading me to make decisions that I shouldn't be making. I.e. living in a nicer apartment but not saving any money! I swear, I just want it all. Nothing wrong with that, but at the same time I need to realize that I'm not going to have it ALL right now, it is something that I have to work towards. Saving money, getting a better job, getting a better place to live, finding good roommates, etc.... Uh, I'm am my father's daughter, no patience what so ever!   Here's a shout out to all my ladies that are confused and frustrated with life. Someday it will all make sense and we WILL have it ALL!!!

      PERFECT! Good laugh...  A teacher asked her class, "What do you want out of life?"  A little girl in the back (named Lizzie) raised her hand and said, "All I want out of life is four animals."  The teacher asked, "Really? And what four animals would that be?"  The little girl replied, "a Mink on my back, a Jaguar in the garage, a Tiger in my bed, and a Jackass to pay for it all."  The teacher fainted.

      Wow, it has been a while for me since I've written. When there aren't many entries it means I'm actually busy at work...and will be getting more busy very soon. I think about blogging when I'm at home, but since I've disconnected my home phone line I no longer have internet service. By mid next month I plan to have my "home operation" up and running...  I think I've figured out why I like to blog, why I want my own web-site and why I just love to surf the net. It makes me feel heard and connected. I get to live in this world where I think people actually read what I have to say and enjoy hearing about what I'm doing or thinking. The good thing is that I'll never know that only a handful if that read my blog, therefore allowing me to pretend that I am some profound writer with a following. While I know that isn't true, it fun to pretend. Ah, a little piece of me that doesn't have to face reality and just pretend the world is how I imagine it.   This weekend I ran in the Nike "Run Hit Wonder" Race, 5k. (just over 3 miles) I did a lot better than I thought, 27 minutes flat and once again got in touch with my competitive side. I miss racing! I plan on signing up for other 5ks around the area, and maybe even travel to a few. Eventually maybe I'll try a 10k, 6 miles, but I've never raced such a long distance. Run 6 miles yes, raced 6 miles...no. Two different things I tell you. My friends I went with did well, and came in at around 33 minutes. They ran together. I planned on running with them but then that competitive thing kicked in and I just had to try and challenge myself. I kept picking on person in front of me to pass, then after passing them, I picked another, then another, etc.... The best motivation though was on the 3rd mile, the last stretch Tone Loke (sp?) was singing "Hotel Motel, Holiday Inn..." and I just got the biggest smile on my face and took off. I love music!!! It just makes me want to move, and is an instant energy booster. There were several other bands along the way but none that I new, all "one hit wonders". See the connection now.... Overall a great Sunday. When I got home at 10:30 a.m. I slept for almost the rest of the day. I had only gotten 2 hours of sleep the night before, had a minor hangover in the morning and hadn't been hydrating as much as I usually do. I was tore up...so I slept, then ate, then slept, then ate. I thought to myself, "so this is the life of a cat, not bad".  Today I am having lunch with one of my manager's friends who works in marketing for Disney. I expressed to him my interest and he helped me set up a lunch meeting with her to discuss marketing in general, how to get into the field and what positions if any Disney has to offer me. Just trying to get somewhere...not sure where I'm going or where I'll eventually end up but might as well take advantage of every opportunity that passes by. My other manager Greg has a friend who works for the History Channel and A&E. He said he'd hook me up with his friend to discuss opportunities in producing, always been interested, but haven't' heard from him yet. Keeping my fingers crossed. Whatever I do, I must have the ability to be inventive, to be challenged, it must have some sort of prestige (that's just me), and I must enjoy it! Working with good people are a huge factor as well, but that I feel is more luck than anything. JP, my old boss has also set me up with one girl in PR and another guy in marketing for Warner Brothers. All of these meetings are just "informal interviews", i.e. me asking them about what they do. Not job opportunities, but you never know when a position will open up. Like I said, just fishing around for a fit. I guess we all are and we will continue to search until we find the perfect job. Not that I think the perfect job exists, but definitely something a little closer than what I do now would be good!

      We had the talk, my manager and I that is. It went well, nothing huge but kinda good news for me. She apologized for not making sure I was getting the best projects and that she would make sure to give me the most interesting and challenging projects that grace her desk. For the past couple of months she has be delegating most of the projects to inters and a few to me. I think she realized that she should be making sure my plate is full then going to interns to help fill in the blanks. She also said that with this next round of interns, starting in July, that I will be able to manage one and have them support me. Awesome! I get to put 'management experience' on my resume. While I'm not getting a big raise, or getting full time privileges, I will be getting better work. Thank god bc I was beginning to go nuts. I think they all could tell I wasn't stoked to be here....well less stoked than I used to be. She also told me that I need to let her know when I'm bored, feeling unchallenged or whatever so that she can try and find better projects for me to work on. Deal! I guess in the past I didn't want to highly publicize the fact that I didn't really have too much work to do. Now however, I know she supports me and wants me to have a good experience. AMEN!  Happy Cinco De Mayo!!! I hope everyone has a chance to down a few margaritas and eat some yummy Mexican food. Some work ladies and myself are heading to a Mexican restuarante for lunch, ahh just when I was going to start eating healthy!!!   Which brings me to my next point, my ass and waistline are growing out of control! For the last month I haven't been eating too well. I've been exercising, but not enough to catch up to my calorie intake. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that I've just been feeling depressed lately and am trying everything, including eating, to feel better. Obviously long term this just makes things worse. So I'm trying hard to turn over a new leaf. This morning I went on a 2 mile walk, I had nuts for breakfast, and at lunch today will try to get fajitas and mainly just eat the meat--I need to stay away from the chips! Same old battle...and the saga continues.   I am excited for tonight however...good TV! The bachelor followed by a 2 hour dateline 'friends' special. Good news since the last two nights TV has sucked and honestly, I've just been to lazy to find other things to do. I have dishes that are overflowing in my sink and an ass to walk/run off, so don't ask me why I just sit there. But like I said, I'm trying to turn over a new leaf...or go back to a previous leaf ;) Good times....  Yesterday was the best 'mail day' in a long time. I got my federal tax return in the mail!!! Now I can finally, after waiting for 9 months, go buy a laptop. I plan on saving some of the money, but a large portion of it is going towards my new system. I can't wait. With this new computer I'm getting wireless internet...another cost, but worth it I think. Although until I save more money I may just be going to the local Starbucks or Barns and Noble to use there internet--they are 'hot spots' meaning they have wireless internet servers for free. Along with this new device will come my own web-page...hopefully. I've been wanting to build one forever, so with my spare time instead of watching TV I hope to get that up and running. You may see a picture of you...worried yet ;)  For now I'm out. Oh ya, I'm applying for a job in Toronto Canada...aye.

      This morning I was suppose to have a meeting with my head manager. I was both nervous and hopeful about what the meeting would reveal. Every other time we've had one of these "coffee and update" kinda of meetings it has had to do with job situation. So this could be really good news, really bad news, or cautionary news. Maybe she is trying to get a feel for how I'm liking the job, that is a definitely possibility. I haven't exactly been the usual chipper Lizzie lately and people are starting to notice. One of my managers took me into his office and just flat out asked, "Is everything okay?" I guess my mood is just reflected in my demeanor, probably "I'm not happy" is written all over my face. They think it is work related, which it partly is, but it mainly is just me making that transition to the real world and growing up more and more each day. A sad face once in a while is what happens when you go from an absolutely fabulous life in college to the 8-5 working world in a new place with no familiarity. Anyway, my point is that we didn't have the meeting. She is running late this morning bc her son had to go to the doctors. Now I sit here wondering just what was she going to say. Hopefully I'll find out soon once we reschedule.   For the 3rd time last night, I tried rearranging my furniture so that the TV was not the main focus. I find that since every chair and my bed points to the TV, so all I do when I sit anywhere is want to watch TV. I want a little area just for reading, then a sleeping area, and then a place for my TV where you can see it from everywhere but it isn't the focus. I've decided that this layout is just not possible. I have moved my bed 3 times, my chairs, my 'dresser', everything has moved and  nothing looks as good as the way it does now. At least I got some exercise in and came to the realization to just stop moving things! Once I decorate a little more and nest further, then I hope I'll feel more at home. Not much you can do with on square room, or at least I'm just not creative enough to think of anything fancy to do with a studio. Seriously though, if this is one of the things concerning me, I better re-evaluate what is serious and what isn't!

      What a weekend! I took Amtrak down to San Diego to visit Kim and the fam-bam. It never fails to be a very relaxing and fun time. We ate, hiked, shopped, talked, walked, and SAT AROUND!!! Ah, what a life. I'm not sure what it is about Ramona, Kim's house, or whatever it is that makes visiting so relaxing, but it is. The fabulous company has a lot to do with it I know, but there is something about the environment that is just so soothing.   With all this time to relax, of course my head is going on 'dream' mode. I've come up with a new idea... I've decided that I'm going to look into buying land. Where you ask? Saskatchewan, Canada (you bet I had to look that up for the right spelling...)Why, because no one lives there, land is cheap, and I'm sure very pretty. I think it would be so cool just to say that you own a little piece of Canada. Who knows, maybe someday I'll built a resort on it and market the place as a retreat away from the hustle and bustle of California, New York, or other busy places. I do need to find out however if I have to pay property tax just to own the land. If I do well that idea may be out for now, but we'll see. I'm nuts I know, but it is at least fun to think about.  I've realized something this weekend. LA isn't good for me. It makes me really greedy, and greedy for the wrong things. For fancy cars, and prestige, and a big elaborate house, and jewlry, and fame, etc... When I'm away from LA and just relaxing, I focus on other things like personal fullfilment, and enjoying nature, and keeping my body healthy. Of course I still want a fancy car, a nice house and all the options someone with moola has, but not to the same extreme. I feel less pressured and rushed to get "there" when I'm not in LA. My mom has told me during my more frequent 'break downs' that I will drive myself crazy if I keep stressing myself out. I put so much pressure on myself to succeed, be rich, and do something significant that I get panicked that I won't do it in time or that I will never do it to the capacity that I want to. I'm a dreamer, we all know that. But I tend to dream 10 times bigger than the average person with no idea of how I'm actually going to accomplish my dreams. There aren't specific like, write a children's book about....., they are more on the lines of, write something--a good non-fiction book, a documentary, a children's book, start a magazine, etc.... It is hard to get going if you--one person--want to go in 5 directions. I figure something will prompt me to go in one direction and things will then all fall into place. But I'm really really worried that this will not happen and at 50 I'll be sitting in some cube thinking the same thing. I need to realize that I have to take control of my life and my destiny and not wait for the right sign for it to unfold. Then again I am way impatient and sometimes push things when I should let them happen on their own. Ah, balance again comes into place. Funny how I've never really mastered it. Even more funny how I wrote my college entrance essays on how I've learned to balance my life between all my activities. What a liar!!! or naive to the fact that I had little to balance. Everything was taken care of, I just had to attend. I had not bills, no boss, no future to direct, it was all taken care of for me. Funny how you look back and realize how easy life was even though it didn't seem easy. I'm sure I'll think the same thing one day when I have a family and career. Blah, enough for now. I'm just dreaming of getting home, eating dinner, and into my PJs right now. That seems like a good goal for today. I'll add in, exercise and a little reading and I'm good for today.

      Today is a better day. Not sure why. Maybe the exercise last night helped. I felt really shitty after I worked out, but my mood has been better today. I really think the 'people' factor in my life is the biggest component to my happiness, which sucks bc that makes me dependent on others for my happiness indirectly. But that's me.   I purchased renter's insurance. It costs me little a month and I'm covered up to $10,000 if the place was to burn down, if there was a massive earth quake, or for whatever reason things get damaged with my place. Heck, even if I spill water on my lap top they pay to fix it. If I have a friend over and they slip crack their head open, the insurance covers their medical bills. Why not? Better be safe than sorry I guess. My dad convinced me to get it.   Last night I finally after many trials and tribulations bought a lap top. I've been wanting one for about 10 months now but couldn't afford it until the good old US Gov gave me back some of the money they take every day. I started off at Best Buy, which according to my research has the best base price amongst all computer stores. On Monday they were out of the lap top I wanted. They said on Wed they'd have two more in. I went in last night, don't have any...never got any in. So SOL, the Best Buy girl was realy nice and sent me to Comp USA where she 'knew' some people. They price match with Best Buy so I wouldn't be at a loss for moola. They were out. At this point I'm thinking this just isn't meant to be! The in my last effort I headed across the street to Circuit City. Tada...they had ONE left and it was the same price as Best Buy so no price issues there. I happily walk up the counter, the cashier rings me up, takes my Debt card and says, "Sorry, your card has been denied." WHAT!!! Could something else make this process even more difficult! I know, I had enough to cover and then some in my account. So I called the bank. I guess even on debit cards that is a limit. I had no idea, I thought it was like a check. But then again, I haven't ever tried to spend as much money at one time as I did last night. So, they filled out some form and raised my limit to the amount I needed...and all was good. Thank god! I had previously bought the software I needed from Costco, hauled everything upstairs to my apartment and played with my new toy, my long awaited for toy. It was fun, but I need the internet, which is a whole nother expense. I'm working that out this afternoon. I was content last night. Playing with my computer and watching the 2 hour bachelor special. I had other issues to deal with that night, but this morning I cleared my head and said, "Today is a new day." Maybe that's why my attitude it better. I just am tired of feeling shitting and blah. No doubt I still have issues to get over but that is an ongoing thing. For now, I feel better. No idea what tomorrow or lunch time will bring, but now is good and that is what is important.

      So, today I've had some spare time and thought I should research a little bit about depression. I don't know much about it, well, besides the obvious. But I've never felt so down for such a long period of time. I guess I'm wondering if I need to see someone for help, if this is something I can get over, or if this is normal and just a passing phase. My research shows that depression, not sadness, must be for a period of longer than two weeks. That the normal tasks you use to do now seem impossible to do. Feeling zapped of energy, constantly being tired, and sleeping a lot are all signs as well. Changes in weight, up or down, are also signs as well as withdrawing from friends and family. So, after reading this I think I more than just sad, I'm depressed. Not sure why, what caused it, or how I'm going to get out of this. Which leads me to my next point. on the same web-site there is a test that is suppose to let you know if you should see a doctor. I took it, and according to the test, I need to see a doctor. Just great. I figure I need to deal with these same feelings that keep surfacing, making me feel crapy. This time however, I'm not in my 'prime of life' loving my situation so it isn't easy to distract myself with friends, school, parties, etc...   So in my closing remarks I will say, the last month or so not so great, but that's okay bc hopefully I will learn how to get over these feelings and issues I have, that I have had for a while, so that this doesn't happen again. If it does, well maybe I'll have some 'tools' to better cope. Until next time....

      This will be short, we have a staff meeting in just a few minutes. Things have been better since my last blog. Not by too much, but I feel like the dark cloud that was sitting over my head has now turned into a fog. I'm trying to make mini improvements in my life of the things that I can control. I think it helps too that I'll be off to Chico this weekend to visit Belle and to celebrate her graduation and birthday, I miss her. She thinks I should come stay with her for at least a week this summer and just hang out. She'll only be working about 15 hours a week and will have an extra room. While I don't think taking a vacation for a week will happen, I definitely need to spend more time with the people who know me and love me for who I am. Which is also why I think I'm feeling better. Spending consecutive weekends with family, and with close friends have made me realize just how fabulous my friends and family are. I just wish they all lived down the street and not 2 to 6 hours away. At least they in driving distance, which makes little weekend trips possible. Things are also looking up bc I've found some jobs online that I actually want to apply for. I was looking for a while and didn't even really seen any that I really wanted. Now I'm finding jobs in every market that I consider entering. All I have to do now it start writing those cover letters and applying...we'll see.   Ta Ta for now...

      It's Saturday night and I'm sitting on my bed typing away. I've become addicted to my laptop ever since I got it. I never knew being on the computer could be so convenient and comfortable.   If you know me, you are probably questioning why I'm home on Sat. night...rare bc I usually feel obligated to be out and about every weekend night, not that I have anywhere fabulous to go. Lately though, I've been becoming more of a home body. Ever since my spat with myself, I just like being home and comfortable. Am I over the party constantly phase?! Could the adult, "you must grow up now", phase really settling in? I hope not, I hope it is just a hiatus.   I've come to some good realizations lately. Some may just be from being sick and tired of being unhappy, others maybe from age and experience. They say as you get older you become a lot more comfortable with who you are and a lot less worried about what others think. I'm getting there. I'm realizing that I'm not so bad the way I am, even with the long list of improvements I have running through my head, I need to be content and happy with who I am. Not what pants size I wear today vs last month, or how many Hershey Kisses I've grabbed out of the 'bowl' while walking to my cube. That isn't important in the long run. All temporary. But who I am is forever. Changes occur of course, but the core of what I'm about, what makes me smile deep down, and how I feel when I'm around those who know me better than I know myself will never change.   Life isn't bad, it's just not easy. My opinion: If you always take the easy road life won't be that rewarding. I figure it is when we challenge ourselves that a sense of true accomplishment is felt. Everyday presents new challenges, new temptations, and new rewards. I guess you just have to fight the little battles and then one day you'll wake up and Victory will be declared. I can't wait for that day. That day when I can say "I did it. I can't believe I did it!" "It" is nothing in particular. Maybe it's getting that job I've had my eye on, or fitting into my favorite jeans, or heck even just being content with where I am in life.   I've been so rushed to prove something...to who? I don't know. But you know what. I have a full life in front of me to accomplish things. I need to focus on today first and then before I know it, 100 tomorrows later, I'll have made some real progress. I guess like everyone else I want my life to be great. It will be...if I try hard to make me great, then my life will be great. I have to be with myself 24 hrs 7 days, I might as well like me. I'm working on that, could be working harder at it, but I'm getting there. Ah, the joys of growing up and coming into your own.   Hannah gave me a card once that really says it all:  "Life is not about finding yourself, life is about CREATING yourself."   Amen!

      Still feeling better...YA! I've started being productive again, going out again, and being social again. I just wasn't myself for a whole two months...but now I'm almost back! Watch out world...!!!  Last night I get a call from my Secretary high school. He was asking my thoughts about our 5-year reunion. What! My thoughts...lets not have one. Putting back on my politically correct President face I said, oh how lovely, lets do it! Blah. I know we should I guess I just don't want to revisit all those people from the past. It is easier to just not deal with it, but at the same time who knows, maybe some of my fellow classmates are living in LA and there ya go...instant friends near by. Also networking may not be bad. Either way, it has been five years since I left Mission San Ho (Jose) and it is time to return and reacquaint myself with all those old faces.  We decided on meeting at a bar somewhere in Fremont, like a Dave and Busters type place. That way, people can just show up drink, not drink, and socialize. Something very casual. I'll probably have a sign in book, just to keep track of who came and their current contact information. I wish we could have name tags, I am horrible with names...but I'm sure most would think that is extremely lame-o. We'll see. Props to my Secretary for calling and initiating organizing this...I wouldn't of. Tentative date: end of July beginning of August.

      It's Friday and I'm at work. What's wrong with this picture?  I DONT WORK on Friday. Loved the long weekend, but hate this working on Friday ~ish. Damn have I turned into a spoiled brat. I dread the day I have to start working forty hour weeks again...but then a nice pay raise should come with those extra 11 hours.   That day may be sooner than I thought. So, I've been applying for jobs for the last two weeks. Everything from PR to Writing to Analyst jobs. I've been getting annoyed though bc I haven't been hearing back from people...until today. Today ACNielsen is requesting a phone interview for next week. Exciting bc I like what they do--market analysis--something I've always been interested in. I don't know for which ACN job it is for though, I applied to a couple different ones. All have similar functions but there were all different locations: SF, LA, Glendale, and I think Chicago and Boston. I'd rather not leave LA right now, but I'm also open to new experiences. I've moved once without knowing anyone and it sucked. I don't want to jump the gun...it's just a phone interview. Who knows if they'll want to hire me. Either way, keep your fingers crossed. My friend Debbie has a friend who works for ACN too, so on Monday I'm going to talk with him about what it is like to working for them--good, bad. It also should be helpful for the interview if I truly understand their business and what they look for in candidates.  My friend Debbie and I are going to try and start a little side business. She makes jewelry and every time I wear it I get tons of compliments. This weekend I'm heading to the library to look up how to write a business plan and well as talk with a friend of a friend who has started many of his own companies. We need to understand what steps to take in order to minimize the risk involved, then Debbie and I need to work out a clear vision--that will be next week's task. Exciting though. The older I get the more I want to be my own boss and have my own business. A lot of work, but at least you have control and feel valued!  This weekend I have no set plans and I'm loving it! I always have my weeks and weekends planned out with visits, errands, outings with friends and this weekend I didn't plan a thing! I can't wait to hang out, read, watch some movies, go on a hike or two, cook and just be! Again, I'm becoming a home body...god I feel old.  Lily graduated this Wednesday...Congrats Lil! We headed to CSUN to cheer her on and celebrated for a little bit after at Los Toros in Chatsworth. I'm so proud. She worked so hard and did it! I have totally respect for those with a Bio major...

      Last night was a first...A first of many things.   The first time I have gone to a bar where women take off their clothes, and the first time I was propositioned with money to dance on stage.   This all sounds worse that it really was. Last night Michelle took me Forty Deuce, a bar with cabaret show. The shows are pretty innocent and are more of about acrobatics and seduction. It is the club where Jessica Simpson had Nick's birthday party and where she came out of the cake.   So after the first 'strip show' the DJ started blaring the music once again and the crowd was pumped--all the hormones were now raging! Funny cause before the show people were pretty mellow and then after, damn, guys and girls alike were getting out of control. So of course, some girls jumped up on stage/bar to dance and seduce. They were not sexy at all...But they thought they were so I guess that is what is important. Right? This girl who I didn't know at all and haven't even casually talked to asks me to go up and dance on the bar. I politely said No, bc I didn't want to be a sheep and join the flock of wana-bee performers. She began to beg and beg and try to get guys to drag me up there. After several "Nos" she busted out cash and starts counting off money to get me up there. While it was only 25 bucks, still, I had never been proposition like that. I kept pointing out other people she should take up there and she said, and I quote, "No, I want you." Whoa there chicky...at that point I backed up and she moved on...onto the stage that is.  It was a cool place. No where I'd go back just to go out, but definitely a good place to take "out of towners" or first timers. Best to make reservations so you don't have to stand the whole time...FYI.  Life is good right now. Finally got a little kitchen table so I can stop eating dinner on the floor; had my phone interview which went well; hopefully will get promoted in three months; going home in August for the five year reunion and a tip to Tahoe with Dad and Janice, his girlfriend, for a little vacation.   Rest of the weekend I'll be running errands and researching for my article due the 20th. I'll keep writing for the extra income each month, but once I make more money then I think I'll be more selective on which articles I write, as in the ones that don't involve contacting ten people and coordinating interviews and artwork. Anyway...A day and a half more to enjoy before I'm back at work.

      I was violated last night. Yup, I got a computer virus.  I was downloading Kazaa software off the internet so I could download music--like many of my friends do, and all of a sudden things stopped working. Long story short, when you don't pay and you download the software then it comes with 'spyware'. This way these advertisers can see what web-sites you go to so they can send you junk mail and the sort.  So today a guy at work is helping me rid my computer of this violation. It was weird though, I was so irate. I couldn't sleep very well and just couldn't believe that people spend their time writing programs that mess up strangers' computers. What the hell...get a life! Hopefully by tonight when I run Norton again it will come back clean and my computer will be healthy again. I didn't spend that much money to have some nerd destroy it! Anyway...my advice: be careful while on the Net and while I'm sure you have Norton anti-virus make sure you update it weekly if not daily!  Good news...I have a phone interview scheduled for Thursday with ACNielsen. When I talked this morning with the a guy who works for them, he really revealed what I'd actually be doing and what the growth and career path potential is. I think it is definitely something that would be great for me and ties to what I'm interested in: consumer behavior.   More good news....  In my department one our my co-workers left on maternity leave, and my old boss which was her boss as well, pulled me into her office to tell me that I am her first choice to take her position is she doesn't come back after the baby is born. We both don't think she is coming back afterwards so good news for me! She was 29...now I a 23 yr. old get her position. Ya Man! that rocks...I hope the pay does too. Totally jumping ahead of myself but just forward thinking.  I came to another realization last night. I don't want to leave L.A. I feel like I'm not done yet, like I haven't exhausted my options and my opportunities. I keep randomly applying for jobs all over the country but I need to stop bc if offered one, I don't know if I'd say no and I don't want to leave. Make sense? Anyway, I like it here. I like that there are a million things to do. I like that there are all sorts of people. I like that there are always new places to go. I like the weather...ah, I just like it. Vacations are definitely needed to remember that the rest of the world isn't this 'fast paced' but for now I'm happy here. I'd like to live with friends and maybe more centrally located, not so far east in LA, but besides that I'm good. Today anyway...

      You know when you have those weekends that are busy but then on Monday you have no idea what you did? I felt that way this morning, extremely foggy headed. Last week as ridiculously busy, this week so far is dead. I have a major headache right now so I don't mind the quite cube.   Some of you knew that I was doing the south beach diet for the last two weeks. What promised to be a weight loss of 8 to 13 pounds ended up being 4 pounds in two weeks, in which all of it was regained this weekend when I drank one night, and munched all day one day. Mostly water weight I'm sure, but I've been educating myself to the Nth degree on weight, calories, studies on weight loss and the like. Any questions...I know it all! Doesn't mean I can loose weight successfully ;)   I'm suppose to go run tonight with the LArunning group I belong to, but I'm not going. This headache and I are going to lay in bed and watch Ryan Seacrest until I feel better. Running later maybe...but not after work.   I've been feeling distant lately from my friends. I feel like summer has brought busy times, but strangely I'm getting really used to being alone. I don't necessarily mind it, but I'm used to it. Life is quiet right now.  I called a guy I went on a date with about 2 months ago on Saturday. The French guy who took the notepad from the Ritz. I just had this urge and feeling like I should call him, like I cut things off too soon or something. So I did. He said he was pleased that I called, we chatted, and I said call me later this week if you want to chat or get drinks. We'll see if he calls, not sure how I feel about it if he does, but whatever at least I got that urge out of my system.  I visited my friend Nichole this weekend. She was once a coworker of mine and is having a baby tomorrow! I can't believe it. I've known her since she got pregnant...it is amazing what can happen in such a short amount of time--a human is created. Wow...She's great and so lucky. Her husband is fabulous and her house is gorgeous and she has a new BMW, a rock on her finger and a healthy little girl on the way. I'm pretty sure she isn't going to be working after Stella--the baby--is born so that means possible full time job for me! We'll see. Nichole deserves the fabulous life she has...bc she is pretty freakin' great. another good role model for me. I am blessed with a lot of older really great role models-- JP, Kim, and Nichole. Maybe being 27-29 isn't so bad. ;)  Please pray for those that are struggling right now. Life isn't easy and demands persistence and perseverance.

      What a week! It's been a good one, a little stressful but good. Every night since Tuesday I've been out and about--the way I like to do it. Dinner, then clubbing for Hannah's b-day, then to a bar bc I was feeling 'frisky', then on a date (which was realllly boring), then out last night clubbing, and tonight down to Orange Country for Julie's bday, and tomorrow off to Shavonne's 4th of July BBQ. Gotta love busy weekends!   Last night was particularly funny though. Michelle and I went to dinner at the Hollywood and Highland complex and were suppose to go out with her roommate and friend to some club. Well, they ended up deciding to stay home so after dinner Michelle and I thought we'd just stop by Level 3--a club by the restaurant--just to check it out, have a few drinks and people watch. But, we were only going to go if we didn't have to pay. I had e-mailed the manager on Wed for Hannah's bday and he wrote back that we should come on Friday. So Michelle and I walked up, leftovers from dinner in our hands, and I talked to the door girl and said I had talked to Dave and he told us to come on Friday. She, being the most bubbly and bouncy girl I have ever met, hopped off to find Dave. Great...Dave doesn't know who the hell I am, just some Joe Schmoe who e-mailed him. Anyway, long story short, the girl lets us in before everyone else bc we're now "Dave's friends", we don't pay, and our IDs and bags aren't even checked. After one drink, one of the promoters befriended us while we were waiting outside for 'Dave' came buy and brought us each two more drinks and a shot of some new type of Vodka. We sat, drank and danced. The club wasn't that great, but my point of this long boring story is that it's amazing how people perceive you just by how you look and what you say. If you act like you're important, people think you're important. All you have to do in life is talk to people and opportunity will be knocking at your door. Anyway, we were laughing about it when we left bc we went there knowing no one and left with everyone treating us like royalty bc we supposedly were "Dave's friends"--hey, whatever works!

      I'm back...back from the date with the English man. I sit here in bed thinking, not sleeping so I figure I'll write and reflect on my thoughts. Warning, I've had quite a few drinks. Who knows how honest, rude, or self-deprecating this blog will be but here we go....  I need to start being more selective in accepting offers for dates. I usually figure nice guy, what could be so bad. Dinner, drinks, new experiences...I'll go. Tonight though, I'm reminded of those dates where even with the excellent food and free entertainment, I'd rather be home sitting on my rear watching Blind Date or Access Hollywood than out with some guy. The English man was nice and polite until the third drink, then he started getting a little too frisky at the restaurant. I'm not PDA type of gal when I first meet someone, he came across desperate. The drinks, awesome crab enchiladas, and unforgettable chocolate dessert were the highlight of the evening. I enjoyed the conversations about his Polo days, meeting the king, and all the traveling adventures, but he talked and talked and talked and didn't ask me anything. Uh, typical. I guess he thought he had me figured out. He even had a nice convertible Mercedes, but the rambling ruined it. Gotta love the invites to Cabo, England and the like. He doesn't even know me. What is it with guys who meet you, like the first impression and then want to plan trips with you? I barely even go on trips with my best friends! I don't get it. Too bad I'm not into him, not sure how I'm going to 'blow this off' without feeling really guilty. Oh well right, another experience in the book and another insight into men, how dating works and on what I'm not attracted to.   During dinner the guy from the previous night called twice. I'm a little overwhelmed; he's called four times today. But for some reason I find it endearing that he wants to talk to me that much--or maybe I should be worried that he doesn't have a life. Like I said before I think I'd rather just be friends with this guy then anything else. I just am not attracted to these guys. They're not ugly but not necessarily attractive either- I'm not a freaking' Odonness, but I think I need to raise my standards. "He's nice, don't judge" I think to myself, but being attracted to someone is why I'd want to be more than friends with them.  Anyway, I'm over it. I actually like being along right now. I have things to figure out, things to overcome, and things to accomplish before I'm reading and willing to be 100% revealed, which you need to be in a relationship.  Done venting; now I'm going to try and sleep, wake up in six hours without a head-ache, and deal with the work drama. Definitely glad I went, don't need to go out with that one again. While the English royal polo dreams are tickled, I'm not biting!

      On Friday night I waited in a line wrapped around the block to see Fahrenheit 9/11. Holy cow...what a rude awakening. The movie obviously had a biased opinion, but when supported with facts it is hard to not leave the theater completely appalled by the state of politics in America today. You leave motivated to get involved, unfortunately I feel a little discouraged because I don't like either of the presidential candidates. But if you vote for an independent candidate then we're at risk for Bush winning again. So, we'll see who else if anyone pops up in the election but Bush needs to go, that's for sure. It has motivated me to think about getting involved in public office, i.e. running for something one day, but I'm at loss to understand how that really works and what it involves. Something to keep in mind....   I realized today just how hard it is to be a productive and top-notch employee while doing excellent work and keeping managers happy. I work for two different managers, and on some occasions 3, and find that in busy times it's a little like playing pickle but hey...the challenge is nice and will make me a better business woman--so I can take over the WORLD, HAHAHAHHA. ;) Just kidding....  Last night I broke my hiatus with dating. I went out with a guy I met a Pearl, a West Hollywood club, who was a friend of a friend. He was nice, not as attractive as I remember--must have been the two cosmos and the gin and tonic talking--but very nice and quite the gentleman. Not really a match...a little like pairing Marry Poppins with Ozzie Osborn, but a great funny guy who I'd definitely like to 'kick it with'--no hidden meaning there. Kinda weird, I couldn't really get out of him what he does for a living, i.e. how he supports himself, which makes me a little worried but also a little curious. I'll keep digging ;)  Tonight, I'm going out with some English man I met a week ago at Joya. He's older, 36, but is very charming and wants to, I quote, "dote on me"...so why the hell not go out and have a good time. This should be interesting....he's picking me up at 7 and I have no idea what we're doing. Hopefully he has a plan and doesn't show up saying, "so what do you want to do..." I like men who take charge--except for in bed, that's my job.   Hannah's home! Ya, it is so nice to see her and have her around and able to come out with all the girls. Some drama, but adjustments are underway. It will take some time for everyone to find their fit. Can't wait to have heated discussoins, trip to get frozen yogurt, and nights out on the town!

      I just got back from my second Therapy appointment. Already I'm wondering if I need to be going every week...I think once a month would probably do it. The first session really really helped me, and made me realize a lot of things that will help me understand relationships with different people in my life.  On a happier note, today I found out who was recruiting for the Muppets on their marketing team. I would LOVE to work on the Muppets marketing team, a dream job. So I wrote the recruiter and sent off my resume, we'll see what happens but I'm excited at just the possibility. Keep your fingers crossed for me. I don't even know if they have entry level marketing jobs right now but I'll take anything! Funny bc just this morning I started feeling very anxious about my current career path and started to worry that I will forever not be satisfied if I stay where I am. I want something I'm excited about, something that is fulfilling not just something I can do or that I'm good at.  So tonight I have a date with Rich. An old flame that I ran into at White Lotus last Wednesday--I dated him for like .2 seconds (two weeks or so). I'm pretty apathetic about it, but he does have a BOOODY. He was really sweet and very affectionate when we first started dating. I ended after the two weeks bc 1) I was involved with Korey--Mr. Issues and 2) he made weird faces when we were making whoopie. Weird I know, probably just an excuse to end it, but anyway Rich and I haven't talked since September or so. We'll see how it goes, and no I won't be getting or giving any tonight. ;)  This weekend is up in the air. Not sure what is going on--a lot a little, it all depends. For some reason I'm feeling very apathetic towards the whole thing. Very unlike me...  After work yesterday, a coworker and I went on a hike in Runyun canyon here in Hollywood. It was nice, she is a lot more out of shape than I am so it wasn't too much of a workout for me, but it was good to have her company. If I did that a couple of times a week and ran part of it, damn would I be in good shape!  For now, I am happy that I've been exercising more and trying to eat better. Right now though I just want sweets!!! After work today we're going to El Torito for a friend's birthday so I'm trying to not snack...uh it's hard. Chewing on gum right now...hoping it will keep me for the next two hours!   I'm really into tea lately. Not just any tea, but any teas that are suppose to promote health and well being. I know...don't all teas? Nope, I love Jasmine Green Tea, Jasmine White Tea, and Oolong tea. Any tea with a ton of anti-oxidants is good for me!  Ya know, the whole anti-aging thing comes into effect. I'm so paranoid of getting wrinkly. I'm not blessed with skin that doesn't wrinkle so I'm trying to keep out of the sun, take multi-vitamins, and use good face crèmes to help avoid pre-mature aging. So far so good, but all the crap I eat isn't helping! Oh well, I think the biggest component to premature aging is sun damage. That I can control!   Lately I've been really thinking about how great it would be to live in the middle of Wyoming or Montana. Just helping on a ranch, riding horses, hanging out with people from all different walks of life. Doesn't that sound fabulous! I hope someday I find someone to do that with. It'd be great to work on a ranch or at a bed and breakfast. I'd love to be an entrepreneur too, but don't know what to do or how to. Keeping this in mind though, someday.

      What a busy day yesterday....and a long night.  At lunch, I went and picked up my new glasses. They're cute but liked my other ones better. I always do though, like the old pair better than the new pair. Then worked until 6ish, ran to the apartment to pick up a check, ran to Target, ran home ate dinner, changed and shaved, headed off to White Lotus with friends. It was the ESPY awards last night so Hollywood was crackin', but the White Lotus crowd wasn't that great. It was actually really ghetto, but they played good music. A-1 and Eric Cubichi (sp?) were there--djs. I could care less but my friend dated one of them once or something so she was all worked up about it. Had a good time but am paying for it today seeing that I am sick!   I got a sore throat on Monday, and since it's progressed to a little bit of the sniffles with just a touch of a cough. Nothing bad thank god since I'm heading to Palm Springs this weekend. Michelle and I are getting manicures at the spa and plan to hit the 'town' one night of our two. Just a lot of relaxing, shopping, eating out and pampering ourselves. I need to check on the money situation, I feel like I've been spending a lot lately. I did just get paid--finally!--by B&D for my articles so that helps a lot!  But all of it is going towards the credit card so that sucks a big fat one!   Only 20 more minutes and then I'm home for the weekend!! Yes...I plan on catching a few hours of sleep that I didn't get last night, watching Oprah and then I'm suppose to call Ray to hang out. I'm so indifferent about this guy, but he is so nice and considerate. Talk about persistent, he calls like every day practically. Last night I felt bad though bc he and his boy came to the club around 1 to see me but I didn't have my phone on me so I had no idea they were outside. By the time I called him back he was already home and was kind of pissed of course, but got over it quickly. He then called about 10 minutes later to make sure I got home okay and safely. Nice of him. We'll see but for now just friends and he respects that which is rare to find in men~!  I'm feeling good and a little more content with life. Kinda seems like a period of transition or settling in, but all will settle the way it's suppose to so I'm not going to worry about it.

      My timing seems to be off with everything lately.  From jobs to boys to clubs....something's not in line. Maybe it's the new space probe they sent to Saturn...it's disrupting Saturn's rings and therefore throwing my life out of whack! Just leave the solar system alone already--although I'm the first to be on NASA's web-site to see what new pics the probe is sending back.   Anywho, I found out that the recruiter for the Muppets marketing job is just about to fill the position. Damn it! If he would of written me back when he first got my e-mail then I could of been considered. But no, he assumed from my current title that I was a finance geek and wouldn't want to apply to a marketing job. So, missed that one. He said he let me know if anything else came up so I guess that's good that he has my resume and knows I'm interested.   On Friday, I had lunch with a guy who's place I took at Allergan. He now works for NBC Universal in their home video marketing department. He was really cool and very insightful. Still not sure if brand management is the place for me. Not enough analytics and numbers involved and seems to be more operations and production type stuff. And, in order to shift into that career path, I'd have to start at the bottom doing brainless work. Not that I'm not far from the bottom now, but I feel like I'm gaining some momentum. If I get the promotion in September then I'll stay for another six months or so before I start looking for something that is more fitting. I really am interested in Business Development or in Market research--both of which we have here at Disney. Career, still TBD.... Like Hannah said, "It's not like you have a bad deal now..." Very true and sometimes I need to be more appreciative of my situation bc it's a pretty good deal for now.  Also on Friday, I went to The Apprentice open call at Universal City Walk. Once again my timing was off. After working in the morning, then lunch with the NBC guy, I went home, changed and headed off to the "interviews". They were suppose to be there until 4:30, but after valeting my car and rushing over to the scene, everyone was gone. The Universal info booth lady told me that they left early, at around 12:30, bc they didn't get the turn out the wanted. Great...my ass changed into a suit, redid my makeup, printed out resumes on nice paper, rushed over to Universal City, paid to valet my car, and all for nothing. They are having open casting calls all over the US so maybe I make the trek out to Vegas to go to the tryouts, an excuse to go to Vegas for the weekend. Michelle's never been so maybe we'll make a trip out of it.   On Saturday morning I went on a hike--felt very good--then went to the mall and met Hannah and Lily for dinner at 5:30 or so. After, they both wanted to go home. Hannah's ear is bothering her and Lily said she wanted to sleep and do nothing. (remember this for later...) So I went home. Rich wanted to hang out, but he was at a wedding. He said he could leave the reception at anytime so I met him there. When I talked to him he said he had eaten so that when I got there I'd come in for a minute and then we'd leave. I got there, he hadn't eaten (well he ate an appetizer) so basically he just wanted me to come and be on his arm. I was wearing jeans for Christ's sake! at a wedding! I didn't think we were staying. Anywho, it was a Nigerian wedding at that so I was one of two non-Nigerians in the room. So my inappropriate attire was definitely noticed since I was definitely noticed. Oh well. After two gin and tonics I felt better got over it. I was pissed at him though bc he lied to me about eating and he lied that he'd come with me out afterwards to meet my friends. So I'm over him...now I have to tell him again that it's not going to work out. This time it wasn't timing that was off, it's him! ;)  Yes I understand that this is the longest blog ever, but my boss isn't here today and I have nothing really to do so deal with my blabbering! ;) Ha, just kidding!  So I went to meet friends out at Saddleranch. There are two in Hollywood. One at Universal City Walk and one on Sunset. I thought they were at the Sunset one, so I valeted my car and went in. After talking with Claudia playing the "where are you game" on our cell phones I realized that she was at the Universal City Walk one. Great, just freakin' fabulous. So I paid for valeting my car for all of 10 minutes, and went to U.City Walk. The valet there comped my ticket after a little convincing on my part, thank god, and I met them inside. It sucked, typical Saddleranch. Cheesy music and way over crowded. Then while walking through the crowd, who do I run into? Lily. Yup, she was out and about with Carey, Loreg and friends. The look on her face was priceless, totally shocked and slightly worried. I said, "What happened to sleeping?" She said, "Well, I did and then Carey called me asking what I we were doing so ya...come see us we're over there..." I nodded and walked away with Claudia. At this point we were about to leave and head to White Lotus, bc this place sucked. I wasn't really pissed, but annoyed. If she doesn't want to hang out that 's fine, but don't lie to me about going out. Lame-o! So I went over to say Hi, really to see who was there, and after I told her that I just hung out with Rich for an hour she said, "Ya, that's why I didn't call you, I thought you were hanging out with Rich." Right...excuses. Just like she always makes up when she's late. So I'm over it. I still care for Lily but she needs to stop lying to me and get over the fact that I don't care if she doesn't want to hang out, that's fine, let's be cool about it. It irritates me that I think she doesn't want to hang out bc I don't just go along with what she wants to do. I care if she's late, I want to go to clubs and dance all night, and I don't want to stand in the corner watching. Just two different ways of enjoying nightlife. Not sure how to address it or not address it. But I hope she doesn't think I'm stupid enough to believe all the excuses--I get it: you don't want to hang out.   Sunday was fabulous. I visited my friend Nichole who just had a baby and ah, how adorable is she! I fell in love with her and realized at that moment that someday I will have kids. Not now, and when I meet the right 'bloke' and have the right financial situation then I'll be ready. She's fabulous. Her name is Stella and holding her was such a dream. I felt so bad and evil though, bc she is so pure and so innocent. Here I am, still kinda pure but not really, holding this little baby girl that has been nothing by an angel since she's been here. Ah, how refreshing and truly remarkable. I just want to hold her all day! This is not even my baby, I can't imagine the love and protection you have for your own child. Now I get motherhood just a little bit more...THANKS MOM!  Last night I made a list. A list of all the things I want to be and all the things I am now. As of now, I have half of the list completed and the things I want that I don't have--characteristics that is--are attainable. So, I'm working on myself. I working on myself so that I can become the person I want to be. The timing issues with boys, well what I blame on timing, isn't really timing it is that I just am not ready and happy enough with myself to open up and connect with a guy in a romantic and intimate way. No one right now will be let in, I've closed the gates and have put up a sign "Under Construction". I'm excited about it and know that the only way I'll be happy throughout life and get what I want--the life I want that is--that I'll have to love who I am and what I represent. Then all else will fall into place and I won't feel like the life I want I can't have...it will come.   Lots of ups and downs this weekend, but overall I think I ended up in a good place. I must remain focused and consistent in my thoughts and behaviors and then before long my satisfaction with myself should hit par!

      As most of you know, my biggest ambition in life is to be happy. Part of that is be happy with your career, a big part of that since most individuals spend 40+ hours a week at the office. In an effort to make sure I will eventually be satisfied by my job, I’ve been informally interviewing professionals in different careers. About a month ago I interviewed two people who work in PR for a firm called RLM pr. I wasn’t sure if PR was THE job for me after our conversations, but I definitely thought it was a better fit than what I have now—although these last few weeks haven’t been bad. Long story short, I got an e-mail on Wednesday from one of the ladies I interviewed about a job opening. She wanted me to come in and interview with her bc they’re interested in hiring me for the position. It’s in healthcare, I’d be working on the Allergan account (I worked for Allergan for about a year in college), and have total responsibility over the consumer health care market. Meaning, I’d be pitching to consumer publications while my coworker and manager would be pitching to the trade industry. The interview went very well, I still don’t know how much it would pay, but I have until Tuesday to let them know if I’m interested. This is soooo complicated. I still need to talk with my old manager at work to see if that promotion is waiting for me or if it is just a chance I’d get it not set in stone that it’d be mine. I also have to find out what I’d get paid at this new place bc eventually I’d have to move to West LA or Santa Monica area. (they’re off Wilshire west of the 405) Then I have to do some sole searching to see if this is the right opportunity for me. It’s a good opportunity but is it the right one. Sometimes not every opportunity is a good one or the best one. Who knows….but for now I have to do some more digging within myself and within the opportunities in PR to see if I’m interested. Good news is that I’d get to go on business trips. The first in October to New Orleans, the second to one in Hawaii, another in DC, and another in Florida. Since we have our main office in NY I’d get to go there often as well. Who knows…..they want someone who wants to stay a while and who wants to grow within the company. I guess by Tuesday I better have my mind made up if I’m even interested…great.

      Now for the weekend update:   On Wednesday Kim and George stayed over before they headed to Austrailia for a sixteen day trip. How fabulous! It was really good to see them. They such great people and so full of life. They are the real thing, no hidden agendas or feelings of having to put on a front. I'm jealous that they are off to an exotic location but more so that they have one another to travel with. My best traveling buddy is hannah, but no offense to her, I don't want to jump in bed with her and be all romantic. A definite qualification for my next honey is that he likes to travel.   One of my manager's at work is driving me crazy...still. I just am not going to get used to him. He drives me nuts. Whatever, hopefully soon I won't have to work with him. He's not bad, but he just pushed my button's in all the wrong ways. I'm just going to have to suck it up and play nice. Boo.  Friday was uneventful--see previous blog posted for the evenings events. Didn't go out. Thursday however, Hannah, Shavonne and I went out to a club called Que's in Pasadena. Lame! The music was good but once again the people, crowd, wasn't good at all. There really is no place like LA to find the oh-so-entertaining poser crowd at most night clubs. Hannah and I had lunch on Friday afternoon which was nice. I was on my way back from seeing&nbsp;a house my friend and I might buy, which I'm not going to but she is, so I stopped in Chatsworth. We always have good conversations, always enjoyable. Saturday I went on a hike in the&nbsp; morning and then took a nap and got ready to head to the OC. We went to Michell's friend Brie's birhtday party. It was nice. She had sandwiches waiting and lots of alcohol. Drank a lot. We then headed to a new OC club called Vegas. It was cool, but the crowd wasn't too great and the music went from trance to techno to hip hop--they needed to pick one genre and stick to it! Headed home that night short one girl, Michelle--she was getting reacquainted with an old friend...Wink wink. Heeey! Today was good. Had really strange dreams last night, none of which I can remember, slept in until noon, and then paid bills, painted my nails, talked on the phone, read, napped, and then off to a movie and dinner with Michelle. We saw, Napoleon Dynamite. It was sooooo good. Absolutely hilarious. I haven't laughed that hard during a movie in a&nbsp;really long time. I recommend everyone to go see it and to stay after the credits bc there's an extra scene after. Uh, totally worth the eight dollars and very entertaining.   When I got home, I had dessert of course--remember who you're dealing with here--and got ready for the week. At some point on Sunday I always vacuum, tidy up, and prepare salads for the week ahead. I used to cook meat too but not today, I'll have to do that tomorrow. I'm looking forward to the following weeks. There are things to do everyweekend until the end of August. I can't believe it is almost August!!! Time flies...more reason to not put things off bc before you know it youth will be gone--ah, can't think about that how depressing.   I was telling Hannah how I feel like I've experienced LA. If I had to leave tomorrow, I really feel like I got a good sense of all it has to offer. I still have quite a few places to go, but I have been many many places, those well known and those not so well known. Now I will work on myself and work on my life. Thank god for the opportunity to live here though and experience this world reknowned place--ther really is not where on earth like it. LA is for sure a little ridiculous sometimes, and the fast pace is enough to drive you crazy not to mention how expensive it is, but it's fun, it's exciting, and most of all anything you want is available everynight and just a stone's throw away. Gotta love that.   Those are my thoughts tonight before I turn in. I'm going to read a little more of a book I picked up on Super Foods Rx. I think I naturally have a healthy palate, now if I could just stop eating sweats and snack foods I'd be home free!   Goodnight!   Quote of the day from a book called "Why Men Love Bitches"...don't ask...   "Before sex, a man isn't thinking clearly and a woman is thinking clearly. After sex, in reverse. The man is thinking clearly and the woman isn't."   Oh so true...! You gotta love that men just pour their hearts out after sex while you lay there in a daze--hopefully if&nbsp; he did a good job! :)

      Friday night was uneventful--when I have too much time on my hands and I start sitting around thinking things can get scary. This is a list of things I just came up with--unedited--while sitting in bed. A look into who I am and what I beleive. Kinda scary to share with everyone bc this is me in a nutshell, but since I'm moving into this new era of being confident with who I am, I should be confident in what I think too and I am. So enjoy, maybe learn something new about this nutty one, maybe not.   I believe that being kind and considerate to every person on earth is important I believe taking care of the earth and of ALL of it’s creatures is important I believe that people are what makes life worth while, not things.  I believe that true happiness comes from being content with who you represent and how you effect the rest of the world.  I believe that eating is a good thing and that an appetite is healthy. I believe that dancing is a way to express yourself and a way to interact with strangers safely and intimately.  I believe that I am smart, special and interesting. I believe in a higher power and in guardian angels. I believe that our family on the otherside looks down on us and watches over us. I believe that with each year that passes I become infinitely wiser and that I can’t wait to be older so that I can understand that much more who I am and what life is about.  I believe that fear will limit what great things each person could be. I believe in unconditional love. I believe in a woman’s right to choose. I believe that men are hot when they take care of themselves and are physically active. I believe women are beautiful and unbelievealby complex creatures of which all mankind is depent on. I believe in equal rights for all—race, religion, sexual orientation, age, disabilities, and appearance. I believe that people are born good and that life and the challenges it presents can take a pure soul and turn it rancid. Love heals all wounds and protects our spirits from distruction. I believe in a challenge and in competition. I support the arts.  I support the exploration of space and of our world. I support those fighting to erase discrimination of every type. I support those I love. I support myself—almost.  I support a good education for everyone. I believe in luck and being in the right place at the right time. I believe in listening to your soul and heart bc they know the right decision. I believe that getting “There” will happen for me bc I work at figuring out where “there” is every day. I believe that money is not satisfying. I believe that a life of luxury is enjoyable and desirable. I believe that without love and people life isn’t worth living. I believe that love makes everything okay. I believe in exploration of all kinds.  Now wasn't that fun? NOt! Anyway, I encourage everyone to do this. Just to sit down and start typing. You'll be suprised at what pops up on the screen. Just think of everything you are sure of, everything you believe to be true. Maybe it will challenge you to think about what you believe, maybe not, maybe it will increase your confidence in what you believe. This was interesting, hope you found it to be as well.

      It's been a good Sunday; Enlightening, productive, and relaxing. Last night was cool. I went to a friend's surprise party where I didn't know anyone but the guest of honor and his girlfriend. Kinda weird being there and not knowing anyone, but I sucked it up and was 'social' bc I wanted to be there for the one friend I knew. They had some really nice friends there and some very interesting ones. This one guy had rented a car one summer and drove from LA to the Arctic circle. Yup, just for kicks. Just to go and experience it. I was impressed, the guy follows his dreams and ambitions even if they sound nuts. I have so many thoughts and dreams but don't allow them to materialize.  I've been watching two PBS shows this afternoon, which is why I'm in this mood of "finding purpose" I guess. The one thing that I've really taken from the shows is the fact that all the energies around you really do affect how you act, feel, and succeed in life. If the energy around you is negative, you tend to 'go with the flow' and get sucked into the negative energy. I've know for a while know that LA isn't a healthy place to live and that someday I'll have to move on and live in an environment that is more conducive to a life where people respect the environment, connect with eachother on a spiritual level, and know that there is a whole lot more that money and fame to life. It is so easy to get sucked into the trap of wanting the best car, highest paying job, newest cloths...but really all of it doesn't matter and in the end that isn't what brings you happiness. I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir a little bit here, but just thinking out load.  On a funnier note, I swore that with one big gust of wind or a minor earthquake this whole apartment complex is going to crumble to the ground. It is constantly shaking--what feels like mini earthquakes all the time. When I first moved here I would freak out and practically duck and cover every time there was a little shake. I still don't know what it is from, maybe I have some obese neighbor or something that shakes the whole building. I keep thinking that under the near by mountains there's a freakin' volcano ready to erupt. Totally not going to happen I know, but damn this place better be retro-fitted!  Heard a good quote today so thought I'd share it. It's a little scary and place a big personal responsibility on each of us make sure we 'take care of business'. Hope it hits home for you like it did for me....  "Don't die with the your music still inside you."  Get out there and shine. Whoever you are, be that person. Whatever you want to do, do it. Easier said than done, trust me I'm no example--but someone do it so we can all get inspired already! ;)

      What a week….what a weekend! Bad, good, boring and invigorating, this last week has encompassed it all.  Just to give you a visual, I’m sitting in the passenger seat of my car, door open legs hanging out with my laptop on my lap. (ahh, how appropriate) in a parking garage in San Diego. Random….not really. I’m meeting Kim and a few of her friends at the Civic Center in SD to see the play Thoroughly Modern Mille for a belated birthday for Kim. (she’s been vacationing in Australia for the last two weeks)  I can’t wait to see her and hear about the trip—I’m living vicariously through her—and to see the play. I’ve heard it’s so good. So I’m facing out of my car and I can see a whole bunch of SD buildings and churches etc…and the security guard of the pking garage came over to inquire what I was doing just incase I’m planning on blowing something up. ;) Right…I guess I kinda look suspicious, but once he saw me and chatted with me I think he knew I was just some weirdo that paid to park in a parking garage and type on her laptop while slouching in her car.  Anyway….back to my week recap of the bad, good, boring and invigorating…  The Bad: On Tuesday I talked with direct manager about my issues with my project manager. I had been told that some e-mail was send around by my PMgr that I was missing deadlines. I have never missed a deadline since I’ve been at Disney and so understandably I was pissed. So I told my DMgr my feelings on the issue, how I’ve never been given a project timeline or due dates for half of the things I was working on and so therefore I wasn’t aware of my PMgr expectations. In the end, she understood, agreed with me, told me I need to ‘manage up’ bc he is incapable of being organized etc… She then pulled him in her office to again ask for proof that I was not meeting deadlines—she had asked for it twice before and he never gave it to her. He then was even more pissed at me for going outside him to tell someone else that he is difficult to work with. In the end we ended up ‘discussing’, more like arguing, from 4 to 8 pm!!! Ah, it was aweful. I loath him. He is one of those, “Nothings ever my fault, I use people as scapegoats.” Well he picked the wrong one, bc I will not stand for it and will not take it. I am not a ‘yes-man’ that’s for sure!  We’ll see how the next week or so goes, but in Sept I’ll find out about the promotion and if I don’t get one then I’m out of there bc I can’t work with him.  The Good: I chatted with Belle on the phone and I’m so happy for her. She has found the “One”—scary I know. She is so happy with Mateo, they plan to get married within the next year or two and are moving in together next year. He is a great guy…she only deserves the best, really she does, so ya for her. I’m glad life decided to be nice. ;)  I got to hang out with Jules this weekend too! I worked the Princess Diaries 2 premiere at Disneyland and gave Jules the heads-up to come out and see some of the stars. So while I was helping some attendees find their seats and then later, dressing their kids up in wedding gowns—don’t ask—Jules was hanging out in Calif. Adventure star watching. The theater I was ushering was the best bc it had all the stars. Lets see who was there…Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown, Holly Robinson-Pete, Raven, a whole bunch of actors in the movie that I don’t know the names of, the mom from “Greek Wedding”, Gary Marshall, Anne Hathaway, and to top it all off…..Julie Andrews! While it was cool to see and talk to some of these people, it was very anticlimactic. I thought I’d at least be excited or nervous, and actually I didn’t care one bit. I think it reaffirmed the fact that I am done with the whole LA, southern Cali thing. It has been a blast and quite a way to spend my college years as well as the first two years out of school, but I want to move to a more beautiful place, with lots of trees, rivers, mountains, and a quieter softer side of life.  The boring: I’ve driven all over Southern Cali this weekend! From LA to San Diego and back. All worth it of course but my ass hurts already!  The invigorating: On Friday I went sailing with JP, my hold boss, and Tom, her husband. They belong to some yacht club in Newport and just bought a sail boat and on Thursdays and Fridays they race in the harbor against other boats. It was soooooo much fun. I never knew how hard it was and how much skill it takes to know how to maneuver a sail boat. It was exhilarating. Now of course, I’m pissed that while at UCI I didn’t join the sailing team. They were recruiting like mad when I was a sophomore through my senior year. So I’ve found something else that I like to do, something I want to become a hobby and hopefully I can find a team that needs an extra crew member. Anyway we got second place, and a etched mug to keep, and dinner. Lots of fun, but we were the youngest people there by about 20 years.  At a work offsite on Wednesday they hired a Tarot card reader to read everyones fortunes. I was one of the last people to go but it was worth the wait. She said that in a past life I was a spiritual master, that I’m on the same path as her (great I’ll be an overweight crazy tarot card reader….) and that I won’t marry young but I’ll marry right. Ah, lots of fun stuff to know, but damn I wish I knew the specificis. What the hell is a spiritual master—as you can tell I think I left that side of me on the “other side” bc I’m clueless when it comes to my spirituality—and what is young? Does she mean around 30 I’ll run into Mr. Right, or does she mean like 50? I guess we’ll just have to wait and see. She also said that I always have the philosophical side of me and the rational analytical side of me pulling at one another. To get satisfaction with life she said that I need to keep both in balance and never let one take over the other. She is sooooo right. I call it the logical vs dreamer side of me, but it’s true. I go from wanting to live a life full of passion vs living a life full of responsibility and corporate success. Gosh when I write it down, it seems obvious to choose the life of passion, but when you’re broke life isn’t fun either. We’ll see.  What a week. This next weekend will be that much more interesting bc I’m up North to go to my HS 5 year reunion. I just love how I’ve put on another 5 pounds since we chose a date, shouldn’t I be dieting….? You’d think hu.  It’s 12:28, time to go meet Kim and gang in front of the theater…Peace and Love!
