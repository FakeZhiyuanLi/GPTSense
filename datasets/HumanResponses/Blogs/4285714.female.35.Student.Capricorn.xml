						   Howdy guys, gals, lurkers and those who just pass through.................  Let's just say.........if he's cheating,  he really sucks at covering his tracks and he should be a pro at that after his former marriage. C came in from work today.....did you  hear  what I said? He came  in  after work today and emptied his pants pockets on the bathroom counter and there sits a piece of paper with "her" full name, address AND home telephone # on it? All I can say to that is hmmm.....! So for right this moment I am going to push that thought (cheating) to the side and when we are on  a first name basis again I will tell him of my suspicions. It's kinda hard to talk to him when  we aren't talking ...lol.  It really BITES big time that everything I see reminds me of or makes me think about sex! Maybe my hormones are a little TOO good considering the state of  my relationship at the moment. ( now is when I need to go hunting for some of those little smiley faces you can use in your blog).  So I'm at the courthouse today dropping off some paperwork that I pulled out of my ass by the way. Like  I know  how to write a response to a civil summons without a lwayer....RIGHT!! But that's what I did AND I turned it in. Nope, no DUI or manslaughter charges.... just a hearing with the ex about child support issues. anway...back on track..................  There's a girl there, couldn't be more than 15-16, she's with her MOM and she's wearing a lowrise pair of jeans with a thong that goes halfway up her back, if THAT doesn't SCREAM "see my thong" I don't know what does. What the hell is up with kids these days and whats up with wanting everyone to see their underwear?? We ALL have them and most of us don't want to see yours. I'd kill my daughters for dressing like that and the bad part is this is juvenile court and it looks as though she's getting ready to go stand in front of the judge. What the hell is MOM thinking??? Geez loueeze!  So anyway.....a good day for the most part. My papers are filed, my husband is actually   in  the house and he even went to the store AND before he left he asked if I needed anything. Progress. Progress.  So tomorrows a new day......I have tons of stuff to get done AND...get this!! My income tax return came in today so now I can pay for those classes without the guilt of using his credit card to do it and I can even buy the books.  A few comments on the comments.............. Have I already said that I appreciate the input? :o)  Geez, it sounds really bad when you say "I shouldn't kid about a divorce". I really wasn't kidding about it, if things didn't look up in our relationship I  was going to pay a visit to my lawyer. Just mentioning that the thought had crossed my mind was taken as a threat by C, and a threat he felt he needed to act on. I think maybe I DID mean it as a threat and jsut didn't realize what his reaction to that would be. Bad me. I totally see where you are coming from in what you say (man it's GREAT!!! to get a man's persective on this crap). I know I said I was bluffing about the divorce...and I was! (and I realize now from what you are saying that it was a bad idea) my intentions though were to toss the idea around with him and see what his reaction would be to it. Guess I know now.  I made a few calls today about a part-time job., but first things first (I've been putting this off way too long now) I've got to get enrolled in classes so I can give them my school schedule to work around. I'll let y'all know what comes of that.  Chatted long enough for one sitting as usual, I think I may need to hide part of my posts so they don't take up so much room. Looking forward to any and all comments.   Check ya later....Dawn

						   In response to the questions in the comment section........(and thanks for the input and making me look at other options and making me think outside of the box, all appreciated)  Why did C change his mind and stop the divorce.................After getting to Iraq and missing me I guess???.........(we only talked after he had been gone almost 3 months ) he had a case of the "you don't know what you have until you think you're gonna lose it" scenario......(yeah I ad-libbed for my own purposes but what the hell........) He said the only reason that he filed for divorce before he left is because I had mentioned doing it myself and he felt like he needed to in order to protect himself but he didn't actually want a divorce. In fact he was very adament via phone calls and e-mails to his lawyer that it be dropped immediately once he found out that I was just bluffing. Yeah, bad me....I know! I never claimed total innocence in this relationship, I only claimed to not know WHAT I actually did this time.  I don't have a hard time believing that my sister may have actually been the one who made the move on C and is just trying cover her tracks (by putting the blame on him) in case he has told me about it. That could also be why she hasn't called me since she went back home...all of the phone calls between us since then have been instigated by me.  I don't think that she would have said anything bad about me to C that would have pissed him off at me because #1: what the hell would she say? (maybe I am more naive than I realize) and #2 I don't think he would believe her anyway........he knows me. (or so I thought)  I  have  asked him what is bothering him and why he is mad at me in e-mails and in person, with the e-mails I get no response at all and in person as I said...he won't even look me in the eye, he just rolls his eyes and pisses me off which makes matters worse. Not sure how many ways there are to get a man to talk but either of the above would have worked for me.  As for the being self sufficent comment..............and don't think I've taken offense....I haven't at all! BUT..........oooh...there's the big BUT........... I have always played a major contribuitory factor in this marriage. In fact, he lived with ME when we first got together and I paid ALL the bills. Then after we married I worked full time as a dental assiastant bringing home $520.00 a week (not a whole lot but still a contribution) and also put child support ($1000) into our mutual funds. Even after my surgeries I was receiving unemployment almost equal to my pay, and I received that for almost a year. Our money was always combined so his numerous lawyer fees to go back to court with his ex-wife and paying off his uncle sam debt from his prior marriage was also paid in part with my money, I don't think it's so much to ask that he hold down the fort in my time of need after having had 3 major surgeries. I also don't think that it's too much to ask that he help pay my college expenses seeing as we will both benefit from the outcome. Which if you will remember was the plan after we purchased a home.  Our money only started being in individual accounts after he filed for divorce last year and it just seemed more convenient that way so we left it. I can't actually say that he cut me off from the checking account because I wasn't on it to begin with but...........I did have a credit card to his checking account at my disposal until it all of a sudden disappeared which he denies any part in. I say he has "cut me off" because prior to his not speaking to me he always made sure that I had money required for expenses and etc. Then last week I log into his bank account as I have always done and he has changed his passwords so that I am not able to get into his account anymore. Seems pretty fishy to me when combined with the rest of the circumstances.  He came in again this eveing around 7 pm and the same thing......stood at his truck drinking. It will only be a matter of time, I'm sure, until someone in the Homeowners association has something to say about this.  Again........not a single word spoken between the two of us. Maybe I am being hard headed here but I have tried on numerous ocassions to get him to talk to me but I am NOT going to beg. Sorry! Just not going to do it and that's just how it is.  Well..........once again, a long rambling post but I feel better each time I get on here and rant so maybe the blog was a good idea...it may save my sanity!! :o)  Ta for now....Dawn

						   I tend to always see the worst in every situation. I guess I do it so that when reality hits and it's not the absolute bottom line worse that it could have been, then I was at least prepared.  Who knows??.....maybe I am seeing far more into this problem than what is really there, maybe I am letting the little things turn into big things. Maybe I am letting my imagination get the best of me.  I'm not so sure anymore that"C" is cheating on me but at this point that's not really even important (not so much) what IS important is that I have so little trust and faith in him that I can take it to the bottom so quickly and convince myself that it's true. I  (or anyone for that matter) should have more trust in the person that they are married or commited to and it's just not there for me as far as "C" is concerned. Yep! I married "C" knowing that he had cheated on his former wife, why did I think I would be any different? I convinced myself that I was different , that he and I were soul mates and he wouldn't do that to me. Also because he felt so badly and guilty for doing his ex-wife the way that he did that he told me he couldn't even look at himself in the mirror, and that all he wanted out of life was to be happy with the person looking back at him in the mirror, he wanted to cahnge, he didn't want to be that person anymore and I believed him.  I'm growing tired really quick of how things are going in my and "C's relationship. That combined with the recent revelation of what my sister says happened while she was here, I guess I am just getting a "I don't give a shit attitude" about the future of my relationship with "C". I know that is awful an I do strongly believe in the sancity of marriage and the belief that ALL should be done to salvage a marriage but I also believe that you only get one cahnce to live your life and you don't get to do it again and you should, as well as the people around you,  at the very least....be HAPPY. Which I'm not obviously and obviously neither is "C". So why spend years or months trying to fix something that may not be fixable.  We have been growing apart for quite some time now and I don't see that changing and even if it did......how long would it last?  I felt this way during my last marriage just before we divorced and I'm starting to feel it now.  Sometimes things that have been lost in a relationship just CAN"T be found again and I really can't invision myself ever being quite the same with "C" again as it used to be. I think that at some point there is just too much that has come between you and some things you just can't get back. I wish that weren't rue but it is.  I have seen what I beleive is the real "C', the filing  for divorce behind my back on Valentine's Day before he went to Iraq and now the not speaking to me and cutting me off from his bank account, not that money is a big deal to me but the fact that he would knowingly deny my children and myself of basic ammenities shows me the kind of person that he really is and it's not something I don't think I can ever push into the back of my conscious and pretend  never happened.  "C" returned home at about 8ish last night an it was the same ole song and dance, still not speaking to me and hung out on the back of his truck drinking beer all night. I finally walked out there and asked him personally to go to the store for me (the money is all his you know and I don't have ANY). He couldn't or wouldn't even look me in the face much less in the eye. I have no clue what I have done but it must have been pretty bad. All he said was pretty much "okay" and babbled something about not having any money but he did eventually go to the store and get what I asked him to then he did his norm which was to come inside and have a few bites of whatever I had made for dinner and go into the bedroom and shut the door behind him without saying a word to anyone.  The really bad part is that I still care enough about him that I'd rather divorce him and see him happy for a change, I don't like this "C", I don't know this "C" and I don't love this "C".  more later..............................I've had enough for now  Dawn

						   So "C" comes home at a decent hour yesterday, say 6ish, (SHOCK!!!) so I think that maybe he wants to talk but I am next door at the neighbors house when he gets here and I think that pissed him off because he doesn't know exactly where I'm at, so he changes his mind about us talking and chooses instead to stand, YEP! stand, in the front yard all night, leaning over his truck and drinking as many beers as he can possibly down in one sitting. Nope, he still hasn't spoke a single word to me and actually I'm quite tired of this stupid little game that he's playing. While still young......I'm too damn old for this shit!  Later in the evening, after a few hours of his standing at the truck drinking multiple beers I ask my daughter to go out and ask him to go to the store for me. (remember he is keeper of the money now as he has cut me off from the bank account, or have I not mentioned that part yet? ) He says, "okay" but then gets in his truck, starts it up and SITS there and falls asleep until almost 12:30 a.m and then comes in and goes to bed. WTH??  Shockingly or NOT shockingly he has to go to work this morning, he doesn't work weekends. hmmmmmm? I'm NOT wasting my time calling to see if he is there, screw that!  I'm trying to keep my spirits up and not let him get to me, and I think I'm doing a pretty good job of it right now (or not, who the hell knows) but Damn this is absolutely ridiculous!!  To make matters worse..and I really hate talking badly about my sister, but I kind of have to in order for you to get the whole picture. I love my sister, she is 2 years older than me and has lived in Wisconsin for the last 16 years or so but she has always been very competitive when it comes to me and my "men". Ever since we were in High school, if I had a boyfriend then SHE  always  took a liking to him and wanted him for herself and usually once I and that boyfriend broke up she was quick on his heels and the guys seemed to think it was a great way to get back at me or make me jealous or whatever! Typical male attitude. In fact..........when I broke up with  a boyfriend named "Richard", she was all over him and even moved in with him but she ended up marrying and moving to Wisconsin with HIS roomamte! Great values huh? Even when I married "C", my sister came in town and while I was gone on my honeymoon and she was staying in my home, driving my car and keeping my children and hers, she spent ALL of her time in town with my EX husband, hanging out with him, going out to eat with him, talking to him about why our marriage failed and the fact that he wanted me back and was inconsolable because I had just got remarried and "god only knows what else they did" etc, etc,  etc.......So I have always been leary of her intentions, and I do tend to keep my guard up when it comes to her because of our past. My motto has always been "if you CAN take my man.....you can HAVE him". (because if he's takable , then I don't want him anyway. Kinda cold I know but it works for me.  Okay so I'm getting off track here.. My sister came down in July of this year after "C" came home and all I heard from her the whole time she was here is how great "C" is and how lucky I am to have this wonderful guy AND what a great body he has. She doesn't know the whole story. Not that I don't agree that he is a great guy at times (even most of the time until now) but there is another side to him as well that she has no clue about.  So....I called my sister yesterday because I have only heard from her once or twice since her visit a month and a half ago and that is unusual, we usually speak 3-4 times a week at the very least. We talked for a few minutes and she told me she hasn't talked to me because she has felt "uncomfortable", of course I ask "about what" and she tells me that "C" came on to her while she was here and didn't know whether she should tell me or not. WHAT???? What kind of sister are you anyway? I would tell her IMMEDIATELY if her hubby came on to me or I even  thought  that he had. She said "C" came into where she was sleeping on the morning that she was to leave (on his way out to work) to say goodbye and gave her a hug and was, in her words "extremely friendly". I asked her if there was any way that she could have misconstrued his behavior and she said "absolutely not". SO now I am thinking "is this her vivid imagination getting away with her because of her long time jealousy with me and my "men" (Hey! I HATE it for her that I am better looking than her and was always the first choice with the guys...a little ego there huh?) or is she trying to make me believe that "she won" this time because my guy came on to her?.... OR did "C" actually make a move on her while she was here?.....I just don't know and this was the last thing that I needed to hear right now. SO now I am PISSED, actually beyond pissed and could care less if "C" ever talks to me again. So torn between loved ones.  Anonymous, I think you are right when you say it seems that I am feeling better because I am able to vent some toxic frustration here cause I certainly haven't discusssed this with anyone else and it is eating me up inside and I DO feel much better after I get on here and rant about it awhile.  I woke up "this morning" and totally freaked out because my clock said 3 PM!!! I know I have been stressing and not gettting enough sleep but I haven't slept that late since I was a teenager AND I have a 12 year old in the house who doesn't need to or deserve to be alone all day. Thank GOD  what had happened is that the power had went out at some point in the night and it was only 10 am. Whoo!  I'm really letting all of this get to me too much. I tell myself that it's normal to be feeling these mixed emotions but I still don't like this shit!  Okay...now I am just babbling about nothing really, I need to get off of here for now. I look forward to any responses or even beatings about the head and shoulders from y'all. I could really use some input. Am I over reacting or do I have good reason to be feeling what I am feeling. Am I allowing this to get out of hand or do I really have no control, which is how I feel. Actually I feel trapped because of my non-working idiot self and not having the immediate ability to get the hell out of dodge. I NEED to finish my degree if I want to provide comfortably for my children and myself and not struggle from paycheck to paycheck. And why the HELL should I lose MY home when he is the one who is doing this shit?  What I really want to do is just take off completely, go somehwere, anywhere just to get away for awhile. My oldest daughter keeps her weekends pretty well planned with work and studying and her boyfriend and I don't have to keep her under my thumb at all times but my 12 year old needs her mom. Next weekend she is supposed to go to her dad's for the weekend so I am thinking seriously about just packing a bag and making a road trip......somewhere, not sure where quit yet but just getting away, maybe having a sleepover with a girlfriend or something without telling "C" what I am doing and let him worry about me and what I am doing for a change, make him think that I am the one having an affair, I'm actually even thinking about hitting a few bars, like he has been doing, I don't have a problem turning heads. I'm not sure that he would really care though at this point and then I wonder to myself if I am just acting as immature as him by having these thoughts.  Oh well........................it's a beautiful day and there are things to do and people to see.....not really but it sounds good right? I'm off to find something to do with this day.  By the way....I'm STILL.....HORNY  and  LONELY and Oh yeah! I'm still married too and it still sucks!! :o) I just want all of this to come to an end...some way....somehow! And NO!!! I'm NOT at all suicidal so don't let that cross your mind, I have too much to live for.   If you made it this far.....Thanks for listening! :o) Dawn

						   Damn! Not sure what happened to that post, maybe it will show up twice!!  Anyway......it's late and I am, as usual, awake. Am I the only one up at this hour??  I found this while surfing, can't remember where though. Check it out, it's really cool. You have to answer a couple of simple preliminary questions but you don't have to join anything and it's pretty awesome.  http://www.20q.net/index.html  Again I appreciate the comments and will post some more tomorrow on the situation and odd ramblings from my recently feeble and confused mind.  Especially to : Anonymous who has been most helpful, I'd really like to know how to contact you for general conversation or is that not allowed in the blog world? :o) I checked out the site you directed me to yesterday and I am learning alot from there, I appreciate the advice!! :o)  Dawn

						   Well another day and things look no better.  I  really  appreciate those of you who left comments. It's really nice to have someone who understands and wants to strangle my hubby besides me. I am definitely going to check out the website that was suggested.  As for right out asking him if he's cheating....I know that won't work because I have no doubt that if asked he will say" no" whether he is cheating or not.  I'd like to think that he is not cheating but all the signs say that he is. Most of my suspicions are based on me being sneaky. I checked his cellphone while he was asleep and there was incoming and outgoing calls to the same number, many of them,  so being the nosy soul that I am, I called the number and got a voice mail for someone named Sabrina. That's the moment I decided that he was definitely cheating. He is supervisor of a large corporation and I know he talks to many people on that phone for business but this number stood out because there were so many of them. Now for the last week he's been coming home late every evening, he says there's a "boiler" down at work but if I try to contact him at work I can't get him, that coupled with the fact that he's not speaking to me confirms it in my mind.  Geez loueeeze......I didn't start this blog as a means to whine and I don't want it to turn into that. I'm actually a strong person and I can make it on my own but it's not the making it on my own that's breaking my heart, it's the losing my husband. We have no common children, my daughters are 12 and 18 (yep! I started young ) , he is 8 years older than me and I was sure hoping that would mean that he would be more mature than the guys my age.............guess not! But he is very close to my kids and I don't want to shake up their world either with a divorce. He has kids of his own from a prior marriage, 23, 21 and 19 and we all get along wonderfully.  When we started dating, I was a full-time student working towards my AS in nursing. After we married I quit school to work (( I am a CDA (Certified Dental Assistant)  so that we could save up money to buy a house of our own, which we did 4 years ago. I haven't worked for the 2 years since I had all my surgeries and now I am ready to go back and finish my degree, I have half of the credits required to finish but alas now we  "don't have the money"  which I think is a load of BS, we have the money for everything else. So now I am thinking" I put my educatin on hold to get a home that will either go to him or be sold in the divorce (there's that overactive-imagination thing again) and I'm going to have to figure out how to raise my daughters on$13.00 an hour" which isn't gonna happen.  Soooo.............my plans are to go to the college on Monday and sign up for at least 2 classes and get a short term loan and then come the first of the month use his credit card to pay off the balance so I can get on with my life.  I'm not a sit back and sulk  kinda girl, I'm an "okay, if this is how you want it then let's rumble" kinda girl. I'm still young (35) and attractive and have many years ahead of me to continue down this path we call life. I won't sit around and be put upon, if he's moving on then so am I.  So anyway.......Thanks for listening :o) and thanks again for the input. I agree with the passive agressive mentality of what he's doing and it sucks! Grow up already! I also agree that "men suck". I'm off to check out that website.  On a lighter note...my favorite time of year is here again. My daughter is a varsity cheerleader for her high shcool (as well as a senior this year) and next friday is our first footabll game. Go gators!!  I'm still trying to figure out how in the hell to put a list of other blogs on the left side of the screen, I've emailed blogger for help but no answer yet!!  Ta for now and live life to it's fullest!!!    Dawn

						   HELLO blog world. Well.........I've been reading some blogs here lately and tonight I thought...."hmmmm, this is cool and may be a cool way for me to start venting the many things running through my feeble brain"  which by the way......can be strange and a little outlandish at times.  I guess the best way to start is with how I am feeling today! To sum it up in two swift words..HORNY and LONELY. Which probably wouldn't be so bad BUT I AM MARRIED. WTF????  Short background info:  Divorced in 1996.......remarried in 1998 to the man of my dreams............I still feel that way about him in my heart but we are going through alot right now and I am absolutely unsure about the stability of our marriage. As a matter of fact (and this is where I got my blog name from) I  think  he is cheating on me.  Now  that  sucks!! Do I have any proof you ask?? Nope, not an ounce of real  proof , just a woman's intuition and some weird happenings lately(that I'll get into in another post) , not to metnion the fact that he is totally not talking to me at ALL right now for reasons I don't even know. WTF??  I've been reading "suburban sex blog" ( which is great by the way) and reading from a man's point of view I can see how I may have made my hubby, whom we'll call "C", feel this way many times in the past. Not that this is a good enough excuse for "C" (even though  I   think    it is, but who the hell am I??) I had surgery in 2002, a hsyterectomy and then 2 surgeries very closely afterward and my sex drive plumeted and my weight went up (going down dramatically now thank God!!) but this put a heavy toll on my marriage, both aspects, and made me start to question whether he had actually married me because I was HOT as hell and always ready to have good sex  (only with him by the way) or if he married me with the thoughts of (hold your breath) "I love this woman and will stay with her through good and bad, thick and thin".....gasp! Imagine!!!! Does anyone do THAT anymore??? I thought I used to know the answer to this question, but the last 2 years have made me question his motives and now his real feelings for me.  So anyway....................Our marriage starts going downhill after the surgery and the sebsequent side effects, then he gets called from Army reservist status to serve active duty in Iraq. While he is gone, we mend our marriage, the best we can from over 7000 miles away and 14 months over the telephone and e-mails. He's been back 6 months now and our marriage is heading down the same path that it was before he left............NOT good. Don't get me wrong........When our relationship is good....it's fantastic! but when it's bad...it sucks. I'm sure "C" feels the same way. I have to say here that I do love him very dearly and I know part of me always will.  As I said...............I love him dearly but we both have "issues" and I have a major issue because I know (he told me in detail of his infidelities) that he cheated on his former wife of 17 years almost the whole time they were married. I, having the overactive imagination that I do....can't stop myself from thinking....."once a cheater, always a cheater", "you can't teach an old dog new tricks".  So now...............exactly one week ago yesterday,I  go to see my GYN (female doctoer for all you guys out there) and we change my hormones around AGAIN!! For those of you who don't already know this.....hormones can wreak havoc on a woman in many ways....mood swings.....sex drive, ability to gain or lose weight....body temperature, you name it and it's on the list. So anyway.........I'm babbling.....what do ya know??? WALA!!! My doc and I have found that magic potion and now my hormones seem to be very balanced and FANTASTIC (for now anyway..knocks on wood) , in just one weeks time, I have tons of energy, I am dropping extra pounds like  hot potatoes and my sex drive is through the roof, literally! and NOW, NOW of all times........"C" has decided to NOT speak to me and I mean totally NOT speak to me at ALL!!! (I think I've heard that somewhere before.....lol)  You have to realize that LAST time he did this "I'm not speaking to you thing" he went and filed for divorce and on Valentine's Day none the less, so YEP!!! I think I do have reasons to feel paranoid. He later changed his mind and had the divorce dropped.  Part of me says "grow up, your acting like a 15 year old asshole" and the other part of me screams...why now???? not now!!!!! Just when things are on the upswing for me in the  life  department, my marriage is heading down south. What the hell is up with that??? I'm so torn between "damn, I'm tired of these childish games......to hell with it all, let's move on" -to- "OMG!! I love this man with all my heart and I can't imagine being without him. So what's a girl to do??  I guess I've babbled enough for a first post..............any insight, any ideas??? anyone been there, done that? I'll try to get into more details in another post and ALSO try not to bore y'all to death with my sometimes incoherent babbling :o)  Not so sure how this whole "blogging" thing works and exactly how to set up this site with a list of other blogs that I read so if anyone has any tips...my ears are wide open and awaiting your advice.  By the way....Go USA, can you  believe  how the individual all-around gymnastic finals turned out? WOOHOOO for us! We ROCK!!  "D"
