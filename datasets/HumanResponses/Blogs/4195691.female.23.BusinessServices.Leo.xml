       So I'm back on the emotional roller coaster that is called love, or at least something like it.  My email definitely was effective........and of course, me being the girl that I am, gave in to amazing make-up sex.  Does giving in make me a failure I wonder?      Today is Friday the 13th.  Hmmmm..............my horoscope said that I would be experiencing new things.  I have decided to go out tonight and ride a mechanical bull.        Yesterday I went to a nude beach with my best friend.  We had some crazy moments.  Some guy came and asked us to rub lotion on his back.  As if that was a totally normal thing??!!  As he squatted directly in front of us with his entire package hanging there, I could not be silent and began to laugh uncontrollably.  Was that proper nude beach etiquette I wonder?  Then we played naked in the ocean.  How cool was that??!!  Completely liberating.  After hours of skinny dipping, we proceded to lay out again, only to have another man come over and tell us he had just got stung by a bee on his ass, and asked if we could check and see if the stinger was still in his butt.  I didn't know what to do, so just offered him some Golden Door sunblock with aloe.  HAHA.......we are so Paris/Nicole on the Simple Life.        We also saw the most gorgeous naked guy ever.  He was basking in the sun, totally comfortable with his nudity (then again, if I was a guy and looked like that I would be comfortable too).  Again, I think we violated the protocol of nude beaching as we stared for an indefinite period of time.  He came and splashed in the water with us.  :)  (Drool drool)       Now here is the dilemma:  how do you pick up on someone at a nude beach?  Or do you?  I mean, if some hot naked guy (i.e. hot naked guy I stared at all afternoon) came up and talked to me totally nude in the water, I think I would just skip all conversation and just go for it......does that make me a total whore?  Haha......honestly I don't care.         Ok, well I could write all day about the joys of nude sunbathing and skinny dipping, but I think I am going to attempt at cleaning my house.  Ugh.......what a boring thing to do for a Friday.  Maybe I'll just give up, hire someone to clean for me, and go lay out.........much better plan.

       ok......so i gave my dog a tennis ball 5 mins ago.  She has already destroyed the entire thing and is chewing on the little bits.  How come I can't be that content??!!      So I finally got an email back from this guy.  It says "I'm sorry I am being a jerk.  I just think that your email is outlandish."  First of all, who uses the word outlandish anymore??!!  I then wrote back saying maybe we should just cut all our ties.  He didn't write back.  FUCK!!!!  That was not supposed to be the answer I should get.  I am going over there tonight to pick up my stuff that was at his house.  I am totally playing out all scenarios in my mind.        I HATE THIS!!!!!!!!!  But the weird thing is we both said we didn't want commitments right now.  So I lied.        My heart hurts.  And this really sucks.

       So this is my birthday week........and it sucks.        I have been dating this guy and now I have no idea where it is going.  I said something dumb, and I think we are not talking.  But then again, I did have an IM today.....it said "hello".  WTF is up with that??!!  We don't talk for two days, and all that is said is "hello"????!!!!  I am noticeably irritated.        Worst part?  I left two movies at his house that were due at Hollywood Video like 3 weeks ago......should I go get them I wonder?        Ugh.  I really like him too.  I am so frustrated.
