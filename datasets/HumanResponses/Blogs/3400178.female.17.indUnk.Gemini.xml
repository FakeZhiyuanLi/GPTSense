      I've been busy and haven't gotten a chance to write.  This week has been pretty easy. Just reviewing and stuff. Tomorrow is our last day! Yay! This summer is going to be absolutely wonderful!   My birthday is coming up. June 9th! I'll be in Houston for officer camp. Please call and make me feel loved! It's hard being away from the people you love and want to spend time with on your b-day! (even though ill have 3 of my best friends ASH ALS AND JEN!) with me! It'd be nice to be home.  Today after exams the sr. officers and sarah jane stayed to help dj jones clean out the office. Boy was it a mess! It took about 2 hours. It was fun though! I found pictures of Ashley Hayden from her sophomore year. Hah she looked so goofy! Tomorrow I have officer practice after exams from 12-2. Sam Ash Jen and I are supposed to go to some graduation party for one of Sam's friends. We'll see how that goes.  Graduation is coming way to soon. Its finally hitting me that Tyler will be leaving. All my "brothers" are leaving me. Justin, Okwus, Rick, Brandon...I dont know what Im gonna do without them. Dont know how Im gonna get through my sr. year without my favorite boys being here with me.   hmm..thats it for now. Nothing exciting.  Song of the night: Simple Together / Alanis Morissette  You've been my golden best friend And now with post-demise at hand I can't go to you for consolation Cuz we're off limits during this transition  This grief overwhelms me It burns in my stomach And I can't stop bumping into things  I thought we'd be simple together I thought we'd be happy together thought we'd be limitless together I thought we'd be precious together But I was sadly mistaken  You've been my soulmate and then some I remembered you the moment I met you With you I knew god's face was handsome With you I saw fun and expansion  This loss is numbing me it pierces my chest And I can't stop dropping everything  I thought we'd be sexy together thought we'd be evolving together I thought we'd have children together I thought we'd be family together But I was sadly mistaken  If I had a bill for all the philosophies I shared If I had a penny for all the possibilities I presented If I had a dime for every hand thrown up in the air My wealth would render this no less severe  I thought we'd be genius together I thought we'd be healing together I thought we'd be growing together thought we'd be adventurous together But I was sadly mistaken  thought we'd be exploring together thought we'd be inspired together I thought we'd be flying together thought we'd be on fire together but I was sadly mistaken  ^ wonderful wonderful song! Alanis is amazing..

      Today was such a relaxing day. After Lariettes, I came home and slept for three hours. Felt so good-I've had trouble sleeping lately. If it weren't for Tylenol PM I wouldnt have slept the past 2 nights. Anyways after waking up I went and got me some Taco Bell and a slurpee! YUMMM!! Hah I love food.  Gosh, tonight for dinner my mom made this chicken stuff that I dont like. She told me I couldnt get up from the table until I ate it (and gave me the I need protein so I dont get dizzy talk)  So I tried eating it but it kept making me gag. Blah and everyone kept making fun of me. Not nice!!!   Ashley came by to see me today! We talked for a loooong time! I love that girl!! We were talking about how much Ive changed lately and stuff. Really good talk. After she left my mom and I talked about like how much Ive grown up since the beginning of the year and what Ive learned...  what this past year has taught me.. - although it was hard, starting all over was the best thing I couldve done for myself  - surround yourself with positive people - people can tell you they love you 1000 times yet dont mean it - taking too much time off dance will kill you - your "best" friend can let you down - springer will now decide who i date ("i love you lace but what the hell were you thinking with that one!"-springer haha!!) - there ARE good guys out there (alli's got one of em! what guy randomly buys his gf a charmbraclet with charms of all the things they've done together!? MICHAEL! Guys you all need to be like him!) - Guys who can dance (not like jazz and tap) are hot - Manners are a big turn on. - There are some NASSTTY girls in our school. - Laughter is the best medicine. - Guys will do anything to get in your pants.  - Sometimes I just need to keep my mouth shut - "Letting go is the kindest thing" - Forgiving doesnt mean forgetting  - Always be the "bigger" person - People will try their hardest to bring you down just for laughs - And last but not least, it doesnt get much better than being a Lariette! :)  Thats all for tonight! Much love to all my wonderful friends!
