So, dont make this mistake again. thk god no one was injured, including the lab.  ok back to 2day. early morning a gal from ed. board went into our library to get photos of us boys. hahha it's gonna come out in the skool mag. well..the main focus was 2day's st. john class. wong ai lynn really smacked me by shutting my mouth everytime she asks a question to us recruits. dunno y...jus trying to answer. maybe she thought i answer enough correctly. let the other recruits do the *umm......* thats' all i wanna say i guess.  cheerio!
