       What do you say about a place that can take away 6 hours of fatigue and dust in an instant? About a patch of the deepest blue and green in the middle of thousands of miles of browns and grays? A place the makes you want to stay put and not want to see or do anything else? Breathtaking, awe-inspiring, beautiful, fabulous, overwhelming… all sound too short of the apt description. Maybe ‘chandertal-ed’ should be an expression that describes what one feels at the first sight of those blue waters.   Chandertal lake, Spiti, Himachal Pradesh, India. We reached the lake on July 16. We had left from Batal at 8 in the morning. We had known that the path was 18 km long, most of it on a jeep track leading to the lake. Batal had been dusty, barren and incredibly windy. We didn’t think the rest of the way could be any better. It wasn’t.   A dusty morose bend led to another, which led to yet another, and the track seemed endless. But thankfully there were no jeeps plying that day and the only other people we saw were the distant dots of each other. Asu, Anju and Rinku were ahead of me, three specks in the far distance. Komal was somewhere round one of the curves in the road behind us.   I had heard a lot about the lake, had seen posters and postcards. Will it live up to the expectations? The other groups had given themselves a rest day at the lake. That should have warned me that once there, even I wouldn’t want to leave. We had decided against the rest day so that we could keep up with the rest of the groups all the way to Baralacha La.   The last km before you come to the lake starts with a steep climb. You expect to go up that and to see the lake lying there, below in the valley. That is the only thought that drives you up the climb… that you are almost there, after more than 5 hours of plodding on a dusty jeep track.   You reach on top and you see the path going further. A few Gaddi shepherds are minding their flocks on the slope; there is more than a hint of green grass… so, it must be round that bend you see. Or so you hope.   The bend leads to another bend and yet another till you say that it’s all an illusion and no place can be worth this. And you start asking why they didn’t extend the track all the way to the lake, why leave the eager people to pant up that last km? After cussing and dragging your feet some more, you come round another curve in the road and there is a little patch of blue a little way down.   Maybe what they say about the Chandertal waters is true. It must have some ‘jadi-booti’, some magical, healing powers that gives you an energizer to go rushing those last couple of hundred meters. A short descent and there it is… the fine white sand leading to the blue water that is gently lapping at your feet. There is a small cairn to mark the head of the lake. Like you need anything to tell you are at the most beautiful place you can hope to be at.   Nothing prepares you for the first sight. Not the posters, not the postcards, not the descriptions that others have given you. For it is simply not possible to capture the magic in a 7”x18” or words or expressions. The first expression that comes to mind is what Khem always uses – Shanti Life! That is what it seems like… peace in its truest sense and life like how god meant for us to live it.   When the mesmerizing effect that the water had on me had worn off a little, I dragged my eyes away to take in the almost 360 degree view of the CB range around the lake. CB 13 was to the left and a little further away, an awesome glacier I didn’t know the name of. Behind me, more of the CB range stretched away into the distance, giving a feel of being in a Roman amphitheatre with your personal troupe of snow, ice and heights giving a classical performance.   The thought that this performance was eternal, 365x24x7, while I was there for a mere hours… if that wasn’t reason enough to regret, what was? Our camp was to the far side of the lake, so we would be away from the tourists who trudged up from their jeeps to take a couple of snaps, throw Kurkure or Lays wrappers, create noise and rush back to Batal or Kaza.   I took my time walking the nearly-a-kilometer to the camp. The path was right next to the water all the way and when the urge struck, I would take off my floaters and wade into it. The solitude during that walk was coveted and I made the most of it… stretching it till the last minute. I sat on rocks, with my feet in the water and just let the sun, the water, the amphitheatre-effect, all just glide over me… it was nothing like anything I had experienced before. Again, the Khemism, Shanti Life, came to mind. I could say, “This is life” and mean it in the 1½ hours it took me to finally get to the camp.   After the exhilaration, came the jealousy. I didn’t want those dumb tourists there, I didn’t want the rest of the 4 groups that would make their way to Tokpoyongma from there the next day. I didn’t even want the dhaba that a Gaddiwala had opened in corner. I was suddenly glad that the road didn’t extend all the way to the lake. Let those who want to see this surreal setting sweat it out a bit. Even better, that jeep track itself should be destroyed. The place should not be as accessible as it has become. Let there be a filter so that only the deserving finally get the coveted reward.   And as if to protect this territory that I would love to claim mine, and to get more of the lake, of the surroundings, I decided to stay back. As I felt at that point, I had not decided to stay back… the lake had asked me to.   My reasoning to Rinku: the only exciting things about the next 3 days were the two river crossings and the pass at Baralacha. We had already crossed 2 rivers and innumerable streams, so I didn’t see the need to cross any more. And as for the pass, there was a road going through Baralacha. So, I would anyways get to see it on my way to Leh. What I really wanted to do was stay on the far bank, once the groups had left, and take in the aura of the lake as it was, minus the human interruption.   I could always sleep at the Gaddi’s dhaba, I said. I really just want to stay here, read and write for two days, I claimed. But to no effect. The horseman and Rinku had decided that splitting a group was not the way to go about it and finally emotionally blackmailed me into continuing the trek.   Once that was decided, the time between then and the sunset was all I had to finish my parikrama of the lake. I wanted to be alone, away from the Brit and Dutch groups that had taken to the water, had washed in the lake itself (Let’s see them do that to their Lake District!!! The worms!!) and were generally creating chaos. I took off on my own, vehemently putting off the girls who offered come with me. When they persisted, I walked faster and put the distance between us. It was a highly personal, intimate and emotional experience for me… almost spiritual and I wasn’t ready to share it with anyone.   The next morning, we were to set out at 6. It was already light when we woke up and the sun was just greeting CB 13 by the time we were ready to leave. I was ready earlier than the rest, took 10 minutes off to walk a little distance and say my goodbyes. I promised myself and the lake that I would be back soon and the next time round, to stay for more than a day or two... till the lake asked me to leave.

       A news snippet I read recently says that blogging is the 'in' thing and you might even get the latest news on blogs rather than any other corner of the cyber world. The inspiration to finally create one came from Hema ( urlLink http://hemarprasad.blogspot.com )&nbsp;who has decided to use her blog to publish my random reminisces. Maybe if my writings turn less random, then this blog should serve its purpose.

       When you have found the right person a lifetime seems insufficient. But when a lifetime is not possible, even a week will suffice. That’s what N wrote in his blog about his latest romantic debacle.  But how do you define the “right person”? It’s not the statistics – background, career, responsibility, availability, age, height, complexion, food habits. It’s not the “opposites attract” analogy. It’s not the heart-over-mind way either. It’s not even a combination of all these. It’s more like a little bit of some of these and lots of something else. Is it the comfort? Is it instinct? Is it the feel that the other person and you put together = right / magic?  I haven’t figured out what it is. But a tiny step closer – I have understood what it isn’t. it is not statistics. Hell, if statistics were the only or main consideration, half the relationships or marriages would not exist. C would not be in a jet-setting career, with a relationship back home with a younger Mallu boy, atleast not at 26. she would have been married to a nice, Kong boy who was 3 years older than her. She would probably be teaching kids in a small school.  It statistics had their way, I would not have gone around with T. I would have recently married or had one planned for the near future with a boy who came from a similar background, who could speak kannada, ate veg food most of the time and who could relate to me and my family at some level.  With the right statistics, H would not have contemplated a relationship that wounds like a recipe for everything that could go wrong. At best, she would have married a good Iyengar boy, at worst, she would have married C.  Nah! It’s not the statistics.

       What is it about the rains? It makes you sit and wonder in the middle of the day, mindless of work or any other obligations. The gray brings on a sense of melancholy and nostalgia and soon enough, if the rain gods don’t play spoilsport, introspection.  Deepak had told me once before that the rains make him think – a little sad, a little wondering. The heavy drops seem to enter thoughts and make them soggy. Chirpy, flippant thoughts get weighed down and it’s the more intense emotions that come up. Like a ritual bath, the water acts as a catalyst for emotional catharsis. You first bring up the heavier feelings and by the time the rain finally lets up, you have gotten rid of the excess baggage and ready to take on the new, bright green world… on fresh terms.  Rains create the right atmosphere for an engaging book, a hot cup of chai and a serving of spicy pakoras. But when none of the three are available, your thoughts (that you had stored away to be brought out and examined on a rainy day) make a good enough substitute. Not all that you feel are depressing. You could long for a place, situation or a person that would be ideal to spend the rainy day with. Or you could even just sit and wonder at God’s creation in giving the world a fresh coat and count yourself lucky to be present there looking at it, being a part of it.  When the first few stray thoughts have come and gone, when after watching the rain as an outsider for a few minutes, you decide to be part of it… when you step into the downpour and the first few drops hit you… that is when you feel that yes, God indeed loves you.  Like Sandeep wrote, miracles happen everyday. And rain is a miracle. Ignoring the scientific process of how rains come about, just watching the gray clouds unloading with loud protests in the form of thunder is miracle enough. It is a natural shower, a life giver, a nurturer and nature’s way of respite. Washing away the grime we leave on the leaves and grass from vehicle fumes, causing the seeds to germinate, watering the forests that we don’t bother to protect and giving a much-needed break after the long and exhausting summer months. That is not one miracle, it’s a galaxy of miracles that we fail to see.  There are those of them who like to stay warm and dry and there are those of us who wait for the first showers to go and get drenched. For the former, we are the nutters. For us, they are the ones missing out on the miracle. Both say “It’s raining!” but in different tones. Hema, Deepak, Deepika, Tanu… we are the nutters and thank god for that.

       Monsoons in the mountains… it’s nothing like what you would have experienced before. Mumbaiites will be familiar with days and weeks of unceasing rains, Bangaloreans know the endless cloudy days with intermittent rains, Chennaiites recognize the stench that envelopes the city as the clouds roll in from the Bay of Bengal and the people in Delhi identify the brief pleasant climate between the hot summers and freezing winters.  Up in the mountains, it’s a matter of distinguishing the monsoons from the occasional seasonal storms that go on throughout the year. The storms bring in angry black clouds from over the higher ranges into the valleys for a spat of rain, thunder and bad weather for a few days. The monsoons, on the other hand, take a while to arrive here from the Indian plains. Starting from Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, they gradually move up to Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and a couple of months later to the northern Gangetic plains. They take a good three months to finally hit the foothills of the Himalayas and move on up from there.  When they finally arrive, it’s not sudden. For days, the temperature hovers over the late 20s and early 30s – shockingly hot by mountain standards. It gets humid and you wait for the rains to finally arrive and cool the place. And then the clouds break over the foothills and there is a deluge. Well, a deluge might not be the right word, but a continuous drizzle doesn’t sum it up well either. It rains almost continuously with brief periods of respite when the people rush out to cut grass, collect their cattle from the grazing grounds or get the week’s rations and vegetables. The brilliant views of the snow peaks get covered and you get treated to a cloud cover that seems so low, you could touch it.   Everything seems to get a fresh wash – the conifers look darker, the grass and paddy fields look greener, the ripening apples seem redder. The sky has a coating of dark gray and for the next 6 or 8 weeks you can forget about having a glimpse of the much-described full moon and stars. The temperature suddenly plunges and out come the windcheaters, jackets and umbrellas.   The water level in the streams and the rivers rise till its all a muddy haze. The flimsy bridges look even more so. In the more populated areas, the roads turn into a slushy, plastic-covered mess and the people transform into blobs of various bright colors with their rain-protection gear.  I am part of the gang that thinks that the monsoons have been made for a 2-month-long reading session to be broken only for hot mugs of coffee and pakoras. But doing it in the Himalayas, with a grayish, indistinct view of the nearby mountains through the rain… that’s an experience to cherish and worth traveling all the way here for.  That probably explains the 7 odd books that I have managed to finish in the last 10 days and the gallons of lemon tea at Mount View (Hema, you will know what I mean). Pakoras, sadly, I have had to make do without. I don’t want to take the trouble of making them and you don’t get them at Mount View. So, for now, it’s chai accompanied by endless orders of Tibetan momos.
