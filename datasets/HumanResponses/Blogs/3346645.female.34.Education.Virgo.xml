      I see I'm not the only one dreaming of  urlLink frozen treats . When strawberry season is over, I plan on trying the Lavender Sorbet, maybe with a Lemon Mint sauce, or maybe I'll create a Lavender Lemon Mint Sorbet.

      Driving home from my sister's, having harvested some mint "growing like a weed" in her yard, I was thinking about the Strawberry Mint ice cream I'm going to make this weekend after strawberry picking, when I came to a red light. As you know, the gas engine shuts off and the car is totally silent, and I noticed the music that had been playing on the radio. It was beautiful - Elgar's Serenade for Strings - and I almost missed it, lost as I was in my thoughts of ice cream. It makes me wonder what else I have missed by not noticing.

       urlLink Everybody  is talking about this  urlLink Constable  exhibit. I don't know if I can resist the hype any longer. Is there time this weekend for a trip to the country for strawberries and a trip to the city for cloud paintings?

      This recipe is inspired by a recipe in Wild About Muffins by Angela Clubb, but I've changed it so much, I think the recipe needs to be written down in its perfected form.  Preheat oven to 400 F and prepare pan. In a large bowl, combine:    zest of 1 orange    1 egg    1/3 cup canola oil    1/3 cup sugar    juice of 1 orange (about 1/2 cup)    1/2 cup currants In a smaller bowl, combine:    1/2 cup oat flour (can substitute white flour)    1/2 cup white flour    1/2 cup whole wheat flour    1 tsp. baking powder    1 tsp. baking soda    1/4 tsp. nutmeg    1/2 tsp cinnamon Combine wet and dry mixtures, pour into pan, and bake for 15-20 minutes.

      Continuing to consider what I love about dancing, this quote from A Separate Peace by John Knowles:  "Under the influence not I know of the hardest cider but of his own inner joy at life for a moment as it should be, as it was meant to be in his nature, Phineas recaptured that magic gift for existing primarily in space, one foot conceding briefly to gravity its rights before spinning him off again into the air. It was his wildest demonstration of himself, of himself in the kind of world he loved; it was his choreography of peace."  There is so much that I love about this book, but especially the way Knowles captures isolated moments in time and then offers them to the reader. I'm much less interested in the plot, and I honestly don't like the characters all that much, but so many times while reading, I find myself waking up out of the story and into a stunning moment, like Phineas dancing at the Winter Carnival. It's this that I love so much about the book, that it forces me almost in spite of myself to leave the story and become more aware of my own senses.

      Hey kid. Even though it was hard not to laugh when the temple came crashing down like something out of the Flintstones, I still enjoyed the spectacle of  urlLink La Bayadere , the sparkly costumes and the guy all painted gold, and of course Paloma's feet.  It was fun being in the glittery jewel box Met for a change since I usually find myself at the State Theatre (I forgot to look at the Chagalls.) I fell asleep dreaming about Angel's flying leaps, impossibly aggressive turns, and his beautiful pas de deux with Paloma. But despite all this, there was surprisingly little that actually inspired me and I'm wondering why. The bland unmemorable music? Thinking about the dances that have inspired me recently - Paul Taylor's Sunset and Promethean Fire - Balanchine's Jewels and Liebeslieder Waltzer - it's not just that the music was lovely. I don't really even like Stravinsky much, and the second movement of Sunset is danced in silence except for the sound of loons calling. It's more the feeling that the music and dancers are able to convey together, at the point where you can't separate the dance from the music from the feeling and it all becomes a big thing like a blanket that wraps you up or a wave that carries you away. To me it's comparable to the feeling of flying in dreams. It's what I love about watching dance more than any other performing art, when it happens - and it's rare.  La Bayadere had moments of exquisite beauty and truly phenomenal dancing, but the most inspiring point of my evening was the chocolate mousse at  urlLink Le Madeleine.

      I was thinking this morning that  urlLink Williams  was right - so much does depend on a red wheelbarrow. like so much depends on green tea pot filled with earl grey tea. and on a bunch of multicolored carnations on the bathroom sink. and the bowl of oranges that will become the most amazing orange currant muffins you've ever tasted. And it's why I chose this  urlLink  title.

      I have been complaining for a long time that our government doesn't do enough to encourage people to use renewable energy - instead it feels like it's our patriotic duty to use as much oil as possible. But I am very excited today because I just read that in NY and NJ, you can choose to get your electricity from renewable energy sources. All you have to do is sign up  urlLink here . Check the  urlLink Green-e website  to see if it's available in your state.  Tell your friends and neighbors! Tell your parents! Tell everyone to switch!

      Adapted from the Once Upon a Tart cookbook by Frank Mentesana and Jerome Audureau. Go to their  urlLink bakery in NYC  for yummy scones!  SALAD  4 servings 1 cup bulgur wheat 1 1/4 cup boiling water 3-4 garden summer tomatoes  VINAIGRETTE juice of 1/2 lemon, about 1Tbsp 1 tsp sea salt 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper 2 Tbsp olive oil a bunch of chopped fresh basil (The recipe calls for 1/4 cup parseley which I'm sure would be delicious, but all I have today is basil, which is very nice also.)  Place the bulgur in a bowl big enough for the whole salad. Pour the boiling water over the bulgur, cover it and let sit for 20 minutes while the bulgur absorbs the water. Fluff it with a fork and taste it. If it's still crunchy, add more water and let sit some more. Chop the tomatoes and add to the bulgur. Mix up the vinaigrette and toss it all up in the bowl. Serve chilled.

      Adapted from a recipe in Country Home magazine - which I wouldn't normally read, but I found a bunch of decorating magazines on the top of the recycling pile in my building, and I can't resist a decorating magazine, which is lucky for me because I found this recipe for cookies which are quite seriously without any exaggeration whatsoever, the best I have ever eaten.  With a pot of Earl Grey tea of course.  1 cup butter - that's 2 sticks 2/3 cup sugar 1 egg 1 1/2 cup flour 1 tsp baking powder 1 Tbsp lavender flowers 8 oz. bittersweet chocolate  Soften butter in the microwave and mix it up until it's light and fluffy. Add the sugar and keep mixing. Add the egg and mix some more. Mix the flour together with the baking powder and the lavender. Mix this in with the butter mixture. Drop the dough by teaspoons 2 inches apart on parchment-lined cookie sheets. Bake at 350 degrees for 15-18 minutes or until edges are golden. Cool the cookies completely. Melt the chocolate. Dip half of each cookie into the chocolate and place dipped cookies on parchment paper until the chocolate hardens. Makes 48 small cookies.

      Now I know  urlLink some of you  think that since school is out and I'm not working for the summer that I wake up at noon and just sit around my apartment in my pajamas while ebay shopping. Well, it's not true (not today anyway - yesterday is another story). Today I got up at 7 am and by 10 I had showered, eaten a healthy breakfast of pound cake and blueberries with the last of the lemon curd I made last week, baked a loaf of bread, made tabbouleh, and - you're not going to believe this - washed the dishes. And I know that you are thinking, "Sure, but it's 3 o'clock now. What have you done lately?" Well, I didn't even stop for some well deserved snuggle time with Fumi. I started a car sharing co-op, commissioned a rug from joe who knows more about felt than anyone I know, organized my mother's needlepoint, and discovered one I want to frame, thereby saving myself the $750 I was considering spending on this  urlLink serigraph  for my living room wall. And furthermore, as I type this, there are cookies cooling in the kitchen, waiting to be dipped in chocolate, but I can't say any more about that because they are a surprise for my sister. All that I've said is true - except I did make one ebay bid today, but it's an absolutely darling dress, a real cutie. I just couldn't let it get away!

      1) DO sit as close as possible to the overfriendly group of older people. They will scare off the other potentially more obnoxious people who would otherwise end up near you, and they might share their food with you. Also, they will probably leave early, giving you even more space. 2) DO bring a larger blanket than you think you will need for your party. Tell other people who want to sit near you that you are expecting 12 more people. 3) DON'T sit near the group of Europeans. Their sense of personal space is just different from ours. Plus they will be the only people smoking. 4) DO bring lots of really really good food to avoid the feeling of picnic envy. 5) DON'T try to go get tea less than a half hour before the concert starts. The guards will make it near impossible to return to your place. 6) DO surreptitiously hide the camera of the group next to you, or at least break the flash. This will make your evening much more pleasant. 7) DON'T try to listen to the music. You'd be better off with your stereo at home. 8) DO leave as soon as the humanity starts to get unbearable. If you stay longer, it only gets worse.

      Why don't kids listen to  urlLink classical music ?  urlLink Aaron  has some interesting ideas about how to combine what kids should hear with what they want to hear, but I find myself asking why? Why do we want kids to value something that has no relevance for them? I have this argument regarding literature all the time. There are always parents and teachers who want to force kids to read the classics. So kids read an abridged Great Expectations, don't get it, and never pick up Dickens again. What is the goal, to make kids hate reading? I always recommend to these people, let the kids read what they want. Let them learn to find the books that appeal to them. If they love reading, they will eventually find the classics, or they will create new classics (as with all the kids who got their parents to read Harry Potter). I am enthusiastic about classic books that I love: Anne of Green Gables, The Wind in the Willows. I don't mind recommending them to kids who love reading, but I would not suggest to kids that these books are more important than the books that they love.

      With only one week left of school, I'm thinking about the  urlLink books I have read this year,  and sadly, very few of them stand out as being spectacular. Easily, the best book I have read this year is East by Edith Pattou. It ranks up there with my favorites Beauty by Robin McKinley and The Golden Compass by Phillip Pullman. Love Among the Walnuts was fun, as was Inkheart, but I suspect I may forget them pretty soon.  I know there are lots of wonderful books out there. Why have I not been finding them recently? My goal this summer is to read only great great books to make up for this lost year. Does anyone have any suggestions for my summer reading list?

      Critics like this movie better than the first two - that should have been my first clue. Even last Friday, after 7th grade Ilana told me she had seen it and it was boring, I still had high hopes for the movie. After all, she hadn't read the books - maybe she just didn't understand the appeal of Harry Potter. But now that I have seen the movie, I think it may be more accurate to say that director Alfonso Cuaron doesn't understand the appeal of Harry Potter.  Don't get me wrong. It's a beautiful movie and I understand why the critics like it. I like it very much too. But I also understand why the kids are disappointed with it - and they really are. Every kid I've talked to who has seen it was disappointed. Not just in a "it could never be as good as the books" way. They were prepared for that and dealt with it after the first two movies. But rather, in a "where is the Harry Potter I know and love?" way. Where is Hogwarts? Where is Dumbledore? (well, I know, you can't replace Richard Harris, but how wonderful would it have been to see  urlLink Peter O'Toole  in the role?) Where is Ron and Fred and George? Cuaron took out all the joy of being at Hogwarts in order to focus on Harry's archetypal  urlLink "path to manhood".  But this was a mistake.  My favorite part of each of the books is the moment when Harry is liberated from his dreadful muggle life and is reunited with Ron and Hermione. Rowlings' strength as a writer is her ability to get that right - to make the characters' joy and relief at being back where they belong ring true. Prisoner of Azkaban is even more touching than the first two because Harry realizes he has a godfather in the wizarding world - he has a family of his own. The importance that Harry places on this makes Sirius hugely important in the next books, so that when Sirius dies, Harry really has lost a member of his family. In the movie when Sirius invites Harry to come live with him, it should be a touching moment. It should evoke emotion, but I can't even remember Harry's response. I felt that way about several scenes in the movie that should have made me sympathetic to Harry, but just didn't. There was no joy at escaping the Durseley's, none at seeing his friends again or arriving at Hogwarts. There was no joy in going to Hogsmeade, or discovering that Lupin was an ally against Snape. When comparing the third movie with the first two, it's this sense of joy that I miss most. The first two had it. Prisoner makes reference to it once in a while (flying on a hippogriff looks fun), but I didn't feel it, not even close.

      Oh, my  urlLink poncho  is going to be so pretty! The yarn arrived on Tuesday - Bernat Rayon/ cotton blend that says "Washable" but I'm a little skeptical. Anyway, like I was saying, the yarn arrived a week after I ordered it from Ebay ($25.00! I love Ebay), but I had rehearsal, so I couldn't start knitting right away. I wound a couple of the skeins into balls at least and did a test square. I decided to knit it using three strands together. I brought it to rehearsal because there is always a little waiting around, and I managed to cast on and get a few rows knitted. But it was driving me crazy not being able to knit, even if I was dancing. And yesterday I brought it with me to school in case I had some time - I was hoping for a big traffic jam on 280, but no such luck. Boy, people are really impatient if you don't start driving the second the light turns green! So for the most part yesterday, I had to wait until after school to make any real progress. But now it's coming along nicely and I really love it. The yarn is not the softest and I almost wish I had a strand of mohair to mix in (I wouldn't be me if I couldn't find something to criticize), but the color is so beautiful and I have waited so long for my summer poncho concept to materialize, that I am going with the yarn as it is. And I am determined to be thrilled with it and wear it every single day of the summer.

      Back at the State Theater for more ballet. I think  urlLink Aaron  is becoming a true fan, even if some of the dancers were less inspiring than others. (Although, I am very flattered by the comparison with Darci Kistler.) First on the program was  urlLink Who Cares . I found very little to care about. I thought it was just plain boring. Ashley's solo was well executed, but it couldn't get me excited about the ballet as a whole. The pas de deux with Nilas could have been lovely, except for his complete lack of any appeal whatsoever. The ballet picked up some steam towards the end, but it was just much too long, and I was glad when it was over. Thankfully, the rest of the program improved with  urlLink Barber Violin Concerto . Maybe the orchestra could have played better, but I stopped noticing as soon as Darci and Jock entered. Her dancing was just so alive, I couldn't take my eyes off her. Aaron had some ideas about the dance being a contrast being classicism and something else, or maybe it was the ego and the id. Aaron is smart and I think he is probably right, but I confess I reacted to the ballet on a purely emotional level. Just watching the dancers move seamlessly with the stunning music is all the reason I need. Finally,  urlLink I'm Old Fashioned , a tribute to Fred Astaire, which I think Aaron didn't like as much (but then, he prefers Gene Kelly). I was disappointed that the top of the projection screen was cut off from where we were in the 4th ring. The effect of Astaire dancing behind the ballet was completely lost up there. If I had known that, I would have splurged for Orchestra seats. I loved the ballet anyway, as I think I would love any sincere tribute to Fred Astaire. In fact I got a little choked up when the audience broke into applause for him. And now I want to see the movie You Were Never Lovelier which I've never seen and why did no one tell me Rita Hayworth could dance?

      Tired of museum posters and inspired by Terry Teachout, I am seriously considering spending a lot of money (for me) on a piece of art. I have narrowed down the choice to five, all by Wolf Kahn, whom I chose because I love his work and I feel pretty certain that my money is just as safe in one of his pastels as it would be in the stock market. Well, ok, maybe not, but I will enjoy it more.  urlLink Rose   urlLink Improbable Pink Stripe   urlLink Small Path, Deep Woods   urlLink Pale Blue Sky   urlLink Evening Breeze

      I've been thinking about all the stuff we keep around us and the different reasons we use for justifying it. In cleaning out my apartments over the years (and other people's) I've noticed that some stuff loses its sentimental value over time, while other stuff is sacred.  When I moved out of the apartment I had shared with John, almost nothing was sacred. I got rid of everything that would remind me of him. I didn't bring a single piece of furniture that we had bought together. Even though my new apartment was almost completely empty, it felt great to be rid of the stuff that had fit me when it was me and John, but didn't fit me anymore. Five years later I don't regret anything I got rid of. But I did save a few pictures of him and a representative sample of the letters he had written to me in college. I didn't save all of them, just one or two so I could trigger those memories if I wanted to. These I am glad I saved, because they remind me that we were actually in love and I didn't imagine it all. But there was no other part of our lives together that I wanted to carry over into my life without him. My iPod reflects the clutter that old relationships have left in my life. But, in trying to clear it out I realize there is some music that I just can't be objective about. Do I like Al Green? I don't know, but it reminds me of Joe, so it stays. I got rid of most of the Elvis Costello except North, which I keep as a reminder of the two-week hit and run relationship with the jerk now known as Friendster John. Bjork, Portishead, Creeper Lagoon, Tom Waits, any and all bluegrass, Soul Coughing, Zero 7, Saint Germain, The Sea and Cake, all sacred for some reason that I'm not sure has to do with their musical merits. When my mom died, I truly realized how a person's stuff can trigger memories, and I was afraid to get rid of any of it. I clung to every little thing. So I saved some pretty irrational things, but some have remained sacred. I saved three huge bags of unfinished needlepoints. My mom hadn't actually finished a needlepoint project since 1976, but I took these bags and vowed to finish them all for her. (It makes me wonder if there is someone in my life who, when I'm gone will take all of my knitting projects and finish them.) I took all of her classical music collection, most of it on warped and badly labeled cassette tapes that she had saved from her father's collection. I've taken it upon myself to preserve her collection on CD. And I saved her classical sheet music in case I ever learn how to play piano. I saved a lot of other random stuff - books, plates, baskets - and have since gotten rid of it, but the needlepoint and the music is still sacred for some reason. It's not as if these things are a distillation of my mother. I haven't boiled down the essence of her memory to music and needlepoint. The longer I live without her, the more I realize that I don't need stuff to remind me of her. She is everywhere. Rather, I keep these things because these are the ways I want to emulate her in my life.  Bike touring makes you realize just how little you actually need - and believe me, it all fits on the back of a bike. It certainly fits in a 200 sq. ft. apartment. But there is so much stuff we feel we need to hold on to for different reasons I guess, to preserve and relive memories, or in case we want to write a book. . . but I suspect that the stuff we choose to keep really just reflects who we want to be. That when we stop wanting to be that person, then the stuff stops being sacred for us, and becomes stuff that we can and should live without.

      As an update to my  urlLink Outdoor concert do's and don'ts  list,  urlLink Aaron  offers this suggestion via Gawker:  urlLink Steal the yappy yappers' shoes  .  Now, while I could never actually do this, or really even recommend it to other people - that poor woman had to leave Central Park without a shoe (he he)- I admit that in my secret heart of hearts it made me glad to read that someone else did it. Now I feel avenged against the French smokers who sat on us and never stopped smoking or talking or eating or crinkling wrappers in our ears, or sitting on us for the whole time they were there. And I don't even mean that they were sitting so near that it felt like they were sitting on us. Frenchie was actually in Aaron's lap. Oh the humanity! So thank you, vigilante shoe stealer!

      I've said before that I think Librarians, as a group, are extremely obnoxious people. In a way, it's part of the job because we work for a radically liberal, potentially subversive public institution. And I mean liberal in the broadest sense of the word - that everyone, no matter who they are should have totally free access to all kinds of information. But we are also control freaks, because in order to have access to all this information, someone has to organize it. Which brings me to my new theory derived from Kendall Grant Clark's article on  urlLink how to arrange your home library according to the Library of Congress cataloging rules:  Librarians are irritating in exactly the same way that Martha Stewart is irritating.  I am simultaneously attracted and repelled by the ideas in this article. If I had 1000 books I would probably want to organize them in some way. But I don't buy books- that's what Libraries are for. I admit to playing Library with my books as a child, and even as a high school teacher before I learned the beautiful intricacies of the Dewey Decimal system in Library school. And I do think it's a beautiful system, but I don't want to be that horrible obnoxious Martha Stewart type Librarian that has to have everything rigidly in place. Library systems don't work that neatly anyway; they should be tailored for the user if they can be. So this is why I am not cataloging my home library.  But I'd be happy to come do yours if you want!

      Ok, I've taken  urlLink  Teachout's test   and I scored 53%. But now I want to compare my answers with  urlLink Aaron's   to find our cultural concurrence quotient. (40%) I'm also interested in the idea of  urlLink  immutables , but I don't think I really agree with them or with the TCCI. I used to think that chocolate would be an immutable for me, but it isn't. Aaron doesn't like chocolate, but we are still able to sustain a happy relationship. He doesn't finish my dessert and I don't finish his (but maybe sometimes I try it). He likes opera; I like ballet. All that has really meant for us is that since we met, he has seen more ballet and I have seen and heard more opera than ever before. Our cultural differences have added much more to our lives than 100% concurrence would. That said, here are my results, and I'm working on a test of my own - because I truly have nothing better to do.  1. Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly? Astaire 2. The Great Gatsby or The Sun Also Rises ? The Great Gatsby 3. Count Basie or Duke Ellington? Duke 4. Cats or dogs? Cats 5. Matisse or Picasso? Matisse 6. Yeats or Eliot? Eliot 7. Buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin? Chaplin 8.

      Well, I've finished my summer poncho, and Aaron sweetly says it's pretty, but I think it's kind of strange. It was okay until I had to sew the two pieces together. I had a frustrating few hours where I tried to figure out how they were supposed to fit together, sewed it up, and then it turned out kind of mishapen.   Anyway, I'm trying to get over it and have started my next project, this  urlLink  Summer in the City Tank . It looks simple except for the crocheted straps, which if they frustrate me, I can just sew on some ribbon straps instead. I found some really really beautiful yarn on Ebay. It's a dusty pink hand washable 70% Viscose/30% Linen blend from Classic Elite called Studio. It is dreamy to knit with and I'm using a double strand on 10 1/2 needles. Knitting was definitely easier when all I was making were scarves and baby hats, but hopefully I'll get to the point where these projects don't seem so daunting at the finishing stage.

      At last a Spiderman movie worthy of Toby Maguire, the thinking woman's sex symbol. I was really bored watching the first Spiderman movie and didn't have a burning desire to see this one, but when Aaron says, "Do you want to go see Spiderman 2?" I know the right answer is "Yes."  Let it not be said that I won't go see action movies with my boyfriend - at least ones starring Toby Maguire. . . hmm, Toby Maguire  Anyway, about the movie. It's fantastic! The first five minutes were smarter, cooler, funnier and more exciting than anything in the first movie. I think we have Michael Chabon to thank for that. Having read his Summerland, I could discern the Chabon sense of humor throughout the movie. And of course, Toby Maguire is perfect at conveying the hilarious irony of his situation. Alfred Molina was so sincere as the mad scientist with the freak show arms, you never really stop feeling sympathy for him even as he is clomping around causing chaos in the streets. Aaron thinks the computer graphics were not realistic enough, but that didn't bother me. I loved flipping and flying over Manhattan with my fake Spidey. The only parts of the movie I didn't like were the scenes with Kirsten Dunst. Maybe it wasn't her fault her character was so irritating. Maybe we also have Chabon to thank for that because I don't think he writes women very well.  But I can't help thinking that someone else could have played her character better (maybe Katie Holmes or Alexis Bledel). I think either one of these women would have been better at convincing me that they actually wanted to kiss Peter Parker. Dunst's MJ just comes off as whiny and self-righteous because he has disappointed her but not because she is achingly in love with him as he obviously is with her. But it's not her fairy tale; it's his, so I guess I don't need to believe that she actually loves him - it's enough that they kiss.  Which brings me to the  urlLink  ethics  of Spidey's choices. I won't comment on it but it's fun to read intelligent boys talking about the theme of a movie where the wimpy intelligent boy becomes miraculously strong and gets to kiss Kirsten Dunst. As if it weren't a fairy tale.

      Reading Lolita in Tehran by Azar Nafisi      I really wanted to like this book; it seems like the sort of book a liberal feminist in America should like, but I am returning it to the library unfinished. Maybe it's because I haven't read Lolita and maybe I should. Maybe I would like the chapter on Jane Austen better. "It is a truth universally acknowledged that a Muslim man, regardless of his fortune, must be in want of a nine-year-old virgin wife." No, I feel like I took this class already when I was at Douglass.  Fashionista by Lynn Messina    The sort of book an English major should hate. I don't hate it, but it too is going back unfinished. I just couldn't get myself to care about the exaggerrated intrigues and seductions  that go on at Fashionista magazine.  How to Survive Without a Salary: Learning how to Live the Conserver Lifestyle by Charles Long     Since I must survive for the next two months without a salary. . . the first thing to do is make a budget.  various dated home decorating magazines from the recycling pile  The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents by Terry Pratchett The Tale of Despereaux by Kate DiCamillo      My young adult reading seems to have a mice and rat theme. Hmm. Well, these two books are both really good.
