      Jaclyn and I went to go see Notebook. That is by far the most greatest movie in the world. Chick Flick wise. The guy that plays Noah is so dreamy. He's in Remember the Titans too. But anyway, Jay and I are going to buy the movie when it comes out on video. I think we're going to have another Simon Bitch episode. Well Magan just happened to be at the theatre so afterwards we decided to go to Denny's. Nick showed up by himself and we all chilled for a while. Magan and Jaclyn left around 10 and 11pm. But Nick and I decided to pull an all nighter. We were there until about 2:30pm until Brandon called, saying that we got a 20 pack. So we chilled at Brandon's until about 3am. Nick and I went to QT to get a carton of Luckies. Omg that was no Quick Trip. We were there for at least a 1/2 hour trying to rounge up enough money just to get the cardon. We were about 4 bucks short. We tried everything. We tried all of the credit cards in our wallets, we counted all of our change. Finally we got a cardon! Since I payed for 1/2 of it of course I got a pack. You owe me Nick. Big time. We chilled at Nick's house until Johnnny and Scotty got back from some place in the middle of Bummble Fuck. I saw David. He looks really great and he's doing really good. I'm proud of him. Nick got a new kitten. It's soooooo cute. He has thumbs. It's weird. We went back to Denny's at like maybe 4am. Hungout with Scotty and Johnny and some beasts showed up, but those chicks left early. lol Scotty and Johnny were talking so much shit about them. Nick and I got tired so we left Johnny and Scotty and went home....what a night. I guess that all nighter never worked out.

      VIVA LA MEXICO!  Lets start from the very beginning. The ride there was pretty nice, it wasnt as bad as I thought it would be. We sang the whole way there. Classics mostly. And Taylor insisted on playing Yellowcard the whole way there. When we finally got there the first stop we made was at a liquor store. We got 6 bottles of vodka. We were originally suppose to stay at the Fiesta De Cortez but when we got there it looked like shit. The pictures on the internet were false advertisement. We decided to go to the other side of the ocean where my family usually stays. We ended up staying at the Las Gaviotas. Which was faackin awesome! Our facial expressions were so drastic from the first hotel to the second. The view was beautiful. Something you'd think you'd only see in movies. And the water was warm as all hell. Alright past all this boring shit. The only thing that sucked about that hotel was those damn stairs. We went straight to the beach and in the ocean. We shopped around a bit. Ate food. DIDNT DRINK THE WATER! "whacha doin? eatin chocolate. where's you get it? from your dog."

      This will be my last and final entry before I go off onto my wonderous journey to Mexico. Where I will explore many seneries and be introduced to many different cultures. Awww I can hear it now, the waves in the ocean the birds in the sky.....I'm just kidding I'm going to Mexico to have a kick ass time with my family and friends. Party all night and tan all day. I'll be back on Saturday night. Everyones packing right now. I'm done already. Jakes home today too. I'm so stoked because he's coming with us. This is going to be faackin sweet.  Miguel will be on his way back home to Sacrameto, California by the time I'll be home. So we're going to hangout today. We got pretty close working together for those few months. I'm going to miss that kid. I hope Magan agrees to stop by his house when we go on that road trip across Cali in December. Considering what they went through. Because no matter what I'm going to come visit him when we go. Jesse and Ryan are leaving to Nor Cal this week too. Which sucks because I'm most deffinatly going to miss those guys. Now those were some good times. I know we're going to see them again when we visit Randy in December. I hope that dont forget me. But I'll still them fuckers. Well, off to help my mom pack.

      You know who I havent been so close with lately? The twins. We were like best friends. We had our party scene together. But it seems like ever since we havent been partying so much anymore. We drifted apart. I love Heather and Magan. I dont want to stop hanging out with them just because all of our UTI buddies are leaving. And I dont want to say that we only hungout because of the drinking. Because that totally wasnt it. I really like hanging out with them. But ever since we all got jobs its been harder to see eachother. Heather told me that I've been the one thats been distant lately. I hope thats not what they really think. I still want to be best friends with them. Best friends forever right? Well, I'm scared that Jr. year we wont be as good as friends. I really dont want that. Oh, speaking of Heather and Magan. Magan just called to ask for my livejournal website thing. Well, that means that shes going to read this. Uhh thats going to be kind of awkward. Well, Magan yes I miss hanging out with you. Summer almost over and its deffinalty not what I expected. I expected all of us to hangout everyday. But thats not what happened. For the rest of the summer we should make it happen. What happened to Heather, Magan and Alicia Best Friends? We need to hangout more. Luv ya guys       later

      Today Jaclyn got her truck back so our plan was to drive all day. And when I say all day I mean ALL DAY. At 2pm we went to find a bank because yesturday Connor and Randy wouldnt let me cash my check so I had to do it today. We went to Monicas house to drop off the pictures from her birthday. By the way those are total black mail pictures of all of us. Jacob Brown was there so we hungout for awhile. Jacob wanted to go to Brads appartment so Jaclyn and I went with him to chill with Brad until Brad had to go to work. We drove Brad to work. Jaclyn decided to go see Connor before we made our last stop at home. I watched them makeout for awhile until Connor kicked us out because he had to go to karate. KKKKAAARAAATE. vooto chop!! Now we're both at home and it's 8pm. Benji is getting neutered tomorrow. So Ocsar cant hump her anymore. Fuckin biatchah. Jaclyn is driving me to the vet at 7 in the morning. What a friend. The vet is all the way at 1610 e. Bell rd. later

      I just got done making reservations at the hotel we're staying at when we go to Mexico. It's really nice. It's called Fiesta De Cortez. I dont like that its on the other side of the ocean where me and my parents usually go. But at the hotel theres a place where you can rent quauds. So all of us girls are going to have so much fun riding around on those quauds everywhere. Sara, Jaclyn, and Taylor are coming with me. I'm glad everyone I chose to go is actually coming. Well, we're still not sure if Jay is going. But if she doesnt its ok we'll being her some gifts or something. But Taylor is hella fun so if we're ever bored there she'll deffinatly find something fun for us to do. I can't stop smiling I'm seriously really excited. Mostly because I know I'm going to have fun with my friends.....well actually its because of the quauds, but lets just say I'm excited cuz of my friends. wink wink. I think I'm more excited then the rest of the girls. Probably because they dont know how much fun we're actaully going to have. We're going with my parents and my 2 cousins. They probably think that we're going to have to hang with them the whole time. But we dont, we're probably only going to see my parents when we wake up and when we are hungry. Other then that, its like we're in Mexico by ourselves. The only thing that I'm worried about is that I wont have enough money to buy a new bathing suit. I mean Fathers Day is coming up and the twins birthday. I think all I have is 70 bucks. And I was planning on getting the twins something expensive. I'll just get my dad something first because he'll get butt hurt if his present is late. Sorry Heather and Magan but your present might be a little late. But I promise you'll like it.   I went bowling the other day with Connor, Jaclyn, Randy, Matt Graves and Katie. We first went to Connors to hear the guys play. Holy shit Connor and Randy are REALLY good at what they do. I mean they work really well off eachother. But sitting there listening to them play seriously blew me away. The songs they played were awesome and they wrote it themselves. WOW! Well, hanging with all of them was fun. We should do it again sometime. But no more bowling. The shoes smell. I'm off to work later.

       I woke up thinking about Wes today. I'm not sure why. Things that have been happening today just have been reminding me about him. It's not that I dont want to think about him. It's that I'm scared. I still cant believe he's gone. I dont want to think about him anymore, but yet not a&nbsp;day goes by that I dont say his name. I called Jaclyn and Sara to see if they wanted to go visit him at the Phoenix Memorial....they didnt answer. I havent been to the cemetery since his funeral. If I had a  car " STYLE="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: medium solid green;" HREF="http://search.targetwords.com/u.search?x=5977|1||||cars|AA1VDw">car  I would be there everyday. But then again I'm scared once again to think about him let alone visit him.I want him back. I miss him. Why? Wes why? Why did you have to die. It was too soon. I didnt even get to say goodbye. No one did. Weeks and weeks I cried. Who am I kidding, till this day I cry. Everyday that I pass that street, that house. I look up at the sky and say your name, hoping that your looking back at me. I have so much to say about you, so much to say to you. But it's too late now. I'll never see you again. I wake myself up from nightmares sometimes. All I see is you lying there, burning. But not feeling a thing. Not knowing that you'll never breathe again not knowing that you'll never feel the love that we all had for you. I have images of what really happened that night. Why did you even pick up that gun. You had everything to live for. You left all of us behind. Wondering why. I'll I can say is that I miss you.....I love you. I had never felt so much pain as the day I found out. I know forever I'll still be feeling the pain of emptyness. Since then, I honestly dont care if I die tomorrow. You made me think about life. About why I'm here. And so far I cant find a reason. I wish it was me Wes. I didn't want you to feel any pain. But I know you did. I want to write so much, but I cant think anything to say. All thats going through my head right now is what you were thinking. I just want to know why. That's a question that will never be answered. I know your watching over me. I feel it once again. Its overwhelming me.Your spirits like a wind. An angel guarding me.

      Saturday, Taylors 16th birthday party. It was fun. She got a puppy which made me hella jealous, because I know that my parents would never ever do that for me. Her dad really loves her, she's lucky. Most of the time we were at Taylors party we were trying to figure out how we were going to get to another party later that night. It really didn't seem like Heather and Magan were trying to help find a ride for Taylor, Dani, Monica, and Sandra. I told Taylor that once I got ot jay's I would do my best to find them a ride to Happy Valley (where the party was.) I'm glad that Magan finally agreed that she would take them because honestly I didn't think I would find them a ride. I'm glad they went though. Sandra was halairrious. Kissing everyone, talking to anyone who had a pulse. Ha Ha. She made out with Josh. I cant believe that. I mean not even 20 minutes before him and I were kissing. Which I do feel really bad for, Because he has a girlfriend and a baby on the way. I met Josh a long time ago at Jay's party. I thought he was really hot. I should have tried to get with him then. I heard him talking to this girl when I was walking passed (they were drunk so of course they were talking loud.) Well, Josh was saying how he thought I was cute and the girl he was talking to said "then why dont you go talk to her." So he did. That when I we started kissing. I was drunk, I wasn't thinking about his girlfriend. All I was thinking about was "hey, theres a tougne in my mouth."lol Sawyer and laura came with Dragon and Matt. Brad and Danny showed up too. They brought Jerry. Which was totally one of the hundreds that was getting hit on by Sandra. Yes, I still like Brad. And I was getting totally jealous when he kept talking to Magan. I know Magan would never date him, but I dont want it to be because of me. So Magan if you like him then go for it. I dont want to stand between you and a guy that doesnt seem to like me. Because at work yeah he flirts with me, but once we hangout together and he's around my friends he goes to them. So Magan if your feelin him, then go for it. Yeah I still like like him, but whatever. Anyway back to the party. I was looking for the bathroom so I asked these guys that were sitting on the couch. One says to me "yeah its outside to the left." and starts laughing with his friend. So I just turn around and see the guy that lives there and asked him. He was nice enough to guide me there. But when I was coming back I had to pass those guys again. There were people coming in so I stood there waiting for them to get through so I could get back outside. While I was standing there I could hear the guys talking shit about me, loud and clear. They were saying "hey fat bitch did you find the shitter." I didnt want to turn around so I just had to stand there listening while I had to wait my turn to get outside because of all the people that were coming in. I hate people like that. That think they could say what they want. But people like me who dont do anything about are the ones that let them....fuckers.I was also called a bitch because I was changing the music, appearently some girls done like Pantera. Weird girls. Jesus, a guy I met at the party that looked exactly like the guy thats from Super Troopers. The one that says "the snauz berries taste like snauz berries." Ha Ha. He was awesome At first he was all over Dani D. Then by the end of the party I saw him and Monica hooking up in the bed room. I dont know what that was all about but "hell yeah" Monica. The party was pretty big, and it was a blast. Once it started dying down, we all jumped into Dannys truck and went to another one. I went in Dragons car so I could help Dani D out because she was drunk as fuck. But once we got there the cops had already busted it. Brad said that he saw Lee, so I'm sure other people that I knew were there. So we found another party all the was over at 36th street in bumble fuck. On the way over there Dragon had to make a pit stop because Dani D. was puking. I had to hold her hair up while she was puking in the fountain. I hope shes doing fine now, cuz she was pretty gone after that first party. I ended up staying at Brads house. Danny and I got stuck in the back of the truck while Magan and Laura got front with Brad. But its ok because I got to spend time with Danny. I learned alot about him. Alot of questions were answered that night. Some of the things he told made me think. Well yeah, I'm babbling on. I should probably go take a shower now becuase once Magan gets off work I'm going with her to Jay's brothers going away party.   later

      I'm back again. 3rd entry in just a few hours and still nothing has happened. I should probably go take a shower, I have to get to work by 5pm and its already 3pm. Buuut I dont feel like it. I rather sit here by myself and stare blaintly at this computer screen. Because well my husband could be signing onto his friends name on AIM any time soon. Yes Jaclyn and Sara you know who I'm talking about. It's too bad that I've only met my husband once. At my house. I talked to him...well I asked him if he wanted anything to drink. I'll never forget what came out of that beautiful mouth.He said  "no."  awww I dont know if it was just me but I certainly think that we had a moment there. Don't deny it Sara you saw those sparks fly between me and him. You know, you were there. We will meet again my prince....lol   Is it animal cruelty if you tape a hot dog to your dogs back? A question Sara and I have been longing to find the answer too. I mean my dog ended up getting the food once he finally thought to just roll over and have the hot dog just fall off. But no he continued to naw at it for awhile. We actually video taped it once. It was pretty funny. I mean it wouldn't be animal cruelty because he got a treat afterwards...the hot dog.   Sara remember that one day when all we did was yell at eathother. I mean we weren't angry, we just felt like screaming. That was the day we also added  "ness"  to everything we said. That was wricked-NESS. Or that time when we were dodging everything my bro was throwing at us in my room. Remote controls, batteries, pennies. My mom didn't come in until he threw the remote and it shattered against the wall. She didn't yell at my bro for fuckin with us and briusing us with those damn pennies or for us being too loud, she yelled at us because he broke the remote and now she couldn't watch TV.   Well, I'm off to take a shower.

      It's only been maybe a few hours since I did my last Blog. I'm going to tell you a story but I wont use the real names : My friend Jenny likes this guy, well actually I'm not exactly sure if she "likes" him. She says she wouldn't mind if something happened between them. She just want's a boyfriend, I know thats all it is. Mike is giving her attention so she's saying to herself "eh, I'll setting with him." But maybe that's not the best idea. I mean Mike has given her problems before. And he talks about other girls all the time and she tells me that she gets jealous. I mean who wouldn't. She knows who Mike is linked to, Craig. Craig is one of Jenny's best guy friends. And he's dying to be with Jenny. What would he have to say about this? I mean Craig has major jealousy issues. And he's somewhat friends with Mike. Would you dating Mike hurt Craig? Or could it finally get the point across that you don't want to be with Craig? Something to think about...

        Well well well where do I start. Um not sure. So I guess I'll talk about what I have done today. Well I went to bed at 3 because I was up with Jaclyn trying to take care of some business on the computer. This morning I was sound asleep off in my perfect dream with Shia Labeouf. Next thing I know Sara is sitting on me. She woke me up at 11am. IN THE SUMMER TIME! I always wonder how that girl ends up at my house all the time...eating my food, wearing my clothes, talking to my parents about me. Damn her. Leave! I'm only kidding Sara. Your my best friend. You know I don't mind that you come over all the time without asking, talk about my parents like their your parents....eat my food....wear my clothes...ok dammit Sara you gotta go. lol But anyway back to what I did so far today. After Sara woke me up I uh...went back to sleep. She tried to bribe me with sandwiches to stay up with her. Then finally when I got up...she was leaving. Whats that all about? You wake me up to tell me your leaving when I didn't even know you were at my house, that's crap. Well, I'm probably going to hang out with her today. So I'll have more shit to talk about next time I write in this BLOG thing. Which by the way is a stupid ass name. It should have been named Live Journal ..or something not as stupid.

      Partying used to be the thing to do every weekend. I'd sit back and talk with my friends about how fucked up and wasted we were going to get that weekend. Drugs used to be the thing to do also. But I didnt totally get into drugs....thankfully. I look back and see how I would always complain about my dads habits with drinking and my big brothers habits with...basically fucking up. I hated it so much. I always thought "why couldnt they just stop, its so stupid." But then again..I was doing the same thing. I lied to my parents every night. I would fight with them too, all the time. I made stupid choices. And I lost friendships...I dont do it as much anymore. Party that is. I guess its probably because all of my party friends moved. Going to parties and getting "fucked up" just isnt really the thing I looked forward in doing every weekend anymore. It just got boring I guess. It's not "cool" anymore or whatever. Plus doing those things I hurt a lot of people. I'm not saying that I'm never going to go to another party again. I'm just saying that its no longer "the thing to do." Honestly, I dont know what I'm saying...leave a comment.  -later

      The Warped Tour wasnt the best. I mean the line up sucked and I'm not really into that kind of music anymore. The few bands that I went there for, I missed. I was extremlely bummed that I missed The Vandels and Guttermouth. Because I didnt spend 30 bucks to go faackin see some pansy band like Yellowcard or New Found Glory. I had to wait until 6pm for the next good band to play. Anti-Flag and Flogging Molly are the only bands I wanted to see other then the two I missed. So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I had a pretty shitty time and that was a total waste of money. I'll stick to local shows. It was cool that I got to hang out with some of my friends. I mostly hungout with Jacob. Which was cool because we got to catch up on old times. I also found out that he really liked Monica. Which is a good thing....but some dont think it is. I saw Johnny and Robert too. I gave Johnny my water. Which was a stupid thing to do because I got really thirsty. I got a Guttermouth shirt and a sunburn for a suvenior.
