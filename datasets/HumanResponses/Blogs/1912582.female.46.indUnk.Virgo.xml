      Have I mentioned I hate Microsoft? No? Well, I hate Microsoft. I spent most of the day trying to find the error in my program only to find out a patch from Microsoft broke my stuff. I had to uninstall and reinstall. What a wasted and frustrating day. Thank you Microsoft.

      I am haunted by my own life!  I see scenes from my past and wonder when or where there come from. Often it's like it was someone elses life. Usually I end up remembering and think "Wow, I used to like that".

      Found a cool program. Still testing so "cool" may change in the future. The program is called iRATE and it reminds me a bit of LaunchCast. Unlike LaunchCast, iRATE works with most OS's. I gave up LaunchCast when I moved to Linux since they apparently are in bed with Bill Gates. iRATE plays "legal" music so I can get a little satisfaction from knowing that the RIAA isn't going to be able to blackmail me. Horray for free music!

      I think time is actually like a river. If you are standing on the bank of the river you see that the entire thing is there all in the now. But when you are in the river of time, it seems like your little bit is all that is now. The part upstream is the past and downstream is the future.

       urlLink Nigerians happiest, Americans 16th :   LONDON, Oct. 1 —  People in Latin America, Western Europe and North America are happier than their counterparts in Eastern Europe and Russia, according to a British study. An analysis of levels of happiness in more than 65 countries by the World Values Survey shows Nigeria has the highest percentage of happy people followed by Mexico, Venezuela, El Salvador and Puerto Rico, while Russia, Armenia and Romania have the fewest.                “NEW ZEALAND ranked 15 for overall satisfaction, the U.S. 16th, Australia 20th and Britain 24th — though Australia beats the other three for day-to-day happiness,” New Scientist magazine, which published the results, said on Wednesday.        But the weekly magazine said that factors that make people happy vary. Personal success, self-expression, pride, and a high sense of self-esteem are important in the United States.        “In Japan, on the other hand, it comes from fulfilling the expectations of your family, meeting your social responsibilities, self-discipline, cooperation and friendliness,” according to the magazine.              The survey is a worldwide investigation of sociocultural and political change conducted about every four years by an international network of social scientists. It includes questions about how happy people are and how satisfied they are with their lives.        It showed that average happiness has remained virtually the same in industrialized countries since World War Two, although incomes have risen.        The exception is Denmark, where people have become more satisfied with life over the last three decades.        Researchers believe the unchanging trend is linked to consumerism.        “Survey after survey has shown that the desire for material goods, which has increased hand in hand with average income, is a happiness suppressant,” the magazine added.

I want to live in a cave and skin lizards. lol.   I saw on the news before that some guy was arrested because he was living in a cave. Seems it was a state park or something and it was illegal for him to live there. *sigh*

      "' The liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the  growth of private power to the point where it becomes stronger than the  democratic state itself. That in its essence is fascism - ownership of  government by an individual, by a group or any controlling private power.  ' President Franklin Delano Roosevelt   The statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon the nation  that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those  conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse to examine any  refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince himself that  the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep he enjoys after  this process of grotesque self-deception. Mark Twain, 'The Mysterious  Stranger' (1910)  'What kind of victory is it when someone is left defeated? What  difference does it make to the dead, the orphans, and the homeless, whether  the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or the  holy name of liberty and democracy. What is a war criminal? Was not war  itself a crime against God and humanity, and, therefore, were not all  those who sanctioned, engineered and conducted wars, war criminals? The  weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.  Non-cooperation with evil is a sacred duty.'  Gandhi"

      The battle between "good" and "evil" is a ruse of the "evil" side. By engaging in the battle, "good" becomes what it claims to fight against. It's like an eating contest between a glutten and a person who is fasting. The glutten will always win unless the other person becomes a glutten. "Evil" will always win the battle because by causing the battle, evil turns "good" into "evil" and has already won.

      One of the reasons I quit smoking was because I woke up on 4/6/04 couphing up blood. I kept couphing up blood for 3 days before I finally went to the hospital. When you have no money or insurance in America, you don't run to the doctor for ever little thing. After that I started going to Winding River Park to walk. I haven't walked much since I got married 18 years ago. Yesterday I went to the park as I often do. I made it to the 1.5 mile marker ths time before turning around. It was going to be a 3 mile day. Took me about an hour and 15 minutes. A bit slower than the 3-5 mph humans are suppose to walk. But I was enjoying my park time. One of Toms River's finest decided to stop me and ask me questions. Apparently he thought that just because I was odd and slow, I must be there to pick up Johns. *sigh* No, I go there to get away from humans, not find more. He talked to me for about 15 minutes. Seems people were complaining about the wierd person walking slowly through the park. I dunno, wasn't it always the person running through the woods who was suspected of wrong doing? Now it's the person enjoying a nice day in the park.  ----------------- 39 days, 8 hours, 12 minutes and 30 seconds smoke free.  1574 cigarettes not smoked.  $80.00 and 12 days of your life saved.

      I walked 4 miles ( 6.4 kilometre [km] ) today. A new record for my recent walking. I actually feel pretty good too. Just a little sore and tired. I want to walk the Appalachian Trail some day so I need to get used to walking. It's 2174.1 miles ( 3498.8 kilometre [km] ). I think that if I can walk at least 10 miles ( 16 kilometre [km] ) a day then I can leave from Maine in the late spring and get to southern Georgia sometimes in the fall.

As a result of the war, corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavour to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed." : Abraham Lincoln  = "The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the large centers has owned the government of the U.S. since the days of Andrew Jackson." : Franklin D.

        The bronchoscopy was quite an uncomfortable experience.   They gave me a shot of morphine in my shoulder. Then it was off for a ride in a wheelchair to the examine room. It was a scifi-looking place. Lots of monitors and things on telescoping arms around a chair. It would have fit in well on X Files. lol. The assistant was Amit Patel. He had a wonderful English accent.   They put one of those oxygen tubes in my nose.    Amit gave me some stuff to gargle with to numb my mouth and tongue. After I had done that, he got a device that looked a bit like those airbrush things. But the bottle had a clear liquid in it. He had me stick out my tongue and then he grabbed my tongue and held it. He then squirted that thing into my throat. It made me gag. He let me gag till I stopped and then did it again. By then my throat was starting to go numb.   Amit then put gauze over my eyes. He said it was to keep medicine from getting into my eyes but I think it was to keep me from seeing what they were doing. THen they put this thing in my mouth. I had to hold it with my teeth. It had a hole in it and they put the hose through that hole. I didn't feel much because of the numbing stuff.   After quite some time they finally removed the tube, the thing in my mouth and the gauze over my eyes. Then said they didn't find anything ;-)   Altogether we arrived at around 10:30am and got home around 4:00pm.   The morphine and whatever else they gave me made me fairly calm. I was told to not drive or make any important decisions for 24hours. But I was awake the entire time. They did not need to take a biopsy. My lungs were pretty boring ;-)

      Smoke Quiiting Journal from QuitNet --------------------- I went to Deborah Heart and Lung yesterday. The did the bronchoscopy on me. What a horrible experience. Not painful, just really uncomfortable and unpleasant. They numbed my mouth and throat, put me on oxygen and covered my eyes. They said the eye cover was to keep the numbing medicine out of them. But they didn't squirt any near my eyes. I think they just didn't want me to watch what they were doing. Anyway, the results were good. I'm not going to die today. I do have "Bilateral mild biapical emphysema" or "mild bilateral central lobar emphysema", depending on which page I read. The nodule is "Within the superior segment of the right lower lobe" and is 3mm x 4mm. And as a side note, they said I may have gallstones. Well, I've had trouble with my gall bladder all my life so that's no surprise. --------------------- 94 days, 18 hours, 38 minutes and 7 seconds smoke free. 3791 cigarettes not smoked. $950.00 and 28 days, 23 hours of my life saved!

The nodule in my lung is 4mm. The doctor doesn't seem to think it's anything to serious. As my parents always said, "We shall see". --------------------- Last weekend I walked 4 miles in 80 minutes.

						   Walked again today through Winding River Park. I took the lake loop twice. Measuring best I can on the map, it looks like I did 5 miles today. The loop is about 0.5 miles and I took it twice plus the regular 4 miles. I need something better for walking in. These boots were not made for walking. hehe. The Appalachian Trail is about 2,174 miles. sheesh. At 5 miles a day it would take me 435 days. I need to hit 6 miles a day or more if I intend to walk it in under a year. 12 if I want to walk to the end and back in a year.
