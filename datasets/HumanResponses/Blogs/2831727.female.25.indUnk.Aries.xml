      It snowed!!! It snowed!! It snowed!!!  It was so nice to wake up to a white apartment complex.  It would have been a whole lot nicer if my electricity hadn't gone out at 10:30 last night and if the skies were blue this morning. I guess all of my wishes couldn't come true.  Especially since I did have to go to work today. Yuck.  Plus I made the mistake of lowering my window on the passanger side to get rid of the snow.  Huge Mistake, bucause it wasn't snow it was ice and it came flying into my car.  I had to spend the next twenty minutes clearing the ice out of my car!!! Then I got stuck in traffic, which was ok, because I really deep down did not want to go to work.   I hope it snows again tonight.  I don't think it will, but it might!!

      Funny how in your head there is so much to say, and when you go to write it down, somehow its just not there?    Ok - I've got a topic.  Every year my family gives a scholarship to a student at UNO as part of the Foundation for my sister.  We would like to find a way to have more applicants to the scholarship and are brainstorming ideas of how to reach the UNO students.  The ideas that I have come up with are as follows  1. Use the UNO internet site.  If there isn't a scholarship site for UNO, find      some way to create one. 2. Each class or department has to have an internet program (like Learnlink at     Emory) where the teachers can post the application. 3. Attend departmental meetings for each major and minor and tell them     about the scholarship. 4. Post a flyer at the student center/library/every building on campus 5. Write an article for the school newspaper 6. Send a flyer to all of the student advisors.  Am I missing anything or are there any better options or ways to get a bigger applicant pool?  Please post or email me with ideas?    As you can probably tell, I'm a little bored at work.  I was extremely busy the last couple of days.  I even worked til 10 pm on Monday night, so today I haven't done a thing all day.  I've been internet searching, because I would like to find a way to get to DC in the next few weeks to visit Angele and Mandi!!!  I am so excited about visiting DC, if I can only speak to my boss who is in and out of her office all day today.  (Warning: Below is some good old fashioned whining in Lissy fashion.  You do not have to read)  Also on the note of what the hell am I going to do with my life - You know how I have thoughts of being a therapist.  I have serious doubts.  Today a coworker came into my office to bitch about her family and all I wanted to do was say get a life.  You can't control your family, you just have to role with the punches, otherwise you will keep getting frustrated with them for the rest of your life.  On the plus side, I said nothing and just nodded my head, so maybe I wouldn't be so bad at it.

      I hope that all of my friends have had a good Valentine's Day!!!  Mine was pretty interesting.  I went to a party with Angie and Lauren.  We were definately the cutest girls there.  We may also have been the youngest. Because I didn't have a Valentine I went shopping on Sunday and bought myself a new outfit!!!  I LOVE clothes.  On Sunday evening I went to dinner to celebrate Lauren's 23rd B-Day. I'm just sorry that I have work today, otherwise I could've stayed out to celebrate longer.      I'll try to post another entry this week, because today I have a headache and can't seem to think.

      I'm at work again.  Boo hoo.  I'm getting back into the swing of things after a very humourous weekend.  Saturday was my friend Gail's Birthday, so we went out on Friday to celebrate.  And where does Gail pick?  Could it be simply dinner and a drink? Nooooo!!! She picked a male stripclub!!!! I couldn't believe how funny it is to watch men strip nekid.  And of the six who went I was one of the three that had a good time!! (no I did not have a lap dance you naughty people).   Saturday I went out again, but this time only to sushi with Lauren and Angie.  I just love sushi, hmm but now I'm in the mood for Indian or Thai.  Yum.

      Hey Everyone -  I don't know if anyone is going to read this, but I decided that to start my own blog so that I can talk even more about myself :P  I am currently at work and as I always am doing, trying to figure my life out.  I'm trying to figure out what to do in my immediate future.  I know that I don't want to stay in my job (as a paralegal assistant), but I'm not sure what to do next.  I have so many ideas running around my head, I think I'm going to use this blog as my journal.  First is that I want to eventually move back to New Orleans, whether this means within the next few months or within the next few years.  I want to see what living in New Orleans is like as an adult.  It's scary to think of going back because I was unhappy living there in my last years of high school and none of my friends really live there anymore, so I'd be starting from scratch again.  Plus it's not like the economy is jumping in NO, so my opportunities will be limited.  On the other hand my family is there and I want to be near them.  So should I move back there, get some rinky dink job while I figure out what grad school I really want to go to? or should I stay at a job I don't love, but don't absolutely hate either? or should I apply to this program I just saw on the internet which would be an internship in London for a year?  Which brings me to my next thought process.  What career path do I want to follow next.  Options are, Psychology because there is this big part of me that wants to help people through their problems.  or Business school so that I learn about business because I have such a limited understanding and then try to find a job in the business world, like event planning or hotel management or advertising/pr.  Ok, I think that these are enough thoughts for now, plus I'm at work so I should get back to it now.

      I'm sorry that its been awhile.  Although who knows if anyone is actually reading this.  I returned from D.C. a lifetime age.     Washinton D.C.  I landed in D.C. around 10 pm where my friends Angele and Latorial picked me up.  Angele has been my friend since Kindergarten and I've known Latoria since my Junior year of High School.  We dropped off my suitcase at Angele's and then we went out in Georgetown.  I met the neatest people from New Zealand.  The were so much fun!!! I danced well into the morning with my new and old friends.  I didn't get to sleep til 4 or 5 am.  I had five hours of sleep. I woke up on Saturday aroun 9 am.  Angele's housemate Claudio (I think that is his name) cooked us breakfast.  We had crepes with nutella and jam, and homemade bread (not from a machine, but actually baked in an oven).  I spent the day visiting Angele's hangouts and friends and then visiting Georgetown with Latoria and her friend Alex.  I then had to take a quick nap and then was off to a party with Angele and her boyfriend.  The party was not so much fun, but then we left to go out where we met up with Latoria and had so much fun bouncing from one place to another.  I had so much fun, I did not even mind when my jean jacket got stolan :(  I got home around 5 am again. Sunday Angele and I woke up and had brunch around her house at this little hole in the wall that seriously had the best breakfast potatos.  She and I then drove around D.C., constantly changing our minds as to where we wanted to end up.  Finally we went to this cute little coffee shop where I found my favorite coffee drink.   Big Trains!!! For any of you that don't know what Big Trains are, they are my frozen coffee drinks I get in Colorado and at Chocolatte!!!  Angele and I then went to get hot dogs for an early dinner, and then I was driven to the airport.  I had such a fun time visiting with my friends and seeing D.C. from their perspectives.   I'm sorry that its taken me so long to post this, but work has gotten seriously busy.

      I just returned from a quick trip to New Orleans to visit the family and to host a bridal shower.  The shower went really well.  We had it the country club near my parent's house.  It was very simple.  The food and service was provided, so all we had to do was decorate and show up.  My cousin seemed to enjoy the shower and all the gifts she got.  By far, my gift was the most stylish!!!  The worst gift was of course from my crazy great Aunt Nanan (the one who has been hit by a car, not once, not twice, but three times). I spent my entire saturday looking for silver shoes to go with my bridesmaid's dress, since the ones picked out by my cousin were ugly, only to buy the ugly shoes.  I attended a friends wedding and found out another friend is moving to Atlanta, so I am excited!!! Monday, I went shopping yet again, but this time for clothes.  I currently have five new skirts!!!!! And have replaced my stolen jean jacket.  Today, I'm worn out and a little bummed.  The only bright spot is that I'm going to the Braves/Mets game tonight with Angie, Lauren and Courtney.  I'm excited about that.

      I know that it's been awhile since I've posted, but I've been extremely busy.  I have suddenly decided to make some changes in my life.  I decided I no longer want to work where I'm working and that I want to act young while I am young.   I have applied to the program that would let me live in London for one year!!!  I am going to be in New York for an interview over Memorial Day weekend!! I hope that everyone I know in New York will be there that weekend.  I have also decided to go to Steamboat for 6 weeks over the summer!! So if anyone wants to visit, there I'll be!!!    If I don't go to London in August, I don't know what I'll be doing, but I'll be doing something.  Maybe I'll do something zany.  Also next week is my cousin's wedding, so I'll be in New Orleans from tuesday May 18 to sunday May 23.  I'm going to be traveling a lot in the next three months.  Not that I'm not already going bonkers with all of my traveling already.  So far I've been to New Orleans twice and Washington DC once in the past 2 months.    I also want to congratulate Gail for graduating Law School.  She will be kicking other lawyers' asses in the future.
