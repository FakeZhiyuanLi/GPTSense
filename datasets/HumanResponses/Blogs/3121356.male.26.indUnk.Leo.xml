      A funny thing occured to me last week in the midst of yet another discussion regarding the marriage debate. Most of the people around me are straight, and they're totally "with us" on the marriage thing. The ones I've talked to are all for letting anyone marry any other adult and have that union recognized by the state. I, however, in spite of my usual state as the lone gay man in the room, was one of the few in the room to be against state recognition of gay marriage.  "But dude, if they're going to recognize one kind, they should recognize the other. It's an issue of equality."  Yeah, but I don't want marriage. For me or straight people. Well.... That's too strong. I'm all for marriage. I just don't think it's any of the government's business. We can all get married, regardless of our sexuality or who (or even how many!) is in the relationship. Hell, I could have a ceremony and marry my housemates' dogs if I felt like it. I don't, but I could have a ceremony and vows and rings and live happily ever after with anyone or anything I want, even myself.  Marriage is an issue of commitment. To those married folks in the audience, how many of you think your marriage, your commitment to your partner, would crumble if the state said, "You know what, we have no business here. Your marriage certificate, well... that's a bunch of bullshit." How many of you would walk right out on each other if the state no longer played a role in your relationship? There's probably only one or two relationships that would end if there were no lawyer fees in the way. Married folks don't stay married because the state sanctions their marriage. They do so out of love. And should they come to a point where they no longer love each other, the state will let them out of it anyway, if you pay a bunch of lawyer's fees.  Commitments don't require state recognition. They merely require the commitment of all involved. You can find examples in any city of gay couples who have been together for decades without a certificate from their state. Likewise, there are millions of "straight" folks who shack up for years without getting married.  The other snivel in the marriage debate is that there are so many contractual issues involved in marriage. The argument is that if us queers get our marriages recognized, we'll finally be able to have our partners as our heirs, they'll be allowed to make our medical decisions if we become vegetables, they'll be able to make the final decisions when we die. There's nothing stopping anyone from drawing up those type of contractual agreements individually. What about the money to pay the lawyer? We live in the information age. If you're that poor, go to the library and find out how to do it yourself. The contractual argument in regard to the marriage debate is simply an argument for laziness. "We want the government to be our one stop shop!" Fooey, I say!  What about taxes? Well, as a good, married, friend of mine told me once, "They don't call it the 'marriage penalty' for nothing."  The only equal recognition (aka "equal protection") we should be pushing for is the recognition that the state has no business whatsoever in our personal lives. Why do we get chills down our spine at the thought of POWs held in dog kennels in Cuba, John Ashcroft making a dossier on every single one of us, military tribunals, the "War on Terror TM," etc, etc, but we think nothing of registering with the state whenever we want to take our relationships to a certain level? Are we in the Soviet fucking Union? No. We're in the United fucking States of fucking America and we're supposed to be able to do whatever the fuck we want whenever we want to fucking do it! (Including using the word "fuck.") The government has no business in our bedrooms. They even finally admitted it. So when do we kick them out of the rest of the house?  Well, now that we're done with tonight's Libertarian Party convention, let's get on to the real reason I'm against this shit. I believe every word I said above, but there is a bigger reason I don't think we should be having the marriage debate right now.  We have bigger things to worry about right now.  TO ALL THE WELL-MEANING LIBERAL "STRAIGHT" AMERICANS OUT THERE ARGUING FOR "MY" RIGHT TO HAVE "MY KIND" OF MARRIAGE RECOGNIZED:  YOU ARE BEING SWINDLED BY THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION.  Haven't you stopped and asked yourself why we are suddenly having this debate? It came out of nowhere, didn't it?  IT'S A SMOKESCREEN STARTED BY GEORGE W BUSH.  He didn't start the debate, but he fanned its flames (ok, bad metaphor, but deal with it) by stating that he supports a federal constitutional amendment banning queer marriage. He blew the debate out of proportion. This was not unintentional.  While you're busy debating whether I should be "allowed" to get married, George W Bush & Company are allowed to continue pillaging the world on behalf of their corporate friends and themselves. While you're busy paying so much attention to the Supreme Court, the Executive Branch is executing some of the sickest foreign policy ever devised in our nation. While you're busy cheering on that gay coworker at the end of your row of cubicles, George W Bush is destroying our country.  I appreciate the thought, guys, but your thoughts would serve us all better if directed elsewhere.  In case you forgot, here's some of the things you should be worrying about:  -We, the bringers of freedom to the Middle East, are shutting down legitimate press outlets in Iraq for what amounts to sedition. -We are supporting rebels who wish to overthrow the democratically elected government of Venezuela (using Nixon and Kissinger's tactics of dealing with Chile in the 70s) in hopes of replacing their leftist leader with one more sympathetic to Bush's Reaganist politics. -We are sending billions of dollars in military aid each year to the country of Israel so they can continue their campaign of genocide against the Palestinians. -We are continuing to hold POWs in dog kennels in Cuba. They still have no legal counsel, no contacts with foreign diplomats or embassies, and their legal status as POWs has been denied by our government. -We are busily setting up a stranglehold in the former Soviet republics, most of which are still living under brutal totalitarianism. Our military and our oil companies now have a presence in every former Soviet republic. To say the least, Russia is not happy about NATO's expansion into Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania as they are not part of the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty, which essentially means that NATO can now place an unlimited number of forces in those countries right along the Russian border. This is the sort of thing the US would never stand for if the roles were reversed. -We have destroyed the most stable governments in the Middle East and Central Asia only to create absolute anarchy in their place. Iraq is now a cesspool of blood. Can you justify an unjustifiable war when you have to watch 18 year old boys being brutalized on television? WE ARE ALLOWING GEORGE W BUSH AND DICK CHENEY TO SEND 18 YEAR OLDS TO THEIR CERTAIN DEATH TO SUPPORT THEIR "RE"-ELECTION CAMPAIGN! -Our corporate media killed the campaign of the best hope our country has had for a political renaissance. Hopefully, the Doctor will be back in at a later date. -We have a sitting "president" that was not the winner of our last election. He does not deserve his job. We didn't choose him. The guy we did choose didn't even have the balls to stand up and take his rightful job. And what's to stop the Bush/Cheney monolith from doing it again? Not a goddamn thing, obviously. Hell, in most countries, there wouldn't be a question of again. In any other country, he'd be dead in the street or living in a prison right now. -President Clinton was impeached for a crime that is much less serious than any of the multitude of crimes "President" Bush has committed. Even President Nixon was impeached and forced to resign for less. -We are not educating our young. -We are not taking care of our elderly. -We are not building a world we will be proud to hand to our posterity. -We are killing the planet and enslaving her people.  There's a lot more, but in the above list, you should be able to find at least one thing that you find more important than the marriage issue. Don't let Bush keep smokescreening you! Marriage is not what's important now. We can already get married. Again, I appreciate the thought, but think about something else already.

      Here's the deal:  I needed a free site to write on that isn't a part of LiveJournal.  Thus, I give you  urlLink Sedition!   I hope to do a post a day dedicated to all things geopolitical and such and include links to sites I find interesting or useful.  I just threw up a couple of links over there to the right to hold space.  The list is by no means exhaustive, but it will grow. Check back often....

      I've taken some time to put up more links.  Now, before you ask, let me explain a couple of the links and their placement.  You'll notice there's an Enemies section.  In this section, amidst the obvious enemies like Ann Cunter -ahem- I mean Ann  Coulter  and the Republican National Committee, there are a couple of links that might make the less politically savvy among us scratch their heads.  The Democratic Leadership Council is the Clintonist, "Third Way" arm of the Democratic Party.  They're also one of the biggest reasons that the Democratic Party has no real platform.  The DLC has weakened the party's message by co-opting much of the Calvinist philosophy of Reaganist Republicans.  The DLC turned the Democratic Party into Republican Lite, and are thus included in my list of enemies.  If you would like a good example of the detriments of the "Third Way," check out how Tony Blair, Britain's "New Labour" Prime Minister has turned himself into George W Bush's lapdog.  Domestic examples would be Bill Clinton's signing on to Welfare "reform," "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," and telecom deregulation and every political action taken by Senator Joseph Lieberman.  Likewise with Terry McAuliffe, current Democratic National Committee Chairman.  He is also a part of this "Third Way" movement.  He represents the Republican wing of the Democratic Party.  The sooner he is gone, the sooner the Democratic Party can resume being a progressive, LIBERAL party.  Oh, hell.  I've gone and done it now.  I used the "L" word....

      The News Roundup is something I hope to do frequently on weekdays here on Sedition.  We'll see how it goes, but for now, here's some headlines that caught my attention this morning.  Clicking through  urlLink Yahoo! News  today, I found out that Chuck D of  urlLink Public Enemy  is now a co-host of a program on the new liberal radio network  urlLink Air America .  Unfortunately, those of us in the Seattle area won't be able to hear it on the radio, but we can  urlLink tune in online .  In Portland, OR, you can catch Air America at 620 on your AM dial on  urlLink KPOJ .  In other radio news, the  urlLink FCC  is continuing its campaign of censorship by threatening to fine  urlLink Clear Channel  for supposed violations committed by the  urlLink Howard Stern  show.  Can someone  urlLink get hold of Michael Powell  and ask where his sense of urgency is?  (Thank you FCC for using my tax money in such a useful manner.) Does anyone even listen to Howard Stern anymore?  Obviously not, since Clear Channel is bowing to the FCC and dropping Stern.  I'm not completely sure this is a bad thing, but even gay-bashing morons need entertainment.  This is America, goddamn it.  They should be allowed to continue chuckling at bukkake jokes on their way to work in the mornings without government intervention.  Like OM fucking G!   urlLink AOL is launching an Internet reality series .  It's sure to be a LOL riot!!!111  *Bangs head on desk.*   In today's "No Shit!" segment, Democratic presidential candidate  urlLink John Kerry  says, " urlLink This administration  has been gridlocked by its own ideology, its own arrogance."  Boy, I'm sure glad the corporate media killed the Dean candidacy so we can have a nominee on "the Left" who speaks  urlLink such bold truths .  Hail to the next Chief.  (Or perhaps "Meet the new boss, same as the old boss....")  With such sharp words to say about Bush & Company, I just can't imagine why  urlLink more people aren't supporting him instead of Bush .  Is it me or is there something frightening about  urlLink a Supreme Court justice barring freedom of the press ?  But then again, it is  urlLink Antonin Scalia  we're talking about.  If you're unfamiliar with this "man," take a look at his opinions on  urlLink state murder of criminals  (aka the "death penalty").   urlLink Bush discusses Iraq with foreign leaders .  "I been a baaaaaad boy...."  Oh, and thank God for the help of El Salvador and Poland!  Where would our "War on Terror TM" be without the mighty empires of El Salvador and Poland?  George W Bush:  The Foreign Policy Giant!  Our Dick is plunging into Asia!  No, not our metaphorical dick, as is usual.  It's  urlLink Vice President Dick Cheney !  He's going on a tour of Asian countries to beg them to keep helping us in our  urlLink illegal and immoral occupation of Iraq !  They've got to help us stay in Iraq!  51st state or bust!  And from Britain, where there actually is such thing as liberal media, a great editorial regarding  urlLink America's obsession with military might .   urlLink A great piece of reporting of conditions inside Iraq  by David Aaronovitch of  urlLink The Guardian .  We know the invasion and occupation are wrong, but he makes a good point:  What are we going to do for the Iraqis now that we've overthrown their government?  We need to do a lot more than simply handing the country over to Halliburton, Bechtel, and Unocal.

      In recent years, the American Left, or at least those willing to admit they're on the Left, has taken to calling themselves "progressives."  American conservatives succeeded in changing the image of the word "liberal" to the negative.  Over the years, ever since Nixon started the chants of "the Liberal Media," "liberal" itself has been remade into a derogation.  Any time an American conservative launches a tirade about the Left, you can bet it will include the label "liberal" many times over.  There's a funny thing about the American Left.  Liberals (progressives, if you must), as a rule, tend to be much more open-minded about just about everything.  We're more likely to try new things, to accept change, and to keep our ears open to other points of view.  These are all generally good qualities to have as they make living in harmony with the world and our fellow humans smoother and easier.  The down side to our open-mindedness, however, is that much of the American Left allows itself to be coerced into believing their view of the world is an incorrect one.  Take the Clinton era, for instance.  The American Left was so accustomed to being the underdog, they forgot how to lead.  We can all agree that, while themselves having numerous flaws, liberal leaders of the past such as Abraham Lincoln (GOP politicians say they're the Party of Lincoln quite often, but the name is the only similarity), Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, and John Kennedy were leaders.  Bill Clinton didn't even come close.  The Clinton era was one of co-opting.  We'd been out of power so long (realistically since the Johnson administration ended), once the Left finally succeeded in getting hold of the presidency again, it went about denying its liberal roots and started parrotting Reaganist ideology.  If the first President Bush was Reagan Lite, then President Clinton was a lite version of some weird love child between Jimmy Carter and George Bush.  President Clinton signed off on some of the most repugnant of Reaganist Republicanism, all the while saying it was a part of his DLC "Third Way" politics.  In reality, the Third Way involved dicing up the whole of the liberal basis of the Democratic platform, throwing out the bits that set flapping the jaws of the likes of Rush Limbaugh, and adopting many of the economic and social aims of American conservatives.  Sure, prominent Democrats are calling for fair labor standards to be part of future free trade agreements, but it was Bill Clinton who got the ball rolling with NAFTA and the WTO, all without the slightest concern for the labor practices now being clamored for.  Other laws and procedures that signaled a departure from traditional Democratic values Clinton signed off on included Welfare reform, "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" (which has resulted in an astounding increase in sexuality discrimination in the military), Telecommunications deregulation (which led to the current media concentration that allows the whole of corporate media to be run by a handful of corporations), and the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (which is allowing those behemoth media corporations to sue 12 year olds for music piracy).  The American Left stood by and let him get away with all of it.  He was supposed to be their man, but turned out quite the opposite.  After eight years, we still found ourselves loath to admit that we'd been suckered by one of our own.  Now don't get me wrong.  Before you get pissed off that I'm dissing our own personal Ronald Reagan, let me say this:  I like Bill Clinton.  Hell, I might even go so far as to say I love the guy.  Certain allowances have to be made simply for the fact that we're both from the south.  I've got family all around Hope, Arkansas, where Clinton was born.  I see all the things I like about southerners in Clinton and few of the things I don't.  He's got that same goofy charm so many southern men have, that goofiness that often masks the incredible intellect beneath it.  It's that same goofy charm that makes us love Jimmy Carter.  Like Carter, Clinton is an extremely intelligent man in possession of some serious political deftness and dexterity.  But the goofiness gets in the way of our ability to take him seriously.  What of the affairs?  The perjury?  The sexual harrassment claims?  The obvious lack of romance between Bill and Hillary?  Well, as I said, Clinton's a southern man.  Southern men are generally either utter prudes or absolute libertines.  Bubba falls into the latter category.  The southern libertine's view of what constitutes sexual harrassment and infidelity is a little looser than average.  As for the perjury, what man wouldn't lie when he's been caught, no matter how red-handed, cheating on his wife?  Besides, the Clinton marriage is one of convenience, of political necessity.  A president can't not have a wife, and the best career move for a female politician, given the circumstances, is standing by her adulterous man and coming out looking like a strong and dignified survivor.  You know, that real Oprah kind of shit we seem to get off on so much.  Suffice it to say, I like Clinton the man, but not Clinton the politician and eight-year head of the free world.  Clinton stood at a turning point in history, looked it square in the eye and made googly faces at it.  Unfortunately, it doesn't look like we'll be afforded a better option any time soon.  I support John Kerry's nomination for the presidency, but only because I have no other choice.  Kerry isn't George W Bush (or the increasingly freakish Ralph Nader), so he gets my vote this year.  It's the same reason I voted for Al Gore in 2000.  I don't care for him, but the enemy of my enemy is my friend, so to speak.  It seems that each time a candidate that could really do some good for this country stands up and asks for the Democratic nomination, the Democratic establishment and the media do all they can to tear them down.  I would have been ecstatic to have seen Bill Bradley debating the issues with George W Bush.  (And could you imagine the sociopolitical orgasm that could have ensued if it would have been a race between Bill Bradley and John McCain?  I mean, the best of both parties!  It would have been brilliant.  Alas, we Americans are generally not given to political brilliance.)  It was the same this year.  Out of ten total major candidates, there were people who had some great classic leftist ideals to offer us.  Dennis Kucinich and Carol Moseley Braun reminded us how we take care of each other is a much greater reflection of our society than our military prowess.  Al Sharpton, although the least serious contender in terms of a realistic shot at the presidency, provided the most timely and biting critique of the American Right out of any of the truly liberal candidates and served to remind us that although we're now fighting for an end to sexuality-based discrimination, racial prejudice and discrimination are still ongoing problems in our nation.  The rest of the numerous candidates this year were all somewhere in the middle of the political spectrum, but we didn't even get the best of those.  I don't mind that General Wesley Clark and Senator Joseph Lieberman were weeded out in short order.  They are the Republicans in our midst, pure DLC, through and through.  Dick Gephardt and John Edwards were the stock standard union candidates, the type that have some good things to say, but are only saying it to get union endorsements.  But then there's the Doctor.  I make no attempts to hide my outright support for Howard Dean.  Howard Dean has a perfect political balance from an ideological standpoint.  He's a social progressive and fiscal realist with a no-bullshit personality and a mouth like a pistol.  You'll also notice, if you take a look at the John Kerry and George W Bush websites, that Doctor Dean has reinvented modern political strategy while proving the Internet has come into its own as one of the most effective political tools available.  Howard Dean is a cult of personality the likes of which Democrats have so desperately needed for decades.  If it weren't for our corporate media, the Doctor would still be in and John Kerry would be headed back to his Senate office for a sulk and a strong drink with Ted Kennedy.  The Doctor was the best hope we had this year of getting this country back on track, but we let him get bogged down by all the media and even "our" own party establishment calling him a dirty liberal over and over again.  I guess it's not the Democrats' fault, really.  They were confused.  They haven't seen that much exposed brain matter since Teddy's older brother took that little ride through Dallas.  John Kerry...  Well, what can we say about John Kerry that he isn't already saying for himself?  Kerry is a clone of Al Gore wrapped in a blanket of Howard Dean slogans.  He looks like some weird genetic splicing of Jay Leno and that guy who played Lurch on the Addams Family.  The RNC is foaming at the mouth over him because his friendship with the aforementioned Kennedy (the fat drunk one, not the dead one) is to them as blood to a hound.  All the Democratic establishment could fault Dean for was his likelihood of being called a New England liberal by Bush and Cheney, and then they went and nominated someone who is friends with and from the same state as the Kennedys.  And we wonder why Bush swaggers and grins like an idiot all the time.  Well, why aside from the fact that he is an idiot...  The Democratic establishment and our corporate media have fucked us out of yet another great candidate all over fear of the L-word.  We have been done a grave disservice, once again, because of a negative PR campaign against the word "liberal."  We can sit back and blame the DNC or the corporate media or right-wing talk radio or Ann Coulter for wearing short skirts and keeping the hair bleach industry in motion; or we can look at who is really to blame.  You want that "Third Way" of supposed personal responsibility?  How about standing up and taking personal responsibility for allowing the word "liberal" to be negatively redefined?  How about for letting the unimaginable happen:  allowing conservatives to "outcool" us?  You know the Republicans have won some sort of PR battle when they've got Arnold Schwarzenegger's name recognition, Ann Coulter's legs, and Dennis Miller's big words.  The coolest, mouthiest, and prettiest people we can come up with are Arianna Huffington and Michael Moore.  Don't get me wrong, Mike is cool and mouthy, and Arianna is cool, pretty, AND mouthy, but compete with the Governator?  Will somebody please explain to the intellectual midgets over at the DNC that we do need some kind of pop culture cred to lead an as-of-yet superficial culture, just not the kind of bland superficiality they're currently serving up?  Have you learned nothing from the likes of Ronald Reagan and Jesse Ventura?  They had presence AND something to say, even, in the case of Reagan, if we didn't want to hear it.  We've got neither...  Something fundamental changed about the American Left, or at least about the general perception of it.  First off, most liberals in the media today sound like the people in that Saturday Night Live skit where they made fun of NPR.  We're boring!  Even when we've got interesting things to say, we say them in the most boring way possible.  Liberal became a dirty word because conservatives used it to describe people that opposed their worldview.  Whenever they used the word "liberal," it was attached to a derogation.  Social programs became the liberal welfare state.  Social consciousness became tax-and-spend liberalism.  Environmentalism became liberal anti-business policy.  Meanwhile, the Republican Party went from Nixonian homliness to Coulterish legginess and Schwarzeneggerish swagger, while the Democratic Party went from the grace of the Kennedys to the sedating effects of Gore and Kerry.  All the while, conservatives went about creating this myth of the spooky liberal hiding in every payroll office just waiting to steal your money and give it to some Welfare queen.  Inspiring fear and loathing in a third of the American populace is a good way to get another third of the populace to take you seriously.  The Republicans understand this.  That is why they wield so much power and influence in this nation.  How many times have you had a discussion with a fellow liberal about how frightening the worldview of the Bush administration is?  How many times did you hear conservatives say they were frightened of Bill Clinton while he was in office?  None but the most extreme of conservatives said anything at all about fearing Bill Clinton's version of the New World Order.  Perhaps that's because Bill Clinton wasn't as scary as George W Bush, but that's precisely my point.  Conservatives used to fear liberals, but they don't anymore.  What do they have to fear?  An American conservative being afraid of an American liberal is like a bodybuilder being afraid of a toothless old dog.  While they were busy building the myth of the spooky liberal, what were we doing?  We were helping them build that myth by distancing ourselves as far as possible from anything even remotely liberal, including the word itself.  Liberals and progressives let the conservatives win the war over the word "liberal" by surrendering it.  We abandoned the word itself, and with the word went the ideals.  Rather than standing up and defending ourselves, we admitted defeat without even daring to fight.  In abandoning the word and the ideals behind it, we unintentionally told conservatives that they had nothing to fear.  They didn't start calling us "wafflers" and "flip-floppers" for nothing.  Again, scare one third of the people and you'll have another third taking you seriously.  Conservatives deftly built the myth of the rabid liberal, liberals dodged the myth and started calling themselves "progressives," and then conservatives basically said, "See?  Toothless.  Nothing to worry about here.  Except a lack of leadership."  Well, I, for one, am proud to be a liberal.  I would like to see the word reclaimed.  Let's think about what the word liberal means, on its own.  It means being open, freeing yourself and others, embracing change, to let loose the hindrances that keep us from evolving as a society and as a culture.  Looking at the current American political landscape, the line between liberal and conservative is no longer the same as the line between Democrat and Republican.  Democrats are socially liberal and economically conservative.  Republicans are socially conservative and economically liberal.  Democrats generally support civil liberty but government moderation in economic affairs.  Republicans generally support economic liberty but government moderation in civil affairs.  Once we've taken the word liberal back, we'll have to decide how WE want to define the word, and I think I have just the definition.  Here's a few things we need to get into the Democratic platform post haste.  The federal government must ensure that all are free to live their lives as they choose so long as they harm none.  This includes aiding the elimination of discrimination based on sex, gender, religion, personal politics, age, sexuality, or any other aspects of our personal lives that have little to no bearing on our ability to function as productive members of society.  This does not mean that your conservative uncle has to see his tax dollars spent supporting baby killing and the the gold hot pants at the local gay pride parade.  It means that less of his tax dollars will go to those supposed Welfare queens and keeping gay people from touching each other.  Our government must ensure that all unnecessary barriers to free enterprise are eliminated.  The government must, however, provide oversight to ensure that all are free to do business as they please so long as they conduct business fairly and transparently.  Again, the government should ensure that all are free to engage in the business of their choosing, so long as they harm none (unless they choose to be harmed.  Sorry to all the anti-smokers out there for that dose of reality...).  This doesn't mean stifling business.  It means opening doors so that everyone has a chance to either go into business or to work for someone else without feeling they have to sacrifice their dignity and morality.  This means increased competition (which benefits the consumer by encouraging lower prices) and a happier, more productive workforce.  In addition to ensuring fair business practices within our own borders, our government should also demand fair labor and business practices overseas.  Our government should demand, as part of any and all trade agreements, that our free-trade partners are doing their part to ensure fair working conditions for their own citizens.  Our government should also mandate that any American company that employs workers outside our country abide by United States labor laws and minimum wage standards regardless of where their goods are produced.  Any companies that do not comply should be denied the ability to import those goods back into the United States.  If Nike wants to have its shoes manufactured in Indonesia, then they can damn well employ Indonesian ADULTS and pay them at least the US minimum wage.  Realistically, both sides win in this scenario.  Corporations still don't have to pay US union scale wages, but poor people around the world won't be working 16 hours every day to make a dollar.  Plus, $5 per hour would go a long way, in both personal terms and sociocultural terms, in countries like Indonesia, Honduras, and Lesotho (just to name a few countries off the tags of some clothes I have lying around).  This also does not mean stifling business.  Companies will still be able to save money by moving operations that most Americans don't want to participate in anyway to areas with cheaper labor markets.  This means, although our labor laws are quite lacking, our companies are treating people in other countries with at least the same amount of concern we demand they treat our people.  We must realign our foreign policy immediately.  Rather than propping up and destroying totalitarian regimes for economic gain, we should be encouraging the American ideal of republican democracy.  Rather than enslaving the world, we should be freeing it by encouraging reform.  We can best do this by reforming our own government and by shoring up our own equality, justice, and liberty.  Once we've done that, we should be encouraging every country in the world in a global transition to representative government.  Our economic and cultural ties to Europe, Japan, and South Korea should serve as a shining example of how beneficial to our own well-being the encouragement of democratic-republicanism and free markets is.  I've driven plenty of great Japanese cars. I use a Scandinavian phone everyday that runs on service from a German phone company.  My flat screen computer monitor from South Korea gives me the most beautiful picture when I'm watching movies.  We must make human rights a condition of receiving aid and assitance from the United States.  The economy and security of the United States will benefit significantly from the rejection of the Kissingerian and Reaganist styles of foreign policy.  Free peoples living under representative governments benefit from a better quality of life, higher productivity, increased ingenuity, more powerful and meaningful economic development, and control over their own destinies.  An increased standard of living in most of the world, fostered by the United States of America, will dramatically reduce our own risk of being bombed by rogue nations and attacked by terrorists.  It will also increase global demand for American goods and services.  Doing business in countries with stable governments decreases the risk of sudden closure of various markets due to pesky little things like revolutions and political unrest.  In addition to linking our foreign policy to the encouragement of democratic and economic reform, we must discontinue the practice of intervention by our intelligence service and military, unless specifically requested, either by individual governments or by the United Nations and NATO.  We cannot simply eradicate governments that don't agree with our politics.  We cannot continue to covertly aid the destruction of democratically elected governments, as the Bush administration is doing in Venezuela.  We have learned from the news reports out of Iraq that we cannot simply invade and depose despots who spout anti-American rhetoric.  We helped (and did most of the work to) create the United Nations for a reason.  There is a reason why individual nations are not supposed to be allowed to run off and go it alone.  It always results in tragedy.  Look at what happened in Germany.  Twice.  And look what's happening to us in Iraq.  We just wanted a fun TV show to distract us from Bush's horrible foreign and domestic policies.  Now our fun TV show has gone from "bombs over Baghdad" to all out chaos that would threaten to destabilize the entire region if the other Arab nations  weren't communicating with each other so effectively.  Speaking of the Middle East....  We must immediately review all arms sales to other nations.  Ideally, we should stop selling weaponry altogether.  We should be exporting our culture, our style of government (or the ideal, anyway), our goods, not our weaponry.  But seeing as how we can't just stop providing military aid to certain weaker nations, we should ensure those weapons are used solely for defensive purposes.  Israelis are using our helicopters and bombs and equipment to kill Palestinians and to flout international law.  Colombia is using our military assistance in the name of the drug war to stifle legitimate dissent in their country.  We provided technical assistance and combat training to mujahideen fighters in Afghanistan in the 1980s simply because we had the common bond of believing in god and a common enemy that didn't.  One of those fighters wound up creating an organization that is hell bent on destroying us by using that same faith and training against us.  We contribute to the instability in the world by filling it with high tech weaponry.  We must begin including clauses in international arms deals that give us the ability to personally monitor the use of our weaponry.  To do any less is completely irresponsible.  In our own country, we need to undertake a massive initiative that will take care of our declining infrastructure and environment while caring for a large chunk of our unemployment.  We must initiate new federal programs that give unemployed Americans the opportunity to make a living helping to rebuild our nation.  Our society would be well served keeping people off Welfare and employing them to improve the quality of life for every American.  The following is by no means an exhaustive list of projects our government should undertake immediately:  Using rural electrification as an example, we can and should build a national broadband Internet infrastructure that has the potential to affordably bring the digital revolution to every home in America.  We must undertake a massive overhaul of our transportation system.  Much of our interstate highway system is in disrepair.  Mass transit systems should be built in all metropolitan areas that do not already have them to reduce gridlock and petroleum consumption.  Amtrak should be overhauled and adequately funded to provide a true passenger rail sytem with a nationwide reach.  We must rebuild our electrical grid and shift our focus to renewable energy sources.  A new energy infrastructure must be built that is based on solar and wind power.  We must invest in technologies that will allow our cars to run on plant-based fuels, hydrogen, and responsibly generated electricity.  If we are to move from petroleum fueled cars to ones that are hydrogen fueled, we will need to invest in and build a national infrastructure of hydrogen filling stations, or to convert the current petroleum infrastructure to hydrogen.  We must set about creating an optional national health service to provide medical care to those who cannot afford it.  We cannot continue to put bandages on the national health by reworking existing programs.  Healthy people are more productive people, and productive people are good for our economy.  Our very moral fiber demands that we do this.  However, our regard for liberty and property should allow those who do not need or wish to participate the chance to opt out in exchange for a tax credit.  We must upgrade our labor standards.  Our national minimum wage must be set at what is required for the average American to support him- or herself.  We shouldn't set it any higher, but the amount should be reviewed each year to allow for an automatic cost of living increase.  More money in consumers' pockets means less to dole out at the Welfare line and more money in our economy.  We also should transition to the European model of a set amount of time off each year.  In many European countries, every employer is required to provide up to six weeks of paid time off per year.  While conservatives argue that this stifles business growth, the proof shows quite the contrary.  A workforce that is allowed to step back and relax once in a while is a more productive workforce.  Americans work harder than anyone else in the industrialized world, yet we produce less.  We must adopt the German model of universal college education.  Every American should have the opportunity to participate in higher education, regardless of economic situation.  We must also initiate true educational reform to improve our public K-12 schools.  A better educated society will be more productive and will be better able to adapt to and compete within our rapidly globalizing economy.  In short, we must untertake a broad set of new programs to ensure that everyone has the chance to build a better life.  We must stop misusing our ingenuity.  We must use it to build a better society and a better world.  In doing so, we will create a safer, more harmonious nation and we will lead the world by example rather than force.  If we take the time required to examine our national bureaucracies and expenditures, we can do all of the above, all while trimming our national debt, erasing the budget deficit, and still reducing the tax burden on the poor and working class.  And for the rest of you, wouldn't you give up those occassional $300 "Bush checks" to know you never have to worry about your insurance coverage or your kids' college funds or even sitting for two hours in traffic every morning?  Creating a better world for all is the cornerstone of liberalism.  The sooner we remember that, the sooner we'll be proud of ourselves again.  Once we're proud of ourselves again, we'll start producing political candidates that are true leaders, rather than poll-watching yes men.  It all goes in steps.  You want a better world?  You want to stop the Kissinger and Reagan worldviews in their tracks?  You want to look at George W Bush and say, "Never again, motherfucker"?  Then remember what we can do when we stand up and take pride in ourselves and our ideals.  We can do it.  It's been done before.  As one of our great leaders once said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."

      It's fine to read about what's going on in our nation and the world.  It's fine to get worked up over what's going on, but what good is your righteous indignation if you do nothing about it?  We can change our country and its political process for the better.  Things look hopeless at times, but our situation is only hopeless if we do nothing.  The following are some links that will help you get involved.  Unfortunately, Howard Dean's presidential campaign has ended, but his organization has evolved into a political action group.  Go  urlLink here  to read about Democracy For America.  Letter writing is an effective and efficient tool for encouraging political change.  It could take as little as 5 minutes to compose an email or letter to politicians, media personalities, or to your local newspaper.  Here are some links to contact information to get you started:     urlLink Democratic National Committee   urlLink John Kerry for President campaign   urlLink George W Bush "re"election campaign   urlLink Republican National Committee   urlLink "President" Bush   urlLink Dick Cheney   urlLink The White House   The  urlLink Democratic National Committee  provides a  urlLink tool  for use in finding contact information for local media and elected officials.  The DNC also provides a useful  urlLink tool for registering to vote .  If you aren't currently registered to vote, you should be.  If you are registered to vote, you should encourage friends and family to register, if they haven't already.  In fact, if you are interested in organizing and mobilizing a large group of voters, the service is run by a group called  urlLink Election Impact .  If you'd like to get involved in a party other than the  urlLink Democratic  or  urlLink Republican  parties, there are plenty out there to choose from.  The Republican party has the control, and, in the words of  urlLink Michael Moore , the Democratic Party is the lamest excuse for a party we've ever seen.   urlLink Politics1.com  provides an exhaustive  urlLink list of political parties  as well as descriptions and links to official websites.  Last, but definitely not least....  you can do what I'm doing.  Start your own weblog, online journal, or column on the Internet.  Get  your  views out there.  Personally, I recommend either  urlLink Blogger  or  urlLink LiveJournal .  There are, however,  urlLink tons of different sites and software  that will allow you to create a free online journal or weblog.

      We're stuck with Senator Lurch and Resident Bush for now, but  urlLink Jesse Ventura is mulling a run for President in 2008 .  "No party.  No nothing."  He's got my vote already.  I think he's one of the best politicians we've seen in a long time, if for nothing else but his plain-spoken, no bullshit manner, and his spot-on politics.  Since his breakout campaign for governor of Minnesota, he's had the exact politics the Democrats have so desperately been trying to find.

      Well, folks, it's been a while.  I've moved and I've resettled.  It's time to get back to the old blog.  I've worked out a format of sorts, and I'm hoping I'll be motivated enough to post new material every other weekday or so.  We'll see how it goes.  Without any further rambling, let's get started, shall we?    Update   President Bush's current approval rating:    47% approval, 49% disapproval  (Source:  CNN/USA Today/Gallup, 5/25/04)   Days left until the election:  153   Iraqi War casualties, to date:  Civilians reported killed by military intervention in Iraq: 9284-11147 (source: iraqbodycount.net)  American casualties to date: 4654 (source:  antiwar.com)    George W Bush:  Political Hell's Angel   On Memorial Day, while I was visiting with some friends, we watched a good chunk of the American Chopper marathon on the Discovery Channel.  They reran the episodes where the guys created a beautiful POW/MIA memorial bike.  As we were watching, we had many side conversations, several of which ran off, as they usually do between me and many of my friends, on a political bent.  A thought occurred to me when thinking about the biker stereotype.  Although most of them are actually big teddy bears when you get down to their real selves, the external image of a biker is tough, mean, and badass.  It occurred to me suddenly that the biker is the personification of the overall American attitude.  If you were to pick one type of person that embodies the spirit of our culture, you'd have to pick the biker.  When I said this to my friend, he looked a little puzzled.  I found it highly appropriate that a rally of bikers rode through the gates of the White House that very day.  The main ethos of most of the hardcore bikers I ever met can pretty much be summed up as follows:  I do what I want when I want to do it.  If you got anything to say about it, I'll stomp your ass.  This, in a nutshell, is pretty much the George W Bush foreign policy.  This is how America acts toward the rest of the world.  Forget calling W evil or stupid.  George conducts international relations as if he were the head of the Hell's Angels.  If you doubt this characterization, I recommend you read the book  Hell's Angels , by Hunter S Thompson.  He spent some considerable time with them in the mid-1960s.  He befriended them, hung out with them, got loaded with them, went on runs with them, and, eventually, they ended up beating the shit out of him.  This is not unlike the typical Republican adminstration all the way from Nixon to Reagan to Daddy Bush to Dubya.  We befriend those who seem to be on our side at the time.  You know, the old "the enemy of my enemy" philosophy.  We then hang out together, load them up on weapons, and get them drunk on our power.  But in the end, we always end up turning on them.  Then comes the stomping.  Saddam Hussein found that out.  So did the Taliban.  Toward the end of  Hell's Angels , Thompson makes it clear that he doesn't hold his beating against the bikers.  He knew all along that the risk was there.  He was smart and he knew what bikers are like.  He  expected  that he probably would get his ass kicked before the whole thing was over.  It was an analogous story to the old tale about the woman who finds a wounded rattlesnake on the side of the road.  She picks it up, takes it home, and nurses it back to health.  One day, she goes to pick up the snake and it bites her.  She falls to the floor, and as she's dying, she looks at the snake and asks why he would bite and kill her when she was so kind and saved his life.  The snake looked at the woman and said, "Look, bitch, you knew I was a snake when you picked me up."  I include that story for all of us who look on in disbelief at our "President."  The actions of the Bush II Administration are getting more and more surreal by the day.  But then, what did we expect?  Expecting decency out of a Republican president is like expecting a rattlesnake to not bite you.  Too bad people outside our country don't seem to be taking that same view.  But, it's a little harder to take the biker mentality when you're on the receiving end of it.  Of course, whereas Thompson's association with the Hell's Angels was voluntary, current Iraqi association with George W Bush is not.  Bush wanted a war.  Depending on which version of the story you listen to, either Dubya wanted to avenge the attempted murder of his father by Saddam Hussein or he felt his father had fucked up Gulf War I by not sending his troops all the way to Baghdad to collect Saddam's head.  The specific impetus is not important.  Let's not be coy here, though.  Things like oil and permanent military bases in the Middle East are just appealing little bonuses.  Saying that Dubya, as a Born Again Christian, believes he is the right-hand man of God Himself, and was selected by the Almighty to lead us at this exact moment in American history...  Well...  I can see it, but I don't completely buy it.    Being Commander-in-Chief of the United States military gives you an appalling ability to go whoop some ass.  As a nation, we have the ability to strike fear in the heart of anyone in the world.  This is because we can go kick anyone's ass we feel like and there's nothing much anyone can do about it.  Even Russia and China can't do much, in spite of their own weapons capabilities, because of how dependent they are on our economic relationships.  If you saw a burly biker kick the shit out of someone in a bar and then managed to ask him why without getting your own ass kicked, he'd probably answer, "Because I fuckin' can."  If you could get George W Bush to answer truthfully why he got us into the Iraqi war, I'd imagine he'd say much the same thing.  He's not evil.  He's certainly not a Hitler.  He's no more a Hitler than Saddam Hussein.  He's just got the ability to whoop ass at his disposal, and sees no reason why he should use restraint in applying that ability.  Sure, there are plenty of rich white men taking advantage, many of them working within the Bush administration itself, but I think a lot of us give old George too much credit....    Sedition!

      I've decided that the Recommended portion of yesterday's post should be its own daily feature.  I give you the Sedition! Spotlight.  Also:  I've enabled comments.  Now you can talk shit about what I post here and people will read it!  So go ahead and post your comments about how stupid I am for liking Michael Moore, ok?  ;)   Listen:     urlLink David Cross, It's Not Funny      (Photo courtesy of  urlLink bobanddavid.com )   My first introduction to David Cross was Mr Show, and I've liked him ever since.  My liking grew to love when I heard one of his stand up albums.  Cross is the successor to  urlLink Bill Hicks  we've been waiting for.   Meet:     urlLink George Soros  and the  urlLink Open Society Institute      (Photo courtesy of  urlLink soros.org )   George Soros is using his wealth to help defeat George W Bush this fall.  His organization also helps to build open and democratic governments in the former Soviet Union and in other nations around the world.   Play:     urlLink President Forever      (Photo courtesy of  urlLink hotpotsoftware.com )   I was looking online one day for a good political RPG, and I found out about this game during my Googling.  I got a chance to check out the demo, and it was good enough to make me wish I had a credit card to buy the game with.  You can choose to play as the candidate of one of four groups.  The Republicans have Bush, and you can choose from Cheney, Rice, or Powell as running mates.  You can also play as one of several of the Democratic candidates, from Kerry to Lieberman to Dean, and choose any of the others as a running mate.  You can opt to play as Nader for the independents, or you can go with the Libertarians' Gary Nolan (which is a bit out of date, as Nolan stepped out of the running for LP nominee, but that doesn't really matter as far as gameplay).  You can select everything from platform stances to when to create political ads, all while you and your running mate criss cross the map to shore up you support in the coming election.  In the full version, you also have the option to participate in the Bush/Clinton/Perot race of 1992, the Carter/Reagan race of 1980, or the Kennedy/Nixon race of 1960.  Oh, and it only costs $12.   Read:     urlLink  Kingdom of Fear , Hunter S Thompson      (Photo courtesy of  urlLink gonzo.org )   This book is sold as a memoir, and it serves well in that purpose, allowing us into the swirling, often insane, often brilliant mind of Hunter S Thompson.  It also contains some of the most honest chronicling of 9/11 and its immediate aftermath to have seen the light of day.  Thompson's rambling accounts of his feelings and reactions to 9/11 and Bush's attempted clampdown on the US afterward provides some of the only dissenting opinion from anyone with a national audience as it all went down.  Definitely one of my favorite books.   See:     urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11 ,  urlLink Michael Moore      (Photo courtesy of  urlLink michaelmoore.com )   The new Michael Moore movie is finally slated for distribution after winning the Palm d'Or at Cannes.  The trailer is now out and available online.   Surf:     urlLink     Now, I have the same feelings as that guy who set up the site  urlLink johnkerryisadouchebagbutimvotingforhimanyway.com , however....  It is absolutely imperative that we get rid of George W Bush this fall.  At this time, we must follow the lead of all the other candidates we might have supported and get behind John Kerry.  He may not be the one we want, but he's not George W Bush, and that's what's important now.  I urge you to take a look at the site, and volunteer in some way to help the campaign of our next president.  Bush is doing a good job on his own on helping out the Kerry campaign, but we can't settle for a mere plurality this fall.  This year's election is a referendum on the already crashing-and-burning Bush administration.  Bush is arguably the worst president in the history of the United States, and he must go down in a landslide.  We cannot rely on Kerry alone to provide that landslide.   Tune In:     urlLink Mike Webb ,  urlLink KIRO 710am, Seattle      (Graphic courtesy of  urlLink mikewebb.org )   Yes, I'm a dork.  So much so that I listen to AM talk radio much of the time I'm in a car.  It's funny though.  For all the whining about conservative domination of talk radio, there's one place that always seems to be running smart, snappy,  liberal  talkies:  710 KIRO, here in Seattle.  If you have a good enough antenna, you can catch KIRO as far away as Portland after dark, which is conveniently when my favorite talkie, Mike Webb, is on.  For one thing, it's awesome that there's a non-flaming, intelligent, respectable gay man on a mainstream radio station.  The best thing, however, is that Webb was one of the few people who has been bold enough to voice his honest opinions about the Bush administration and the "neo-con" stranglehold on America, even when it was unpopular (or even dangerous) to do so.  He has a no-bullshit view of American and global politics and affairs that, in my opinion, puts him in the same league as nationally-known folks like Arianna Huffington and Bill Maher.

       Sedition! Spotlight    Listen:     urlLink Definitive Jux     Looks like Murs and El-P are gettin' a little smokey.... (photo courtesy  urlLink definitivejux.net )  Love hip-hop, but can't stand all the regurgitated bullshit on the radio and MTV?  Def Jux puts out some of my favorite rap, all of which is done by intelligent people who have real talent.    Meet:     urlLink John McCain     (photo courtesy  urlLink mccain.senate.gov )  While I don't agree with him all the time, he's a great guy.  In my view, John McCain is one of the very few respectable and decent Republicans.  He's been one of the most outspoken GOP critics of the Bush administration since before it even began.    Read:     urlLink  The Adventures of the Imagination of Periphery Stowe , Josh Wagner     (photo courtesy  urlLink peripherystowe.org   This is a plug for a homeboy of mine, Josh Wagner.  He's spent years working on his book, and now it's out and available for anyone who'd like to purchase a copy.  I'd highly recommend it, even though, *ahem*, I haven't gotten to read it yet.  Josh is an amazing guy and his writing reflects that beautifully.    See:     urlLink Trekkies 2   While we're on the theme of plugging homeboys, my bestestest friend in the world is the frontman for one of the dorkiest, yet most badass, bands you'll ever hope to see.  The guys of Stovokor dress up like Star Trek Klingons and take the stage to play some of the most brutal and beautiful metal you're likely to hear.  Having developed a loyal following in their hometown of Portland, Oregon, they went on to participate in the filming of Trekkies 2, the sequel to the hugely popular documentary Trekkies, which documented the devotion of various Star Trek fanatics to their favorite show.  Stovokor is featured prominently in the film.  The promo site includes many pics, including some of Stovokor, other Trek-related bands, and even a Borg cat.    Surf:     urlLink     To get reliable news, Americans have to go to British sources.  We overthrew them to get our freedom, and now we have to run to them to keep it....    Watch:   urlLink Aqua Teen Hunger Force     (photo courtesy  urlLink filmforce.ign.com )  In looking at the ATHF section of the  urlLink Adult Swim  website, I realized I could never come up with as good an explanation for the show as they have:   First of all, they're not teens.  Secondly, there's no water involved.  The whole Hunger Force thing?  That's probably misleading, too.  In short, if you have to ask what "Aqua Teen Hunger Force" is about, it is probably not a show for you.  The rest of us will go on thrilling to the adventures of Frylock, Meatwad, and Master Shake as they, you know... hang out.

      "He had a lot to say.  He had a lot of nothing to say.  We'll miss him.  We're gonna miss him." - "Eulogy," by Tool   I wasn't planning on making a post this weekend, but I just signed on and read the news that President Reagan has died.  I was a bit surprised to find a few posts by friends of mine on  urlLink LiveJournal  wishing he'll rest in peace and things of that nature.  Call me an insensitive bastard, but this is not how I feel.  Over the course of the last few years, we've listened to George W Bush tell us about how he's trying to rid the world of many evil men.  He's had his sights set on Osama bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong-Il, and the ayatollahs of Iran.  When Saddam Hussein was captured, we were told it was a time for celebration.  We've found out since that Bush has kept the gun "The Dictator" was holding when he was dragged from a hole in the ground as a war trophy.  No matter the cause, we should feel a small amount of relief when a bad man dies or is yanked off the world stage.  Even though the means will never be justified by any ends of a conflict such as the present war in Iraq, we may still take some small amount of comfort when men like Saddam Hussein are finally out of power.  Today, we can take comfort that another very evil man is now dead.  Sure, he's been out of power in this country for 15 years now, but we are still mired in his legacy today.  Reagan helped sow the seeds of the bandwagon patriotism that surges every few years in our country.  Our current foreign policy would have gotten glowing approval from old Ronnie, had he not been a slobbering vegetable for the last several years.  In addition, to see where George W Bush got his ideas on how to run the world and our nation, one only has to look back to the 1980s.  Bush's style, that of throwing substance out the window in favor of hokey and empty symbolism, was lifted straight out of the Reagan era.  Now some feel that everyone is owed a fond farewell when they finally pass on.  We're supposed to let the past be the past and wish the departed all the best now that they're gone.  I say fuck that.  Ronald Reagan was a vicious liar who made Teddy Roosevelt look like a Sunday school teacher.  He laid the foundation or set the precedent for every horrible action taken by the current Bush administration to date.  We can thank Reagan for giving us elitist "supply-side" economics, the preemptive model of warfare, tax cut and spend budgets, and just about every other policy that is ruining our economy, culture, society, and relations with the international community.  When he was inaugurated, President Reagan spoke of a new beginning in our nation.  It was "morning in America," and the president painted a portrait of himself as the great leader we'd all been waiting for.  He promised to lead this nation, which was (and is) full of the most ingenious, creative, and hard working people in the world, into a new era.  The substance of what we got was much less pretty than the symbolism he presented.  One of the most deplorable men in American history is now dead.  With his passing, at least in some small measure, comes another new morning in America.   Heavy on style, light on substance, and filled with good old American arrogance, Reagan, while not alone, certainly led the effort to take over the world and reshape it in his own Corporate American image.  Today we are still digging our way out of the messes started under his watch.  If there's any justice in the universe, today is the first day of Ronald Reagan's new eternal job in Hell as Satan's official cocksucker.  He can now do literally what he did figuratively for most of his life.

       Sedition! Spotlight    Listen:   urlLink     With conservative domination of talk radio, a group of liberals decided it was time to start a liberal radio network.  Hosts include  urlLink Al Franken ,  urlLink Janeane Garofalo ,  urlLink Randi Rhodes ,  urlLink Chuck D , and Robert Kennedy, Jr.  There aren't very many affiliates yet, but you can  urlLink listen online .    Meet:   urlLink Shirin Ebadi     (Image source: sfgate.com)  Shirin Ebadi is an Iranian lawyer and human rights activist.  She was the first female judge in Iran before the revolution that overthrew the Shah and began the Shia theocracy that has ruled the country since.  Since then, she has worked as a lawyer and teaches at the University of Tehran.  She was recently awarded the Nobel Prize for her work for democratic reforms in Iran.    Read:   urlLink    (Image source: skippingtowardsgomorrah.com)  One of my favorite books.  Dan Savage takes a look at the seven deadly sins in America.  While conservatives are whining about the moral decline of our nation, Savage takes a tour of America and finds that, actually, the sinners aren't all that bad, and neither is the state of our nation.  His book is funny and insightful, as Dan Savage is apt to be in general.     See:   urlLink Donnie Darko  Director's Cut    (Image source: news.bbc.co.uk)  I finally saw Donnie Darko, after what?  Three or four years?  It was great, just as everyone and their mom said it was.  Now, the director's cut is being released in theaters.  It's currently showing in Seattle as part of the Seattle International Film Festival and will be released nationwide this summer.

Iraqis now have unfettered access to the Internet, and since the beginning of the war, the most accurate and timely reporting from Iraq has come from Iraqis themselves.  The most famous of Iraqi bloggers is Salam Pax.  It looks as though the site is on hiatus, but there's plenty to read and get caught up on in the meantime.  It also seems there's a book out.    Watch:   urlLink     I tend to avoid CNN and Fox News Channel as much as possible.  When I want to watch the news, I like it presented in a straightforward manner.  What's important to me is not how good their graphic designers are, but the quality of the news presented.  I prefer the style of BBC News, but it's hard for me to catch it since it's only run once in a while on BBC America.  Newsworld International is in the same kind of vein as BBC News.  I first discovered them while flipping through the channels after the 9/11 attacks.  NWI's presenters don't look like models, their graphics aren't in your face, but they present the news in a much more balanced fashion than either Fox News or CNN.  This is probably due to the fact that, although it is an American network, the content is mainly produced by CBC (the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation).  NWI also runs news programs from overseas, including English language versions of newscasts from Germany, China, and Japan.  Vice President Al Gore and a partner recently purchased Newsworld International and have promised to shift the focus of the channel to presenting news aimed at Americans aged 18-34.  As of yet, there have been no programming changes, at least none that I've noticed.
