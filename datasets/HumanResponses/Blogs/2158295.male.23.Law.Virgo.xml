      I have finally come to know fine pencils. The LSAT requires the use of type-2 pencils, which all too often are ugly and uncomfortable. These are traits I noticed in elementary school, when I tried to pursuade the headmistress of the lower school (http://www.boyslatinmd.com/academics/lower_school.htm) to switch to pens. I am heavy-handed insofar as I press really hard when I write; pencils leave my hands blistered. Seeking to fix this malady, I went to Bertram's Ink Well and disovered that pencils can be comfortable and beautiful. Just as the noble knight requires the finest armor, the LSAT taker requires the finest pencil.

      Today Paul Wolfowitz spoke at Georgetown about Iraq. During Q&A, liberal undergraduates monologued; their disprespectul, anti-intellectual presentation would have made proud their swine hippy parents (many of whom believe they have raised gentlemen and ladies). These youths-- arrogant not confident-- quiver when they speak. They must not have confidence in their beliefs, which will not prevail. I hope these protesters stay around for 2004; if likely voters are given a choice between protesters and the President, they will choose the President.

      I just thought I would share more Mark Helprin-- because his literary side is far better.   "Perhaps things are most beautiful when they are not quite real; when you look upon a scene as an outsider, and come to possess it in its entirety and forever; when you live in the present with the lucidity and feeling of memory; when for want of connection, the world deepens and becomes art."   Hmmm, I wonder whether the Real World crowd can get that?

      ON THE PRESIDENCY   I was re-reading Bob Dole's convention speech-- because in it the great novelist and writer Mark Helprin captures the essence of the President and the Presidency, a measuring stick:   A Presidency is NOT supposed to be like this:    "It is demeaning to the nation that within the Clinton administration, a core of the elite who never grew up, never did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered and never learned, should have the power to fund with your earnings their dubious and self-serving schemes."     A Presidency IS supposed to be like this:    I do not need the presidency to make or refresh my soul. That false hope I will gladly leave to others. For greatness lies not in what office you hold, but on how honest you are in how you face adversity and in your willingness to stand fast in hard places. . . Age has its advantages. . . Let me be the bridge to an America that only the unknowing call myth. Let me be the bridge to a time of tranquility, faith and confidence in action. And to those who say it was never so, that America's not been better, I say you're wrong. And I know because I was there. And I have seen it. And I remember."  A good President will have a moral vision of a better America, and he wants to take us there. Does George bush? Hmmm

      While I was outside in a rare bonding experience with the neighbors in my building during a one-hour false fire alarm, I was talking to my neighbor Amy, we both commented to one another that we never heard each other, and that this is indeed a wonderful thing. So right now I have Carl Carlton's Everlasting Love cranked up, as loud as it can go, and I can do this whenever. . .

      LIBERTARIANISM DOESN'T TACKLE THE BIG PROBLEMS  I went to my friend Austin's blog and read his manifesto-- a blunt case for a libertarianism. It mirrors what many intelligent and young people believe today, who hold that an over-arching moral order is not necessary-- that individualist principles are enough. I think the problem with this kind of thinking is that it ignores the condition of our society and instead basically focuses on eliminating bloated government, which is not an idea that I would oppose but which ignores the real condition of our society.   I think the primary problem today is that that we are not rich enough, but that we are not good enough, and by good I mean that we do not provide enough opportunities for people within the society to be happy). I sense an unhappy society when I consider the prevalence of school shootings, teen pregnancies, abortion, STD's, and divorce. Also, I think that people have lost a sense of propriety, which can be seen with the rise of entertainment that caters to the lowest common denominator and always gets worse, which effects the world, by making behaviors which people would naturally find to be wrong seem not only acceptable but so prevalent their place in one's life is inevitable.  These social ills can be traced to the rise of relativism, which prevailed during the 1960's when a generation that never grew up embraced such values and which have now seeped, top down, into the rest of society; relativists cannot do the right thing because they do not believe there is a right thing and so their minds short-circuit and make correct judgments neither for themselves nor for others. The shift from objective to relative patterns of thought has now made it impossible to make moral judgments as individuals and as a society.   By denying or minimizing the cultural decline rooted in relativism which creates non-judgmental patterns of thought that make it impossible for many to assess not only the condition of society but also their own lives, libertarians instead hold that things are fine and make it possible for things to get worse and take individuals, as well as the whole, farther apart from happiness and more toward an empty vacuum, which, of course, is filled by money which free trade makes readily available.

      THE MEANING OF MUSIC  In the discussion about music in the Republic, Socrates says the flute is a dangerous instrument. Although flutists are sometimes indeed very scary people, I think that this point is nevertheless questionable. But Plato's point that the instruments/music you listen to reveals more than a little about your nature-- especially today, when most encounter and communicate big ideas only through music. For me, good music consists for good lyrics with flow, harmony, melody, and of course a good beat. One of the genres I really like is country, and until recently I thought the best country artists were Mary Chapin Carpenter, Faith Hill, and Alan Jackson. But I now have a new favorite: Rhett Miller. He's actually in a new genre, alt. country, so there's no not too much twang. Anyway, this guy's stuff is addictive, and I would highly recommend that anyone with any sincere interest in good music go out and buy a copy of his solo album. One song I'm addicted to is, "This is What I Do," partly because its so addictive, and partly because of the lyrics. If you listen to it 100 times, you will pick up on Miller saying that the love affair between Wagner and Matilda is far worse than the affair between Kafka and Milena. Thinking about this during a break in the library, I decided to go and read Kafka's letters to Milena, which indeed are very sincere and loving. When I get a chance, I'm going to see what exactly the problem is between Wagner and Matilda.

      In his book, "On the Importance of Unimportant Things," the great Father Schall says even if you dance badly, you have to go to the dance hall and you have to dance. At the Latin Dance Alley last night, despite telling my new friend Jess Federer (www.federer04.com) that the chance of me dancing was the chance of a one-legged man winning an ass-kicking contest, I eventually gave in to her charms and had a splendid time. At any rate, my weekend business is underway. Today its cycling and tonight a visit from Ryan and one of his female Swedish students.

      FILIBUSTER THIS, PUNK ASS LIBERALS!   Today I woke up at 7 AM. Mornings are wonderful (I can't understand why so many people seem to only enjoy evenings, and only two of seven at that). So I read a little of the Republic (the parts about pursuing justice for its own sake and how tyrants can't have friends). Then, I re-read a very good Kate O'Beirne piece in the National Review about a solution to the problem of filibustered Republican judges. Basically, if a nominee is fillibustered in a way that is entirely unprecedented, Bush should appoint particularly conservative DC lawyers (Hill counsels and ACLJ types) who are more undesirable to Democrats than the real nominees who are undisputedly within the mainstream-right of judicial thought. When the Democrats allow a vote for real nominees, the recess people would discontinue their temporary service. What I love about this is that it's more of a countermeasure than an escalation and is sufficient to end the logjam.    I also hope the Marlins pull this off-- the Yankees are a used up phenomenon.

      VIVA MAHA RUSHIE  As you may notice, one of the links on my blog is to Rush Limbaugh's homepage. Rush has been a hero of mine for years, and I agreed when President Bush declared him a national treasure. At the very least, Rush is a treasure for the conservative movement. For 15 years, he has done more to advance and popularize conservatism than anyone else. He was doing it before O'Reilly, Hannity, Coulter, and all the others who followed his lead. His show has reached more people and changed more minds than the National Review, the Weekly Standard, or the Washington Times. He has done more to spread the word than the Heritage Foundation or the Cato Institute. If you are a conservative, whether you know it or not, and whether you like it or not, you owe Rush.   It is clear to me that the prescription drug addiction is a problem. Rush started taking these drugs when a doctor gave him a prescription (back then, some doctors actually believed OxyContin was a good drug). Rush filled his prescription, got addicted, and did things to fulfill his need for this bad drug. This was not a suburban cocaine party-- it was pain management gone to hell in a handbasket.

      Today was exhausting-- mentally and physically. The mental exhaustion came from intricately working out individual Logical reasoning LSAT questions and the (in)correct answer choices. Also, I had a number of political communications-- with Emmitt at dinner and at Philodemic. I took the liberal position on the following issues: I came out for laws prohibiting animal cruelty, for age-of-consent laws, for environmental protection (who wants all of American to look like Delaware?). At Philodemic, I argued against a flag burning amendment, saying flag burning isn't really all that harmful to the republic; who cares if a dozem ACLU liberals want to spend a rainy Monday morning in front of the Supreme Court burning a flag they bought at Wal-Mart. Look, things like the 9/11 World Trade center flag needs to be protected, but it would take a country of wimps to be concerned about second-rate demonstrations by third-rate liberals.   Today was physically exhausting. Today my trainer (Sharon Banks-Adams, Director of Yates, proud mother of two, and all-around Georgetown legend) convinced me to do a spinning class. It was tough as shit; literally fifteen minutes of uphill sprints-- I thought about Austin's boxing class and wished I was there; it would have been so much easier.   Speaking of the old sport, I am looking forward going out tomorrow with Austin and his fine friends to historic Adam's Morgan. You know, there has been some controversy surrounding Austin's blog; mischeif-makers of ill-breeding and poor taste chose to defame Austin; their behavior has caused me to contemplate basic principles of decorum, fairness, and propriety.

      A GREAT AMERICAN AUTHOR  The snobs who say books can't be good unless they are unsuccessful-- that anything which reachers the status of bestseller must be trash, are completely mistaken. John Grisham is an author of substantial depth; besides cranking out page turners that are fun to read, he accurately depicts places (like Georgetown), creates thoughtful characters, and raises important issues like the excesses of greedy trial lawyers. He also puts forth that idea, appealing at least to me, that law can be an honorable profession. So when I picked up his latest book (on tape) I did not pay much attention to the title because I assumed it would be about a tale of intrigue involving a young, southern lawyer. What I found, however, was an intrigueing story about a high school football team. Normally not inclined to such matter, I am nevertheless quite intrigued. . .

      MY TILT RIGHTWARD  Recently someone asked how I came to be a conservative. I answered that my experience as a student, reader, traveler, writer, patient, thinker, has led me to believe in less government and more freedom. I may be young, but I know what heartless bureaucracies are all about, and I have heard liberal professors invoke phony arguments to defend dubious schemes, and I can see through these. While I do believe there need to be things like the FDA and the military to protect our safety so that society can exist, I don’t like entitlement programs which unfairly take from some and give to others involuntarily. My encounters in Baltimore with criminal elements—especially car thieves—have made me realize the need for law-and-order, which cannot be supplied by nonsense rehabilitation games. This is what it means o me to be a conservative, and whether you are a conservative, a liberal, or don’t know, I think there is value in figuring out why you believe what you believe.

      AMAR ON HILLARY & 2004   Hopefully cold, calculating Hillary will challenge our beloved President; being built upon a mystique, she cannot sustain a loss. Hillary (like Dean) would lose because she is too liberal to win necessary states like Florida and West Virginia. Also, Bush looks strong because (1) the economy is improving (2) Iraq seems more like a challenge than a failure and (3) Bush looks and acts Presidential now.  No compelling challenger and no vulnerable incumbent mean no close election.

      THIS ENTRY HAS BEEN CHANGED FROM ITS ORIGINAL VERSION FOR THE PURPOSE OF CLARITY (I needed to order my own thoughts)  I am inspired to write a little bit about my philosophy of sex. On the one hand, the cornerstone of our lives and civilization is marriage between one man and one woman. Good marriages are sustained by commitment and mutual self-giving. For these things to prevail and families to be successful, the relationship must be monogamous; it is just part of the deal. The goodness of marriage, however, does not necessarily mean that sex before marriage-- with partners with whom you will never marry-- is bad. I would suggest that there are different phases in life, and that the youthful fun stage is not closely tied to the responsible adult phase that begins in earnest at the point of marriage when serious vows are exchanged. I think the argument for abstinence is necessarily religious, and therefore does not bind in any way any person who does not believe that sex before marriage will lead to hell. Conservatives should be more careful distinguishing arguments for the institution of marriage (currently under attack by liberal academics and judicial activists) and religious arguments for abstinence; it is very possible to see real value in monogomous marriages but little or no value in abstinence; the bundling of these views together in conservative presentation is wrong.

      I really wish it were getting hotter, not colder. I want the sun, the top down, and the happy people who are everywhere during the summer but are now just bundled up. Although I do like Christmas in New York (Ice skating at Rockefeller Center, the Christmas show, brunch at the Plaza, and shopping at overcrowded Saks all contribute to an excellent Holiday experience), I nevertheless find winter in Washington to be rather dull. I don't like being so constrained; I like to go to lots of different places all the time, and the snow and frigid chill that makes Scandinavians (not Fins) quiet, keeps me bound, not free. Don't get me wrong, I still try to enjoy life, with cigars and thick eggnog and all of that. But I feel like there is less wind in my sails, and, lately, I've been feeling good, so I'm just trying to keep that momentum going. At this juncture, I am going to look for the best of this season, and I am going to find it, but it just might not be all that easy, that's all.

      AMAR ON JUSTICE  I thought I would post some things I posted on Austin Tice's blog in our discussion abouot the nature of justice. Austin, to paraphrase, asked what is justice and why is it necessary. Here is how I understand justice, which I learned at Georgetown:   Part I:  Justice has to do with our proper relation to others. It is necessary for our happiness. The person without justice-- the tyrant-- cannot have friends for there can be nothing otuside himself. Men always pursue justice because as human beings we know that justice is good for its own sake, for surely it is impossible not to hope that nothing bad ever happends to a good man.  Austin says, " In Response to Amar: What is justice, what is happiness, why is the former necessary for the latter, what makes a good man, etc. Moreover I can think of many instances when I would want something bad to happen to an allegedly "good" man: if I wanted his wife, for example off the top of my head."   PART II:   The only happy man is the good man, who has courage, prudence, temperence, justice, and other virtues (minor virtues like beauty, intelligence, and money all contribute but are not necessary for happiness), which are attained by performing acts which put them into existence. It is not possible to be happy if you are without the virtue; i.e. if you are cowardly. Justice is necessary for happiness because the person without justice is a tyrant, who besides having a disordered soul (which you, Mr. Tice, may very well best understand using Aristotlian Ayn Rand's definition). Justice has been related to politics ever since the best city-- Athens-- killed the best man-- Socrates; why did the best city kill the best man and could this happen again? Ensuring that bad things do not happen to good men-- and indeed creating countries which would allow good men to exist, is the basis of politics  With respect to your example about wanting to sleep with another man's wife, I would say that you would not want to perform the act in order to hurt the man; in fact, you would probably wish to avoid hurting the good man. Rather, you would be performing the act in order to attain the minor virtue pleasure; if doing this is unjust, then you are disordered because you placed a minor virtue over a major virtue by placing pleasure over justice.

      Every once in a while, I feel really guilty; it comes from nowhere and makes my soul tremble. Today is such a day. I bought recycled toilet paper. I was at Fresh Fields, realized I needed toilet paper, went to where they sell the stuff, and found nothing except these environmentalist products. Besides being more expensive, I will say (without going into detail) that this toilet paper is not of the quality I have come to expect.   I am against recycling not only because its cost cannot be justified, but also because it is part of an environmentalist ideology which de-values man and finds more meaning in the natural world than can be rationally justified.

      WHY BARFIGHTS ARE STUPID  I never got beaten up by older brothers or sisters. But I turned out plenty tough; I can curl 45 pounds. Yet having never been in a fight means that I simply can't understand why fellow youth fight even as twenty-somethings. Unlike when a nation fights for land or a tropical gangster fights for a drug hut, the fight between two twenty-somethings can yield no tangible gain. So far as I can see, the fight between my friend and an acquiantance outside of a Canton/Baltimore bar over my friend's pretty girlfriend's reputation yielded both nothing.   Since peace/nonviolence is a prevailing value for society, nothing-- not even respect or pride-- can be gained when two twenty-somethings fight; no money, no land, no cornucopia of consumer goods is won. Fights generally produce at least some physical discomfort and sometimes also ripped clothing and render appearance disheveled. Besides phsycal discomfort for friends, fighters sometimes foirst upon frineds an awkward situation (nevertheless friends must forgive such immediately). The ultimate irony is that one does not even win the girl, because the girl often chooses the loser instead of the winner or neither.   I don't believe two people who would fight should be made to like each other-- or even to get along or respect one another as human beings. But I do think it makes much more sense to pursue personal pleasures. I don't want to fight; better go and pursue a well-mixed drink, a cornucopia of consumer goods, or some more worthy pleasure. Fighting, however, does not contribute to personal enjoyment or pleasure and is therefore a diversion from things more important.

      BL PRIDE AND TRADITION  In Baltimore, it matters more where you went to high school than college. Just as I love Georgetown, I love Boys' Latin. Just as Georgetown depends upon a committed alumni, so does Boys' Latin. However, I have deep concerns about the state of alumni involvement at BL. Today, I attended the BL v. St. Paul's football game with two of my longest-standing friends, Tony DeFranco and Brendan Burns (Mr. Burns). For this historically significant football game against an arch-rival, we constituted the entire alumni representation of the class of 1999. None of us even played football. As I looked across, at the acres of St. Paul's fans, I wondered what exactly happened to our fine class. In addition, I noticed that many faculty members were not in attendence. Now, I hope that this was a mere aberration, a fluke, but I am wondering: what the hell is going on? Part of the solution to reviving the missing BL spirit could spawn from a massive, multi-year homecoming, where alumni return to cheer in the fields, teach in the classrooms, and shephard the school within high ranks of the administration. Addutionally, we need to listen to wise men, like Latin Chair John Bowling, who understand very well what makes Boys' Latin great; if there is ever anyone who more deserves a chair on the board of trustees, a trustee alumni most trust, it would be he. I don't know if I am the only one a tidbit worried about the continuity of the Boys' Latin tradition, but if there are any others it is necessary that they influence the school however possible. And, dammit, some more members of the once-great Class of 99 need to find a roadmap and figure out where BL is again!

      I simply cannot fathom the number of people afraid of cotroversy. All the time I wonder, what made them this way? Parents? Society? Schools? Whatever is to blame, most little people are afraid of cotroversy-- they are doomed to boredom and shall know few truths. As I read eulogies, I am reminded that Dean Gordon was a walking (or, later, wheel-chairing) antithesis to the prevailing modern coward. While most worry simply about discretion and care, Dean Gordon said, "boldness, boldness, always boldness." While most only praise moderation, Dean Gordon said, "too much is always enough." When you get right down to it, there are two ways to approach the world: the cowardly way and the Dean Gordon way. I know which I prefer.

      I am amazed at how politics, especially after the 2000 elections, is shaping to look like the North versus the South, the heartland versus the cities. Yesterday Mississippi and Kentucky elected Republican Governors, and the Democrats took the New Jersey legsilature and the mayorship of Philadelphia. . .

      FINISH THE DAMN PROJECT  I want to tell you about suffering. For about two years, the Georgetown Project has been underway, for six nights a week, from 9:30 PM to 7 AM. The idea is to fix the decaying infrastructure-- built during the 1880's-- which has been recently characterized by massive power outages, exploding manholes, and blocks-- yes, city blocks-- which dissapear into oblivion. While changes are obviously in order, the wya that the city is handling the project is making me want to start a peoples' rebellion. I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of traffic jams not only all day but now all night-- because inefficient construction crews deem in necessary to close down 30 blacks in order to fix one block. In addition to creating midnight traffic jams, over-zealous, overpaid meter maids collude with brutish tow truck drivers to tow cars that happen to be parked along streets within the "construction zone" [everywhere].    I'm having a fantasy. All the lazy, do-nothing union workers are replaced by hard-workers who strive with zeal to do their job in an expedited manner. The meter-paid/tow-truck gestapo is shut down forever. All the cones, bulldozers, police cars, and port-a-potties are gone, letting us enjoy the romantic splendor of Georgetown by moonlight once again. This is not some second-rate, third-world, UN project; this is the restoration of the best neighborhood in capital of the most important country in the world, and the urban notables therein deserve to have their work done with Germanic efficiency. This lackidaisical, poorly run project-- which is supposed to end in 2006 but may indeed take longer-- is making me want to move to the country.

      NATION OF ISLAM & JACKO  According to yesterday's New York Times, Michael Jackson's life has basically been taken over by the Nation of Islam. Black militant Muslim anti-Semetic separatists are making his financial decisions and guarding the gates of Neverland. In addition (and this is the best part), the Nation of Islam has moved into Mark Geregos' LA office; Apparently, Geregos and his people didn't know what to do when they showed up to oversee the Jackson case. That does beg the question: What the hell do you do when the Nation of Islam moves in to your law office?

      HOW TO LOSE WEIGHT  No New Year's Resolutions for me. My goals are long-term and a revolution around the sun is arbitrary. In addition, making a New Year's resolution is like cursing yourself. How many messy people really follow through and get organized? How many fat people actually get thin? Actually, people should follow through with their resolution to get thin. Whenever I venture outside the Beltway during holidays, I am struck by the gluttony of middle America. Its incredible ABOUT how the same people who obsess about elusive Hollywood images stuff themselves with vats of buttered popcorn and slurpees big enough to feed two of the Indian villages from whence the proprietor came. To add to the ridiculousness, about half the people who eat these foods incessantly are actually on diets, albeit half-assed ones. As far as I can tell, taking the following three steps will always lead to significant weight loss: (1) AVOID gargantuan slurpees and things like that (2) CUT the amount of carbohydrates (3) EXERCISING for five hours per week doing serious cardiovascular activity, not walking like granny but running like our noble commander-in-chief.  You don't need fat Dr. Phil's diet.

      VISITING RON  Yesterday I visited Ron Smith at the WBAL (1090 AM) in his studio on television hill. I first met him through my employer, the now defunct Rolling Road Tobacco Warehouse. I interned with him for my high school senior project. He was also at the graduation party. At any rate, I have always liked Ron even though I don't always agree with his foreign policy; he is part of the paleoconservative remnant and therefore opposes foreign policy intervention in situations like Iraq. Even though Ron is cynical, he is also very sincere and has been very nice to me and my friend, always letting us come in and serve as his studio audience. Seeing talk radio from the other side is amazing, because you realize you're totally alone in a dark room with a microphone yet reaching 50-100,000 people. I also figured out the reason why Ron has lasted-- he really likes his callers.

      GOOD GIFT  I had actually grown so sick of expensive presents that  I instructed my family to go easy on me this Christmas; the volume of presents I got plummeted from 15 to 2, which meant that they were more thoughtful. I got one article of clothing and one DVD, Seabiscuit, which is one of my favorite movies because it is a true, inspriational story of historical importance with compelling characters. I think it is amazing that a small horse ridden by a big jockey previously discarded as useless can win the heart of a country dispirted by the Great Depression, and, later, when the horse and jockey are both crippled, can come back to win again. That is the kind of thing that ends malaise. Right now the vast majority of my family have gone to Naples, Florida, on a one-week golf vacation. I don't like golf, so I thought going would be fruitless. I do wish things were open and there were things to do, but  I still understand the value of having Holidays like this.

      GEPHARDT IS UNDERRATED  Since the economy is booming and the Iraq deaths-per-month will probably not increase so as to cause alarm, I think President Bush will win re-election. However, I think it is likely the Democrats will try, and I think their pick will be Dick Gephardt. I think his previous experience with both general and presidential politics is going to come through as Dean fizzles and Clark and Lieberman compete for the non-primary voting middle. Besides consistantly winning in a Republican Missouri district for decades, Gephardt's skill also came through when he created the mantra which stopped the Republican Revolution in 1995, accusing Republicans of wanting to, "cut Medicare, Medicaid, Education, and the Enviornment." He manipualted the media into printing his lie, which the public came to believe and which caused the Republican leadership to abandon the Freshman of the 104th and reopen the government.   Even though Gephardt's star is said to have fallen because Democrats did not recapture the House (which cannot be blamed on one man), he still might tenaciously attack Bush for creating recovery without jobs and trading Midwestern jobs for Mexican junk. Besides showing himself capable of tenaciously attacking Bush, Gephardt might also contrast his strong religious concitions with Hoard Dean's silence on religion; it's important to remember that Democratic primary voters have different values that the atheist intellectual elite shepharding the party agenda. With his strong Union support, Gephardt could win Iowa and immediately frame himself as the anti-Dean. Frankly, I think that the other candidates are failing to position themselves well for this; Lieberman's constipated, Jewish-Dalai Lama style, Wesley Clark's inexperience, and John Kerry's emotional deadness, make Gephardt plausible in South Carolina and the following Midwest primaries. Gephardt could also make Bush sweat because he is the only person who might be able to use the Democrats' only successful strategy besides the race card (which Howard Dean's pandering to white trash pickup drivers precludes), to lie and attack Bush for cutting entitlements the media will not credit him for ballooning.

      EASY PAY   I had saved this afternoon for paying three parking tickets; generally, it takes way too long to deal with stamps, envelopes, checks, and those kinds of things. I was spared the ordeal when I read the back of the ticket and saw that I could pay by credit card online. This new setup is way too convenient.

      BUSH SELLS OUT  I am a Republican because I am a conservative; I want Republicans to win because I want conservative ideals to prevail. The three most important conservative ideals for me are limited government, national security, and winning the culture war. While I think President Bush genuinely wants to protect America from terrorists, and while I think he stands firmly against the secular cultural elite, I now question his commitment to limited government; he is moving away from the night-watchman state envisioned in 1789 and, fleetingly, in 1994 and has instead decided to add to FDR and LBJ's circus of entitlements.   George Bush's Christams present to Elanor Roosevelt's ghost is the Medicare Bill, which creates a new entitlement, prescription drugs. The bill will phase in over the next 10 years and, by then, will cost a trillion dollars; nobody is even daring to guess what it will cost once the boomers retire, and, frankly, I don't think most young people want to know. The first phase of the new entitlement will be a drug discount card eerily reminiscent of the one Bill Clinton waved when seeking to implement his wife's cruel health care intentions in 1993. When Bush's socialist plan is finally phased in by 2010, all old people on the government dole will not be responsible for the vast majority of pill bills.   The targeted beneficiaries are Floridian pensioners who will comprise a record 35% of the 2004 elecotrate in an election that might be like 2000, except George Bush wanted a limited government then, which of course is why young conservatives like me rallied to his camp before, during, and after. Now, limited government conservatives are beginning to feel abandoned; besides ballooning Medicare with a new entitlement, the President has created a new national security bureaucracy premised on the idea the bureaucrats make us safer, signed Ted Kennedy's fat education bill premised on the idea that money teaches kids, and John McCain's chilling campaign finance bill premised on ending corruption by limiting speech, and has budgeted as if deficits don't matter.      If President Bush was committed to limited government, he would have supported privatization for the next generation, expanded school vouchers, and a campaign finance reform centered around immediate disclosure, not arbitrary limits. We should also not be in record deficits, but perhaps running a surplus because we finally took an axe to unnecessary bureucracies like the Department of Education, the Department of Commerce, and HUD. Were the President to have stuck to his Texas guns, we would be ready to take on the big conservative ideas-- like simplifying the tax code. However, I think this election year will bring promises very much like those given by Bush I, Bill Clinton, and this Bush at their State of the Unions. Who believes he will mention more big tax cuts?   Conservatives are being treated like Democrats treat their blacks. We are being sold out, and there is no evidence that we will not be sold out time and time again. To avoid such a face, its time for the great body of conservative thinkers to use their brain, find their backbone, and tell the President that we won't rally to his side unless he repents; a good first step at atonement might be saying "No" to the Latino activists now demanding amnesty for millions of illegals who have contempt for the law. However, Taking tough stands like this means risking ridicule from those who place party over principle.

      BENEFITS OF CAPITALIST MEDICINE  Recently I saw a movie, Master and Commander, which made me grateful to live in the modern world for two reasons. First, France is no longer a powrful country. Second, we now enjoy the marvels of modern medicine. Throughout the movie, we see how medicine was really done, not so long ago. While traveling at sea during wartime before the development of anesthetics, the doctor amputates a kid's arm and, later, removes a bullet from his own chest. The movie made me realistically confront the crudeness of the system that prevailed before the ascent of our modern health care system.   Depsite the fact that liberals imagine a health care crisis, the reality is that our system has come a long way and will proceed a long way-- so long as the facilitator of our progress, the free market, remains unobstructed. Spome say profit does not reequire a profit motive; they would say the curer of cancner will foresake the payoff; right. Well, I know the health care system which spares us from amputations and self-operations improves due to incentive, and that even universal coverage, so that every shemale can get a free sex change (a service the most prominent supporter of universal health care, Bill and Hillary Clinton's Surgeon General Jocelyn Elders, advocates providing, the kind of thing which could not be fairly denied in a universal system). Before we arrest technological development by destroying the profit motive for dubious universal goals, we should just be grateful for the progress freedom facilitates.

      POWER BATTLES KILL RELATIONSHIPS  I am generally unimpressed with power. I am especially unimpressed with power between intimates. Who will dominate the relationship/marriage/household? Who cares? Controlling the remote control, the thermostat, the minivan color, and all such silly things requires no courage, no imagination, no intelligence, nothing. If you are the kind of person who yearns to make such decisions, then you like domination for its own sake. If you are a boyfriend/husband who wishes to boss your girlfriend/wife around, then you have given up on the relationship and sought instead arbitrary power over the trivial; I am sure this kind of power is nothing like the rush and thrill that comes from ruling and army or a corporation, which takes a certain amount of vision, virtue, and verve. However, on the individual level it is almost impossible to maintain control over people for any substantial amount of time, and, even if this happens, it winds up always hurting the person being controlled. Stupid battles over control of meaningless things-- like remote controls and fridge colors-- create counterproductive fights and make it harder for people to revel in each other's company.

      ON SEX AND THE CITY  Cynical people always say that television sucks. It rots the brain and whatnot. These people are ignoring thoughtful and funny classics, like Murphy Brown, Married With Children, Fraiser, Seinfeld and the Simpsons. While I concede that a many new shows are uninspiring, I would point to two addictive HBO shows, the Sopranos and Sex in the City. These shows provide insight into two seemingly impossible to understand groups, women and mobsters, think. Since I will probably never have the opportunity to be a mobster, the Sopranos is not quite so practical as Sex in the City. The essential points about women that I have picked up (with the help of John Agozzinno) is that they measure their self-worth according to their relationship success. While the four women on Sex in the City have different criteria for success, it is undisputable that they are only happy when they are in a satisfying relationship. The other noteworthy thing is that three of the four women in the show do not know what they want. The exception, of course, is Samantha (who incidentally is the prettiest), who I would love to date.

      JOHN EDWARDS--  HOW IMPRESSIVE IS THE PRETTY BOY?   My friend Marco Liias writes on his blog, "Musing of the Day: I love John Edwards. I have always believed that our president should reflect the American people, and care about the issues that they care about. John Edwards is a principled public servant, but more than that, he comes from a working class background."John Edwards is a multimillionaire pretty-boy trial lawyer who ran for Presient because he knew he couldn't keep his North Carolina Senate seat. Although he is a very smooth talker with a good stump speech, he has abandoned his working class background, not because he made money, but because he wants to raise the taxes of millions of working families and drive up the cost of their health care through reckless torts.   Now, I must go, because some family members have brought me two kinds of veal from Cafe Milano.

      AILING AMAR  I have been sick-- since this past Sunday. I have congestion, a soar throat, fever, and other things. Besides making it impossible to enjoy the outdoors, winter breeds sickness. Although my weight-lifting routine is uninterrupted, I have not been able to do any spinning or running. My poor Lexus convertible sits in the garage, lonely and neglected, with nobody to take it to the Auto Spa. Hell, I can't even go get a hair cut and facial. So here I am, eating pints of Haagen-Daz ice cream (I will not eat Ben & Jerry's, because a portion of their profits is automatically given to the Kucinich for President campaign). Anyway, I am amusing myself by listening to Rush Limbaugh and watching Sex in the City (I now own Seasons II and IV on DVD). Its a good show that gives tremendous insight into how women think. My favorite character, by far, is Samantha, a girl with her head on straight.

      THE COST OF CHEAP LABOR  I think President Bush's proposal to offer amnesty to illegal immigrants is a bad idea. It embraces criminal behavior and mocks those who came to America by playing by the rules and respecting the rule of law. The amnesty is also bad for the economy, because the costs of providing education, prison space, and social welfare benefits to the hordes of Hispanic newcomers outweighs the economic benefit of cheap menial labor. Beyond these reasons, however, is the fact that we reject a better vision, of a country where people are united, united because they speak the same language and united in their respect for the rule of law. Instead, it seems that we are assimilating Hispanics at a rate that is simply too fast to allow for assimilation-- since there are so many, they can form a parallel culture, effectively ending the melting pot idea that has made immigration flourish concurrently with a unifying American culture.   When people try to justify the current immigration policy, they generally argue that the Hispanic underclass fills jobs Americans do not want. This is potentially misleading because natives would take the jobs if the pay was higher, which would happen if there was not a steady supply of Mexicans willing to work to much less. Wouldn't it be better if we had lots of available jobs which paid enough for a single wage earner to provide for a family of four? This kind of job market existed before the illegal immigrants came, and it can exist again once they go, but that would mean that the American government would have to say that it has more of an obligation to provide opportunity for natives.

      AWFUL MOVIE  Cold Mountain maybe the worst movie I have ever seen, next to Rosalie Goes Shopping. I saw it because it was set during the interesting Civil War period, not knowing it would be a bad love story between annoying Ada and Inman, who is the strong silent type (i.e. a guy who's too insecure to share his emotions) and cowardly deserter. After two hours of humdrum, where she just gets along and he goes on the run, they make love once and he dies. The end.

      THE IMPORTANCE OF FAMILY  A few years back I was getting my old car fixed and I decided to walk around the area near the garage. I came upon an antique store, and inside I met a Georgetown graduate who offered me the entire University of Chicago Great Books collection for $25 , which we both knew was a joke price he was giving me because he had been young and in my shoes once.  Even though the 30-volume collection contains the entire western canon, my favorite part of the set is actually a supplement-- the Great Ideas. Today I had a few moments, so I went to the first book of ideas, "Angel-Love," and I came across "Family," which intrigued me because I had never really thought about what a family really is. Although it is obvious, I bet lots of people can't quite put it into words, so I thought I would paraphrase the idea:   All human beings, even orphans, need family. Built into man is a desire for a mother and a father, and when parents who do not entirely fulfill the role of mother and the role of father, something always seems lacking. To work properly, a family requires mutual goodwill, or love. Also, it must have a workable authority structure, meanining somebody-- either the mother or the father-- has to have the final say. Otherwise, unresolved issues accumulate and destroy goodwill. Families also create friendships, between the spouses and between siblings, which create a model for extra-familial friendships. Without real families, society collapses: there is no way to bring children from maturity to immaturity-- unless the state assumes rearing responsibilities-- except the family. This is why, despite the unfortunate elements of family pride, feauds, black sheep, and curses, the family endures.

      LOCAL INSTITUTION GOES DOWNHILL  I have good memories of the Polo Grill. The local institution served great meals and put on one hell of a graduation party. I was surprised to hear that the owner sold it to his son-in-law, who erected Four West, a more casual, seafood oriented, trendy spot with an ugly decor graced with unnecessary pink neon. The food is good, so good that I am now craving the fried lobster nuggets in that buttery sauce.

      BULLDOG, CONTINUED  Today I walked through Red Square with Trouble and we could not keep the pretty girls from swarming us-- it's like I just joined the NBA or some boy band. Some just approach him and profess love, others offer to trade money or goods, and many share their own stories about their pets, and one girl told me about her French Bulldog. We also encountered a very exotic Latin girl walking Lolita, an eight-month old boxer who runs two hours per day (Trouble probably won't run two hours in his life). Tourists and freshmen often confuse Trouble for Jack the bulldog, but those who actually know Jack point out that Trouble is more sociable and happy. Now, he's sleeping and snoring, which means I can actually type.

      SAN FRANCISCO: A CESSPOOL OF LAWLESSNESS  San Francisco giving gays marriage licenses is a breakdown of the rule of law. It defies California state law, which defines marriage between one man and one woman. Like the backward Alabama Judge who refused to remove the Ten Commandments from his courtroom, this is an example of people first claiming a moral high ground and then defying the rule-of-law. If you support San Francisco and oppose Roy Moore as out-of-control, then you are a hypocrite, a hypocrite who has given up any claim to invoke he rule of law in any argument.

      TROUBLE!   My new family dog, Trouble, is one spoiled bulldog, whose spoiledness goes beyond the typical pampered puppy with a nice pillow and personalized doggie bowl. Trouble is in another league-- right now he is wrapped in a nice big mink coat that might as well have his name on it. Besides being spoiled, Trouble is very loving. He gives and gets lots of attention and he likes to play with his toys. He cannot walk more than two city blocks per day, but he will be very muscular like his daddy, Bubba Bocephius. Wherever Trouble and I go, we get a lot of attention. Today we were in front a Starbucks and flooded with people, including attractive girls (still, bulldogs are the quintessential guys dog, like a Red Volkswagen Jetta is the quintessential girls car). People love seeing bulldogs because they are rare, and no dog looks so ferocious on the outside but so harmless on the inside. Anyway, it is time to give him his afternoon Twinkie.

      WHY ARE LIBERALS SO MAD???   America is doing just fine. No terrorists incidents since 9/11. The death rate in Iraq is under control. The economy is good. Smart people with right-of-center credentials are running the various agencies and departments. There will always be corruption and crime, but I think most seasoned and wise people would consider these times good. The only thing we need to do is protect ourselves from liberals who would raise our taxes to pay for their dubious, self-serving schemes. If you want to see a failed President leading a failing America, look at Jimmy Carter. But these pronouncements of doom are childish.

      ENTER THE BIKE  I just bought a Bianci Axis, which of course is a hybrid bike fit for both road and trail. In addition, I got a black tights, a blue helmit, and a yellow riding shirt. One thing I admire about bikers is that they are a stylish lot, and so hopefully I can fit right in. Although I certainly look the part, I am having a little bit of trouble making the transition from indoor spinning: I can't get the damn cleats on. It's easy to get one cleat on, but once you get that one, and your foot is locked to the pedal, it is incredibly difficult to get the other one on. I do want to conratulate and reccomend the staff of Revolution Cycle, whose expertise contrasts with their know-nothing neighboring competitors. My bike is here in my apartment, already laced with mud, and ready for tomorrow.

      MALIBU SUCKS  I did not like Malibu, because its only redeeming feature is beauty. Otherwise, Malibu has nothing to offer except psychics, religious cults, and overly bleached surfers. I should have known better, and been far more cynical of a place where Hollywood couples settle between divorces. While Pepperdine Law is indeed a gorgeous school with a committed and talanted faculty, the students seem are simply too laid back. In addition, the school's emphasis on mediation and dispute resolution, in hindsight, seems to go against the heart of the law, which of course is litigation. The highlight of my trip occurred when I got bored, checked out of the Malibu Beach Inn, and relocated to Santa Monica. I checked into a beautiful hotel with (most importantly) lots of people and activity. Then, I went and rented a fast and light bike and rode about 35 miles along hte beautiful coast. Despite being February, there were still a few beautiful SoCal girls playing volleyball, and I am heartened by this because, because there should be nice, carefree little blond California girls who do nothing all day except play volleyball-- they are proof that America is a land of abundence. This trip taught me one thing: for better or worse, I am a creature of the Beltway and I love Washington. Although I hate the weather, I love the seriousness and the intensity.

      SCREW PACKING LIGHT!   Screw packing light. I was just trying to fit all of my things into a tiny suitcase when I realized that I do not want to economize on space, and therefore I will be taking my extra-extra-extra large Tumi suitcase. Even though it is new, it captures the splendor of a time when people traveled with trunks. I would rather be like that than the trite "smart traveller" who tries to fit all of his wrinkle-free clothes into a stewardess-sized suitcase. I am young and strong and I can carry a huge bag, with four pairs of shoes, my i-pod + accessories, my laptop, and some hardcover books. I wonder what geek came up with this phoney need to economize on space? I do not live in Japan, where they have to shrink their bonzai because there's no room for real horticulture. No, I am an American, and as such I can do travel however I want, with whatever I want, and speak whatever language I want when I get there, and if you find that uncouth, then you have probably been brainwashed by efficiency-obsessed fools, who rush with their light luggage to meetings where they serve stale danishes. That's not life. So, anyway, I am taking my huge trunk-sized suitcase to Malibu, where I shall enjoy good weather.

      LIBERAL TALK RADIO: AT BEST, A LONG SHOT  Air America Radio has been launched on six radio stations across America, with one inexperienced host, Al Franken. The network aims to overtake Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, and others who have built loyal national audiences. There are a couple of things to remember, though: (1) Rush Limbaugh broadcasts to 22 million people on over 600 radio stations and via the Internet, so it is a long climb to #1 (2) Liberal talk radio has been tried before, by people like Mario Cuomo, which failed, and N.P.R., which continues to lag far behind. I wonder how this network will fare...

      PICKING ON ROVE IS LAME   I have been talking and thinking about politics for about half of my 23 years, so I have been doing this long enough to know a lame argument when I see one. The cheapest, most meaningless attacks are often those where somebody attacks the President by citing the name of his political strategist. During the Clinton years, I remember filling with rage whenever I heard the name, "James Carville," or, "Dick Morris." Over time, I realized that James Carville is funny and Dick Morris (who would actually go on to become a big Clinton critic) is brilliant. This is why I cannot understand why Bush critics speak of, "standing up to Carl Rove," as if it means something. The truth is that Carl Rove is just another good political strategist who gives the President advice based on polls and analysis. Rove is good, but, then again, what really distinguishes him from Ed Rollins, Paul Begala, or Joe Trippi?   Some might say that Rove is particularly ruthless, but then they should be able to give seven or eight specific examples of exceptional ruthlessness, but they cannot. Or, somebody can say that it is simply inappropriate for a president to have political strategists-- period. Campaigns are one thing, but to have a cynical figure in the Old Executive Office Building calling the shots is unacceptable. However, I would wager that Rove is not more powerful than his predecessors, and that he competes with others-- including the Chief of Staff, cabinet officers, the Vice President, and the campaign manger-- for the president's ear. If there is any real evidence of an administrative hierarchy that places Rove at the top, then why not provide some evidence? Otherwise, just accept his existence and talk about what he says instead of going after the human substance of the man.   I think it was in poor taste for the National People's Action to organize hundredsof Chicagoans to stampede Rove's house this past weekend, to demand passage of legislation granting citizenship to illegal immigrants. The masses chanted brilliant slogans like, "Karl Rove ain't got no soul." Ironically, Carl Rove is the biggest force in the administration behind granting amnesty to illegals. He believes, wrongly, that pardoning is necessary for winning the HIspanic vote. Since Rove is actually the probably the most pro-illegal immigration official inside the President's inner circle, does it really make sense to bush hordes of people to his house, to bang on his window and scream angrily that he has no soul? Besides being tasteless, it is counterproductive.

      JOHN KERRY: THE FALL GUY FOR CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM?   Two weeks ago, John Kerry went from a lead between +3 and +7 (depending on whether you factor Nader, or not). Now, Kerry somewhere between -1 and -4. What happened? Kerry went on a ski/snowboard vacation, where he insolently insulted a secret service officer trying to protect him. Also, the Bush campaign started running ads, some arguing that he has had a successful presidency given his challenges, the other arguing that Kerry is weak on terror and weak on defense. Kerry should know that this is just the beg$inning, that he will be outspent 2:1 or 3:1, largely because Bush is raising record amounts of money. Why is Bush raising record amounts of money? The campaign finance reform bill allows him to raise more money from individuals, $2,000, not $1,000 for the primary, and $2,000, not $1,000, for the general election. In addition, the campaign finance reform bill wil also ensure no unions can run ads during the final 60 days of elections (and, remember, unions used to greatly outspend businesss groups in the final stretch).   It is no surprise John Kerry had a lead during a period when the only ads running were Democratic ads generally more critical of the president than one another. Advertising clearly matters, but, let us suppose that both parties produce ads of similar quality, that they both have good attack machines. In a close race, the fact that Bush will run more ads in more places-- thanks especially to campaign finance reform-- will make a big difference.

      GO PAT GO, GO PAT GO, GO PAT GO   In Washington, some Senators advance the conservative cause-- less government and more freedom-- and others do not. Usually, Republicans are more conservative than Democrats. Every once in a while, a Democrat like Zell Miller will stand up for the individual liberty our foundres wanted us to have. Likewise, Republicans like Jim Jeffords, Nelson Rockefeller, and the feminists from Maine will abandon the party and the cause, or, poison the cause from within. Whenever liberal Republicans threaten to cheapen the party with their gutless ideology, it is incumbent upon conservatives to stand up and fight. In 1976, Ronald Reagan fought the good fight, saying he would fight till the end, "even if I have to lose every damn state."   The fight continues every single primary season, when gutless moderates with money face off against conservative believers with the good ideas and the grassroots on their side. If you pick a Republican Senator you like-- from Rick Santorum to Sam Brownback to Jon Kyl-- you will find they have emerged from a bloody primary with the gutless insiders. The important thing to note is that they have prevailed.   Now, Arlen Specter is up. He is the man who Borked Bork, coddled Clinton during impeachement with a meaningless Scottish verdict, reduced the Bush tax relief, fought to make the boyscouts homoerotic-friendly, supported giving American sovereignty to the European's International Court, supported taxpayer funded abortions for our servicewomen (which, he has voted, can even be partial-birth), and supported stem-cell research that would turn children into gremlins. Now, Arlen Specter is being challenged by a good conservative Congressman, who simply put is much more like Rick Santorum. He should beat Arlen, who has no redeeming feature, who is known for being mean to staffers, mean to Christians, and who is reputed by insiders to be growing increasingly senile due to medications. Perhaps he won't release his medical records because he wants to run the Judiciary Committee, to make sure a pro-life justice like Robert Bork can never pass. Do we want Arlen to be in that position?   It is time to retire this pathetic, cranky old man and insert a bring, young, good conservative.

      THE WRONG SOLUTION FOR NO PROBLEM   A Floridian racist with no apparent ties to Georgetown sent racist e-mails to the Black Student Alliance and the Georgetown N.A.A.C.P. chapter. After the e-mail was sent, but before the sender was identified, black students, liberal campus organizations, and others held a series of rallies on campus, protesting what they consider prevailing racism at Georgetown and demanding changes from the administration, including a more Afrocentric curriculum, racial sensitivity training for the Department of Public Safety (which is almost entirely black), and more mandatory sensitivity training for incoming freshmen. Even after the identity of the e-mailer that started it all was revealed, the administration has chosen to acquiesce to all the demands.   The administration clearly feels that the prevailing racism alleged by the protesters indeed existed, and this is enough to justify virtually all changes desired. After all, the protesters cited, anecdotally, many racist incidents which they say occurred on campus; they hold that the e-mail could have very well come from a Georgetown student, and, besides, there is plenty of other stuff to address. Here is what I think: if racism prevails at Georgetown like the protesters contend, if there is a problem, then it should be fixed, but not with sensitivity training that alienates, filling the curriculum with courses of questionable legitimacy, and attempting to indoctrinate freshmen with liberal multiculturalism. If racist incidents occur, if black students are systematically or incidentally oppressed and made to real inferior by supremacist-minded whites, then crimes arising from such incidents ought to be dealt with severely and those responsible must be shamed and made to feel very lonely.   However, such changes are only necessary if these racist incidents-- cited by the protesters-- actually occurred. Let there be no doubt: those protesting represent organizations standing to gain resources, status, and the satisfaction of seeing their agendas-- which definitely include things like curriculum changes and more sensitivity training-- implemented. Anecdotes, therefore, are unacceptable proof for making fundamental changes to the institution. If what they are saying is true and serious, there can surely be corroborating witnesses, evidence, references to date, time, place, and all parties involved, as well as a full explanation of what action, if any, was taken at the time of the purported incident, as well as an explanation if nothing was done at the time. If they are telling the truth and can actually supply sufficient evidence, then such claims ought to be made public to be evaluated by the community-at-large for their seriousness, not dealt with behind-the-scenes in secret by top officials in the administration. Anyone who seeks to implement changes without proof should be held accountable by the community and should be castigated for not doing their homework.   To explain my skepticism about these purported incidents, I want to compare racism to love. Our culture-- through books, television, movies, casual conversation, and otherwise-- talks a great deal about love, so much so that young people strive for love, and think they are in love when they are really not (this is probably a meaningful and healthy aspect of the coming-of-age experience). Likewise, society talks so much about racism, for students from elementary school on, that we are made to see and feel racism when it does not exist (though, like love, it may, though rarely). We imagine racism like we imagine love, which is much more harmful because racism is pejorative, socially unacceptable, inherently wrong, and linked to historical travesty, and, therefore, saying racism exists when it does not is unfair to those accused and devalues the community-at-large.   Before Georgetown acts as if these racist incidents took place, we need to know that they took place, and for that to occur a thorough, public, and open examination is necessary, and then the community must have an opportunity to judge the evidence. After all, we young people have enough rich imagination and ambition to make up the entire thing for our own dubious, self-serving schemes.

      WHO IS JOHN MCCAIN?   It is funny that many speculate about a Kerry-McCain ticket. Though the G.O.P. would do well to rid itself of the tempramental Senator from Arizona, the speculation by the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, and political observers betrays a  total lack of knowledge. During his tenure in the Senate, John McCain has opposed abortion, opposed gay marriage, supported Reagan and Bush II's tax cuts, supported the Cold War Buildup, supported Iraq, and basically the rest of the right's agenda.   So how do I explain McCain's popularity? The media elite likes John McCain for two reasons. First, he supported campaign finance reform and cutting pork-barrel spending, two relatively unimportant issues. Second, McCain does criticize the President on virtually everything (before he goes onto the Senate floor and votes for the President and against Kerry). The American people like McCain because he suffered for years in a Vietnam prison, which, though a good deed, is not contemporary.

      GO RALPH GO!!!!  I sent Ralph Nader $10. It will do more to elect Bush than giving to Bush. According to the New York Times, the race is now 46% for Bush, 38% for Kerry, and 9% for Nader. I figure that what goes around comes around; Ross Perot cost the Republicans 1992 and 1996, and, assuming the crazy man stays in Texas, Nader will cost the Dems 2000 and 2004. However, we should not forget that it was also another third-party candidate, Patrick Buchanan, who took enough votes from Florida Jews in Palm Beach to hand Bush the election. Damn, I love third-parties.

      USE THE POLLS THAT MATTER  Virtually all the polls which show Senator Kerry leading are wrong, because they either survey adults or registered voters, when only polls of likely voters or, better, very likely voters, tend to be accurate. Since it is expensive targeting people who will actually vote, however, those surveys will not be out till later.

      TROUBLE CONTINUES  I am in Baltimore. Trouble, who is growing quickly, is right here. He is beginning to learn not to just shadow me everywhere, but to wait for a while to see where I wind up; it saves him many trips up and down the starcase. I am proud of how quickly he is learning.

      KERRY'S SENATE RECORD WILL COST HIM THE ELECTION  John Kerry may be polling well. However, Kerry can be accatcked on substantive grounds because:     (1) Kerry voted "No" to banning partial birth abortion, which most registered voters oppose   (2) Kerry flip-flopped on Iraq    (3) Kerry is Otherwise Weak on Defense/Terror because:        (a) Kerry Opposes Missle Defense      (b) Kerry Opposes Patriot Act (flip-flop)       (c) Kerry Has voted "No" to funding many military modernization projects  (3) Kerry Opposed the death penalty and supported furlough  as Michael Dukakis' Lietenant Governor    (4) Kerry Opposes school choice and is beholden to teachers' unions beholden to low standards and failure.   (5) Kerry Supports Gun Control, which, though popular the northeast he will surely win, will hurt him in states that matter with voters who care   (6) Kerry Opposed De-Regulating the Airline Industry, which turned out to be a huge success   (7) Kerry Supported Federal Regulations which have crippled the timber industries in pivotal states in the northwest   (8) Kerry has Supported high gas taxes, which are getting higher and higher right now, and refuses to renounce higher gas taxes in the future   (9) Kerry Opposes a Balanced Budget Amendment that makes deficits possible, unlike Bush.   (10) Kerry Opposes Sanctions for Cuba, to the dismay of voting Cuban Floridians   and the list could go on and on and on and on. . . It is no wonder no Senator since John F. Kennedy has ever been elected to the White House. Being a Senator requires voting on lots of issues and taking partisan positions which come back to haunt. John Kerry is no exception, and, in the coming campaign, Bush is going to outspend him, big time, on ads showing targeted voters how John Kerry has systematically opposed their best interest.

      FRESH CONSERVATIVE ARGUMENT AGAINST FREE TRADE  Conservatives who attack free trade are unfairly labeled isolationists and summarily discounted. Most on the right have accepted the libertarian argument for free trade, which says the law of supply and demand will extend beyond borders. While logical, this argument has nothing to do with reality-- we still live in a world of nation states-- where China, India, Japan, and the consolidated European Union-- reserves upon themselves the right to erect tarriffs to protect their industries and jobs.   Unilaterally, the United States tears down trade barriers without reciprocity. While consumers receive more options in the short-term, over time the economy weakens. Already, the United States has lost the aerospace, appliance, automobile, electronics, ship-building, steel, and textile. Comapnies take the opportunity free trade gives them to escape American labor unions, regulations, and taxes. Hence America becomes a country that no longer makes anything, including software. Can the service sector alone sustain superpower status?   Besides destroying the base of the economy, our trade policy is also having cultural effects. It is contributing to the decline of the family by causing the loss of the only jobs proven to allow one, non-college educated worker to earn enough to sustain an entire family. When two parents must work lesser-paying jobs, children are raised by television-- badly. Second, our trade policy has caused the decline of small town America, where one or two companies sustain a community of values. Main Street America, the heartland, has an inherent value that conservatives should be especially able to appreciate.   John Kerry is talking about lost jobs and outsourcing. President Bush, who caved on steel tarriffs and whose advisors talk about the positive effects of outsourcing, looks like he does not care. Adding insult to injury, he seeks to legalizes illegals from those countries which have taken the American jobs, so they can come here, and compete for whatever jobs remain. In attempting to win over Latino voters who have never have never voted Republican, he has alienates a wounded heartland, his base.   What is happening is neither compassionate nor conservative. In fact, conservatives have always been mixed on this issue. Many cite the pro-tarriff founding fathers, who wanted tarriffs to be the primary source of revenue for the government (under F.D.R.'s "leadership" this shifted to the income tax). Ronald Reagan used tarriffs to save Harley Davidson and other companies. Just because Bill Clinton rammed through NAFTA on Republican votes does not make free trade part of the conservative tradition.

      note: IT IS VERY EASY TO TAKE THE FOLLOWING ARGUMENT THE WRONG WAY, AND I AM NOT TRYING TO BE INSENSITIVE, BUT MERELY TO GET AT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER, WHICH IS ALMOST NEVER THE SIMPLE EXPLANATION. I REALIZE I MIGHT BE WRONG, BUT THIS IS MY BEST ATTEMPT TO GET IT.   THINK INTELLIGENTLY ABOUT JAPANESE "INTERNMENT"   When I was in seventh grade, my history teacher told me about how the Japanese were interned during WWII because of racism and wartime hysteria. While I wanted to seize the opportunity to blast the supposedly humane Roosevelts, it still made no sense to me that they would engage it racism and wartime hysteria; it made even less sense that Americans would simply let it happen. It turns out that my suspicions were justified. The reality is that the internment/relocation of Japanese during this period is more complicated than simplistic victim-mongers would suggest.   The Japanese were interned and relocated during WWII because U.S. interceptions of coded transmissions from Japan identified many spies living on the West Coast. Since arresting these spies would deprive us of a potentially life-saving code, many German, Italian, and Japanese were interned or, more often, told to leave the West Coast. Citizens were never targeted. The people sent away were enemy aliens (non-citizens of a warring country), kibei (young militarists educated in Japan), and renunciants (those who actually forsook American citizenship); the cluster of citizens affected by the policy were actually children of these groups. Like the children who live with their mothers in prison today, it was seen as more humane to allow the child to be with his or her mother. In other words, these child citizens were relocated and interned for their own good.   While what happened was certainly unfair to many, what happened was not nativism, racism, or wartime hysteria, but rather the only conceivable way to preserve a life-saving code and address the espionage it revealed.

      NIGHTLINE  I have been following the controversy over Sinclair Broadcasting refusing to air tonight's Nightline. They hold presenting the names and faces of fallen soldiers is inherently biased and antiwar. I disagree. Even though liberal bias on Nightline and elsewhere is a big problem, it does not mean properly honoring fallen soldiers is anything but appropriate, respectful, and patriotic.

      HOW WILL A MUSLIM CONSTITUTION CREATE A SECULAR IRAQ?    The Interim Constitution created by America and allies explicitly acknowledges the legitimacy of Islamic law and prohibits its violation. We cannot legitimize Islam and advance seculism all at once. The sad truth is that Americans die defending Muslim values, not secular values. Time to stand up and face that truth.

      READERS: I have gotten quite a few e-mails from people who found my blog via the Toomey Blog. I just want to say that Chris Lilik did a great job and his blog is one of the finest I have ever seen. Like the Toomey Meetup, it reached out to people in the way that many at the top cannot even fathom. Even after the election, when some people throw their hands up in despair, the Toomey Blog is still going and, I must confess I hope it continues, with its link to me of course. Seriously, I bet 99% of my new readers came from there, and I am thankful.

      WHAT EXACT IS, "THE WISDOM OF THE FOUNDERS?  Politicians often appeal to, "the wisdom of our founders" in vague ways. Since they were an imperfect and demographically singular group that has been gone for over two hundred years, I think it is important to know what exactly we appeal to when we appeal to their thought. The one core idea they all agreed on is this: Nobody is perfect. Since a government must be ruled by highly imperfect human beings, the only thing to do is create a framework where the role of government is inherently limited (it can't harm what it doesn't affect) and where checks and balances limit different parts of the government from gaining more power.   Without creating a new framework, our government today still chooses to violate the framework established by the founders in two big ways (1) It continues to expand the federal government to assume unenumerated powers in a manner unjustified by any meaning of the "necessary and proper" clause they articulated and (2) The balance of powers they established has been tipped in favor of the Judicial Branch, which they did not want to be the strongest. Broadly speaking, the kind of things the government does and the way it justifies its exercise of power totally contradicts the wisdom and intent of the founders.

      NO SENSE OF DECENCY  Conservative Republicans often fail in electoral quests today because they have forgotten the best arguments. Think about the way that they engage entitlement issues like the prescription drug program and Social Security: instead of challenging the flase premise of these programs-- that the federal government must care for the needy, they tinker around the edges-- they argue for tinkering around the edges of old programs and for somewhat limiting new ones. This approach is weak and not fundamentally different from what the Democrats do.   The real problem with these programs meant to care for the needy is that they are the total erosion of confidence in our own decency that we, as people, will not care for the needy. The government caring for the needy is an easy way out that allows people to look the other way, which they do out of convenience. Of course, poor people suffer because government solutions are expensive, inefficient, and run by self-perpetuating bureacracies of peopel who, like their fellow citizens, really do not care. It's no wonder we still have poverty after so much redistribution, so much spending, and so much evasion.    Those conservatives who seem to have ruled out appealing to a sense of decency are not thinking without some reason, however: There is no longer a prevailing sense of decency necessary for the libertarian approach.

      WHY ALMOST-WINNING MATTERS   Often political thinkers minimize the importance of "almost winning" elections by pointing out the loser ultimately wins no office. I would suggest, however, that it is not necessary to be victorious in order to be successful. In 1976, Ronald Reagan lost to Gerald Ford with 49% of the primary vote. When he brought the same conservative themes to America four years later, he overwhelmingly won the primary and the general. He said no to those who advised moderation and ultimately prevailed. When candidates listen to those who advise moderation, they lose the magic which made them popular and ultimately fail. In 1994, Ellen Sauerbrey won 49.7% of the vote to Paris Glendening. Believing she could broaden her base by moderating, she ran to the center, lost her base, and lost to Paris Glendening 44-56. Whether Pat Toomey will ultimately prevail depends on whether he abandons his nearly succcessful mesasge for dubious conventional wisdom moderation.

      WHAT ABOUT TERM LIMITS?   Before they gained their majorities in 1994, the G.O.P. used to strongly stand for term limits. Even Strom Thurmond said he wanted to stay in the Senate to fight for them. Though power may have seduced some Republicans in Congress, the need for a Constitutional Term Limits Amendment is no less. I offer two cases to prove my point:   (1) Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA)   Arlen Specter has served 24 years in the Senate, during which he has funneled an increasingly large number of federal pork barrell programs back home to Pennsylvania. If re-elected for a fifth term, he will continue to use his almost unmatched mastery of Senate rules to manipulate the party into backing his liberal agenda. He has used his incumbency to manipulate Pennsylvania's "endorsement system" and to raise huge sums of money for defending himself from even strong potential challengers. Senator Specter is so out-of-touch he now wears make-up before hitting the campaign trail.   (2) Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA)   In 1994, Senator Santorum became the youngest member of the Senate. He won on a platform that highlighted his support for a two-term, twelve-year term limit for members of Congress. Over the next ten years he employed his idealism to fight for the conservative cause. Recently, however, he has lost his sense of mission by supporting Arlen Specter (See Above).

      SPECTER ALMOST FALLS  Specter barely beat Toomey because President Bush and Rick Santorum supported Specter's candidacy from the first day to the last. Their un-Reganlike political calculation was that Toomey was too conservative to win. They went all out for a liberal who just spent  $10,000,000 to win his own party's nomination by 10,000 votes. Now Specter may very well lose to Joe Hoeffel as he previously almost lost to Lynn Yeakel. Even if this happens, trite conventional wisdom will blame conservatives for opposing the man who has opposed the Republican agenda for decades. That platform's best hope, however, is for Arlen to fall in November as another compensates elsewhere.

      JOHN KERRY IS NOT A WAR HERO    Even though John Kerry did not volunteer to go to Vietnam, he did go and serve with valor. Then he came back and threw his medals and/or ribbons to protest the Vietnam War. What he did was like a king renouncing his throne. When he went on television talk shows after the war, he acted not proud but ashamed of his service. He said that the people who did not serve were no better than him. Now that he is running for President, John Kerry wants his medals back. He cannot have them beceause his deliberate and symbolically significant actions say without a doubt that he no longer wanted to be honored as a veteran. In 1973, John Kerry told America loud and clear, "I DON'T WANT TO BE A WAR HERO." Thereforem, he cannot define himself as one in 2004.

      I always wondered where the crisis in higher education would ultimately lead. Never in my wildest dreams did I guess that we would regress to this extent:   Don't get me wrong-- I like Sesame Street. The show even helped me learn to count and master the entire alphabet-- skills without which I could not call myself educated. I like all the characters of Sesame Street, including especially Oscar the Grouch. There did come a town, however, when I went beyond learning that red is red and cows moo. Not at Villanova. Their Commencement Speaker is BIG BIRD. Now, I know Big Bird went to China and everything, but, really, doesn't this make you wonder: Is this the culmination of their $150,000 (after taxes) education? It's not as if I expect Villanova to get the Dalai Lama, but, really, weren't Bert and Ernie free?    I wish I was kidding. I really, really, really wish I was kidding.

      ONE-ISSUE VOTERS (LIKE TWO-, THREE-, AND FOUR-ISSUE VOTERS) MISS THE BIG PICTURE   I am not a one-issue voter. I am not even a two-issue voter or a three-issue voter. I will vote for the person who, overall, supports more of what I support and, just as important, opposes more of what I oppose. I disagree with lots of President Bush's foreign policy, I disagree with his Medicare Bill, and I disagree with what has happened to federal spending. However, I am not dumb enough to believe that John Kerry, who has always opposed the Balanced Budget Amendment and supported more entitlement spending, is the answer. President Bush, whatever his faults, is much stands agaisnt higher taxes, against liberal judges, against affirmative action, against U.N. control of American troops, for tort reform, for reforming social security, for missile defense, and for the death penalty.   This election is not just about the war, gay marriage, or any of the issues which, for one reason or another, dominate the news. 2004 is also about whether we are going to empower or limit unions, whether we are going to sit three more Antonin Scalias or Ruth Bader Ginsbergs. I cannot believe how many intelligent, college-educated people have a narrow view of what this election is about.

      BACK UP YOUR ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT, OR JUST GO ON BEING SHALLOW   An ad homonym attack is when you attack the person advancing an argument instead of the argument itself. By attacking straw men, little minds avoid big ideas. Unfortunately for them, many liberals and libertarians engage in ad homonym attacks against the, "religious right." Often lacking sufficient first principles to debate issues like abortion, euthanasia, stem-cell research, and the other topics of our time, they go with their gut instinct and mischaracterize the other side.   By definition, the Religious Right or "Christian Right" refers to anyone primarily motivated by religion or God and whose politics are right-of-center. To the extent that critics identify the religious right with any specificity, they tritely regurgitate Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, and the Christian Coalition. Never mind that both men are in a state of semi-retirement and the organization is basically non-existant. Critics always ignore William F. Buckley (author of, "Nearer, My God"), Cal Thomas, George Will, Robert Bork, Kenneth Starr, Peggy Noonan, Ronald Reagan, and other religiously motivated people whose arguments are far harder to engage. Far easier to take cheap shots at ignorant southerners and assume that is the extent of the other side.   As somebody who is not religious, I have always been amazed that some people like me fear the religious right. Why? Because they dare to argue that Roe v. Wade is poorly written? Actually, I suspect many, if not all, people who castigate the religious right have an unresolved, existensial angst which makes them want to avoid deeper things. Many of them, I reckon, have decided that there are some things which are just too hard to figure out (for them, at least), and it is much better to take the easy way out.   I am not saying the religious right should not be subject to criticism. Before you criticize, however, you ought to be able to answer a few basic questions:(1) Which organizations, politicians, clergy, and congregation(s) constitute the religious right? [an educated opponent of the religious right would be able to rattle of specific names and organizations in great detial] (2) Are all religiously motivated social conservatives part of the religious right? Are all politicians who vote socially conservative? What about people who throughtfully think through their positions and, through no fault of their own, wind up siding with ignorant people? (3) When did the religious right first start exerting its influence? What were the peaks and valleys of its power? Throughout its influence, what specific detrimental effects has the community or communities had on domestic policy making?   I ask these questions because I suspect people who invoke the term, "religious right," are being intellectually lazy to their own disadvantage.

      IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT AMAR WEISMAN'S FUTURE   I have made a decision. I will only learn from the finest conservative jurist in the country, Robert Bork. He is one of a handful of individuals who still knows how to interpret the Constitution.  Therefore, it is my intention to attend the University of Richmond School of Law. The Director of Admissions has offered me a conditional acceptance, conditioned on me retaking the LSAT on June 15-- this time exercising an option to receive double time-- and scoring three additional points. While I do not pretend that this will be very easy, I am almost sure that I will reach this goal (in case I do not reach this goal, however, I have placed a deposit on a safety school). I am not going to Pepperdine because of the Califonria lifestyle. I am not going to Villanova because it is not better than Richmond and, moreover, lacks sufficient conservative credentials. The law is not something to be learned from card-carrying, ACLU professors who believe the Pledge of Allegience is dangerous and whose favorite cause is freeing Mumia Abu Jamal. Richmond is a southern place-- good values, beautiful gardens, spectacular mansions, charming, southern belles, fine dining, and warm people. However, I am keeping my apartment in Washington because I an coming back. Now, it is back to studying for my favorite test. It is annoying, but doing this again is a small price to pay for a proper legal education.

      At the Iowa Straw Poll in 1995, Alan Keyes had just given a speech where he captured won the audience. For a moment, everybody from every other campaign just cheered as he talked about the moral degradation of our country. "We don't have money problems, we have moral problems," Dr. Keyes said, and everybody there knew he was right. Keyes may not have had a chance at winning the presidency, but he spoke to the heart and he made his point.   Then, Arlen Specter got onto the stage. A wiser liberal might have tried to find some-- any-- common ground with the audience, but, no, the malcontent liberal lawyer lectured rural Iowans about values. He said that he was running because he wanted to take the Republican Party back from the forces of hatred and intolerance, from those who "scapegaot immigrants" and "tread on the rights of women and minorities." He was saying that he (and his 20 supporters) were better than everyone, not because their policies made sense, but because they were tolerant and decent in the sense their opponents were not.   Senator Specter is not a man who respects his opponents and thoughtfully contributes to dialogue with well-founded centrist views. He hated those Iowa conservatives, he hated, hated, hated them-- he was mean, mean like he is mean to his staffers.  He wanted to exclude them from the party-- what a disrespectful ingrate. Now, eight years later, he is paying homage to conservatives and claiming to be one of them. He needs conservatives to keep his seat, so he can go on opposing tax cuts, so he can go on rallying for illegal immigrants, so he can go on blocking tort reform, so he can go on porking bills, so he can go on supporting racial quotas and set asides.   if Arlen Specter were starting all over again, he would not be a Republican. He is a relic, a relic who rose during pre-Reagan Nixonian gloom and, indeed, does not even deserve to walk in Pat Toomey's shadow.

      The Affirmative Action Register (http://www.aar-eeo.com/) provides links to jobs for which minority applicants are being sought. Employers, including universities and businesses, provde the Affirmative Action Register with lists of jobs for whom minority applicants are especially desirable. These jobs, by and large, have nothing to do with race-- they are not in Black Studies Dpeartments. This is dangerous, it comes close to being a set-aside. Can whites apply? If you are not a minority, and you apply for such a position, you are not what they really want-- your ethnic stock won't score you any points.

      Ronald Smith, the WBAL radio talk show host for whom I once interned, said this is his Friday column, "A year after the invasion of Iraq it’s almost impossible for anyone but a neocon or a fool to believe that things are going to eventually work out quite so cheerily as we were told they were by the war planners in Washington." Our informed opinion of the war, Ron reminds us, should be based on experience.   Once Ron said he would much rather attack a pizza than Iraq, and this makes much more sense to me. I have ordered a deep dish Chicago Classic from Uno's-- unlike the war zone, my pizza is going to produce pleasure, help the economy, and, since it includes ccertain items banned by hard-line Muslims, actually help defeat radical Islam.    To stay wise and informed, be sure to read Ron's "Something to Say" commentary: http://www.wbal.com/commentary/smith/

      WHERE ARE THE BIG GUYS?   On April 19, shortly before the April 27 primary, President Bush and Rick Santorum-- two men who brag about their conservatism-- will stand beside cranky old liberal Arlen Specter, now on political life support.   This is sad, because Specter and Bush are known for their guts. Rick Santorum, recall, led the lonely fight against partial-birth abortion, fighting the lonely fight against Arlen, Bill, Hillary, and the abortion industry. Maybe that Santorum is on vacation for a little while, hopefully he will come back.   Why do Bush and Santorum stand up for Specter? Perhaps Specter agreed not to filibuster the Bush legislative agenda. Maybe Rick and Arlen became friends in the intimate Senate chamber. Or, more likely, they invoked the damn, trite "follow your heart"/"follow your mind" dichotomy, and concluded the man of their conscience, Toomey, was pre-destined to fail. Too bad Toomey is just about tied with Specter right now, and, indeed, leads because undecided voters always overwhelmingly favor the challenger.   Republicans have made dumb endorsements before. In 1994, Mayor Giuliani (R) endorsed Mario Cuomo  (D) against George Pataki (R) for Governor. When Pataki won by ten points, nine points better than he polled the day before, and twenty-nine points better than a month before, Giuliani paid for his calculation; only terrorism would bring Rudy and George together.   Toomey is a generous man; on election night, he will probably give Bush and Santorum a way out (he might even thank Arlen for his years of "public service"). Truth be told, however, those who hazarded a risk will be rewarded-- they will be winners and feel like winners-- and the gutless ones will feel like the losers, exactly as they deserve.

      IF YOU WANT TO MAKE AMERICA SAFER, DO THE FOLLOWING:   - Build a missle defense system. No conventional or nuclear missile will ever harm an American city, ever, under any, any circumstances.   - Close off our border with Canada and Mexico (they might escape from Iraq and come here)   - Thoroughly search all American-bound foreign cargo, with no exceptions   - Quadrouple the number of human intelligence agents in the Arab world

      AMAR REJECTS WAR IN IRAQ!!!  650 Americans are dead, thousands wounded, and tens of thousands of unknown Iraqis are gone too. The war costs $100 billion per year. The region is increasingly unstable. OPEC has raised gas prices to over $2 per gallon. Coalition members, including Spain and Kazakhstan, no longer want to fight the unprecedented Sunni-Shia coalition, of two groups who have always hated one another now united in their hatred of us.   We are not a trusted nation-builder because the Muslim world distrusts us. We have coddled the decadent Saudi royal family, hoisted upon Iran two corrupt Shahs, backed and bribed the corrupt dictators of Pakistan and Egypt, backed Saddam against Iran, Osama against the Soviets, and, most recently, warlords against the people in Afghanistan. Furthermore, we have almost always stood for Israel against the Palestinians no matter what the mitigating circumstances. This is our regional resume-- and it is not enough for them to trust us to steward democracy.   We have facilitated the anti-American Muslim tide Osama wanted. We have unified the Muslim world against us. Usama knows how the Middle East feels about America. He probably guessed we would respond to his attacks by wanting to kick ass in Arabia, in a way that would offend Arab Street, and they would turn to people like him. Every Iraqi we kill-- solider or civilian, has family, friends, neighbors, and Muslim breathren. Some will want revenge, and they will seek it by coming to America (if not already here), to bomb our buildings, subways, and places we love. Eventually, somebody is going to get a real nuclear weapon, and then the bad stuff begins.   We predictably responded to 9/11 with an emergency mentality that is imprudent in its response to challenge. After conquering Afghanistan and overthrowing the Taliban, we needed to something, anything. We invented a series of mythologies to tranform an old enemy, regional aggressor Saddam Hussein, into a terrorist. We started by saying he had weapons of mass destruction. Finding none, we said he financed Al-Quada. Finding no evidence, we said that he himself was a weapond of mass destruction-- he gases his own people and fills mass graves. However, the only gaseous massacre ever documented occurred at Halabja, smack in the middle of a war zone wherein both Iran and Iraq used chemical weapons. Furthermore, the mass graves are not new, but up to fifty years old. Nothing we have found has proved or even substantiated that invading Iraq was an appropriate response to 9/11.   Since there was no job to do, there is no job to finish. We are not reducing terrorism, acquiring colonies, winning land, making friends, or protecting an oil industry that would not otherwise exist. We are not liberators and everybody knows the people are not parading, singing, and dancing as if we were. We cannot establish democracy because democratic movements come from the people, not Paul Bremmer. We should leave, now, and use this as a cornerstone to establish a new policy based on neutrality to Israel and non-intervention. For the first time in a long time, we might quell, not create, conflict.

      PROVING CONVENTIONAL WISDOM WRONG. . . AGAIN   AMERICA IS SOCIALLY CONSERVATIVE, FISCALLY LIBERAL   Two meaningful polls suggest Americans are socially conservative. One poll suggests America is pro-life:   * CBS asked registered voters whether people support (a) generally available to those who want it (b) available, but under stricter limits than now or (c) not be permitted at all. If you are "socially liberal," then you want answer (a). If you are socially conservative, then you want to restrict abortion more, and you want (b) or (c). 62% of Americans want to limit abortion more. 37% want stricter limits and 25% want no abortion whatsoever. Compared to the 62%, a puny, puny, puny, paltry, tiny, 36% want abortion to be generally available. If you want to say that America-- or American women-- are generally pro-choice, then you are wrong because the inclination of Americans-- and American women-- is to restrict abortion more than now.   The other poll suggests that America hates gay marriage:    60% of American adults want to Amend the Constitution to prohibit gay marraige. 78% of Republicans 57% of Democrats, and 49% of those aged 18-29 want to change the founding document just to stop gays from getting married. Also, for those of you who see so much hope in the 18-29 demographic, just remember that they will just get older and more conservative, and, even now, more of them want to change the Constitution than not.   But how would this pro-life, anti-gay-marriage America feel about limiting government? We all know there is little support for cutting Social Security, little support for cutting Medicare, little support for cutting Education, and little support for repealing the prescription drug benefit. If America was really fiscally conservative, it would not  and little support for cutting environmental protection. If America were really fiscally conservative, it would want to cut these middle class entitlements.   Truth be told, most Americans-- Middle America-- wants a nanny state that polices the bedroom.

      BALTIMORE  We all come from somewhere. Some people run from home, but, frankly, I think we must always remember our roots. I come from Baltimore. I could not be more proud. Granted the Orioles have not finished a good season in a long time, the Mayor is awful, and the rush hour is not getting shorter. Yet the charm of Charm City draws incredible loyalty from those who know it, and, though I may have wavered from time to time, I must say that Baltimore might be the greatest city in America. Stroll through historic Little Italy, visit its excellent educational institutions, boat through the bay, or just relax and eat crabs-- its all an authentic, good time. I just wanted to write this entry of hometown love as a thank you, to Baltimore, and its faithful sister city, Kawasaki, Japan.

      CHINA REPRESSING HONG KONG   Remember the transfer of power over Hong Kong from Britain to China in 1999? Among the liberal elite, there was a palpable sense of jubilation, that perhaps the presence of Hong Kong in the Chinese empire might bring about mainland change. Nobody predicted the nevertheless predictable actual outcome-- that China would seek to destroy and repress Hong Kong. Thus far, it has sought to undermine elections, sailed army ships into the Hong Kong Harbor, and actively cracked down on free speech. Far from those who hold that China is "wakening," what I notice is that things are not really changing, that even if the Chinese government seeks industrial and commerical development, there is almost no commitment on the part of its government to really changing, ergo Hong Kong.

      GHOSTS OF THE OLD RIGHT DIE HARD   President Bush's amnesty proposal was a disaster. Bush made one televised attempt, one very naive attempt to pander to the Hisapanic vote that he will surely lose. Meanwhile, most Americans dislike illegal immigration, because they know it represents the breakdown of the rule-of-law and they know exponential numbers of newcomers cannot be assimilated.  As a Republican, I hope the issue will not sink the President.   Perhaps there is a way to teach the President a lesson. . .   There are three establishment Republicans, Jim Kolbe (especially beloved inside the beltway for his homosexual lifestyle), Jeff Flake, and Chris Cannon. Each of these men supported amnesty. Each face a primary challenger running primarily on the amensty issue. If each falls a desperate fall, their fall will serve as a reminder to those who hold pandering to liberal Latino organizations is a smart political move.   Mr. Cannon, who represents rural Utah, is the Mexican-American Legal Defense Fund's Legislator of the Year. Considered a rising star in the Republican party,  he outspent his Republican challenger, Matt Throckmorton, 18-to-1, yet was not renominated at the state convention. Should he lose the runoff, his fall might make the Capitol Hill wake up to the harsh reality that America does not want their corny, pandering ploys.   Oh, one more thing-- all the aforementioned seats are safe Republican districts, so the "infighting" won't lead to Democratic gains. It's all in good fun.

      BUSH'S BIKE FALL REVEALS BETTER CHARACTER THAN KERRY'S   The two Presidential candidates, John Kerry and George Bush, both recently fell from their bikes.   On a four-mile bike ride through residential Boston, John Kerry fell from his bike. When he fell, he appeared visibly disturbed, angry-- his false pride was shattered and he wanted to hide. He is not the kind of man who can deal with a public blunder. He despearately wants us to believe in his perfection. This reaction was not unlike what happened when he was snowboarding. Kerry fell, he screamed profanities, and blamed a secret service agent who was trying to protect him. Judging from these snippets of how he responds to life's little falls, we have good reason to question Kerry's character.   In contrast, George Bush was on a challenging 17-mile, semi-mountainous trail ride when he fell and suffered bruises to his body and cuts to his face. What did he do? He got up, smiled, and rode the rest of the way home (Kerry did not take himself home after either fall). No French, unmanly whimpers from Dubya.   Look, we all know people who deal with "life's little falls" like Kerry and Bush, respectively. I know what kind of man I respect.

      JOHN KERRY CAUSED THE DEFICIT   It is simply not possible to be for balanced budgets but against the Balanced Budget Amendment, which merely makes balanced budgets necessary (except in times of emergency/now would not qualify). John Kerry now criticizes President Bush for soaring deficits, yet he cast the deciding vote against the Balanced Budget Amendment-- TWICE-- in 1995 and 1997. If John Kerry had voted yes, the Amendment would have passed both houses of Congress, and very likely would have been ratified by the states (given that all but a few state legislatures are bound by similar measures and given its widespread public support). Yet John Kerry voted no, making deficits possible, not impossible. He voted no-- he voted for deficits in principle-- because he feared it would require cuts in social programs, which is probably true. What he and the Democrats will never realize is that they cannot have their bloated entitlements and balanced budget at the same time, without neautering the military, which seems unwise now.   The deficit is John Kerry's weakness and, played correctly, President Bush's strength.

      LAST YEAR'S GEORGETOWN COMMENCEMENT WAS A SUCCESS  Last year Cardinal Francis Arinze spoke to my graduating class at Georgetown. He admonished us that serious religion, the traditional family, and moral fortitude are all necessary for living a good life. He criticized secularism, homosexuality, abortion, euthanasia, and other liberal cultural influences as bad foundations for society and our own lives. He was criticized for his insensitivity and Georgetown apologized to families of graduating students. It was seen as a disaster. The truth, however, is that I remember the speech at my Commencement address, whereas most graduates do not. They heard the usual, "go out into the world, follow your dreams. . ." and forgot it summarily. Arinze had something substantive and memorable to say, and, therefore, he was a success.

      ONLY BAN WHITE KIDS FROM TANNING  Some California legislators, seeking to reduce skin cancer, want to ban minors from using tanning beds. The problem is that many California minors, including especially brown Hispanics, have virtually no risk of contracting skin cancer. Almost all people people who acquire skin cancer are very white. Why stop kids with darker skin, who may substantially benefit from tanning, for no good reason. Is this just another stupid cost of equality for its own sake? Of course it is. We are obsessed with equality, so obsessed we will impose it even when it is not reasonable.

The Iraqi National Congress, which he leads, stood with the Bush Administration against Sadham Hussein. There was even talk that he was the right man to lead Iraq. He is no longer America's friend. What happened? Why are we now turning away from Chalabi and begging Ba'thist Generals to take the reins? I would suggest that this war cannot even make sense to those waging it.

      SUE THE HOMELESS   I am sick and tired Georgetown bums rudely demanding money-- demanding money to make them fatter, more drunk, and even less productive. Many cannot take "no" for an answer, but instead reserve the right to respond rudely to noncontribution. They violate laws against panhandling, public health codes, fire codes, and, we might surmise, the federal imperative to pay income taxes. If the city can unleash hordes of heartless meter-maids to target Georgetown parkers, why can't it at least help reisdents who are entitled to live in a decent community without these eyesores; THE CITY OWES US BUM REMOVAL! Take them somewhere, perhaps to jail, so they can pay for their crime(s) to society.   Unfortunately, the electoreate that gave Washington Marion Barry will never elect anyone like Giuliani. Hence leadership must come from the grassroots. Time to establish a legal defense organization for small business owners to help them defend themselves against aggressive bums who endanger customers.

      PARENTS, NOT MCDONALDS, MADE THE CHILDREN FAT   Some people blame fast food chains for making children fat. Others point to school cafeterias. Explanations like these are crafted by tort lawyers who help parents evade responsibility.  If we are serious about keeping the youth fit and trim, we ought to look at what really causes fat children:   VALUE CONSCIOUSNESS: Parents often prod their offspring to finish what is on the plate merely because its contents have been purchased, and throwing it away would supposedly be akin to throwing money away (where any economist will tell you that perfect efficiency is impossible). This disconnects eating with hunger and forces children who aren't hungry to gorge themselves. Additionally, value-consciousness creates demand for supersized portions. Since McDonald's cannot be faulted for supplying demand like this, the real problem is modern imperative to have greater quantities at cheaper prices for its own sake.   WORLD HUNGER CONCERNS: When parents tell their children to eat what is on their plate because people are starving (a notion too often perpetuated in liberal churches), they ignore geopolitics and reason. It implies an impoverished child living in some country like Bangladesh would actually have received the food otherwise. Oversupply in one part of the world almost always has no effect on a lack elsewhere. Frankly, our children should not worry about impoversished starvers like this.   ENTRY OF WOMEN INTO WORKFORCE: Making no value judgment, we all know the home-cooked meals prepared by stay-at-home moms was generally more nutritious than the fast food which replaced such meals today. Perhaps instead of blaming the mere existence of McDonalds we ought to blame the tangible decline of family cooking and dining.

      PC's ARE NOT ONLY CRUDE, THEY ARE CRUEL   Ever since I started using a Macintosh four years ago, my life has been better. I have always hated PC's. They are crude, ugly, loud, graphically inferior, tend to crash, not intuitive, slow, ugly ugly things. They may keep I.T. professionals in business, but they leave most frustrated. On the other hand, Macintoshes are pretty, intuitive, lighting fast, graphically superior, and approach perfection in almost every way. Whenever I look into my 20-inch Cinema Screen, hear my Soundsticks or iPod, gaze into my iSight, or fure up my fast 12-inch Powerbook, I thank God I am not using a PC. Been there, done that, it sucked. That is why nobody ever goes from a Mac back to a PC unless compelled by force.   However, all law schools require that students have laptop computers but no law schools offer Mac support. When I go to law school, I ahve to get a PC, and this the mere idea makes me sick, sicker perhaps than the thought of President Ted kennedy. I hope and pray the world abandons PC's for Macintoshes by August, or else I will have to heed that annoying voice who said, "Dude, you're getting a Dell." Uggghhh.

"modern democratic societies tend to promote a limited conception of the good-life: the one-dimensional materialism of middle class society. . . a society dominated by the prosaic activities of material production and consumption, usually in the sterile atmosphere of an urban office building and impersonal suburb, where the chief obsessive concerns of people are economic security and status. . ."

      PROBLEM WITH DEMOCRACY #1    "In a democratic age, the great monuments of high culture lose their appeal, except as objects in a museum. The noblest achievements of Western civilization-- such as classical philosophy and poetry as well as classical art and architecture; the culture of the High Middle Ages, including Gothic architecture and Latin scholastisim; great modern music from Bach to Handel; as well as the whole tradition of liberal arts education-- seem too artistocratic or too 'high brow,' too judgmental and demeaning, for most people in a democratic society. Not only do the masses of people feel justified in ignoring them, but the educated elites themselves lose confidence in their enduring value and treat them with irony and contempt, becoming corrupt elites with a mission to subvert or deconstruct high culture. The strongest pressures in a democratic age are always downward from high culture toward popular entertainment, which originally meant replacing aristocratic and religious culture with middle-class and working-class culture but now means sinking to the lowest common denominator of the rebellious avant-garde and raucous youth culture, often of the crudest kind. . . a dramatic cultural revolution has occurred. The net result is to lower the overall spiritual and moral tone of society and thereby diminish human dignity by discrediting the highest aspirations of the human soul. This trend has been accurately described as the 'leveling' effect of modern democracy."  Given Problem #1, the leveling effect, we cannot be so quick to impose it on others.

      NEOCONSERVATIVE VERSUS PALEOCONSERVATIVE  Ever since about 1900, the American conservative movement has been shaped by paleoconservatives and neoconservatives, repsectively. Each school of conservative thought has different premises and principles. I think the best way to see the difference is to look at how each understands power and democracy. I would argue that during the before, during, and after the Cold War each developed an understanding of power and democracy which has shaped their different opinions of Iraq today.   Paleoconservatives hold as the core of their philosophy a distrust of power, itself rooted in a belief that human nature is fundamentally flawed, so as to preclude selfless cooperation. Since men rule men, government power must be limited, limited as closely as possible to the way described in the Federalist Papers about the Constitution. Realizing that something must order society if not hte government, paleoconservatives look to religion, traditional Judeo-Christian morality, and established organizations and institutions. These, in turn, provide counterbalances to government power.   While neocosnervatives do not overtly disagree with traditional conservatives on power, their philosophy, as it was founded and as it continues today, holds as its premise democracy itself, whose righteousness they hold is self-evident. The founders of neoconservatism were largely Jewish ex-Communists, who, following dissilusionment with Communism, palced democracy on the same pedestal Communism once occupied. These neoconservatives, who hold democracy is and end in and off itself, sahped the philosophical development of publications like  Human Events and the National Review into what they are today.   Whereas the core modus operandi of paleoconservatives is a distrust in power, and the chief desire that to limit the use and expansion of power, the neoconservatives have shown they believe the expansion of democracy to be so important so as to justify its imposition by force, which is what we see in Iraq today.   My explanation, of course, is incomplete, but I would say, at the end of the day, the way to understand the difference between these two is to fully examine what each respective side holds is the most important thing: expanding democracy for its own sake or limiting the exercise of power given human nature. While both of these viewpoints may be incomplete to explain everything about each side, I would argue it does fully explain what each seeks to do to and with the world today.

      BLUE-CHIP ISSUES COULD/SHOULD MAKE COMEBACK   The Blue Chip Domestic issues, I would say, are abortion, affirmative action, crime/gun control, illegal immigration, and tax policy. These are the core of American politics. They both motivate the bases and scare the wimpy insiders of both parties. While the insiders would rather debate whose prescription drug plan is better, we all know that-- come election day-- Blue Chip issues (and, perhaps, foreign policy) will sway the election.   The good news for the Republicans is that they do well on these time-tested issues, which logically fit into the overall cosnervative philosophy. The Republican victories in 1980 and 1994 were both won when the party took strong stands on the Blue Chips. The problem, however, is that "Compassionate Conservatism" weakens the party by precluding tough positions on these issues.   Consider affirmative action. In an effort to reach out to blacks, Republicans have shut up about affirmative action, which is not popular with any Americans except blacks, who, incidentally, vote in smaller propertions than their white counterparts. They voted 90% Democrat in 2000 and anyone who thinks 2004 will be different is naive. Even J.C. Watts has left elected office and become a lobbyist. Despite the hopelessness of the cause, the compassionate orthodoxy still dictates not using this important issue, which incidentally gets to the heart of equality itself.   Consider illegal immigration. The effort to reach out to Hispanics failed in 2000. George Bush, who spoke Spanish and pandered, got a smaller percentage of the Hispanic vote than Bob Dole in 1996. In 2002, Democrats gained ground wherever Latino voters voted, like in New Mexico and Arizona. The only non-Cuban Hispanic in Congress, Henry Bonnilla, is getting too old to still be a rising star. Overall, having the Republican orchestra incessently play the Hispanic overture has not worked, is not working, and will not work. Yet Americans always have and always will oppose illegal immigrant, which is wrong and ought to be stopped. The issue is ripe for the picking, and Republicans should reap the harvest and tell the wimpy compassionate types to go take a hike to Tiajuana.   George Bush needs to learn a lesson from his father, who struck political gold with Willy Horton. Better to weaken your opponent by exposing his liberalism and not worry about offending people (who, frankly, should not be offended because playing such issues is racist/nativist like liberals say) who won't vote Republican anyway. Karl Rove needs to talk to Lee Atwater's ghost.

      JUST BUILD A NORMAL PRISON!!!!   Prisons should not be like Abu Gharib. They should not be so small, so tortuous, so primevil-- they should not be that backward. Prisons should not be like Holiday Inns either-- with television, gyms, telephones (except for that one phone call you get to call a lawyer), and basketball courts. Why can't we get prisons just right, where they are humane but criminally boring?

      MANNY MIRANDA ARTICLE   Lessons of Memogate:The Senate Republicans' Tin Ear  By Manuel Miranda CNSNews.com Commentary  May 07, 2004  In this week's Weekly Standard , Executive Editor Fred Barnes contemplates the unthinkable: a return of the Senate to Democrat hands.  The bitterest political moment I ever experienced was the defeat of George H.W. Bush to my Georgetown fraternity brother Bill Clinton. It was bitter, not because the evening news did Bush in; not because the Bush organization fizzled; it was bitter because Bush's supporters lost hope and enthusiasm. They were not confident in the president. They thought he had a tin ear.  In 1996, Bob Dole likewise failed to connect with the allies he needed to get out the vote.  In fact, had Dole won just 2 percent more of active Catholic voters alone, he would have won the election.  Each of these elections proved that the enthusiasm of the Republican base and GOP attention to marginal issues does matter. This was proven again in the 2002 election, where the margin of voters who identified themselves as single-issue, pro-life voters was larger than the Republican margin of victory in three states. Were it not for the pro-life vote that came out in Georgia, Missouri and Minnesota, Republicans would not have won control of the Senate.  So what, then, do we make of Barnes' sobering assessment? Considering that the Republican base is currently disgusted with Senate Republicans, Republicans should be concerned. But beyond the disgust itself, it's even worse that GOP senators appear to have a tin ear to the current dissatisfaction.  Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter's defeat of Republican challenger Rep. Pat Toomey in last week's primary (50.8 percent to 49.2 percent, with overseas votes not yet counted) has left a bitter taste. But one could see this coming; the division between GOP senators who referred to helping "Arlen" -- and their staffs, who volunteered their weekends to help Toomey defeat "Specter" -- was startling.  On the morning after the election, Pennsylvania's junior Republican Sen. Rick Santorum was introduced to speak to 1,000 people at the inaugural National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington's Mayflower Hotel. About 100 people left the room, while others heckled Santorum with jeers of "Chairman Specter.'" (Specter is in line to be the next Judiciary Committee chairman).   It wasn't pretty. But it got worse when we saw that Santorum was oblivious to the palpable anger. Later that day, the senator has told several people, he got a call from his mother who gave him an earful.  One Pennsylvania pro-lifer described the Bush-Santorum support for Specter this way: "The only difference between a Democrat and a Republican is that a Democrat will stab you in the front."  But one cannot lose hope. One hopes the Bush-Cheney calculation was correct and that Specter voters will come out for Bush in November.  As someone betrayed by Republican colleagues, I understand that Santorum felt a personal sense of loyalty to Specter, who has stood by him. Conservatives should value personal loyalty and, in fact, demand it.  The truth is that Specter will be a better chairman of Senate Judiciary Committee than Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) has been, when it comes to shepherding the president's nominees.  Specter has promised that he will move judicial nominees like clockwork with no discretion as to timing for hearings or floor votes. Currently, Hatch is holding up more of the president's circuit court nominees than the Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), and he's obviously not doing the White House any favors with his unwillingness to stop the savaging of nominee Brett Kavanaugh in a hearing last week.  Exit polls show that the judicial issue played a decisive role in Specter's near-defeat. People fear that six years of a Specter Judiciary Committee chairmanship will mean six years of more surrender to Democrat bullying and histrionics -- even worse than what we have had.  For nearly a decade, we've lived with the lesser of two evils: Hatch -- another Pennsylvanian who later moved to Utah and became an instant conservative -- first practiced law in Pittsburgh, where he was a liberal Democrat.  The profitable industry that has grown up around the obstruction of judicial nominees would not be what it is today, if it were not for Arlen Specter's populist votes against Jeff Sessions (now a senator from Alabama) and Robert Bork (as in "borking") in the 1980s, or Hatch's kick-me-again leadership.  Those early liberal victories were the playground where today's highly paid judge-killers first shaped their career plans.   Hatch's recent role in Memogate, coming at the sad end of his chairmanship, shows how the bullies he calls friends have been emboldened over the years. Specter, it is feared, will make Hatch look like a winner.  For three years, Hatch repeatedly warned Americans that Democrats were in the pocket of liberal special interest groups in their unprecedented obstruction of President Bush's judicial nominees. Hatch's alarm was so compelling that a National Review cover displayed Leahy sitting as chairman -- connected to puppet strings hanging above him.  Last year, Senate Republicans led by Santorum argued that Miguel Estrada, the first judicial nominee ever filibustered, was being blocked by Democrats for no other reason than that he was Hispanic.  On the day that Estrada withdrew, Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) made the case with surgical precision. Democrats, he said, were intent on preventing Bush from having a qualified Hispanic serving on an appellate court that the president could elevate to the Supreme Court, should a vacancy arise.  How can one then understand the surrender of Senate Republicans in the Memogate affair? When presented with proof that liberal special interest groups were so much in control of Senate Democrats that they actually cast votes on what judicial nominee should get a hearing and who should be rejected, who could have imagined that Hatch would lead the charge to surrender?  When presented with Democrat memos stating that Estrada was blocked "because ... he is Latino" (Democrats did not want to repeat their mistake in confirming Clarence Thomas to a lower court, thus setting him up for the U.S. Supreme Court), who could imagine that Republicans would not only retreat but burn their crops as they went?  Adding insult to self-inflicted injury, as a reward for collaborating with Democrat obstruction in Memogate, Daschle promptly promised Republicans that no more appellate court confirmations would occur this year.  The frustration of Republicans across the country over Memogate is well known to me, since I was the wounded staffer abandoned in the Republican retreat. It is also understandable. We know that Frist has a Republican majority, but not a conservative majority solid enough to defeat the Democrat filibusters. We accept that.   But Memogate was a skirmish Republicans could have won. It was an opportunity misunderstood by key staffers who are more skilled at keeping the trains running on schedule than interested in their senators' reputations.  The essence of the Republican surrender was not just the abandonment of loyal staff; it was the submission to the word "improper." Democrats seized on Hatch's early judge-and-jury statement that the reading of the memos had been improper.  By bowing to Hatch's ill-advised leadership on the propriety of reading the Democrat memos, Republicans rendered themselves emasculated from investigating the corruption evidenced in the Democrat memos themselves - those made public and the hundreds of others still under wraps.  Hatch's prideful need to be right, even with the use of whisper campaigns to keep his colleagues under rein, was more than surrender. Other senators were forced to abandon the field entirely.  Hatch told Frist that if I resigned my position, Democrats would be assuaged. The matter would end. It didn't. Hatch told me that if I resigned, he would return the focus to the substance of the memos. He didn't.  Frist told conservative leaders that having me resign would be best for me. It wasn't. Nor was it best for my young family. Frist told conservative leaders, as did other Republican senators, Jon Kyl and Jeff Sessions, the line that Hatch had fed them - that the investigation would find an illegal hacking. It didn't.  Hatch told me that my resignation would be best for Frist. As I warned, it hasn't been. Frist lost reputation with the people that Hatch holds in contempt but that Frist does not.  Frist was duped. A few conservative leaders inside the beltway also allowed themselves to be duped because, at the end, Washingtonians are easily seduced by the access that gives status. But one has to forgive well-meaning people who are duped.  Throughout Memogate, Hatch cleverly prevented colleagues from contradicting him, preventing them from arguing what they came to know: that the reading of nonconfidential Democrat documents on an unprotected computer server was not improper -- because it was not illegal, was not contrary to Senate rules, and was not a violation of any applicable code of ethics.   As one computer security expert wrote, this affair wasn't Memogate, it was Memogate-less: Democrats' gross negligence had made their memos available as if they had been left "in the Capitol rotunda."  Some GOP senators, like Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, blindly followed Hatch's lead in "defecting" to the Democrats, and then acted outraged when The Hill newspaper called it a defection. But one can understand that these senators did not give the matter any thought. And in Graham's case, it must be time-consuming to be the junior senator from MSNBC.  But here again, the tin ear. Hatch led Frist and others to a point where no one was listening to how their surrender was playing with the Republican base. And it wasn't playing well.   I do admit that reading Democrats' documents on an unprotected server to help defend the president's embattled nominees was political hardball, and I have learned that one shouldn't play hardball with a limp-wristed team captain.   It is also important that teammates not have tin ears. Tin ears lose elections.

      WHO WOULD MAKE A GOOD SECRETARY OF DEFENSE?   Until 1996, Sam Nunn was the Senior Democratic Senator from Georgia and Chirman of the Armed Services Committee, where he was hawkish but smart. He spearheaded Nunn-Goldwater, which modernized the military to win the Cold War, and Nunn-Lugar, which aimed to reduce weapons of mass destruction nearly two decades before doing so became cool. Above all, Sam Nunn was respected by Republicans and Democrats, for both his intellect and his honesty.   I think he would make a great Secretary of Defense, because he and Colin Powell together could deliver the change of strategy necessary to better the Iraq situation. Although he was crucial to winning the Cold War, I think Sam Nunn can also go beyond the mentality that outlasted the conflict. Appointing Nunn is also politically smart and would go a long way to winning Bush re-election.

      (NEW AND IMPROVED)   ONE GOOD THING   Anything the United States can do to weaken the strength of the United Nations is good because the UN has a history of stifling American foreign policy goals. While the value of particular goals is debatable, it shoudl offend all Americans that this organization opposes whatever benefits us.   The United Nations gives a loud voice to weak and jealous nations who dominate the General Assembly, rule crucial committees, concoct binding conventions, and produce Secretary Generals like Kofi Annan. How can the United States possibly profit from a setup that gives small powers the capacity to come together and overtake the superpower?   The UN effectively weakens America's status as a superpower by enacting convetnions, like the Kyoto Protocol, which impose strict environmental controls on American industry while exempting the third-world industries in China and India. In addition, many so-called Human Rights Conventions, like Rights of the Child Convention, which would weaken our economy by making socialist social spending (directed at "the children") imperative.  Worst of all, the UN undermines the sovereign American judiciary by creating the International Criminal Court (ICC) which, by attempting to do things like pre-empt the American judiciary from imposing the death penalty, effectively undermines America's right to make our own laws. Instead we empower judges from third-world countries run by tropical gangsters to undermine the American judiciary, which they would do given the combination of spite and liberal agenda.  The only justification for the UN's existence has been humanitarianism. Yet the UN ho-hummed through the last Rwandan genocide and it would ho-humm through the next one. We now know the top officials at the UN would rather loot the Oil-for-Food program than deliver food to the hungry. Now that we know where its heart is, and since we have always known it has been head-strong against America, perhaps we now have the last justification necessary to let the organization die.

      THEY AREN'T READY   Conservatives, by and large, wrongly predicted the outcome of the war. They predicted the destruction of chemical, nuclear, and biological weapons in addition to the factories which produce them and the distribution systems funnelling them to Al-Quada and other terrorist organizations. They also predicted liberating crowds of Iraqis who, like America's founding fathers and the Boston Tea Partiers, thirst for freedom and representative government. The reality is a population ranging from hostile to indifferent. Unexpected consequences of the war may include empowering the United Nations, electing John Kerry, and making it more difficult to really fight the War on Terror by building a missile defense, sealing off the border, arming all pilots, screening all cargo, and cracking down on militant Islam in America.   Conservatives misunderstood Iraq because they forgot that their own intellectual tradition, including De Tocqueville, Edmund Burke,  Russell Kirk, and others. Wheras modern orthodoxy holds that human beings are simply pre-wired for democratic governance, they held democracy requires an informed electorate, a tradition of property ownership, self-governing institutions, a citizenry with virtues like prudence, and established norms so people can control what the government cannot. While it would be wrong to say that the people of Iraq cannot ever potentially have all of these things, or should not have all of these things, the truth is that they do not have all of these things, and blind faith that democracy will work wherever tried will not give them all of these things.

      HUH?   “A philosophic system is an integrated view of existence. As a human being, you have no choice about the fact that you need a philosophy. Your only choice is whether you define your philosophy by a conscious, rational, disciplined process of thought and scrupulously logical deliberation — or let your subconscious accumulate a junk heap of unwarranted conclusions, false generalizations, undefined convictions, undigested slogans, unidentified wishes, doubts and fears, thrown together by chance.”  People who believe they can put remarks down because they are "philosophical" are really the smallest minds of them all.

      LOW-CALIBER/MEDIOCRE/SECOND RATE   Recent stories and photographs prove Americans violated the human rights of Iraqi prisoners. Reading this is sickening and makes me wonder how low-caliber soldiers capable of doing these things were given the public trust of being soldiers. Part of my question is answered by an ex-Navy officer named Katie, who left the Navy because of the kinds of people with whom she served.   * Nearly 40% of soldiers serve only after given the option of military or prison  * There's NO college or HIGH SCHOOL requirement!  * There are NO intelligence tests, NO background checks, and NO character assessments   This gives rise to a culture of mediocrity so mediocre-- so "down to earth"-- that exceptional soldiers are ostracized as soon as they show any sign of being exceptional. The mediocre people destroy them for their virtue and drive them away. I think the military should be filled with thoughtful, chivilrous knights. Unfortunately, we cater to the lowest common demominator and loosers whose idea of a fun time is torturing a human being.    ***** Note: I am not referring to the Navy SEALS, Green Berets, or any great soldiers, be they inside or outside the special forces.*****

      DO IT!   Having avoided idiotically nominating Dean, Democrats are now poised to shoot themselves in the other foot. Senator Clinton is being floated as a potential veep. To win, Democrats need to win some states Bush carried in 2000. However, Hillary won't help deliver West Virginia, Arkansas, New Hampshire, or Louisiana--places that gave her husband the presidency. Nor do the Democrats need New York, an unlikely contested state so liberal it (barely) elected her in 2000. Even if Hillary Clinton gets beyond her feminist activism, single-payer health plan, and looming ethical questions (including, but not limited to,  Whitewater, Travelgate, Vince Foster, and the Pardons), there is the over-arching truth: she is not liked because she is not likeable and even those who "respect" her probably will not want to listen to her and about her for four long years. Democratic tacticians probably know all of this and are floating the Hillary trial balloon before either risking it with the pretty-boy-trial lawyer (who wants to evade it by talking about his four good clients) and Gephardt (the has-been/never-was who failed thrice to win the Democratic nomination for President and failed thrice to take the House back from Newt Gingrich). At least the Republicans have a candidate whose sobriety makes him difficult to hate, Democratic attacks notwithstanding.

      EDWARDS IS NOT A FIRST CLASS CHOICE   I may be en route to law school, but I will not act as if Americans are fond of trial lawyers-- Americans respect lawyers far less than doctors, businessmen, military personnel, and even carreer politicians. That the Chairman of the DNC favors a trial lawyer simply means there is nobody else capable of speaking well within the party, which bodes well for the GOP. Too bad Dean turned out to be maniacal, Clark showed no electoral talant, and Mosley-Braun proved herself to be the ultimate token. Better to choose a pretty face.

      PUNISH THE THIRD WORLD   I hate smog, dirty water, and the destruction of pretty places. I think it is important to preserve the world's enviornment. What I do not understand is why UN solutions, like the Kyoto Protocol, go easy on the third-world while cracking down on the countries whose new technology provides the answers. We need treaties that punish countries like China, India, and Mexico. We need a court (perhaps in Texas) that has punishes the filthy, not the relatively pristine United States. In terms of environmentalism, Europe is the anorexic who takes it too far, the United States is the perfectly curvy blond, and the third-world is the obese Rosie O'Donnell.

      OKAY, SO WAR IT MUST BE    When Muslim Iran seizes British soldiers and navy vessels, you know the war of civilizations is on. We have reached a point of no return, a point where we stop focusing on geopolitics (and the efficacy of everything from the establishment of Israel to Gulf War II, which I questioned) and realize that there is a new truth: now even the non-terrorist Islamic world does not respect Western power-- they are not scared. For the sake of honor, it is necessary for the West to crush fundamentalist Islam. It will also help our odds of survival.

      KERRY PANDERS TO MINORITIES   George Bush should hold John Kerry accountable for his race record. He supports giving minorities special consideration for federal contracts, special consideration for college admissions, and special consideration for avoiding the death penalty (so soft on criminals in a liberal Massachussetts way).   The logic underlying Kerry's argument is that past 21st century race policy should be dominated by 20th century segregation and 19th century slavery, instead of 14th Amendment and the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Kerry's position ignores tangible minority gains in society. It also pretends that the existing gap is still due to the fact that the white race-- due to a feeling of racial superiority-- systematically undermines individual blacks so as to preclude their advancement. This, not bad urban culture, so eloquently and incicively attacked by achieving Bill Cosby, is what Kerry holds as the real problem.   The passage of Proposition 209 in California, as well as recent polls showing Americans overwhelmingly oppose Affirmative Action, should lead Bush to attack Kerry for his support of Affirmative Action. It also presents a great opportunity to link him to clowns like Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, and others who (Certainly unlike Bill Cosby) offend swing voters.

      MOCKUMENTARIES ARE MISLEADING   To think about ideas, or have a conversation about ideas, words are necessary. Words mean things-- they have definitions you can look up in a dictionary. If you do not use precise language, you cannot reason, and you do not really engage ideas. Funny, then, how liberals always have the need to communicate their "message" through music, art, pictures, and motion pictures. Besides catering to bad attention spans, it also allows one to dodge the real debate. Michael Moore's documentaries exemplify the liberal need for indirectness, to make points only by appealing to humor and emotion. Thank God the young people who will spend two hours watching a Michael Moore documentary have neither the time nor inclination to vote.

      REAGAN BET ON PRINCIPLE, NOT CONVENTIONAL WISDOM  Following the togh loss in 1968, Reagan took on a sitting Republican President in the 1976 primaries. Facing enormous odds, he lost New Hampshire and a dozen other straight primaries. When his campaign was buried in debt and his staff had lost hope, the question was not whether but when to quit. Daring conventional wisdom, Reagan said, “I don’t care if I have to lose every damn state, I am not stopping until the Convention." He turned the campaign around, won 49% of the vote, 49% of the delegates, and, following the heartbreaker, did not stop running until he won.   HE WAS ORIGINAL   During the late 1970’s, Reagan undertook a successful project to develop his logic. As, “In His Own Hand,” indisputably documents, Reagan hand-wrote a series of position papers which would become his personal platform. If he had not developed his ideas, he would neither have been able to govern consistantly or communicate them so well. Consequently, when Reagan would change his position, he could clearly articulate why he was wrong, which he was never afraid to admit.   HE WAS NOT PETTY   Unlike the vast majority of people I encounter, Reagan was not petty. Consider the first deal he made with the Soviets: he bargained for the emigration fo a group of Pentecostal Christians living in the basement of the American Embassy, who the Soviets had not allowed to leave for five years, in exchange for the Americans agreeing not to publicize the deal whatsoever. Despite the temptation to tell the world about his commitment to human rights, Reagan kept his end of the bargain, he did not crow, and he never crowed.

      I would like to share with you one of the most beautiful pieces of writing I have ever seen, which has the ultimate quality of good writing, a total accceptance of reality.   My Fellow Americans,  I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer's disease.  Upon learning this news, Nancy and I had to decide whether as private citizens we would keep this a private matter or whether we would make this news known in a public way.  In the past Nancy suffered from breast cancer and I had my cancer surgeries. We found through our open disclosures we were able to raise public awareness. We were happy that as a result many more people underwent testing.  They were treated in early stages and able to return to normal, healthy lives.  So now, we feel it is important to share it with you. In opening our hearts, we hope this might promote greater awareness of this condition. Perhaps it will encourage a clearer understanding of the individuals and families who are affected by it.  At the moment I feel just fine. I intend to live the remainder of the years God gives me on this earth doing the things I have always done. I will continue to share life's journey with my beloved Nancy and my family. I plan to enjoy the great outdoors and stay in touch with my friends and supporters.  Unfortunately, as Alzheimer's Disease progresses, the family often bears a heavy burden. I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience. When the time comes I am confident that with your help she will face it with faith and courage.  In closing let me thank you, the American people for giving me the great honor of allowing me to serve as your President. When the Lord calls me home, whenever that may be, I will leave with the greatest love for this country of ours and eternal optimism for its future.  I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life. I know that for America there will always be a bright dawn ahead.  Thank you, my friends. May God always bless you.  Sincerely, Ronald Reagan."

      GAY MARRIAGE AND INCEST DOVETAIL   Gay marriage will give rise to more incest. When a lesbian couple has a child, the source of the other chromosome-- the father-- is almost always deliberately hidden. No way having three involved will work. Unfortunately, the child of the gay marriage will have no possible way to know who his brothers and sisters are, and vice versa. Maybe it will only be a few hundred cases, but that is a few hundred too many, and for the sake of children who should not be undley subject to incest, for no fault of their own, gay marriage is unacceptable.

      WHAT KERRY'S "SERVICE" MEANS   Nobody has proven veterans outperform nonveterans as Commanders-in-Chief. Jungle shooting is a warrior skill, not a management skill; correlating unrelated skills sets is wrong. Just because one's service evasion may demonstrate one lacks the honesty necessary to be President (the lying patterns in Clinton's evasion predicted his Presidency), service/nonservice does not predict policy leadership. Even if it did, Kerry is not a good enough veteran. He renounced his honors publicly in protest, probably also ashamed for going AWOL and shooting innocents; acts for which he vainly apologized. Hence neither Bush's minimalist service nor Kerry's bad service suggest that Kerry would have a better foreign policy. Kerry's perpetuation of this is delusion or deception.

      KERRY: ISLAMIC TERROR'S CHOICE   If you are a clerical gangster in Iran, if you are in charge of North Korea's weapons programs, if you are leading a terror cell in the United States and salivating at the chance to be free of Justice Department scrutinty-- if you are an enemy of America-- then you do not want George Bush. He is a strong man, a man not afraid to hold Middle Eastern nations accountable, a man not afraid to punish and prosecute enemies, a man not afraid to build a missle defense or fund troops. Just as Communists favored the appeasers of the American left, so afraid of confrontation, so trusting of the UN, so willing to understand, negotiate, and give in to evil, so afraid to assert American pride, so afraid to be strong patriots, so meek and humble and apologetic to evil-- now terrorists have found a weak American leader in John Kerry who is literally willing to forget September 11, who is afraid of evil and who believes it is America's destiny to avoid, not confront, evil.   John Kerry is Jimmy Carter, Hubert Humphrey, George McGovern-- he is another liberal Democrat advocate of a weak foreign policy.   He thinks being a Lieutenant-- being a LOW RANKING officer who threw his medals at the Capitol because he hated the cause he now trumpets, he thinks that his heroic cum cowardly service is sufficient to be considered worthy during this time, that it will hide is unmanly, frail, bony, and weak foreign policy which is no doubt the choice of those who would profit from weakness. Truth be told, he is a bad veteran who will no doubt lose the veterans vote, who will no doubt lose the soldiers vote, who instead must court prisoners and other low people.   George Bush, on the other hand, is at least a man.

      SMALL, NOT FALSE, PRETENSES   We should not have gone to Iraq to build democracy. Why should we expect people who acquiesce to dictators and embrace mullahs to pick responsible leaders, and, even if we could, why is this our interest? Nor should we have gone to the region to find WMD's, because America should be able to defend themselves not only from the weapons themselves, but also from militant Muslims here in America. What I am saying, then, is that the two main reasons for going to war suck, even though they are better than the cowardly reasons given by cowardly liberal thinkers too stupid to see a threat staring at them in the face, even if you can't see the rest of its face because it's hiding a black veil.   We did not need a war for democracy, a war on a method of war, or a war against people who ignored UN resolutions-- the UN Security Council has no authority and we, along with our enemies, ought to recognize that, lest we lose our sovereignty to a bunch of candy-assed Europeans, socialist Africans, and self-serving Commusts and Capitalist Asians. This is not to say, however, that we did not need a war, because we needed a big war in a big way: We needed to protect our honor and our pride by penetrating the region where militant Muslims breed, and showing them that we are not only better, but a hell of a lot stronger, than they are, and that we really could destroy them if we want to.   A powerful, dramatic, and mighty show of our force-- the kind of force that takes over Iraq one week, throws a party (with roast pig, wine, and unveiled, but rather scanily clad and liberated women-- would have been sufficient to improve our own national self-pride and crush theirs: because there really are instances in history where one people shows strength and the other recoils in knowing inferiority. We needed to show the Arab world that they could not dare-- DARE-- to mess with us, that they should just stay there, in the heat, hot, pump oil, and stay off our radars, because we are good enough to do what we want, and, if provoked, we will destroy their faith in themselves.   As MARK HELPRIN, of the Claremont Institute, said beautifully:   "From the beginning, the scale of the war was based on the fundamental strategic misconception that the primary objective was Iraq rather than the imagination of the Arab World, which, if sufficiently stunned, would tip itself back into the heretofore easily induced fatalism that makes it hesitate to war against the West. After the true shock and awe of a campaign of massive surplus, as in the Gulf War, no regime would have risked its survival by failing to go after the terrorists within its purview. But a campaign of bare sufficiency, that had trouble punching through even ragtag irregulars, taught the Arabs that we could be effectively opposed."  What went wrong?   We WAITED, for our allies, for the UN, for the public, for Congress, for the media-- giving the terrorists abroard and liberals at home time to undermine our ability to do what was both sufficient and necessary to protect America from further attack-- to AWE the dens of Islam and show the region that our power will ALWAYS beat theirs, that they should go pick a smaller enemy, but not us because when you attack, or let your neighbor attack, America, we can and will respond far better than your backward civilization can imagine.

      KERRY'S SCARY  The noble pursuit of justice at the Committee for Justice continues. See link to KERRY'S SCARY! Our founding fathers would be cheering in their graves that somebody is standing up in John Kerry's war against them. If you have a Braodband connection, check out the new television ads, because they are GENIUS, you will laugh!

      IT IS BACKFIRING   During the tragic aftermath following the 9/11 attacks a simple decency prinple prevailed whereby nobody would pass blame for what happened; since nobody would wish for the tragedy or in hindsight not support having done more, it is far better to focus on what IS right rather than who WAS wrong. The consensus did not last because low-road liberals could not resist the opportunity to cheaply accuse the President of being asleep at the wheel. It's ironic that one product of the endless analysis to to prove that Sandy Burger let bin Laden live and New Yorkers die. At this point, I would want to take the high road were it not for the fact that exposing this truth is the only way to stop the liberals from blaming blameless Bush.

      FOCUS ON THE ELECOTRAL COLLEGE LIKE LAST TIME   People still say Bush did not win legitimately in 2000. Putting aside the exhausted debate about vote counting, I want to address the idea that Bush not winning the popular vote affects his legimacy. The reality is that Bush could have easily won the popular vote. If he had chosen not to spend his resources and time in West Virginia and Arkansas while abandoning New York and California, he would have lost New York and California by less, won the popular vote, and lost the electoral college. It is to Bush's credit that he is a goal-oritented, big-picture thinker who keeps his eye on the ball. If there is a decision in this election, one would hope that Bush would do it again, because Kerry would.

      NO STATE FOR THEM   Recently, Administration officials have echoed cries from the American left to create a Palestinian state.   On a superficial level, it seems that Israel took territory which is not theirs and which should be returned. The problem is that history is filled with one conquering army taking land from another. There is no reasonable way to discern who had the land first. Also, the youth fighting for this land were not yet born at the date of conquest. They are nto even descendents of the propertied class which indeed held the land, and which has since fled. These are just angry young people trying to profit from quasi-ancestors whose state did not sufficiently defend their property rights.   The current P.L.O. leadership is also inept: Yassir Arafat's own party fired on his compound. Sanctioned with the consent of the governed, this ruling elite should never acquire international legitimacy.

      PRESIDENT'S APPROVAL RATING SURGES   According to the John Zogby, a respected pollster, the President's approval rating has gone up: On 5/13/04, the President's Disapproval was 58%. His approval was 42% (likely voters). On 6/5/04, the President's Disapproval was 54%, Approval was 46% (likely voters). On 7/7/04, the President's Dissaproval was 51%, Approval was 49% (likely voters). It seems that the Bush advertising campaign and the unleashing of Iraq is having the intended effect. Nobody can claim there is a constantly escalating outrage with respect to the President. As the campaign moves on, the Democratic Candidates' Senate records will come under stricter scrutiny, the economy will improve, and people will reject the Dems' cultural liberalism. Probably the Democrats will surge at their convention, but there is no denying the overall trend over the past couple of months.

      NOBODY SHOULD GET AWAY WITH THIS  Barack Obama is the Democratic Nominee for an OPEN seat in the U.S. Senate in the swing state that birthed Ronald Reagan. In the Illinois state Senate, he accumulated a liberal record advancing government health care, higher taxes, and coddling criminals. Now, however, he is whistling his way to the U.S. Senate. This man has no opponent but indeed has a speaking slot at the Democratic Convention-- to give the keynote. Is nobody willing to stand up and attack the Democratic Party's newest sacred cow?

      WISDOM &nbsp; I came across this speech by Alan Keyes which is more philosophical than political or religious, though it has elements of all three. It's basically a graduation address which contains good advice.  &nbsp;  Thank you very much. Well, greetings to the class of 2000. Now, I hate to begin my talk by seeming contrary, but I always get slightly uncomfortable when folks talk about the year 2000 as the beginning of the new millennium. It's almost as if we live, we do live in the Clinton era, we all know that, and as a result every thing that we do has to be false. And therefore, among other things, we decided we'd make a false start to the new millennium. This is the 20th century, we do know that right? Now, it wouldn't be the 20th century, I've got news for you, if the year two thousand wasn't included in it. So, for all the lies that you may have been told, your are not the first class of the new millennium; you are the last class of the old one. And that bears thinking on. It bears thinking on because as we look forward into the darkness, some of us like to forget to look back and to think about where we've been, what we have come from. We're all full of thoughts of what is to be and it seems always so appropriate at graduation time just to think about the future. But the truth is, that as someone once remarked I think quite wisely, the odd thing about tomorrow is it never quite gets here, because once it gets here it's today. The opportunities such as they are are a product of what we do now and of what we have to look back upon. And at some point in your lives I think you will pass a certain line, probably most of you as graduates today have not, some of you may though, and it's that line in life where you feel the weight of your past a little bit more than you feel the lure of your future. It's an honest moment. But it's also a moment in which if you take it seriously you may cut through some of the lies that are sold to you as truth today. And in the next ten or fifteen minutes that's what I'd like to try to help you do. Because I think it's going be more useful than standing here in the usual fashion and telling you to, ÎGo forward with high heart into the success that's inevitable given your wonderful education,' and so forth and so on. You have a wonderful education, so do many people in this life. You work hard, you prepare yourself, you go out, you do your absolute best. And then you will reach a point in life, regardless of whatever else goes on, where most people most of the time have to acknowledge that all of the wonderful dreams that fill your mind today didn't quite come true. The books were not written, the films were not all made, the loves were not all enjoyed and somewhere along the way you have to deal with things you already have begun to know. The hard hours and the tough losses, the things that don't work out and the people who were here yesterday but are gone now, whose love was a certainty that failed, whose hope for you was expressed in ways that you did not understand until it was too late.     And so I want to speak a little bit, and I've been thinking about this in the course of the last several days because a friend of mine and a man I greatly, greatly admire, John Cardinal O'Connor, just rounded out his life. And he is being much praised these days, very deservedly, he looks back on a life of controversy and so forth, but if you look back on a life like that, the one thing you realize is that whatever the world may say about success or failure or greatness, I think the mark of a truly great life is a life such as his was. It was marked not just by constant successes, and constant applause and constant popularity, but by a constant sense that there were convictions that mattered, and truths that deserved allegiance and a substance to life that goes beyond what we ordinarily think of as success.   I remember getting a piece of advice when I started my tenure as ambassador to the United Nations Economic and Social Council. I was, at the time I began that chore, very young for the job, or at least some people would have said so. And I remember Ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick who was my boss and the head of the permanent mission sitting me down when I first began, she looked at me and she said words that I have never forgotten. She said, "You know, how things turn out may not depend so much on how you handle the job as how you handle yourself in the job." I think these days we put altogether too much emphasis on how you handle the job and how you get it done and what the results are and what you got paid for and what the fruits will be and what the toys are that you may have to play with at the end of the day. This may be the motivation for many. But the thing that always grieves my heart when I look out on a graduating class and think about that is that for the folks for whom that is the key motivation there will be a handful who stand at the pinnacle and enjoy the wealth and all of it, and the rest will be disappointed. Because we're not most of us going to grow up to be Bill Gates or Donald Trump. It's not in the cards and it couldn't possibly be. Some may fail, others may enjoy a modest success because that's what ordinarily happens to the mass of human beings. And as you walk on through life, if you're still measuring your life in dollar signs, if you're still trying to figure out who you are based on what you've got in the bank and what somebody else says is your success, then step by step, year by year you will go down that road of quiet desperation that the poet, wrongly I think, thought to be the inevitable lot of human kind. But it doesn't have to be that way see, if you remember that sometimes it's not just what you do in life and what you achieve in life. No. In the course of all of this you're doing more than producing a result here or there, doing a competent job, having a little fun and so forth. You are becoming someone. You are building a character. You are becoming an idea of human worth. And when all is said and done, when absolutely everything else is stripped from you, at the end of it all when you must contemplate, as we all must do, that moment when everything in this material and temporal plane that you have built and cared about and worked for will come to dust, that idea, that idea, maybe the only thing that looks as if it would survive. Not what did you do and what did you have, but who did you become and can you look back on that person with a sense of satisfaction, of joy, of pride. But you see, that's something that doesn't matter, at the end of the day, how far you go according to the measure that is used in People magazine or Forbes. No. There are folks out there, like some of the folks that contributed to your success, like some of the parents who helped to get you here, and some of the guardians, some of the aunts and uncles and friends, people nobody will ever read about in the newspaper, people no one will ever see in the history books, folks who will fade in the course of time from all of human memory except the hearts and minds of those who with their love and sacrifice and dedication, with their moments when they thought of someone else more than they thought of themselves, they fashioned hopes and dreams that are now yours, and possibilities that you may become, and then they stepped aside, content not to soar necessarily to the heights except upon the wings of those that they send forth like you, to be an offering to the future. It's much more likely you know, that the bulk of us will be like that. Much more likely that we will have to look back on lives that didn't break the surface, that didn't get more than 30 seconds much less our 15 minutes of fame. If this is what you live for you will be disappointed. But if you live instead in the hope that there will be deeds in your life when the line between right and wrong was presented to you and you decided, not because someone forced you or because someone paid you or because someone threatened you, but simply because somewhere in your heart you held true to a conviction of your spirit, you decided to do, at whatever the cost, just what you thought was right.   It does not have to be a big thing, it does not have to be a thing on which the world depends, but on that moment of choice when it comes and however often it comes may very well depend what you become, and what you have to look back upon in those hours when everything else fades into insignificance and all you have left to remember are the things that stand up to the test of those standards that do not fade, those things that decide, not on our worth in the bank account but on the worth of our souls and our characters. Those things, in the end that are judged not just by the eyes of men that pass and colleagues that will disappear, but by those eyes that see with the force and power, call it by whatever name you will, that lasts through all the ages, that sees throughout all eternity and that weighs things up, not by the puny measures of our hopes, but by the true measures of what is good and right and just.   I think if you can stand up to that test then it's very likely that your life won't hold any real disappointment. Because I, unlike some folks, I can't stand up here and say, ÎWell, just go out, dream as you please and everything will happen, success will be yours, all you have to do is believe in yourself!' This is not true. You can believe in yourself all you like, you'll still Îfail' some of you. But in the midst of all of that, in the midst of all the things that go wrong and don't come out right and don't quite measure up to what you had hoped would be the case as you sit here today, if you are able to believe in something more powerful, more important, more permanent, more true, more good, more just than you are, then, then you have some hope of real success. Then you have some hope that whatever the world may say, you will become that which is deathless, and which is worthy of the immortality that in the faith of many is the promise of our humanity.   I deeply believe that we live in times when we altogether too much forget this. our eyes blinded the sunshine of our own material success. But even for our nation you know, these times won't last. Nations have their ups and downs, their good times and bad, their travails as well as their triumphs. We meet these things with the resources of our spirit; those resources that we call upon when the bank account is empty, when the military might fails, when the depression hits, when the times are bad, when the friends desert. And yet if you have built within yourself that conviction which holds onto things that are true and sees a goodness and worth in yourself not measured by anything outside your own true heart and faithful conviction, then all those things will come and go but you will remain a faithful soul, ready to meet that destiny which is marked out for us not in the course of this little time we spend, but in the course of that eternity which though dark to us may yet be lit by the little candle of our souls.   So I would like to offer to you, as I'm suppose to do I suppose, a word of encouragement. Because with the good help that you have gotten from friends and colleagues and dedicated teachers at this great institution, you lay a foundation. But then, as I'm suppose to do but as some folks forget to do these days, I'll offer you as well an admonition. An admonition is a piece of advice that comes in the form of a warning. And this one someone offered to me early in my career in government. And I thank God that I never forgot it because if I had, I would have probably lost myself long ago. We have to go out in this world, and you can sell your talent, you can sell your knowledge. You can sell your time and you can sell your labor. You will be bought and sold on the auction block of many different marketplaces where all of these things will be toted up and valued by others and you eventually too will be the judge. But if you are going to follow my advice today and remember nothing else then just remember this. There's not a single thing on offer in this all too temporary world for which you should ever sell your soul. Hold on to this. Be true to that in you which if you are willing to respect its truth, will not fail, will never desert, and will in the end, not turn into dust even when you have shuffled off this mortal coil. For I think that there is a light in us, a little spark of God's divinity. And if we husband and shelter its truth then we can make it into a light that glows beyond the edges of this time, to light a path to others, in our families, in our nation, in the world. But also to be a light whose spreading ripples in the voids of time we cannot calculate and whose ultimate fate we do not know. In some sense, I think, this is a home we can build for our humanity that lasts beyond anything else we can hope for. Be true to that little promise of it that you have and come what may, your life will be, in your own eyes and in the eyes of God, the success you hope for.  God bless you.

      THERE IS NO REASON FOR GAY MARRIAGES TO EXIST    Why does society even recognize marriage? Society has an interest in recognizing families because they provide a context for raising children-- citizems-- capable of ruling and being ruled. Since the parts don't fit, gay partners cannot produce offspring. Even if marriages and families are also forums for comfort, care, and love, these purposes are subjective to the participants and have nothing to do with why jurisdictions record and recognize marriage. From the standpoint of the political order, there is no reason for gay marriage to exist. The problem is that gay people feel marginalized. However, they need not feel more marginalized if they consider they are not being excluded because society hates what they do, but merely because sociey has no vested interest in their arrangements.

      WHY THEY DON'T LIKE LABELS   Liberals usually say they do not like labels. Why? They know two things: (1) Their agenda is liberal and (2) America opposes the liberal agenda. Conservatives never have problems with labels because they can rest satisfied that what they advance-- conservatism-- is acceptable like liberalism is not to voters when asked. The argument against labels in principle, based on the idea that they are too simplistic, is asinine because many embrace being pigeonholed if their pigeonhole is popular. Too bad the liberal pigeonhole, for those who stand for more government, higher taxes, and the radical social agenda, will never be popular like Reagan's conservatism-- too bad they will never be able to be proud of what they are like conservatives.

      July-November Election   I am going to make a prediction: George Bush will win the election in November by a razor-think margin. George Bush may not be very popular, but by election day John Kerry is not going to be popular either. Rightfully, the Bush campaign is probably going to tell America about Kerry's record-- all of those votes for single-payer health plans, gutting defense, providing abortions overseas, denying the homeland a missile defense, letting greedy trial lawyers drive up the cost of health care, and killing the balanced budget amendment-- the vote that made deficits possible. Then, the real fun is going to begin. Americans, particularly voting demographics, wish to defend the values they hold dear-- and John Kerry is going to be the man who wants to open up government-subsidized abortion clinics, the man who opposes their right to keep and bear arms, the man who, ashamed of his Vietnam service, threw his medals at the Capitol where he would later vote to extend "liberties" to flag burners and to confirm judges who wish to ban the Pledge of Allegience.  Since the tone of this election is already nasty, there is no reason to take the high-road. This is the time for Bush to definate John Kerry as a man who stands opposed to the values they cherish, the man who will mock their family's values, who will gut defense like he did before, and whose liberal judges will foist their feminist, liberal social agenda upon the decent parts of America that voted for Bush in 2000.

      "THE LIST"   I was looking at the list of Saudi nationals Michael Moore uses to content that Americans "evacuated" after 9/11. Virtually everyone was "evacuated" on Saudi Arabian Airlines flights which fly routinely between the United States and Saudi Arabia. Those who were actually evacuated with American government help were evacuated by Richard Clarke.

      BAD CHOICE  During the campaign, one-term Senator John Edwards distinguished himself  with his isolationist message concerning the economy, which has since recovered. As I said, this is the time to bring out Edwards' baggage. His book, Four Trials, has foisted his record as a trial lawyer upon the national dialogue. Edwards, however, cannot only talk about his four good clients; his profiteering, frivilous clients are fair-game too. The Bush campaign should focus on Edwards' liberalism, isolationism, general untrustworthiness, and lack of gravitas. Ultimately, however, people really vote on the #1, and Kerry is unlikeable, in addition to being a liberal isolationist.

      BIG MIND v. LITTLE MIND   One way to test the substance of a political candidate is to go to their web page and see what they have to say on the issues. Though there are not many, serious candidates won't just address a few hot button issues currently peaking in opinion polls-- leaders have something to say about all kinds of things they perceive as important. If you go to Barack Obama's web page, and click on issues, you will find the four obligatory trite issues: Education, Health Care, Energy, Jobs and the Economy.  Attached to each is the party line complete with the same boring catch-phrases. Barack Obama has a good pollster, but is he forging a substantive campaign? Or is Barack Obama just a whitish black face delivering the same old soundbites and another American dream story. Alan Keyes, the underdog, is different and rarer: ever the thoughtful Straussian, taught by Alan Bloom, seeking to apply the conclusions of his education to a dumbed-down world.

      THE CHOICE  Is our foreign policy going to be muscular and strong or woosy, wimpy, and weak, like John Kerry wants.   After Vietnam, John Kerry became a dove, and he carried his dovishness into the Cold War. Besides supporting a nuclear freeze (http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/061903.shtml), John Kerry opposed SDI, opposed deploying Pershing missles in Germany, opposed the buildup of long-range and intermediate missiles, and generally supported a detente agimed at coexisting with an evil empire. At Ronald Reagan's funderal, President Gorbachev said the Soviet Union fell because of Ronald Reagan's aggressive policies, espcially crediting SDI for unleashing an arms race his country could not win. If the United States had remained timid like Jimmy Carter and John Kerry wanted-- if we were woosy, wimpy, and weak-- President Gorbachev might not have been the last leader of the USSR and we might still be fighting the Cold War.   Now, John Kerry wants to lead the War on Terror. With all his flip-flopping was said and done, John Kerry stands with post-Nazi Germany and post-Vischy France (still bonding in anti-Semtisim with the Muslim world) in opposing America's showing strength in the very hotbed of radical Islam-- Iraq. Do we want a President whose priority is protecting the rights of terrorists over the lives of Americans, who is scared of offending terrorists who want Americans dead. . .   Do we want a woosey, wimpy, and weak foreign policy, or a strong, muscular, and brave foreign policy?

      IRAN IS NOT MODERATING   Just as little kids believe it the tooth ferry, liberal academics believe in Iranian moderates-- even though Clerics rule Iran, and have for decades, they point to an impotent President and a few lousy newspapers and glean a movement towards democracy. Such women and men will do anything to oppose a muscular American military and a muscular foreign policy. If you want to see the truth of Iran, go ahead and see Iran's contribution to the Internet: Go to the Islamic News Wire, go to the Tehran Times, go and you will see that the current youth of Iran is unlikely to progress as the last one, that in fact the mentality of the old Council of Guardians continues to prevail. Ye believers in a moderating Iran, ye suckers, witness the journalism of the Tehran Times, considered the most progressive newspaper in town:   "Zionists’ Golden Vote   By Hassan Hanizadeh  The presidential election campaign pitting Democratic Party candidate John Kerry against current U.S. President George W. Bush of the Republican Party has become more serious in recent days.  The Democratic Party recently held its national convention in Boston and officially declared Kerry the party’s candidate for the November 2 U.S. presidential election.  On domestic affairs, the platforms of the two candidates are almost diametrically opposed to each other. However, Kerry and Bush both pursue the same foreign policy.  Increasing wages, personal liberty, which has been under attack during Bush’s presidency, and the rights of racial and religious minorities in the U.S. are some of the main issues of the Democrats.  The campaign against terrorism, domestic and international security, increasing the military budget, and boosting the national economy are the priority issues on the Republican agenda.  But both parties share a common stance on maintaining the security and regional military superiority of Israel.  The Zionist lobby certainly plays a very significant role in defining U.S. foreign policy, since each of the country’s presidents over the past century owes his victory to the U.S. Zionists’ “golden votes”.  The Zionist lobby’s domination of the U.S. media, the fact that 5000 U.S. newspapers and radio and television networks are pro-Zionist, and the Zionists’ $1.8 trillion investment in U.S. stock exchanges illustrates the Zionists’ ability to determine the outcome of U.S. elections.  This is why U.S. presidential candidates usually make written pledges to support the interests of the Zionist lobby if they win the election.  Along these lines, Kerry recently sent his brother to the occupied territories to explain the Democratic position on Israel.  The White House has also remained silent about Israel’s crimes against the Palestinian nation, and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has taken advantage of the situation to massacre more Palestinians.  Obviously, both parties are beholden to the Zionist lobby, and the Zionist regime will definitely try to gain concessions from both the Democrats and the Republicans during the election campaign.  It is not the electoral choice of the majority of U.S. citizens but the “golden vote” of U.S. Zionists that guarantees victory for a presidential candidate."  So much for the growing free press' contribution to the Internet! If you think this is an exception, go ahead and ruffle through more of their pathetic journalism, go and see the intellectual dishonesty incongruous with anything like a democratic generation. Go see that the Iranian youth is as out-of-control and filled with hate as the Palestinian youth, and we might as well wall them in too. The ugliness of the Islamic world is why we need a muscular foreign policy, not John Kerry's lame foreign policy.

      Poll: No boost for Kerry after convention By Susan Page, USA TODAY Last week's Democratic convention boosted voters' impressions of John Kerry but failed to give him the expected bump in the head-to-head race against President Bush, a USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll finds. (Related item: Poll results)  In the survey, taken Friday and Saturday, Bush led Kerry 50%-46% among likely voters. Independent candidate Ralph Nader was at 2%.  The survey showed Kerry losing 1 percentage point and Bush gaining 4 percentage points from a poll taken the week before the Boston convention.  The change in support was within the poll's margin of error of +/-4 percentage points in the sample of 763 likely voters. But it was nonetheless surprising, the first time since the chaotic Democratic convention in 1972 that a candidate hasn't gained ground during his convention.

      Dear Mr. Gore,   My, you must be very tired, going in front of a friendly radical crowd and yelling and screaming like a maniac.  Then you wonder how you lost the election four years ago.  Sure, you won the popular vote, but just imagine...You might have won those 528 votes in Florida if you hadn't been such a scathing liberal nutjob.     There has been a particular precedent for losing candidates in the past, they are rarely seen or heard from again, save the occasional goodwill trip to Haiti or some other country that isn't quite important.  They have a duty to this nation for doing the little, but necessary, things.  Giving speeches that would make even Hitler's theatrical coach blush isn't close to what an elder statesman such as yourself should be doing.  Here is a list of things that are more productive...  1)  President of the Keep-the-Expos-in-Montreal Association 2)  Helping to revive Craig T. Nelson's sagging acting career 3)  Writing a book on your favorite one-hit wonder band, Chumbawumba 4)  Hosting a talk show on the Lifetime channel in between reruns of the Golden Girls and the Nanny 5)  Reinventing "Double Dare" for past hippies 6)  Starting an NPR show that mainly deals with varying different types of fall foliage 7)  Opening a restaurant that serves food that does not harm the environment (no meat, no veggies, mostly just recycled paper and rainwater)   Of course there are many more things that would be more productive than you ranting and raving against the Bush administration, but I suppose you are happy doing just that.  Perhaps one of these days, you will finally call Bill.  It's been four years.  Just call to say 'What's up?'  I think he would appreciate that.  He would probably tell you to 'Shut the hell up', but you wouldn't listen to him in 2000 and gosh darnit, you probably won't listen to him now.  Well, I hope this letter finds you in good health and low blood pressure, please stay in touch and just remember...Just because a leftist group asks you to speak...It doesn't mean you have to have a conniption fit.  God Bless,   Tony DeFranco

      I have just taken a deeper look at some of the recent polling numbers that ABC just released on May 23 and it isn't looking as grim as the media would like to spin it.  In fact, most of the polling is not even being reported.  For example, take the question of straight Bush vs. Kerry.  In March of 2004, Kerry lead Bush 48-44.  Now, as Bush's "numbers go to record lows", Bush and Kerry are tied 46-46.  Do the math.  Kerry -2.  Bush +2.  When asked about who the public trustsin  Iraq, where "the President's support has eroded",  the President went from trailing by one point to leading Kerry by 6!  The bottom line here is that the media can say all they want about the President's declining numbers, but I say research the polling numbers for yourself and you will find they are not as soft as you would be lead to believe.  What they tell me is that when push comes to shove in November the public will have to make a clear and definate choice.  The public will soon realize that Kerry offers no real alternitive to anything.  When this realization occurs, Bush wins.

      Great Lines for my friends with ADD   We did not seek this war on terror, but this is history as we find it    The terrorists will not determine the future of Iraq    ...Then, with the approval of the Iraqi government, we will demolish the Abu Ghraib prison, as a fitting symbol of Iraq's new beginning...   And possibly one of the best things that I have heard about this war in a long time (said by Sen. Joe Lieberman):   If we don't lose our will, someday we'll look back on what we've done in Iraq with pride   We should be hearing more of this kind of talk around DC and on the campaign trail.

      While having a late night debate with some liberal friends of mine, I came to realize the true nature of any sort of debate that occurs with Bush foes.  Their debate is not entirely based on fact.  While employing some fact to back up their argument, they supplement it with pure venomous vitriol for our war-time President.  This is not the way to have a mature debate.  The issue du jour with most liberals, and I suppose the entire nation, is Bush's execution of the war in Iraq.  I will always entertain the oppurtunity to have a lively discussion of issues, so long as they are pertinent to the debate.  Not "Bush is dumb" or "I can't believe he drug us into this war".  Where are the facts?  They sweep the facts under the bed like a child trying to make his room appear tidy.  The facts are this.  Bush is not dumb.  You are ignorant if you think that he is.  Plain and simple.  The man is educated from the posh prep school of Philips Exeter to Yale to Harvard business school.  Calling Bush dumb would be indicting these schools of educational malpractice.  The knee-jerk liberal reaction is to say that he only was granted admission because of his family name.  Fine, but if he was dumb how did he graduate?  Or why didn't both Bush daughters go to Yale and not just one?  I am sure that Jenna could have dropped her name to gain admission.  Liberals were always evasive about reports that supposedly Bush had better grades than Al Gore during their times in college, but I never hasten to make that argument because calling someone smarter than someone else is a regression to the Neanderthal argument that one can pitch a large stone further than the other.  Liberal knee-jerk reaction #2:  Well, if he isn't dumb why does he talk dumb?  Bush speaks in the parlance of the average American; the average American who doesn't use the word 'parlance' nor does he care to.  President Bush, like many Americans, believe that vocabulary doesn't make the man, but what makes the man are the decisions that he makes when they count most...which segways nicely into the next counter-intellectual argument that liberals make: the Iraq war.  "Bush drug us into the Iraq war!" they always say, usually alleging some sort of conspiracy to get their oil or calling this payback for the first President Bush.  Let's talk about the truth, for a change.  The truth is that the intelligence that Bush had was the same that President Clinton had before him.  This intelligence stated that Saddam had WMDs.  Bush presented this intelligence to Congress, who overwhelmingly voted to go to war based on said intelligence--Senator Kerry also supported the legislation.  No one ever talks about that.  Liberals like to say that Bush did this without any regard for anybody's opinion and just lead us senselessly into war.  Which is not true, because he sought and received near uniamimous approval from Congress...so I guess it wasn't just Bush that drug us into this war.  Now the liberals get nervous, because they know that you have them in a tough spot.  So they resort to the war for oil diatribe.  If the war was for oil, where is the Iraqi oil??  Why does it cost me $30 to fill up my Volkswagen?  Again, they get flustered.  "Well, it was just to get back at Saddam for the President's dad" they angerily say.  Again, wrong.  Bush 41, although not publicly against the war, dispatched his advisers like Scocroft and Fitzwater to speak for him against action in Iraq.  Now, the liberal is really mad.  "I hate Bush!" they resort to...  Now you have won the debate because their hate has defeated them.  The liberals let their hate erase things from their memory...9/11, pre-Iraq War, etc.  Argue the facts, don't argue emotion...it just isn't mature.

       "We hold these truths to be self-evident," they said, "that all men are created equal." Strange as it may seem, that was the first time in history that anyone had ever bothered to write that down. Decisions are made by those who show up.   Whatever happened??

      I just wanted to apologize to my friend Mr. Brendan Burns for my unthoughtful response to his comments.  They were brash and not made in the best spirit of the blog.  We can all agree that Mayor O'Malley is a farce.

      This past weekend, Mayor Martin O'Malley was noticeably absent from the Preakness, Baltimore largest annual sporting event.  The mayor was off at "meetings" in New York when he should have been with his city at its annual showcase.  His absence is more critical this year for two reasons:  the possibility of Baltimore losing the Preakness and more importantly, terrorism.  As every legislative session passes without slots to boost Maryland's sagging horse racing industry, it becomes a clearer reality that the Preakness may have to leave Baltimore for a place that is politically and financially friendlier to the event.  O'Malley, of course, is against the Preakness leaving Baltimore, but in the same breath he is against providing the event a lifeline to survive: Slot Machines.  Why is he against slots?  Because it would undoubtedly secure political rival, Governor Ehrlich's reelection.  By O'Malley snubbing Preakness, he has shown once and for all that he has no vested interest in keeping the Preakness in Baltimore, and thereby shunning the millions of dollars it generates for the Baltimore economy.  If the Preakness were one day to leave Maryland, he would undoubtedly do what he always does when Baltimore gets in trouble...Blame everybody but himself.  Had O'Malley been at the race, perhaps it would have sent a message to the broader political community that O'Malley would not sit idly by to watch Maryland racing be put out to pasture, and that he would be an advocate for keeping the Preakness in Baltimore for a 129 more years.  But Marylanders got no such reassurance from the Mayor.  The second reason O'Malley should have been in at the Preakness, or at least in Baltimore is terrorism.  Preakness is attended by over 100,000 people.  If terrorism is to occur in Baltimore, Preakness would be high on the list of probable locations.  O'Malley, head of the National Association of Mayor's Committee on Homeland Security, would not have been in the city.  For a Mayor who has been so vocal and critical of the Bush administration's supposed ignorance to the plight of cities in the War on Terror, where was he on the day that Baltimore should be at its most vigilant?  After 9/11, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani attended the New York Yankees' World Series games as a symbol that he was standing by his city.  Where is O'Malley's display of leadership?  If he wants to criticize anyone on Homeland Security, be there when it matters most.  Perhaps O'Malley's political handlers, who have been doing probably the worst jobs ever in 2004 causing blunder after blunder for the Mayor who admittedly aspires to be President, should think these issues more clearly and carefully next time they want to schedule a trip to New York, then Italy.  O'Malley's continued arrogance will undoubtedly be his final undoing, sooner rather than later.

      Much has been made about Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld's perceived handling of the war in Iraq.  Now, critics of the war have shifted their focus to his deputy Paul Wolfowitz.  Today Wolfowitz testified to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee where he faced a barrage of question, mainly attacking his credulity.  Even affable Senator Russ Feingold questioned his integrity, saying that senators had asked before the war about plans for securing weapons of mass destruction and dealing with a possible negative response from the Iraqi people.  "I, frankly, feel we were never given real answers to that, and I have a feeling that it's because there wasn't a serious plan, and I think at this point we're paying a serious price for it," Feingold said.   Wolfowitz responded, while the plan wasn't perfect, there was a serious plan in place.  It is my perception that in this highly charged election year atmosphere, critics to the war expect nothing short of perfection when handling Iraq.  One's response to this would be "Well, when you are dealing with American lives, It should be perfect or close to it".  This may be true, a war plan should be perfect, but realistically this is impossible.  Our Iraq war plan took into account the acceptance of the Iraqi people, and I am going to go out on a limb and say that we have garnered this acceptance even throughout the prisoner scandal and what not.  What our war plan did not take into account was the little read AP wire piece written in April 2003--shortly after the liberation of Baghdad--in which Al Qaida called on all "friends of Islam" to descend upon Iraq and take up arms.  No one really paid much attention in April, but six months later people took heed.  The point is that the roadside bombings of American troops, the terrorist attacks on Iraqi civilians, and the other various things that have gone on in Iraq have been perpetrated by mostly non-Iraqis in the hopes of disrupting what would be a peaceful transfer of power on June 30.  So when Senator Feingold claims that Wolfowitz was not right about the acceptance of the Iraqi people, he is wrong.  He should modify his statement to say that we have not yet garnered the acceptance of the Syrian militias or the Iranian militias, who do not want to see democracy take hold in the middle east.    The resolve of President Bush, Secretary Rumsfeld, and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz in maintaining that deadline should be commended.  Terrorist will not dictate the pursuit of democracy.  As well as, politicians should not bicker about their perceptions of Wolfowitz's perceptions of a war plan that has not come to its full fruition yet.  Mistakes have been made, but June 30 has yet to pass.  Democracy will come to Iraq, but even in this age of attention deficit disorder, we must have patience...

      For what is the tenth day in a row, the Baltimore Sun has seen fit to print a story about Governor Ehrlich's multiculturalism statement.  Enough is enough.  Actually enough was enough about a week ago, but now it is excessive.  In a newspaper where 90% of the writing comes from the AP or Reuters, the original writing is nothing but petty swipes at the Governor and at times, the President.  These swipes are not only coming on the Op-Ed page (although it is mostly syndicated writers from other papers), these swipes are coming disguised as news articles!  Take for example today's article.  The opening paragraph is remarkably the same as the previous days.  It says today:  It might be "bunk" to Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., but multiculturalism has been a priority in Maryland public schools since 1970s, when the State Board of Education first issued regulations addressing the contributions of other cultures, which Ehrlich is sworn to uphold  Is there any new news to Marylanders?  Not really.  It merely just points out for the umpteenth time that Ehrlich said that multiculturalism is bunk.  It has long been known that The Sun and Ehrlich have no lost love.  This dates back to the beginning of the Ehrlich administration when he said that he had a particular disdain for the Sun.  Now two years later, the Sun has gotten its chance at payback.  Ehrlich states his opinion on an issue, and the Sun runs article ad infinitum.  What this has really done is pay into Ehrlich's hand.  The Sun looks ridiculous.  It has been two weeks and there is no sign of ending.  Perhaps, the Sun should write more stories on its rapidly declining readership...I think that is more newsworthy at this point.

      Fund right again, here it is...    Anger Management   Dems start to realize that a campaign of hate won't beat President Bush.   Monday, May 17, 2004 12:01 a.m. EDT    It's a cliché this is becoming the meanest year in politics yet. But it's true. Last week, Mike Lavigne, the spokesman for the Texas Democratic Party, admitted calling a state Supreme Court justice "a Nazi." When his boss, Democratic Party chairman Charles Soecthting, was asked if an apology was due, he said, "I don't have a problem that Mike said it."   Then there's Sen. Ted Kennedy, who told a startled Senate last week that "Saddam's torture chambers have been reopened under new management, United States management." Some conservative talk show hosts, such as Michael Savage, have railed against gays and immigrants while they question John Kerry's patriotism. On the left, Bush bashing has become a national sport.   Prominent Democrats are beginning to realize that hatred of President Bush won't defeat him in November. One of the reasons that Mr. Bush continues to lead John Kerry in polls despite the bad news from Iraq is that many voters tune out criticism of the president when it turns hysterical. "It isn't enough for you to be venomous and be angry," Bill Clinton urged a MoveOn.org fund-raiser last week. "Don't be mad. Smile. Be glad."  That's good advice. Republicans shed their image as dour naysayers only when they embraced Ronald Reagan's inspirational optimism. One of the chief complaints Democratic consultants have about Mr. Kerry is his gloomy demeanor and pessimistic message. They're trying to engineer a makeover.       If liberals are going to follow Bill Clinton's advice and become happy warriors, they have some housecleaning to do first. The very group he spoke to, MoveOn.org, belongs to the paranoid school of American politics. In January, it held a contest to select the best ads that told "the truth about George Bush's policies." Two of the entries posted on the group's website compared Mr. Bush to Hitler. One ad morphed an image of Hitler into the president and likened "1945's war crimes" to "2003's foreign policy." Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle gave an eloquent speech last week at the University of Kansas calling on people of all ideological views to stop "demonizing those with whom we disagree." He called the MoveOn.org ad "outrageous."  Certainly there are rhetorical excesses on the right too. High-octane conservative Web sites feature vitriolic personal attacks on Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, Teresa Heinz Kerry and others. But some liberal activists go further. Michael Goodwin of New York's Daily News spent a day listening to Air America, the new liberal talk-radio network, and found he had to endure hours of "rancid venom." Host Randi Rhodes compared U.S. prisons in Iraq to the "Nazi gulag," a mixed ideological metaphor as well as an inflammatory one.   Nor are Nazi allusions limited to talk radio. Seymour Hersh, who broke the story of the Iraqi prisons in The New Yorker, appeared on CNN last week and said a picture of two guard dogs snarling at a prisoner was "a scene from we know what, you know, [the] Third Reich." When host Wolf Blitzer asked him to be more specific, Mr. Hersh changed the subject.  MoveOn.org is financed in part by billionaire George Soros, who last year also compared Mr. Bush to Hitler and said that Israel was "likely" a big but secret reason for the war in Iraq. Mr. Soros is also a major financial backer of the Media Fund, an anti-Bush group directed by Harold Ickes, who served as President Clinton's deputy chief of staff. When Mr. Ickes was asked what its supporters thought of Mr. Soros's penchant for Bush-Hitler comparisons, Mr. Ickes said "we have not taken heat because of it."   It's time that liberals police their own and flush out the nests of the most virulent Bush haters. A sure sign that a movement or party is out of power and likely to stay that way is if much of its public image is defined by its fever-swamp fringe. Conservatives had a similar dilemma in the 1960s when journalists were able to tag the movement by its most extreme elements. Liberal author Jonathan Schoenwald has documented how conservative leaders had to move carefully to "exorcise the demons of right-wing extremism." The John Birch Society's opposition to communism morphed into a conspiratorial vision that could label almost anyone a communist sympathizer, including Dwight D. Eisenhower. William F. Buckley and other mainstream conservatives spent years isolating and discrediting the Birchers. It wasn't easy. To blast the Birchers indiscriminately would have risked alienating many committed followers who were only dimly aware of the society's kookiness. To wait too long would have risked tarring the entire conservative movement. Liberals may not believe they are in a similar position as Mr. Buckley and his allies were two generations ago. But there are clues that the ridicule and fulmination with which liberals attack "that cowboy accident in the White House" are backfiring. Mr. Bush has told Bill Sammon of the Washington Times that that the more he is unfairly attacked, the less likely liberals will be able to convince swing voters he is a bad president.  "Liberals divide into two parts," one network correspondent told me: "those who believe that when the president says he enjoys being 'misunderestimated' that's it a sign of his ignorance, and smarter ones who've figured out he is using it in a joking way to make a point about how he overcomes low expectations." Too many on the left think of Mr. Bush as dumb or an evil manipulator of public opinion, or somehow hold both views simultaneously.   Conservatives have fallen into this trap too. In the 1990s some became so angry with President Clinton that they welcomed the term "Clinton haters." They were convinced that the country would see the light and drive him from office through indictment or impeachment. It's now generally acknowledged that anti-Clinton rhetoric caused Republicans to lose House seats in the 1998 midterm election, and the country never agreed that Mr. Clinton should leave office even though his subsequent actions (such as the midnight pardon of financier Marc Rich) have convinced most historians that Clinton character flaws did indeed have public consequences.      Liberals are now equally convinced the country will see how Mr. Bush's religious fervor and Texas cockiness have led to a quagmire in Iraq and installed extremists in positions of power. No one is suggesting they must stop believing that, but in a time of war they would do both themselves and the country good if they isolated their extremists and muted their own rhetoric more. A Washington Post poll taken last month shows how hard it is to build a winning anti-Bush coalition on anger. When asked how people felt about Bush policies, on a range of enthusiastic to angry, only 18% of voters said they were angry. Even among Democrats those who were angry numbered only 30%.  Sen. Daschle tells a story about a reporter who was startled to see George McGovern attending the 1993 funeral of Pat Nixon and shaking the hand of President Nixon. When the reporter asked Mr. McGovern why he would pay his respects to the wife of a man who had used underhanded tactics to defeat him, the former Democratic presidential nominee replied simply, "You can't keep on campaigning forever." Now the country is in danger of becoming more divided in war at the same time the toxic nature of political discourse is turning off many voters. With almost six months before Election Day, here's hoping that both sides find ways to fight fire without gasoline.

      I have a problem...I support President Bush.  Usually this pronoucement is met with sighs and gasps, but I can't help it.  I support the President.  In today's political climate it seems like uttering those four words is social suicide.  People are aghast and look at you like you just told them that you have and continue to support the Nazi Party.  Call me crazy, but we live in America.  One of the greatest things about this country (for better or worse) is that we are a melting pot of ideas.  My insane notion that the President is doing a good job doesn't seem to fit.  The worst part of it is that people in a miscalculated way to write the President off, call him stupid.  "Oh that man...he is too dumb to be president".  This is the kind of haughtiness that I expect from liberals, but now it is coming from people who would not be otherwise classified as a liberal.  Calling the President stupid has been going on for decades, but what the President does is more a political strategy if anything else.  He talks plainly, something that the liberal establishment hates.  They wanted a nuancer like Kerry--someone with five answers to every problem.  In a recent Time mag article, a column described Kerry has too smart to beat Bush.  Huh?  My question is who is smarter?  The smart guy or the smart guy who plays dumb to win?  The bottom line is something I said before.  People just don't like Bush.  Not for any policy reasons.  They just don't like him and that is not a proven way to unseat an incumbent.  Hate is not a motivating political factor.  Just ask Howard Dean...

      I could not help but feel a little preturbed sitting in the parking lot otherwise known as Interstate 83 leaving Baltimore.  Traffic was snarled from downtown to the interchange at 695.  All for a police funeral.  Now, I am for honoring fallen police officers as much as the next person, but at what cost?  There must have been tens of thousands affected by the funeral procession of one man.  The entire JFX was shut down as well as the northside of the Beltway and Harrisburg Expressway to Padonia Road.  I am not saying that this man did not deserve some sort of police honor, but not at this cost.  I waited in traffic for about an hour to run simple errands, but think of the truck driver who had to make a delivery or of the business man late for an important meeting.  It just isn't worth it.  Not to mention it seemed like every police officer in the state was in a 2 mile radius of each other.  I think honoring the dead has its limitations.

      Since he was so good to list my blog on his, I will follow suit.  amarweisman.blogspot.com is a well-written and well-thought out blog that always provokes some sort of an opinion.  Once a standard-bearer of the conservative wing of the GOP, Mr. Weisman has now fused philosophy and a bit of libertarianism into his brand of conservatism--not precisely my cup of tea, but still a good read if you can navigate your way around his dog stories and questionable CD track listings.

      Monday's column by John Fund really tells a tale of a candidate and why he is going to lose.  John Kerry is too liberal for America. Plain and simple.  His campaign staff is stacked with ex-Kennedy employees.  His voting record in the Senate is the pits.  The worst part is any attempt for him to move to the center (which he should have done by now) has been met with some sort of soundbyte from the past or vote that he cast that contradicts him.  Kerry needs to find a message and find it soon.  Perhaps he should not be waiting so long to pick a VP.  The way things are going for Bush these days, Kerry should be up by about 15 points.  But it is still close.  He needs to start listening to moderate Democrats.  Listen to the Breauxs, the Libermans, the Bayhs.  For God sakes, stop listening to Kennedy and stop taking him around the country showboating him.  Kennedy does not represent the American that most Americans want!

      A few days ago, liberal California Senator Dianne Feinstein said this about the Iraqi prison photos:   They're disgusting.  If somebody wanted to plan a clash of civilizations, this is how they'd do it. These pictures play into every stereotype of America that Arabs have: America as debauched, America as hypocrites. Cheney and Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz act like they know all the answers, almost like a divine right. They don't have a divine right, and they are wrong.    While the photos maybe disgusting, I don't think the honorable Senator could have gotten it more wrong.  These photos did was not play into the  Arab  stereotype, but the terrorist stereotype.  Then the terrorist fired back confirming our stereotype of them.  What did they do?  They found an American and beheaded him on the internet.  Now, the American media, who has been played so well in this case by the terrorists, is equating one act to the other.  Excuse me, last time I checked the Iraqi prison photos did not show any brutal executions.  An American was brutally murdered and the leftist media is convinced that humiliating Iraqi   PRISONERS OF WAR  is on the same plane.  Americans are not hypocrites.  This is not to say we as Americans are always right, but we are not hypocrites.  Hypocrites are the terrorists who complain to no end about American barbarism and debauchery, but they are the most savage people on Earth, killing and maiming innocent people.  The only American hypocrites I see are the liberal media and liberal Senators like Dianne Feinstein, who seem to get their talking points from the Kerry campaign with lightning speed and precision.

      On a lighter note...  It was announced earlier that Ray Lewis would be on the cover of Madden 2005.  I am not happy because now Ray-Ray will join the likes of Vick, Culpepper, and Faulk as a future victim of the Madden curse.  By the way, Madden 2005 looks awesome.

      While I still care about this non-story, I will discuss it for a bit.  The Iraqi jail situation is, to put it lightly, not a good situation.  But what people need to do is put it within a context of war.  The prisoners were war criminals.  They were imprisoned for trying to kill American soldiers or American civilians!  They were bad people!  All of the sudden people are realizing that we use certain interrogation on these bad people for them to give us information on other bad people.  Let me tell you, we have been doing this for many years.  It was probably much worse during the Cold War.  It seems to me a bit naive of some people to be shocked and disgusted about this.  This is war.  Someone said to me the other day, "All is fair in love and war".  While it is a cliche, it holds true.  If one of these prisoners can help stop further attacks on our troops, then our soldiers should be able to use any means necessary to get this information.  Imagine if on 9/10/2001, we had captured someone who might have had information on what would occur the next day.  Wouldn't intense interrogation methods be warranted?  Wouldn't it seem necessary?    War is war.  The Iraqis never played by the rules when they pretended to surrender, then shot our soldiers.  They never apologized for any of their atrocities.  Then you have these jerks on the cable news shows talking about violations of the Geneva Convention.  WE ARE THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT FOLLOWS IT (modified: the only country with an active military.)  Not even the self-righteous French who scripted most of the rules follow it with active prison camps in South America and islands in the Mediterreanian.    It is all just plain politics during an election year.  Bush gave an apology, which I would have never have done.  Now all these people need to just be quiet.

      The few that do know what they are talking about choose to argue on a couple Bush administration policies.  They usually are the Iraq War (no one ever argues the greater War on Terror) or the economy, which in the past couple of months has become somewhat of a non-issue, yet Kerry still stumps on it.  Even in these circumstances, people are wholly misguided.  Ask anyone why they disagree with the Iraq War and they honestly can't tell you!  The usual response is "Well, we have no right being there"  No right?  This opinion doesn't seem to jibe with our foreign policy for the last 200 or so years.  What right did we have in France in 1918 or 1944?  What right did we have launching massive air campaigns over the cities of Japan in 1945?  Or perhaps we were flawed in assisting South Korea against the aggression of China and North Korea.  What do all these things have in common?  The protection of and perservation of democracy.  Now some might argue how do you protect or preserve democracy in a place where it never existed (Iraq)?  My response would be to look to the democratization of Germany and Japan.  The democracy of the Weimar Republic failed in Germany in the years after WWI and before WWII, much less did democracy ever exist there before that time.  Why did we even bother to try post-WWII?  Same thing with Japan, why bother?    The answer is simple.  As Americans, most of us believe in the intrinsic good of democracy.  It is been bred in us.  America has been a place where people of all nationalities come to escape oppression and participate in democracy.  Americans believe, with just cause, that democracy should be spread throughout the world because the will of the people is infalliable versus the will of one or few.  No greater testimony can be given to these facts than the participation of former Eastern bloc countries in Iraq.  Besides Britain and Italy, there has been no greater European supporter of our mission in Iraq then the countries that suffered under the oppression of the USSR for too many years.  They know the horrors of dictatorship and they know now the beauty of democracy.  Now they are assisting another country in that vision.

      The events of the past two weeks and actually, the past year have driven me to create this blog.  It is my purpose to add my opinion on any number of topics.  It is my view that the number one thing  that is wrong with people regarding politics, Iraq, and so on today is that they are wholly uninformed and wholly misinformed.  Most people who attempt to argue the war or the upcoming election DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT.  The crux of their arguments lie in the fac that they do not like Bush.  You ask them why don't you like Bush?  9 times out of 10 they call him arrogant or too much of a cowboy.  They can't argue any policy matters because usually they don't know too much about it.  They just don't like him, and that is not enough to have a civil discourse about.
