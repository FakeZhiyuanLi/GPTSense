      Why is dating necessary?  I mean, really.  Why?  Lately my girl and I have been asking ourselves this question and neither one of us can figure it out (she's a pessimist).  I am usually a positive person when it comes to things like this but I think she may be on to something here.  I mean, just imagine living your life to the fullest w/ all of your good friends around you.  Everyone is single, so there is no relationship drama.  If you need to fuck or "make-love", you would just find a suitable mate, do your thing, and then meet up w/ your boyz afterwards for some drinks.  Wouldn't it be nice...  I know why most people date, because they want to settle down w/ that special someone and have kids, then comes the house w/ the white picket fence.  I am not bashing that life at all, it's all good.  But couldn't you find all that without going through the excruciating process of dating.  Just close your eyes for a minute (no, i'm serious...close them) and imagine a world without arguing, fighting, biting, kicking, scratching, throwing the cat against the wall, crying, begging, beating on the door, giving up friends, and abandoning your true self...jesus, it gives me a boner just thinking about it.    And if that were the case, why would we need marriage?  We could all just be cool and get along instead of: falling in love, having kids, fighting about shit, figuring out we don't feel the same anymore, getting a divorce, fighting over the kids, and then splitting half of what we have worked all our lives for (which is usually not equal, by the way).    If I could have my good friends around me for the rest of my life knowing that none of us were going to get married, I wouldn't need a wife b/c I would have them.  And if all females did the same it would be fucking paradise!  For all those who want to raise kids, hey, just find a girl who is really cool and willing to raise a kid with you.  Then once the kid is grown and on his/her own, you can go back to absolute, uninhibited fucking hedonism.  I think the whole game of love needs to be reformed and reconstructed.  What do you guys think?

      Alright, here's the rest of my weekend continued...sort of.    So who the fuck is the lady of the Chi?  My girlfriend, who is one of the coolest chicks I've ever met.  I mean, she's fine (at least I think so), and she as an amazing body, but that's not really why I'm into her.  She's down-to-earth, not high-maintenance, intelligent, and the sex is incredible.  In fact, I've never had so much sex w/ a single person in my entire life...I don't get bored having sex w/ her (that's never really happened before).    So this weekend I'm on the way to her place from the Phish concert, hung over like you wouldn't believe, and everything is going smoothly....and then it happens.  Traffic.  Son-of-a-bitch!!!  This weekend was "The Taste of Chicago", and it was like the whole god-damn world was descending upon downtown.  I mean, WTF is goin' on here?  I lived in Houston for almost 4 years, and traffic in Houston is horrible....but the worst traffic I ever dealt w/ in H-town had nothing on the traffic coming into Chicago this weekend.  To make it even worse...I was tired as hell and hung over!  Of course when I got there it was all worth it, and we wasted no time at all in getting down to business.  I didn't even take her skirt off....too much work.  Of course she didn't complain, she's always down for the cause.  We're talking about some hot-ass sex here, people.  I mean, the chemistry is just there....some people have to try over-and-over to find that.  Hell, some people never do.  And what's even better....after the sexual olympics is over, we can still hang out and have a good time.  Yep, it's true, I think we gotta keeper here.  At this point I could make this a very dirty post and give all the explicit details of our sexual adventures, but then again, that's what the imagination is for.  Besides, it's really nothing that spectacular, I mean, we don't dress up or use toys or anything like that.  The sex is too damn good, there's no time for that stuff and it's too damn distracting as far as I'm concerned.  Besides, I love this girl and there are just some things that are better left alone.   What more can I possibly say, besides, this time I've struck gold (at least so far it looks that way).  This girl is smart, she works for her own shit, she's good looking and her body is bangin', and of course there's the sex....which is great.  I think I'd be a complete idiot if I did anything to fuck this up...hence the words in my profile, "Ex-hedonist".  Sometimes you have to sacrifice the pleasure of many, for the love of one....I think it's worth it.  What do you think?

      Ok, I just posted a fucking novel about marriage that was kinda mellow, ok it was like getting shot in the ass w/ a tranquilizer dart (which probably isn't the best feeling by the way).  So now I'm gonna post a few things that aren't so boring.    I just witnessed an amazing thing.  I was at the Phish concert @ Alpine Valley Friday night.  The concert was awesome of course, I don't even listen to Phish but going to one of their concerts is an experience that everyone should have.  Unfortuntately it's one of their last ones ever so that made it even better.    By the end of the concert, let's just say I was seeing visuals that Monet couldn't have painted if he wanted to.  Here's the recipe for success if you want an idea of my experience:  1) 3 pot brownies 2) about 12-15 beers (over a 10 hour period) 3) 3 caps of mushroomz (not the stuff you buy at at Jewel) 4) a couple bowls (or joints, or a blunt) of some very good weed 5) a hot-ass hippie chick doing the weirdest dance you've ever seen right next to you the whole entire night  If you follow my recipe to the "T", you will have an experience that you'll not soon forget.  Good times....good times indeed.  It was so funny b/c I was totally in control of my senses, but I was fucking wasted beyond belief.  And the beautiful thing is that everyone around me was just as bad or worse.  My pupils were probably so dilated that I looked like an alien, but nobody realized b/c they were probably fucked up and seeing flying saucers themselves.  So halfway through the concert, after nodding my head through almost the entire 1st set, I decided to put aside my pride and join in the ritualistic Phish dance...which is absolutely the funniest thing a sober person has ever seen.  Luckily I had left my sober-self behind a long time ago.  But instead of calling it the "silly drunk bastard dance" or something like that....I decided to name it, "the drunkymunky dance", naturally.  It was an instant hit and the whole damn place erupted w/ applause and everyone followed suit.....at least that's what the mushroomz told me. >=)  All in all, a good night despite the fact that I was still fucked up the following day and had to drive to Chicago to see my baby (girl)....not my baby girl, I don't have a baby, but "my girl" as in my girlfriend...damn it! (that didn't sound right)   In the next post I will go into....."my love affair w/ the lady of the Chi...."

      This post is actually a comment on a post that someone very close to me wrote.  It was basically a marriage-bashing post in which the person says that marriage is pointless, it's for losers, and you can't really be yourself or some rubbish like that if you are married.  Jesus....let me say a few things about this.  First of all...I am probably the last person in the world who would write a post in defense of marriage, mostly b/c I'm a self-proclaimed recovering sex addict and ex-hedonist who's really never settled down at all in life.  But in this post I will be defending marriage.  I'm not gonna list all the reasons why people should get married or try to disprove any theories on why marriage is a bad thing.  Instead, I'm going to give my perspective on marriage, what it means to me, and then let you draw your own conclusions about what it is to you.  As I said before, I am the last person in the world who should be defending this sacred thing that is marriage.  I despise the whole game of finding a suitable mate, then going through all the necessary bullshit just to get to the point where you decide "this is the person that I'm going to spend the rest of my life with."  But I also love the idea that there is someone out there  for me , and that when the time is right I'll find them and we'll settle down and grow old together.  I have always loved and adored women.  I love meeting new and exciting people.  I love going places and getting that exhilarating feeling you get when you've just met a beautiful new face w/ an incredible personality.  I don't want to ever give that up.  I want to live in a hedonist society where me and my guys run around the world shagging the hell out of all the beautiful girls we come across and never having to settle down with any one of them.  I want to meet a girl out somewhere, let lust take over, and have sex right there on the spot, not having to worry about the consequences of my actions.  Obviously, this is not the way the world works, and if your world does work this way....you'll probably end up catching some incurable disease and dying a very painful death way ahead of your time.  The fact is, after you've lived your life:  done your drugs, drank as much liquor as your liver can handle, had several one-night stands (if you choose), ran through your neighborhood naked, etc....you can confidently settle down w/ someone else who has also lived their life.    I've always had good role models around me when it comes to married couples; people who are madly in love w/ each other,  and even though it's been several years (in the case of my parents, decades), they are still passionate for each other.  That is what marriage is about, it's about finding someone to share your life experiences with, and to basically grow old with.    Right now the thought of marriage makes me wanna puke...not out of disgust, but out of pressure.  I mean, spending the rest of your life w/ someone?  That's a lot of responsibility bearing down on anyone, much less a 23 year-old recovering sex addict.  But after I've partied, travelled, met tons of people and seen tons of things, at some point I  will  have the desire to live out the rest of my life w/ someone I love and can share my experiences with.    Let's face it....nobody wants to grow old and die alone.  Being single and living life on your own terms, not being tied down, being able to do what you want whenever you want to....that all sounds appealing right now.  But let's see how that shit sounds when you're 40 something, going on 50.  It's not going to be as appealing when everyone else around you is w/ someone, you're not as hot as you once were, and the highlight of your day is some weak-ass TV program.  So as far as the fear of marriage goes....I think the alternative is much worse in the end.    Sorry, I didn't mean for this post to be so damn reflective...I'll make the next one more entertaining.  Your comments are appreciated....(that means, don't just read my post and stand there like a fucking loser pondering what I've said, make your thoughts known...)

      I told myself I was gonna post to this blog every day so that I could vent and get all my anger and frustration out and not have to end up on the news, however, I am not going to be able to pull that off just yet.    Last night I had the most interesting convo w/ my girl about relationships and whether or not they are a foregone conclusion.  If they are...why even bother?    I have been reading some pretty interesting stuff from other people, I'm definitely gonna put up some links to other blogs worthy of note, but once again I don't have the time right now.  I'm going to one of the last Phish concerts ever today (this should be interesting), and then driving from WI to Chicago to see my girl.  So when I get back Sunday night I will have hella-fied shit to say and that will be guaranteed entertainment.  Until then kids....good-day.

      Don't worry, I'm not gonna bore you w/ my life's story or why I started this blog.  I'm too lazy to write it all out and nobody would really give a shit anyway, right?  All I can say is that if you don't like it you can a) cry about it, b) get mad @ what I say (but who cares b/c nobody's listening to you), c) blame my girlfriend b/c she's the one that got me into this.    I'm not sure what to write about at the moment but I've gotta start somewhere.  I read an interesting post today by this guy who is recording his experiences w/ his girlfriend and how he is basically sexually frustrated.  This is obviously a dramatic over-simplification but you can read the post  urlLink  here  ...good entertainment.    I find it hard to believe that we make things like relationships and sex such a big deal, like it's so hard to figure out.  I mean, some situations are difficult, granted, but it's definitely not rocket science.  Find someone you're attracted to, make sure they're not a complete whore, then hop on the good foot and do the bad thing.    I guess I've been lucky so far in that I haven't really had any situations where I was guessing what the other person was thinking or trying to "make things better."  The minute I thought things weren't going very good, I bailed.  That's right, I was fucking gone.  No sob stories, no trying to make things better, no waiting to see how things work out.  I wasn't a prick about it either, instead I would just explain that we weren't right for each other and not to be sad because there are millions of people in America alone that would probably be perfect for you.  Of course it's never this easy but people do make things way too hard.    I'm not going to say anything further on the subject b/c I don't have to time and I really just wanted to get a post up today.  I could talk on this subject and others like it for weeks at a time, and I will.  All I wanna say right now is thank God I met a girl who understands (at least a little) where I'm coming from and doesn't like games or drama (the sex is good too).  For all those struggling in relationships and such, good luck w/ that and stay tuned for more wordz from the drunkymunky.

      Here's a little dialogue for ya...  &nbsp;    1:  What the hell? What’s going on?    2:  (waking up) What are you talking about?    1:  Why is it doing this?    2:  Doing what?    1:  Can’t you feel that? It’s shaking all over the place.    2:  Why the hell are you slowing down? I want to get home, I’m fuckin’ tired.    1:  I’ve got it all the way to the floor and it’s not doing a damn thing. What the&nbsp;hell's wrong with it?    1:  Shit, the orange light just came on.    2:  What are you talkin’ about?    1:  I’m telling you the orange light just came on.    2:  You didn’t stop to get gas, what the hell is wrong with you, man?    1:  Fuck you! We’re out in the middle of nowhere, I can’t see a god-damn light around for miles, and you were supposed to stay awake and tell me where to get off. How the hell am I supposed to know what’s goin’ on. All I know is that we’re on “E”.    2:  Come on man, quit playin’.    1:  Do I look like I'm&nbsp;playin'?    2:  Just punch it man…punch it!    1:  Dude, are you fucking stupid? We ran out of gas. We aren’t going anywhere!    2:  Where the&nbsp;hell are we?    1:  I just saw a sign that said it was 60 miles to the city.    2:  What! Are you fucking kidding me, man?    1:  You didn’t tell me where to get off, genius.    2:  You passed our exit over an hour ago! Man, you’re&nbsp;incredible….    20 minutes later…     1:  Why is nobody coming? This is America, there’s always somebody on the highway.    2:  This is Texas, and trust me, you don’t want whoever is out on this highway at this time of night to stop and help us. We would be better off walking back to the city.    1:  Well then, what the hell are we waiting for?    2:  Forget it, let’s just go to sleep and somebody will come get us in the morning.    1:  Fuck that man! I’m not going to sleep on the side of the road in the middle of “Texas Chainsaw” land.    2:  Hey, you see those lights off in the distance?    1:  Yeah, but that’s like five miles away.    2:  It’s more like two, and we have no other choice. You wanna sit here and wait for some psycho to come knocking on our window with a chainsaw?    1:  Fine, but he’s coming with, he’s the biggest one of us and if somebody tries to mess with us, he’ll beat the shit out of ‘em.    2:  Yo, wake up! Get up! We have to walk a couple of miles up the road and see if we can get some help.    1:  Hey man, get your ass up!    3:  (Waking up and pissed off) Will you please shut the fuck up! I’m drunk as hell, and unless you want me to throw up all over your car, I would stop talking…right now!    1:  Dude, in case you haven’t noticed, we broke down in the middle of&nbsp;no where. If we stay in the car somebody’s gonna come along and kill us.    3:  Whatever man, I don’t give a damn. Just lock the doors and leave me the fuck alone, I ain’t walking no where.    1:  God! The one time we really need him and he decides to be a lazy prick. How did this shit happen? Shit like this only happens in the movies. We’re gonna die out here tonight.    2:  Shut up, let’s go!    15 minutes later…     2:  I think that’s an exit up there, isn’t it?    1:  I don’t know, but I’m sure as hell not going down that road.    2:  That’s where that light is coming from.    1:  Dude, there could be crazy&nbsp;people in that place, doing god knows what, to god knows who.    2:  You think I want to walk down that dark-ass road to some barn in the middle of&nbsp;nowhere? What choice do we have?    1:  You crazy son of a bitch. If I die it’s your fault.    2:  Fine, whatever.    Moments later…     2:  Hey, do you hear that?    1:  Yeah, it sounds like a steel saw or something like that. Dude, they’re chopping up dead bodies in there. I’m getting the fuck out of here.    2:  Quit being a pussy! It’s probably just some people working the late shift.    1:  They could be sawing up dead bodies in that place. Are you out of your god-damn mind? Let’s get the fuck out of here!    2:  Fine, then you go back and I’ll get some help.    1:  You prick, I knew you were gonna play that card.    Approaching the barn….     1:  Hey, do you hear voices?    2:  Yeah, but what the hell are they saying.    1:  I don’t know, I can’t understand a god-damn word they’re saying.    2:  Do they even speak English?    1:  I don’t know…listen.    2:  Man this place must be like a steel mill or something. Look at all the heavy equipment, perfect for cuttin’ up bodies.    1:  That shit’s not funny right now man.    2:  They don’t speak English…we’re totally screwed. We ran out of gas in the middle of fucking nowhere, and now we’ve managed to find a barn with people actually working, but nobody speaks English. This is as bad as it gets, man. It doesn’t get any worse than this.    1:  How the hell are we going to tell them that we ran out of gas and need a ride to the gas station?    2:  How the hell should I know.    1:  Wait, what did he say?    2:  Man, do I speak Spanish?    1:  (signalling with hands) Our car broke down. We ran out of gas. Can you give us a ride?   No, to the gas station.   You can? Thank God! Wait, I can’t understand you. You want us to wait here? For how long?    2:  What the hell is he trying to say? I ain’t waitin’ here man, no fuckin’ way.    1:  Shut up! You were acting all tough just a second ago.    1:  Are you serious? We have to wait here until 5 am? Fuck it…    1:  Son of a bitch! Damn it man, this is your fault. If you would’ve just stayed awake like I told you, I wouldn’t have missed the exit and we would be sleeping at your house right now.    2:  Fuck you! You’re the genius who missed the exit we were supposed to take.    1:  You don’t have to worry about the “Texas Chainsaw” guy, ‘cause when we get back to your house, I’m gonna kill you myself!    2:  Man, you’re a prick…    1:  (laughing) This has been one hell of a night.

      every time we came home they would be happy to see us...  if they started barking we could tell them to shut the f*ck up and they would actually listen...  there would be absolutely NO talking back...  to keep them happy all we would have to do is give 'em a "bone" every once in awhile...  they would always be loyal no matter what...  they would keep other men  out  of the house instead of letting them in....

      This is the second day in a row that I've woke up to a mild-to-moderate hang over.  I didn't even have that much to drink last night.  All I remember is talking to a couple of decent looking chicks (ok, so they were more than decent) @ my friends house after the bar, and then......nothing.    That's all I can remember, I woke up this morning in my bed as if I never even went out last night.  I think I even posted a reply to a comment from M.N., I don't remember that either.  I have 3 or 4 new #'s in my phone that I don't recognize (i'm a socialite, so that doesn't mean anything), and I think I wanted to call my girl but I probably passed out before I got the chance.  That's another thing....my girl lives and hour and a half away, and everytime I go out in this god-forsaken place, everyone is either hooking up to have sex or going home w/ their significant other to have sex.  Where does this leave me, the drunkymunky?  It leaves me going home early w/ nothing to do but plot and scheme on how I can go see her, or making myself fall asleep before I do something stupid.  Deliver yourself from evil, right?  That's probably why I left my friends house last night.....to make sure my drunkymunky stayed in my pants.  Just kidding baby....  >=)

      If you want sex....you gotta give her the right drink.  It is a scientific fact that Sambuca increases blood flow to a women's "secret garden", thus making her more horny than usual.  Add to this, the right ambiance and the right moves and you are virtually guaranteed to get some luv.    You're welcome for the tip....

      ...for my girlfriend, that is.  She came out here this weekend, won't say where b/c I'm too god-damned embarrassed.    It's amazing how being around somebody can make a place that is so fucking boring, so fucking beautiful.  I thoroughly enjoyed myself this weekend.  The company was great and the sex was amazing.  If a woman orgasms twice in less than 10 min, I think you could call that good sex, right?  Jesus...it felt incredible.

      My girl was looking sexy as hell last night. Skin tight jeans, heels, and a halter w/ no bra....blazin'. It wasn't easy keeping my munkey in my pants while we waited for "the man" to start his set. She wasn't helping the situation at all by teasing the hell out of me while I waited for drinks at the bar, either. At one point I was about to say "fuck it" and take her home before we even got to see the main event. Luckily, we managed to find entertainment in some people jumping around like wild animals to some wicked-ass thumping house music that was so loud it could almost change your heartbeat.  So finally around 1:40 am, Farina gets up in the booth and sets the fucking decks on fire. The shit was hot. And I don't give a damn what kind of music you're into, Mark Farina has a way of seducing you w/ his jazzy-ass deep house grooves with bass that would probably measure 7.0 on the richter scale. You can't help but appreciate the shit.  Anyway....my girl and I are just chillin, watching this hot-ass girl move her body like you've never seen before, and while we are both taking in the scenery all I can think about is taking her (my girl) home and crushin some guts. I'm definitely a sex addict, and so is she, but last night I was fiendin like never before. She has a bangin bod and the halter w/ no bra was just killing me. So we left about 2:30, even though the music was really starting to get good, b/c I couldn't wait any longer. Talk about an addiction.....  Finally, we get back to her house and I play the old "I'm tired" routine. Of course this throws her into attack mode and before long her lips are hugging my munky in a way that just can't be described on this blog. After I got off (which was obviously quicker than usual b/c I wanted her so damn much), my not-so-little friend was still awake. Usually he has to take a short nap before round two but this time he was like, "bring it on beyaatch!" So after she got off a couple times, we figured we should move to the floor to cut down on the noise factor a little bit. Without the distraction of a headboard and all the other noises associated w/ sex in the bed, it was time to really have some fun. After several more deep thrusts, some dirty talking, and a lot of heavy breathing....she got off once more and I finally climaxed for the second time. End of story.  In the morning, I tried to get some luv before getting ready....nope, denied. It's one of the first times I've been rejected. Usually she's the one that wakes me up in the morning to fulfill my duty. Go figure, the one time I'm wide awake and ready to go....nothing. Women are weird creatures. But that's another post all together.  Chau

      To summarize what would be a short novel of a post....  My girlfriend's sister is putting her through hell and basically trying to sabotage our relationship b/c she thinks I'm not good enough for her.  I can't say anything about her b/c it's my girl's sister, but let's just say she has some issues she needs to deal with.  She seems like the type of person who can only be happy when everything is going the way she wants it...and we all know what this means....she's going to be 40 years old, miserable, and taking about 15 anti-depressant pills just to make it through the day, b/c NO ONE can have it their way all the time.  She's a fucking control-freak.    The whole situation is really sad, and if I didn't absolutely adore my girl, I would run like hell and never look back.  It's the kind of shit that makes you wanna drop bombs on people, but like I said...can't mess w/ the family.

      Be very careful about what you say and do around the people you love (i.e. family), b/c you can never fully comprehend how much it can influence them.
