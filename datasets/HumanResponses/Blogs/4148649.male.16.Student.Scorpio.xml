      Well, since I'm refusing to talk about my personal life today...  Let's talk about education.  School - what a terrible word.  Our schoosl really need higher standards, you know? The High Schools, I mean.  Universities, Colleges, those you can pick - you have limited selection in primary and secondary schools. I return to school on Monday.  I will start the day going to my homeroom, where I will receive a schedule (not a clue if I got what I requested and what I have when until that point) and a locker, along with many papares for myself and my parents to sign. I will then proceed to four other classes, going over rules, receiving textbooks, and such.  Most of these classes will be half of what the State standards require for a classroom that contains as many students as each of ours normally does.  As we approach lunch, the building will heat up.  Excepting the computer labs and library, and the trailer rooms, the building will be swelteringly hot in these nice 90 degree days.  Now, it gets hotter - when I lived in Texas, it got to be 112 regularly.  But when you're tryign to learn, and your arm sticks to your papers, and sweat is getting in your eyes, and you feel as if you are in a steam bath, tell me, how much education are you really getting?  From fifth period I head to my half hour lunch; an open lunch, since school is located right near downtown.  Amazingly, although smoking is restricted, students cluster in parking lots to do so.  In an alley which many of us stay clear of, the smell of pot is in the air.  At a drive-through place, people miraculously obtain beer and other things, although you don't see that as much at lunch - going to class drunk would of course cause problems.   After returning, talking to friends or girlfriend (If I have one currently) I might visit the bathroom, which may or may not smell like smoke, or maybe pot again, I go on to my other classes, in even more heat.  Also, a coupel of times a group at my school has approached the principal about beginning a school-recognized Bible Club.  We have been snubbed on both occasions.  Another thing,  there's the cafeteria - we get our food from the grade school down the street.  There isn't enough food or space for all of us, even if we wanted to eat there.   There are even more issues, such as the rumors about an affair between staff members, a manic librarian,  thieves, and expensive supplies (100+ dollar calculators??).  In response to all these issues?  Well, I was at the school for a Key Club event - they seem to have installed security cameras at all of the entrances. Touching.  We going to take pictures as the guy with a gun strolls in and shoots, or whatever?  Sounds effective.

      Today... tomorrow... what difference could it possibly make.  What do you do when you are hopelessly, inescapably caught in a trap? A trap that you both like and dislike, wish for and deny... that one called love. Of course, if you haven't guessed, this is all about a girl... girls cause problems... lol Some of you may have never really had this before, this feeling. See, it's indescribably different than having a crush on someone. You just... feel. It's different - I've hade plenty of crushes, and 'likes'. I should know.  I found some resemblence to my situation in a song by Shania Twain, lol. "...and it only hurts when I'm breathing, My heart only breaks when it's beating, My dreams only die when I'm dreaming, So I'll hold my breath, to forget..."  Sad that I can relate to songs but then Country does that to people. So what is there to do? In impossible stuations like this one, not much. It's a lose-lose situation. No matter what you do or say... Well. My heart's breaking, dreams are dying, and I can't hold my breath.  Will write more tomorrow when I'm more sane. 2:00 am can get depressing. like Andy says:  The Game Is Flawed

      Why me? lol  Sometimes I wish dearly that I could have a normal life.  Although you'd have to define normal...  It just... for those of you who're Christian, ever wonder why God sends some things your way?  Man.  More later when I'm thinking coherently. :)

      You've all heard the story, haven't you? It goes something like this:  A man looked back at a picture of his life, after he had passed away and was in God's prescence. All his life, he had walked along a beach, and there were two sets of footprints in the sand. He had walked with God as long as he could remember, and the other set of footprints was His. He looked at the represented timeline, and suddenly noticed something odd - at each palce where a crisis and hard time occured in his life, there was only one set of footprints in the sand. Heartbroken, he turned to God and said, "God, why did you abandon me during my times of true need? For there is only one set of footprints in the sand during those times." God looked at the man and smiled sadly. "My child. I was with you always." The man replied insistently, "But there is only one set of footprints there!" "Yes," God answered, "During the times when you were the most needing, there I carried you."  Or something like that. Sometimes I have to remind myself that God is with me. Through troubling times in my life, spiritual, emotional, and physical lows. When I'm having a self-conflict over that girl... or maybe becoming lazy in my spirtual walk with God, or am keeping angry with a friend.  Always remember that once you know Him, God will never leave you - ever.
