      First off let me say "I eat meat!"  As soon as I had teeth, I was chewing on a t-bone steak.  I've always eaten meat and I always will.  Why?  Because it's so fucking good!  If people don't like that, tough shit.  I grew up on a farm and we raised pigs and chickens and cows.  We didn't raise them so they could have a nice and peaceful life where we could enjoy their companionship, we raised them to EAT.  Let me also say PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),  FUCK YOU!   We didn't mistreat these animals in any way, in fact we treated them pretty fucking good.  We provided them food, shelter from the blistering heat and mind numbing cold, hell, we even hauled them fresh warm water in the winter when all they had was a shitty ice block to lick at. We gave them something and they gave us food and sustenance.  The way they were slaughtered was a hell of a lot better than the way, say a lion, kills a wildebeest.  There was no slow pain, it was instant.  PETA says that we should all be vegetarians.  Do you honestly believe that no animals are killed during the harvesting of fruit, vegetables, grains, etc...?  Do you have any idea of how many cute little rabbits and rodents and birds are killed during the harvest of grain or corn or sugar beets or potatoes?  So how can you justify the killing of SOME animals as opposed to the killing of MORE animals?  The truth is we acknowledge that we are slaughtering animals  but  we use what we kill.  This is an educated guess but I bet 90%+ of say a cow is used.  We use the hides for  clothing and shoes, we use the bones for Jello or glue, and of course we use the meat.  In the end there are only two people that I have to answer to.  Myself and God.  I don't give one flying fuck what PETA, or Vegans, or vegetarians, or vegetarians who will eat cheese and milk, or vegetarians that will eat poultry or fish but not beef have to think about what I do or eat.  If I can stand in front of God with a clear conscience, then why the hell should I care what you think?  And to the people who disagree with me,  FUCK YOU!   Unless you are living in a house that you created with your own two hands from materials that YOU crafted that has no electricity (Yes animals are harmed to create your precious electricity. You can't tell me that a hydroelectric plant doesn't kill fish or affect anything downstream.) and all of your food is grown BY YOU in your back yard and all of your clothes were made BY YOU with natural animal free fibers then  SHUT THE FUCK UP!   Oh and by the way, the computer that you are reading this on, was created by chemicals and processes that produce toxic waste that undoubtedly kill people AND animals.  So FUCK YOU! and I'll go back to my processed chicken McNuggets and my Double Whopper with cheese and bacon.

       Hi all.  Recently I had a major reality check.  I was diagnosed recently with ET (Essential Tremor) about five months ago, which is a disease that is very similar to Parkinson's, but is five times more common.  The symptoms occur regularly but not 100% of the time.  For those that don't know, ET (a hereditary neurological disorder) causes your extremities to shake uncontrollably and it's not something that has been real easy to live with.  Because of this disease, I've been on disability and unable to work since the end of February.  This has been probably the hardest thing to deal with in my entire life.  My maternal grandfather had Parkinson's disease for as long as I could remember.  The difference between he and I was he shook constantly and mine is only intermittent (plus he was one of the greatest men I have ever known.).  I used to watch him shake and really had no idea how it affected him and my disease doesn't even compare to the intensity of Parkinson's, but I now have a new found respect for my Grandpa.  He was so determined to do anything he could for himself.  He felt that if he stopped doing things for himself then he wouldn't be able to do them after he quit doing them and he was right.  My mom told me how he would kneel down on the bed with his electric razor in his hand and move his face around the razor just to get himself shaved.  I remember going to restuarant's and watching my Grandma or Mom feed him and thought nothing of it.  But now when I'm out in public I notice people watching my hands shake and they stare or point, and I don't really know how I feel about it.  Every day I think "Why is the Lord putting me through this pain and misery?"  I set at home every day and feel sorry for myself and then I look at some of my neighbors next door who are very physical and mentally challenged and I think that I don't have it all that bad, and that makes me feel even worse for being selfish about my predicament.  No matter what your situation is, there is always someone who would trade places with you in a heartbeat.  Lately I spend 99% of my time alone but I do have GREAT friends and family who support me.  I realize that they can't always be there since most of them are married or live to far away to make being around always impractical, but that doesn't make their friendship any better or worse.  The emotional support has been phenomenal.  Thank you all for helping me make it through this extremely tough time.  It's not over yet, but I know with friends like all of you I will make it through with flying colors.
