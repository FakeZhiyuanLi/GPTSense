       So, [yes Annisa, sabar, i know you've been waiting for me to post this blog, but let me just give a brief introduction] today in math class i got nothing to do (well, actually there are MANY things to do but let's just pretend i got none. hehe). i was daydreaming... thinking of hot guys - from one hot guy to another until i got the idea to list top ten hot guys special! my version. oh i remember somthing; last nite a lizard fell off onto my bed while i was tryin to sleep. DAMN LIZZARD!!! anyway, back to the topic. here is the list:       TOP TEN HOT GUYS ** [ANGEL'S VERSION]          1. Doug Pickett [model of A&F, Polo as well as Angel's boyfriend. ~the cutest guy ever!!!]                2. The Carlson Twins [Kyle &amp; Lane, models/actors, Angel's threesome fantasy. Double pleasure. Yea baby!! ;)]        3. Bruno Santos [model of Versace, Emporio Armani - Brazillians are sooo sexxxyyyy!!]        4. Chris Carmack [model of A&F/actor (the one in the O.C) - For the first time ever i find a blond guy can be very attractive]                5. Eduardo Verastegui [actor/singer/model (the one in J.Lo's video clip "Ain't It Funny" - Super HOT]                6. James Franco [actor - i wouldnt have watched Spiderman if he wasnt there!]                7. Julian McMahon [actor - LOVE his blue eyes! and his six pack, of course]                8. Ian Thorpe [Australian youngest swimmer/model too - hot hoT hOT HOT!!!]                9. Brad Pickert [model/Cosmogirl's eye candy - totally hot/cute/sexy/yummy/fuckable]                10. Johnny Bravo [hehe, but he's still hot as a cartoon character, you know!]                ** Please note that the list is not in order since its very hard to decide whos hotter than the other**           God is sooo unfair; He created those beautiful creatures far away from me.... why oh why...                   Later on today, Annisa came back to class (before that she was outside studying computer for the test tomorrow. God Annisa, ure such a geek!!) and i asked her to do the same thing. Here's the list:         TOP TEN HOT GUYS [ANNISA'S VERSION]:          1. James Marsden [God, I could stare into his blue eyes forever. And his dimples.. ooh, and when he sings, he has the SEXIEST voice] So fuckable...   >>                 2. Orlando Bloom [never before have I found a guy in a blonde wig so hot. His curly hair... his British accent... yummy!]    >                 3. Tom Welling [I love his smile! Take me superman, I'm yours!!]   >                4. Freddie Prinze Jr. [Oh Freddie, why did you have to marry Sarah Michelle Gellar? Couldnt you have waited for me? Sigh... I fell in love with you in She's All That, and have loved you ever since]                5. HRH Prince William [He has the most adorable grin, he's a genuine good guy and he's a fucking prince! AND, he has a British accent!]   >                  6. Matthew Goode [He is the reason why i love that movie, Chasing Liberty. Goode? Aww yeah!]                7. Shane West [His acting in A Walk To Remember moved me to tears. He's my "bad boy"]                8. The young Rob Lowe in the Outsiders [He made last year's bahasa project interesting. If I could go back in time, I'd go back to the days when he was still cute]   >                  9. Josh Duhamil [Great Bod, great smile, great guy]  Angel says: Hmm, not sure if put the rite picture>>                 10. Jesse Bradford [3 words: Bring It On!

       aah, finally i found j.lo's i'm glad video clip on Kazaa. and i spotted travis fimmel the tarzan guy in it!! he lookd so cute... his hair wasnt blonde... and j.lo's hair was wavy she lookd so pretty!!! and i like the dance so much!! too bad chris judd was also there. i dont like him. he with his armpit hair is yucky.   j.lo's voice is soo, soo soft... so calming...so unique, unlike beyonce, kelly rowland, christina aguilera, or ashanti etc. yes, they DO have nice voice but its simply too ordinary. if all of them sing together in one song, it'll be hard for people to distinguish their voice, but if j.lo sings along (whats the word? collaborates?) with other singers (like the one in Whats Going On), it'll be very easy to recognize her voice.  hmm.. no wonder in the first week since her latest album was released, 200,000 copies have been successfully sold. but i wonder why many people dont like her voice...
