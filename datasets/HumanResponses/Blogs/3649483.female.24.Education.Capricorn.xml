      This is a call to all you sleepin souls  Wake up and take control of your own cipher  And be on the lookout for the spirit snipers  tryin to steal your light, y'knowhutI'msayin?  Look within-side yourself, for peace  Give thanks, live life and release  - Public Enemy 'He Got Game'  A recent Village Voice article,  urlLink Generation Debt  which is part of an ongoing series of articles about my generation details how a college education no longer guarantees much beyond a mountain of debt. As the article elucidates through a series of interviews with 20-somethings struggling under the weight of their college debt and mediocre job prospects, the idea of a career never mind a well paying job is quickly dwindling. What really struck me wasn't the subject matter - as a recent college graduate myself with 60,000 dollars of undegrad debt and a job that pays half as much while I struggle to make ends meet in New York City, I don't need to read an article to develop an understanding of the difficulties facing 20-somethings.   What struck, and angered me were the interviewee's, and by consequence the articles, tacit acceptance, that yes while things are terrible this is how they have to be and you had better plan accordingly for it.   My mother says I came out of the womb stubborn, and have only gotten worse as I've aged. And maybe it's stubborness, or just youthful idealism as my sixty-something co-worker calls it, but I just don't think that the world has to be such a difficult place for so many of it's human (and non-human) inhabitants to live.  Yes we have a system that, like something out of the Matrix has mutated into a self-serving beast, dedicated towards supporting itself instead of the people who created it, and bending them to it's will; but it doesn't HAVE To be that way. We've CHOSEN to let it be that way. And by 'we' I mean the you and me, ordinary citizens - and I  mean  citizens - not consumers of planet earth. We've given up. We've decided to accept things as they are, saying that 'communism doesn't work', 'socialism doesn't work' SO FREAKING WHAT? Maybe they don't work. But that doesn't mean we have to stop looking for something that works better. Something that allows us to devote more of our lives to meaningful activities instead of turning us into a spectator class. That goes to work each day and returns home at night, our sole function to consume.   And that's the thing.  Most of the people of my generation (I'm 24) seem to come from one of two camps. They're resigned to the system and going to do their darndest to thrive within it. Or they dislike the system but feel like they're powerless to do anything about it.  But they're not powerless.  I'm not powerless.  You are not powerless.  Want proof? In Serbia the brutal dictator Milosevic was thrown out of power, not by the UN - they were unsuccessful. Not by the American army - we were unsuccessful. But by peasants. Rural people who refused to mine coal, who refused to ship food to the cities. Who refused to prop up  his   system.   I wonder what would happen if we all decided enough was enough. If we stopped buying things we didn't need or didn't want? If we lived lower on the totem pole. Told our employers they could take their jobs and shove it. Gave the government the finger.   Things would change.  But things won't change as long as we think the situation is hopeless. As long as we think we are mere cogs in a machine. But remember...even a machine won't work without it's cogs.   The ones in power, have that power only because we give it to them.  So turn off entertainment tonight. Close people. Give Paris Hilton the finger. Take your power back and DO Something. Whatever your values are (assuming they don't involve hurting or killing anyone) get off your fat ass (assuming your American - it's ok I'm plump too) and do something to make the world the kind of place you want to live in.  Join  urlLink  Join Me   and do a random act of kindness every Friday. Do the thing that you're too chicken to do. Do what you want instead of what you SHOULD do. VOTE! Even if you hate all the politicians. Vote for Mickey Mouse. It says a lot more if you go to the polls and vote for someone crazy, then if you don't vote at all - it shows your active, it shows you care, and it shows you hate the current politicians. If enough people voted their heart, politicians would have to start acting with theirs.   Did you know the way we vote is mathematically worst way to vote? No. Well go to   urlLink Fair Vote  learn how our voting system is flawed and work with them to make sure that the votes that are counted actually matter.   Refuse to be a part of the economy until the economy is a part of you. Buy used, buy  urlLink locally grown ... urlLink Freecycle  and give away the stuff you don't need and get your hands on some stuff you do need - for free. Create a  urlLink Shadow Economy  - only a legal, and morally correct one that people can benefit from, but no one can profit from.  Join a community organization. Talk to a neighbor. Smile at a stranger. Make a political  urlLink t-shirt  Give up your SUV.  Give up your car. Walk places. Hitchike. Jay walk.  urlLink Disconnect your TV  Write A Book Quit Your Job and move to the country. Go to  urlLink  Cuba  Read Manufacturing Consent...or Watch the movie  Just do something, and never ever ever accept that you are too weak to enact change.   If you think you are too small to be effective, you have never been in bed with a mosquito.  - Betty Reese
