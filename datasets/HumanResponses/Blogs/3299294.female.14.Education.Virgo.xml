but too bad he got a gerl fren hu is much better den mi..
actualli mani NPCC cadets have feelings toward him too..
haix.. during Swearing-in for d sec 1(2003), SK n SG veri close together like good fren..
den after the parade, SG suddenly sae like mi.. den wan mi gif him chance etc..
but i first new him, how to like him?..
but one time when he call and my junior is beside him, call him and sae dat i like SK..
And dat time i oso admit le.. cos i agree dat no CI can stead with their cadet one wad..
haix.. den he abit angri lol.. den sae next time he wont fan mi etc..
haix.. he reli gave mi a veri excellent impression of himself..
almost mani of my fren all sae he not handsome or wad, but i dun reli gif a damn..
like someone doesnt mean muz be handsome.. s long s u noe their character n how dey are like can le ma... y muz like dat.. but those pep0le hu like to comment, their stead oso not handsome, so y stead?..
haix.. but till now, i still hve d same impression when i first new him..
haix.. i admit dat i started to like SG.. but is reli impossible one lolx..
cos maam oso dun allow BGR..
unless i left skool with a SI rank and go for CI rank, so dat i can be wit him le lolx..
