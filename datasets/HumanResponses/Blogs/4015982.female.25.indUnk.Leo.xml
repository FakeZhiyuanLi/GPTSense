      so it was raining a little before we left to go to the show..but when we left things had cleared up.. the 15 minute walk was okay, and the first 5 or 10 minutes of the show were fine.. then it started drizzling..  and then the ceilings opened up and it poured and poured for the rest of the show..  funny enough, before we left, my blow dryer broke before i was finished drying my hair, and i was kinda upset that i was going out with wet hair..  15 minutes into the show, we were soaked to the bone.  soaked.  you have no idea.  i should have taken a picture.  but, aside from the rain, which wasn't even that bad, since it wasn't all that cold out, the show was FREAKIN' AMAZING!!  i heart the trews, what can i say. they are in kingston this week, and if i can find anyone to come to the show, i'll go.  but before the show, there was drama (surprise surprise).. i feel bad.  jen and scott and trish were here. and then ana and mike and ana came, and then jeff and darin..  i wasn't sure if it would be a good idea to have scott around when jeff got here, but i thought that maybe it would finally drill through to jeff, that she is back with scott and only wants to be friends with jeff..  well me and trish went downstairs to meet jeff and darin, cause we were going to out to grab some food.. and trish told jeff that scott was upstairs in my apartment..  jeff lost it..  and said he wasn't going upstairs with scott there.. so i thought fine enough..  he's really uncomfortable so we'll all hang out and meet up with jen and scott at the concert.. so we left to go get food, but first we went to the beer store. after jeff came out of the beer store he decided that he was going back to oakville.  he's really really pissed. i mean, i understand that he's really hurt, and i feel bad..  but they weren't even dating really.  anyway, so that sucked.  so by the time jeff had decided that he was going back to suburban-hell, jen and scott had already left. so i called them, told them to come back, and we'd have a couple of drinks and head to the show.. so we met them back at my place, then brad and tony (mmm tony - he's sexy) came over and we all left.  then trish and jen and scott and brad and tony pussied out because of the rain, so me ana and mike met up with my friend tera after the show, and came back here to drink a few more beer.  ana got drunk and annoying, like she always does, tera  left, mike fell asleep, and now i'm in my room chillin' before i go to bed.. anyway, tis all.  me oh so tired..  i'm going to my ma's for the next week tomorrow, so unless we get some high-speed access going over there, i won't be writing for awhile.  dial-up effing sucks. i hope jeff is okay. peace out.

      so yesterday was my birthay (yay for me)!  i got to work, did some work, then myself, nick, katie and jen fucked off and went to grand bend..  when we left it was hot and sunny and a perfect day to go to the beach. and we're driving, and its getting kinda gray, and we're driving..  and a cold breeze kicks in.  by the time we got to the beach it was quite overcast and not so warm anymore..  i wasn't planning on going in the water, but then katie and nick had the brilliant idea to bury me in the sand (i wish i'd had a picture) so i had to go in to get all the sand off of me.  it was fah-reezing!!  so cold.  like i said earlier, the trews are playing tonight..  (yay for the trews)!! they go on at 10pm, but there is a band i wanted to see that goes on at 9.. so ana and mike and jeff and darin are coming from home to the show..  ana finished work at 3:15 and was going to leave with mike as soon as she got home, and jeff was going to pick up darin at 5:30 and come straight here. i just talked to ana, and her and mike aren't leaving until 5pm.. i'm really irritated with that. i don't know why though.. we were all going to go out for dinner, but i'm not waiting for them, cause i want to start boozin'.. so me and jen and maybe trish? are going down to barakats for some yummy chicken shawarma's.. mmm i'm taking next week off work. i need a break. nothing is working and its really frustrating.. i'm hoping that having some time off, and then starting fresh will be good for me.    so i'm going to go back to my ma's with ana and mike tomorrow morning.  anyway, tis all for now.  i must finish cleaning etc.. jen is on her way over.

      i was supposed to go meet a friend for drinks tonight, and i was laying on my couch watching the news waiting for her to call, and i fell asleep.&nbsp; this was 6ish, cause the news was on.&nbsp; then all of a sudden i woke up and it was 11pm.&nbsp; damn.&nbsp; that's a long nap.&nbsp; so as soon as i woke up i took a sleeping pill. hopefully it will work tonight. so jeff and jen talked tonight.&nbsp; from jeff's point of view, everything went well, and then i talked to jenn.&nbsp; she had a different story.&nbsp; he was pretty mad, he even asked her not to come friday.&nbsp; eff that.&nbsp; i told her to come.&nbsp; its not even like they had anything together... they hung out once by themselves.&nbsp; once. and haven't even been talking on the phone at all for the last month.&nbsp; so jen is going to come out friday for the concert anyway.&nbsp; her ex that she is sort of back together with and his (CUTE) friend tony wanted to come also, and at first i thought it wasn't going to be a good idea, and that scott shouldn't come, but i think that maybe he should now.. more for the fact that maybe jeff will get it.&nbsp; cause i think he still thinks him and jen are going to have something.&nbsp; its like he only hears what he wants to hear.. and not really what the other person is saying..&nbsp;  woohoo! is 12am! its my birthday!&nbsp; happy birthday to me! happy birthday to me!!&nbsp;

      another late night..&nbsp; 3:30am, and i'm not tired at all..&nbsp; i wish i had friends that were as much of nightowls as myself..&nbsp; i have this friend, saramaya, who enjoys the night as much as i do.. when we were in high school, i had my own phone line..&nbsp; so many nights the phone would ring at 3am, and it would be sara, up late and bored, just calling to chat, because she would know that i would also be awake and bored..&nbsp; but now we're 'adults', with adult schedules and stuff..&nbsp; so i&nbsp;imagine that she's sleeping now..&nbsp; i usually would be also.&nbsp; but, like i said earlier, the boss is away, so i can sleep in.&nbsp; last night i was up until 7am or something..&nbsp; so i slept unti noon..&nbsp; got to the lab 1ish, and stayed till 9.. so i still put in my full day.&nbsp; i wish my boss would let me work those hours regularly. i really would be more productive.&nbsp; i took a sleeping pill at 10pm, hoping that would knock me out. but alas, its now after 3, so i dont think the pill worked. strange. they always work.&nbsp; i've got my alarm set for 8, and i'm hoping i'll wake up then and go in, but most likely i'll get up, turn the alarm clock off, and go back to sleep until i wake up on my own..&nbsp;  much more drama occured tonight.&nbsp; i opened my big mouth about something that i shouldn't have.&nbsp; my friend jeff has a big ole crush on my friend jen.&nbsp; jen recently got out of a 2 year relationship, and was talking to jeff..&nbsp; she thought he was nice, etc etc, but wasn't really interested in pursuing anything since she was just freshly single.&nbsp; so awhile ago jeff asked jen to go to his sisters wedding with him, which was last saturday.. she accepted the invitation.. in the interim, she began to tak to her ex, scott, again, and they are basically back together, it just isn't 'official'..&nbsp; so jen told me that she told jeff saturday that her and scott were talking, and spending alot of time together again..&nbsp; so i asked jeff about it.. because i thought jen had told him.. apparently she didn't..&nbsp; he didn't say anything at the time, but called me back a couple of hours later pissed right off about it.&nbsp; he says that she never told him that her and scott were getting back together, and he feels like a total asshole for bringing her to the wedding and introducing her to everyone in his family.. yada yada yada..&nbsp; i'm keeping my nose out of this one.. i talked to jeff about it for awhile, but i'm not taking sides, and i'm not playing messenger..&nbsp; they are both my friends, but they can sort this out on their own.&nbsp; but they are both coming out for my birthday friday night. so this should be fun.&nbsp; drama!! drama!! drama!! on another note, i kind of really want to take next week off from work.&nbsp; i have 6 vacation days left to use, and since its a long weekend already, i would only need to use 4.&nbsp; but my project isn't going so well, and i'd really like for it to start friggin' working..&nbsp; which isn't going to happen if i'm in oakville boozin it up every night.&nbsp; decisions decisions..&nbsp; ugh. i'm the most goddamned indecisive person i know.. i was once at a tim hortons drive through, and ordered a peach juice.&nbsp; when i got to the window to get my drink, the person asked if i wanted a straw - and i almost had a nervous fucking breakdown trying to decide. it was ridiculous.&nbsp; thats how bad i am.  &nbsp;

      so its late at night.. and i can't sleep.. surprise surprise.. the reason i'm not a morning person (as previously mentioned), is because i am such a night owl..&nbsp; anyway, i was lying in bed, trying to sleep (a futile attempt, mind you), so i got out of bed and came out to the living room to watch some tv.&nbsp; but tv sucks.&nbsp; so i decided to dink around the internet..&nbsp; i googled something totally random, that i can't even remember now, and stumbled across some site,  urlLink www.enterthechapel.com  ..&nbsp; and, it has a blog.. and i like reading blogs from time to time ( urlLink www.ikeepadiary.com  being my all time fave - i live vicariously through these guys - seriously.. who has this much fun??)..&nbsp; anway, so i start reading this blog..&nbsp; because i can't find anything more interesting to do (sorry if the author reads this..) and i'm reading.. and reading..&nbsp; and it turns out, that this guy, whoever he is, is friends with a guy i know from high school..&nbsp;&nbsp;well, i didn't really know him in high school.. but we wound up going to the same (Brock) university..&nbsp; last time i talked to him he said something about maybe moving to london.. which is where i am. i wonder if he's here?&nbsp; maybe i'll look him up.&nbsp; Pat.. if you read this..&nbsp; look me up!  on another note.. i have/had this friend rob..&nbsp; he rubbed alot of people the wrong way, but was good to me, so i remained friends with him, while almost everyone else wanted nothing to do with him.. he moved to calgary in april, and came back for a visit canada day long weekend..&nbsp;during the course of the weekend, he said some things to someone that he shouldn't have, and this got back to me a couple of days after he left..&nbsp; &nbsp; while talking to mutual friends about the situation, other things he said were brought to my attention..&nbsp; he repeated things to people that i had told him in confidence, in addtion to saying some pretty&nbsp;mean things about me..&nbsp; so i got mad.. and stopped talking to him.. he'd email me, and i'd delete the emails without reading them. he'd call, and i wouldn't answer (thank god for caller id).. it probably wasn't the best way to deal with things..&nbsp; but i was so angry/hurt i didn't want to talk to him at all..&nbsp; then earlier tonight i get an email from him.. i wasn't going to open it, i was just going to delete it&nbsp;like i did with the others (i should have blocked his email!).. but for some unknown reason.. i didn't. i read it.. here it is:  From&nbsp;:&nbsp; Sent&nbsp;:&nbsp;July&nbsp;27,&nbsp;2004&nbsp;12:37:29&nbsp;AM To&nbsp;:&nbsp; Subject&nbsp;:&nbsp;Please read me  Catherine, I was going through my e-mails when I came across this one, and I thought I should express a bit of how I'm feeling. I'm very surprised that you have chosen not to speak to me any more. But that's fine, I can except that. What I can't except is the fact that you have chosen not to tell me why. However I think that I know now (or have for a little while). If what I think is the reason for your sudden decision to shut me out of your life is correct, then so be it. I don't feel that I had done anything wrong nor do I feel that this should've effected our friendship. But it has (not my choice) and I'm not going to continue to feel guilty. So I guess what I'm trying to say in this e-mail is I get it, and I need to just move on now. I wish that things were different but there not. But I will always be grateful to you for the good times I had while in Toronto. You were always a good friend to me, and also someone that I could turn to when I needed someone to talk to (which was a lot). I wish you nothing but the best in all you do in the future, and if you ever need me for anything just let me know (but I doubt you would). Rob   so the first time i read it i was sad.. because we were friends for a long time..&nbsp; and i think maybe i'm overreacting and just being a stupid girl..&nbsp; and i want to tell him why i'm mad.. yell and scream and get it off my chest..&nbsp; but i don't want him to turn it around and make me feel like the bad guy (he has a way of doing that).. so i don't know what i'm going to do..&nbsp;&nbsp; maybe email him&nbsp;and fill him in on his poor grasp of the english language - accept/except, affect/effect, and there/they are  ugh goodnight.

      so..&nbsp; here it is.&nbsp; my blog.&nbsp; there won't be anything especially exciting or thought-provoking going on here..&nbsp; just random posts and pictures..&nbsp; enjoy. or not.  so, its monday night..&nbsp; and as of now, my plan is to give my apartment a really good cleaning..&nbsp; everything is pretty clean except my room and closet.. i don't think i've hung up clothes since christmas.. i wash them, then fold them, and just leave them like that in the laundry basket.&nbsp;&nbsp; but i've got company coming friday, so i think i'll clean everything nice for them..&nbsp;  its my birthday thursday.. the big 2-5..&nbsp; not doing much of anything on my actual birthday day.. the boss is away this week, so i think a few of us may ditch work a little early and head to the beach (its suppsed to be very warm).&nbsp; but friday is what i'm most excited for.&nbsp; my friends jeff, darin, ana and mike (and maybe quentin) are coming from home, and we are going to see the trews (who, by the way, are my favorite band du jour)... and its free. which is a huge bonus, as i am a poor student.&nbsp; they don't play until 10pm, so i was planning on getting my drink on before we go down there..&nbsp; but the show is in a park, so i imagine they won't have flushing toilets..&nbsp; so i may have to rethink that one.&nbsp;  i wanted to go to my ma's saturday morning after the show, but the way things are going in the lab i think i may have to stick around here and do work..&nbsp; which is fine.&nbsp; i really want my project to start working..&nbsp; so i don't mind sacrificing a weekend at home..  its been so nice with the boss gone..&nbsp; (FYI if anyone is randomly reading this who doesn't know me - i don't know why anyone would be, but just in case - i am a graduate student.. so i work mon - fri 9-5, and call it a job, but really, i'm a student - there are 5 graduate students, 2 summer students, and a lab technician who is our bosses wife).. anyway, when the boss is around we all work mon-fri 9-5..&nbsp; but i am not at all a morning person..&nbsp; every morning my alarm goes off -and all i can think about is what excuse i can come up with to go into work late..&nbsp; so now with him and his wife gone, i've been sleeping in..&nbsp; not&nbsp;much, just instead&nbsp;of going in for 9, i go in around 10-10:30..&nbsp; &nbsp;i still get all my work done, i just stay later, but that little extra in the morning is so nice..&nbsp; they left last week, and won't be back until the middle of next week..&nbsp; and by that time, i'll have really gotten use to sleeping in..&nbsp;  anyway, tis all for now.. i downloaded some software that is supposed to let me post pics here.. so i'm going to test it.&nbsp; the picture is of my brothers kitten gizmo..&nbsp; i fully busted him drinking water out of my fish tank.. he's so cute. i am taking care of him until september, while my brother is up north working at a fishing camp for rich americans.. i don't know how i'm going to give him back to bill.. he is so cute. i love him. but more importantly, him and bart (my cat) are best friends..&nbsp; it will be hard to separate them.   >&nbsp;

      so i just posted a bunch of pictures from the last week when i was on holidays from work, and staying at my ma's. nothing too exciting.  chronologically they go from bottom to top. like the posts.  i don't really like it like that, but thats how it enters them. so blah. friday night was a good time.. the whole crew was in attendance.  we got messy drunk and stoned and played trivial pursuit. myself, hank and quentin kicked anas, jeffs, and deegs asses.  then ana started puking and took a cab home (its a $20 cab ride)..  then quentin started barfing, so we all went to bed.  now i'm back in london.  it was a girl i work withs bachelorette party. we went to a yummy restaraunt called the mangolian grill for dinner.. they have awesome martini's. i had one with smirnoff apple twist vodka, cranberry juice, and 7-up.  it was fucking yummy, so i had 2.  then we went to bingo (yeah, the bride-to-be is obviously not a party girl).. it was fun though. i love bingo.  the bride won $50 and one of her friends won $35 or something. i wasn't close to winning. at all.  but at least someone won. tis all. oh - if anyone reads this who isn't my friend, please post a comment and tell me.  i'm interested in knowing. thanks. peace out my homies.

       urlLink    hahaha.. so DPC translates into Drunken Phone Calls. and jeff is the king.  he's always getting hammered, and calling up ex-girlfriends in the middle of the night. lately, he's been calling irene. this sweet oriental girl who he stopped seeing, by avoiding her phone calls.  i'm sure she appreciates the 2am phone calls from drunk jeff asking her to come over and bring hot friends to party. we used to hide jeff's cell phone at the beginning of the night, so he couldn't make DPC's, but goddamn its funny.  &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    then, this is what i was subjected to when we got back to deeg's. me and matty were trying to have a conversation out on the balcony, and all you could hear in the background was 'slap slap slap' and moans and groans. not conducive to having any sort of intelligent conversation.  so we came in and watched porn instead.&nbsp; urlLink

      so i went out with my friend nicole tonight for a few drinks on a patio.  it was nice.  we don't get to hang out all that often, as we have totally different interests, and her and my friend ana don't get along.  niki is a space cadet.. she listens to space cadet music (ie techno etc) and goes to space cadet clubs and does space cadet drugs.  and i'm not into that at all. anyway, so ana and nicole were best friends when i met them.  then, a few years ago now, they stopped talking. and can't even be in the same building together.  so ana gets mad i think when i hang out with nicole. she called tonight while we were at the bar, so i told her i couldn't talk cause i was out, and she asked who i was with. so i told her nicole. and she got a snotty tone in her voice.  i hate that.  i know the 2 of them aren't friends, but don't get pissed at me cause i spend time with nicole. i spend WAY more time with ana.  WAY more.  anyway, me and ana are going to boston next week for a vacation, and i guess she talked to some people tonight who said boston sucked. so now she's all sketched out about going.  she better not fucking back out. we were supposed to go out west last summer, and she bailed last minute, which totally sucked, but at least i didn't lose any money.  everything that had been booked was 100% refundable.  this time, the rental car ($200) and where we are staying ($135/night american for 4 nights) have already been booked and are NON-refundable. so i'll be livid if she bails this time.  anyway, i'm gonna try and get some sleep. i have to drive my mom to the airport at 5 frickin' am.  ps-i'm going to post a picture of nicole. i think, that whenever i mention someone in this blog, i'll include a picture, so in case anyone reads this they'll have a better idea. blah blah blah more later  oh wait!! on a better note - tomorrow is an official motley crew reunion! YAY!!  should be good times.

      so me and my group of friends call ourselves the motley crew (yeah - we're pretty gay, i know).. it was a name given to us by jeff's dad.. anyway, in my crew, are myself (aka ck -pronounced seek - or ceeker), darin (deeg or blacky-d), quentin (q-tip, tipster), brendan (hank), ana (the beav) and jeff.  jeff doesn't really have a nickname. maybe jeffron. but thats about it. speaking of it, he needs a new nickname. anyway, we like to drink. alot.  so shenanigans usually ensue.  which is always a good time.  the beav was usually the person providing the best entertainment, but lately darin's been giving it his best bet.  so tonight jeff sends out an email to the crew.. here it is:   From: jeff 08/03/2004 05:45 PM  To: brendan, catherine, darin, Ana, quentin cc:                 Subject: Official Motley Crew Announcement  I would just like to say that our man D-Gay has been making some great motley crew contributions lately and it's time he is recognized.  Now in the beginning, it was all about Deeg's mom.  She is obviously a very entertaining lady and still provides all with some good times.  However, over the years Deeg has started to make his own mark in this group in a much different way.  I must say that Deeg, has really stepped up his level of play recently and deserves some recognition for his strong efforts.  At one time it was the beav that provided us with some outstanding antics on a consistent basis, but the go to person lately for antics has been D-Gay.  We are coming to the point where you have earned your own spot in the crew and we are not just using you for your mom anymore.  In the last few weeks you have provided some solid pool side entertainment, made a great decision to check out a str! angers glo! ve compartment at 3:30 in the morning, and even (when there were absolutely no antics going on at all with 5 crew members in attendance) managed to keep my faith in the crew by getting yourself tangled up in CK's phone cord in the backseat of her car.  Deeg, you've had a great last few weeks, and this is why you have earned the most improved player award for the crew.  Keep up the great work!     cheers  so fucking funny.  then darin send out one back.  even funnier.    From :  Darin Sent :  August 3, 2004 5:55:35 PM To :  jeff CC :  Ana, brendan, catherine, quentin Subject : Re: Official Motley Crew Announcement  wow, Im touched by this recognition and prestigious award, I'd like to begin by thanking a few people. First and formeost I'd like to thank God, for blessing me with these talents, I wouldnt be here without him, I'd also like to thank my agent of course, for the career advice on how to improve my antic/trouble statistics....for that Im hoping for a signicant increase in my contract, which Im sure is well deserved. I'd like to of course thank my fans, because without you guys, I wouldnt have an audience for my recent improvements in the shenanigans....you give me continuos inspiration keep it up, after all - it's all about the fans of this great game that we play.........Finally, I'd just like to close out by saying that i hope I have set the bar just a notch higher for the rest of the team, I hope my antics serve to show that we only win by being as motley as possible, so guys..........let's keep motleying it up!!!! Thank you all, God bless! !!!  this is why i love my friends.. so funny.  they provide me with hours of entertainment. i'm going to post pictures of all of us when i'm done typing this.  my mom took me out for dinner tonight when she got home from work.  then me and ana went out to the mall, did a little bit of shopping. then we picked up jeff and went out to the kings arms for a couple of cold bevy's on the patio.  was nice and relaxing.  now its 2:30am, and i can't sleep.  shocking, i know.  thats about all thats going on here. i was supposed to go downtown with my friend chloe, but i think we'll do it tomorrow instead.  i can't remember if i wrote here about emailing matty or not.  but i did. so he wrote me back (pretty funny actually - he writes emails exactly the same way my father does), anyway, he is playing hockey here thursday night, so i think we'll go grab a beer afterwards.  yay. new friends are fun. anyway, tis all.  pictures to follow!

      i just saw my first back to school commercial.  i can't believe its august already.  wow.  i heard somewhere once that it is an actual phenomenon, that time goes faster the older you get.  that for the average north american life span, in the way you perceive time, you've already lived half of your life, by the time you are 2o years old.  crazy.  we went to a bar with a patio sunday night.  it was really nice.  almost the whole crew was there. only brendan was missing.  but he's a boring married guy now.  the next time we'll all be together is when we go camping august 27th weekend.  that'll be fun fo sho.  i did my turn as dd last night. i never drive. mostly because i don't have a car, and my mom hardly ever lets me take her car. plus ana's boyfriend doesn't drink, so he drives most of the time anyway.  i emailed matty tonight. i feel like such a dork.  "wanna be my friend"..  so gay.  so i asked him to email me or call me if he wanted to hook up while i'm in town.  i haven't made a new friend in so long.  i don't know what the etiquette is.  i think he likes me (as a friend).. cause every time we've gone out together except the first time, we talk, alot.  anyway, we'll see. i just hope he doesn't get the wrong impression. i'm going out with my friend chloe tomorrow night. i know her from a long time ago. grade 7 i think we met. so more than 10 years.  so that'll be nice.  i haven't seen her in awhile.  we were going to go downtown and have a drink on a patio.  but we're both pretty fucking poor, so maybe we'll just, uh, what the heck else is there to do? lol anyway, tis all.  until next time.

      my parents took me out for my birthday dinner last night.. we went to the keg and it was oh so tasty. funny thing is, we all ordered chicken. so then my friends were going out to the phoenix.  not surprising since that is where we always go.  i wasn't going to go because i was in a foul mood, but i decided to go anyway.  it took us 1.5 hours to get into toronto, and it usually only takes about 25 minutes.  its caribana, so roads were closed and traffic sucked. so we finally get there (me ana and mike were meeting darin, jeff and matty), and they won't let me in because i was wearing thong sandals.  keep in mind its now 1am.  but, being caribana weekend, stores were open late. so we ran over to yonge st, found an open store that sold shoes, and i bought a pair of neon green sneakers.  i looked hot. they matched so very well with my white skirt and white shirt.  let me tell you.  so i was finally allowed into the bar.  after all of that. sheesh.  then, for whatever reason, i kept the lime green shoes on for the rest of the night, which was pretty stupid considering i had my white flip-flops in my purse. duh. only just as we were leaving did i realize i could change my shoes. anyway the phoenix was a good time.  jeff and darin were macking the ladies like nobodies business.  matty was super po'd because some idiot drunk girl smacked his beer bottle, spilling beer all over him, which wasn't very nice.  i was going to get a ride home with ana and mike (the boys were all staying at deeg's) but i went back to deeg's and got a ride back with jeff this morning.  the last few times i've gone out with matty i've spent the night at his place - NO HANKY-PANKY - just go back there to smoke some wacky tabacky  (although no one believes me - I SWEAR ITS THE TRUTHH!!).. and this time i brought some of my own, so i figured i'd go back there and repay the favours.. i like matty so much.. i think he's one of the coolest/nicest/smartest people i've met in a long time. i wanted to ask him for his number to hang out with him again (he's more of a friend of a friend - so i only see him when everyone goes out - but we usually spend the night talking to each other) but i didn't want him to think i was hitting on him.  maybe i'll email him. cause really, he's super cool. anyway, i'm just waiting until i pick up my mom from toronto, then i'm going to meet the gang on a patio somewhere in 'sauga..  yay for the summer!!
