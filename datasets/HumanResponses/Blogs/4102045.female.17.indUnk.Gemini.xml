       Children, are you not so happy to see me again?  Children nod entusiastically with gap-toothed smiles.  Wonderful. Let's have some fun...  I started a new exercise regime today. Yes, on a Tuesday. Sundays seem to jinx me. Now, I'm not in it to lose weight (at 5' 5'' and 110 lbs. I can't afford to). It was quite invigorating, actually. I'm hoping I stick to it. I really can't afford to get flabby. And we all know, summertime is the easiest time to do that.  I'm done with being shy. Seriously, it's gotten me now where thus far. It is a pointless emotion, only holding me back from my true potential. I mean, I'm just as pretty, talented, intelligent, witty and all-round great as the next gal (not to sound vain), but I still get all fuddled and muddled around certain people. Gosh... why didn't I decide to do this sooner? Hmm.. the possiblities are now endless. Yay!  Well, children.. ta-ta for now. Be good. Remember...  I'll be back. Mwahahahahahah- choke*cough*.  Ahem. Right. Bye.

       Goodnight, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to another one of kámmí's "episodes". If you will, look to your right and put on the specially designed 3D glasses, which will provide more vivid viewing.  **WARNING: Content not suitable for sane viewers. kámmí is not liable for any altering of mental state caused as a direct result of viewing this episode. Thank you for your understanding, and even if you don´t, tough.**  A strange man is playing guitar and crooning mellow songs on my TV.  Shudder . I really hate folk music. Nostalgia is good, but add an acoustic guitar, and a handful of soulful back-up singers swaying and swooshing... aargh. No way.  I've been thinking about becoming more cultural. I look at my life, and I say "Kamara, you really lead a sheltered life." No Russian novels on my bookcase, no operatic CDs in my collection...  (oh no, he is singing gypsy music!) , no witty intellectual friends on speed-dial whom I can call at 2 o'clock in the afternoon and discuss the fickleness of humanity, whilst munchin' on some chocalat. None of that. So I say to myself, "Kamara, you need to get some culture."  "I know that," I reply, "but what is there to do on a small, tropical island which prides itself on how many half-naked tourists sunbathe on its beaches in a year?"  "Aha!" I cry, for I realise, that there in that simple question, folks, lies the answer to my profound lack of culture. Small, tropical islands are, unfortunately, not known as cultural hotspots. No symphonies, no theatre, no (decent) museum, and a library that apparently abhors the classics (or at least makes them terribly hard to find). What's a gal to do?  First thing. High tail it out to some place where there are more people. Statistics show  (and we know I love me some math)  that the more people you have, the more different they will be. And since people dictate culture, we can logically deduce that culture will be diverse. Folks, I cannot wait for college! The opportunity to live a new life, it's almost like having a blank slate. I can almost taste it. Sure, living alone will be scary, but for the chance to get some culture and to "expand my horizons"  (how cliché) , I'll hop the next plane...  Meh. Just had a thought. Suppose there's no culture over there either? Suppose people in big cities are even more narrow minded than those on this sunny isle. Lord forbid...  My quest for culture cannot fail. It musn't.  To culture! And beyond...

       The first post. The defining factor in whether or not a journal will survive. Well, maybe not  the  defining factor, but important for sure. It's kinda like that first toe-stick into the pool. You know? If the water is too cold, there is no way a herd of drunken buffalos could run you into that pool. The temperature is all-important. Just like this first entry. It's a toe-stick thermometor/glass ball, 76.8% guaranteed to predict the life-expectancy of any fledgling blog, within a 20% margin of error. So judging from this, the toe-stick thermometer says ( wiggling toe-stick thermometer for accurate measurement )... ERROR!  This can't be good...
