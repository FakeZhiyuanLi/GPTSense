       sitting here at the laptop, drinking mtn dew and eating avacodo chips (Guacachips) - - the new love in my life, other than Paul -- whom of which i miss hanging out with dearly. 
  
 the weather sucked, but today was  so much better  than the last 2 days of school: 
 1ST BLK_ pretty boring, wrote paul a 'note' --Baby, if you're reading this I know you're  
         smiling... ha, much love. 
 2ND BLK_ more boring than 1ST, but nothing extremely awful happened, so it was okay. 
 *LUNCH_ didn't eat bc i'm broke, shared a seat w/ sarah and flea, met this kid from 4TH - so  
         now i know someone :-)  --but he never talks so it doesn't mean a thing for me (by this  
         time, i still haven't made friends in class).  Sad?  Yes. 
 3RD BLK_ a lot better than usual - we did the student interview sheets and they were actually  
         funny, and there's a girl that is so much like me it's scary... well not that much, but still. 
 4TH BLK_ while reading:  Sullo asks what "confidential" means... then Al goes on and on........       
         misses the definition by a long shot!  ....Later she decided it would be cool to do a group  
         discussion - since i don't even know 3 people in there, i was a little dazed.  Katrina asked me  
         if i wanted to be with her and Trey, so i was saved.  Turns out, they're both okay. 
  
 so there ya go - school is getting a little more bearable each day : )

       Today was pretty normal, ecxept that I had to ride the stinkin bus to school >thumbs down.  
 1ST BLOCK _Greene gave us this assignment today and we have to present them tomorrow... yay. 
 2ND BLOCK _Smith made me forget my age... she treats us like 3rd graders - pretty boring, just  
 read the whole time. 
 *LUNCH* _grilled chicken sammich... actually decent. Joked around with the girls, we laughed our  
 asses off. Walked to 3rd with Sarah, only to find someone took my seat from yesterday--bitches. 
 3RD BLOCK _Byrnes gave us notes and lame jokes.......Isn't there a Mr.   Byrnes on the Simpsons? 
 4TH BLOCK _Boredom. 
 *Had to ride the bus home, and I wished I was elsewhere every minute of the trip. I missed my Wallaby (Paul's nickname). Got home, ate cereal out of a Kool-Aid pitcher, and made S'Mores.  
 Now I have to finish my US-History research..... later
