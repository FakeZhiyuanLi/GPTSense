      Feeling a wired feeling today. Kind of sad or low, one of my mood swings I guess it is happening a bit more often than it should now days. I don’t like myself in such moods because then I become reclusive and don’t like talking to anyone. I just want to sit alone and depress myself more than I already am. Those reading (if any) may be wondering what has happened to but me in this black mood, well the answer I assure is that nothing drastic. It’s just that my stupid hormones are playing against me (not for the first time I assure you). Maybe its got to do with the fact that people close to me or people I have known for long have found them self hooked while I am waiting to bite (not literally)   More often that not I have been told by my friends that they feel the need to have someone special in there life and I used to wonder how could it be possible to miss a person you don’t even know!! But then one fine day they would walk upto me with a smile on the face and twinkle in the eye to announce, “I found him/her” and used to wonder how can they be sure that they are the one. Now I see them happy with there mates laughing, smiling and sharing moments at all spheres of life. My friends tell me that I am lucky for them because knowing me for a short while leads them to the love of their life (don’t ask me why they say it)  You know I have a confession to make as happy as I am for my friends I feel a twinge of jealousy for not what they have but because I know that the moment someone special enters life friendship takes a back seat, not intentionally but unintentionally. You cant call up 12:30 at night to just talk about your day to them because they might be busy with their mate, you cant ask them to come out for a coffee because they might be out with their love, u cant watch a much awaited movie with them because they might want to watch the movie with someone else. All of this is perfectly understandable but does hurts a bit because admittedly I am very possessive about my friends. Not a good thing I know yet something I am. I don’t know how to conclude but I just hope that when I find someone (if I ever do) I would be very conscious of the fact not to ignore people close to me because I would not want to hurt the ones I Love.

      I liked being a kid because I could be carefree and the only tension in my head was that how could I convince my brother that i was better than him, or convince my parents to get me a new doll, or how i would finish my homework in time to go out and play till late. But things are different now, at the age of 22 I am getting to know the ways of the world. Not that it is always bad to be a part of the grown up world. I admit it is fun at times but more often than not it is very complicated and tough. I did not understand it to begin with, i am not sure if I understand it now. I do not understand why certain things that seem so trivial shape up to be the discussion point for days. I do not see what harm can be done by getting wet in the rain. I do not see the logic of telling a girl not to laugh too much, I do not see the resons that tell me that I talk too much(maybe true :-)) But what I do know that these things are something I did a lot when I was a kid and nobody stopped me then, so why now?
