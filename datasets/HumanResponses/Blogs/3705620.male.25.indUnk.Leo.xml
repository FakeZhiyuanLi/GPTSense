      right then back again I am.  couple of interesting little bits and pieces to pop up on here, that I've noticed / found over the last few days.  It's KITT for sale on  urlLink Ebay   and then there's Magnum's car from Magnum P.I  urlLink for sale  as well!  Also, have you seen the 'Preparing for Emergencies' booklet the government has been sending out? well it's supposed to give handy advice on how to prepare for an emergency. They even made a website for it. Click  urlLink here  to see the real deal. However, some bright spark out there thought it would be good fun to make a spoof version, so they did, and it's ace! Click  urlLink here  to see this one, much more entertaining.  anyway I'm off to listen to This :       Modest Mouse's new album called 'Good New for people who like bad news' Coz it's a great album, sounds like Tom Waits in bits, which can never be a bad thing in my books! :)

      Ah right oh couple of bits of news. Got a new job, am now a Knowledge Base Author, which is nice. Went over to the Village Pump festival last night with my dad and my uncle tis a great night out. Here's a couple of photos to show what it's like:         and as always at places like this it's all about the beer:         Saw a great punk covers band called God Save The Queen, well worth checking out if you get the chance. They even did Smash It Up (parts 1 and 2) by the Damned :) I guess because of that I can forgive them for doing a cover of 'All The Small Things' ah well I guess you can't always get what you want. Here's a photo I took of them:         and here's a couple more but of the lead singer, as these ones came out quite well:              well that's all, until next time people.

      I'm guessing you'll be reading this a little time after I write it as I haven't launch the new site yet but I figured I probably needed a few bits here and there ready like. Well last Friday was the last night of The Pig at the old place, it certainly was emtional and I'm sure those of you who were there had a hell of time, god knows I did! :) anyway as most of you know I work for Virgin Mobile. After much deliberation it seems they've decided to launch on the stock market, and have given me some free shares! YAY! anyway thought it best to pop a link in so I can track their progress, so I can keep checking how much or how little they're worth!     urlLink Track them shares     and as a memorial to the pig I give you this:

      Hello. Sorry back of news recently but I've been busy, yes that's right me busy. Firstly been in Slough for most of the last 2 weeks doing training for me new job with these guys, try the Egain assistant on the site (Click here to get straight to it) and ask her silly questions like what's you favourite film or what's her favourite position, some of the re-actions are amusing. Well was me birthday last weekend and it seems much fun was had by all concerned. Here's a selection of the photos:                               Yes that is me up there in a feather boa, with Anna, although I dunno I think it suits PT and Dan Better! ;P
