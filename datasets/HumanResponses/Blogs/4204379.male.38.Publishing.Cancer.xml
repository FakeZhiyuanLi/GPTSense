       urlLink German Chancellor Adopts Russian Girl - NEWS - MOSNEWS.COM   How lucky the girl is.  I'd like to extend my respect and congratulations to Shroeder's family for managing to go through all the bureaucracy barriers that Russian goverment sets in front of the people who want to adopt children. Taking into consideration how many orphans there are in Russia and what frightining conditions they live in it is hard to understand why our goverment does everything to complicate the adoptation process. Right now only seriously sick children can be adopted by a foreigner with relative ease. Everyone else has to spend their childhood in run-down orphan homes, often exiting them with grave psychological problems.

      Every year  an  urlLink International Air Show   takes place on Zhukovsky aerodrom, 40km away from Moscow.  Zhukovsky was founded in 1947 as a closed military town with secret aerodrome where most of aircraft experiments and tests took place. The conspiracy was so high that the railroad station of the town was named Otdih (Rest), to pretend that it is another dacha's area in suburbs of Moscow. The funny thing is that the station is still called Otdih and even more, in description of how to get to the show the organizers don't mention station Otdih the nearest to the aerodrome. Conspiracy is still on a level.  If the weather won't spoil i highly recommend visiting the show. Although there are always crowds of people everything is very well organized and flights are breathtaking.

       urlLink Police Operation Interrupts Pirated CD Network   It is like a drop in the ocean.  Targeting individual pirates only helps their competitors, without actually causing any decrease in operation volumes.  Most of CDs and DVDs that are sold in Russia are pirated. You can find them in kiosks near every metro station in Moscow. Even in large music stores one finds shelves with pirated discs.  St.Peterburg is quite famous for very cheap pirated discs. People from Moscow go for one day trip just to buy CD's or you can order them in Internet and they will be delivered by mail.  Needless to say, that it takes most serious involvement of law enforcement bosses', to protect this industry from any substantial damage, despite its high visibility to whom it may concern.

       urlLink Russian-Israeli Mafia Boss Murdered Near Moscow  — MosNews.Com reports. This poor kid had once made headlines, becoming the first and the last Russian mobster, who was extradited from Israel on Russian authorities' request. Needless to say, it was extremely easy for Mr. Zhuravlyov to buy his way out of Russian jail: there is no such thing as juror protection in Moscow, so if any gentleman on that jury could not be bought outright, he could be easily and cheaply intimidated by thugs working for the defendant.  It proved a more difficult task, however, to obtain adequate protection from Mr. Zhuravlyov's own colleagues. Unsurprisingly for a man of his trade, he used to have too many enemies, and they proved more efficient in dealing with him, than both local police and the courts.  May we remain in peace, after the passing of this belligerent compatriot of ours.

      Roman Abramovich, of Chelsea fame,  urlLink has reportedly set his sights on an Italian resort , where Persey Bysshe Shelley used to drown back there in his young days.  Eco del Mar might be quite a distance from Chukotka, of which Abramovich is the guv, but so is the borough of Chelsea, so who cares.  What's interesting, though, is that we keep hearing about all sorts of Abramovich acquisitions lately, and some 80% of these rumours lately prove totally unfounded. It seems like there's someone behind the stories — obviously a ressourceful someone, who badly needs to infuriate both Roman's poorer compatriots and his Kremlin partners with all those headlines.   If this plot ever succeeds, Abramovich will have to chose between the paths of his two ex-partners: Mr. Berezovsky, who fled to London, and Mr. Khodorkovsky, who chose jail in his hometown. Regardless of Roman's ultimate choice (I'd bet on him fleeing, 100:1), his carefully amassed wealth, worth billions, will come up for grabs, and our Ressourceful Someone expects himself to be among the first invited to the looting festival...
