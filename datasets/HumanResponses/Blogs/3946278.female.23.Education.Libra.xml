       like marbles.   My thoughts are rolling around in my head like marbles. I wish I could make them stop, but there is a part of me that wants them to keep jostling because those thoughts are ME. It's been such a long time since I sat here [in front of the glare of the computer screen] and attempted to make sense of it all. It's hard. It's like trying to snatch just one of those marbles and stare into it trying to read what's written there. But perhaps there isn't anything there at all.   wrote a story.   I wrote a story, yeah, a story. It's about a little girl who befriends the moon and learns that the best of friends remain true to the very end. I even sent it out to [lucky] seven publishers yesterday. I hope [hope-hope-hope] that someone wants to publish it. I can die a happy woman if it does.   things to do before i die.    write [and publish] a book.  finish college.  own a bookstore.  become a literary agent, and/or editor.  move to Toronto, Canada.   Such a boring list.

       urlLink     how to make a cloth-covered book*.   You too can make a cloth-covered book such as this one that I created in the 6th grade.    what you will need:            2 pieces of cardboard that are 6 inches by 5 inches.          Fabric that is about 16 inches by 14 inches.          Typing paper          Piece of construction paper that matches your fabric.          Large needle and thread, or, a sewing machine.          Glue          Scissors          Pens, pencils, markers, or crayons.   what to do:   1. Begin by making the cover for your book. Take the two pieces of cardboard and glue them to the wrong side of the fabric leaving a small gap about ¼ inch between the two pieces of cardboard as shown below. Next, trim the fabric so that there is about one inch around the edges of the cardboard.  2. Fold over the edges of the cloth at the corners nice and neat, and glue.  3. After you have glued the corners, fold up the sides of the cloth and glue those down as well. Set aside to dry.  4. Now let’s begin making the inside pages. Decide how many pages you want in your book. For a 12 page book you will need 6 pieces of typing paper. Place the typing paper on top of the construction paper and fold in half. Sew along the crease with a large needle and thread or with a sewing machine.  5. Place the crease of the paper into the gap between the pieces of cardboard. Next, glue the very first page and the very last page of the construction paper cover to the inside of your fabric and cardboard cover. Write your story, or use your cloth-bound book as a journal and decorate with stickers. ____________ * This craft is soon to be published online at  urlLink http://www.weeonesmag.com .

       well then.   Friday the 13th has proven to be somewhat of a good luck day.     urlLink a plot is not a story  has been published online at About.com.  general mills(R) has proven good on their word.* I have in my hand [on my desk] coupons for free products such as two Old El Paso(R) , two General Mills(R) including Chex Mix(R) and other fine products, and, lastly one Pilsbury(R) Brand product.  i have found a solution to my mullet problem. My wonderful hubby is going to shell-out some money to this starving freelancer for a hair cut &amp; not only that, but he is going to watch the monkey.  won $3.00 in the Michigan Mega Millions!   Friday the 13th sure was a good day.  ____________  *Two weeks ago, I called General Mills because as I was eating a Jeno's [quite tasty] Crispy Pizza, I found a grey piece of plastic. I complained to the operator that if my daughter was eatting that pizza she could have choked to death! And, so, to make-up for the fact that my daughter  could   have  choked, they sent me free product coupons. I once got free deodorant coupons, too.

       friday the 13th.   Just noticed that today is Friday the 13th [Bwahahaha]. I was just thinking that since everything goes horrid on a normal day of the week for me that perhaps today everything will go well.  Just a thought--hell, one can wish.

       feeling crafty.   I've been feeling crafty lately. I'm starting a new freelancing endeavor--writing crafts for little people so they can be be crafty, too. I've dug into that Miss. Sarah*-preschool-part of me &amp; racked my brain for all those adorable little artsy things that I taught my students how to do.    pizza shape pie  paper plate a-z: a is for apple  babies can, too: finger paint  paper plate bible art: noah's ark  make your own [very trendy] cloth-covered book   Sent a few of them off the other day--and I'm keeping my fingers crossed.   the girl and the moon.   This little piece has been accepted by an International Teacher's Journal** [www.robbiedeanpress.com] somehow I feel like it doesn't count because my English teacher submited it.    about.com - a plot is not a story   I might [eventually] become a fiction co-guide to Anne Wayman at about.com. She is looking for someone [somewhat] creative who can help her with the fiction aspect of freelancing. She accepted one article--"a plot is not a story"-that is supposed to appear today. We shall see.   diaper rash.   Molly has her first diaper rash. So painful to look at. Poor thing. I send daddy out for Destitin this morning--hope he remembers.   things to do today.    write-up fall craft for wee ones.  send out two crafts to ?  write-up christmas craft as well, or, perhaps halloween.  work on second article for anne.  take a nap [molly kept me up all night].  figure out what the hell to do with my hair that is starting too look like a very non-trendy mullet [oh the horror!]  suduce the hubby as I am very horny.  figure out how to keep molly sleeping through the night.  invest in post office stock.   invest in post office stock.     I wonder if the USPS sells stock? If so, I think I'm going to have to invest in some. Let's see:    5 guideline SASEs x 2 stamps each = 10 stamps x .37 = $3.70.  5 manuscripts x 2 stamps each = 10 stamps x .37 = $3.70.  1 SASE x 5 above manuscripts = 5 stamps x .37 = $1.85  3.70 + 3.70 + 1.85 = $9.25   That means I spent almost ten dollars today trying to make [hopefully] $5-10 per craft. Sigh. At least that isn't as bad as how much I spend on diapers. Now  there's  a stock to buy in to.   _____________ * I used to be a Miss, until I met Chris, and now I am a Mrs. Reed. **Doesn't that sound soooo impressive?

       urlLink     monkey sandwich*   Make this sandwich for  your  little monkey:  WHAT YOU WILL NEED:  3 slices of dark bread Peanut butter Apple slice Two raisons Two banana slices  WHAT TO DO: 1. Cut two pieces of dark bread with a large round cookie cutter. Cut one slice of bread with a smaller cutter. Cut the smaller circle in half. 2. Spread peanut butter onto the bread making two sandwiches—one large circle sandwich and one small half-circle sandwich. 3. Arrange the bread on a plate as shown in the illustration. 4. Use the apple slice for a mouth, the raisons for eyes, and the slices of banana for ears. You can keep them from falling off by using a little bit of peanut butter to stick them on. Enjoy! ______________ * Most recently sent off recipe--hopefully someone will snatch this one up for publication. What child  wouldn't  eat a sandwich like this? And, no crusts!

       do nothing day.   I, Sarah, declare today an official do-nothing-day. So, I shall proceed to do nothing which includes:   diaper changing  endless hours of playing peek-a-boo & pick-up-that-fallen-toy  laundry  dishes, toliet-bowl cleaning, vacuuming, &amp; picking fuzz balls off the carpet  feedings--at least 6 which also includes the removal of puffs* from baby's hair  jotting of endless craft &amp; recipe ideas   Sigh, so much for  that  idea.  _________  * Puff (puf) n. - A piece of puffed rice cereal from Malt-o-Meal(R) or Quaker(R) that tends to get rather sticky and likes to end up in a baby's hair, diaper, and face.
