      Thank you for noticing my singing. How is your back?  Have you noticed anything else?

      No. I do not want a piece of you. I want all of you.  I want all of you     in exchange for all of me.  --L    This morning I woke up to the image of me wiping your hot face with a cool cloth, just trying to help you calm down and feel more comfortable.  Would that ever really work?  OK, OK, I know how extremely corny this all is.  So sorry.  What is the difference between love and desire?

      Today in class, we were trying to figure out whether there can be such a thing as time if there is only one moment.  We didn't get too far.  I don't really know why I am having such a difficult time working on my dissertation.  Every day, I just feel like that is the thing I want least to do.  It is so uncomfortable.  I like my topic.  I like my ideas--when someone asks about the whole thing, I actually get pretty excited.  But sitting down and  writing, and actually bringing these last twelve years of grad school to a close......I can't seem to want to do that.  I'd rather look at a wall for hours on end than look at my diss.    I have begun to wonder if it is because the topic is so personal?  Women in search of decent men, in search of marital union.  I can write about these various characters and their adventures, and their Psyche-ish paths.  But there is something so depressing about the whole thing.  These heroines never really get what they want.  And I see so much of my own sickening melo-drama reflected in the texts.  Why didn't I just go to law school?    Do I hate money?  Am I afraid of success--whatever that is supposed to mean?  Do I just want to be a student all my life?  Am I trying to avoid growing up?  Am I just living in the shadow of my mother's PhD?  Why not just make jewelry and art, etc?    Really, I have no clue.

      . . . . yeah, ok.  So,  now I am in love again. Maybe. Finally.  And part of me wants to sing.  To make a song.  Or a poem.  But it feels like there aren't anymore songs in me.  The old love songs from my early twenties still come back through my mind--and my mouth.  But nothing emerges from the moments of my present experience.

      I have been wondering if my lack of creative production over the past seven or so years is connected to the Prozac I've been taking.   Lately, I am finding myself in love--with two different men!  Having such feelings at all has been such a surprize to me.  After my husband  left me, I doubted whether I could ever feel such passionate love again.  And for twelve years, I haven't.  How odd.  To be a woman, and  to want to feel love for a man, and to simply not be capable of feeling it.  What is so different now?    The first thing that comes to mind, actually the only thing, is that I have finally begun to confront the most painful parts of my life.  I guess,  I am finally strong enough to let myself think about certain things--thirty years and more after they occurred.  I don't even know how to  talk about my life.  It was like growing up in my own private concentration camp.  That is the clearest way to put it.  There was so much  violence--of so many different types--in my family of origin.  Is there anyone who knows the whole story?  I don't think even any one of  us knows all of what happened.  There were the four of us.  My two parents, my younger sister, and myself.  Always screaming and yelling.  People beating each other up.   Getting beaten up.  Being thrown down the staircase over and over.  Thrown into walls.  Pushed through windows.  Swatted across the  face with a knife blade.  It just goes on and on.  Who did what to who, who got brought in to the hospital--none of that is probably too  important at this point.  It happened.  And all four of us continue to live as casualties, our lives over the past forty years determined by  the rhythms and shadows of our own individual cases of post-traumatic stress disorder.  In my mind, still, I seem to be somehow excluded.  Exempt from being a victim of overt physical violence.  I don't know if this is an  accurate rememberance--somehow it seems to defy common sense:  that everyone else would be trying to murder each other  throughout the years, but that I was left untouched in order to simply witness it all.  Well, not untouched.  Just unbruised.  Unbloody.  But  not untouched.  My earliest memory of these certain events is from about the age of three.  Did I accidentally walk into the room, or did he come and  search me out?  I remember the details differently at different times. . . .The one part that doesn't change is that I am standing in my  parents' bedroom by their bed.  And my father is talking to me.  He is sitting on the bed with his hands down his pants, masterbating  himself.  All the while talking to me, looking into my face, into my eyes.  And I am standing there frozen.  I can't move.  I can't speak.  I am  just completely terrified.  I don't know how many times this happened throughout my childhood.  It continued up until the time I was fourteen or fifteen, when I  finally refused to see him or visit him or talk to him again.  When I review my last twenty-five years of life-- the rapes, and the violent relationships, and the abusive marriage,etc--it all seems to  flow in a direct chain of cause and effect from these interactions between my father and myself.  I can see the direct connections.   Even to  those supposedly "good" relationships that were so co-dependent and self-destructive.  I want to get so angry about it.  But that seems  too exhausting.  Thank G-d for the blessings I have received:  the good people, my own inner resources, and--yes--the Prozac

      Well, my friend in NYC said, "hey, you should write a blog. . . . . and talk about all your wild sexual adventures!"   So, ok.  I don't know how "wild" things really are in my life, but here it is anyway.   And, no, I do not have sex with my cat, just in case you were wondering.    I am a transplant to the beautiful midwestern plains from the rocky shores of Maine.  Been here in the heartland for about 14 years now, and, well, I just might stay.  .  .  I've been in grad school almost the entire time I've been here, working slowly toward my PhD in Asian Religions.  And it is getting down to the wire.  I will be finished--one way or the other--in May, 2005.  After that, who knows what will happen?  Single, female, Jewish, middle-aged.  Teach Religion and Philosophy at my local community college. Design and make jewelry, sculpture, etc.  Kosher Vegetarian.  20 years of zazen and continuing.  Living with Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue for 10 years now.  Read biblical Hebrew, Sanskrit, Spanish, German, Hindi.    I LOVE :    Bollywood movies.  Chocolate.  Cats.  B+W Photography.  Bling.  Philosophical conversations.  Singing.  Most kinds of weather.  Making my own clothes.  Children.  Men who are decent listeners.  Collecting rocks by the ocean.  Making art.  Studying Torah.  Travelling to India.  Getting a good massage.  A life of critical self-awareness.  .  .  .  And my mother, of course!
