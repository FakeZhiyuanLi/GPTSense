       Hm... Feelin better now then the past few days, my throat still feels kinda funny and irritated though. Hm.... Tomorrow will be representing my class in the school's pyramid game. Hope I do win the game though. Lots of stress coz my teacher reali hoping that my class smart alec and me will win the game coz we are suppose to be the best in the class so far. But still I got saboh into playing the thing. But at least I have stage experience so should not be a huge problem regarding stage fright. Been seeing more audience than that so wont fighten me. Hm..., I also damn happy coz finally got a new hp after two yrs. Somemore is the hp i wanted, so well, spirit been kinda high. Well, dunno wat else to say, so shall juz end here till next time!!.

       Hm... feeling drowsy and hard to stay awake now coz of the medication i took for my flu. I juz went to see the doctor and he said at least the virus has not worsen yet so i guess I went early so gt early detection. Ah, also, did i mention that the classmate whom I am damn pissed off with is trying to patch the frenship up again?? Well, too bad, if he had knew tat this would happened he would not have pissed me off in the 1st place. Somemore is he started it first and I was trying to hold my temper for kinda a while and he still cant hear the displeasure in the way i type my replies. So I guess he went to far and triggered my nerve that has been under controlled as compared to last ime when i would juz blow. Now at least I held it back before I burst. So I guess, a person's temper has got its limit. So I shall sign out here.

       Hmm.... Sitting in front of the com again, filling in my enrty for the day. Neway, it has been a tiring day with my leg aching from filming of the confirmation mass. But nv mind, i dun mind gettin things like tat as i am doing something I am interested in. Glad that things turn out well and every shot was taken nicely. But there are some cork ups here and there coz of a last minute addition of a memeber who is slightly inexperienced. Neway, I guess also due to the&nbsp;fact tat we were working together for the 1st time.&nbsp;But it was okay, actually, i kinda appreciate the help Anthony(Koo) &amp; me got. So well, actually God answered my prayers for a good operation of the whole process. Praise The Lord. Well, gtta go and hope the cd comes well quick enough for the viewing and purchasing for the CC pple. So yah gtta go if not cannt finish!!!

      Writing a posting before my eyes close on me. Coz I am damn tired after a day in school, slogging my hearts out trying to pass my exams. Neway, today's chinese oral was smooth sailing though I burpped quite a few times bfore I took the exam. But all went well in that i manage to read the passage and answer all the questions asked by the teacher without much trouble. So I can say it is a good sign though I may not know if I passed with flying colours or not. But never mind, a pass is better then a fail. Hm.... Dunno wat else to say and so I shall hold my pen till tomorrow.!!

      Ah well, finally able to update my blog again. Juz came back frm my aunt's wake and funeral and kinda tired. So been slping for the past few hours. Had been a emotional weekend for me coz, i cried at the funeral especially when the band played "Shi Shang Zhi You Ma Ma Hao" and "What a friend we have in Jesus". Too many things has happened in 1 shot and I am wondering if I should take a break from church work for a while to reorganise myself both emotionally and to evaluate my spiritual life. Too much things has happened and I feel it is time to take a break i guess. Ah well, I also dun feel like toking much now so I guess, I will stop here.

      Todays a sat. like any ordinary sat staying at home listening to all the ballad to slack. But todays different, coz my whole family is worrying about my aunt who is in hospital now in a coma. Been praying very hard for her for the past few days. Reali hope she wakes up coz she is my fav aunt and she has been watching me grow up. So now i dun reali can't concentrate on anything. I think if she has woken up when I am in sch, at home, everywhere practically. Luckily, i have a few frens who have so willingly help my pray for my aunt when i asked them for help. Ah well, dun feel like writing any other things. So gtta go now.

      Hm...... been bugged to update my blog. Well, been kinda bz so nv actually bothered to do so. But since I am online today, I shall do some work. Today is youth exhibition and feeling very tired coz woke up at 6.10am tis morning so feeling kinda xian now. But nonetheless, it was a great day with fun filled activity and chances for me to learn new things. Hmm... but poor adrian sim was the one suffering. Youth would run whenever they see him which somehow he does not know the reason. Youths in CTK comes in so many different pattern. From running away to lost looking, you name it we have it. Some of them on seeing us like they have seen some ghost that they run in the opp direction. Hehe, and i always got Edward my beach brudder to start a conversation before I cut in and fill in the details,  so i guess that is another kind of team work. And Thanks alot Edward if you are reading this. We also found out that my shi jie aka Vanessa look like a Hamster, not that we are bad or wat but if you look carefully at her she reali got the resemblance of a hamster to a high % of 92. So from now on she will be called ham ham. Haha..... Robin and a few of the guys and me had a great time tokin cork. and as u expected, the conversation in the end leads to us toking abt gals in church. Haizzz, wat to do guys wat. Hey I think I have written enulf abt things here, time for me to go

So shld be looking forward to the celebratiopn coz it is gona be half day onli. Plus, monday holiday, si bei song ah,  Long week end. Hm.... Hope my shi mei pass her Prelim wif Flying colour, she is kinda stress nw man. So hope the Good Lord will guide and bless her in her time of Stress. Coz God does wonders in many ways. And hope she will recieved it too. Hm.... When Robin ask me regarding me being his 2 /C of Outreach, he sounded so much like a salesman. But I agreed, not bcoz of personal pride and glory. But becoz this is a chance for me to serve and glorify Him(Above). Hope that I will do a good job so as to bring more pple to him and that i wont disappoint Him. But even if I screw up, I believe he will still be there for me. So well, I'll see how it goes. So well, I stop here then!!!
