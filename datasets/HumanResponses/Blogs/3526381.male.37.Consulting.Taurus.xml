      Well I am back, and will start to update more often. I have been on effexor 75mg for a week now, and going up to 150 tomorrow. I am taking zanex also at night or when I find myself getting upset. I am actually feeling pretty good. I am not as tired, feel like i can focus better.Tonight, I went and hung out with John for a while at the softball game, I did have a good time, I did not drink or smoke, just talked, it was nice.  My truck is now paid for, and coming home tomorrrow!! it was repoed last week. with only 2 payments remaining, could they not have called me. Well dad helped me out once again, hooked me up and paid it all for me. Also helped out with the cel phone.  Kay is doing better, thank god, she was in the hospital last week, with a 106 fever, was there from 5pm to 4am, said it was a virus. We are having amy over tomorrow. Kay is off all meds now, and starting to act her self. She is such a cute kid!! I love that bean!  Amy is a 6th grader now, she graduated!! yippie!!!

      Well, I woke up pissed off, and I am even more pissed off now, Donna has not returned my phone calls, turns her cel phone off. Did not speak to me this morning, after her little pms moment. I am gonna to have to not do something I was so looking forward to. I wanted to make my girls proud of there daddy, and now I cant do it. Thanks Donna, you are the perfect wife. Thanks for being supportive during the withdrawal, you are great. Only listen to what you want to hear

       We played at Wantagh field, was very windy. In the second inning there is a grounder to me that bounces off my glove and goes towards the pitcher. I run to the base as does the runner and we collide, wow. What a hit, of course it had to be the biggest guy on there time, I went flying like a rag doll. All I do is look up and see our pitcher bob looking down to me. We got the guy out!! I then get a few singles, then with bases loaded hit a long drive out to left field, 2 runners in, but still down by 2 runs and lose the game. It was fun, I really enjoy playing. I have not played since I was a little kid. I remember being a little kid and having my parents drop me off for the games, I told them that they could leave, as I knew that I would suck anyway. I have never had someone in my family ever watch me play a sport, tonight was going to be the first time, but with the wife on the rag, I am not going to even bother. Don't want her embarrassing me at the field. Shame, I wanted to make the girls proud of me.

      Question for the world. I go out last night to play softball, have a great game, cant get to sleep at night, wake up with my wife and daughter in bedroom and wife has an attitude. What the fuck, why do women get attitudes all the time for no reason at all. It’s like it comes out of no where, it is fucked up. She is on the rag, but that is not an excuse. Said hardly anything to me, what the fuck is her problem. When she says to me that there are no paxil withdrawal problems and its all in my head, maybe I should say that when she gets her rag, it’s all in your head, you psycho. I don’t understand it, why can’t she ever let me be happy doing something. Well I am going to quit the softball team, quit going out with my friend john to play pool, and not do any more side work, maybe that will make her happy. She goes to sleep every night at the same time my 2 year old daughter does, what the fuck. What about spending time with your husband, I am bored sitting around doing nothing with no one to talk to what does she want me to do. God forbid I talk to my friend Alison, and then she thinks I am having some affair with her. I am at my wits end here, no idea what to do with her. What is a shame is today I have another softball game, and finally was going to bring the kids down to watch there daddy play a sport, something they have never seen before. But because of the wife, I will not do it now. This is fucked up, it really is I am so fuckin pissed right now all that I am going to do is be pissed all day.  I find it so fucked up that I work 37 hours a week, she might work 4 or 5, but her work is so more physical, and makes her in so much pain, give me a break, you choose that carrier not me. I would all day, and then I get home and I have to do more work that the wife has not done around the house. I am going to be pissed off for a while now.

      Well after having a great day, now getting zaps and chest pains, I find it amazing that after having a great day, this shit is killing me. I cant wait till it is no longer in my system, wish I could get a transfusion, would that help? I was having such a good day, then out of no where it could just come back like that. I got the same pain last night after screwing the wife, but figured it was the weed and everything. Is this going to be a daily thing, I cant stand it, I just want to be me!

      I love my life!!! I hate my job!! But you know what, with the way I feel right now, i dont care, as long as I am alive, thats all that matters. After having a great life prior to paxil, while on it I tried to kill myself 3 times while on paxil. Gotta love that, Now that I feel like I almost free, I am so glad that I did not succeed. Listening to Tony Braxton now, damm she got some awesome voice. At work here today, almost every application has crashed, do I care... NOT. Let it all crash!! Almost time for lunch, even though I have no money, I am just happy to get out of this fucking office. John called in sick, which is really making the day drag, but, it will be over soon enough, then softball!! oh yeah dont rain.   Do you ever wonder if you made one different choice in life, would everthing else follow and change. My change would be when i was 18, should have went away to college, instead of staying because i had the easy life.  Some things I will be discussing soon on here  My DWI My Ex Brother My Growing up My Ex  My Ex #2 Chase Friends Life choices My Mom  All things to come, one thing I have learned, writing is the best way to recovery.

      Alison, my old buddy! I met her such a long time ago, she has sorta been like a sister to me since I met her when I was 21. We have had times where we lost touch, but now we communicate via IM, which is a wonderfully invention. I worked on her computer last week, told D I was going over to work on it, as it was dead. Strange thing, she told her hubby that I was over there with D. Why, why cant 2 people of the opposite sex hang out without something sexually happening> I think that it is crazy. She thinks that if Jaime found out that she was alone with a man, he would freak. Ok maybe I can understand that, but Ali and me are great friends, and could be even closer if the other people in our life could just understand it. She is my buddy, and I will not let anyone stop that.!!

New Rules Coming 1.  You will only be allowed to use the bathroom 2 times a day for no longer then 2 minutes total per day.  2.  You must now also wear company approved underwear, with opening in the rear for taking it up the rear on a daily basis.  3.  Coffee/Tea/Smoking Breaks should only total 1.5 minutes per week.  4.  All support group staff must purchase a generator for there computer, as the support group uses to much electric.  5.

You also must remember that you, are company property, and we can tear you down as many times as the management chooses to do so. They can set rules for you that apply to no one else in the company, because they feel they have the right to do so.   Pager. From now on, when you are on call, you must stay within the company walls for your week on call. No family, no friends, you are a company pee on at this point.

      Oh boy! married 2 years! what a great day. Funny Moment, D had K by the pool, she slipped, flipped k upside down while falling, and ended up landing on her ass in the pool, if we only had the video camera going, we would have won the millon dollars. Such is life. We went out to dinner, at the outback. Our waitress comes over and says "Hello, I am your Server, I am Randy", I come back with, I am randy too, my name is Rock Hardon and this is my wife Ivana Humpalot. Almost crapped in my pants, could not stop laughing, it was a classic. We then went to get a room to celebrate the 2 years of our marriage. Holy shit, we fucked like animals, while doing so, we forgot that the jacuzzi was filling up, almost made it over the top, but I saved it!. 4 times in 3 hours, you gotta love coming off of paxil, I got it back baby!

      Oh saturday, so nice out, such a wonderfull day to be paxil free! Was out in the backyard with k and d, had a great time in the pool, k's friend and mom came over, who lives directly behind us. Damm I dont like to be mean, but the mother and kid both have been hit hard with the ugly stick. The mothers nose is the largest thing I have ever seen, it almost hurts to look at the woman, and the kid, looks like a perdue baby, with a large beek.  We had a great day, smokin jay, drinking, ahh it was wonderfull. I actually was able to go to sleep at a good time, 11pm, yippe and slept all night long! I love this day! it was great

      Today, I will start my blog and actually write in it. It will be all about me, my life and everything else I choose to write about.   In my paxil support group I wrote:  Well I have to say I have had the best weekend in a very long time.  No paxil at all and I love it. I feel like I am breaking free of the  evil inside me, the paxil which made me not be me. I have been  drinking a lot of water, beer, and smoking jay's and lovin life.  Only problem is sleep, but, I have so much more energy now, I just  clean the house late at night when the wife and kids are sleeping. I  dont understand why everyone says oh, you have to be on a drug to  help you, something non habit forming. WHY, I am happy just being  myself, screw all these drugs! What did people do 30 years ago,  prior to these drugs to control our thinking, they lived!! They make  us all feel like we need the drugs in order to keep our lives  together, when in acutallity, they just make us weeker. So I smoke a  jay a day, at least I am happy!!! I love life!

I am a very smart guy, just paxil has taken over my life. I have no disire to work, therefor, I blog. What can I say, it sucks here.

      Ok, Maybe I am the jealous type, but what the fuck. Last night Donna comes home from work and gives me a nice kiss, and she is looking oh so fine! We go upstairs and she is going to try and get Kay to sleep, which usually ends up with her sleeping in there, as it’s not worth it to wake her up sometimes, never know if Kay will wake up. She then gives me another nice kiss. Odd!! I go to sleep, and just wonder what is going on with her. So this morning I wake up, go downstairs and get yet another kiss. I ask her about work, and she says it’s going good, I then ask if there are any jerks coming in asking for more then a massage. She then tells me that a guy asked her out, he came up with the line that she does not look her age, so beautiful, and that her husband is a lucky man. He is a lawyer, living in a huge estate in a really nice area. What the fuck, now I am jealous, this guy is getting rubbed by my wife, and now he is asking her out. What the fuck? I try not to get jealous about shit like this, but this one sort hit home, especially with her looking so hot these days. I know deep down that she would never do anything, but he has what she needs, a man with no financial problems and lots of money. I am not going to worry about this, because she is just not that way, but dam, it sure is bothering me today. I knew it last night with those kisses that something was up. Should I worry, Should I be thrilled that another guy asked my wife out? What is the proper thing here!! Dam Sometimes being married is such a pain!!! Feelings wow wow wow wow Feelings!!!

      My Fellow Americans:   As you all know, the defeat of Iraq regime has been completed. Since Congress does not want to spend any more money on this war, our mission in Iraq is complete.   This morning I gave the order for a complete removal of all American forces from Iraq. This action will be complete within 30 days. It is now time to begin the reckoning.  Before me, I have two lists. One list contains the names of countries which have stood by our side during the Iraq conflict. This list is short. The United Kingdom, Spain, Bulgaria, Australia, and Poland are some of the countries listed there.  The other list contains everyone not on the first list. Most of the worlds nations are on that list. My press secretary will be distributing copies of both lists later this evening.  Let me start by saying that effective immediately, foreign aid to those nations on List 2 ceases immediately and indefinitely. The money saved during the first year alone will pretty much pay for the costs of the Iraqi war.  The American people are no longer going to pour money into third world Hell-holes and watch those government leaders grow fat on corruption.  Need help with a famine? Wrestling with an epidemic? Call France.  In the future, together with Congress, I will work to redirect this money toward solving the vexing social problems we still have at home. On that note, a word to terrorist organizations. Screw with us and we will hunt you down and eliminate you and all your friends from the face of the earth. Thirsting for a gutsy country to terrorize? Try France, or maybe China.  To Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Yo, boys. Work out a peace deal now. Just note that Camp David is closed. Maybe all of you can go to Russia for negotiations. They have some great palaces there. Big tables, too. I am ordering the immediate severing of diplomatic relations with France, Germany, and Russia. Thanks for all your help, comrades. We are retiring from NATO as well. Bon chance, mes amis. I have instructed the Mayor of New York City to begin towing the many UN diplomatic vehicles located in Manhattan with more than two unpaid parking tickets to sites where those vehicles will be stripped, shredded and crushed. I don't care about whatever treaty pertains to this. You creeps have tens of thousands of unpaid tickets. Pay those tickets tomorrow or watch your precious Benzes, Beamers, and limos be turned over to some of the finest chop shops in the world. I love New York.  A special note to our neighbors. Canada is on List 2. Since we are likely to be seeing a lot more of each other, you folks might want to try not pissing us off for a change. Mexico is also on List 2. President Fox and his entire corrupt government really need an attitude adjustment. I will have a couple extra tank and infantry divisions sitting around. Guess where I am going to put em? Yep, border security. So start doing something with your oil.   Oh, by the way, the United States is abrogating the NAFTA treaty ---starting now.  We are tired of the one-way highway.  It is time for America to focus on its own welfare and its own citizens. Some will accuse us of isolationism. I answer them by saying, "damn tootin."  Nearly a century of trying to help folks live a decent life around the world has only earned us the undying enmity of just about everyone on the planet. It is time to eliminate hunger in America. It is time to eliminate homelessness in America. It is time to eliminate World Cup Soccer from America. To the nations on List 1, a final thought. Thanks guys. We owe you and we won't forget. To the nations on List 2, a final thought. Drop dead.  God bless America. Thank you and good night.  If you can read this, thank a teacher. If you are reading it in English, thank a soldier.

      In-laws Ok, my in-laws that I have now are much better then the ex in-laws, but they still have there flaws.  Mother In-Law : She can be very very sweet, but then also a nasty bitch. She spends 95% of her time in the kitchen. What a joke, she wants us to stay here in NY, but makes it like hell living there with her. She wants to spend time with Kay, but will never do anything with her. She buys like crazy, but buys so much clothes for Kay, that we don’t have enough room for all of them. No more for a while please.  Father In-Law: Nice guy, but when in a bad mood can be mean. One day he was grouchy, Kayla took his cane, and he was like “give it back”, and then told her “what are ya deaf”, she then went to the corner and cried, I took her out of the house and took a ride. She fell asleep within 3 minutes, don’t you realize that sometimes kids are also tired, and they don’t listen. Give me a break. That was strike 1, and I kept it quiet, don’t do it again, or its strike 2.  Brother in Law: Can be nice, but he reminds me of Oscar the grouch.

Today I have the shrink which I have to go to at 12:00, oh joy 5 minutes, here is my 25 dollar co pay, what a joke.

      Dear Mom,  Well it is going to be your first mothers day in heaven and I just wanted to write you a little note. I really miss you very much and wish that you could still be here with us. We are going to be having the baby really soon, we think that it is going to be a girl, well we are 70% sure that it is. The baby’s name is going to be either Kayla Brooke Housley or Tyler Joseph Housley. Kayla is a good Irish name that I know you would have liked, and Nanie too. I wish that you could be here to see the baby when its born, it is going to be really hard with out you here. Donna and I are going to be getting married finally on Oct 12, 2002; I wish you could be there for that too. I know that you are up there looking down and I sometimes I feel like you are right next to me. You where the best mother anyone could have ever had, I mean that so much. You where always there for me and always believed in me, and that means a lot to me. I just hope that one day I am as good a parent as you where to me. Dad is great too, but we had such a special friendship, that nothing else can come close too. I still can not believe that you are not here, and I will always miss you  Love  Joe

                 Well last night was interesting. I cleaned out the car, what a pig pen, cookies, drinks everything all over the place. I then attempted to put in the booster seat; Kay is just too young for it. Donna insisted that I was doing it the wrong way, and after her using 2 seat belts to hold it down tight, about 30 minutes. We then had Kay sit in it, it was just not right, I asked Kay if she could get out of the seat and within 20 seconds she was out and all over the back seat. Chalk one up for me, I installed the other car seat and we are back to normal. Ha Ha, I was right again! We then went for a ride with Kay to see the boats, fun, but getting old, we need to find a new place to see more boats maybe. We went home and I took a bike ride around the area we live in, oh my god I am so out of shape it’s not even funny. I will continue to ride until it gets easier, I really need to do this, it will help me get some exercise, and it gets me out of the house and I get some fresh air.       I worked on the videos from the camcorder, ding bat lost a bunch of stuff because she can’t handle the rewind function on the camcorder, but we got a bunch of good video. I am going to get a fire wire cable so that future downloads come out a little clearer.       Today Donna and Kay are picking up Amy from  Levittown , should be interesting. I do not feel too wonderful right now, I still have the occasional chest pain here and there, and I am very tired. Today should be a real bore here at work again. I have to really start to think where I am going to go with my career, maybe its time for a change.               The brakes in the truck are bad, but I will wait for when we come back from vacation to get them fixed, money is low right now, plus it needs an inspection.

      Well I guess you might call it lucky, but I have no work to do today. This means that it will be a long boring day here at work.  Terrorism Well I am disgusted with the damm towel heads and them killing Americans. I am starting to wonder if the intelligence that we are getting from our government is true, or if bush is using it to better his chances at re-election. I mean they issued the warning for NYC, and he sends his wife to ring the bell at the stock market. I don’t think that is something that he would do if he really thought there was going to be an attack. Plus the info they got was 3 years old. What the hell is going on here? Why can’t they get real live info? I mean I go to web sites that have info about the war, I see some things on there before they even get on the news, why can’t the government do that.  Am I worried about another attack? Yes, I feel that it will happen again, and most likely here in NY. It scares me that we are so close to NYC. I worry that something will happen, and it will upset the kids, even make normal life here on Long Island different. The only way that we can get out of NY is to basically get through NYC, which sucks. Every time I go over the bridges, I wonder if a plane is going to crash into it, or a bomb will go off.  I remember going to PA after 9/11, you could see the smoke still coming from it, hell we could even see the smoke from where I work, and from where we lived. I just want my kids to be able to live life without the worry of will there be another attack, or whether they will be hurt by terrorists. It’s a hard thing wondering every day, if it will happen again.  9/11  To me, 9/11 was my mom’s birthday; it was one of the few birthdays that I really ever remembered. But on 9/11 that all changed. She was home in PA, back from the nursing home, she had many problems and was back and forth. That day, I called her in the morning to wish her happy birthday, then a few minutes later. It happened, the moment that changed it from mom’s birthday to a day that Americans will never forget. I called her to let her know what happened, and she was very upset and worried about my brother in law Doug, who worked in the city. I spoke to Donna and us where all in amazement about the crashing, and finally the collapse of the world trade centers. I felt at that point that it was almost over; they have now attacked the USA, the strongest country in the world. I had never wondered about us getting attacked before, but now it’s an everyday event. I hate it. I will always remember 9/11 as mom’s birthday, and the day that changed the world.

      Well I guess we had a good weekend, it seemed very very long, I guess that’s because on Saturday, I was caffeine free all day due to a nuclear stress test on Sunday. Oh my good I love my Pepsi, chocolate, a day without it killed me, went to sleep so early Saturday, then woke up for an hour or 2 during the night. We had a good day Saturday anyway! Sunday the stress test was a little tiring but I did it, and I feel good knowing that I did. Once I get the results saying that everything is ok, and it’s just from the effexor, I am planning on working out more and more to try to get my body back into shape. I got so tired on that treadmill, oh my god!  We then had a good barbeque and had a really good day.  Wonderful weekend out too, was really nice. My brakes in the truck are gone; I need to get them fixed soon. But money is tight, so it might have to handle it after we get back from vacation. Right now it looks like we are going to go to Dutch Wonderland with 4 free tickets, Sesame place while staying at a motel, our first motel trip with Kay and Amy! Should be fun, I hope. We are going to skip camping this time, maybe next year. Well I gotta get some things done here at work, so I will leave this kinda short.

      I am still up, have no idea ho w or why, but I am laying here in bed, unable to go to sleep. I just too a zanez, see how long it takes to get me to sleep. I am actually tired, but cant just go to sleep. I smoked a little too much today I think... thats not a good thing, but I thought that it would make me have an easier time to go to sleep, ahh whatever. I actually rode the bike tonight, it felt good, but, for the first time i noticed that people look at me as a fat old man. I dont like that, I want to be the in shape cool dude!
