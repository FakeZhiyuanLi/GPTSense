He has extremely tanned skin and light, shimering yellow eyes.      He wears a puffy white long-sleeved shirt, puffy yellow silk pants and yellow silk shoes. Over his torso is silver torso armor with two sholder plates on each sholder. Attatched to each sholder plate are the sides to a golden silk cloak (shiny, neh?) with the hood laying back against his... well.... back o0;;. Under the cloack are thousands of gold, white, blue and red silk pouches full of, carefully sorted, thousands of just about anything shiny.     His short brown hair is braided back into corn rows with gold and silver threads weaved in with it and randome gold and silver beads at the ends and through out at randome.

Her eyes are a bright turquoise color and they always seem to sparkle.      She wears short navy green shorts and a navy blue corset over a puffy black shirt with puffball short sleeves. and on her feet ar tall black boots that have crimson ribbons bound up criss crossing up to her knees. Her sandy hair (hehe PUN!) is long, down to her ankles, and braided low. around her neck and over her head , but not over her sholders, is a dark, forest green cloak  that catches every wind that blows by.  character number three-  Thentrise (theh-n-trie-ss) the cold -     He's tall, extremely strong, black hair, black eyes, pale blue skin, and an all black outfit comprised of puffy pants, a puffy shirt and shoes ^ ^.

When ever he get's angry the wind blows eirily past people and his eyes turn crimson and glow red. o0;;

      Argoff had lived in Kenderwood his entire life, never once even considering leaving home.      For over three thousand years he stayed there as one of the village idiots, as well as the village elder. He lived in his small house in the center of the kenderwood forest, down a sucluded path hidden to most eyes, even from the elves.      The house was one story, with no basement, three rooms, a kitchen, a dining room, and a small study. The unique thing about it was, that almost everything in the house was gold, silver or some sort of jewel or gem!     Anyway, Argoff was dubbed 'the shiny' when he was born because his bald head shined like the sun o0;;. you bet everyone got a kick out of that... infact... his granfather's still laughing to this day -_-;...     There was one fatefull day in kenderwood for this poor old kender elf. He strolled into town with his normal silken garbs on, whistling to himself all happy-like. A pale woman watched him from an ally way. Her cold blue eyes not moving when her lips curled into a grin. Her white hair went down to her sholders on the sides and down to her ankles in a ponytail in the back. she wore odd cloths for that time, navy green shorts and a black tank-top, and her boots were a black leather, going half way to her knees and tied with crimson ribbons that never seemed to actualy tie anywhere.     She fadded away into the shadows and apeared behind Argoff, wraping her arms around his neck and pulling him back. She whispered softly into his ear "I need you... you'd make a great asset to my estate, love." Argoff blinked, eyes bulging a bit and he quivered.      "um... eh heh heh... eh... could you not do that in the middle of a public street miss?"Argoff whimpered as she licked his cheek.     She grinned and nibbled on his ear "now why would I do that, pet? I like public excitement. eh heh heh." she licked him again. he pulled away from her and ran for it "GAH! I'M DOOMED! DOOM DOOM DOOM!" he ran down the streets shouting. The woman laughed "oh my shiny little friend, you can't run for long." ^ ^she began to walk slowly after him "oh come on Argoff... please? I need a new toy the old one... died." she grinned, pearly white teeth sparkling. "Argoff, my love. Come back to me." everything around them seemed to stop, nothing moved accept him and her. She kept calling his name in her seductive tone.    She finaly cornered him in his own house, backed into the corner of teh small study. She reached out and touched his cheek "why do you run from me so, dear Argoff. All I want is to play with you."       Argoff qhivered and clenched the book shelf to one side of him and the wall to the other. she leaned in to kiss him and he pulled a book out, puting it infront of his face so she kissed it instead. She blinked and groweled, "you FOOL! What do you take me as!? A cheep trickster!?  Quit hidding from me Argoff! I will have you! You will mbe mine to play with! mine alone!"      Argoff whimpered and suddenly shot out of her reach, racing to the door and shouting "DOOM!" repetitively , getting to his bedroom and diving underneither the bed. "LEAVE ME ALONE!" he called from underneith. "I DON'T WANT TO BE A PUPPET! I HATE WOOD!"     The woman glowered, groweling lowly "you will not get away from me elfling!" she snapped going after him.     Suddenly all was silent in that lonely kenderwood house. Argoff slowly peeked his head out from underneith the bed, looking around. The woman was no where to be see. He rubbed his eyes and went to sit up, hitting the back of his head against the silver suport rod on the side of the bed "OW!" he pulled himself out from under the bed and held his head "ow ow ow ow ow!" he rocked back and forth a little bit "evil ..."

						       Needless to say, where ever I end up going, I have an interesting thing to tell you. Well this time is no different than any other.     I brought my best friend Alisa along with my family and I to Mackinac Island in norhtern Michigan. We stayed at a hotel right on lake superior or huron, something like that.     Anyway, while we were up tehre, Alisa and I continued to say and think the same things as eachotehr. the one that sticks out the most to me was when we were in the car on the way to the UP (upper pinensula) to see this ship museum my Dad had been looking forward to.My mom had mentioned that we might be taking a ship ride through the locks. Alisa and I began talking about all the possibly things a ship could crash on. I said "a randome coral reife, a boat, another ship..." then alisa and I looked at eachother and at the exact same time we both randomely said "an air plane."  talk about odd.     We do this all the time ^ ^;;...     I don't realy remember all the things we did at the same time while we were there, but I'm sure I'll remember them sooner or later. I know I wrote them down but I think I threw that away in the trash before we left the hotel to head home.     OH! more things about our trip. We both were looking out the window and we saw a sign that said "waters" and pointed up an exit ramp. now, we had been driving out in the country for quite some time now, so alisa and I are all like "when you see something like that, you know you're in a rural area." becasue right after that sign was a restraunt sign that said simply "Restraunt." in big bold letters. No name, no other words, simply restraunt.     Then we were watching the trees and we began to say "oh look a tree!" just to mock the restraunt sign. Then I went on with, "Then you see the tree start walking on it's own... an ent!?" o0;; and alisa laughed and contiunued in my place "yeah, then there's this randome elf twirling a laso singing 'laso laso laso' then he lasoed the ent and pulled back saying 'woah there!' " and we went on.Alisa said: "then a randome elf latches onto our car window cill on the outside and shout something and points past us.I open the window 'what? I couldn't hear you!'and the elf shouted again 'look the other way!' and you're like 'why!?' and he goes 'because we're not supposed to GAHHHHHH!' and he falls off the window cill." then I went on from that "and he's laying in the road back there, gets hit by a car." Alisa: "and we here him shouting in the background and shaking his fists." who drives that fast!? AND ON A DIRT ROAD! I mean, come on!' all angry like and stuff." and then me: "so we l,ook at eachotehr and then we go iun reverse... suddenly the elf is in our car with a bandage on his forhead. hge sniffs 'thanks but who goes that fast, I mean realy!?" thus was the end of that story of ours ^ ^;;...     OH OH OH ! You'll never beleive what Alisa and I found in Mackinac Island!!!! PIG AND COW HAT! not only that but they moo and oink and their evil! their eyes glow red when they moo/oink! IT'S AWSOME!!!!!!!!    Well that's all I can remember for .... no wait. Alisa and I went swiming untill 12:00 at night on friday, just for the heck of it, though wee both ended up tired and out of bvreath afterwarxs ^ ^..... no wait that was on thursday not friday o0;;.... we walked mackinac island on saterday, and we weren't tired which means we couldn't have swam the day before because we would have been tired... or something..... ok here was our schedual:     Thursday- driving there, eating pizza dinner, swiming untill 5 and then after dinner untill 12     Friday- went and saw ship museum, the soo locks, and the mystery spot, baby sat alex, watched 'Gold Member'     Saturday- walked the eight miles of Mackinac island, baught cow and pig hats, watched A.I. (Artificial Inteligence)     Sunday- ate breakfast and headed home.   thus was our trip to Mackinac Island ^ ^ *bow bow* thank you and good night!

						   My dramatic death....   Suicide! (and you know it, so... dont u have something to do?)    urlLink   Choose your Dramatic Death (Now w/pics!!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      You belong beyond the claim of all humanity. Though here, you are emotionally dead to the world and nothing here has any bearing on you, good or bad. You feel nothing and are simply waiting on the end, which will come to pass without much change, after which you will fade into the nothingness which you lived. If that's how you like it, that's that. If not, change your responses to things and maybe the world will change with you.    urlLink   Where do you belong?(ANIME IMAGES)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     why doesn't that sound like me?..... unless I'm in a bad mood.... then that's me *nodd nodd*     You are most likely to be the Vampire Chevalier!   The Chevalier personifies the vampire that acts with noble intentions, despite what it is capable of. Taking a conflicting nature and resolving its issues, the chevalier both embraces and yet keeps the vampiristic nature in check; the hunt and taking of blood is enjoyed greatly, yet is restricted to those who willingly give, 'wrong-doers,' or is taken in self-defense; its powers are also embraced willingly, yet while it blatantly and proudly uses them, those that harm are only used in self-defense or in the defense of others. The vampire charm is used in full, and the chevalier appears as one of the most alluring of all vampires, often lordly in appearance as well. Because of the open embrace of its powers and seemingly royal stature, the chevalier often is an immensely powerful vampire.

						   Well, I told my parents about the whole grade thing. Luckily I'm not grounded for the entire summer, but that just means that next year my summer will be filled with SUMMER SCHOOL! *le gasp!* anyway.... Let me think, anything interesting to say to you all today.... hm...     It's hard to think and watch the whole Air Bus A380 thing on tv at the same time o0...I think it's awsome how they're making an airplane that large, to holdthat many people comfortably. They have bar, there are stairs on the airplane to go to any of the, how many floors?...... It's SO COOL!     Well, ending that rant and getting back onto topic, need to think of something randome...hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....     Eh, nothing interesting has OH! wait... Yesterday I had to work at a daycare, I thought I was supposed to work there untill maybe 10:00 at night from 5:00 pm. But since my boss's daughter only had one resital and it isn't untill next week, I only had to stay till 6:30 pm... So anyways, There was a cup that I found to be stuck in the drain. My boss was freaking out about the cup going to break her garbage desposal and then she would fire everybody.o0;;..... so we had been trying to get that thing out for hours. Finaly I came up with the idea to turn the cup over. Turns out the girl had been trying to do that the entire time. So I reached in and turned the cup over and pulled it out, not as easily as I make it sound, but I did it in less then five minutes ^ ^.  Oh happy days. So anyway, there must be OH! I took a test that said that I have an IQ of 122 which is "above average". HAHA! Go me, how come my grades don't show it!?o0;;  OH OH! here are the results from some personality tests I took at Tickle.com. (you have to be a member to get any results so far as I know, and you have to be a paying member to get the entire results unless they are small results.... but I got what I could without paying *Peace sign*) So here's what I got...  Lizzie, your personality is shaped by your Reflective nature.    You think through things on a much deeper level than most — whether they're issues particularly relevant to your life, or issues you're contemplating on a more philosophical level. You probably tend to be a private person and love being able to concentrate for long periods of time on things that are of particular interest to you.   Lizzie, you're a Skydiver!    You're open minded, extroverted, free-spirited, and independent. Chances are you're pretty liberal. You're like a magnet for love and affection. People adore you. And, thanks to that healthy dose of self-confidence, you're super-flexible.   Chances are, you're a great leader at work. You're also a self-starter and will always volunteer to take on a job. You're also an excellent communicator and tend to spread your enthusiasm to others.  And that's just scratching the surface!   Lizzie, you are Balanced-brained    That means you are able to draw on the strengths of both the right and left hemispheres of your brain, depending upon a given situation.   When you need to explain a complicated process to someone, or plan a detailed vacation, the left hemisphere of your brain, which is responsible for your ability to solve problems logically, might kick in. But if you were critiquing an art opening or coming up with an original way to file papers, the right side of your brain, which is responsible for noticing subtle details in things, might take over.   While many people have clearly dominant left- or right-brained tendencies, you are able to draw on skills from both hemispheres of your brain. This rare combination makes you a very creative and flexible thinker.   The down side to being balanced-brained is that you may sometimes feel paralyzed by indecision when the two hemispheres of your brain are competing to solve a problem in their own unique ways.  Groove is in the Heart   Whether picking up white go-go boots at a second-hand store or rounding up the troops for dinner at the chicest sushi joint, you've got psychedelic diva written all over you. People like you make it cool to be groovy again, which is why "Groove is in the Heart" is your theme song. The bubblegum-meets-techno melody of your signature song gets you to jog that extra mile, or take on extra work with a jive-y cock of your head. Deee-Lite's dancehall fave never gets old playing in your head after each successful interview and promising date. Yes indeed, this is the soundtrack to those dee-lovely days and delicious nights when you've got an audience, and your phone number keeps coming up in conversation. But you'll only share your number with that special someone who can figure out "the depth of your hula groove," dig?     I'm going to go take a few more tests on some other sites as well, I'll post all of my outcomes and their URLS as I do them. KEEP A LOOK OUT! or else ^ ^;;

						       Today was possibly the worst day of my life! Not because alot of bad things happened, but because the bad thingsthat did happen where mostly major things.     First off, this morning I went to my french teacher, Mrs.Carleton and asked her what I had gotten on my French exam. I had been studying for the past WEEKeverything that she had told us was supposed to be on the tes, and I felt as though I knew all of it, even while I was doing the test and answering the questions. Well, I come to find out, I failed it, FAIL! I studied all that time so I could get an A and I fail, which means I also failed French , the entire class which gives me no points for it, which means I only get 5 credits for this year.     That also means that I probubly won't be able to do anything this entire summer with anyone. which means no computer, no phone, no friends, no anything! Just Babysitting and summer school, if we can get summer school that is. If not, I'm screwed.     Then, I got out of school at the end of the three hours, and I went to go to the bus, but there where none there! I found out that , after an hour of waiting, the busses had already come nad gone on the other side of the school building, when they usualy come on the side I was on. And the stupid attendance office just mysteriously was too busy to announce that over the PA system, they couldn't even look out their damn windows to see if some stupid bright yello twinky was out there! They are such IDIOTS! I hate the people at that school, all but a select few are allways in a bad mood and could care less about what happens to you.     Then I get home and I called my mom and told her everything so now she's pissed at me for it. Then I called my Boss at the daycare and her and I get into a fight over wether she said i had to work today or not.     Then I try and call my friend Alisa, because (not only do I do this everyday) but I want someone to talk to, I'm tired, I'm hot, I'm sick and this was a bad day. So I called her up, and the phones ringing, then I know someone picked it up, but no one said anything, them suddenly they hung up!     I was in my room crying for a half an hour because of this stupid day! A HOLE DAMNED HALF AN HOUR!     Now that I got that bad grade, there's no way I'm ever going to be able to bring my GPA up by the end of high school, no way what so ever. Which means no colage for me, and if no collage, I'll end up living in some dumpy appartment after living with my parents untill I'm thirty, still working at that daycare for 6 dollars an hour. I'll probubly not have heating so I'll catch mnemonia (or how ever you spell it) and die.     There's my two cents of the day. NoThank you and Good Effen day!

						       Something interesting happened in one of my classes, today. It was durring 4th hour, gym. We had just finished our finals and the teacher, Mr.Reck, had left the room to go do something (I obviously haven't the slightest what). Well, when he left one of the boys thoguh it would be funny to throw some kid's hat up onto the ceiling tiles. Then he had to go up and get it, so he stood on a desk and pushed the tile up to try and find the hat again. Needless to say, the tile fell down, hitting the desk and breaking in half. So then the kid got down off the desk, everyone ws still trying to find the hat, and the entire class was arguing about wether to put the ceiling tile back up in it's place or just leave it on the floor.     Then, one of the kids got up on the desk and jumped on it to try and see if he could see the hat and get it down. Another girl got up on the desk and was about to put the tile back up on the ceiling when everyone started yelling at her not to do that. Then someone droped the bigger peice of the tile and it broke into even smaller peices.     And that wasn't even the best part! Then my teacher came back in the room and he didn't notise a single thing was wrong! XD. So the kids hid the tiles in plain site, under a counter in the classroom.     It was great XD.  Besides that, my day was rather boring and unorigional, with acception of the one little thing that happened when I got home *twitch twitch*.... I got home, and since I have a cold I'm tired and went to bed.and hour and a half later, I'm woken up by the phone ringing. It's my boss. She tells me that she'll need me to come in tomorrow and baby sit, but she doesn't know what times. Then I ask her "what time will you need me to come in today?" and she says "from 3:00 to 9:00 if it's alright with you". I said "ok, but will someone be coming to pick me up?" and she said "no because I don't want to get my workers in the habit of me always having someone there to pick them up unless there is really bad weather outside." So I said "ok, that's allright, I'll see you later" and we hung up after saying goodbye and see you later. Apparently I had been sounding tired because about five minutes of staring blankly at a wall later, she called me back just to say "never mind I found someone else to work today since it's obviously such a problem for you not to have a ride, and you don't have to work tomorrow either  so you can go to the library or what ever."      Oi, the people i put up  with.  Just to tell you a few more things about my life. I worked at the daycare yesterday from 6:30 to 8:30 pm. There where six kids, two where My boss' kids, Carter and Kennedy. There two two new kids, Noah and Makayla, and then there was the baby, sydney, and the class bully, Josoline.     So, we ended up going outside for the most part of the day and everything went fine. Then Josoline's mother came to pick her up, and I mean this woman is the bigest Donkey you'll ever meat (donkey meaning Ass not stubborn, though she is that too.) So anyways, this woman comes in and gets Josoline's stuff then suddenly she starts yelling at Josoline for not being able to find her shoes and suntan lotion which she was apparently supposed to keep in her bag. Josoline tried to tell her that the teachers are the ones who had it and they where the ones who lost the suntan lotion and she didn't know were it was. She never gave any explaination on why she couldn't find the shoes.     Since I hadn't been there the entire day, and I hardly knew where anything was, I didn't know where it was that I was supposed to look. We searched all over the house and in the front part of the back yard, but didn't find them or the suntan lotion. So this lady is all mad and getting madder by the minute. So she leaves, saying she wants Wendy to find the stuff and give it to her by tomorrow with that "or else" tone of voice." and so I say to her "I'm sorry, I haven't been here all day, I don't know where anything is." and she tells me "oh that's ok, it's not your fault, I'm not blaming you."     So anyways, she leaves and two minutes later, Wendy walks in the door saying "that lady was just yelling at me for you not being able to find her child's suntan lotion and shoes. The There is a bin full of suntan lotion where all the medicine is ontop of the fridge in the daycare. See, it's right here!" she pulled Josoline's suntan lotion right out of the bin. Then she asked me "did you check for hr shoes out behind the trampoline, and I said "I didn't see them, but I'll look." and I went out there, and low-and-behold there they where, her blue finding nemo shoes.     So we end up giving those things back to the lady. In my opinion, the child is four years old, she is old enouh to know where it is that she last had her shoes, she is old enough to know not to hit other children, and yet she still does it and her mother thinks I'm the one with problems O.O;... what ever, anywho, that's not my problem anymore ^ ^;;....  More stories to tell.... let's see here.... um....      can't think of anymore for now, but as soon as there's something new, i'll post some more, untill them, TTFN and tah tah for now. (yay tiger! A Tiger's a wonderfull thing, the wonderfull thing about tigers, is I'm the only one!)    OH OH OH! one more thing that happened, don't worry, this one is short ^ ^;;... Since I couldn't go back to sleep after talking to my boss, I desided to get all the infromation and make the flires for my babysiting around the neightbor hood. So I call my mom and we're talking and she goes "well just save... no wait... we don't have a printer... welp looks like you're out of luck."... lucky me the brighton library has printers, but that's not what I'm going to do anyways *grin* I love photocopiers ^ ^;;  And one last thing (final, last, ending statement) A few weeks back, my mom was driving to work and she calls my dad saying "Oh my gash! I can't find my cell phone, I don't know where it is or anything!" and they where both all mad and such. So my mom hung up and suddenly realised, she had dialed my dad's number, and talked to him ON HER CELL PHONE. what a wonderfull memory. *cbuh duh buh bing!*  thank you, aaaaaaand GOOD- NIGHT!

						    This dream scared me, alot. It's one of the three nightmares that still haunts me a little bit. If you do read through all of this, I comend you greatly.      I sat in the den (the upstairs part of my house where I have a tv and the computer). I was typing on the computer as I am often times seen doing.     Off the side of my eyes I saw a shadowed black hand reach over my sholder, I yelped and jumped out of my chair. I had a cross in my hand and I was shouting "In jesus's name leave me! In Jesus name leave me!" I did that so many times, begining to become discouradged since nothing was happening, I was still scared, and what ever it was was still there. Soon, though, I heard a loud screatch, the windows, computer, and the tv all exploded into the room. Then all went silent.     An angel appeared before me, I was afraid ofi t. It told me not to be afraid for it bore a gift for me to take, and it would protect me . It held out a small silver cross on a silver chain. I took it, looking at it as the angel left my presence.     For some reason, I still felt fear though. I felt as though demons were seeping into my house quickly and I couldn't figure out why.     I looked down and the cross which now hung around my neck was upside down! I turned it over but the T on it fell down to make it upside down again, I kept turning it over and over, trying to make it stay right side up long enough for me to tell the demons again "in Jesus name leave me!" but it wasn't working.     I finaly grabed it, holding the T the way it was supposed to be. I said it, the demons left and I threw the wreched necklace out of my window. I imidiatly regreted it though. I knew someone else would pick it up and they too would have the curse I had bore.     I ran outside to get it, but someone else picked it up. It was too late. The circle was going to start all over again.     I don't really remember what happened then.... but i do remember going ot my bedroom and saying "InJesus name leave me" once more and suddenly fealing peace before I woke up.    This made me beleive, there realy are demons in my house, and they really are out to get me. It does say in the bible that the closer you are to God, the more they hate it and will try to pull you away. But, Jesus is greater then all the demons of the earth and Satan. There is nothing that can harm you if you stay on the path of righteousness. Nothing.
