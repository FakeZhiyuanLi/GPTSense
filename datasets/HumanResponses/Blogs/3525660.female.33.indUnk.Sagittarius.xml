      I don't know what it is but even when I have absolutely no reason to stay up late, I will not go to bed. I love sleep; I love my bed; I love sleeping lots in my bed. Why is it that I goof off and smoke cigarettes until the wee hours? I'd be asleep by now if it was a weeknight, but tomorrow is Saturday so I'm supposed to stay up, right? And since I've been hitting it at 1am most nights, 3am should be a good extension to take advantage of the sleeping late. That's the thing...I'll sleep late, but considering what time I'll actually go to sleep I'm not really getting any more sleep.   Any night owls out there? No sleep 'til.. . . . ... . . . .. . . . Brooklyn.  This will be a good weekend, partly because I made few plans with other people. It's not that I don't want to play, but since moving I have done little but hang out with friends, and mostly out of my house. I still haven't finished unpacking! Ok, part of the reason there is that I'm kinda lazy, and part is because I still need to pick up some shelves so I have places to put my stuff, but the rest is that I'm hardly here! So I saw the weekend coming and I didn't puruse making many plans with anyone. My best friends are busy with their boyfriends this weekend anyway, which probably wouldn't have helped had I been looking for plans. I accepted an invitation to see Shakespeare in the Park on Saturday night and it's entirely possible that we'll end up scoping cute girls at one of the few dyke bars in town. (Did I say "few" bars? I meant "a couple of" bars. Let's not pretend that there are many choices.) Did I tell you that I love girls? Yeah. I most certainly do.  I also love the influence of the girls in my life. I was always kinda butch (or the common "soft butch" stereotype), but then the girls in my life were all girlie (sigh) and they started working on finding my more feminine side. One result? Going to get another pedicure this weekend...it is addictive isn't it? Soaking your feet in the hot, bubbling, salted water, the foot and leg rub, the utter feeling of clean...these are good reasons to go and pay someone $20. Since most of the pedicurists (is that a word?) are Vietnamese, they chatter on while they are working on us and god only knows what they're saying about our feet. But then, who cares? I can't understand them anyway, and it feels great, so what the hell?  Speaking of feet but having nothing at all to do with them, Sunday night is Six Feet Under. It's my favorite Sunday night ritual and, judging from the new episode last week, I expect a good season ahead.  Awww...my little Perry is curled up next to me and she just did the "cute cat rolls onto her side and turns her head upside down with her paws up by her ears" move. If you're a cat person you are familiar with the move and all you can do is rub the belly as it's presented to you. I'll go do that now.  And then maybe I'll go to bed.  Nah.   This is also a My Space blog entry...I should figure out a way to just combine them all into one damn blog.  I can't keep up!

      This is a good Monday coming off of a great weekend.  I got some very good news at work this morning, with a nice financial impact for January, which I cannot share at this time but it certainly did add a spring to my step!    Plus, I've got a date tonight.  This is a good thing because my last couple have not worked out.  I did get a good friend out of one so far, which is always welcome, but I always seem to delay meeting someone while working around schedules and then they start dating someone else.  Ok, this has happened twice but out of the last 3 girls I met online that's a hefty percentage.  What happened to the 3rd girl, you might ask?  Don't bother.  It is a good story for another blog another day, though.  Anyway, I'm excited about tonight because this seems like a really great girl and we hit it off instantly. We'll see how the night goes but I'm optimistic that I'll like this one, and that perhaps she'll like me.  The weekend was really great for me, in so many ways.  I guess the biggest deal was that I actually got to spend some time with Hafiz.  Yeah, I'd read everyone's raves about him and listened to the same from friends, but when it comes to the guy dating your ex, they are just never good enough.  Well, I must admit that he seems like a great guy, and that makes me happy because Di deserves the very best that this world has to offer.    Saturday night was the party at Blythe's and it was a really nice time!  Granted, we drank the entire bottle of Clementine vodka that I brought, and then some, but what's a good party without some intoxication?  And I got to meet some great new people!  I LOVE RYAN!!  If you're reading this, Ryan, know that we all enjoyed meeting you and are looking forward to your next visit to STL!  I'd promise to come visit but even you said there was little in Springfield besides you, so we'll make you travel:)    From there we went out, and when I say "we" I mean me and my girls.  It's been a long time since Di, Janelle and I went out and it felt really good.  None of the old drama was there and everyone was really happy to be together. And we danced and danced, even though Joe fucked me over with his PYT remix, NEVER giving me the release I needed. (I know it's old-school cheesy but you know it's a good time!) Is that what blue balls feel like? Bryant is a love and I am always so pleased to see him, and drink his tasty shots.    Sunday morning came way too soon and I was awakened by a phone call from a friend at, get this, 9 fucking am!!  I was so sleepy that I wasn't even mad, until I couldn't fall back asleep!  However, I bailed on her for the sweaty bikram yoga we'd planned for that afternoon, so I figured she owed me one...and so that was it.  We're even.  I did manage to get up and make it to brunch at Duff's.  My life is forever changed by the turkey-apple sausage.  If you're not a veggie, try this...it's fresh and not greasy and perfect.  I also enjoyed the stroll through the Taste of CWE, as our group enjoyed the horrible blend of 80s art on display, but when we got to the food part I was done.  Di and I had planned to spend the day together, shop a little, and see a cheesy disaster movie, so I was ready to get on with the day as everything closes early on Sundays so you can't delay when you've got things to do.  The shopping was productive, even if we did go to So Co Mall only to return to the Galleria, but on a beautiful day with a sunroof, good tunes, and your best friend, who cares where you have to go or how long it takes to get there!  The movie was cheesy and just as expected...no, it certainly wasn't a great movie but it did manage to get me on the edge of my seat more than once.  And Jake Gyllenhaal...yeah, I'm definitely 70/30%.  So you see?  It was a great weekend.  I feel my life shifting for the better...I've started eating better and, by cutting out diet soda, the weight is starting to fly off (and isn't that ironic that to lose weight you have to not drink diet soda?), I'm making new friends, I'm painting again, my home is great, my cat is cute as hell, and my best friend is happy. I've been hanging on to so much from the past, regretting the mistakes I've made, and it's nice to finally really move on and not live in the past anymore.  I'm just not used to not having a girlfriend, although I realize that I haven't had one in over a year, or the longest period of my life since I began dating!  It's been good for me in so many ways but I'm getting eager to have someone to love on, and to love on me, you know?

      Do I even have anything worthy to say?  I really should be working but these days I am easily and constantly distracted.  I read the blogs of my friends and their friends and everyone tells tales of their daily lives...and is that what people are looking for?  Is that what drives people to use these things?  I could tell you the frustration I went through today trying to find the Crazy Bowls and Wraps that apparently used to be in Clayton, only to go to my regular location, and the one I should have saved 20 minutes of hunting to get to.  It was nice to bring the bowl back and sit out at the picnic table by the lake (don't get too excited because the lake sits alongside I-170 at Page - perhaps you've seen it) with some friends from work.  It's so damn beautiful out these days and I feel like I should be OUTSIDE ALL OF THE TIME while this weather is so cooperative.  In a few short weeks, or hell, in STL it could be days, the heat will descend upon us and the idea of picnicing outside, while still nice, will conjur up images of dripping sweat onto your salad.  Appetizing, yes?  What is Manley making us listen to?  Right now it's bad world music.  I like world music, but apparently not whatever he's playing now.  I feel like I'm at a really bad Floridian resort.  However, Manley earns big points...today he introduced me to  urlLink Nick Drake  and I think I fell in love.  I knew one song from a Volkswagen commercial (forgive me if you're an avid fan - I'm a late bloomer)and so I recognized it when he played it, but then he went on to play the disc and I was floored.  I'm eagerly looking for new music and this qualifies...even if he died in 1974.  Apparently this guy has influenced many artists (Elton John came up in the conversation) and I can't say that I've ever heard of him.  I will, however, seek out more to enjoy at home.  On the flip-side, I turned Manley onto urlLink  Jeff Buckley .  I snagged a couple of songs from the web (yeah, yeah, say what you want about downloading but i've purchased plenty of Jeff Buckley stuff, including CDs and DVDs, and some of the CDs multiple times) and now all I want to do is go home and paint.  Painting with Jeff is one of my favorite things to do.  I can paint with so many different kinds of music but when I put any of his albums, especially  urlLink  Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk  , I just go to a different place and I never want to come back.    I was looking for something to do tonight and I just might have found it, however a stop at the art supply store is desperately needed.  I'm sad that  urlLink the Art Store , which is not in the STL area but is in Chicago, has stopped selling products online.  And they had excellent prices, too, even with the shipping!  You should have seen me squeezing out the last of some of these tubes at 1am. I was about to cut them open and scrape them clean, but fortunately I was able to work with what I had. I had a teacher once tell me to always put all of my colors out, and plenty of them.  I thought this was wasteful (and granted, I still only put out the colors I think I'll use plus a few extras, but not the whole rainbow) but there are moments when you just don't have the time to stop and dig for a color...you need to keep moving, keep it going, and every time you stop you could move further away from the goal.  I sometimes smoke when I paint but even this becomes a nuisance.  My cat loves when I paint and after she's finished attacking the back of the canvas (always as I'm painting because it's like a game) she curls up around the bottom of the easel and watches.  Last night I wasn't paying attention until she discovered the blob of blue paint on the palette...she wasn't happy with me as I had to wash her little paw but hey, if I have to stay off the pretty couch when I paint, so does she.  I got paint on my wall as I was working.  I stopped and thought, "Shit, if I wipe it the color will just spread."  Then I realized, "It's my wall and if I want the paint splatters on there, well dammit I can have them."  What a nice feeling.

      As usual, I'm up late when I should get some sleep.  I promised that this weekend I'd catch up on my sleep.  We'll see how that goes.  I've been telling a little tale about another bad date and Di suggested I share with a blog about it.  If you've ever had difficulties dating (damn, haven't we all?) then you can relate...  I get an "I'm interested" message from one of many ads, so many that I'm starting to feel as if I'm whoring myself to the world, but that's a different story.  We email and she seems alright...a musician, an artist, massaging to pay the bills.  These are 3 talents I can stand to be around, so I quickly advance to the phone call.  I'm never sure how or when to go from chatting via email to talking or meeting but I'm learning not to dick around and spend a lot of time when it might amount to nothing, not even a new friend.  The phone call goes very well, if you consider talking for over 2 hours good.  Hell, I think I get so nervous talking to someone new that I probably babbled on for about 75% of that time.  Regardless, there were moments when I got the weird vibe from someone I won't connect with...it's not that anything is wrong with them but, it just won't work for me, whatever it is...but then she'd say something that would have me cracking up.  Or was that just me being hopeful?  We decide to meet and she agrees to a drink.  I call that afternoon to cement the details and, since she does not have a car, I offer to pick her up or else meet her somewhere at her convenience.  I wouldn't be offended if she didn't want to jump into my car on our first face-to-face encounter so I'm trying to be flexible.  She asks what kind of car I have.  Now, I'm thinking that she just wants to know so that she can be on the lookout for me.  Then she asks if I have leather interior, which I do not.  She's a vegetarian for the ethical reasons and had earlier mentioned that she has a hard time being around carnivores but that she was getting over that.  Still, the question about my interior puzzles me.  I ask if she would be so opposed to leather that she might not sit in my car?  Pretty much, although she's trying to get over that.  Doesn't matter because I have cloth seats and I thought, hell, at least she'd declaring what she does and does not like.  Got to respect that, right?  Still, kinda odd and making me rethink my haste.  She's not sure she's feeling like a drink, she says, so she invites me to go for a walk.  Now, a walk almost always sounds nice but being the activity for a first encounter?  Another "kinda odd."  I arrive and she seems nice enough, but already not my type.  Pictures are worth a thousand words, and her picture made me at least think the word "cute" at some point.  She wasn't unattractive, just not my type. 38 and starting to really wear her age. Whatever...friends are always cool.  We walk her dog for a few blocks but it had rained and was m-u-g-g-y so we headed back.  I was ready to hop into my car and jet but, she awkwardly invited me in for a beer.  It was too early for me to meet my friends as I'd planned for later in the evening but there wasn't enough time to go do anything so why not have a beer and continue talking.    Upon entering her home I was asked to remove my shoes (leather, by the way), although why I couldn't quite figure out because it was just shitty apartment wood flooring.  These floors were nothing great, and if the were original (doubtful) they weren't in the best of shape anyway.  The living room consisted of 2 folding chairs, a fan, a make-shift work table that looked to me as if it was a huge plank of ply-wood atop 2 cardboard boxes on the floor.  Signs of creating artwork lay on the table and her guitar is in the corner, so this is good.     Artsy types can be strange, although I'm the artsy kind who enjoys furniture. There seem to only be 2 paintings, and one she had emailed me and said was old, and the other had a pretty thick layer of dust and dog hair, so I imagine that it was not a recent work.  So why the work table with the mess from making those paintings?  I sit in a folding chair while she turns on the a/c and fetches a couple of beers.  We talk and drink...and it's not a bad time, just nothing thrilling.    Not much more happens...we talk about her brother who's in jail for crack and lying roommates and how a recent one *gasp* cooked a pepperoni pizza in the vegatarian kitchen.  Ok, it's not like the guy slathered pepperoni all over the walls, nor was he grilling them directly on the range, and unless he burned it I can't imagine that there was much of a residual odor.  It's a pizza for christ's sake.  I've dated and known several veggies and I've never met one like this.    Then I made her laugh.  Yeah, she was missing a fucking tooth.  It was toward the back on the side (top)...or should I say it wasn't there?  Whatever.  Toothless is unacceptable.  Beyond "kinda odd."  I politely finish my beer and take my leave, neglecting to invite her to come with me, nor do I suggest another meeting.  I guess it'd be right to at least email and say that we probably won't get along well.  But I think she already knows that.  Kinda odd.

      The thought of drinking black coffee always seemed appealing, yet still intimidated me to a degree so high that it was starting to border on being a paralyzing fear.  Sounds silly, I know.  Don't worry; I have my reasons...petty as they may be.  While it sounds foolish and outdated, it worried me a little that predominantly men drink their coffee black and maybe it would make me look less feminine if I did the same.  Also, I rarely - if ever - pass on sugar and/or dairy if ever given the option.  However, the main reason is that - while I love it so - coffee is so damn bitter that it seems it  needs  to be diluted with  something  to make it palatable.  Yet the pangs of my punk-rock conscience plagued me.  You see, most people have the angel/demon on their shoulders.  Not me, that bullshit of heaven and hell never concerned me.  Oh no, I have two other characters that appear on my shoulders.  First there’s the popular, mainstream friendly girl on my left, and second the anti-establishment, pissed off punk bitch to my right.  These two are the extreme ends of the spectrum that my personality reaches – and the punker nearly  always  wins.    Except on the issue of coffee.  Every time I upended the jug of milk or sugar dispenser, a spikey-haired, steel-toed boot wearin’ little punk bitch appears on my right shoulder, whispering to me,    “If you like coffee so damned much, why do you have to dress it up until it’s unrecognizable as itself?”   I’d shrug her off, without even bothering to summon the popular girl, knowing exactly what she’d say and that I agree with her entirely,    “Because it’s yummy and sweet, sillyhead!”   Over the years, and as time progressed and I gained a fuckload of weight from all the pounds of sugar and gallons of half and half – among many other variables and foodstuffs of course – being dumped into my mug each morning.  So I started scaling back.  Instead of the sugar, I’d use sweetner…instead of half and half, I’d go for the skim.  Boy that little punk bitch started screaming riot-rants into my right ear so loudly that my hearing in that hear has to be worse than  any  scenester’s who survived the 70’s Manchester scene.   “ Splenda ,  WHAT THE FUCK?!   Are you fucking  kidding  me?”   The little pop girl within soothed me, assuring me that I was doing the right thing for my health, my body, all while still having  relatively  the same experience as before.  About a year of the berating/reassuring – not to mention losing a lot of weight – I would start splurging here and there, using half and half or whole milk and real sugar to season my coffee.  If you’ve ever done it, you know how good it is…so nice to relive the indulgence, if only momentarily, so that you remember what you loved about it so much in the first place.  But that naggy little bitch still wouldn’t shut the  fuck  up about the black coffee.     “Fuck, you’re such a fucking sissy.  I can’t believe you won’t even  try  it.  This from the same dumbass who drinks sugarless tea!”   I had to admit, she had a point there.  I could see - before even summoning her - that this was one argument the pop girl wasn’t going to win.  It was funny, I never thought of it that way.  My eyes were open anew, and the flooding light of enlightenment poured in.  I  do  love my Mississippi sweet tea just as much as I do my unsweetened iced goodness.  It was final, there were no excuses to be made any longer.    The next day, as I poured my coffee, I filled my cup to the brim, not even leaving the temptation open for milk addage.  I must admit, it was a bit like cliff diving for the first time; the whole “horrible fear that there’s a possibility that you may not be happy with the outcome of your actions” thing.    …I put the cup to my lips…  …took a deep breath…  …and let the hot, black fluid roll over my tongue.  And you know what?    It was pretty damn good.

      Not literally, of course, otherwise you'd have seen me on TV this morning being awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor by Senor Dubya himself.   No, it happened in my dream last night.   Which I find strange, as I don't necessarily  hate  Osama Bin Laden so much that I'd want to kill him personally, especially using only bare hands and a garden hose. While I think it'd be a good thing if  all   members/leaders of extremists groups (ie: the Far Right, the Far Left, Feminazis, Fundamentalist Christians, Al Qaeda, Vegans, PETA, etc) would  chill the fuck out , I certainly don't wish death upon them.   I think it's kind of a bad thing to wish death upon anyone; however, I get exhausted and infuriated with preachy assholes who can't just let the world be - personal belief differences and all. And yet, I don't feel peace is the answer, nor even a remote possibility. There is no cure-all answer, as human beings have been and will continue to be a greedy, self-serving, win-at-all-costs species until every last one of 'em is killed at their own grubby little hands.  I look at the sky at dusk and see a beautiful sunset, only to be instantly reminded that the colors I marvel at are there due to man's pollution of the air. I step outside and feel the warm sun on my skin, only to remember that the excessive burning of fossil fuels is causing the temperature to rise at exponential rates every year. We already have to wear sunblock if we're going to have prolonged exposure to the sun...eventually we won't be able to go outside at all without something resembling a space suit if we keep up at this rate.  Does all this make me a pessimist? Maybe. It certainly makes me aware. We're always told that what you do with that awareness is the key. However, so many people are either:    A)  blissfully ignorant of the facts (approx. 90% of the population),   B)  are aware, yet ignore reality entirely (approx. 9%),   C)  are aware and struggle every day to make a difference (approx. 0.3%), or   D)  are aware, yet are exhausted by reality and do the best they can with what they have (approx. 0.7%).  I think I can safely say that I fall under the fourth category. It doesn't matter how much I take public transit or walk instead driving of my car, vote, eat only organically grown food, recycle, or conserve energy - one educated person's actions really do not make that big of a difference when the gross majority of the world is a mindless mass of wastefulness.     Note: This is actually a post from my  urlLink MySpace  blog. Check out their site if you haven't yet, and feel free to join MySpace and send me an invite if you want friends!

      It ends with the short "i" sound in the English language, which is pronounced "ee".&nbsp; Here it is, straight from the Merriam-Webster Online:    Mis·sou·ri - pronunciation: m&-'zur-E,  by some residents&nbsp; &nbsp;- m&-'zur-&amp;    The symbols reprensenting the sounds?    &  as  a  and  u  in  a b u t   E  as  ea  in  ea sy   I can't believe this is an issue, or more importantly an actual story in the  major newspaper  in the Metropolitan area.&nbsp; The  urlLink St. Louis Post Dispatch  is&nbsp;reduced to correcting others' grammar for stories.&nbsp; Funny, you'd think they could start by bulking up their sorry excuse for a copy editing staff.   But I digress...it's just a fucking ridiculous thing to debate.&nbsp; The point is: how can you confuse the pronunciation of the letter "i" with an "uh" sound?&nbsp; I mean, the dictionary should have just&nbsp;annotated it&nbsp;"by the local hilljacks" instead of "by some residents".   Madness.

      A news story broke this weekend about the ongoing of our fair president's plans to manipulate our government further. Please take the time to read this story from  urlLink CNN  today.  My question is how is delaying the election  NOT  affecting the election?!    HELLO!!!    It seems to me that a pre-emptive action such as  delaying  an election from the appointed date due to an alleged "terrorist threat" (similar to the alleged ones that  didn't  happen on Christmas and the 4th) is doing  exactly that . Who even knows if there were said threats on Christmas & the 4th?  It would seem to me that a matter of national security on our day of independance would be more in need of postponement, I mean, due to the mass gatherings of people that there were in commemoration of democracy's 228th year.  I don't even know why I waste my breath.  It's all so suspect, and no one even seems to be paying attention.  What's worse, is the ones who  are  paying attention get laughed off as "paranoid."  The truth is, if there ever was a seriously imminent terrorist threat, it's not like the general public will ever be privy anyway...that's the beauty of this administration.  We know what they want us to know.  That's not paranoia speaking, that's   fact  , brother.  We're all so easily led under a shroud of mystery and fear - and we have no choice but to eat the shit constantly shoveled down our throats.  With the republicans owning both houses & the presidency, and the minority leader in the Senate being such a puny little coward (yeah, I'm talking about you, Daschle, you fucking idiot)...it certainly seems that Bush can (and will) have his way no matter what.   Which begs the question: is this country REALLY ruled by democracy? After all, a dictatorship would be a whole lot easier, heh, Bush?   GOD, I just wish this fucking country would WAKE UP and SMELL THE BULLSHIT!!!

      I expected better of my fellow residents.  Just when I thought this place was okay, something like  urlLink this  happens.  I know it was naive to think that a gay marriage ban  wouldn't  pass in the state of Missouri...I just felt so strongly that there was  no way  the straight residents of Missouri (a majority by far) could be that harsh to their fellow men &amp; women solely based on the fact that they are different.  I thought the world had evolved enough with all the strides made in the name of  urlLink civil rights  over the past century that something like this amendment would be recognized as disgusting act of bigotry.  Well, I was wrong...I'm too disappointed to be angry right now, so I'll write more when I am.
