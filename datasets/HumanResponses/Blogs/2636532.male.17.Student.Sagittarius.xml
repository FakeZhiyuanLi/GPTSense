       Fire Buggin'   For no reason at all I figured that I should tell all of you about my various exploits involving fire. I don't why i thought of this, but i guess when you're lying in bed at 2 in the morning half asleep after watching a movie that had a horrible plot and even worse acting (Rat Race, actually i shouldn't say all that, personally i loved Rat Race) but still managed to make you laugh, you think of strange things.   Namely the first incident that comes to mind is one where i was younger, i was having a grand old time lighting matches in our back yard, seeing how close i could get the flame to my finger until i had to let go. Well the first time trying that I realised that fire is EXTREMELY hot, I promptly burnt my finger and threw the match to the ground, coincidentally it landed in a large clump of dead dry grass. It lit on fire and I was running around like an idiot tryng to put it out. While stumbling around like a buffoon in my search for any liquid to put out the flame, I came across a large bottle of cooking oil. Needless to say, cooking oil does not, in any way, shape or form, put out fire. The fire became bigger and eventually I put it out with our good friend water and covered the burnt patch with more dead grass(a little ironic??).    Another Incident that comes to mind is one that thankfully does not involve me. Some of my friends were out camping and they got it into their heads that throwing lit matches at each other would be fun, usually it is but not when there's dry grass under your feet. Soon enough there was a rather large grass fire on hand. This fire spread to underneath an old dilapitated truck that had attracted a colony of bees. Not being there I had to laugh, I imagined all of them running around trying to put out the fire while avoiding the very angry and upset bees.    I'm not even going to mention the game called Fire Ball, except that it involves a sock, a pop can, and some lighter fluid, other then that, due to certain....uh....legal reasons, I will say no more.    These are some of my more memorable fire experiences, and the moral of this blog is...don't play with fire...what the hell kind of moral is that???  Not playing with fire should be the most obvious thing ever, really, you should listen to your parents more.  What kind of stupid, low-life, idiotic human being would do such an irresponsable thing?........Oh wait....heh, nevermind. -Matt

       Summer School Gym Class: The Aftermath   As none of you know(well most of none of you) I have recently been attending Summer school gym class. I guess it wasn't all that bad, if you don't mind waking up at 6 in the freaking morning and having to walk there for half a freaking hour just to get there earlier then everyone else and you can't leave later because if you fall asleep you won't get up in time to get there. But anyways, i guess it wasn't all bad, we did get to play frisbee. Nothing's better then chasing a floating plastic disc around a field....hmmmmm....seems strangely like what a dog would like to do....er.....anyways! But in defence of hating that class, i'd just like to point out that we did have to do a project, in which we were forced to stand infront of the whole class of 57 people and make them do a warm-up. Needless to say my group failed horribly and just because I felt like being a prick I made the winning team run laps thus forcing them to hate me. But the one thing I hated the most was during our schedualed floor hockey game time i was visiously attacked by a 230lb, 6 foot 1 inch (maybe i'm exaggerating a little) behemoth whose brain consists of little more then a pile of brown goo.  He some got it into his thick skull that crosschecking me and hooking me with his hockey stick was fun.  And this put me into a situation i like to call a Matt Paradox(named after me of course). Basically, I had a "can't rat, can't spaz" crisis, i couldn't rat on him without looking like an overgrown wussie and without gargantuan over there pounding me flat while saying "Me stupid! Must squish everyone!", and i can't spaz because of the reason above and not to metion that fighting will cause a quick expulsion from the class and a waste of the 50$ spent to get in. So what do I do? I bitch on the net. Hoohah! But now I'm done. Peace Out -Matt

       My First Blog!!    Hmmmmmm, wow my very first blog! I feel so proud. It's just like riding a bike for the very first time...well replace the bike with my computer...and the road/parking lot/driveway with the World Wide Web. But all in all it's generally the same feeling, well that is until you inevitably fall off your bike and crash into a tree thus terrifying you of ever riding a bike or any other form of transportation that involves wheels...ah screw bikes, I never did like them anyways, to much of a pain in the ass. But anyways I'll try to put blogs up as much as i can depending on my time and how much i feel like bitching. Peace Out! -Matt

        People suck.    There’s no other way to say it! You can fancy it up any way you like but it all ends up being a snotty more polite version of that statement. Do you know who really bug me? High school friends. When you’re in high school you have to endure 5 years of being thier friends. The only ways out are death and switching schools. Sometimes neither is an option. Sure most say they are your friends, but beneath that smile and sympathetic tone lies a bunch of lies!  I really should be more specific then I am being at the moment. Females suck. Yes the one gender as a whole. That’s why I chose a long time ago to have only male friends and confide in males and only certain females… like my mother… that is about it. Females are full of sympathy. Always ready to try and make you feel better. All they while getting as much gossip they can while you are in a vulnerable state. Not only that, they give you that reassuring smile while telling you they are your best friend and are only there to protect you from the harmful matters of the world. I should know, I am female. I’ve had the temptation to do such horrible things, but I have refrained because I know how it feels to be in the position of the one getting the sympathy. Almost all females have been on both ends, but still all females want to do is backstab each other to make themselves feel better. Example #1: My best friend, one of them at least (isn’t it funny that there should be more then one just in case something like this happens?), has always told me that I am just the best person. She told me that I would always be her best friend because we get along so well together. Somewhere along the way we had become best friends. I think it happened because she said it so much.  About 9 months into a relationship, I hear from my boyfriend that this best friend of mine had asked him out several times over a period of a month or two. All the while she was telling me that I am the best girlfriend and that my boyfriend and I look so good together. She was telling me that she hopes I always stay with him. Those words mean absolutely nothing now.  The worst thing about this situation is that I never got a chance to slap her for trying to steal my boyfriend. I did not even get the chance to confront her about what she did. She had had the nerve to beg my boyfriend not to tell me about what happened. She made him promise her. He kept the promise for a while, but found it hard to keep it from me. He felt I needed to know so he told me everything. I was shocked when I found out and even more appalled that she had expected him not to mention these details to me. Yet of course she still is my friend. When I see her I smile and ask how she has been. Ask about the latest gossip and laugh along with her. I had promised my boyfriend that I would not confront her. She has stopped chasing him and I do not feel like having enemies. My revenge is the knowledge I have him and she doesn’t. I also figure that people like her will get what they deserve and I am not the one who should dish out the vengeance on them, life will do as it pleases with their rotting souls. In high school friends and enemies are often the same. Enemies are the ones you call your friends, but ultimately despise and would rather see homeless sitting in a Dumpster bathing in their own filth. Yet throughout high school you have to bare them or risk becoming the outcast. In most cases the enemies that you label as friend, knows they are your enemy and that you will do nothing to them. They can feel the fact that you are too passive and do not want to cause a scene, so you will keep quite and not disturb them as they try to make your life miserable.  This brings me to example #2. She was a friend. One of those people that are more then just acquaintances, but less then hang out with after school kind of friend. She was until she found out that my boyfriend was moving. Then she started saying that she is his best friend and that I am holding him back. She calls me names to my face and says things to everyone else. Some people she has convinced or just they have nothing better to do then try and impress her so they join in with the haggling. Most other people have chosen to ignore her ranting and to label her as insane, as I have. Still she persists in breaking my boyfriend and me up. She gropes him every chance she gets and never stops calling me a slut. She has tried endlessly to make him break up with me because she feels I have whipped him and he does not like being with me. She has gone out of her way trying to make me hate her and to make me feel bad for not letting him sleep around like she says normal boys do. The list can go on forever but I do not wish to bore you with the details of her harassment.   Yet I remain passive. I stand up for myself just enough so she knows I am alive and still with him. She still is my boyfriend’s friend so he endures her nagging, but stands up for the one he loves. She treats me like shit, but I say nothing because she doesn’t do it to anyone else and other people that are my friends still hang out with her and consider her a good friend. I have 2 years left of high school and I have come to the point where I don’t care about the people that I attend classes with, best friend or not. None of them have even done anything for me and don’t seem to care about anything else besides having fun and putting other people down which are often the same thing. My boyfriend moved just over a week ago, so my refuge is gone. I really don’t have someone I can bitch to in classes about the people that are just out there to hurt. There are a few who still bug me about having a long distance relationship and still persist, saying that I am too young and I need to let him do think with his dick.  There are 2 years left. After I will be free of these people and all I have to do sit and have fun with the people I could care less about. Then I will go into the world and will most likely find slightly older versions of the people I have mentioned. In conclusion, people suck.      -  Dark Lily  0>--}----

       Living the Wal-Mart life…well I almost did   Some of you may know that I had recently applied at my local Wal-Mart.  Needless to say, I didn’t get the job.  Apparently I’m not good enough for Wal-Mart, you’d think that I would be offended.  But you see they expect that a full time student would be at the store working when he normally gets out of class. I don’t know about all you guys but I see some slight schedule conflicts here. And there’s no way that I’m skipping class everyday just so I can work at Wal-Mart.  And I find it a little suspicious how many questions they ask about pot and other drugs.  Like if they saw a superior using an illegal drug what would you do? I think that Wal-Mart is full of druggies, it makes a lot of sense doesn’t it?  They always smile, they never pay attention, and they smell funny. It all adds points to one thing…Wal-Mart is full of stoners. And now that I think about it I wouldn’t want to work there very much anyway.  I don’t want to wear the bib…I mean…the smock, I’d better say that so I don’t offend the employees. But what am I complaining about?  There are tons of desperate companies out there plenty willing to hire me. So I’m going to apply and hope for the best. HOOHAH!  -Matt

       Money, Money, Everywhere, lets all take a drink   After reading Dark lily’s blog I was inspired to write this one.  I don’t understand why people complain about not being able to get a job.  They’re everywhere, it’s like they grow on trees, I myself have 2, and oh many of you will never understand the simple joy of having more money then anyone else.  And no I’m not one of those snobby rich kids whose parents give them everything thing they want…like a car…I think those people should be shot. Me, I’m one of those honest working shmoes that busts his ass trying to make a lot of money, possibly to go to Greece during spring break.  And while I can sympathize with people who don’t want to work in fast food place (I’m one the people who doesn’t want to, incase you can’t tell) sometimes you got to suck it up and go with the flow.  But yes, I guess the whole point of this is to say that I’m stinking rich and loving it!!!!!  But just a tip to all of you who have large sums of money, always lend to your friends because you never know when that one time that you’ll be short on cash will come up, and if you are greedy you can probably expect the same thing back.   -Matt

        i am so broke it's not even funny    The most money I have right now is in my penny jar and that might as well belong to my youngest brother since I still owe him 10 more bucks. I just paid him 20$ I owed him and 10 more to go. I could have that money by now but my dad has decided that he isn’t going to pay me the 10$ he owes me. Today I saw Signs (Pretty good thriller movie. My dad didn’t like it because it mentions God, but that’s his problem.). We were getting candy for the movie from London Drugs. The usual, stuff as much stuff into your pockets because theatre candy is too much and it's more fun to sneak stuff in. Well anyway, he had told my brother and me that we could get what we wanted. So I got a Snapple, chocolate Pocky (or is it Pokey?) box, and a tube of mini M&M’s. On the way out I spotted some sweet Star Wars Pez dispensers and decided to grab a couple of those. My brother grabbed about the same things as I did. After we had paid and started to walk to the car, my dad informed me that I owed him money. Somehow my brother and I combined had spent about 10$ and he wanted his money back. He  told  us that we could take what we wanted and now he was saying that he was only going to pay for 2 candies, the cheapest ones and I owed him the rest. So that meant that he didn’t owe me any money anymore and that I was now out 10$. Now there is no way my brother is going to reimburse me so I’m stuck till I can guilt my dad into giving me the money back. Its either he gives me money or I'm never letting him borrow money again. What a family hey? Hopefully I’ll be out of the hole soon. Then I can continue being poor.  I was hoping that my pennies would survive until I was an old lady. That way I could go to the store and by something huge with only pennies and count them out very slowly, one by one. I have big plans for when I'm old. Bug as many people as I can. I think I might even pretend to go deaf and just never wear my hearing aid so I can see what people say about me behind my back.   Along with the fact that I don’t have any money, is that I can’t get a job because I’ll be leaving in less then 2 months. Nobody wants to hire me for 2 months now except for berry picking and crap like that. No thank you, but I prefer not to get heat stroke every day while working. I’m being sort of picky because I refuse to work at a fast food place or as a waitress. They get treated like less then crap and I’ve seen what those kinds of jobs can do to a person. I just wish that I could get a job and have money right now because everything I want to do involves money. Fly to see Louis ---> money, buy digital camera ---> money, etc. Why can’t money just fall into my lap and not have me do anything for it? Because the world didn’t want me to be one of those snobby rich kids, it wanted me to be a poor whinny kid.  In summary: I NEED A JOB!   - Dark Lily  0>--}----

       Old people: Wrinkly and scary   Today I went out to a Wendy’s, I usually don’t go there because quite frankly I find the burgers there too greasy and really gross tasting. But anyway, back to the point of this blog.  I sat down with my food, eating a spicy chicken burger (the only think I could bring myself to eat). I was there for only a couple minutes when a rather aged, old lady sat down at the table next to me, in the process she pushed a napkin on the floor then said “I’ll just push it on the floor like everyone else” then commenced laughing.  I don’t know why, what she said wasn’t all that funny, after all what’s so great about littering and making someone else pick it up?  I thought that this was the end of my conversation with the creepy old lady. But no she continued the conversation from there, and this is sort of how it went…  Old lady- “so do you like the burgers here?” Me- “I guess” takes a bite Old lady- “I like the burgers here, the best burgers in town they are.” Me- “yup.” Drinks pop Old lady- “I know some people that don’t like the burgers here, so when they say that, I tell them that I’ve had their burgers and they aren’t that good” Me- Smirks, then eats some fries, realizes they’re gross so I put them down Old lady- “yes I tell them what I think, I don’t care how they react…”  Fortunately at this point in time one of the old lady’s friends came by and they promptly forgot about me.  But in conclusion I think that all old people should be locked away, for their own safety as much as our own.  Except for my grandma, because she’s to nice for the world to be deprived of her. -Matt

       A day at the ice cream parlor.   As I went into a local dairy queen today (actually it’s not very local, it’s about 15 driving minutes away), I saw on one of them little stand up signs advertising something called cake on a stick.  I figured why couldn’t they actually come up with a good name for it?  Like a 3D Dilly bar?  Or cake pop?  But nooooooooo they called it cake on a stick, the most unoriginal name ever.  So what do I do? I bought one naturally, what doesn’t taste better on a stick?  When I received this supposed “cake on a stick” I was gravely disappointed, not only was I about twice the price of a Dilly bar, but it was about half the size too.  This was an outrage; there was a seriously low ice cream to money ratio here.  Not only that but after a few minutes the ice cream melted enough that the whole cake on a stick fell off, I ate it anyway but it’s just not the same when it’s not on a stick.  But anyway, that was just one of my many adventures to come.  Stay tuned for “Living the Wal-mart life” but that’s only if I get the job. -Matt

       Hair nazi.   I have recently been part of a tragedy. But does anyone care?? No. No one does. But I don’t blame them. This tragedy happens so often, that there’s just so little that our race can do about it. Incase, you havn’t guessed, or were too lazy to read the title, yes, I have been a victim once again of bad haircut syndrome. A bad, bad haircut. It used to be longish.... Kinda like Harry Potter’s! Except a bit longer.... But now it’s short. Very short. I meant to get it short, but now I look like George freakin bush! This isn’t the first time this has happened to me you know!!!! About once or twice in my life I’ve actually gotten what I wanted!!! Here is a typical example:  “I’d like a mushroom cut please” “Oh. Like the guy on page one!” “no. Not at all. Actually... I’ll just get a ceaser” “Oh! Just like this guy on page one!” “No. That’s a mohawk I do believe. And I’m pretty sure it’s a chick too.  Just shave it off please.” “Like this guy on page one has it?” “Actually... I don’t need a haircut that bad... Thanks anyway.”  And somehow, I still end up with really crappy hair when I walk out. When my career as a lawn gnome maker has made me rich, I’m going to donate all my money to a barber college, so that they can get trained to cut someones hair in a fashion that doesn’t look like anyone on page one.    -Louis (the yanking yankee)     lol   look!

       A note to the readers   As some of you can see i've added a little tag board in the side bar of this page.  So hey!  Let us know what you think! Leave a message at the sound of the beep.  And if you don't want to, you know what, screw you! It's people like you who don't give any input that make the world a crappy place. And then you go and bitch about how life isn't fair, well just shut up! Speak up when you have the chance.  So what are you waiting for?  Go put a message! (And yes i realize the irony of me complaining about other people bitching) -Matt

       Nomad me   For the eighth time in my life, I’ve been forced out of my home. I think it’s eight... Too many to keep track. Which brings to why I have changed my name from the brilliance of “kinky_underpants” to “the yanking yankee”. For the record, I’m not actually a yankee. But in doing so, I stress the point that I am the one who lives in the U.S. Which brings me back to my first point. If it were up to me, I wouldn’t even move from the seat that I’m in now. I would sit here allllllll day. Maybe not here. Because my computer sucks. Maybe if I had a spaceship...... But I digress. The point is that I would be happy living my life within a square meter. All I’d need would be a fridge, Some entertainment, and something that could pose as a washroom. I’d just get people to bring me whatever I need! Like Gimpy from undergrads! Brilliant lad, I say. Instead I pass from city to city, province to province, country to country like the town whore (thank you Matt!). When I’m gone from Ohio and I’m going to university in.... anywhere but here... I’m going to go out of my way to live my dream. Except I may have to leave for classes and garbage...... Actually screw that. I could always make a living....... Carving and selling lawn gnomes! It works on the sims! (thank you dark lily!)    -The Yanking Yankee (louis)    lol

       Portuguese Mafia: Fact or Fiction?   I don’t know if any other people have realized this but we have a serious problem on our hands.  We have recently been overrun by the Portuguese Mafia! I know what you’re thinking, there’s no such thing as the Portuguese Mafia, right?  Well that’s what I thought until a little while ago, until that is, I learned about their dirty little secret. And dirty is right!  They have created a syndicated Ewok porn ring.  They’ve taken our cute and cuddly wuddly little friends from “Return of the Jedi” and perverted them beyond our wildest dreams!  Who knows what other sick, twisted and disgusting things they’ve done?  Just sitting there at their computers, reading their web comics, borrowing other peoples web time at the library so they can go on longer on a faster Internet connection (Hi Ali!!!).  But I warn all of you, take a stand before it’s too late, stop the Mafia before they take our precious care bears, or any other of our cherished childhood cartoon characters and pervert them too.  There is no need to let them go unpunished for the injustice they have caused, stand together, united we will make the Mafia fall!! -Matt (As some of you can see I still have a quite active imagination, don’t worry I will promptly be beaten as soon as a certain Portuguese friend of mine reads this blog)

        Just me rambling!    Hi! This is Dark Lily and I'm the other member of Happy Death. I will write Blogs from time to time. Today i feel like writing about how I am not a geek. Lately I have been accused of being rather geeky. So I happen to enjoy some anime! I like Star Wars but who doesn’t? (Star Trek is pure crap! The whole basis is that they are lost and can’t find there way home. Yet they have all the technology to do all these bizarre things and they can’t even find a freaking map! So I’m being simplistic but my point is that its BAD!) I like video games, but so do most teenagers. So what I like to read? There’s a reason so many books are made every year in the world: people like to read! I like to write.  Lots of people write otherwise there would be no books. Last but not least, the web comics. Yes I like to read some web comics.  I am the same as the people who read comics in the newspaper, mine are just on the Internet! So :P! Thank you for your time.  - Dark Lily  0>--}----

       The Middle of Nowhere, Under a Pile of Dirt.   This blog goes out to all my fellow small town people.  Truly it’s one of the most pathetic ways to live, like at least a homeless person has an excuse to be doing nothing. I guess it’s not all bad, but only if you’re easily amused.  For instance, right now I’m finding myself amused by flicking on and off a flashlight.  That’s not that bad you say?  Well to top it all off there are no batteries in it, in fact there isn’t even a light bulb in it or even an end on it. So basically all I’m doing is playing with a plastic tube with a switch on it (shut up right now all you sick sick dirty minded people, this is no place for such thoughts.  Wait!  What am I saying? This is the Internet, of course it is!).  All I’m saying is that if you live in a small town, do yourself a favor, grow up move to the city and get rich.  Trust me it’ll do wonders to your life. But if the city life isn’t for you, you have 2 options…. 1. Make your computer your best friend, or 2. Learn to shoot and hunt gophers -Matt

       Imperial goodness   I am a Star Wars freak. At least I’m starting to try. HOWEVER my orientation is quite different (not that kind of orientation. I mean towards something else). I prefer the imperials to the rebels. I mean think about it? What have they honestly done that’s wrong? They’re just trying to make a living!!!! And really??? So they kill a few people.... planets..... spaceships..... But I mean hey, who doesn’t??? Look at the rebellion! They wanna stick their noses into the imperial business? Go for it!!!! They pay the price! And their plan was to dominate the galaxy, yes. But think about it... What did the rebellion want to do? Destroy the empire, yes. Henceforth... controlling the galaxy!  A temper problem here... A temper problem there.... Sounds kinda like my familly actually...... Except without the devious plans...... That’s what they are! One big happy galactic familly! Spreading joy and blaster fire to all! But hey, if you’re going to succeed fully, a little bit of blaster fire is an essential part! And their so cool! Darth Vader is my hero! And if you don’t agree with me on this subject... Then  I find your lack of faith disturbing....   -Louis lol

       Religions rule and you know it   I don’t care what anyone says. Especially Matt. In his blog “Holy crap churches Batman!!”, he clearly stated his opinion (although be it misguided) on religion. He’s possessed by Satan. He hasn’t seen the light either. Just a poooor deer caught in the headlights of the giant freight train of atheism! So anyway... I feel that it is my duty, as an open-minded person, to share the other side of the story....... The RIGHT side at that! Yes... I admit. My true religion is Jedi. But I also practice Christianity on the side. Yeeeep! Matt throws em up... And I just keep hittin em dowwwwn! Booya!!!!! Eat THAT! You Suck! God will strike you down with lightning!  Yes, in the past, christians have done some bad things. Very bad things. Even in the present. However...... So did Adolf Hitler. And All the kings in Europe. And the president of the united states of America. Lots of them. It all boils down to a mistake. Everyone makes mistakes. Religions try for a perfect wholesome life, but it doesn’t always succeed. Just like normal human beings, they make mistakes. Which brings me to the priest rapists. Lets see... How many priest rapists are ther actually.... about 20 in total? Maybe? Now... Lets tally up the people who have at any time molested someone, and are NOT priests (Yes Matt. I’m including you in this survey) about 2000000 in the U.S. alone? Not to mention the 70 year old men that sit on the internet all day trying to pick up small children. Like Matt. Again. Mistakes made by these priests. (note: Just for the record, I am not sticking up for people molesting children. And I DO NOT molest them myself. Thank you for your time.) At least the priests have somewhat of an excuse! They have to live alone all their lives with no one. Except God. God is great... But there are certain ahem things in life that cough cough only another human being can fulfill. I mean, how would you feel knowing that you’re never going to get any?? (Again. I do not rape children, and am in no way supporting the decision to rape anyone). At least the other child molesters (like Matt) have a chance! And Does Matt get all the media attention that priests do when he touches a child? No! That’s the answer! If you turn him into* snicker *“Father Matt” *snicker snicker * he’d be nailed * HAHAHAHAHAHA FATHER MATT! * by the media instantly! They scavenge off of big stories. A slip by a holy man is a big story. Feedin time!  All religion convey reletively the same message, whether they admit it or not (hindu guy: what the heck were the christians thinking??? They put their Vishnu on a cross!). They all have “comandments”, if you will, against good things like murder, adultery,  stealing......... Where would we be without these happy little things???? I’d say getting rid of em is a pretty good deal.   And by the way... It’s not necessarily the religious people killing abortion doctors! There’s absolutely no proof! None! Just because they look down on it doesn’t mean they hire hit men. In fact, for all you who have actually taken the time and GONE to church to see both sides....... You would notice that they condemn these acts as much as the abortion act itself.  In conclusion, the world would be corrupt without the unwriten laws of every religion. It’s a CHOICE to be a part of the religion, and to follow it. There’s no one forcing you to do anything that you don’t want to do. It’s just a little extra conscience. Like having 2 angels instead of one on your shoulder!   And I’m glad that Matt doesn’t expect anyone to believe what he’s saying. Because YO MAMA! And your opinions are all easily smack downed! My advice is to not try and take it outside with the big guy upstairs.   Amen  -Louis lol

       Dazed and Confused? I think not!!   It has recently been brought to my attention that I look like a stereotypical stoner (actually this has been going on for quite some time but that’s beside the point).  I’d just like to point out that even if a person has long hair, wears sunglasses a lot, and has a tendency to say trippy a little more then is necessary does in no way mean that he is a stoner.  So if you are at a movie or at the mall or anywhere for that matter don’t go up to the guy and ask for some weed.  You know why? BECAUSE HE DOESN’T HAVE ANY!!!!!  Nothing ruins your day with your friends more then having some jittery, red eyed, sniffing, half freaking out creep coming up to you and saying “Hey man do you got a joint?”  Like come on people do I look stupid enough to do that stuff??  It’s just the kind of thing that makes me want to punch a person out.  And to top it all off even my parents think this too so now I have to deal with them going through my room.  So what I say is, “you want some weed? Well piss off!!” -Matt

       Holy Crap Churches Batman!!!   As I was going through some old papers the other day, because it was raining out so I decided to clean them up, I stumbled across a speech I had written a few months ago.  I'm hoping that most of you aren't religiously inclined and if you are I in no way mean to offend with this speech, but whatever I’ll get chewed out about it by people later.  	God.  A simple 3 letter word that has rocked our world. But it’s not just “God”, it’s all of them, I’m talking about Jehovah, Buddha, Zeus, every single one of them. They al force people to do things that if using their own personal judgement they wouldn’t normally do.  Religion has and still does cause the most horrible atrocities known throughout history and present day. I’m betting that if you’re a religiously inclined person you’re probably thinking that I’m both possessed by santa and trying to corrupt my fellow man.  Or that I’m a “lost soul” who hasn’t yet seen the “light”, or maybe it’s that I’m the deer on the side of the road that sees that the light belongs to a semi racing for you.  Either way I wish to point out just how corrupt and horrible all religion truly is, and also the sheer ignorance and conformist ways of people who are supposedly guided by Dog.   	One example happened awhile ago, on TV I saw a program that was really just a televised mass but the priest said that all of the sexual harassment and pedophiles could be gotten rid of if everyone just turned to Dog.  But the funny but disturbing thing is that there are many accounts of sexual harassment towards children in orphanages from priests other supposed men of Dog and to top it all off, the church is protecting these so called “holy men”.  Can you taste just a bit of irony??  	But this corruption of the church hasn’t just started in recent years, it’s been going on for centuries.  Take for example the crusades, an entire war fought over the “holy” city of Jerusalem.  And what was accomplished?  Thousands of innocent people died for a cause in the name of some non-existent being.  In the first crusade alone many innocent pilgrims died when they were sent against the enemy, many of those pilgrims were unarmed.  The war would go on for over 300 years, when crusade after crusade would go and fight for Jerusalem.  But it was a war! What happened to the so-called peaceful and loving way of god?  	Another thing is during the Middle Ages, religion was used as a form of suppression by using fear, if you did anything wrong, absolutely anything, like missing church you would go to hell.  Religion was also used to explain the unexplainable, like if there was a leaky roof or if an animal got sick it would be blamed on a witch and then there’d be all sorts of wild accusations about who the witch was.  Pure hatred would make people accuse their neighbors, and once accused there was no escape, you died one way or another.  Either by being burned at the stake or through the tests in which case you would die a Christian death.  	Yet another example is the Spanish inquisition, during this time the Spanish royalty and clergy believed that there should be religious uniformity in Spain and they didn’t believe that people had the right to believe what they wanted.  And just like in the witch trials, there’d be wild accusations thrown about and anyone accused of being a heretic would be punished whether they did anything or not.  Anybody accused of being a heretic would be guilty until proven innocent.  People of all other religions were persecuted, such as Jews, Moors, and Muslims, they were all discriminated against.  	Speaking of discrimination, religion has caused the horrible forms of discrimination and bigotry ever, like the oppression of gays.  Religious people believe that other people have no right to choose, they believe that there is only one way to live and one way to believe.  They also don’t believe in a woman’s right to choose whether or not she has an abortion and they think it’s wrong in the extreme.  They say that taking a life is wrong, but they seem to have no problems with murdering the doctors for women’s clinics in the name of God.   	I don’t expect any of you to you to agree with my opinions I just hope that maybe you’ll think twice about anything that seems so good.  Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely; God is all-powerful Draw your own conclusions -Matt

       Attack of the Giant Killer Cats   No this isn't a rant about some B movie that was made somewhere (i like b movies, they're great), it's about something completely different.  Recently on T.V, i saw National Geographics special on giant cats.  At the begining they showed the body of a six year old girl that was attacked and killed by a tiger as she and her parents were grooming it.  Is it just me, or does this seem really stupid to all of you? I mean, what are they expecting from a cat who's instinct is to kill things smaller and weaker then it? Did they think that the tiger would curl up in a ball at the child's feet and start purring? What the fuck? why are people so fucking retarded???  All this bullshit happens beacause people don't think! You have to wonder what was going through their heads right then.  It be something like this... "Dum dee dee, I'm a complete fucking moron, I'll just leave my 6-year-old daughter with this giant meat eating cat!" and to top it off for stupidity, there's a couple in Colorado USA that owns over 52 big cats and they regularly go into the cages and "play" with them.  Their view on big cats is that they shouldn't be handled by people that can't tell what the cat is going to do. Um...I don't know if it occured to them that these animals in general don't speak and don't exactly tell you anything.  Especially if these cats are attacking the fence right behind you, and i don't know about anybody else but i think it's just plain stupid to get in a cage with a snarling giant beast that would rip your head off in the blink of an eye, even more so if it hasn't eaten. I think people that are this stupid should be dragged out into the street and shot in the legs. then beaten with a frozen monkey.  All i know is that if i ever have a kid i'm keeping it away from those damned tigers. -Matt

       The Adventures of Janitor Man   As probably none of you know, cept for those of you who know me or you creepy stalker types that know eveything about me, I have been working at my school as a janitor.  Yes i know that some of you are now thinking "EWWWW HE"S A DIRTY GARBAGE PICKER!!!" but atleast i have pride in my work and i'm doing something construtive and helpful, it could be worse, i could be a person that packs the boxes at a fudge factory.  But i have had many adventures as a janitor, well not really adventures but thing that i like to bitch about anyway. For instance, the other day as i was sweeping minding my own business when i was overwhelmed by a stench that resembled rancid tuna mixed with year old used kitty litter. it was so horrible my eyes started to water...well my co-worker and me tracked down the accused locker and attempted to open it with what was apperently the combination, 10 minutes later with us no closer to opening the locker and me getting increasingly fed up with the stench, out come the bolt cutters! these aren't any run of the mill bolt cutters, they're some mother ass bolt cutters, they can cut through 2 inches of steel in less then a second(actually i don't know this, but i like to assume). well needless to say Mr. piss ass combination lock didn't stand a chance.  it was as i opened the locker that i realised the stupidity of my haste, it's surprising how much smell a locker door can keep in. After the initial shock of the stench multiplying tenfold and also after the gagging had ceased and my vision cleared up i peered into the locker and was greeted with a stack of lunches that dated back from the beginning of the year (september).  I was tempted at this point to poke at them with a stick but i was affraid that they'd be prevoked into attacking. so on it was with the gloves and i did the best i could to cover my nose, it wouldn't have been so bad if one of the bags hadn't started dripping some strangly colored liquid (actually it was kinda brownish but i wanted to tone it down a bit). Long story short after many close calls with bringing back that days lunch, we eventually got everything out of the locker. At this point the whole hall way rank of rancid tuna and old kitty litter. but it was another job well done for JANITOR MAN!!!! (cool sounding music) -Matt

       Ring or no ring, it's still a freaking chain letter!!   Well i finally got around to seeing this supposed great movie "The Ring", i tell you something it was such a let down that i almost cried that wasted $6.50 to go see it.  all it freaking is is a movie about a video that kills you if you don't copy it and pass it on.  seriously, is hollywood running out of ideas that they have to write a "horror" film about a chain letter??  what's next? a movie about a cursed apple juice box that if you don't kick it 13 times your underwear will never fit right again?? mmmmmmmm apple juice. really i think more ppl should drink apple juice i think we should have apple juice fountains. can you tell i like apple juice? i really hate chain letter...i don't see what kind of person could fall for that kind of bullshit? how is sending an electronic mail going to, in any way shape or form, affect your love life, sex life, luck, or any other aspect of your life? i hate to break it to some of you chain letter fanatics out there, but they don't work. from all the ones i HAVEN'T sent i should have died in a plane crash twice, had 7 heart attacks, been killed in 3 car accidents, all my family and friends should be dead 4 times over, i'd have 278 years of bad luck, 56 years of bad sex, my crush will go for my best friend 3 times, and i should've also been beaten to death by a rabid monkey.  i don't know about you guys but i think a rabid monkey would have a hard time getting to canada. maybe i'll make up my own chain letter. i think i will. watch out it'll come to a town near YOU! -Matt

       Trick or fuck it   Recently halloween has come to pass. Yes i know most of you absolutly love halloween, if you're younger you get to go trick or treating and if you're older you love seeing all those little kids dressed up.  Me, it's a different story all together, i hate halloween.  I hate every part of it, i hate handing out candy to all those greedy little kids that think i'm stuid enough to be fooled by their "brilliant" plan to get more candy by putting on a different mask. Especially since i know every kid in my neighbourhood.  I also hate going trick or treating just to freeze my ass of for a few candies.  And most of all, i hate the kids that are bored of the treat part of halloween and go for tricks.  The stupid little kids come by every year with their arsenal of eggs, toilet paper, flaming dog crap, and various rotten vegetables.  Every year they  and every year i chase them off. Usually i'll have a water gun o balloons, i know you're thinkng "whoop-dee-doo water never hurt anyone" but when it's cold out and you're a long way from home the last thing you want is to get wet. I tell you though, next year i'll be ready for those little bastards, i'll be in the bush with a paint ball gun. -Matt

       Holy cheese Monkies!!!   Wow! it's been such a long time since i last blogged it's not even funny anymore. you know what i blame, society. isn't that convieniant? if any thing goes wrong you can blame society. Some crazy chick beats her kids to death with a shovel and is arrested and put on trial, she says that she was beaten as a child and abbused by society and she's praised as a hero for coming through it. or some guy goes postal and he blames it on the fact that he was picked on when he was in elementary school. All this bullshit about everythingbeing society's fault has gotta just damn well piss off alot of you. People can make choices, something that happened all that long time ago shouldn't influence your actions let alone be the cause of them, meaning that you can't be put in jail for stabbing 10 people to death with an ice pick because your brother flicked toothpicks at them when you were a baby. Another thing that pisses me off is how cheap people are when it cames to remembrance day. come on people, these veterans faught for your country's freedom and all you can give for a poppy is a pathetic 5 cents??? dig deep you cheap bastards! atleast give a dollar, or 5 because we owe them our very lives. and go to a freaking remembrance day ceremony, november 11th isn't just a day off so you can sleep in, it's the day we honor those who died fighting for this great land of ours called Canada.  -Matt

       Boxing day bullshit   I hate boxing day. I always have. it's a day made up by big corperations so they can sell more products. The main reason i hate boxing day is because if you have a legitimate reason to go out and buy something everyone is out buying a whole bunch of crap! take todays boxing day for example, i was dragged out shopping by my mom because apperently she needed help. we went into the local (well not really local it's a 15 minute drive) Wal-mart and there were old people everywhere! If you've read some of my other blogs you'll understand that i don't like old people, and i hate the average wal-mart customer even more. they seem to not grasp that a shopping cart and a narrow aisle don't mix, especially if there's another person coming the other way and there's no room to pass, and yelling at each other seems to make a difference to them. and weeeeeeeeeeeeee! two cents off chrismas tuna! lets all crowd around because it'll never be that cheap again. and people! learn to freaking put stuff back on the shelf!!! it's not that hard. Damned holiday season! i hate it! don't get me wrong though...i love christmas, i just hate the season and the people. -Matt

       Chain letters: The Cancer of the Internet   You wake up one day and go to check your e-mail, you log on expectingmaybe an e-mail from one of your friends or possibly from family. As you check your inbox you discover an overly large amount of e-mails that are no more then chainletters. they're annoying, stupid, and they take up valuable space. you have to wonder who makes them? who would actually take the time to create one. recently i recieved one that pecticularly annoyed me...   It's Friday night and you are driving your car. ( what kind of car are you driving?) (YOU ARE THE DRIVER!!!) You can only have FOUR other people in the car with you. ( who is in the car with you?) As you drive, you and your friends start chillin to some music. ( what song are you all listening to?) So, there you are chillin to some music with four other people all of a sudden this crazy driver hits you in the back! You are flying down the road out of control. You hit a speed bump and the car flips and lands upside-down in the grass beside the road. You lay there crying because you are in so much pain You hear nothing but silence. silence silence silence. You try to yell out to your friends, but you are in so much pain and shock the words won't come out. You lay there for about 2 minutes, but to you it seems like 60 minutes. You finally hear something. You hear the ambulance and you have never felt more relieved. You lay there, still in the car, thinkin about your family, friends, School, past holidays, old friends, old lovers You start to pray for the other people in the car and for yourself. The paramedics get you out of the car, put you on a stretcher, and then into the ambulance. you see nothing and hear nothing but a void....you are alone You don't get a chance to see the other people that were in the car with you As they drive to the hospital, you pray and think to yourself "Am I going to die?" Where are my friends? Are they okay? What's going to happen to me.......? Did you die or not? What happened to your friends that were in the car with you......? They all died. All of the other people in the car died. They are all gone. You'll never get to see them again. As for you... you died too. Wait you were just imagining....right ? But what if it were real? What if it really happened to you? Think about it.... That car was the LAST car you were EVER in with your friends. Those four people were the LAST people you EVER saw. Did you pick the four people in the car with you wisely... or do you wish that someone else was in the car with you? The song you were chillin to was the LAST song you EVER heard. Don't you wish you could have had the chance to tell everyone you loved them? Don't you wish you could have told your parents you loved them one last time? Don't you wish you could have kissed your boy/girlfriend one last time? Don't you wish you could have told your crush how much you loved them? Don't you wish you could hug your friends one last time? Don't you wish you had the chance to do all of those things? You still do. Send this email to everyone you love, hate,... friends, family, even enemies. Just send this to everyone you know. This really didn't happen to you. But, pray for all of the people that it DID happen to. AND remember this quote: "Live every day to its fullest......" and when someone says that they love you, know the meaning of it and mean it when you say it too.    now is it just me or did it just ask you to pick 4 friends that would die with you? now i don't know about the rest of you but i wouldn't want any of my friends to die with me. why would anybody want 4 of their friends to die with them just so they were the last 4 ppl they saw? I really hate chain letters...but i hate ppl who believe them even more. how can an e-mail in any way shape or form affect your life? seriously, sending an e-mail won't give you good luck or good sex. and not sending it won't cause you to be shot by an albino midget. i think people who send them should be dragged out into the street and shot dammit! -Matt

       The Oddities of the Human Race   Most of my female friends are probably going smack me after reading this blog, actually almost all of them will because they do anyway on a regular basis. AS you can probably tell, this blog bashes women. It was actually an essay for English but I decided to share it with all you bloggers out there. I got 80% on this bugger so enjoy...        The battle of the sexes involving the normality of men and the abnormality of women is directly proportioned to the actions of said sexes. Taking into account the emotions and complex verbal and non-verbal communications used by women to confuse and disorient men, the conclusion has been drawn that all persons of said feminine sex are oddities. In other words, all women are very strange.        One abnormality of females is their unfounded fear of being alone.  They seem to take the term “strength in numbers” entirely too seriously.  For instance, women can’t go to the bathroom alone. But perhaps it isn’t that women are afraid to be alone; maybe they need coaching? The fear of being solitary goes to such great extents that women will stay on the phone for hours to avoid realizing their temporary position as a hermit. Most of the time spent on the phone is used for the exchange of gossip. The transaction of abnormally juicy gossip can be identified by the use of “like, oh my god!” which will be repeated several times throughout the conversation.        Confusing and frustrating men seems to be a favorite pass time for women, it’s as if seeing a man have a nervous breakdown amuses them.  Women expect a guy to read minds.  He must know exactly what to do in every situation, even a new one, and he has to know exactly what the problem is from a simple “hello”.  Another example is what men have unofficially dubbed “The Question of Doom”.  This question has no right answer.  At first when asked if a woman is fat the first response is to say no.  The problem with this is if  “no” is said to fast the man will be accused of trying to cover something up, but if no is said to slowly his hesitation will be taken as a yes.  And of course it does not need to be mentioned what would happen if the response actually were yes.  If a man compliments any female she will over analyze what he said and from a compliment about her hair she will take it to mean something as drastic as he hates her and is moving to Africa.  Probably the most frustrating thing that women do is get ready to go out.  It seems that getting ready must be done in no less then two hours else the whole world will end.  Their whole outfit must be laid out before them and the colors must compliment each other perfectly.  Which brings up another point, white is white, there is no eggshell, no mother of pearl, no anything!  It’s all white, women seem to think that a prettier name makes it a different color, and they get annoyed at men who say that sea foam is just light green.       Anything mechanical seems to elude women.  To women a car is just a jumble of metal that gets you from point A to point B.  When the oil light comes on the thought of actually changing the oil occurs to them, the problem can be solved simply with a piece of tape over the light.  Power tools are all hammers that are in various shapes and sizes.  It doesn’t matter what the actual use of the tool is, as long as it can drive a nail into wood it’s a hammer.        Some strange habits women have make no sense to the opposite sex, such as shopping.  To women, shopping is a competitive sport.  Nothing seems to beat the thrill of rushing through a store with a shopping cart racing to the bargain bins just to get socks for two cents cheaper than usual.  Another habit is how women seem to have a shoe for every situation. No matter their mood, time of day or weather, they have a shoe specifically for it.  Bugs are another one, it’s unbelievable how they can be afraid of something that’s a mere fraction of their size.  Most bugs can’t harm you in anyway, yet women seem to be petrified of them.       It truly is amazing how the survival of the human race relies on something so strange.  A woman might argue that men are worse then women, but at least we can go to the bathroom alone and aren’t in a constant state of paranoia that we will be mobbed by viscous ladybugs.  I'm well aware that some of you female readers are probably wondering how i got such a good mark on this, sometimes i wonder the same thing. but just because i want to mention it, my teacher is Mrs. Woods, and she hates me because of my little incidents that always occur that seem to piss her off. but she gave me 80 on this sucker and she is female (at least she appears to be) so that has to mean something. -Matt

       Fecking Pedestrians   Well today i went out shopping, as i was leaving superstore i witnessed someone doing something extremely stupid.  Actually lets give you a bit of background info first. As a small child i was told to always look both ways before crossing a street.  And now-a-days they have this little thingy called "Pause Point Proceed" now where in that does it tell you to check.  Most people having common sense will understand that you shoud always look before you walk out on to the road. Except for this one old lady, she stopped, looked straight ahead and pointe across the street, then started walking, giving no head to the car that was coming very fast up on her right. to top it off she was hidden behind a parked van.  fortunately the car stopped in time, but this old lady didn't even know it, she just kept on walking like a heterosexual man would when going by a gay bar. this is bullshit! yes i know that in Alberta the pedestrian has the right of way but, fuck! right of way or no right of way you don't just walk out on a street when there are thousands of pounds a metal rushing about at outrageous speeds. i like Quebec's way of doing it, the car has the right of way. you step out on that street and 5 cars swerve to hit you. and i don't think people here know the meaning of a crosswalk, they just go on the street where ever they want. i think that you should be allowed to hit pedestrians that piss you off. just like... "Fucking person just walked in front of me when i'm driving!" **WHACK** "that'll learn that bastard  to use a crosswalk" of course if they die then they won't be using the cross walk anyway, but if they die that means they won't be walking out in the middle of the road either. -Matt

       Damn Ukrainian Christmas   yes i know i'm a bit late on this one but hey! i don't care. almost a week ago it was Ukrainian christmas (or orthodox christmas if you wish to call it that).  ah yes, some of you may think that it would be great to have 2 chrismases, twice the presents right? WRONG! i don't get presents on UC (Ukrainian Christmas) all i get is a big meal with no meat in it, but hey that part of it isn't so bad. it's the whole family thing, 30 people at one table, saying some prayers in a language i dont care to know. and also if you've ever been in a house full of 30 Ukrainians who are all traditional, and you're the one who is the black sheep and is different from EEEEEveryone else, you'd understand my situation better. but that's not even the worst part, UC carrolers! the absolute most horrible thing known to man, these people i swear have mastered the art of imitating the sound of a cat that's being beaten. it's horrible, and every time someone new comes that isn't Ukrainian, we have to warn them to avoid any...complications. so basically we all just try to sit there and smile to pretend that we like the singing just to placate my great aunt who would kill us if she caught us making fun of it. Never by your own free choice should you listen to UC carrols. i warn you all, stay away! -Matt

       school daze   Ah yes! that perpetual mind numbing necessity of life. originally i had written this blog at school during one of my classes but it wouldn't let me publish it. oh well, everyday is the same for me Math right in the morning Chem right after lunch and social studies after that, the only change is everyday in my second block i alternate from com tech to special projects, special projects is probably the most tedious class i have, every second day i have to run around like a chicken with it's head cut off trying to get all the jobs done that the teacher that i'm helping needs me to do. it's stupid, she has me looking for lyrics for songs by an artist that apperently only ever wrote 3, but there i was listening to proof that he had more. then she wanted me to listen to the songs and write down the lrics from what i heard on the CD. well that's all fine and dandy, cept for that it's in FRENCH!!!! and he sings really fucking fast, so here i am trying to do all this and then she asks me if i can finish by the end of class??? what the fuck??? i can't even understand most of what he's saying and you want me to finish by the end of class??? i said to myself FUCKIT and i didn't do it and made up some lame excuse. and of course chem, fun by the ton. it was great! we did and experiment and we got to use this temperature mesurig thingy and get this it was call a probe, now of course my teacher had to explain to us that it should not be used in any part of the body, but me being th emature person i am i had to probe some people's ears and the like, and i found out that if i rubbed it with my had enough i could get it to 50 degrees Celcius :D oh the things you learn in chem class. but it's all a daze. -Matt

       The Yanks VS.......well....almost everyone else   As it's been very hard to miss, unless of course you're stuck in some hole and don't have any contact with the outside world....or you're just plain stupid (ahem...Kayla), that kind and wonderful president to the south, Mr. Bush (or as i like to call him, fuck nugget) wants to start yet another war. Iraq is the devil so he says, and he has support for this as well strangely enough. apperently it's all because of terrorism, and because the inspectors can't find any evidence that they have any weapons of mass destruction that means Saddam  must  have them, what better proof that they have weapons then the utter lack of them. there's been talk that they want to use nuclear weapons, and of course the tree hugging hippy wannabes are against this. there's demonstrations and the like, but one thing that really caught my attention was some people bringing up a technique that was use when U.S. was going to nuke China all them long years ago, the protestors sent the president thousands upon thousands of little bags of rice saying  feed thy enemy . sure, it was a great way to show their point then when they had a resonable president, but now in the time of extra-super-sonic jets and tactical nuclear strikes and such, all of which are at the beck and call of a trigger happy texan, i don't really think they'll help. well maybe if you got enough of them and flew over him with a plane and threw them at him to knck him out then yes that could help, a little. and where does Canada stand on this issue? Canada's torn, between the fact that we're USA's bitch and that NATO is against the nuking and Canada has been on every peace keeping mission ever. of course i'm sure the government will make the right choice, or at least do whatever we're threatened to do. but whatever, if they're gonna go at it with nukes and shit at least it'll be a lght show that you'll never forget, or need to remember very long for that matter. -Matt

       Damned city people!   Ah yes! the other day i finally got around to seeing  8 Crazy nights  with my girlfriend, it was an ok movie i suppose but one thing i hated was ALL THOSE DAMNED CITY PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!! seriously, i can't stand them, all those know it all fashion obsessed too much make-up wearing sheep, piss the hell out of me. so fucking inconciderate too, there was a group of maybe 5 girls that were standing around talking in high, ditzy, "um, like, duh" voices, right in front of the fucking ticket counter with the sickly sweet stench of too much perfume wafting off of them. but they were right where everyone else wanted to go and you couldn't tell if they were going to buy a ticket or just stand there like fucking retards. and another thing is those stupid dance video games? seriously?? what the hell??? you get some music, find some clear floor space AND YOU FUCKING DANCE!!!!!! you don't need to spend all that money just to put some stupid numbers on a stupid screen that just shows people that you can put your foot down when the little flashy lights tell you too better then anyone else. you can dance anywhere if you really want to, and you can do it for free too. now when you get to those fighting games and first person shooters that's different, how often can you go around shooting random people? or dinosaurs? you can't! either because it's illegal or because they're extinct. Even racing games serve some point, while they aren't all together realistic, people don't have to spend years training and practising to become good enough to actually be allowed to race and they don't have to fear for their lives everytime they get behind the wheel. not to mention people look fucking retarded just stomping around, i know, i'll make a game where you have to sweep floors, not only will you be paying to do somethng that you would normally be paid to do, but i'll have huge competitions so that some lucky boy or girl can proove that they are the best. Hey, stuff that's even more impossible have happened before, like the Yanks learning how to read. -Matt

       The Legend of the Golden Trout   Ok so I’m bored and decided to write myself a very short trout story to pass the time. Guess what it's inspired by!  The waves could be heard as they viciously hit the side of the shack. With each pounding of the waves, more of the outer wall was being taken away. Lake Doom was living up to its name. It was devouring everything that had set itself up along the shores. Elensar, in a desperate move to save himself and his home, ran outside in the terrifying storm to seek the help of anyone that he came across. He needed to find someone that could help him keep his house from being taken by the waves. He ran blindly in the pouring ran, trying to make his way for the town not too far away. The winds started to pick up and soon they were strong enough to make him loose his footing. He fell several times while pushing to make his way to the town. He tried for hours but soon realized that he was getting nowhere near his goal. The winds were just too strong for him. He started to turn when he heard a thwack, then everything went black. He awoke to birds chirping. His head was pounding and he had to fight to keep from falling down as he tried to stand up. When he steadied himself he realized that the storm had passed and now the sun was shinning bright. The pitch-black waters of Lake Doom were now eerily silent. Elensar took a step forward only to fall to the ground again. He got up groaning and looked back to see what had tripped him. It was a giant trout. He crawled over to it and saw that the wet golden scales were covered with words from his native tongue. He picked up the Golden Trout and read: One Trout to rule them all, One Trout to find them, One Trout to bring them all and in the water bind them.   And well since that had nothing to do with anything, I will go to sleep now so maybe I will become sane in the morning.  -  Dark Lily  0>--}----

       Icy Death   Well it's long over due that i write another blog, so i figured i'd my long overdue blog about me getting something that's long overdue, which would be my license. You see here in Alberta we can get our license right when we turn 16, well me being the procrastinator that i am, i still haven't gotten it. so here i am am almost a year later and i'm just starting to learn how to drive. well i really doubt that any of you don't know this but it's winter out there, and icy roads and driving for the first time don't mix. This is why i have come to the conclusion that driving instructors are the worlds bravest people, they go out everyday day, rain or shine, snow or sleet, with people that have little or no driving skills and in 10 hours try to teach them how to be functioning members of driving society. all that's stands between them and certain doom is one tiny little brake peddle...what would happen on an icy road if that thing jammed up?........... -Matt

       Matt isn't the only one with no life   Yes I am blogging. The only reason I say Matt has no life is because he somehow finds time to blog pretty frequently which for me would be impossible since I am just too lazy to even try. I have so much work to do since my spring break just finished. I have to suffer once again from that horrible thing called school. I think though that this is a better waste of my time then homework. Although I might have physics and chem homework and probably a socials project that is due most likely tomorrow... I am sticking by this quote so I don't have to do it: "Work pays off in the future, but laziness pays off now." So I figure that if I am always lazy, it will always pay off and I will never have to work. Yes flawed logic that is laced with denial and total ignorance is always fun. I just lost my total point to whatever I was writing because I was distracted by the flashy 40% off sign on amazon.ca.... It was for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. So I ordered it, but not from that site. I got it from chapters.ca because then I don't have to pay the stupid PST that comes with living in BC. Evil evil place. Oh well at least now I get free shipping and not have to pay the evil tax and I get a good book when it come out! Hmm... that would make a good commercial for chapters. "Pre-order the new Harry Potter books and get FREE shipping and 40% off! That's not all... you also don't have to pay those shitty scams they call provincial taxes!" Couldn't you just picture a used car sales man type of guy with a flashy smile telling you all this? And yes I am aware that Alberta is lucky and doesn't have to pay the 7.5% tax we have to pay on top of GST. That's why I love to shop there when I buy expensive things. Either that or I just say I'm 13 when I buy clothes and I get exempt from it anyway. The only thing the PST really bugs me on is when I buy my DVDs because if I buy box sets and I can't find them on chapters.ca then I usually have to pay an extra $50 just for that one dumb tax. Yes life is unfair because I am now in debt and don't have a job since nobody seems to want to employ me because I have no experience. Although the being in debt part is my fault because I just developed a nasty habit of buying DVDs and books. I think that in the last 3 months alone I spent $300 on both.... heehee... oospy... that was basically all the money I will see for the rest of the year. But on the plus side my collections are both growing steadily! I now have 49 DVDs to my name that I absolutely adore and would not be able to live without. Stupid amazon has a wish list page that makes it so I can put any more movies that I want but can't buy yet there... so I have 22 of them just sitting and waiting.... all calling my name. To any of those actually reading this... yes I have a problem...  - Dark Lily  0>--}----

       ooooooooooooooooo see the pretty light!   wow here i am getting all drowsy and such from taking benadryll, beacause my allergies are acting up again because a certain assholic someone likes to keep sucking back those little cancer sticks the advertising companies like to call cigarettes. he just doesn't seem to realize that i'm allergic to them, i can't breath when he smokes them. and it pisses me the fuck off. so here i am, trying to air out the house at 11 pm when it's freezing outside just so i can breath enough to fall asleep. i hate smoking, i hate people that smoke, i hate the principle behind smoking. it's disgusting and pointless, wow lets fill our lungs with smoke and goo and kill ourselves slowly and painfully, what fun!!! what's funny is those people that smoke "to calm their nerves" hate to break it them but nicotine is a stimulant and it'll aggravate you even more, next time you want to calm your nerves why don't you do us all a favor and hit yourself with a baseball bat, trust me it's better for you, and not to metion safer for the rest of us, and it'll give us all something to laugh about. they recently passed a law that makes it illegal to smoke in public places! i love it! no more having to put up with the stench of vaporized tar and other such chemicals. but there are always stupid people that are opposed to goods things, like the private business owners that say it'll make them lose business...now let me get this straight...they'll lose business because no one can smoke, but no other place can have smokers either, so it really doesn't matter because when people want to go out they will. aie! what stupid people. -Matt

       Procrastinator Deluxe   Yep that's me! huge procrastinator, why am i you might ask...well i have many such examples, one for example is how i should have finished my drivers training and had my license back at the begining of february and here i am nearing the end of march and i haven't even finished my 10 hours in car yet, yes i'm still a bad driver and maybe that could have some influence why i don't want to get back in that car sometimes i just don't don't have the nerves for that, take one of the conversations i was having while driving...... me- yea my school is still going to europe despite the war in iraq instructor- yes that might be a little frightening though.....you might want to drive a bit more to the right me- alright why is that? instructor- just to avoid that semi in the other lane at that point i casualy glanced to my left to see that i was a mere 3 feet from the semi that was right next to me and i proceeded to attempt to hide my freaking out. as you can see i have a good reason to not like driving. but also just today i finally got around to getting my travellers checks and euro dollars for my trip which i leave on friday...oooooooooooo fun! but it brings up a good point...doesn't euro look strangely like monopoly money? seriously, when she handed me the money i was thinking is this really money? it should be out of a game or something. i like my canadian money it's all pretty and real looking. i wonder what the coins will be like? -Matt

       Gotta love a sport that has a hooker   I've been told thast i have the build of a rugby player, maybe that had something to do with me joining my schools rugby team, or maybe because i was sorta pressured into it, i'd personally like to think that it's because i've always liked rugby and always wanted to play it. sure there are guys playing that are bigger and faster then me, and sure i've know people that have broken many many many things while playing rugby...that couldn't happen to me right? some say that ignorance is bliss, that sometimes not knowing what could happen is the best way to go. but me personally, i think that knowing that that 250lb guy is about to crank you six ways from sunday is waaaaaay better then not knowing, atleast you can try to do something. that brings up the whole issue of time travel, what if you could go anywhere in time? learn who would win all sorts of sports things and making a killing off of it, no consequences right? what about the past? me i think that even if you went back in time you couldn't change the past, it's already happened, what if you killed a bug in prehistoric times? i think it was suppsed to happen that way, maybe that bug would've evolved into something that would wipe out humans one day. and what if you killed your parents before you were born? that would make a paradox, you kill your parents.....you were never born........therefore you can't kill your parents because you were never born so they are alive, then you're alive to kill them......you can see where i'm going with this. i can't wait til there's time travel, oh there will be, you'll see. -Matt

       Baby back ribs   yes truly a great this dead baby jokes are. nothing could possibly cheer you up faster then a dead baby joke, yes they may be morbid and more then just a little sick, but everyones inner psychotic will laugh at these ones.  -What's the difference between a truck full of bowling balls and a truck full of dead babies?  You can use a pitch fork with dead babies. -What's funnier then 10 babies nailed to a tree?  A dead baby nailed to 10 trees! -What's black and shiney? A dead baby in a garbage bag! -What's the difference between a dead baby and a live baby? The live baby wriggles when you stick it with a pitch fork -What's red and white and screams all over? A peeled baby covered in salt!!! HAHA! oh they get to me every time! i must thank my twisted friends Sara and Cara for those ones. oh but arent they grand? if anyone can think of more send them in! -Matt

       Greek pasta, Italian salad   a blast to the past...well sorta...originally i had meant to write this a long time ago, like right after i got back, but i got busy, too busy. they say travelling can expand your mind and make you more aware of other cultures. All i really learned is that Italians are crazy drivers and greek people all have "good deal for you" and of course it's "all top quality". as with all trips it never goes all to plan, like for instance me losing my ticket at 4 in the morning at the airport...only to find it half an hour later on the sidewalk outside. then of course there were the constant pickpocketings, muggings (actually this only happened once...well not really...they tried to pick his pocket and he kicked the crap out of 'em) then losing one person in the subway and the stuck up whiney girls bitching about how they won't get to go shopping now, fuck 'em! then the whole incident in the club, and out of the club, when one person in our group got drunk took off out the window and fell 15ft onto his head, and the police wouldn't touch him because if he attacked them they'd shoot him...i love greek police. no i don't...and i hate the italian ones even more, they were everywhere dammit! on every street! and i hatethe breakfast there too! who the fuckeats only a slice of sick tasting bread for breakfast??? i'll bitch more later but for now...i sleep! -Matt

       BLAH SPLAH!   You know...i've tried to keep this thing running, but sometimes people get reall busy, what with Rugby and work and homework that i get tons of in chem 30 that i have to do simply because if i don't i'll fail the whole course, and also i can partially blame the fact that i did just go to greece and italy and it's kinda hard to blog when i'm out of the country and the only computer i had access to and a greek operating system that i couldn't make heads or tails of. also I've yet to have a free weekend to myself, i actually spent my entire birthday which was last friday at school them working and then doing volunteer work, no cake no presents no party no nothing, not to metion that some of my family didn't even remeber til today that it was my birthday. Aye truly i've been busy. as for the message board, that's not my fault, i've gone over the code many a times and found nothing wrong, i've concidered going and using a different one but for that i'm just a bit too lazy.  -Matt

       Boredom...  This place is for me to bitch. So I will, even though I don't have much to bitch about today. I am kind of in a lazy and tired mood that really gets me nowhere. I guess I could say something about how nobody cares about this site at all. I mean Louis had only posted here 4 times and Matt did for a bit than quit. He hasn't even bothered to fix the message board or anything. Plus we don't get any traffic except for maybe people that get sent here by mistake when they do a search that goes bad or some people from forums I go to that might for some reason click on here by some form of boredom/curiosity. Then they realize all this site is for is so I can bitch and they quickly go away. My first posts here were actually good I think. Mostly since I was in a state of depression and it showed very much so in my writing and that made it somewhat interesting to read.  I just realized that even if you read all of my posts here you would know nothing about me. This really is nothing like a journal. You wouldn't know that I have 2 brothers and I only live with my mom or that my best friends are Louis and Keren or that I broke up with my boyfriend of 5 months on April 15th, almost exactly a month after I told him we were having problems. Neither would you know that I was going to break up with him on our 4 month anniversary, but somehow got convinced during our conversation that he would change and that he knew he wasn't treating me right in the first place. I never really realized it was 5 months until I woke up and the first thought in my head was "It's weird that I have a boyfriend and yet don't care that I haven't spent any time with him for about 2 weeks now. Plus before that it was about a week between times I saw him." I think the only reason we managed to spend 5 months together was because we never saw each other in the end and it didn't seem as if we were going out anyway. Also I knew that I wanted to be his friend and really that is what we became in the end of our relationship anyway. - Dark Lily  0>--}----

       Teacher dilemmas    Well... I got a teacher mad at me today. Not only mad, but now she totally distrusts me and the thing was she thought I was at least one of her favorites just this morning. She invited the top 10 people in our grade to go on a conference with her for the day. It was all these workshops in French about future careers in French. Well for the final part of the day my friend wasn't feeling good so we skipped the ending ceremony and went outside. And then just met at the meeting spot at the time everyone was supposed to meet up. But before we got there she noticed we were missing and someone told her that we skipped the whole thing to go shopping. But it wasn't true! When we showed up she wouldn't talk to us because she was so mad. The only thing she told us is that we aren't allowed to go on the 2 other conferences this year and told us never to ask to go on any other one. We didn't get a chance to tell her what happened and now she was so mad at us. She is mad because we didn't tell her were we went and she thinks we skipped out because we weren't having fun and went shopping instead. She took it as a personal attack on her special day. She feels that we were very irresponsible and now she doesn't trust us because we went against her. But all we did was go outside for 30 min and walk around the block a billion times just to get fresh air. I've known this teacher since grade 5 so she is soooo disappointed in me. So now she doesn't trust us and even if we explain it then things wont be the same as before. Since this is the maddest and most hurt I have ever seen her. And so my relationship is screwed up with her... and I know we should have asked her before we left because that wasn't good not too, but its worse what she thinks now about us and I feel sick because she doesn't trust me anymore. - Dark Lily  0>--}----

       It doesn't matter whether I do it or not    I didn't procrastinate. The one time I don't and it still doesn’t help me one bit. I started homework as soon as I got up Saturday morning. Well ok… about an hour after, but I needed to eat and do some other such essential things such as posting (yes I put that there just for you Lou). But right after I actually started my homework! I shut off all my messengers… well a couple of them were on away, but they always are anyway. What did I manage to do? Well I got my scanner working, cropped a few pictures, wrote out exactly half of my autobiography and then managed to get up half a section on the web site. So no matter what I'm screwed because I still have about 60% of that project to do, 2 tests tomorrow and a couple units I have to hand in for various subjects. Plus because most of the world is stupid, we lose an hour. I could actually maybe get an hour of sleep tonight, but noooo…. We need to let that go to waste. I don’t even understand why we do it anyway. I mean we didn't do it when I was in Japan, so I didn't gain that extra hour because they don't feel like doing it, so I basically lost an hour there too. Ack whatever. All I know is school sucks and I can't wait till I leave it. Even this one time I waste a whole Saturday doing homework it helps me none since I still have about 3 days of homework pilled into one day since teachers are cruel.  - Dark Lily  0>--}----

       it's official. i'm fucking trailer trash   Alright, yes yes it's now official i'm trailer trash...well...for the most part anyway. we now have 5 cars in our yard, 3 of which don't work, 1 that's a complete piece of shit that only has one door that can be opened from the outside. we also have a van and a truck, both of which have HUUUUUUUUGE dents in them. the only good vehicle that we have is my brothers, it's a 2001 chev cavelier. seriously it fucking sucks! our yard has more shit in it then a grotesquely obese ass hole who tried to get high on Imodium, we used to have about 15 broken push mowers just sitting around in our yard, we have fucking fence posts all stacked up nice and neat because we don't fucking need them, we have so much shit that we have a shed dedicated to nothing else! it has the bikes my dad was going to rebuild in it but didn't, it's so bad that once when me and my brother were cleaning it out to throw away junk when my dad wasn't home w found a dead cat! a fucking dead cat in the shed!!! and not to mention our garage...i swaer my dad is a packrat. we have a fucking 30 year old toaster in there that he wants to "fix up" and some weird fucking huge black box thing that oes nothing, and our old 40 ear old riding lawn mower that was made by a company that doesn't even exist anymore, it only goes in reverse and 5th gear, it was quite fun actually, it didn't have one of those safetys that made it turn off when the driver gets off so you could put it in high gear jump off and race it. fuck and every year we have to go and clean out our garage **shudders** but that's another story entirely... -Matt

       Sundays Suck!   I hate sundays, absolutly can't stand them, even mondays aren't as bad because at least then i can see my friends. but sundays...there's nothing! at all! I know that you all don't care about wht i'm saying..well some of you do, some of you i'm sure are kind and compassionate people that care about every living thing, and then there are those other people that are probably only readig this to see if the person writing is worse off then you just so you can laugh at them. it's kinda sad that there are people out there that take joy from the suffering of others...but anywho, back to my random bitching. so i watched The Simpons today for the fist time in about 3 months, it was bullshit! yea it was sorta funny and everything but right at the end they started singing the Canadian national athem and they sung it freaking wrong!!!! seriously to me there's almost no bigger insult then fucking making fun of that song! i'm sure that they didn't mean it in that way, but still it's the song that every canadian knows and loves, little 6 year old school children can sing it, 100 year old grandfathers and grandmothers can sing it, it's one of the things that's makes a canadian, well, Canadian! I'm proud to be Canadian, atleast i'm not some fuckshit American whose got his head shoved way to far up his own ass that i can't see that the whole fucking world doesn't revolve arond me. Canada's got it great, we don't have the crime of other countries, we don't have the pollution (although yes i'm aware that canadians do make the most garbage in the world), we don't have the mass amount of wide spread poverty, we don't have the horrible health care of other countries, no over-population, no need to fear for our lives everyday, and no fascist dictator telling us how to live, most of all we don't have a stupid bull fucked president that wants to start a war with every country that doesn't see it his way. what a fucked up world this is, and with human nature the way it is, it can only get worse. -Matt

       blogging with myself!   ok ok maybe i should exsplain that other post from today...you see, i was in class at the time, com tech class to be exact, with nothing to do becasue the pressure washer was broken and had been taken in to get repaired. so i figured that i would post on here, that one was just a test to see if i could, and it went through, but for some reason the second one i tried to post didn't work...at all. needless to say i was pissed, it was really long and took a long time to do. but noooooooooooooo the fucking firewalls and shit didn't let me, so it's gone...all gone.....fuck! so rugby is in full swing now. our team merged with another one so we have more players now. it's great, i'm a flanker and i can outrun most of our wings, for those of you who don't know what i'm talking about, wings are pretty much the fastest players on the team. also i'm a jumper on the line outs, once again for those of you who don't know what i'm talking about, it means that when the ball goes out of bounds the two teams line up and i'm the one who gets picked up by his shorts and has to grab the ball in the air and get it to my other team mates. i get an atomic freaking wedgie everytime i do it and it's not fun when i forget to shift beforehand...i'm not explaining that one. one of the things i hate the most about rugby is the shorts, they are about 8 inchs long...as you can see they are craaaaaaaaaazy short, so short in fact that it was a agreed by the entire team that we all have to wear spandex underneath, all agree except for one little fat kid named kyle who decided he didn't need them cuz his shorts were tight enough, it's not a pleasent experience playing with him, specially since all he does in a game is talk and nothing else, he sucks at everything, and basically he's our bitch. you'd think we'd feel sorry for him or something, but you've never had to spend 10 minutes around this kid. it's so bad that h only played 3 plays on the foot ball team earlier this year. but hey, i don't care....as long as he doesn't piss me off i'm fine. -Matt

       tralalalalala  Woooo! This site got some attention. *giggles* don't worry Matt. I know people have lives and I do too (just I am choosing to ignore it again at the moment). I was just wondering when you would notice my bitching about the site. I don't seem to be doing a good job of blogging regularly either, but I seem to be able to usually blog every Sunday or so.    HAPPY 17th BIRTHDAY LOUIS!  Just needed to say that. *throws confetti around*  Anyway, back to my non-comprehensible mumbling. I noticed that I have been getting more and more depressed and sick as the weeks go by. No matter how hard I try though, I can never sleep enough to even be able to consider it a nap. I'm trying hard to make it so that I will be able to have a set bedtime. Since I have never had one before this is a really hard task for me. I always have to be doing something because I have so much to do. Promises to keep and people that I can't let down. I am never on the Internet anymore because I have so much else to do. The other night I spent most of my computer time typing out a story for a friend, but I haven't even been able to say hi to him once in the last 3 weeks. My chat time has gone down even more so then I had hoped. I know he will be mad at me because I am never on at the same time as him the few times I am online. If I don’t talk to him soon then I will just end up having to email him so he can post it for me instead. That is another thing too. When I don't have time to go on my messengers then I don’t have any time whatsoever to post. I just started posting for about 1 hour last week on this one forum, but didn't get a chance to post again even once since then. The days need more hours. That’s the only way I will be able to restart my life and not create an even bigger backlog by collapsing from exhaustion. Someone told me that it was great that I am living life to the fullest, but I don’t see how he can say that. Everyday I wake up makes life worse. I can't stand the fact that I never get any sleep. Friday I kind of went delusional and started talking in French to my mom telling her that my stomach felt bad and I felt like puking. Then I collapsed onto her bed and feel asleep until she woke me up and helped me downstairs to go back to sleep instead of going to school. I have so much to do and I try to finish it all quickly but I can't seem to be able to do anything fast anymore because I have been slowing down seeing as I never sleep. I know that the best thing for me to do now is buckle down and do nothing but work until I feel as if I am getting my life back together and then I can have fun. Although the most fun I have had in the last month is yesterday when I went to see x-men with my friends. I felt relaxed… more so then I have in a while. It really was the first time I was able to just not have to deal why anything and not feel like my stomach was about to rip apart and I was about to burst into tears. I even turned off my cell during the movie so that any unexpected things could wait till later. Somehow I even stopped myself from worrying and was able to have FUN! I could breath… I could even… really laugh… and not just pretend. Well I do laugh at anyone who says that they admire me for the fact that no matter what I am always smiling. The truth is it's either I smile or I burst into tears… and I can't stand the way I look when I cry so no point in crying. I haven't even figured out everything that is going wrong right now, but it does seem as though Murphy's law applies to me too. Maybe later when I am in a happy mood, I will figure out how to fix everything. Bah I'm not going to bother rereading this to see if I sound pathetic of not. No point since I doubt anybody will read this whole thing anyway. Woo I have faith in this site ^_^ - Dark Lily  0>--}----

       Holy Crap!   wow it's been a long time, i've been busy though what with finals and all. i realized that i truly hate chemistry, thus why i'm glad that i no longer have to concern myself with it ever again, although i'm pretty sure i failed that fucking course but i don't have to worry bout that til my test results come in in august. but now it's work full time, hurray! just what i needed. i got to sleep in today for the first time in like 2 months, let me tell you that there's nothing better then waking up at 2 to realize that it's gonna be a shitty day but then realizing it's half over. there's a new walmart coming up in fort saskatchewan which is a city near where i live, concidently it's near to a prison, right next to it actually. i find this rather funny, kinda like walmart is desperate enough to hire anybody. -Matt

       Fucking Carnies!!!!!!   So yesterday i went to K-days, which is a carnival that comes to edmonton every year and i was on this ride called Spin Out and i sat on my hat cuz i didn't want to lose it, but we went upside down and it started to slip, so i grabbed it and held on to it, i completely forgot that my wallet was in my back pocket and it was loose, after i got off the ride i realised that it was missing, so i went to the carni running the ride to see if they'd spotted it, of course they hadn't. bout an hour and a half later we came back and asked them again, this time they had it, but of course all the money was gone, i guess it's not that bad seeing as al the cards were all still there, but i know that fucking carni took the money they would've been the only ones that touched it, i was pissed but there was no way i could prove it, but i was absolutly amazed at one thing, when i was on the ride the guy right next to me grabbed my keys in mid-air it was sweet they just had fallen out of my pocket and BAM he grabbed them, i was damn lucky then i woulda been screwed without those keys.  -Matt

       Wow odd  Something is actually working on this site. I am updating with more then 2 words. Oddness I'd say. Well I'm bored and waiting for my pizza to arrive.  urlLink Panago  has by far the best pizza. I don't know how anyone can think of ordering from anywhere else. Other then maybe the fact that you have not ever heard of the place since I am pretty sure it is just a Canadian company and I'm also only is in 3 or 4 provinces. Ha to you unlucky other places! I am only rubbing it in because I'm hungry and need food.  Mmmmmm... so anyway, now that that's over with. I haven't done that much but visit Ohio, parts of Ontario and Montreal since school ended. After that all I've done is work. In Ontario I looked at Universities and I think that I might end up going East for school in a couple years. I hope so at least. I really need to get away from home.  -  Dark Lily  0>--}---

       Summertime fun   alright here's what you've been waiting for, fun things to chase away the summertime blues, all of these have been done by me or other people that i know.  -this one is kinda cruel so don't do it to anyone cept ppl you kinda hate, put Nair or some other hair removal chemical in a person's shampoo or conditioner. although i'd like to point out if it doesn't have enough time to work it won't do anything, it is slightly difficult to pull off but worth it in the end.  -take the tube that pours water back into a toilet tank(for the stupid among you, it's in the tank) and make it jut out slightly from under the lid, when someone flushes it'll spray them with water, this too is difficult for it to wprk properly, firstly for it to really work the person has to be sitting down while they flush.  -this one wasn't done by me, but you get ahold of some neutral red dye (can't remember the number of it) and put it in someone's drink, it doesn't break down in the digestive system so it goes out the same color. course you could just use tracer pills, that can change urin all sorts of different pretty colors for a few days, keep in mind they are just dye and completely harmless.   -lets put it this way, crickets are cheap, hard to find in a room, and annoying as fucking hell.  -Hold a magnifying glass over someone who is sunbathing, do keep inmind that you want to make sure you can outrun them before you try this.  -tie dying people is fun, take kool-aid powder and put it under the first set of bed sheets so they don't feel it, the sweat during the night will wetten it and take it into their pores, they stay colorful for quite some time.  -here's something else that i haven't done, but apperently if you put tin foil with draino and mix it with water all in a pop bottle it'll blow up something fierce.  have fun all you bored summer goers, and to all a good night. -Matt

       Summertime blues   wow working full time during the summer licks nuts! here i am thinking that all is great and i'd finally geta break, but fuck noooooooo. WHAM!! i'm slammed with an entire school that needs to be all cleaned up. i swear that once i'm done, i'll scream if i have to scrub another desk, actually i'm quitting soon so i'll never have to again. but then i've gotta find another job, and i've already ruled wal-mart cuz it's full of wack jobs and jerk offs. but that's soething to worry out later. you know, i never thought a mouse could scare me, it being only a fraction of my size. but it jumped out of a container of dog food in an explosion of kibbles and i almost pissed myself, cuz usually dog food doesn't explode. my next blog will be contributed to pranks that make summer ever so much more bareable, but i won't do it now just cuz i gots no time. -Matt

       Back to school   alright i know i haven't been blogging for a looooooooooong time, but i have reasons, i got that fucking blaster worm virus bull shit and it took me forever to figure it out, i felt fucking stupid after i did. so i'm starting grade twelve, or senior year or whatever all you ppl out there call you last year of school. it's an odd feeling really, happy & sad, excited & dreading. but all i'm really sure about is this is the year for havoc. did you know that if youput an inflated balloon into liquid nitrogen it completely condenses the air to nothing, and when it warms up again it inflats, now think what would happen if 1000s of balloons were inflated put in a cooler of liquid N2 and then dumped out into a large room? fun that's what! oh what a year it'll be greatness to be remembered.  -Matt

       Gimme a J! Gimme a D! what does that spell? NOTHING!!!   Alright this blog is dedicated to a little cheerleader out there named Chelsy (actually that’s not her real name, I don’t use ppls real names here, out of repsect for them, well cept for mine, and louis’ and natty’s….and errol’s but he’s a dumb little bastard and he knows it, anyways “chelsy will know who she is…hmmmmm maybe she won’t….she is like that after all) who keeps bothering me to do one of these on cheer leaders. She wanted me to be mean cuz apparently that’s when it’s funny, so any of my other cheerleading friends out there please don't be offended...what am i saying? All and any female over reacts about anything, even if it's all in good fun (yea i know i'll pay for that one). honestly high school cheer teams are just a joke, they don't do anything good and all their cheers are ripped off of other ppl. and not to mention they're completely useless, like if i want to cheer for a sports team it not the cheer leaders that make me do that (they do something completely different) it should be the talent of the team that makes people cheer. and it is. not some air headed chick making some attempt to appear graceful while they jump around and wave pom poms all over the place. at this point i'm taking back everythingi said and i'd like to remind you all i did this by request...you hear me? REQUEST! my life was in danger if i didn't. -Matt

       Quanzah! (that one's for you Errol)   I can complain all i damn well want miss lives-in-a-province-that-it-doesn't-really-even-get-cold-in here in Alberta we're used to cold weather! It's all climitisation (i'm not sure that's a real word, but it works), i'm not used to high temperatures. it's the same reason that someone from africa would be cold im 25 degree weather.  It's interesting what you think of at 2 in the morning when there's a huge storm out and you've nothing better to do, like what would happen if lightening hit my house? would it be loud? then i think...what if i got hit by lightening? wouldn't it be cool if i got super powers from it? imagine having the power to shot lightening from your hands! then i think about if i could shoot fireballs too....at this point i realise how fucking tired i am and that i should go to bed...hmmmm good idea. -Matt

       Well new stuff  I deleted that one blog about  urlLink nothing  the other day. It was the last blog I did, but Matt suggested I take it down... never actually did reread it after I wrote it so I have no idea what its about. I was on about 4 tylenols before that because my stomach hurt like a  urlLink bitch  and I was just pissed off at everything. For those you haven't noticed, I am just linking random sites because I think its fun. Hey when you are  urlLink bored  you go to lots of sites just for fun. I noticed that when typing in random words into a search  urlLink engine  you get lots of funky  urlLink results . Oh yes and Matt, 33 degrees isn't anything. Sure it's hot, but I've been through worse so  urlLink XP . Let's see... what else is new. Oh I have a boyfriend. Have been going out for about a week and a half. I'm leaving tomorrow to  urlLink Europe , so I won't be able to talk to him. I don't really care because he was being an  urlLink ass   urlLink yesterday  and would rather not talk to him right now. Some people can be so  urlLink pigheaded . He can get way too cocky for his own good. Whatever, it doesn't matter. I leave for Poland tomorrow. Woooo fun... well actually I really would rather stay home. Yes I know  urlLink family  lives there, but I don't know any of them so it's like visiting strangers. I have to spend over 20 hours on a plane, so I'm not too happy about that. Just because it is first class, doesn't make it any better. Then there is always the waiting in airport time doing nothing and waiting for other plane so I can finally switch over. I have to switch 3 times... wooo! And we  urlLink fly  into Berlin in the end, so if we leave for Poland right away, it's another 3 or 4 hour car ride to my mom's old house. I really am going to take something to  urlLink read . I have no idea how many  urlLink books  I will want to take, or if I will read them all anyway, but as long as I have something to do them I'm fine. Which reminds me that I have to burn all my cd's today so I can have  urlLink music  to listen to while I fly. My guess is that I will just sleep on the plane, but who knows really. After 2 weeks in Poland I head to Paris for a week. I'm hoping that turns out good. The only problem I have is that I miss the first 2 days of school and course changes and everything. So if my courses are screwed up, I have to phone home and see what I can do about them. I hate my mom for the fact that I get home about midnight home time and then the next day I go to school, jetlag and all. So much fun. I'm tired and need to go  urlLink eat  now so blog most likely in 3 weeks or so. Byeeeee! -  Dark Lily  0>--}---

       beat the heat!   Fuck! okay! i hate these fucking heat waves!! it was 33 fucking degrees celcius here!!!!!!! which is about..........90 Fahrenheit? anyways, it's not supposed to be that fucking hot!!! not in a place that gets to almost -40 in the winter at times!!!! i swear the heat fucking gets to your head too. like today, i had this thought that maybe if i smacked my head against the wall i would cool off, oh it seemed to work at first but it just wasn't worth the headache. i spent most of my day in my basement trying to mooch cold off of the cement floor. it's been like this almost for a week, but at least it's gonna be over soon, only 26 tomorrow and there be rain in the next couple days too. but now if you'll excuse me i'm about to dunk my head in a bucket of ice water and hope it stays numb long enough for me to sleep. -Matt

       What do you do with a drunken sailor?   ah yes! being young and stupid is great, actually no it isn't. after being violently ill after being just a little drunk (some people will probably want to disagree with that) i can truthfully say that drinking is stupid, i'm not built to drink 26oz of hard alcohol and half a litre of beer. surprisingly i wasn't hung over just really sick. but on an end note i'd just like to say don'y drink and drive, it's even more stupid then most things an american would do, do you want to be dumber then an american? didn't think so. -Matt

       Interesting Mojumbo   this is weird i got it in one of my many junk mail things and i thought it was cool.  Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn't mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoetnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be at the rghit pclae. The rset can be a total mses and you can sitll raed it wouthit porbelm. Tihs is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe.  it's weird how the human mind works. i sujest to everyone out there that they should take at least one psychology class, they're really amusing, and maybe if we all do then someone can figure out why most americans are so screwed up (don't worry i think in my next 5 blogs i'm gonna be taking shots at americans, all because of you Ori, and yes i'm a very spiteful bastard) -Matt

       Ignoramus Americanus   Alright, certain responses to my blogging have prompted what will undoubtively be a string of anti-american blogs. but i must point out at this point in time that it only discriminates to those americans who i deem ignorant or those that just piss me off (i say this because there are some americans that i know and like), specially some self righteous prig that comes to my PERSONAL webpage and accuses me of having a biassed opinion. i'm sorry but here i have a right to express mine opinion whether it be biassed or not (yes ori that's you if you couldn't tell). to top it off i'm accused of being biassed by an american on the subject of september 11th. now is it just me or doesn't it seem that no one could really be more biassed on this matter then an american, and one from southern USA in arizona, which is much to close to texas for my liking. i've had enough from whining sniviling americans that are freaking bitter that canada didn't do as it was told and join USA in the war. -Matt

       Because I'm evil...    I went to Poland for 2 weeks some time in August near the middle. Here is my email to people back home (6 pages of fun ^_^):   Hey everyone! How are you guys? I AM SOOOOO BORED! I haven’t been doing much but sitting around doing nothing. I am almost done my stay in Poland, been here way too long. I just found out that my uncle has a computer so I decided to come on here and type an email. When I go to my other uncle’s house then I can send and the email! Thank goodness they have disks. I’ve only got the chance to check my email I think twice since I came and even then it was only for a second because their internet doesn’t stay connected for too long and it’s really expensive apparently. So to those few that actually sent me an email thanks! I read a couple sentences of each before I got booted off so my mom could check her email. She spent almost double the time on that I did! Imagine that, a parent being a hypocrite.  Today I was sitting around bored and my uncle told me to follow him into a part of the house I didn’t even know existed and there was a computer! I had to spend about an hour hooking things up and finding the mouse and keyboard since they had it all put away so I wasn’t too happy about that, but hey a computer is a computer.  I wonder how long I can make this email before half of you stop reading out of boredom. Well I know its still summer and most of you are doing nothing since otherwise you wouldn’t have even opened this email and would be out somewhere with people, but you have chosen to read it this far and so I think I know which couple of you will be the only ones to not read this whole thing.  It’s been sooooo long since I said much in English. Well yesterday I did have to phone my brothers about my courses and all that and then my mom started to get mad since we had been on the phone for almost an hour. It’s not my fault that I needed to talk! Then I had to call Keren quick and my mom got mad over that too. I mean geez it was only a second. I haven’t said much in English here unless it’s been mumbled under my breath at someone, but I can’t even do that or they all look at me wondering and asking me what I’m saying. Nobody speaks it here. My mom even refuses to speak English to me under principle that since I’m here I have to learn how to speak in Polish. I have become a mute. I can understand almost everything they say to me so I don’t understand why they can’t at least learn some English and go half way like me. I refuse to speak Polish (even though I could) for several reasons. One is because I have a horrible accent and the other is because whenever I say anything whatsoever in Polish all they do is start to coo and act all surprised that I can say anything, then it become a huge topic of discussion for them and they forget even what I said to begin with, so they make me repeat it over and over to make sure they heard me. I feel like a baby, they get all excited over everything I say. Plus I have only 3 more days here before I head off to Paris ^_^ So it doesn’t really matter if I learn or not. There I’ll be able to speak French at least and then my mom will be the one suffering, hey what goes around comes around. XP My mom commented to me yesterday as to why I hadn’t really bonded with more then just about one of my cousins. I pointed out to her that just because we are family doesn’t mean I have to get along with any of them or even like them. She got all shocked and mad that I would say such horrible things about my own blood as she says, but I told her it was true. How can you bond with people you have only known for about 2 weeks and that don’t even speak the same language as you? Plus a couple of them annoy me. One is about 12 and just giggles, smiles and stares at me the whole time. For the first minute it was cute, but it’s not when it doesn’t stop! Then she started picking out random things for me to translate for her. Like she would say “lody” and I would say “ice cream”. After that it would be “wolne” and I would say “slow”. After that she would get me to say bike (which no matter what I say, she repeats beaké) also words like book, boyfriend, cards and car. So after those couple words all she does is repeat them over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over… and then sit giggling while she asks me to say it again for her. After I repeat it all she would do is say it again and again while giggling like crazy. She then started to follow me around asking to go on a beaké ride or play cards every two seconds. Also every day she would come to see what I am wearing and then would go home to change and match me. She even managed to find a necklace almost identical to the flower one I wear all the time. Then my mom wonders why me and all my other cousins find her annoying as hell.  It’s really amusing how here my mom has to yell at me in English instead of Polish like she usually does at home, so here if I get her mad then she forgets to speak in Polish for a while and I can have a conversation with her in English. Not like I do that purposely or anything…. Really… that would just be very evil and I’m not like that. ^_~ Did you know that in Polish, Minesweeper is Saper? Didn’t think so, not very interesting, but I’m bored and am just trying to see which programs I recognize on here. I have the high scores on all 3 of the levels! Wooooo I am so bored… I’ve been dragged to see about everyone here that my mom used to know. She has more family and friends here then I care to even know about. All I do is stand and say hi and then they all give kisses and hugs and then leave me to sit with my tea as they talk for hours. I’m like the puppy my mom brings everywhere just to show people that she has me then she forgets that I’m bored to death and would rather be doing anything else then listen to her talk to someone I have never even heard of before. The thing I hate the most out of these visits is that whenever you go to see someone they all give you hugs and kisses on the cheeks no matter who it is that you are meeting. It’s a hug and 3 kisses, some people even try to kiss you on the lips, but I’d rather not be kissing old men and ladies like that. I’m forced to do it too again before I leave. You get so much lipstick on your cheeks at the end of the day that just won’t come off. Old ladies wear the ugliest shades that stick to your skin forever.  Tomorrow apparently we are going to visit another of my mom’s “bestest” of best friends from 25 years ago. She is making me come along because this chick has a daughter my age and according to my mom, she is fluent in English. I find that highly doubtful since everyone here that has taken English classes can only say a couple words and then they are done with all they know.  Yesterday we came back from a 2 day visit to Krakow and some other places. We left on Thursday around 6 am and then got to Auschwitz at about 2 pm to go tour around there. Auschwitz was one of the biggest death camps during WWII and so my mom wanted to show me that. It was pretty interesting, but very much depressing to look at all the belongings of people that were murdered in the gas chambers. Also they showed us all the cells where people slept and bathed, plus the hair of women that was kept to make blankets and all sorts of other things. After 3 hours of that it was another 3 driving back to Krakow where we were staying at my aunt’s cousin’s grandparents’ house. Then the next day we woke up early and went to some Salt Mine. It was all really brown salt figures, nothing like the nice shiny walls that you would imagine. Kind of very much boring and not worth getting up early for to walk for hours with some tour guide that didn’t really seem like she was enjoying it. After that we had to go into Krakow which is some really really really old city in Poland that used to be the capitol at one time so we could go visit some plain summer houses of old kings I had never heard of. I really wasn’t too happy after that and annoyed my mom by taking pictures of her every second that I got. She asked me to take pictures so I did! Wasn’t my fault it was just to annoy her and now she has a billion ugly pictures of her not doing much but say running away from me. Then we drove for the rest of the day home in the blazing heat (nobody seems to realize the value of an air conditioner here). We finally got home about 8 hours later. I don’t see how it really should take that long other then the fact that they have such crappy roads here and none at all are ever going directly to where you want to go. They all seem to veer off about 500 km from your final destination. Plus its hell when you get stuck behind some truck and can’t pass because all there roads have only one lane and curvy. You feel like a sardine in there cars because they are sooo small and cramped. A bike could probably split these things in half if the two collided.  Hmmmmm… what else have I done here? I have no idea. Well I sat around for 2 days doing nothing really at all. Oh! I finished LotR finally! (People who haven’t finished the series and don’t want to know what happens skip the next part, spoilers!) I haven’t read at all since Japan and so coming here and doing nothing was a real motivator. I even read most of the appendixes, I’m saving 2 of them for the plane to Paris otherwise I’m screwed with nothing to do on the way. I remember that I was stuck bored in the middle of the second book so I finished that and went on to the third. I think that one was the best book since things actually happened! They weren’t just sitting around and dreading having to finally finish the whole quest. Maybe it was just that I don’t really remember the other books since it’s been a while, but still the fighting is always the best part.  Frodo is such a whiner. (Yes I know so am I too… shut up) I really have no idea why he is the main one since he really doesn’t do much but complain. I didn’t actually see why Shanny liked Sam so much until the end. Although I still don’t see how she thinks he’s attractive, he may be a cool character… just not really good looking. I mean Sam could have finished the whole thing on his own and would have been fine. Sam acts like too much of a puppy most of the time, but in the end he is one of the best characters because you know that he could have actually succeeded in getting rid of the ring, unlike Frodo who we all knew was doomed and weak enough to succumb to the ring’s power. At least Frodo was smart enough not to kill Sméagol; otherwise it all would have been pointless. Though I think Tolkien just had to make it that way or the end wouldn’t have worked out… so really Frodo is just dumb and shouldn’t have been in the story. Sorry to those who actually like him, I’m just ranting so don’t mind me.  The only thing I didn’t like at all about the third book is that there wasn’t much of Gimli and Legolas! Gimli is just such a softy really that’s what makes him adorable since he is a dwarf and supposed to be this really tough macho type creature. Legolas is by far the best since first off he is an elf and that is enough on its own (hey that’s why Arwen is up there in my books, well that and she’s married to Aragorn, who is the sexiest ranger. Oh but I don’t much care for Galadriel, no idea why, but she just bugs me) and also Legolas is played by none other then Orlando Bloom! What more would you ask for?! Hey that’s why Pirates of the Caribbean was good; I didn’t really pay attention to much else there. Ok so Johnny Depp was good in that too, but Bloom was better by principal.  There is this really cool French song that they keep playing but I have no idea who it’s by or what the name is… but I get the beat stuck in my head all day. Just the beat since I’m too lazy to actually listen to the words. The music video for it was really odd, she was in a glass box and sometimes it was raining and other times she was just singing in the box moving around. It’s on now and now I know I’ll get it stuck in my head all night.  Oh well back to complaining about LotR! Well not complaining so much as randomly saying stuff about it. Actually I lost my whole train of thought when I stopped to listen to that song and now I have no idea what the heck I was going to say. I was sad when Gandalf left. He shouldn’t have left middle earth! He wasn’t going to be there ever again if any of the other hobbits needed him. It was good though when Sam got to be the mayor for so long, I think that was in the appendix and not the book. Sam is pretty good at picking names for his kids. But holy cow, 13 kids! What other hobbit has 13 kids!? That is a bit too much. Merry and Pippin had to be the 2 cutest things in the whole story. Though I’m pretty sure out of everyone, they had the most fun and still managed to do great things. I feel bad for Pippin since he caused lots of trouble and didn’t exactly do as much as Merry did to save the world, but still he did have the best of adventures.  I wrote about a page about LotR already so I think I’ll finish it up since that is way too much already. Oh but I just have to say that actually what made the book good was that in the end they said what happened to everyone in the whole company and also that whole saving the Shire chapter was cool. Four hobbits to the rescue!  Um well… I’m bored, so I’m going to see what people are up to here.  Argh, it is now Monday morning around 1 am, last time I wrote was sometime Saturday morning I think. My uncle that has internet decided to go away for the weekend so I hope that I will be able to send thing sometime after I go to sleep otherwise none of you will have the joy of reading this overly long pointless email about nothing in particular that most of you haven’t even bothered to read a week after you got it.  Yuck one of my cousins is now smoking in the room next to me. It’s a really disgusting habit that all of them here seem to have. My uncle just came up and told her that she’s an idiot for smoking, which I agree with, but didn’t make her stop since she’s 22 and he said she should be old enough not to be stupid like that. Some reason they all enjoy smoking here. The cousins that I hang around with all do. The only 2 that don’t are the little annoying one and this one chick that went away with her boyfriend for almost the whole time I have been here.  The first 3 days I was here all I did was cough since I wasn’t used to all this smoke. It was really bad for a while and they thought I was getting a cold, but I knew it was that stupid smoke. Thankfully I guess would be the word that I got used to it enough to be able to tolerate it because the day after I stopped coughing we went to a disco. All the clubs are full of smoke and I know if I wasn’t used to it I would have died. It was pretty fun. Three of my cousins took me and they brought along one of there cousins along. Polish people are all drunks, even if they are young I swear. The legal age for drinking here is 18 and they are all legal, but still they were telling me stories (well as much as I could understand) about when they were younger and drinking and then going out to clubs. Two of my cousins are twins, boy and a girl, they are both attached, but both managed to hook up with a couple people that night. I don’t think that the guy cousin remembered anything though since he was so out of it, but the next day his girlfriend of 5 years came over and was sort of pissed since she found out he had gone. I found that sort of amusing. All of them have boyfriends or girlfriends and they all have for about 2 years or more, it’s crazy. At the disco, the cousin that is closest to my age and I spend the most time with was a good boy and babysat me really the whole time, making sure that no scary Polish guys came and attacked me. I was happy to see that at least one of them could remain faithful, but it could have been also that he didn’t drink since he was stuck driving us. We left an hour before closing at about 5 am. The oddest thing that happened was that at about 1 am a stripper came out. Her name was Karolina, same name as my neighbor, only those who have ever seen or heard stories about my neighbor will know why I laughed when I found that out. Don’t ask me why there was a stripper. All I know was that the guys were slightly happier after and there was a longer line up for the washrooms. *shudder*   Wow I’m almost done my 4th page about nothing. I’m not even going to bother rereading all of that so you are stuck with all my spelling mistakes and whatnot so XP I only have one day left now in Poland and then Tuesday I am off to Paris! Woooo getting really excited for another 4 hour car ride and then I think 2 planes rides just because my mom is so great at booking flights that I can never have a direct flight anywhere.  Tomorrow shouldn’t be too bad, except I need to wake up earlier so I can go have coffee and meet one of my mom’s friends for some pointless reason. The only part I like is that we are going to Poznan and my mom feels bad about making me come along meeting all her unimportant friends so she is buying me off and I get to shop. Mwahahahaha! I’ve already bought some pretty cool things. I got these curly long earrings; some really funky long blue sock type things that I have no idea where I will wear since the color doesn’t go with anything I own, but they were cool so I got them; these whitish bluish pants that have pink lines on them; and then a couple shirts that I think are sweet. My mom said that she saw this ring that has a lily in the middle and this really funky 80’s type bracelet that has circles and squares both which she thinks I might like. Tomorrow I get to pick which one I want, I’m sort of undecided. It depends on my mood I guess. Plus I really need to find an English book of some sort since I finished all 4 that I brought after a week of being here. That probably is why this email is as long as it is already. If I had something better to do then I would be doing that instead.  I’m actually very happy at the moment since I just realized that I might be able to actually have twins like I wanted when I’m older. Well at least there is a bigger possibility then I thought before. I know that I have a set of twin cousins and my mom has two set of twin cousins both on either side of her family. Plus my grandpa had twin brothers. My dad never talks about his family so I have no idea what is going on there. All I know is that my mom really wanted twins and was sad that she never had any. All I need now is to marry a guy that has twins in his family and I’m set! ;) Actually it really doesn’t matter if that happens or not, I just think it would be easier to have twins so then you have 2 kids over and done with right away. Yes, me being incredibly lazy has something to do with this idea. I did get to speak some English today though! That just added to my happiness. That chick that my mom made me see whose daughter knew English actually did speak English! We talked for about 4 hours and then I had to leave. It was fun since I hadn’t got to speak that much in a while and she also had stuff to say since she never gets to practice. She’s pretty cute and I was really surprised when she told me she was 18 since she looks so much younger. Not that I even look 17, but still she looked as if she had just turned 16 just a while ago. According to my mom, she might be coming next summer for 3 weeks with her mom. I have no idea how that’s going to work out since even though she supposed to be coming in July, I most likely will be really busy since I’m planning to go somewhere hopefully, moving or road trip or even vacationing somewhere interesting.  I’m dreading this last year of high school. It has all been way too long and useless already. I hope that this year won’t be too much work. I have enough to think about as it is. I still need to figure out what the heck I’m going to write for my essay to get into that program I want. It has to be really good otherwise I won’t make it and then I’m stuck since the only plan I have after is trying to get into UBC or maybe still go out east, who knows. I still have no idea where I will go if I don’t make it right away. I haven’t even fully decided what I’m going to take in University either. This is way too much stuff to have to think about right now. Even though I should be since I have the time at the moment. One night I was sitting around and for some reason was feeling really creative and then I thought up my prom dress. I have it all sketched out, it’s really cute. I hope I can find the stuff I need for it. All I can say is that obviously it will have some blue on it, since that’s all I wear, but *gasp* it will be white too! Wow I’m actually going to have other colors, even though white isn’t considered a color, but it’s more of a shade. Whatever it’s still different. My grad blurb came to me too. In about 5 minutes I wrote it out. Its basically finished just I’m not sure how long I’m allowed to make it so I know some of it might have to be reworded. So Keren please tell me how many characters I’m allowed to have. I’m really happy that I at least have those 2 things for the most part covered because I was really worried that I would get neither done and then end up having said something stupid in the yearbook and spend lots of time thinking up a dress for prom.  Heehee, my mom just called me stuck up. She said I gave her my look and so that makes me stuck up. It’s not my fault that when she says something stupid I make it known to her. I laughed since I told her that I only do it when that person is annoying me and she didn’t get it for a while. Then she got mad at me for being all bitchy. Its 2 am, I’m allowed to be bitchy. Everyone here is up still and all of courses drinking as much as humanly possible, so there is no way I will be able to fall asleep with all this noise now.  I think that’s all for today. Well now it’s Monday and about 7:30 pm. Tomorrow I get to wake up at 4 and leave for Berlin! Woo aren’t we all excited. Well actually I had a pretty good day. We went into Poznan, the big city 15 minutes away and I got to walk around it for hours while my mom had coffee with girl friends. I went to some book store and bought English and French books. The French one was pretty cheap so that’s why I bought it. All the English books there were so incredibly expensive. Well only because I barely had any money to spend. My mom got me the lily ring! Actually when I came back from buying the books she gave it to me. I didn’t even get to pick, but it’s a cute ring so I’m not complaining. It looks a bit like Keren’s ring now that I think of it. I hope she doesn’t get mad. My mom picked it not me!  I miss everyone and hope that all is well. Someone please email me! I actually can’t believe how much I’ve written. My mom was thinking that I had started writing a book since I have been at the computer so much in the last little while. That would be a neat idea though; on vacation and writing a book. That would be fun to be in Paris writing just so I could tell people that I wrote my book in Paris! But knowing me I wouldn’t finish and all I would end up with is random ideas spread up on a couple hundred pages that really aren’t linked together whatsoever expect maybe that they are all written in my poor handwriting and have no real point at all. Writing a book for me would mean that I actually have to focus on one main plot and what’s the fun in that? If I get the inspiration then I will, for now I’ll stick to overly long emails.  I think I might be done. Six pages is even a bit too much for me. Plus I actually want to spend time with people before I leave. In fact, it will be sad to leave since the most important person for me here is my grandpa and somehow I doubt I will ever see him again. He used to come and visit, but then he got too old to make the trip. I know that I won’t be coming back here any time in the near future. Another ten years at least, so I have a gut feeling that he wont stick around until next time.  Anyway, miss all of you!  Have fun without me. But not too much fun :P   P.S. Ori I know you are at work and bored out of your mind, that’s why I’m sending this to that address, but if you can, can you please send this to Shanny too? I didn’t ever add her new email address into my contacts so I don’t have it and I really wanted to ask her what Duo said exactly since I’m pretty sure she will remember word for word. I had to leave quickly that one day I saw her and didn’t get a chance after to ask. So please email this to her since I want a full description! Plus wooo I have all 3 now XP *gloats* ps2, gamecube and xbox. I love my brothers for there lack of saving money skills. My brother told me that Shannon looked jealous when he was buying it in EB since she commented that now we have all 3. mwahahahahah. Gamecube still is the best no matter what.    and there you have the load of crap I wrote   - Dark Lily 0>--}---

       Midnight Toker   I always find it funny when people don't know what that is, but then again some people are really sheltered. but really, when someone doesn't know what macking it means, or various other things that should be common knowledge by now, it makes you wonder what rock they were under. you have to wonder what their parents were thinking, like honestly, if you cut off your kid from absolutely everything that's inappropriate, shit you're just setting them up to be worse off, it's better that they know about it and how to deal with it then it all hitting them at once, take guns for example, people who live out in the country live with guns their whole life, they know how to use them, they know what to do with them, how often do you hear about a hunting accident with country people? now you get some yuppy from the city was sheltered by his parents his whole life and goes out to hunt and shoots everythig that moves. then there's young children that are sheltered from swearing and violence and then they go to school and everyone else is swearing and they start swearing more then anyone else. i;ve seen that happen there's this little kid in my neighbourhoodwho was so sheltered it wasn't even funny, and now he swears more then i do when i crank my skull on a steel pipe (that fucking really hurts). i think people should let their kids know about all this stuff but teach them to do what's right, not try and protect them from it, there's no way to keep from them their whole life....short of locking them up til they die, but where would we get with that? -Matt

       the confession   this blog is more of a confession to clear the good name (actually it isn't very good, he's a lying little bastard but i'll give him this much) of one of my friends. it's seems that one of the teachers in my school is really possesive of his tv set in his room, in fact he doesn't like it at all when it's moved. all i'm saying is that happy death lives! -Matt

       Kaboom stick   so another 9/11 has come and gone, whoopee do! and another day where everyone remebers those that perished. alright, now fir fuck sakes it pisses me off, why the fucking hell is there a day to comemerate the people that died. at a risk of offending my american friends, but i have to say that what they are doing is stupid, for fucks sakes the only reason they care is because it's americans. you don't see a day dedicated to the jews that died during world war 2. you don't see a day where they remember all those peple in africa died from starvation. but 9/11 i special, it's when the americans died, because we all know that nothing else matters more then the americans. it pisses me off even more that they are concidering building a huge glass structure where the two towers were, that will light up every september 11th. it's a fucking waste, spend that money to help someone else.  -Matt

       donkey hopper   yea i don't know what's with the title either, sometimes i wonder what i'm thinking. then i stop caring. so i found out something amusing, go to www.google.com and type in weapons of mass destruction, then click on i'm feeling lucky. it's great! yes so today in my social studies class, or history or whatever you wierd fuckers out there call it, i found out that i'm a communist, we had to fill out this survey about which values we agreed with, and lo and behold! i was the most communist person in the class. it's an interesting thing to know. i have come to the conclusion that football has to be about the gayest sport there is, and not to mention boring. they hutt the ball and the play will last like 10 seconds tops and they stop again, it's like a minute of waiting for just the fucking 10 seconds of play, and that happens the whole game. fuck even golf is more exciting! now rugby is a real man's sport! so sissy pads, no stopping, no nothing! only thing that stops it is blood. ok well other things do too but not when the ball is dropped. and hockey is great too, but i think that's cuz i'm canadian and it's naturla for me to like it. i'd like to end this with saying Errol is a stupid bastard! he knows it! jk man! -Matt

       Spooky delight!   As all of you know, tomorrow is halloween. and as some of you may know i hate halloween. it's a completely useless day of the fucking year! seriously, it's only for young kids, it pisses me off to see people my age that still go out trick or treating...seriously grow the fuck up! i swear this year if i see anyone my age come to my house i'm gonna dump a bucket of water on them and then slap them! and those little punk shits that try to egg my house will get it too, little fuckers! on another note, i discovered that web forums are very addictive. i can truthfully say that me not blogging can fully be blamed on the fact that i got hooked on them. but it crashed so here i am my little pretties, back and bigger then ever to blog to my hearts content. on that note...good night! -Matt

       Ba ba black sheep   it's been much too long since i last blogged, been busy though. but i've come up with a theory though, about mob mentality. i think that anyone would do anything so long as someone else did it first.  Seriously, everyone has the capacity to absolutly anything, be it stupid or smart. i would make a better agument for this but.....i'm tired cold and hungry and don't feel like it. maybe next time. -Matt p.s. i don't really care about the bashing americans anymore, i got bored of it

       Special Thanks   You know...i've had this blog for over a year now and i have yet to thank all those special people out there that make happy death what it is and made me who i am. so, firstly i'd like to thank natty, whil she's no longer here she added much to this site. nextly, i'd like to thank all my friends and family who might have played some sort of role develloping me into the cynical sarcastic little bastard that i am. thirdly, bravenet, for all the little doodads that i just had to copy paste all the coding into here and not actually have to work at it. fourthly, the internet, for allowing me to access this site and post online to potentially millions of people (HAH!). fifthly, blogger, for your easy pick and go templates that gave me all the basics for this site that i could tinker around with. lastly, myself, lets face it...i'm here because of me, i do most of the work, i create the ideas, i write them down...so it boils down to this, it's all me fuck you guys i'm the best and you can all go suck yourselves. nah just messing, thanks all, you're all great, specially my loyal readers...you know who you are! -Matt

       Ageism: a pox on society   alright, so i haven't blogged in a while...i blame web comics! and the fact that i barrowed my friend's Xbox and have been Halo alot recently (i highly recomend it, it's truly a game among games). anyway, to the point. i recently read my school's newspaper and i saw an article written by a kid in grade 8 about the belief that the younger students in the school are abused by the older (my school being one that goes from grade 7 to 12). while i somewhat agree that this does happen, i can fully argue that the young do nothing but cause problems for the old. so i figured i'd write i reply to this...HAPPYDEATH STYLE!!!!  (now i'm not sure that i'd send this into the paper actually i know i won't because i'll be swearing and they wouldn't use it) stupid little shits they have no right to complain about what they have to put up with. i mean for fuck sakes there's almost no week that goes by that the little fuck wits don't throw an assortment of puddings, sandwiches, and any other food stuffs they can get their grubby little hands on. then there's the fact that they contribute to about 80% of the mess in the school ( i know because i'm one of the janitor and i keep tabs). and as for the pushing them around thing...kinda hard not to when they're running full tilt in a crowded hall way and trying to find short cuts and BAM they collide, face to knee and fall down. you know i'd write more but i'm not in the mood. i need to think more on this. -Matt

       Dirty old man goat sex   Now that i've got you attention, I'd like to point out something that I find very very disturbing. As most of you can see i have a counter, and well if anyone (like me) clicks on it they can look at all the stats. one of the things you can access is recent visitors where it gives all sorts of information about the 10 last visitors to the site. well a few times that i was perusing though there i checked where some of my readers were coming from and on more then one occassion i'd find a link that was someone searching for something along the lines of "kinky dog sex" or "kiddy rape" or some such fucking perverted thing. but then...it hit me if i (blow job, XXX, sex, 69) put random (anal, ass, tits) sexual words up (sex sex sex) i can (i'm only putting sex now because small children can access this site) get more people to come to this site. but then i figure that i really shouldn't beacuse those people won't really read my site, they're just there to get their jollies off. and that would make me a hit slut and then years down the road i'll feel all empty inside for just appealing to meaningless readers that meant nothing to me. instead i should just try to get meaningful readers that i can have deep reader writer relationship. that's a lesson for all of you out there. skip the clap! wear a cap! -Matt

       Heehee hey Matt!  Sorry for not telling you sooner Matt, I knew the counters would lead you. You are one of those people that have to check how everyone came to your site. I knew after putting up the link that if anyone actually came to my site they would try my links and then you would be led back. You did a really good job on HappyDeath and made everything how you wanted it to be, it’s always been your blog more than mine. Not many people I know ever actually come to see my blogs so I really never cared to write anything because I knew your friends really wouldn't have wanted to see what I had to say since they had no idea who I was in the first place. I know what you meant about my blogs being personal, but I guess that’s why it really didn’t matter to me whether it was up there or not, since nobody I know comes to visit and they wouldn’t see what I said.  I should have told you sooner and I was going to as soon as I actually made my blog look somewhat nice. Right now its just randomly set up since whenever I play with the code it always screws up. I managed to screw everything up one time so bad that the whole page went down for a while. Going back and going through everything to see what went wrong is not fun whatsoever. So if you ever have time to help me with code for my blog I would highly appreciate it ^_~ My blog will probably always end up looking like crap since I’m way to impatient and html stupid to figure out how to get things all pretty like.  Thanks for letting me blog with you for so long. July 30th was HappyDeath’s one year! I came in on August 1st, 2002 and I guess my official depart will be today, although if Matt lets me I hope to come and post random blogging from time to time.  -  Dark Lily  0>--}---

       Three cheers for being observant   Get this, Natty (dark lily) hasn't been on this site for almost two months, she left and started her own. man i really need to pay more attention to what's going on. oh well it's all me here now unless for some reason she decides to post here because she still can. I put the link up on the left with all the other ones it's pretty decent, i mean it's no Happy Death but it's good. AND! for your information natty (had to say this, couldn't help it) i didn't complain about your blogs being to personal, i merely asked you if you really wanted them there where the people you mention in them could read them. it's not complaining when i do that, it's making you think it over. Jeez! but now i leave for i want to make me some bacon n' eggs. enjoy! -Matt

       Internet: gotta love it   As I sit here listening to Black jesus by Everlast while reading the goats webcomic (it's really damn good i recommend going there, i put the link up today) i realize that i love the internet, lets face it, if it wasn't for the internet i wouldn't be here reading comics and writing blogs and listening to music, and you wouldn't be here reading about me reading webcomics and writing blags and listening to good music (this could go on a long time if i really wanted it to). But seriously though, i think that despite the inevitable downside of the internet it has benifited the world. I'd never talked to someone from Australia or keep in touch with my friend from the USA without it. It makes seemingly unsurpassable distances close with the click of a mouse or a tap of fingers on the keyboard. there are whole communities online and a community for every interest imaginable, with the internet no one needs to feel rejected, no one judges race, religion or culture. everyone can be equal. Buuuuuuuuuuuut...then i realize that there's life out there besides in this little box infront of me and that if you're reading this i have advice for you, go outside. with all the technology now few truly appreciate the perfection of nature, there's a fine line between healthy harmless net use and net addict. -Matt

       A Hobbit's Tale: Happy Death Style   Alright, so i went to see the last installment of The Lord of the Rings yesterday and before i go any further i'm just going to comment on how freaking awsome that damn movie was. seriously it was freaking sweet, see it today! but to the point, i just had the sudden urge to make fun of all those people that dress up for movie...seriously, what the hell is the point other then stating "i'm a huge fucking geek". do the pointy elf ears help you hear better? NO! does wearing a stormtrooper outfit help you see the picture better? NO! Does wearing the princess Leia golden Bikini make the movie more enjoyable...well...ok...seeing some hot person wearing it does...but other then that there's no reason to do it. "Weeeeeee! lets dress up and spend however many hours getting ready to go sit in the dark watching a movie where no one will notice anything we took time to make other then to laugh and make fun of us and then go home after the movie is done and take it off." yep there's a point alright. Idiots! -Matt P.S. Natty will kill me for this one

       Christmas is in the air! And it smells like rotten egg nog   Man you got to love the exploitation of Christmas. I was at West Edmonton Mall yesterday (the worlds biggest mall, it has all the stores in a rainbow, sometimes two, and in certain cases 4 or 5) but as I was walking along I saw a real live reindeer, santa's reindeer at that! And for a mere 10$ you could have your picture taken with it. Like if that's not a great deal I don't know what is? Course there's always pictures with Santa that can cost anywhere from 10 to 60$. Alright enough of that back to my other bitchings. As I was sitting down to rest my feet, because that fucking mall is huge and you spend more time walking to a store then you do in it, but as I was sitting there I noticed some punk dressed people walking by and very loudly mocking the "trendy" people. Alright, so what? I make fun of them too. But then they go as far as to say that they should try to be more original like them. Alright? They're ORIGINAL by dressing punk? Wouldn't original mean that they'd be dressed like nobody else is? Did the millions upon millions of other people that dress punk just disappear? What a strange phenomena that is? Like an entire group disappearing so these people could be original, or an entire "trend" I should say because that's really what punk is, it's just another fucking trend, no matter what your style is you aren't fucking original unless you made the fucking thing yourself by hand and no one else on the entire fucking planet looks the same as you. So any goths or punks or skaters, preps, or cowboys out there who think they are fucking original go shove it because seriously you aren't, you just copying millions of other people out there who did it before you. And for you people out there that say you dress the way you do to rebel against pop culture and the "machine" that is society go fuck yourselves, that only works when the trend first appears, not decades later when no one really fucking cares anymore. You want to know what kind of statement people should make when they wear clothing, comfortability, not fucking huge ass bling bling (those big chains and medallions that people where), no fucking spikes, fuck high heels and ties, fuck dress shoes and suits, fuck corsets and every fucking thing that's uncomfortable! God damn it why does everything that you "should" wear to impress have to be uncomfortable? fuck everything! Next time I go for an interview I'm showing up in sweats! I'm never fucking working someplace that won't let me be comfortable on the job! I just realized that this is probably the longest blog I've written in a long time...I do get carried away when I start to bitch. I'm all blown out of steam now. -Matt

       Eye for an eye   As i told you before, it was a drink for a drink and now it's blood for blood. nextly, it's frère fool! not fraire! if you're gonna use a different language do it right dammit!   Anyways, i just got through 24 hours of having no e-mail and no messenger. i tell you it's torture, specially on a day where it's cold and snowy and i'm the only person at home with nowhere to go. on the plus side i did discover the greatness that is the movie "Killer Klowns from Outer Space" seriously a kick ass movie! cheezy to the core but the Chiodo (sounds almost like Kyoto) brother did a brilliant job of creating a film that's almost as old as me. seriously everyone must see this film. you won't regret it!  -Matt

       Indeed........   ah yes, the recycled carbonated beverages. Now I must admit that was a Grade A prank, but to reply to that, I didn't even drink any other than the shit that coated my mouth, once I realized how much it tasted like ass I spit it back into the bottle capped it, and then proceeded to throw it at Matt's face. I got him in the mouth and made him bleed.....A fitting response to a little fucktard like him........... touche mon fraire.  -Errol

       Out of the oven and into the deep freeze   I swear this past week was the freaking coldest I can remember. At one point it had gotten down to -45 degrees without the wind. I guess it would be all that bad if it was always cold, like you'd eventually adjust to the weather and it wouldn't seem so bad after a while. but no! we have to have a freaking summer where it got up to 33 degrees during the day, and then after that we get a freaking winter where at night it got down to -45...that's a 88 degree difference! it's so annoying, the temperture varies so much here it's not even funny, i tell you Alberta's got the most messed up weather anywhere.it can rain one minute and then be clear the next. snow one second and then melt away in an instant. bloody alberta weather. blast it! -Matt

       Recycled Revenge   Revenge is a dish best served cold...or in this case luke warm right Errol? Let me elaborate, but first you need some background on the reason behind the prank...  (queue flash back music) it was a warm September evening back in 2003, unusually warm for that time of year when the leaves change to different shades of orange, yellow, and red. Boredom ran amuck, and in a small Albertan town there is little to do. That fateful evening will live forever in infamy. it had been planned for some time, while the exact details of the night were ever changing, the basic idea of the night was always the same...get loaded. as i look back upon it now i realize that i had forgotten one very important thing, when you drink you get drunk, and when you get drunk you lose the ability to think. that being said, i now go back to the situation. i had had a few drinks already, and was finding walking to be difficult so i had Errol mix my next drink...i think he said later on the it was 3/4 rum and rye and 1/4 coke (it could be different but i'm not sure). Needless to say, it tasted like something you would scrape off the bottom of your shoe. Then i was convinced by a certain dip shit that i should drink it really fast so i wouldn't have to taste it...big mistake, things got a little hazy after that...well after the next drink that someone else made me, once again the fast drinking came into play.  (return to the present)  I bided my time, waiting for the moment to strike. the time came yesterday, after a long time since the incident i had hoped he had forgotten my vow of revenge, and he did. What did i do you ask? well i was at school being bored, and the perfect prank hit me. (after some inspiration from other people) i went around my school to all the recyling bins and took all the pop bottles that had any amount of pop in them and poured it all into 2 bottles (2 because i was hoping i could get someone else at the same time). He drank it, but me being me i couldnt let him drink more then that first drink. but the payback was complete, indeed wasn't it errol? en garde! -Matt

       I hate kids, plain and simple.   so here I am, trying to sleep in on this beautifully cold friday morning and i'm roused by the shrill shriek of 5 year old girls. the neighbours are all at my house getting hair cuts and well, they HAVE TO BRING THEIR FUCKING KIDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  so now i'm obligted to be nice to them, which I don't have too much of a problem with, the boys are cool, they're quiet and they're content to sit and play with my collection of ninja turtles. speaking of the turtles, i actually just gave most of mine away, my neighbour likes them so much and he had never seen or heard of them, I felt duty-bound to give them to him so that he can experience the full, happy childhood that I had...........what a crock of shit, childhood blew as much ass as daytime talk shows.  but goddamnit, these girls are going through my vast collection of lego and they're re-arranging it so they can make a HOUSE!!!!! A FUCKING HOUSE!!!!!!! I don't have those legos, all i'vw got is castle, space and wild west, everybody is a cold-blooded killer with plenty of guns, but THEY have to make a FUCKING HOUSE!!!!! godamnit, and theyr'e making these shitty horse sounds and I wanna snap!!!!!!!!!!  -Errol

       The joys of boredom   here i am, at school, putzing around because there are exams and i can't work til all the people are gone. so what do i do? get an x-box, get some movies and presto! instant do nothing but piss around all day day (there are supposed to be two days). recently i've discovered the goodness that is Msytery Science Theater 3000. i know i know, it's a bit geeky but truely hilarious. old crappy movies being made fun of by a guy and two robots stuck out in a satellite around earth is enough to make anyone laugh. but now i must go and watch the movies and play some halo.  -Matt

       Caring about Segregation   I do some weird things sometimes, like the other day i found myself watching the carebears movie 2 and at one point during the movie they separated the carebears from the carebear cousins. now i took this to be symbolic of segregation. think about it, the careBEARS were in the majority right, so they symbolize good ol' Whitey, while the carebear cousins who were all the visible minorities, such as lions, monkies and horses, represent just that, the visible minorities. and while the bears got to live in nice houses, the cousins had tolive homeless lives in the jungle when they were growing up. so i've come to the conclusion that caebears is a horrible show that has underlying messages supporting racism and segregation and thus is a horrible show for small children, lest we want another Hitler on our hands. -Matt

       Worst job in existance   i've been pondering this for a long time now, i always wondered what the worst job in the world would have to be...like would it be a garbage man? no, they get paid alot and so what it's just garbage. Janitor? no it's easy work. mayhaps a person working in a sewage treatment plant, nah they get to play with all sorts of fun doodads, plus you can find some pretty sweet stuff that you can pawn off as long as you don't say where it came from. no i've decided that the worst possible job you can have is being a packer in a fudge factory. imagine how your children would deal with this, imaginewhat would happen the day the teacher asks the child what his or her parents do, i think it would go something like this...   Teacher:  What does your daddy do Timmy?  Timmy:  He's a fudge packer!  Teacher : now Timmy that's not very nice. now really what does he do?  Timmy : I told you! he packs fudge all day long!  Teacher : Now Timmy you are just being rude.  Timmy : I'm telling the truth! honest! Everyday he and lots of other men go into a big room and they all pack fudge.  Teacher : Timmy!!!  Timmy : and sometimes when we need more money he packs fudge til really late at night! Teacher: That's it Timmy! go to the principles office!  Timmy : but but but i was tellng the truth!  And that's how i think it would go. Thus traumitizing the poor child and making him affraid of talking about his father and costing him thousands in doctor fees for the therapy he needs after his nervous break down when he's asked if he wants a fudge sundae. -Matt

       and that's how the dumb bitch ruined my semester..........stupid bitch   ya that exam was mighty gay, Elton John gay. but to clear some minor things up that might be confusing, the essay we wrote was not worth 50% of our total mark, the essay and a multiple choice exam is worth the 50, so you're not totally fucked, but you're still fucked because it's HALF YOUR FUCKING MARK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  oh ya and to correct myself from an earlier blog. apparently it's no p.s.s it's p.p.s etc...... who knew?  -Errol

       The day the memory died   Ah yes! I too had to write that gay essay today, very same one, except I did read death of a salesman, let me tell you...It didn't help much. Seriously, you try writing a damn essay on the significance of memories of the past and support it with examples from literature that you read in class. i seriously don't get the point of diplomas, 50% of your mark on one freaking test. 50%!!!! basically whether or not you fail the course is decided by one test, worst of all it's all luck of the draw if you're prepared for it or not. no one knows what the essay question will be about and no one knows if the stories and whatnot that were read in class will have any relevance to the question. so it's things like these where even the english teachers were choked about it. stupid stupid question, and stupid stupid essay. -Matt

       What a stupid bitch   holy shit boys and girls.......I just had a rough morning.  to start off, for the last couple days we've had freezing rain so the roads aren't too safe, and we've been having some speratic power outages as well so it's kinda crazy 'round here.  but here's the deal, today...the dayt i write the 1st half of my english diploma exam, we have both, the rain and the outage, ya the rain cancelled the buses so there were no classes today which is all right but i had to get driven to school which was gay. then about 10 minutes before the exam was to begin when the teachers were setting up the computers, we had a power outage that lasted for about 5 minutes of so, so the exam started late............goddamnit why is the world arrayed against me? what the fuck did i ever do to it???  on top of the the essay topic had to do with the signifacance of memories, and almost everyone that wasn't in my class found it really easy, ya wanna know why my classmates and i found it kinda difficult? cuz our stupid bitch of a teacher didn't want to give us death of a salesman to read... and that fuckin book is all the guys memories..... jesus fuckin christ sonofabitch cocksuckin whore. damnit!!!!!!  -Errol

       Out of Character   Today, is going to be a little different. Now I know Matt has promised all of you some spectacular rants coming from me (which there will be I assure you) due to my "unique bitchyness", but not today. Lately I've been kinda morose due to.........situations completely out of my control. Today, for instance, I spent all day in my room, studying for my english and social diploma exams, listening to some of my compilation disks that I've made over the years. As I'm listening a track comes on that I hadn't heard in a while, and I really like the song, it's  Broken Words  by  Finger Eleven . As i'm listening the course comes on and the lyrics go " She's the one who saw my words, broken, torn at the seams. And broken words are all she heard, now she's walking away from me ." At this point I realized that I was crying, a lyric made me cry. Now for those who know me they should know that that is not like me at all, but there I was laying on my bed, books in front of me with tears in my eyes. Now I'd like to end this little introspection with a quote, actually another lyric -  "Walk into this world with your head up high" - Deftones

       Thus proven   And so it is shown that if you poke him he will snap. *poke poke* nextly i want to point something out...   tact  (takt), n. ability to say and do the right things; skill in dealing with people or handling difficult situations.  now...where in all that you said was there even the slightest inkling of tact? but as most of you can now see, he's very temprementle, i've spent many a day provoking him to cheer myself up, just wait til he goes on one of his bigger rants...don't worry they'll come.   oh yeah. tact is for people not witty enough for sarcasm. -Matt

       The poor little new guy   I see this young grass hopper has yet to learn that special little thing people like to call the edit button. It's a magical little device that allows one to actually CHANGE what has been posted, mind boggling I know! And poor ignorant him not knowing that people have been paid to do this, if he had taken the time to read the blogger main page. Indeed, he is still wet behind the ears but I think that once he gets used to it everyone will show him the same respect that I do...hmmmm...Alright I lied, I don't respect him, but when he gets bitchy it is fun to argue just to see him get mad, it's hilarious, imagine a little bird that's puffing out it's chest it can't do anything other then huff and puff, and then you poke it and it snaps but actually acomplishes very little. that's Errol alright, funny to look at. -Matt

       I guess I'm a Hater   Well a little while ago i did a post on old people and why they annoy me...completely innocent, and i got this very hurtful reply...   you're really stupid. and insensitive. these "old people" were doing shit for the world before you were even born, and now they're not as spry as they used to be, haters like you suddenly see them as nuisances. wake up, grow up, get a grip. you're going to wake up old one day. ashley | 02.19.04 - 2:58 pm | #   Insensitive i may be, but stupid? no! i was thinking economics when i wrote that. Seriously, we'd save SO much money if we just got rid of them. You know, i think that it would still be cheaper if we put a 100$ a head bounty on people over 55. People don't "Suddenly" get old, it takes time (a lot of it), and then they leech off of everyone else. just the same as they don't "suddenly" become nuisances, it develops over time. One day i may be old, but i won't just wake up that way one day, i'll see it coming years off. stupid people don't realise that getting old takes time.  That being said, ashley you must take into account that some people DO have a sense of humor and not everything should be taken seriously. like i mean, we couldn't really grind up old people and feed them as is to the homeless, we'd need to produce mass ammounts of gravy to go with it because the meat would be so horribly dry. So if you're going to critisize me for something, keep in mind that i'm probably joking. -Matt

       the truth about a 30 year old loser that works in a comic book store   Alright I was online today and  urlLink this  article was brought to my attention by a really good friend of mine. Now this guy seriously needs to be slapped, and I mean slapped damn hard. First thing I noticed right from the start is that this guy never said men or women, he keeps saying boys and girls which leads me to believe that this 30 year old probably is still stuck in the preteen "girls have cooties" stage of his life and he probably still lives in his moms basement. Next thing I noticed was his star trek analogy, nothing screams DORKWAD like the ability to make an actually analogy to star trek that is understandable to other trekkies. But I'm too tired now to fully insult this idiot but I suggest you read the article and make you're own decision on how stupid this guy is. -Matt

       Old People: The alternative fuel source   Monday was family day here in Alberta, and I went out with my mom to go shopping. It seemed to me that it was also pokey old people day, it was so annoying, I'd be trying to walk down an aisle and BAM! Old person taking their merry time to move, and they were everywhere, clogging traffic with their slowness. And to top it all off, these same slow old people would start poking and pushing you to get you out of the way when the odd time came up that you were stopped and they wanted to go. So during my frustration I thought of a brilliant idea, we could use old people as an alternative fuel source! I mean, we could grind them up and burn them for energy thus we have a renewable resource for fuel. And then I thought "why stop there" why don't we kill two birds with one stone, world hunger AND over population. We could take all the baby boomers send them to a slaughter house and then take all the meat from them and feed it to the homeless. I mean, it would solve so many problems, no more hungry homeless people, no more old people clogging traffic and stores, and no more retired people making the younger generations pay for their pension. And just think of the money saved in the health care system without all those prosthetic hips being needed.  -Matt

       The lowest common denominator   There's always something that can piss you off faster then anything else. Something, that no matter what the situation, will worsen your day just upon the mention of it. Something that irks you to no end and that frustrates you immensely. With me, it's the customers at the world-famous (maybe not world) "Wal-mart". I've been thinking this over quite a lot and I have put most customers into general classifications and then color coded them...minus the color coding but here goes...    The Bargain Hunter:   The bargain hunter is of course just that. Most of the time an elderly woman (there are exceptions), the bargain hunter can be found lurking through the aisles on a quest for the lowest prices, buying items that normal people would almost never need because it's on sale. The bargain hunter will abstain from purchasing products if they can save even a few cents buying it somewhere else. The bargain hunter is easily recognizable by the fact that they have a cart full of Uncle Joe's turtle wax, BIG JIM'S Q-tips, and extra strength horse tranquilizer.    The WIDE LOAD   The Wide Load is usually a middle aged outrageously overweight person that seems to enjoy perusing the aisles at a crawl and of course they must be right in the middle of the aisle as to avoid hitting the shelves with their oversized load. The Wide Load always seems to have the uncanny ability to stop in front of the exact shelf that you need to get to and seem to spend a long time there for no apparent reason, although research has shown that they may be trying to catch their breath from over exerting themselves. Research has also shown that provoking a wide load may cause them to jiggle with fury.    The Defiler   Defilers have no specific characteristics, the only time you can identify one is when you catch them in action. A defiler is the type of person that opens up all the containers to see what's really in side, they undo all the seals and then place the product back on the shelf and take a brand new box. Sometimes they must open up multiple boxes of the same product just to be sure that they are all the same. Unfortunately this leaves the product even more vulnerable to the next group of customers.    The Scavenger   The Scavenger is never seen in action and while almost the same as a run of the mill shoplifter there are some key differences. A scavenger will take only parts of a whole product, not the entire thing. They seem to take key pieces that when missing render the product useless but have no actual use on their own. Even an unopened container is not safe from a scavenger, they have the innate ability to open and close a container flawlessly.    The Mother Hen   This person brings their children with them everywhere and unfortunately these are always the most ill mannered misfits imaginable. The mother hen only ever reacts in two ways, either beating the children (or at least threatening to) or completely ignoring the children and annoying every other person around them. This person is also the type of person that believes that it's a bright idea to take 1 to 5 year old children out all day and expect them not to do anything.    The Stink Monger   The stink monger is quite possibly the most disgusting and revolting person you can imagine. They are the type of person that has never heard of bathing and they also believe that health care products are a waste of money. They seem to also like being in close proximity to other people and also seem to never notice their own stench.  ( and now I have writer's block so please excuse me as a bash my head against the keyboard  ksdfjkfssfsdfsjdklfhsdkjhflsdkjh[pfwertjkdcvrgubxc n,bn xctyeruil.k.rgvfgfyyuuyygyygygysuawioldc that's better except now it hurts. )    The Lost Fool   The lost fool is probably not as annoying to other customers as they are to Wal-mart employees. The lost fool will enter into any department and ask where a product is that could never ever be considered to be located anywhere in that department, for example someone asking for moth balls in the foods section. They are the type that go to the pets department and ask if the newest Yu-Gi-Oh or Bey blade shipment are in.    The Nit Picker   The nit picker must always pick only the type of product that shows no blemishes or scratches. The slightest discoloration of the plastic or a small fray in the fabric means that this item is no longer fit to be used by the nit picker. The nit picker has such high standards that nothing but the best will do for them...That's why they shop at Wal-mart.    The Sale Searcher   There is a difference between the sale searcher and the bargain hunter, while the Bargain hunter will buy things that they don't need because it's on sale, the sale searcher will only come for one thing and one thing only. The dilemma with this is that the sale searcher has a tendency to arrive late for a sale and then commence to whine about how the sale should still be on. After a long argument with an unfortunate employee the sale searcher will storm out of the store fuming mad about the injustice done upon them.  I seem to have only skimmed the surface of the types of customers that frequent Wal-mart but the ones that are not mentioned are no less annoying then those that were. my advice is either to just avoid Wal-mart or kick these people as you see them in the hopes that they can overcome their annoying ways. -Matt

       Tra la la la la, Someone seems to not know what he's talking about   Alright, I'm tossing this little guestbook entry in here for 2 reasons. Firstly I find it rather amusing and must reply to it but I'm sick of just posting out here when people don't know what I'm talking about. Secondly I'm deleting it from my guestbook because despite the fact that I can have thousands of entries in there before I even need to start worrying about it filling up, it's simply too much of a waste of space for me to leave there. So here it is...   Ha ha,   Not very hard to get around blocks. But you know what; I learned this gettting an education. Speaking of speaking face to face, how many times had I heard you dis Clayton behind his back? Many times. Can you say hypocrite? You shouldn't preach out your mouth then do the opposite. Plus the fact that you Matt are in fact overwieght as well, and the fact that you have your own BLOG to drone on and on with; this makes your call on me being a fat computer nerd null. Hey, guess what I found Matt? A hypocrite. Errol, despite being gay sometimes, is still OK. You think I hid the fact that I drew that picture? No, I didn't. I told Errol about it on MSN.I rip on Errol for being retarded just like he rips on me for being me. So you know what Matt, I would have told Errol all about this if you hadn't been gay about it. Ha ha. Hypocrite. Oh yeah this is the last post I'll be making since my involvement with this has been far too much; since you are not worth my time. ---------------------------------------------- hypocrite  Hyp"o*crite, n. [F., fr. L. hypocrita, Gr. ? one who plays a part on the stage, a dissembler, feigner. See Hypocrisy.] One who plays a part; especially, one who, for the purpose of winning approbation of favor, puts on a fair outside seeming; one who feigns to be other and better than he is; a false pretender to virtue or piety; one who simulates virtue or piety.    First of all, I'd still like to say that I truly have nothing against Jason, but an attack on my person must and always will be responded to. Why? Just because that's the way I am. Once again I must reiterate the whole concept of talking to someone directly, did you physically walk up to Errol and show him the picture? No! Do talk to him in person (by in person I mean face to face, both of you in the same place at the same time, not MSN) when you insult him? No! And indeed you would've told Errol about it. Now how does this make me a hypocrite? How was I being gay about it? Someone coming on my site? Taking shots at my friend (the term friend is used loosely). At first I thought, alright, they're insulting Errol, well I guess they can but I'll let him decide what happens, and that is indeed what happened. I didn't start to respond directly to anything until I was directly involved. I would think that anyone that wants to trash talk me would expect me to respond in kind.   And I'm overweight??? I find this extremely amusing coming from someone that easily has, at the very least, 100lbs over me and also someone who does absolutely no physical activity whatsoever. And indeed I talk about Clayton being a geek, but to his face and jokingly at that. You see...Clayton is a friend...now I know that this concept of a friend is very difficult for you to grasp, but they're something that people that go outside once in awhile and have lives outside of the little box that you are currently sitting infront of right now have. And indeed I have a blog that "drones on and on"  but it's something that I do in my spare time and when I feel like it. I don't make the effort to write in it all the time fool.   Now just to end this all off, fine don't respond to this, makes no difference to me. Just know that if you do, I will reply just depending on how lazy I feel whether or not you'll get a long reply or not. But do it in the comment thing that are just below each message not my guestbook, it'll save me the hassle of deleting them. And a final note Jason, you are now the official Fatty McTubTub Fatterson who is fat. Why are you all this? Because you annoyed me, but I still have nothing against you. -Matt

       Added to the ode   let me clear something up for all those people out there. To say something to someone's face involves being physically there talking to them...Not indirectly through pictures, electronical means, or saying that you "hate that kid" after they leave the room.  And, while it may be "astounding" that people can get around blocks, it can only serve to further prove the fact that someone has no life. i'd continue more with this but it isn't worth my time. -Matt

       A note to the reader   alright here's a little message for the 2 people (who i assume know errol) that put messages in my guestbook. firstly, take it somewhere else you tools, if you're gonna insult him, do it to his face, not protected behind your key board and moniter. Secondly, IP addresses are fun! i'm leaving them there for now til he sees them then i'll delete them, aaaaaaaand maybe block you as well. Thirdly, only i can make crude comments about errol's ass, simple as that! i own it dammit (you know i do errol), in other words even if i may take shots at him all the time, you can't because he has my protection. Fourthly, you can't bring that trash in here! this is MY HOUSE *hits fist to chest* -Matt: Ruler of this site and all who read it!

       An ode to the Fucktard   He's not just any old fucktard. he's the biggest fucktard there is, as a matter of fact he is THE fucktard. his name, Shit bitch, as i will forever more call him, no longer his other name, which will never be remembered, just shit bitch. well anyways, this little pile of dog feces is such a little baby rapist that he's forced the daycares in his area to spring for the spermicidal talcum powder. needless to say he pisses me off, but like the chicken shit he is he's all talk and just a nugget fucking little pansy ass bitch. so, it's jackass time for good ol' matt, he's made the list of people that i despies so much that i'll actually make a huge effort to just piss them right the fuck off. best part is, if he does anything else, i figure fuck it, and i'll beat he til his shit turns red and the only teeth he'll have are the ones that fell out in his ass when i jam his head up there. and i'm kinda hoping that someone that knows him will read this and tell him, because honestly the only warning he's getting from me is my fist connecting with his malformed chin on his herpes infested face. I think that i can easily say that i've really been itching for a fight, but i could only bring myself to kick the ass of a person that i truly believed that he deserved it...shit bitch deserves it...and quite honestly, i don't care about the consequences. -Matt

       Tralalalala-lalalala   I know I haven't blogged in a while but I'm working on a really big one for everyone's enjoyment.....even the blind, and the deaf. But anyway I'm standing here, in my spare that I have every other morning in the  library in front of this p.o.s computer that my school forces us to use and I thought, hey why not blog? I mean I don't even have to have anything to say, I could just go along a stream of consciousness shit like that. So anyway, This next couple of months are going to be pretty big for me, April 1st my brother moves out and into the city, which is really good, it means that I will no longer be kept awake or woken up by the sound of my brother fucking his girlfriend, cuz his room is directly beneath mine, and she is very noisy, and my bro knows this but it raises a very good point, he asked me would I rather hear her moaning and groaning or him grunting and yellin' out "oh ya ride big papa daddy!!!!!" but anyways, he moves out April 1st and then I have the house to myself for the most part until I graduate, and then on July 1st I move in with my brother cuz my parents got us the apartment, really sweet deal cuz as long as I'm going to school they'll pay my rent, we actually worked it out and it's cheaper to get me and my bro an apartment than it is to get both of us vehicles, plus the fact that I still don't even have my learners license but that's a moot point. So ya, I move in on Canada Day and I have made it clear to my brother in no uncertain terms that when I am home, he will not be fucking his girlfriend, if I'm not at home, then that's cool but not in my bed or I told him to his face that I would beat him to death with my gap wedge. So ya I know I kinda went off on a tangent there but hey, it's stream of consciousness, what can ya do?

       I despise essays   I really do! I mean I hate everything about them! Which is why I can't understand why I helped one of my friends write one (and by help I mean do it for her). So there I am at my friend's house being all sick like I have for the past few days and I assume she got fed up with my constant nose blowing and sniffing. Eventually she offered me some medicine for it, Tylonol Sinus it was, and me being me how could I refuse magic pills that will make me feel better? So I took them...I started feeling a little tired a bit down the line, and found it hard to keep my eyes open. It was about this time that she asked me if I was feeling tired at all, of course I was, and she told me she just realized she had given me the nighttime tylonol. So there I was, trying to stay awake fighting the drugs that are trying to put me to sleep. It was difficult I have to say, but I made it...I think. But all I can think about right now is that I tried to help her out of the goodness of my heart, without getting anything out of this and she repayed me by drugging me! The nerve of people! -Matt

       The smell of Rugby's in the air   what is that smell like? it's the smell of fresh blood, the smell of sweat, the smell of vomit, the smell of crushed grass, of water, and of torn up earth. It's the smell of being alive, knowing that for the next 80 minutes you're up against people that can be faster, stronger and smarter then you, you run in with the knowledge that no matter how good they are one hard hit will put them down. The rush of adrenaline when you go on to the field knowing that you're going to get hit and hit harder or go down trying. and it's amazing that after that 80 minutes are up, after you're bloodied and bruised, you want more, to go back and do it all again just for that rush. -Matt

       More new stuff   Well, I got it into my head today to start posting a bit more here. When I went to the Blogger main page i see something about posting pictures to my blog hassle free without any html or any of that. So i jumped on it and downloaded this program called Hello and signed up and all that mojumbo. so as you can see below i posted my very first pic, and it was so easy. Yes that's me down there, and while it's not the greatest picture, it made me laugh and that's what counts. I guess I haven't really been posting very regularily as I too have felt the writers block. I mean, i knew what i wanted to write but i wasn't inspired to do so. Well i too am graduating this year, in a little over a month. It's weird that i'm going to have to get on with the rest of my life though, i mean i've become used to showing up at school every day infact it's all i really know. but back to grad, I'm MC for it, that's right little ol' is master of ceremonies for my grad, oddly i don't really know what that job entails. I guess i'll figure it out or something, right? Anyways enough of this, I'm gonna start putting pics up here more now because i can, and maybe get some of Errol and his sexy self up here too. -Matt

       Almost.....   i now have less than 1 month left in the school year before exams begin, and it really hasn't sunk in yet, but that's fine by me. this blog is harder for me to write for some reason, i'm having a bit of writers block which isn't making much sense but i still accept as normal, i have a 4 day weekend, i'm finally going in to get my learners license today, after failing 3 times already (it's kinda pathetic isn't it). I am still working on my big  Best of the Best  blog because the txt file that is the list is on my brother's computer, and he doesn't live at home anymore so i really only get the chance to work on it when i go and see him. but all that will change once i get my laptop, that will be sweet indeed. suprising enough, i've run out of useless crap to say.    Adieu               -Errol

       Mojumbo returns   So I haven't blogged in a while...so what? I've been busy. I turned 18 on the 25th and everyweekend since i've been out and every weeknight i've been trying to do school work after normal work. But I have learned a very valuable lesson, don't run on a gravel driveway while drunk, especially when someone else who's more drunk is running behind you and can't go straight. tsk, I wish I had time to write more but I'm so sleepy and it's only 5 o'clock. -Matt

       Think it's Kinda crazy   Alright so right now my mind is brimming with ideas to write about...unfortunately i'm leaving tomorrow to go see louis in Ohio for 2 weeks. so i have to put my brainstorms on hold. mostly just so I can remember i'll give you the rundown on what they'll be about. 1. Flames Bandwagon theory & why people that say everyone is doing it 2. Graduation 3. the creepy discovery of how i look almost exactly like oscar wilde 4. My ohio trip, because i know i'll want to  so stay tuned young readers, they'll be coming your way before you know it...maybe even sooner. -Matt

       This is the end...My only friend the end   Well that's it i guess, school's done except for exams. it's over forever until college in a years time. The last few days have indeed been memorable. What with the before mentioned singing, during which i was singled out of the group by the teacher that yelled at us when clearly i wasn't the only one there. yes maybe i DID sing a bit louder but still...all 6 of us were standing there. of course i had my petty revenge that night with the sacking of his room that evening, nothing harmful, just misplacing a few things and some streamers placed everywhere...fun times. there were others that i was helping but they shall not be named. then today was the the ardrossan picnic and parade, it used to be the canada day picnic and parade but it was changed because of schedualling conflicts a few years ago. so summer starts and the festivities begin right? or the tedious amounts of yard work. but then i go to Ohio for two weeks to see louis, who i haven't seen for 4 years! truly gonna be great i think... -Matt

      Alright so lately i haven't been too busy...but i have been damn lazy. so not much of anything has been done by me lately, just don't feel like it. But I did recently go out and buy some everclear (seen below). And man i tell you that stuff is crazy strong, kinda bought it on impulse it was $9.50 so how i pass that up right? but i really guess that summer makes us lazy, or me more specifically. I just don't feel like doing anything, but just to make me laugh and maybe provoke him again...  Fatty McTubtub Fatterson (aka Jason) likes to do shameful things to farm animals and and sell the photographs to small children.

       The Best Of The Best Of The Best......Hey isn't that a quote from Top Gun?  a while ago&nbsp;my buddy Jim did an article with his list of the best albums of the 21st century, it had some really good albums on it but a few of them I really can't agree with, cuz I just really don't like the bands, I despise them, mostly out of spite against pop culture, and by that i mean top 40 pop culture.... but anyways, I have decided to create a list of the best of the best: movies, albums, ideas, crimes against humanity, you name it, I got it. So here goes........    Greatest albums/artists     Led Zeppelin  - really anything by them cuz they are the kings of rock'n roll, fuck Elvis  Cold: Year of the Spider  - a great album, good groove, varying sound, plus they put limp bizkit to shame as they are also from Jacksonville....Ha! Take that Fred Durst ya stupid piece of shit!  Papa Roach: Infest  - really cool CD with alot of anger in the lyrics, perfect for kids from suburbia who wasn't to vent their anger towards mommy and daddy cuz they won't buy them the new Jetta  Linkin Park: Hybrid Theory/Meteora/Reanimation/Live in Texas  - I don't have to explain this, they are just killer musicians, if you don't agree get that shit out of your ears and throw out your Wave CD you ignorant prick  Eric Clapton  - once again no explanation needed, excellent performer, a straight out classic  Jimmi Hendrix  - see above  Hawksley Workman  - he writes some crazy tunes, I mean C'mon the course is "striptease for me baby!"  Queens of the Stone Age: Songs for the Deaf  - a concept album plain and simple, much like dark side of the moon  Queens of the Stone Age: Restricted  - really cool writing, some awesome guitar work and an all around great album  Matthew Good : Avalanche  - finally he has a means to vent all him political anger and societal fury without bandmates dragging him down, he should have dropped his band a long time ago, not that his music wasn't good when it was the Matthew Good Band but now the music itself is so much better  Prodigy: Fat of the Land  - crazy industrial shit, creating really cool rhythms electronically while still using actual instruments  Cowboy Bebop: Soundtrack(s)  - the greatest collection of techno, rock and funk jazz on the planet coupled with the series/movie, it's fuckin' incredible, if someone says the Japanese don't know their shit, smack'm for me  Finger Eleven  - most likely in the top five of the greatest Canadian bands, i saw these guys last fall and they were awesome, they know how to put on a show and they write some intense tunes too, which is always good  The Tea Party  - one of the world's most unerrated bands, they have more talent for writing and skill with their instruments than 90% of the bands out there, yet their sales outside of Canada have been lackluster, I don't know why, they fuckin rock  Static-X  - if you want to hear some really intense techno metal, this is for you    Greatest Movies /TV Shows     Miami Vice  - two words, Don Johnson, I just can't wait 'til they put the entire series on DVD  Get Shorty  - if you haven't seen it you deserve 85 lashes  The Usual Suspects  - see above fucko  Lord of the Rings Trilogy  - it makes me want to be a sloppy fat New Zealander, it's that good  Cowboy Bebop: Series/Movie  - One of the greatest anime's ever, Shinichiro Watanabe knows his shit  Gundam Wing: Series/Endless Waltz  - this introduced me to anime, cool characters, great story, and you can't beat giant robots completely fucking shit up  The Bourne Identity  - A great adapted version of the Robert Ludlum classic, and it proves without a doubt that Matt Damon is a better actor than Ben Affleck  Indiana Jones Trilogy  - C'mon nothing beats an adventurer that fights Nazis and evil cults in search of riches to contribute to the good of humanity, eat shit and die Lara Croft, you got nothing you little bitch  Star Wars Trilogy  - The Greatest in Sci-Fi, better that Battlestar Gallactica by far, but don't even get me started on episode 1 and 2, George Lucas.....what were you thinking, oh right....$$$$$$$$$$  Nash Bridges  - Five words, Don Johnson and Cheech Marin  Akira  - The West's introduction to anime, a really fucked up movie but nonetheless intense as hell, a must see motion piucture  Super Troopers  - I finally saw it, and it was hilarious, you have to see it.

       urlLink    This is me as a "hero" and Erin as the clingy girl. This is the reason i earned the name Swordmaster Fanboy wannabe. Both of us thought it was funny that the artist caught Erin's bubbly personality and my barely kept tolerance of her in the picture (hee! Hi Erin!)&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This one is Erin and I as Sally and Jack from Nightmare before Chirstmas. I went to this artist first thing in the morning on sunday but she was going on her break so i had to wait until she got back. For the next hour i was constantly looking over my shoulder to see when she got back. when she finally did we went over there and Erin immediately struck up a conversation with her while i was trying to figure out what i want. She had suggested that she could draw us as these characters simply because Erin's hair reminded her of Sally. Of course Erin fell in love with this idea and really wanted it. It took two and a half hours to finish, but it was well worth it.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This is seriously my favorite drawing out of all the ones i got. This was the one that caused me to wait two and a half hours for another by the same artist, that plus she was freaking hilarious. We were just siting there and she asked us what we wanted. Just then i glanced over at Erin and she was wearing cat ears so i impulsively said "give her a tail!" and so she did. I still love this picture, we're so happy in it.&nbsp; urlLink

       Super anime tag team Deluxe     &nbsp;  Well this weekend was the famed Animethon 2004! It's an annual convention that comes to edmonton where geeks, nerds, and dweebs alike can come together and pretend that they belong...i felt a little out of place here but not too much.  &nbsp;  At the begining of the 2 day ordeal i felt a slight buzz from the atmosphere...then i entered the building. I immediately noticed that it really was a geeks convention, although there were mostly normal people there that may have had some geek like tendeansies, they were dulled by comparison to the stereotypical geeks that i saw. It was a frightening experience at first, people that i thought only exsisted in fairy talesor urban legends had come to life.&nbsp;I'm not talking about the people dressed up as anime characters, i'm talking about the actual, full-fledged, live-in-their-mother's-basement-til-they're-thirty geeks. There were greasy ones, skinny ones, fat ones, short ones, tall ones, every type you could imagine, they had all come out at a risk of exposing themselves to real sunlight. And let me tell you, some of them were really bad...so unbelieveably geeky it's hardly imaginable. Don't believe me? here's a little story to back me up:  &nbsp;   During his Weekend at animethon Matt decided to take advantage of the slightly cheaper deals on manga so he headed to the dealer room. After some browsing and purchasing several Mangas Matt found his good friend Erin and decided to leave. But on his way out someone had noticed his awsome t-shirt yet again. It was truly one of the coolest t-shirts anyone had ever seen, it was a shirt that had pixilated weapons from Nintendo's "Legend of Zelda" with the words "Don't make me go Zelda on you". Matt had been complimented on is shirt all day, but this time it was different.    "I recognize the silver sword, the&nbsp;potion, the bow, and the hammer." said the geek in the in the booth, "But what's that other one? a wooden sword?"    "Well it's pixilated and they only use 4 colors, of course you won't recognize it." replied Matt    "Well then what is it?"&nbsp;asked the geek.    "I don't know" said Matt feeling slightly annoyed    "you own the shirt and you don't even know what's on it?" accused the geek    "Okay, fine, it's a damned rusty sword" replied an aggitated Matt    "But it can't be, if it was usted it would break and wouldn't be that useful." retorted the smug sounding geek.    "not nessesarily" replied Matt again sounding all the more annoyed.    "Yes it would, rust breaks down the steel at a molecular level, making the sword very weak and causing it to break when it is used."    Erin stepped in at this time and dragged&nbsp;Matt away&nbsp;possibly because she noticed the annoyed look on Matts face thus saving the geek from a retort that may have crushed his little game playing world snding him into an obivion where a gek must finally accept that games aren't the real world and there's life outside of the little cartridges and 16 bit graphics of old games.   &nbsp;  Actually i thought it was funny because i actually did have several things to say that would have just been really mean, but oh well another time perhaps.  &nbsp;  for a anime convention i actually did very little anime watching, simply because i wanted to see the cosplay, which i had to wait in line for for an hour and was extremely dissappointed with because i had heard so many good things about it years previous. And i was just plain old disturbed by the guy that dressed up like a girl and started singing show tunes. it was all made better when i found out that my friend had won a prize for his cosplaying though.  &nbsp;  The next day i spent most of my time in the place called Artist's alley getting drawings done. completely awsome ones at that which i had to wait hours for and fall asleep while waiting.  &nbsp;  you know...i always seem to do this, i start writing and then lose interest and stop, oh well another time. but i shall put up some of those drawings that i got just because they kick so much ass.  -Matt

       Pretty and new  &nbsp; Ooooooooooh! Blogger yet again has a new template...don't know why i mentioned that.&nbsp;But whatever. &nbsp; Interesting side note, Jason seems to have this obsession with me now for some reason. I blocked him on my messenger a while agojust because he was a pest but i never have messenger open so i forgot that i had blocked him. a few days ago mind you i went though my contact list and saw that he had changed his name to something about me blocking him. Ok so the first thing that comes to mind is why would he care? the next is why would he change his sign in name to that? and thirdly why would he take the effort to find out that? I've come to only one conclusion about this, he's obviously in love with me and gets jealous when i avoid him.  &nbsp; Well Jason i'm sorry to disappoint you but i am straight, i always have been, and i'm extremely comfortable with the fact that i am.  -Matt

       Homeward bound   So in a mere 4 hours i'm going to be on a plane heading for minneapolis and then back home to Edmonton...so what am i supposed to feel here? happy that i'm going home? sad that i don't get to stay longer. i'm both of these...it's weird. i really hate mixed emotions, stupidest things ever. I mean I DO want to go home, i miss it and i can't help it. And people there miss me too, even my dogs are lost without me there so i'm told. but then i'll miss being here too, i mean i've met TONS of new people although some of them i've talked to long before i ever saw them in person. And i've had a blast even when i was doing nothing more then watching tv with louis. I mean i hadn't seen him in over 4 years and the last 2 weeks have been great. but there's the dependability of home, the people that i've been with for years that know me the best. it's strange...although i may get to see louis again if he comes out to Alberta in the fall. but now i must go and make sure that i'm bringing everything with me that i brought here. -Matt

       Going to the Zoo zoo zoo!   Yay! I went to the zoo again today! i like zoos they're so much fun! but i still think it's sad that they have some of these animals in enclosures that are way to small for them. like the polar bears that just pace all day or the wolves that do the same...it's kinda sad. i wish zoos had more money to be bigger. -Matt

       Did you say.....WIRELESS???????   well that time is upon me now, that time when i must move out of my parents house and start anew on my own. well actuallly it's not really starting over, i guess i kinda had a bit of a bit of time to start running before i hit the starting line (metaphorically speaking of course). yesterday i moved in with my brother in the apartment my parents got for us for when i graduated. the head start, is the fact that my brother's been living in the apartment since april so it was pretty much settled by the time i got there. the apartment is really cool, no carpet so i don't have to vacum, just sweet and mop and hey! i used to get paid to do that shit so i don't think i'm gonna have many problems with that aspect. but the greatest thing about my new place is the wireless network i set up today, it's fucking sweet. i got a brand new laptop for a grad present from my entire family, so my brother and i decided to hook his behemoth of a desktop with my sleek and sexy little unit, remember ladies...it's not the size of the boat that matters, it's the motion in the ocean. but anywaz, it's so cool i can now access my high speed connection fom anywhere in the aprtment, hell i could download porn while taking a shit, or brushing my teeth, or changing my sheets hahahaha..........so ya. that's all for now, i'll be back after these messages from our corporate sponsers

       As we go on, we remember   Just over a week ago (last saturday to be exact) it was my graduation. I guess for a lot of people graduations are supposed to be a huge thing, they're supposed to be one of the biggest days of your young life. for that reason, due to all the hype surrounding it, that i became excited about it. And although I was also MC i wasn't nervous at all. but it came and went (with me barely paying attention to any of the people speaking and being caught off guard when i had to go up). The most memorab;e part of the whole thing though was when my partner the mistress of ceremonies, after having been told multiple times that the mics were still on and picking up what we said close to them, was trying to put on her hat and grew frustrated and said right into the mic "screw the hat". It was more embarassing to her than anything else.  later on that day, after the limo ride, was the banquet. Sadly the speeches at the banquet i actually listened to and with the exception of the salute to the students, they were all a disappointment one way or another. the tribute to the parents was impossible to hear, the reply from the parents became a little boring at the parts that you could hear. And, like i predicted, the class historians was a roaring failure. I've seen class historian done successfully only one time, unfortunately these two didn't seem to have to ability to get the communication with the rest of the graduating class that would actually make it a good speech. Oh sure some people thought it was great, although tey fail to realize that they were among the minority that the speech catered to. But it's over and a speech is just words right? but all in all the whole nigh was great, to bad it's over and i'm technically supposed to get on with the rest of my life. Psht! screw that, i'll live at home forever! i'll show them...wait a minute... -Matt

       Here I am again on my own   So here i am. Matt in Ohio! So as it turns out, the room i'm staying in at Louis' place has a computer in it that they said i could use anytime...and me being me i leaped at the chance. I already wrote out this whole stupid blog once but it shut down and was stupid because i tried to use the spell check. So if my spelling is really off it's because i didn't use it this time. but anyways, because of this access to the internet, happy death won't be going on too much hold. so here's one of the before promised blogs.  A little while ago there was an event going on that involved hockey. A major event that had most households in Canada watching. this event was the Stanley cup finals, which pitted the Calgary Flames against some other less Canadian more American team. So of course people start to choose sides, and in the city of Edmonton the large majority cheered for Calgary, you saw flags, bumper stickers and the whole sha-bang going down here. But then you had some snooty self centered pricks that started complaining about how people were jumping on the flames bandwagon. That because everyone else in Edmonton was doing it we should too. Now i know that this is a difficult concept to grasp for these people but Calgary was the first Canadian team to make it to the stanley cup final in a very long time. That's right...Calgary, believe it or not, is a Canadian team. And oddly enough, Edmonton is also a city that's in Canada...that's so weird, I mean who would think that people from another canadian city would want a Canadian hockey team to win the stanley cup? Here's a question for you. If in the Olympics there was a canadian competing against atheletes from other countries would it be bandwagoning to do what everyone else in Canada and cheer for the canadian? maybe...i guess i'm wrong. you know, people shouldn't be allowed to root for the team that's from their country, they're giving into conformity...it's so stupid if people could actually think that. sometimes people make me mad. -Matt

       Brand new face   Well as some of you can see i finally got around to changing the template of my blog...i figured it was time to change it, and i also got out of my procrastinating slump at the urgings of other people or just one person. So here it is! The new face of a happy death! It's been almost 2 years since i've made any major changes and i suspect it'll be equally long before i do so again...like i said, i hate html even if i'm just adding something. -Matt

       The wonder that is the internet......and piracy     2 days ago i ran across a problem, kazaa being unreliable and relatively slow, didn't have the programs i was looking to pirate. This was bothering me for a while until it dawned on me.....HOTLINE!!!!!!! Absolutely the greatest file sharing program ever, it's been around for a long time, even if you've never heard of it, it been around for MAC users since around ....................19................94..............ish...............I think. but anyway, even dispite the sometimes frustrating rules set out by some of the servers, I see their point for them, they don't want to get arrested, they are covering their pirate asses, and god bless them for that  adios   oh ya, you can get Hotline at  urlLink http://www.hotspringsinc.com/

       urlLink    i post this because i was horribly threatened...only kidding!! Actually i've been meaning to put up another picture for a while and this one was suggested to me. Believe it or not though that's not actually my computer, it's the laptop of a friend of mine and i was playing with the coding of her website to add some stuff in. Poor her...she can't do anything on a computer and unfortunately has to rely on a lot of cruel and mean people for help. Oddly though, for something that should have taken me a couple minutes tops, it took me over half an hour...i hate html! hate it with a passion! &nbsp; urlLink

       And now for some randomness     Alright, so as i've been going around and getting along with my life, I've made some random decisions about stuff that should be a certain way, they're completely random (mostly) and only really have to do with things i've come upon in recent weeks.  1. Salsa is not meant to have corn in it. I don't care if it's southwestern style or Corny McCorncorn's special corn blend, salsa should NEVER have corn in it.  2. When people move, the house should have averything already in it. and i mean everything, there's ntohing i hate more tehn trying to fit a freaking couch through a door that it wasn't meant to fit through and then try to manuever it up a flight of stairs.  3. Ants should never build nests where it's in the way. Ant nests just should never be where some person may want to go at some point in time. they should have to be in the middle of nowhere and not somewhere where you can run it over with a lawnmower.  4. Milk should change color when it goes bad. just think about it...then how often would you accidently drink a glass of bad milk if it was red when it wasn't good anymore?  these are just some random things that i think should happen...just because -matt
