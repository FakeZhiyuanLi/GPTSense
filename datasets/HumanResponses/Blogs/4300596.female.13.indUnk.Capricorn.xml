       Today my friend seed a beaver on the road. It was brown and looked pokey. It was laying on its back with its feet in the air. It looked soo soo sad. It had 6 legs and some purple spray paint on it im guessin the other feet were the babies. It eyeball was popped out. You could see it's guts too. It really was sad to her but holarious to me.that was the day we seed a dead beaver.

      The Teenage Years::Smiles, tears, superficial fears, All are part of the teenage years. First dates, first cars, Having crushes on football stars. First jobs, First kisses, One to many hits and misses. The best years of growing up, With great achievments and screwing up. Good girls, bad boys, Finally throwing out old toys. Sneaking out, getting caught, Remembering all the fights we've fought. Boyfriends, girlfriends, hoping they're love never ends. Heart-breaks, making out, Just to hear parents shout. Drugs, pot and beer, All are part of the teenage years. High school college, then it ends, Its time to change once again. But we'll always remember all of the times, When we won we lost and when we cried. We'll always have memories of our fights and fears, And all the good times spent in the teenage years.

       What should I do what should I say does he like me  or does he just think I'm ok? How do I know because its really hard to tell I feel like I should go into a shell. Its really starting to annoy me now how he could just sit there like he's thinkin the same thing. the phone starts to ring should I pick it up or act like I don't notice anything. Do I look ok do I need to freshin up. I think I should act like I'm ok or do I need to say hey should I tell him. But what if he don't feel the same way. I guess I'll never tell and crawl back into my fuckin shell.

         She weighs 180lbs and reminds me of the leprechaun. It's really weird to know someone who might have been in a movie and don't even know it. She just has an annoying voice that makes you think of him, like she wants to kill you for just being near her. She tells people she's lost weight but I don't know where from. Probably from her sixth chin and one of her rolls. Kayla thinks she's SO much better than everyone only because she has teachers up her ass 24/7. We have a friend named Josh and she thinks he loves her madly. Only because he said she would be easy. She would be too she's desperate, NEVER had a boyfriend. Probably squish whoever it was. Have you seen her brother damn I didn't know an 8 yr old was suppose to weigh 120.5lbs sixty more pounds he'd be up there with her. When they run I swear they wobble and get hit in the face with their rolls. You know how FAT people have "HUGE BOOBS" no she's flat as a fucking board.
