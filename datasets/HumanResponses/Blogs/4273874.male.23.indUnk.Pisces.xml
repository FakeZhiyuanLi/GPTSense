      Well Evans arrival was much less traumatic than I originally thought, and man am I relived. There were almost tears in my eyes when I spoted him way down the arrivals hall, but then I was ok. We watched "Kentucky Fried Movie" ,"Goodbye Lennon"and a cartoon in bed called the Happy tree friends (not for childeren lol. Its been a lazy afternoon just watking up around 230. I finally feel like i can just be friends and not have those feelings anymore, kinda like it was after Alynne. It just came to that point a lot sooner, becasue I saw her so often. Here its been 2yrs since our last meeting . Oh well im off

      Well the day I thought Id never see again last year, has arrived. Evan is in Chicago awaiting a regional jet to Tulsa . I stayed up pretty late getting the apartment in "Show" condition, and mentally preparing myself. I cant wait to see him, but at the same time Im really not sure what my reaction will be after all the drama last year. This guy pretty much kicked me out of his life, brought me back for a week and then bang out the door again. Its been a year since we've "Re-established contact" and I still remember sitting on that Hyrdofoil in Hong Kong. I was listening to Delierium "Run for it" and I just could feel he was thinking about me. I was so mad that I was having those feelings again, .   " yeah you better run for you life, love"        Or simply flip my telepathic reception to "Local" and not receive feelings like that. When i returned to Rowland Heights there was an email there for me. And life has been ok since the night after, when I called him drunk and yelled about it. lol...sillly me of course I would have to do it drunk.   So im here awaiting the few hours left, awaiting the moment of truth to see how I will really react, and awaiting a hope that my heart will not long for what once was.

      Well here is my first entry in my new journal, since fucking Ujournal died suddenly taking my journal with it. I will post my old stuff from 2002 eventually. Ive got this lovely new Cell phone which Im not too pleased with..the idea of Windows on a cell phone is great, however is it practical? Not really, Motorola should be shot for this one. Its very pretty but the battery dies in 7hours, and you have quit each thing u open in it from a task manager.. oh well.
