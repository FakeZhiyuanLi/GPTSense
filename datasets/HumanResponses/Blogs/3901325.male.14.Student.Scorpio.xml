       Once upon a time, in New York City in 1941... at this club open to all comers to play, night after night, at a club named "Minton's Play House" in Harlem, they play jazz sessions competing with each other. Young jazz men with a new sense are gathering. At last they created a new genre itself. They are sick and tired of the conventional fixed style jazz. They're eager to play jazz more freely as they wish then... in 2071 in the universe... The bounty hunters, who are gathering in the spaceship "BEBOP", will play freely without fear of risky things. they must create new dreams and films by breaking traditional styles. The The work, which becomes a new genre itself, will be called... "COWBOY BEBOP" 3..2..1... LET'S JAM!  The English may be a bit jumbled, but the message in the Cowboy Bebop promos effectively captures the essence of the series. Cowboy Bebop is the tale of a futuristic maverick, Spike Spiegel, a space cowboy and his band of partners (Jet Black, Faye Valentine, Edward, and lets not forget Ein the dog), as they race across the galaxy on daring adventures. They are Bounty Hunters struggling to survive in a world that is a strange combination of past, present, and future. There are fantastic space crafts and interstellar casinos side by side with droopy sombreros and slow traffic lights. With each new bounty that they go after, new characters are introduced, and new cosmic landscapes are explored. The series is episodic, as Spike Spiegel heads off on a new quest each week to secure a new prize. There is action galore, moments of dry humor, and an incredible blend of computer and traditional animation. Spike's adventures are set to the very music that the series attempts to capture the spirit of- fabulous BEBOP. The music is such an important part of the series that it just wouldn't be the same without it. All in all, Cowboy Bebop offers a spectacular blend of adventure, humor, music, and drama!

Raised and trained by a Mitsurugi sword-style master, Kenshin decided to leave and fight for a new world when he reaches his teens. Soon, Kenshin becames one of the most feared assassins of the Tokugawa era -- for beneath the boyish frame and face lies a merciless killer of unparalleled skill. But something changes within Kenshin the day he meets Tomoe, a beautiful young woman who seems to have dark secrets of her own.   (  back to the regular story  ) Having annihilated countless people, his sword skills are second to none. His name alone is enough to strike fear into the hearts of citizens who've heard of his legendary abilities. But Kenshin&nbsp;was determined never to kill again, and he now uses his sword to protect people instead. As he roams Japan, he comes across the passionate Kendo instructor Kaoru Kamiya. Kaoru is immediately attracted to the wanderer, and Kenshin decides to stay for a bit to help Kaoru rebuild her father's dojo.

       Yo today was a good day, i talk to this chick named   Jessica   and man i think it went great, we where talk for 2 hours just getting to know each other. Man and shes freaky but in a good way freaky, but man i like her already i feel like i've known her for a long time. We talk about our interest, and i asked her what kind of guys does she like and she told me that she like's guys that make her laugh, and that are good to her and shes tickelish all over. knowing me i have a nasty mind i'am thinkin somewhere like downsouth lol if u know what i mean but if u don't then your dumb ne-wayz. yeah so from there she got to know me and i told her what i like about girls and what i like in girls and she met all the requirement. I love short girls with long hair and that are pretty. Reason for that i just feel like small girls look better and are sexier thats just me and i got good taste in girls, and in florida there are alot of short girls which is good. (oh yeah i'am not from florida and i'am not white)(I'am from New York and i'am   SPANISH   baby). Ne-wayz back to the story so from this point we are both feeling each other (Feeling means like) and i'am tellin her next time i got to New York i will see her and i send her a pic of me she told me i was cute and um she told me she would send me a pic of her in a   bathing suit  . and she said she looks good in a bathing suit i can't wait to get that pic but yeah that was what happened today and next time i will probably ask for her number u know the digits like pimps do lol.

So it's kool yeah and i had to talk to this chick called gessely, this girl i like from last year we had a quick talk about why she ain't call me and she told me her father took her phone away and she forgot my number. So i told her i would give her my number tomorrow and she said ok, now one thing during summer i told her i had to tell her somthing and by now i forgot what i was going to ask her. So i don't know whats going to happen and i'am kind of nervous because i really like this girl i me not like her i love her, and what i feel is true but i think she thinks i'am like all the other guys, and what i mean by that is she thinks guys are asses but i'am not like that she kind of gets the idea that i'am not and her friends know i'am not like the others.
