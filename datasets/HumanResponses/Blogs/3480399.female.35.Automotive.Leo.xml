      got the shoes *fixed* today. see, at the risk of sounding like a freak, i have a short leg. no i don't limp around. it's barely half an inch difference. you probably wouldn't even notice if i didn't tell you about it. i'm not totally defective. well, not my legs anyways...   but i digress . so i call to see if i can get my shoes fixed. and it's Memorial Day. i knew this and figured that the place would be closed but it wasn't. sorta. dude answers the phone and says yes, they are closed but he's there cleaning - bring the shoes in and he'll see what he can do. so in less than 10 minutes, he's done and i'm ready to go. fixed shoes and a rose from the lovely man's garden. he picked it himself this morning.   just when you think that everything in this world has gone to hell, you meet a man like that guy. Professional Shoe Repair Man. service with a smile while you wait. and a pretty sweet smelling flower too. all for only nine bucks. amazing.

      how the fuck does a man who has been gone for two freaking nights strait, leaving me to wander aimlessly around ALONE in my fucking house rationalize getting angry at me for being online instead of going to bed with him???  1. i'm not tired.   2. you didn't care to be around the last two nights, what's up your ass now?  honestly people. like i'm not stressed out enough already? is it Tuesday yet? can i go back to work yet?? thank god they are letting me work on Tuesday BTW. i almost cried when i heard that since Monday is my Regularly Scheduled Day Off, i was expected to stay home on Tuesday. crap. i'd have slit my fucking wrists...

      does THIS really surprise anyone? if it does, it shouldn't. m'kay?  Take the quiz:  urlLink "Your Psych-Ward diagnosis"     Anxiety Disorder  Diagnosis: General Anxiety Disorder. Excessive anxiety or worry occurring more days than not over a significant period of time. These worries can be associated with a number of events or activities. In addition, the individual finds it difficult to control the worry. Can be marked by physical signs of tension, hyperactivity, and lack of ability to respond in a positive or productive manner to problems or difficulties as they arise.

      hey. it looks like i can backdate things in here. hmmm. maybe i'll move some stuff from the Old Journal to this one. don't anyone freak out if stuff shows up in here before my *first post*. a lot of things from the Old Journal still apply to Life Now so why not?

        well now. it isn't what it sounds like. no i'm not boozing it up at 8 AM on a Sunday. call off the dogs all ready. sheesh!     coffee   dammit. that's what i need!   see, it's been a rough couple of days and i don't need a dirty messy house on top of things so i'm gonna get myself all caffeinated and do some major cleaning. i'm not sure about cleanliness being next to godliness but it sure as hell beats living in filth.

        this just in:   i'm an unfit mother.   yup. it's been tossed around for a while but it's official kids. i've been insulted for the last freeking time. if the kid thinks she'll be happier with her dad (who beat the hell out of me for most of our marriage BTW) so be it. i can't fight it anymore.   good luck to you my daughter. i hope he makes you happier than i did. but please remember this: i love you more than i can express and i fucking tried. the best i fucking could. and i'm so so sorry i failed you.

        i'm having a Mental Health Day. know what that means? it means i'm so mental, i'm gonna drink a ton of coffee and make my house and mind clean. i woke up and started the coffee at 7AM. pretty good since i have no where to go but i like to clean in daylight so i figured getting started was a good idea.   i was washing the dishes a minute ago (yes me, washing dishes. and trip on this: apparently, when all the cups and glasses got too piled up to fish out of the sink and drink out of, someone started rinsing out the pasta jars that wouldn't fit into the trash and started drinking out of them. good god. i'm living with barbarians!) and i noticed something:   i have an impressive collection of knives.   what is the significance of that you ask? wander out on the street, find someone with a lot of what appear to be self inflicted wounds. ask them. every cutter knows how important a good knife is in a crisis.    *Note: this was previously posted in the Old Journal.

        you know, the more time passes the more attractive this little idea becomes...   how hard would it be really to pack it all up, move to another state and never look back? i could change my name and start all over. of course, i'd need a job lined up first and a place to stay. details details.   but right now, at this moment, i'd love to get the fuck out of dodge. this place, this whole situation, is making me insane. and i'm not sure how much more i can take.    *Note: this was previously posted to the Old Journal

        criminy! i'm an idiot. a dolt. a moronic pissant. i can't believe i did this!   i was out doing laundry (cause i needed clean stuff) and when i was taking the clothes out of my trunk, i broke the effing key off in the lock! drat and double damn!   fortunately it only took an hour and only cost $79 to get a locksmith out there to save me. Jesus, you are my new best friend. i had him make me two keys too, so next time, i have a spare!    *Note: this was previously posted to the Old Journal     EDIT: however - it should be a precautionary notice to everyone out there in internetland with only one key for their car. THIS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU! had i been intellegent enough to have a spare made when i got the car, i would have saved a ton of time and money not to mention the stress i could have saved myself from. ok. that was my public service anouncement for the day. now, back to your regularly scheduled life.

      oh. my. fucking. god.  i did NOT see an advertisement on the back of a newspaper insert in my Sunday paper for vitamins specially made for all the  people  idiots on those low carb diets. oh yes i did! it was an add for  urlLink Centrum&#174 Carb Assist&#0153 . can someone just kill these low carb people? please?? let's just feed them some bread and maybe they will explode. m'kay?  honestly. trying to be healthy is one thing but this is effing  ridiculous . i swear i read that someone is currently in the process of genetically engineering  urlLink low carb potatoes  too. they should be available at a market near you in 2005!   what the hell is this world coming to? we haven't found a cure for cancer or aids or even a damn cold for crissake but insane amounts of money are being spent producing This Crap? and people are lining up to buy it too. *sigh.* someone really needs to put a stop to all this nonsense.

      ok. here's another little anecdote on how people are really weird about all things sexual - even the people who are supposed to be having all the sex:  i went to the store last night on my way home to pick up a few things and after i'd collected all the groceries i needed for the week i went on a quest for  urlLink condoms . i figured they were being held hostage in the pharmacy - it seemed the logical place - so i headed over there to get me some.  and this guy, pharmacy tech i guess (easy on the eyes and probably in his late twenties), looks at me and says:  "you finding everything all right? can i help you?"   so little miss "to the point" me says (loudly), "i need condoms? you hiding them back there now?"  so he opens his eyes sorta wide like he's surprised i said that or something and tells me that they don't keep them in the pharmacy but he has a few boxes of them for  *convenience* . now i don't know if he noticed my eyebrows raising at that comment, but they were. for convenience? is this dude hiding a stash for himself back there? so he can get his groove on at lunchtime and during his 15 minute breaks?? oh wait! he meant  MY  convenience! ooops.... roll with me people - i'm buying condoms here and that usually means i'm horny. and if i'm horny dammit, the whole world is horny with me!  but i digress. he pulls out a variety of boxes and lays them on the counter. then he proceeds to give me a run down on all of the different types. reservoir this, ribbed for her pleasure that, something for *climax control* over here, something for guys who need a whole lot of stimulation over there... a condom for every purpose under heaven! a veritable candy store of condoms on display!!  i look him strait in the eye, lower my voice and ask, "so. what do  you  suggest." 'cause that's his job right? so he asks me if i'm using them "primarily for pregnancy prevention" (i swear he said it just like that too - like he was reading it off of the box!) and i say yes of course, and he launches into a little thing i'd like to call : Cover Your Ass And Then Some.  "i like the ones with a spermicidal lubricant," he says "because then, even if you have some breakage, it's like an insurance policy, you know?" utter brilliance - this guy is The Man. and we go on to talk about how those lubricant thingies don't irritate my *sentative area* and whatnot - but how sweet of him to be concerned...  unfortunately, he doesn't have said condoms at his convenience so i need to go get them elsewhere in the store. he tries to direct me to the secret stash of condoms up at the front of the store and i swear to god he tells me they are near the fire logs! maybe i'm just a little weird but it seemed an *loaded* thing to say and i burst out laughing! he must have caught my drift because he promptly turned fifteen shades of crimson! fire indeed!! then the little sweetheart wanted to personally take me to where they were and no doubt demonstrate how to use them!  ok. maybe that last part was more my fantasy than actual reality. i have some artistic license here, right?  now let me tell you, i was pissed off the grocery workers for going on strike and inconveniencing me for six months. and i was pissed off specifically at the Vons workers because well, that's my local grocery store and they were the ones i saw every day with their picket signs and sour faces. but this one guy behind the pharmacy counter totally redeemed any bad residual feelings i had left over from the strike.  oh, and i got my condoms, but only after another eye opening experience with the cashier. she wasn't half as much fun tho. and no where near as cute.

      so i'm driving along spacing out with the radio on and i'm snapped back to consciousness by this:   "...for that late night booty chirp."   huh? THIS is how they are selling cellular phones now? who are the selling them to?? pimps and ho's?  urlLink Boost Mobile  has sunk to a new low in advertising i think.   i'm not black (see photograph) and this is obviously the segment of society they are aiming at, so i'm not as pissed off about it as some people should be. now, when they start advertising to crazy white girls with the  "for that just-past-midnight psychiatric emergency chirp"  tagline, i might have to throw a fit.

      someone asked me yesterday how i can do my job when i don't speak Spanish. hmmm. sure, there are a lot of people who prefer to speak their native tongue but you'd be damn surprised at how many of them speak an amazing amount of English when they have to.  honestly people. this is one of thoese Opinions That Get Me Into Trouble. if you come to my country you ought to learn the language. last time i checked, it was English. if you don't you are one of two things: stupid or lazy.  case in point: my dad came here from his country-which-will-remain-nameless at the age of 14 with a 6  th   grade education. he learned to speak English when he got here. ya, when he is among people from Nameless Country, they gab at one another in Nameless Language. i'm all for bilingualism. bi-anything really... ::wink wink:: i'm not trying to kill anyone's culture or ethnicity here. i'm just saying "when in Rome..."  anywho.  it just pisses me of when people expect me to cater to the crutch they created for themselves. i don't speak Spanish. i took two years of it in high school but i can't talk my way out of a paper bag. i don't intend to learn it either, except maybe more swear words - those are fun in any language!

      what the hell is up with the stinky people? come on! you gotta know you reek, right?   i got behind one of these people in line when i stopped at the store the other day (ironically to buy toothpaste and shampoo)and DAMN. was it offensive. and what trips me out is that they  *appeared* clean. which means, they took the time to wash their clothes and put on a new outfit but yet somehow, they just forgot to bathe. what's up with that? water got shut off at their pad this week? didn't seem important?? religious reasons??? throw me a bone here! that's false advertising!  and the worst part is, the people who got behind me in line probably couldn't tell who it was that was stinking up the joint! they might have thought that  i  was the stinky person!!! which is so not the case. i am very into hygeine, Thank You Very Much.   bleh. attention stinky people: if you are gonna be odoriferous, at least have the common decency to look as filthy as you smell. that way we can recognize you when we are coming your way and we won't be caught completely surprised by your unfortunate bouquet.

      ok. so i have pictures of me on this thing now. woo woo. i'm dan-ger-ous! uh huh. like if anyone i knew read this thing they wouldn't know it was me without the photos*. my humor and wit is unmistakable!  still, i'm trying to be a  little bit  anonymous here and posting my photograph might not be the smartest thing i ever did. but still again. there are a bazilllion blogs on the 'net and most people don't get into trouble for having them. (except  urlLink these people . YIKES! sorry guys.)  so in my defense: i don't talk smack about the people i work with (because they are genuinely terrific people), customers everywhere are a little wacky and i don't say anything too horrible about them anyways, and since i have no Internet access or computers with word programs on them in my office space, there is no possible way i could be blogging on the company dollar.  WHEW! i should be ok.  *oh yea, and i'm seriously ecstatic that people seem to like my photographs (getting complements was the last thing i expected when i put them up). but i need to know! am i  urlLink Hot or Not?  do tell!

      i want THAT on a t-shirt. not talking about beer tho. about my tits.   see, they are small-ish (34B) and not too perky anymore (i breast-fed for God's sake) but still, they are nice i suppose. i call the girls "twins"  and they are fraternal twins, not identical - one is slightly larger than the other - i understand that this is common. and when i say slightly i mean you wouldn't notice unless i was in front of you naked and you were being critical. which is something i do all the time. stand naked in front of myself being critical, that is. not in front of *you* sheesh! i don't even know your name!  ok. that was my observation from the shower today. toodles.

      i'm noticing that there are a whole hell of a lot of pregnant bloggers around right now. i hope i don't become one of them. (no offense ladies)  see, i finally convinced the husband that he reeeeally doesn't want kids. i love my daughter but i don't think i can do the teenage years again. that and my back is seriously fucked. probably not a good idea to be pregnant with metal rods in there. and i had frightening back labor last time, lets not even talk about it - i wince when i even  think  about it.  so anyways, the husband and i were getting it on last week - something i can assure you doesn't happen often... but there was a lack of condoms involved. yikes. i'll be fretting for another 3 weeks now until *girl time* starts. please send Not Pregnant thoughts people, i'm a little concerned here.

      ok. i'm feeling like crap.  i'm doing it again ya know. letting myself get sucked into a deep and horrible depression. over what? no idea. see, nothing is really bad enough to feel this shitty over. sure, things are tense in married-land on occasion but nothing that is going to end the world. i feel really mental lately too and i can't seem to stop acting like a needy pain in the ass. i really need a therapist to help me work out some of my issues before i drive everyone around me completely insane. maybe i'll go look for one tomorrow...

      is anyone else disturbed by the recent rash of reality shows coming out? i admit, i'm addicted to  urlLink Extreme Makeover  and  urlLink The Swan  is a trainwreck i got sucked into too but i'll be damned if i'm watching any of those infidelity glorifying ones. i mean common. isn't adultery a problem already all by itself? don't people screw up their marriages enough by themselves?? without any help from network television or a nationwide/worldwide audience??? do we have to make it into a game? it is  NOT  an effing game! these are  real people  with  real feelings  and  real lives  to go back to when the cameras stop rolling. jeeze people. have we really sunk that low?

      ya know, given the current trend of people getting fired for writing blogs, i'm pretty hesitant to mention my work in any way shape or form.  as you can see in my profile, i work in the automotive industry but i'm damn hesitant to say anything more specific.   i will tell ya tho that yesterday, my company's Internet dude came by my office and took a photo of me and it should be appearing soon, on the net, on the company webpage. so those of you who might actually know me in RL, keep your eyes peeled. thank god i looked pretty good since i had no idea that it was picture day!  i just hope to hell that this pic is better than the last one i had on a company page! last time i looked - it was even still there. and i haven't worked for that company for over a year. it's like that horrible yearbook photograph that never goes away...

      i went and had my very first bikini wax ever this afternoon.  just a basic one, nothing too daring. felt a little weird having my girlie bits exposed to the world and then having hair ripped out by the roots in a damn sensitive area but i admit - it looks pretty good and honestly didn't hurt as much as i thought it would. don't get me wrong tho - it definitely wasn't painless. think i'll be ready for a Brazilian any time soon?  there's your topic for the night - talk amongst yourselves...

      the man never shaves. oh he will if i beg but i shouldn't have to. most other men shave on a daily basis so it can't be that HUGE of an inconvenience.  i shave  godddammit! granted - not my face but other, shall we say, *sensative* areas... anywho.  well, lemme think about that for a second... sometimes  bathing  is an inconvenience for him i guess. (and the aroma is one hell of an inconvenience for ME i might add. i'll punctuate that thought with "...and you want me to do WHAT???) maybe shaving is just too big a job to do more than once a month. *sigh*  he likes to say he is growing a beard. ::rolls eyes:: no says i. a beard is one of those nicely trimmed things distinguished older men have. what you have is a Lack Of Grooming. or rather, what one might call "the homeless man's beard".  still love you honey. no more fucknut comments, ok? but PLEASE groom yourself a little for crissake. we have running water now doncha know...

      i'm not understanding why anyone would feel the need to make a CD with 14 full length CD's on it. lemme explain:  husband bought a new car stereo (because  fucknut  my sweetheart can't manage to remember to lock the doors at night but that's another rant). this new car stereo has the capability to play a CD-ROM with MP3's on it. so he made himself a CD-ROM with *gasp* 14 full length CD's crammed onto it. FOURTEEN.  why???? you can't possible find a song in that mess if you wanted to listen to it and very probably, every one of those CD's has a handful of less than stellar songs on it and a few that are strait out crap.   someone please enlighten me because i'm so totally not understanding his reasoning.

      common. if you've got that much cash, buy a house or a nice car. truth be told, most of the guys (it seems) dripping in gold drive a piece of shit and either live in an apartment or with their parents.  not only that, it's TACKY. wear a wedding band and a watch if you must but 15 gold chains around your neck and a ton of rings makes a man look like Mr. T. and if the diamond on your pinkie ring is blinding me, dude, you've gone too far.  comming soon: men who wear too much cologne.

      my bad habits:  i seriously drink too much coffee. perhaps i should just invest in a caffeine IV? maybe buy stock in  urlLink Starbucks . god knows i'm keeping them in business...  i smoke on occasion when i get terribly upset. (tho i usually remember half way into the cigarette why i quit - YUCK!)  sometimes i drink excessively. like when i'm terribly upset. i quit drinking all together a few weeks ago. i'm too depressed about my situation at home to be a happy drunk. i recognize that it just makes things worse so until i have things more under control, i'm just gonna say "no".  i probably don't eat anywhere near enough.  i probably don't sleep as much as i should.  i worry about what people think of me too much.  i stress on mistakes. (even tiny ones no one else would even notice or care about)  i get neurotic about order and clean. if my surroundings aren't orderly and clean, i can't focus.  i'm sure i'll be adding to this list in the future. i'm a mess. i actually asked the question of a friend a while back and he was kind enough to answer me. his bad habits are no where near as bad as mine are tho. Not Even Close.   i think i'm secretly (or not so secretly) hoping that the rest of the world is as screwed up as i am. i seriously need a therapist. too bad i can't afford one.

        i didn't know they were either. see, you learn something new every day.  did anyone catch Amish in the City on Wednesday night? whoa nelly! this is gonna be fun i think. i was a little surprised by the clothes tho. since when do nice Amish girls wear bikinis? and when they put the Amish clothes on the city kids, how dare that one chick still look hot. oh i'll get all their names strait eventually but so far my fave is Mose. dude almost drowns and still gets back into the water. go Mose! my hero. *swoon* he can plow my field anytime!  uh. so long as he doesn't speak while he's plowing. the boy has one interesting inflection! YOW.  "inflEction" comes from the Latin  inflectere  which means "to bend" by the way. doesn't have anything to do with a beating - that would be an inflIction. see y'all learned more new stuff. how fun. but i digress...  Ruth about killed me tho when she was crying at the beach because ummm. she was At The Beach. now, i like the ocean and all but it's never moved me to tears to see it. of course, i've never lived in AmishLand either so maybe that was it.  and have you noticed that they (Amish Kids) almost all have Biblical names? except Randy. where the hell did that name come from??? eh, the names didn't  really  surprise me. i sorta expected that actually. the Amish kid in the camouflage "I (heart) BEER" shirt, well now, THAT surprised me!  i enjoyed the show quite a lot but of course, you can't please everyone all the time and some Christian people are really upset about the whole thing.   urlLink  Damn Christians   . they think that the Amish kids are being taken advantage of, exploited to some degree and mocked. i didn't see anyone up in arms about stupid people being exploited or made fun of when That Other Show started tho, did you? maybe they should go save   urlLink  Paris and Nicole    before they jump on this new horse and buggy.

        now  urlLink this  is kinda sick.  ok ok ok, i'm pro choice so before anyone jumps on my back about a woman's right to choose... thing is, it's tasteless. honestly, what kind of person is gonna wear this? my money is on some slut that has them for fun. certainly not me or anyone with a mind and heart. it's just cruel. and it's not the sort of thing that i think ought to be broadcast to the masses. it is (or SHOULD be) a private matter.  just because i think it's ok to have an abortion (if it is your choice) doesn't mean i think it's ok to throw it in the face of anyone who's ever had one because of a pregnancy caused by incest or rape. what about the people who wanted the baby but it was so genetically messed up that they had one because they would have miscarried eventually or if being pregnant was a threat to the life of the woman? and it would really make someone who is infertile and trying their ass off to get pregnant feel shitty.  it's just not cool people. so so so terribly un-cool. Planned Parenthood just lost my respect.   UPDATE: i just checked the link for the t-shirt page and it seems that Planned Parenthood has a statement there now which leads me to believe that they recieved a LOT of complaints about this effed up shirt. personally, i don't care what their "excuse" is, it's still a fucked up thing to sell.

        ok so i'm watching TV and that Total commercial comes on where the people are trying to enjoy their regular cereal but when they ask for it, the person serving it brings out all the millions of bowls they have to consume to get the same nutritional value of one bowl of  urlLink Total . bleh.   gimme a break people. take a freaking multivitamin and enjoy your bowl of Frosted Flakes already!   ANYWAYS...   when i saw the Total commercial, me and The Husband were watching a documentary about octopuses on PBS (octopi? baby eagles are called eaglets BTW. i learned that on the Discovery Channel when we had cable TV for a brief stint there) and i made a comment about how i thought that Sigmund the Sea Monster was probably an octopus and not a squid like some people thought. Husband looked at me like i was a mad woman!    "Now, Sigmund the Sea Monster and Johnny and Scott are friends      The finest of friends that ever can be on the land or on the sea

        i love my husband. sometimes he really *gets it*. last night, when i got home from work, my house was picked up. not totally clean like an insane person came in and sterilized it, but he'd obviously put some time into cleaning for me which is exactly what i asked for as my Ultimate Birthday Gift. *swoon* what a sweetheart!!!   then we ordered dinner from my favorite Mexican restaurant, stuffed ourselves when it got here and then went to bed.   honestly, i complain about the guy too much and rarely offer any praise for him but you see, that's sorta how it goes. most people (i think) don't write about the normal day to day things that are GOOD. they bitch and moan about stuff that is BAD or that BOTHERS them. i am indeed one of those people.   so i'd like to take a moment to say:   "Hubby, i love you." and,   "thank you for everything you do". and,   "i don't really mean it when i tell you to take your dirty socks and get the fuck out of my sight." or "go live with your mom if you are gonna be such an asswipe."   ok. i've never actually called the guy an "asswipe" but you get the picture, right?

        over at   urlLink  Momster   , some important things have been said today. i can't count how many times i've screamed at The Husband: "stop buying me flowers and pick up your fucking socks!!!!"   jeeze guys. we don't all wear "Golddigger" t-shirts and expect everything money can buy. sometimes all we want is a clean house, a kind word and a little gentlemanly attention. so next time you want to buy me something honey,  don't . pick up after yourself, tell me i'm beautiful and open a door for me now and again. that's all i REALLY want.   ya, call me old fashioned if you must but it's the truth. i never wanted equal rights. i'm just a girl and that's all i've ever wanted to be. if being able to wear pants in public and own property has taken away my right to be treated like a woman should be, i don't want any part of it, thank-you-very-much.

        there is this laundromat down the street from me -&nbsp;i might have mentioned it before -&nbsp;that we used to call the "tweek-o-mat" because it was open 24 hours and all the meth heads used to hang out in there washing their clothes when they couldn't sleep in the middle of the night. i know all about this place because honestly, me and my friends used to do our laundry and drink beer in there back in the day too. it was a regular zoo back then...  &nbsp;  anywho. i wandered in there a couple of weeks ago because all the other laundromats in town were full and i had a car&nbsp;loaded with&nbsp;clothes to wash and i was running out of places to look into washing them in. my god was i surprised! the place is freshly painted, has all new machines and even real live plants and flowers decorating it! and they even changed the hours of operation - i believe that they are now only open until 11PM.  &nbsp;  i guess some things do change and sometimes, they even change for the better.

        well, i finally did something productive with my weekend. i'm pleased to report that in addition to sitting around drinking coffee and goofing around on line, i actually accomplished something.  &nbsp;  i just got out of the shower 'cause i finally dyed my hair again and that activity makes a shower a really good idea when i'm done. i've been trying to get off my ass and dye it for weeks so this is one hell of an accomplishment, lemme tell ya!  &nbsp;  i did mention at some point that i'm not a natural redhead right? my undyed hair is blond BTW&nbsp;and&nbsp;it makes people stare blankly and blink when&nbsp;they hear&nbsp;that. like i'm crazy for dying it red when i should just leave it be.&nbsp;now i haven't actually seen this blond hair in decades - i've been dying it that long - but i have little kid pictures of me and all my lovely blond hair for proof. so there.  &nbsp;  anyways, back to the dying of the hair... i swear it looks like someone died in my bathtub. and it must have been a terrible violent death, too.&nbsp;red  everywhere ! and i don't know where the body is now but it must be bald because there was enough hair in my drain to cover a head or two. how on earth do i still have hair if all of it is ending up in the drain!?!?  &nbsp;  i&nbsp;used a different red this time&nbsp;and i'll have to wait until it dries to get the full effect but so far, i think it looks pretty good. lighter, brighter, more intense! just in time for summer! i sorta sound like an ad for hair dye now, don't i? i wonder when  urlLink Feria  is gonna cut me a check...

        oh lord. you can't make this stuff up. whenever i get really bored and have nothing to amuse me, i can always count on a politician to do something  urlLink laughable .  &nbsp;  here's the quote and a brief response from the Democrats:  &nbsp;    "If they don't have the guts to come up here in front of you and say, 'I don't want to represent you, I want to represent those special interests, the unions, the trial lawyers... if they don't have the guts, I call them girlie men," Schwarzenegger said to the cheering crowd at a mall food court in Ontario.   Democrats responded that Schwarzenegger's comments were insulting to women and gays and distracted from budget negotiations.        seriously tho, does anyone really think it's an insulting remark? i thought it was funny. reminded me of the    urlLink SNL    skit and i laughed. LAUGHED! people need to lighten up. every comment made does not necessarily have evil intent behind it. he's a body builder. the skit on SNL poked fun at HIM and the "girlie men" tag was used to&nbsp;refer to people who don't measure up. see the correlation? i did.     so&nbsp;why not use a recognizable line in a public speech to talk a little smack about people who aren't doing their job? he&nbsp;used various recognizable lines&nbsp;all thru his campaign remember? and no one was pissed off about it. slightly annoyed after a while but anywho... i'll tell ya why it caused a ruckus this time: because those lawmakers&nbsp;ARE "girlie men". and they can't take a joke.&nbsp;

        the cops showed up at my front door about an hour ago looking for some parolee using my address. now, i wasn't shocked by this because well, it happens a lot. my neighborhood is interesting like that... the funny part is, i'm still strolling around in a bra and not much else so when one of the dudes peeked into the pad to scan the place and see who was here, he got a pretty big&nbsp;eyeful of a less-than-dressed me! his mouth immediately fell open and he jerked back quickly, stammering: "uhhh, OH! sorry!!!"   so i quickly pulled on some clothes and tried to answer all their questions about the parolee who doesn't live here to the best of my knowledge, 'cause i try to be helpful like that when i can. plus, i like that  urlLink The Man  is looking for someone who is not, ummm... ME. i used to have a lot of fun with those guys back in the day tho my *menacing behavior* usually involved alcohol and a lack of modesty, not any huge dangerous crime necessitating a search for me in other people's apartments. but i digress...   the Husband says i should probably put some clothes on. i think i ought to be able to wander around my own house half naked without the fuzz sticking their head into my biznazz.   eh, no harm done and now those guys have something to talk about over coffee later on tonight. see, i figure when you look at it under the right light, i'm really just a concerned citizen doing my small yet colorful part to support the local police force. an entertainer of sorts, raising eyebrows and spreading smiles. aren't i sweet?

        and maybe a couple other things... ::wink wink::     &nbsp;   ok. i'm still sitting in front of the computer. i can see that this is quickly becoming yet another unproductive day. my coffee tastes great tho. *swoon*  &nbsp;  i think i'm gonna shop online now and see if i can't get a new band for my watch. it's pretty scratched up and it's bothering me. seems they don't sell the one i need in regular watch stores anymore and you gotta go directly thru  urlLink Swatch¬©  to get one now. i found out that little gem of information at the watch store in the mall yesterday while i was out buying that sexy new bra i was wearing last night.  &nbsp;  and oh, The Husband didn't notice when i put the shirt on,&nbsp;he was already asleep on the couch. ::cough cough:: scantily clad wife over here! and she's horny as all hell too!! *sigh* shouldn't he be at some kind of sexual peak right about now? he's only 24 for crissake.

        i was out buying coffee this morning. yup. i amazed myself too. up, dressed and out of the house at 9AM on a Sunday. will wonders never cease? i'd have never been out there tho if the unimaginable didn't happen:  i  *gasp*  ran out of   coffee!  the horrors, i tell you. The Horrors!  &nbsp;  so i've got the coffee safely in my basket and i'm shopping for coffee "accessories" and i get to the dairy aisle. i decide to get some cream because truthfully, it tastes oh, so much finer than milk and i was feeling like i  needed  deserved&nbsp;a reward for being out of the house at such an ungodly hour on my day off. as i was perusing the selections i noticed that they have regular Half and Half and Fat Free Half and Half. ummm. correct me if i'm wrong here people, but isn't fat-free cream something like...&nbsp;MILK?  &nbsp;  so i decide on the regular stuff and i turn around and some man is looking at me. i smile, cause i'm still sorta asleep and he says "five nine and a half! am i close?" WHAT??? what the hell is this guy talking about? am i on a hidden camera show again? is it&nbsp;some crazy psychotic version of  urlLink Jeopardy  this time and the old dude is screaming out random answers at me?  &nbsp;  so i figure out that he has been trying to guess my height. yup. at Vons, at 9AM on a Sunday. criminy. THIS is why i don't leave the house unless i have to. i'm only 5'8" by the way. that guy was a good&nbsp;inch and a half off. i sure hope that question he was trying to answer wasn't the Daily Double...

        just to keep you updated on the 'hood situation here: Poor Dude was getting another earful from Bitchy Woman last night. not sure what he did this time but a few other neighbors were in the alley below their apartment making (loud and possibly drunken) comments about them and occasionally yelling their own opinions on the situation at Bitchy Woman. i'm telling ya, they really let the loons out last night...&nbsp;Bitchy Woman didn't seem to appreciate their input either!  &nbsp;  messed me up a bit tho because i was&nbsp;trying to be *ahem* "busy with myself" at the time. and boy, do i hate a distraction. i actually found myself unable to get anything done and i had to wait until they finished their little press conference before i could get down to serious business.  &nbsp;  oh and did i mention? i'm a sexual deviant according to The Husband.&nbsp;that and i probably practice a bit too much "self-love" for his comfort. apparently, i'm just a little freakier than most girls he's encountered. i'm just not getting it tho.&nbsp;my big deviant request this week? here it is:&nbsp;i want him to&nbsp;cum on my ass. i thought guys liked that sort of thing. go figure...

        it's been hot out. and i've been siting here in front of the computer wearing nothing but a push up bra from  urlLink Victoria's Secret  and a pair of low slung work-out pants for the last two hours.  &nbsp;  i love Victoria's Secret and they have this new bra (which i bought two of tihs afternoon and am now wearing) that is advertised as "a push up without pads". gads! i hate those pad thingies!! it's probably what keeps me from owning push up bras most of the time to tell you the truth. i hate feeling like i'm lying. i might not have much but i like to be real. this baby pushes the titties up and out. i think the girls look pretty perky and nice in it. *pats titties softly and smiles*  &nbsp;  but wait! it's finally starting to get chilly in here so i might have to go put a shirt on now. think the Husband will notice?

        so what's up with Blogger here? all the posting junk has changed! i hope my stuff still looks the same, sorry if it doesn't until i get this situation under control.  &nbsp;  and i noticed something else too. what's up with the banners? does someone sit around deciding which ones are appropriate for which blogs??? could it possibly be coincidence and i'm just not getting enough drama at home so i'm inventing paranoid conspiracy theories again?  &nbsp;  because over  urlLink here , Ordinary Joe, who blogs a lot about his x, has "relationship problem" banners and today i noticed that i have one for  urlLink Del Amo Hospital  and&nbsp;another one&nbsp;advertising therapy for Bipolar disorder! what the hell!?! i'm not even suffering from BPD, people! i'm depressed, remember?&nbsp;     i can only guess that the people with blank banners with no ads on them are paid members and because of that the folks at BlogSpot are not allowed to have fun with them. how do i go about getting me a  urlLink Starbucks  banner and another one for  urlLink psychotropic medication ? can i put in a request somewhere?

        i've come to the conclusion that my neighbors are crazy.  all  of them. i used to think that only the Crazy Guy neighbor was fully insane but i've changed my position on things a bit.  &nbsp;  seems we have this guy living across the alley. lets call him Poor Dude. his girlfriend/wife/woman is a bitch. let's call her Bitchy Woman. well. Bitchy Woman likes to yell at Poor Dude. a LOT. about everything under the sun. usually at 4 in the morning. personally, i'm ready to let Poor Dude move in and sleep on our couch has to be better than his house. at least it would be quiet here.  &nbsp;  what possesses Poor dude to even stay with Bitchy Woman anyways?&nbsp;i used to think it had to be because she was outrageously attractive (guys are sometimes stupid like that) and i used to think that Poor Dude must be doing something to piss her of 24/7 because no one could possibly be that much of a shrew without provocation.  &nbsp;  but&nbsp;my position on that has changed as well. because she yelled at ME last week. i didn't know it was her at first. when she yelled at me i was pretty annoyed with her seeing as i had no clue who she was and all i did was ask her child to stop kicking flaming fireworks into the side of my oh-so-flamable home. but then i recognized it. it was HER! i recognized that bitchy screeching voice! and when i looked at her, i thought to myself, what the hell is Poor Dude doing with THAT???  &nbsp;  wow. i thought Crazy Guy was a total nutcase but Poor Dude has him beat.&nbsp;living with Bitchy Woman&nbsp;all this time has got to be&nbsp;some&nbsp;crazy-ass shiznit. that is one guy who hasn't got a snowball's chance in hell of pleasing his woman, and yet he stays with her and puts up with all of&nbsp;her mindless crap. and i never hear him yell back either, he just pleads with her to stop yelling at him. he probably pays the rent on top of things too. now THAT is crazy. boy oh boy. it sure as hell puts MY feeble little slice of&nbsp;insanity to shame.

        honest to god. a bug just walked across my desk and looked at me before scurrying away! pesky critter. lets all just hope it doesn't come back and start posting to my Blog later while i am at work!   gads. it's not like the place is dirty exactly, just terribly terribly  messy . and i've got to do something about it before it gets to the Point Of Driving Me Insane. i just haven't had the energy to clean anything. i've got newspapers and dirty clothes piling up here people!   fortunately, since The Husband and i both work a ton, we are not home much so consequently, neither one of us really eats here making for very few dirty dishes, save for the million and a half coffee mugs i manage to dirty up every week!   the situation would be much improved if The Husband would kindly take out the trash (hubby, you reading this??) because if he did, i would have somewhere to put all of the other trash that needs a place to live. lets start there, shall we?   why this constant battle with the taking out of the trash anyways? it is the man's job, is it not? that and the fact that my back is fucked and i'm not supposed to be carrying heavy awkwardly shaped things like monster trash bags. because you know that little trash bags wouldn't dare reside here. oh no. if we could move a dumpster in, Husband would be great with that. as it is, we use the 33 Gallon variety which in my opinion, is plenty big.   basically, this is The Deal: if i let the place get too messy, the situation reaches Critical Mass and i cease being able to function and then i loose my mind. it's happened before and it isn't pretty so i must be careful not to let that happen. i  really  need to clean some this weekend. i really really do.

        today sucked ass.   and can someone  please  remind me how bad today sucked ass next time i get all possessed and think i can just "funeral" all morning and then go to work like a normal person for the second half of the day. please? because it just won't ever ever happen. just  WON'T . next time i definitely need to take the whole freaking day off.   i swear, if anyone truly close to me dies and i have to attend their funeral, i'll need to be sedated or i'll completely have a nervous breakdown. seriously, i handle funerals  that  badly.   i'm sorry, i'll try to be more interesting tomorrow. good night.

        i've seen this quiz floating around the blog circuit for a while and figured it was about time for me to jump on the latest fad and take it myself. i'll agree with my results too, frightening as they sound! most people have never seen my massive mean streak (and probably never will) but rest assured, it does exist. takes quite a bit to provoke me tho, thank goodness.

        ok. we all know i'm horribly obsessed with my   urlLink  SiteMeter    right? so i must ask. according to said site meter an unknown person at IP 207.199.2. pops by on a fairly regular basis. identify yourself please. if you aren't up to leaving a comment at least drop me a line via   urlLink  e-mail   , m'kay? and if you have a blog, leave me a link and i'll haunt yours as well. fair enough? :)

        funerals are weird. i mean, isn't it kind of strange that we as a civilized people still put our deceased loved ones out on display?   i'm bringing this up because hubby's grandmother passed away on Friday and is having her funeral tomorrow. why do people say that anyways "passed away"? criminy, she died, ok? i know that i personally have no intention of passing away. i fully intend to kick the proverbial bucket. please don't tell anyone that i passed away, it sounds like i farted.   but i digress. i wandered on to a tangent as it were. back to the display thing. it just seems odd that anyone would want their mother/wife/child put out like that. oh, i fully understand the wanting to say goodbye part of it which is why i think that they do the "viewing" thing for the family and close friends, i'm just not understanding the open casket at the funeral. too many people who could be seen as "strangers" show up at those things and it seems kinda icky that anyone driving by can just pop in and take a peek.   i've got a lot of issues with funerals i think because as someone who has actively tried to *put myself into a funeral sort of way* on more than one occasion, i'm a little fascinated by the whole process. i went so far with this fascination that i married an embalmer (Husband #2). he turned out to be kinda psycho but i learned a lot about the Funeral Industry thru him. including but not limited to the fact that most people in that Industry are full fledged party animals. don't let that calm respectful demeanor fool you, these people aren't all about death (tho most of them seem to have a pretty dark sense of humor - as witnessed by the "Put the FUN back in Funeral" t-shirt more than a few of them seem to have) and they know how to live life. maybe because they've seen so many deaths, who knows. back to Grandma...   i hear that the Grandmother wrote her own obit years before and that it was only updated and brushed up a bit before it ran in the paper. (they even added my name to it which is odd all by itself since the news that i married the Husband last year only came out this week) that's kinda neat in a rather morbid way. i'm thinking that i should be penning my obit too, just in case, because you never really know when your time is up and no one would do me more justice than i would do myself.

        i've learned a few very important lessons since i started this new fangled job in February. i'm gonna share the first three that come to mind:   the first thing i learned was that it is ok to make a little mistake or two so long as it can be rather easily fixed within the company.   the second thing i learned was that it is NOT ok to make big mistakes involving customers and their money. one person who was misfortunate enough to be on the making end of that mistake was fired before my eyes. YOW!   the third thing i've learned is what a flywheel looks like. neat! i always wondered that! now i want someone to explain to me why they are so damn expensive to replace. they just don't *look* expensive. maybe i'll ask a mechanic - there are plenty of them around me, that's for sure!

        i'm getting a little weird about the white teeth thing again. see, i drink an obscene amount of coffee and my teeth don't look   urlLink  this bad    yet but lets just say, they aren't sparkling and gleaming white anymore.   so i bought the   urlLink  Crest¬Æ Whitestrips¬Æ    because i'd read positive things about them and i did the put-the-sticky-things-on-my-uppers-and-lowers dance quite religiously for a few days last month but true to form, i flaked out and stopped. *sigh* i did notice an improvement tho and the memory of that improvement inspired me to dust off the box and stick those babies on my not so pearly whites today.   it doesn't take much to make me happy and i really want to be happy! give me the white teeth! the kind of white teeth that would make   urlLink  Donny and Marie    "oooo!" and "ahhhh!"   that's all i want today. that's it. just the white teeth. is that really too much to ask?

        oh for the Love Of God.   i swear. it's just The Creator's little way of   urlLink  getting back at us    for all the crazy medical advances we've made. He's shaking His head and laughing to HimSelf right now: "ha ha ha HA! thinning the herd motherfuckers! thinning the herd!" He's probably also scratching His head and asking HimSelf: "why won't these people effing DIE more often for crissake? didn't i make those damn horns sharp e-freeking-nough??? " damn. imagine God (effectively and colorfully) saying "for Christ's sake" about ANYTHING. now that's funny as hell. LOL   oh, and the husband - who was summoned into The Office to help with a title for this entry - he did a miserable job by the way, see for yourself *sheesh* - says that it's probably just some kind of population control. because if no one dies they (allegedly) do it again  repeatedly  until someone does. it's an annual event he says but someone has gotta die (and i think he might be making this up to tell the truth) or they keep it going until someone cashes in. then and only then is it OVER until next year! Gads. is that cool or what? go Spain!   can we start that up in California? we need to dispose of a few idiots here too. he might be wrong he says, but what the hell, everyone is entitled to a harebrained (or hairbrained, depending upon your frame of reference) theory every once in a while and he just might have something here...   i'm feelin' kinda saucy tonight. watch out world here i come!

        it's come to my attention that as of late, i masturbate   urlLink  as much as most guys do    - possibly MORE - depending upon the guy!   who knew. of course, my self-love habit waxes and wanes like the tide on a regular basis. this weeks bounty could well fade into next week's famine in the blink of an eye. who knows why (least of all,  ME ) but for now, i'm gettin' down with my bad self just like one of the boys.   it's true i guess ::shrug:: but things DO change ya know... check back next week. maybe i'll be a frigid old hag by then. but until then, i better stock up on them   urlLink  C size batteries   !

        went to the   urlLink  Olive Garden    for dinner last Sunday night. and it just wasn't the Olive Garden experience i have become accustomed to. i'm still confused about the whole thing.   first, the waiter brings us our water and he puts forth no coasters. i was perplexed. i have always gotten coasters in the past, so wtf? i'm still trying to get over it when my real drink arrives. (a vanilla Italian soda which was delish by the way.) but no coaster for that glass either! hey! what the hell is this??   so next our salad arrives and *gasp* there is no cheese grater in sight! no freshly grated cheese for my salad? i wasn't sure what to make of this either. surely they can't be completely out of cheese. i swear i see other people getting their salad cheesed. WHAT is going on here!?   i mention something to the husband and he's sorta wondering himself but it obviously hasn't become as big an issue in his mind as it has in mine. i'm looking around at this point to see if other people got coasters and i spy a cheese grater lying unattended a couple tables away from us. now, i did entertain the idea of swiping said grater and appropriately adorning my naked salad with cheese but i decided against that option in favor of asking the waiter the next time he strolled by. problem was, every time he did, my mouth was full! i swear, he was doing it on purpose!   so our soups arrive and hmmm. his looks just like mine! curious since his was supposed to be some sausage type zuppa or something and mine was minestrone. this is just unheard of. i've never been brought the wrong food before. something is very wrong here. very wrong indeed.   ok wait a second here. i wondered aloud: have i been X'd or what? is someone trying to antagonize me until i snap and start freaking out? is the waiter going to rip off his mask to reveal a wickedly grinning   urlLink  Jamie Kennedy   ? am i on some hidden camera show or what here! this is just far to strange. i know i'm a little paranoid but seriously - i was looking around for the hidden cameras so much that i lost interest in my fricking meal!   i've come to expect a certain type of service at the Olive Garden and this just wasn't it. maybe we'll have to go back next weekend and see if they haven't gotten back to normal. hopefully they were just having a bad day. i'll keep you posted.

        well now. everyone can relax. i'm not bringing yet another life into this world (or having to kill myself at the prospect of it). The Period hath arrived and i can now be happy. crampy, bloated and irritable, but  happy .   and it would seem that   urlLink  Momster    and i are on the same icky page as it were. kudos to both of our womanly selves.   i bet that was way too much information. sorry about that! i'm just so damn relieved, i had to tell someone. you can all get back to your lives now, and i'll try to be less gross later.

        i got ice cream yesterday at   urlLink  31 Flavors    and i swear, i thought that person waiting on me in there was a girl with a serious mustache. i was trying to keep myself from staring but my god! she put the husband to shame in the facial hair department!   turns out she was a guy tho. a sorta feminine guy but male just the same and perfectly entitled to all the facial hair he wanted to sport. maybe he should work out some, or wear manly clothes so as to not confuse the simpletons of the world such as myself. eh, kept my brain occupied and i laughed about it later so it was well worth the momentary confusion i suppose.   my ice cream was yummy too by the way.

        i'm sitting here in front of my computer while the whole world explodes outside my front door. i swear to freaking god, it sounds like a warzone out there!   i wonder where these people get the stuff they are lighting up sometimes. some of the neighborhood displays seriously rival the professional jobs! last year while puppy-sitting for the Brother and his Lovely Wife i was treated to a show that was a hundred times better than anything i've seen put on by the pros and it lasted damn near an hour and a half! are these people made of money? that shit's gotta cost a fortune!   the Crazy Guy in my complex was up on his roof earlier - laughing and screaming at all the fireworks just like he does every single year - checking for potential firestarters up there. given the potential for them on the 4th, i'm amazed every year by how few fires there actually are too. you'd think there would be a lot more.   it would suck to be a cop tonight. where the hell do you go first? bottle rockets over here, cherry bombs over there. sparks flying overhead in a thousand different directions! law and order will have to wait until tomorow i guess - i'd say the pursuit is pretty futile tonight!

        why yes i did! and it's like a litle slice of heaven tossed in a blender and served up with a straw.   i went to Starbucks a couple days ago and they are now serving ::drumroll please::   urlLink  Frappuccino¬Æ Light Blended Coffees   ! seems they've changed the mix over there so it now has fewer calories and fat. tastes exactly the same tho. *swoon* is it at all possible that i didn't love the frapp enough already? i even treated myself to a Javachip which is something i don't usually do since the calorie count was previously too SINFUL.   so now the only guilt i'm gonna have to suffer with as i sip my way to Nirvana will be over the nearly four bucks i spent on a cup of frozen coffee.

       yes, i said haunted.  lemme tell you why. my sweet kitty Harley died on Valetine's Day this year. very sad story, maybe i'll repost it to this Blog someday (it was previously seen in The Old Journal and still lives there) but i digress.  Harley had  urlLink CRF . a truly despicable disease. and try as she might to get to her litter box, she would sometimes not make it and have to pee in my hallway. i know, gross. but you overlook the gross things when you love someone. towards the end, i was just happy she was peeing at all. her poor failing kidneys...  so now i'm hearing this peeing sound in my hallway all the time. what the hell? she can't curl her ghost-self up next to me while i am sleeping? perhaps knock stuff off of my coffee table on occasion? she needs to ghost-pee in my hallway now?  well, Harley was a strange one when she was alive and i guess death hasn't changed her. i suppose that is a good thing and a blessing in disguise. i know  i  don't want to change when i eventually get dead so maybe it's just her way of telling me that some things never change, even when you die.  thanx Harley. you always knew exactly what i needed even if you expressed yourself in a sorta *unique* fashion.

       i think i'm gonna go shopping and buy me some clothes because i hate doing laundry and if i buy new clothes i won't have to wash the old ones today and it's getting late to start that kind of madness anyways. it's never too late to shop tho. so long as something is open. yay!  oh wait. The Husband will still need clean boxers and socks (yes that's right ladies, he's a boxers man. no briefs in sight in this house) and if i don't do laundry he will have to do what is known as " urlLink freeballing " in men's circles.

" urlLink fucktastic ." is it a  real  word? probably not. should it be a  real  word? in one word: YES.  and last but definitely not least:  if i clean my house today and empty off my dresser top in the bedroom, i can move a TV in there and watch porn in bed. now wasn't that the most Sunday thought of all?

       hold on to yourselves: i ran out of cream for my coffee again! GAH!! which made a trip to the market necessary. Good Lord. i hate shopping on a Sunday but as we all know, coffee is my life's blood and i like to take it with a whole lotta cream and sugar, thank-you-very-much.  and as always, a trip to the grocery store has spurred yet another interesting verbal exchange with The Husband.  i'm still not understanding the Fat Free Cream. he keeps saying that it's a good thing because people need to watch their fat intake (keep in mind this is the same guy who argued for  urlLink Low Carb Soda ). i counter with the fact that one needs a certain amount of fat in their diet to be healthy. he fires back with "don't you think that people get enough fat in their diet already?" to which i answer, "well,  not if they keep eating all this fat free crap !"  another happy Sunday.

       dude. Rick James is dead. how super-freaky is that? i'll never forget when i first saw him on MTV looking all glittery and dewy and then when i saw him years later when he was on Court TV for burning some broad with his crack pipe.  gads. nostalgia is getting the better of me again. *sniff*  seriously tho. i didn't think the guy was all that old. and he seemed to have started to get his life back together too. it's sad when people who remind me of my younger days start kicking off. makes me feel kinda old. and dammit, i HATE that feeling.

       The Husband is a brilliant man. yes he is.  the godforsaken alarm has finally been defeated. and all he had to do was SHUT OFF THE POWER FOR THE WHOLE FREAKING BUILDING. yes, that's right kids. the whole building had to have it's power tuned off so that the Damn Alarm would reset itself. so now we have silence.  ahhhhhhh... just listen to it.  damn fuckwad neighbor deprived me of that for nearly half an hour. *SIGH* my headache and i are going to bed...

        ok. Crazy Guy is paranoid. Paranoid with a capital P. as i type this, some kind of an alarm is going off in his garage but he isn't home to turn it off. it's almost 11PM here - far too late for this kind of racket. let me describe it to you:  WHEEE OOOHH... WHEEEEE OOOOHH... WHEEE OOOHH... WHEEEEE OOOOHH...  over and over and over and over etceteras.  and for what? i have no idea. someone touched his door knob i suspect. maybe tried to sample his weed.  loud mother effer. if i had a gun, i'd be loading it and waiting for him to get home.  eventually, someone is gonna call the cops. and i might just have to kiss them after they break down the door and smash that thing. 'cause it's driving me insane. and i didn't have far to go to begin with.  right about now, i wish i lived in the middle of nowhere without a neighbor for miles. yes. that would be heaven right about now...

        ok so what is it with  urlLink  the crap   they are selling on TV   these days? and why do i get all sucked in and have to watch the same infomercial a million times even tho i've already seen it, ummm. a million times?  like the  urlLink Power Juicer‚Ñ¢.  is Jack LaLanne a freakazoid or what? actually i think he might be a robot or something. honestly. who is dressing this man? lose the belted jumpsuit m'kay. might have been ok in the 70's when you had that other show but...  or the other  urlLink juicer thingie . the one with the guy with the crazy eyebrows. do somethin' about that would ya,   gramps  ? you are scaring the children.  Husband is particularly fond of the one selling  urlLink those knives . Husband wants those knives Oh So Bad. personally, i cringe every time i watch it because of all the good food they just keep disposing of down the hole at the end of the cutting table. but every time we are channel surfing and the show is on, Hubby needs to watch it so he drools and i cringe at least once a week.  and don't even get me started on the  urlLink Home Shopping Channel . hoo boy. i get roped into those before and after makeup presentations like you would not believe. i'm amazed every single time at how horrendous those poor women look after the stuff gets spackled to their faces. and people actually buy this garbage?  thank god i don't buy any of this crap tho. i'm not that far gone yet i guess. when the day comes that i feel compelled to actually purchase one of these marvels, someone needs to smash my phone-dialing fingers with a mallet, take the credit cards away from me and find me a little bit of professional help.

        i'm not a hugely political person but i have a few views that i feel pretty strongly about.  at the top of my list is the fact that i think everyone should have health care they can afford. even crazy people like me. well, maybe especially crazy people like me.  i'm a little mental in case you didn't notice. but mental people are people too and dammit, we need some help sometimes. it sucks tho that crazy people have such a bad rap. and most of the stuff we need on occasion (like therapists and hospitalizations when we can't eat solid food because it's scary or because the voices in our little heads are too loud and stuff like that) are not covered by the usual insurance policies.  oh, they cover all the dope tho. woo wee, do they. all the dope you can fit into the bed of a truck. anyways, i'm pretty concerned about the health care crisis for mental people like me and apparently   urlLink  John Kerry is too   . take a peek:

        good. i got your attention.  Husband calls me out into the living room to ask me if i need  urlLink this .  what?  i got off my ass and walked all the way over there to look at a silicone adhesive bra? just what is he trying to tell me? does this strike anyone else as just a wee bit odd?  i've already expounded on my boobs in here right? small-ish but nice i think. a little droopy but not hanging down to my knees yet. criminy. The Husband is actually watching TV and thinking that i need silicone boobie band-aids now. good lord. and he wasn't kidding either. a look of total seriousness was on his face when i walked out there.  i'm proud of myself tho. i should have struck him. but i did not. YAY me.
