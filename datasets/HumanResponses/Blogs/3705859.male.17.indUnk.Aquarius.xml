      Current Mood: Black like a big scary hole filled with poison weasels  I'm gunna be a scientist so I can invent a virus that kills everyone who wears a letter jacket.  Those fucking jock-cock piss-ninnies really deserve to be fed there own intestines.  I was walkin down tha hall today, minding my own, when Jake Fucking Steadman slammed me into the lockers when I wouldn't get out of his way.  I tried to shove him back, but my shoulder was all fucked up, so all it did was go "krunch" and leave me in searing pain for the rest of the day.  It hurt so bad I cried a little and my black mascara fucking ran!  I am going to stab you, Jake Fucking Steadman.  in the kneecaps first and then in the throat.  then the rats will drink your blood and I will eat the rats.  In other news, my birthday is coming up, and I think my parents are finally going to get me a guitar.  I told them I wanted that wicked black one with the fucking spikes.  A real thrash.  AS long as I can put some satanic distrotion on it, I'll be happy.  Wait, not happy - more artistically piussed off.  If you're happy then ur music sucks balls.  And I mean balls.  kay, I can't think of way to end this, soo .... fuck you!  hahaha.    -Evan the NightMinstral  P.S. - for those of you concerned, I found a way to fix my hair dye.  I just took the new stuff and mixed it up with some black shoe polish.  Makes my hair look like tar.  Rock on.

      Current mood: Blackness  So I'm starting a blog because I need to get these demuns in my head out on paper or ill go insane.  I guess its not paper cause im typing but whatever.  fukk it.  So today I'm pissed cos I went to Wal-Mart and they didn't have the right hair dye.  Ive bene using "raven" for two years and this week all they had was 'onyx."  fukk that shit.  One of my life principles is to never settle for anything less than the best of the highest pinnical of the cream of the crop.  When I choose something I go all tha way.  Raven helps me define who I am.  My style is a part of my personality.  Sindy was tha one that got me hooked on Raven.  God of Darkness, I miss that bitch.  More on that later.  Got a geometrey final tomorrow.  Instead of studying, I think I'm gunna just cut myself.  Then I can draw 666 in all the blanks wth my own blood.  I want to eat live snakes.  I think I'm dun writing now.  Its all useless, just like Nitshie said.  Gonna go play Socom II.   Holla lata  -Evan the NightMinstral.
