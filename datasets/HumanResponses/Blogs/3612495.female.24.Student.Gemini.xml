      12 Jun 2004  I had arrived in Sydney for more than 4 months. Remember the first day I came here, exited, scare, many difficult feeling from my heart. But now, all the things had settled and my first exam in Australia is nearly come.  By the times, I am missing Hong Kong very much, my family, my friends and my students. Their faces always appear in my brain, I want to go back to meet them as soon as possible.   不知不覺在了悉尼已經4個月了。還記得當我第一天來到的時候，心裡又興奮、緊張，但又帶點慌忙，真的有點不知怎樣好。但幸好，現在所有的東西都已經安頓好，而我亦都投入了澳洲的生活，還有下星期便是我在澳洲的第一個考試，希望平平穩穩的便可以。  話雖如此，我還得掛住香港的每一個人，我的屋企人，我的朋友，還有我的學生。你們的樣子常常在我的腦海中浮現，真的好想快點飛返香港探你們。等，好快就可以見到你們的。

      On 28 May, Gavin came and picked me after his works,what for? Because we will go down to South Coast for holdiay tonight. We will go to Tim's house also with Tim. Before the driving, we needed to go and buy the drinks first, also got KFC for our dinner.  Then we drove to there at 20:45, it's cost us for 2 hours to get there, long driving. In the car, I slept for a while, so I missed out the dounut. :-( When we arrived, there are many starts in the sky, beautiful.  In Tim's house, there is a snooker table, cool, long time havent play that, its let me remember the club house of Austin Villa in China. My family holiday house.   On the next morning, I woke up and Gavin bought me to the beach, the water was cold, and I collected some shells from the beach and we saw the dolphins are far far away from us, near to the end of the other sides. So we just seee the small spot going out from the water and back to it. The fishs and chips for lunch are fresh, delicious. For our dinner at RSL, the oysters are cool, and chicken.   On sunday, my driving day. Firstly, drove to golf club to play golf for 9 holes, tired. Then drove around and then just Gavin and me went to RSL for dinner again. It cost me to drive for about 20 mins to get there, and also some cars follow me and opposite way to me. I can felt that how the feeling was when driving on the road, a little bit scare when driving through the roundabout, quite difficult.   On monday, my birthday, we went to Norwe for lunch, the meat pie and chocolate cake. Then on the way back to Sydney, many horse, cow and ostrich in the farm, cool. :-) Then back home to leave the bag. And went to Chinatown for diner, chinese food. I liked it very much. My birthday was happiest, unforgettable for the nice trip and its a good memory in my deep heart.  5月28日，當Gavin放工之後便來接我，去邊？去南邊的地方小遊幾天。我們會去Tim的渡假屋。但出發之前，我們要去買飲品先，同食晚餐，食左肯德雞。 跟著我們在晚上8:45出發，需時2個小時，好長的旅程。在旅途中，我睡著了，所以我錯過了dounut。:-( 但我們到達的時候，天上有萬千顆星星，好靚呀。 係Tim的屋裡面，有枱ball打，我很久没有打過了。這令我回想起我老豆係大陸的渡假屋，係在番禺名苑別墅，環境優美。  第二朝清早，Gavin帶我到沙灘漫步，海水十份冰冷，但海水清澈見底，我還拾了一些漂亮的貝殼，我仲可以見到有海豚在遠處跳出水面呢﹗跟著去買了一些海鮮作為午餐，好味。晚餐就去了一個會所吃，吃了生豪同雞。  星期日，係我的駕車日，Gavin話今日去邊都係我駕車，因為這裡比較少人，所以唔驚。首先，我要駕車去哥爾夫球場，我們在打裡打哥爾夫球，共打了9個洞，好疲倦呀。跟著周圍去下，晚上再駕出市鎮食晚飯，又係去會所食。今次係一個比較長的駕駛，用了大約20分鐘，而且係在公路上，我第一次感受到有車跟著我的感覺。有點驚慌，而且仲要過回旋處，有點難度。  星期一，5月31日係我的生日，我們去了南邊的一個小鎮食午餐，吃了好美味的肉餡餅及朱古力蛋糕。跟著再駕車返悉尼。途中經過很多的農場，有馬、牛同鴕鳥，好得意呀。 :-) 之後回家放低行李後便出了唐人街食晚飯。因為今晚我想食中餐。今年的生日，真的好開心，我永遠都不會忘記這個旅程，它會在我的深心處常常的浮現。

      27 May 2004  Very exciting. I hope tomorrow come quickly. This is the first time I go for few days with my boy friend. As before, just go for 1 day with my ex-bf. I hope it will be a nice memory.   Today, the marks of Quantity Survey had posted, luckily, I passed! I am happy because last time, I had bad marks, and for this time, because I want to go and wait for him to leave his works, so I just use 1 day to finish this assignment, then go out to play for 2 days. For those I handed out on time, I got 1 bonus mark because the lecturer had extended the due date, so who handed out on time can have 1 bonus mark.   Last night, I had a nice dream with Gavin and Tim about while we are driving on the road, a police talked with them in Meridian, then I needed to translate to them, but while I am translating, I spoke Cantonese, then they laugh out loudly :-( then I spoke in English again to them. At that time, I also had woke up and laugh for a while!  Tonight, I should have a good sleep and waiting for tomorrow coming. :-)  好緊張呀，快點兒到明天啦。因為明天係我第一次同自己個男朋友去旅行，以前都只係同前度男朋友去過一日的旅行吧了。希望有一個愉快的旅程。  今天，第二份的測量功課有結果，合格呀。現在係澳洲讀書，合格就已經好開心的呀﹗今次我只好了一天的時間便做完這份功課，因為為了同Gavin去街，哈哈。但係亦都有好處，因為教授推遲了交功課的時間，但是如果準時交的話便可以有加1分。無情情加了1分，真開心，可以用來補返上次欠的1分。  昨晚，我發了一個有關Gavin同Tim的夢，係有關我們在路上駕車，忽然有一警察同我們講話，他是說普通話的，跟著我便翻譯給Gavin同Tim知，但我不知不覺地用廣東話同他們講，他們便忍不住大笑 :-( (我便連忙用英文再翻譯多一次。而且在那一刻，我驚醒過來，還坐在床上笑了出來，我也覺得自己百痴。但之後就好好訓，等待著明天的來臨。 :-)

      26 May 2004  Today is the birthday of Florence, I called her today. I found that she had a little bit disappointed, but not for those I called her, just for her mind. May be she had a large pressure in her works. Don't give up, I will always support you and besides you.   And today, Gavin confirmed me that we will go to South Coast on Friday. I am glad to hear about that. I felt exciting, it the first time I go with my boy friend. Also Tim, I am happy he will go also, he is a nice person. But before that, I need to finish one of the assignment that will hand out on next Monday(my birthday), pity, but finally, I had finished that, just waiting for Eric's one and combined. Besides, I started another assignment, about contract law, its difficult.   In the afternoon, we go for chinese tea in Chinatown, the food is delicious, and we have a happy lunch time to each other. I enjoy in it much, I hope you will be there next time, can you?  今天是Florence的生日，我特意打個電話給她，她好高興。但我覺得她有點不開心，是因為她返工太大壓力。俾心機呀，我會支持你的。  還有，Gavin同我講在本星期五會同我去南邊玩。當然好開心啦，而且好興奮的。這是我第一次同男朋友去旅行。不過其實仲有Gavin的朋友Tim，佢好好人的。但去之前，我一定要做完我的報告，到最後我做好我自己那些部份，只剩下Eric的部份。而且我還要做法律的功課，係寫論文。  下午，我們一班同學又去了唐人街飲茶。好好味。希望下次他也可以去試下啦。

      25 May 2004 Today I had the first presentation in UNSW. Fortunately, it's good, the lecturer said that our power point are very nice, and our content are descriptive, actually, I dont know it good or not?! I just want to pass all the subjects only. For Credit, Distinction, I dont care. I just want to finish my degree here. For the study here is not the same as Hong Kong, as Hong Kong, I can thinking for getting higher grade, but here, I cant.  今天係我在新南威爾斯大學的第一個演説。幸好，做得幾好，而且個教授都說我們的動畫做得好好，還有好足夠的內容，但這樣唔知係好定唔好？我都只求合格的，有無最高份，我都不敢望。我只想順順利利完成個學位便可以。但澳洲讀書真的比香港困難，在香港可以容易取到好的成績，但在這裡不是容易的。

On Friday, its the first time he scold me, actually, he had drunk, I felt strange, but on that time, I known I need to stay besides him much more to look after him, I cant leave him, I cant leave him alone, he will be much more pity. You should remember, every time, every moment, I will be thinking of you.  今日我開始在網上寫日記，因為我希望我的朋友可以跟我一齊分享我的喜與憂。 上個星期五，他第一次罵我，也不算罵，只是大聲一點的，因為他飲醉左。但好奇怪，那一刻，我更加覺得我要在他的身邊照顧佢，我唔可以離開佢，唔可以只剩下他一個，佢會好可憐的。你要記住，無論何時、何地，我個心都係想住你的。

Also I just want Gavin to support me all the times. No matter what had happened, he will give a hand to me. Also, what had happened to him, I also always stay near him to support him.  This is the first examination in Australia, I dont know whether are there any difficult with Hong Kong. I wish it will be easier than Hong Kong, I am scare very very much.  明天是我的第一個考試，好緊張。但我心中不祈求有好高的分數，只求科科合格，那麼我已經好開心。此外，我希望Gavin會時時刻刻都支持我。不論有什麼事發生，他都會伸出援手，幫助我。而當他需要的時候，有什麼事發生係他身上，我也會一定在他身邊支持他。  明天係第一次在澳洲的正式考試，唔知會同香港的有什麼不同。但願比香港的容易，可是始終都好緊張。

      The last weekend, I stayed in Gavin's house for 3 days. It is because his mum and dad had go travelling, so that just remine him at home. So, he asked me to go to his house, so that he can cooked for me! The food he cooked were delicious, potato, spagetti, taco, all of them are taste very good, and also the the big breadfast.  I am happy these few days, because I can see him every day when I went to bed or when I woke up, but my examination is coming, so I also need to work hard on my studies, and you, you should work hard on your works. Also to all my friends, we work hard together to have a better resulf in the coming future.  在剛剛過了的週未，我去了Gavin屋企住左3日。因為他的家人去了旅行，所以得佢一個係屋企，因此他叫我去他屋企，那麼他便可以煮飯俾我食﹗他煮的東西好美味的，有薯塊，意粉，taco（唔知中文係咩，係有個皮包住一些洋蔥，肉碎，芝士，汁），全部都好好味，仲有一個好豐富的早餐。  係這三日，我真的好開心，可以日日都見到佢，尤其係一起身同訓覺之前，但我的考試好快便到，我要俾心機溫書，你都要俾心機做野呀。還有我再有的朋友，你們都要俾心機，我們大家一齊努力，等待美好的將多的來臨。

So, no more mood to study. But the last one on 2 July, bad, it is Management, very difficult, as before, I like this subject very much, but now I hate that one.  I really want the examination pass quickly, I want to play!  今日我什麼都没有做過，我真的好想努力讀書，但總提不起勁。因為下一個考試會在6月29日，而那一科係測量，仲要可以睇筆記及書呢，更加無心機溫。但係最後一科會好驚，係7月2日考，考管理，好難的，我本來好鍾意這科的，但現在好憎它呢。  好想好想快點過曬考試，那麼我可以去玩啦﹗

      20 June 2004 Today, Gavin and me been to North Rock, for what? Been to the computer market, it is because Gavin want to buy the new computer stuffs. And after that, I needed to drive him back Padstow, it's so far away, I needed to drive about 1 hour. Then he made his new computer and we had fish, prawn and chips (very delicous).  今日，晨早起床便同Gavin去左北面的悉尼，去做什麼，去了North Rock的電腦市場，因為他要買電腦用品。之後，我駕車車他回佢屋企，好長的車程，差不多用了我一個小時才回到Padstow。之後他便砌他的電腦，而且我們買了魚、蝦及薯條，好好味呀。

      29 June 2004 Today, I had finished the second subject of the examination. Very tired, actually, the examination today was open book examination, but not much time to do that. It is because today is having QS examination, we needed to do 4 questions within 3 hours, not plenty of time. Luckily, I can finished all of them.  And today, I had posted the birthday present to my lovely sister and my dad. I hope they will like that!  今天終於考完第二科考試。雖然這個考試係可以用書，但也很疲倦呀，而且不是好夠時間做。這份卷係考測量，要係三個小時裡做四條問題，真的唔夠好足夠時間。但幸好，我可以叫做做得完。  還有，今天去了郵局寄了家姐及爸爸的生日禮物返香港。希望佢地會鍾意啦﹗

      02 July 2004 Finally, I finished all the examination on 2 July, and these few days, Gavin stay at my house, because he is during his 5 days holidays. Also his grandpa and his grandpa's gf had came from New Zealand to Australia for few days, so we had dinner at his house and went to the club with them.  在7月2日終於考完試啦，而且在這數天，Gavin都在我的家，因為他有5天的大假。還有他的爺爺及他爺爺的女朋友從新西蘭來了澳洲旅行，所以Gavin的媽咪叫我去他屋企食飯及去同他們去club。  03 July 2004 And last Saturday night, when we back from Padstow, while Gavin was looking out from my bedroom's window, he saw a fire happened in the house opposite to the road, and at that time, I am talking with my mum on phone, then Gavin quickly rang "000" for the fire station. It happened in the kitchen of that house while a girl is cooking the chips. After a while, there had an explorsion from the window, then the fire to the roof, horrible. After that, I called mum back and told her what had happening, she asked me to take extra care. Luckily, Gavin was here with me, otherwise, I dont know what I can do.  在星期六，在Gavin屋企食完晚飯回到我家，當我正當同我媽咪傾緊長途電話，Gavin望出街見到對面街有間屋火燭，他立時跑到樓下及打"000"。原來係有個女仔在廚房煮薯條引至起火。過了一會，便聽到爆炸聲，跟著在屋頂也可以見到火，好慘。之後，我再打返電話俾媽咪告知她，她叫我小心點兒。在那一刻，幸好Gavin，不是的話我都唔知點算好。
