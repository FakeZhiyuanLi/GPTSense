      The following are concept photos in the world of the PERSEUS SYSTEM. Bear in mind that these are not true... yet. Concept pictures are tastefully chosen by yours truly, from videos and music videos that I have encountered on television or in the net that have sparked my ideas in creating this project. More copyrights later, in the mean time, enjoy~ :) Pictures are worth a thousand words... :)  Driving has never been this fun~ http://www.geocities.com/ayuro_materialboy/drivetwo.jpg http://www.geocities.com/ayuro_materialboy/driving.jpg  Even lessons as scarce as astronomy are present. http://www.geocities.com/ayuro_materialboy/astro.jpg  Anyone for a game of reality chess? http://www.geocities.com/ayuro_materialboy/chess.jpg http://www.geocities.com/ayuro_materialboy/chessr.jpg  Even just picture matching for children is here. http://www.geocities.com/ayuro_materialboy/children.jpg  Wanna take an envorinmental tour? http://www.geocities.com/ayuro_materialboy/environ.jpg  Hm... a study of real life tornadoes in your face! http://www.geocities.com/ayuro_materialboy/tornad.jpg   Credits: The Day After Tomorrow - more than a million miles Aya Ueto - Kaze Hitomi Shimatani - Perseus m-flo Loves BoA - the Love Bug Ai Otsuka - momo no hanabira

      As said earlier, the System will be customized by the user through his own characteristics and interests. He may be able to visualize whatever design and type of learning he may want to apply, and the Perseus System will be the one to adjust itself to the likes of the person, therefore the time span of learning and style will differ from each student. All in all, it's a wonderful experience for the student to learn in a different way therefore setting a exhilarating experience so that the student will want to go to school and not be lazy.  MY OPINION:  ADVANTAGES: -The system will adopt to every type of learning potential and way of the student. -The system could provide the needs of students in a fun and creative way that the students prefer. -Learning will be separate and therefore comcentrate on each student not just one to group (One-on-one strategy). -The student will be able to visualize ideas for themselves. -The time span of learning will be regulated and well adjusted. -The environment will be controlling the machine to supress their comfortability.  DISADVANTAGES: -Student's progress will be harder to record than a class based program, therefore making progress hard for the class to evaluate and compare. -The students would not be able to excel or develop skills in the things that they don't want.

      Learning: Applying the theories of the different Philosophers, I have decided to mix their ideas together and come up with a new idea. Basically due to the kind of atmosphere and design process, the learning style would be one-on-one, which means the student would be able to emphasize his own needs, therefore stating it into a student-centered learning, and at the same time the student would be able to pace in his own speed, and he dosen't need to adjust anymore to the irregular pace of the classroom. The students would be able to provide the learnings and knowledge on lessons that they like to learn with, not some courses that they find appealingless to them. The lessons to them will have application due to the exercises, simulations and quizzes given to them. The system would be able to adjust itself to the learning style of the student. Learning would be essential on the part of the learner since he would be able to track his learning due to the save/load feature, and therefore follow his improvements. The learner is also encouraged here to think on his own ideas too, and the computer will be the one to adjust to him.

      Controls: The conrtols are simple. Each student would be able to express his own style of learning by being the person to choose how he is going to control the system. It is either by voice manipulation, where the student would just talk to the wall via microphone headset, and would be able to interact with the system like he is just talking to another teacher, it's just so happened that this teacher knows everything from Aardvark to Zymurgy. :) Anyways, the student is also possible to control the Perseus system using hand movements or body language. Real time action and fun are applied in this setting, Introducing topics like dancing insturctions, music, playing instruments and even synchronized swimming and driving lessons, only in the cubicle itself. So learning is full time simulated and expounded. Via the settings, the student would also be able to save and loas his progress and class card to show his standing, learnings, scores and record. This info would also be available via the Perseus database which is included in their website. There would also be several moderators in case an accident or violation happens.

      The classroom of the future... When I have an opportunity to share my ideas and create my own learning place... I would have to spare not any expense. A classroom full of ideas and innovation. A room full of learning but at the same time full of fun. A room with knowledge and design. A room with futurity.  This is inspiration from the future.   This is inspiration from myself.  INTODUCTION: Visually, the room is just a simple white room with no design. It's just a plain painted room with a single switch in one of the corners. Once the switch is turned on, the room is now transformed into a prism-lighted place with no borders. Students would be free to go anywhere the want to go with the place, which is full of blank hologram walls where each student could have one hologram and turn it into something they could get knowledge from. The hologram could present concepts more than mathematics, science, computer, language and positively many knowledge based in an infinite number of books and resources put in one. The lessons and concepts will be shown using visuals and sounds, where each student has his own place. The student will be the only one to visualize and hear the sounds and media from his own hologram system. The other students would be in their own "world". The hologram wall would not just present them but will also give out quizzes in a style of games. Not only will they be presenting fun but also impossible limits of learning.  Design and Controls: The design would include over-to-date technology with unbelieveble media. The learning style will be fun and exciting. This is something everyone would like to achieve.  Learning: The learning is execptional. This is a kind of learning where everyone would be able to express their ideas, to gain confidence and will.  Place: The room is just one simple room when turned off. But when the system is switched, we are then transported into the world of knowledge.

      Education is an importanty role in our lives because it shapes up of what we are going to be when we grow up... Is it becoming a doctor? A businessman? Or even a recording artist? Still, all of those careers that we choose have something in common, and that is all of those futures have a link to our modern world today, which is goverened by technology. Technology is so advanced today that we even have to have a form of technology to make our lives easier. And day by day, our wants are suddenly becoming our needs.  &nbsp; Insturctional technology plays an important role in our future. Since it is one of the most prestigious and the most advanced course of all, Computers are rapidly changing. Like in the news, every day new technologies are being developed and marketed. The result: is making our lives more comfortable in this fast changing world. Some people believe that technology is not important yet they use cellphones... &nbsp; Most of our belongings today contain a computer or even a simple chip inside. Even digital watches contain computers inside. Like for those functions such as stopwatch or so. We cannot avoid the ever changing significance of technology in our lives today, what more can future hold? We must cherish what we can do with computers and at the same time, support and creat new ideas with the concepts that we have now in order to promote more the power of technology, the power of dreams, and a better future.

      3.) Critique the conventional "self contained" classroom as an organization, and as a setting for incorporating technology. -I think it is more wise to believe that the best way of education is fully going into school and learning something with other people, more like interaction, because "self containment" is a very lonely kind of learning though effective, it could affect the moral of the student as a social person, Because our friendships and social life start at school right? It is not very advisable for students to be learning in a limited range of environment, therefore he must be ready to be exposed to the outside world and not only in a self contained classrom. There are many things that could be lerarned outside, especially the values and morals that we have to survive into real life situations. &nbsp; 6.) Describe the consequences of increased communication between home and school and the importance of home as a center for technology based learning. -As computer science students, all of us obviously is inclined in computers, also having 1 or more personal computers or laptops at home, obviously also having internet connections. You see, learning in the internet is a god way of practicing what we have learned already in school. Though not a perfect standalone library of knowledge, the internet and the computer is a main source of ideas and creativity. Home and School is indeed important to be connected because as we say, learning in both home and school go hand in hand. Without the home, we will find it hard to adapt to the school environment and the same goes at home. We need both learning from home and school in a increased communication, and at the same time, we do not rely completely on both these two.
