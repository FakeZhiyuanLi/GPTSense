      Hello everybody.:).. Well well.. Today.. Wasn't too bad.. Except.. Ugh.. Confusion.. :S... Ok.. Here's the situation.. this is my week.. Monday..  School and then Parliament.. (. that was total shit.. once again).. Tuesday.. nothing really just hw.. Wednesday not too much.. jus gotta do lots of hw.. that i'll miss for thursday and friday.. Thursday. I gotta go to Riverside Highschool to learn Layout for the year book.. *not too much fun* anyway.. I guess its cool cuz i don't have to pay the $50 for the 2 day seminar... but then after that I got Student parliament stuff again. GRADE 9 NIGHT>> GRRR.. Minor niners.. anyway.. I gotta help out.. so practically.. im out from 7 in the morning to 9 pm at night.. doing stuff that i wouldn't necessarily say are *Fun*.. on friday.. i gotta go to Riverside at 7 then come home.. and probably start my hw since im going to have a shit load of it.. *crap*.. Plus I got 2 tests and to study for..   Thats the end of the school problems..   Now.. Confusion at its best.. What ppl say and what ppl do.. DAMN HYPOCRITE!!!!!. I wish people could be straight forward.. Im Nice.. .. *most of the time* .. and I'll tell ya .. Im not the type that hides stuff.. but I hate when people will toy with your mind.. ( I know my brains the size of a pea.. but still ITS NOT A Damn Toy.. .. :P..).. well.. all in all. I just wish.. I can get on wit life.. wit this stupid confusion...   ColdAsFire

I really gotta stop with the Emoticons:P..--->:P                                1) School ( TOO BUSY  )                                2) Job related stuff.. (.. orientation n forms n stuff.. so.. thats alright tho)                                3) Eyeglasses/ contacts ( have been killing eyes.. -- contacts)                              *4) IM A LAZY ASS.. this isn't really a reason.. but hey its the truth The 4 reason contributes to why Im too lazy to do many things.. eg.. find a gf..

      Hey Guys Been a long time eh?... 19th .. HAHAHAHa. I LIED.. lol.. Well i don't like to but REally I was working WAAAAYYY too much.. I didn't want to but I guess when i look at my check i reconsider. It never really felt like a vacation. Im tired right now.. just finished doing foods project (I somewhat cooked for my family). 2morrow I have a presentation infront of the class on how to poach frikin Eggs.. JEEZ.. like who doesn't know how to do that?       Well.. now.. lets see.. During the Christmas break I had some fun time too .. More sleep time..lol.. I realized people at work get upset really easily and others can be a lil tooo happy all the time.. I guess the ups and downs of regular people are inflated in a work environment where there is always constant pressure depending on how you perceive your work. I take it as a fun job. I don't take anything seriously .. really.. but I do always put in a fair bit of effort sometimes too much. Well people I must cut this entry short because im more interested in watching a movie in the few moments i have to spare..otherwise I would rather sleep and get prepared for 2morrow.. lol. cya.. Will xplain.. some stuff.. hopefully 2morrow..night.. all...  ColdAsFire Aka.. ACZ

      Im happy that my careers presentation is over. I wish exams were over already and they haven't even started. I wish the world would spin really fast so this dizziness would go away. Well anyway I gotta starty studying for exams. Im actually kinda worried. I hate exams they manage to put me in a 'glum' mood which means i sleep more often do less than normal. I have come to the realization all Im doing this for is to avoid studying. I HATE EXAMS.. ok enuf.. now.. to other topics.. Who knows 3DS MAX.. I wanna learn, I like experimenting.. but as much as I like it .. it takes a hell of a long time. So save me some time and help me out. I gotta get out a lot more in the summer
