      Hello Bloggers...im back... and still bored. my god.. this is what 4 days at your dads will do to you...so what all is going on in your life? Thats good(unless of course...it wasnt). yea Right now...Im in the mood for rammstein... trying to liven things up..in the event that i sat for a few minutes without figuring out what to write..I shall recite a joke that i once heard                        WARNING:i was drunk when i heard it  Farmer #1 owns donkeys Farmer#2 owns chickens One day, one of farmer #1's donkeys crossed over into Farmer 2's property. The donkey was hungry, but there was nothing there except chickens. so it goes up to one of the roosters and bites off the roosters feet. Lukcly, farmer 2 saw this and chased the donkey away before any more damage could be done. But still farmer 2 was so upset, so e went over to farmer 1's house. Question...What did Farmer 2 say to farmer 1?      Two feet of my cock in your ass, mother fucker!  I dont know why, but at the time, it was the greatest joke in the world. I laughed for 15 minutes. it was so great. oh. ok  im done...for now (incert evil laugh)

      well, lets see what all i did today, im listening to mindless self indulgence. there a cool band. hmmm how to explain them? ok, when eminem finally comes out of the closet, if he gets his sex job and gives birth to Till Lidemann child, then the kid would be making this musik. i would recomend this Cd to everyone, as long as they have a sence of humor. if not, then they should stay the hell away from it. but yea, i didnt do anything today. i sat here. listening to Cds. i played guitar for awhile. i wrote a new-ish song. its "-ish" because it really sucked. i should go back and make it better. oh yea, i also premired my new movie last night! Only my dad saw it...but it was special. I make little video's on my computer. Some funny, some i wish they were, but this one was a musik video. to Rammstein, Feuer Frei!. i know there is already a music video for it, but mine is better. not really. but its ok. ill write later.

      Good day to all three of you who have ever read my Blog. Its me again. today, i took a bike ride. i love to moutain bike. im not much of an active person, but there is some things i just love doing. moutain biking, paintball, and moshing. thats it. thats enough activity for me. enything else, i'll just watch. So what...Im lazy. lazy people are important. If there were no lazy people, who would set the example for the youth of the nation to prove to the rest of the world that America is the land of fast food, where childhood dreams  arnt about acomplishing great things, but to hope other people will be there to do it for them. A land where instead of desiring great things from our people, we fill our heads with empty dreams of Utopia, where everything is remains balenced due to the outstanding deeds of one man who takes no glory for himself.    P.S. I saw Spiderman 2...It was the cheeziest movie i'v ever seen!

      my dad is such a pushover. Well, not exactly that hes a pushover, its more like...my stepmom bitches about what he does and he just sits there and takes it. my opinion... his sex life must be great in order to continueously put up with her shit day after day.

      Well, this is the 2nd time ive written in here. Well, today, i went to my stepmom's mom's house. i guess that would be my stepgrandma ...yea...anyways, while leaving, i noticed something......my little brother is the most spoiled kid ever. i live with my mom, so i dont see my dads side of the family very much, but when i saw my little brother sit there and whine, i honestly thought that he has never been punished before. HONESTLY! this kid needs a good dose of abuse. or at least be sent to his room.he is a brat.
