       urlLink    SCREAM fuck i'm dead, then SHOUT, it's all in my head. I suppose its too much to hope for the phone to ring then eh?  C'est ma voie, c'est ma chance. Tomorrow i will buy the blade, paint the picture and eat the sun. All will be well and dandy in the morning when i've had enough time to let the bad thoughts leak out of me. Yes. Sounds like a plan.

       urlLink    When has anybody ever listened to the people until they start smashing things. Remember the poll tax? Vietnam? Martin Luther King? And why should they? What are people in relation to pure hard cash. Unfortunately the world is goverened by oligarchies, which control the means of production, communication and policy making. So where does that fit me in? Well, it leaves me, and you, right out of the equation. Being part of the first world doesnt mean much to our leaders. Money is worth much more than you or I could ever be. Probably the most disgusting thing happening in the world other than the various wars, genocides, natural disasters etc... is the way that the third world is kept in constant submission through debt, the WTO, IMF and the European Common Agricultural Policy, whilst at the same time the first world leaders are busy claiming that the third world has never had it so good. We wreck their economy's, steal their resources, and then send them the bill. All to continue to allow our own egotistical consumerist culture to grow and prosper. It would be nice if everybody could be rich wouldn't it? But the whole point about capitalism is that it relies on someone getting the better deal out of someone else, and this is exactly what is happening today, just on a larger scale. The WTO is much more lethal than any bomb, tank or battleship. It's main weapon is it's pretence that it is working for the improvement of the third world, when in fact its doing the opposite, working to keep the third world in submission and send it even further into debt. But its got our backing because it makes us richer. The question we have to ask ourselves is how long are we going to continue being egotistical and demanding ever increasing luxuries for our consumerist culture at the expense of other people who share this world and break their backs for pittance. And when we finally see the light, the rich arent going to give up easily. There's gonna need to be a whole lot more rioting before long...

       urlLink     I got this in an email, thought it was hilarious, enjoy.   A lesson in economics    In case you were wondering how Enron came into so much trouble, here is an explanation reputedly given by an Aggie professor to explain it in terms his students could understand.   Capitalism:  You have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull. Your herd multiplies, and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the income.   Enron Venture Capitalism:  You have two cows. You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows. The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company. The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more. Sell one cow to buy a new president of the United States, leaving you with nine cows. No balance sheet provided with the release. The public buys your bull.

       urlLink     According to  urlLink www.bloodforoil.org  its Anybody But Bush, but is Kerry necessarily any better?  Americans, they are all the same. Bush or Kerry in November? Theres not much between a Liberal Sissy and Right Wing Nut Job according to the guys over at  urlLink www.jibjab.com . Either way, the Americans arent going to be pulling out of Iraq anytime soon, and in the consumerist mecca that we've come to know and hate you can be guaranteed that there'll be a lot more wars in the pursuit of money and oil.  Is it really true that the president of America is the most powerful man in the world? To what extent is Bush merely the corporations puppet, and to what extent are his political decisions influenced by big business. Let's not forget that Bush is a businessman foremost, and a president second.

       urlLink     Isn't the RIAA just the biggest sonofabitch corporation out there? I mean come on, it makes its money off the back of relentless promotion and distribution of (mostly crap) music, pursues its crusade against the p2p'ers out there, pushes for laws to tighten intellectual copyright and all in the name of equality and fairness. As if those "artists" are'nt rich enough already. Well, you guilt ridden people, buy your cd's and continue to oil the cogs of the capitalist machine.  But just remember, consumerism costs lives, as the hilarious subvert points out.

      Its holiday season, and i'm off to turkey. Hoorah. Or to put it more precisely im off to an area near Olu Deniz. I'm not one of those people who likes hoardes of sunburnt tourists on the beach, so i've been looking around the web for a few more remote and secluded places to visit. By far the most appealing to me at the moment has to be Patara beach. At only 54km from Olu Deniz its easy to get to, and has an excellent 18km of soft white sand backed by majestic dunes to spread yourself out on. Recently voted the best beach in the world by the Sunday Times, i think its where im going to be wanting to spend most of my time this summer!

       urlLink     Bold design and brown bricks, symbols of a modern industrial revolution and a developing London. At this time people were looking to build over the scars of WW2 but did they realise that they were steering the world further and further into reliance of technology and machinery above human hands?

       urlLink     On the 6th of August 1945 at 0815 local time, an atomic bomb nicknamed "Fat Boy" was dropped from Enola Gay, a Boeing B29 bomber by Charles W. Sweeney. He died on the 17th of July 2004, aged 84. He was only 25 years old when he dropped the bomb that killed an estimated 70,000 people, leaving thousands others maimed from the radioactive residue. Throughout his life he was an outspoken defender of bombing campaigns. At the time he pressed the trigger, he was "just completing a mission", a mouthpiece for an angry and wounded America, but is it possible that later on in his life he never considered the ammount of pain which ultimately he was responsible for? And if he did consider it, i wonder whether he felt guilty at all, and how he managed to live with this guilt to the ripe old age of 84? I dont think i could ever do what he did, not in my current mental state anyway. Therefore the fact that he was able to knowingly release a bomb that was bound to cause multiple casualties begs the question as to how much he was "conditioned" by propaganda against his victims, and the extent of his manipulation at the hands of the country he sought to defend...

       urlLink     Recently there has been a lot of argument as to whether graffiti has a right to existence or even encouragement in the media and on our walls. People who argue against graffiti always strike me as being quite hypocritical, they'll accept as much advertising as can be shoved in their faces, yet whenever someone has an alternative view and competes for some space, they start to moan. And its always some old bloody Hyacinth, some well intentioned old biddy who can't comprehend anything beyond aestheticism. They dont understand that graffiti exists as a platform to promote and generate ideas, giving people who would otherwise not have had a voice, their chance to be heard. A lot of graffiti has deep sociopolitical undertones and is a reaction to the depravity of urban life. Graffiti didnt destroy the scenery, we did. I doubt very much whether council flats would be that much more aesthetically pleasing without the tags and murals than with them. And its the irresponsible middle/upper class, who dont want to be reminded that there are people living in squalor and depravity still, who complain the most. "Tagging" isnt particularly beautiful, it always strikes me as a sort of futile last stance practiced mainly amongst youths and teenagers out of boredom and a desire for recognition. You see, a tag is something someone can create, something they can see, something others can see and something they can be proud of. There isnt much to be proud of growing up in the working class. However this tagging usually develops into a much more refined art form as the youth matures. First come the tags, then the two tone "dubs" and then the full scale murals. At his most mature stage the graffiti artist truly deserves to be called an artist, and people who underestimate the skill and technique required to produce a half-decent piece should try themselves! Spray cans are'nt the most controllable medium, believe me. So next time you see a tag, a dub or a mural, dont just see some fading paint, some blur on society's clean visage, see someones fading dreams for recognition in a world which would rather forget its poor.

       urlLink     There was a photographical exhibition in the wake of the September 11th attacks wasnt there? I think this photo may be from it, it just shows how photography can be such a powerful medium, capturing history more accurately than words ever could.  I would like to see more photos from that exhibition, if anyone has any idea how to do so... please tell me.
