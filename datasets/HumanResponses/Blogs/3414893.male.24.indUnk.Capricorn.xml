      What can I say.....I guess my blog has taken on a new popularity.    Good luck to everyone on the road.  You can't read this right now, but oh well.  Have fun, don't take it too seriously.    The band concert went really well, and I'll post the link on my next blog to pictures from the big show.  I was really happy with it, although the 5th graders were TOAST.  Drum corps helped though.  I told them that they needed to snap out of it and they turned it on about 2 songs into the concert.  Next song they sounded like pros.  It was a good moment.    After that I went to Wayside with Wagner and had some brews and pizza.  This weekend I'm helping John move and doing some packng myself.  A week and a half from now I'm going to be in VA Beach.  Can't wait.

      Man, last night nearly made me pee my drawers.  I was sleeping at about 9:40 PM, when I woke up to professional bowling on ESPN, lightning, thunder, and then the tornado sirens.  I was not amused!  I think it would've been better if there were some roommates here, but it was me flying solo.  Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love being on my own.  I prefer sitting by myself and thinking about things, listening to music, reading books, or playing Tiger Woods.  I can't count how many times I've skipped on a trip out with people to just sit and relax.  But, there is definitely no need for solitude when you aren't sure if your house is going to make it through the twister!    Anyway, that's about it.  I'm headed up to the Celery Flats for a jog, then I am going to continue to clean the townhouse and gear up for the WNBA game at 4.  I've never actually wanted to watch a WNBA game before, but Jen, the girl from GMU, is playing for Connecticut and since I have her mix CD, I should watch out of respect :-)

      Alright, this is my fourth and final attempt at a weblog.  Hopefully this one stays around.  I am in Kalamazoo for a few more weeks, then its back to Virginia.  As it turns out, I think I am headed to Charlottesville to the University of Virginia.  Of course, I am still not sure since I haven't gotten official word yet, but I think I start there June 28th.  It'll be cool to get back to VA and I don't think they have a job for me in FCPS.  I can get a job elsewhere, but I'd rather finish my masters by August of 2005, hang out in Charlottesville and get the new band going.    That's it for now.  I'll update the world with my contact info when I figure out exactly where I'm headed.

      Well, I'm back in Virginia...been here for exactly one week, and what can I say...I am really glad to be here.  I am working at Dirty Dick's again, and kicking it...that's all, just thought I'd mention that I am alive.  Talk more later.

      So, today I got this nice gift from a student.  She gave me a CD, Tito Puente stuff.  it was really nice.  I also got this card that read:  "Thank you for a great year in band.  I really enjoy playing the French Horn.  Good luck at your new school!  You are a great teacher!  I could never thank you enough for what you've taught me about music."  Man...how great is that?  Definitely makes me realize how lucky I am to do what I do.  How many corporate types get that sort of recognition from a kid?  It erases all the horrible things that happen at school...the low pay, the puke, the jerks, the rule breakers, and the uninterested.
