      &nbsp;&nbsp; The relationship between human and dog is incredible. Think about it.   &nbsp;&nbsp; Take two species of carnivore, both of whom can kill the other with relative ease, put them together and make the best of friends out of them. Its fucking wierd.   &nbsp;&nbsp; Its pretty much the same for cats but at no time have I ever feared for my life when in the presence of one.   &nbsp;&nbsp; Then you take the mother dog who raises a kitten as her own.   &nbsp;&nbsp; Or the dog who dies to save its master.   &nbsp;&nbsp; What you end up with is a damned perplexing situation.   &nbsp;&nbsp; When I was growing up we had a cat that was born with no eyes. No shit, it had no eyes; they opened but all that was there was meat. This cat was the neatest thing you ever saw. It could go out in the desert and catch its own food (squirrels and rabbits and things), it could navigate an entire four bedroom home&nbsp;with all it's furniture&nbsp;sporting hundreds of legs.  &nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, this cat could pretty much take care of itself but it had a tendency to roam in the street.  &nbsp;&nbsp; That's where the dog comes in... Rusty was a springer spaniel and he was old when we got&nbsp;Tiger. Neither blindness nor deafness nor arthritis could stop that dog from going out into the street, picking up that cat by the scruff of the neck and bringing it back into the yard.  &nbsp;&nbsp; One day we found out what Rusty was doing. Evidently the cat had taken to climbing up into the engine compartment of a neighbor's car. That day, the cat was outside and Rusty wasn't.  &nbsp;&nbsp; Rusty lived to be about sixteen; he had gone almost completely blind and deaf and could barely move but had Tiger been around, I'm quite positive that&nbsp;Rusty would have cared for that cat til the day he died.  &nbsp;&nbsp; Good Boy, Rusty.

      &nbsp;&nbsp; I just have to do it. Too many people talking at once. Too many people who just like to hear the sound of thier own voice. &nbsp;&nbsp; I am hereby proposing that congress should enact a national shut the fuck up day. A day on which nobody is allowed to speak. A day of blessed silence when you are left alone with your thoughts and no one can penetrate them. Imagine how things would get better if some people were made to shut the fuck up and think.

      &nbsp;&nbsp; I'm absolutely positive that in a hundred years or so, the world will be praising Pink Floyd as we now do Bach&nbsp;and Beethoven, Brahams&nbsp;and Vivaldi.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You run and you run to catch up with the sun  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But its sinking  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Racing around to&nbsp;come up&nbsp;behind you again  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun is the same in a relative way  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But you're older  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Shorter of breath and one day closer to death"  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Musically, they were all virtuosos but ya gotta give it to Roger waters and David Gilmore.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"When I was a child I caught a fever  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My hands felt just like two ballons  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I got that feelin once again  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't explain, you would not understand  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not how I am...  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I have become comfortably numb"   &nbsp;&nbsp; I've spent many a night just trying to understand only to find out that I already did, all I had to do was listen a little less intensely.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We don't need no education  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We don't need no thought control  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No dark sarcasm in the classroom  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teacher, leave them kids alone   &nbsp;&nbsp; Just those words alone can be analyzed until one completely goes insane. Just think about it; here you have a song that in no uncertain terms, decries the harsh strictness of an education system and does it with terrible grammar; coincidence? Not a chance.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the joint chiefs of staff and the brokers on wall street  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; said don't make us laugh, you're a smart kid  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is linear,&nbsp;memory's a stranger  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; History's for fools, man is a tool  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the hands of the great god allmighty  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they gave him command of a nuclear submarine  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and sent him back in search of the garden of eden   &nbsp;&nbsp; The geniuos is self evident. Put it all together and what you have is a thinker. A great thinker.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lunatic is in my hall  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lunatics are in my hall  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The paper holds thier folded faces to the floor  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And everyday the paper boy brings more   &nbsp;&nbsp; Most people think that song is entitled "Dark side of the moon" but it's not.&nbsp;Oh no, its called " Brain damage".   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miraculous, you call it babe  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You aint seen nothin yet  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They got Pepsi in the Andes  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They got McDonald's in Tibet  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yosemite's been turned int a golf course  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the Japs  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the dead sea is alive with rap  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between the Tigres and Euphrates  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a liesure center now  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They got all kind of sports  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They got bermuda shorts  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had sex in Pennsylvania  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Brazilian grew a tree  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a doctor in Manhattan  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saved a dying man for free  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its a miracle  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; I know it seems that these words may be a bit contradictory but when you think about it, they're really not. Some of the subjects are quite depressing and some are hopeful but I think what he means is that today we just use the word miracle way, way too much.  &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thats all on the boys for now but not forever, I'll get back to them sometime. I'd just like to say thanks to all of them for so many years of thought provoking stuff.  &nbsp;&nbsp; Hey Roger, Dave, Nick and Rick We love ya and we miss ya.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no, I didn't forget Syd. You started it all bud.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp; Have you noticed how when you hear somebody do an impression of some one else, they are not actually doing that person but the person they first heard do an impression of them? &nbsp;&nbsp; When I hear some radio commentator or one of my friends do Arnold Swarzenegger or Bill Clinton, they sound more like Dana Carvey than they do the real person.
