      SON OF A THOUSAND...... MOTHER DOGS!!! (you thought i was gonna say a bad word, didn't you?) damnful day.... so damnful..... truly a friday the 13th classic..... my day started when i woke up at about 5:30am, then i slept a few minutes more, then woke up again and started my day as usual... brushed my teeth, ate breakfast, took a bath while thinking, dressed up, and not forgetting to bring my....... my keys and ID..... it happened before, FYI.... then, i rode our car, our Land Cruiser, with my brother, mother, our driver and our cousin who is a recently graduated( not that recent ) college student and is now an official teacher in our very own kindergarten in Chiang Kai Shek, so good luck to ya! when we got there, it was the usual...when i got in our class, the usual... when class started, the usual... NOT! class started with our so-called-freak teacher (freak which was coined by adrian)... it turned out that she checked our test papers early and finished as early... so she made us check our own test papers for corrections and errors... the first test to check was our values ed paper... i expected i would get a higher grade than i got, but obviously, i didn't..... so i used my imagination... to imagine that i got a higher grade than i got.... and it worked! yehey!!! got a higher grade than i got!!! NOT! it didn't work at all... so i was a tincie-wincie-ittie-bittie-quarter-0.25-25% pissed off at that time.... so it wasn't that big of a deal.... then, we checked the AP tests... i got another grade lower than my expectation... "mataas ang pangarap ko"- quote from sherly's line in our bigkasan performance... so i was still a little pissed off... then, after time pitied me and began to speed up time, the bell rang.... then i thought, Oh My Golly Shet!(you see, i don't say those kind of bard words) biology subject is next! i got a really low grade... i hated myself at that time... hated myself more... this time, reality slapped me in the face, i should be sad- i said to myself... so i was sad... really sad... but i pretended to be HAPPY, shalalala........ corny.... never mind that..... after that, recess, nothing happened, then algebra, someTHING happened.... i got another low grade.... i didn't saw that coming....then, my theoretical-hypothetical imaginary other personality spoke to me.... "don't worry, you'll get 'em next time" yeah , i also thought that to myself.... but i still hated myself.... then, english, nothing happened, we just had an activity... miss yee gave us a situation that if we were in a plane crash, and the pilot and other passengers survived and we have to choose 7 things from the plane's left-over things... still this day sucked.... big time..... the only thing that made me happy was the fact that our bigkasan practice was a most productive day... we had nice actions for our song in the end....  malay ka na Pilipino, kagitingan mo'y isisigaw sa buong mundo... sa buong mundo...  that was half of the chorus of the song....  but all the same, my day was just like kurt angle.... it sucked.....  peace up, ryan here, signing out....

      DAMN!!! what a nice word to start this entry wouldn't you say? of course....  it was a very DAMNful week... actually, it's not even a week yet, it had only been four days since i made my last blog, so to let you know what happened to my outnumbered days.... here's an overview...   sunday...     okay, sunday wasn't that bad... morning began when i woke up, which is very obvious.... i brushed my teeth, ate breakfast, took a bath, put on some casual clothes and went on my way, we were going to our sunday school of course, i like to call it sunday school instead of calling it "church... when we got there, UECP that is, it was around 8:30am, our session was on 9:00am so we, we meaning me, my mother, my aunt and my brother... we went to eat in the sort-of-cafeteria in UECP, they were serving  misua ... oh yeah, they were also serving orange juice and coffee too, which are regularly served... (man, i've been using the word "serve" in this blog too many times...) FYI, the food is free... yes, you, the readers, read it right, it's FREE!!! the sweetest four-letter word i know in our english vernacular.... you just waltz in there and take whatever they got, just make sure you attended the sessions, which are held at different times.... after eating and after my mother and aunt talked to their friends, we made our way to our "sessions room", my brother is at a different room because the sunday school has age divisions... of course there were no room for elementary graduates so i joined my mother and aunt in the big session room...  at the middle of our pastor's preaching, christian texted me, so i replied.. (what useless things i'm putting here in this entry but oh well) i didn't tell him that i was in our sunday school so that i would have somebody to talk to except for myself... so we texted and we texted until the end of the pastors preaching... so after our session in UECP, we fetched my grandmother in a chinese drugstore and we ate at Sushiyum... and yes, you heard me right, Sushiyum not Sushiya, they're both different Japanese restaurant, another FYI... so after we ate lunch, we went home and i decided to study and finish biology once and for all for our monday's long exams... i did it after i ate dinner.... but finishing biology came at a price, i wasn't able to study technology at all!!! am i a good boy or what? and guess what, i didn't even try studying it coz i was very tired... then i slept.....  overall: it was a regular nice but not-so-special day   monday  damn... monday was full of surprises... surprises that won't make you screaming and running like an idiot, surprises in terms of unexpectedly taking very hard tests when you expected it to be a little easier... biology test was killer... i mean it would have killed me if i haven't squeezed the right answers out of my mind like i did... who cares about what happens to a potato anyway? i only know that you just slice it. cook it, eat it and THEN kill it... who cares about photosynthesis anyway? dorky scientists? not me, as if photosynthesis makes our lives easier and LIGHTer, i don't give a damn in what happens in photosynthesis... but i was able to answer the question worth 10 points about it, i'm not sure if i'll get the whole 10 points though... who cares about the ratio of the characteristics of children? the only thing i know is that the parents do something special that i would like to call  bonding, then they have a child or two or even more,  then the children inherit most of the characteristics and the circle of life takes place, the children grow up, the parents grow old and weak and die, the children would have found suitable mates and perform   bonding  and then so on..... technology test was fine, to be honest, it was very easy... so easy.... and then the values test... curse that regged test!!! curse it!!! it was the most difficult practical test i have ever layed eyes on...  overall: very bad day   tuesday      badASS!!! badass day for me...jackas* day for me also... first, i thought i had geometry all wrapped up,   but suddenly, i saw part of the test that wasn't explained by miss delmo, it was the find-the-other-endpoint thing-by using the given endpoint and midpoint.... damn, i thought i made the right formula for   the correct answer, but at recess, when i started to check my answer, it wasn't right!!! there were two numbers about that part each worth 10 points!!! you hear me?! 10 damn big points!!! hope miss delmo   gives consideration of those who exerted effort in answering that part... and if that isn't enough...   that was nothing compared to what happened in my livelihood education test!!! it was nothing i tell you!!! i forgot to check if there's a last page of the test!!! i consulted my teacher sir constatino, he said that   he'll decide to either ommit the unanswered parts or just deduct it... it was a f*ckful day...      overall: have you read anything i've written?! of course, it's obvious, today is the most badASS day ever      wednesday     just as i thought that i would get  a higher grade in the algebra test than in the geometry test, it turned the other way around... it turned out that miss estacio made several typographical errors that made my test even worse... i like our filipino test, it wasn't that hard, wasn't that easy... but still, the algebra test pissed me off!!! big time... that's why this day is one of my all-time hate-days... bigkasan practice cheered me up though... i get to spend some time with my classmates, friends and our teachers....  overall: what did you expect? of course, it's another damnful day   thursday   today wasn't that bad... it was awful... i thought the english test would be easier than the other exams but boy, it sure made me think a lot... it wasn't a no-brainer at all, the worst part is that i didn't finish the crossword puzzle part, i left 2 or 3 blanks and there were still the presence of my wrong answers... how could i be so careless... i should have studied a teenie-weennie harder... that isn't even half of it, our AP(araling panlipunan) test was a tough one also, i haven't read that much part of the book so i was kinda worried that i would screw up, and i did! but not that much... only a few mistakes... i just hated the damn darn essay... i just kept repeating my first statement until i have come up with more than 6 or 7 sentences... it was so not practical... i think... and if that wasn't enough, we had chinese classes after that...  after taking the exams, i went to the lobby with a few of my friends, we chatted, then i went to the fourth floor for our bigkasan practice, thank goodness that we hadn't practice in that deep compartment-like space in front of the computer room.... and i'm pleased to announce that we're done... we just need a little polishing little adjustments... we finished practicing at 12:40 or something.... we ate at country chicken, went to our damned chinese classes and attended another chapter of our bigkasan practice for the day...  overall: the least bad day of all the bad days, but it's still bad  5 days.... 1 good day, 4 bad days... ratio? 1:4.... meaning the bad days are dominant to the good days...  peace up, ryan here, signing out.....

       today can be defined as  day ja vou  all over again... same as last year, i study here in our study room,   by myself, with my brother going to his tutorial for the english long exams and my mother having to    accompany him, i was left alone once more in our humble abode... alone... with only 4 helpers   as company...      well, the test for monday comes in three sets, meaning three different test each concentrating   on three different subjects... we have to face these tests for only a day...for when monday ends, the   next set of tests will come in pairs.... luckily, on monday, one of the tests are about values ed....    yeah, it's all about the "values" that we should learn... blah blah blah.... i don't give a damn to    study it... because all you need is common sense, which i know everyone has but sometimes   neglected in answering tests... not that i have a great deal of this.......      anyway, i have just finished studying my biology notes which, i have to say, is very excruciating...   now, i'm starting to read our biology book.... at least, our biology book today has more   information and details about certain things than our utterly useless book last school year....   damn that book again.... in about two hours before noon, i texted christian... just wanted to ask    him something, and he did help a lot, check out the message i made above, it's a message   for all of my friends especially my closest ones... it just goes to show that people that are   gifted aren't always known by everyone... or something like that... well, to tell you(the readers)   the truth, i really made that message as a quote for somebody.... just don't mind that...    hehehe... first time i showed my laughter in my blog... anyway, after a not so long time of    texting, christian didn't reply, i don't know why but i'm sure he has some sort of valid reason,   because i didn't want to annoy him, i didn't ask him why he didn't reply anyomore... anyway, after    that, my brother and my mother arrived... then they ate lunch... then they slept... i didn't sleep though   because i really don't usually feel like sleeping in afternoons, only at times... while they were sleeping,   i get to watch wrestling without anyone bothering me, hurray for wrestling! i really pity eugene though,   beaten up by his favorite wrestler and deceived of having EVOLUTION as his friends...   well, he's a tough kid, he'll be back before triple H knows it... anyway, in about 5pm or so, i ate   pizza from Pizza Hut as my  merienda...  it was delicious... then i drank my milk and i took a bath...   oh yeah, after i had my  merienda  my father came home and while i was taking a bath at about 7:15pm,   he left, i don't know where... oh well... after taking a bath, we ate dinner.... it was a real treat to eat    fried chicken again.... then, i watched cartoon shows with my brother and then, i'm writing this entry...   well, that's my day.... i'm thinking of making my next entry as an article about our class... i'll even give   you a little sneak preview, my next entry's title might be " The Wage Of A New War has Dawned Before Us"   naks.... kind of long title though.... have a good night sleep y'all...        peace up... ryan here, signing out....

      hey, to my friends, fellows, classmates or who the heck, this is my first blog, you have to give me some credit, as you can see, i did this blog at the chinese exams night...  so first of all, welcome to my blog!!! i know it's not that great yet but i'll "enhance" it along the way  please, if any of you (the readers), have any suggestion or comment, just post them so that i could make some improvements, okay??? okay....  so about my title.....  as everyone would know about now, except for the non-"shekians"(i don't like the name). the damn chinese exams are over.... well, at least for the first quarter...  BUT  the punishment has just begun, for less than 72 hours, we shall once again suffer the torment that is our english exams.... damn, i wish i would at least reach the overall average of a fifth-honored.... well, as i see it, my grades aren't that cracked up to be because i have not been studying well these days, maybe because of social problems(class war), poor time management(wow, i'm applying values ed) or i'm just plain lazy....  in fact, i have not been myself these past few weeks, some of my friends noticed that i have changed a bit (i don't know if it's for the worse or for the better though), but that's my little secret.... but i felt that i have "returned" to my "original-self", if you may... i'm becoming more ryan-like once more because of an intresting conversation that made me realize the person i am..... sorry if i'm talking nonsense....  well, this is my first blog and i hope y'all would like it... just live with it, okay?  peace up... ryan here, signing out.....
