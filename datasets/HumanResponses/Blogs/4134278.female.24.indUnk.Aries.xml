      By MacKenzie Craven, Senior Writer A freshman was last week accused by the Recording Industry Association of America of using his computer network card to copy MP3s. Ankit Patel, a business major, is one of at least six students since November who have been accused by companies like the RIAA of "bootlegging music files off of the Internet," according to Tobias Braiser with the Division of Libaries and Information Systems. The Office of the Provost has given Computer Services permission to disconnect the network from the student's rooms. Computer Services is obligated to disconnect from the network any computer operating a server without proper permission. Patel and the other students have been called into Computer Services, and their network access has been removed from their computers. Patel claims that the copying wasn't done from his computer. He believes the wires were mixed up, causing RIAA to wrongly identify his computer. "I think someone on the hall has done this," Patel said. "Either they've got a program or somehow the USC program that was scanning it wasn't efficient enough, but when they scanned it, it turned out it makes it look like it was coming my computer." According to Brasier, Computer Services can find out which sites students access. Each computer hooked up to the network is assigned a number, and each part of the mainframe (e-mail, Websites) has a different log number. Computer services monitors which computer accesses which site and has tools that can help detect if a networked computer is operating any servers, including FTP servers, which distribute music files. Students aren't allowed to operate servers from their on-campus dorm rooms. Braiser warned that students should be aware of the seriousness of this issue. Eventually, he said, the RIAA will not be so lenient with students. The system is orchestrated so the university protects students. The RIAA can look up a computer's number and the university's name, but not the student's name, when they suspect copyright problems. The university is contacted, and it proceeds by matching the student with computer number. For Brasier, the message is simple: "Don't infringe on someone else's copyright," he said. To prevent problems, Brasier recommends that students be aware of everyone who has access to their computers because it only takes a few minutes for someone to access a Web site and download a file. According to the RIAA Web site: "Recording artist and record companies are excited about the opportunities that the Internet offers. "But if a viable marketplace is ever to evolve from these opportunities, the rights of recording artists and record companies must be respected. That means that uses of music on the Internet must be licensed."

      By MacKenzie Craven, The Gamecock  Bigwords.com was asked to leave campus Wednesday by Russell House reservationist Jennifer Barrineau. Bigwords.com offers textbooks to students at discount prices along with clothing and other college accessories. They came to campus Wednesday to perform some fashion makeovers but they weren't able to stay long because they were breaking a state contract. "For the bookstores, it's their business, so we are cutting into their profits," Kim Sinclair, Bigwords.com's regional manager. "The reason why we are out here is to save college students some money, and college is expensive enough as it is, "Sinclair said. "I think actually the student union itself had pulled all the dot-coms from being able to have tables they slipped through at the last minute," Sinclair said. "They waited until yesterday to stay we couldn't have a table, probably in hopes we wouldn't be able to do anything, but instead we just took the organization Alpha Tau Omega and just walked around campus," said John Bates of Bigwords. However, according to Russell House Director Carmaela Carr, they never had permission to be on campus. The student representative turned in the request for space early on Tuesday afternoon. The reservationist called the contact name late in the afternoon and informed him that the reservation was denied. "The vendor cannon go beyond their table. They have to stay seated at their table," Carr said. "Students have to freely approach your table." The reservation was denied because according to a memo sent from "Business Affairs Director Richard Wertz, the only book company allowed on campus is Wallace Company. The memo cited a policy instituted in 1997 by the university. The proposal indicated only Wallace Company would be allowed to sell books on campus. This contract became a state and USC contract. "It seems like its minimizing students' right to not let somebody market for something they obviously need. To give textbook stores the monopoly that seems so unfair to me," Bates said. "They have exclusive contracts with the outsource bookstores. Not a lot of money goes to the school, and yet the school won't let the students have the choice," Bates said. "They have us a permit and then they called us up last minute and left a message for somebody, and they just came and asked us to leave," Bates said. "If they wouldn't have give us a permit and let us know before hand, then we wouldn't have marshaled so many people to come here." However, Carr said there is no type of permit issued. Once a request for a reservation has been approved, the holder of that contract receives a confirmation. "That student organization needs to have a written confirmation on hand, fully signed and executed that's on our books," Carr said. They solicited all around campus. According to the Columbia Campus Policy, solicitation involves distributing advertising or other materials. If they had permission, they would only be allowed to distribute information from designated tables on Greene Street and the Russell House Patio. They also broke the policy when they hung flyers on trees, violating the distribution of literature rules at USC. Bigwords.com is frustrated with the situation. "We received information that allowed us to be on campus. As far as the school is concerned, they were correct," Sinclair said. "We acted completely unknowingly."
