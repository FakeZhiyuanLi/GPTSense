      His vigor is great, his strength monstrous, but, greater than both, is his sense of honor immeasurable.  The Orc, like most orcs, lived in a villiage in the mountains. Great warriors lived in the village, and they all owed their allegiance to the chieftain. Life was good, but very hard.        One day treacherous orcs came to the villiage. Through devilry most foul, the chieftain was forced to make the villiage swear allegiance to the newcomers. Afterwards the chieftain left the villiage and killed himself.  The Orc, along with the other warriors, were honorable, and upheld their oath to the usurpers. One by one the warriors fell. The last warrior is The Orc.  One day men came to the villiage. They killed the usurpers, and the women, and the children and took the men as slaves. The Orc fought bravely, but was subdued and enslaved.  The Orc has sworn revenge on the murderers of the usurpers. His master was murdered, and he is honor bound to avenge his master.  One day he will avenge his masters. Afterwards, having no master to serve, he will travel into the wilderness, committ suicide, and die with honor.   -----   The Orc follows a strict code of honor. This code might include the following commandments:  - Never suffer an elf to live. - Never run away. - Never take prisoners. - Never owe debt. - Never defy master. - Never touch a corpse. - Never show friendliness. - Never break an oath.  [NOTE 1: While all the items in the code of honor appear rigid, note that every item can be followed with the clause "by choice."]  Should the group encounter The Orc, he will be reasonably cooperative as long as they all have the same goal. This doesn't mean he'll be friendly, or nice, but he'll suffer that they live. Though he lives to die, he doesn't have a death wish, nor is he stupid. He is going to make sure that he lives to kill his master's killer and to finally kill himself. As long as the group is directly pursuing that goal, he'll suffer that they live.  His race is one of suffering. They suffer mountains dominated by dwarves. They suffer being slaughtered by men. They suffered the thievery of the elf god who stole Gruumsh's eye. They are damned to live in cold mountains, wrapped in stinking animal hides, eating rotting flesh. The Orc sees this as a punishment undeserved, but stoicly accepts his place in the world.  The Orc stands 5'10". His skin is deep olive, and his hair long and black. He is finely muscled and compact. He wields a gigantic greatsword, three times the size and wieght of a normal weapon (in game terms I increased the weight by 3; instead of weighing 15 lbs. his sword weighs 45 lbs. The only game effect I can see is the sword requiring a certain strength to be useable).   -----   [NOTE 2: My fucking internet decided to be a fucking dipshit. I got logged off and it erased my first post before I could get it up. GOD DAMNIT!! I've had to write this fucking thing twice!!]  [NOTE 3: I edited this post, but the fucking blog/internet decided I didn't.  Fucking shit.  This is probably why I don't do this more often.]

                  "I, am Endle Weirwood.  Son of Aran and Shandara Wierwood. Brother of Karri Wierwood."     "I was born in the Gem of the North where my family serves the house of Torm.  My father is a paladin of the Loyal Fury and has faught many battles, but his kind heart still shines through no matter the action in which he takes.  My Mother is of no station within the House of Torm, but still poses the strength, will, and sometimes healing powers to aid in Torm's fight against all that is evil.  I also have a sister, Karri Wierwood, who has wishes to become a priest, though she is still a little young for such."           "One might ask as to why I have not followed in my Father's footsteps and take up the call and become a paladin of Torm.  As I have told my Father in the past, there are more ways to serve Torm than simply becoming a paladin.  For I hope to bring the power of magic to bear along with the sword of Light.  Father still hopes that I will one day return to him and take up the call, I may still yet.  With Father's approval I took up an apprenticship with of old and wise wizards at the Lady's College.  I was fortunate to be accepted by the old elven wizard Nym Moonbreak, Father is friends with Nym since he and the head of the temple ask him for magical help at times."           "As I was growing up in Silverymoon I gained many friends of different parentage.  I had friends that were dwarven and elven, as well as humans.  I even had friends that were a mix between some of them too!  My greatest Dwarven friend was also a friend of the family, Durg Stoneshield.  He was the main stonemason who helped to work on the temple of Torm.  He enjoyed being around the youth of Silverymoon, always said he enjoyed the flame of youth.  Course we liked him since he was always nice in telling stories of his battles and how the walls which he helped to create were always impenetrable.  He taught us also how to work stone, said 'stone is a migh'y friend to have on your side, cause its always there and it don' like ta be forced ta move!'  When Nym had told me that my apprenticeship was nearly complete, I told this to Durg and he had one of his friends that was good at the forge make a quarter staff of mithral, so that I would always have some stone to fall back to."           "As I have said I have had many friends growing up, but I do not time to name them all.  However, there were some who were my most loved.  Durg being one of them as is Nym and another is the Paladin Lord of our temple: Maldin Everstand.  Along with him and my Father and Mother, I learned of the ways of Torm. He told us of the great things which Torm had done as well as those actions taken by his followers in defending the innocent.  Father and he are good friends having faught in many a battle side-by-side.  I used to watch them practice their fighting skills in sparring matches as a child.  They taught me all that they could about the ways of Torm, and if one didn't know the answer to one my questions, the other would chime in with what they thought might be the right one.  I have learned much from them. In the hopes that I might one day become a mighty paladin to fight for Torm, they taught me to fight some when I was older and before I had taken up an apprenticeship with Nym.  Maldin is a great man and I love him just as much as I love my Father."           "When I had become the apprentice of the elven wizard Nym, I had no idea what I was in for.  He is a very old wizard, with a kind heart, and plenty of patience to spare.  He was more than happy to have me as an apprentice and was willing to teach me many things about the Weave.  He told of the mythals of old and said that though I might not be able to create such, due to my short life span that I could still hope.  I had told of a time when I had seen a wizard conjure up some sort of magic armor to defend himself in a duel and that I wanted to learn such an art, so that I might be able to aid those of Torm.  And from then on I became a Abjurer, studying under Nym.  I knew Nym was not of the faith of Torm, but he still understood my faith, and he told me once that 'Faith is the most powerful defense of all, for it has the power to call down the Gods to come to your aid.'  Nym also told of many other forms of defense, such as being able to the enemy before they see me.  One day nearing the end of my apprenticeship he told me that it was time to see what I had learned and gave me the task of going out into the world to test my new skills.  I said that the task shall be done and that I would return once it was done, he was glad to here such.  As a gift beyond the knowledge in which he had already given me, he also gave a cloak of his people saying that 'though I cannot give you an armor better than your faith in Torm, I can at least give you this to help hide you when the time is dire indeed.'"           "I have left the Family that I love so much and the people of whom I care the most for, may Torm protect them always, and may he grant me strength to fight the evils of this world."

      Well as you all know we hit a turning point in the story recently, the first big climax was reached. Galimar is defeated. Mysteries still remain though. What of the people with the scailed skin? the Zentarim? the mysterious artifact network? why has a once kindly elven wizard become a recluse and quick to anger? Why would powerful barbarians and wizards place them selves under the service of a simple merchant like Galimar? Was Galimar even the one being served?   All these are qestions the wait to be answered. And this is where you come in. What parts of Faerun do you wish to visit? Are thier treasures you wish to seek? Glory you wish to find? Wealth you wish to obtain? Comment and let me know.  And remember, the more character history you give me, the more I may work it into the story.

      So I was thinking of some changes to the game. If you all find some of these appealing they may help make the game more dynamic in its chanlenges and let the more utilitarian characters shine brighter. Read more for the details.    1. We battlemat encounters. This would slow battle down but you would know exactly where you stand in battle. The disadvantage is you may discover your area of effect attacks hurt allies more, and I may remember that you can't flank this guy becuase his back it to the wall. The upside is you will always know if your withing 30 ft. And you will know exactly how far you need to run to get away from the enemy.  2. Allowing Races with level adjustments for new characters. The advantages here are pretty obvious. You could potentially switch to a race with exicing natural abilities. The disadvantage is that they generaly also have notable weaknesses. And while I will not go out of my way to put you up against enemies that can exploit your weaknesses, reoccuring enemies will probably learn about your nature and use that to thier advantage in the future. Basicy with level adjustment characters the fights may radically swing from easy to very hard. Yes a good DM could work around that, but I'm not sure I'm there yet.  3. More emphasis on skill point use. This would probably reduce the number of monster encounters you face but would put more skill bassed delimas in your way. Things like trying to find out how to get into a secret society. Finding the text they has the location of the archmages anchient laboratory. Finding a way to cross the chasm. Getting through the enemie lines to assasinate the orc chieftan. These offer some fun potential, but they would make each adventure more linear, at least at first as I learn, and take much of the focus off the biggest damage dealers. This would probably also encorage the use of the none combat spells more.  Discuss what you think of this idea below.

      Dungo Dagbar. An unassuming name. An unassuming face. An unassuming size. Sticky little fingers. Stealthy little body. These are but a few of the things one could say about the incomparible Dungo Dagbar.    Dagbar is short, even by halfling standards. He has reddish brown curly hair, and not a spot of facial hair. In fact, Gond was quite stingy when handing out hair to the little halfling. He travels in mostly gray outfittings, as he prefers not to be noteworthy.   Dungo hails from the forests of Chondalwood, where he learned his trade from a long line of burglars. His father was a rogue. His mother was a rogue. His grandmother was a roguish Madam. As one can see, Dungo Dagbar had but one choice. To steal stuff.   Dungo considers the Reverend Stumbleduck of the Church of Gond to be his closest confidant.&nbsp; The conversion to Gond almost surely saved the little halfling from falling to the dark side like the Hexblade would have him do. Other close friends are Silvanus the druid, his trustoworthy wolf, the afformentioned Hex, and the mysterious Raven.&nbsp;One of his&nbsp;other travelling companions include an incessantly good wizard, who, while frustrated by very often, he grudgingly respects. Last but not least is the mysterious asian monk who recently joined their ranks. Dagbar is not sure he understands the monks motivations, but finds him to be a worthy fighting companion.   Dungo is a member of the powerful Night Raptors thieves guild based out of the shady town of Luskan. He is proud to have recently defeated the evil Galimar, and hopefully can expand the guild of the Raptors into Calimport. Nothing would make him happier.   In short, Dungo Dagbar is a spritely man, full of many surprises. To quote the great John F. Kurtzenbaum, "ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can steal from your country."

      &nbsp; For those who know Solomon, you have probably noticed his grim outlook on life. See Solomons parents were shady people themselves and were killed when Solomon was only 5. He hasnt found the killer YET. Being by yourself on the streets of Kalisham is bad enough but its much worst when you are only 5.  Solomon soon started working with the local "unsavoreys" under a crooked merchant named Galimar. They found out he could get into places undetected because of his size that they couldnt. But soon he started to grow. By the time he was 17 he was already towering over people at 6'4". He soon learned the advantages of this, he started wearing a long black robe that covered his hands and face and learned to use his deep hollow voice with the look.&nbsp; Dark as it might be he liked people being scared of him when they first thought of the grim reaper when they saw him. Also since a very young age Solomon&nbsp;"felt" different, he has only recently gotten an idea that he&nbsp;is of dragon heritage and he yearns to unless that power.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He worked for Galimar and prospered, he was actually content in his work and life. Until one day when he was sent to accompany a gnome cleric to check on the progress&nbsp;of a job in the woods. Where as the orcs that were running the job attacked them. He quickly made way of them and freed the captives running the machine.&nbsp;They went back to&nbsp;Galimar to confront him where he had them attacked and put on a slave ship.&nbsp;His new companions and himself took the ship let the slaves loose and the gave them the ship. He has befriended his new companions. He finds the small ones humorous and likes&nbsp;the druid but doesnt understand his love for the forrest when he could be in a city. Also lately a eastern monk and a&nbsp;snooty wizard have joined their ranks.&nbsp;He likes the monk greatly for he seems very trustworthy and will probably grow to be a great fighter, even without a weapon.&nbsp;Wizards are always useful so he doesnt mind having him around but their views are very different, so its alittle hard to see where he is coming from.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Until recently&nbsp;Galimar was Solomons only goal, but finally he got to finish business.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was thrilled when he finally saw&nbsp;Galimar&nbsp;cowering under a&nbsp;desk (what a perfect way for him to go) and cut in 2. he is still laughing inside. He doesnt know what to do now I guess he will&nbsp;persue his&nbsp;quest for power and riches and hopefully find the ful power of&nbsp;the dragon blood that runs through is veins.&nbsp;

      Raven. Who is he? Whey does he aid the party? What does he stand to gain? What is his job? Read More on this episode of NPC Outlook to find out.     Raven has started to become a familiar face in the north of Faerun. The adventurers have come to find him an allie, even before they found any real reason.  Raven first appeared when the party found themselves trapped in Luskan when the Brother Hood of the Arcane had put the town in lockdown and was searching for some unknown person or object. The party wanting to find a way out of Luskan where fortunate to find raven. He simply asked them to deal with a group of men that would appear at a specified address. Raven would then provide their escape.  The next time they met raven was in Miribar. This time was specifically strange in that he had no aparent motivation to help them other than some unspecified common enemy. As such, he gave his information and left them to their own.  The third time they met his was after the battle of Silvervein. There he congragulated the party on their success and proposed another deal. If the party would re-establish trade with mitheral hall for raven he would provide them with a way to repair the town and to alow them to finally stop galimar. It was at this time that they confirmed that Galimar was their shared enemy.  But what does Raven do? He quietly slips in and disappears with almost no one noticing. He always has what's needed and seams to be imune to the authorities. There has been much speculation, but only one member of the party can say for sure. The little halfling rouge, in a bold move that impressed raven asked outright to join his guild. Raven agreed, and upon the completion of the guild test the little halfling found out that Raven was the leader the strongest thieves guild in the northern sword coast, the Night raptures.

      Galimar. Who is he? What is his motivation? Why does he hunt our adventurers? What will it take to stop him? Read More to find out.   Galimar was first met on at the beginging of the adventure. He had hired a couple of the adventurers to help with a logging project. Little did the adventurers know that this is where the trechery would begin.  As they reached the destination of the job they found a number of orcs had made an encampment. It would turn out that this was part of a trap by Galimar to use the adventurers as slaves in his orcish logging machine. This is where is treachery would began. The next meeting would reveal the depths of Galimars evil roots.   The adventurers returned to Calimport to confront the decietful merchant, thinking that he would cave under their preasure. It was then when he used his two large bodyguards to capture the party and send them on a slave ship to his mine in the north.  The hero's would liberate the slave mine in thier own escape. But this valiant deed would have its price. From then on there was a price on the parties head. Every where they would go they would have to watch out for mercenaries and hired hands, reaching for the vile reward.  Now you have read about the vile deeds of Galimar, but what motivates him? And what will stop him? We do not know yet. Hopefully the adventurers will find out soon. When they do check back here and you will find the story completed.

                Silvanus was born in the forests of Chondalwood and from a very early age his parents noticed he has an affinty for all things nature. As a young boy he seemed to have a good time being outside even more so then the normal Elven boy. He did not seem interested as much as other childen his age in the pursuit of the arcane. Instead he seemed to love nature so much more. When he turned 120 he befriened a wolf named Silverfang. He found this wolf one day while taking a walk in the woods and found it orphaned because some human trappers had kill his mother. At that point in time Silvanus decided that he was going to take care of his new found pet and raise it till adulthood. Although when Silverfang did reach adulthood he did not seem want to leave his good friend. So Silvanus decided to allow him to stay with him and be his companion.    One fateful day on his 125 birthday. Silvanus was out in the forest tending to his animal friends and playing with Silverfang he heard a great rumbling. Being intrested in what this great noise was he decided to invesigate it. What he found to his great horrow was a group of Orcs tearing apart his precious homeland and home to his animal friends. It was a giant machine that was being run by a small group of orcs. Being outraged Silvanus chaged after them disregarding the fact that he was outnumbered. He wanted to protect the forest at all costs. So he attacked the orcs and wound up getting captured and forced to help run this machine to tear down more of his precious forest. This was when Silvanus reliazed that he had a calling to protect the forest and stop creatures from destroying nature. While he was captured he met a halfing namedDungo Dagbar that tried to help him escape. They tried to escape but to no avail they where just caught again and forced to tear down more of the forest.  They both had to continue to tear down the forest until he was saved by a very large human and a short gnome. When he was finally freed he decided that he wanted to help out these newly meet compainons and go after the person responsible for this. He found out that is was a very powerful merchant named Galimar from the town of Calimport. So then he joined them in the journey to Calimport and take out this merchant. Little did all of them know that Galimar wasnt such an east target and they all found themselves being sold as slaves on a boat on the way to Luskan. But through the heroic efforts of the halfing, gnome and human they were able to overtake the boat and set themselves free and set all the other slaves on the boad free also.  While he was traveling with his compainons in search of greater knowledge of all things natural. They traveled to the Famed Mithril Hall and meet the famous Drow Drizzt Do'Urden. While he was there he talked to Drizzt and became fascinated with the way that he wielded two Scimtars at one time.So then Silvanus himself decided to undertake the path necessary to learn to dual wield and someday dispatch vermin as quickly as the famous Drow.  A new chapter has started in Silvanus life. He has helped his companions defeat the evil merchant Galimar. Now that he has avenged the destruction of his forest he faces a dilemma. He is now sure what he is to do now. Should he travel back home and resume life as normal, or should he stay with his new found friends. Silvanus decided on the day that he helped defeat Galimar that his work is not done yet. He feels he has made some good friends and feels that he could help protect nature and defeat evil. Silvanus is going to adventure and find out what the future holds for him.   BTW this is a work in progress so it is not done man.I would like any comments u guys have to add to my story.

      *short by Gnome standards.  Gnomes are pretty short, but their histories are not known for the same virtue.   Rev. Gernot, as he allows his "Gnomenclature-challenged" friends to call him, hails from the City of Anchoril on the island kingdom of Lantan.  Growing up in a world of gnomish artifacts and gadgets, he was intrigued in all manner of mechanical apparatus from an early age.  After primary school, during which he also assisted his father in the family smithy, he was originally enrolled in the Sambar Dual Institutes of Alchemy and Alchemical Fire Response Training, where he was easily surpassed by his brighter (and more reckless) classmates.  Gernot simply did not show the aptitude for work with dangerous alchemical compounds, though he was intrigued by the few samples of smokepowder provided by the local Temple of Gond.  Wanting to know more about this interesting concoction, and assured that he would certainly recieve higher marks in his classes with a steady supply of the material, he entreated the Gondian clergy for more experimental material.  After several trips to the Temple, Gernot became more and more comfortable in the surroundings, and realized that the initiates at the Temple were more like himself than the students at the Institute.        Possessed of a new purpose, he returned to his family home in Anchoril and announced his new direction in life.  His father, a weaponsmith, agreed to fund his enrollment at the Temple, and Gernot became an Initiate in the Church of Gond.  In keeping with the Church's teachings regarding the value of deeds over words, Gernot hired himself out to employers along the Faerunian coastline, acting as both a healer and a troubleshooter, a specialist in the area of mechanical devices.  On one of these missions, Gernot was hired along with a fearsome, scythe-wielding warrior known only as "Solomon" by a merchant named Galimar in order to investigate some sort of woodcutting device of orcish manufacture.  Upon reaching their destination, Gernot and Solomon realized they had been betrayed by Galimar, and became embroiled in a fiasco, finding themselves allied with the unlikely companions of a local druid named Silvanus and a sneaky little halfling named Dungo Dagbar. With this incident began their long journey of retribution against the villainous Galimar.  Gernot has traveled through a large part of the Realms in his travels, with an ever-increasing bounty on his and his companions' heads. He and his companions, which now include a mysterious martial artist from the East and a reserved yet powerful wizard from Silverymoon, have defeated many a foe.   Gernot continues to spread the good word of Gond in his journeys, and has indeed converted two of the members of his party, the mysterious hexblade and the stealthy halfling, to the faith of Gond, enabling them to recieve Gond's full blessings when they are healed.  Gernot has continued extolling the virtues of a life of crafting, creation, and invention, and helped found and protect a mining town named Silvervein, but popularly known as Gondor, in the northern reaches of the Sword Coast.  Gernot currently has plans to construct a sort of mechanical bodyguard and assistant known as a Gondsman, and has visited the High Holy Crafthouse of Inspiration in the city of Illul on Lantan in order to pass the Trials and recieve the manual.   He continued his adventures with his companions in order to bring Galimar to justice and stop his destructive business practice, and this chapter was finally brought to an end when the wrathful adventurers descended upon Calimport, Galimar's base of operations, carving a swath of blood and destruction directly to Galimar's front door.  Galimar's final moments, cowering and whimpering under a table, were far from noble, and Gernot feels a hint of regret for what he considers may have been too hasty a solution.  It remains to be seen where Gernot's adventures will lead him, but for now, he does his best, acting, crafting, and inventing in the service of Gond.        Gernot is a tallish gnome with a large brown moustache.  He wears a saffron-colored robe with a red sash full of small tools, odds and ends in the style of the Gondian clergy, as well as a blue traveling cloak and a feathered smith's hat.  His holy symbol is an enchanted mithril shield in the form of Gond's toothed cog, and he carries an enchanted mithril hammer of Dwarven manufacture, which he acquired in Mithril Hall.  He still nurses an affection for the Gondian smokepowder, and has plans to train in the use of the matchlock-style firearms manufactured and controlled by the Church.

      Ok, Some stuff to note. I got some really great suggestions form Joe last night about the FR games. To bad he didn't mention them untill he was heading out of the freaking state. My thanks to you anyways Joe. Read more to see the ideas.     First off he suggested more random/casual/frequent interaction with the more famous NPC's in the book. I had actualy been avoiding using to many of the more famous characters. I guess some of darths complaints about FR having to many NPC's rubbed of as a comment from people in general. I think this is a situation I will quickly remedy unless anyone has a problem with this.  Second suggestion. More descriptive dungeons for the adventure. This I will say is my fault. Its hard to find that balance between nice descriptions that keep it interesting yet not so long that they start killing the flow. The entrance to the random dungeon on the sword coast was given as an expample of something I did well. Unfortunatly the worlds crappiest dungeon followed after. I will also try not to procrastinate to the point where I just don't have time to derive adequate descriptions.  Finnaly there was a request for more two part adventures. So far we have had a nice over enveloping story. But each week has also been self contained. This suggestion is one that I would like to hear all your opinions on. Sometimes a multi night adventure can give things a more epic feel, but it can also make that adventure feel less whole. So let me know what you think of the "to be continued" adventure.  On another note, as you all have now become to strong for the average random encounter on the road I am going to try and replace those with more random side quests. Last week you found out a young dragon was cuasing some problems, mabee next week there will be trolls rampaging. Basicly I will offer these for some mindless slashing fun, but you will have to look at them. Head on down to the tavern and ask for some info, look for the town buliten board, see what jobs are availible. Whe knows, some of these may even help you complete the main campaign.  I really apricitate this kind of feedback. Make sure you all let me know what you like and don't like. It can only make things better.
