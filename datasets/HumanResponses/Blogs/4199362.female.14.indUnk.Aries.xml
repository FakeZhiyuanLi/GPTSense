      Well for starters if you can't tell I'm a Harry Potter freak. I've read all the books at least ten times (except for the fifth, I've only read it twice, it's not my favorite) I also have a lot of the extra books such as: The Ultimate Unofficial Guide to the Mysteries of Harry Potter, The Magicial Worlds of Harry Potter, So You Think You KNow Harry Potter, and Quidditch Throughout the Ages and Fantastic Beasts and where to find them.  I'd have to say that my favorite characters are the Marauders and Lily. I'm more of a past fan as it were. I do like Harry, Ron, and Hermione but Lily and James are better in my boook. I roleplay on a few sites, such as neopets, and I usually roleplay as Lily in past roleplays. I'm best at getting into her head. Yet as you can see my fanfic is mostly about Sirius, that's just how I roll. I'm not only about Harry Potter but that's what this site is going to be about. Sorry if you think I'm a dork, nerd, freak, and/or loser, its just something I like a lot.  I'll be posting most of my findings and such here, because I've needed a place to. So if you like it that's great if you don't then don't check it out! Later Dudes! -Shelby

                                      CHAPTER 1 What ever happened that day had been a mystery to Sirius. He had just been a by stander, a looker on. Well he enjoyed it, was that wrong? Was he being a bad friend to James? No of course not, he thought, as he walked the silent corridors that led to the astronomy tower at so late an hour.   He had to go there. He had to go over everything that had happened. Was he just hoping that it had happened or had it been real?  Six years of knowing James had it for Lily Evans didn’t change the fact that in the back of his head, he too had a thing for the petite and saucy red head. The fact that she had it for him too was almost too much.   Going back several hours to the events of that day Sirius thought over the absurdness of it all. Going there so much to stare out the massive open windows that were more like gateways to the sky, was where you would find Sirius when he wasn’t joking around with his fellow Marauders. Sirius, though he never admitted it to anyone let alone himself, had a serious side. Whenever he went up to the astronomy tower outside of class, he would stare out at the horizon and think about his family and how he was shaping up to be the “white sheep” as it were, and many of his other woes.   	Though proud to be a Gryffindor Sirius always wondered, shouldn’t he be more like his family, and if so why wasn’t he? Oh well that wasn’t on his mind at the moment. What, or really who, was on his mind was Lily.  	Sirius had gone up the astronomy tower earlier to think as usual, but not as usual, he wasn’t the only one up there thinking. Sitting with her legs dangling at least one thousand feet off the ground, staring out the window was Lily Evans.   	“What’s this Evans?” he had said to her on sight. He had startled her, but what did he care, that was his job, to be on her bad side with his good-hearted but sometimes cruel humor. “Lost your way? Potter’s down at Quidditch.” She looked up at him with those green eyes of hers, and something was different about them. He couldn’t quite put his finger on it, but there was something there he hadn’t noticed before.  	“’Lo Black.” She had said as he had walked over and sat down in the same window but not quite beside her.   	“What brings you up here Black?” she had asked him. He watched her; she wasn’t being mean, or nice for that matter. Something was up.  	“I’m up here to think my dear Miss Evans.” He had said with a grin and lay back with his head resting head on his hands. “Now what brings you up here Lils?” he had asked in returned. He had watched her out of the corner of his eye, but hadn’t acted very interested.   	“Same reason.” She had said simply. Lily had then let out a small sigh. “May I ask you a question Black?” He tilted his up to get a better view of her when she asked this. What could she have to ask him?   	Sirius stopped he was at the door of the astronomy tower again. “What a question!” he exclaimed. He went over the question again in his mind for maybe the hundredth time since she asked it. ‘Yes I have gone out with many girls.’ He had said in reply. ‘Didn’t really like many of them.’  	 	“Does James really like me as much as he says he does?” she had asked next.   	“In a manner of speaking yes, and he makes sure no other guys try to ask you out.” He had told her. It was the truth. The next events and things said after that defied James and his trying to be the only guy to ask Lily out. What had ended up happing was a kiss between Sirius and Lily.                                      CHAPTER 2 Sirius couldn’t rightly remember exactly how it had happened or what they had said. All he knew was that at one point he and Lily were kissing and he was to meet her there now. He stared at the door. Should he open it and become an even worse friend? He couldn’t decide. There were many reasons why he shouldn’t open it. James was his best mate. James had always fancied Lily, and had told Sirius so hundreds of times a day. But on the other hand, Lily obviously didn’t like James, she liked him Sirius, she had told him so. Sirius thought this over.  	He had always thought that Lily had actually fancied James as well; she just didn’t want to admit it. Those two were always fighting and it just seemed like it was sexual tension to Sirius. The tables had turned in the favor of Sirius. He always took up such great opportunities as these, but he had his own little fan club, did he really need Lily? Maybe James would never find out and Sirius could have his cake and eat it too?   	“Ah Prongsie! How could I do that to you?” he muttered, his loyal side showing through. James was like his brother, he was his best mate, and he couldn’t do this.   	“Maybe I was wrong,” he sat down on the top step and leaned back against the door. Dark hair fell into his eyes with ease giving him the look deep thought, which for once in his life was what actually was going on behind his dark brown eyes. He rubbed his chin as he thought; this was a tight fix. Gain and lose, lose and gain.  	“Oy Padfoot!” Sirius jumped at being disturbed from thought. ‘That voice, so familiar…’ mentioned the little voice in the back of his head. He looked up.  	“Prongs!” He acknowledged his best friend with a mixture of shock and relief. “What’d you upta?” he asked trying to hide his anxiety.  	“Lookin’ for Evans, what else?” said the hazel eyed boy as his hand shot up to his already messy raven hair and gave it rumple completely missing his friend’s unenthusiastic and worried tone. He grinned. “Good ole’ Evans, always in an interesting spot, what brings you up ‘ere mate?”   	Sirius thought for a moment, he couldn’t tell him the truth, but he couldn’t lie to his best friend.   	“Jus’ thinkin’,” he said simply ending his dilemma of what to tell James. “What makes you think Evans’ll be up ‘ere?” he hid his nervousness well.  	“Oh she’s up ‘ere alright. Saw her leave myself, waited a bit you know, jus’ ta make sure.” James glanced at the door. “Reckon she’ll come ‘round today?” he asked his friend hopefully.  	“ ‘Course she will, James.” Sirius gave him a forced grin and hoped it looked real enough for James’ sake. “If not today, there’s always tomorrow. You two are meant for each other, I’ve always said.” He half-heartedly added. 	“Thanks mate, keep your fingers crossed.” James made for the door and opened it cautiously. After peering inside he looked back to Sirius. “I was right, she’s up ‘ere.” He whispered and opened the door widely now.   	Sirius looked in the doorway. There she was sitting by the same large window as before, but she looked as if she done something different with her hair. Her stunning green eyes turned to them. Sirius almost couldn’t bear it. He couldn’t like Lily, she and James really were meant for each other, despite her objections. But what about himself, didn’t he have someone meant for him? Why couldn’t it be Lily? They would make a right pair the two of them…but so would she and James.   	Sirius looked away from those big green eyes, she was for James, and he knew it and he had to accept it. He looked over at James who was already jabbering to Lily, happy as a clam, his eyes adoring her as much, no more than Sirius’ had.   	“—Right, right Evans, studying the sky are ya so late at night when we don’t even have Astronomy tonight?” James was saying when Sirius finally tuned back in.   	“Oh give it a rest Potter!” Lily said exasperatedly. “Why are you up here? Better view of the Quidditch field?” she shot icily.  	“Nah Evans, thought I might catch a beautiful sight, and seems I have.” James said with a mighty grin and winking at Lily.   	Lily rolled her eyes and stared back out the window. “Why don’t you fall off your broom and break you neck Potter, you’ll be doing us all a great favor.”   	“Ah Evans, you know you like me,” James strode across the room and stood with his back to the window his elbows resting on the sill just by Lily grinning at her. “Admit it.”   	Sirius just watched. He could see that neither of them was about to give up and give in to the other. This was painful for him. Watching Lily being hit on by James had always given a twinge of grief, but now he couldn’t stand it.   	“Why don’t you to just snog and get it over with!” he bellowed at the two of them angrily. “Lily, you know you like him, and James put a sock in it before I jinx you!” he stormed out of the room slamming the door and crashing down the steps. His feet soon brought him to the Portrait of the Fat Lady.   	“Out so late are y—“ the Fat Lady began but Sirius cut her off. 	 	“Fizzing Whisbees.” He said curtly and she swung open before she could finish her sentence. Sirius stormed over to one of the over stuffed chairs in the shadows, flung himself down into it and stared moodily into the fire.                                                                CHAPTER 3 Sirius didn’t know how long he sat there. It had already been late, but now faint signs of the rising sun were starting to appear. He was wallowing in his emotions, thoughts buzzing around his head so violently he couldn’t really get a hold on one at all.   The portrait door swung open. Lily walked in first, looking quite flustered followed by James, who looked quite disappointed. The still fresh internal wound began to sting once more. He looked away from them both as Lily sat down in a chair not to far away, crossing her arms in a huff.  “You know we almost got caught, Potter, and its all your fault!” Lily shot at James icily.  “You were up there before I was, I didn’t do anything to you! What were you doing up there anyway?” James sounded quite flustered himself. He flung himself down in the chair opposite to Sirius, but was still looking over at Lily. This was no problem for Sirius; he didn’t want to talk to James anyway.  “None of your business Potter, now, if you please leave me alone!” she stood up and started for the girl’s dormitory. “I’m going to bed, luckily tomorrow is Sunday!”   James’ eyes followed her up the stairs as Sirius noticed out of the corner of his eye. They sat there in silence for a view moments before either of them talked. It was James who spoke first.  “What’s with her?” James asked finally turning to Sirius.  “Dunno…how long were you up there?” Sirius asked, hoping that it wouldn’t sound like he actually cared.  “Well…we got into a bit of a row as soon as you left…and heard Filch and had to get back with out gettin’ caught…by the way why were you so mad?”   “Er—no reason…jus’ tired I guess….” Sirius lied giving a fake yawn. He didn’t look at James, he couldn’t. He forced a grin and looked at the spot right above James’ head so it wouldn’t look quite suspicious. “So no luck with Miss Evans then eh?” he tried to sound like he would have if he actually cared, or rather like he didn’t want James to have had any luck at all.  “No…” the disappointed look returned to James’ already tired face. He yawned and stood up. “Well I suppose I’ll go to bed then, might get an hour or two in before lunch.” He smirked and headed up the stairs to the boy’s dormitory. “Night.” He called over his shoulder to Sirius.  “Night.” Sirius muttered as James was up the stairs. Though he hadn’t slept in way over twenty-four hours Sirius felt no more tired than he had been at any time he could remember. He sat in the over stuffed chair as the light steadily increased from pale grey to the brilliant rays of the morning sun. Several people had filtered into the Common room now but it was fairly empty still.  A small thud of someone walking the steps came from somewhere behind Sirius, startling him a bit. He turned round to face one of few people he had thought he would, or really wanted to.   “’Mornin’ Evans.” He said coolly. His dark eyes followed her to the seat opposite him. From the looks of it she had been up for long, and was still in her pajamas. She emitted a small yawn before answering him.  “’Morning. Please do tell me why you decided to leave me there with that git!” she demanded of him immediately. “You do know I don’t fancy him in the least!” she indignantly stuck out her chin and crossed her arms.  Sirius studied her startling green eyes with a surprised expression. The dark red hair fell pleasantly to her shoulders was slightly messy as if she hadn’t done much to it since she had awoken.  “Well I would think for someone who regards their intelligence as highly as you regard your own that you would have deduced that already.” He said haughtily with a hint of coldness behind it.  “No I have not figured why you got so flustered at me and James having a go at one another!” she shot brushing her hair back, ridding it of the signs messiness.   “Too bad, I—“  “You’re worse than he is! Jealous, that’s what you are!”  “Of my best mate?” Sirius was astonished at her guessing so quickly.  Lily nodded “Mhm. Of course, it wasn’t that hard to figure. You aren’t the hardest to read now are you?” she smirked slightly at this, her eyes resting on him now.  “You believe your right then?” He raised an eyebrow at her.  “—Yep—“ She nodded.  “—You sure bout that Lils?” He stroked his chin now watching her intently.  “—Mhm.” She nodded again.  “Well I’m not jealous!” Sirius crossed his arms and glared at her.  “Yes you are! Want me to prove it?”  “Go ahead!”                                      CHAPTER 4 “Okay.” Lily lifted her chin defiantly. “Find me Potter and let the games begin. Driving a wedge between the infamous duo of Black and Potter will be the highlight of my life.”  Sirius gave her a bark like laugh and stood up. “Very well my fair Lily. OY PRONGS! GET YOUR ASS DOWN HERE!!!” he bellowed loudly making Lily flinched slightly.   The door to the boys’ dormitory swung open and a pajama clad James walked out yawning widely and scratching the back of his head. He stumbled tiredly down the steps and over in Sirius and Lily’s general direction.  “Eh?” he managed through another yawn. He blinked a bit and noticed Lily. “Morning Lily.” He grinned stupidly at her.  “Morning James.” Lily smiled at him her eyes flashing. She smirked over at Sirius and then to the amazement of everyone in the Common Room, especially James and Sirius, moved closer to James, wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling her self up slightly onto her tiptoes and proceed to press her lips against his for several seconds before letting go breaking the kiss.   Sirius, as well as James, stood gawking at Lily. James sported a stupid grin and was the first to speak.   “Wow!” he raised his hand to his lips. “WOW!” he repeated. “Um…. GOOD morning!” he grinned ear to ear.   “What is wrong with you Lily?” Sirius suddenly shouted grabbing her by the shoulders and turning her to face him. “Are you mad? You kiss me then you kiss James! Who do you like? What does this prove? How could you—Why would you--Damnit all Evans, I thought you liked me!”   Lily only smirked knowingly up at him. “Later boys.” She said raising her eyebrows at the both of them and walked out of the common room.   “Uh…. Sirius?” James said after several minutes of silence. “Did Lily actually kiss you or did you kiss her?” he practically accused.  	Sirius glared over at James. “What do you think?” he said coolly through gritted teeth. He wanted to tear James limb from limb and James’ feelings were mutual.  	“I think you kissed Lily, who you know I’ve fancied for years, and have been trying to get to like me for years, and—“ Sirius cut him off. 	 	“Is it my fault she doesn’t like you, and likes me?!” he yelled at his former best friend.  	“I’d watch your back if I were you these days, Black, just might get what’s coming to ya.” James glared at Sirius, his hazel eyes full of fury.  	“Sure, Potter, Sure.”   	With that they both stormed off in separate directions, James back up to the dormitories and Sirius over to the portrait hole. The few people in the Common room watched them both muttering amongst themselves, shaking heads, tutting and other such things. It was a sad day in Hogwarts history when the two greatest pranksters Hogwarts had ever known had a row of a century over a girl.    	Lily sat in the library thinking over what she had just done. Bout time those two figured some things out. She thought. See Lily’s plan had nothing to do with breaking up the Marauders, as it must have seemed. Though she greatly disliked James she would never be so mean as to set he and Sirius against each other for no reason. The fact of the matter, she didn’t even like Sirius that much either, well not in that way at least, and she was hoping that they’d both understand why she was doing this eventually.  	“Lily, a word?” came a stern voice from behind her. It was Remus Lupin, her favorite of the Marauders, obviously here to talk to her about what she had just done.  	“Before you say anything Remus, please know that I have my reasons for this, and you of all people should understand why I am doing this.”  	“Of course! I came here to help you! Now what can I do?” Remus grinned at Lily’s surprise and sat down opposite of her. By the end of an hour they were both completely prepared and informed of the plan and ready to follow through.   	“Great Lily! Brilliant! And I must say about damn time!” Remus applauded her as he brushed the golden brown hair from his eyes and beamed at her. 	 	“Thank you! Now let’s get this thing over with! I don’t know how much I can kiss those two before I explode!” she giggled and they both stood up smiling and left the library. 	James sat on his bed thinking determinedly. A hand rested on his lips as he thought about what had happened a mere twenty minutes ago, but wait it hadn’t all been good. 	 	“I’m gonna kill Sirius Black!” he exclaimed out of nowhere and stood up. He rushed over to his trunk and started to pull of school robes and hastily put on. He then stormed out of the room with a look of defiance set on his handsome features.                                  CHAPTER 5	 James and Sirius didn’t have an incident for the rest of the day. They did of course meet a few times in the common room and dormitories but there were only hateful glares but no words. James’ vow to kill Sirius was put off until he came up with a good plan on how to do it, or that was what he decided as he changed for bed.  The day ended sourly and the night in boys’ dormitory was not the most pleasant ever in that room. The enmity between the two sixteen-year-old boys was so pronounced that the air was thick with it. The other sixth year Gryffindor boys ignored it as much as possible and slept as only boys can through such times.   The following week, aside from a few taunts and bickering, was quiet enough. James and Sirius glared at each other but stayed out of each other’s way. Lily and Remus decided that for the moment there was nothing they could do to further along the plan except let life go on. So when the second Monday after it happened rolled around they weren’t as on their toes as they should have been.   The Gryffindor entered the potions dungeon in a large group that day. Sirius and James were as far away from each other and as close to Lily as they could be doing both.  The group had nervously made there way down to the dungeons ready for a fight.   Because of recent events when the Gryffindors took their seats Sirius and James were left standing because they refused to sit with one another. The only seats left were by Frank Longbottom and…Lily Evans.   Frank Longbottom. A tallish, smart Gryffindor sixth year who played a chaser on the Gryffindor Quidditch team and was a fairly good friend of the Marauders, but had of late been more interested in Alice Prewett and was getting the elbows and chuckles of his fellow male classmates for sometime now.  The other boys weren’t into the whole romance thing like Frank was, but maybe they should have been considering most of the Gryffindor fifth and sixth year girls were dating Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs, well the ones that weren’t stalking Sirius. So maybe they should have taken a lesson from him.  Now it wasn’t that neither of them disliked Frank in anyway but they both wanted to get to Lily before the other had a chance to. Sirius was still a little mad a Lily but he was more concerned with the competition with James, and the same went for James as well.    The other Gryffindors watched them carefully out of the corners of their eyes, Remus and Peter watching the closest. Knowing James and Sirius this could go one of three ways. Wands, fists, or both. Now even the Slytherins were noticing the tension between the former best friends. Before anything could happen the professor walked in.   “Mr. Potter, Mr. Black. Take you seats so we can begin.” The professor gave them both a significant glare to show them that he meant it.  Sirius and James eyed each other for a moment before taking the seat nearest to them. Consequently the seating ended up with Sirius and Frank and James and Lily.   Halfway through the class James leaned back to Sirius and Frank.  “Wishing you were me Black?” he whispered which a menacing sneer from Sirius. James kept making a point to bump into Lily’s hand and other various body parts in just a way to get on Sirius’ nerves.  An hour or so later the Gryffindors plodded up the corridor leading out of the dungeons   and up to the Great Hall for lunch. The main thought going through the minds of the Gryffindors was why hadn’t James or Sirius taken the other out yet?  ‘Oh damn, I’m not sure this was the best idea… but they have to learn.’ Lily watched them both as closely as possible, which wasn’t hard, them both being a good seven or eight inches taller than her each and bother on either side of her. They weren’t too hard for her to spot.   ‘What if it doesn’t work? Where’s Remus? He’s supposed to be here help!’ Lily watched for Remus anxiously and kept an eye on James and Sirius as well as she could. ‘At least he should here to keep them from fighting, which is what’s bound to happen any second— Damn.’   The clock’s loud ticks and tocks added to the suffocating silence in a way to drive anyone mad. Sirius sat on a cot with a black eye, a swollen lip, and what looked like several broken ribs, not to mention a splitting headache as well, and James lay in the bed beside him still unconscious.   The events of the hours before played in his mind like one of those annoying muggle movies Arthur Weasley and Lily had always talked about. Arthur had been gone for several years but Sirius still remembered all about those bloody movies.   ‘The stupid projectors and wide screens, Arthur was so nuts. He’s working for the ministry I think, in something that has to do with muggles. He was a nice bloke. He was married now, to oh what was her name, oh yeah that red head Molly…Molly uh…. well Molly Weasley now. They had a kid didn’t they? Uh Charlie I think it was or Bill, maybe they have two…oh well…’  Well that’s how he was seeing the “disaster” now every time he closed his eyes, like a muggle movie. Sirius closed his eyes tightly, deciding that he needed to go through the “disaster” to see where it had gone wrong.   There had been less than ten feet left before the Gryffindors would have reached the Great Hall. The relief was so obvious on everyone’s faces you could almost taste it in the air, they had come this far with out an incident. That’s when it happened. Some how, it seemed, that James toppled down and took Lily down with him. From the look of it, or to Sirius rather, James was jumping Lily, which wasn’t a very James thing to do, but it didn’t matter to Sirius. It ended up being the straw that broke the camel’s back.   Sirius bent down and pulled James up off of Lily and before James had a chance to say anything, Sirius gave him a good hard right hook. James wasn’t the type to takes things laying down so within seconds there was a full blown out fist fight between the two young men. Their wands forgotten in their robes, fists everywhere. In the end it some how ended up with them both unconscious and some how they were brought up to the Hospital Wing. That was where Sirius sat now.  The tension had definitely escalated to a remarkable point.

      But sometimes I just get this need to be mad at my boyfriend. Like he doesn't even do anything and I just feel like being mean. Like I might be in a bit of a weird mood or something or he just does something that annoys me. Like when he has a friend over and he talks to me I dunno it bothers me a lot. Like now! I won't even say I love you back and I won't say goodbye. I dunno I mean it's not like it's that time of the month or anything but I dunno he annoys me sometimes. I love him. Don't get me wrong I really do, as much as I can at fourteen. I mean we're coming on a year now. It's just I dunno HE REALLY GETS ON MY NERVES!!! Not all the time but just sometimes. Oh like how he's become so obsessed with his little blog thing that that's all he does. I dunno I find that annoying and all he does is change the song! Jeez! And then theres messangers I dunno lately, since we started talking on the phone more I hate talking on messanger but he just IMs me and then when I say it annoys me he calls me. Oh and I didn't want his help on my french work today! It was a completely pointless call!!! I mean lately when we do talk on the phone he's muttering to himself about his blog and I'm just sitting there. It is cute but after like four hours of it its annoying. I'm totally not thinking about breaking up with him at all but sometimes a girlfriend's just got to vent. I love him more that anything and he's usually the perfect boyfriend but sometimes I get fed up with him. I mean no one's perfect or anything but he's great. But sometimes when I don't feel like talking he calls, and when I really really want to talk he's not there. It's rare but that's just how it is. I dunno I think it's just the fact that he's ike pretty much the only person I've seen all summer during the seven weeks that I've been staying home. I did go to quebec and go to two camps (one with him) and see a few friends but I dunno whatever. I love him and that's all that matters. I'm just easy to annoy sometimes and like to test the limits, so sorry Ira this was just venting I LOVE YOU!

      Well I finished my math and I only have three pages left in french but I still have two more poems to write and make my character web for A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. Because of that I'm still grounded and all so I told Ira just to go to his friend's party and all. Gah plus I'm definately getting sick! I dunno...kind of a blah day but okay other wise. I watch 100 most shocking moments in Rock-n-Roll. It was really good. I was really, really happy with the top 5. Kurt Cobain's suicide was number 4 and John Lennon's assassination was number 1. I was completely touched when they started playing imagine. I know it was before my time but John Lennon was one of the greatest musicians ever. I think Kurt Cobain and John Lennon would be the two people that I would have made my life to meet or even just seen in concert. Well that was the highlight of my day. Hah watching a tv show. I'm actually looking forward to school!

      Okay so my dad had gone to get Chinese food tonight and he came back with some groceries too. After we had eaten my mom and I cleaned the kitchen and I put up the groceries. As I was putting up said groceries I came upon something I DID NOT WANT TO KNOW MY DAD WAS BUYING OR MY PARENTS ARE USING!!!! I found none other than a bottle of K Y warming liquid. You know that warming lubricant you use during....SEX!!! Please I don't want to know what my parents use for sex! I'm scarred for life! I mean I don't even want to think about my parents having sex at all! Gah! I think I'm going to go throw up now!

      okay, so I'm grounded right? Until I get my french and math summer work done. The only problem is I don't understand a thing of the french so I was going to call a friend, but she's out of town, and the math I only lack for problems. Seriously is it my fault if I don't remember what it means to solve but substitution or linear combination. Okay, okay doesn't sound horrible but I don't remember how you do it and yeah maybe I'll call someone in a higher grade than me, maybe they'll remember algebra I, muh I dunno I hate math. Erg I dunno, apparently I'm not aloud to go anywhere until everythings done but now my dad wants to go to the movies. Isn't that going against what they already said? Huh? Huh? I mean I love my dad, but a) I don't feel like going anywhere right now and b) there aren't any good movies right now that I'd want to see with my dad.   Note to self things I have left to do: four math problems geogia o'keafe poem french questions when I am me poem  choice book web illustrations for poems putting everything together and getting it ready but please I still have like 12 or 13 days to do it until its due! Gah!   That does seem like a lot but believe me that's like all the little things, I had so much more! We had so much summer homework this year!   Well yeah ok maybe I should do a poem or something now, okay? Later

      Yeah that's all I do! Nothing! I have about two weeks until highschool starts and I'm not too sure how I feel about that. Alright, alright starting highschool isn't that bad but a) I don't want to go back to school and b) well there isn't a b but mostly I don't like this idea of growing up. I dunno I want to go back to school to see my friends and all and I want something to do during the day but seriously who wants to go back to a richy rich, all girl's school with their own fucking bottled water? NOT ME that's for sure!  The all girls thing isn't as bad as you'd think, you get used to it, but it gets annoying. I mean the only thing I have that's anywhere close to a guy friend is my boyfriend. That's great and all, but I miss my guy friend's from my old school. Gah I'm just ranting now because I have absolutely nothing to do. I've done nothing for going on three weeks and I've been doing that on an off all summer. It's really starting to get annoying. I'm like completely bored! Erg well I dunno maybe I'll call someone or clean my room(yeah right) I mean my boyfriend's messing with his blog apparently, or he's playing video games or something. And Ira, if you see this sorry I LOVE YOU!!!!

      Yes after almost four years of growing out my hair, I've changed it! I started with it being a boy cut and until 2:30 today it was to my boobs. It was getting pretty long. Now it's about at my chin, maybe an inch below with bangs and the whole shebang(or however you spell it)! I love it and I really hope everyone else does too! I mean most of my friends have this weird obsession with my hair so I guess we'll find out on Monday! ^^
