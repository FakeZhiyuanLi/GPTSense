      Tonight, I discovered something that I was surprised I hadn't discovered before. Well, to get on the net... I use my sister's pphone line from my computer, and take it all the way into here room to hook it up there. Now, she gets mad if I try and go on during the morning, so, she unplugs it... and I can't get in there while she and her husband ae asleep. But... I remembered something. Back before my parents and I moved into her house, I used to come over every two weeks to do chores and get my allowance. I remember one time her husband was installing a phone jack into the wall after the computer was in here. The phone was also in this room. Fortunately, this room with the jack became my room. :D  I had always looked at it, but for some reason... I never thought of unscrewing it. I have no idea why. But, yesterday I finally decided to do so. The screws were loose... so, I used my hands. After getting it unscrewed I saw the jack and looked at it... I saw the shape of where a jack could go in... looked inside and saw the metal piece above. I thought to myself I was gonna use this the next day...  After sleeping and waking up this whole day, one time my sister took the cord out of her room and put it back in mine rolled up. Now... if you can see ho I typed this up, you probably guessed the jack worked. :)   Looks like I'll be on during the night a lot.

      Just recently I decided to stop hiding from everything and reveal my true self... and say why I really didn't like PureZC anymore. I requested a demotion and got rid of all the things I had there at the site. I just don't really like some of the rules, and many of the members have many issues by my book.  And, I even stopped releasing quests and such to the public now. I don't see a need to give entertainment to those who angered me, and the people who didn't... well, they can blame the ones who really got me pissed.  Everything that has a beginning has an end as they say...  I now reside at Gaming and Quest Making Resources (GQMR), owned by Snort and Codelinker. The site looks great and has a large amount of potential. It even has things in it other forums don't have! I just recently became a Site Staff, and I'll be sure to do whatever I can to make the site better. :)   And as a side note... my throat is doing well! I do have some nasty pain from tiem to time, but the ice pack along with my medicine and some cold water really helps. I might recover quite soon, and when I do... *Uses ninja Turtles voice* PIZZA TIME!

      Today... was the day where I would see my doctor again. My parents and I were to pick up a few papers, which gave instructions on how to treat me during my state of pain after my surgery.   As for the surgery... I'll be gettign my tonsils removed. This is a great thing to me. No more bad breath, no more gagging, no more pus, and I'll even be able to swallow food easier. Awesome.  It was a long drive down there, as the main building is about and hour away from where we live. There were two accidents today which caused us to be late... and to make it worse, the police had some sort of a detour set which wasted more time, unfortunately. After gettign there, there was a bit of waiting, but I finally met my doctor again and he went over how I should treat myself, and when to stop eating and drinking... which will be midnight.   On the way home, we stopped by "EZ Take Out Burger" (And surprisingly, EZ isn't shorthand for "easy" in their title. Or so, that's what my mom and sister tell me. Bah.) Quite nice hamburgers and fries... helped that annoying hunger pain in my stomach.   Well, tomorrow is the day of the surgery at 8:30 AM. Even though it's Firday the 13th, those days are like any other day, and there is no way I can die from the anesthesia despite the fact I'm very healthy. I've just never had surgery before, so this is making me feel a bit uneasy. :\   Well, I see no need to be superstitious about tomorrow, since these days always go well for me. Well, wish me luck!

      Wow, was I sleepy today. After creating the blog entry last night, I stayed awake all the way until somewhere around 11 AM. At this time... right when I was about to go to sleep, my sister asks me if I can watch her children for about half an hour. Now, the reward for doing this was a stick of Starburst, but I wasn't sure what to do at this point. Sleep, or... get candy, then sleep. Well, I managed to stay awake, but I kept dozing off every few minutes. Both of them were no trouble at all, and after I was rewared... I went to sleep immediately.  Later on after waking up, I did my chores and then made myself dinner. Macaroni and cheese, a favorite. From this point on... I went to work on MXL again. Surprisingly, I finished beta 3! I recently uploaded the beta and announced it to my testers, now... to send them word via a mail so they know of its existence.

      Yesterday, was quite odd. While I seemed to have gotten enough sleep, I somehow became tired and fell asleep after my mom left the house do do several things. When I wake up at about two hours later at somewhere around 3 PM, I find JitB (Jack in the Box) right next to me. That, being my favorite fast food place to eat made me happy. And guess what? JitB has fresh cut fries now! Cooked with teh skins, and they taste just as great as the old. :D  For the rest of the day, I was working on MXL trying to decide what the next area was like. While doing so, I was sidetracked somehow, so, I started to draw my own Samus. I got the helmet, pads, and chest plate down, and I may finish it someday. The design would go well with my current picture ->  After drinking almost half a liter of Squirt, and eating a Klondike bar, I finally decided how the next area should look like. Once I got the main parts done, and the area where the Gravity Suit would be needed, I went to do "personal" things.  After this, I decided to go on the net. Using my L337 sneaking skills, I quietly snuck into my sister's room and plugged in the internet line. Afterwards, I started typing this entry.   Well, yesterday had its ups and downs, and today might also be the same.

      I was working on a quest of mine, Metroid: XL-75 Remake (MXL) and I got a lot done today. I finished a whole new area, one that contains quite a few items and a decent custom boss. It'll be only one more area to go before I release beta 3. Now... to decide what tiles to use...

      Yes, it's been a few hours since I created this, but I felt the need to create another entry because of the recent events that just occured.  First of all, IRC went down at least 2-4 times back to back. It seemed pretty odd, but I believe an IRCop was doing something that needed to be done.  So far, the day has started off quite stupidly. I have to deal with my nieces as my parents sleep. The youngest one keeps sneaking out of the room and trying to do various things. I have to keep putitng her back in there and closing the door. I've told her many times, but it doesn't seem to get through her 2-year old idiot head (I do not care for age, this child can not seem to listen to anybody). I hope my dad wakes up and yells at the top of his lungs at them. That'll be awesome... well, just the youngest one. The older one is behaving, thankfully.   EDIT: I am no longer watching after that small crybaby of a niece, and the older behaving one. The little one constantly disobeyed me, and kept opening the door when my mom strictly told them that it was to be shut. So, being as angry as I was and seeing as how I had to keep going back and forth to close the door, I thought of something else that would prevent this. A special plastic doorknob attachment. You have to press both of the buttons in to grib the knob to open it. Great invention, I must say. :D Toddlers don't know how to use it. So, I attach it, and then close the door and she screams her ass off. Of course, I was too angry to even care for how she was. She disobeyed me, she called her older sister names, begs for crap, and then she expects me to keep the door open. My mom woke up and let them out.  My decision is final. I'm not having offspring. Fuck it.

      I've decided to create another blog, as I didn't seem to use my other one. Hopefully, I will post in this often and make it a habit of doing so... this way, I can bore all who read this.   BTW, for those that notice the MZM picture of Samus as my avatar/pciture, I can just say I am a hardcore Metroid fan. That suit is of my own colors, nothing more.
