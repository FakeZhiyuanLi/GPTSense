         A long time ago, somewhere in Europe, There is a big town called, Luxtenberg, it is where the King lives, it is the heart of most activities and the place where important people and the wise goes to. Gwerlexine is the second biggest city. It existed a day walking to the East of Luxtenberg, pass the Green temple, and another day through the Brivisile, little village that famous for the grape wine.      Ethan used to live in the Louisene village, in the south of Gwerlexine, before the village was flattened to the ground of the earth, by the Saverest's soldiers. The Louisene was a place where some wizards and witches used as a meeting point, because of some mystical athmosphere in the area. Ethan is an orphane now. He was eight when he left home. His parents where accused as wizards, and so they were assasinated. Ethan was saved, by a man. Somehow, this man, has mysterious and wild look in his eyes. He has the eyes that challange others. He is tall and average in size. This man grabbed Ethan into his black cloak. He was hooded, may be that's why no one saw them, that was what Ethan thought. He didn't say a word. His hand covered Ethans mouth, so that he won't scream. When the Louisene was burnt, he grabbed Ethan's father's necklace and put it around Ethan's neck, gave him a little smile and left whithin the shadow in the forest. Ethan was confused. He saw something flew over the air, towards him. It was a scrap of paper with notes.. it says :      East is where you suppose to go river will guide you so do the truth faithful and loyality are the keys find the door of wise and wisdom      Ethan stood for a while, and he decided to go to the Owlhom river. It's the river where he used to go to. Ethan is bright and full of curiousity, and adventurous spirit. He walks into the forest without fear, but curiousity. He found the Owlhom river. He looks down into the water. There is only his reflection. He looks in once again, and surprised because he saw another face looks back at him. That face is as clear as the river, with blue and silvery scales, whole black eyes and fish like face.      "Dear boy, are you Ethan?" Ethan is a little hesitate to answer,".. Yes i am.. sir.." "I've been told to guide you to the east city, Gwerlexine. now, my name is Edourise. Ethan, would be be kind enough to show me your necklace?" So Ethan shows him the necklace. It took the shape of an small blade, with a gemstone. It was half blue and half orange, blended in between.
