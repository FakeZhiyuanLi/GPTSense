       Instead of having the bagel.tech War over WinAmp and jetAudio today, I'm going to share my thoughts about Spiderman 2: The Game.  I picked it up for my Xbox today, and the game is so much fun, that I don't think I've had this kind of experience in a game.  This game really is that good.  Of course, you play the calm, quiet Peter Parker...wait, calm?  Quiet?  Eh...I think I misjudged.  Peter is always out and about, skipping classes, ditching his friends, for one main purpose.  And that is to save New York City from villains, crooks, and bad guys.  The game is broken up into several "chapters," in which you must complete.  In each chapter are goals that you must accomplish to complete the chapter.  The goals may be challenging at some time (like the Rhino boss...he took me 4 tries or so to get him finished), but, let me tell you, it's all worth it.  This has to be the best Xbox game I have played in such a long time.  It's perfect for anyone who has ever seen either the first or second movies.    The graphics in the game are beautiful.  Activision decided to make this one with open ended game play, so that you can sling all around New York City.  And, New York City, by the way, has been very well recreated, with the Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building, and even two beams of light at Ground Zero.  It looks so much like the real city, that you won't know you're playing a videogame.  Its that much fun.  Slinging around has never been better.  You can select either Easy Slinging or Normal Slinging.  Normal is the better option to go with if you want the full experience of the game.  You can sling from building to building, rooftop to rooftop, and have as much fun as you want.  It sure beats traveling on foot, right?    So anyway, I've only come across the first boss at this point, but, as I continue to play it, I'm going to come across much more, and I know they are going to be very tough.  Stick around, because this Saturday, I'll be giving a full review. ------------------ Daily Wrap Up- June 30, 2004  Well, that's it for today's installments of bagel.tech.  I deviated from the original plan quite a bit, but, it was definitely worth it.  Here's what happened today:  In games I looked at Collapse.  This game is addicting, and it may give you Clickeritis, but, it's one of the most fun games I have played.  I gave Collapse an 87.5 (on the new scale).  For today's download, we looked at WinAmp 5.1.  This media player is nice, and it's got some sweet features, like being able to download skins that make the original look like a load of crap.  I gave WinAmp an 87.5.  And, today's site of the day, also earned an 87.5, and that is a site known as IGN.  User interaction is what makes this site great, you can post your game collection, wishlist, and all sorts of stuff.  Again, it got an 87.5.  So, we didn't look at the best of things today, but, it was still a good day.  Here's what to expect tomorrow...and remember, it can change:  GAME: What Word? DOWNLOAD: Avant Browser SITE: TBA FEATURE: bagel.tech WAR: WinAmp vs. jetAudio  Remember, the new rating scale begins tomorrow, and the monthly review archive is going to be deleted and started fresh for the new month.  That's it for today's installments.  Remember to check out Blog of Bagel tonight, where I'll be beginning the countdown for my favorite Family Guy episodes, and another update which will have me rambling about my new favorite game.  Until then, leave me alone!  I'm playing Spiderman 2!

        The Lowdown:  Well, I said I was going to post 1up.com as today's site, but their new design isn't working all that great, so I'm going to pass on that until they make it work a little better.  So, today's site of the day is IGN, one of the biggest freakin' media sites on the internet today.  IGN stands for Imagine Games Network, but, they're not games anymore...they're games, movies, TV, music, and pretty much everything that the media has to offer today.  It offers a lot of user interaction, including the feature where you can post your game collection, and all sorts of stuff.  It's awesome, but, IGN may have its problems.  IGN has some of the best reviews for games.  Everytime someone reviews a videogame, and people don't agree with the review, they go to IGN to get the real scoop.  They have talented editors who take time and effort into producing quality news, reviews, and more.  The site design looks nice, and the whole thing looks professional, and that is what I like most about it.  If you want to take advantages of features like creating your own game collection, you have to sign up.  It's easy, its free (if you want a basic membership, that is), and it's worth it.  You can post your whole game collection, give them little reviews, and create a wishlist for games that you're looking forward to.  They also tell you how much your collection is worth.  You can write up reader reviews, and do all sorts of stuff.  It's really unique, and it's so easy to do.  IGN is one of the best gaming sites, hands down.  Check back for tomorrow's site of the day, because we're going to check out another, called GameSpot.      Pros  +Create a game collection, wishlist, and reader reviews +Covers more than just games, including movies, music, etc. +Owns a lot of big sites, like GameFAQs, Rotten Tomatoes, and GameSpy.   Cons  -People on the message boards are stupid.    Score  Fun Factor: 4/5 (80%) Graphics/Layout: 5/5 (100%) Speed: 3.5/5 (70%) Customization/Controls: 5/5 (100%) Final: 4.5/5 (87.5 exact)  Up Next...jetAudio vs. WinAmp in the first ever bagel.tech War!  Also, today's daily wrap up.

        The Lowdown:  WinAmp is back, and it comes with an all new look for those people who were getting tired of the classic skin.  However, the new skin still isn't the best it can be, and WinAmp is continuing the tradition of allowing you to skin your WinAmp player, and, boy, do some of these skins look good.  But, we'll get to that later.  Let's talk about the real features of WinAmp.  WinAmp is a music player for those people who don't like Windows Media.  It's both a music player and a video player, so you can have fun both ways.  The quality that comes with WinAmp far surpasses any media player I have ever used before (even more than jetAudio, which received a high recommendation from me last week), and it is definitely worth the download.   Several million users use WinAmp, due to its flexibility and customization.  You can change all sorts of stuff with the equalizer, and customize your skins, and everything.  It really makes a nice addition to an already powerful media player.  It's been around for many years now, and WinAmp keeps getting better.  The newest version, 5.1, is a masterpiece for anyone who listens to music.  You're going to get crystal clear quality with every song you listen to, and it supports many different formats.    urlLink    Winamp allows you to customize the look and feel by offering several downloadable skins on Winamp.com.&nbsp; urlLink     That picture up there is an example of how well customization goes, as far as the overall look of your player.  I downloaded that skin, which is called Resurgance, from the WinAmp website.  Yes, they really do have skins that are that good.  They far surpass the quality of the skins that you see on jetAudio or any other media player, and they work better too.  Every single one is flashy, and I don't think I've used one yet that I haven't liked, in the several years that I have had WinAmp on my computer.  If you feel like Broadcasting your own radio show, get on ShoutCast and set up your radio station, and give people the URL to your show.  You can broadcast right from WinAmp, and you can listen to it from WinAmp as well.  It's a nice little feature, but, I do think I like jetAudio's jetCast better than Shoutcast.  To me, it just seems like it works better.  If you're looking for a good media player, but, were not impressed with jetAudio, this is the one for you.  Later on today, bagel.tech's first ever war will go on, with jetAudio and WinAmp, to find out which is the better one.  So, be sure to check it out later, to see which one I truly think is better (and scores don't mean a thing).   Pros  +Customization is awesome, many different skins to choose from. +Crystal Clear Quality +Many formats supported   Cons  -Broadcasting is better on jetCast from jetAudio -Default skin is good, but, resembles jetAudio in a way   Score  Fun Factor: 4.5/5 (90%) Graphics/Layout: 5/5 (100%) Speed: 4.5 (95%) Customization/Controls: 4.5/5 (100%) Final: 4.5/5 (95%, exact)  Next Up: Site of the Day- www.1up.com

        The Lowdown:  GameHouse, who also created the highly popular and earlier-reviewed Text Twist, has another great game which came out a couple years ago, called Collapse.  This game will make you develop Clickeritis, especially in the later levels, because you have to obsessively click to clear the board.  In Collapse, your job is simple, and that is to find matches of three or more, click on them, and eliminate them.  Sometimes, you'll get bombs, which help you clear the board a little bit easier.  The standard bomb will eliminate all blocks within a certain radius.  Color coded bombs get rid of all of the blocks of that color.  They are helpful, yes, but, does that really matter?  Of course it does.  This game is one of the most addicting games I have ever played.  And that could be taken as both a positive thing, and a negative thing.  You click, and click, and click, and click, so much, that it's hard not to develop some kind of arthritis or something.  And you just want to keep on clicking, even after you've finished playing the game.  But, the game is fun.  Lots of it.  It's a single player game, but, you can take turns with friends every other round if you want to, to avoid the pain of clicking too much.  But, will you want to share with your friends?  No, because the clicking in this game is so freakin' addicting.     urlLink    Ah, Collapse. Game of much clicking. Easy to use interface, great sound, and lots of fun.&nbsp; urlLink     Collapse's interface is nice and simple, so it loads quickly on your computer.  Sounds and stuff are what makes this game pretty interesting, because the siren that goes off when you only have a few lines left is so annoying, that it makes you want to keep on clicking.  Now, I'm not sure whether or not they intended it to do that, but, oh well.  It did it anyway.  Overall, I would think that Collapse is one of the more addicting games out there, but, how does it compare to Zuma?  Well, that will be found out during bagel.tech Wars sometime next week.  But, for now, here's your detailed review for Collapse.   Pros  +Addicting +Fun to play +Great Sound   Cons  -No Pause button -You click so much that clickeritis is developed.   Score  Fun Factor: 5/5 (100% on New Scale, starting tomorrow) Graphics/Layout: 4/5 (80%) Speed: 3.5/5 (70%) Customization/Controls: 5/5 (100%) Final: 4.5 out of 5 (exact would be 87.5 in this case)

       Today, in place of a tip, I'm going to post the official rules for the upcoming bagel.tech Gmail Giveaway (Mainly because I didn't have anything planned for today.  Tips are now going to be twice a week, Monday and Friday).  Here are the official rules for the upcoming contest:  1. Contest begins on an unknown date.  Stick with bagel.tech to find out more. 2. When the contest begins, you will have to do some searching through the site (including Blog of Bagel), to find the secret codes hidden in comments.  They can be anywhere...in the archives, even.  3. There are 4 codes posted every day. 4. You may enter twice a day. 5. Once you win, you cannot win again. 6. Contest will last three days, and one invite will be won each day. 7. Interacting with the site may increase your chances of winning*.  Each time you interact, you get 1/2 of an entry.  Interact twice to get an entry. 8. To submit an entry, you have to email the Gmail account that I provide, with the code, the place you found it, and the following information: Name: City/State: Age: Blog Address: That way, if you win, I can post a little bit of information about that day's winner.    Remember, interactivity with the site increases your chances of winning.  You'll get an entry per day for every time you interact with the site twice.  Be sure you check out bagel.tech every day, so that you know when its going to start.  Its going to come unexpected, so you have to check back to find out.  *-Every time you interact, it must not be spam!  It must be an intelligent comment to a post, including questions, compliments, etc.  All interactivity must be done before the contest begins.  ------------------------------ June 29, 2004- Wrap Up  What's that?  No 5 out of 5's?  That's because the really really good stuff has already been reviewed.  Sure, you'll see it occasionally, but don't expect to see it too often.  You may have noticed that come Thursday, we'll be starting the official ratings system.  The official bagel.tech is going to launch on July 1st with all new features, possibly even a new template, if I can find one that's good enough for the job.  But, don't be surprised if you don't see one.  The new rating system will be more accurate, and the reviews, as well, will be more in-depth.  Plus, we're going to eliminate the tips to twice a week, and add in some new features to fill in for it during the rest of the week.   Today, in games, we looked at Trivial Pursuit on Uproar.  This game is nice, it's a little difficult.  It has five modes of play, including the super hard "Genius" mode.  Answer six questions correctly and collect the pieces of the circle, and then go on to the "Winning Question."  Your final score is converted to iCoins, where you'll be able to buy prizes on Uproar.  Trivial Pursuit got a  3.5 out of 5,  which in the new rating system, will convert to a 70%.  Today's download of the day was Mozilla's Thunderbird.  This is Mozilla's answer to Microsoft Outlook, and is much faster, as well.  You can use your Hotmail and Yahoo email accounts with it, but you'll need a program like Hotmail Popper or YahooPops in order to do that.  Mozilla Thunderbird received a  4 out of 5,  which converts to an 80% in the new rating system, and receives a silver award.  Today's site of the day was GameRankings.com.  This site is perfect for a gamer who is looking for a good game to buy.  It archives all of the reviews that are written by various media outlets, and combines all the scores together to make a Game Ranking.  GameRankings.com also allows you to view screenshots of the game you're looking at, and there is plenty of user interactivity.  GameRankings received a  4 out of 5,  the equivilent of an 80% on the new scale.    Today's feature was the bagel.tech Gmail Giveaway Rules Update.  This new contest from me will allow you to win Gmail invites by interacting with the site.  This contest will begin at an unknown date, so you have to check back to see when it's going to start.  Three days, three winners, and another contest after that sometime.    Thats it for today's bagel.tech updates.  Tomorrow is the last day of June, and here's what we've got lined up:  Game: Collapse Download: WinAmp 5.1 Site: Uproar.com Feature: bagel.tech Wars #1: WinAmp vs. jetAudio  Remember to check tonight's Blog of Bagel updates, and see you tomorrow for another day of bagel.tech.

       Today’s site of the day is mainly for gamers who are looking for a good game to buy, and its called GameRankings.  GameRankings, which is owned by GameSpot, is the site to go to if you’re looking for specific information on a game, including archives of what media outlets have reviewed it.  You can also check out screenshots of the games that you are interested.     urlLink    The main page for GameRankings shows games that are most popular, and the recent top games.&nbsp; urlLink     If you want to leave your input on games, you have to sign up.  Signing up for the site takes only a second, and you don’t have to do too much to do it.  Just fill out one little form, and you’re all set to go.  You can rate the games that you have bought, which will show up on the “Reader Reviews” section, which can be found at the bottom right of every game’s page.  You can get in-depth with the results.  It will tell you how it ranks on a specific console (for example, The Chronicles of Riddick is the 12th best game on the Xbox, according to various retailers who reviewed the game, and had their reviews archived on GameRankings).  It will tell you how it ranks in the history of games.  (For example, Halo might be #12 or something like that).    The cool thing about GameRankings is that there is so much user interaction.  Everyone who votes on a game, they will have their vote displayed in the “User Voting” column, which is where the Reader Reviews column is.  In big, bold letters, it will show the Users Rating for the game.  (Right now, Spiderman 2 is a 7.4.  Shocker.  The media outlets that reviewed it are giving it As, 95s, and 87s, or something like that).  The user interaction is also helpful when determining what games are better.  You can browse through the library of games for each console by clicking on that console’s icon.  The recent games list tells you what has just recently come out, and how it is faring in the media compared to other games.    Like I mentioned earlier, you can look at screenshots of the game.  This is helpful, so that you can see what game you are going to buy, before you buy it and say it looks a lot like crap.     urlLink    You can check out screenshots of the games you're looking for. Ah...good ol' Spidey.&nbsp; urlLink     Overall, GameRankings is a fast site, and it’s a good one, too.  It’s a helpful tool for finding out more information on a game, and getting different sites’ opinions on it.  However, there are tons of members of the message board that will flame a good game just to bring its score down.  I give GameRankings.com an impervious  4 out of 5.

        urlLink    Mozilla Thunderbird is Mozilla's answer to Outlook.  It's both faster, more powerful, and better looking than Outlook!&nbsp; urlLink     If you're looking for a fast email program, that's completely customizable, and has a nice interface, look no further.  Mozilla recently released Mozilla Thunderbird, which is their equivalent to Microsoft Outlook.  And guess what.  It, like Firefox, is better than a Microsoft program.  It's faster, it's got everything you need, and it makes checking email and newsgroups even easier than ever before.    To run Mozilla Thunderbird, you have to have a POP3 email account.  You can find millions of these kinds of email accounts online for free, or, if you run a website of any kind, they're easy to get, as well.  They normally come with your web server.  But, anyway, you can also run Hotmail, Gmail, and Yahoo Mail on them, but you'll have to download special programs in order to do this.    The main thing that sets Mozilla Thunderbird apart from Microsoft Outlook is the fact that it is so much faster, and has a much better interface.  Everything that Mozilla puts out is based on the Netscape technology, which is faster than Microsoft's Explorer Technology.  So, you get blazing speeds, even if you're on a slower connection, and its free.  As long as you have a POP3 or IMAP account, you can run this program without problems.  Mozilla Thunderbird is the ultimate companion to Mozilla Firefox, and, if you're on a slow connection, then you definitely need to download these two programs and let them show you how the internet is really supposed to work.  Now if we could only get them to let out their own email service...then it would be perfect.  I give Mozilla Thunderbird, the next generation email program, a stunning  4 out of 5.

       Alright, let's get things going a little early today, because I'm going to be getting Spiderman 2: The Game today, so I want to get this done ASAP.  Today's game of the day is Trivial Pursuit on Uproar.  While this one isn't a multiplayer game like Family Feud, it's still a very fun game to play, and very challenging to boot.    While it may not have the looks of Family Feud or other games that I've reviewed so far, Trivial Pursuit still does have a nice interface which is easy to use.  The real winner here is the sound in it.  The sound has never sounded better in any online game that I've ever played.  The music stands out from the rest of the web games, in my opinion.   urlLink    Trivial Pursuit has a nice interface, but too many ads.&nbsp; urlLink     In Trivial Pursuit, the first thing you have to do is pick which game you want to play.  The 5 different modes include "Genius," "Silver Screen," "Music," "TV," and "1980s."  Genius mode is obviously everything put together into one big super game.  Your goal in Trivial Pursuit is to get one of those little triangle piece things for all 6 categories, depending on which game you chose before you started playing.  For instance, I played the TV version, and had categories like "Daytime," "Children's TV," "Drama," and more.  Once you collect all six pieces, you'll move on to the Winning Question.  Answer it correctly, and you'll win the game with a high score.  That score is then converted to iCoins, and you can use those in Uproar's auctions.  Sound cool?  Yeah, it really is.  Now, in regular Trivial Pursuit, the board game, you have to move around a board, if I'm not mistaken.  Well, this online game eliminates that.  You no longer move around a board, and you just answer questions.  In my opinion, if they would have made it a multiplayer game, and also put the board in there, this game would be much better.   urlLink    Finish the game with a high score, unlike me, to get extra iCoins!&nbsp; urlLink     Trivial Pursuit isn't the best game out there, but its an incredibly fun game to play when you get bored.  I give Trivial Pursuit, on Uproar.com, a fair  3.5 out of 5.

       Like I said in today's Download of the Day post, you can have Mozilla Firefox start up, and automatically load your favorite web pages for you.  Well, today's tip is exactly how you can do that, and it's actually quite simple.  This is the easiest tip of the day that I've had to write so far, so, hopefully it'll sound a little better than Saturdays, which confused me even.  1. Open Mozilla Firefox from your desktop, quick launch, or whatever. 2. Go go Tools>Options. 3. Under the general tab, you'll see a text box named "Location(s)." 4. Type the URL of the first tab you want to open automatically. 5. Put a | right after it, with no spaces.  (To do that character, hold SHIFT and press the \ button, which is right above the enter button) 6. Now, type the second URL for the second tab, and then do the | again. 7. Keep doing that until you have all the tabs set.  8. Hit Okay, and then close Mozilla Firefox. 9. Reopen it, and you'll see that all the URLS that you typed in are now showing up as different tabs, already loaded for you.   urlLink    After each URL that you type, make a | symbol and type the next one.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    And, the end result...these tabs opened automatically when I opened Firefox.&nbsp; urlLink    ---------------------------- June 28, 2004: Wrap Up  I hope you guys are just as surprised as I am.  2 hours ago, I would have never thought that I would be getting ready to start my first contest, and, now, I'm already planning the full details of it.  Today, I announced the "bagel.tech Gmail Giveaway," which you can find out more about in today's Site of the Day, or at the top of the sidebar.  However, I will be mixing it up to make it a little harder, so that you guys read more of the posts on the site.  That will start whenever I get invites.  So, just chill, and check occasionally, and it will eventually come.  Other than that, I thought that everything I reviewed was good, except for that MyAlbum crap, but, you won't want that anyway.    Today, in games, I looked at Family Feud on Uproar.  It's a great game to play with friends during school, and, even if you're by yourself, its still pretty fun.  Family Feud got a shockingly good  4.5 out of 5.   For today's download of the day, we looked at MyAlbum, and also Mozilla Firefox, since I gave out my first crap score.  MyAlbum has lots of customization features, but, that's not enough to make it difficult to use, and not to mention, the pictures look bad when you view your slideshow.  MyAlbum got a  2 out of 5.   Mozilla Firefox, on the other hand, is Mozilla's next generation browser.  It also has lots of customization features, and these are easy to use.  It's a tabbed browser, so you won't have to have so many windows open at the same time when online.  You can skin it, it's got a fast download system, and its the perfect browser.  Mozilla Firefox 0.9 received an elite  5 out of 5.   Today's site of the day was Gmail, from Google.  This new email service is fast, offers 1 GB of space, and is from the same people that brought you Froogle and other odd tools.  1 GB allows for bigger attachments, archiving, and more.  It's definitely the best free email service out there, and it is worth the elusive  6 out of 5.   And finally, today's tip, shown above, is for Mozilla Firefox.  We looked at how you can set your homepage to load your favorite web pages.  It was simple, where you would go into options, and in the locations text box, type the URL of each tab you want to open, following each one with a | symbol.  That's it for today's bagel.tech updates.  Tomorrow, I'm going to take a look at another Mozilla product, Mozilla Thunderbird, which is the perfect replacement for Microsoft Outlook.  I'll also take a look at another game on Uproar, and feature GameRankings as the site of the day.  Be sure to check out Blog of Bagel tonight for 2 updates, and I'll see you back here tomorrow for another fun-filled day of bagel.tech.  Also, I'm picking up Spiderman 2: The Game tomorrow, so don't mind me if my updates are rushed.

       Well, I had plans to have GameRankings for today's site of the day, but, I got an email about an hour ago for an invite to the Gmail beta...at long last.  Coming in about a week or two, you will be able to enter the "bagel.tech Gmail Invite Giveaway."  I'm going to be getting some invites in a couple weeks for my Gmail account, and I'm keeping one for myself (I'm using the account I have now temporarily), and I should have like 3 to give out.  Get ready for it, and be sure to keep checking out bagel.tech, because it could happen at any time.  But, on to today's site of the day.  So I got the email, I went and signed up, and I was already impressed.  I tried sending a test email, and within seconds, it was already gone.  Wow.  The main thing that's great about Gmail is that you get 1 gigabyte of space.  That's about 10x more than Yahoo, and about 4x as more as the new Hotmail, which is launching in a few months.  Gmail has a nice interface, and it's fun to work with.  The only gripe about Gmail that I can find is the fact that they scan through your emails and give you text-based ads.  Not so cool.  But, once you get past the fact that they will never give out any information you send in an email, you'll realize that it isn't bad.  They're giving you a gigabyte of space, so the least you could do is let them put a couple ads.    Gmail has a nice interface, like I said above.  It's different from most email programs, in the sense that you can view things in conversation view, it's a clean interface, and, let's not forget, this thing is fast.  It reminds me of an early version of Hotmail or something.  It could be better, but, it's still nice the way it is.    Gmail is FAST.  It takes like 1/2 a second to send an email.  It's awesome that way.  You can go in, type the name of the contact (or select it from your contact list), type your email, hit send, and even on the slowest connections, it should go away quickly.  It's really nice.   urlLink    Gmail has a conversation view mode, so you can view all the messages in a chain of emails at the same time.&nbsp; urlLink     Even though its still in beta, and changes are likely to come to it, Gmail is one of the most powerful free email tools on this planet, and, if you happen to get an invite, be sure to take advantage of it.  With 1 whole gigabyte of space, you can't go wrong.  Gmail gets the rare score of  6 out of 5.   Remember to keep checking back, because as soon as the contest starts, there's only going to be like 3 invites available.  Look for the "bagel.tech GMAIL INVITE GIVEAWAY: GOING ON NOW!" At the top of the page, where the profile bar is.  When you see that, Gmail me at the address given to enter to win.  The contest will last three days, or one day for every invite that I get.  After you email me, I'll put all the entries together, and pick one out every day.  Whoever wins, gets it.  So, look out for it, because its coming at a time when I don't know of yet!

       Today, we're going to have two downloads, since one is craptacular, and one is really good.  Let's start with MyAlbum:  MyAlbum:  If you’re looking for a tool to help you create a digital photo album, then, you might want to keep looking, because today’s download of the day is not very good.  It’s called MyAlbum, and even though it sounds like a good idea, it’s not, because this program isn’t very good.  At all.    Even though it’s got a small download size, clocking in at only 2.1 megabytes, it still is definitely not worth it.  There are some perks to this program, but, chances are, if you were to keep looking for an even better album creation tool, you’d find them in practically any one.  For one thing, you can create a slide show from the pictures you upload, and then put them to background music and add all sorts of effects.  Not just that, but, there are a ton of customization options for your album.  That’s all that is good about this.     urlLink    MyAlbum may look easy from the start, but...&nbsp; urlLink     On the negative side of this program, the customization options can and probably will confuse the hell out of some people, depending on how well you know computers.  The interface, also, is very ugly, and there are several different album creation programs that are more graphically pleasing than this one.  And, when you actually look at your slideshow, everything is too blurry and pixelated, and it looks better on even PowerPoint, from Windows.    Bottom line?  There are much better products than MyAlbum, but, some people with low memory space on their computer may find it interesting.  That’s why I’m going to give MyAlbum a disappointing, upsetting  2 out of 5.    urlLink    ...You'll start getting confused around here.&nbsp; urlLink    -------------------------------- Mozilla Firefox  Now, you saw me review Mozilla Firefox for the tip of the day on Thursday, but, now, you're getting the whole, full blown review.  And it deserves one, too, because this is one of the most powerful and fastest browsers in the world.  Mozilla uses the Netscape technology, and makes it faster.  It doesn't have the slow down that the Netscape Browser does, and it's very open ended.  You can customize practically everything, from the theme of the browser to the popups that can and can't be blocked.  It's not hard to change stuff, which makes the customization a lot better than MyAlbum, which I reviewed above.     urlLink    Mozilla Firefox looks nice, it's fast, and it is very open ended for those who have to change stuff, like the theme, for example. And its easy to use.&nbsp; urlLink     The cool thing about Mozilla Firefox, even though we're seeing it in most browsers these days, is the tabbing features.  You can set tabs to automatically open when you start Firefox (see today's tip later today), and all you have to do to switch tabs is just click.  Like the rest of Firefox, its completely easy to use.  The new version, 0.9, gives the tabs a brand new look, and they couldn't look any better.  Now, when you start using Firefox for a while, don't go back to IE, because you will see just how much slower it really is.  Firefox uses the Netscape technology, like I mentioned above, which allows for faster loading times.  If its text that you've gone to the site for, it will load the text, then start worrying about all the graphics and pictures and stuff.  It couldn't be any faster.  Overall, I'd say Firefox is definitely worth a good score. I only gave it a 4 or so when I reviewed it for the Tip of the Day last week, but, now, with the new version that I just downloaded, that score automatically jumps to a  5 out of 5.   Join me tomorrow for tomorrow's Download of the Day, which is Mozilla Thunderbird, Mozilla's answer to Microsoft Outlook.

       Another week, another new set of games to review.  And this week's first game is one of the most popular on the web, a little game called Family Feud.  In Family Feud, you hop into this giant pool of players and compete against them for the most points.  The game gives you a question, and you have to answer it with as many different possibilities as you can think of.  Each question was a survey, and if your answers compare to the answers of others, then you'll earn points.  If you get all three or four of the answer choices, you'll get the most points, and soar up on the leaderboard.  Then, after three rounds or regular play, you'll go into fast money mode, where there are 5 questions, and you have to guess the answer to each one, and get the same answer as the majority of people who did the survey, in order to score big points.  This game has been around for a while, now.  I've played it since I was a freshman 3 years ago, and it's just as addicting as ever.  I have no idea when they add new questions, but, every time I play the game, it seems incredibly fresh.  I think there was only once when I played the game and had the same questions.  This game is fun to play in school, with your friends around to help you guess the best answers.  Fast money, especially, is fun to play with friends because you have a time limit of like 30 seconds, and you have to guess each one correctly in order to get the most amount of points possible.   urlLink    Family Feud is an awesome multiplayer game, and gives you and your friends something to do when you're bored in class.&nbsp; urlLink     Family Feud is one of the most addicting games on Uproar, maybe the whole web.  It's better than Text Twist, but not as good as Zuma.  I give Family Feud, on Uproar, a stunning  4.5 out of 5.

       Today’s Tip of the Day is mainly for Blogger users, and it’s actually quite simple.  If you don’t want to have so many different posts for your photos, you can merge them all into one by simply cutting the HTML from the post, deleting the post, and merging them all together into one giant post.  An example of how this is done is seen in today’s “The Blog of the Bagel,” where I edited all the pictures of my New York Pictures post into one.  Here’s how you do it:  1- You’re going to need two internet explorer (or other browser) windows open, and ready to go.   2- First, upload all of your pictures using the BloggerBot on Hello. 3- Now, your first internet explorer window will pop up, showing you your blog and the picture you just posted. 4- In that window, go to your dashboard by going to www.blogger.com, and selecting the blog you want to edit (in my case, it was The Blog of the Bagel).   5- Now, go to the Posting tab in your settings, and select Edit Posts. 6- Click on the edit button next to the caption you typed in Hello, in your edit posts menu.  Now, here is where you can take 2 paths.  You can either keep the post with the picture in it, and add the rest of the pictures you want in that post to that, or, you can cut the HTML that contains the picture and insert it into a new post.  7- This is the part where you will need to open your second browser window.  Go to File, New, or whatever, and direct to Blogger.com, if it doesn’t automatically redirect when you open the window. 8- Now, start a new post.  Put in your title, and all that good stuff. 9- If you want to type an introduction to the post, do that first. 10- Now, paste your HTML into the new post. 11- Now, go back into Hello, upload your next picture, and do it again. 12- When you’re all done going into each photo’s post, copying the HTML, and posting it into the new post, post your new post, publish your blog, and then, click on the “Edit Posts” tag.  Now, delete all of the posts that your pictures were originally on.  Republish your blog again, and guess what?  You’re done.  It’s the easiest and cleanest way to manage pictures in your posts, in my opinion, and it’s a good way to organize your pictures. ------------------------ Daily Wrap-Up: June 26, 2004  Well, today, we gave some pretty high scores, and ended the week on a positive note, but don’t expect it to stay that way, because Monday’s download of the day could possibly make you sick!  But, let’s go ahead and do the wrap up.    In game reviews, I reviewed Text Twist on Yahoo Games.  On a positive side, the game is fun, has a nice interface, and is great to play with friends.  On the negative side, if you’re playing by yourself, it seems incredibly boring.  I gave Text Twist a  4 out of 5.   Today’s download of the day was Hello.  This helpful little tool provides the easiest way to upload pictures to your Blogger, as well as share them with your friends.  It’s just like a photo-based version of AOL Instant Messenger, with a nice interface and a great speed.  Hello got a  5 out of 5.   The site of the day was a place called www.shockwave.com.  This site features the best web games, a hilarious selection of online films through Atom Films, and is one of the best web sites that I have ever been to.  I gave Shockwave.com the rarest score you’ll ever see...a  6 out of 5.   And, finally, today’s tip was how you can move your photos on Blogger to one individual post, if you so desire.  This tip is for users of Blogger, with the help of Hello.    That’s all for today’s bagel.tech updates.  Remember, I don’t update this one on Sunday, so I’ll be back on Monday with more, including the first item to get a  0 out of 5.  Be sure to check out the links section, and the new “Review summary” portion of the sidebar so you can see what I recommend more than anything else.  It updates every Saturday, after the week is over, so be sure to check it out.  Thanks for checking out bagel.tech, and remember to check out The Blog of the Bagel later for tonight’s post.

        urlLink    Shockwave is one of the best sites out there for games, online videos, and more.  All you need is the free Shockwave Player, and you're ready to go.&nbsp; urlLink     I’ve gone to Shockwave for just about anything for several years now.  They’ve got the best games, the best downloads...practically, the best anything.  They have an assortment of crazy cartoons and games, and it’s a lot of fun.  One of the best features of Shockwave.com is the amount of games.  There are just so many, that it would take forever to play.  They have games based on big franchises, such as the new Shrek Bowling game, and also, the new Collapse Crunch.  The games are awesome, and they are what really set Shockwave.com apart from the rest of the internet scene.  Not to mention, the games look great with the required WildTangent driver.  They really are incredible, and anyone who likes webgames needs to check this one out.  They have a sub-site called “AtomFilms,” which has got some of the best web cartoons and other videos on it.  Some of the funniest include the Angry kid series, which has been one of my favorites since a few years back.  They’ve now started “Angry Kid Series 2,” which is highly hilarious, and definitely something you don’t want to miss out on.  So, with all the games and videos and things that Shockwave offers, it is one of the most entertaining sites around.  You have to download Shockwave in order to view it, but, let me tell you, its definitely worth it.  I give Shockwave.com an impossible, irresistable  6 out of 5.

       Today’s download of the day is a handy little tool to help you exchange pictures with your friends, and also upload them easily to your Blogger account.  Hello, which comes from “Picasa,” is a third party software the Blogger users can use to upload pictures to their blog, and then, if they wish, they can edit all of the posts together into one big post.  (See today’s tip for how to do that).  You can also exchange pictures with your friends, too, which comes in handy for showing people who you really are.  Now, there are other ways that you can upload pictures to your blog, but none of them are as good and fast as Hello.  Getting there is easy, all you have to do is sign in, click on BloggerBot, start a convo with it, and then start sending pictures.  Write in captions and stuff, and then click publish, and you’re all set to go.  It’s quite easy.  Hello has got a nice interface, and, its one of the fastest messaging services I have ever seen.  The screenshot below shows me sending pictures to Hello this morning for my “New York Pictures” post on The Blog of the Bagel:   urlLink    Hello is the most awesome picture sending client available, and, its the best way to send pictures to your blog on Blogger. &nbsp; urlLink     Quite easy, right?  That’s right.  Build a buddy list of people who you want to send pictures to.  There’s no limit to how many pictures you can upload, and it’s awesome to try.  So, get on Hello today, because from me, its worth a perfect score  5 out of 5.

        urlLink    Text Twist is one of the most addicting web games out there. &nbsp; urlLink     This game is so wildly popular, that you can’t help but love it.  It’s got a simple interface, it’s nice, and it’s a fun game to play, too.  If you haven’t played Text Twist before, then you might want to check it out, because it offers a unique experience that has set the standard for word-based web games.    Your job in Text Twist is to use the six letters that they give you, and find as many words as possible that can be spelled out with those letters.  You can’t advance to the next level if you don’t find at least one six letter word, some of which are too obvious, or some of which are so freakin’ difficult that you would have never guessed when it tells you.  But, the game is fun.  And when they finally tell you the words that you missed, you can’t help but laugh, because the words were so easy to figure out.  If you’re having a tough time finding the words, you can always hit the twist button to mix the letters up, and that can help.  Or, an alternative, if you’re at school, have people around to help you out.  It’s a fun game to play with friends.  But, if you don’t have friends, then, it’s still a fun game, but, not as fun.   urlLink    Sometimes the words you think are going to work, just don't work.&nbsp; urlLink     Text Twist is so much fun, but, it’s not as addicting as yesterday’s “Zuma.”  It’s definitely the best word-based game out there though.  It’s got a nice graphical interface, it’s easy to pick up and play, and it’s fun, too.  And that is why I give Text Twist a twisted score of   4 out of 5.

       Tired of using Internet Explorer and getting all the crappy popups?  Well, we all get tired of that, especially when you hit a website where the popups just keep coming.  Today's tip is for alternate browsers.  There are 4 in particular that I have tried out within the past couple of years, and now, here'a review of each one, all of which are alternates to Internet Explorer.   Mozilla Firefox 0.8:  Yeah, I know, Firefox 0.9 is already out, but I haven't downloaded that yet.  So, I'll give a quick review to Mozilla's Firefox 0.8.  This browser is FAST.  It runs on Netscape's technology, so it has absolutely nothing to do with Internet Explorer.  You can download extensions to maximize your browsing experience, and you can also download different skins.  It's a tabbed browser, so you no longer have to have several different windows open for all your internet activities.  It comes with a built in popup blocker, and it has blocked every single ad that even thinks about coming up, and you don't even have to see it.  Mozilla Firefox gets a  4.5 out of 5.    Avant Browser:  This one runs on Internet Explorer software, so its not as fast.  It is, however, a tabbed browser, that also comes with a popup blocker.  It's not as fast as Mozilla Firefox, but, it's still a pretty good browser anyway.  Avant Browser can be downloaded at www.avantbrowser.com for free, and it gets a mediocre  3 out of 5.    Opera:  This one doesn't run on Internet Explorer, similar to Mozilla, however, it's a very slow browser.  Opera claims that they have the fastest browser, however, I don't think it is.  Added features like tabbed windows can be found in better browsers, and this one doesn't even load all the images correctly.  Opera can be downloaded at www.opera.com.  Email and small other features don't make this one the best, but, it still is worthy of a  3 out of 5.    Netscape:  Even though the Netscape technology is much faster than Internet Explorer, it still works better with Mozilla.  This is the absolute worst browser.  It may come with a nice look, but, it's slow, it slows down and freezes a lot, and popups can easily sneak through.  When you download Netscape, you get Netscape Instant Messenger, which is simply a prettier version of AOL Instant Messenger, which is nice, and Netscape Mail, which is very slow, but doesn't require you to use a browser to check your mail.  Little features like this can be downloaded seperately, however, and that is why I give Netscape Browser a  2 out of 5.   So, Mozilla's Firefox is definitely the best browser out there, and you can also get Mozilla 1.8 currently, which is like the Netscape Browser, with email and stuff, but, not as fast as Firefox.  For anyone who has a slow connection, Firefox will help set the way and make your connection seem much faster.  It can be downloaded at www.mozilla.com. --------------------------------------  Well, that about wraps things up for today's installments of bagel.tech.  Here is everything we reviewed today, and some comments about them:  For Games we looked at ZUMA, from Pop Cap Games, on Yahoo.  The game has nice graphics, simple gameplay, and a high addiction level.  It received a  5 out of 5.   For today's Download of the Day, we looked at jetAudio, a media player that allows you to open different formats, including WMA, MP3, MOV, AVI, MPEG, WAV, and more.  You can create and look at lyrics while you play your music, and it's got a nice interface.  jetAudio received a  4.5 out of 5.   For today's site of the day, you got a look at Home Star Runner.  This site offers the best web cartoons, has a unique cast of characters, and has been around for a long, long time.  Home Star Runner has still got it, as it scored a  5 out of 5.   Today's tip, which is right above, showed you the best and fastest browser to replace the standard Internet Explorer.  We reviewed Mozilla's Firefox, Avant Browser, Opera, and Netscape, and Mozilla Firefox received the top marks as the best and fastest browser.  That's it for today's bagel.tech updates.  Join me tomorrow as we look at Text Twist, check out an awesome downloading tool, and take a look at a nice tool to help you find out more about your favorite movies.  Until tomorrow, be sure to check out The Blog of the Bagel for tonight's update, and say something in the message board!

       Today's site of the day is called Home Star Runner, and it's one of the best places to go to get a good laugh.  It's a web cartoon site, and it's got some of the best web cartoons in this world.  It's been highly praised since it opened a few years ago, and now, its even better than before.       Home Star Runner follows the life of Home Star...a little white thing...haven't quite figured out what he is.  It also follows his friends, including his girlfriend, Marzipan, and other characters, such as Strong Bad, Strong Mad, Strong Sad, The Cheat, and more.  They have all sorts of toons, including big cartoons, shorts, holiday cartoons, and the best, Strong Bad emails.  Every week, the creators of Home Star Runner will post a new cartoon, and most of the time, it will be a Strong Bad Email.  Strong Bad goes to his Compy 386 and checks his email, and always ends up telling a story about his life.  They're hilarious, and a lot of people go to the site just to see them.  Here's a couple screenshots from the new "Theme Park" episode of Strong Bad Email:        Some of the bigger cartoons have menus that will remind you of a DVD, and you can watch all sorts of special features that go along with the film.    There are all sorts of games to play, all sorts of activities, and it is definitely a great website.  I give Home Star Runner the elite score of  5 out of 5.

          jetAudio is the ultimate media player for anyone who likes music.  Different formats and compatibility make it ideal for anyone who likes music.  Oh yeah, it does movies too.   The first download of the day I want to share with you guys is jetAudio.  Now, this isn't your regular, everyday media player.  Normally, your standard media players allow you to play only MP3s, only WMAs, or only .mov.  Well, that's not the case with jetAudio.  JetAudio lets you play all of those, and more.  Unlike MusicMatch, it's main competitor, JetAudio allows you to play an assortment of different files, eliminating the need for several different media players.  The player is compatible with formats such as MP3, MPEG, WMA, WMV, MOV, AVI, and many, many more, making it ideal for the person who has music in all different formats.  Plus, it's not a huge download file, so you'll save a lot of room on your hard drive for any other things you may want to download.    One awesome feature of jetAudio is that you can also convert your media files to other formats, so that if jetAudio doesn't support it (and there isn't too many formats it doesn't support), you can quickly convert it to one that you have.  jetAudio also comes with jetCast, which you use with your IP address to broadcast your own radio shows.  It is not difficult to use.  All you have to do is find your IP address, and make sure it is compatible, and the rest is just as easy as using jetAudio.    You can also burn CDS, rip CDs, manage playlists, and use the timers and alarms to wake you up in the morning.  This is definitely one awesome media player, and definitely worth giving it a patented   4.5 out of 5.

          Zuma, by Pop Cap games, is one of the most addicting web games I have ever played. Here, you can see what happens when you clear a level.   Pop Cap Games is responsible for many of the big name web games we see these days, and they've recently come out with yet another addicting game, called Zuma. In Zuma, your mission is simple- get rid of all the little balls on the map by shooting balls of the same color at them. As you progress, each level gets faster, so you'll have less time to complete. If the moving balls reach the trap door and fall in, then guess what? You lose. You get three lives, though, which is nice, so you won't automatically have to start over from the beginning.  I'm highly addicted to this game. I first found it at Yahoo Games when I was looking for something to play in my Business class last semester. Ever since, I think I dragged a few people into playing both in that class and yearbook. But, now that the school has blocked all instances of games from the school's servers, I can't do that anymore.  You control a little frog-like sphere thingy, which shoots out the jewels, or balls, or whatever you want to call them. You'll see what color you're about to spit out, and you need to aim it towards moving balls of the same color. Once you have a set of three, the balls go away, as can be seen in the screen shot below:     Your job is to obviously clear the board before the balls reach the trap door. So, you have to act quickly and have proper aiming techniques, or else you won't make it in the higher levels. I think the highest I've ever gotten to is around level 4-2. Around then, it really starts to get tough.  This game is highly addicting, its got nice graphics for a web game, and its definitely worth the score of  5 out of 5.

       Welcome to Bagel Tech, the new blog from the same person who brought you The Blog of the Bagel.  This new blog is dedicated to the internet, computers, and anything you can do with them.  Sorry guys, can't post porn, so don't even ask.  Every day, check out BagelTech for the hottest inside tips and tricks, including links and reviews to websites, games, downloads, and more, and its all free.  Then, if you like what you see, head over to The Blog of the Bagel and tell me what you think in the message board.    Later today, I'll have a couple of reviews and things, so be sure to check it out later.  This blog will update two or three times a day, not sure, but, be sure to check it out.  Everything will be able to be found in the archives, too, if you missed out on it the first time, and I'll end every week on Saturdays with a review of what I saw this week, telling you what I thought was best, and what I thought was worst.  Here is my ratings system, just so you care:  0- This is probably not worth your attention. 1- Boring, but may interest boring people. 2- Alright, maybe worth checking it out. 3- Definitely worth a look. 4- Very interesting, maybe worth bookmark material. 5- The best of the best, and shouldn't be missed by anyone who uses the internet.  Why do I have two blogs now?  Its easy...I'm bored.  And I know that a lot of other people are bored, too.  That's why I am committed to updating my blogs on a regular basis.  The reasons?    1. Like I said, I'm bored, and others are bored. B. The internet has so much to offer, so why not help people find stuff? 3. I want that freakin' Gmail invite!  Today, I'll be getting right to work and finding the best internet stuff out there.  Expect at least two reviews, the download of the day, and more.  There will be at least three posts here today, and at least two at The Blog of the Bagel, so, as you can probably tell, I've got something to do now.  Enjoy BagelTech.

        urlLink   &nbsp; Zelda's back. Check out my preview.&nbsp;  urlLink     You've heard by now that The Legend of Zelda is returning for an all new romp on the Nintendo GameCube in 2005.&nbsp; The news came at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles in May.&nbsp; Magazines stopped the press to include this story in their next issues.&nbsp; Websites were flooded with screens and traffic regarding the game.&nbsp; But, not too much was revealed about this new game from Zelda's mastermind Shigeru Miyamoto when it was first announced.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  When Nintendo originally said that a new Zelda game would be available in 2004, they also had stated that it would share the same graphical style as the previous game in the Zelda series, The Wind Waker.&nbsp; The Wind Waker featured a new, cartoony graphic style that was hailed as controversial to the gaming public, and was not popular amongst some gamers.&nbsp; Through it all, the game turned out to be one of the best Zelda games in the series, and now, they are looking to set the standard even higher with this new title.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well, Nintendo lied about two things when they announced "Wind Waker 2" back in 2003.&nbsp; First off, this game does not feature the cartoon style graphics like they said it would.&nbsp; They took the graphic style that was shown at a Nintendo event back in the year 2000 for a GameCube technical demo, and they made it into one of the most impressive looking games that will be released on the system.&nbsp; Yes, even better looking than Metroid.&nbsp; They also lied when they said it would be out by the end of 2004.&nbsp; Hate to break it to you, Zelda fans, but, you're gonna have to wait until Spring 2005 to play this one.&nbsp; They expect to have the game playable at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in May of 2005.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Many of the screens that Nintendo released to the gaming press when the game was announced suggested that there is a war going on in the land of Hyrule this time around.&nbsp; Link is much more mature in this installment of the game.&nbsp; In "The Wind Waker," he was the child Link that we see sometimes.&nbsp; In this new game, he looks about 17.&nbsp; That's a big step up for only a 2 year difference between games.&nbsp; Anyway, massive amounts of enemies were shown, in a formation that makes you think that the game might take place during a war.&nbsp; One of the big changes is that it looks like you can ride your horse, Epona, as well as attack enemies at the same time, a big feature that was missed out on in Ocarina of Time, which was released on the Nintendo 64 in 1998.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  This game looks to be incredibly promising.&nbsp; The graphics look outstanding, and even though we don't know anything confirmed about its story, its gameplay, or anything else that doesn't deal with graphics, I do know for sure that this will be the GameCube title to own when it releases in 2005.&nbsp; Be ready, because the unexpected may be coming in 2005.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Tomorrow on Digital Lust, I've got two Photoshop tricks for you, and then something else before I head off to Orlando for the week.&nbsp; Remember, I am looking for people to fill in for me and post whatever they want regarding gaming and technology.&nbsp; See the post below for more details.&nbsp; I need people by tomorrow, if at all possible, so that they can start early Monday morning.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Digital Lust will officially relaunch on August 9th, 2004, if you haven't heard.&nbsp; The format will be similar to this, plus a mix of the other stuff that you've gotten used to over the past few weeks.&nbsp; I'm going to be taking more of a focus on videogames, since that seems to be incredibly popular in the search engines (we went from 30-something hits to 65 in a day, and it was all for searches on Spiderman 2...its incredible!).&nbsp; I want Digital Lust to be a success, and based on the past couple days, I would say that it can happen.&nbsp; I'll see you tomorrow, here on Digital Lust, for a special Sunday update.&nbsp; Remember, until I return here tomorrow, you can check out Blog of Bagel by going to  urlLink http://bagel05.blogspot.com  for my nightly posts.&nbsp; I've been posting a lot of interesting things around there, including the new "Nerdular Nerdance" monthly column, and this month, it's on Yearbook Camp, where I'm heading to on Monday.&nbsp; Also there include the Late Night Bloggin' segment, where I go through Blogger, find some interesting blogs, and talk about them, either praising them, or making fun of them.&nbsp; And, of course, I post other things there too.&nbsp; It's all from the coolest nerd you'll ever know!&nbsp; See ya!

         By now, you've probably heard that Nintendo and Sony are set to release two new handhelds in the next year, the Nintendo DS and the Sony PSP. The two consoles are going to launch separately, the DS on November 11, 2004, and the PSP, sometime in 2005. The new systems seem to both be awesome machines, and now, we are here to compare the two, here on Digital Lust, for a sneak preview of the new fall format for the blog.      Sony PSP   When Sony first announced their new PSP at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 2003, gamers were puzzled as to what it would do; what kind of graphics it would be able to handle, how much it would cost, will it break easily like other Playstation products, things of that matter. Nothing was revealed about the new console with the exception that it was in development. Then, in late 2003, a concept image of the console revealed it to have almost PS2-quality graphics, along with an optical disc drive, and a sweet widescreen format that takes up most of the console, something that Gameboy owners have been dying to have since the Gameboy Advance first came out. No specs or anything were revealed.     At the Electronic Entertainment Expo in May 2004, Sony unleashed the PSP. Special features include the ability to watch flicks on the console (Spiderman 2! Spiderman 2! Spiderman 2!), play games with almost PS2-quality graphics, play MP3 files, and it would also feature connectivity with the Playstation 2, similar to what Nintendo's Gameboy Advance can do with the Nintendo GameCube. Although nothing was playable at the trade show, according to various sources around the internet, several Playstation Portable units were being displayed at the show, to show off what they can do. Games like Gran Turismo, Grand Theft Auto, Jak and Daxter, Ratchet and Clank, and others are to be expected from the system (Gran Turismo is already confirmed!).     The only things we have to be worried about with the PSP are its price, its battery life, and its ability to survive being dropped. With all of these sweet features that Sony is promising with the PSP, you can expect a much higher price out of this thing. With the optical disc drive, you have to worry about the battery life of the console, and if it will only last a few hours. And, also with the drive, will it break easily like most optical drives do? Will Sony repair it if it does, or will you have to fork out $200 to get it fixed? Sony has not answered any of these questions yet, and don't intend to, at least until they show the thing off next. These are the major concerns among people who are interested in getting a new handheld device. Sony doesn't have the best track record for customer service, and replacing broken consoles since they break easily.     Nintendo DS         Nintendo announced in 2003 that they had something "huge" coming in 2004, but wouldn't tell us whether it was a new console, a handheld, or another Mario game where the "huge" comes in at Mario being able to shoot fire through a fire cannon. But, it turned out to be a handheld when they announced it in 2004. The Nintendo "DS" stands for "Dual screen," but also for "Developer's System." That is because the system features two 3 inch, color, backlit screens, giving developers new ways to develop creative games. Nothing else was said about the system, other than the fact that both screens could be used together to form one giant, six inch screen, and they also said that the screens would "stack," meaning one would be on top of the other.     At the Electronics Entertainment Expo in 2004, Nintendo revealed the Nintendo DS in playable form, and...it's ugly. Nintendo mentioned that it was only a prototype, and that the final design had not been confirmed yet, but, this thing was ugly, and better not be a taste of what's to come. For having N64 quality graphics, it should at least have an analog stick. This does not. It's got four directional buttons, four action buttons, and L and R buttons, and that's it. The system looks really lame.    Some of the cool features of the Nintendo DS include voice recognition technology, adding a new level of play to your game. They also have touch screen on the bottom screen, allowing you to "draw" your Pac Man for the new Pac Man game, send instant messages, and control your character. This is a pretty cool features, but you'd have to be careful with your stylus to avoid damaging the screen.    Most of the games that Nintendo showed off for the Nintendo DS were very, very lame. Super Mario 64x4 is simply a multiplayer port of Super Mario 64, and the graphics look really choppy and bad. Metroid Prime: Hunters looks alright, but, too much of the same from the GameCube game.     Overall, I think Nintendo needs to do some research and work before this thing can be dubbed the "Virtual Boy of the 21st Century." The system is really ugly, and I don't like the games, but, it has the potential. Nintendo just needs to get crackin' if they want to have a good system out by its November 11th release.  ----------------------    So, which console is better? It's too early to tell which one is definitely the better one, but now, I'm leaning towards the Sony PSP. I'm not a huge fan of Sony products, but, Nintendo is not doing a very good job of getting the point across with this whole Nintendo DS business. The name hasn't even been confirmed yet, and they want to launch it in November. As soon as Sony gives me new details on the PSP, I'm sold.    Join me later on today for something on the Tech side of Digital Lust, in today's preview of the fall formatting. Remember, we are doing only two posts a day from now on, something from the gaming world, and something from the tech world. And it all varies. So, you have to be here to check it out!

        The Lowdown:  Because I'm essentially out of webgames to review (for now, new ones start Wednesday), I'm going to review Spiderman 2 for ya.  Now, I went and got Spiderman 2 for my Xbox last week, and I have no flaws with it.  The difficulty is perfect, the graphics are awesome.  When there is sound, its awesome.  So what could be possibly wrong with this game?  Well, it's the best movie to game translation I've seen this year, in fact...ever.  (The Shrek 2 game would have been that title, too, and so would Chronicles of Riddick).  Have we seen the end of bad movie-to-game translations?  No, not necessarily, but, we're seeing a lot more good ones.  Anyway.  I'll start out by talking about the storyline, and if you haven't seen the movie, ignore it.  The story is essentially the same as the movie, but, has some different things, like extra bosses, such as Rhino, Shocker (my personal favorite), and Mysterio.  Of course, you'll be fighting Doc Ock in this game, too, since he is in fact the enemy that you are dealing with in the actual storyline of the movie.  In fact, here's a breakdown of each boss:  Rhino- Just appears out of nowhere.  His difficulty is somewhere around a medium.  You have to dodge his attacks before you can attack, and if you miss, you have to wait until the next time he tries to get you.  Mysterio- This is the most annoying part of the game.  Quentin Beck, a Hollywood director, first challenges Spidey to a little matchup, where he has to get more criminals in these tanks.  Then, you have to complete his obstacle course.  Then, later on, Quentin holds a press conference, where he holds reporters hostage and becomes Mysterio, and Spidey must save all of the reporters and defeat these drone like things.  Then, Mysterio creates this "brain" that is trying to take over the Statue of Liberty, surrounding it in a electric field.  You have to swing all the way out there on these little overhead platforms (which aren't easy to get to the end of), take out 8 orbs and defeat this "brain."  Then, you'll end up in a funhouse, where you'll have to pass through clones of yourself that come out of mirrors.  Then, that's it...there's no actual boss battle that goes along with it.  Shocker- You'll fight Shocker twice, and he is actually the easiest boss in the game.  Just dodge his electric attacks, and you'll be fine against him.    Doc Ock- You'll fight him three times.  Once, he kidnaps Aunt May and tries to take her away via Helicopter.  Then, he'll kidnap Mary Jane, and you'll have to defeat him on a train.  That's where the second part of it begins.  You'll then end up in a warehouse, where you'll have to disarm 9 switches before being able to hit him.  Then, you'll defeat him, and then, the game is over...at least, the story part is.  This game has outstanding replay value.  After you beat the story mode, you are only 50% complete with the game.  There are so many more awards to unlock, and in order to complete the game, you have to accumilate 50,000 more hero points.  There's so much to do, so many places to go... that it makes this game even more fun.  The cool thing about Spiderman 2 is that it is a GTA-like game, allowing you to wander all around the city in search of something to do.  Webslinging has never been more fun, as you can go to the top of the Empire State Building, fall off of it, and practically kill yourself.  Hahaha.  No.  That's not funny.  But, being able to travel throughout New York City is very fun. You'll find something new every day.  I have yet to complete the final chapter, which is completing the 50,000 hero points, but, I'll make it eventually.  There's so many more awards to unlock that I haven't yet.  I can't wait to get them all!  You have Daily Bugle missions to complete, Pizza delivery missions to complete, and on top of that, earning your awards by finishing the arcade games, saving people, and destroying enemy tanks!  There is so much to do in Spiderman 2, and it really sets it aside from most games.  This is the best movie-to-game translation I have ever played, and one of the best games that I have played all year.  Definitely give this one a shot, it's available on Xbox, GameCube, PS2, GBA, PC, and NGAGE.   Pros  +Sweet Graphics +Open-Ended Gameplay +Sweet difficulty   Cons  -Mysterio is ANNOYING! -Steep difficulty may not be for everyone   Score  Fun Factor: 100%-A Graphics/Layout: 95%-A Speed: 100%-A Customization/Controls: 100%-A Final: 98.75%-A Gold!

       Ending our Blogger week this week, I've got 3 tips for ya, and they'll help you customize your blog to the highest extent possible.  So, here's your three tips.   StatCounter  Link:  urlLink Click here   This program lets you track how many visitors come to your blog, and who they are, and gives you even more detailed results, like how many new visitors you get every day, how many returning visitors you get, and even what Browser and OS they use.  All you have to do is copy and paste some HTML into your blog (I put mine in the sidebar for the counter), and you're all set to go.  This is especially helpful if you run a blog like this one, where you actually want to see who's looking at it.  Its easy, its free, and you can put all of your blogs under one account.  All you have to do is go to http://www.statcounter.com, sign up, and you're all set.  Setting it up is increidbly easy, and you'll be able to check your stats from the Statcounter site.     Blogskins  Link:  urlLink Click here   This is so you can find a new skin for your blog.  I recommend this to anyone who doesn't like the big, better looking skins on Blogger.  I'm not bashing this, but, I haven't found too many on that site that I would use, and I haven't found any that I definitely would use.  It's got some okay skins, and I have no idea how the installation works, but, I think you're better off using this if you're using FTP access to get to your blog instead of updating through the web.   Haloscan  Link:  urlLink Click Here   If you want a better, more detailed commenting system for your blog than the regular Blogger commenting system, this is where you definitely want to go.  Setting it up may be a little difficult for anyone who isn't big with their HTML knowledge, but, it works all the same.  All you have to do is put the HTML where it tells you to (check the FAQs on the Haloscan site to see where exactly its supposed to go).    Not only do they give you free commenting with abilities to ban, delete, and do other things to messages, but, they also give you trackback, which allows you to see who's been writing about your blog entries.  It's really easy to use once its set up, and all you have to do is turn Blogger's commenting system off when you get it in, and, you're all set.  And it works great.  Use these tips, because they will definitely help you customize your Blogger experience to make it the best it can be.  You'll add new levels of interactivity with your blog.  Next week, we're not going to have tips every day.  We'll be closed Monday and Tuesday, since I will be out of town, and then, for the rest of the week, I'll be wrapping things up for the month of July already (going to be out of town for the majority of the rest of the month as of this point).  We'll have all new daily features, like another Digital Lust war, one tip, and more.    Up Next on Digital Lust, your game of the day.

        The Lowdown:  BearShare is another one of those file sharing programs, and this one is one of the better ones.  I've noticed this one to be much better looking and faster than most of the other file share programs, such as Kazaa or iMesh.    BearShare may not have the best name, but, it serves its purpose...its a p2p network so you can share files with other users.  It's much faster than the other ones.  The interface for BearShare is the cleanest interface for a file sharing program.  It integrates perfectly with Windows XP, and it doesn't freeze at all!  (At least, not yet it hasn't).  Overall, I'd say this is the best file sharing program.  It runs on Gnutella, it's fast, and it's the best one yet.  Go download it.    Pros  +Fast +Nice Interface +Easier to download things   Cons  -Stupid Name    Score  Fun Factor: 95%-A Graphics/Layout: 100%-A Speed: 98%-A Customization/Controls: 95%-A Final:  97%-A GOLD  ------------------------- Daily Wrap Up- July 8, 2004  Today we looked at some new things, and gave out two platinums.    We looked at "In God We Trust" on Atom Films Hi-Def for the video of the day.  It's hilarious, original storyline, and great production values.  This received a 100% Platinum.  Today's tip was finding the best guestbook to use for your blog.  I recommend iGuest over anything else, but we also took a look at HTML Gear, and Ultraguest.    Today's Site was Rotten Tomatoes, which received a 100% Platinum.  This is the place to go to find the best movie reviews, game reviews, and more.  They have the tomatometer which tells you if a movie or game is fresh or rotten, depending on its archived score.    And finally, today's download was BearShare.  This is the best file sharing program out there, its fast, and it's easy to use.  That's it for Digital Lust tonight.  Be sure to check out Blog of Bagel for my nightly escapade, with Late Night Bloggin', and other things.  See you tomorrow here on Digital Lust.

        Rotten Tomatoes Gets Rated... Fresh or Rotten?    The Lowdown:  This is one that I've been waiting to do for a long, long time.  Rotten Tomatoes is the premiere site to go for movie reviews.  They archive all of the major reviews that newspapers, magazines, and others publish for each movie, average the scores for each one, and it determines the movie's rating on the "Tomatometer."  There are two ratings on the Tomatometer, Fresh and Rotten.  If the movie has scored higher than a 60% average, it receives a Fresh Rating.  Anything under 60% gets a rotten rating.    They also cover DVD/VHS, and also videogames, which is nice for people who are looking for archived scores of games, similar to what GameRankings does, which I reviewed last week.  The Tomatopicker helps you find games, so you can check the reviews for each game to determine whether it is fresh or not.   The site also features something called "The Vine," which is like a blog service.  Wow, the things they do for these movie sites now.  Its incredible.  And now that Rotten Tomatoes has been acquired by IGN, you can expect more things to come for the site in the near future.  The site features a design that is quick to load, even on slow connections, and it looks great, too.  Its very clean, which makes it ideal for anyone who is tired of looking at cluttered websites.   urlLink    The "Tomatometer" tells you if the movie is fresh or not, and gives you links to articles that review the movie.&nbsp; urlLink     Overall, I think this is the best site that I have reviewed so far.  It's a lot of fun to look at, very helpful in deciding what movies to see, what DVDs and games to buy, and a great site all around.  This site receives my first ever "Site of the Month" award.  Congratulations.   Pros  +Nice design +Archives for movie reviews +Tomatometer tells you if its fresh or not +Also covers games and DVDS/VHS   Cons  -The fact that I can't find any cons!    Score  Fun Factor: 100%-A Graphics/Layout: 100%-A Speed: 100%-A Customization/Controls: 100%-A Final: 100%-A Certified Fresh by Digital Lust!  What?  Two platinums in one day?  Have I gone soft?  Probably.  Up next on Digital Lust, today's download of the day, and the daily wrap up.  Stick around!  Coming at 1:45.

       Today's tip is how you can find a good guestbook for your blog, one that is easy to use and is compatible with your Blogger.  You can find most of the guestbooks I'm going to talk about on the Blogger Help pags for guestbooks.  I have three that I'm going to talk about, and I have used two before.  The first one is HTML Gear.  This product is from Lycos, and is relatively easy to set up, but, its not the best one.  You can set up an account, which gets you all sorts of other addons and things for your blog, and then create your guestbook, copy the HTML, and add it onto the sidebar on your blog, or whereever.  The next one is iGuest.  This one is the one that I currently use here on Digital Lust, and also on Blog of Bagel, and it works great.  Its easy to setup, and the interface is simple showing up on your blog... it's a good one, and I'm going to recommend this more than any other one that I review.  And, finally, the last one I'm going to talk about is Ultraguest.  This one has a nice interface, and is easy to use, and fits right into your blog.  It's not that popular yet, and its not as good as iGuest, but, it may change eventually.  So, I am going to recommend that you use iGuest for your guestbook needs over anything.  Tomorrow, for Friday Tips, I will have two tips, one about HaloScan, and the other about finding new skins.  And that will wrap it up for Blogger.   Up next on Digital Lust, in about half an hour, today's site of the day, Rotten Tomatoes!  Check it out!

        Summary  Today's video of the day (this isn't an every day thing, btw) is a video called In God We Trust, and it's on AtomFilms.  This one is available on AtomFilms Hi-Def's version for last week (which means, if you didn't have AtomFilms last week, you'll have to see it on your regular media player through the website, ha ha).  And it's hilarious.  At the beginning, this guy is holding a quarter, and it zooms in on the words "In God We Trust," then all of a sudden, he gets hit by one of those new extended Jeep things... and he dies.  He finds himself in the Death Determination Office (not sure what its called, but, that's what I'm calling it), where he learns that because of his negative life score, he is going to hell.  So, he quickly escapes and goes back down to earth, to try and regain some of those points back by doing good things.  However, the people at the Death Determination Office are trying to kill him in the process (ironic, right?).  Will he survive and go to Heaven?  You'll have to find out by watching it!   Pros  +Absolutely Hilarious +Great Production Value   Cons  -Eh, nothing!    Score  Fun Factor: 100%-A Presentation: 100%-A Length: 100%-A Quality: 100%-A Final:  100%-A PLATINUM!    Next: Your Tip of the day, Finding a Guestbook to Use for Blogger.

        The Lowdown:  UGO (Underground Online) is the ultimate place to go to find practically anything on the entire interweb.  Every day on the site, you can see different things in each of the several subjects that the site covers, including movies, tech, videogames, sports, girls, and much more.  Every section is filled with some of the most quality content that I have ever seen in a website of this magnatude.  Currently, my favorite feature on the website is the interview with the people that created the special effects for Spiderman 2.  They do such a good job with it, and it's definitely one of the better sites out there.  The layout for UGO.com is very graphic, and it looks great.  It's not as good, as say, 1up.com, but, it's still a very nice looking website.  It is very easy to navigate through the site, and it runs pretty fast, as well.   urlLink    UGO is the place to go for practically anything. Games, Film, TV, DVD, Music, Tech, Sports, Comics, Girls, and Video!&nbsp; urlLink     So, overall, UGO is a great site, it gets a high recommendation from me.  Check it out, at www.ugo.com.    Pros  +Nice design +Great Content +Lots of different sections   Cons  -I can't think of any!    Score  Fun Factor: 100%-A Graphics/Layout: 95%-A Speed: 100%-A Content: 100%-A Final: 98.75%-A GOLD! ------------------------------- Daily Wrap Up  Hope you liked the first day of Digital Lust, the new name for bagel.tech.  We're looking at more stuff than ever before, and the content that you see here is only going to get better.  Here's what we looked at today:  Today's tip of the day was how you can change blogs.  If you're wanting to combine two blogs, you're going to have to copy and paste each post to your new blog from your old blog, and you can make them post at the same time that the original post was, by selecting "More Post Options," and changing the date and time to the same as the old post.  Today's download was Atom Films Hi-Def.  This service is free, and lets you download your favorite Atom Films in gloriful Hi Definition.  This download received a 96.25, and is a high recommendation.  If you are a fan of Atom Films, check this one out, because you can't go wrong with it.  Today's video, which was a new feature, was the newest edition of Strong Bad Email, which is called Cheatday, on HomeStarRunner.com.  This one isn't the best Strong Bad Email that I've watched, but it is still as good as any other one.    Today's site of the day, seen above, is UGO.com.  This is almost a perfect site, which would have made it the first 100% that I would have given in the new rating system.  Everything is easy to navigate on the site.  UGO.com received a 98.75%.    And that's it for Digital Lust today.  Be sure to check out Blog of Bagel tonight for some Late Night Bloggin', a brand new eBay Hunter, and what's going on in my life today.  Here's the tentative schedule for tomorrow:  GAME Impressions: Spiderman 2: The Game.  I'm going to be giving a preliminary review of Spiderman 2: The Game, for the Xbox.  I've beaten it, and it's a great game, and now, my preliminary review.  DOWNLOAD: Adobe Acrobat  TIP: Finding a guestbook for Blogger  SITE: To Be Announced.  We'll see you tomorrow here on Digital Lust.

        Summary  Today's video is Strong Bad Email's newest addition, Cheatday.  In Cheatday, Strong Bad gets asked by a viewer what they did for cheat's birthday.  Since they are unsure when Cheatday really is, they go by the birthday on his fake ID, which states that he is a Scandinavian Cole Miner.  He starts off by singing, and then they play games, and then Strong Bad lets Cheat answer some of his emails, each one saying, "Yeah Man, I'll gnaw your head off."  This one isn't the best Strong Bad Emails that I have looked at.  There are some much better.  But, oh well, it's good enough.

        The Lowdown:  If you look back a couple weeks to see the Shockwave.com review, it received a score higher than 100%.  That site is that good, people, and now, with the help of Maven Technologies and Microsoft's Windows Media Hi-Definition, Atom Films presents a new download for you, absolutely free: Atom Films Hi-Def.  This allows you to watch your favorite Atom Films on your computer, in beautiful, almost DVD-Quality format.  And it looks good, too...but, is it worth the download?  Yes and no.  Why?  Yes because you can see your favorite Atom Films, like Angry Kid and others, in beautiful streaming Hi-Def.  No, because the films take an eternity to download, which kills the purpose of having it.  In order to use Atom Films Hi-Def, you need to get the Maven Technologies thingy, which is like a TV on the interweb, and you can download different "channels" to view.  Atom Films Hi-Def is one of the biggest ones, and, it's a good channel, but, with the downloads taking forever, it makes it a little bad.  You get a certain amount of downloads every week (either 2 or three), and if you refer people to sign up for Atom Films Hi-Def, you get extra ones.  It's a cool system, I'm going to recommend that anyone signs up (refer thebagel05, so I get can some new ones).    If you're a huge fan of AtomFilms, like me, then you definitely want to check this out, because it's a great service, its free, and the content is unbelievable.  The quality is so good, you're going to want more and more of the same!   Pros  +Near DVD Quality Content Straight on your computer! +Free +Easy to Use   Cons  -Downloads take a while. -Only allowed 2 or 3 downloads every time new movies come in.

       This one is really simple, and you probably already knew it, but, I'm going to make it today's tip anyway, since I recently tried to do this.    Alright, if you want to merge blogs or move all your posts to another blog that you created, you're going to have to copy and paste every single one.  I'm going to teach you the quick and easy way, and it's very simple.    1. Open up two browser windows or tabs or whatever. 2. Send one of them to the edit posts section of your old blog. 3. Let that load. 4. Use the other one to create a new post for the new blog.  Make sure that your new blog is already created at this point. 5. When your old blog's posts have all shown up on the Edit posts page, go down to the very first one (you may need to select View 50 entries at once to see them all, if not 100, depending on the size of your blog).  Click Edit.   6. Copy all of the text, and then, at the bottom, where it says More Post Options, open it up, to see what the date and time of the post is. 7. Now, in the new blog's Create New Post page, put in the title of your post, paste the contents, and then, under More Post Options, enter the same date and time that you saw that the post was originally posted at. 8. Click Publish Post, then return to your Old Blog's browser window. 9. Hit the back button.  All of your posts will already be loaded, and you can keep editing each post, and repeating from Step 6 until you are all done.  It may take you a little while, but, it's the easiest way to move posts between blogs.     Up Next on Digital Lust : Today's Video of the Day, Strong Bad Email!

       Congratulations, you've just all been part of a nice scheme that I played, in order to present tomorrow's Blogger tip!  We'll have 2 blogger tips tomorrow, since I didn't get to tonight's.  Things will be different tomorrow because we're starting new things.  Here's what to expect tomorrow:  Starting things off will be the video of the day, which is a strong bad email on Home Star Runner.  Then, we'll have the site of the day.  After that, a download.  And then, the two blogger tips that I'll have for you.  Part of the scheme was me changing the name, and I'm going to find out how I can change the URL if at all possible.  So, stick around, and we'll have everything fixed tomorrow.

        The Lowdown:  Glinx is yet another game from the creators of the highly acclaimed Text Twist and Collapse.  But does it live up to the expectations that have been set for games by the popular creator?  The answer is yes.  And no.  Glinx is fun, and addicting at first, but gets incredibly boring after around level 5.    In Glinx, you have to clear the board by forming chains of the same shape.  There are several shapes, and you want to form the biggest chains to clear the board quicker.  After around level 5, you'll begin to realize that it gets boring, even though new shapes show up, and obstacles block you from forming your chains.    If you want a good game, this might work, but, there are much better games to try instead of this one.  The graphics are simple, and forming your chains is easy, as well.     urlLink    Form huge chains by clearing the way and moving cursor over several blocks that aren't blocked by others.&nbsp; urlLink     Overall, this would be a good game to try, but not one to get addicted to and play repeatedly.  There are only 10 levels, so its rather short, and doesn't present much of a challenge.  GameHouse could have done better with this one, but, oh well.  Their other games are better.    Pros  +Easy to play +Nice, simple interface   Cons  -Gets boring easily -Only 10 levels -Too easy   Score  Fun Factor: 75%-C Graphics/Layout: 90%-A Speed: 75%-C Customization/Controls: 80%-B Final:  80%-B Silver    Up Next: Blogger Tip of the Day and Daily Wrapup

        The Lowdown:  Tired of your connection dying on you when you're in the middle of a really big download, and have to start the whole freakin' thing over again?  I sure am, and now, a new program can help eliminate that problem.  Leech Get 2004 is the perfect solution to help you get your downloads (your legal downloads, like pictures, America's Army, etc.) without the hassle of having to restart everytime your connection gives out.  The program allows you to stop, resume, and pick up downloads from where they stopped, just in case your connection goes out.  If you have to get offline, you can stop the download, and resume it when you get back online.  It's compatible with Internet Explorer, however, there is a patch that allows Mozilla, Netscape, and Opera users to join in on the action, which allows for a bigger userbase, since Mozilla is quickly becoming a popular browser.  You can even set up a download without going to a browser, provided that you know the download's URL, and can use the setup wizard very easily.    This program has a mild difficulty curve, but only if you decide to set up without going to a browser.  I tried setting one up without my browser, and I just didn't like it.  It takes forever for the download to start, as well.  It goes through a long, long creation process.  It almost seems like it would be easier and faster to use your regular download manager, but, you can't stop your downloads in those without having to restart from the beginning.  Other than that, it is very, very easy to use.  It features an Outlook-like interface, which is also easy to use.  Dialup users, this is your chance to get big downloads, like America's Army (which I'm downloading now).  Once you get past the mild difficulty level, this thing is very easy to use, and I'm not sure if I can recommend it, because this thing can freeze your computer...alot.   Pros  +Allows you to stop and resume your downloads. +Perfect for long downloads +Perfect for 56K users   Cons  -Mild difficulty level makes this a little bit hard to use for people who don't have the right computer skills. -Freezes your computer WAAAY too much   Score  Easy to Use?: 75%-C Graphics/Layout: 95%-A Speed: 65%-D Customization/Controls: 85%-B Final:  80%-B Silver    Up Next: Game of the Day- Glinx!

       This morning we have two features in our first post, the first being our first ever Photoshop trick, and the second being our site of the day, which is the Hollywood Stock Exchange.  We'll start off with our Photoshop trick.   Removing Red Eye   This and all Photoshop tricks come from the Digital Imaging Guide, provided by the Walsworth Publishing Company from their Camp Orlando seminar in July 2003.  Here's the first trick, how to remove Red Eye.  Step 1: Open your image in Adobe Photoshop.  Step 2: Zoom in.  Select the Zoom tool from the Tool Palette, and place the tool over the left area of the red eye.  Click and drag to form a selection over the eye, and that area will fill the screen.  Step 3: Desaturate Color.  Select the paintbrush tool from the tool palette.  In options, select mode to Color, and Opacity at 100%.  Select a brush from the Brushes palette that is around the diameter of the iris of the red eye.  Click D on the keyboard to set foreground and background colors to Default.  Click and paint over the red portion of the eye.  Step 5: Save your Image.  It's that simple.  You can also apply different colors, and check back later today to find out how to do that.  And now, on to today's site of the day, the Hollywood Stock Exchange. -------------------------  The Lowdown-Hollywood Stock Exchange  Have you ever wanted to purchase your favorite actor?  Well, now you can with the Hollywood Stock Exchange.  This site allows you to invest fake money into actors, actresses, movies, and other things.  You get H$1,000,000 when you start off, and depending on what moves you make, that can go up or down.    I've been playing this game for about a year (under various accounts, since I keep forgetting my password), and it's a ton of fun.  Buying your moviestocks and starbonds is incredibly easy.  You can buy as many shares as you want to, then, wait until they get really high up, and then sell them to get more money.  Or, you can hang onto them, if you think that they are going to go up even higher.    If you refer a friend to the Hollywood Stock Exchange, you get a certain amount of H$, and there are other opportunities to earn extra credit every week, like a weekly poll (which gives you H$50,000), and others.  It's really interesting, it's a cool way to make more H$, and it's a lot of fun.  The Hollywood Stock Exchange is byfar one of the better sites that I have reviewed so far.  It can be seen as a game, but, I have other plans for a Game of the Day today, so, deal with it.  All you have to do is go to www.hsx.com and sign up, and you're all set to go.  Definite recommendation from me.     urlLink    The Hollywood Stock Exchange allows you to invest fake money into movies and movie stars. &nbsp; urlLink      Pros  +Invest in your favorite movies, stars, etc. +Easy to use +Nice interface +H$1,000,000 on the spot when you sign up.   Cons  -Can't play on weekends!   Score  Fun Factor: 100%-A Graphics/Interface: 100%-A  Speed: 100%-A Customization/Controls: 100%-A Final:  100%-A PLATINUM!

       Yeah, I did it again by posting something that was wrong... today's tip is how you add a search bar to your blog, instead of how to find different skins for your blog.  So, here's how you do it:  1. You can either add a Google bar (I haven't figured that one out yet), or, you can use a cool one that I found called FreeFind.    2. Go to www.freefind.com and sign up for an account.  You'll have to put in your blog's URL at some point, and the name of your blog.  3. Tell the Freefind spider to search your site while you put the HTML on your sidebar.  The spider will track through your site to create a search list.    4. You want to request the spider to go through your site on a regular basis if you want it to keep up with every new post that you add.  So, you should go to Schedule Re-indexing, and tell it that you want it to spider every day or whenever you want it.  You will receive an email everytime your site is spidered, so spider accordingly.  5. You need to put the HTML onto your sidebar, or where ever you want to put it on your blog.  So, click on HTML, click "Site Search Only."  This will put a search bar on your blog that ONLY searches your site, not the entire interweb.    6. After your HTML is on your blog, publish it, and take a look at it.  If the spider has not searched your blog yet, it won't work until it does.  It will show up, but it won't work.    And that's todays tip.  If you have any questions about today's tip or any other post, you can leave a comment, and I'll be sure to answer your questions.   ------------------------ Daily Wrap Up- July 5, 2004  Well, I changed a lot of stuff that I wasn't planning on changing, but minor computer problems are setting things back a little bit.  Tomorrow, I will have an all tip for Blogger, as well as my first Photoshop trick.  But, before I go off rambling about tomorrow, here's a summary of today here on bagel.tech:  In sites we looked at 2 sites today, re-reviewing 1up.com and GameHouse.com.  1up.com was reviewed last week, but technical difficulties on the site lead me to give it a C.  I re-reviewed it today, now that the problems are fixed, and it received an A and a gold award.  GameHouse is the creator of popular web games such as Collapse and Text Twist, and it received an A, as well.  For today's download, we looked at XFire Messenger.  This is the first instant messenger built for gamers, and it has some unique features and an awesome design.  XFire isn't for everyone, and it received an A.  Today's game of the day was Cubis.  This game is highly addicting, and one of my favorite games that I have reviewed so far.  The controls can be a little sloppy at times, despite me saying they were good.  It has a nice interface, but, this game loads really slow.  It received an A as well.  And finally, today's tip was how you can add a search bar to your blog, and have it search through your blog.  This is very easy to do, and it is great for sites like this one, and other blogs, and is a much easier way to find things than going through the archives.    That's it for today's bagel.tech updates.  Be sure to check out Blog of Bagel tonight for Late Night Bloggin', and be sure to check the archives there tonight, because I'm going to be moving the posts from my old blog on Xanga to Blog of Bagel, and the archives will all be under the proper dates.  Tomorrow, check back because we're going to be having 2 tips, one for Photoshop, and one for Blogger, a new download of the day, and a new game (no site of the day tomorrow).  Here's what to expect:  Starting things off tomorrow is my first Photoshop tip at 9:00 a.m. Then, at 11:00, check out the download of the day, which is undecided at this point. At 2:00, the game of the day is something on Uproar, but, I haven't made up my mind as to what it is yet. And, the Blogger tip for tomorrow is how to add Haloscan to your blog.    So, be sure to check it out tomorrow, it's going to be a power packed day here on bagel.tech.  See ya later.

        The Lowdown:  Yeah, I know, I was going to review MahJong Solitare for today's game, however, nothing happened when I tried to load it. So, intead, I'm going to review Cubis, a game that I've loved for a while.  This one is highly addicting, but doesn't deliver the same punch as Zuma.    The first con that I noticed is the loading time.  This loads very...very...very slow.  Maybe it's a Yahoo thing today, I don't know, but, I do know that its running very slow, and its not my connection for once.    Once you get into the game, your goal is to eliminate all the blocks on the field by throwing other blocks at them.  There is a grid, and you select which grid you want to send it towards, and it will stop at the end of the grid (or whereevr the blocks are on that grid).  It's really easy to maneuver, and this game is fun.  I don't have a problem with controlling this, but, other people that have played this that I have talked to don't like the control very much.  Sometimes the cube might go down into the wrong part of the grid.  You just have to learn to maneuver it better.  The control is really easy...in my opinion, at least.  There are several levels in this game, and each one is different.  You'll have fun getting further and further along, because it gets more challenging and blocks stack up.  While that isn't a problem, you have to get a certain amount of blocks cleared each round in order to move on.    urlLink    You have to remove a certain amount of cubes before you can move on to the next level. &nbsp; urlLink     Overall, this game is insanely fun, and I'm going to keep playing even after I finish writing the review.  Definitely check this one out, it's one of the better games I've reviewed on this website so far, and you'll definitely love it.   Pros  +Nice interface +Gives you a tutorial, if you want it +Easy controls   Cons  -Sloooow loading time   Score  Fun Factor: 99%-A Graphics/Layout: 90%-A Speed: 85%-B Customization/Controls: 100%-A Final:  93.5%-A Gold    Up Next: Tip of the day- Finding Skins for Blogger, and today's daily wrapup.

        The Lowdown:  There are tons of Instant Messenger services, like AIM, Yahoo, MSN, Jabber, and ICQ, but none like the one that I'm going to review today.  It's called Xfire, and it's in a beta test right now, however, it's more than just an instant messenger service.  This is the instant messenger for gamers.  Once you sign up, you'll be able to see everyone in your "Friend List," and what they are currently playing, if anything.  And, you can also join in on their game right on the spot, provided that it is an online game, and you have the game yourself.  This is a cool way for gamers to get to know each other better, and a cool way to meet new friends to battle in your online games, like Warcraft, Diablo, or America's Army, per say.  It's got a slick interface, which far surpasses any of the other messaging clients.    Because its built for gamers, XFire features a unique system for tracking what your friends are playing.  It shows up right in the  friends list what they are playing, and it is so easy to use.  All you have to do is put your mouse clicker thing over the name of the friend that you want to look up, and then it will tell you the game they are playing, and what server they are on.  It's a nice little addon to an instant messaging program, and gives you a better chance to meet up with other gamers to play against.   urlLink    XFire is the instant messenger for gamers... you can see who is playing what, and join in on their games as well.&nbsp; urlLink     If you're not a gamer, you *might* still enjoy this program, but, I definitely recommend it more to the gaming crowd.  You're going to have a lot of fun using this program, it's gotten much praise from many different sources, and since January, over 3/4 of a million gamers have signed up.  It's fast to download, it's only 756 kilobytes, making it incredibly easy to download, and getting started is even easier.  This one is a definite recommendation from me.   Pros  +Instant Messenger for Gamers +Nice interface +Shows what friends are playing, what server +Fast to Download   Cons  -If you're not a gamer, you may not enjoy it.   Score  Fun Factor: 85%-B Graphics/Layout: 100%-A Speed: 95%-A Customization/Controls: 85%-B Final:  91.25%-A Gold    Up Next: Game of the day- Mah Jong Solitare

        The Lowdown on 1Up:  Alright, welcome to another day of bagel.tech updates.  This week is Blogger week, so all this week check out tips to make your Blog look even better, and I'm also going to throw in a couple Photoshop tips if I get around to it.  The new design is here, now all I need to do is get that new name thought up of, and we'll be set.  And now, onto today's site of the day, which is going to be the re-review of 1up.com, which got a bad score last week, and deserves a better score.  1up.com recently relaunched last week with an all new design, and an all new content system, and the site looked better than ever before, don't get me wrong, but, the site had some bugs in it, and it was making it look kind of bad.  There are two main reasons that I scored this low when I reviewed it last week, and they are:  A. Because images wouldn't load. 2. Because the message board users can be stupid, a lot.  But, they appear to have been working on the situation, and they have made the site's appearance look better, and now everything works just fine.  Images are loading great, though, the message boards are still full of idiots sometimes (but, they follow other sites like IGN and GameSpot who have tons of them on their boards, too).  The main attraction at 1up.com now is the user interactivity.  With a little more time to discover what the deal is really about at the site, I made the decision that this is one of the better gaming sites around.  Here are just a couple things that I like about the user-interactivity.   -Arena: Rate pictures that people post, and get points for them. -Clubs: You can start your own club, join it, and have a club journal, message board, and other things, including your own URL on 1up.com. -Collection: You can build your gaming collection on 1up.com.  While this still isn't as good as the collection builder on IGN, its still a pretty cool attachment. -Blog: You can create your own blog on 1up.com.  Don't expect to see bagel.tech there though.  I'm too addicted to teh Bl0gg3r!    There's all sorts of other things that make this site great, including the content.  1up.com is owned by Ziff Davis Publishing, who creates several gaming magazines like EGM, GMR, and Computer Gaming World.  They have their content so where you can read articles that are in the magazines, and then 1up.com's original content.  It's a great idea for people who think about subscribing to their magazines, and it will make up their mind.    Overall, I think I was completely wrong about giving 1up.com a bad score, when it really did deserve better.     Pros  +Great User-interactivity +Great content +Sweet design that now loads correctly   Cons  -Still can be slow at times    Score  Fun Factor: 95%-A Graphics/Layout: 95%-A Speed: 95%-A Customization/Controls: 100%-A Final:  96.25%- A GOLD   And now, on to today's second site review, GameHouse.com:   The Lowdown  Gamehouse is not another gaming site.  No no...it's a site where you can play games, like Collapse, Text Twist, and others, right on your computer.  Unlike Yahoo, Gamehouse actually created the games that I just mentioned above, and it looks great.  They are one of the leaders in game creation on the whole wide interweb, and every game has a level of uniqueness to it.  They have a lot of word games, like Word Flip, WHATword, and Text Twist, as well as Collapse and other games.    The thing that I like about GameHouse, is that if you are a fan of the games that GameHouse makes, you can play them all, and find other games that they have made, that may not be featured on sites like games.yahoo.com or Uproar.  Plus, you can sign up for their newsletter and get a free "super game."   This site is awesome, and it's definitely a fun one for anyone who is looking for a good game to play online.     Pros  +More Games +Nice Design   Cons  -Some games do suck, despite the fact that its GameHouse.   Score  Fun Factor: 100%-A Graphics/Layout: 90%-A Speed: 90%-A Customization/Controls: 88%-A Final:  92%- A    Up Next: Today's Download of the Day, Xfire Messenger

       Well, here ya go, an all new version of bagel.tech for ya.  This is the official thing.  The new search function is now available, and allows you to search for stuff that I've posted without digging through the archives.  The search is updated at 6:00 p.m. every day, so you should be able to find everything.    By the way, how do you like the new skin?  I decided to go with something a little lighter on the graphics side, to avoid long loading times for our 56K users.  Hope you like it.  Tomorrow, I'm going to continue working on the site by tweaking some minor things.  Nothing else major is going to be worked on, however.  Most of the site's construction is officially done.    Beginning Monday, be ready for some sweet new posts.  I'm going to teach you how you can change the look of Windows XP, for those who didn't know, with the download of the day, Style XP.  Other stuff, I haven't thought of yet, but, you'll find out on Monday.  Anyway, look through the archives or do a search if you're looking for something, and be back Monday.

       This weekend I'll be making some adjustments to bagel.tech, including changing the template (possibly, not 100% sure yet), adding new features, and getting rid of the tagboard.  So, please ignore the construction work.  Also, the 1up.com review is being redone, and you will be able to see it on Monday for the Site of the Day.    Enjoy your bagel.tech, and check out Blog of Bagel all weekend for new stuff.

       Today's tip is how you skin Avant Browser.  Yes, I know, I promised a little more than that, but, I'm running out of time.  So, I'm going to take care of this before I leave.  So, here's how you do it.  It's really simple, and makes Avant Browser look even better.  1. In order to find skins for Avant, you're going to need to go to www.avantbrowser.com.  You can look for the skins there.  2. Once you find the one you want, you have to download it to the correct folder.  This depends on where you saved Avant Browser when you downloaded it.  3. Once its downloaded, go into Tools>Skins, and select your new skin.  See, that was quick, easy, and makes your browser look even better.   -------------------- Weekly Wrap Up- July 2, 2004  What a week, right?  We looked at some all new programs, such as ObjectDock, Avant Browser, Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Thunderbird, MyAlbum, and WinAmp.  All of these products (with the exception of MyAlbum), were outstanding, and definitely deserved to be looked at by you.   In sites, we took a look at GameRankings, GameSpot, 1up, IGN, and Gmail.  Everyone except for GameSpot got a decent review.  In games, we looked at Trivial Pursuit, WHAT Word, Family Feud, Collapse, and Go Bingo.  Again, everything was fine, except for Go Bingo, which I only recommend to people who love the game and want to play for Uproar.  And finally, this week, the bagel.tech Gmail Giveaway was announced, along with other daily features such as Mozilla Firefox tips, the first ever bagel.tech war, and an update on Spiderman 2, along with today's tip, how to skin Avant Browser.  The bagel.tech Gmail giveaway is coming soon, so be sure to keep checking back to see if its going to start.  That's all for this week.  Remember, if you're looking for something that is no longer on this page, it's in the archives, and now that we've started a new month, chances are that its probably in the June 2004 section.  Be sure to check out Blog of Bagel tonight for an all new Late Night Bloggin', where I will go and read other people's blogs, and then tell you about it!  And throughout the weekend, I'll have more stuff in there for you.  But, until Monday, adios!

        The Lowdown:  What Word has me hooked.  This game is one of the best, if not the best, word games I have seen on the internet, and really beats the crap out of Text Twist.  Your goal in this game is to form as many words as possible out of your set of letters (which is like 25, I think), including that WHAT Word(s), which have to be done in order for you to move on to the next round.    The game has a nice interface.  Its a green background, with the words you've found on the right, the WHAT Words you need to find below it, and the actual letter on the left.  It is so easy to use, and so much fun, too.  You can move any letter anywhere you want, so it's not like that classic 90s game Boggle, where you can only move something to the left, right, above, or below where it is now.  So, it makes the game a little bit easier, until you start forming words that you don't mean to.  But even then, it makes it even more fun because you are scrambling to get the same letters so you can form your WHAT Word.  On the negative side, there is one little problem, and that is time.  They give you too much of it.  They should narrow down the time just a little bit, because it makes the game incredibly easy, and we don't want too much of that.   urlLink    What Word? is a highly addicting game in which you can move letters around to form words. You have to form the WHAT Word(s) before you can move on though!&nbsp; urlLink     Overall, this is my favorite web game that I have reviewed so far, even better than ZUMA, which still holds the record as the best game.  I'm proud to give this game the score it receives.   Pros  +Nice interface +Easy to Play +Addicting!   Cons  -Too much time given to form the WHAT words.    Score  Fun Factor: 100% Graphics/Layout: 100% Speed: 98% Customization/Controls: 98% Final: 99%-A GOLD!    Up Next: Various tips for customizing your Avant Browser experience in today's feature of the day.  Plus, your weekly wrapup, all at 1:45.

        The Lowdown:  As you saw one week ago in the first bagel.tech Tip, Alternate Browsers, I gave Avant Browser a mini-review, comparing it to other browsers.  Now, it is today's download of the day, and also, today's tip.    The cool thing about Avant Browser is that it is a tabbed browser, with a powerful popup blocking device that will let pretty much NOTHING through.  Not as good as Mozilla's popup blocker on Firefox, but, it's still a lot better than getting a lot of popups.    The one thing I don't like about it is the fact that it can be so freakin' slow sometimes.  It runs on Internet Explorer technology, so you have to expect a little bit of slowdown, since it is not as powerful as Netscape's technology, for example.    Like I said, Avant Browser is a tabbed browser, and the tabs show up at the bottom of the screen, unlike Mozilla's, which go at the top.  I personally prefer them to be at the top, but, you can change them in Avant.  It has a nice interface, along with it, and downloadable skins are available, however, they don't look as good as Mozilla.  So, aside from being a little slow at times, Avant Browser is the perfect choice for anyone who is having problems with Internet Explorer, and, if you're running Mozilla Firefox, it is the best way to play games, since Mozilla requires you to download a special extension for games and things.   Pros  +Tabbed Browser +Pop Up Blocker +Nice interface   Cons  -Pop Ups may sneak through -Runs on Internet Explorer, so it is slow, unless you have a fast connection.   Score  Easy to Use: 85%-B Graphics/Layout: 90%-A Speed: 65%-D Customization/Controls: 75%-C Final:  79%-C    Up Next: What Word receives a high rating in today's game of the day, at 12:30.

        The Lowdown:  The final installment of our gaming site-themed week is GameSpot.  GameSpot has been around forever, and is owned by CNet.  At least for 4 years or so, GameSpot has been delivering reviews, previews, and all sorts of other stuff for videogames, and has always been right on top of everything happening in the videogame industry.  But, does that make them good?  Absolutely not.  The content on GameSpot is absolutely horrendous.  One example: the other day, I was reading their review of Spiderman 2, and they only gave it a 7.2.  Some suggest that the site is biased, or, at least, some of the editors and staff members are.  Others suggest that they just pretend to like games, and only give the good ratings to the big name franchises like Grand Theft Auto.    The design on GameSpot.com is actually really good, but, sometimes doesn't load correctly.  This is because it is such a heavy load of graphics, that it just doesn't look good.  Sometimes certain images will load, and sometimes others will.  It's just a matter of luck whether or not you're going to get the whole thing.   urlLink    GameSpot features a nice design, but it doesn't load right sometimes. This is the rare occasion when it does load right, however.&nbsp; urlLink     And, like I said above, the content is absolutely horrendous, and sometimes, you can't read it unless you pay something like $20 a year or something for their GameSpot Complete service.  IGN has this also, but, theirs seems to be a little more lenient.    After really browsing through the site a little bit, I feel disappointed in my review of 1up.com yesterday...I feel like I should have given it a higher score (check later on for that, I'm going to re-review it).  I absolutely hate GameSpot.  They give the crappiest reviews to good games like Spiderman 2, and then praise the Grand Theft Auto series to high heaven...which really isn't that good.  The one editor who does this should be fired in my opinion.  If they want this site to do any better, then they would fire that guy and others who have written some really smelly reviews.  Aside from the design being nice, and the cheat code database being pretty decent, GameSpot is a horrible site, and doesn't even deserve your attention.  So, I suggest either IGN or 1up.com.     Pros  +Sleek design +Nice cheats and demos and things   Cons  -Design doesn't load right sometimes -Content is horrible -Horrible staff members -Horrible Message boards -Not worth $20 for GameSpot Complete   Score  Content: 50%-F Graphics/Layout: 90%-A Speed: 55%-F Navigation: 65%-D Final:  65%-D    Up Next: Download of the Day- Avant Browser

       Well, here I am at last, after a long break, off doing things with my fellow yearbook buds.  Here's tonight's feature, WinAmp vs. jetAudio, in the first bagel.tech WAR.  Alright, in the past week, I have reviewed two different media players, WinAmp 5.1, and jetAudio.  Both players received a 4.5/5 on the old scale, so, we need to narrow it down to determine which of the two media players is the better one.  The main disadvantage of WinAmp is that it can be slow sometimes, compared to jetAudio.  The main disadvantage of jetAudio is that the skins aren't all that great.  Each of the players has other disadvantages, too, but, we're not going to get into that here.  We're just going to talk about their advantages.  On the positive side of WinAmp, its a highly open ended media player, with some of the most awesome customization options. On the positive side of jetAudio, you get all sorts of little gadgets and things, like a clock, alarm, and burning capabilities, and, you can use several different media formats.  Both WinAmp and jetAudio have web broadcasting programs (jetCast from jetAudio, Shoutcast from WinAmp).  The better one, to me, at least, is jetCast, because it is the more open ended, and easier to use program.  WinAmp is a great player, but, I think I have to stick by and say that jetAudio is the better, despite the skins looking kind of bad sometimes.   -------------------------- Daily Wrap Up- July 1st, 2004  Well, today was kind of split up due to my yearbook meeting, but now, we've gotten everything squared away.  Today was the beginning of the new rating system, and also, the cleaning of the monthly review archive.  Remember, to find something old, CHECK THE ARCHIVES.  And, also, be sure to check the archives when the bagel.tech Gmail Giveaway begins, because the codes will be hidden all over the place.  And, with that said, here is today's wrap up:  Today's site of the day was 1up.com.  This site recieved a C+ because there are problems with the content system, and some of the flashy thingys aren't supposed to work.  The new design is nice, but has its flaws, and the User Pages could be better looking, and could contain less of your personal information.  Again, the game received a C+.  Today's download was ObjectDock.  This program features an easier way to open programs than minimizing everything you're doing.  It's easy to use, and it looks great.  ObjectDock received an A+.  Today's game review was Go Bingo on Uproar.  This game was so bad, that it was saddening to even give a decent review.  It's a horrible game, however, you can play for iCoins.  Go Bingo received an F.  And finally, today's feature was the bagel.tech War: WinAmp vs. jetAudio.  Both players received a 4.5 out of 5, and were both great players, however, I do recommend jetAudio more than WinAmp.  Thats it for bagel.tech today.  Here's what to expect:   SITE: GameSpot DOWNLOAD: Avant Browser GAME: What Word TIP: Various tips in Avant Browser   See you tomorrow here on bagel.tech.  Until then, tonight's Blog of Bagel update is going to be later than normal, so you may not see it until tomorrow morning...where there will be another new one then, too.

        The Lowdown:  This has to be the stupidest game I think I have ever played.  Go Bingo is your basic online bingo game, and you have four cards.  Woo.  Where's the innovation in that?  I think they forgot it.  This is the worst thing that has ever happened to the history of Bingo.  So I'm going to keep this short.  You get four cards in Go Bingo.  Wow.  How amazing.  You can play for iCoins, which is probably the only perk in this game.  You win, you get iCoins.  Plain and simple.  But, that's all that's good about this.  It is, truly, a horrid, horrid game.  I'm not even going to continue.  It's saddening to talk about it.   Pros  +Play for iCoins    Cons  -Everything but the one pro.    Score  Fun Factor: 30%-F Graphics/Layout: 70%-C Speed: 80% Customization/Controls: 20% Final: 50%-F.

        The Lowdown:  If you're tired of having to go to the desktop to open something, there's a new solution called ObjectDock.  This program, from StarDock, is the best way to avoid minimizing everything to get to your desktop and open something up.  This one allows you to open it right on the spot from whatever window you're using.  Once you download this software, all you have to do, is wherever you position your Object Dock, place your mouse over that side of the screen, and your list of programs comes up.  You will need to add your programs, however, but, doing so takes a matter of 2 minutes.  It's really handy, because it also comes with a weather tool that is built right into the docklet, and you can customize it to give you your local weather.  Cool, right?  As far as customization goes, you can add anything...documents, folders, programs...anything you want, you can add it.  You can also change the color scheme to match your computer's theme, if you'd like.  It's also really easy to use.  Now, ObjectDock has its downsides, too, like most programs these days.  Sometimes, this thing will just crash, and you didn't do anything to cause it.  But, that seems to be the only minor flaw that I have seen so far.  I've used this program for about 2 or 3 months now, and its only crashed about 5 times, out of the hundreds that I have used it. And also, if you have it positioned to the right side of your screen, don't think about using the scroll bar, because its not going to let you. It's a really cool little program, and it's just the start of my new series of downloads, called "Customizing Windows."  Look for an installment of Customizing Windows, which will also include sites sometimes, every day for the next few days.  We'll give you reviews of products you can use to help you, which are free, and, which aren't.  So, stay tuned for that.   Pros  +Nice interface +Easy to use +Lots of Customization options +Easier and faster than minimizing everything to get back to your desktop.   Cons  -Crashes on occasion -Bothers you when you're in the middle of things.   Score  Fun Factor/Easy to Use?: 95%-A Graphics/Layout: 98%-A Speed: 92%-A Customization/Controls: 100%-A Final:  96.25-A    Up Next:  Bingo on Uproar as today's...unfortunately, Game of the Day.  Coming at 2:00.

        The Lowdown:  Yeah, I know, you're probably thinking, what are you doing the site of the day before the game and the download?  Well, it's simple.  New order.  The game of the day is now going to come right after the download of the day, and right before the daily feature.  But, lets get to it already.    Today's site of the day is 1up.com.  Ziff Davis, the creators of popular gaming publications such as EGM, GMR, and Xbox Nation, have put together a new site that comes in a flashy package.  The site just relaunched yesterday with a brand new look, and it looks great.  However, there are a couple minor problems that make this site not as great as IGN was yesterday.    The first of those problems being: The whole page doesn't load correctly.  The images aren't working half the time.  Hell, sometimes you may not even get any of the page.  I realize that they just launched this, but, if they want to keep going and have people coming to their site, they had better fix it.  Or else they may be in trouble.  1up offers some of the better reviews for console and PC games out there, and offers a smart organization of news and things.  You can also check magazine sites directly from 1up, and get a sampling of their reviews right there on the website.    This site also features a unique user page system, similar to IGN, which allows you to customize with a picture, your game collection, a wishlist, your favorites list, and much, much more.  But, the design for your collection and everything like that, is terrible.  Right next to the game's name is, in big letters, "Add to Faves," which makes it look really, really bad.    The site itself doesn't look bad when its fully loaded, but, like I said, if they don't fix the problem they're having, they will probably have to start it all over again.  It looks terrible right now, the way things don't load right.  Other than that, it looks good.    Now, I haven't found too many reviews on 1up in the past year that I have not agreed with, but, there are a few.  Not as many, as say, tomorrow's site of the day, GameSpot, but, there are a few.  With all these big websites, there tend to be editors who are biased towards one of the game consoles, and that's bad.  Really bad, because it gives the whole site a bad name.    So, aside from the content loading rather slow on occasions, and a few of the reviews being biased, 1up.com is the best place to go to get gaming news, and stuff of that matter.     urlLink    1up's new design looks good, but, some major issues about loading need to be addressed. Quickly.&nbsp; urlLink       Pros  +From the same people that brought you EGM +Nice User Page Interaction +Nice design   Cons  -Design does not load correctly -User page interaction looks bad -User page interaction requires you to put personal information on the page   Score  Fun Factor: 75%-C Graphics/Layout: 85%-B Speed: 55%-F Customization/Controls: 70% C Final:  71.25%-C    Up Next:  The Download of the day, ObjectDock.

         Welcome back to Digital Lust.  We're back with even more stuff for you to read, and it all kicks off today with my review of Top Spin.  But, before we get things going, here is how things are going to work from now on:      Monday- Videogames    Tuesday- Technology    Wednesday- MP3s    Thursday- Gadgets    Friday- Nothing    Saturday- Everything!      We won't have anything on Sunday, either.  So, get used to the new schedule, and hopefully I'll get used to it too.  Don't be surprised though, if something is out of line, because I'll occasionally mix things up.  So, since today is about videogames, I'll give my review of Top Spin for the Xbox.  So, here we go:   The Lowdown:  There have been some good tennis videogames, but none have lived up to Microsoft's new franchise, Top Spin.  That's right, Virtua Tennis fans, Top Spin is better than Virtua Tennis.  This is the best tennis game to ever be released, aside from maybe the original Pong game way back yonder in the 60's.  The cool thing about Top Spin is that customization can go anywhere.  You can create a player in the career mode, and customize it to how you want it, giving it the masteries in the skills you want, by training to make your serve better, etc.  The possibilities for creating characters are endless!   But, creating characters isn't the highlight of the game.  Graphics play a big part in the way that Top Spin dominates the tennis industry.  Even with the gameplay action zoomed out, this game looks incredible; better than any other entry in the 2003 XSN Sports Lineup, not to mention, of any tennis game of all time.  When you create a character, you can map distinguishing features onto your character, like how their skin looks, and your hair, and everything else, which is a cool addition, and during gameplay, you won't notice any kind of change from what you picked, because Top Spin is that cool.   Top Spin is compatible with Xbox Live and the new XSN (Xbox Sports Network) network; which allows you to play online, and check online for scores and rankings and stuff.  It's a really cool new feature, and Microsoft will go a long way with the new XSN system.  However, Microsoft is taking this year off from XSN to release bigger and better titles, like Halo 2, for example, so don't expect to see Top Spin 2005.  But, we'll hopefully see a new version next year.  Playing tennis couldn't be easier.  The game itself can be difficult, as your hands start to get tired during the middle of a tournament, forcing you to take a break, but, the control scheme of playing tennis is easy.  To serve, you just press A, let the meter go to wherever you want it to, and then press A again, and the ball will fly to the other side.  Or, you can risk by pressing L or R, and serving that way, but, that takes more practice in order to get it right.  Other than that, all you have to do is press A to hit the ball, and use the joystick to move around.   In a tournament, you have to win at least 2 out of 3 sets (you can change it to above 3 sets, I believe, but, no less than 3 sets per tournament round).  In each set, you have to win at least three breaks, depending on what your opponent has (there can be six breaks total in a set, but, that only happens if you and your opponent keep winning alternately).  Win two sets, and you're on your way to the next round of the tournament.  The bad thing about tournaments: you lose a match, you have to start the whole tournament over again; there's no save and restart where you lost, or anything like that.  If you lose the tournament, sorry, but, you'll be re-doing the whole thing.  But, other than that flaw, the tournament mode is awesome.  You can create your own custom tournaments in Top Spin.  I haven't tried this yet, but, if I can find some friends, I'll start some kind of tournament someday.  So, I'll let you know once I try this (and once I have friends, more importantly), and I'll let you know how this works.  The career mode is what really shines in this game.  You travel from country to country, competing in different tournaments, getting sponsors, learning new tricks, and doing all sorts of other things.  Hit start to go to the "Nexus," which allows you to see what is inside of your sports bag, and do all sorts of other things.  Easy to navigate, and not hard at all.   One major flaw that I've noticed with Top Spin is that I have gotten SO many disc errors since I bought the game.  I don't know if its my Xbox responding to the high quality of this game, or if its a disc problem itself that only I am having, but, I have gotten very many disc errors.  Don't be surprised if you get a few.   Even if you aren't a huge tennis fan, you're gonna love this one.  It is without doubt the best tennis game ever.  The control scheme is easy, the game is mildly difficult, the graphics look nice, and everything is good.  I definitely recommend this one to anyone, even if you're not a tennis fan.  It's fun, its easy to pick up, and an overall good game.  Give this one a shot .  Score:   Graphics:   95%-A   Gameplay:   92%-A   Sound:   90%-A   Replay Value:   100%-A   Final Score:  95%-A

      Family Guy is a classic.  It's coming back in 2005 for a supposed 39 new episodes, which is awesome, but, for now, I'm going to talk about the top 10 of my favorite episodes, similar to what I did with Rocko's Modern Life last night and this morning.  For now, here's #10-6, and tomorrow, I'll post the rest.    10. Peter Peter Caviar Eater What's funny about this one, is that Lois's aunt comes to visit her, and the second Lois opens the door when she arrives...she dies.  So, the Griffin Family inherits her large mansion with all of her stuff.  So, in musical form, Peter sings about how "this house is freakin' sweet."  But, not all remains good, because Peter makes enemies in the town, and sends them all straight back to Quahog.  9. There's Something About Paulie This one kind of integrates the "Quahog Mafia," as it can be called.  Peter trys to get Lois to buy a second car (which, ironically, is made completely out of cardboard).  It all ends with the mafia calling a hit on Lois, and they attend the leader's daughter's wedding, where he grants everyone he wants one wish.  Peter accidentally uses his wish, and has to convince them to call off the hit.  This one is classic.  8. Brian Does Hollywood Brian decides he's not wanted around, so he goes off to Hollywood to direct porn films.  What's not funny about that?  7. Road to Rhode Island Stewie and Brian try to get on a plane, and Stewie is trying to get on with a crapload of weapons, and makes a mention about Osama bin Laden.  This was edited in the American version due to 9/11.  6. Fifteen Minutes of Shame Meg is embarassed by her family, so she puts them all on a talk show.  The Griffin family becomes a reality show.  Meg can't stand it, so she moves in with the neighbors.  Then, a sexy blonde replaces her.  Then, the whole family realizes that it isn't right, and they also quit.  And that's it for tonight.  Be sure to check out tomorrow morning for the remainder of the top 10.  Until then, go sleep er something.

      This game is awesome.  I finally got it after the extra day's wait (thanks a lot, stupid EB), and it is the most awesome game I think I have ever played, aside from Halo and a couple others.  From the time I got the game, the box art just screamed "This game is going to be the best you've ever played."  So, I got home, popped it in my Xbox, and got going.  And I've been having a hard time stopping.  This game is that awesome.  Already, I'm 14.5% completed with it, and it's been good so far.  There is so much to do...so many awards to unlock, so many bosses to beat, and they're tough!  But, they're definitely worth it, because this has got to be the BEST super hero game, and I can't wait to get to the ending.  The game uses the actual voices of the characters in the movie.  Tobey Maguire plays his role of Spiderman, Kirsten Dunst plays her character of Mary Jane, and Alfred Molina plays his part as Doctor Octavius/Doc Ock.  I haven't come across Doc Ock yet, but I did get to meet Doctor Octavius.  I'm not sure if James Franco played Harry in the game or not, but, so far, it doesn't sound like it.  I dunno.  But, the voices in this game are great.  So far I've completed a ton of missions, and there's still more to come.  I haven't even began to think about what lies ahead, because I know that there is going to be so much.  The only gripe I have about the game so far is that the camera kind of strides off a little bit sometimes, and that's not cool.  But, oh well, I'm over it.    Well, that's all I have to say about that.  For now, at least.  Later tonight, I'm going to begin posting my favorite ten episodes of Family Guy, with 10-6 tonight, and 5-1 tomorrow.  So, until then, I gotta get back to this game.  Adios!

      Welcome to part 2 of my Rocko's Modern Life countdown.  Today I'll be posting the final 5 of my favorite 10 episodes of the show.  It's better than hearing about how bored I am, right?  Well, anyway.  Be sure to check out Blog of Bagel later tonight, for the start of my "Family Guy" top 10.  Yeah, I'm going to keep doing these countdowns of my favorite shows for the rest of the week, so get used to it.  But, anywho.  Let's get to it.  Here are my top 5 episodes of Rocko's Modern Life:  5. Leap Frogs In this episode, Mrs. Bighead feels that Ed doesn't want her around anymore, so she invites Rocko over to "have him do stuff for her."  Not sexually, of course, this is Nickelodeon we're talking about.  But, anyway.  When Ed comes home to seeing Rocko in a bath robe, he feels confused because he thinks that Bev is cheating on him...with a Wallaby!  This episode was pure classic, because Nickelodeon doesn't allow good stuff like this to air.    4. To Heck and Back This one introduced the character "Peaches," which is one of the funnier, but rarest characters in the show.  Heffer accidentally swallows a chicken bone and chokes, and goes to Heck.  This episode is funny because of the jokes directed at Heffer at how glutton-ish he is.  I love this one.  3. A Sucker for the Suck-o-Matic A vacuum cleaner that sucks up the whole world?  Sure, I'll go with that.  Rocko's vaccum cleaner goes dead on him while he is trying to clean, so he listens to an infomercial and buys the Suck-o-matic, which is a high powered vacuum cleaner that plans to take over the world.  This episode was pure genius.    2. Jet Scream This episode had Heffer getting on a plane for the first time, and he was scared.  So, after the flight goes unexpected and eventually crashes into the ground head first, everyone evacuates the plane quickly, and decides never to fly again, except Heffer, who goes down the evacuation shoot several times before giving up.  This episode is funny because it resembles the first time I ever went on a plane (the scared part, anyway), and Heffer's experience in First class made him enjoy the whole thing.  Rocko's expression during the flight was horrible, since he got one lousy peanut to eat, so he decides to take the bus to get to their destination.  1. Wacky Delly This episode was PURE genius.  Ralph Bighead decides to cancel The Fatheads (a parody of his parents) after so many seasons.  The network that he produces for is making him come up with a new cartoon.  So, when he goes to his parents house to announce that, he catches Heffer playing with deli meats.  Ralph, who wants out of the cartoon business, decides that the idea is stupid enough to work.  So he hires Heffer, Rocko, and Filburt to do the show for him.  Unfortunately for Ralph, the show is a huge success, and has become a phenomenon.  So, he does whatever possible to sabotage the show, and at the end, it works, and the show gets cancelled, leaving Bighead free to do whatever he wants.  Well, there ya have it, the top 10 episodes of Rocko's Modern Life, the best cartoon I ever saw as a kid.  Now I gotta get going to start my bagel.tech updates for the day, so until later on, adios!

      Yeah, we all remember the witty, genius creation that was Rocko's Modern Life.  It ran on Nickelodeon for 4 seasons, and lived a happy life while it lasted.  Tonight on Blog of Bagel, you'll learn my favorite 10 episodes of Rocko's Modern Life.  Each episode has a full description.  I've seen every single episode, and I've narrowed my favorites down to 10, even though it was a difficult task.  Here are the Blog of Bagel Top 10 for Rocko's Modern Life:  10. Keeping Up With the Bigheads & Skid Marks This was like, the third episode that ever came on, and it's a good one.  In Keeping Up With the Bigheads, Ed Bighead threatens Rocko, saying that he'll call the house inspector to have Rocko's house demolished, if he does not take care of his yard.  Both the outside of his house and his yard are a mess.  So Rocko and Heffer work together on home improvements, and by the time the home inspector comes, Rocko's new, well kept lawn tears apart Ed's yard, and the home inspector takes the Bigheads house away.  In Skid Marks, Rocko's gas cap gets stolen by a squirrel, and Rocko must go through driving school again.  Some people hear me say continuously, "When I go to get my license, I hope I don't get the fat guy."  Well, I pulled that from Rocko, since Rocko is constantly reminded not to get the fat guy.  This was a hilarious episode, and one that will never be forgotten by me.  9. Trash-o-Madness "Garbage Day is a very dangerous day."  How could we ever forget that line.  That quote comes from the pilot episode of Rocko's Modern Life.  It was the first appearance of the vile, furocious Earl the Dog.  The garbage rats finally get their licenses back, and it's garbage day.  Rocko looks around to realize his house is full of garbage, and the truck is right up the street.  So, he scrambles, and Earl the dog tries to attack Rocko.  It all ends in Spunky ending up as a..Chinese food box?  Long story.  This one is classic.    8. Cruisin' This 30-minute episode aired on New Year's Day, 1995.  Rocko and Heffer drop Grandpa Heffer off at the cruise terminal, for his Old Timer's Cruise.  Rocko and Heffer get stuck on the ship when it departs, and it becomes a wild ride.  A group of ducks is inconveniently sitting in the middle of the ocean (imagine that), and Rocko goes to the Captain's Quarters, and turns the ship right into the Bermuda Triangle, turning Rocko and Heffer old, and all the old timers into young people.    7. Bye Bye Birdie You have to admit, Nickelodeon was very mature with this show.  Bye Bye Birdie is the season premiere of season 3, and it has Rocko babysitting Filburt's bird, Turdy, while Filburt is away.  But, Heffer accidentally sits on the bird and kills it.    6. Ed is Dead: A Thiller! This one was the second episode of the Halloween special.  Bev is accused of "killing" Ed, but Ed wasn't even dead.  Hey, that ryhmes.  This episode was rarely seen, but, when it was, it was one of the classics.  The final 5 will be done in the morning, since I'm too damn tired to keep going tonight.  So, check back tomorrow morning before bagel.tech begins, and you'll get the other half.

      I must say that I have become obsessed with the idea of Gmail.  The whole 1GB thing has really given me a strong interest.  I've had it for over a day now, and it already is my favorite web-based email client.  And, because nobody bothers to email me, I'm just going to give out my new temporary Gmail account: shoxx5@gmail.com.  Eventually it will be thebagel05@gmail.com, but, I have to wait until I have my invites come in.  I send one to myself, and give the rest away as part of the bagel.tech giveaway.  So, for other stuff.  Here's what's been going on.  Hmmm.  Well.  This is interesting.  NOTHING!  Yep.  When I called EB today to make sure they were selling Spiderman 2, since today is the official release date, they told me that they weren't.  They said that they had them, but they would not sell them until tomorrow.  Even though the packaging clearly states, "DO NOT SELL UNTIL 6/29."  So, I have to wait until tomorrow to get that.  And it's going to be sometime around 11:00 tomorrow morning, so all of the bagel.tech updates are probably going to be moved to tomorrow night, depending on what time I go to get it.    So, with me not having anything to do today, I just kind of hanged around and watched some TV.  I have yet another headache (so its probably a good thing that I didn't go and get the game today), and I've been popping pills (Tylenol) since around 9 this morning.  I don't know why I keep getting them, but, they just keep coming and coming, and coming.    A few of you may remember me talking to you about dying my hair orange red.  Well, I haven't done it yet, but, I probably will tomorrow.  I think it would be a good change, others don't, but, I think it would be awesome.  I've been looking to do something different, and that just might be it.  But, we'll see.  Maybe it would be too different, but, I don't know yet.  Depends on my mood tomorrow.  Remember that show Rocko's Modern Life?  That show was the best!  Join me later tonight as I reminisce about my favorite 10 episodes of Rocko.  Since I haev nothing better to do, anyway.  Until then, bagel.tech has some sweet new updates today, and new information about the Gmail giveaway.  So go check that out, and my next post for the night will be sometime around 11 or 11:30.

      Well, I have to admit, I'm one of the biggest nerds around, but, not like DanCzar (and I don't know him), who claims to be the coolest nerd.  Well, I'm the nerd that has no life.  This new weekly column on Blog of Bagel is called Nerdular Nerdance, and goes past the nerdance that is bagel.tech, and into things that I do that are more nerdier.  This week's topic is Spiderman 2.  This movie is going to be huge, yes, and I am one of the several million Americans who are highly anticipating it.  But, when I was talking to Crandall last week, he said my Spiderman 2 buddy icon was "nerdy."  Well, let me tell you something, Crandall.  Of course its nerdy!  Look at who you were talking to when you said it!   My computer is decked out in Spiderman 2 backgrounds and stuff, but only until Wednesday.  After I see the movie, things will go back to normal, like they were before.  My Windows Login Screen is Spiderman 2 (thanks to something called StyleXP, which I'll be reviewing at bagel.tech later this week).  It's got an 800x600 version of the movie poster, with my username and stuff.  It's one of the best logins I have ever used, and its perfect for the Spiderman nerd.    Spiderman 2: The Game is coming out tomorrow, and you better believe that I'll be in line first to pick it up.  The game features open ended gameplay, similar to Grand Theft Auto, and has got some of the best visuals I have ever seen in a game.  I can't wait to have it, and it's going to be one of my favorite games of the year.  The movie.  This is the big one.  Closing out my Spiderman 2 hype for the year, is the big movie.  Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco have returned, and Doc Ock is the villain this time.  Now, I was never a Spiderman fan until the first movie, but, now, I've been dying to see this movie.  It's going to surpass the first, as far as surprises, suspense, and action.  Harry finds out that Spiderman is actually his good buddy Peter Parker.  Harry is especially upset because it was Peter who killed his father in the first movie (in the first movie, Harry's father, played by Willem DaFoe, was the Green Goblin).  So, in an upcoming movie, for sure, Harry will be the villain.  He's got to be.  So, now you know how much I've nerded out for Spiderman 2.  Tomorrow, be sure to check out bagel.tech for some brand new updates, including a special night time edition, where I'll go indepth with the Spiderman 2 game that I'm buying.  I may even have some screen caps of it.  Remember, the bagel.tech Gmail Giveaway is coming soon, so be sure to check bagel.tech so you can find out how to win.  I'm also going to post here tomorrow morning.    Tonight's Blog of Bagel update is brought to you by Sony Pictures, who paid me to say...I mean, the creators of Spiderman 2, in theaters June 30th!

      Howdy there!  Now, normally I'll go off and start talking about how bored I am, but, today, that's not the case!  That's right.  I've gotten something to do.  Today, I made about $100 doing that typing stuff, and I finally got my Gmail invite.  (But, I won't post the email address to it now.  I'm waiting until the bagel.tech Gmail Giveaway to do that).  So, even though I was on the computer all day, I still had a relatively good day.  Better than normal, anyway.  Tomorrow is the big day.  I get to go pick up Spiderman 2 for my GameCube tomorrow, and it's going to be one of the best games I have ever played.  I know its going to be.  One thing that I've seen in the screenshots of the game (find one at the bottom of this post), is that it closely resembles Grand Theft Auto for the Playstation 2.  But, before I get off on nerdy stuff like I do at bagel.tech, I'll talk about other stuff.  By tonight, I will have already reached 20 posts on this blog alone.  Its hard to believe its been that many already.  I've typed over 11,000 words (before this one), and its only been 2 weeks since I signed up.  I guess you could say that I have nothing to do, but, oh well.  I'm really liking this whole blog thing, because it allows me to express what's going on in my life...if there was anything.  Well, I'm going to go watch this "Torque" thing that my brother's friend is letting me watch.  I never got around to watching too much of it yesterday.  So, until my next post later tonight, go do something to keep yourself occupied.

      At long last, I've gotten so bored that I've had to write an absolute boredism post.  A couple things happened today, but, not enough to warrant anything. Here's how my day went:  7:30 a.m.- Woke up accidentally.  Couldn't fall back asleep. 8:00 a.m.- Mom comes in, tells me I got chores to do. 12:00 p.m.- Parents leave and go places. 1:00 p.m.- Alarms start going off.  So I shut them off. 1:10 p.m. - Alarms go off again.  What the fuck is goin on? 1:20 p.m.- Irritated with the fact that the alarms went off, yet again. 1:30 p.m.- Shut the whole freakin' system off. 2:00 p.m.- Started watching "Torque." 3:40 p.m.- Parents come home. 4:00 p.m.- Decide to get on the bike and go learn some tricks from a friend. 4:10 p.m.- Tylenol from my alarm-causing headache kicks in, start feeling tired.  (Tylenol makes me sleepy)  And now, I just woke up.  So, my day has been absolutely boring.  In fact, its so boring, that I really don't have anything going through my mind right now.    This week is going to be the most productive that I've had all week.  Tuesday, I have to go pick up the Spiderman 2 game, since I'm the biggest Spiderman nerd in the whole freakin' town of The River, maybe even Florida.  Then Wednesday, I'm going to Universal to see the movie, and get on Revenge of the Mummy.  That should be fun.  Thursday night, I've got my Yearbook meeting dinner thing, so I'll actually see some of my friends.  And, Friday, I'm going to play Spiderman 2: The Game for several hours.  So, it's my "week of the spider," and I can't wait until it all kicks in.    In about an hour, I get to drive to the mall.  Yippee.  My brother and his friend from Michigan (I finally figured out where my brother was the whole time he was gone, haha) are going to see a movie, and my dad has a bad back, so he told me that I'm going to drive them there.  I think my fear after last week's accident is gone.  After driving about 30 miles yesterday, I think I got over the whole stupid thing.  The car's fixed anyway, so I don't really have anything to be worried about.  I just realized today that I am one of the most boring people on the face of this planet.  I'm always in the confinements of my bedroom, either playing on the computer, some videogame, or watching a movie.  On occasion, I'll be out with my friends that live in my neighborhood.  One of them has a sweet motocross track, and I watch a couple of them moto...race.  Yeah.  But, aside from that, I have to be one of the most boring people.  That's gotta change sometime soon.  Anyway, I'm going to sign off for now.  I may update again later tonight, but, if I don't, be sure to check out bagel.tech tomorrow if you get bored!  Until next time, do anything to keep yourself entertained.

      I would have updated sooner, but, my connection was down due to a really bad storm that just swept through.  We took on a little bit of water, and had lightning that filled the whole house.  So, yeah, it was literally one hell of a storm.  Well, after that accident I had the other day, they've gotten me back on the road, and in Inglis, too.  I'm not as scared now, and I feel like I'm driving even better than I was before.  But, if you didn't see it before, I got hit in Inglis, in my mom's car, and it put a few little dents in the back end.  But, that's all fixed now, and I'm recovering from first time accident-itis.    So, anyway, my day has been so boring, that this post could actually be Absolute Boredism Vol. III, but, I didn't feel like it.  So, I didn't.   I watched a couple of my favorite movies before that storm blew through, particularly Anger Management and School of Rock.  I'd watch Pirates of the Caribbean tonight, but, I'm just too damn tired.  I gotta find something to do on Monday...I'm tired of just sitting around.  My bagel.tech posts are going to be earlier in the day, because I want to spend my afternoons doing something that is worth posting about on the blog.  I want to start taking pictures again.  Pretty soon, I'm going to start publishing some of my favorite pictures that I took from this past baseball season at my school.  I was the team photographer, and traveled with the team all year and took pictures at all the games.  I want to find something new to take pictures of, and show them to the world via Blogger.  This whole Hello thing is very interesting, and it will bring some awesome new ideas to me and this blog.  Expect more photo-based posts in the near future.  The countdown continues for Spiderman 2.  I still have plans to go to Universal on Wednesday to see the movie in a real, non-tented movie theater.  I'm picking up the videogame on Tuesday.  Expect a different format for bagel.tech then, because it's going to be all about Spiderman 2.    My speakers on my computer are broken, so now I gotta go look for new ones.  I'm not quite sure what exactly happened, but, they just cut out on me, and I couldn't watch anything on Shockwave.  Irritates me.  Well, I'm going to get off for the night.  I'm rather tired. I drove to Cedar Key, and it was very tiresome.  So, until tomorrow, be sure to sign the guestbook, leave some comments, or do whatever.  But, make it look like someone looks at this blog.

      Here are the promised pictures of my New York Trip from at Christmas:   urlLink    This one, of Times Square, is the best picture I think I've ever taken.  You can't see it here, but, at the top, they were working to get the crystal ball up for New Year's Eve.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    The Rockefeller Christmas Tree.  Probably the tallest freakin' Christmas tree in the whole world.  &nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    This is the area leading to Times Square.  I took this one from the StarDust Diner, which was one of the most unique restaurants I've ever been to.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Radio City Music Hall...didn't get to go inside, because there was something going on, but, the outside was cool enough.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Another view of Radio City Music Hall, all Christmas-ed up.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    The Empire State Building in all its night time glory.  Didn't get to go up because it was a 4 hour wait and it already was 8 at night, so, this is the only shot I have.&nbsp; urlLink     Well, there ya go.  I'll be back tonight with a new post, not sure what that'll be about yet, but, until then, you can check out bagel.tech for today's download of the day, which just happens to be Hello, and check out the other features that we have today.  Until next time, adios.

      Yep, I've kind of relaxed after a few hours of not blogging, and, now, here I am again, no longer spent.  Let me tell ya.  I'm addicted to this whole blogging thing, and now, I'm celebrating my 20th post for both of the blogs.  Yep, that's right.  It's been two weeks, and I've already gotten up to 20 posts.  It's an addiction.  No stopping it.  This is probably one of my favorite things to do online now.  Tomorrow, I'm going to be experimenting further with things by posting pictures from my trip to New York last Christmas.  There's only a couple pictures worth posting.  Since I'm going to run out of space on Village Photos soon, I'm going to give this "Hello" thing a try.  We'll see how it goes.  So, since my last post, I've pretty much just relaxed a bit, doing nothing, trying to recover from the first day of all of the bagel.tech stuff that I posted.  Remember, it's definitely worth checking out, because there are some pretty cool little computer tricks and links there.    Next week, I'll be seeing my yearbook croonies for the first time in about 3 weeks (except for Caitlin, who was in drivers ed with me).  It'll be interesting to see what's going on.  I've missed all of them.    Well, I'm going to get going for the night.  Today was probably one of the busiest and most unboring days I have had in a long time.  So, that's it, and be sure to check it out tomorrow for more stuff.

      Now that I’ve gotten the first day of bagel.tech all taken care of, I can finally settle down and update the more important blog, The Blog of the Bagel.  I put a lot of work into this place today, and I certainly hope it pays off.  I went through and edited a ton of HTML, and the sidebar has some sweet new features, like the chat box, the guest book, and a contact me section.  I couldn’t be prouder of myself.  And, if you detected sarcasm in that, congratulations, you receive one bagel point.  That point is redeemable for absolutely nothing.    So, last night, I walk into my bathroom, and I see something that I never expected to see in my life.  No, it wasn’t a toilet full of crap and stuff, you sick freak.  It was actually sitting on the edge of the bathtub.  It was a half-eaten, cream cheese-infested bagel.  And it made me think: who the hell eats a bagel in the bathtub?  Nobody that I know.  I wanted to get a picture of it, but it was 12:30 in the morning, shortly after I got done posting that last entry yesterday.  I was too tired to even go look for it.  I came back this morning to try and get a picture of it, but I couldn’t find it.  Weird?  Yeah, but, I do know for sure that I wasn’t dreaming.  There was a lump of cream cheese in its place when I went to look this morning.  Now, normally, I’ll go on and on about how bored I get, but that’s not the case today.  I actually had fun researching the information for today’s 4 bagel.tech posts, and I’m definitely looking forward to building a database of information on stuff to do online.  If you haven’t checked it out, today I looked at a game called Zuma, went to a site called Home Star Runner, played with an application called jetAudio, and gave readers an inside tip on how to pick the best web browser for your computer.  You can go to bagel.tech by clicking the bagel.tech link in the “bagel’s blogs” links section.  Now, on with today’s regular blogging features:   The Worst Pool Player Ever?  Yep, that probably describes me.  We have a pool table at my house, and one of my brother’s friends came over today, and my brother decided to sleep for a few hours, so I decided to play pool with this kid.  Now, this kid wasn’t that great at pool, but, let me tell you, I was worse.  It took me so many tries to even knock the balls into the pockets...I felt so dumb.  I only won 1 of the 4 games that we played.  Yep, guys, I lost to a 13 year old.  But, not to worry, because if he ever comes back, I’m going to get him twice as bad.   Playstation Breakage  Well, looks like my Playstation broke, yet again.  At least, I think it did.  It’s not loading discs right.  Now, the first time my PS2 broke, it was because my brother accidentally knocked it down the shelf, and we had to practically buy a brand new one.  So, I called Sony today, and they won’t fix it.   It’s an internal error, the disc I put in keeps giving me errors.  Now, if they want to keep a strong user base when the Playstation 3 comes out, then I suggest they get better customer service reps, because the one I talked to was nasty.  So I just hung up.  Maybe it’s just that one particular game, but, that just really irritates me that Sony isn’t nice.   Things are Speeding Up  For some reason, time is just flying by all of a sudden.  It feels like 2 hours ago that it was 12:30 in the morning when I encountered that bagel, but, no...it was actually so long ago.  These past couple of days have just flown by so quickly, that it seems like school is going to be starting even quicker and quicker.  Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing, I’m not sure, but, pretty soon I’m going to want things to slow down a bit.   Spiderman 2 Hype  The day is getting so much closer, and closer, and closer.  Wednesday, June 30th is the date that Spiderman 2 will be in theaters.  I’m still a little irritated about that commercial that I saw for it last week, the one that practically revealed most of the plot to me.  I didn’t want to know that Harry finds out who Spiderman is until I saw the movie.  I didn’t want to hear that Mary Jane was going to marry Jameson’s (the Daily Bugle guy) son, or whoever that was.  And I really didn’t want to know that Peter was going to give up being Spiderman for a time.  So, that whole thing ruined it, but, I’m trying NOT to let it get to me.  The movie is still going to be good.  Well, that’s it for tonight’s edition of The Blog of the Bagel.  I may update again later tonight, but, after all this blogging that I’ve done today, I’m spent (Haha Courtney, that’s your phrase).  So, if you don’t see me again tonight, be sure to vote in this week’s poll, which is conveniently located on the sidebar.  That will help tell me what I need to do to this blog to make it better.  Anyway, tomorrow is Saturday, so if you get bored, be sure to check out the bagel.tech posts, and then I’ll have an entry for here tomorrow night.  That’s so much blogging, but, hey, I’m really liking it.  Also, be sure to sign the guestbook, and if you want, you can use the chat box, but, I’m pretty sure I don’t have too many people stop by here anyway ;).  Until next time, keep blogging.

      Obviously, I'm having a hard time deciding whether or not to run two blogs, so, I'm going to give it a shot.  But, that's not all I did this morning...I completely edited the HTML to include a brand new message board, guestbook, and a poll, and more new features on the way.  Here's what's new:  -bagel's blogs: This is the link list to both blogs in the bagel's blogs network.  There's only two links right now, but, who knows, maybe there will be another one soon.  -bagel's blogs interactive: These new features include a weekly poll, the guestbook, and the message board.  All three of these features are available on both The Blog of the Bagel and Bagel.Tech, so even if you go to just one of the blogs, you can still see the same message board and polls.  -bagel.tech: This is the new blog.  Like promised, it will feature the internet stuff, so that you can maximize your computer experience.  Definitely worth checking out.  It's updated a few times a day with new stuff, so, be sure to check it out.  That's about it for this incredibly short edition of The Blog of the Bagel.  Tonight, I'll post something new, and it'll actually have meaning to it.  Until then, go look at bagel.tech.

      I've made a decision, and that decision comes to me because I don't feel like I want to run two blogs a day...so, I'm just going to merge it all into one.  Welcome to the new Blog of the Bagel.  Now, you're going to get two posts a day, one during the day, and one at night.  The daytime post will be dedicated to stuff you can do on the internet, and will feature all sorts of things related to it, including reviews, tips, and more.    The night time post will be the same posts that you normally get, the stories of my life.  These will continue to run every single night (except for when I'm out of town, but even then I may update).    I'm working on adding some brand new features to The Blog of the Bagel.  So, in the next few days, you may see some brand new interactive features.  Be sure to check them out.  Now, I need to get some sleep, because I have to begin writing my "BagelTech" post for tomorrow.

      Well, I couldn't think of anything to name this entry, so I'll just call it the No-Named Entry.  That is a name, isn't it?  Great, now I've just confused myself.  Alright, here's some valuable information for those of you who get bored on a daily basis:   -Bagel's Blog of Things to Do Online : I'm starting a brand new blog tomorrow, called Bagel's Blog of Things to Do Online.  This new blog will be all about the internet, and what you guys can see and do on it to minimize boredism time, so you don't end up like me and post "Absolute Boredism" posts on your blogs.  This new blog will not replace The Blog of the Bagel, but will be kind of like its lesser half.  It will contain links to cool sites, reviews of the best web games, and more.  It'll be updated every other day, while this blog will continue to be updated every day.  It will also feature a brand new design, and you should be able to find a link to it in my profile, but I'm not sure about that yet. ----------- So, what have I been up to today?  Well, aside from falling asleep for about 3 1/2 hours and just now waking up, I don't think too much has been going on.  I sat through and played Zuma for a few hours (get ready, that's my first review in the BBTDO), and I've just talked to people all day.  Not much fun there, right?  Oh well.  My driving days for drivers ed are quickly approaching, and once they do, I'll know that summer is nearing its last few weeks.  Not like I want school to start, but, this summer has just dragged on forever.  I feel like I've even been out of drivers ed for about a month already, and its only been a week.  Maybe its better that way, I don't know, but, I just need something to do.  So, if you start to see three or four entries here per day from me, then you'll know that boredism has absolutely struck me.  Maybe if I do that, I'll get my freakin' Gmail invitation that I'm dying to get.    Now, the one thing that will be coming up in the near future is new features to the Blog.  I'm looking for addons that will include something like a quote of the day or something.  This blog is somewhat boring now, and I just want to make it look a little better.  Don't expect a new look (this one is just fine for a while), but, do expect a couple new features to be coming to the blog soon.  For some reason, I'm still really tired, but, if I fall back asleep, then I'm going to be up all night again, and I really don't want that.  So, I'm going to try my hardest to stay awake, hopefully through dinner, and then go to sleep a little earlier than normal.    Still nothing for what day I'm going to Universal, but, it's going to be within the next two weeks, because my aunt is going to take us down there.  As you have undoubtedly heard, I am eagerly anticipating getting on Revenge of the Mummy, and even Shrek 4D, which I've only been on a couple times since it opened last year.  Now I've found out that its definitely Islands of Adventure that we're going to during yearbook camp, which is awesome because I haven't been there since we went there for camp last year.  (Unless you count Halloween Horror Nights, but, thats different).    Well, I'm going to sign off here for the night.  Hopefully, this being my 11th post, I'm getting close to my Gmail invite (I'm just dying to get one, now I can get bigger attachments and stuff).  Maybe by managing two blogs, it will make the situation better and I'll get my invite sooner.  Who knows?  Not me.  So, that's it for this edition of The Blog of the Bagel.  Remember to check this blog out tomorrow morning for an announcement and a link to the new Bagel's Blog of Things to Do Online.  Trust me, it will give you something to do if you're bored, and its definitely worth the read.  You'll find out stuff to do online that you'll never imagined.  Sorry guys, no porn links.  I don't want to get kicked off Blogger, I really like this blog tool.  So, until next time, later!

      Well, when I thought I'd be posting another Absolute Boredism post, I end up posting about my first car accident!  Yep, that's right.  About 1/2 hour after I posted my first post, I was out, and someone slammed into the back of my mom's new car while I was driving.  I was at a stop light, and the guy hit me.  Only a couple scratches and dings (it's a 2004 Nissan 350Z, for the record).  The guy's insurance is paying for it, and other than that, I think that's it.  So, I've spent the whole day sulking.  I'm scared to death to get back on the road.  I'm not even sure if I want to go to my driving days for drivers ed.  I'll end up going, but, I'm definitely a little less self-confident for driving.  I did fine on the interstate yesterday, but noooo...everything has to happen in Inglis (a couple months ago, the brakes on my parents Suburban, which they no longer have, broke, and had to be fixed...in Inglis).  So maybe I just won't drive in that town anymore.  There wasn't really anymore stuff to talk about, so...that's it.  Enjoy.

      Well, I didn't get around to making an entry yesterday.  I had to go pick up my brother from the airport, he came home from some other state (don't remember, haha), and now, my break from having him around is over.  So, I stayed home and did some work after I got back, and then fell asleep, and now, here I am.  Now, about this big download.  I swear, if my satellite connection shuts down while I'm in the middle of this, I'll personally go up to the roof, knock it down, and go beg for DSL or something.  I'm downloading America's Army, which is one of the only good free games.  The army uses it as a training tool for new members in the army, but, its also available for anyone else who wants to play a good game.  I've heard nothing but good remarks on it, so I figured I'd give it a shot.  It's 745 megabytes, and it's been downloading for about 2 hours now, and its gotten about 70 done now.  I swear, that satellite shuts off, it can expect to find itself in the river.    And More?  Well, let me think about what I can put for the "And more" section of the title...hmmm. Here's something.  I've been dying to get a G-MAIL (hint to those at Blogger, who are owned by Google) account, and hopefully I'll get an invite out of Blogger soon.  G-mail gives you 1 gb of space, so you'll never have to erase your email messages again.  It's ideal for bigger attachments, and it's got a much better interface than Hotmail and Yahoo.  Hopefully I'll get some sort of invite from someone soon.  Alright, so, as some have noticed, I've taken more of an interest in baseball lately (after working with the baseball team for the past few months, upping up my photography skills).  So, I've been thinking about what baseball game to buy, and I think I made a decision between either MLB Slugfest Loaded or MVP Baseball 2004.  It's going to be on Xbox, either way, since it has the best graphics, and the best controller (in my opinion, anyway), and I'll get it before I leave for the summer workshop, just in case anyone else is interested in playing.  I need to get a new controller though, the stupid dog ate mine.  So, with Spiderman 2 (gotta buy it), MVP Baseball 2004, and a new controller, I'm going to blow through about $150 in the next month or so.  Spiderman 2 is going to be first though.  I'm getting that next week.  Enough about games and computers and stuff, what am I doing this week?  Well, hopefully on Saturday or Sunday I'll be going to Universal or something.  I'm just dying to get on Revenge of the Mummy.  I've heard that for the most part, it's an awesome ride.  Today, I'm probably just going to lounge around, doing nothing, and I'll probably have a new edition of Absolute Boredism tonight, if things go the way I don't want them to.  Heh, it'll only be about a week or two before I'll have Absolute Boredism Vol. X, if this keeps up.  Anyway, I'm going to go try and keep myself entertained (Gran Turismo, probably), so, until next time, don't be like me, go find something to do.

      Since I have absolutely nothing to write about tonight, and I don't feel like putting out a brand new Absolute Boredism edition, I'm going to talk about the movies that I feel are worth seeing this summer:   Shrek 2:  If you haven't seen this one yet, you've missed out on an outstanding movie.  This one is definitely one of the better animated movies ever.  New cast members like Antonio Banderas (as the hilarious Puss in Boots) and John Cleese (the king) make this movie even better than the original.     The Chronicles of Riddick:  Wow, this one was good.  Even though Vin Diesel is one of the worst actors in the world, he actually did pretty good with his role in The Chronicles of Riddick.  The game, too, is supposed to be very good, and it boasts Xbox Live play.  The movie, however, is the sequel to Pitch Black, and if you're into action gun-containing movies, this one is for you.   Spiderman 2:  I've been waiting since May 3, 2002 to see this one, and it's going to be awesome.  The surprises that are in store for me in Spiderman 2 are going to come very shockingly, as I refuse to look up anything about the movie, aside from who's in it and when its coming out.  I'm expecting this one to be my favorite movie of all time...at least until Spiderman 3 comes out.   The Day After Tomorrow:  I looked at so many previews for this one before going and seeing it, and I must admit, it was better than I thought it would be.  The director must really like destruction and chaos, because he's also the fool who did Independence Day back in 199-something.    And enough about movies, here's some other stuff that I've checked lately:  -Satellite Radio: So, my parents decided to get one of these for the car, and it's awesome.  Yeah, you can lose reception in a place like Tampa, but, overall, satellite radio is awesome, and for only $10 a month, it beats out regular radio.  No commercials, better stations (so you can listen to what you want to), and much better quality.  Well, that's about it.  I'll post something new tomorrow, unfortunately, my brother is coming home, and that's going to suck.  Majorly.  Until next time, adios!

      Well, as it turns out, my summer may not be as boring in the coming weeks.  Aside from the fact that I'm going to be working for my mom for the next three weeks, I have something to do other than sit on the computer like a loser!  Here's my outline for the rest of the summer:  -Working: So I lied.  I do have to sit at my computer like a loser, but for good reasons.  My mom is going to have me start typing things for her for her transcription business.  I'm gonna get paid just like her normal employees do, which is pretty good pay.  Should make me enough money.  -Tuesday: Unfortunately, my brother is coming home, after a long two week siesta from not having him around.  That's the bad news.  The good news is I get to sit at the airport for 3 hours waiting for him!  Wait...that's not good news.  At all, actually.  But I do get to drive there.  -My driving days: July 12-13 are my driving days for drivers ed.  Yeah, should be boring, but, at least I won't be sitting around my computer like a loser.  -Yearbook Camp: July 19-22 is yearbook camp.  That'll probably end up being the highlight of my summer, but, we'll see how that turns out.    -New York: Yep, I'm heading up north, and for the first time in a long time, we're driving up there.  We're making pit stops at the Paramount Carowinds theme park, which is similar to Universal, but, with more Paramount.  While we're in New York, we're going to drive to Buffalo and go to Six Flags Darien Lake, which is something that I've always wanted to do.  I'll be gone from July 23rd until August 2nd, which will get me home with enough time to get ready for the beginning of my last year in high school.  So, with me working and getting money and stuff, I should have a slightly more interesting summer.  I can't wait to see the Paramount theme park, I heard it was pretty good.  Too bad I'm not going to the Canadian version...they have Tomb Raider: The Ride.  So anyway, now that I know what I'm going to be doing, I'm not bored now.  In fact, I'm also going to Universal next week (I think), but I'm not 100% sure of that yet.

      Well, I definitely wasn't expecting to be writing another edition of my bored column this quickly.  You know what?  I preferred being in Driver's Ed.  I was around people I knew there.  Now, I've just got nothing to do, and nobody is online (when I'm sitting at the computer, at least).  So, before I go into things that have crossed my mind, I'll go through what I've tried to do today:   Failed Attempts at Keeping Myself Entertained:  -Movies: If only a good movie was on T.V., I wouldn't be watching the same DVDs that I watch on a regular basis.  I watched School of Rock, Spiderman, and Pirates of the Caribbean today, but, it was incredibly boring.    -TV: NOTHING is on T.V.  So that was a failure.  -Reading: Yes, I actually do read once in a while.  I started to read the first book in the Left Behind series.  Fell asleep.  -Games: Tried turning on my Xbox.  Rallisport Challenge just doesn't seem to have the same effect on me as it used to.  So, as you can tell, it was a very boring day, and I think I would rather sit and count Mr. Murray's "You got thats," but, class is over.  And I thought it would be a good thing, but now I'm just bored sick.  It's too hot to go to Universal or anything, so I'm not going to.    So...what's been going through my mind today, aside from being completely bored to death?   Alex and the Weirdo:  I must admit, I left drivers ed yesterday with a positive thought, and that was Alex faking an argument with that kid I don't like that sat behind me.  The situation goes something like this.  The kid (who shall be referred to as J.J. here), ALWAYS has his sunglasses on.  Yesterday, he left them on his desk when he went to talk to the teacher, and Alex grabbed them and put them in his sweatshirt pocket thingy.  Then, I started cracking up (because I ruin everything, and I admit that), and J.J. was like "alright, where are they?"  Well, I had moved his bookbag so that Alex could throw the sunglasses in there, and then J.J. got the bookbag, then started accusing me and Alex of taking his sunglasses.  Alex "went off" on him (acting it, of course), calling him a jackass and stuff.  It was definitely one of the funnier moments of the class.  Until Caitlin yelled at me for it.  Then it wasn't funny any more.   Spiderman 2:  I'm really mad.  I was watching TV a few nights ago, and I saw a preview for Spiderman 2, and it COMPLETELY ruined parts of the movie that I didn't want to hear about until I saw the movie.  Even so, the movie is still going to be filled of surprises.  Which is good, because I haven't been looking forward to a movie like Spiderman 2 since the first one.     The Chronicles of Riddick:  I didn't know Vin Diesel had the capability of being a good actor.  Anyway, this is the sequel to Pitch Black, and boy, did it turn out good.  I went and saw it last weekend in Ocala, and it was awesome.  Now, I just want to try the videogame (because I've still got some nerdism in me), because it's supposed to be even better than the movie.     Senior Pictures:  Appears like I won't be having my senior pictures taken until August, because my driving days for drivers ed are the same days. Oh well.  Maybe I'll have time for that dramatic change I've been dyinf for.  So, anyway, that's pretty much all that's going through my mind right now.  Hopefully I won't have to write another "Absolute Boredism" post for at least a week, but, we'll see.  Until I post again, go away.

      You know, I've been out of school for about 3 weeks now, but, it feels like its been an eternity.  Not that I want school to start or anything, but, it has gone by so slow that I have run out of things to do.  Drivers Ed is over, so I don't have to waste my time on that anymore, but, at the same time, I have nothing to waste my time on, except maybe to sit at my computer all day like a loser.    But, anyway, I found out my whole schedule yesterday. There was a conflict with my yearbook scheduling, and they had me scheduled for first period yearbook.  Definitely not happening.  So, me and the registrar at the school worked it out so that I would be in yearbook with everyone else, and we ended up flopping pretty much my entire schedule.  Not really a problem, I like it better the way it is now.  At least I'll get to leave CRHS with a full blown Mr. Teter experience!    I'm finally feeling not-sick now.  Maybe it was just one of those 48-hour things, or maybe its not gone, just giving me a little break.  I don't know.  But I feel a little bit better today.  I need to go to Universal sometime soon.  It's been such a long time since I've gone, and I need to get down there.  Especially since Revenge of the Mummy is now open.  I've been looking forward to that ride ever since I first heard about it a couple years ago.  It's going to be pretty interesting, and I can't wait to get on it.    Well, its only 7:30, and I'm already up, and I don't want to be.  But I can't fall back asleep, so I might as well just stay by my computer and be bored all day.  If you're lucky, I'll probably update again tonight, but, we'll see.

      You know what I really hate about life?  One minute, you could be perfectly okay, nothing wrong in the world, and then the next, you're sick as a dog.  That's what happened to me yesterday.  I was feeling fine until about 10:00 last night, and then all of a sudden, I just started feeling sick.  Turns out, I caught a stupid, spooty cold.  And its summer break, too, which makes it worse, because I hate being sick during my breaks.  Drivers Ed sucked today, having to go in there, sniffling.  During a test, people were getting annoyed.  I wish they'd get sick.  Just so they feel my pain.  Yes, that was mean, but, oh well.  Anyway, aside from them getting annoyed by me, drivers ed still sucked today.  The "you got thats" soared to a new level today, and every other word out of the teacher's mouth was "you," "got," or "that," normally in that particular order, within one second of each other.  I didn't bother counting, because I knew that it was well over 100 times that he said it.  Oh well.  Tomorrow is the last day of class, so, I'm not gonna let it get to me.  We're working on these project things, where we have to map out a 2000 mile trip.  Well, between me, Alex, and Caitlin, we managed to create about a 5,000 mile or so trip out to California.  Now I just have to type up the oral report, and we'll be all set.    Well, I need to go to sleep for about an hour before I type up that report.  Until next time, go bother someone else's blog.

      I get bored really easily, and when I do, I feel the urge to write everything that I think about.  So, here are my random thoughts and ideas for the day:  -The WB Superstar USA: As I sit here and watch the season finale of The WB Superstar USA, I think, what the crap was the WB thinking?  Alright, first of all, the judges look shockingly similar to the judges of American Idol- The White guy is mean, the chick is the inspirational one, and the black guy is honest, but, not 100% of the time. The host, doesn't he look similar to Ryan Seacrest, the host of American Idol?  Yes, yes he does.  But why did they do this?  Well, one simple thing: they went around auditioning for "the best singer in America," but, the catch: they were actually looking for the worst.  So they made it just like American Idol, right down to the format and feel of the show, judges included.  Well, now, on the finale tonight, they're going to reveal that they were looking for the worst singers in America, and one will be crowned just that.  Will it be back for another season?  No, probably not.  It's hard to pull off something like this twice.   -Drivers Ed.: Absolutely boring me to death.  Yeah, like I said the other day, there's some of my friends in there that try to keep me entertained, but, most of the stuff in that class is so obvious.  I just wish I could get As on more of the tests!  But, aside from being bored, there's also some annoyances.  There's two people in particular that are really getting on my nerves.  One sits around me, and the other sits on the other side of the room.  The one that sits around me, I barely even know this person, and he acts like we're the best of friends or something.    -Universal: I haven't been to Universal in such a long time, I think I need to stop one day soon.  My trip up north was postponed until the end of July, because my parents sold my old house finally, and we have to get stuff out of it before they close.  So, I think I'm gonna try and go some time next week.  The new Mummy ride is supposed to be awesome, and I can't wait to get on it.    Well, that's pretty much all that's going through my mind right now.  There's something that's bothering me, but, I'll discuss that in a later post.  Until next time, adios!

      Hi, I'm David, and welcome to The Blog of the Bagel.  I've tried to have so many blogs before, but, I was using the Xanga software, and I didn't like it that much.  What I like about Blogger is the fact that the templates look so much better, and its easier to use.    Anyway, before I continue to talk about that sounding like the world's biggest computer nerd, you may be wondering.  Bagel?  What the crap!?  Alright, my last name (Weigle), and Bagel rhyme, and, up until now, I've hated being called Bagel.  But, now, I've kind of opened up to the fact that its actually not bad of a nickname.  So I'm just gonna go with it from here on out.    Anyway, its summer break, and boy, I couldn't be more bored.  I'm stuck taking drivers ed last week and this week, with a teacher who couldn't be more annoying if he didn't say "you got that" a hundred times a day.  It's cool though, some of my friends are in there, so it reduces the amount of boredism that comes with being in that class.  We take two tests a day in there, and we move at a really fast pace, which is something I'm not used to.  After I get done here, I'm going to be traveling around the country for two weeks, after I make a quick pit stop to Universal Studios to check out Revenge of the Mummy (which is hopefully going to be this Friday).    A little more about me: I'm 16, almost 17, and I'm going into my senior year in high school.  It's really hard to believe that the past 13 years have gone by so fast, especially after moving around so much.  In the past 13 years, I have been in 5 different places, and, oddly enough, I've stayed here in The River for the second longest, after I half expected to be here for about a year or so and then move again.  I plan to major in journalism in college, possibly minor in teaching, just in case I decide to become an English teacher or something.  And, of course, my hobbies include videogames, photography, and computers.  Yes, I am a nerd, and I'll just go ahead and admit it.  Alright, that's enough for my introduction post.  I will try to update this thing here about twice a week, starting this week, except for when I'm out of town, because, those two painful weeks I will probably be computer-less.  Oh well.    -David-

      Alright, as promised, here are more pictures and stories from Camp Orlando, the workshop that owned us all. I'll have a final review of the camp and how it compared to the past two years. So, here we go.    urlLink    Eh...what? Melissa and Alex were wrestling, and the door was opened...this is where Melissa's mom walked in. Melissa jumped on top of him.  urlLink        urlLink    They continue to fight.  urlLink        urlLink    There goes Jarrod on the floor during Jonny and Jarrod's pillow fight.  urlLink       urlLink    Wooo...way to go Alex! Or not. What's Courtney going to do next?  urlLink      urlLink    She attacked him.  urlLink      urlLink    Melissa M. did this to me. I didn't realize the camera was in my face until about 1/2 a second before the flash went off. Gave me just enough time to try some kind of smile thing.  urlLink      urlLink    There's me and Adam. Neither of us were ready for any kind of picture.   urlLink      urlLink    Jonny (left) and Jarrod (right) continue their pillow fight.   urlLink      urlLink    Eh, Caitlin...what exactly are you doing?!  urlLink      urlLink    Oh. THAT. That's very interesting, Caitlin.  urlLink      urlLink    There. The finished product. Good job Caitlin.  urlLink      urlLink    WOW, that's cool! The bathrooms at TGI Fridays in Orlando had those sensor activated paper towel dispensers. Here, Alex and Jonny play with it.  urlLink      That's all the pics for now.  There's a few others, but, nobody is going to see them until I come back from the New York state.  I just can't keep going with it for now.  So, here's the rest of the stories from Camp Orlando that will wrap up this month's Nerdular Nerdance report.     Story: Universal Studios   This one isn't intended to be funny, for the most part, but, hey, it's good enough and worth telling.  Alright.  Tuesday night we had our "Team Time," where we could go off the hotel site and go to a theme park or whatever.  So, we all chose to go to Islands of Adventure.  But, Alex was feeling like going to Universal Studios, as was Lauren.  So, I went along with them.  We got on Revenge of the Mummy, the new ride in the park, and that was awesome.  They call it a "psychological thrill ride," and it was part roller coaster, part like the Spiderman ride at Islands of Adventure.  It was a bit on the short side, but, it was awesome.  We were also able to get on Back to the Future, E.T. (we all laughed at that one, even though I'm sorta scared of moving puppets).  We also got on Men in Black and Terminator 2.  We would have gotten on Earthquake, Jaws, and probably Shrek 4-D, but, the lines were insane, even when the park was getting close to closing time.  We really only had 4 hours, so oh well.  I think we probably had more fun than the other guys did.  I just don't like being with huge groups of people like that.  Not to mention, I couldn't just leave Alex and Lauren to go to Universal by themselves... they'd kill each other.  We had fun, and if we could have gotten on Mummy again, I would have, because it was just that awesome.  Getting out of the parking garage at the end took forever.  Some person somehow got his Beetle onto a curb and hit a palm tree, and traffic was backed up for a while.  Not to mention there were people in the parking garage that obviously didn't know how to drive in traffic situations, which made it even longer.     Jonny and Jarrod         These two are hilarious.  Together, they make this absolutely hilarious duo that make you want to laugh nonstop.  Jarrod is this odd, crazy fellow who likes jumping between beds like a salmon on its spawning spree.  His belching gave a whole new meaning to the word belch.  He takes his tongue and moves it around when he burps, giving it this weird, hilarious sound.  He'll do anything to make something funny...which is probably how the security guard ended up in our room.  Jonny is a second year staffer this year, and he'll be the sports editor.  His twisted sense of humor made us laugh for a really long time.  These two together are the funniest guys in our school, at least that I know of.  They deserve an award!      The Skit      The schools had the opportunity to participate in a skit contest in order to win money for new Yearbook equipment.  Last year, we decided not to do it, but, this year, however, it was different.  This year's workshop theme was "Hats Off to a Great Year."  All of the workshop instructors came up with these weird hats on the first day, and they announced the contest.  We had to create a hat that resembled our school's yearbook staff.  We came up with a parody of Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  They had me tripping all the time (why me?), and they had all sorts of funny things.  Did we win?  No.  A school that sang "The Wheels on the Bus" with a hat on won.  And that skit was officially lame.  But ours...ours was awesome!    I'm sure there are more stories, but, I can't think of them at the moment.  So, if Alex or someone reminds me of something, I'll definitely post it.  Overall, this year's camp probably was better than last year's, but, I think I overhyped it a little bit.  The hotel was pretty cool, but Housekeeping and the complaints from our neighbors were really annoying.  A couple of the new staff members (no Alex, it wasn't you, it was a specific girl) got on my nerves a lot.  Even ADAM prank called my phone like 25 times last night, and I just found out about it this afternoon.  Camp Orlando was awesome this year.  I just wish I wasn't in such a bad mood for half the time.  I would have enjoyed it more if I wasn't in that mood.  But, oh well.  It was fun anyway.    That concludes my Blogging experience for a while.  I'll be back on August 3rd for more action.  This fall is going to be completely different, because I'm going to be working on changing my image, because it's going to absolutely shatter once my brother gets to the school.  I'll have some help from my friends, and we're going to make it work.  But, people will definitely be seeing a new me this fall.  For one, I'm not going to be a pushover anymore.  It's not the path I want to take.  Second, I've gotta get fatter.  I'm going to set up my own workout routine and stick with it so that I can gain some weight, because I'm just too damn skinny.  And, I'm also going to find a girlfriend, get a job, and not be tied up with my computer so much.  Yep.  I want to change.  This lifestyle that I'm living now is just pathetic.      Well, I'm leaving for the New York state EARLY tomorrow morning, so there will more than likely NOT be any entry.  So, I'm going to go up north and refresh, because once I get back, things are going to be much, much different.  To all my friends in the River, enjoy the rest of your summer.  To everyone else, continue with your every day lives.  And that's it from me.  See you guys on or after August 3rd.  Bye.

      Here's the first pictures from this year's Camp Orlando event. And, then, after the pictures, how about a couple more stories? Sure. This time, I'll talk about my sleep talking, and then some other stuff that's just going to come out.   urlLink    Lauren and me. Lauren is my co-editor for the Student Life section (obviously, she's on the left). Don't expect her smile to stay all year though...we'll be down each others throats every day this year!  urlLink       urlLink    Me and Alex. Before Lauren and Alex started fighting at Universal (and I knew they would eventually), she took a pic of us.  urlLink          urlLink    The world famous Universal globe. Took this picture so that I would have something to do with my Photoshop class.  urlLink      urlLink    Lauren and Alex. At Universal, they took this picture...right before they started fighting.   urlLink      Now for a quick break before I start posting more pictures.  There's quite a few more that I'm going to post.  So, here's a couple stories from camp:    David the Sleeptalker:  Guess so.  Tuesday night at around 12:30 in the morning, the other guys (minus Adam who was asleep already) were talking about who was hot in their class.  Well, I had dozed off, and I woke up about an hour later muttering something about who was hot, and they all just kinda started staring at me, wondering what I was talking about.  Apparently, I was only muttering, and not saying any words (except for one, basically, and it was someone's name).  So, I don't know what happened, I had only done that a couple times before in the past, and it was a long time ago.  But, I wasn't the only one in Camp Orlando that did that.  Someone in my class had done it the same night that I had.  I guess it just happens to some people sometimes.    Aye, The Luck of the People Next to the Irish Dude:  I may have mentioned the whole security guard thing earlier, where the Irish Dude next door to us had kept complaining.  Here's the whole story.  Monday night, we were all bouncing around the beds (Jarrod and Jonny, is what I mean by "we"), and Mrs. Yearbook Advisor comes in to tell us that we have to be in our rooms.  The Irish dude next door came out and said that we were too loud (Mrs. Yearbook Advisor, specifically, which is just weird).  So, the next two nights progress, and then, last night, possibly when I was sitting there biting everyone's heads off for doing something bad, they called and complained again.  That's when the security guard came through.  Possibly, we should have complained about him, because we weren't  that  loud at all, and at 1:30 in the morning one night, he started slamming doors.  In fact, I thought we were pretty quiet for having 5 teenage guys in the same room.      I'll be back in a while with more pictures.  Until then, enjoy what you got.  See ya.

      Well, I'm back from yearbook camp, and it went alright.  I definitely think that 2003 camp was better than this year's, but, many things were better this year.  Nothing against the other guys in my room, because it wasn't them that caused it, at least, most of the time. I feel crushed after something that happened, and I'm just not liking how that goes.  And everything that has happened since has kept me in that bad mood.  Nonetheless, I have come back with new pictures, and, no, I didn't get to Audioblog at all, but, oh well.  I was too busy.  So, here are a couple stories from this year's camp:    2004 Class: Desktop 5  This was the best class that I had taken in my three years of going to yearbook camp.  The teacher was the head of computer support at the Walsworth Publishing Company, and he was pretty cool.  He smoked though, which was bad, but, we got over it.  I learned A LOT of new Photoshop stuff, and I'm going to be teaching it here in a few weeks, promptly after school starts in August.  Everything is on Mrs. Yearbook Advisor's laptop, so I don't have access to it until I get back to school.  The people in the class were awesome...I kinda liked one of them, but was too tied up liking someone else on my yearbook staff to even worry about anything.  But, the class went extremely well, and I think me and Melissa were the only ones who ended up NOT complaining about a class at all, since everyone else was bored to death.  One girl even had to stay up until 6:00 in the morning doing her homework (which she shouldn't have done, but she made the decision to).  So, my class was awesome.  Nothing wrong with it.    Camp Story: The Irish Dude and the Security Guard  Alright, the whole room situation was kind of annoying this year.  The guy next door to our room complained about everything, which practically forced me into a complaining mode.  The first night, he yelled at Mrs. Yearbook Advisor for checking up on us, and that was the beginning of it.  And, last night at 11:30, a security guard comes up to our room and says that "they are getting 'extreme complaints' about our room, and that if they got one more, they were going to 'evacuate us from the room.'"  We weren't really being all that loud when he came through.  In fact, it really wasn't us.  The girls that kept coming in the room were really loud.  And the door was broken, so no matter what, it always slammed shut.  Adam even yelled at him, telling him to try closing the door without making noise.  The Irish guy was constantly made fun of by us.  We should have annoyed him as we left this morning.  Because that just pissed me off last night.    I'll be back in half an hour with the first of the pictures.  They include Alex and Courtney wrestling, Alex and Melissa H. wrestling, and more things that interested me the whole trip.  See ya.

      I'm in a good mood this morning.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because Yearbook Camp awaits.&nbsp; The next four days are going to be spent rejuvinating after a long, boring summer, with friends and a lot of interesting things.&nbsp; I am making a solumn promise here that Blog of Bagel will NOT be closed whilest I am on this school trip.&nbsp; I may be saying Adios, but, truth is, you'll be hearing a lot more from me this week than you will when I'm up in the New York state.&nbsp; I'll be posting through Audio Blogger for the next few days, so rest assured, you haven't seen the last of me.&nbsp; For now, at any rate.&nbsp; I promise that I will come back with pictures aplenty, of both me (that's right, me, I'm giving in), and everyone else that matters in my life (and 90% of those people are on yearbook staff, anyway).&nbsp;  &nbsp; There won't be any Late Night Bloggin' whilest I'm away, since I will not have access to a computer.&nbsp; There won't be any Absolute Boredism, because my days of being bored are over.&nbsp; But, there will be something called "Hidden Cellphone," where I'm going to let my cellphone go off and let anyone who says stuff be recorded onto the blog.&nbsp; And when I return, there's going to be camp stories and pictures, so that my blog is filled to capacity with high quality, 5.0 megapixel (thanks to my digital camera) pictures, videos, etc.&nbsp; Whatever I can find to put on here, it's going to happen.&nbsp; My Moblog is all set up for the overload of pictures that's going to come in with Yearbook Camp.&nbsp; I'll come back on Thursday, get set up, get things posted, and then, say goodbye again because I'm going to the New York State on Friday.&nbsp;  &nbsp; You've heard my 2002 and 2003 camp stories, and 2004 should be even funnier than the past two years, put together, even.&nbsp; This year's yearbook staff attendees have an incredible sense of humor, and it'll be a good time.&nbsp; This year, however, stories will be accompanied by pictures, since I'm blogging this year's trip. &nbsp; For those of you going with me, yes, I am bringing my Xbox, in case you haven't heard, and I'll probably end up hooking it up in Courtney's room, since she's the one who really wants to play it.&nbsp; Courtney, I'm bringing MechAssault, and you'll love shooting things at the different mech...thingys.&nbsp; I'm also bringing a few other games, too, in case anyone cares.&nbsp; But, I forgot what they are, and its too early to get up and go to my bag, open it up, and find them.&nbsp; But, I am NOT bringing my GameCube (now more commonly referred to some as the Gaycube, since there's too many gay games on it).&nbsp; I have no games that are good for that system.&nbsp; It sucks. &nbsp; The past month has been fun on Blogger.&nbsp; I have had at least two posts every single day in the past month.&nbsp; Now, its time for that few day break that I've needed.&nbsp; On Thursday Night, I'll be saying adios bloggers.&nbsp; I'll be going on vacation for nearly a week and a half, so I won't be blogging AT ALL, no audio or anything.&nbsp; I'm then going to come back for more sweet features, and I'll start blogging again on August 4th, the day after I come back, unless I get bored and blog anyway.&nbsp; I'm going to have sweet new features, some of which are hilarious.&nbsp; School's starting again, and it'll bring a new semi-weekly event, "Bloggin' in the River," where I'll talk about my high school life, and how it certainly will reach its downfall once my fruitcake brother starts going there this year!&nbsp; Doesn't THAT sound like fun? &nbsp; So, that about wraps things up for Blog of Bagel today.&nbsp; I'll be back for AudioBlog of Bagel LIVE sometime today, maybe a "Hidden Cellphone" stunt.&nbsp; But, who knows.&nbsp;&nbsp; Have a good week folks.&nbsp; And I'll be back on Thursday for the "Camp Orlando 2004 Review" posts, which will be quite a few posts.&nbsp; Maybe 10.&nbsp; Or 20.&nbsp; Depending on how many pictures and things there are.&nbsp; Who cares.&nbsp; All I know is that this is going to be an awesome event.&nbsp; This is David, signing off.&nbsp; Adios bloggers.

      Welcome to Not so late night but late enough because I'm going to Camp Orlando® Tomorrow and have to get up at 5:30 in the morning Bloggin'.&nbsp; Tonight's edition of Late Night Bloggin' is early because...well, I have to get up at 5:30 in the morning so I can go work in the guidance office at school before I go to Camp Orlando.&nbsp; Tonight I'm looking at three new blogs.&nbsp; Here they are:  &nbsp;   urlLink The Squared Circle of my Mind   Rating: *  &nbsp;  I don't like this one.&nbsp; He's talking about parties, and biking, and stuff I don't care about.&nbsp; He claims to be the Innovator of Awesomeness, but we all know that I take that title, thanks to my creation of Late Night Bloggin'.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this kid may be on my shitlist or something.&nbsp; I dunno.&nbsp; But, anywho.&nbsp; I don't like him.&nbsp; That's all I want to say.  &nbsp;   urlLink eh...something long and in Spanish   Rating: ****  &nbsp;  That's right.&nbsp; 4 stars.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because I can't understand it, because its in spanish.&nbsp; So, no complaints about someone's boyfriend sleeping with some other girl, or anything that gets slightly annoying after a while (if there is, I can't read it, because its in Spanish!).&nbsp; So, this guy gets my Blog of the Month that's Not Blog of Bagel Award.&nbsp; In fact, I like this one so much, that it makes the guy's blog that I reviewed above look like crap. Sorry dude, but that's the way it is.  &nbsp;   urlLink Vana'diel?   Rating: * &nbsp; Good god.&nbsp; A blog with pictures about Final Fantasy.&nbsp; Now, if you know me, you'd know that I can't stand Final Fantasy.&nbsp; It is the most god awful series of games in the world, and should have ended after its second installment.&nbsp; So, this person just posts pictures of Final Fantasy XI Online.&nbsp; What&nbsp;a waste of blog space.&nbsp; That makes two blogs that I don't like today. &nbsp; Well, that about does it.&nbsp; Tomorrow morning, I'm leaving for Yearbook Camp.&nbsp; So, I'll post something before I head off...then I'm all audio until Thursday.&nbsp; Then, Thursday night, with Late Night Bloggin', that ends the blogging season, meaning I'm going on vacation.&nbsp; Then, I'll come back in August with more new blog features!&nbsp; So, just in case I don't get around to my last post in the morning, look for my Audio blog posts all week long, and I'll be back to end this blog season.&nbsp;

      This makes me mad, and confused, too...it's 5:30 now, and its only 75 degrees.&nbsp; Could we be heading towards a cold front?&nbsp; In the middle of summer?!&nbsp; I HOPE SO!&nbsp; Just as long as it isn't cold when I'm soaking wet at Islands of Adventure.&nbsp; It would be so awesome... normally its about 100 degrees out here, and today's high wasn't anywhere near 80, even.&nbsp; That's awesome...KEEP IT THAT WAY, PLEEEASE!  &nbsp; I'm all packed to go to Camp Orlando.&nbsp; Took a couple suitcases to get it right, but, now I'm all packed into one thing.&nbsp; And its HEAAAVY!&nbsp; But, I guess that since I'm partially packed for my trip to the New York state afterwards, it fits the scene.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Just wanna welcome my good ol' buddy Alex to the Blogger world... he just signed up today.&nbsp; Just look through my profile, click on The River, and you'll see it.&nbsp; Now if only I could get Adam to sign up for Blogger and ditch his other journal (I'll show you how to move your old blog over here, if you do Adam!), and other people too, then The River's Blog Community will get even bigger...and it all started with me.&nbsp; Who knows, maybe the majority of The River High School's population will get on Blogger by the end of the next school year...that would be awesome. &nbsp; Anywho.&nbsp; I can't wait to get out of here tomorrow.&nbsp; Look for audio posts throughout the week, because its the only way that I will be able to blog.&nbsp; Then, when I come back, I'll edit them all, giving them titles, text, etc., to along with it.&nbsp; And, when I come back, I'll have pictures and stuff from the trip, as well.&nbsp; Tonight at 9:30, join me for my special "Not so late night but late enough because I'm going to Camp Orlando® Tomorrow and have to get up at 5:30 in the morning Bloggin'" post.&nbsp; See ya then!

      Howdy there, and welcome to a coffee-fueled edition of Nerdular Nerdance: Yearbook Camp.&nbsp; Today, I'm going to post about the 2003 Yearbook Camp, and also the final preparations for the camp that begins tomorrow.&nbsp; That's right.&nbsp; Tomorrow.&nbsp; Meaning, I have to pack stuff.&nbsp; Today.&nbsp; Or else I won't be ready...tomorrow.&nbsp; Which means that I won't have anything to do until Friday.&nbsp; And that's a week away.&nbsp; So, anywho.&nbsp; I told you it was coffee-fueled.&nbsp; Now, onto the fun stuff and things.&nbsp; I think there's like 6 or 7 stories to wrap up the past two years... last year's camp was full of interesting stuff.&nbsp; So, here we go. &nbsp; 2003 Class: Desktop 2 Last year's class was actually remotely interesting, since it involved things that I am aware of.&nbsp; Computers.&nbsp; The teacher(s) weren't annoying.&nbsp; They were actually pretty cool, and they came from the Walsworth Company themselves.&nbsp; We learned a lot of interesting Photoshop tricks, and a couple things in Pagemaker (which is my favorite program, btw).&nbsp; They gave me this huge as crap packet of stuff, which is what I've been using for my Photoshop tricks on Digital Lust.&nbsp; Anywho.&nbsp; It was a much better, much more interesting class than the Yearbook I class that I had taken before, and I liked it.&nbsp; Adam was in there with me, and we sat through on Dickert's laptop listening to his Hanson music and other weird things.&nbsp; Highly interesting.&nbsp; Great class, that one was. &nbsp; Katie, Colleen, and the sperm covered sheets: Anyone up for a sick story?&nbsp; I've got one.&nbsp; The first night we were there, at 2:00 in the morning, I think it was, Katie, who was our editor last year, and one of her roommates, Colleen, came running out of their bedroom, and demanded that they get new sheets.&nbsp; The reason?&nbsp; They found someone's sperm in it.&nbsp; And that's just sick.&nbsp; Had they come knocking on our door screaming like that, I probably would have grabbed a fire extinguisher or something...because with my sense of reality, jumping under beds when someone knocks on the door, anything could happen.&nbsp; Trust me.&nbsp; But, me and Adam were already long gone asleep before that happened.&nbsp; So, I didn't hear about it until the next morning.&nbsp; Apparently, they had called room service several million times, and they wouldn't do anything about it, so they just flew out, went downstairs, and demanded that they get new sheets.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; Sick.&nbsp; But, hilarious. &nbsp; Knock Knock.&nbsp; HIDE!: This has to be the stupidest moment of my life.&nbsp; But, it was also hilarious.&nbsp; It was around 12:30 in the morning, and Amber and Melissa H. were in our room talking to me, Adam, and Dickert.&nbsp; Someone came knocking on our door, and we all thought it was Mrs. Yearbook Advisor.&nbsp; So, Amber and Melissa went hiding into the closet, and I dove under the bed.&nbsp; Then, they all kind of looked at me for a second, and then Adam went to get the door...it was Courtney.&nbsp; So, after everyone stared at me for a second, I couldn't help but laugh... I hid under the bed in my own room because there were people in it.&nbsp; "No, Mrs. Yearbook Advisor, David didn't invite them in here...he's not even in here!"&nbsp; I felt pretty stupid, but, I guess I should have! &nbsp; Amber Calls a Theme park attraction a bitch...: This one was already posted, but, hey, what the hell, I'll post it again!&nbsp; We were at Islands of Adventure, for our 5 or 6 hour break, and we were on the Dudley Do Right's Ripsaw Falls ride.&nbsp; Amber, who had just gotten off the Bilge Rat Barges thingy with the rest of us, was soaking wet, and couldn't take anymore water.&nbsp; So, when we were on the ride, we came down one of the smaller ramp thingys, and we got a little wet...and there was what looked like a platform where employees would sit and monitor...but nobody was there.&nbsp; Amber actually got up and started thinking about getting off the ride.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; So, between her and Katie screaming, calling the ride a bitch, Adam screaming like a little girl in the car behind us, and me trying to splash water back up at Amber, I think it was pretty interesting.&nbsp; Just wait until someone doesn't want to get wet this year....HAHAHA. &nbsp; Mrs. Yearbook Advisor Behind the Wheel: Now, you may remember yesterday's story of Mrs. Yearbook Advisor's Mom and her driving abilities, but, things couldn't get any funnier than what happened at camp last year.&nbsp; She was pulling out at the intersection of 490 and 200 on the way to camp, and she pulled out right in front of a car, so she swerved into the left lane, and STOPPED THE CAR, RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC.&nbsp; She got out of the car, and said that the suitcases were packed too high.&nbsp; So, me, from Mrs. Adam's Mom's van, am thinking, what the hell is she trying to do...&nbsp; She finally realized there was traffic coming, so she swerved off to the grass.&nbsp; Then, in Orlando, she was coming into Universal the day we went to IOA, and she pulled out in front of a shuttle, just like I thought she would.&nbsp; Then, on I-4 just outside of Universal, she was getting off to get back to the hotel, and she cut off a car.&nbsp; Definite good times...  &nbsp; Courtney and the Dishes: I had already posted this one, too, but, since I'm talking about 2003 camp, I figured I'd bring it back up.&nbsp; They were having an ice cream social on the first night, and I got up to put my dish on the overstacked pile of dishes, and I was thinking "I'm gonna break something, I know it."&nbsp; Well, I had put it down and walked away, and all of a sudden, CRASH!&nbsp; I'm thinking "Oh shit."&nbsp; But, then I see Courtney and Elizabeth standing there, laughing, because they had dropped the dishes.&nbsp; Cameras and photographers from the Photography class everywhere.&nbsp; Courtney blushing.&nbsp; People laughing.&nbsp; People choking on ice cream.&nbsp; Alright, maybe it wasn't that dramatic, but, it was highly hilarious.&nbsp; Which is why I posted it. &nbsp; Hard Rock Cafe: Mrs. Yearbook Advisor's "50th Birthday" You got your three new stories.&nbsp; So stop complaining!&nbsp; This one came from the last day of camp, before we were heading home.&nbsp; We went to Hard Rock Cafe for lunch, and Dickert played a little joke on Mrs. Yearbook Advisor, and the Hard Rock Cafe itself, too.&nbsp; He told the waiter and waitress that it was Mrs. Yearbook Advisor's 50th birthday, and that they should call her up and do something mean.&nbsp; So, later on, they went over to her and were like "Ma'am, could you please come with us?"&nbsp; So, she went, and we all followed.&nbsp; He was like "Attention Hard Rock!&nbsp; Today is Mrs. Yearbook Advisor's 50th birthday, so lets sing it."&nbsp; So they sang.&nbsp; And I thought Mrs. Yearbook Advisor was going to kill Dickert for that one.&nbsp;  &nbsp; So, that's it then.&nbsp; Two years down, and one more to go.&nbsp; Yearbook camp begins tomorrow, and I'm out of here at 6:45 tomorrow morning.&nbsp; So I'm going to get up, post my Farewell post, and then get out of here, so I can do some work up in the school until its time to leave.&nbsp; Which means, I have to carry all of my luggage with me there.&nbsp; I'll be back later tonight with "Not So Late But Late Enough Because I'm Leaving for Yearbook Camp Early Tomorrow Morning Bloggin" post, and maybe some other stuff, too.&nbsp; So, see ya! &nbsp;

      Howdy there, and welcome to tonight's power packed edition of Late Night Bloggin'.&nbsp; Tonight, I've got three blogs that I'm going to take a look at.&nbsp; Remember, I'm either going to make fun of the blogs seen in tonight's edition, or, I'm going to love them and say positive things in an attempt to make more people like my blog.&nbsp; Whichever is more important.&nbsp; But first, let me just say that this blog is becoming a little more popular.&nbsp; We've almost made our 200th hit since I put the counter up, and it was only two weeks ago.&nbsp; I'm impressed.&nbsp; Anyway, let's get to it.&nbsp; Here's your Late Night Bloggin' for tonight:  &nbsp;   urlLink Memory Lane   Rating: ****  &nbsp;  Why do I give this blog my most perfect rating of 4 stars?&nbsp; Simple.&nbsp; There's no text.&nbsp; There's no pictures.&nbsp; There aren't any annoying blog owners running around making fun of other people's blogs.&nbsp; In fact, all that this blog has is a template, something in her profile, and that's it.&nbsp; No posts, no nothing, no kidding.&nbsp; That's why I like this one.&nbsp; Normally with girl blogs (and this doesn't apply to Courtney or Jackie), they tend to start going off into the whole "Like, omg, I slept with this guy," and its really annoying, especially if you're the one who goes around looking through other people's blogs and come across it several times a day.&nbsp; Now, I'm almost 100% positive that this new blog, which was just created, is NOT going to stay this way.&nbsp; The person will probably update tomorrow or something on who she slept with recently, or something... I don't know.&nbsp; I don't care.&nbsp; But I like this blog the way it is now, and I wish it would stay this way.&nbsp; Congratulations, BeAuMoNt...you've won a 4 star rating.&nbsp; Now don't update your blog, and you'll stay off my shit list for eternity.  &nbsp;   urlLink History of Hermione Granger   Rating:&nbsp;*  &nbsp;  Well, looks&nbsp;like someone's got a crush on Emma Watson, the girl who plays Hermione Granger in the&nbsp;Harry Potter films...&nbsp;his sidebar is dedicated to stats about Hermione, including birth, hobbies, and other&nbsp;things... I don't know what to say, except, I don't think I've heard of a&nbsp;boy who&nbsp;takes a celebrity crush to this sort of magnitude.&nbsp; I don't think&nbsp;its a good thing.&nbsp; Did you know that celebrity crushes are unhealthy?&nbsp; Well, this is my research, because my sister recently pretty much dedicated herself to John Stamos, the dude from Full House.&nbsp; All she talks about is John Stamos...and Clay&nbsp;Aiken, making&nbsp;it even worse.&nbsp; It's more than I can handle.&nbsp; Good thing this kid here isn't my brother, because I hate celebrity crushes...especially when you dedicate a website to it.&nbsp; Sorry dude, but, get a life, quit stalking celebrities through the usage of the interweb.  &nbsp;    urlLink Its Blog, Blog Blog!   Rating: **  &nbsp;  First off, dude, I like your title.&nbsp; It's supposed to be like that Ren and Stimpy Song, which I'll post lyrics right here!:      What rolls down stairs  goes under in pairs  and over your neighbor's dog?  It's great for a snack  it fits on your back  it's log, log, log!  Its log, log  it's big, its heavy, its wood  its log, log  its better than bad, its GOOD!  Everyone wants a log  come on and get a log  everyone needs a log  log, log log  LOG, from Blamo! Thank you...thank you.&nbsp; Yes, I'm good with creating lyrics, aren't I.&nbsp; Look for my first single, "Blog, Blog, Blog," in stores on August 17th.&nbsp; Anywho.&nbsp; This blog still sucks, despite its better than bad but good title.&nbsp; He uses the same template that I use for Blog of Bagel (which isn't necessarily a bad thing), but, his posts are kinda dumb.&nbsp; And that's what I don't like about most people's blogs.&nbsp; You have to have something a little better than "I had a dream last night," or, "Ruben's the man, I wish he'd come home."&nbsp; Come to me when you want advice on how to make your blog posts better! &nbsp; Anyway, that's it for tonight.&nbsp; Tomorrow, I'll have my Nerdular Nerdance: Yearbook Camp 2003 post, which highlights the whole camp from last year, with several camp stories, and more.&nbsp; I'll also have the lyrics for my first single, Blog Blog Blog, tomorrow, as well.&nbsp; That's it for me tonight.&nbsp; Remember, blogging gives you a 40% chance of scoring chicks, so blog often!

      Welcome to part one of Blog of Bagel's July edition of Nerdular Nerdance.&nbsp; This month, the topic is Yearbook Camp.&nbsp; Now, undoubtedly, you've heard that I'm going to yearbook camp in the big city of Orlando, FL.&nbsp; If you've been reading this blog at all in the past week or so, you've noticed that I have been posting interesting stories from the past two years at camp.&nbsp; So, now, less than 48 hours until I leave, I start my Nerdular Nerdance, and this one lasts all the way until next Thursday.&nbsp; I'll have pictures from the trip (after I come back, obviously), stories from years past continuing, and, of course, the much anticipated AudioBlog of Bagel posts...hidden cellphone, anyone?&nbsp; Sure, why not.&nbsp; In today's installment, I'll be talking about the class I was in in the 2002 Yearbook Camp, and the other crazy things that happened that year.&nbsp; &nbsp; Yearbook I: The 2002 Yearbook Camp Class Take a crazed, loud, and annoying yearbook advisor from Seminole High School, add her in with a fresh graduate from some other school, and add a bunch of yearbook things, and you get Yearbook I.&nbsp; The teacher was LOUD.&nbsp; It was me, Courtney, and Jessie in that class, and we were all kind of annoyed with her.&nbsp; She insisted on using a microphone.&nbsp; It was a pretty large room they had us in, but the class wasn't all that big, and she used the microphone, making her already loud voice even louder.&nbsp; In this class, we learned the basics of creating a yearbook, including the different sections, how to design layouts on paper, and how to write stories, captions, etc.&nbsp; It was a good start for me, because I came into the yearbook staff absolutely clueless as to anything that we would be doing.&nbsp; I had no idea that we created our own layouts.&nbsp; Boy, was I wrong about that one.&nbsp; Had I been on my middle school yearbook (dramatic how I turned out not to be on it, but, we won't go into that), then I probably would have had a little more knowledge as to what was going on, but, I wasn't.&nbsp; So, oh well.&nbsp; Anyway.&nbsp; The teacher was loud, I don't know how to stress that one enough.&nbsp; And, the final project that we had to complete was very tedious (I'm horrible at cutting things out of magazines...HORRIBLE!).&nbsp; We had to design a layout, complete with story, captions, pictures, etc.&nbsp; Everything, essentially.&nbsp; There was a lot of it, but, at least I got through it.&nbsp; By the way, did I mention the teacher was loud?&nbsp; LOUD!!! &nbsp; 2002 Camp: The Story of Mrs. Yearbook Advisor's Mom Being a new staff member that year, I didn't know Mrs. Yearbook Advisor's mom.&nbsp; I had no idea that getting in a car with her would be the riskiest thing in the world.&nbsp; Well, guess what folks, it turned out that way.&nbsp; Me, Courtney, and Melissa all got stuck riding with Mrs. Yearbook Advisor's Mom and Mrs. Yearbook Advisor's daughter.&nbsp; Backing out of the driveway, we hit Lisandra's (a senior at that time) car.&nbsp; No damage.&nbsp; But, still, she rammed into it.&nbsp; We didn't tell anyone, and I don't think it was until October of that year when someone blurted it out (and it was probably me, but I don't remember).&nbsp; And, when we were on a busy highway in Orlando heading to Chili's, she tried getting over a lane so she could turn left, and she ALMOST hit another car...THAT would have sucked.&nbsp; Had we hit that car, Melissa probably wouldn't be here today.&nbsp; I wonder why Mrs. Yearbook Advisor didn't have her mom drive last year...... &nbsp; And that's all I've got for today.&nbsp; Later on, I've got the "Top 10 Cars of 2005" list, which will have pictures and things of the 10 cars that I think look the sweetest for 2005.&nbsp; Then, I PROMISE I'll do a Late Night Bloggin' tonight, and maybe something else, if I have time.&nbsp; Tomorrow's Nerdular Nerdance is all about Camp Orlando 2003.&nbsp; See ya next time.

      Forgot the Late Night Bloggin' again last night...got too tired and fell asleep. Dead asleep. So, tonight I'll make it even better with 4 blogs to review, if I can stay awake, and I should be able to.  Later today begins the first installment of Nerdular Nerdance: Yearbook Camp. I've still got some camp stories to do, and I'll talk with other yearbook staffers (maybe) to see if they're as hyped up as I am about this...my summer has literally been the worst summer ever. Then,  Monday morning at 6:30 a.m., I'm turning to audio blogging for the rest of the week. Then Thursday, I come back and post the new camp stories from this year's camp. Sound interesting? With a yearbook staff as hilarious as mine, there are sure to be some interesting moments. And  of course I'm going to post about them!  Last night was such a long night... I fell asleep, then my dog came in at around 1:00 because it was thundering out, and it scares her, and then she woke me up, and then I fell back asleep, and 2 minutes later she wanted out. So I let her out. Then, I fell back asleep, only to wake up at 6:00 this morning because I forgot to unset my alarm from yesterday. Then I fell back asleep, and now I'm awake again. I hate it when this happens.   Today I think I'm gonna lounge around, play a little Xbox, watch a couple movies...that kind of thing. I have so much stuff to start thinking about packing, because my mom wants me packed by tomorrow afternoon, so that she can start making her checklist for the trip to New York.That will be a really, really long trip that I'm not looking forward to. But, at least we're stopping at Paramount in North Carolina on the way, and then Paramount in Virginia on the way back. Two Paramount parks in one outing... that should be...interesting. They better have good rides.  So, that's it for now. Join me later for the big event...the start of this month's Nerdular Nerdance report! It's going to be entertaining and hilarious, ALL WEEK LONG! I'll have it up at around 1:00 this afternoon.

      This is the last of my Spiderman 2 album lyrics...I promise!  This  one is called Vindicated, by Dashboard Confessional, a band I'd never  heard of before this song.  Well, here it is, your lyrics:        Hope dangles on a string  Like slow spinning redemption  Winding in and winding out  The shine of which has caught my eye   And roped me in  So mesmerizing, and so hypnotizing  I am captivated   [Chorus]  Vindicated I am selfish  I am wrong  I am right  I swear I'm right  I swear I knew it all along  I am flawed  But I am cleaning up so well  I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself   So clear  Like the diamond in your ring  Cut to mirror your intention  Oversized and overwhelmed  The shine of which has caught my eye  And rendered me so isolated, and so motivated  I am certain now that   Vindicated I am selfish  I am wrong  I am right  I swear I'm right  I swear I knew it all along  I am flawed  But I am cleaning up so well  I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself   So, turn up the corners of you lips  Part them and feel my finger tips  Taste the moment, fall forever Defense is paper thin  Just one touch and I'd be in  Too deep now to ever swim against the current  So let me slip away  So let me slip away So let me slip away So let me slip against the current  So let me slip away So let me slip away So let me slip away So let me slip away  Vindicated I am selfish  I am wrong  I am right  I swear I'm right  I swear I knew it all along  I am flawed  But I am cleaning up so well  I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself   my hope  It dangles on a string  Like slow spinning redemption...     Well, there ya go.  I'll be back later on with your Late Night  Bloggin' updates, with more review and more making fun of other  blogs!  Until then, however...crap, I'm out of witty ending  phrases.  Sorry.

      I just came back, after finally going out ot meet a couple of friends on the bike track.  It took me 20 minutes to get there, and it is SOOOO FREAKIN' HOT OUTSIDE.  I didn't think it could get that hot outside without large reports of death.  I live out in the woods, and if it were to all catch on fire right now...I would not be surprised.  But, about half way through the way home, I stopped and talked to this one kid, Wayne, that lives up the street.  He was riding on his golf cart thingy, and I had stopped right in the middle of the shade...so I got to cool down a bit before heading back in.      Two more days until I leave for camp (not counting today, obviously).  Hard to believe, right?  The amount of typed posts is about to go way down.  Waaay down.  Especially since there is only a one day overlay between YB Camp and the trip to the New York State.  My days of being on the interweb are gonna be shortened.   Tomorrow I'm going to begin the antagonizing process of packing for both trips.  I've got a lot of stuff to get ready.  For anyone who is coming along with me, I'm going to bring my Xbox, but, I've only got one controller and a couple games worth bringing.  Those games are MechAssault, SoulCalibur II, and Rallisport Challenge.  By the way, since I blog so much, a list of extra stuff I have to bring:    -Keyboard  -Mouse  -Mousepad  -Digi Camera  -Extra Batteries  -Xbox (w/controller, MechAssault, SCII, RC)  -Surge Protector    Yeah, that list has gone up quite a bit since the last time I posted it, so good thing its here.  Now I won't forget.  Well, that's about it for now.  I'll be back with your Late Night Bloggin' update for the night, plus something else!

        My allergies are getting to me this morning...and that's not a good thing.  I have to go places today, because I won't have time between the time I get back from Yearbook Camp and the time that I leave for the New York state.  I'm just gonna have to live with it, I guess, because it is absolutely crucial that I get this done before I leave the Blogger.      Nerdular Nerdance: The July Edition is coming!  It's in the planning stages.  It'll cover Sunday night and Thursday night's posts.  If you haven't guessed, it's going to be about Yearbook camp.  That's right.  All of the audio posts that I do (if I do any, I'm still unsure as to whether or not I can pull it off), all of the pictures that are posted, and all of the other stuff that I post.      Anywho.  I still haven't received any Gmail invites yet... but, I'm hoping to have some by August 9th, because that is the day that I want to begin the contest.  Remember, in order to win, you have to look across Blog of Bagel, Digital Lust, and the new blog (coming August 9th) for the secret codes, which will be hidden in comments and sometimes even the posts themselves (yeah, that's right, I can edit them).  Email the code to my Gmail account, and you're put in a drawing for the daily Gmail account giveaway.  I really want to get this thing started by August 9th, so hopefully while I am in Orlando, I'll receive my invites, and you guys can start getting them when I get back from the New York State.    We had a pretty bad storm up here last night, which is why I never got around to making fun of other peoples' blogs.  Doesn't that suck?  The power was out for a while, and then it took longer for the satellite to reconnect, leaving me... INTERWEBLESS!    Yea, that is definitely a bad thing.  Interwebless means that I have nothing to do, sending me into a state of Absolute Boredism, which therefore sends me into confusion because I can't post about how bored I am!  Yea, I'm crazy, and if it took you that long to figure that one out, you lose 5 bagel points.  Sorry.      Digital Lust is all new today.  I'm going to give a sneak preview of what is to come today, and in August, we officially launch the new site.  It's going to be more gaming oriented, but, with the occasional throw-in of the rest of the stuff that I have become famous for posting for.  The Google search thing is awesome...I'm now on teh G00g13!  Yeah, I was the last listing, but, that's okay, I s'pose.  I have an article going up today on the Sony PSP vs. the Nintendo DS, which is going to be rather lengthy and interesting, so read it, if you're a nerd like me.    Anyone seen that movie School of Rock?  It's my absolute favoritest movie of all time, with the exception of Spiderman 2.  Jack Black is without doubt one of the funniest actors of all time, and putting him in the position of a substitute teacher was one of the best decisions that they could make, especially with his musical background.  I can't wait to see what kind of changes he'll make to the upcoming King Kong remake (if you haven't heard, he IS the star of it, and it will be in theaters December 2005).  I have a feeling that it will be more comedy than what it used to be.  The only thing I'm worried about, is, what will they use in place of the WTC scene, where King Kong is up at the top (from the 1970-whatever version)?  Will they go back to the Empire State Building, like in the original movie?  Or, will they use the WTC in hopes that they won't get flamed?  Or, will they even use the new WTC which started construction last week?  Doubt that one, but, you never know with these movie crews.    Well now, that's about it for today's morning update.  After a nice, long post, my allergies are starting to clear up already.  Isn't that great?  Detect sarcasm, get the 5 bagel points you probably lost a few minutes ago when reading above.  Later on today, I'll have one final camp story before we head into Nerdular Nerdance mode, plus, the all new, revamped Late Night Bloggin'.  For now, go check out Digital Lust in about half an hour for the first new feature that I'll have on board.  We're going to have two posts there today, and each one will have something that you eren't expecting!  I'll be back here later on.

         First, before I start talking about 2 new camp stories from Yearbook camp from the past two years, let me first talk about what Blogger has done.  It's bad.  Real Bad.  Except, it's not. It's actually really good.  They've changed the post template, and it looks a lot better.  Easier to use, easier to post, and more post options, like the ability to change fonts.  It's just taking the most awesome free blogging service and turning into something even better.  So now, I can post:

      Yep.  That's all its been.  As of yesterday, Blog of Bagel is one month old, and this is post numero 65.  Hard to believe, eh?  I guess I've just got that much to say around here.  So, I went up to work at the school for four hours today, and according to Mrs. Guidance Secretary (remember, I don't use real names of teachers or stuff, since I'm funny that way), I couldn't have done more.  The school's newsletters are headed to students' houses.  ACT 2004-2005 registration packets are all labeled and shelved.  And, they had other minor jobs for me as well.  Monday morning I'm going to be dropped off at the school around 7 or so, and work up until its time to leave for camp.  I got 4 hours of community service today, which brings my current total to 154 hours.  My college resumes are going to look awesome with that huge number.  Most people go to 75 and then stop there.  I think I've mentioned before that I took baseball pictures for the football team last year (EDIT at 4:50...whoops).  That got me about 100 hours of that service.  If I could get this new baseball coach dude to let me help this next year, or, even if I do football pictures or tennis pictures or something else to get large amounts of community service, I'll do it.  The more hours, the better chance I have getting into UCF.  Because, that's the school I want to go to.  Tomorrow I'm going to start making pre-leaving preparations, since dad has to be obsessive over it.  All of the things like mouses, keyboards, mousepads, etc., I'm going to track down and get packed to go.  I'm taking my digital camera this year, so I'll hopefully find some picture ideas for my senior ad.    And, speaking of things related to school, there's only about 3 more weeks of summer, and I couldn't feel any more confused as to if its a good idea or a bad idea.  How could it possibly be good?  How could it possibly be bad?  Tons of reasons, actually.  Good because this summer has been dragging on forever, and the thought of going back to the school and seeing my friends on a more regular basis, it sounds good on paper.  Bad, because I overheard my brother talking on the phone with some of his friends the other night, and he's got some "genius, drug-addict induced plan" to trash my senior year in under 30 seconds, I guess.  I shouldn't worry though, a couple of my friends already want to hurt him, and doing that to me would just make a sure-hit thing.  So, I'm preparing for the worst.    I've been looking online to see when Spiderman 2 is coming on DVD.  I believe its going to be an October release.  I definitely can't wait for that one, if you haven't noticed the large amount of hype that I had over the movie until after it came out.  The movie was perfect.  Many people didn't like it, but I thought it was one of the best movies I had ever seen.  Ever.  It got a 4-star rating from someone, and was declared the best superhero movie ever from that Ebert dude.    I'll be back later on for more stuff, including Late Night Bloggin' and something else.  Adios for now!

      And this one is about, well...Camp, as in, Amber Camp.  Funny one, that Amber Camp, even though most people wouldn't agree with me on that one.  Because I have to get going to TRHS, I'm going to make this one short, sweet, and to the point.  -2003: Amber Calls A Theme Park Ride a Bitch!- Alright, so we take a few hours off of the busy work schedule to go to Islands of Adventure, and, surprisingly, we get on all the rides (except my personal favorite, Spiderman, but, hey, we ran out of time).  Anywho.  We get on the Dudley Do Right's Ripsaw Falls thingy, and, we came down one of those minor drops, and Amber gets soaked.  Well, she found a platform where she could get off.  Meanwhile, Adam back in another car could be heard screaming like a girl (it's supposedly a trademark).  Amber starts calling the ride a bitch, using every freakin' word like shit, fuck, you know, those words.  I thought it was pretty funny, because it was the first time I really saw her act like that, and over a little bit of water!!!  I think it was mainly because we had gotten soaked on the water flume thingy.  Oh well.  It was funny.  Now I gotta get off to school.  I'll be back at noon, so I'll post something when I get back, if I feel like it.  Until next time, fools, theme park rides don't mean to be a bitch.

      Well, howdy there and welcome to another installment of my late night blog celebration of other people's blogs. Tonight I'm going to look at two blogs, and then I'm going to fall asleep, since I'm going to work up at the school for a few hours tomorrow morning.  So, without much further ramble, here are your Late Night Bloggin' blogs for the nite:    urlLink A Wolf at the Door   Rating: ***  What's that?  A good blog? Yep, that's correct.  I like this one.  His writing style is unique, something I haven't seen in too many blogs.  Most of the time I see blogs, they're normally crazed teenagers talking about other people's blogs, or using dialogue like, "Omg wtf?!  Some1 is soooo hot!"  That's not the case with this one.  I'm not sure how old this guy is, but, based on his constant style of dissing George W., I'd say he's older.  This one is pretty good, but, only check it out if you like to read stuff unexpectedly.      urlLink My Bittersweet Symphony   Rating: **  I love the name of this blog... it reminds me of a song that I have loved for the majority of my life (Bitter Sweet Symphony, The Verve).  But, you may have noticed, in the review of the blog above, I mentioned something about all the "omg omg omg" stuff... well, that blog tends to do that a lot.  Will I ever find a blog that I find to be absolutely flawless???  Probably not.  Not even Blog of Bagel® is perfect.  It's got its flaws too, like a crazed, Bloggermaniac who posts crap about other peoples' blogs!  Hey, wait...that's ME!!!  Anywho... kudos for the title "My Bittersweet Symphony."  I like it.  And, that's it for Late Night Bloggin'.  I'm going up to The River High School tomorrow to do a little bit of work in the guidance office (community service, can't have too much of that!).  So, I'll post something early in the morning, and then head out for a few hours, and then be back for more blogging.  I'll have 1 more camp story (at least) tomorrow, and then some other stuff.  So, until tomorrow, then, get some sleep or something.

      Alright, you may have heard by now that they're shipping me off to Yearbook Camp next week.  So, I'm here to share some of the stories that happened last year and even the year before.  I've got two stories today...and they're both about my good ol' buddy Courtney.  Here they are:  -2002 Camp Story: Courtney Meets the Pool- Courtney is hilarious.  Very unpredictable, you never know what she's going to do.  Me, her, and Melissa were all hanging around the hotel one night, and Courtney all of a sudden got really quiet.  So, we came up to around the pool, and all of a sudden, Courtney walks off and starts circling the pool.  All of a sudden, she stops, stares at the pool, and just plops in.  I looked at Melissa for a second, thinking, wow, is she crazy or something?!  Turns out, yes, she is, but a good kind of crazy.  -2003 Camp Story: Courtney and the Broken Dishes- This is how it all began: how the 2004 Yearbook Staff became so clumsy.  I was the original klutz on the yearbook staff, and something happened this past year, and we had a bunch of them.  Alright, so, the first night of camp, they had an ice cream social thingy, where they gave out free pizza...eh, I mean, ice cream, obviously.  While the rest of the staff sat around eating ice cream, I got up to put my dish back up on the tray that they had set up for dirty dishes.  It was a pretty high stack, and I thought I would definitely be the one to drop the dishes.  I put my dish down, everything's fine.  I didn't realize Courtney and Elizabeth were behind me putting their dishes down, and all of a sudden, CRASH!  I'm thinking "oh shit, what did I do now?"  But, it wasn't me.  It was Courtney.  And Elizabeth.  Broken dishes and melted ice cream everywhere.  All of a sudden, there's this huge crowd of people from our school and other schools with cameras surrounding them, taking pictures of the whole thing.  They just sat there laughing while hotel management came to clean it up. At the end of the workshop, they showed this slideshow of pictures that were taken during the whole week, and Courtney, Elizabeth, and the broken dishes showed up...and we all expected it.  We have some pictures of that, and, if I can snag one and scan it in through the yearbook room, I'll do it, but, not until school starts.  Yeah...definitely a good one.  The second story was better than the first, but, oh well.  I wonder what kind of stories will come out of this year... dunno, but, there's only 4 more days until we leave.    Later tonight, Late Night Bloggin' returns after a 4 day hiatus.  As for Digital Lust, I think I'm just going to shut it down until I come back from the New York State.  Maybe by then, the interweb will have more stuff to see.  So, until then, bye!

      It's been almost a week since Digital Lust was last updated, so I'm going to get to work updating that today, and also getting this blog back on track with its normal updating schedule, like it was before.  It won't last long though, since I'll be heading out of town this next week.  Here's what you can look for next week:  -Audio Blog: I'm gonna try and audioblog it at least once or twice a day while I'm gone.  This may include "hidden cellphone," in which anything my yearbook buddies say or do may be recorded and posted live to the blog.  -Pictoblog: Coming this week is the "Blog of Bagel Photo Blog," in which I'm going to be posting pictures of all sorts of stuff.  I'm going to have my camera around whilst I'm gone, and I'll come back and post a bunch of pictures.  Then, they'll also go to the Photo Blog for archiving.  I'm getting to work on that soon.  And that's what you can look for.  While I'm in NY, I've made the decision that both blogs will be CLOSED.  No updates, no photo blogs, no audio blogs, nothing... I'm just going to take that vacation as a break.  That way, when I come back, I'll be feeling the heavy addiction to Blogger all over again!  And in other news, some may remember the Dell Axim that I squirted Windex all over accidentally.  Well, I'm finally going to get that fixed, so I'll be able to update more frequently, even from school if I need to.  (Simple: load the create new post screen on your PDA before you leave, maybe a few different windows if you're a bloggermaniac, update it throughout the day, then hook up to a computer, and send it away...instant blogification).  Hopefully I'll have it back before school starts.  We'll see though.  It's a mystery as of this point.  I'm not going to send it until after I get back from the New York state, so I won't have it for school starting, but, sometime shortly after.    Well, anyway...I'd better get started on today's 2 Digital Lust updates...I'll explain what's going on there in my first post for today.  I also want to try and get a new poll up here within the next day or so.  That's it for now.  Until later today (lyrics), do something constructive and time consuming.  You won't regret it.

      Alrighty then.  My driving days are over, we all managed to survive, and now, I'm back to Bloggin'.  Things are going to go back to full speed tomorrow, even with brand new stuff at Digital Lust.  But, enough about that.  Let's talk about driving.  There's good news.  I passed driver's ed, like I thought I would.  Bad news, Alex did.  Haha, just kidding.  Actually, he did better than I did.  Caitlin, however, shockingly, did not do better than me or Alex.  I'm not going to say she's a "bad driver," but, she has needed much improvement before she can get her license, and this was the perfect chance.  She came a long way since we started yesterday.  She had to drive I-75 through a really bad storm, and she was having a hard time seeing the road.  But, we managed to survive, it was good experience for her, and us, and we enjoyed ourselves.  Driving through I-75, for me, wasn't an entirely difficult experience, but, it wasn't that easy either.    We spent the whole day in Ocala, pretty much.  Saw a lot of the places that I used to go when I lived there.  I drove through downtown for the first time... worst traffic I'd ever gone through.  My biggest flaw in driving is parking, though.  I'm really bad at it.  I didn't hit anything, but, my parking job has to be the worst part of driving, in my opinion.  So, driving went well, I can have my will pulled now and have it modified sometime in the future (who gets my blog???).  Now, all we have to do is look forward to camp, which is next week, as stated several times.  I think the rules that Mrs. Yearbook Advisor set up are fair, and I guessed something happened last year at camp that she didn't like, and I didn't know about it until today.  She also has to take into account recent events that happened at the middle school, where there was some big alcohol-related thing, and one teacher got fired because of it.  I think she has to definitely have some things cleared up in writing.  It's all common sense what she said, but, in writing, it can make discipline matters for anyone who were to do it much worse...which they would deserve.  But, she wants us to have fun, too, so, we're going to do that.    I guess Blogger is going to be down for maintainance around the time that I normally have a Late Night Bloggin' segment, so I won't be having one again tonight.  I'll try and get on later with a lyrics post or something else, I dunno, but, if I don't, you know I'm sleeping.  So, until later, see youse later.

      I'm tired.  Today had to be the longest day.  First, I drove from 8-3 with my group, and then, instead of going to Alex's house, went to the school, since neither me or Alex were really feeling all that great after that long day.  So, at the school, I saw Courtney, Melissa, and a couple other people I know.  Then I went home.  Now excuse me, I must go to sleep.  That ends this short edition of Blog of Bagel.

      I just realized that I, as well as Shortney, who used to do Eat Blog, have both lived here for just a little over 3 years.  Almost to the day we moved here at the same time.  Isn't that funny?  Its hard to believe.  And only one more to go.  I've made a decision that I definitely want to go to UCF.  They have a really good journalism program, and I couldn't think of anything else that I would want to do after high school.  I'm going to schedule a college visit for sometime in September, after school has already started.  Come August 2005, I'll be down there at UCF.  I'd do anything to get into that school!    Tomorrow is day 1 of my driving days for drivers ed.  Nervous?  Of course.  Me and Alex are terrified.  I have no idea how to conquer this fear, other than to wear my sunglasses and fall asleep during the day when I'm not driving.  The next two days are going to go by very, very slow, I'm afraid.  We drive from 8-3, and I'm gonna be at the school at around 7:15, since mom has to get ready to close on the ol' house.    There's not going to be late night bloggin' tonight.  I feel the urge to get to sleep.  Right now.  I have to get up at 6.  So, I'll have an "Early Morning Hope I don't Die Today Bloggin'" post.  Haha.  Just kidding.  I'll post something in the morning though.  Until then, conquer your fears, don't be scared to drive, and don't be a coward.  And that is your advice for the day.  Enjoy.

      As you have undoubtedly noticed, my summer is finally going to get better, with my driving days for drivers ed, yearbook camp, and my trip to New York.  Tomorrow, I have the first of my driving days, and it's going to be either a fun experience or a scary experience...depending on who's driving when.  I'm really nervous.  I think I'll do alright though.  Driving on I-75 in Ocala is something that I'm definitely just a bit nervous of.  I've only driven on a major highway like that once, and that was the Suncoast Parkway, and that's barely any traffic most of the time.  Tuesday, after drivers ed, I have a yearbook staff meeting.  Its gonna be weird seeing a lot of the people that I haven't seen in two months.  I feel so isolated, all up here in the countryside of The River.  I have a big house, why don't I throw a party sometime!  Something I wouldn't do...sorry.  The whole "my parents own two houses" thing is coming to an end, speaking of my house.  We finally sold our old house, and it closes tomorrow.  We haven't lived there for a whole year, and we had people living in it until last month, but, oh well.  Now I'll never have to go to The Town Below the River ever again.    And, that's it for now.  A storm is brewing, and is about to go right over me, so I'd better get this up before I lose my shitacular satellite connection!  I'll be back later with Late Night Bloggin' and something else, too.  Maybe some lyrics to another song.  Dunno.  But see you later!

      Hola!  Welcome to another power-packed installment of your favorite night time blog, Blog of Bagel, for another installment of your favorite post, Late Night Bloggin'.  Today, I have two all new blogs to either praise or make fun of, but remember, its all in good fun.  But, before we get to that...   urlLink Click here!   What is that?  It's the first of several teasers for my next blog, tentatively titled Blog of Bagel 2.  Several teasers will be there in the coming weeks, and up to its launch on August 20th, 2004.  I've began to plan things for the official launch, like what the blog will be about.  It's going to be something completely different. Trust me.  And now, then, on to tonight's Late Night Bloggin'.    urlLink Random Ramblings   Rating: *  Wow.  And I thought there would never be a blog that would absolutely bore me to death.  Normally, they all have something of interest and entertainment, maybe a sex story, or how dramatic you are because your ex boyfriend or girlfriend dumped you (highly entertaining!).  I love those stories!  But, they're all mysteriously absent from this one, and it's boring.  Her most recent post talks about how she watched the Disney Channel today, and then did something for cheerleading.  Sorry, but, you've bored me to death.      urlLink Better than ur Xanga   Rating: **  Another girl's blog, another sure to be boring blog.  Yeah, that's the case, but, why higher than Random Ramblings?  Her title.  BETTER than ur Xanga is true.  Blogger truly is better than Xanga.  Having used Xanga for a long time, I definitely feel like Blogger is better.  Her posts are boring, yes, but, if it weren't for her title, I'd say this was a pretty boring blog.  But, not worthy of a "Most boring" award.  Now, as you're undoubtedly aware, I have my driving days for drivers ed on Monday and Tuesday.  I'm quite nervous.  It's going to be very, very tedious.  Alex knows exactly what I'm talking about (we were talking about it yesterday).  Here's hoping to nothing bad happening.    Then, Wednesday, its back to the doctor... I took the band-aid® off of my finger today to see how it was healing, and, there's more that have to be cut off... this better not be a recurring thing.  I've got too much coming in the near future, and don't want to end up in the emergency room during yearbook camp or New York!  I already had to go to the Emergency Room once when I was in New York, and that's just not cool.  I think The Ataris are quickly becoming one of my favorite bands.  They're songs are pretty good.  Them, Midtown, and Linkin Park are in my top 5 list.  Yellowcard is good, but, I really only liked Ocean Avenue...nothing else is "that great."    Tomorrow I'm taking the day off to go visit a couple friends before my absolute busy summer finale starts.  I'll blog, probably audio from somewhere, and then a couple of other entries, if you're lucky.    So, until tomorrow, go do something constructive, like sleep, or drink something heavy.  Something I wouldn't do.

       The lights are out in the city tonight So close your eyes, gaze up at the heavens And see if you can point me out  If I could have one wish tonight I'd wish upon a satellite To bring me back to you We spend our whole lives searching for All the things we think we want And never really knowing what we have  So many paths that we can take To bring us to our destiny Gaze up at the heavens And see if you can point me out  If I could have one wish tonight I'd wish upon a satellite To bring me back to you We spend our whole lives searching for All the things we think we want And never really knowing what we have  Be careful what you wish for These stars are fading out.   Join me later tonight for Late Night Bloggin', here on Blog of Bagel.

      Monday, my busy time for the summer season is officially here.  Monday and Tuesday, I'll be off with Alex and Caitlin for our driving days for driver's ed.  I'll be gone most of the day.  I have to work both nights, but, oh well.  Then, Wednesday, I'm at home, Thursday, I'm at home, and then Friday, I'm supposed to be going to either Busch Gardens or Universal Studios.  Unsure yet.  Then, the following Monday, vacation begins, and I'll essentially be gone for two weeks.  I come back from yearbook camp on Thursday, at which point I'll post the picture portion from camp.  Then, Friday morning, I get up at the crack o' dawn and head out to New York.  I'll be back from there on August 2nd.  Then, that only gives me one week before school starts.  Hard to believe it's already coming this quick...2 weeks ago summer was going so slow, and then it sped up.    So, don't be expecting too many regular posts here for a while.  I'm gonna have to go audio.  Digital Lust is essentially going to be closed until I get back from NY, with only a couple more days of updates.  I won't audio those updates.    That's it from me for now.  It's going to be a busy day for me, I think.  So, that's it.  See ya later!

      People are probably wondering why I stopped Digital Lust today.  Well, I had this series of blisters or something on a finger on my left hand, and one popped last night, and the other ones started to grow bigger.  So, I had to go and have them all cut off.  It's painful.  So, I'm going to NOT talk as much as normal tonight.  Oh wait.  Yes I am!  My driving days for drivers ed are on Monday and Tuesday, so Digital Lust is going to be closed then.  But, I'll still post here, maybe an audio post during the day while we're at lunch or something.  I'm probably going home with Alex, too, so I'll audio blog it from there if all else fails.  The second day, I have my senior pictures, and I'm debating whether or not to go to them now or wait until August.  It depends whether or not I feel like actually taking pictures, or flipping the camera off!    Later tonight, I'm just gonna post stuff.  No Late Night Bloggin', since I feel like I'm going to be overdoing it.  I've got XBConnect now, so I can play my Xbox online!  Only MechAssault and Midtown Madness 3, but, hey, its better than nothing.  Look for a review (hopefully, if I can get it to work) on Digital Lust tomorrow.    And that's it for this incredibly short post.  I'm gonna go stop the pain of my finger.  Bye for now.

      My first set of lyrics is for Midtown's Give it Up, which is on the Spiderman 2 soundtrack.  It's an awesome song.  Here ya go.  This silence kills the calm Of the night I force an anxious patience Counting every beat and waiting for my turn to die  Give it up, Give it up Don't fall for the same things Give it up, Give it up Don't fall for the mistakes that I've made Don't turn away  I understand your ways Won't give it up  It's not me you're waiting for Alright, stop waiting It's not me you're waiting for This is where it ends It's not me you're waiting for It's time to let go, time to let go And if you promise to forget I'll try to find a way to make the same mistakes  And when You become All you've lost Wandering the streets and searching for a place to die.  Check for new lyrics every once and a while, and be sure to come back to Blog of Bagel tonight for more stuff.

      Yes, I've made it already... I'm now on my 100th post here on Blogger, and it came really quick.  Let me take a minute to reminisce the past month on Blogger:  It hasn't been too long since I signed up.  Maybe a month or less.  With Digital Lust accumilating 4 posts every day, Monday through Friday, and Blog of Bagel getting maybe 2 or 3 a day, I'm not too surprised that I made it this quick.  We've seen three Absolute Boredisms (and I was expecting much, much more by now), two eBay Hunters, and now, tonight, the sixth Late Night Bloggin'.  I've complained several times, and written about 30,000 words.  Yes, it's been quite a month.  If I can accumilate that much in that short amount of time, how will the rest of the year be?  I plan on keeping this thing for a long time to come.  Then, when I feel like I'm done blogging, I'll print these posts out and save them for all eternity.  My teen years are something I want to remember, and this blog thing definitely helps the cause.  Who knows.  Some day, Blog of Bagel may become a published work?  Doubt it, but, hey, you never know what the future holds.  And now, onto tonight's edition of Late Night Bloggin'.  Tonight I'm going to look at just two blogs, and then call it quits for the night.  So, here are your two blogs for the night.   See you in Hell!  Link:  urlLink Click Here  Rating: **  While this one's title is pretty interesting, the blog itself isn't.  Her latest entry, dated tonight, is about Fahrenheit 9/11, and the issues she has with it.  She posted the picture of some chick, and claimed she was hotter than the girl in the picture.  Let's see some pics see if you really live up to that!  This blog is run by two people, Sara and aimeeorleans.  Its the first blog that I have run across that is by two people, so its pretty interesting.  But, hopefully, I'll find one better.   BlogBlogBlog  Link:  urlLink Click Here!  Rating: **  This guy just signed up for Blogger a couple days ago.  His dog, Beta, was sick, but he took her to the vet and she's doing better.  In the post before that, he mentioned that he sent a guy a video of how to complete a rubiks cube for a gmail invite.  Now, I'm not even that crazy, but, he did it.  And, in his first post, he asks, "I Wonder What Other People are Blogging About?"  Well, guess what dude... We're blogging all about you.  Congratulations.  And that's it for Late Night Bloggin'.  In other things to blog about, I worked about an hour tonight, got 3 files completed, and got about $60 doing so, which is awesome for only working an hour.    And, that's it.  Here's to another 100 posts.  That's it from me for tonight.  Tomorrow, Digital Lust gets 4 brand new posts to end another week, and it will be closed on Monday and Tuesday of next week, so I will have Saturday posts this week.  And, tomorrow morning, I start posting my favorite song lyrics here.  So, be sure to check this place out tomorrow morning.  Tomorrow's lyrics are for Midtown's Give it Up, from the Spiderman 2 soundtrack.  It's a great song, I like it, and it's one of the best that I've heard in a while.  I'll see you here tomorrow for more Blog of Bagel action!  Adios!

      Many people have probably wondered why I haven't said anything about my musical preferences here before.  Well, that's because mainly, I'm too freakin' lazy to turn on my media player.  So, this new monthly feature will tell you what I'm listening to.  So, here's my first list for this month:  5. Midtown- Give it Up 4. Hoobastank- Did You 3. lostprophets- Lucky You 2. Yellowcard- Gifts and Curses 1. Incubus- Drive  Most of those are from the Spiderman 2 soundtrack, which actually turned out pretty good, for a movie soundtrack.  And that's what I'm listening to now.  Blog of Bagel LIVE is coming at the end of the month.  Every day from July 19-22, expect audio posts that will start off with "Coming to you LIVE from ______ in Orlando, FL..."  This is because all of my posts will be audio while I'm off at camp, and since I'm addicted to the Bl0gg3r, I want to make it sound good.  I'll have at least two posts a day, maybe three, depending on when I have my "hidden cell phone" segments, where my unsuspecting yearbook buddies may do something stupid and have it on audioblog!  Its something creative and original, and I can't wait to try it!  Later tonight, join me for my 100th post on Blogger.  It'll have Late Night Bloggin and more.  It'll be around 11:30 tonight, depending on when I get done with work.  So, enjoy!

      Me and Adam were talking, and out of nowhere, he started talking about someone that was on the news, named Marilou Yingling.  That's a weird name, right?  Yeah.  I would have to kill myself if my last name was that.  Then I would change my last name.  Anywho.  This week started off really bad, and now its one of the better weeks of my summer, and I haven't done anything to promote this being the best week.  I'll probably be coming at you live from Universal Studios on Saturday, but I don't know yet.  I'll audioblog it if I am, but, I may not go.  I want to, but, my parents may not be going down there this weekend.  We'll see what happens.  It's too dang hot to be hanging around these theme parks, in my opinion.    I'll be reaching my 100th post on Blogger pretty soon.  It's hard to believe that I have gotten this far already, but, hey, by the end of the year, what will be in store for this blog?  Too addicted teh B10gg3r!    So Shortney got a job...is that motivating me at all to get one?  Hell no.  I'm too damn lazy!  I'm still doing some of that typing for my mom, but, come this fall, I'm going to have to find one.    That's it for now.  Expect Late Night Bloggin' later tonight.  Adios!

      Welcome to another installment of eBay Hunter, here on Blog of Bagel.  Today we're going to be taking a look at 4 auctions, and I'll give you my thoughts on each of them.  We'll look at two auctions from the category of Totally Bizarre, one from Really Weird, and one from DVD/Movies.  So, let's get straight to it.  Here's your eBay Hunter goodness for the day:   Human Skull. Medical Specimen. Perfect. 32 Teeth.  Category: Totally Bizarre Link:  urlLink Click here.   Holy crap.  This guy is auctioning an actual human skull.  Could it be fake?  Very possibly.  Should he really charge over $300 for something that is probably fake? Probably not.  This auction could be considered illegal, because he's auctioning parts of the human body.  eBay stopped this auction once, and this time, warns them not to, because it follows the eBay guidelines.     Six Great Presidential Dollar Bills  Category: Totally Bizarre Link:  urlLink Click it.   Oh god.  I smell fakeness.  Is there a such thing as a $2,001 bill?  I don't think so.  For two dollars, you can get a presidential dollar bill with..well, a president on it.  The newest ones are the Ronald Reagan one, and George W., of course.  The Reagan and Bush ones are in color, and the back of the Bush one is all about September 11th, with color images of the Twin Towers, of the NY FD, PD, and EMS, and a picture of the Pentagon.    These are definitely the kind of auction that only political fans would be interested in, because it has their favorite presidents, on a fake dollar bill.  My advice: skip this one.  I don't even know why I mentioned it.   Unsearched Barrels of Uncut Sapphire  Category: Really Weird Link:  urlLink  Click Here   Liar!  This can't be true.  That sapphire looks like the exact same thing my sister got when she went on a "shopping spree" in the Bahamas and got a sapphire as a free gift.  This one is definitely the biggest fake I have covered thus far in my entire eBay Hunter career.  Don't fall for this one.  This person claims to have barrels of them just lying around in her family's underground mine, or something, and also has other stones of great value.  They're either counterfeit, or someone enjoyed the Bahamas shopping spree for several days.   Spiderman 2 Auctions!!!  Category: DVD & Movies Link:  urlLink Click it.   Holy freakin' crap.  They are auctioning off limited edition posters, props from the movie, and all sorts of other Spiderman 2 stuff.  I'm not going to participate, because I don't have a credit card and my parents won't let me bid on things.  So, oh well.  But, some of the stuff they have here is great.  The prices of the posters are absolutely insane (almost $300 for one of them), and I didn't look at props, but, if the posters were that high, then I can't imagine what the props are.  And, this is Sony's auctions, too, so it's definitely something to check out if you're like me, being a huge Spiderman fan.   ----------------  That's it for eBay Hunter today.  I'm getting ready to begin today's Digital Lust updates, because I'm running behind and would like to get them done early today.  Check back here tonight for some new stuff, like Late Night Bloggin Vol VI, and other things I'll post, probably.  See ya next time.

      Welcome to Late Night Bloggin, Volume V.  You may be wondering, what the hell happened to that eBay Hunter that was promised!?  My stupid satellite connection died out, so I will have that feature tomorrow.  Before we begin our Late Night Bloggin' journeys for tonight, there's some other things to talk about.   Holy Thunder!  Just got through one of the worst thunderstorms we've had this year.  Our garage started flooding (not as bad as last year, when they flooded about 5 inches high, 2 weeks after we had just moved in...wet boxes full of stuff everywhere).  My dog is absolutely scared, even though the storm has practically passed.  The water from the flooding is already gone, but, there is more to come...I know it.  Dog is not sleeping in my room tonight!  I may wake up to no more door in the morning!   Monopoly  My brother, sister, and I decided to play Monopoly while the TV and internet was all down.  For the first time, I actually beat my brother, who is actually pretty good at it, despite the fact that's he's really stupid and immature.  He was only able to score 4 properties, my sister 2, and me, 12.  I kept winning the money in the middle like crazy!  It wasn't only the first time that I beat my brother, but the first time that I've actually won...at all.  Yeah, I suck.    And now...onto tonight's Late Night Bloggin'!    Archaeopteryx´s Blog  Link:  urlLink Click Here   This blog is new, the guy has only been a member for a couple days.  He has posted pictures of his pet hedgehog (I would love to have one of those), posted a random picture of Cartman from the South Park, and lyrics to a Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory song.  Yeah... kinda boring, but, hey, oh well.  I like to have a real hedgehog...that would kick some serious ass.  But anyway...dude, your posts need more.  You're kinda boring.  More pictures of that hedgehog should satisfy me.    He runs a gaming message board, called "Seriously!" which is pretty cool, but, only if you're one of those people who likes message boards.  Anyway, this is an okay blog, but, I've read better.   NickBlog  Link:  urlLink Click it   Wow, this guy has been around since September 2002, and his blog isn't that bad, either.  His most recent post is about how he had friends over for dinner, what he cooked, and how they "enjoyed a few smokes."  He thinks that John Kerry is a deusche bag, but...he's going to vote for him anyway.  Some of his posts are kinda pointless, but, they're still pretty cool all the same.  This blog is alright, and, for being around since September 2002, I'm pretty dang impressed.  I sure hope to keep this blog going that long.   Blog Experiment  Link:  urlLink Click   This one is apparently going to use her blog to bitch about her boss, because that's exactly what she did in tonight's post.  She just started using her blog this week, and she tonight bitched about her boss.  Meh...this one's boring.  And, that's all for Late Night Bloggin' tonight.  Be sure to check back here tomorrow, because in the morning, I'm going to be posting eBay Hunter #2, and then, 4 brand new Digital Lust updates, just for you.  Yippee.  Enjoy it.  That's all from me.  Go to sleep or something, because sleep is nice.  Sleep is good.  And I'm spent.

      This has got to be the hottest summer in Florida in a long time.  The thermometer on my Weatherbug told me around 2:00 that it was 99 degrees!  Holy hotness!  So, of course, I stayed here, and if I plan to go out tomorrow, then I'm gonna have to not ride the bike (I'm getting good with the tricks, but its too dang hot to ride it).  Anyway, today was a much better day than the past two days.  I think the whole summer boredism thing is starting to wear off as I head into this busy time of my summer... driving days on Monday and Tuesday.  Universal next Wednesday.  Then, Monday after next, Yearbook camp starts, and I come back on Thursday.  Then, Friday, I leave really early for New York, stopping in North Carolina on the way up.  Then, I come back on August 2nd, and school starts on August 9th.  My boring summer is FINALLY, FINALLY over, and the fun part now begins.  By the way, I'm posting this part because of an incident that happened last year: I CANNOT FORGET MY BIRTHDAY THIS YEAR.  I will be posting this on a regular basis to avoid what happened last year, when I...well, forgot my birthday.  It was definitely a weird day, and I'm not sure how it was that I forgot it, but, oh well.  And, also, a list of extra stuff I'm taking to the workshop with me, so I can remember that:  Extra Mouse Mouse Pad Xbox Games Yearbook DVDs  I'll be posting that list too alot until I leave for camp, because I read through my blog a lot, and the closer it is to the top, the better.  So, I'm not going to forget either my birthday or the extra stuff I need.    Anyway, something weird has been going on with Blogger, and it's been bad... I'm not thinking about switching blog providers (I'm still too addicted to teh B10gg3r!).  But, hopefully they fix it soon, because I haven't been able to load this site correctly most of the time.  It's just typical site problems, I'm sure, but, hopefully it'll be fixed soon.  That's it from me for now.  I'll be back in about 1/2 an hour with a brand new eBay Hunter, and then later tonight for Late Night Bloggin'.  See ya then!

      Just so you know, the whole bagel.tech closing thing was part of the tip that I'm writing for tomorrow, how you can create a new blog and move things back and forth.  It's a long tip, I'll go over it tomorrow.  It got a new name in the process, and the site will relaunch tomorrow.  It's now called Digital Lust, and it's going to be much better than before.  It's going to cover more of the interweb, including web videos, cartoons, and more...it's going to be much bigger, and you guys will definitely love it.  There will continue to be 4 posts a day, and there will be more to see than ever before.  Be sure to check out Digital Lust when it launches tomorrow.  All the posts from bagel.tech are going to be imported into the new site, and the search bars and everything are going to be there, ready to be used.  And, in other news, my bad day seems to getting better (and, right before I head to bed), and hopefully, tomorrow will be a much better day.  After tomorrow's Digital Lust updates, I'm going to go out to my friend's bike track and just chill for a few hours.  I've needed to get away for such a long time, and I need to tomorrow, or else I will officially declare this summer to be the worst summer ever.  Digital Lust, anyway, will feature all new content, like cartoons, web videos, and even game reviews and previews.  I'm going to make the Gmail Giveaway at both sites, and the Blog of Bagel Gmail Giveaway will happen after the Digital Lust Gmail Giveaway, when I get a second set of invites.  You have to see the new content that I have planned, because it's going to be bigger than ever before.  Digital Lust is coming, and be sure to check it out.    No Late Night Bloggin' tonight, I need to get some sleep.  So, tomorrow, be sure to check out Digital Lust for updates, and more from me here.  Until next time, adios.

      Well, I woke up this morning in a better mood, but, now, I'm just so freakin' irritated that I can't stand it.  Part of it has to do with me having continuous chores around the house, when my brother and sister just sit on their asses all day doing absolutely nothing.  Part of it has to do with one particular person, and I'm not going to say anymore about that.  And part of it has to do with my brother complaining that I have one of his videogames, despite me tearing apart my bedroom looking for it, and did not find it.  I really just want to get away, take a break, and recover from this "worst summer ever." And I can't do that until July 19th, when I leave for Yearbook Camp.  I just hope my fellow staffers are ready to deal with a perkier David, because it'll probably be one of the rarest occasions now when I'll be in a good mood.  What really sucks about my life coming up is the fact that my brother is going to be coming to my school, and that's just going to suck.  He has got the worst attitude, thinking that he is better than everyone else.  He thinks he's just going to make my senior year the worst thing that ever happened to me, thinking that he can pick on a senior.  He's got another thing coming.  But, if anyone does anything to him, of course, my parents are going to yell at me for it, since it will probably be one of my friends that does it to him in the first place.  I'm absolutely going to hate my senior year, despite what he does or doesn't do.    I wanna go fall asleep for a while, hopefully I'll be in a better mood for some Late Night Bloggin', but, if not, don't blame me.

      For those who read bagel.tech today, you will know that I have decided to shut that site down.  It's inactive, it's not working, and I don't like it.  I'm going to be putting my new blog there, and porting the bagel.tech posts over here in a few days.  So, here's a few things you need to know about what's going to be coming to Blog of Bagel soon:   Blog of Bagel Gmail Contest  I'm going to keep doing the Gmail contest, but moving it over here and changing the rules around a little bit.  Look for new details later on.   More Posts  Now without bagel.tech, time will come in a larger package, so expect more new features coming here in no time.  Posts will get more interesting once school starts, so until then, check out what I have for you here anyway.  Audio posts when I'm out of town, and computer posts when I'm here.    That's pretty much all... I'm going to be putting a lot more time into this site to make it better, and you can expect more from Blog of Bagel in the coming weeks.

      I seem to be a little more awake this morning.  I'm waiting on a download to finish so I can review it for bagel.tech (yippee?), and it's taking a while.  But, anyway, I'm also in a better mood it seems like.  Yesterday was just one of those days where I get really irritated at the smallest things.  And that doesn't happen too often with me.  1 month and 3 days to go until school starts... and it doesn't seem to be coming any faster.  Things are starting to slow down again.  I thought today was going to be Friday when I woke up, but no.  It's only Tuesday.  Thinking about another school year starting is hard to believe...so much is going to be different there this year, and, it's my last year of school.  All of the senior privileges are going to start, and its going to feel weird when it does.    I keep flashing back to my life in Ocala, for some reason.  Every time I think about something, my friends from back there are suddenly in the picture.  I think its about time I finally go back there and see what's been going on.  It's been forever since I've seen any of them.  In fact, its been since October 2001 since I saw any of them.  Hard to believe its been that long, but, I think its about time for a visit.    You may remember a few weeks ago when I said I was going to download that America's Army game.  Well, that download failed, and this Leech Get thing may help me get it.  I'm going to go test it out and review it on my other blog, so be sure to check it out.  Until next time, stay unbored.

      Welcome to tonight's Late Night Bloggin', where I take a look at 2 blogs tonight, and either praise them or make fun of them.  That's all that I'm doing tonight, since I'm too tired to post anything else.  So, let's get right to it:   тнє єиD оf тнє тімє  Link:  urlLink тнє єиD оf тнє тімє   Heh, this one is funny because I can't understand it.  Everything about it is strange, sometimes, the posts aren't even in English, but, most of them are... this is the dumbest blog I have looked at so far... and that's all I want to say about it.   Soy in Tokyo  Link:  urlLink Click it   Here's another Japan-based blog... this one is written by a girl who is living with a Japanese family over the summer for 2 months, and some of the posts are actually interesting.  She talks about the people that are in Tokyo, and what they are like, and gives a better insight to what life is really like in that country.  This is one of the better blogs that I have looked at since I started this little event, and its one that should definitely be checked out.  Sorry for the lack of update today... I've been so bored that I can't even think about anything to post about.  In fact, even posts that I did make (like this one) were incredibly short, and I do hope to change that tomorrow by making more posts.  So, look for more of me tomorrow, hopefully I'll be in a little better of a mood, and things can go back to normal.  Until next time, go to sleep.  That's where I'm heading.

      I've had nothing to do ever since I got done with today's bagel.tech updates.  I went to pick up my sister from the mall (and saw people I knew, like Marissa Johnson and a few others), and that's all I've done since I finsihed bagel.tech today.  I don't want to lose interest in this blog!!!  I need stuff to talk about.  So tomorrow, I'll be going on location to somewhere else, and probably doing an audio post from that place.  I don't know yet, but, I want to get bagel.tech done early, just so that I can go.    So, this I Could be Asleep thing.  It's the name of my old blog, back in my days of Xanga.  I had plans to start porting posts from that old blog to here, but, a lot of them were mysteriously gone... good thing I like Blogger better.  It just might be the best blogging software on the whole entire interweb.  And speaking of Blogger, I kicked off this week's Blogger week at bagel.tech with a tip on how to create a search bar so people can search your posts, like you can see on both of my blogs.  It's a really cool tip, go check it out, because its the first step in making your blog better.    And, about a third blog.  I'm working on how I want to do it, and the temporary title of it is going to be "Bagel 3."  It's going to be the last blog in the series of the Bagel's Blog network, and I have no idea what its going to be.  But, I'm going to go ahead and start constructing it, but, you won't see anything until August.  I want to have enough time to create a purpose for the blog.  It's not going to be a videogame blog, or even a movies blog, like I've been thinking about, but, it's going to be something very different.  Look for more details in the coming future.  I could be asleep right now, but, I have to stay up to do tonight's Late Night Bloggin', which is taking the world by storm.  As far as I'm concerned, there are several different people looking at this blog for the shear purpose of my Late Night Bloggin', mainly because their blog has been featured (either that, or my advertising is working, and I've been advertising a lot lately).    That's it for this edition of Blog of Bagel.  I'll be back later tonight with Late Night Bloggin', so, check it out.

      Welcome to tonight's edition of Late Night Bloggin', where I take random blogs from all over the interweb, and post what I think about them.  I can praise them, make fun of them, whatever.  But its all in good fun, so if I make fun of your blog, then I don't really mean it.  Anyway, let's get to it.  After I'm done presenting these 4 blogs (yes, 4, since I fell asleep before I could post last night), I'm going to talk about fireworks, and what happened.   Uninterest: The Most Boring Place on the Web  Link:  urlLink Uninterest   Uh oh...looks like someone is trying to compete against me for the most boring place on the whole wide interweb.  Now, I know I don't have the most boring blog (its actually really interesting, every time I go back and read what I've said), but, I try to think that it is.  So, properly, I'm going to make fun of this one.  His posts are short, incredibly boring, and his design is really girly.  He uses the dots dark template, which is available here directly on teh Bl0gg3r.  He's had his blog for not even a week.  His posts range from "Wow, I saw fireworks at the lake," to "I played Warcraft 3 today."  Guess what?!  This blog is officially the most boring blog it has even been my pleasure to stumble across!  Congrats, you receive the Blog of Bagel Boring Blog award for tonight!  Be sure to post that on your blog somewhere.   Big in Tokyo  Link:  urlLink Click it.   This girl I guess recently moved to Tokyo, and talks about her life there.  Her most recent post is called "Cockroaches and Tomatoes," and she starts off by saying that she rode her bike for the first time in Tokyo.  She uses big vocabulary words that would take me a century to understand (sarcastically, of course), and she seems like she's a person of the older, maybe 20-25 years old.  This blog is pretty boring, but, hey, if you wrote a post about how you rode your bike through Tokyo for the first time, what would you want me to call it?   I hate Blog  Link:  urlLink Click it.   This, by far, has to be the stupidest blog I have ever stumbled across in the whole world.  If the post isn't in English, it's Japanese, and when it's English, all it contains is a quote from someone.  He's got a picture of what looks like Tokyo in it, and all over the blog, signs of "I hate Blog" can be seen.  Who can hate teh bl0gg3r?!  It's the most addicting thing I've ever done in my life!  Congratulations, you have won the award for "Worst blog looked at...ever!"   Glutton's Photo-a-Day  Link:  urlLink Click here for the Glutton.   This has got to be the best blog that I have looked at for this nightly feature thus far...though, I'm not agreeing with the name.  Could this person be a glutton?!  Anyway, this is a photo-blog, and whoever took these pictures (didn't bother reading the profile), has some incredible photography skills.  There are some pictures (not all, but some) that are really, really good, and this is a blog to definitely check out.  The person behind this blog wins the Best Blog award for tonight.  Congratulations, young glutton photo taker.  You have proven to be one of the best blogs that I've seen on the entire interweb.  And that's it for Late Night Bloggin'.  Now on to tonight's regularly scheduled post, Holy Fireworks! -----------------------  So, my dad and brother decide to go and buy fireworks and let them off the dock tonight.  So they did, and they came back with this set of missile like things.  Well, little did we know that they were going to scatter all over the yard, sending flames and stuff hurling towards the house.  No fire (which is good, because if you ever saw my house, you'd hope it never caught on fire), but, it was dangerous, and leaves me with one quick paraphrase of a popular cartoon quote:  "Fireworks night is a very dangerous night."  That had to be the highlight of the night.  Tomorrow, bagel.tech starts anew with Blogger and Photoshop week.  That's right, you're getting 2 tips a day, one for Photoshop and one for Blogger.  I'm going to help Blogger users make their blogs look even better.    That's it for Blog of Bagel tonight.  Time for me to fall asleep.  I've done a lot of interweb posting today, and now I'm taking a break.  So, until tomorrow, remember that fireworks are dangerous, and so is posting your blog on the Blogger directory, because I might be coming to YOURS next.

      I may have a few tricks up my sleeve for the 4 individuals who will be sharing the room with me at camp this year.  Mwahahahaha.  That's why it's going to be fun.  I've been working long and hard on a "revenge" system that shall be used whenever any 4 of them (and they know exactly who they are...one may not even step out of line at all, and he knows who he is).  Now, because they're more than likely going to read this blog sometime before camp, I'm not going to give any details about my "revenge" system.  They won't know when to expect any of it...it's just going to happen.  And they can't be prepared...because there's no way possible.  Thank god I'll have my camera this year.    Those who don't know (and should, if they read my profile), I'm going to be going to something called "Camp Orlando," which is a yearbook seminar that's held by my school's yearbook publishing company.  I'm going to be taking a class called "Desktop 5," which will give me some awesome tips for Photoshop (and I have last year's still, so look for my upcoming Photoshop tips on bagel.tech in the near future).  I'll be gone from the 19-22.  Now, you may be wondering.  No Blog of Bagel those days?!  Well, that's wrong.  I will be blogging, through the use of Audioblogger (which I've just started today).  Expect a couple posts per day, and a couple of them won't even have my voice, possibly...can anyone say Candid Blog Post?  Lol.  That should be fun.  And, when I come back on the 22nd, I'll post pictures that I take to go along with the Audio Posts, and then, I leave again on the 23rd, and if I'm blogging through Audioblogger then, then I'll be surprised myself.    But anyway.  Last year, camp was pretty cool...I can remember it all like it was just yesterday, when in fact...it was almost a year ago.  A couple of our female yearbook staffers were in me and Adam's room, just hanging out, and around 2:00 in the morning, someone came knocking on the door.  So, they ran off and hid in the closet, and I hid under the bed.  Yes.  I hid from someone in my own freakin' room.  How stupid was that?  Turns out we're still laughing about it whenever the subject is brought up.  One of the girls (who is no longer on staff), even reminded me in my yearbook where she signed.  Yes, last year's workshop was full of craziness, and this year is going to be twice as bad.  Trust me.  Now, not only will me and Adam be in the same room, but Adam's brother Jonny, Crandall (aka Alex), and Jarred (whom I don't know that well), are going to be there, and they're all the craziest people I think my school has ever had on the yearbook staff.  This year, they're having it at the Sheraton World Resort on I-Drive in Orlando.  It's near Sea World, but, when they give us our "free time," we're going to Islands of Adventure instead.  I'd call Amanda and have her come see me, but, it's probably not such a good idea...too much tension between her and other people on staff.  (Amanda is a girl who recently moved to Orlando from The River, we were good friends).  But, I may be going to Universal later this week, so it would be better to see her then instead of when I go for camp.    Well, anyway, fireworks should be starting soon.  I'm not going.  But, I will be posting an AudioBlog of Bagel post later on tonight, for your enjoyment.  Then, later tonight here on teh bl0gg3r, I'm going to be posting an all new Late Night Bloggin', where I'll take a look at 4 blogs, since I skimped out last night.  Then, tomorrow, everything goes back to normal with bagel.tech, where its Blogger week.  So, stick around for more Blog of Bagel, because I'm going to be either praising or making fun of blogs, so be sure to check it out!  Also, if you don't want your blog to be on Late Night Bloggin', take it off the directory, because, you never know when I could just show up at your blog and do some Late Night Bloggin'.  So, see you later!

      Well, here you go, the first edition of AudioBlog.     Post Notes  -Audioblogger -bagel.tech and Blog of Bagel This Week -Construction  This is my first time using the software to create a lengthy post, so my voice sounds funny.  I'll make sure it sounds better next time I use it.    urlLink

      I fell asleep a little early last night, so there wasn't an edition of Late Night Bloggin', like I promised.  So I'm going to have one tonight.  I'm feeling not my best today, either... so I'm really, really tired.  I'm going to get the work done that I promised, and then I may fall asleep again.  I've got no plans for the Fourth of July, so I can get it done.  There's only 2 weeks from tomorrow until my vacation starts...the first four days are going to be spent with my yearbook staff, at our annual summer workshop thing.  Then, I have one day at home before I head up to New York (by car, which blows).  I think I mentioned yesterday that I'm stopping at the Paramount Carowinds park in North Carolina, and then, after I visit my family, we're going to the Six Flags in Darien Lake up there. So, from July 19-August 2nd, basically, expect a lot of Audioblog of Bagel posts (the first one is tonight), but no bagel.tech.  By the way, if you haven't been there since I reopened it, take a look at it, because it looks a lot better with that new design.  I have no idea how I'm going to keep up with blogging once school starts.  It'll probably happen where I won't be able to have a post every day, and I don't want that to happen!  The Blogger is too addicting, even when you have no life!    Well, then.  I'm going to get to work on the minor construction that's going to be taking place.  Remember, this place is getting an all new comment system, and other addons as I find them, so check back later today to interact with the site in its new form.  To get a preview of the new commenting system and some of the tweaked features, check out bagel.tech, as it's already completed (but no new design here).  So, until later today, adios.

      Welcome to the first edition of eBay hunter, the newest series of posts here on Blog of Bagel.  This new feature (which could, and probably should go on bagel.tech, but, I want it here instead), will show you some of the most...interesting auctions I have seen on eBay.  Normally, I'll post one from the "Totally Bizarre" category, one from the "Videogames" category, one from the "DVD and Movies" category, and then something else.  I'm going to only do this once a week, since I feel like I'm going to be overdoing some of the features that I'm doing.    Now, on to tonight's eBay auctions.  We'll start with the "Totally Bizarre" one, which...is, really...totally bizarre.  Here we go.   Totally Bizarre: Design your own Diploma  Link:  urlLink Click Here!   This one is weird because you can make your own college or University diploma, right from your own computer.  Yeah, its the easy way to say you graduated from college.  This isn't the most bizarre thing I've seen, but...wait until next time.  As of press time, there is about 9 days and 22 hours left on this auction.    Videogames: Playstation 1 with Memory Cards and Stuff  Link:  urlLink Click here!  This one is cool because at a starting price of $26.95, you can get a PSone console, 3 games, and a memory card.  If you're looking for a PSone, this is the best deal, in my opinion.   DVDs and Movies: Family Guy DVD Set: All 50 Episodes  Link:  urlLink Click here.  I like this one because its Family Guy.  The second greatest cartoon on the face of this planet, and if I was allowed to, I would buy it in a heartbeat.  It contains all 50 episodes of the show, which is awesome.  Well, that's it for this edition of eBay Hunter.  Next time, I'll have a funny auction from the bizarre section, one you're never going to forget!  Until then, check out Late Night Bloggin', later on tonight.

      Literally.  I have realized that I have nothing better to do in my life than sit around and blog all day.  That's why I've been a member here for three weeks and already have 62 posts or so.  That's like, a record for the most blog entries in 3 weeks or so.  So, as you probably read in another post, I'm going to open up another blog, that will only be updated like once or twice a week (like this was originally supposed to be).  So, I'm going to begin thinking of ideas for this new blog, and its going to be something original for a blog.  No, it's not going to be a blog about sex stories (ha, like I have any anyway), but, it's going to be something different.  Way different.  Anyway.  The new design at Bagel.Tech is up and running, and I'm even considering a name change on it soon...not sure what I'm going to change it to, but Bagel.Tech sounds kinda lame.  I'll keep you posted on that.  The whole search thing worked out great, and I just installed a newer comment system, which I'll also be porting over here tomorrow.  This place may be running a little funny early in the morning, but, I'm going to try and have the major work done on it by noon.  As you can see, the Tagboard is gone (it's pointless to have it), and everything looks better.  Especially at bagel.tech.  This place isn't going to get a new design, but, there are some changes being made tomorrow.  Join me later tonight for the first installment of eBay Hunter and a brand new Late Night Bloggin', which you'll now be able to find on a nightly basis!  So, until then, don't be a David, go find something to do!

      Well, I've been working really hard lately.  This blog now has its own search feature (so you can search for posts that I made without having to go into the archives...its awesome), plus, a new poll of the week, and, I'm nowhere near done yet.  I'm going to be looking around for all sorts of oddities and things to be putting on both blogs.  Bagel.tech is the one that's going to be getting the major overhaul though...I'm exporting all of the custom HTML for my extra addons, so I can re-import them when I get the new skin put in.  So basically, everything at bagel.tech is going to be disfunctional for a while today...but, I'm not sure when.  I'm still planning on putting a new counter, possibly a new guestbook, and something new and awesome that you're going to want to see.  My DVD collection!  Yep, I'm signing up with DVD Aficionado to provide the readers of Blog of Bagel with a look at my collection.  w00t.    Anyway, just thought I'd give you guys a heads up on what's going on, since we're going to be working throughout the remainder of the weekend to provide an even better bagel's blog system.  I want to include more interactivity between the two blogs, and even get started on the design of a new blog, but I have no idea what it would be about yet.  We'll see what happens.  Join me later tonight for some new posts.  But until then, glance cautiously at the new features being put in.

      Howdy there, and welcome to another Late Night Bloggin'.  Tonight, I'm really going to get things cooking by looking at two blogs and saying stuff about them.  But first, a final word about Spiderman 2.  I beat the last boss, and he was tough as fucking hell.  I hope I never experience anything like that in a videogame for as long as I live.  Now, on to Late Night Bloggin':   My Boring Chit Chat  This girl is just like me, I think...she tends to have no life, because her little disclaimer states that you may come across something interesting at some point.  Hmm...very interesting.  But, anywho.  Tonight, she writes about how she was playing Scategories with modified rules...hmm.  Very interesting.  Not.  Hey, Jenn, maybe we should get together and share boredism some time!  We both seem to have a lot of that in common!  But, anyway.  She also started talking about dead guys masterbating, and that was kind of sick, but, oh well.  Let her talk about what she wants to.  Then, browsing through other posts...she went to the batting cages on Monday because the minigolf was closed.  Overall, I'd say this blog was pretty boring, but, so am I.  At least I try to keep it unboring by posting stuff about other peoples' blogs, which isn't a bad idea, I've heard.  Half Time: And now, a quick break to tell what's been going on.  Marlon Brando died.  Yeah, he was the guy from The Godfather.  That's a shame, he was a good actor.  But, he was getting old, too...so, I guess it was time.  By the way, I'm going to be doing some repair work on bagel.tech this weekend, with possibly the new permanent design.  Everything will remain intact, but, it will take me a bit of time to get things done.  I'm also doing away with the whole Tagboard thing, and possibly replacing it with some new features.  It's obviously not the kind of thing that is needed in a blog.  So, look for some all new stuff this weekend both here and bagel.tech.  And finally, the third and possibly final blog in my series is coming.  It's one that won't be updated every day like these are.  I'm not sure what its going to be yet, but, I'll figure it out and launch it within the next week.  It'll probably be a once a week thing, but, I'm not sure what I'm going to do, like I said.  It's not going to be something nerdy.  (Yeah, I'd like to see me keep to that promise).  And now, back to Late Night Bloggin'.   Across the Digital Divide  This one is by an older person, who is about 40 years old, so you have to expect this to be boring.  Well...it is. He is writing about his trip across I-40 through the United States.   His most recent post is about the Oklahoma City Bombing Memorial.  Most of his posts are about news and stuff.  Could this guy bore us to death even more?  Well, I can see why he's doing it, (so he can probably print it out when he comes home to remember everything), but, this blog is pretty much boring to anyone who isn't him, or anyone who doesn't like pictures of various places across the US.  Maybe if he stopped at a strip club and took pictures of hot girls stripping, then it would be more interesting.  But, he hasn't yet, so, damn it, this blog is boring.  Sorry dude, but, that's the way it is.  And those are tonight's Late Night Bloggin' blogs of not-interest.  Maybe next time I'll stumble across something a little more interesting.  But, until then, you can check out other people's blogs by searching through BlogSpot and Blogger themselves.  Tomorrow, I'll post something in the morning, if I feel like it, and then have some late night stuff, but no Late Night Bloggin'.  Its going to be a once a week thing, I think.    But, before I go.  Summer is starting to speed by quicker than I can imagine it.  It's already the beginning of July!  I've counted, and there is only 17 days until I leave for Yearbook camp, and, like you've probably heard me say in the past, it is probably going to be the highlight of my summer vacation.  Then, I get to go up north, stopping in North Carolina at the Paramount Carowinds park, and then to Six Flags Darien Lake in New York.  Then, I'll get back right in time for preparations for school's great beginning...the beginning of my senior year.  And now, that is it for Late Night Bloggin': Volume II.  Until tomorrow, get some sleep.  It's late.

      Well, I've seen the movie.  I've completed the game.  So now, Spiderman 2 hype is officially over.   Warning, if you plan on seeing Spiderman 2 or playing the game, please, do not read on, because I'm going to go through the entire story.   The Movie: Alright, Spidey's back with an all new villain and an all new, incredibly good storyline, which kicks the crap out of the first one.  The villain is Doc Ock, and he helps Harry Osborn determine who killed his father in the first movie.  It all begins with another mysterious lab accident, in which Dr. Octavius is demonstrating how the sun can be used to harness power, with the use of his nifty little tentacle product.  But, Peter Parker determines a disturbance in the demo, so he quickly runs off, changes into his Spidey costume, and goes in, right before things start going wrong, and Dr. Octavius's wife Rosie is killed.  Dr. Octavius thinks its Spiderman's fault, so he sets out to kill him.  So when he actually catches Spiderman, he takes him to Harry, who unveils the mask...and now, Harry knows that Spiderman is his best friend Peter Parker.  This movie was EXCELLENT.  It's making me drool for the third one, but, I'm not sure when that's going to happen...hopefully within the next two years.  All I know is that now, I have a new favorite movie.  The Game: The game closely follows the storyline of the movie, but makes it even bigger by adding villains like Shocker, Mysterio, and Rhino, into it to make it a little longer.  Unlike the first game, in this one, you can websling all around New York City, which is a nice perk.  It is nicely detailed, because you can reach the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building, and, at Ground Zero, there are two beams of light where the Twin Towers stood.  There is so much to do.  Even after you beat the story mode of the game, you're only 50% done, because there is so much more to be completed, that you'll spend more time on that than you did with the story part of the game.  There are supposedly some really cool little addons, but, I haven't gotten that far yet.  I'm just at the final battle of the story mode.  And it is HARD.  I hope I beat it tonight!  So now, I'm going to be making some changes, the first one being a picture change.  Am I going to reveal myself to the masses?  Probably not.  But, a new picture will be in the profile beginning tomorrow.  As for my other Spidey stuff, I'm going to keep it around for a little bit, because I'm thinking about seeing the movie again real soon...  And that's it for this week's Nerdular Nerdance.  I don't know what I'll post for this next week.  But, you may be wondering: where the hell did you find the words Nerdular Nerdance?  Well...here's an explanation for ya.  I was watching the latest edition of Strong Bad Email on Home Star Runner, which is one of my favorite sites around, and Strong Bad was talking about Popular Science magazine, when he said, "they might as well call it Nerdular Nerdance."  So, I decided to steal it.   Join me later tonight for tonight's edition of Late Night Bloggin', where I'll go look at someone else's blog and post stuff about it (not that I'll get negative or anything).  Until then, go do something predictable.

      I just looked on the thermometer, and it's 99 degrees out...me, who was supposed to go out to my friend's bike track, has decided to stay here, keeping a fan right on me, and not doing anything but playing Spiderman 2 and other Xbox games.  So, while I'm taking a break from that (because so much playing can kill your arms), I've decided to blog for a while...kinda like what I've been doing all day over at bagel.tech.  So, let me think about stuff to blog about...  ...all I can think about is how hot it is outside.  I live on the freakin' river, but, there's gators in there, and swimming is NOT my thing.  My fan's doing a pretty good job of keeping me somewhat cool, but, NOT GOOD ENOUGH!    Maybe I should go read someone else's blog and say stuff about it.  But no, that's reserved for Late Night Bloggin'.  Or, maybe, I could do "Absolute Hotism," but, that just sounds retarded.  Its too hot for human creation to live on this planet.  I wonder what Mars is like.  Hell, it's probably hotter there.    I would hate to live in a place like Texas, where it gets over 100 degrees in a day.  I feel bad for people who are stuck living there...especially if they don't have air conditioners...  Well, with that being said, I'm going back to play Spiderman 2.  Hopefully by the time my next post tonight comes along, I'll actually have something to talk about.  Until then, go cool down.  It's hot outside.

      Well, I've been up since about 6, thanks to the dog, who came in my room because she gets scared sometimes when it turns from dark to light outside.  Nothing unusual about that, right?  So, I've been trying to keep myself entertained, so I've been doing what I do best...play my Xbox.  I'm taking a break from the Spiderman 2 action to catch a little bit of the games that I haven't played in a while.  I have somewhere I have to be later today, so I'm going to do bagel.tech as quickly as possible.    I suppose that's it, already...nothing much to talk about.  Maybe something will come to me later.  Oh well.  Tonight, I'll have an all new Late Night Bloggin' and, if I can't find anything better to do, and Absolute Boredism, but I want to try and stay clear of that.  So, that's it.  Eyb.

      Yeah, so this isn't the latest that I've posted a post, but, things have been more important for me to do a little late night bloggin'.  So, here's what's been going on in my ever so busy life.   -My Yearbook Croonies: Yeah, I got to see my yearbook buds tonight (minus Courtney, who was in class).  Next year I will be doing the Student Life section along with Lauren, my new co-editor, and we're going to create an even better book than last year's.  So many things are going to be different though...I'm having a hard time picturing just how different its all going to be.  The thought of getting ready to start making another yearbook is just shocking to me.  We just got done with last year's!  But, hey, anyway, it was good to see everyone again, not too much has changed with them.  Everyone's heard about my little accident that I had last week (even though it seems like an eternity ago), and they all think it's "typical David stuff."  I don't blame them.  Stuff like that happens to me all the time!  -Bad Cell Phone...BAD!: I have no idea what's going on with Nextel right now, but signal used to be so good out here in The River.  But, all of a sudden, it's going dead on me, and I can't get decent cell signal anywhere.  It really sucks, because now I can't talk to people that I don't normally talk to anyway.  Hopefully they fix this problem soon, because I need my phone!  -On the Road Again: Well, after yearbook dinner tonight, my brother is at a friend's house, and has to be picked up.  My dad, who is too tired to stay awake while driving, told me to go along with him, just in case he fell asleep and needed waking up.  So, I just spent the last hour on the road, having to go all the way down Fort Island Trail about 6 miles, and then back...total, it was about a 40 mile drive.  It sucks, but, oh well, I'm back.  -Spiderman 2: So, I'm probably going to Universal on Saturday to see Spiderman 2, and get on Mummy for the first time.  I've been dying to see the movie forever, and the game that I've been playing vigorously, has become one of my favorite games of all time.  I can't wait to see it, because the game follows the storyline, and I don't want to go much further without seeing the movie.  I've heard that it was really good, but, we'll see what happens.  If I don't go on Saturday, then I'm going to have to see it in the crappy movie theater out here in The River.  -Job Hunting: I'm afraid I'm going to start having to look for a job soon...I'm doing some of that typing for my mom, but, sometimes, it's really hard to keep up with.  The people who talk sometimes talk really fast, and I have a hard time typing and listening at the same time.  I'm probably going to apply some places soon, but, we'll see.  I don't know.  Jobs require coordination, and I have none of that.  So, about this late night bloggin' thing...I may make it a series.  Yeah.  And I can go bother other peoples' blogs, and tell people about it.  Sounds like a plan.  So, look for Late Night Bloggin', once or twice a week.  Why?  Because I feel like trying something new for a change.  I'm going to update tomorrow morning, and then I'm going to cut bagel.tech into only 2 posts tomorrow, since I have somewhere I have to go earlier in the day.  So, until tomorrow, then, get some sleep.  You probably haven't gotten too much lately.

      Alright, welcome back for part 2 of my Family Guy Top 10 guide.  There's 5 episodes left that I truly like, and you guys are gonna hear about them before I get going with more of my Spiderman 2 game.  So, here are the top 5 Family Guy episodes:  5. The Son Also Draws This one is where the family decides to take a trip to New York, but ends up stopping at an Indian Casino, on the way.  Lois, who turns out to be a huge gambler, goes so far over that she ends up giving up the car.  Now what do they do?  4. Holy Crap Peter's father, who is highly religious, comes to visit, and Peter is not happy with this.  His father always used to think that he was not a good soon because he wasn't very religious.  However, after taking over his job at the toy company, and eventually becoming the boss, Peter and his father have one of those father/son moments, and his father tells him he is a good son.  3. Running Mates When the position for school superintendent comes, Lois decides to run, and Peter's old favorite teacher is fired.  So, Peter decides to run against Lois, who thinks the teacher deserved to be fired.  When Peter wins the election, he is caught giving porn magazines to Chris to look at during school, and now the job is open again.  2. To Live or Die in Dixie The Griffin family is placed in the witness protection program, and must move to a little hick town.  After discovering life is different there, they adapt to it, and Chris finds a friend.  But when this guy actually kisses Chris, Chris begins to wonder if he's gay or something.  But then, this guy actually turns out to be a girl.  Wow.  What a shocker.  1. When You Wish Upon a Weinstein Peter is having a financial crisis, so he decides he needs to find a Jew to help him out.  So, after he sings his inspriational song, I Need A Jew, he searches for one.  Then, he wants Chris to become a Jew, so he sends him to have a bar mitzvah, so that he, too, can become successful in life.  There ya go.  Tonight, I don't know what I'm going to post.  But until then, go drown yourself in television glory.

      Later today, a new service, Mobagel, will launch, giving readers access to all of the pictures that I feel like posting.  This month's special feature is "Camp Orlando 2004," which has all of the pictures that I took during Camp Orlando (see Nerdular Nerdance: July 2004 for more information).  This includes pictures and stories and things that I did not post during the Nerdular Nerdance event when I came back from camp.  So, be sure to check it out!  I'll have the link to Mobagel (Mobile Bagel, since I can post pictures from anywhere).   Also today, I'll be starting my Photoshop blog, getting that ready.  I'll only post there once or twice a week, since school will limit the time that I will have in Photoshop.  Get ready for some awesome stuff though, because I'm taking my Photoshop skills to the next level.  Only the best stuff that I create will be allowed to pass through the blog.  You'll get tips, tricks, and information on how I did each of the things that I create.   That's it from me for now.  I'm going to go finish getting Mobagel ready.  It shall launch today.

      Windows keeps screwing me over.  For the past two years, Windows has been nothing but total crap.  Windows XP, unfortunately, does not live up to its potential to be a strong, good operating system.  So, as my friends may have heard from me in the past few weeks, I am planning, within the next year, to switch to an Apple iBook, and eliminate the need for Windows XP for good.  There are some minor issues regarding my internet access, like, will I be able to use my network adapter (which is designed for Windows XP), with the iBook, or will I need to find something Mac compatible that will integrate with the current home network?  I am definitely researching this.  Apple is so much better than Hewlett Packard, too.  The picture quality on any Apple computer this day in age looks 1000 better than anything that you see on Windows.  It'd help when I'm making stuff in Photoshop.   Anyway, now on to something else.  Digital Lust is over.  Too much to worry about.  This time I'm being serious.  All of the Digital Lust posts will be ported over to here in the next few weeks.  To replace it, I'm starting a blog of all the Photoshop things that I create.  I'm working on some creative new ideas, and I'm going to post them all, instead of posting them on somewhere like Deviantart or somewhere like that.   And then, there's the new moblog.  All the pictures that I take from here on out are going to be available on my new moblog (don't worry, they'll be posted here, too, but, also on the new moblog, for easy archiving).  This eliminates the need for me to use "Hello," which takes me a long time to use.   And, that's all for the nerd part of this post.  In six days, I'll finally be 17.  Thats right, fools, I haven't forgotten yet.  Now, come Friday, I may forget, but, I'm taking every step necessary to ensure that it does not happen.  So, rest assured, people will not be reminding me that its my birthday this year.  Let's just hope that another hurricane doesn't threaten to come through here again.  Well, that's it from me for now.  Tonight I'm going to make fun of peoples' blogs for the first time in nearly two weeks!  Or, if I don't do that, I'll post something else!  See ya!

      Well, the power was out for a while, so I haven't had time to blog at all today (my parents had a plan, in case we had to evacuate...we're too close to the highway, and its in the evacuation zone).  But, after about 15 minutes of rain (so far), The River still stands.  So, basically, we got a free day off of school for this whole thing; nothing more, nothing less.  The hurricane turned out to be a category 4 storm, but, also headed towards the Orlando direction.  Oh well.  Happy Friday the 13th everyone!  Now I have to get everything back to its normal position.  I literally had to move everything into my closet, because the hurricane was scheduled to hit The River dead on sometime today.  All of my stuff is packed away.  We were going to head north to somewhere like, Tallahassee, but, we got 15 minutes of rain.  So we didn't leave.  And, unless that thing makes another turn and decides to hit The River later on, we're staying here.  So, tomorrow, we will resume normal blogging schedule.   Well, it's been an incredibly long day...I didn't get to sleep in on my day off because of the stupid spooty evacation, and my mom flipping out about having to get ready to leave.  But, I guess it was a good idea to be prepared.  I don't think I'll ever get to experience a hurricane, which is perfectly okay with me, but, after seeing what happened in Port Charlotte today after the power came back, I guess being prepared is a good idea.  I'm going to go to sleep early tonight, so don't expect anything more.   This has been my 100th post on Blog of Bagel.  Happy Friday the 13th.

      Well, I thought this was the 100th post, but, due to my lack of catching that the "I Could be Asleep" post from last night was accidentally posted twice, this is only the 99th post.  So, that's that.  My 100th post will come tomorrow morning, before the hurricane comes and attacks The River.   Tonight, I'm going to read some of The Lord of The Rings.  Because of my extended weekend, I do have to read the pages in Economics that were assigned, and also do the Spanish homework that was assigned today.  Then, I'm going to read The Lord of The Rings, and hopefully get through a good part of "The Fellowship of the Ring."  It's a really good book, I haven't had much time to read it though, and, I'm definitely going to spend a good portion of this weekend catching up, hopefully getting through a lot of the introduction stuff.  After tomorrow morning, all blog posting will be suspended until after this thing passes.  I may not even have power for a while after the storm.  I'm not sure.  This is my first hurricane that's really going to hit us (there's been several threats in five years, but nothing that's actually gotten us).  So, we'll see how it goes.  It'll be a brand new experience for me.  We were under a tornado watch today, too, but, we didn't see anything come out of that.  I'm surprised they didn't call us into a warning situation, where they make us duck down into uncomfortable positions in order to somehow protect us from a tornado.  Hmmm...how is that supposed to work, anyway?  Well, hopefully this thing won't be as bad as I think its going to be.  Like I've said, it's the first time I'm going through it, and I'm just a little confused as to, well, what a hurricane actually does, but, I guess I'll find out tomorrow!  That's it for tonight, Bloggers.  Tomorrow, I'll get on with my 100th post, and then not blog again until the storm is gone.  Until tomorrow, buenas noches, folks!

      School's been cancelled!  For tomorrow, anyway.  Today, Mr. Principal came over the intercom at about, oh, 1:20, and said that because of the approaching storms (Tropical Storm Bonnie, Hurricane Charley), school would be cancelled.  The whole class jumped up in excitement, including Mr. Economics Teacher, joyfully at the hearing of this exciting news.  Then, at 2:34, Mr. Principal (who was right after Mr. Assistant Principal, making his daily checklist of how things were going in the school), came on again, and said that they were going to go ahead and clear the school.  Then the bell rang 5 minutes early.  Then, when me and Melinda were walking out of the building at around, oh, 2:48, the power went out.  And then we were stuck in traffic in the parking lot.  Must have been another accident.  And that would have been bad.  But, now for the not yay.  Of course, we're going to have to make that day up, but, that's not a "not yay" event.  The not yay event of the day is the respect I don't get in the yearbook room.  Me and my co-editor, Lauren, were holding a brainstorming session for our section, and I got nothing but total disrespect from 7/10 of the yearbook staff.  We managed to come up with 13 ideas in about 45 minutes.  So, I told everyone that they had homework, to come up with ideas and write them on paper for us, due Monday.  I'm curious to see who will do it, and who will have not even listened to me.   Hey, I just realized.  The next post I make here will be the 100th post on this blog alone.  So, yay to that.  I'll make that post later on tonight.  Tomorrow is Friday the 13th, and we're going to get hit by 2 hurricanes!  Yay! (Sarcastically, of course)  So, we'll see how that goes.  And, with that being said, I'm out for now.  I'll be back later on tonight with my 100th post.  So, until then, The River es mucho tiempo libre!  (The River has much free time...learned that in Spanish today.)

      As you may have remembered from me posting a few weeks ago, I previously had a blog on Xanga, called I Could Be Asleep.  Well, next Friday (my birthday), is the one year anniversary of that blog first starting.  So, I'm thinking, maybe I'll start posting the posts from back then.  They were badly written, and they were most of the time stupid (yes, even more stupid than 3/4 of the stuff you see here on Blog of Bagel), but, still... they were funny, if you like stupid things.  So, in honor of my forgotten birthday last year, I'll be posting things from the old blog into Blog of Bagel.  But, enough about that.  Some may be wondering what's been happening to certain features like Late Night Bloggin'.  I'll still do it, but, once a week.  And that once a week will be on Saturdays, since I try to go to bed earlier on school nights.  Provided that The River still stands after these hurricane things go past us, then, I'll have it this weekend, but, don't be surprised if I don't, because I may not have any power because of these stupid things.  Damn weather.   Well, one person has backed off, and its not the person that should be backing off right about now.  He didn't do anything to really hurt me like those two girls did today.  They'd better back off soon, though, or else, they're not going to like me at all.  I will become the nastiest person if I must, and I don't really want to resort to that.  Well, since I'm really tired, I'm out for the night.  I'll be back tomorrow afternoon with some stuff.  Bye now!

      Hey Bloggers.  Here's some random rambling for ya.  Then that will probably be all for today, because I'm tired and not in the best mood.   School  Things seem to be going quite better at school now.  Spanish didn't bore me to death (at all, actually), I spent half of the front office period outside, for both a fire drill and to change the sign out front.  Yearbook was better because we're starting pre-planning for this year.  I can't wait to get started on my section; me and Lauren have good ideas.  And then Economics was cool today because Mr. Economics Teacher basically sat there, talked about Economics, poking jokes at Clayton and Joe the whole time, which was pretty cool.  So, my day was better, for the most part.  There are a couple girls on yearbook staff right now who I am not very happy with, mainly because they can't keep their mouths shut about stuff that isn't true, and they're sitting there and telling everyone.  If it were up to me, I'd make sure they got the hard yearbook assignments, but, that's not the kind of person I am, and I'm not going to do it that way.  But, they need to learn to keep their mouths shut-- I did, and they should have to too, otherwise, they are going to form a bad reputation on yearbook staff.   Hey, look, a Hurricane!  Yeah, supposedly there's like two hurricanes heading towards The River.  One of which could be here by Friday (the 13th, unfortunately), and one a couple days after that.  Why us?  Is it some kind of Friday the 13th bad luck symbol?  Hopefully we'll have good luck and it will suddenly go north, therefore not even bringing rain of any kind to The River.   One advantage of the whole hurricane thing is that they will cancel school, but, of course, my dad obsesses greatly over these things, so it would therefore become a disadvantage.   I'm Running Out of Ideas.  Yes, folks, the great Bagel has fallen.  I am running out of ideas, and I don't want to.  So, I may take a couple days off from Blogging in the next week or so, and start thinking of some new original ideas.  So, if I stop posting for a couple days, that's because I am working on new ideas.  Note to self: Birthday is still next Friday.  Don't forget it. Another Note to Self: That day is the 20th.  And, with that said, I'm out for now.  Maybe later, I'll post about what I'm reading in The Lord of the Rings, or maybe post a picture of what I've been doing in Photoshop lately, because it truly is an awesome program.  So, see ya for now.

      Too hard, maybe.  Howdy there, Bloggers.  Sorry for my lack of update in the last 24 hours, but, with school in full swing already, I've been thinking way too much to be alive.  Yeah, I've only got two *Real* thinking classes, but, still, today dragged on, and I'm too tired to try and think.  And I have homework.  Gee, this school year sure is going to suck, isn't it?  Economics, especially...everything basically went in one ear and out the other.  Sometimes, I just didn't even bother letting it go in one ear.  Spanish...she's still evil, and she continued her long list of rules today by talking about passes and crap.  At one point, she was like "DO NOT request to go to another teacher's class.  Last year I had one student in my class that kept leaving for yearbook..."  As soon as she said yearbook, my pen dug into my paper, and the whole paper ripped, causing people to stare me down.  Obviously, I'm on yearbook, and it was ME who went to go get Adam, the student she was mainly referring to, out of class for yearbook purposes.  So, that was definitely not a good thing.  I think that's all I've got for now.  I'll be back later tonight with stuff.  Bye for now.

      Well, school is now officially over for the day, and it turned out to be a pretty good day.  My Spanish teacher is evil, however.  Aside from that, everything seemed to go okay.  So, here's a rundown of the whole day:   Homeroom:  Well, I thought we had to park at the library today because Melinda didn't have her parking permit yet, but, I was wrong.  So we parked at the library, and had to walk quite a way to get to the school.  We walked in right before the late bell, so, that was bad.  But, when we got there, we walked to homeroom.  Saw a lot of my friends that I hadn't seen all summer, which is pretty cool.  Got my schedule, and it was time to go.   First Period:  First period was Spanish II.  The teacher (Profe SpanishLady), is very, very boring, and very, very evil.  So, oh well.  18 weeks is going to go by really, really slow in that class.  She is too tight on her rules, especially the cell phone rule.  "If you have to shut your phone off during my class, you'd better not even look at it, otherwise, it's gone," said Profe Spanishlady.  That class will be incredibly boring.  Good thing there are some of my friends there.  Otherwise, I probably would die in there.   Second Period:  Second period is Executive Internship in the front office.  I'm up there for the first nine weeks.  Mrs. Announcer Lady and Mrs. Receptionist showed me and Bianca, my co-worker, around, and we started work.  We had several messages given to students, which required us to call around to several different classes.  This will probably be my favorite period of the day, but, we'll see what happens.   Third Period:  Third period is Yearbook.  Things are definitely going to be different this year.  We've got more organization this year, which is a good thing.  Today we basically just did an exercise to see what kind of working style we are.  I'm a South, which means that I check with others to make sure things are good before I go and create it.  So, that was an interesting exercise.  And we'll be busy with presentations and things all week.   Fourth Period:  Fourth period was Economics.  My teacher for that class is pretty cool, much better than I thought.  We'll do some interesting things in Mr. Economics Teacher's class.  People like Savannah, Clayton, Chris, and a bunch of other people I know are in there.  So, that's pretty cool.  And that's how my day went.  I won't post things that happen in my classes every day, mainly because it would bore people to death.  So, there won't be too much of that. Sometimes, I'll say stuff about my classes, but, don't expect too much.   That's about it for now.  I'll be back later on, but for now, I have to get to Digital Lust for today's update.  So, I'll be back here later.  Be sure to check back.  Tonight, I'll have Late Night Bloggin' at 10:30, and maybe something before that.  So, check back later, and I'll be back with more original stuff.

      Well, here we go.  In about 20 minutes, I'll be embarking once again to The River High School for my fourth and final year of edumacation there.  Will it be good to the point where it will be a great day, or a day of infamy because of my brother?  We'll see.  Speaking of him, he got up this morning and was like "I need a map, where do I get one?"  And I'm like "Well, I thought you would find it yourself."  I gave him my map, but, he's dumb enough to not be able to read it.  Oh well.  That's it for this extremely short edition of Blog of Bagel.  I'm off to school in a few minutes, so, for those of you still on summer break, may god bless your soul, because you truly are the lucky ones.  Bastards.  Oh well.  See ya'll this afternoon!

      School starts tomorrow.  I thought I was ready, but I don't think I am...it's my last year in high school already!  Things are gonna be so different...how will I be able to handle it?!  The thought of starting work on another yearbook...new classes, my brother being around...it's all happening to fast already.  Blog of Bagel will be back tomorrow with more...for now, I think I'm going into shock.  Adios Bloggers.

      Well, folks of The River, today is our last day of summer vacation.  After a summer long of Blogging, Yearbook Camping, Driver's Ed-ing, and wasting time in New York-ing, I think I'm ready to get back this year.  My schedule, like I've noted in the past, is not hard at all, and should actually be pretty easy.  My brother is going to be around, and just his presence is going to ruin me, but, after the first couple of days, I think it'll be alright.  We have to at least try to get along like most high school siblings, and though I doubt its going to happen, it's worth a shot.   At long last, I'm finally NOT riding the bus. For the past three years I've had to deal with that kind of torment, and its just not fun.  So I found a ride until October, when I get my license.  My good friend Melinda is going to take me.   Pre-school preparations are completed, and I am all set to go for tomorrow.  So why aren't I at Busch Gardens, like originally planned?  I don't feel like it.  So I'm just going to stay here, and go next weekend.  I'd rather go to Universal, but, that's not for a while.  So today, I'm just gonna chill around here, play Top Spin, maybe win another tournament in that game, then, I'm going to probably watch a couple DVDs, and then, I'm going to go to sleep, wake up at 6:30 tomorrow morning, and begin the 2004-2005 school year without being too tired.  I'm already used to getting up early, since I've been at school almost every day last week, so, it shouldn't be too much of a bad thing getting up to start in the morning.   So, about this Gmail contest.  I STILL do not have my invites, and it's kinda ticking me off a bit.  They said about 2-4 weeks after you sign up, and its now been six.  I'm thinking that maybe, just maybe, they're going to be launching the final version soon.  But, we'll see.  If I don't have anything by the end of the month, I'll just call the whole thing off.   That's it for now.  I'm going to go get my laundry going, and then I'm going to play Top Spin for an hour or so.  So, be sure to check out Blog of Bagel later for more crap for you to spend time reading.  David out.  Later.

      I think I'm running out of ideas...it's taken me 2 hours just to even think of a subject for this blog.  Hopefully that will change once school starts.  But, we'll see.   Let's see.  Today, I watched Back to the Future II and III.  I watched the first one last night.  Then, I played Top Spin (tennis game) on my Xbox.  I completed two of the tournaments, one in North America, and one in South America.  It is a pretty hard game, and you have to know what you're doing in order to succeed, but, once you get used to the controls, it gets pretty easy.  The more you score that the other player doesn't, the stronger you are, and you have the advantage.  Look for a review of the game on Monday's Digital Lust.  Tomorrow, I was supposed to go to Busch Gardens, but I have decided not to, mainly because I have so much more crap to do before school starts Monday morning.  So, I have decided to go next weekend.  I'd rather go to Universal, but, it's the other way, so I can't.  I will have my season pass for Universal by the end of October...I hope.  By then, I'll finally have my license, and I'll be able to go whenever I want.  So, haha.  G-Whatia?  Award shows have slumped to their all time low.  I was looking on TVGuide.com today to see if any good movies were on, and they showed an advertisement for "G-Phoria: The Award Show 4 (yes, 4) Gamers," on G4TechTV.  Obviously, the awards were given to the best games.  And, it was hosted by a porn star.  Sounds like a stupid idea, right.  Right you are if you said yes.  Who needs a videogame award show anyway?  Dumb people.  Dumb ideas.  Well, that's about all I got for tonight.  Hopefully, I'll have some idea worthy dream or something tonight that will help stimulate new posts for the blog, because right now, when it comes to posting on the blog, I'm braindead.  And that, of course, is bad.  See ya tomorrow, Bloggers.

      I can't believe how busy I have been in the past three weeks.  When I left for Camp Orlando on the 19th, I knew that my Blogger addiction would have to die down a little, because I wouldn't have much time to Blog in between Camp Orlando and my trip to New York.  And I didn't realize how little time I had to blog between Monday, when I returned, and Tuesday, when I went to school to help sell yearbooks and things.  I ended up at the school all of last week, minus Monday.  Today is the first day, in 3 whole weeks, that I'll actually be staying at home for the entire day, not going anywhere, not doing anything... I've NEVER been this busy before.  So, today, I'm going to post exactly what happened during those three weeks.  Nerdular Nerdance was already posted for Camp Orlando, but here are my final thoughts:   Camp Orlando:  The mecca for yearbook staffers.  The one and only Yearbook-Con.  Camp Orlando WAS better this year than last year, definitely, even though it didn't seem like it.  It was much different this year, because the past two years, it was only either me (2002), or me and Adam (2003) in the same room.  This year, we had me, Adam, Jonny Lively, Alex, and Jarrod.  So, obviously, things were a little louder and funnier.  The security guard incident was the funniest thing that could happen to a group of 5 guys.  The class I was in was really good.  The teacher that I had was pretty cool, we learned a lot of cool Photoshop tricks (and as soon as I get my computer's new CD drive, I'll be able to put Photoshop on here to do those tricks), and that was just a good experience.  Universal was great with just me, Alex, and Lauren, because lately, I hate being around big groups of people for long periods of time, not to mention, Revenge of the Mummy was awesome.  So, even though it didn't seem like it was a good year for Camp Orlando (mainly because of a certain event that put me in a bad mood), this year's camp was the best so far.  Hopefully Alex, Jarrod, and Jonny Lively will have an even better year next year.   New York:  This trip was incredibly long, incredibly boring, and incredibly sleep-losing.  There were a couple of perks, like going to the Paramount Carowinds park in the Carolinas, and going to Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, VA, but, this was a really boring trip otherwise.  There's nothing really to do in New York, aside from seeing the grandparents, but, the town is boring, and it gives me nothing to do.  Oh well.  I had to buy stuff to keep me busy, so I bought the Back to the Future trilogy on DVD, Top Spin for my Xbox, and Lord of the Rings, and I'm currently reading that today.  I'm glad to be back from that, because those ten days went by way too long.    Work at TRHS:  I worked at the school Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday to prepare for the upcoming school year.  I sold quite a few books and senior ads, created some forms for our new organization for the yearbook, and worked senior pictures, and had mine done, too. Today and tomorrow are the only days I have now before school starts...boy, that should be fun.  So, I've had a very busy three weeks, and now I've finally had time to post about it.  My Random Ramble was just spat out, and I really don't think about what I post.  Now, school is about to start, thus entering a period of time when Blogging will be more fun.  This year is my senior year, and it is sure to be filled with a new level of drama, new friends, and all sorts of other things that will undoubtedly happen this year.  How will it go?  You'll have to stick with Blog of Bagel to find out what's going on this school year.  I'll probably have time for a quick morning post before I leave.  Then, I leave the Blogger for the school day, and then come home, post about what happened during the day.  Then, I'll go to Digital Lust for the daily update.  Then, I'll go back to Blog of Bagel and post more.  But, don't count on continuous posts...I do want to try and expand my social life somewhat.  This fall is going to be completely different.  Hope I can handle it.  That's it from me for now.  I'll be back later on with more stuff.

      Welcome to the NEW Blog of Bagel.  As I said last night, I was going to update the system with new features, including a new template.  Well, here it is.  I'm also working on a brand new special feature that will increase user interactivity on the site.  So, be sure to check back here later, for even more stuff.  Later on, after I get done with this upgrade work, check out Blog of Bagel for some stuff.  Good stuff.  New stuff.  Stuff stuff.  And then some.

      I went to bed early last night (right after I got done writing that blog post), and I am so tired now.  I woke up at 6:30 this morning, got to school around 7:30.  This isn't the first time its happened, either.  Every time I go to bed early, I'm incredibly tired.  Why must that happen?!  So, as soon as I get this post done, I'm calling it quits already for the night.   Today marks the last official day of summer.  Monday morning, the halls of The River High School will be flooded with new and returning students; students who can't find their ways around; students who have the intent of annoying the upperclassmen; upperclassmen who have the intent of annoying the new students; students who already wish summer was back...I'm sure you get the point.  It's going to feel weird, being at school again after this shockingly long summer break.  It feels like it was a year ago when I last walked through the halls.  This year is going to be very different indeed.  No bus rides, my brother will be there, I'm working in the front office instead of guidance this year, and all sorts of other things.  It's going to work though, except for the brother being there.  One day, and he'll be in trouble.  I know he will.   I don't think I mentioned me cutting my foot the other day...it didn't seem important.  I ran the back of my chair at my computer into it, and the wheelie thingy ripped skin off my foot.  It wasn't that bad when it happened.  But, now, it's gotten like 10x worse.  Oh well.  I have nothing better to talk about.  That's it for me for tonight.  Tomorrow is post-o-rama, as well as some upgrade work.  New template, anyone?  I'm thinking so.  It's about time, I think.  New poll, re-organization, and some other new things that I'm planning on adding in here.  I'm also going to start writing Digital Lust's new post tomorrow.  I'm taking a look at some of the templates, and, possibly, we'll be changing tomorrow.  But, we'll see.  So, until then, let me go to sleep, because I've got about 15 minutes before my eyes close and I'm out.  So, I'm spent (stole that from Courtney, if nobody caught on yet).  Adios for now.

      Welcome to a special edition of Random Ramble. Today I'll be talking about my yearbook mistake, and also the freshman orientation and my pre-thoughts about what's going to become the 2004-2005 school year.   Baseball Players...I'm Coming Back  Originally, my plan was to NOT come back to do baseball pictures for the 2005 baseball season. I really liked working with the team last year, but, I wasn't sure if I could handle the work again this coming season. So, I started telling the baseball players that I talk to that I wouldn't come back. Tonight, that has changed. I met Coach Lambdin, the new baseball coach (and my new English teacher), and we talked about how I did the pictures last season, and he said that he was definitely interested in doing something like that in the next season, but, we're taking it one step further. This year, along with the end of the year slideshow (which, ironically, has still not been given to the players from last year...major computer technical foul, but don't worry guys, you'll have them by the end of the month, depending on Mr. Weiner's quickness at getting them back to you guys), me and Lambdin talked about making a media guide, that would be a perfect tool for me to get into UCF, because we are going to do a photo credit, something that Coach Weiner last year did not have me do. We're going to play around with some ideas, and I might go tomorrow and start planning ahead, so that I'm not tapped as the official baseball photographer two hours before the first game of the season. This new coach is pretty cool, can't wait to start working with him, and hopefully the 2005 baseball season will be even better than this past year's.   My latest Yearbook Mistake  Oh yes, I've had another big yearbook mistake today...well, actually, yesterday, but I just found out about it today. When we were selling yearbooks, I guess I accidentally had some of the checks written for books and things in the wrong money bag, and that money bag had been put away in the back closet of the yearbook room. Well, Melissa, our advertising editor, was counting money, and discovered that there were several checks and cash missing. I looked at her, and I was like, "You've gotta be kidding me...how could that happen?" So, I started looking around, and before long, Mr. Myers, the principal, found out about it. THAT scared me, because I thought I was gonna get in HUGE trouble for it. Well, turns out, it was all hidden, and Adam found it. He found me and he was like "Ooh, you're in trouble with Mr. Myers..." I almost died right then and there. Then he was like "Oh, just kidding, we found them." I almost sunk. Oh well.   Freshmen...Eh, Uh Oh...  Well, I may have a problem with SOME of this year's freshmen class...they've got attitudes. Big attitudes. But, aside from that, they might be "alright," but, the attitudes with some of them need to change. If they even think about trying to run the school, they'd might as well get the f*** out, because I'll complain too much if they do. That goes for my brother, too. He messes with me, he should keep in mind that I know his locker combo (ironically, its the same as mine, just a different locker). Mwahahaha.  The 2004-2005 school year looks like it's going to be alright, with a couple flaws (stupid brother). Alot of the new teachers seem like they're going to be cool. Yearbook is going to be better this year. Tomorrow is the last official day of summer...let's hope this next school year goes well. That's it for tonight. I'm spent. 14 hours at the school today. That'll look good for my hours. Adios, until next time.

      Hiya, and welcome to another quality edition of Random Ramble.  Instead of Late Night Bloggin' tonight, I'm going to just talk about stuff.    Tomorrow at TRHS  Tomorrow I'm having my senior pictures done.  I'm not too thrilled about it, since that baby tooth that I had to have surgically removed last year STILL hasn't grown back, leaving a nice big ol' hole in my mouth (damn dentist, always screwing everything up).  But, oh well, it's only a picture.  I'm also selling yearbooks all day tomorrow, I have to go and get my brother's schedule, and locker, and all that other stuff because he's "too cool to go to orientation..." stupid kid.  Well, I'm not showing him where his homeroom is on the first day when he gets lost.  Same thing with his locker.  He can just find it himself.  I just hope Mrs. Yearbook Advisor knows that I'll be taking that 15 minutes to do that tomorrow.  I'm supposed to be selling the yearbooks, but my parents said "well, since he doesn't want to go to orientation, you just go to his homeroom and get his schedule, his locker, and all that other stuff."  So now I have to do it.  Otherwise, I wouldn't be doing it, because I'm just not that nice.  Haha.  Whilst I'm selling yearbooks, I'm going to work with InDesign and begin the official layouts for my section.  I gained a little bit of knowledge on the program today, and I'm starting to understand how it works.  Heh, if I didn't have to go home, I would have stayed on Mrs. Yearbook Advisor's laptop for quite a long time working on it...I'm addicted to it.  Just like Blogger.  I'm addicted to Blogger.  The official layouts are going to be completely different this year, just like I said today.  I have ideas on what I want to do, but they are going to require a new level of quality, as far as pictures go.  But, I have confidence in Melissa and the staff this year to do so.  Anyway.  I'm getting an early start tomorrow, going to chill in guidance until 8 (have to get there at 7, either that or I won't be there until 10:45 again, and I HAVE to be there by at least 9).  While I'm in Guidance, I'm going to try and do some work on InDesign from there.  In fact, since I have Guidance this year, it gives me an idea... when I am not doing any work in Guidance during my class period, I think I'll go get the laptop from Mrs. Yearbook Advisor and work on my stuff from there... that's not a bad idea, actually.  Good for checking stories, importing pictures, and all that other good stuff... I'll discuss it in my next meeting with Mrs. Yearbook Advisor.   Today at TRHS  Today went alright... like I said this morning, I wasn't going to go in at 6:30 this morning like my dad wanted to do...so I got there at about 10:45.  That can't happen tomorrow.  Anyway.  I got there, immediately got the laptop, quickly threw something together for Adam, and then got to InDesign...and sold yearbooks.  Saw a bunch of my friends that are sophomores this year today, like Adam, and Jessica, and Amanda T. (though I don't think we classify as "friends").  Me and Alex sat there, saying stuff about Jarrod when he walked in the door to get his locker, and also playing with InDesign.  Alex actually caught on quicker than I did... Mrs. Yearbook Advisor needs to know that, because if he can do stuff with InDesign, then he may be a key asset to the book once computer nerds like me and Adam leave at the end of this school year.  Anyway.  Today was alright, but, I had to go sit in my mom's office for two hours afterwards, because she was on the floor and couldn't take me home.  And that sucked.  But, oh well, it went by somewhat quickly.   It Shall Not Be Forgotten  This year, like I've said before, I'm not forgetting my birthday.  It's not going to be hard, since its exactly one week after FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH.  August 20, to be exact.  I don't know if I actually wrote what happened last year... anyway, I completely lost track of time, to sum it up, and even though I was filling out the date on receipts for the senior breakfast, I never caught on to the fact that it was my birthday, until my guidance counselor had to remind me during my 4th period Guidance class last year...wow, did I feel stupid.  And that became known as my klumsiest moment of all time...at least, in my book, it did.  Rest assured, Bagel will not be forgetting his birthday this year.    Still no Gmail Stuff Yet...  This confuses me...it was originally going to be less than a month, and I still have not received Gmail invites for my giveaway.  Maybe Gmail is about to launch the official version, and they aren't giving any more invites.  If thats the case, than this contest is screwed...until I find something else to giveaway.  So, stick with me, and hopefully I'll have more information soon.   UCF: The School I Definitely Want to Go To  That's right.  The decision has been made, just like Adam made his decision (I thought about making that decision 2 years ago, though).  UCF (University of Central Florida) in Orlando is the school that I want to go to after graduating next May.  And, just like Adam, I want to go into journalism.  He wants to go into TV journalism, I guess.  I don't.  Print journalism is what I want to do, and I'm going to minor in teaching, just like I had originally planned.  So, basically, I'll probably copy Courtney and be a journalism/English teacher.  And I also want to do a magazine, or a newspaper.  But, UCF will definitely be that school that I learn it all at.   Well, that's about it for tonight.  I probably won't be posting anything tomorrow morning, and I'm going to be gone for the majority of the day, so the only expected post tomorrow should be something.  But, probably only one post.  I've got a busy day ahead of me tomorrow.  I'll be at the school for about 12 hours.  But, it'll be good for my community service.  I'm doing so much of it, that my 250 hour goal should be accomplished before the end of 2004.  Then I can work on 300 by May 2005.  Anyway, that's it.  Bagel is checking out.  See ya.

      That's the only thing I could think of for this entry... god, I must be running out of ideas.  That, of course, is bad.  Could it be that my addiction to Blogger is dying down, after almost two whole months of doing nothing but blogging?  Maybe.  But, keep in mind that I shall not be ditching this blog anytime in the next few years.  Nope, gotta keep going with it.   You know what irritates me?  My dad wanted to drop me off at my school this morning at 6:30 so I could do my yearbook work.  Well, I didn't have to be there until nine.  What was he expecting me to do for those 2 and a half hours? I'm not sure, but it was crazy.  So I said screw it, I'm going back to sleep.  I'll be at the school at around 10-ish.  It's the best I can do, I wasn't going to sit up there doing nothing for two and a half hours.  Doesn't work that way.  I just hope that it's not the same way for the next two days for senior pictures, because I'm not getting there at 6:30, and it is crucial that I am there by 9.  8 will work, but 6:30 just doesn't cut it.  Today me and Alex are going to sell yearbooks, and I'm also going to do what Mrs. Yearbook Advisor tells me to, if there's anything else.  I want to play around with InDesign a little more, so that I can get a little better knowledge of what is to come with creating this year's yearbook.  My intent is to create these high-end layouts.  Back at Camp Orlando, I went to this "Breakout" session called "Visual Design," which told us that magazine-style layouts were the thing this year.  I want to play around with that idea, and see if I can pull it off.   My new cell phone is still MIA.  My mom called the Nextel place yesterday, and they said that the one they were shipping turned out defective, so they're refurbishing it, and it should be at my dad's office next Tuesday.  So, oh joy, I get to wait another week.  I hate my p.o.s. cell phone that I currently use.  It's huge, out of date, and looks like crap.  My new one has a color screen, internet, GPS (though I don't think I'll use that), polyphonic ringtones, and all sorts of other things that my current one (the Motorola i30sx model) doesn't have!  My number won't change, since I'm already on Nextel, which is good, because this one is easy to remember.   Lately I've taken an interest in the whole Lord of the Rings trilogy.  I'm currently reading the book (I bought the whole trilogy in one book in NY, and it's like 1000 pages).  I'm only on Chapter 3 of Fellowship of the Ring (haven't had much reading time, with all the driving in NY, can't read in the car), but, it's already pretty good.  After I finish reading the book, I'm going to get the DVDs and watch them.   Anyway, I'm going to finish getting ready to go.  I have the weirdest feeling that I'm not going to get there anywhere near when I need to, mainly because my aunt is probably going to be late getting here to take me down there.  Then, I'm going to read a little bit until she gets here, then I'm going to go to school and work until 3, and then I'm going to come back here, post another brand new Random Ramble post, this time with more stuff, probably, and then I'm going to read some more.  And then I'm going to watch my favorite movie in the Back to the Future trilogy, Back to the Future II.  Wow, I've got my whole day mapped out, don't I?  For those who have been wondering about the fate of Digital Lust, it will be returning on Monday with some all new stuff for you to read.  I'm going one post per day over there, because I'm focusing most of my time on schoolwork and Blog of Bagel, of course.  But, that's quite okay.  Most of you guys don't read that blog anyway, which is why I'm taking it off of my shown blogs.  If you want to see it, you'll have to ask for the address.  But, it will remain in existance.  That's it from me for now.  Check back later on for Random Ramble, Late Night Bloggin', and maybe something else, depending on my mood at the end of the day.  Later!

      Well well...after two whole weeks, Late Night Bloggin' has returned, and now, I'm going to make fun of people's blogs more than ever!  Expect more of the same stuff, with added insults.  I'm even going to post parts of peoples' blogs, and then make fun of them specifically!  Remember, it's all in good fun, though, and if your blog just so happens to turn up here, its all intended to be funny, and probably not serious...at least 90% of the time.  If I really think your blog is bad, then you'll know it.  So, anyway, let's get going.   urlLink Blog Blog Blog!  Rating: *  You may remember in the last installment of Late Night Bloggin', I reviewed a blog called "Blog Blog Blog," which led me to post the lyrics to the Ren and Stimpy song, "Log log log."  Well, this is another blog called Blog Blog Blog, and I'm not going to post the lyrics.  Sorry.  This blog sucks.  His main focus, I guess, is to bash President Bush and everything that he does, and also talk about politics.  Well, let me just say this: it's too damn annoying.  Who cares about politics that much?  I mean, yeah, Bush isn't the best President we have had, and I think Kerry deserves to win, but this guy just overstretches it, and has since he started the blog back in May.  This makes me stop and think, do we really need blogs like this in the blogging world, or is it a waste of Blogger's space, just like Blog of Bagel might be?  Well, I'm going with the second option.  It's okay once in a while to talk about the politics, if you're older and have nothing better to do than post what you think of our president on the internet, but, for anyone else, it's pointless to read, especially with a catchy, interesting title such as Blog Blog Blog.  You'd think that this would be some teenager's blog, but no, it's a politics junkie.  And that's just grand.  And do note the sarcasm.  Sorry dude, but, you need to stop focusing on politics and the world and start writing something just a little bit better, something that might interest teenagers, which more than likely create at least 51% of Blogger's userbase.   urlLink The Blog in My Own Eye  Rating: **  This one is just a little bit better.  Yes, it's got all the political crap that the first one has, and more.  This guy actually does talk about stuff that isn't directly related to politics or world news.  He talks about his life, how he hates yard work, his job interview, crap like that.  But, this blog is still incredibly boring.  Like most blogs these days, this one uses one of the Rounders styles that are available on Blogger (and I'm even thinking about moving this blog to one of them very soon).  It's not a bad thing, but, eventually, the Rounders style is going to wear out, and people will be using this style more.  Anywho.  The way this guy writes his stuff is much better than the style of the guy who I rated above.  Now, I've had enough political crap.  So, that's it for this blog.  Tomorrow, I'm going to be working at the school again, so I'm not going to be around until tomorrow afternoon.  I need to get some sleep, because I'm going in early to work in guidance, since they requested my services, swamped as they are.  I'm getting good community service for working up there, and its definitely needed.  My new goal for community service is at least 250 hours, which should surpass practically everyone in my senior class.  I think right about now, I'm nearing 200.  So, maybe I can even pull off 300.  If I can do that, then that's great.  I'm going to keep going with the Interact club, maybe the Key Club, and I'm going to keep working towards it.  As far as working pictures for the baseball team goes for this next year, right now, I'm saying no, but, that could change.  It was a good experience for me working with them last year, but, I don't know if I'm up to it again this year.  But, we'll see how things go.  This new baseball coach is going to be my English teacher this year, so, if he requests me, I'll say yes, but, otherwise, I'm not going to bring it up.  That's it for me for today.  I'll be back tomorrow afternoon with more crap for you to read!  Until then, adios.

      Welcome to a new Blog of Bagel feature, Random Ramble.  This may or may not be a daily thing, I'm not sure, but, if it is, then expect everything that I talk about to be completely...well, random.  Normally, I'll just talk about things that are going on that don't deserve their own post, and maybe talk about stuff that I like.  But, whatever happens, keep in mind that its random, and probably not well written.  Now, enjoy.    School is Changing  I was up at school today, and I must say, there is A LOT that is changing around TRHS lately.  I now know every detail of my schedule.  1st Semester: Period 1: Spanish 2 Period 2: Exec. Intern/Guidance Period 3: Yearbook/Mass Media I Period 4: Economics/American Gov.  2nd Semester: Period 1: English IV (I got the baseball coach again) Period 2: Algebra 2 Period 3: Yearbook/Mass Media II Period 4: Exec. Intern/Guidance  It's going to be quite a year.  Yearbook is going to be a huge change this year.  We're switching from Pagemaker software to the much-better InDesign, which combines elements of Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Pagemaker, all in one sweet package, which will allow for better layouts.  I tried playing with it today, and it's going to be interesting, learning how to use it.  And we're going to have to work at it, but, in the end, we're going to create a Yearbook that it 50x better than last year's.  I know it.  I can feel it.   It feels so weird, knowing that in less than a week, school will have started again, and this time, it's the last time I'll ever have to deal with the rush of the whole "first day of school" thing before college.  College.  Holy crap.  One year from now, I'll be moving out to college.  THAT feels even weirder.  I got my locker today, and I'll be at the school for pretty much the rest of the week, working senior pictures and selling yearbooks and stuff.  Turns out I'm NOT going to be creating the video for orientation after all... some other kid that I know is working on it.  Good thing, too, because I'm too caught up in yearbook preparations that I don't really have the time to do it.    Back to the Future  Anyone else a huge fan of these three movies?  Yeah, being 17 years old, you'd think that I wouldn't be watching them like I used to.  But, they're my favorite movies of all time, I think.  I finally found a copy of the DVD Trilogy Set, and I'm very impressed.  It's in widescreen, but, the special features make up for it.  The quality of the movies overall has definitely improved-- the picture looks so much better.  Here's a rundown of each movie, just in case you've never seen them:   Back to the Future  The first installment of this new trilogy by Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis was released in 1985.  Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are the stars of the whole trilogy, and their characters are defined perfectly in this first installment.  In 1985, Doctor Emmett Brown finishes his work on the DeLorean time machine.  After being attacked by Libya terrorists, Dr. Brown is shot, leaving Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) flying through the speed of time into the year 1955.  Somehow, he must try to get back to the year 1985, and he has no more power in the flux capacitor to get him back.  So, he must team up with the 1955 version of Dr. Brown to figure out a way to get back, without interfering with history.  But, Marty did not realize this, and he had met his pushover father, when he was a teenager.  Biff Tannen, who hates the McFly family, is always trying to beat up on Marty's future father, and also trying to get Lorraine (who would later become known as Marty's mother) to have sex with him or something.  Not quite sure what his intentions were.  Anyway, Marty has to try and hook up his future father and Lorraine for the upcoming school dance, because, if his parents don't meet, then he will never be born, therefore screwing up the time continuum and sending Marty into a state of non-existance.  He is successful in doing so, as Marty's father beats up Biff and gets Lorraine to like him.  Then, at the end, Dr. Brown has to make it so that the DeLorean is struck by lightning at a speed of 88 mph, in order to get Marty back to 1985.  They're successful, and then, the movie goes back to 1985, and Marty's warning to Dr. Brown about him getting shot works, as Dr. Brown is wearing a bulletproof vest now when he gets shot.  Then, it says To be Continued.   Back to the Future II  The second installment of the series first takes us to the future, the year 2015 to be exact.  Cars are flying, and things are different, and potentially bad for Marty McFly's family.  Dr. Brown must get Marty to dress up as his future son and prevent Griff (a relative of Biff), from getting Marty's son to do something bad and end up in jail.  Then, a big blow for Marty comes as he gets fired from his job in the year 2015, because of an inside business deal.  Then, they go back to 1985.  Things are different in Hill Valley.  In 2015, Marty had bought a sports almanac for the years 1950-2000, so that he could make some extra money when he goes back to the year 1985.  Dr. Brown made Marty throw it away, and Biff gets a hold of it, and also steals the DeLorean to go back and give the 1955 version of Biff the almanac.  Now, in 1985, Biff controls all of Hill Valley, and even beyond.  So, it's back to 1955 for Marty as he must retrieve the almanac from ever getting in the possession of Biff.  The cool thing about this movie is that it takes scenes from the first movie and gives them a whole new perspective.  Will Marty retrieve the almanac?  You'll have to watch it to find out!  At the end of this movie, the 1985 Dr. Brown is accidentally sent to 1855, and now, Marty has to go find him.   Back to the Future III  The final movie in the BttF trilogy goes to the old west, in the year 1855, where Marty McFly must stop Dr. Brown from wanting to live in the old west, and get him back to his time period in 1985.  The DeLorean goes back to the west, is nearly attacked by Indians, and Marty locates Dr. Brown.  Biff's relative from that time period (can't remember his name, sorry), is being the usual asshole towards the McFly family, and eventually threatens to kill Marty.  Dr. Brown meets the woman of his life, Clara, and doesn't want to leave the old west.  This one isn't the best one in the series (that title goes to II), but, it's still a pretty good movie.  I haven't fully finished this one, so I can't give complete details yet, but, I'll finish it up later.  That's it for today's Random Ramble.  I'll be back later tonight for the return of Late Night Bloggin', and maybe something else, too.  See ya!

      I know you all have missed me.  It's hard not to.  My continuous habit of Blogging suddenly stopped due to my long, much hated vacation to the New York state.  But now, I have returned, and I'm not going anywhere...except school on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday for both senior pictures and a "special presentation" that I'm working on for the assistant principal for the freshman orientation that is on Thursday night.  Being home, though, never felt better.  This vacation (which, to me, seemed more like putting me through hell than a vacation), overall, dragged on forever, but, there were a couple things that were pretty cool, like getting to stop at the Paramount Carowinds theme park in South/North Carolina (the park goes through both states), the Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, VA, and that's it!  I did get to see one of my friends that I haven't seen in 5 years (lives in Virginia, my mom and his mom went to school together, therefore, I've known this kid all my life), and that was pretty cool.  And then, this morning, we headed back here to The River, and I couldn't be any happier to be back.   Anyway, the main purpose of me and the parentals (and the siblings, of course) driving to New York was the fact that I would be bringing back my new car (1998 Toyota Corolla...its green, and I don't like green very much), but, of course, what had to happen?  No car came back.  My parents decided that "they'll fly up in a month and pick it up so that we don't have to worry about dinging it on the way back."  Doesn't that irritate you how parents do that?  Well, they also decided to start driving up every time we go, and I'm thinking, "Hell no, by Christmas time, I'll have my license, so I'll drive to the airport, fly up there, and have my aunt or someone pick me up."  No way will I ever drive back up there.  It's too long of a drive, and my brother is too annoying to deal with for 22 hours.  Things are going to be different this month on Blog of Bagel.  What exactly is going to be different, I'll have to make up my mind on that tomorrow.  But, let me assure you, that school is NOT going to slow me down on the great and mighty Blogger.  No sir.  No it won't.  I'm not going to have this blog slow down because of stupid school.  But, now, I'm really tired, it was a long ride back to The River, so I'm turning in for the night.  Things go back to normal tomorrow, so expect my regular update schedule once again.  Oh, for those few individuals who may be wondering, I'm not in that same particular bad mood that lasted pretty much throughout Yearbook camp anymore.  Want details?  Instant Message me (the bagel05 on AIM), and I'll tell you, but, only, if you were with me at Camp Orlando.  But, nothing until tomorrow.  Need sleep.  Adios!
