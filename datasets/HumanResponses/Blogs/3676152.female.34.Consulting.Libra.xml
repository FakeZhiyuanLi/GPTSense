A generic term increasingly being used to describe any form of malicious software, sometimes referred to as rogue programs.; eg, viruses, Trojan horses, malicious active content, Denial of Service and other such attacks. etc.  Not only is malware attacking our PC’s, it is also made its way into some of our mobile phones.   urlLink Read this article for more information on the matter.    SPYWARE What is it? Definition of “Spyware”; googled.  A general term for a program that surreptitiously monitors your actions. While they are sometimes sinister, like a remote control program used by a hacker, software companies have been known to use spyware to gather data about customers. The practice is generally frowned upon.  A technology that assists in gathering information about a person or organization without their knowledge. On the Internet, "spyware is programming that is put in someone's computer to secretly gather information about the user and relay it to advertisers or other interested parties." As such, spyware is cause for public concern about privacy on the Internet.  This is also known as "adware". It is a hidden software program that transmits user information via the Internet to advertisers in exchange for free downloaded software. The Specialty Alliance Corporation™ does NOT use Spyware in any form or fashion, or will do business with companies that do.  There are concerns that some Web sites and commercial organizations track users' online activity through the use of what is called ‘spyware'. Usually coming in the form of ‘cookies' - these enable the cookie writer to build-up information about what you do and where you go on the Web.

      What is it?  Definition of “Spoofing” from US-cert.gov  “Email spoofing may occur in different forms, but all have a similar result: a user receives email that appears to have originated from one source when it actually was sent from another source. Email spoofing is often an attempt to trick the user into making a damaging statement or releasing sensitive information (such as passwords).”    Some common types of “Spoofing”:  Personal reputation/credibility damage – one of the more serious implications for activists is having their identity hijacked to undo or sabotage their work.   Identity theft – spoofers will often attempt to get your login and password information for your bank, eBay, AOL and other accounts.   Virus/worm propagation – recently, the swen worm disguised itself as a software update from Microsoft. Users who ran the executable attachment would have their antivirus and firewall software disabled.  Self-sending   Self-sending is unsolicited e-mail that looks like you sent it to yourself: your name appears on the "from" line as well as the "to" line. For example, Bob Thing might receive a message addressed to "bthing@yourprovider.com" that purports to be from "bthing@greatfantasticdeal.com." In some cases a message may appear to be sent from your exact e-mail address. More about It by Techtv.com    How can I tell if I have been spoofed?  Not too long ago, it was relatively easy to spot spoofs if you knew what to look for, This has begun to change as graphic elements and language from the “spoofee” are appropriated to make email seem more authentic.  Updated antivirus software, in this case, is not enough if you don’t know that Microsoft never sends software updates as attachments. Basic “email hygiene” also tells us not to open email attachments indiscriminately.   "Spoofing emails - best practices." 18 Jun 2004. Tech Support Announcement. AIU Online. 18 Jun 2004  .
