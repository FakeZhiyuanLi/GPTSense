      so we begin with lets see, wednesday so i figure we'll leave EARLY morning, like 7:00 or something, pssh, turns out my dad has some shizzle to do until 9:00 so we only get on the road by 10, pssh. Meh, drive down was quite interesting, my mom ensures us that she has directions to the place we get on the road and she says "oh crap, this is only when you get into town" so we gotta go buy a map to find out how to get to that town, PSSSSH, MAPQUEST!!!! so we end up takin' a round about route 'cause stupid map! we were amused with the map for a while cuz it was a "Rand McNally" like on the Simpsons, you know "in fact, in rand mcnally, burgers eat people" -Lisa to Bart anyhoo, amazing cottage, it was a private cottage, odd how we got it though, that goes back to christmas, but first he cottage. 2 floors (basement not done yet though, so its basically only 1 floor right now) 3 bedrooms plus some crazy shed type thing with 3 more beds outside.  There was also this KICKASS speedboat, but we werent allowed to touch it obviously, we had the little 14ft aluminum fishing boat so with every good fishing trip, it must have a fishig story, about the one that got away, no doubt like "BIG FISH" SO, here goes we go around the lake (not hte ENTIRE lake, but enough of it) looking for some descent fish dumbass stupid tiny fish!!! so we finally g to this little cove type place, and catch some, quite content with the little fish, we decide to go back, besides it was getting dark anyway, so we reel in the lines, and this dumbass fish decides to swallow the hook completely, my dad gets caught in the rocks, so he gives the line to my little brother to hold as he grabs the nose pliers to get he hook outta the fish's mouth. little did he know, it wasnt a rock, it was a friggin fish! so my lil' bro is pullin this fish in and leaning against the side of the boat, and it starts to tip, and im all WTF! balnace the boat you FREAK! so we all turn and see this fish jump outta the water, it was PRETTY BIG, i mean like on those shows big, as big as a bass cold be, obviosly not like a marlin or something, duh so my other brother decides to help him,  but leans on the freakin' boat, so the boat's capsizing, BUT the fish is ALMOST in the boat, however, it gives one last tug and its bye bye fishy. The realization of the capsizing boat now sets in and my brothers rush to balance the boat, in fear of tipping over, my lil' bro drops the rod into the water as a reflex.  so no fish, no rod, and to dark to search, time to blaze. the next day however, the cath of hte day was the rod! good times, good times. ehh tired now, continue later

       what up g, dawgs, dizzles and doggettes   yeah okay, so i stole the title from katrina, but its fits so, it was only fitting to take it, im not creative gimme a break    so this blog has nohing to do with the days events just pointless rambling and bitching by me  that isnt recent nor not bitched about b4, its just down on paper now, or on virtual paper rather.    &nbsp;  Daddy Wasn't There    So first theres my dad, who im still not sure whether to love or to hate most of the time.&nbsp; Like yeah he cheated on my mom with a family friend, and tried to cover it up.&nbsp; IT went on for soo long him and my mom living a lie, pretending to be a happy family when they knew he was living some secret life, a bigass lie. Everyone knew in the family, but us, well i mean all the adults and children old enough to understand.&nbsp; Now, my mom's side OBVIOUSLY backs up my mom, nad hates him, and my dad's side OBVIOUSLY backs him up somehow they justified it.&nbsp; but their oldschool,&nbsp; my mom's sisters are all like "keep the family together to protect the sanctity of marriage (cuz i have a feeling some of them are doing that too, but we'll not get into that) but the younger ppl, are like "dumb the fucker like a bag o bricks"     long story short after much secrecy my mom told us, and after much tears, she kicked him out, she figured itd be hte only way he could learn   sure enough he hates life with her, stupid fucker, os now they ruined 2 families lives and both want back.&nbsp; (theres also some money shyte involved in the matter, her husband has a great job, and my mom has a great job, my dad works hard but nvr had money to show for it, speculation has it he was funding his other life, but thats speculation)&nbsp;    so again to shorten hte story, nigga wants back into the family and my mom is letting him   now i dont know about this still, but hes making the effort    maybe just cuz i was nvr really close to my dad in the first place, we nvr had stuff in common and i always feared that he didnt like me, he always bought my shyte so that we'd be close, his passion is music so starting with piano lesons for the brothers was the first step in getting close to us, i was the only one who didnt take an interest in the piano, so we nvr got close, last yea he bought me&nbsp;a sax (which showed his knowledge of me, considering i was playing clarinet at the time)&nbsp; Anyhoo i like hte sax so we bond on that level i guess, the only other thing we have in common is that we debate, although hes oldschool and i hate his views on current stuff like homosexuality and the role of males in life (mainly cuz i dont fit this standard male role)&nbsp;    so now hes trying to get back with us, he arrangeed a cottage trip and a camping trip (this is the man who HATES camping for the last 5 years we'd go camping and he'd opt out cuz he didn't like the idea of roughing it (unless this had something to do with the divorce and infedelity in some way)    so yeah i dont know what to do now love or hate, i mean he IS my father, but has he REALLY been a male role model?    &nbsp;   Smoke Screen    Next pet peeve is people who put up a fak personality or archetype just to pretend to be someone they are not   now myabe its cuz they wanna be excepted and all but iunno, maybe they do it unconsciously   now we can all sit here and say we hate "fake" ppl but what IS an architype REALLY, how can you truly be who YOU are, we all have adopted our personality somewhow, right, by the people we hang around with and our family and parents&nbsp; and such, of course there is that peronality in your genes, i think, but everything you see and anyone you meet effects your personality.    now i thought this girl, mandy, from work was fake as hell, the typical brown girl who parties out with ppl attracts the wierdest drama and then goes home and is the perfect little angel, this is how most western world brown girls are.&nbsp; SHE said that SHE hated fake people too, and i wanted to tell her that she was as fake as they come, but i didnt.   this OTHER girl from work told me that i wasnt brown enough, becouse i listen to rock music, go camping, cottaging and all the other things that i do.&nbsp; I'm NOT a thug, i DONT listen to ONLY rap music, thats NOT me, i am who i am, but then again, who am I?&nbsp; How did I get this archetype?&nbsp;    through family, originally i used to be that typical brown guy listening to rap music acting all thug, 'casue my cousoins used to do it, so i just took after them, but then my friends weremt at pearson and bosco they were the average pop culture people, cept for fusca the rocker who told me everyday that rap sucked, and i' fight him to the death on it, i guess they influenced the pop into my life, and then theres the new wave of influence, recently as my brother now plays drums and my other brother guitar, we learned that there is no muscianship in rap, and returned to the rock and pop, with the rap, hip hop and dance thrown in there, now i've ALWAYS like rock secretly, though my family thought it was weird that i did, but meh.&nbsp; So now i listen to almost everything, for different reason of course, rap and dance and sometimes pop is good to dance to, rock you cant really dance to, just kinda move ot hte rhythm, you listen to it and wanna run around, and pop is just easy listening, lest we forget te good ol' classic rock like led zepplin and stuff, good for chillin', and beatles is easy music to pick up on the guitar, piano, drums or the sax of course.   so now i wasn't always this way, does that make me fake too?    am i fake in what i do? I asked drew to pin my archetype and he couldnt, (of course i dont think he knows what an archetype is, he said mine was "the school vice president", dumbass!)&nbsp; either way does that make me unique or conforming to all types of people and being whatever when i need to be   and lets not talk about a certain someone we all know who is the epitamy of fakeness, not naming any names, he might be reading     &nbsp;  yup, thats enough for now, this is WAAAAAAY too long, and look, i didnt write one yesterday, ha!    &nbsp;

       Pssh theres no pink font   anyhoo   i realize that i am an idiot   though you may KNOW all the tactics or strategies or whatever that may get you want you want, your theoretical solutions may either not work in reality due to practicality, unknown variables or the fact that when faced with the situation you just forget.   Stupid me, girls dont like guys who explicitly like them, its like some stupid game, and i think it works vice versa too.   so in being stupid and saying all that crap in a previous blog, i realize that was BAD with a capital B, A and D.&nbsp; and thus ruining any chances with set girl, unless of course she doesnt know who she is, in which unlikely case, cool, im safe.   Either way, though you can tell someone everything about a relationship or what to do, when the chips are down its basically all that person and no one else.   I was looking forward the gathering after work, SOOO much, esp when my mom told me that I'd have the house to myself all evening,&nbsp; it was like the only thing i could think about all day, it got me through th e day, the fact that after work i could be doing all this shizzle.    Of course this didnt happen as andrew was working, and i had NO clue where donna or mita&nbsp;were, and christina was having some party of her own, so the cores of the crews were dispanded and thus the crew(s) were discombobulated and NOT at my house sippin' smirnoff on the patio like we should have been.   so bad day today, one of the few days where i was bored outta my mind, and not one prozzak in the house, so meh, sitting in front of the television playin' the box of x     &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       You know how we are, trying to decide what we are going to do today.   We (andrew, amanda, katrina and I)&nbsp; tried to make plans, after katrina refused to have anything at her place, grr squared [youre house cant be THAT small]   so yeah, katrina sujest running-a-muck around town, i sujest food preferably chinese buffet adn then possibly xbox or a movie, andrew was already going out with the fam, and amanda was for some odd reason on lockdown.   We were SUPPOSED to meet at the house on crescent hill, but it never happened, sad time, sad times.    however, amanda devised a plan that if we just showed up at her door then her mom would let us in, so naturally we did   me and katrina walked to her house.   I had to return a game, so i dragged them over to blockbuster, we met varun on the way, very odd, that krazy kid.&nbsp;    i felt bad that i made them come ALLL the way to blockbuster, so i bought them candy.   we went back to amanda's and played PSX, stupid katrina told me she had an xbox and i brought my games, but she DIDNT HAVE ONE!   *shakes fist*   so yeah. nothing important, oh except for the fact that we didnt pay attention to the street lights and had to run accross the street before getting hit by a car, and when katrina got into the shopping cart and i dropped her, nothing REALLY worthy of a blog. yet i write anyway     so yeah day is over     and i cant stop thinking about her,&nbsp; grr!      still can't bring myself to tell her how i feel though, too scared i guess, and blah blah blah, yeah i know you wont know until you try and yadda yadda yadda, but not like shes easy to read, i mean like like she explicitly likes me back, so how do you NOT want me to be nervous.     maybe its like when youre swimming, just dive into it and then its not so bad, or when you do something for the first time, it looks REALLY scary, but then it turns out to be nothing in the end.&nbsp; Within my endeavors today i made sure to see her, and cept for little stupid things, i still like her alot, FUCK! i hate this! this feeling that you want to have to make sure you like the person enough to ask them out, but hate to have 'casue until you actually DO ask them out it hurts, im sure SOMEONE else knows how that feels, hope she's not reading this blog, meh she prolly doesnt know who she is, or maybe she does, ah well, if she does I REALLY REALLY LIKE YOU, and if you don't like me back then thas okay, i'll live, but if you do PLEASE showo me something, im begging     meh, Natalie said it best, i should just strap on my fucking balls and tell the girl that i like her, if yes, then great, if no, our friendship can handle&nbsp;it

      Ah yes, just an ordinary day in the summer of steve, or summer of shock as amanda calls it wake up, head over to sam's house to visit the sleepless beauties (HA beauties, oh i slay me) and put back the basketball net that i had changed yesterday. This was also the rendezvous point for me and drews adventure through B-Town.&nbsp;  As usual, Drew is LATE!&nbsp;  LAZY BASTARD!  so yeah i get there, start watching SWAT, but then sam turns it off, (maybe she didnt want us there, who knows) so lazy bastard doesnt want to leave, and decides to call cash busters to se if they have what he wants, smart i guess, but meh.&nbsp; Then his sister calls telling him that she baited him out to his boss, (he was supposed to work, but used the babysitting excuse, but she told his boss that he wasnt babysitting, get it? got it? good!)  so agatha wants food, and instead of reasourceful andrew opening the fridge he decides to order some food.&nbsp;  I however, still wanna go to EB, but he can't cuz its RIGHT by his work. so i go while he is supposed to get food 10 mins later, he calls me hey steve, can you pick me up some WINGS from KFC, you know like FIVE for each of us" FIVE WINGS? what are you annorexic", i say, of course the boy meant legs, cant tell the difference btwn a leg and a wing,  but i digress uhh yes, then we start off to Cash Busters, or just "Busters" and find nothing good, and move on to Cash Converters. Andrew searches for his game console of his childhood, while i search for my childish party games for XBOX. he debates on nintendo or dreamcast, and decides to play a little guitar to clear his head pissing off the manager in the process  "i just wanna try out the pedals again, to see if i wanna buy it" he eds up with the cast of his dreams (dreamcast for you slow ppl) but NO GAMES!  we go BACK to Busters and buy unreal tournament and then im liike, lets try EB again, they have dreamcast games (secretly wanting gmaes for myself) so we go to the EB in the mall (NOT the first EB, but and EB nonetheless) in search for Crash Nitro Kart, i find NIKELODEON PARTY BLAST i dont know what the hell it is, but $27?! cant go wrong with dat! and also purchase crash for $34 ahh good ol' 4 player gmaes, never-ending-fun  (2 weeks later) WOW im bored of these games" -steve either way i KNOW amanda and katrina shall like these, hopefully anyway,  WOW this is long, the Adventure from EB to EB was one fit for blogging about, unless something else cool happens today, not even the great and powerrful OZ knows THAT one.

       Alright Kids Listen Up, 'Cuase I'm Only Gonna Say/Write this once.   (yes i AM aware that this stays forever unless i delete it, ANYHOO)   ALright, check it   I've always prided myself on the fact thatwe didnt have drama in our live, no regular teenage bullcrap like other crew   but i soon learned, that you can't run away from drama   this also extends into my family, but we're not gonna go into that at the moment.   So yeah, NOW we're starting to get into the stupidness by excluding certain people from our shindigs, falling in love or like with people in our group (which causes MAJOR problems, unless it works otus right)and such and such   theres no crazy cat fights or verbal abuse, but its beginning to bloom.&nbsp; I Kinda wanted this crew to last forever, but naive old me, i KNOW that won't happen, most of us will drop off after next summer, or the year after that, i've witnessed it with my brother and cousins, and know that it is inevitable, i just hope that our crew doesnt go to pieces before we part our sepereate ways    &nbsp;

      yeah, maybe its just cuz i just got this, but its just too fun writing in it and to think i bad mouthed it for SOOO looong anyhoo, i have no idea on how to mkae this thing look cool, maybe i hsould just fiddle around with it, or maybe i should ask someone, oh well all you cats are at sams, so no ones online, damn that sucks the only bad part of a blog is that you gotta watch what you say, you might offend someone, or say something you dont want some ppl to read, and its set in stone, although there's prolly a way to delete this shizzle, somewhere guess that stuff should be left to private msn convo's like who you like, and who likes who and who's invited to what party etc.  im glad no one doesnt not like me,&nbsp;cuz THAT would suck unless they do and dont tell me, which is good nonetheless, dont want to know if you do dislike me, meh. so yeah personal matters must be dealt with in private convos, too bad, cuz i REALLY wanna say that im thinking about 'her' all the FRIGGIN' time now, maybe its just me making myself feel this way, but this is the feeling i love to hate, i know that i REALLY like her, but i hate the feeling in the first place, im sure some of you know who "she" is, and "she" prolly does too (im SOO obvious, stupid me) i keep ya guessing though, esp donna, she thinks i like a new girl everyweek, stupid her, theres a difference btwn like, and LIKE, and i think i LIKE this one, my heart's finally coming around to what my mind's been telling it to like, maybe the mind will steer me in the right direction this time, instead of folowing my heart, which leads me to the same place, the fetal position in the corner of depression town  anyhoo, i create too much drama in my own life, stupid me i MAKE the 90210 inside my head, maybe y'all dont see it, maybe im just living it in my fantasy world that is my mind comment you! make me feel special

Then we play boggle, and anne marie informs us as to why she and amanda cant go swimming either, holy fuck man, cant you kids get waterproof ones or something, like the commercial, oh god stop thinking about it stop thinking about it *shudder* yes so very awkward talking about set subject, and then i smoke the teams of donna n anne marie and drew n amanda at boggle, yeah if we finished you know i would have won, and dont use the experience card against me, there were TWO of you! so yes very awkward day, but when it wasnt awkward it was&nbsp; good next time, try to shedule it with the lunar cycle if that is at all possible please, and can we PLEASE swim in the SUN!&nbsp;  oh god, now those damn commercials are more awkward than ever *shudder*&nbsp;&nbsp; and andrew GET A CLUE! a guys's life is SOOO easy, thats why women were oppressed, the rest of their life is hard, from&nbsp; puberty to childbirth to menapause, girls i gotta hand it to ya  cept of course youre the girls i like, then you are making me make my life complicated, stupid girls that i like! why do you hafta be so attractive *shakes fist*  &nbsp;

      well, this is my first blog and though i have criticized this for many months, yes months, from when ray siu had his, i didnt see the point in it, but i guess im coming around. its NOT REALLY the shocker of the century, you know me, i do what everyone else does to blend in, and then occasionally do something INCREDIBLY stupid or insane to stick out. As i Write this i continue to shake my head at what i have become. i too have succumb to the monster that is blogging, i call him blogglor. so yes, i guess im supposed to talk about my day but it just started so, all i did was play spider man 2  getting ready for sam's gathering dealie, her box social if you will. well ok i lie, im not getting ready right now, i've been ready since i had a shower when i woke up, i just gotta grab some socks and ill be out hte door in about an hour. well this concludes the day's message signed steve the conformitized&nbsp; quote of the day: "Life's a Wild Ride and I'm Riding Shotgun"

      man has noothing interesting happened since monday damn what happened to us this week  tuesday i cant even remember if anything happened, oh yeah the bowling fiasco, tried to go bowling, it ws ate lock in bash, decided to go see collateral but it had already started, just went to williams, trina almost got run over b cars, i had to help her cross the street.  Which btw sparked a dream i had where she was crossing and was about to get hit by a car when i ran to psh her ouitta the way, but i got clipped by the car and ended up in the hospital.   we then went to williams for a pie with ice cream on it, aka a waffle   stupid ruckus causing jeff decided to play with the sugar dealies, so i steal them from him, the entire condement set,but he takes the sugar rom the adjacent table, and spits in it!!! my gad, like honestly who does that!!!   so we leave after having our lattes and frapiss (not frappes [fra-pays], but frap-iss)   we then head over to timmies to cause ruckus in my store   bastards dirty the seats and tables and floors and im forced to clean in myself!!! like honestly!!.    so wednesday was frango's bday at mita's house, we got there at 5 and no one was home, waited a bit and they return, with allison who we havnt seen in AGES, good ol' annoying allison, who was surprisingly NOT annoying that day,  shes not REALLY THAT annoying, just occasionally as i remember it.  and soome random guy, Nabil [Nah-Beal], aka nibbles aka bill as some ppl arent familiar with middle eastern names. he didnt talk much and it took me 15 minutes to get his freakin name outta him, he just kept alluding the question. then i had to leave for sax lessons. me mums took FOREVER to pick me up, so i looked at sax books, gotta go back and buy these 2 disney ones, anyhoo, yeah get back to mita's food's there, half eaten and the booze is all gone, luckily i brought some of my own, not enough though, as i found out later.  katrina was wasted along with allison and hanna and friends were begging for booze, cmon ppl its not THAT great.   turns out i didnt even need to be drunk to have fun, i was quite content being sober.  i even tried i had whatever msirnoff i had and a shot of crown roayal, but nothing, meh.  Mit'as fucking brother was ruining my fun, kept talking and being there, thats all he had to do to piss me off, esp after when he was all "get off the trampoline guys, its mine" man i wanted to kill him!    ever since then things have not gone too well     thursday, disaster day   we head out for an everyday run of the mill biking trip, cuz you know, i felt like a fatty and thought i could use some exercise.   so sam brought dawn's bike back to her house, i met them there, then we went to amanda's to pick her up,   along the way, im quite antsy, tryna get rid of anger, frustration anxiety and whatever other feeling, not to mention use energy to loose weight   at amanda's we attach the scooter to the back, pretty standard procedure   so from hte start it spells trouble, we hafta go on the road cuz the sidewalk is too buumpy, the ppl in the cars are mad cuz they hafta weave outta the wa, cuz amanda is riding wide.  so me n amanda turn down the shortcut, while dawn n sam go the looong way around on the main roads, so me in my antsy need for speed mood, i decide that itll be a good idea to go faster, seems okay, so i go a lil' faster, but now THIS is WAAAY TO FAST! amanda bails and goes head first into the pavement.  with one tooth missing and one tooth shattered, we panick, dawn n sam are far away, and i have no clue what to do, we call sam, shes not home, call amanda's mom, shes not there, call sam again, and shes there, "amanda's badly injured!!!" i say, "we're coming" she replies "NO BRING YOUR MOM, AMANDA"S BADLY HURT" no my mom cant come   JUST BRING HER!!!   amanda is rushed to get emergency denistry, im flippin out cuz its all my fault, and i caused sOO many ppl SOO much trouble not to mention the pain amanda is in, but shes in shock supposedly and im crying for her.      friday we go visit her, and since she'll nvr get back on a scooter, i decided to buy her a brand new bike, i was nvr good with "sorry's" i nvr felt they did anything, "sorry doesn't cut it" i was always told, so i cant say it, it means nothing to me anymore, so i said sorry the only way i knew how, with a bike and tears, i still dream about it, its getting less frequent though, first day everytime i closed my eyes i saw amanda fall, but still thinking about it, im pushed to tears to think this was all caused by my stupidity, ive REALLY gotta start thinking things through, so amanda, though this wont ease the pain, nor will it give you your real tooth back, im sorry, truly, sorry, i just wasnt thinking, and now its pointless to cry over spilt milk, but these last words are filled with tears    finally today, saturday, i dread the alarm, dread putting on my uniform and dread going to work   busy as always, but at least joel's there to brighten up the day   so i go about my baking and dont get a helper, eventually raj helps me, and its good, but my boss keeps riding my ass, the donuts arent made in a flash, holy fuck, so its as usual annoying customers, dumbass co-workers but today im in my killing mood, and i wanna just deck these dumb kids   esp this one little asian girl karla, she thinks my job is easier than hers, HA, fool, first shes this 4 foot, petite girl who cant even reach half the stuff, shes SO slow and cant even carry a box of coffee, so she thinks all my job is, placing donuts in an oven, and dipping them, sure enough it IS, however, its making 100 donuts an hour, now that doesnt seem like much to you kids, BUT from freezer to front it takes about 10 mins per donut type, there are 20 types of donuts that must be filled at all times. not to mention the clean up which is about an extra 5 minutes, and all the stupid shit they make you do so its perfect, now it takes 2 bakers, working as fast as they can to get the job done properly on a saturday morning, so let me tell you bitch, tim hortons baker isnt all sunshine lollipops.   anyhoo, at the end of my shift, i go to grab my shit, and my phone's missing, i tear apart the entire break room, and even get some otheres to help, its nowhere, who the fuck takes a cell, obviously no one would steal it cuz they'd get booked too easily, the suspect list is too short.    so either someone was being a bitch and hid it or someone was being an idiot and took it by mistake.  now stupid me, didnt turn the phone on in hte morning, so its off, and theres no way to contact it, so im phoneless, adn crippled cuz i have NO ONE PHONE NUMBER, depending on msn to get ppl to go somewhere, but no one's online!!   oh i skipped the fact that i was dead tired and went to church and dozed off, little did i know that mr peressotti was behind me, THAT was embarassing!!!   so phoneless, embarassed and all dresed up and no where to go, not the GREATEST saturday, but not the wrost, no i lie, if i dont get my phoe back this will be the WORST saturday ever!!!   hopefully sunday will end this crappy streak!

       alright so im lagging behind saturday was a fun day, but im   not gonna bore yu with the details, if you wanna read about it go to trina's, amanda's or donna's blog cept add work prior to the adventure.    Sunday aug 8 pizza pizza presented Z103's 12th annual SUMMER RUSH! with grove coverage, aluna, jenna g, original 3, 2 play, nina sky, stevie b, haducci, cascada and the z103 djs. (yeah i realize most of you reading this have NO CLUE who these ppl are, unless youre annemarie or maybe jen) anyway for you rockers its warped tour minus the marijuana and plus the tobacco [dumbass ginos and their cigarettes] and add dancing and not just groovin' to the music. anyhoo I LOVED IT, and though there was no musicianship in the songs just synthesized shizzle, it IS actually hard to make different synthesized songs that are catchy. anyhoo, after the jam there after party was in the adjacent club, good times, why dont guys just friggin dance instead of waiting on the side to grind with some girl oooh this is fun, its like we're having sex, but we're not, dancing is fun as it is, okay fine, maybe its cuz im not as good looking as those ginos and too scared to grind with someone, but it doesnt look that fun anyway. if i wanted to pick up a girl it wouldnt be at a club, most of them are dumb, half are just plastered with make-up and the rest are sluts that just want the male models. if there were to be girls that i would like at a club theyd be HARD to find and arent at clubs to meet guys like me, just to dance with friends or the captain of the highschool soccer team. and one mor thing to bitch about, girls if you dont want guys to dance with you, DONT DRESS UP SCANDALOUSLY or DANCE SCANDALOUSLY, dumbass girls, dont bait the hook if ya dont wanna catch fish kks enuf bitching, good music anyway, and BEAUTIFUL girls, fun to gawk at, not to talk with you know how it is.    came back at about 3, slept at 4ish, woke up at 8 to go to wonderland quite funny, i went kinda blindedly, i was supposed to meet regis and 2 of her friends whom ive never met from woodbridge. We made this date last week, but i wasnt sure if we WERE ACTUALLY going, alright im not THAT crazy, she DID send me an email that i picked up b4 i slept saying that she'd be there. so i get the express and wait for her, but shes not there!!!! and i dont have her number!!! so im stressin', FINALLY she shows up an hour late, and i thought I was gonna be late. so the place is PACKED, we go on a couple rides, and she looks bored as hell, so i ask her hwats wrong, and shes like, yeah i dont REALLY like this place, and im like HOLY FUCK, we coulda gone somewhere else, it just seemed ideal cuz you live near it, so we leave and chill at williams for an hour and then head home, then i went to the mall with amanda n trina to get francine's gift, ha ha best gift EVER, kks so not the BEST gift, but at least its kinda creative. meh yup then i got to sleep today, 10hrs in one weekend, thats less than dawn sleeps per day, but less sleeping is more living, i think we should start our adventures earlier and end them later more often, anyhoo, thats catching up, my blog is SOOO boring btw, man, THIS is why blogs are dumb, if we all do stuff together, whats hte point of writing about it, NOW I REMEMBER why i hated these things, oh well cant stop now

      Bow down to Harold n Kumar, the new jay and silent bob so we FINALLY see friggin Harold and Kumar, the movie that we were destined NOT to see so we get there 715 ish and go to the movie, and i decide to get candy, wow i eat tooo much, goitta cut down, watch my weight anyhoo, yeah and because of this candy excursion i meet drew n josh, without this candy trip it woulda just been me trina and amanda, stupid andrew "i was on time, i came exactly at 7:40" the movie STARTS 7:40 dumbass! anyhoo, so we return to the movie with milk duds in hand, id share, but im scared ppl dont know how to eat them, and last time i had to administer the heimlich, k maybe not, but kat DID choke on 'em so after the movie we have nothing to do, and the trouble makers drew n josh, decide to do stupid things like swing upside down on the display playsets at home depot and light shit on fire, i wouldnt be surprised if they stole something from A&P yeh yeah im straight edge you may say, you may even say im a prude, but fuck you, i dont care dont get me wrong, i like to light fires and do crziness to, but theres a time and a place for everything so then we had nothing to do, so we decided to leave andrew and josh left us, and on the way to my house, I had the brilliant idea of going to denny's to eat the immitation white castle burgers so we get there and magro, noel, rodne and white are there, apparently its their hangout place, theyre regulars so we decided we too need a place to be regulars and williams is now our place anyhoo, we get our food and some random lady is like "hey mini burgers, those kids must have just seen that move, white castle, well i got news for you kids, this aint white castle"  and i was like "were not high either, dont judge us" cazy denny's people are too crazy and friendly at night so as usual white,scott noel, and rodne make fun of me, but meh and then we left i picked up the bill of course, it was like a reflex "seperate bills?" "no" iunno, stupid nice guy syndrome, i walk ppl home, i buy ppl dinner, open doors and all the other chivalrious things oh did i forget hte ride over to denny's, ha no room in car, amanda wasnt even sitting on the seat, and i had mike constantly telling me to "tap one of them" to which i replied "were just friends jackass" (side effect of nic guy syndrome, girls fall for the bad asses) ah yes, good times good times, and those burgers were SOOOO friggin good, not to mention the chicken wings n strips

      they need more fonts  in this shizzle, meh cant complain it IS free what colour today hmmm enie. meenie. mini  purple!   so wake up this morning and im like, CRAP i have NO FOOD to make for tihs picnic and im TOO LATE to swing by sobeys, SO i just grab the kite n the rod, n amanda's mini-board and head off to sam's.  Turns out only amanda's there, sam n drew are late, damn i woulda compensated for them but drew's been on time lately so i figured today would be no different, meh there WAS a blue moon on saturday, maybe the effects are wearing off now, too bad, guess my wish didnt come true, yet...   so me n amanda watch na na lan, and i know what youre thinking thts like a 5 minute show,  NUH UH! NOT THIS ONE    ! this is the 30 minute one   HOLY CRAP, so slow, but SOOOO funny, she put "yums" cereal (cherios) onto her pizza    then we go downstairs cuz dawn d/l-ed a a evanessence- everybody's fool REMIX, it was odd, but oddly good, and we downloaded more songs, while playing TEXT TWIST, amanda can smoke anyone at that game, drew FINALLY friggin shows up, 2hrs 15 minutes late, and we head to the lake   3 of us on bikes, manda on the scoot board n drew on the skate board   when    we get to the lake, drew is tired of riding his inefficient transportation cehicle (though if we were hopping any fences, he just might beat me to it on that shit) [skateboards are for tricks not for transport   so he attatched to my bike and i pull him "youre too slow" he complains, so i speed up, and 2 seconds later the boy falls, oh goo times   we get to the park and get nostalgic, ahhh to be a kid again, we try to fly the kite, get frustrated and just skip it and go to lunch 'course no one brought food, SO we just went to 241   then we decide to leave for jefferson park, andrew wipes out again, but on his own free skateboard crapness.   we see a fisherman, and decide to try our luck, no bait though, so pizza and gummies, but they dont work, next time corn, worms or mini marshmellows, instead we just fed the ducks pringles and watched them battle   then we went to jefferson park to play again, with the zip line thingy and the swings, where i hurt myself by jumping at the wrong time off the swing.     then to amanda's as sam turned us away like katrina sad with the innkeeper bible thingy   we play monopoly, and stupid donna seems to take an early lead as i gave her the oranges for my railroads, and she built her hotels, she however had only those 3 n electric company, while the rest was shared by mostly me, some sam, and a minute amout to amanda.   so the only 2 of i kioind i had was the light blues, vermont n coneticut, but dawn wouldnt gimme ORIENTAL!!!!! no matter what, so with my business savvy i saved up, and made some trades to get some other monopolies, you may say that i was on the losing end of these trades as i gave MUCH better properties for crappier ones BUT it had to be done, a dying amanda n sam were desperate, and me barley staying alive with no monopoly in sight HAD to find a awy to take down dawn, i acquired the purples and built an empire with them and the railroads at the base,  i eventually did SOMETHING to get hte greens and then it was all downhill for dawn, amanda went banrupt on me, and i built upon her reds, traded with sam to get st charles and sealed sam's fate, with the entire board in my control save the oranges, waterworks and FUCKING ORIENTAL! i was destined to beat dawn, she sold her hotels to pay park place, bartered waterworks for a hotel ( a lil' charity work by me) BUT STILL WOULDNT GIVE UP ORIENTAL AVENUE! i eventually forced her into bankruptcy, BUT i didnt get my oriental, not even for $4000, stupid bitch, BUTTERFLY EFFECT  BUTTERFLY EFFECT   BUTTERFLY EFFECT   (donna thought those were swear words when i said them for some reason)     meh wonder what would have happened if hse gave me oriental in the beginning, maybe i woulda lost, considering that was my drive to win!   oh yeah did i mention all the shizzle that we didnt have a camera for, drew falling TWICE, the scootboard-bike itself, drew in the monkey bars, steve breaking himself, sam breaking her head, the crazy digger thingy, what else, there MUST have been more   anyhoo, this blog is running long, but theres just SOO much to talk about, and so much that i left out like the insane bug that we couldnt name and donna singing ROCK MUSIC *shudder*, stupid mainstream rock

      yeah, not much interesting has happened lately, nothing to write home about, or write on the blog. its just the usual same ol' useless shizzle. chasing that girl still, well not anymore, but i dont think shell want me to write about that, and i dont really want to either, though most of you ppl reading this already know, but nonetheless anyhoo, brief summary of my life, just to log my summer, not that its interesting or worth reading, theres no bitching, no beef, no controversy, nothing in this blog, so its not REALLY worth reading.  friday was mita's little thing, i wanted to go, but didnt wanna rush my parents home, it wasnt THAT big of a deal to go, so we stop over for dinner on the way home, and i figure ill never make it home in time.  I got home at 9:30, and unpacked like ive nvr unpacked before, just to go.  and sure enough, good times, good times, trampoline,   canadian, starsky and hutch, and our good   friend ouija, although he didnt answer any of my questions,  grrrr  , its funny though how ouija is right sometimes, actually its freaky, like somethings that the people touching the finder can't know themselves, how can it know, after a ceertain story regarding my own life, i actually started to believe in the whole ouija thing, scary to think that it could actually foretell the future though, meh    saturday was a BIIIG disapointment, i was looking forward to seeing Harold n Kumar hte WHOLE DAY, from 6am when i woke up, and all through the work day, what i was looking more forward to was the stupid plan we concocted to get me n her alone under the blue moon, or "coyote" moon, but it wasnt meant to be, maybe it was a sign, but worst day EVER!      sunday was no better, again as i was promised an excursion to see H&K, it was doomed to failure due to circumstances beyond our control.  i guess the only good thing that came outta that day was that fusca and katrina became friends again as they shared in their interest for rock bands and I got to see fusca for the first time in two years,  that crazy kid.  what started off as a plan to see harold and kumar and possibly chillin at courtney park, turned into a trip to silvercity with me, fusca and his friend to see bourne supremacy (a good movie aswell) meh, so the night wasnt a total let down      yesterday, monday, was a pretty good day, went to amanda's place and had a "jackass moment."   amanda held onto a cable which was attatched to my bike, and sat on her skateboard, and i attempted to pull her.  our attempts were in vain as we learned that we could not turn without flinging maanda into oncoming traffic.  we then proceeded to sam's house to kill some time, and we bet on what sam would say, and sure enough she said her usual "ok...hii..." etc. you know her, then we went to christina's place, the crazy palestians, they wont let you leave until they feed you, which would be okay, if christina didnt keep shoveling food into your plate, too much humus!!!!  Then we went to our favourite punk rocker's house, CHRITINA OBREJA!!, haha that poser, oh she makes me laugh, and i dont even know her.   she was all "look at me, i used to be a gina from Romania, but NOW...tadaa...I'm a punk rocker that doesnt know hte first thing about punk rock, i just like to copy katrina, so that guys will like me" dumbass, guys like girls who arent fake, unless ofcourse theyre fake too, so maybe shell find another fake gino punk rocker guy, in her endeavours, i bid her good luck.  oh yeah, why'd we go there, yeah to get katrina's bike, which btw her brother took to his friends house, and left it there, because his bike was stolen, WTF! who does that!!! haha dumbass is riding a girls bike, hes just as cool as his sister, dumbass people.  Then we proceeded to the NittyGrittyBramaChingWingDing (i still think it needs a "Jama" after brama NittyGrittyBramaJamaChingWingDing)  where andrew was ironically on time and we were late, youre supposed to be on brown time!!!   so we go to the carnival thingy, which katrina is super scared of, its too "shifty" as she says   it took us forever to decide what ride we should go on, and since we3 were an odd number it was quite difficult, the ferris wheel was out cuz itd be popintless for one of us to go alone, so we decided to go on "the scrambler" where amanda got crushed and andrew held christina's hand (ooooooh) and katrina got flung around the dealie almost breaking her shoulder.  despite all this pain, however, they decided to go AGAIN!! FREAKS!   then we ran to watch fefe   she was great, and drew loved the guitarist, hed marry him if he had t he chance i think.   "bye bye boyfriend" was her last song, theres a stroy about that too, but thats for certain ppl only!   then we found hana and francine who were in front of us the whole time!   then there was fireworks to oldies music, that didnt go at all. but it was oddly fun, nonetheless   so we go home, to my house i mean, and andrew for some reason makes his dad pick him up from my house, which is stupid cause ching woulda been closer, so as soon as we get home he goes.  oh and on the way home we tried to take a pylon, but ditched it along hte way, then stole one of those "event parking" signs, good times, good times.   Yeah, then me and trina just ate popcorn on the patio, watching the lightning show, and sat in the drizzle.   pretty good night, all in all
