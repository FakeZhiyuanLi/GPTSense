      My friend dave just informed me - He will dance on my grave and wonder what killed me.  the smoking, the boozes, or the sex?  I inform him I will laugh at him from hell when he shits his pants as a senile 93 year old man.  stripping naked and scaring the other bittys in the retirement home.  I will be dead but I got to skip  that  fucking painful future. dave only snickers.

      tired of missing something.  a link.  a hole.  where it counts.  hating that my life is 1800 miles away.  tring to start over.  and instead I chain smoke and write about how I can't stand it.  I miss a life I started five years ago.  and a jobless existence today.  tomorrow.  the day before that.  I can't seem to place myself in the right mind frame.  I can't seem to except this life.  here.  in Texas.  I dreamt of running away to Cali.  San Fran.  where the street car is called a trolley.  and then I picture myself away, far away from this sadness.  of starting over in a city where I lived and yet it didn't wait for me.  hard.  yet sunny.  rainy.  yet full of familiar faces.  I can't seem to grab on to anything concrete.  real.  or steady.  I am just floating through this.  floating.  until the rent check bounces.  and the bills are stacked so high I could build a fort.  I am just lost.  lost here. in a sea of family and friends that I don't remember and who don't know me any longer.  Things, they change and become malleable like putty.

      I'm up.  wondering how things have come to pass.  by. me.  wondering what is and what should never be.  chain smoking and drinking well pass the time bars kick you out.  laughing at old friends.  imagining them in a cabin.  snow. like that of an old horror movie.  maybe something as cheesey as "April Fools".   that thought passes and I am still up.  wondering what ever became of you.  why you didn't live up to the potential I saw you in.  shedding you like an extra skin.  and then I laugh at the story you told.  I was into it.  I will always find time for you. but alas. alack. AHHH the rub.  here we are again. Texas rain.  the smell of dew dancing against my brain.  you were always a tricky one, you.

      crazy fuck.  victim of her past.  bitter. lovely.  tired. self distructive. self important. selfless.  anti-social.  social butterfly.  lazy. laid back. pensive. contrived.  depressed. are these things you think of me?  Tell me.  And how would you know really?  When we share a relationship through a fucking lap top.  20,000 miles away and can't even make sense of me.  I suppose I should stop leaving you drunk emails.......

      I am jobless.  without a care in the world.  smokeless.  tired of digging through dirty ashtrays for a hit of that sweet cancer stick.  drunk.  every night.  from all the wine and beer friends brought as house warming gifts.  days are filled with hung over ahh of the emails I sent before.  stalking friends.  hoping for forgiveness.  but only being  reminded daily in my dreams.  drunk ramblings to a boy at sea.  who might not even remember what my face looks like.  the smell of my hair after a warm bath.  the way his fingers are left sticky from the heart between my legs.  bitter blogs.  like this one where I tell a infinite space of other connected freaks what a bleeding heart I have.  seems I'm depressed.  started this blog fest to get off livejournal so I could really discuss my crusty feelings.  I can't control the intake of breathe or the constant sighs that leak from my lungs like that of a tire struck with spikes. I read comic books about other bitter hearts to rock me gently into sleep.  only to wake up to my body shivering from a nightmare.  one I can't remember. letters home to old friends in Philly.  how I miss them dearly and wish I had taken advantage of their smiles.  their laughter when it flushes their faces sweet.  and all those damn cover letters to jobs where I claim I am the addition they need. all this internet exploration is leaving me tired.  all these emails are leaving me cynical and cheap.  I must face and somehow facilate this new facet of my personality.  a bum with pocket chain and half smoked cigarettes.

        Have you ever felt like you were stuck in a box. A small box, with very little room to breathe. Your legs cramp from the loss of blood, and your mind begins to wonder in the darkness of it all. And no matter how much you pound and pound your fist on every angle of every surface of that box nothing happens. No one comes. There is no response to your echo of cries. And if you could see outside this box, you'd realize that its really glass and everyone can see in. They can see you but you have no idea because you are lost in that darkness that you believe is the box, but really its just your mind blinding you. Well, I am in this box. and this box is about to drive me to a very mental, very late demise. I woke up tonight, after trying to go to bed. Because only depression puts me to sleep. and I woke up sobbing. Sobbing like I might have when I was a little girl. And nothing could save me. No one there to hold me. No one to brush away my hair from my tear drenched face and make some great joke about snot. Or puffy eyes. or the way I sound like I'm laughing when I'm crying. Nothing there to comfort this broken heart. And god I know I sound disgustingly depressing but this is MY blog and it is for the angsty part of me that is still a sixteen year old suicide wannabe, or nursing drug addiction, or a raging sex fiend. No this is me in all my glory, and now as I type this cry for help, I cry and sob and yes laugh. but there is no one here to brush away that one tricky strand of hair. or hold me. hug me. Kiss my eyelashes full of sleep. Instead I have cigarettes, portishead cd's, and a fucking empty heart. I think I'm losing part of myself. and I can't do anything to rectify the situation. I am just a fool. Sitting here on my stupid mound of dirt and decay. and I have nothing to show for anything. just the loss of my individuality, the loss of my ability to stand alone, and not let others hurt me. Its all so convoluted. This box. This darkness. It just seeps in and makes me want to end it all, go crazy, or drink myself into a hole. and the walls, they shape shift, and ooze like liquid. Sometimes there are brillant flashes of light in my room as I lay awake. Other times I just hear voices. Perhaps too many hits of acid as a young child, or just the box, once again echoing my pounding fists against its sides. Breaking off into ripples and waves in my waking life. I suppose this is just one of those lifes where once in a while even those who are strong enough to mock the truth of things, also get royally and utterly depressed.

          Long Distance Drunk.       How Strange, this need to water down ones heart, In hopes that it might cure the ach from all this gravity, This gravitational pull of absence. How Strange, that in my darkest hour- mile markers are our only common bond. A bond that drifts out to sea and one can only hope it will return again.  Long Distant drunk. Me.  How Strange, writing you, fighting you with my type writer, Trying to get a handle on all of this mixology. How Strange, holding up this weight against the gravity of my wet heart strings.     Long Distant drunk. Me.  Floating in this.... wading out..... trying to carry the weight....    of a bottle and a broken heart .

      I am feeling a bit maniac today.  I tend to sing aloud and tap my foot to the random radio frequencies in my head.  Frankie says Relax.  I am doing that today.  Somehow.  Regardless of how much I want to naw off my hand, run off the road randomly, or drink myself into a stupor.  I am mainly breathing today.  Short intakes of breathe followed by a long exhale, sweet and hot...Sometimes sticky from my tongue.  Which finds its self lashing out at the media, fucking road rage, and any one whom seems disagree with my ways.  I am a loaded gun these days.  Drunk and angry.  I suppose I should start writing about the real issues instead of these drunk ramblings at 3 in the am.  Vodka never solved anything.

      one of my oldest and dearest friends spent the night last night.  She and I got nice and drunk and had a riot girl moment.  I just realized that I am a complete and utter mess.  I am now processing everything that happened to me in Philly in the last six years.  I'm regretting pain I caused people, guys I dated or just slept with, friends I choose.  and I suppose that is why I am being haunted by this one person in particular.  I just realized what I did, why I did it, and how I wish I could take it all back.  I also leveled with my friend on a few incidents involving an EX childhood friend who recently raped me, my father, my father's best friend, and some guy in a park.  I am having a fucking girl moment and I feel like screaming at the tops of my lungs until my vocal cords rip.  I guess in my heart of hearts that is why I broke his heart.  I suppose I deserve this now.  This unsettling feeling like I might never see some people again.  ever.  I don't even know why I am rambling about it just yet.  I need to sit with it a while.  Center my chi.  Breathe out and hope maybe somewhere else he is breathing in.

      4,000 job applications later, I devised a plan.  this plan comes to me after another nightmare staring that damn bunny, a knife, and a key chain.  a long interview process later with not such a great outcome, and watching a friend dating someone who is much better than any man.  I say this of course, but who am I to speak when I am having a relationship with a lap top and an email address.  so after I decided to scream, cry and laugh all at the same time, I got off my ass and just got on with it.  I applied at a record store today and I am going to sign up for bartending school tomorrow.  I just want to get my fucking masters and get on with my life.  and did I mention its fucking hot in Texas.  I'm ready to move back to Philly and live in a basement apartment with no electricity and no food.  I guess it could be worse, I could be Bush.  (go see Michael Moore's new movie...it makes you want to stab your eyes out...brilliant liberal propaganda)

       Seems I am stagnant. Bored in a city I've lived in for only three months (not to mention years ago). But I'm not doing what I want. I'm not writing anything new. I'm jobless and therefore not able to get back on schedule for the things I am currently trying to publish. I'm trying to get this website going and everyone around me loves the idea  but  on game day isn't interested or self motivating. I guess I'm just use to having constant change, constant excitement, &amp; constant artistic ideas flowing around me. I'm bored. so if anyone wants me I'll be at the bar. Drinking my last bit of liver and other vital organs into a stupor. I can't get on board in this city. Its sucks. Stagnant and drinking is all I seem to muster around here.       I'm out like the fat girl in dodge ball,   Hbomb

      Let it be known. That I am alone. I have been MIA for the past two weeks. After locking my keys in my cars repeatedly, several interviews, and a car accident that totaled my car and has left me broke, I have to say it has been a trying week. And the boy came and went. He took leave and we hunkered down and built tents out of books and bed linens. And I held onto his leg as he tried to board his plane this morning....ok I made that part up but its funny. In my head at least. So I don't know what to do with myself or how to act. He is all over me. His presence fills my apartment and leaves me morbidly alone. as if I am returning to the scene of some horrid crime. where the act of ones being there still hangs in the air like a residual haunting.
