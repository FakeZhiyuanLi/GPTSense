      I guess it boils down the bottom of the pot today.  I'm lonley.  I don't know why I should be.  It's not like I don't have family or friends.  I have plenty of those.  I have a companion, Dragon.  I have been told we have termidly what would be called a boton marraiag.  We arn't married though.  We are going to be getting a house togeather though.  I help to take care of her child.  Like the major male role in her sons life.  So am almost always happy when he is around.  I am upset some what that Dragon claimed my privates and now won't let me get laid or masturbate.  It is all because she is testing a theory that I am addicted to sex or not.  I think I am a nymph, I love sex, I love to get it as often as I can, and when I am not getting it, well for the first month or so I get cranky then get over it.  It's not like I have to have it all the time.  I just love to have it all the tiem.  *Sighs*  I wish she would have talked with me about it a bit more, instead she does this to me.  And what ever her theory is she says that she beleives it has been proven correct.  She has irriated me so much on this.  Mostly cuz I don't know what to think.  Its not like it was  self exploration process for myself, just something really frustrating that made me feel like I was being pushed away again.  Wich is just flat out depressing.  We are companions for christs sake.  We are lovers for another.  And we used to be sexual partners before she decided I was being pushy with sex.  You know and sometimes all I want or care about is cuddles, you know.  I love to kiss her lips and feel her soul and aura.  I love to carress her hair and touch her spirit.  I love looking into her eyes and seeing the passion and fire there.  Of course I don't turn her on any more.  She mentioned that.  And i'm not talking about physically.  I guess I would be a great person to masturbate to or something, but when she thinks of me in the terms of personality, she feels that she doesn't know me.  I've been here for her to explore the entire time.  I like to share with her.  Except when she starts debating on things like this.  Things that I have had to come to terms with way way long ago.  For hell fires sake if I hadn't come to terms with it I would be dead, or have aids or soemthing.  I know i havn't been the choosiest of the people I've slept with, but I have never contracted any diseases.  And she has been the only one I have slept with in a long long time.  So I don't understand.  If I was really addicted to sex all that much wouldn't I have gone out and gotten bootie some where else?  Even full well knowing I wouldn't get laid and having offers from other people, I have stayed home just cuz I wanted to enjoy her company.  GOD THIS IS FRUSTRATING.  I JUST WANT TO ENJOY BEING WITH HER AS HER COMPANION AND LOVER.  IS THAT SO MUCH TO ASK FOR?  Is it so much to ask to be trusted based on the actions I've shown.  I may not be the most perfect person in the world, yea i've broken promises.  But I have always stood by her.  I have always been here.  Even when with my own family I have told them to fuck off and go away.  Or ran out the door and said leave me be.   I know that I can be a royal pain some times.  Usually though I only like to be relaxed and chill.  The more I push the more I tend to push back.  Especially if I feel pushed on something that I really don't like.  So that is my fault for not informing her of this prior to it happening.  I forgot to mention it cuz we didn't have problems with it before, and I thought I had put it past me.  I am a very competitive person.  Now that I think about it though, the times that I have been pushed I told the person to fuck off and walked away.  I didn't stick around to find out anything more, I just walked away.  I figure if you can't accept who I am for the time being and that I will and can change my opinion if it is given to me in a constructive manner, like not yelling at me or critisizing me unduely, then you don't deserve to be around me.  That is what it all boils down to with me.  I know she has a good hear, Dragon I love her to death, but I don't like to be pushed into something I don't want to do.  And I really don't like doing things that people require of me just because they say so.  I will do it cuz I love you, I will do it cuz your my friend, I will do it even because you've been a good person to me, but not cuz you require it of me.  You and your little dog and ride off into the sun set on that little poney that you came in on, spank your monkey a couple of times on the way, and then shove the poney up your ass if you think I'm doing it cuz you told me to, and not cuz I wanted to do it.  It has been a long ass time since I did anything just because someone told me to do it.  I have quite jobs because I didn't want to do what they wanted any more, I have told friends and family alike to not bother me any more because I didn't want to do it any more, who the hell is any body to tell me that I am doing something just cuz I have been told................   Fuck it, i'm getting to pissy and need to go to bed.  I need human interaction, this is who I am.  I need someone to curl up next to, this is who I am.  I need to feel loved, this is who I am.  Even if the person I feel loved by is only me.  This is who I am.  I have lived on my own.  I have gone crazy on my own.  I have accomplished great things on my own.  I don't need any body.  However, the human interaction keeps me sane, I accept this.  The cuddling keeps me warm and fuzzy inside, I accept this.  Being pampered by someone, complamented by someone, feels warm and fuzzy.  I like the warm fuzzy feelings.  Now I am really ranting.  Good night!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Recently I have decided that I dont' feel like a well worth guy.  Thre are so many things in this life that I wanted by this age.  Non of wich I have accomplished.  I promissed myself that I would have finnished school.  That I would be married to a good woman, barley escaped a couple bad situations that may have put me under if I had married though.  Dragon the love of my life isn't interested in anything more than friends.  This suxors.  On the bright side I guess i'll be setting up a couple of web servers.  One for Camarrila, Live action role playing for vampires.  I will be a Tremere, which is a magic user.  I really havn't been able to develope my character all that much.  So it looks like I may need to get an updated version of Laws of the Night.  Then I am trying to do some programming for my business web site.  It's not like I don't know that I am a good guy.  I am a really good guy actually.  I've been a great friend to several people.  I've been an excelent lover.  For some reason though I put myself in situations that seem to be a lil tough on me.  Tougher than I should have let them get.  Dragon feels like she doesn't know me.  I feel like I am the same person that she met last year.  I am not sure how I have shown her someone different than what I am.  I know that I am bipolar, which beleive me doesn't help at all.  I just hoped she might understand a lil more about it than it seems sometimes.  She is a beautiful woman and any guy would be lucky to be with her.  To be honest I think her and I both deserve better than either of us have gotten.  I know she loves me deeply.  She does show it enough.  I'm just ranting cuz I'm upset.  She doesn't seem to want to trust me very much on some things.  Ah well, I can only be who I am.  ME!  So it is all good.  I will keep moving and going until one day I drop.
