       It's been busy this past week, I've been in Boston with my sister and her girlfriend and other members of our family for the convention.  Its been great, got to see a lot of great speeches and meet a lot of interesting people.  And the atmosphere has been unbelievable.  We don't have many plans for today and tomorrow--probably we're going to see a little of the city and maybe take a drive out to Cape Cod.  Then we fly home Sunday.  A few buttons I've seen around town that I like:   "I'm not anti-Bush; I'm pro-intelligence"  "I'd be much happier about tax cuts if I had an income to get taxed."  "George W. Bush: The best reason yet for Canadian citizenship."  "No CARB Diet for 2004: No Cheney, Ashcroft, Rumsfeld, or Bush."  "Make the scary Republican go away."  "We ought to seriously consider outsourcing Congress"  "Somewhere in Texas, there's a ranch missing an ass."  "Another Bush, another recession, and another war to cover it up."  "Well behaved women rarely make history."  "Anyone who claims God is on their side is dangerous as hell.  "Bush/Orwell 2004"

       The good news is that my friend Annie has been offered her job back.  But it looks like she's not going to take it so she can go ahead with a lawsuit.  In a way, I can see her point and it'll be good to nail them for what they tried to pull.  And do it before they can build up some phoney case against her.  But how to feel about it?  I am not sure.  Because I know how passionate she is about teaching.  Sigh.      Could a move to a west coast college be in the future?  That is not something I had thought about before, but it could be possible.  The drawbacks would be being further away from my family.  Especially if my dad makes a career move he's thinking about....      ...And speaking of Dad, some local party people are talking to him about a possible run for Congress in a couple of years if our rep retires or gets a job in a Kerry White House.   How cool is that?!  He could probably win here.  He hasn't decided whether or not to do it.  He said he's focused right now on helping Kerry get elected and then after that, he'll think about the future.  So we'll see.  Maybe if he won't run my sister will.      My sister really needs to update her Livejournal more.  Why have a blog and not write in it?      I think that is all for now.  Yes.

       Well I'm realy ticked off right now. I have a friend who is a teacher (not at the school I am at, nor even in my district). She's very good at what she does, and has the results and the numbers to prove it.       If we're supposed to be talking about accountability in education, then she's one of the best teachers out there and she should be rewarded for it.    But that's the way it is.      Why not?  Because Annie is not a conformist and she doesn't teach the watered-down flag waving version of history that everyone else does.  And on top of that, she's gay.  So instead of awards, she gets harrassment and grief and trumped up accusations that some pencil pushing bureaucrat pulls out of his ass.      I wish my school had a teacher who had the kind of courage that Annie Riley does.  I wish the history department had a teacher or two like her, you know, teachers who actually know the subject.  But instead, no one wants to rock the boat.  Well fuck that.    Let's get a few things straight about history. America is not always the good guy. American leaders fuck up. American leaders are human like everyone else and they are not above criticism just because the wrap themselves in a flag. Just look at Vietnam or Iraq if you don't believe me.    The president or the guy pretending to be president is not supposed to be above being criticised for his actions. Being American does not mean that we shouldn't think critically.       We should not whitewash history to make things seem better than they are. Its what we call free speech and that is not conservative or liberal, but American.      I'm sick of this crap. I've had it with people who don't think. I've had it with people who act as if liberal means the same thing as wrong or even evil. I've had it with people trying to trample free speech.       I've had it with narrow-minded bigots trying to shove their religion down my throat. I've had it with narrow-minded conservatives saying I have to be just like them or there's something wrong with me.       I've had it with living in a country that runs secret concentration camps where people are locked up with no rights and without even being charged with anything.     I've had it with my family being harrassed by the FBI for asking questions. I've had it with my friends who get trashed because they stand up and say the truth, that the emperor has no clothes.       I've had it everyone saying we're supposed to support Bush just because he's the "president"--yeah, right, look at how these same people acted when Clinton was in office. They bashed him without end for eight years.       And I've certainly had it with everyone wanting to just pretend that problems or bad things didn't happen. Ignore it and it'll go away. How often does that actually work?     How long are we going to ignore that if all the votes had been counted, Gore would be president? How long are we going to ignore that Bush lied about the weapons in Iraq?       Where are all the people marching in the streets? Where are all the people saying we're mad as hell and we're not going to take it anymore? Where are the people saying that we want our FREE country back? Where are all the people who have a fucking spine?

       Well the convention was really good. Its hard to describe how exciting everything was. It was great just being around all those people that committed to a common goal. The atmosphere was really awesome and I hope it can carry over so we can get this idiot out of office. The only thing that made me kinda raise an eyebrow was how much it seemed they went out of the way to trash Bush. I understand not wanting to be negative but its not like bush ISN'T negative. As much as Bush has screwed up, you'd think the Dems would want to go to a lot of trouble to point that out. But it seems like they still don't have much of a spine or they're afraid to make a stand or have an opinion or something.      Holly (my sister) drafted me to be her personal assistant for the week which was cool but made for some long days. Met a lot of really great people--oh and BILL CLINTON SIGNED MY BOOK!!! We'd bought a copy of his memoirs earlier at this little bookstore in the city and then he was working the crowd at the FleetCenter and Holly and I got to say hello. It was really cool and I can see why he was such a great president. I was so starstruck though, I couldn't say much beyond "uhhh...umm, err....hi". Hehe. Holly had met him before so she didn't have that problem and she doesn't get starstruck as often as I do anyway.      So we're still in Massachusetts. We were supposed to fly back Sunday night but we pushed it back a couple of days so we could have some more time. It's been a nice little vacation. We saw a lot of Boston and some of the revolutionary war sites which was really an interesting experience. It really makes you think about what these people went through to make sure we had a free country. And they have this thing through the city called the Freedom Trail that takes you through a lot of the historic sites. Holly was really thrilled to be able to see so much, she can never get enough of historical sites (that's what her degree is in).      We took a long drive south and saw a lot of Cape Cod and Marth's Vineyard. We stayed in this really cool bed and breakfast Saturday and Sunday nights, one of those quaint old New England things like you read about in novels. And probably the most fun part was when we went on this whale watching cruise, and we saw a WHOLE LOT of them, they were everywhere, sometimes on every side of the boat. The captain called out sightings on the loudspeaker and he could barely keep up for a lot of the time, poor guy.      My dad has thought of a really cool idea, possibly setting up another blog that the whole family can post to. That could be really neat, posting stuff from campaigning and all that. I think I have a really quirky interesting family so it could work out well. I guess we'll see how it goes. A bunch of the Dem bigwigs are still talking to my dad about maybe running for Congress if the guy we have now retires. He's not sure if he wants to; I'll have to see if I can talk him into it ;-).      Hmm this is getting kinda long, so I guess that's it for now.
