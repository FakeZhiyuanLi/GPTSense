          My last post on TendOMFG regarded their idiotic attempt to diss on Halo and Halo 2. Everybody knows that Halo fans are hardcore, unlike Nintendo fans, who are all little children who whine to their parents to buy them games. Here's a look at another of their posts: Top Ten Reasons Why FPS's Can Stay Away From the Gamecube.      10. FPS games are boring. All you do is shoot stuff, there aren't any puzzles, you can't collect any items like in Mario, like new moves, fireballs, stars and other kick ass stuff.      Boring? There's nothing more exciting and tense than owning a multiplayer Halo fragfest, or storming the beaches of Normandy from the comforts of your living room. You are obviously not a man, because real men shoot stuff. It doesnt even have to be a video game. I went dove hunting a couple of months ago, and theres nothing like shooting a dove with a shotgun round when its flying away at 50 miles an hour. so shut up you freakin pansy, firing a weapon is not for immature, irresponsible queers such as yourself.      9. No FPS ever created has ever been innovative. Common, new guns, some extra jumps and bigger maps. OOohhhh, big fricken deal. FPS gamers want to see innovation, check out Mario, Metroid Prime, Zelda, THAT IS INNOVATION, that's where it's at. Word.      Not innovative huh? Lemme ask you something. since mario started jumping on people and throwing fireballs, what happened? oh yeah, NOTHING! the last time i checked i can't play metroid prime online with friends from across the country and the other 1.2 MILLION people who have a FREAKIN BRAIN! Word.      8. Most FPS games like DOOM and Gaylo, to name a couple, have generic characters and bad graphix. They put all the effort into the guns and bullets, and dont have fun environments, where's the adventure? I'll tell you where, it's in platformers, Pokemon and real games. Not casual crap like Calf-Life 2.      Bad graphics? Boring environments? Halo's graphics were the stuff when it came out about 4 years ago (and its still going strong today). And one thing you DEFINITELY don't want to diss on halo about are the environments. Space environments, lush green valleys, desert mesas, island beaches, snowy mountains, and humid swamps abound in halo. And what does mario have? a two dimensional line? Oh yeah, the monotonous spaceship setting in Metroid Prime is astonishingly dull. Yawn.      7. FPS games are always delayed too long, look at how long it took for DOOM to come out. It took 3D Realms like what, seven years? I don't know about you, but when that comes out I won't be buying. Who wants ot hear some muscel bound idiot go, "Hail to the King". I mean that's from those crappy Evil Dead movies.      Do you know why FPS titles take longer to come out? because the amazing graphics and physics engines and brilliant lighting take longer to put in than a straight line, some little turtle people and flat coins. the game designers make sure that every little detail is perfect and shiny, so when you get your brand new game, you have a great game with wonderful graphics and smooth gameflow. They just don't rush them out, because there's so much bloody gorey goodness to put in.      6. All genre's, especially fighting games, platformers and role-playing games have stories, FPS games don't. You're just dropped in there and have to go shooting everything. I remember once I was playing Half-Life and they just drop you in, it's totally stupid. They put you on this stupid underground train thing, and then you get off and kill stuff. It's pretty confusing, I couldn't get past the door down the hall after you get off the underground train thingy.      The complex storyline in halo would give you a concussion if you ever had enough incentive to get up off your fat butt and stop playing pokemon long enough to try to comprehend it. and do you know why you couldn't get past that level? BECAUSE YOU SUCK MONKEY TURDS YOU IGNORANT NOOB!! go play animal crossing or one of your other little queer arcade games.      5. FPS games don't sell well EVER. The best FPS game, I use that term losely of course, was Daikatana, and it only sold like 10,000 copies. Ed Boon and John Tobias should be ashamed of themselves for making a FPS game. Specially after MK.      Halo is nearing its 5 millionth unit sold, and its been out for what, 4 years? i've never even heard of gaykatana before, or your queer little halo wannabe geist. i get the feeling somebody is afraid of the tru7h.      4. There have only been a couple good FPS games ever, like Perfect Dark. Since the new games don't use the N64 Memory Expansion Pack like they could, that means that new FPS games could never be as good. It was the pak that made them rock hard, long, smooth and rock hard! YEAH, score another one for both hating on FPS games, and Nintendo's kick ass IP Perfect Dark!      The only good FPS games are on consoles that have far superior memory cards and actual built in hard drives. Your wimpy GayCube wouldn't have the raw proccessing power that is required for today's top notch FPS's.      3. FPS games don't offer the varities of gameplay that other genres do. Take the great Metroid series for example, it's not a fps, and it has so much variety. Rolling into a ball and blowing stuff up, shooting aliens with multiple types of weapons, it's what gaming is all about. Games that are FPS don't offer that kind of fun, they just have players doint mental stuff like blowing things in to pieces, shooting bad guys with lots of weapons, that kind of stuff.      FPS's have so much more variety than your weasly little nintendo games. i know in halo and a bunch of other FPS's that you are constantly switching weapons to match your enemies, and jumping in and out of a wide variety of vehicles to kick the damage dishing up another notch.      2. Most FPS games make people violent. DOOM, Half Life, Halo, Call Of Duty, Daikatana, they all make killers. Kids learn how to aim guns and kill people. It's in the news all the time, how players use their mouses and keyboards to laern how to fire guns and murder :      Violent? thats a little bit of an overstatement. If i play halo for about an hour each day usually it relieves a whole lot of stress for me, rather than building up hatred inside of me. Lemme tell you something, i'll go out and shoot someone when i see a little girl running down the street and jumping on peoples heads to see if coins pop out of their butt.      (*DRUM ROLL!!*1. FPS games are on Xbox all the time. That's right, as if it wasn't clear enough, stuff like Gaylo, DOOM, Chronicles Of Rizzik, all boring, all on the Xbomb. Why would GameCube want that kind of trash. All the games sell bad.      The only reason that the best FPS's are on the xbox is that the xbox has the best graphics and the smoothest framerates to play top notch FPS's. i think someones a little mad that they don't have an xbox. and halo is still a top seller 4 years after it came out.    These people have absolutely no idea what they're talking about. Spread the word about their stupidity. Maybe they'll shut up. Maybe.

          This post is to inform the public not to go to  urlLink www.tendomfg.blogspot.com  unless they enjoy laughing at gay fanboys. These guys just don't know when to quit. They worship Nintendo like it's God or something, and then they bash on other video game companies like they are the spawn of Satan. They are biased to the point of blindly supporting Nintendo when it is obviously on its last legs.  The Nintendo ship is going down, and the main contributors  of TendOMFG (MariOMFG, Specialist, Nintaldo) are the stubborn captains that go down with the ship. When Nintendo finally crashes, these three will be the laughingstock of the gaming world.      The first case of their bias and unbelievable stupidity shows in their article on why Geist is better than Halo. I personally had never heard of Geist until I saw the link to their article at HBO. Their nerve to diss on one of the greatest and most innovative games in gaming history baffles me. Here is their article with my responses.      10. Bungie made Marathon, which is dumb   Marathon was actually a great game. If it wasn't, they wouldn't have made sequels. And they never specified how Marathon was dumb. This is what i like to call bias.      9. Master Chief is a boring character that never talks   The Master Chief is the last of his kind, a genetically enhanced super soldier from a top secret military project, who is forced to singlehandedly destroy the Halo 04 installation, which includes an entire Covenant armada, and the Flood. Yep, sounds boring to me. Not. He actually has a lot of dialog in the game.      8. Halo 2 has not ghosts   Not literal ghosts, but Halo 2 will have Covenant hovercraft, which are called Ghosts. These Ghosts were also in Halo CE. So bad grammar and even worse syntax aside, Halo 2  will  have ghosts.      7. Geist lets players control other bodies   Because they didn't take the time to develop a single character. Being able to control other bodies gets confusing. And what good would that do? I mean, in GTA you can steal people's cars. Thats cool. Controlling other bodies is satanic. And so are the queers that contribute to TendOMFG.      6. Geist is made by the same developers that made Mary Kate & Ashlee: Magical Mystery Mall   Now lets read through this one word at a time. Geist. Same Developers as MARY KATE AND ASHLEE. MAGICAL MYSTERY MALL. Think about it. These people say that they are guys. I don't know what they're trying to say here. My guess is either one of two things:1. Since the same developers made Magical Mystery Mall, Geist is sure to be a good game. Anyone who makes a Mary Kate and Ashlee game should be taken outside and shot. Or: 2. Since the same game developers made Magical Mystery Mall, Geist is sure to be a very, very bad game.  I mean seriously, Mary Kate and Ashlee. Think about it.     And besides, the MC is a better role model for kids. He doesn't use profanity, and he fights against satanic religious fanatics. The Olsen twins are addicted to crack. And they have an eating disorder. Now  that's  what i want to be when i grow up. (hey, hey, smell that? its called SARCASM. get used to it. punk.)      5. Halo 2 is GAY   I was not aware that any game had the ability to have a sexual preference for video games of the same gender. Therefore, this comment is null. I think what the author was trying to say was: Halo 2 is STUPID. No, you sir, are stupid. Stupid for dissing on Halo, stupid for buying a Gamecube, stupid for playing MARY KATE AND ASHLEE GAMES, AND STUPID FOR MAKING THE FREAKIN SITE IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!! their stupidity amazes me to no end.         4. Geist is a more pure first person game. Halo 2 has stupid stuff like two guns controllings and vehicles. Is it a fps or a stupid racing game? Geist is pure 100% shooter!   Halo is a more pure fps game. Geist has stupid stuff like controlling other bodies. Is it a shooter, or a FREAKING SEANCE?!?! Halo is pure 100% shooter. punk.      3. Geist looks better than Halo 2   If you like 8-bit games, yeah, Geist looks good. But in comparison to Halo 2, Geist is a finger painting, whereas Halo 2 is a da Vinci. Here are some pics to prove this statement wrong:      Geist:  urlLink http://www.gamer-talk.net/screenshots205.html    Halo 2:  urlLink http://www.bungie.net/Games/Halo2/gallery.aspx?gallery=Screenshots&amp;page=1    Halo 2 is obviously a better looking game than Geist.      2. Geist doesn't have stupid online play. Online play is just a fad, Nintendo said so themselves. I mean who wants to play online like some PC nerd? I know I don't. Plus Xbox Live has lots of lag. My friend's friend told me that his Xbox caught on fire once.   Nyah Nyah, Nintendo this, Nintendo that BLAHDYBLAHDY-FREAKIN-BLAH!!!! There are over 1.2 million subscriptions to Xbox Live, which is expected to double when Halo 2 releases (i know i'm gettin live, and halo 2). Also, there are countless other games that incorporate online play. Consider the marvelous MechWarrior series. You can play other people online via NetMech. Definitely cool. It takes skill to maneuver a BattleMech with a keyboard and a mouse. Then you have to shoot. which adds a whole new perspective to playing. Then there is Final Fantasy. The latest installment in the FF series is basically an online game. The graphics are killer, and there are countless other people online to interact with. Online playing is    not    an online fad. It has revolutionized the way we play video games.      1. Geist sounds cooler than Halo!   Considering that i don't know how to pronounce Geist, i would still think that Halo sounds cooler. Is it pronounced like jeest? or maybe geest? or jist? or gayst? jayst? I think its pronounced like G*eye*st. or something like that. Halo is simple, and catchy. Therefore it beats Geist. End of discussion punk.
