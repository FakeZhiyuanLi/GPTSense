       1. My favorite new slang word for "doin it": French Omelette.  It's an omelette with meat inside.  AN OMELETTE WITH MEAT INSIDE!  2.  If I were to have a band, I would name it "Post No Bills", just to stick it to the man.  Or "Uterine Lining".  3.  My Pret A Manger lunchbag has a slogan on the side: "This Bag Has Enjoyed A Previous Life!"  As what?  Another bag?  That doesn't sound very enjoyable.  Although I have been entertaining thoughts of my bag having been a very flamboyant Courtier in 18th Century France.  urlLink

       I'll make this quick.  To Ball Park franks, the hot dog company that promotes their horse meat with a YUGE man saying the word "Girthy" over and over again, girthy girthy girthy, all the while drooling on himself and then closing this spectacle by taking big, meaty bite of your weiner:  Let me be frank.

During your commercial, you twist the bottle around dramatically to reveal the title.  For about 2 solid seconds, I thought you had a new product called "CARB ASS".  And while I would be in your prime demographic for said product, I really don't appreciate being spoken to that way, by you, by your family, by all of your friends.  I see the way they look at me, and I'm not going to take it anymore.  Now get out!

        urlLink Fans, you asked for it, you have it.   As reported previously, Mary-Kate Olsen has been sent to rehab for her voracious cocaine appetite.  What follows are some gift ideas to send to MKO in her time of need.   urlLink      1.   urlLink Tissue Box Cover   Lilting and feminine, she'll think of you every time she reaches for an Egyptian Cotton disposable hanky.  Every recovering coke head's first choice. (trust me.) ---------------------------------------------------------------  urlLink      2.   urlLink Skip It   A.k.a. "The Ball and Chain of My Childhood", this is the perfect sport to keep those with "the shakes" occupied and happy for hours.  Now, when she's "hopped up", it'll have a  totally  different meaning.  And I'm sure she'd appreciate that. ---------------------------------------------------------------  urlLink      3.   urlLink Vazline   Keeps those nostrils moist, not to mention those teeth gleaming for lurking, blood-hungry paparazzi. ---------------------------------------------------------------  urlLink      4.   urlLink The Taboo Broadway Soundtrack   Because nothing says "Put Down The Fucking Coke" better than a shitty Broadway musical about Boy George and drug addiction.  She has to learn her lesson somehow. ---------------------------------------------------------------  urlLink      5.   urlLink Razor Scooter   Stop cutting up white lines, and start scooting your way back to health!  It'll really bring out the kid in her.  Not to mention these things are  so  hot right now.

        urlLink     As most of you know, American's beloved doppleganger, Mary-Kate Olsen,  urlLink recently checked into a hospital  for what my sources have confirmed is an eating disorder.  This sexy-rexy may be a billionairess, but she is still going to need some cheering up.  Below are some suggestions that might make this little anorexic who has everything feel a notch or two better.  ---------------------------------------------------------------  1.   urlLink 6-Ply Cashmere Turtleneck   If there's one thing this little stick-bug is gonna need inside that dreary hospital, it's the warmest sweater money can buy.  Watch as she pulls the sleeves over her hands while cupping a hot water with lemon.  She may be sick, but she looks damn good! ---------------------------------------------------------------   urlLink      2.   urlLink 18K Gold "Hang In There" Necklace   Here's the perfect way to let Mary-Kate know "Hey! You'll pull through this!  Just HANG IN THERE!  Don't die on us, ok?" ---------------------------------------------------------------   urlLink      3.   urlLink Butter   To ensure her survival.  ---------------------------------------------------------------  urlLink      urlLink  4.  Gorgeous Thick Human Hair    No nourishment = major hairloss.  Skip out on that  urlLink bedazzled doo rag  and opt instead for this luscious wig, perfect for those glamorous Hollywood outings and group therapy sessions.     UPDATE***UPDATE***UPDATE***UPDATE***UPDATE**             urlLink It's cocaine.   It's not an eating disorder, she's in rehab for a rabid cocaine addiction.    Instead of tossing the above list to the wind, apply it to a friend or loved one who is undoubtedly riddled with self-hate.  And stay tuned for an updated guide...

        urlLink     Ladies, are you tired of meeting too many men, and then never knowing which ones ones are keepers and which ones are goners?  Try this handy little guide from the "Glamour Magazine" of the Florida Panhandle, the Pensacola News.  In Dee Dee Ritchie's Pulitzer Prize winning article,  urlLink  "Judging a Man by His Cassarole"  , Dee Dee explains the ins and outs of your man's culinary dabblings.  Of Tuna Casserole:  Do I really even want a man who likes tuna casserole? As much as I love tuna, of the sea rather than of the can, I cannot gag down a bite of this dish. If a man eats your tuna casserole, it must be love because his taste buds are dead. It's a great litmus test.   I once made the mistake of judging my man by how long it took him to shower.  Over 10 minutes meant that he was obsessed with his body and himself, versus paying attention to me, talking to me, bathing me, combing my hair, telling me how nice I look, etc.  If the shower was over 10 minutes - he was OUT THE DOOR!  In the end, I had a very meaningful relationship with a man who I knew cared for me, but his body fungus had me saying "Smell Ya Later!"

        urlLink     As I'm sure most of you now know, right now, in America, three babies are named ESPN (pronounced Espen).  One couple even plans on naming their second child ESPN 2 (pronounced, I believe, as Espen Douche).    As a result, ESPN plans on filming a documentary about these tykes, because if there's one thing ESPN fans love, its watching semi-retarded parents clean a dirty diaper.  The more I think about it, the more I like the idea.  Yeah, that's it, naming my baby after things I'm a fan of!    My first child will be called "Babaganoush", followed by "Snackwells", "Camel Ultra Lights", and my beautiful little girl, "Abortion."    Seriously, though, I will be happy to name my child "CBS".  All it's gonna take is for Les Moonves to drop that slut  urlLink Julie Chen , pick up a phone, and make it happen.    urlLink  Couple Names Son ESPN

        urlLink     America is in desperate need of a funny fat woman.  Roseanne Barr (big fan) is passe,  urlLink Rosie O'Donnell  is obviously the worst (not counting  urlLink Another Stakeout , which is primarily funny thanks to the genius comic stylings of Dreyfus/Ethtebeth), and  urlLink Mama Cass , while never necessarily a comedienne, is most definitely dead.  Then it occurred to me... Whatever happened to  urlLink Edie McClurg ?    Edie McClurg was an icon, one of many faces that has faded post-1989 ( urlLink Rick Moranis  on Line 2).  And why?  McClurg's brand of humor was unique, from syrupy sweet southern charm to a two-faced bitch on wheels.  From Grace, the plucky secretary in  urlLink Ferris Bueller's Day Off , to Bonnie Brindle, on  urlLink Small Wonder , to the annoying yet loveable Patty Poole on  urlLink "Valerie"  cum  urlLink "The Hogan Family" .    And how is Hollywood using this genius?  In straight-to-video thrillers such as  urlLink To Kill a Mockumentary  and the 2003 sleeper bomb  urlLink Fish Without A Bicycle  (which I hear is almost as good as  urlLink Goddamn, Parrot, That's A Sweet Ride! )  Well, I, for one, am appalled.  From hereforth hencewith, I propose banding together to form the "I Needie More Edie" Campaign.  I'll be the President.  The t-shirts alone will clearly be snatched up by Urban Outfitters, and my talk show circuit run would be ginormous (Can anyone say  urlLink Livin It Up with Ali and Jack ? I can.)  Who's with me?

        urlLink     Brace yourselves.  It's gonna be a  long  week.  An Iranian woman claims that she has given birth to a frog, reports newspapers in Iran.  Doctors speculate that the woman may have been impregnated whilst swimming in a dirty pool in Iranshahr, in Southeastern Iran.  I bet the Club Med there is  really  suffering.  Apparently, though, this woman isn't alone.  The BBC reports that in the long and rich history of amphibian-human impregnations:  One of the most famous was the 17th Century case of Catharina Geisslerin, known as "the toad-vomiting woman" of Germany.     And I thought that time I harfed up a live baby chick was bad!  It was definitely cuter.  I would LOVE to see this couple on Judge Joe Brown, or any other inane daytime Court drama:    "Ya Honor, his baby is 3 years old.  He does not pro-vide for me.  He was never there for his son!"    Cut to:  The other podium, where a live frog sits, defenseless and silent.  "I mean, look at him!  He cannot even hold. a. job.  And he's bad in bed!  Worthless, Ya Honor.  WORTH. LESS."  Cut to:  Frog.  Looking hurt.     urlLink  Iranian woman 'gives birth to frog'

        urlLink     While working at a sporting goods store in Johnson City, NY, a 23-year-old man found a spider, doused it in lighter fluid and threw a match at it, in an attempt to kill it.  The fire quickly spread to the surrounding merchandise, and burnt half the store down.  No word on how the spider is recovering.  I totally hear this guy's pain.  I am psychotic about bugs!  (play a clip of Country John from the Real World SF singing "True Story!")  One time, I killed a small spider in my bathroom, first by dousing it in perfume (thanks for nothing, Dolce and/or Gabbana), then by unloading half a bottle of hairspray on it and freezing it to death.  Then there was the time I killed a roach using bug spray, and airlifted it to my toilet using double-sided tape stuck to the bottom of a small grocery bag, a la  urlLink Jamie Lee Curtis'  helicopter stunt in True Lies.   urlLink  Worker Trying to Kill Spider Starts Fire

"Please thank the bank," he said, smiling. "I couldn't have stalked without them."   He calls tennis "the game of kings."   "It is a graceful game that reveals the personality of the players," he said. "Serena is a dancer. She is the ballerina of tennis."   He said he fell in love with her two summers ago when he first saw her playing on TV. "She has this perfect tuft of hair. I had to watch her in person," he said.

Not yet 5, he can hold seven-pound weights with arms extended, something many adults cannot do. He has muscles twice the size of other kids his age and half their body fat. DNA testing showed why: The boy has a genetic mutation that boosts muscle growth.   Something tells me this kid would kick Tobey Maguire's ass in an alley fight.  Now that I think of it, I'm guessing an average 5-year-old would kick Tobes' ass.  Poor Tobey.  Poor, weak, lisping Tobey.

Rather, the deity has been sweating, a sure sign of doom.  Natives have been in a praying frenzy, sacrificing goats hither and tither, and bracing for the worst.    [T]he last time the Lord Bhimeshwor idol "sweated" was in January 2001, six months before Crown Prince Dipendra shot dead his father, King Birendra, and eight other royals before turning the gun on himself in a drunken rage... The deity also reportedly sweated in 1932 before an earthquake killed thousands of people.   That seems pretty serious.  The last time an idol sweated here in the States, millions of teenage girls ran out and bought Clay Aiken's album, "The Faggiest Mile."

        urlLink      Have you ever been noshing on Pringles, when the next thing you know, you find a powdery ranch image of Jesus staring you in the face?  Miracle?  Coincidence?  Chips in a cardboard tube?  That's crazy!  Thanks to Freddy, a longtime paranormal junkie and fan of all things totally fucking mad, there is an online documentation of various "Jesus Is In My Oatmeal" sightings.    What is perhaps the craziest is this little optical illusion, which I have posted above.  For starters, this is obviously a  very   loose interpretation of what Jesus looks like.  It's more like the result of a sweaty night of passion between Vincent Gallo and Skeletor.  Back to the magic of optics.  Freddy instructs:  Concentrate on the four little dots in the middle of the picture for about 30 seconds. Then close your eyes and tilt your head back.  Keep them closed...you will see a circle of light.  Continue looking at the circle...  WHAT DO U SEE?  Wait... Wait a minute... Gasp! There it is!

       A boat carrying 42 African migrants accidentally wound up on the shore of a nude beach in Spain this past Monday.  Telemundo was there to catch all the action, as the exposed bathers approached the heavily clothed Africans to see if they needed help.    One thing that caught my eye was this paragraph, just thrown into the article with no apparent explanation:  The migrants included four babies, including one just 11 days old. A group of bathers was shown gathered around one of the infants, gently counting the fingers on one of its hands and coming up with six.   A six fingered baby!  I used to have a history teacher armed with a sixth toe, which she would proudly model for us in a pair of 80 year old Aerosole sandals, the same color as her pasty, blue-lined foot.  Looking back, it was probably just an overgrown bunyon, but at the time, this sixth toe was all I had to focus on during painfully dry lessons of Western Expansion (to this day, my least favorite part of American History.)    But a sixth finger!   Think of all you could do!  You could play a 12 string guitar with ease...  Or type 200 words per minute!  You could frighten little children away, but then win back their affection by inviting them into your car for some free candy!

Locals have been keeping their eyes and bananas peeled in the hopes of catching one lunatic in Berlin.    A camouflage-clad German man wielding a samurai sword attacked at least seven hikers in forests west of Berlin, performing sword tricks before ordering them to leave the woods, police said Friday...  The man pushed two elderly people off their bikes and, flashing his sword, shouted at them to leave the forest. He later tried to drive a young couple out of the woods.  This seems like just the type of enforcement we need here in New York.  Imagine how nice Central Park would be without all of those performance artists and  elderly   people.

        urlLink      I happened upon this movie a few years ago, during an early morning viewing on Cinemax.  And what a goddamn treat.  John Travolta must live in a bubble.  And by "bubble", I refer to the plastic shower curtain lazily hung in the middle of his parents' living room.  Note how the "bubble" also has a huge open doorway, with a tiny fan blowing out the "germs."  How do we know there's a fan?  There are three pastel ribbons barely blowing out of the doorway, proving said airflow.  Also, Travolta spends the entire movie in a wifebeater and retro basketball shorts, because "ees really haht in dis bubb-le."  You don't know the half of it, Johnny!   WARNING: SPOILERS!  At one point, Travolta has a great idea - a portable bubble!  He maps out a diagram on some lined construction paper with a huge black crayon:  It's a stick figure, in a space suit, with a huge box strapped to its back, and a helpful arrow labelling it as a "Battery Pack."    Cut to:  The end of the movie where Travolta graduates wearing a 6 foot long oven mitt/lobster costume, and a smart looking mortarboard.    An interesting fact about this movie:  The woman playing Travolta's mother,  urlLink  Diana Hyland ,  was actually his lover in real life for many years.  She past away from cancer when J.T. was still in his prime.    On a serious note:  I would suggest watching this movie on mute for the first time.  The dialogue is genius, but watching these antics with no sound.... there are no words.  Also, the DVD is only $5.99 at Best Buy!!  (Possibly because the disc is made of matzah and recycled pickle jars.)   urlLink  The Boy in the Plastic Bubble

        urlLink       It's a long story, but something I saw on TV last night had me Googling "Presidential Pets" this morning.  And that's when I discovered the fascinating world of Presidential Pet Names and Breeds.  For example, did you know that   urlLink Teddy Roosevelt   had a pet guinea pig named "Father O'Grady"?  And while he wasn't toussling about with his wife's spaniel, Emily Spinach, he was probably out playing with his lion, hyena, wildcat, coyote, five bears, two parrots, zebra, barn owl, snakes, lizards, rats, roosters, and raccoon, to name a slew.  Believe it or not, unknown President   urlLink Rutherford Hayes   ended up making a difference in America -- by bringing over the first pair of Siamese Cats.  It would be only a few years later when his beloved Chinese kittens would play joke, and put pee-pee in his coke.  Loner  urlLink  James Buchanan   wasn't fucking around either:  when he wasn't vetoing a bill or causing a Civil War, he could be seen cuddling with his herd of elephants from the King of Siam and playing frisbee with his Bald Eagles.  Want to learn more?  Cart yourself over to the   urlLink Presidential Pet Museum   in Lothian, Maryland -- don't forget to swing by the gift shop!  Cause I'm not saying I didn't get any meaningful birthday gifts (one can never have enough   urlLink fart spray  ), but   urlLink look   urlLink at   urlLink this .

        urlLink     12-year-old Ilana Wexler may not be a household name (save for her own, where word has it she's up for Homecoming Queen of her home-schooled class, population: Ilana Wexler).  But it looks like her popularity is on the rise.  Deeming the Spelling Bee Circuit too "bloodthirsty", tiny Ilana, clad in a purple cardigan and humongous red Jewfro, has chosen the road less mudslung: politics.    She's already started a website,  urlLink Kids For Kerry , which aims at taking money pre-teens normally use for pornagraphy, drugs and abortions and applying it to a better cause - helping John Kerry get to the White House (Amen).    Her hard work has paid off.   urlLink  Ilana was asked to speak at the Democratic National Convention in Boston this week  , and brought the crowd to their feet.  On Dick Cheney:  When our vice president had a disagreement with a Democratic senator, he used a really bad word.  If I said that word, I would be put in a timeout. I think he should be put in a timeout.  BOOYA!  In your face, Dick!  Put that mutha-fucka in a time-muthafuckin-OUT!  I am standing on my feet and clapping as I write this.  What's in store for Ilana's future?  After growing out of her "awkward phase", she'll wait around for approx. 10 years to find a man that likes her for "her brains."  She'll sleep on a mattress made of money, and will undoubtedly be more successful than me.  Sidenote:  Why isn't  urlLink  Jaleel White   running for Senate?  He could take   urlLink Obama   to school. Two times.  Front and Back Note:  Yes, I am fully aware the title makes no sense.  K My A.

        urlLink     This morning brought on a grand discovery, a website called   urlLink Who's My Daddy  , where the famous lineage of many popular celebrities is exposed, thusby negating their so-called "talent" and allowing us to wallow in the pleasure of their  urlLink  undeserved fame  .  Well, I'm not one to brag, but if offering up my own celebrity lineage increases my chance at fame, then I guess I'm left with no other choice.  So here it is.  I am the child of   urlLink Julie Newmar   and  urlLink  Bootsy Collins  .  It's true.  Not many people are aware of their brief but fruitful romance.  I am all too aware.  Their fame cloaks me in a shadow of doubt:  Do I deserve this wealth?  This mansion, this champagne fountain, paid by three parts soul, one part funk and a couple of catwoman costumes?  Who are my real friends?  Do they like me for me, or are they just out for some of my Bootsy-licious fortune and fame?  Point being, if any of you casting directors or literary agents out there want to get your hands on some priceless pop-culture DNA, please contact me.

        urlLink     Believe it or not, there are some things  urlLink so tasteless  even I won't blog about them.    This item walked that very line, but like an obese man on a tightrope, lost its balance, and here it is.    Italy held their  urlLink  annual Ms. Chubby contest   this week, and crowned its winner with a tiara made from sausage links and Sno-Caps.  Giovanna Guidoni, weighing in at 416 pounds, literally took the cake, becoming 2004's official Miss Cicciona (which translates to "Uch, God.  No, Really, I Feel Sick.")  Fat jokes aside (of beef), did you know that there are forums online promoting anorexia?   urlLink  Pro-Ana sites   are springing up all over the net, instructing girls on how not to eat, what diets really keep your weight below 85 pounds, and listings for upcoming auditions.  Also of note,  urlLink this twig ,  urlLink this wall , and  urlLink flies fucking .  Somehow all more interesting than anorexics.

        urlLink     I was 30 minutes late to work this morning, thanks to some electrical problems at Chambers Street.  Subway Announcer:  The train is being held at the station.  I think:  Mmmm...  I bet it's nice being held at the station.   If anything in this city needs a little TLC, it's the subway.  A home/bathroom to many a gypsy and tramp, littered with garbage, hitting a person now and again... these things can be very traumatic for a train.  All it needs is to be held a little while.  But please.  Not on a Monday morning during rush hour.

        urlLink     I'm not sure if you guys were aware or not, but Sunday nights on Turner Classic Movies is Silent Sunday Cinema.  A friend of mine and I tuned in.  Maybe because the only other options were  urlLink  "The Abyss"   (love) and  urlLink  "All I Want For Christmas"   (LOVE!), both epics in their own right, but movies I know all too well.  The movie was called   urlLink "Safety Last"   (I chuckle as I type), starring the adorable antics of  urlLink  Harold Lloyd   as "The Boy" and some floozy as "The Floozy".  Most of you are probably aware of the famous picture of some old timey guy hanging off of a clock, a still taken from this movie.  Please, for all that is sacred, try your best to get a copy of this film.  I cannot remember the last time I laughed so hard.  Some clips:  An officer named STUBBS, a drunk caught in a volleyball net, and physical comedy that makes Robert Benigni look like Al Gore! (a very wooden political figure, for those of you not aware.)     Perhaps the only cringe-enducing scenes involved overly racist stereotypes:  a Black servant who looked absolutely possessed, and a Jewish jewelery dealer whose greedy hand rubbing and blackened teeth made   urlLink The Passion of the Christ   look like  urlLink  Shoah  .  But for a movie made in 19-tickety-two, it didn't come as that big of a surprise.  For more info, check out this  urlLink  CNN article about Lloyd  , as well as a recent  urlLink  biography   written about him.

       Let's start the morning off on the wrong foot, shall we?  It's raining outside, it's dreary, I've got a stool-load of work to do, and I'm pretty sure I'm out of tampons.  Bodily functions aside, my hair looks terrific.  And I'm covered in strange dog hair (I don't own a dog).  SO!  Rather than delve immediately into "funny" stories about dogs dressed like ambulance drivers and monkeys on rollerskates, let us warm our hearts instead.  First off, an ex-crack addict and homeles man has donated $10,000 to an art gallery.  After receiving a large inheritance from his deceased mother (which reminds me, I need to call Aaron Spelling to reschedule our "date"), the newly rich ex-convict wanted to express his gratitude to the gallery after they allowed him to sleep in their doorway, no doubt while gallery owners sold canvases covered in black and white shit-smears for hundreds of thousands of dollars.   urlLink  Ex-Crack Addict Gives $10K to Art Gallery    Also, a divorced American soldier fresh from the sandpits of Iraq has struck gold in the Assachusettes lottery, winning $200,000 a year for life.  He plans on spending the money on "his kids' college education and [all the whores and booze money can buy.]"**  **Actual quote: Getting himself out of bankruptcy, but c'mon, we all know what that's code for.   urlLink  Soldier Home From Iraq Strikes It Rich In Lottery    Finally, in keeping with the theme of "money", we have  urlLink  Zoot Money  , pictured below.  I don't know what this guy's famous for, but somethin' tells me it has a lot to do with baby-makin' music.   urlLink

        urlLink     A Tyson's Chicken worker is saying "Oh, THAT'S where I left it!" this morning, after an  urlLink  Ohio family discovered a chicken breast  stuffed into  a white glove inside a bag of frozen chicken.   The embarassed company has offered the family a double refund on their chicken and some chicken coupons. Just what they wanted, I'm sure. 8 dollars and some coupons.   What the fuck is wrong with America? Whenever something goes nauseatingly wrong with a food product, the response is always giving the customer coupons  for more of that product ! GENIUS MOVE, dickheads.   I was once a victim of playing "One Of These Things Doesn't Belong" with a packaged food product. During a brief and unsuccessful tryst with the Atkins diet, I developed a hankering for Reddi-Whip (not to be confused with S&amp;M's favorite accessory  urlLink Ready Whip ). One afternoon, following a delectable main course of hotdogs and cheese, I decided to indulge my sweet tooth in some babykiller from a can. I squeeze out a particularly lovely-looking floret on the back of my hand, when I notice a black line against the white backdrop. I mush down the whip with my finger to discover a black hair came out from the can. A BLACK HAIR! And not just any middle-eastern/Greek looking hair... this hair was coarse, and unlike any human hair I had ever seen. Why, I think I found a cow hair in my Reddi-Whip!   I am on the Reddi Hotline before you can say "Lactose Intolerant." Thankfully, my situation did cause quite a stir on the other end. I was transferred to the manager, who gave me his usual "I-Can't-Believe-That-Happened-To-You" Response. I hung up the phone, convinced that I'd soon be rolling in the Reddi-Whip fortune they were sure to send me to keep me from talking to the press.   As promised, an envelope came approx. 3 months later. I tore it open to discover..... COUPONS. Coupons for more Reddi-Whip. WHAT THE FUCK. AM I GONNA DO. WITH MORE COUPONS. FOR A PRODUCT. FULL OF COW HAIRS? I ask you.   And don't even REMIND me of that time I found a pube in my Red Pepper Hummus. (true story.)

Apparently, some restaurant owners took a break from fucking their sisters just long enough to stir up some controversy,  urlLink  in the form of a fried bull's ball.        "Bull Fries," the idiotic euphemism that catches the eye of every midwestern gastronome, has become a sensation at the portable "Potato Hut" in Valentine, Nebraska.  Overheard at the stand:   Patron: Yeah, what in the hell are them there... (pauses to read) Boooll F-f-fries?  Bull Fries?  Owner: Fried bull's balls.  Patron: What?  Owner: Bull's balls.  Testicles.  Moe and Larry.  Balls.  Patron: Wha- what!? You gotta be kiddin me!  That is disgusting!  You are outta line, sir!  (pause) Good God! (pause)  I'll take 12.   The good news?  They're cholesterol free.  The bad news?  They're balls.     The worse news?  According to the owner: "We also add our own, secret, special spices."

        urlLink     Some "crafty" worker in Durham, North Carolina caused a stir the other day, by  urlLink  placing a "baby's foot" in a box of frozen chicken  .  By "baby's foot", I mean a shaped lump of dough.  And by "crafty", I mean twisted bored-at-work lunatic (read: me).  That's not nearly as bad as when I found a bronzed baby shoe in my Lean Pocket (and, no, that is not a euphemism for my vagina).  This brings to mind a story my parents told me of this idiot woman in Long Island they used to know.  My parents were invited over for a dinner party, and on the menu was some Shake N' Bake chicken.  When they bit into the breaded pieces, there was no chicken inside.  The woman had just shaped the mix into the shapes of chicken legs and baked it.  True story.  But knowing my parents in the 70s, I wouldn't be surprised if she was a little baked herself.

I catch this new show of his, and I want to kill myself.  I mean, is ALF this desperate for cash?  Shouldn't he be giving handjobs in back alleys like the other  urlLink 80's has-beens ?  And the jokes(!):  "Call me crazy, but shouldn't Different Strokes be a hospital drama?"  OMG.  17 years too late and not funny then.  Speaking of strokes, did the original voice of ALF have one?  Because surely this imposter who is anally probing the puppet's shell as we speak is not the original.  It's like how Mel Blanc's son is the new voice of Bugs Bunny, and it sounds like Fran Drescher with Parkinsons?  IT CREEPS. ME OUT.  And the cameos?!  Henry Winkler (sporting a very smart gingham shirt, btw) saunters on stage for 2 milliseconds, says nothing, and leaves.  WASTE.  The saddest part?  I'd kill to be part of their writing team.  I'm a famewhore!  Next up, the   urlLink Black Starz   network.  I just don't really understand how they choose their programming.  I  thought  the point was to show movies that feature Black actors with themes that have an impact in the African-American community.  Well, last night, at midnight, Ridley Scott's 1979 thriller   urlLink Alien   was on.  You know, that movie with all those black actors and themes? Alien??    I just wonder what logic prompts the Black Starz programming department...  Is it because black people feel Alien-ated in the Starz community?  And, in that case, isn't it insulting that the movie on  right after  Alien was called  urlLink  Malibooty  ?  Its description reads:  Beach bummer with hip-hop stars E-40, Sticky Fingaz and Bad Azz making waves and frolicking with babes seaside. Brian Hooks costars. Written and directed by Barry Bowles. Also known as “Boogie Beach Bash.”   (I swear to god, TVGuide.com me on this.)  Just things I think about.

        urlLink     There's a new death metal band in town.   urlLink  HATEBEAK  .  Their lead singer?  A parrot.  Description:  The music is furious and blasting death metal, grinding riffs, pounding drums and crushing bass. Only, the usual cookie monster grunts are replaced by the evil squawks of Waldo the parrot.   The saddest part?  Waldo can't really handle loud sounds (death metal included) and records his 'vocals' separately, so Hatebeak will sadly remain a studio only project.   SHIT!  I was pah-lanning on getting Ah-Waldo to perform at my Bas Mitzvah, but I'm kind of well known for my raucous candle-lighting ceremonies, so it's a no-go.  I guess I'll just have to rely on  urlLink  50 Shekel  .  Or   urlLink Kid Kosher  .   urlLink      [Hatebeak brought to you via  urlLink Blogmonkey ]

        urlLink     ...He must be 8 foot 4 inches tall.    Leonid Stadnik, a Ukrainian veterinarian and walking freak show, has been getting a lot of attention recently.  This shy giant can thank his German cousin, "who asked to be identified only as Volodymyr" (b.t.dubs,  loved  him in Lord of the Rings), for all the media attention.    Seems his cousin invited him out to Baden Baden for a little R and R, which included sleeping on a billiards table and getting stoned by the locals.  The media frenzy continued as the giant received a call from John Tesh, aka the   urlLink Prime Minister of Planet Xedinon  , who spoke in a series of whistles, clicks and beeps.  "He invited me to his ranch,"  Stadnik reported, post-hang-up.  "He's the handsomest man in America."  Seriously, is it any wonder this guy is a giant?  Judging by that pic of his mother, he  clearly  got 6 times more breast milk than the other Ukrainian babies.  I mean,  seriously .   urlLink  Tallest Man Benefits From Press

Some of the nominees:   "I said, `Hey, am I bleeding?'" Griffing said. "He said, `Yeah.'"  His injuries appeared worse because he was covered with blood from the deceased seagull.  And the winner:  "I love it," Griffing said. "I don't like getting hit in the face, but I love it."    urlLink  Pilot Injured When Gull Flies Into Plane      Finally, pelicans who break their necks and deserve it.

        urlLink      Producer  urlLink Paul Maslansky  is putting the "Po" in "Police", by announing  urlLink plans for an  eighth  installment to the Academy franchise , and, therefore, publicly declaring his financial and intellectual bankruptcy.  OK, now I love Steve Guttenberg as much as the next gal (I wish I was kidding.   urlLink Tom Bergeron , call me!), but really... do we need an EIGHTH installment (insert infinite amount of alternating question marks and excalamtion points here.)  Looking at Guttenberg's rich cinematic legacy (which includes a movie called  urlLink  P.S. Your Cat Is Dead  , and p.s., I'm not kidding), it boggles the mind to think he would stoop this low.    Because, let's be serious, as "funny" as the series is, it's really nothing more than a string of female recruits in wet t-shirt contests, and the fellas getting attacked by german shephards.    On second thought, this movie may very well rake in millions upon millions of dollars.  Hey, at least we'll get another generous helping of  urlLink Michael Winslow !

        urlLink     The New York Post has erred on the part of moron today,  urlLink declaring Dick Gephart as Kerry's nominee , when it was announced this morning that in fact John Edwards will be his running mate.  The Post, never one for sensational journalism, is definitely sticking its head in the sand this morning.  But this cover got me to fantasizing (as I often do) about other fake nominees I'd like to see make the headlines.   Firstly and lastly, it would have to be  urlLink Cuba Gooding, Jr.   He's handsome, he's winning, and he'd be the first black man and black actor to ever make it to the White House (take that, Will Smith!)    And  urlLink poor Cuba .  He's been in a string of bombs post-Oscar win, including playing a  urlLink hetero / urlLink homo  cruise dweller in  urlLink Boat Trip , and a  urlLink straight-up retard  in  urlLink Radio .  (Please click on link.  Trust me.)  He's one Kabbalah bracelet away from being declared an official has-been.  He needs this.  Actually, I'm not totally against  urlLink John Edwards .  Maybe he can channel the spirit of Ladybird Johnson and get her top secret recipe for "Trout and About Casserole", which sources say she took with her to the grave.

          Marlon Brando celebrated his deathday yesterday at the age of 80.  It is a shame how God works sometimes, taking away a man known as the "Best Actor of All Time," when there are dozens, nay, hundreds of other actors who are  urlLink so   urlLink much   urlLink more   urlLink deserving  of the Black Hand of Death.  Many of you may relish in Brando's performance in The Godfather, but if you really want to be touched by him (and who DOESN'T want to be touched by him roughly 40 years ago...), catch  urlLink Guys and Dolls , a wonderfully funny movie where you get the honor of seeing Brando sing and dance, not to mention parlez with  urlLink Frank Sinatra .    This being the last post until Tuesday, I leave you with this photo.  Have a wonderful holiday.   urlLink

        urlLink     Happy Pre-July 4 everybody! Or as Holocaust Deniers refer to it:  Jew Lie 4th.  For my stalkers out there (you know who you are, Sanjay), I'll be spending the weekend frolicking on the beaches of "The Cape" (or Cape Cod, to those of us not from there).  People have been asking me all week "Oh! What part of the Cape?" to which I respond "(Pause) The coddy part?", then pull out a 3 foot Caped Cod and slap them across the face with it.  Very satisfying.  Perhaps the best part about this weekend will be the first official wearing of my 4 year old Tankini (don't mind the deodorant stains... I've tried it on, oh, about 348 times) and accompanying skirt wrap (How can it be sarong when it feels so right?)    Tankini - the Official Tini of Choice in the War on Terror.

        urlLink    Above, an Italian gets down with his new lady friend.  Kalimera!  Or, as they say in "America", Good Morning!  I've got a horrible case of  urlLink  Olympic Consumption   (a tad more serious than "Olympic Fever" -- also a nod to the Athenian Olympics from yesteryear, when a "fever" was never just a "fever"... you either had "Bronze John", "Yellowjacket", or "Dropsy of the Brain").   I spent the entire weekend literally glued to my TV (I was fixing a cracked terracotta planter, and went for the volume button... never mind), leaving me with no choice but to watch the 2004 Olympics for 55 consecutive hours.  What a spectacular spectacle!  Of course, in true bored-idiot-fashion, here are my opinions.   1.  Phelps is On the Way   Let's begin with water sports.  Namely,  urlLink  Michael Phelpssch  .  I know this guy is a genius under the water, has a perfect swimmers body, huge flipper feet, etc.  But my hyper-judgmental side cannot help but squirm every time this guy is on camera.  The guy is mothafuckin cocky as all getout.  Really, he's like giant cartoon rooster Foghorn Leghorn, minus the looks and charisma.  Secondly, how can a man with a perfect body, abs of steel, etc., be so unappealing?   Australian hunk  urlLink  Ian Thorpedo  , even with that tre'-femenino reo-tard he wears, has charisma and sex appeal.  Phelps on the other hand, when interviewed, contorts his mouth in such a way that I gotta pull a giant plastic tarp over my head, Gallagher-style, to block any stray spittles.  Notice in his 300 commercials, rarely is he required to spray any S's (i.e. spots for AT&T and not Thprint.)  Guarantee you this guy gets crusty white mouth corners in the morning, and who wants to wake up to that?  On the other hand, clearly I would.    My friend Sarah has come up with an interesting theory:  The reason he looks good in the water is because he  tucks his ears into his bathing cap .  It's seems simple, but really this case is taking my friends and I hours to crack.     Did you see him on the podium?  He has got to be the worst fake National Anthem singer I've ever seen.  His lips remained still, while his cold, clammy tongue moved up and down in his mouth, animatronic style.  I was so parched after watching him, I polished off three Leadership Vitamin Waters.  That's nearly 8 dollars!  Sure, I started my own company soon after,  but still .  I tell you who I like -- that  urlLink  Vendt   guy.   urlLink  Silver medalist  , bounding over lane markers to winner Phelps in a show of true emotion, he just has a way about him.  He's got a lovely speaking voice, a nice gentle manner to him, and is painfully good looking (like I actually feel a void in my personal life when watching him.  My gut hurts.  Is that weird?  I should buy a cat, huh?  Well, thanks, asshole, but I don't remember asking you.)    2.  Gymnastics   Pretty boring on the whole.  America was fucking it up as usual.  And really, those male   urlLink Gymanstics   urlLink Twins  ?  Isn't there an   urlLink Antiques Roadshow taping   they're missing right now?   I will say, and I just can't help myself, what is up with those little Chinese girls?  I mean, all of the gymnasts are clearly small and malnourished, but these Chinese girls -- they looked like sea monkeys!  Even the announcers couldn't help themselves, explaining that one little girl who looked NINE was actually 16.  At least, that's what her communist bastard handlers would have you believe.    3.  Table Tennis   Women's = boring.  Men's =  slightly  less boring.  I watched it for 4 straight hours.    4.  Actual Olympic Events That Would Make for Interesting Gay Pornography   Lightweight Coxless Heat, Team Jumping Final, Equestrian Team Dressage, Men's Doubles: First Round, Horse Inspection 2, Men's Fly Semis, Backstroke - Heat 1, Men's Rifle 3 Positions Qualification, Men's Team Sabre Finals, Handball Ceremony, Pommel Horse Semis, Anal Windsurfing, Mens Double Trap Qualification, and the Bareback Bottoms Finals.    5.  Sometimes Judo, Sometimes Jew Don't   Didja hear the one about the   urlLink Iranian Judo champ who refused to fight against the Israeli  ?  What's wrong, guy?  Afraid to get your ass kicked by a guy who good with money, a little nebbishy and runs the American Media?  That's what I thought.  So there you have it.  I'm a little heartbroken that NBC has decided to air the Synchronized Diving Finals during the day, and Badminton and Weightlifting at night.  But I'll get back to you with more of the Athens action tomorrow.

        urlLink     Just this afternoon, I discovered a whole new one-two punch in the world of eating until you vom:  6-inch Turkey Subway Sandwich, followed by a bag of Sour Skittles.  Let's put it this way:  When Skittles whispers "  urlLink Taste the Rainbow  ", THEY AIN'T LYING.  This feeling of sickness somehow led me to peruse  urlLink  Subway's Website  .  After dozens upon dozens of seconds, I've come to a few conclusions:   1. Subway Takes Themselves WAY Too Seriously   Example:  To promote their new ground-breaking chicken sandy (chicken between bread with cheese), they use the slogan  Mediterranean Chicken Experience .  In the past, I have only heard/used this term in reference to getting railed by a Greek sailor.  (Myknos, call me!)  If they are referring to the "experience" of smelling their bread from a 10 block radius, then standing in a long line of 9-5ing zombies until the Middle-Easterner clad in rubber gloves looks you up and down, licks his lips, and asks you if you want "Pickles", then yes, I have "experienced" your sandwich.   2.  Jared Needs to Gain All the Weight Back and Die   I cannot tell you how sick of this douche I am.  Here's another example of me meeting an idol of mine, and getting it slapped right back in my face.  I happened upon "Jared" at the American Idol auditions in New York (don't ask).  The man is still pretty pudgy, greezy, and so pocked he makes Edward James Olmos' whiffled noggen look like Liv Tyler in Lord of the Rings.  Moreover, he completely ignored me.    And now their promoting this healthy bullshit to kids?  Their latest campaign has Jared shilling to children about the risks of becoming a grown-up Jared.  QUOTE:  Also, watch for Jared, Cody, Isaac and Madison in SUBWAY® restaurants’ newest commercials, which are designed to draw attention to the issue of childhood obesity.    NEWSFLASH: My entire childhood I subsisted on Subway sandies and TCBY (The Country's Best Yogurt... or is it Tender Cry from Baby Yapper?).  Point Being: look at me now.    urlLink LOOK AT ME NOW.    ps. Good luck to those kids.  Nothing like being used as an example in a commercial about childhood obesity.  The good news is that extra layer of padding will probably serve as a good bone-buffer to all the schoolyard punches that have their name on it.     3.  Cheap Merchandise     urlLink One.   urlLink Two.   urlLink Three.      urlLink And the ironically titled book about Subway's Founder:  Finish Big.    When all is said and done, I'll still be in line, hypnotized by the aroma of freshly baked bread, and shelling out only $4.33 for a turkey sandy.  Maybe it's the Sour Skittles that did it.  Huh.

        urlLink     If only he was!  EVERYONE REJOICE:    urlLink Craig Kilborn is leaving the Late Late Show!!    Seriously, I'd rather sit through a Clockwork Orange-style Tom Snyder Marathon then have to watch this dickwad mug for the camera with that huge, shiny, cocky face of his.  (This hatred of mine might stem back to a Daily Show taping a few years back, where a post-show "meet and greet" went horribly wrong:  Kilborn was shaking the hands of audience members, while ogling some 13-year-old whores in the back row.  As if my ego weren't already shattered, he then offered me a hand that was so clammy, so limp, that I think I can officially say I know what it's like to shake the cold, dead dick of Walt Disney.)  ATTENTION CBS:  If you're looking for someone who's got the goods to get your little CSI/Survivor/AmazingRace Ass into the Top Ten, look no further:  (me quickly putting on jazz pants, vest and top hat) TAAAA-DAAAA!

Is the Andy that I so dearly love on   urlLink The Assistant   the real Andy?  I had always assumed it was him being wild for the camera.  Now I'm wondering if he's toning it down.  Either way, even with all his antics, I find something truly endearing about him.  And the sooner he drops dead, the sooner he'll become a Kaufman-esque legend, so at least he can look forward to that.  He'll be the   urlLink Patsy Cline   of a new generation.

        urlLink     Just when I think the world has run out of news of the truly insane, a lil' gem pops up that makes the inner fibers of my brain tickle and burn with a whole new excitement.  The  urlLink  world may be at war  ,   urlLink Mike Wallace may have been arrested  , pregnant wives killed  urlLink  willy    urlLink  nilly  , but the TOP STORY on   urlLink CNN.com   right now is about an 1100 pound man who's lost nearly 380 pounds.  I think the only thing "breaking" about this story are the three industrial strength gurneys this guy's layin on!  SWOOSH!  But let us delve deeper into the many hidden layers of journalistic flesh:  42 year-old Patrick Deuel of Nebraska entered the hospital at 1,072.  He's already lost 372 pounds and is hoping to lose another 450 before bathing suit season.    "I wasn't able to see any light at the end of the tunnel," he said Monday.  He then added "Or my penis or my feet."    A group known as the League of Human Dignity helped arrange for Deuel to be driven to a local livestock scale, where he could be weighed.  Let me get this straight.  So the LEAGUE. of HUMAN. DIGNITY. arranged for him to get weighed on a SCALE reserved for LIVESTOCK.  I see.  Afterwards, the "League" took him to the elephant pit at the Zoo, where they covered him in a white powder and, using a hose and a long-handled broom, cleaned his hard to reach places.  They then rolled him over to the "Old Country Buffet", just to see the look on everyone's face, laughed, ate a quick buffet lunch ("None for you, Patrick!"), and got him back to the hospital on time for his 4 p.m. "Are You Still Breathing?" check.  But seriously folks, I've done some research on this  urlLink  League of Human Dignity  .  According to their website, you can become a   urlLink Member   for only $10, but their only branch is in Nebraska.  I'm willing to pay the money for a laminated membership card, I can tell you that.    Anyone want to start a branch with me here in New York City?  We could officially change the diapers of crazy homeless subway beggars without getting arrested.  And I think also legally murder Sally Jesse Raphael, but I have to double check the League's rules.   urlLink  Man trying to lose 800 pounds

[via  urlLink Defamer ]  This seems like a good time to bring up the Teen Choice Awards.  The hosts of the show are One-Night-In-Paris Hilton and Nicole Bichie.  That's nice that they're hosting.  Setting a good example for kids.  I hear the Awards show will feature a clip from the highly anticipated new season of "Contraceptive Spongebob Bulgepants."  (Terrible one, sorry.)    The above link also brings up some interesting O.C.-related gossip:  After the huge O.C. cast accepted the TV drama award, creator Josh Schwartz said that in the new season, "some beloved characters will be leaving the show," and "somebody probably will die."  Have you guys seen  urlLink  Rudy  ?  Remember at the end, when they all start cheering for him?  Here we go:  Mi-scha.  Mi-scha.  MI-SCHA!  MI-SCHA!

        urlLink       urlLink Explorers Find World's Deepest Hole.    Bea Arthur's vagina is demanding a recount.  I hesitate to even mention this, but hey, if I can't trust a bunch of anonymous people across the country with this information, who can I trust?  I'm a little shaken this morning following a certain dream I had last night.  An intimate dream.  Involving me and....  urlLink  ROB SCHNEIDER  .  Yes, THAT Rob Schneider.  What have I done to deserve this God?  It all started with a piece of muenster cheese I had before bedtime.  I've read that cheese before sleep can cause nightmares.  Next thing I know, my warped mind is taking me on an emotional/physical rollercoaster with the D-list celebrity who puts the Rob in "This movie theater just ROBbed me out of 10 bucks", often heard being said after seeing any one of his 3 movies.  The worst part?  I THINK I LIKED IT PEOPLE.  Funny bit of trivia:  Mr. Schneider was married to a woman named   urlLink London King   for 2 years.  One lucky lady.  Admittedly, this pales in comparison to the infamous "John Goodman Dream" of '01, which, as my close friends know, involved one overweight sitcom star and about 10 ounces of his puke.  And now I have to stop because my parents read this.

Because of my day off, I arrived to work with a seemingly endless list of things to do.  So this, my lunchtime post, will have to do until later today.  But I'll try to make it good.  First off,   urlLink Robin Williams has his ear removed  .  Sadly, surgery not fatal.    urlLink Project Greenlight planning third season  , and third movie.  In related news, I think my goldfish are depressed.    urlLink Ireland is lost city of Atlantis.

That doesn't hold a candle to my famous "Petrified Tampon Incident of '99".    urlLink  Koko the Gorilla used her sign language skills to summon a dentist due to an aching tooth.    She then signed to her handler "My fingers smell like doo-doo" and ate a pile of leaves.    urlLink Don Johnson is Poor.    Maybe you should stop massaging your genitals in caviar and having your butler prank call South Korea, eh, Don?    urlLink Prozac, the drug used by 1 out of every .5 person in England, has begun to seep into the water supply.    Queen Elizabeth's anus reportedly breaking out into hysterical laughter.  (I don't get it either.)    And finally,   urlLink a chain of private schools in California has been teaching immigrants well known facts  :  there are 53 states, 4 branches of the U.S. Government, and even exerpts from Arthur Miller's daring play "Death of a Traveling Salesman."  I've never read it, but something tells me he's sliced, diced, shredded, waffled, minced and grated to death.     Bored already?

        urlLink     I am the first person to readily complain about the poor quality of television programming.  Save for a few shows (Amazing Race, Reno 911, Little Britain, and about 10 others), tv has really gone south.  The good old days are behind us:    urlLink wacky 80's sitcom writers   have all dropped (dead or out) thanks to raging heroine addictions, and what does that leave us with?    urlLink Hope and Faith  , that's what.  And while I could rant for hours about   urlLink crappy sit-coms   and  urlLink  reality programming   , I instead wish to laud one of the best, most enriching (reality) shows on tv:    urlLink America's Funniest Home Videos  .  I tend to catch this show in late night reruns on ABC Family, as Sunday nights are saved for swaddling my hangovers in a cashmere throw and clutching it to my breast.  I happened upon it last night, and I swear to you, I spend one straight hour pissing my pants, then changing my pants, an ugly and exhausting cycle.**  **Please Note:  If Daisy Fuentes is hosting with that other douche, change the channel.  Funny videos cannot make up for the pain of watching dead eyes scan a telemprompter.  SO!  I bring this up for a reason, America, to share with you the funniest thing I have ever seen on TV.  Now this show was delivering as usual:  They had a Karaoke Cat (a small red tabby with blue bandana around his neck who, somehow, was lip synching to "Old Time Rock N' Roll"); 22 Dives in 33 Seconds (22 people slipping on or breaking off diving boards); and a montage of birthday cake fowl-ups, which really, when seen one after another, do the trick.  Then, the Faberge egg.  The Hope Diamond of AFV.  The creme of the crap.    The camera artfully captures a children's choir singing in a school gym.  All of their shining faces are facing forward, singing in unison, except for one girl.  Last row, you can't miss her, a heavyset, awkward pre-teen (painful memories, painful memories) is turned to the side, not singing a word.  She's wearing a red plaid vest and a mop of curly blonde hair.  There she is, looking distant, her body slowly rocking side to side.  I watch in anticipation.  Is she going to faint?  Knock everyone down?  I know it's gonna be good.  I was right.  As these kids, who undoubtedly tease this poor misfit on a daily basis (trust me), as these kids sing their final note, Red Vest covers her mouth, and proceeds to spew the most glorious fountain of vomit all over her classmates.  I mean, this thing was inspiring.  Yellow, with a gorgeous arc, streaming through her fingers, she manages to cover almost all of her classmates in barf.  Sadly, the camera cut away, meaning I wasn't able to catch the reaction of said schoolmates, the undoubted chaos and tears following this spew-fountain.  But even as I type this, my skull tingles with excitement, and I wish to watch it again and again.  People, if this isn't enough to make you tune in nightly, I have no more to give.

I'm the guy who loves relationships. I love women," the 42-year-old actor was quoted as saying...  ...while taking it up the ass from a huge black man.   "I'm the guy who's going to get married again. I'm not going to give up on that. I really love that kind of friendship and intimacy," said Cruise, who split from his girlfriend, actress Penelope Cruz, earlier this year.  He continued, whilst adjusting his French Maids costume, grabbing a huge feather duster, and tap dancing to Shirley Bassey.   "I like riding motorcycles and flying aeroplanes and I want someone who's going to enjoy doing the things I enjoy."  No problem there.    urlLink Check out this hottie.    She's perfect for you.

        urlLink     First of all, 10,000 hits has been reached.  THANK YOU to everyone who helped out.  There has been some talk about me giving away prizes...  I've given it some thought, and figured out that the only thing I can afford to give away are things I can borrow/steal from my office.  So, if any of you need binder clips, coffee-stained mousepads, papercuts or condescending tones, e-mail me immediately.  In other news.  My impending death.  My office is 2 blocks away from the Stock Exchange, and in order to buy my necessary lunchtime panini and stand at my usual begging corner, I must pass by said terrorist target.  I am so paranoid, that during my morning Au Bon Pain yogurt run, I alerted the cashier to a lone duffel bag by the door, which turned out to be some whore's gym bag.  YOU WOULD THINK SHE WOULD KNOW BETTER.  Seriously, infinite eye-rolling emoticons HERE.  So you'll forgive my lack of postings this morning.  I have been making certain arrangements (did someone say lucite coffin?), and laughing at how ironic this post would be if I in fact DO get blown up today.  Now I've stopped laughing.  My promise:  I'm gonna grab a panini, smoke 9 ciggs, have a good cry, and blog the rest of the day away!!!
