Anyway I juz realized today that...Its almost the end of July already! I have been here in Tucson for more than 1 mth already! Wow...I do wonder how my friends back in Spore are doin...  &nbsp;    Anyway, its really a boring day and I realli dunno what else to do except playing GB. Yep I juz got promoted again, thxs to the hard work of playing everytime. I guess when school starts, I will not hav much time playing GB already. Hahaxz anyway I passed my driving today already so I'm free to go...But still muz practice more on parking the car, though I did relatively well...Lolxz better not 'kua' myself too much or else get a bloated head. Anyway its kinda boring typing all these stuff too, and I'm oso getting impatient waiting for my mails from my friends.

        Today is my birthday! hahaxz I received quite a number of e cards, but was slightly disappointed when some of my best friends forgets abt it...hahaxz anyway, its being a tiring day. Know why I said that? Well first when I went for my driving lessons at 9am, the instructor pulled off a stunt on me and force me into I-10 ( A highway similar to Spore expressway, but muz move at a faster speed). I got the hell out of my life as I have to speed up to 75mph (abt 120km/h) but I onli managed to push the car to 72mph (114km/h) and boy, this sure is the first time that I drove a vehicle at such high speed. Wow man it sure is a totally new experience for me. And tomorrow it will be my final lessons, and I will get my graduated license whereby I can drive alone without anybody sitting beside me...     I was so bored that I played GB after my lessons...Then I didn't know what to do nxt so I went to the gym...That made me even more tiring...Well I had a birthday dinner wif my family at church's chicken ( something like KFC) and then head back home after that. Watched independence day on TV, then come online to type this stupid blog...hahaxz guess I was so tired that I need to sleep liaoxz...Happy 17th Birthday to Me!~ (^U^)

        Lolxz 1 more day and it will be my birthday liaoxz! Anyway if u all still don't know, my birthday actually falls on racial harmony day as well as international friendship day...Hahaxz my friends out there, i dun mind abt having any presents anot but i do think that the most important thing for a true birthday present is sincerity. Without it, giving a present is oso useless.     Anyway, today has&nbsp;being a great day...its my dads birthday! Lol and i drove every1 out for brunch together ( breakfast and lunch together). Actually i got nothing much to say abt today 'cause its a sloooow moving day. Kinda bored actually. Guess the best part of everything was that i got 2 bottles of Loreal Paris products for free! Hahaxz its actually because the cashier made a mistake charging my product, which is US$8.09 each and has to refund me $17+ back, as well as&nbsp;giving me the&nbsp;products FOC! Hahaxz this is the system in US. If they make a mistake, they will hav to give the products to us, FOC as well as refund the full amount of money. The reason is simple: we can actually sue them for charging us the wrong price.&nbsp;That means&nbsp;if i bought a bike here and was charged wrongly, they will hav to refund me and give me the bike FOC!&nbsp;Lol i do love US...hahaxz.Btw i hav to sleep soon, 'cause tomorrow early morning i will be having my 3rd and 4th driving lessons...Good night everybody!

        Wow time passes realli quickly...2 more days and i will be going for my nxt driving lessons, as well as my birthday! Hmm but i guess this year my birthday will be very lonely. The first year which i hav to spend my birthday alone without my friends...especially my close friends ( Hey guys dun be mistaken...the gurl i mentioned in my previous entry 'Weird Feelings' is my closest friend, not my gf!). I guess this year i wouldn't be getting any birthday presents from my friends in Spore. But anyway its alright 'cause its the thought that counts. Its the sincere well wishes that tells me my friends still care abt me...   &nbsp;   I realli do not know what to write anymore, but i do hav something i want to say to Wanyi, my good friend: I am always there for you, whenever you need me, wherever i might be. What ever happens, i will always stand by your side. In life, there will be ups and downs, and its up to you to overcome it. I might be there for you, but all i can do is to give you advise, and the rest is up to you. Hmm i guess i'm getting too emotional with her...Lolxz emotional as in close friendship! Anyway gtg hav dinner right now, then watch WWE raw life...

        Today went for driving lessons again...My second lesson and was on a busie road...kinda scary at first but when&nbsp;I got use to it, it was kinda fun...But the worst thing was that when&nbsp;I passed a police car, I was speeding at 60mph! Lolxz can you imagine that? Luckily&nbsp;I was not caught because the patrol car was busie on other things...Anyway&nbsp;I can't&nbsp; wait for the nxt lesson, which is on my birthday, 21st July...And some more it is a double lesson! And the nxt day 22nd July, I will be able to get my graduated license, whereby I can drive alone on the road! Wow...Can't wait man...   &nbsp;   Anyway when&nbsp;I got back home,&nbsp;I was slightly tired. But my dad wanted me to drive my whole family&nbsp;to a post office which is a few miles away...Boy was&nbsp;I exhausted when&nbsp;I got home. I sure is looking forward to another driving lesson, and my new car...Toyota Camry LE...Sure I do...As I never had the chance to own a car back in Spore...Anyway its getting late and I'm quite tired, so I'm gonna rest now...*Yawnz*   (-_-)

        I kinda miss my friends back in Spore, even until now... however there was 1 particular close friend which I had, and I will never forget her. I don't understand why I was pretty attached to her, and sometimes I still had that kind of feeling I had back then at the Spore Changi Airport.&nbsp; Today, she was back in my mind again...She stayed with me throughout my chalet back then in April 04 and we had some really great time together. I still remembered that we had pillow fights in the room...We brushed teeth together...Toast mashmallows together...Those were the fondest memories I had.&nbsp; Whenever I am feeling down, she will always be there for me... How I wish I could&nbsp;express to&nbsp;her how I feel all along...   &nbsp;    She kept me wondering why I had&nbsp;the heart to leave her behind...Even if&nbsp;the gurl I liked ask me to stay, I won't...But if she persuade me instead, I might stay behind and let go all my dreams of&nbsp;furthering&nbsp;my studies...I guess that's y friendship is the most important. Without that special person in your life, you might not know how to get on with it...I guess that's y even when I had something to tell her before I left, I didn't say though...But its all in my heart...And 1 day, I will let her know how I feel...I do miss her alot........

         Its the most exciting time i had today...I can't believe it man...I really did drive for the first time in my life on this day! Although this is my first driving lesson, i had already started driving on the road...Guess why? Hahaxz its bcause the driving lessons here in US starts on any road, particularly anywhere. Unlike Spore, driving can only be learned in a driving school...and so unlimited..   &nbsp;  It all started in the residential area, where the traffic is v light. The instructor taught me to accelerate and many other things which includes using the brakes, the mirrors etc etc...Me n my mum learnt together and i started to lose control when i first drove...nearly went head on into a bush...hahaxz i was slightly nervous mahxz no choice. But everything went on smoothly after that...then it was my Mum's turn...she almost rammed into a dustbin! Lolxz but no choice mahxz all beginner. However when the lesson was over, the instructor offered me to drive him and my mum home! I was kinda surprise but still went ahead. This was also the first time which i went into a heavy traffic which was kinda like a route which many ppl used...and boy was i glad that i made it home *phew...* Lolxz...I parked the car (anyhow) after that....It was damn interesting man...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
