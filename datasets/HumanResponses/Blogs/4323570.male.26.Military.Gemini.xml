      Waking up was rough again this morning. This time my body has a new trick- turning off my watch alarm in its sleep. It was a few minutes later, in a dream, that I realized it had done this. Normally it wouldn't be too big a problem. If my body tells me it's tired, I respect it enough to let it sleep. But today, I'm meeting a friend five am. We're going to run The Loop. The Loop is the nickname of the road encircling Bagram airfield. Nobody knows for sure, but it is said to be six point two to six point eight miles long. I think it's closer to six point twobecause the start and finish lines of 10k races are in the same spot. Other than my normal morning runs, I've run in two official 10k's so far and I've got the tee shirts to prove it. Recently I haven't had the chance to do my regular 10k morning run, because part of the course is blocked for demining. I think this shortens the run to something closer to five miles, but there is no way to be certain. Sometimes, I don't discover that the road is blocked until the last half mile of the run. At that point there are some poeple that decide to turn their little 10k into a morning half marathon. I tend to choose the path of least resistance, so I wait until they open the road again; usually no more than twenty minutes. Today on the phone, my wife and I talked about exercising. This is a subject of great importance to me for four reasons: First, I have been a hypochondriac since I was two. Second, I am rather sensitive about being overweight- which I am definitely not, but I used to be. Third, I am in the Army fighting a war. You've got to be in good shape for that. And fourth, I know my wife prefers leaner, well proportioned men. So, I figure I can kill three or four birds with one stone by working out regularly. My fitness goals are:  1. get my abs to show (six pack abs) 2. expand my chest 3. develop a "V" taper muscle shape in my back 4. run the two mile in twelve minutes and thirty seconds 5. bring my resting heart rate down to sixty beats per minute - all by the time I return home.  My wife often tells me that I set my goals too high or dream too big, but I never seem to accomplish anything if I don't aim for the stars. I still have a few other goals I'd like to accomplish before I leave Afghanistan. Maybe I'll get around to writing them down.

      Yesterday, at four am, I was on the phone as I am every day, talking to my wife.  We somehow got on the subject of my fickle memory, and she suggested to me that I keep a journal.  I don't think she expected me to make it a matter of public record, but I've never been good at hiding things.  Given my unusual motivation for writing, it is fair to say this will be a fairly boring blog. For instance:  Today I woke up at four am. It was strange; not so much that I was up at four, but that I didn't wake up until my watch alarm sounded. I have been waking up at two or three every morning for well into six months now. But as I've been learning, in life, the things that seem strange become routine very quickly, and then life itself just seems strange. Thus, in Afghanistan, if you want to use the phone and internet everyday without being interrupted, you get up around two or three in the morning. Maybe I had a hard time waking because I stayed up later than usual. We were on amber alert last night. That means I spent a couple of hours smoking and joking in a bunker (I don't actually smoke), waiting for the all clear. As fun as it may sound to some, passing time in a bunker ain't that great. Because of the tight space and darkness, slap and tickle got old really fast and the poor acoustic properties of sandbags, concrete, and gravel don't exactly lend themselves to singing. So after the longest game of flashlight tag ever, ALLL CLEAR was finally declared and we returned to our quarters. Ours is no more than a long toolshed- like the kind my grandpa used to build. Inside, there are six of us. I fell asleep instantly.  You can expect lots of the same in the posts to come.  Maybe I'll work in an anecdote or two.  I want to make sure to remember those too.  Lastly, I want to take a moment to dedicate this blog to my wife, who I call every morning at four am, Afghan time.
