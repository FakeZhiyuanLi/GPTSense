      Tomo night I am going to lead 26 pple plus one truck to overnight cycle, from West coast to east coast. That is the lengendary Coast-to-coast... hmm sound familiar? It is that album by West life lah. Original route I suggest is from East coast to Jurong, but the 'big boss' say the others will not be able to make it, so cut lor. WEAK! Anyway this stopid cycle was initiated last year, and plan to have it running this year lor, so two months ago I reminded them to have planning... but drag til now over 5 meetings, everyone did things half-hearted and half-way... then I "reminded" them to do this and that.. and you noe wat? In the end I become the Chief-organiser and was SUPPOSED by them to do all those things not done!! All the blame drops on me! Everyone blames me, " big boss" scold me, teacher scold me (scold me until I nearly cried at the back of her car, just now, just tears rollin in eyes), pple elsewhere scold me from behind.....Me ! Me! and still me?! Was that the trouble with being too nosey!? Can't pple concern others and work together,instead of " HEY, That is Your business, not my business, You should have done it!"  Anyway last min like now, I am still looking for information to make sure everything goes smoothly tomo night.... haiz...Work so stress, volunteer work also so stress... somemore got drama production and sis wedding! I wan to cry liao... boo hoo..  Hope tomo no one injure... no cars come to "buang" us.. *choy choy* *touch wood*. Or else I the " organiser" would be guilt-sicken for the rest of my whole life...I really hope no one is injuried. Please! Please! God Please bless us tomo.

      OH man! finally the overnight cycling is over and without anything happening?!THAT IS very the Strange ...... Let me tell you why is it strange.   Recee session the night before  1. My left leg clamped for the 2nd time this week because I was standing too long at computer lessons. Need mum to message everytime. 2. Almost fell down the flooded overhead bridge at marsiling (stopid slippery sandals), luckily my balancing still good, but strained my left leg again. 3. Got scolded because I am late for 20mins.Was caught in heavy rain on my way home(all drenched)to get my stuff before meeting them. 4. we went on alot of wrong roads, have to U-turn and turn. 5. Front scout not free, joined us half-way on the road. 6. Recee car almost rammed into a car at junction. 7. Keep hearing teacher(driving) saying " What the problem with that guy" ---> met lots of inconsiderate, " anyhow " drivers.   Before cycle,  1. Driver (jianhui)'s finger suddenly bleed. 2. I cannot access to my email in the morning to check for notes weisiang will send to me, because singnet's connection was down. Tried for haf an hour (panick), in the end , able to access but he did not send. 3. Weisiang's notes on bicycle-know-how was not printed, cos his printer suddenly spoilt. When teacher free, she say the room locked , unable to print. 4. Called Uncle bicycle we will collect ard 6 plus 7, so he can prepare. 5. Send boys out for dinner but front gate is locked, no keys to go out, therefore have to wait for teacher to come back (haf hour later). 6. Uncle bicycle called 3 times (2 missed call, 1 pick) to ask why we haven collect at 7+. 7. Driver late to collect bicycle, Bicycle Uncle call me to ask whether Alvin who collect 22 bikes is my friend. I told him not, my one is call jianhui and is 28 bikes. He went to check with the guy who ask him to come, they didnt book. Hahha. 8. Uncle bicycle called again at 830pm, saying we haven collect they are closing soon.    Finally! Moment of Cycle  No much cars on road, nice weather, no injuries, no one tired until cannot cycle. We reached before the time (at 4+).   ------------  After all that have happened, strange issn't it? Think my praying helps, Heah!

      Haiz, Too lazy to type everything on that idiot old man. Hope he will listen to me once and respect my decision to do things, such as calling my handphone instead of sms-ing in case of emergency.  Thursday quarrel with him on his sudden leave. Sat quarrel over phone becos he say I didnt bother to reply his sms. Funny lor i was at debriefing meeting with scouts over the nite cycling, listenin to teacher's lecturing, didnt bother to check handfone loh. Finally he called and I said I was at meeting. HE DONT BELIEVE me, that idiot, and dont wan to hear wat i say.. so i just chup his fone loh, y waste my energy. At night i message him, saying that no all pple like to lie, and I hope whoever lied the god will pardon 'them'. Hahha, actually toking about him, hope he go to hell, with all those back stab and fiction events he make up.    My big fat eye drop   Haiz, quarrel with pple makes my blood boil, my heart cant take it, that day chup fone, make my whole body tremble like hell and hard to breathe, it is real! teacher they all see, all scared. Let's pray he don't kill me, before I kill him.  Btw, did I mention, I just seen a form on the table implying he is taking leave for next weekend and 5 days at the end of june, period where there is most things to do becos of june's promotion?
