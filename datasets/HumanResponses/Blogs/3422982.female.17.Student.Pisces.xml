        Ok so this is all pretty stupid.  They didn't take my braces off.  Instead they put in a spring so I can barely open my mouth.  Eatting is a pain in the ass.  This research paper is almost over and done with.  I'm glad, but I've reached the point where I don't care anymore.  I can't take it anymore.  I don't meet all the requirements and I couldn't give a rats ass.  He's gonna have to accept what I have.  I just want to get out of here.  I need a vacation.  June 25th... I get my braces off, finally!!  Oh then I might not be able to take my drive test because I'll be leaving for Chicago.  I already got tickets and there was no way in hell I was gonna set the date back even farther!  It's bad enough my summers been cut back by almost a week.  It's not fair I tell you.  My life is shit and I'm getting sick of it.  I just wanna sleep and never wake up. later dayz

        Ok so we're supposed to do this research paper for my American Lit. class (my subject is Elvis) and it's got me so stressed out it's unbelievable.  And the fact that my depression is still lingering isn't helping.  Cuz with depression comes procrastination ten-fold.  So I'm sitting here thinking about how I should be working on it, but too "lazy" to.  And knowing that I'm going to completely screw this thing up and probably get shit from my teacher is making me sick.  Literally.  I feel queasy.  I wouldn't be surprised if I got sick.  So I've been trying to do things to get my mind off it when I should be working on it!  ARG...  Anyway, I have an orthodontist appointment tomorrow.  I hope they take my braces off.  They could at least take my top ones off!  There's nothing more they can do besides close up those two spaces they made, which can easily be fixed by a retainer, or one of those clear things that go around your teeth.  *sigh*  They will be off before summer, or both Mom and Phil are going to have some nasty things to say to those people.  Hell, even Phil is getting pissed and annoyed.  bah!  I'm off to procrastinate some more, I plan to work on it tomorrow.  Seriously, I will.  You just watch. later dayz

      Well that fucking sucked.  I went to take my drive test yesterday but the two DOLs I could have possibly gone to were booked until July.  So fuck getting my license before I go to Dad's.  I plan on cheating the system.  Go to Dad's, tell them I just moved there, and never had a chance to take my drive test, and get an Illinois license.  I plan on living there after my senior year anyway.  The only bad thing about having an Illinois license is that I can't be on Mom's insurance because I have to have a Washington license, but I really don't care.  Rachel can drive me, heh.  At my ortho. appointment the nurse that was working on my totally fucked up, so I was there for over an hour when I should have only been there for 45 minutes.  The only good thing outta that whole damn day was the fact I got my hair dyed black.  Yup.  Jet black too.  I was told in the sun it has a little bit of a blue tint to it.  I've yet to see it, Phil says he has.  blah... Kevin just called and it's after 8.... fucker.  Lucky Nate wasn't sleeping or he'd have gotten beat by my family.  Ok I leave for Dad's on Tuesday!!  Oh yeah!!  Can't wait!  Gonna be kidnapped by Nicky and Sherri!!  I wanna go to GO.... We'll have to talk Nicky.  ok I'm done later dayz

      Nicky demanded I make an update, so I am.  Took my two biggest finals today.  Holy crap am I nervous.  I seriously don't want to fail those classes, and I didn't do to well on either final.  I know for sure I failed my Spanish final... I had an A- let's see what happens.  Tomorrow is my last day of school, then I'll be a senior!!  I'm so excited (and I just can't hide it).  Then I might get to take my driving test on Friday if I'm lucky and there isn't a lot of people there.  wOOt!!  Mom comes back from her business trip in Florida late tonight.  She had fun.  Went down a water slide, all is good.  It had been in the 80s here for like the past week and then today it got crappy...  AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!  Summer vacation is almost here. weeeee!!!!  And I need some major money.  meh, that's about it that's going on with me though.  So there Nicky, have a crappy update.  Nothing goes on in my life so it's hard.  ok no more babbling. later dayz

      Kevin came outta no where today during third period.  He was with the Life Skills students collecting the recycles.  He wouldn't tell me why he was with 'em though.  However, before he left, he gave me a kiss.  It was kinda unexpected but not really.  I had been getting the feeling he was going to do something like that soon.  But I had just seen him like fifteen minutes ago, so why didn't he do it then when he was busy doing something?  That boy can be random sometimes.  Anyway, my weekend was a relaxing one for once.  It was nice.  Sam and I both agree that I'm an empath too.  She wants to help me with it, but I dunno.  I don't see what it could do for me.  I have an appointment with the therapist this Thursday.  It's about time if you ask me.  Maybe I'll finally be able to get some stuff off my chest.  I don't like telling people my problems because I hate pity parties and I don't like looking for pity.  It doesn't do anything anyway.  But to be able to talk to someone and just have them listen and hopefully not say anything about it (except to tell me what kind of a person they think I am) is great.  I'd rather not tell my firnds my problems cuz I don't want them to worry about it.  I'd rather it just be me worrying about them cuz if I know they're worried about me and I really am an empath... I don't need all that worry.  Too much!!  Anyway, it's nice to know something about yourself though.  It just kinda scares me how deep I am in this empath thing...  The thing Sam had given me to read a while ago... I dunno, it's all kinda weird and I know because of this people are gonna start questioning my sanity, but I think I can make this believable.  Cuz what I've been going through has actually happened.  I need to stop reading Rachel's books.  ok I'm done rambling for today later dayz

      Well... yesterday was the seniors' last actually day.  I'm depressed.  I won't get to see the Farnsworths in choir anymore.  The halls are going to seem empty these next two weeks.  Teachers are starting to get all up-tight.  "There's still two weeks left!  Don't start slacking off!!" blah blah blah...  I'm trying to see if I can get my hair done this weekend.  Mom still hasn't given me a straight answer though.  I have about $30 to do with what I want to.  I have to see if I can get somebody to take me to the mall.  Mom still hasn't gotten a hold of my orthodontist to bitch them out about my braces yet.  I hope she gets some answers cuz this is ridiculous.  hmm... what else...  Life I guess is just crap right now.  Summer is a huge welcome.  I'm getting used to the fact that I'm going to be a senior next year.  I'm not maturing my-self yet though because I'm not officially an adult yet.  I don't want to waste my childhood.  So, I'ma be crazy, random, immature me until the day I get out of this "hell hole".  People can say all they want about how they want to get out of high school, but in truth, no one really wants to leave.  Sure, no one likes the work and all that crap.  But after a while, you're gonna miss seeing all those familiar faces and saying hi to people twenty times between classes.  You'll miss laughing at the pranks.  And as much as you hate it, you'll miss the drama.  Gossip in the real world is just what you hear on the news.  Only if you're lucky will you get any at work, and it's just not the same.  I'll be the first of my group of friends to admit that yes, I am going to miss high school.  As much of a pain it has been, I'll never forget it (until I'm old and senile).  And I won't believe a damn person that says they'll never miss it.  because they will.  well, here I go to get ready for my last year.  I'ma make it a good one. later dayz

      Bullshit, that's what it is.  I had an orthodonist appointment today right?  Yeah so I had another one all set up for June 25th.  I was told by my doctor that they would come off before my senior year, and since I'm gone all summer I assumed the 25th is when they were going to come off.  NO.  NOW WHY WOULD MY LIFE BE THAT SIMPLE?  GO THE WAY I WANT IT TO?  Yeah, November 22nd.  That's the day they get taken off.  For sure this time because she wrote final on my little chart thingy.  This is fucking bullshit.  They were supposed to come off before my senior year so I could take my senior pictures then and have that picture in the yearbook.  But no, I have to have my crap ass school picture as my yearbook picture.  Great.  That's just great.  So while everyone around me looks great, I get to look like shit.  That's just perfect.  BRING IT ON WORLD!  IT CAN OBVIOUSLY GET WORSE THAN THIS!!  Molly told me her therapist said she has to look at this quote everyday, "The only way from rock bottom is up."  I don't find that true.  There's a deeper level than rock bottom, it's called hell.  And I'm breaking through that rock bottom.  I've made a crack too cuz I almost commited suicide.  Yup, me.  The one who said I look down on those ppl, that I have no sympathy for them.  I'm a hypercrate ain't I?  I'm admitting it right now, I almost did it.  The scissors were right there in my hand.  I don't know what to do anymore.  When will my life end?  I wish it was now, then I wouldn't have to worry about anything anymore.  It'd be really nice. later dayz

      Ahhh!!  Ok so I got to go to a baseball game tonight with Mom.  It was awesome!  The White Sox won 4 to 2.  Oh yeah!  First in their division!!  Go them!  Anyway, so it was the beginning of the game and Frank Thomas goes up to bat, the legend of the team, and this guy behind us yells, "Take him out!  He's too old to swing!"  Yeah I was pretty pissed... he struck out.  Then, the next time he was up to bat, he hit a homerun, got two runs scored in.  I wanted to laugh in that dudes face, but ya know...  The Mariners just plain suck this year, seriously.  It's like they don't even want to play anymore.  I'm just happy cuz I got to drive.  Anyway, I'm tired and I have a headache, so I'm out. later dayz

      Yeah, so I had an attack yesterday.  I broke down after fifth period right in front of Kevin.  It was really embarrasing.  He was really supportive though.  I just wish Molly could have been there to talk to me.  I hope she's having fun being a camp counseler though.  Tonight is our final concert.  I'm glad choir is finally over.  YAY!!  No more dealing with Snavely!!  I'm excited!  And then tomorrow we get our yearbooks and get to mess around.  I forgot to buy tickets to get food and junk... I hope they'll be selling them tomorrow.  Mom and I are going to a baseball game tomorrow night too.  Good times.  I won't be able to take my driving test, there's no way I'll have time.  Some people are being optimistic about it though.  I don't think so however.  Which sucks some major ass.  I'm still in a depressed state and I can tell to because my back hurts.  AND I'm sick... I didn't have a voice this morning.  My throat is killing me at the moment cuz I've been singing all day for this choir festival.  Then I have to sing tonight and I'm done!  I can't wait.  Ok, I dunno what else to say at the moment.  I'll just keep my mask on and hope it doesn't fall off like it did yesterday.  Just gotta hope... later dayz

        I had another attack today.  I broke down after fifth period when Kevin hugged me.  I hope these attacks won't be so bad when school is out.  I just wish I could have gotten an appointment with a therapist sooner.  And to make things worse, Molly wasn't here today to help me.  She's a camp counseler for the rest of the week.  Hope she has fun though.  I may not get to take my drive test.  I don't think I will, but everyone else is being optimistic.  Today is also Mom's birthday.  We're not taking her out for dinner like we usually do, but Phil is taking her out Saturday, I get to stay at home.  Great fun...  my life is shit... I'm sore, I'm sick, and I'm still down.  I'll just keep the mask on, and hope it doesn't fall off anymore... cuz that was embarrasing.   later dayz

        I couldn't tell you why she felt that way,  She felt it everyday. And I couldn't help her,  I just watched her make the same mistakes again. What's wrong, what's wrong now? Too many, too many problems. Don't know where she belongs, where she belongs. She wants to go home, but nobody's home. It's where she lies, broken inside. With no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes. Broken inside. Open your eyes and look outside, find the reasons why. You've been rejected, and now you can't find what you left behind. Be strong, be strong now. Too many, too many problems. Don't know where she belongs, where she belongs. She wants to go home, but nobody's home. It's where she lies, broken inside. With no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes. Broken inside. Her feelings she hides. Her dreams she can't find. She's losing her mind. She's fallen behind. She can't find her place. She's losing her faith. She's fallen from grace. She's all over the place. Yeah She wants to go home, but nobody's home. It's where she lies, broken inside. With no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes. Broken inside. She's lost inside, lost inside...oh oh  She's lost inside, lost inside...oh oh oh ~Avril Lavigne  That's for you and me Sam.

      I went in this morning to an orthodontist that Dad's dentist recommended.&nbsp; They said they could take the bands off, but they couldn't put them back on because they might use a different proceedure than my ortho.&nbsp; They also said I couldn't leave the bands on like they were either because of the way they were jamming my gums I could end up with an infection.&nbsp; And as sensitive as my gums are already I was not looking foreward to that, so I let them take 'em out.&nbsp; Much blood...&nbsp; But at least my mouth no longer hurts.&nbsp; They said if worst comes to worst, my ortho. will just have to put spacers in those spots so they can replace the bands.&nbsp; I can only pray that those teeth don't move, but with my luck they will and I'll end up with another month of braces.&nbsp; Fuckers.&nbsp; Dad's working everyday until we leave.&nbsp; So Cody and I have full control of the tv, it's very nice.&nbsp; Well, that's all. later dayz

      Oh man did I have a blast at Country Thunder!!&nbsp; So what if we got lost along the way and Krissy made a 2 and a half hour trip into almost seven hours.&nbsp; We still made it there for the group we really wanted to see.   Sherri: Hey look, big hallow elementry school. Amy: *looks at the decrepit building and laughs a little, laughter stops when she reads name of school 'Big Hallow Elementry School'* Sherri: *almost dies laughing at look on Amy's face*  Krissy: Whoa wait... say that again. Amy: It&nbsp;says take US-12 to Counrty Road U, then left on Highway B. Andy: What's up&nbsp;with the fuckin' letters?! Sherri: Wisconsin is messed up. Amy: Hey!&nbsp;&nbsp;They ran out of numbers ok?!?! *uproar of laughter*&nbsp;  I only saw two groups preform, but hey.&nbsp; The tickets were free, I'll take what I can get.&nbsp; I saw Trace Adkins and Lonestar.&nbsp; Ok, so I only saw parts of Trace because I was getting food and watching Andy jump on a trampoline.&nbsp; And we didn't see the end of Lonestar because we wanted to be the rush back to the cars.&nbsp; Which I found all by myself thank you very much.&nbsp; Yes I was the one who found the car, so, go me!&nbsp; Took us an hour and 15 minutes just to get out of the parking lot though because there was so many people there.&nbsp; I have never seen so many drunk 20 something year olds in my life.&nbsp; Holy shit.&nbsp; Man cute guys without shirts though, damn!&nbsp; I heard later on the radio there was 60,000+ people there.&nbsp; I don't think I'd do it again.&nbsp; They were all assholes there.&nbsp; I almost decked this one lady behind us in line for the port-o-john because some drunk bitch just cut everyone, so the lady behind us started bitching saying stuff like, "Well if you're just gonna let people cut maybe I'll do the same!"&nbsp; I just looked at her like she was disgusting.&nbsp; We didn't hear from her again.&nbsp; It seems Grandma really is moving out.&nbsp; She's been cleaning out her room.&nbsp; Dad crapped his pants today too.&nbsp; He's sick, but he's still going to work.&nbsp; Bought himself some depends... *stops typing to laugh her ass off*&nbsp; Ok I'm good.&nbsp; I haven't heard back from Mom yet on whether or not I'm going to Texas or coming home early.&nbsp; She said she'd call me on Saturday though.&nbsp; Apparently Rachel is having second thoughts to.&nbsp; Which kinda scares me because she always talks about home much she loves her home...

       Yeah so I titled my last blog, "wishing for home".&nbsp; Well my wish is about to be granted.&nbsp; I know longer have any respect for my father.&nbsp; The only thing he does is lie, and I now understand why Mom divorced him.&nbsp; First thing that pissed me off:&nbsp; He tells me he's going to drive me down to Kansas for Rachel's birthday.&nbsp; We were going to leave on her birthday, but Cody leaves that day and he needs to drive him to the airport, so we're leaving the next day, Thursday.&nbsp; I asked him, looked him right in the eye, while I was on the phone with Rachel, "So when are we leaving?&nbsp; That Sunday?"&nbsp; And he said yes.&nbsp; What did he tell me yesterday?&nbsp; "I never said that.&nbsp; I'm not staying out there that long."&nbsp; It's not even five days.&nbsp; It's barely four because of the long drive, what?&nbsp; He expects to go out there say hi, then turn around and come back?&nbsp; Then Sherri called me earlier today tell me that Krissy had two extra tickets to County Thunder and I was invited.&nbsp; Well I had to wake Dad up like an hour ago because he's working a tweleve hour shift and when I asked him he told me no.&nbsp; That it was too long of a drive.&nbsp; I'M SICK OF HIS SHIT.&nbsp; To me, three hours is not that big of a deal.&nbsp; And it's not like I'm doing the driving.&nbsp; For the past three or four years, he's been constantly telling me that I'm young and I should spend these years having fun.&nbsp; WHAT THE HELL FUN CAN I HAVE IF HE WON'T LET ME DO ANYTHING?!?!&nbsp; I know for a fact that Mom would have let me go.&nbsp; She told me herself that she loves seeing me getting out of the house and doing things with friends.&nbsp; I haven't left this house since the baby shower and I hadn't left the house before that except to go see Spiderman.&nbsp; When Sherri was here the only reason I got to leave the house was because she can drive and she has her own car.&nbsp; I know I can't really blame Dad for not taking me anywhere because he has to work, but if I have a chance to go do something fun do I get to do it?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I live with the biggest hipocrit known to man and I'm sick of it.&nbsp; I'm fed up, I don't want to deal with this anymore.&nbsp; Every year he breaks his word, and every year I'm stuck in this house complaining I have nothing to do.&nbsp; Well I'm done.&nbsp; I'm not even gonna bother moving out here after high school because I hate the neighbor like I said in my last entry.&nbsp; I might stay in Washington and go to BCC for a year for my break and then move on.&nbsp; I don't know what to do anymore.&nbsp; But first thing tomorrow, I'm calling Mom and getting the fuck out of here as soon as I can.&nbsp; I'm done.&nbsp; No more.   later dayz

      Well Sherri has just left, so it's back to being completely bored.  Dad seems to be working seven days a week now, so I expect to do jack shit until we drive to Kansas.  Assuming he doesn't do what he always does, and change his mind last minute.  I feel like crap right now and I don't even know why.  I'm sick of being here.  I wanna go home, I'd have more fun with Nate and Phil than sitting around this shithole doing nothing.  I'm seriously reconsidering moving out here after senior year.  I don't like the neighborhood, I wouldn't trust myself alone anywhere, so getting a job here is out of the question.  I don't know what I'm going to do anymore.  I don't know why I get so excited about coming here.  I just end up wishing I was back at home.  I'm glad Rachel's having fun though, I don't have to worry about her.  I want to do a lot of stuff but Dad just ruins the mood.  I think that's why I feel like crap right now.  I could just sit in a corner right now and I wouldn't be bored because of the way I feel.  I have to motivate myself to type this.  oh well whatever, I'm done. later dayz

      Yeah so that secret that had been eating away at me... Well, the whole family was told yesterday.  What was it you asked?  My aunt tried to commit suicide... Why was the whole family finally told yesterday when this happened a month ago?  Because she tried it again.  I knew it was going to happen, but I didn't want to believe it.  I'm in shock right now, I have been all day... I've tried doing things to keep my mind off it and I can't.  I feel so bad for them.  I don't know what to do, not that there's anything I can do.  It really sucks.  But, oh well.  I'll just have to sit around and worry.  I just hope this time they keep her in the hospital for a while. later dayz

      Today was great.  I woke up about 1:30 and was like, shit... Sherri's gonna be here in about half an hour.  So I got up and was running around the house trying to get ready.  Just as I'm walking out of the bathroom, the doorbell rings.  Great timing on my part.  Go me!  We went out to eat, then to the mall... then out to eat again heh.  Good times.  I got myself and Rachel a lighter.  Mine says, "I tried sniffing coke once, but the ice cubes got stuck up my nose."  And Rachel's says, "Aunt Em, fuck you and fuck Kansas, I'm taking the dog, Dorothy."  Weee!!  I found out today that I'm going to Kansas to see her for her birthday.  I'll be a day late though because we have to take Cody to the airport on the third.  Oh well.  I still get to go out there.  I need to call my mom soon and give her an update on how things have been going.  hmm... Well I can't really think when I'm trying to be quick.  So I'll probably be back later with a rant, cuz Dad pissed me off today.   later dayz

      Sherri is supposed to come over next week, and I get to see my family on Sunday cuz of a baby shower.  Cristen and I are ok now.  I e-mailed her and everything is good.  I'm glad.  I really did respect her and look up to her as a role model.  I just like the way she handled her life.  Mom told me Nate misses me.  yeah, I miss my cat too.  Dad took my shopping today for Rachel's b-day presents.  I never went to bed Monday night, holy crap... I felt like shit.  I've been trying to talk Dad into driving me out to Kansas to see Rachel for her birthday.  Have you ever had a secret, and you couldn't tell anyone?!  Yeah I have one and it's eatting away at me.  A few people know, but it's not like they have anyone to tell so I don't care that they know, but the one person I want to tell I can't and it seems her life right now is already shitty, but... I want someone to talk to.  So I don't know if I'll tell her when I see her.  blah...    urlLink        later dayz

      Not much has been going on here at home.  All my game systems arrived on Friday, but Dad doesn't go back to work until next week, so Cody and I don't have control over the t.v.  Speaking of games, Cody wanted my Harvest Moon 64 (cuz it's really rare and hard to find) so I told him he could have mine if he bought me DBZ:Budokai 2.  Which he did.  Good trade in my mind.  I somehow got control of the t.v. for a while and just played that for hours.  Beat it twice already.  It's better than the first, but really weird and fustrating.  (I will fuse Goku and Vegeta... damn you Buu...)  Other than that though, nothing's going on.  I saw Spiderman 2 today.  Better than the first.  Doc Oc was cool.  I could be watching the fireworks that everyone on my block is shooting off right now, but meh.  I don't wanna get chewed up.  Listening to them is just as fun.  Ok, so until something exciting happens (like me getting my contacts), I'll be off. later dayz

      Yup...  Ross Gellar and Rachel Green.  Kevin called me earlier today and wanted to talk.  He apologized for what happened before I left.  Then he said he was talking with Ryan and Alex and I came up... what's new?  Anyway, we both decided that it would be a good idea if we broke up.  It was more his idea than mine.  We're still friends and there's no hard feelings so I glad for that, but it still makes me feel like a rotten bitch.  He told me I shouldn't feel that way but I can't help it.  I hate seeing any of my friends hurt, and knowing that I probably hurt him makes it worse.  But it is a good idea because of what we're doing after high school.  There was just no way it was going to work out.  So I'm going to take my own advice now and stay away from guys.  Like I keep telling Sam.  That's what I'm gonna do.  There's no point in looking if I'm just going to be leaving, so fuck it.  I'ma be single 'till I settle down somewhere, wherever that may be.  Illinois, Arizona, Washington (yeah right), Utah (don't ask), Kansas, hell who knows where?!  Just no more guys.  Apparently I'm not ready, so I'm done.  I'm just gonna sit back and love the single life, cuz it can be seriously fun. later dayz

      Ok well I'm here at Dad's.  wOOt.  Cody and I are already having fun, I had him watch Red vs. Blue, good times.  We went junk food shopping today.  Holy crap, I think we bought more stuff than ever this time.  I think I'm starting to get sick I've eaten so much.  And of course to make things worse I started today... arg...  Set up an eye appointment too.  Friday, contacts again!  Yay!  I highly doubt Dad will take me to get my license out here.  So I haven't gotten my hopes up.  I'll never get my license so I better get used to it.  Plane ride sucked too.  I couldn't fall asleep for the life of me.  And I was so tired and uncomfortable.  *sigh*  ooo I need to call Sherri, maybe I'll do that tomorrow.  Well since I just got here, nothings happened.  House is really kinda quiet without Grandpa here...  Ah well, life continues.  And it seems both my families are getting more and more psychotic as the days roll.  So, I will right another time.  Probably after my eye appointment. later dayz

      Yup, I'm at Sherri's now.  Got here at about one this afternoon.  I watching her beat RE0 and talking to Rachel on the phone.  I wish there was something I could really do to comfort her... easier to do in person for me I guess.  At least she could call me.  But, anyway I'm here 'till Sunday.  So until later, here's your little pointless update. later dayz

      Oh boy here we go... Thursday: Dad and I left at about 5:30ish and were expecting a nine hour drive, so we packed a shit load of cds.  We took turns, he listened to one, then I did.  We swtiched off with our driving too, every other two hours.  I almost flipped the car according to him (and maybe I could have, I don't know) when I almost missed the street we had to turn on to get to Rachel's.  But hey, we were alive so all was good.  Rachel was alone when we got there, so we waited for Mick to get home and then we all went out for lunch.  After that we went back to the house cuz Mick was expecting friends and he gave us directions to a hotel, so that's what we did next.  Rachel took us to a hunting store and Dad bought a couple of bear figurines as gifts (one for a friend of his and one for Grandma).  Then we took Rachel home and Dad met Isaac and Denise. Friday: Rachel's old friend Rachel (...) had planned to take Rachel shopping and I guess said I could come, so I got to meet her and her mom Cricket (nickname).  Two extremely nice people.  We shopped with them for about two hours and then they left for a dentist appointment.  Dad took us out to lunch at a good BBQ place (Famous Dave's) and then we took Rachel home so she could help Denise set up for the party that night, although Denise was pretty much done when we got there.  They sent us out for ice cream... yeah... We had stopped back at the hotel first so I could change my shirt cuz it had gotten mud on it from one of the dogs and Dad ended up wanting to watch Jepaordy.  Then, I said we should go to K-mart for ice cream because then I could pick up a cd and book I wanted but that K-mart didn't sell ice cream so we headed over to Wal-mart.  Holy shit... white trash EVERYWHERE.  But what's new for Wal-mart?  So about two hours later we ended up back at the house with the ice cream, we had gotten it from the place Denise told us to get it in the first place, ha.  Dad was asked to cook the hambergers and hotdogs.  I think he wanted to because it kept him busy and he wasn't standing around feeling ackward.  I got to meet two of Rachel's uncles and their wives and kids.  I'm amazed I even remembered names.  The only names I don't remember are her aunts.  I spent the night with Rachel because Dad snores so damn loud it keeps me up.  I could here him in the hallway of the hotel it's that bad. Saturday: Denise drove Rachel, Dad and I to the county fair.  I'm sorry Rachel but that fair was really, really wimpy... It could fit into a Puyallup Fair parking lot.  But I got doughnuts so it was cool.  Then we went out for lunch.  Dad insists our waitor had the hots for me... whatever.  Denise went home and we picked up Mick and headed for the mall.  Got me some comics!!  Finished off another one of my series, so I'm happy.  I also got a book written by Penn from Penn and Teller (yeah the magician dudes from Vegas).  Appearently it's about a guy whose wife is killed or just dies and he befriends this gay guy and he ends up gay.  All this being told from a sock monkey's point of view.  After that Mick had us play Risk with him and just when everyone was starting to actually understand it and get into it, he had to leave to go see a movie.  So Dad took me and Rachel to grab dinner (Taco Bell) and we watched our shows.  We left after that. Today: We left the hotel at 6:30ish and got home at 2.  I drove for about an hour I think.  I was just way too tired because I practically never slept on this trip.  Soon as we got inside I went to Dad's room and slept 'till 5.  Sherri called me not too long ago asking if I was going to come to her house.  She wants me to so I said ok, but I don't think Dad wants me to go.  Sherri thinks it's because I'll be gone a week, but I don't know.  So I'm off to go get answers out of him before I call Mom... it's starting to get late over there so I gotta hurry. later dayz

      Blogger needs to make up it's mind.  First it told me my screen name didn't even exsist and then it kept telling me incorrect password.  It finally worked though as you can see.  Yesterday was hell.  Dad took Cody to the airport and I went with, just to get out of the house.  While we were there Dad and I started talking about our trip to Kansas.  He said I was going to be driving some of the way and as a joke I said, "yeah watch us get lost."  He said no because I'd have the directions.  He then went on to say that we weren't leaving until 6 that morning after he said the day before 4am.  I corrected him and he said, "No 6 cuz then we'd get there at about 2, or if I don't get my check 9 then we'd get there at 5."  I got mad saying the later we got out there the later we were staying and he said no.  So I told him he could go back alone and I'd just stay out there, he could mail my stuff home.  He then leaned over to whisper something in Cody ear and he started laughing and said, "Yeah especially when she does this," and he ran his hands through his hair.  Dad then had the never to turn to me and say, "Guess what I said??"  He looked like he was all proud of himself.  I glared at him and told him it was probably something about Mom and he said he never talks about her (my ass, he's always making fun of her).  I said, "well there's only two people you bitch and moan about, Mom and Rudy." (Rudy is my gay uncle who I hate to no end)  As soon as I said Rudy, Dad and Cody busted up laughing and slapped hands.  I had enough, told them to stuff themselves and walked off.  I planned on just walking to the car and waiting.  After I got half way to the escalators Cody went walking past me, so I knew Dad had to be behind me.  I heard him ask why I was mad, and whip around looked him square in the eye and said, "Fuck off asshole."  He just looked at me so I continued walking.  I heard him say, "If you keep walking we're not going to Kansas."  But at that point it didn't matter because either way I was going, not like I don't have a mom or anything.  Cody and him walked back to his gate and I was still walking.  Once I got to the escalators I stopped and called Rachel because I was on the verge of tears and I just needed to talk to somebody.  I was going to tell Dad on the way home everything that was on my mind.  I was going to tell him that he was the reason I was going home early.  That I was sick of his teasing, that the teasing I've been getting all my life was what drove me to almost committing suicide.  I was also going to tell him why I hated Rudy because I knew he was going to ask.  I couldn't believe he'd even dare compare me with  that .  It's not that he's gay, I couldn't care less about that.  But Rudy is the only that messed with me the most.  In his mind, I'm supposed to respect him more than anyone and for the life of me I can't figure out why he would think that.  And then when I brought Rachel to my dad's house for my 15th... everytime I've seen Rudy after that he's always called me his "little lesbian", and then asks me, "how's your lesbian friend."  He hasn't asked me yet this summer, but if he dares I'm going to tell him I don't have one.  I've seen him twice and have been giving him the cold shoulder kind of.  I give him very, very short answers.  But after all this, we're still going to Kansas because instead of driving home from the airport he went to Target and asked me what pop I wanted to bring on the trip.  I've talked to him some today.  I plan on milking him for all he's worth on this trip after what he did.  I also plan on giving Cody a piece of my mind.  I'm sick of the taunting, teasing, be-littling, whatever you want to call it and I'm not taking it anymore.  If telling my parents to "fuck off" is the only way to get them to stop, well then, looks like I'm going to be saying fuck a lot more. later dayz
