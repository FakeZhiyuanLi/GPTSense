      My day starts with me dragging myself to work.  My new blood pressure medicine makes me sleepy, dizzy, or cause headaches until I get use to it.  Great just what I needed.      At work they made the annoucement that they will be out sourcing part of our dept by November.  The are also closing our other center in FL.  Time to look for a new job!     This evening my friend Julia and I went to an auction.  I got a ugly Indian wood statue, and two new framed pictures one of a fat cat and the other of a fat dog.  I only paid $4.00!  After the auction we went to Harrahs for dinner and pigged out.  We gambled a little and I came out $40.00 ahead when we left.  Overall a full day but I can't complain.

           I don't know what to say but Garrett and Rich inspired me.  I went to nafzinger.com to see if Garrett had posted his pictures from Pride.  Ugh not yet but that's ok I think I look fat.  Then I clicked over to Rich's site and love the pic of his new haircut.  The mohawk is so unique, you go gurl!      I was just sitting at my computer thinking of what to do with this new project I've started for myself.  They want me to train someone else on how to do the scheduling.  I want to make a training manual to show them how serious I am about do this.  I have been there too long to be taking for granted. (10 freaking years)      Well it must be fate or something. My cat decided to sneak out the wide open balcony door.  Here I am up late looking for a all black cat in the dark.  My dog was not so helpful.  After a few mins I finally found her and she seems disturb that I interrupted her adventure.        I'm off to bed because the morning is going to come too fast for me.

      I left town Friday and drove home to Minnesota.  It was a much needed vacation.   I was disappointed that I barely saw Michele.  It was great to see my mom and how well she has progressed through her program.  She has lost around 60 lbs and looks great.  My brother owns a townhome.  It is in great shape and size, just needs a little work.  I'm sure he will like it more when the pink is gone.  I have to work very early and I still need to unpack so this is all for now.

      I had this joke with my supervisor about how he owes me candy.&nbsp; Today he hands me a purple sack full of candy yeah!&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I realized its actually my friend Lynda who put it all together and have him give it to me.&nbsp; Its wrapped in all purple (my favorite color).&nbsp; I got a pink toilet with candy plungers and watermelon candy,&nbsp; a candy necklace, and grape PEZ.&nbsp; Yeah for me!&nbsp; Thanks Lynda!  &nbsp;  Today was so busy at work and I was kind of grumpy for the first half but now I'm off work and sitting typing this.&nbsp; I got to get home to let my fat dog out.  &nbsp;  I'll make my decision if I'm leaving town tomorrow...I'm leaning towards next weekend.&nbsp; I have too much to do to get ready.  &nbsp;

      When I came into work today it started out kind of crazy.  Then one of the supervisors helping to do my job just took over.  I could have slept in until she was ready for me to work.  After work my roommate, Tim and I went to dinner.  It was nice just to hang out together.  After dinner we drove around the city.  We grabbed a Verge magazine and tried to find the new bar NV...oh wait its still under construction.  We drove by Back Door, too.  Now I know where the my boys hang out.  Chatted with Chris online.  He asked me to let the dogs out tomorrow.  We chatted about jobs.  He told me where I could look.  Its all in who you know not what you know.  I didn't even think of him as a contact.  If I get laid off I hope it doesn't take me long to find a new job.  I think I'm going to leave town this weekend.  High School Reunion is Friday and I just want to see my family, Michele, and get away for just a little bit.

      Well today was kind of lazy.  Julia came over and we watch Mystic River.  Good movie but the ending wasn't complete to me.  I finally washed my fat dog.  He so needed it.  Made dinner while I watch my Sunday shows.  (Six Feet Under and Queer as Folks)  I should be in bed already but anytime before midnight is very early for me.  Until next time.

      For some reason lately I can not get to bed before 5am.  This has got to stop because, starting Monday for the next two weeks I have to be at work at 6:45 am.  4th of July weekend was 4 long days away from work.  I couldn't afford to go out of town like I planned but I still had a full weekend.  The first two days I was just lazy and stayed in my apt watching TV and sleeping (my favorite pass time).  On July 4th Jules and I did our laundry.  Then we met up with her fiance, Moses and ate at KC Masterpiece.  I would have rather grilled but hey I didn't pay so I'm not complaining.  Our waitress wasn't efficient so Jules go the manager to get half our bill taken off.  After dinner we stopped at Baskin Robbins and I got some purple and green ice cream (cotton candy) yum!  Then we drove around looking for the best price to buy fireworks.  Again I just wanted to ooooh and aaaaaaaaw over a professional display.  To my surprise in Jules front yard and down the street I enjoy seeing fireworks being shot off by amateurs.  Monday the last day of my long weekend.  I took Jules to dinner at Jose Peppers.  The damn attitudes of the Johnson County women.  We were like invisible because we didn't have a husband and screaming children at our sides.  Just a reminder that I like my single life at this time.  We went to see The Terminal a little long because I fell asleep for a few minutes but for the most part a cute movie.   This weekend should be quiet and not too busy because I am sooooooo broke until next Friday.  Atleast this paycheck will have our bonus on it.  I can not wait.  I hope to leave town for just a few days if possible.  I need to regenerate and see my family and my close friends.

      Its kind of weird but I've stopped trying to please everyone. I just too tired of trying to make everyone happy. I've been doing this for years and finally I just don't care.  I haven't posted on here in about a month so I thought I should update.  Still haven't heard a word about if they are laying us off yet and the tension at work is so depressing I can barely stand it.  Tim and I did not get approved for this house in Brookside that we wanted. Back to ground zero of searching. I have to call Bill to say we aren't interested in his 2600 square feet apt.  Friday the 13th was the longest work day ever. We were overstaffed just in case Jacksonville had to close. The hurricane was not scheduled to hit them until 2 am Sat. They never cover for us when we have bad weather but they are losing their jobs in November.  Friday night Julia and I went to the auction. I got a nice huge mirror, two candle lanterns, and a zippo lighter for Tim. Julia got glass bottles, and nice leaded glass lamp. After the auction we tried eating at Harrah's. After we stood in line, paid, and never got seated...Julia complained, I got our refund. We ended up getting Long John's, they were out of hush puppies and the customer service sucked. I swear all the employees ate there. She dropped me off and then I sat down and ate dinner. As I checked my messages I heard that James called. A new friend, so I called him back and he was at the movies at the time but I just happened to catch him in the bathroom. He would call me afterwards. When he called back we met at Ameristar for a drink. He left twice to use the bathroom I was prepared for him to ditch me. He is nice looking, dark hair, beard, a little short 5'7, I wore heels and we were the same height. After the drinks I followed him to his house and we watched a movie. He really seems to be a nice guy. He has a 3 year old son. He is kind of shy but he is pretty easy to talk to.  I was awake when Tim got him we chatted a little and then we crashed most of the day today. I ignored phone calls. I didn't even want to leave the house of have any company. I blew off Ryan and I really don't feel bad. He is going off to college in a week he will soon forget he ever knew me. Needless to say he is pissed at me. I snuck online under another sn to see if he was online. I ended up reading his xanga site and learned more about him than I would ever had heard from him. His mother is ill, two of his friends have passed, he has lost weight, and some girl broke his heart. I wish I knew more about him but we were never close like that. I wish him luck and hope he just fogets about me.  Lynda called today to say hi and mention she chatted with Marcellius. I really need to spend time with her.  Julia called tonight to see if I ate. Her and Moe picked me up and we got KC Masterpiece for dinner and stopped at Topsy for popcorn and limeade. Then they dropped me off for much needed alone time. I enjoy being alone way too much. James called this afternoon but I missed his call. I left him a message but I haven't heard back yet. Its all good. I don't have any high expectations. I'll just wait and see.
