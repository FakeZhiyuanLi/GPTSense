      I am making a website for my friend Amy. She loves wolves and I thought that while I was at it, I'd make her a blog too. Can't wait to see how it turns out!

      Today was my last day of being grounded. *whoop!* The bad thing is, I'm on restriction on the 4th of July! Oh, and I was on restriction for my boyfriends bday *sadface*  Isn't THAT a nice way to start off a new blog entry? Another thing that bites is that I had to work this weekend so I had to stay home while my family went out of town to see some friends for the 4th.  I took my dog to work today. I won't be doing that again anytime soon, but she was pretty good; considering.  Currently, I'm talking on the phone with my boyfriend and updating my website that I've created this blog for (to serve as added amusement). Check it out if ya want to! http://www.geocities.com/NoTaLLtHeRe324. I also changed the blog layout and it suits my site better^.^  Anyways, more later!

      I haven't updated in awhile, so I'm trying my best to catch up. My comp. at home is still screwed, so I'm having to use my gma's computer until I can fix it.  My Dad taught me 5 chords on the guitar a few nights ago. G, D, C, Em, and E. I told him I've learned them pretty well and that I wanna learn some chords from Green Day's "Good Riddance" and then he can teach me the song (because he knows it on the guitar). I'm actually learning now! *whoop!*  A couple of nights ago Dev, Richard, Tara, Becca n me went to the movies n saw "Dodgeball". It was SO friggin funny - great movie.  I went to Michael's last night n we watched "The Secret Window" which was pretty awesome. I left my pictures over there...poo. I was plannin on makin a scrapbook but I kinda can't w/o the pics. Oh well, I guess that means I'll hafta go back! *wink* Tomorrow? hmm...  Becca and I were bored today. She woke me up at 2 and we went to Starbucks (go figure). I tried a white chocolate machiato and it wasn't as good as my white mocha latté *sadface* but thas okay cuz I'm goin back soon! I've gotta go pick up pictures from Wal-mart tomorrow too...Good excuse? Yep. *nods* After Starbucks, Becca n I were drivin around n decided to drive by Alex's and she wasn't home so we went drivin by Dawson's. Dev and Richard were there even though they told us they were "painting" supposedly at Dev's. We felt like stalkers and called Dev n Richard to ask if they would mind if we stopped by, so we stopped by and I met Dawson. He was like "You're the girl dating Michael Deariso?" Me: "Yes" Rebecca: "Even though he doesn't claim her..." Me: "AH!" *slap* lmao, crazy stuff...  More later!

      Only 2 more weeks of freedom. I got my schedule thursday, and for the first semester I'm scheduled for Algebra 3, U.S. History, Chorus, and AP 11th Lit. I need to make a few minor adjustments before school starts though. I decided over the Summer that I really didn't want to be in Chorus anymore, so I'm dropping it and adding another French and an Art instead. They didn't give us our schedules for next semester yet, which is a MAJOR disadvantage, and I don't know why they're not doing that, seeing as they've given us our schedule for the whole year in the past. I have to drop chorus, move French 3 to the first semester, sign up for French 4 for the next semester, and move AP 11th Lit to 3rd block, causing my French class to be 4th block. That would leave me with Art, Botany, AP 11th Lit, and French 4. I just hope it'll all work out, because since I didn't register for the Art and French class at the end of last year, I have to take whatever is available. At this time of the year, it's good to know the Guidance Councelor personally (I grew up with her son). *wink*    Anyways, I've been working on my site summore, trying to get it updated. I've added another ventage post - a rant on the Atkins diet. I've been shopping recently for school clothes and I got this one shirt that's a boatneck and it's bright orange, and written in brown at the top of it, it says "I [heart] carbs" and it has a picture of a cow and a piggy dancing around. I think it's my favorite shirt now. Cute with my new denim skirt^.^   I have to work in the morning, and what am I doing? Sitting on the computer chatting and workin on my site at 2 AM. Niiiice, huh? Better go or I'll never get up.

      Last night I couldn't sleep. I got on the computer around 11ish(?) and stayed on til about 3. Michael called my cell around 12:45 and we stayed on the phone til 4 something and had a very meaningful conversation, which helped us to get to know each other better than we already knew each other. It was great. The only bad thing about it was that I couldn't fall asleep until somewhere in between 5 and 6am and I hadda get up at 8 this morning to get my car window fixed...  Okay, the story about my car window: It quit working one day and so I thought it was broken. It wouldn't budge, and I told one of my guy friends about it and he said if it was just a fuse, he could fix it. So I went to his house at 10 at night n he looked at it and said it couldn't be a fuse and to know the real problem, he'd hafta take the door panel off. By the time he checked the fuse and all other possible *external* parts, it was 10 after 11, so we decided against the door-panel thing (especially since something could go wrong and in case the door panel broke or something), so instead he put a trashbag and duct-tape over the window. That was on Monday. Tuesday was cloudy, and we were headed to McDonough, so I decided to put a trashbag and duct-tape over my window again in case it rained, and it was LOUD! When we got to Macon, we were close enough and the weather was clearing up so I took the bag n tape off of the window n drove the rest of the way with my window down and my music playin. It didn't rain the rest of the time, and I washed my car Wednesday. It hasn't rained since Tuesday. This morning I hadda wake up at 8 to take my car to get the window fixed before I hadda be at work by 2. So we went to the Prince Honda place and the guy looked at it, banged on the door, tried pushing the window up, and finally going to the driver's side and sitting down and pressing the "unlock" button on the driver-side door panel. Voici! The window worked. I felt SOOOO stupid! I must've pressed the button when I leaned on the door while I was driving, because I didn't know it was locked. We thanked the guy at the Prince Honda place and he said, "You're welcome, come back n see us when you have a problem." I almost died laughing at myself! OMG...*slaps forehead* After that fiasco, we decided to take it to GoodYear and check the alignment n rotate the tires n junk, so the morning wouldn't be a TOTAL waste. They checked it n fixed it and said that we'd hafta come back and get a new timing belt, but other than that and a slightly bent left rear rim (which isn't a problem), it looked good. So yay!  But ANYWAYS...After I slept for another 2 to 3 hours, I picked my car back up from getting the GoodYear place and came back home around 1ish and Alan stopped by to talk before I hadda get ready for work. I got ready around 1:45 and then worked from 2 to 6. There's a new girl at work and she's pretty cool - Serena something. We needed more help! I hafta work again tomorrow and Sunday. Sunday's Mom's 40th (SsHh!)birthday, so I feel bad about having to work, but it's not for the entire day and I won't hafta work again until Wednesday, so maybe it won't be THAT bad. I'll get her a present tomorrow;) I got to see Michael today^.^ After work, I msged him to see if he would be at Richard's this weekend and he said he was over there just for today and he said that Richard invited me n Becca over to watch a movie. It made me happy because I hadn't seen him since 5 days ago, on Sunday. Hopefully I'll get to see him again this weekend if he's in town, but if not I'll see him sometime before Friday.  School starts Friday - exactly 1 week. I'm kinda looking forward to it, but I don't want the summer to end because that means I'll lose sleep...hahah. I do miss my friends though and I'm ready to do  something  besides be bored and work all the time. I'm picking my - revised - schedule up Monday and it'll hopefully work out the way I want it to. If it does, I'll definately have a good first of the year. I don't know about my classes for the next half of the year until the end of this half, which is screwy, but if they wanna screw it up and make more work for themselves, let the stupid school system do it. Watch me forget to pick up my ID and my [FRIGGIN 20 DOLLAR] parking ticket...  I added pictures to my site! *yaay* Go me. It's coming along...Don't worry, it'll be totally neglected when school starts, you just watch.
