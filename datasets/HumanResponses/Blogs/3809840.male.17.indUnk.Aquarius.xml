      It might be nice to add the note that I feel as though I'll be referring to myself as Spunky, just for the hell of it.

      There are days where words don't capture the incredible feelings contained within my mortal body. This isn't one of them.  I haven't done much, but that doesn't bother me. I was fortunate enough to get my socail commitment of the week out of the way last night. That means that now I am free to do absolutely nothing for the next few days.  Summer could be better, but to say that merits a slap in the face. Nothing is ever perfect, and hence, everything could always be better. Slaps aside, summer has been dull and uneventful so far.  I think this serves well enough as a first entry. I will do the honor of throwing a link in for the benefit of any reader that may exist.  And so, Spunky's out for the night.   urlLink Michael Moore Hates America

      I found this online, it's pretty funny some of the comments people had made about it. Below are a few.         In an effort to encourage women to run for office, a group of activists decides to produce the movie  Political Porno  with the slogan: "Wouldn't it be better with a woman in that picture?"   ____  "Wanna know what that monument reminds me of?" Senator Cleland playfully whispers to Senator Daschle.  ____  As Senator Daschle embraces a young child, the boy is seen turning into a Hulk-like creature...  ____   "Lessee here: 1. No teeth...check    2. Flat head to rest beer on...check"

      Hey everyone... I'm in Williamsburg, VA and it's really nice here. Really really nice. I mean, I think this school (The College of William and Mary) may have just become my number one choice. Yes, I know, the name is long and it looks rather boring, but you can't judge anything just by the name. So yeah, it's really cool, I'm having a blast. I haven't been sleeping too well, but that's just because I guess I've been in a different bed every night for the last week or so. Anyway, I can't wait to come home.  I feel really bad that I kinda messed up a few things before I left, but that's okay I guess. We can't all be perfect, right? Still... I'm sorry to anyone who I put in a bad spot and I hope that when I come back things can be back to the way they used to be.     Oh wow, I'm such a loser. :-P   Oh... and I think my computer logged me off AIM at home... so any messages you left me probably got deleted. I'll just have to find out tomorrow. And... yeah, sorry for the away message I left with; it wasn't nearly as happy as it should have been.

      the title is irrelevant. I just wanted to post something happy, because I'm in quite a happy mood. I had a good day, considering the day started at midnight. That means it started with the movie at Kinga's and included fun stuff like screwing in Ali's bed... *putting the screws back in Ali's bed... also going to Barts.   No hablo espanol pero te quiero.   Other fun stuff too, but yeah.  &nbsp; I hope I see you tomorrow, it just won't be as cool if I don't.

      Oh it's true. I was so happy when I got my pictures back, and looking through them was just another thing that made today great. It's been a day of simple pleasures.    Bought a Bright Eyes CD, only Ali and Joanna really get why that's so good  Had a nice mid-day conversation with a friend I haven't talked to much  Developed my Columbia Pictures while I sat in front of CVS taking in the sun   Anyway, there are a few of you that have been waiting just as patiently as I have for these pictures, so I feel obligated to share them with you.    Columbia Pictures    So lets see here. Where to start? I'll just go in a order to track my time there as best as I can. Unfortunately I didn't get the camera until Wednesday when we went to Times Square so that's where this all starts.  &nbsp;   So lets get rolling. There are a lot of pictures. The ones that I liked and have meaning are posted where I just put links to the other ones. Either way I think all the pictures I took are accessible somehow.      This may have been the first picture I took. Jessie is on the left and... *blanks*... some other girl is on the right. Note: I'm wearing my "Eat the Rich" shirt and yeah, I like the way this turned out. I refined the little section of mirror so that it looks like  urlLink this    And here's one for Danny O'shea the ex- urlLink Sbarro  worker.   There was a guy making a poster on the side of the road. I bought the poster when he was finished with it cause it just looked so cool. You can't see it too well  urlLink here  but it's still worth posting.      That's Sharrissa. She's from Vegas, which is a cool place to live I guess. She didn't want me to take a picture of her, it still turned out funny though. She looks like an alien or something. Note: She's one of those people that bought Columbia stuff and wore it while we were there, for shame.      That'd be Times Square at night. Wednesday night, to be precise. I think you can even read some of the ads if you read close enough.      I also took this Wednesday night. Her name is Grace and she was a cool person. It was a fun night, but just because I met cool people.    So Thursday...     I saw them filming a commercial for MTV. They said they weren't even sure if they were going to use it, but I still saw a  possible  MTV commercial being filmed. A few of my friends were extras in it.      Tnat's Jessie, she was and likely still is really cool. She's a firefighter, which is also cool. Yeah, the sign reads "It's my B-Day".   Oh, Sharrissa just reminded me that we saw the funniest bum in the world on Wednesday night. She took a picture, here it is.      But yeah, Thursday, what goes next in the chronological order I'm trying to pull together.     These are a buncha the cool people we ran into. I was supposed to see some of them while I go down to VA to look at colleges but things didn't work out. And yeah, the guy closest isn't puckering, he's looking tough, just to clear that up.     The DA people went partying, sorta. Some came back a little different then they went. In Meredith Olson's case, she came back friendly and mildly attractive. How, you might ask, could she change so much? I think it was the alcohol. I think if the law makers could see the change alcohol made to her they would take away the drinking age.   And it's time for Thursday's last picture. I was hanging out with Allison. She turned out to be really cool, and continues to be really cool about  everything .     My hair was just too long, I'm glad I got it cut. I'm also glad that I can get away with writing run-on sentences cause this isn't a english assignment.   Friday...   Here's a picture from class. Jessie far left and Sharissa is next to her. Far right you'll see the pain-in-the-ass Spence girls. So annoying, except one of them was kinda hot. Except for the one who thought I was immature they all seemed to take an interest in me. Strange enough, since I didn't like them.    Jessie and Sharrissa before we all said our goodbyes.  Sorry it took so long to get these pictures up, what, it's only been a month? I was just finishing up the roll taking pictures like  urlLink this . Sorry but that one didn't come out to well. And the picture of Kinga's hand didn't even get developed. Oh well, anyway, that's all.

        So thank you friend for the time we shared   &nbsp; I've had an interesting day. I tried to get interviews at several clothing stores but all the big ones have store policies that you need to go through the corportate offices first. Stupid American Franchises. &nbsp; But I want to get back to listening to music, cause it's more fun then you'd think.

      ...aren't cool, especially when people feel the need to mess with  capetalization like that. If you're going to mess with capital letters  just move the one from the front to somewhere in the middle. (example:  Tragic=tragIc... haha, good times painting, or walking back from the  hardware place).     Anyway, I'm in the mood...      but what my father did   you know it don't mean shit   I'm   not   him      ...  sorry that was sorta  random. I'm listening to Bright Eyes and just felt like typing that out  as I heard it. It doesn't relate to anything else I've said. But where  was I, okay. I'm in the mood to do something like shoutouts except I  won't call it that because shoutouts aren't cool. The only thing  holding me back from those is that people get supersensitive to those.  "Did he put me in?" "Why am I not there?" "What's that supposed to  mean?" "That's all he could say about me?" Well, I'm going to explain a  principle here, so get ready.     If you aren't in there it could mean two things. I forgot or I didn't  think that you deserved a spot there. If you ask why you aren't there  I'll likely just say that I forgot, but that might or might not be  true. When people put stuff in AIM profiles especially, there is a  limitted space and therefore not EVERYONE makes it in. Sorry, maybe you  didn't make the cut.      like when i fell under the weight of a schoolboy crush   started carrying her books and   doing lots of drugs   I almost forgot who i was   but came to my   senses     ... more Bright Eyes. Anyway, don't be upset if you didn't make  it in someone's profile, it's not the end of the world and it's not  worth crying over.     If you're not there and you bug me to put you in, oh, I should interrupt. I'm saying stuff like "bug  me " and "maybe  I   forgot", I'm just speaking in general terms using myself as an example.  If you aren't in there and you bug me to put you in, I'll likely do it  but it won't mean much because it's supposed to be spontaneous. If  you're forcing me to say something about you then it won't have the  same meaning to it. So if I say something like "put something in that  fits me" and you end up just being like "Andrew: is cool" and I'm like  "you asshole, that's all you could say?" anyway, if that's the case, I  should be shot. Don't do this or I just might shoot you too. But yeah, on that note, since I can't think of a real hurt proof way of doing any sort of shoutout type thing, I'm just gonna leave it there. We'll see where it goes in the future.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Well, I feel it my civic duty once again to provide some interesting  reading/viewing material. I realized today that I haven't done much in  terms of personal updates lately. As in, my life hasn't been broadcast  as much as usual. Instead I'm using this as a tool to entertain myself  and anyone that takes the time to read, remember, it's people like you  who make me write this. Then again, maybe I have no audience and I'm  just wasting my time.     So, who remembers watching Saturday Night Live and they'd have cartoons  and such. One of them was called "The Ambiguously Gay Duo". The  cartoon's protagonists were Ace and Gary who drove a car shaped like  the picture in the caption contest, more or less and frequenly stopped  at "the greasy pole", a local gay club, to do investigations. Well, the   urlLink Ambiguously Gay Duo are back.  That's right, and Ace and Gary are long retired and giving their spots up to Kerry and Edwards.    I'm actually going to spend the rest of this entry walking you through a  conversation I'm having as we speak. Or actually the part I'm gonna  show you is over. Yeah.     So I got up this morning and checked my AIM messages, as usual, and see this.       (10:34:57)    Chris Clark:  i owe you a beating son     So I wasn't quite sure what to make of that, needless to say, it's  Chris Clark, so I didn't start trembling or anything like that, though  he does have a strong right arm. He wasn't logged on when I got the  message so I waited until tonight to find out what was up.              CrzyLynk:     why do you owe me a beating?       CrzyLynk:     son    I'm still joking around here, not really thinking much of it.               Chris Clark:     what did you do to my car       Chris Clark:     involving aerosols    Fuck, we sprayed his whole car with axe. Does that do anything to the paint?  Did I just ruin my ex-proctor's car? Maybe he didn't know what was  going on.             CrzyLynk:     ?    I play dumb, hoping it works. There's a pause. It's not working.             CrzyLynk:     sprayed axe on the driver's side window    Note I didn't say "entire car" just said "driver's side window". Sorry Chris, it was the WHOLE car. :-P                             Chris Clark:     yeah that one         CrzyLynk:     why?         CrzyLynk:     if there is damage let me know       CrzyLynk:     is there?    Yeah, I think I got nervous. I was thinking that I had somehow eroded the  paint away. I mean, who really knows what's in axe anyway. And taht Axe  Effect could do any number of things not related to attracting women  (btw, I don't think it works. they lied to me).             Chris Clark:     no just on principle       Chris Clark:     a beating for spraying a car with that shit    *Deep Breath* so it was all for nothing. No damage no nothing. Good.             CrzyLynk:      :)      CrzyLynk:     phew, you had me thinking i dissolved paint or something       CrzyLynk:     fine, if you can beat me up then go ahead  I'm glad it all worked out.     I kinda enjoyed picking the conversation apart like that. I'm also sad  to end this entry. I could go on forever, but all good things must come  to an end. So until next time, this is Andrew. Stay tuned for m next  entry, the way things are going it could be in 5 minutes.

       While I just posted the first ever Caption Contest I'm not quite satisfied for the night. There's so much to be seen online and hence so much for me to show you. First off, in my last entry I used the phrase "monkey balls" and it struck me, "Andrew, you've never seen monkey balls, how would you know anything about them?" So I set out on a bold and daring journey to find monkey balls. Warning, what you are about to see is both shocking and disturbing. Viewer descretion is advised.      Update (7/18/04): Just to let you know... here's some of the positive feedback I got for this entry.     Rachel's profile:  Dude. Just because you say the phrase "monkey balls," doesn't mean you have to know what they look like. Those kind of visuals just aren't nessicary.   (      urlLink See results.    A biproduct of my investigation was this sign in front of a Balinese temple. This sign really exists.         And I took the caption out, cause apparently Steffie was offended, sorry Steff.   But that aside. I've begun to realize that this journal, or blog as I guess it realls is supposed to be called, could turn into something. Not something big, but something that people check.   I don't mind collecting crap from all over the internet to post here. It's the fact that that saves the reader the trouble of finding that crap themselves.      But see, I was just told my a wonderful Ms. Elsie that my website is nothing but   "    a bunch of crazy people's writing and creepy pictures ". Thanks a lot, it's good to know people care. Whatever, crazy people's writing is entertaining and creepy pictures also do serve an entertainment purpose.   Regardless of that, I have something I'd like to share. A while back a 11 year old girl was harassing a friend of mine online so I harassed her back, not knowing she was 11 at the time. Then her older sister IMed me to tell me that I was harassing an 11 year old. I felt bad and as though the least I could do was leave her on my buddy list for the time. Well, recently she had be talk to a guy she liked just to find some stuff out, and now HE'S IMing me. It's all taken care of, both of them are blocked. In fact, all the 11 year old's that used to talk to me have now been blocked once and for all. But the fact of the matter is, yesterday in conversation Alex, the 11 year old guy, said something hilarious and I'd like to share it with you.       (22:11:48)  Alex:      a 16 yr old wants to fuck me but im going to wait cuz im im um a little little if you catch my drift      (22:12:03)  Alex:       lol dont tell ne1                      But the fact of the matter is, that's hilarious, so I have to tell everyone and anyone. Also, he has no way of seeing hthis and no one he's associated with has a way of seeing this, so there is no harm done is putting it there. Plus, it's just plain "fall over laughing" hilarious. But the kid has my respect, it takes a lot of balls to admit that one doesn't really have... a lot of balls, and other such things.   In conclusion, you know what monkey balls look like, you know the rules on bleeding women and temples, and you know that Alex the 11 year old from Maryland has a small penis. What more could you want?

      I've been scanning blogs recently, and have come up with a few ideas that I might redefine so as to not be stealing them. One such idea is the notion of a "Caption Conest" that occurs weekly. Well, that's exactly what this is. Every Thursday night I'll post a picture and you can send your "captions" to me&nbsp;&nbsp;via  urlLink e-mail &nbsp;or leave them as comments to this entry. Either way, this could be interesting or it could suck monkey balls. It's up to you.  &nbsp;   Here's this weeks picture.      &nbsp;  Good luck!  &nbsp;  -Andrew

      Hey everyone... I've discovered/re-discovered some very interesting websites. I'm going to do a few quotes, just because it isn't worth it to read the entire website at either one.   urlLink Dolphin Sex  This website was created by someone who has a love for dolphins so passionate "that the person (and the animal) involved have no objections to expressing their affection for each other in the sexual fashion." A series of FAQ's about sex with dolphins follows his brief introduction.  ...Q2) How do I know if a dolphin wants to have sex?  A2) There are various ways a dolphin has of showing that she or he is interested in sex.  Males are probably the easiest to detect. They will swim around, sporting an erection (anywhere between 10 to 14 inches long for a Bottle-nose), and will have no bones about swimming up to you and placing their member within reach of your hand. If you are in the water, they may rub it along any part of your body, or wrap it around your wrist or ankle. (Dolphin males have a prehensile penis. They can wrap it around objects, and carry them as such.)...  Beware the 14 inch dolphin dick as it has grabbing power.    ...Q3) What do I do if a dolphin wants to mate with me?  A3) Accept, if possible! I will go through the steps involved with males and females...  WARNING! In the considerations of safety, you should NEVER let a male dolphin attempt anal sex with you. The Bottle-nose dolphin member is around 12 inches, very muscular, and the thrusting and the force of ejaculation (A male can come as far as 14 feet) would cause serious internal injuries, resulting in peritonitus and possible death. Unless you are the masochistic type, you will have a hard time explaining your predicament to the doctors in the emergency ward....  Excuse me, doctor? I sorta slipped and fell on the portable phone while I was naked. *shudders* 14 feet is darned far.   ...always spend time with them afterwards. Cuddle them, rub them, talk to them and most importantly, show them you love them. This is essential, as it helps to strengthen the bond between you. Like a way of saying that this wasn't just a one-night fling. The dolphins appreciate it, and they will want your company more the next time you visit them...  This is getting a little frightening. I'd be like "take that you half-mammal" and run on the beach and make fun of the dolphin for screwing a human.   Q6) Where can I find a dolphin to mate with?  A6) Aquariums are a bad choice, for many reasons. Too public, the dolphins are not in their natural habitat, night visits are impossible, etc etc... some may have external enclosures, which may be accessible, but that is no guarantee. Best thing sometimes is to find a beach or a cove that the dolphins frequent. It takes time to develop a relationship with a dolphin to the point where they will let you mate with them (although some have been as quick as 3 days to acclimatize). Gaining their trust takes time, and you need to visit frequently. This is impossible for some people, I understand, but it is the best way. Sometimes you just need to be in the right place at the right time. I have been extremely lucky on two occasions with wild dolphins, and my current mate is a dolphin who lives in the harbor of my resident city.  Well, I hope this is of use to whoever is interested. One final note. You should love a dolphin, not because of the sexual relief they can provide, but because they are a unique animal, one of the few wild animals that seek the company of man by their own initiative. This is special. Do not abuse it.  That's the last real section from this website. To re-cap, this guy is freaking weird. He also has a section on geese, that's also quite weird; however, it is far less interesting so I'm not going to quote it.   Now, sex with dolphins is fun, but let's take a trip into the minds of Gummy Bears as it relates to sexual desires.    urlLink The Sexual Fantasies of Gummy Bears  This site is far more interesting and worth reading in it's entiretly, as it was written to be funny not to give people info on screwing zoo exhibits. I'm sure you're about to read the whole thing, but I'll still include a quote or two.  AHHHHHH... okay, so I was looking for a quote but still had the dolphin sex thing open... and there's a section on necrophelia...    AHHHHHHHH!!!!!      Sometimes the corpse is too fragile to be moved; in that case make it fast. Or just break off the head, hand or lower torso and take it with you for added convenience.  *shudders*   People are generally not understanding of the necrophiliac lifestyle, so it will probably be a long time before we can come out of the closet.  And they wonder why? *shudders again*   back to  GUMMY BEARS    A quote... A quote... and I promise it gets better. I mean, how could it get worse after that? But still, it gets better.   Most attempts at explanation (brought forth in gushing tones) indicate that gummy bears are extremely easy to impress: "he helped me out of the bag" - "he left me my bag" - "he was like a bag to me." Interestingly gummy bears who had participated in experiments conducted by physicists as opposed to psychologists never reported any erotic interest in their experimenters.  See... that's almost cute... gummy bears have crushes on phychologists.   One repeatedly encounters bear fantasy scenarios including toasters, microwaves and ovens, all just waiting to heat up the lascivious little bears. The bears do not seem to be aware that such games can end in death. We stand back aghast as more and more gummy bears openly admit "I think M. Kelani is sexy".   M. Kelani is a brutal torturer of Gummy Bears. You can see his work  urlLink here    Gummy bears don't like to talk about it, but it is true: Due to their limited repertoire of  communicative and expressive behavior – paired with certain anatomic handicaps – bears are only able to mate in one position. Almost all of them, however, read Vatsyayana`s Gummy Sutra (Figure 1). No wonder things are bound not to work out.     Figure 1   This report has a rather strong conclusion.  The results of Friday`s (1997) studies presented here provide a whole line of approaches for future research: Why do gummy bears refuse adult web site membership (even free membership) so often? Why does the predisposition to scribble frivolous messages on scraps of bag, evident in all gummy bears, so seldom manifest itself in behavior? Why have gummy bears not yet appeared in any talkshows – after all, they would have a good deal to talk about.    I also discovered a site dedicated to the old cartoon  urlLink Thundercats.    Thunder... Thunder ...THUNDER... THUNDERCATS HOOOOO!    I have to go to bed, I'm tired and I'm helping Ali move tomorrow.

      and isn't that the truth  Rachel was nice enough to dig up too many picutres. Some of them sucked, some were nice. Nobody wants pictures that suck so they didn't make it in here. Either way, thanks Rachel and yeah... these are really pointless pictures.         Kitten slavery, this must be stopped. I'm gonna be doing a sit-in in my room to try and stop  things. Stop by and protest with me, but I'll likely just be wasting away online.       I wish cats just stopped growing so they'd stay kittens forever. Meh, oh well.       Totally some "Puss In Boots" action going on.        "rachel1580:  ohhhhh they're FRIENDS!" That says it all.       I'd honestly shoot myself.    Anyway... I don't know how many I posted. There were 17 total. So you know how many i didn't post i guess. But yeah... that was one big waste of time. I'm off. Adios.

      We will safely leave the third one out of this discussion. Though I miss Chermerson, Jem Dawg, Jemerson, and all those other great names we had for the guy. Physics will suck balls, but atleast it will sucks balls with force and velocity.  Anyway... the real matter at hand. I was at the mall today seeing a movie with Rachel (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban). While at the mall I thought I'd double up on efficiency and get a haircut too. In fact, I got them all cut. (admit it, you were expecting that joke) So I got my haircut, and it doesn't look that bad. I also got a chance to chill w/ Rachel which I haven't done in a while, until now.  So haircuts aside, what has made my day cool? Oh, I'll tell ya. Well, this isn't the coolest part, and it's not even that cool. I got my website up, so it's official. You can see it  urlLink here , if you want. It's a work in progress, especially now that it's an actual website.  My day rocked, and tomorrow might just rock even more. I think I'm seeing a movie with Kinga and doing reporting for the newspaper. It  could  end up rocking more, or it could end up rocking less, but it'll still rock.  I'm out like Michael J. Fox in a Jenga tournament. -Andrew

      Well, when I wrote the title I intended on including more pictures. But I've already put in a bunch for a relatively short period of time. Hm... the only exception to me not putting in pictures is if I can dig up some from my DA prom. Let's see...  Oh, are you ever in luck...    So that would be Saira, myself, and Glyn. We had just walked in and I was already receiving the "pimp" comments (even from teachers). For those of you that aren't aware, Saira and Glyn were my prom dates to the Deerfield prom.    The first thing you might notice when you look at this is "Andrew isn't there". Brilliant observation. So you may ask why do I even care about this picture? Good question. I don't. Just kidding. Um... From left to right: Spencer and Lily, Rachel and Alex, Laura, and Elsie.   Notice how the vibe of "I'm better than you" is being emitted from Alex. In fact, he is so superior that he made a new screen name and decided to use the setting so that only those on his buddy list could contact him. He then proceeded to have a much smaller buddy list and I didn't make the cut. What a selfish bastard. But Rachel remains cool, and defensive by nature. Since it is her boyfriend I'm bashing.     Back to the important stuff, me. Note: if that's not pimping it, idk what is. Once again, from left to right: Saira, me, Glyn, Steffie, and Caitlin.  So prom moved into the dining hall, which you might assume was kinda low quality, but it totally wasn't. Thanks to the help of Glyn (and Saira?) and many others the dining hall was transformed into something cool.    I couldn't have asked for a better table. It's gonna be hard to do the from left to right thing here but I'll do my best. Here it is: Ameer and Lindsay, Spencer (Speneer) and Lily, Anthony and Mollie, and Glyn and I. Saira took the picture.    And uh... a happy mid-prom picture. Mollie. Glyn. Saira. End of story.  Oh, the memories. It was a good night.

      So... Sharrissa and Jessie are the only people that are really going to understand the title, but that's okay.  Anyway... Photobucket must have taken midol while I was asleep cause it's actually working fine now. So that means, picture time!    So I had a different picture of Joanna in here, but she didn't quite like it. So I dug this up, and I actually like this one a little better. It's a good picture.      Sometimes I'm retarded. Sometimes I'm not. You can decide for yourself if this was one of those times.    That'd be Rocco and Jackie to those of you who don't know them. They've been going out for like 2 years.(i think?) I think this may have been from before they were going out.     So yeah... this was from a bowling trip a whlie ago. Yours truly is drinking the cold beverage while Angela is at the computer-thingy. Mary is in the blue hat and Joanna is in the red shirt. I think in the background you'll see Katherine in gray and Heather in black.  So... that's all for now. I'll be back with a vengeance after I shower and do some work.

      Seeing as how Amherst is just about as land locked as possible, I spent very little time at the beach.  Instead, I made use of our lovely Indian (native american, same difference) neighbors and spent the afternoon at Mohegan Sun. I've never been there before so it was a new experience.  Inside was slightly magical. In the sense that everything was so well designed that it felt like I was at Disney World or something like that. Since I'm not 21 I can't actually gamble, so I spent my time in the arcade. The exchange rate there is about 25 cents to 7 tickets and 7 tickets buys about 7 cents worth of useless crap. So I went in and exchanged 20.00 for about, hell, I'm not gonna do math now, I just got a lot of useless crap that didn't really equal the amount of money I'd paid.    I wish I had pictures to post. I think I'm going to actually look for some now and hope I'm lucky. Now to test that luck...   okay... i'm having shit for luck cause photobucket is crashing... yay for that  i'll figure something out later

      My three best friends, or atleast some kick-ass breakfast cereal elves.  I'm feeling fine, but I'm feeling as though I'd like to make an entry with some picture, but I lack the motivation.  Until the motivation comes to me I will just copy and paste something from my "website".     >  That would be Miranda and some kid flashing the camera at some New Year's party. I wasn't there, but she told me.     What does that transfer to in inches? Do I make the cut?       Ah, the lovely Natalia Stickle. LOL. Good times. And stay cool. The second one is actually  pretty  good, atleast    I    think so.     I can't tell. Does she look pissed or just uninterested? Anywho, I'm so glad things are working out between her and I. They weren't for the longest time.     I think that's Angela, wait, no, it's Katherine (idk which of the freaking million different ways to spell that name is hers, so we'll settle for Katherine). This came from the church website so that means Jesse took it. Lol, way to take an obvious picture of JUST her ass. Rock on.     And where would we be without a picture of Kinga. Wow, I would put on the other one I have of her but she made me promise not to. :)     I think I've used this more then once to unpiss people at me. It works, seriously. And just cause I used it, that doesn't make it insincere. This is totally like the "lets be friends" picture.      And why not end on a rather freaky note.    That would be Miranda's Eye. I remember the first time I saw that I was convinced it was something else, then I saw it was titled "Miranda's Eye" and I had a good laugh at how dumb I was.

      Instead of getting the sleep that I both need and deserve, I'm going to do some work that needs to be done anyway. I'm going to type out my college visiting schedule, which means little to nothing to any reader, but then again, most of this stuff means little to nothing.  July 26- 9:30 AM --> Interview at  urlLink Grove City College  10:30 AM --> Take campus tour of  urlLink Grove City College   Note: This is a small Christian College north of Pittsburg. Naomi says it's too small. I'll make my own assumptions when i see it.   Afternoon --> Drive to Lewisburg, PA  July 27- 9:00 AM --> Campus Tour of  urlLink Bucknell University   Note: This lasts 2 hours. It's been rated "seventeenth most conservative in the country" and I'm not sure if that's good or bad. I'm sure my dad likes it.  11:00 AM - 2:00 PM -- Drive to Easton, PA 2:00 PM --> Information session at  urlLink Lafayette College  3:15 PM --> Campus tour of  urlLink Lafayette College   Note: The drive between these two schools will be tight. I also don't have much to say in regards to Lafayette. It looks like a nice school.  Afternoon --> Drive to Philadelphia  July 28- 10:00 AM --> Info Session at  urlLink University of Pennsylvania  11:00 AM --> Tour at  urlLink University of Pennsylvania   I think UPenn counts as an Ivy so I count as not getting in, maybe not even applying. Regardless, it's on the way so it's worth a stop.  12:00 PM - 1:00 PM --> Drive to Villanova 1:00 PM --> Group presentation at  urlLink Villanova University  2:00 PM --> Campus Tour of  urlLink Villanova University   I know nothing about Villanova, but this is the time to learn.  Afternoon --> Drive to Annapolis, MD   July 29- 9:00 AM --> Visit  urlLink St. John's College   This is supposed to be an interesting place. Very different, or so I hear. Is Annapolis close to Bethesda? Because I suppose then I could pay Natalia a visit,  if she's not too busy.   Afternoon --> Drive to Georgetown  I had hoped to see some people I met at Columbia who live nearby. I'm not sure what will be happening though. I think that Dede will be gone. I'm not sure about Ben, and Nick seemed to think he'd be in New Mexico.   July 30- 9:00 AM --> Info Session at  urlLink Georgetown University , followed by a tour  I think this made it's way into my 'reach' category. Dede said I'd love the school so who knows, it's definitely still an "option".   July 31- All day --> Rest. I'm not sure if we'll be resting in Georgetown or if we will go to Williamsburg and chill there. As if to say that when my dad and I relax it counts as "chilling". Dispatch's FINAL concert is today in Boston. It's also free, unfortunately I'm not.  August 1- All day --> Drive to Williamsburg if we're not already there. If we're there then it's time to chill out, or rest, yeah, definitely rest.  August 2- 10:00 AM --> Info session and tour at  urlLink The College of William and Mary  Sometime --> Interview at  urlLink The College of William and Mary   If it were not for this college I would be able to make it back for the Dispatch concert. Maybe that's something to keep in mind.    And so... I'm tired, spent, tired... I just said that. I'm going to bed. I'll find motels for the trip later. Any suggestions on how to go about finding them would be appreciated.  Oh, and it's telling me this post has HTML errors but I think it's lying. Either way I'm posting it w/o caring. Tell me if some of the links don't work.

      It's proven. Just today at MIT a group of students had the first proveable results of male PMS. They tested on over a thousand men aged 20-75 and the results spoke for themselves.  Okay, that's BS, but I'm sure that male PMS exists. My dad gets it every once in a while and is actually experiencing it now.  He gets so that he has to find something to complain about, and it's just generally unpleasant around the house. Nothing is wrong, or atleast nothing is any more wrong than usual, but all of a sudden anything wrong seems like the end of the world.  The consequences of this are that I have to be on my toes for the next week, making sure I don't f* up anything, and I know that's not going to happen. Only a miracle would allow for that.  Things I should do this week:  -Plan housing for the college trip -Spend more time doing journalism stuff -Go camping with my dad (that'll shut him up, just kidding, I like camping with him, as much as you people may be surprised)  Things I should NOT do this week:  -Get caught playing computer games or talking online (i should maintain the illusion that I don't spend time on my computer) -Be around the house too much -Talk smack to the parents -Impregnate the cat, or anything -and the list goes on...

      I don't have much to say, and to take long to say it would be a waste.  I had fun tonight. I didn't do much, but what I did was fun. I sas Spiderman 2 and on the drive home from the movies I listened to a CD that at first reminded me of Kathryn. Not Kathryn the cheating whore but the Kathryn the girl that flashed me before we even went out (I guess I should have expected what she did.). I was listening to the same CD the night she and I walked back to Deerfield from the center of Greenfield. I miss the part of her that I saw that night but what I saw wasn't real.  Anyway, then another song on the CD reminded me of Columbia, but specifically of Grace, and then the obvious next step it reminded me of Allison. They were great girls, and my memories of them have become some of my good friends, as lame as that sounds.  There is more to say, but that's where I'll leave it for now.         You use to laugh under the covers, maybe not so often now.

      How fitting with the weather. The day began bright and sunny, and now it's thundering but not raining.  I had a good start to the day. A productive morning some might say. I did an interview for the Sentinel and then picked up a copy of this week's paper. I found a typo in the title of my article but it didn't bother me because I was feeling really good.  Things can change in a second.  I got an e-mail from my dad saying that we could not change the dates of my trip. He is within his rights to say this, because he's already alerted all the important people that he'll need that time off. I wish for one fucking second he coudln't be so on top of everything. I mean, it's been 2 days and he's already told everyone.  Since we can't change dates I won't be able to do a few things. First, I won't be able to see any of my friends from down in VA because they will all be gone while I'm visiting. Secondly, I won't be able to go to the LAST Dispatch concert in Boston on the 31st.  I hadn't planned on going until Jessie told me she might be able to go. This blows. I want to go more than anything now, just because it would be fun. Why couldn't I have thought things through before planning all of this?  I talked to Rachel, to try and get her to cheer me up. She did her job as a friend, and I felt better for a few minutes. The happy feeling didn't last, and now I'm back where I started.  And the sky will open up at any second.
