       Wow. The RNC put together  urlLink an excellent video of John Kerry and his many flip-flops  Come on, now. How do you defend this? Before W was even President, Kerry stated Saddam was a threat. I respect him for that. But a few years and a presidential race later, he waffles all over the place to appeal to voters. And the Hate Bush crowd could care less about his inconsistency, because they have it in their minds that anyone would be a better president than Dubya. But to those who will use their minds in deciding the next president, consider this infamous Kerry quote for a sec: 
 I actually did vote for the $87 billion...before I voted against it. 
 Wha-wha-WHAT?

       Sean Hannity is calling it the Reinvention Convention. The GOP is calling it  urlLink Dems Extreme Makeover . This convention is basically comprised of the far left, and they are trying to appear moderate to appeal to the swing voters. Al Gore didn't yell, Howard Dean didn't go YEEEEEEAH!, and Ted Kennedy didn't show up drunk.

       John Kerry loves talking to middle class workers. And hey, he's a Democrat. They're the party for the working class, right? I mean, John Kerry can relate to these guys, all the while  urlLink he cruises around in his Rolls-Royce . A GM auto worker from Michigan said it best: 
 That's an insult to the auto worker, it's an insult to the American worker, it's an insult to mainstream America. It also shows who he's really in touch with: his European, elitist French friends and not Americans like me. A Rolls-Royce, for cryin' out loud. 
 Boy, I'm so glad John Kerry knows what's best for middle America. Hey, anyone who marries an heiress to the Heinz fortune, which is worth a half billion dollars, knows what the heart of America needs. Vote John Kerry!

        urlLink Clear Channel Communications sued Howard Stern  for not complying with FCC indecency rules. I am against censorship like this. If I had a kid, I wouldn't let him listen to Stern, but I would have the responsibility to make sure he wasn't. The government should not be a babysitter. The less government, the better. 

 Yet, Howard Stern daily tells his listeners not to vote for Bush. Stern has gone crazy. How is George Bush involved in this? Aren't Republicans for free speech? Bush is not doing this, it's the FCC and Dems like Tipper Gore. Stern is gearing his anger toward the wrong person and party. Stern considers himself a libertarian, yet he will be voting for John Kerry. Makes no sense to me.

        urlLink The 9/11 commission veered from saying the WTC attacks could have been prevented . Hmm, I know how it could have been prevented.  urlLink Bill Clinton could have kept our national defense strong  while he was in office. And, he could have gone after al Qaeda a little more forcefully after the first WTC attack in 1993. "But what about Bush, why didn't he do anything?" Because he didn't have time. And there were intelligence failures. I'm not placing the blame on Clinton, but he decided national security was not a very big deal.

       I'm tired of hearing the anti-war left say Bush manipulated intelligence to gain support for the war in Iraq. Literally EVERYONE in Washington thought Saddam Hussein contained nuclear weapons, from George Bush to Hillary Clinton to John Kerry. Other countries thought the same. Bush relied on the same intelligence as everyone else to come to the conclusion that Hussein possessed WMDs. 

  Update : Wait, I'm not done. I have a question for the "Bush Lied" crowd. On one hand you accuse Bush of deceitfully putting together this whole plan to get us to go to war with Iraq. But, you also accuse him of being a moron. I'm confused. How can one be a conspiracy theorist and a moron at the same time? Make up your mind. Which one is he?

        urlLink Linda Ronstadt got booed  for trying to talk politics at a performance at the Aladdin hotel-casino in Las Vegas. She urged everyone there to go see  Fahrenheit 9/11  and she got what she deserved. And better yet, Aladdin President Bill Timmins kicked her out. 

 The American people don't want to hear politics from know-nothing celebrities. They want to hear from people  in  politics and from people in the media. Like my dawg  urlLink Sean Hannity . And yes, there are intelligent liberals, but most Hollywood celebrities do not fall in that category. Take Ronstadt for example. What was so intelligent about what she said? Anyone who still takes Michael Moore seriously at this point in his career is obviously ignorant. Literally every work of Moore's has been debunked time and time again. Hell, even  urlLink a 17-year old girl picked apart  F-9/11  . 
 

  Update : The guys over at  urlLink Moorewatch  expressed my thoughts exactly: 
 What the hell is it with these self-important celebrities that makes them think that everyone wants to hear their political views at every possible opportunity?  If I pay to go see Linda Ronstadt Iâ€™m paying to hear her sing and entertain me, not shove her left-wing political beliefs down my throat.  Good for the Aladdin for telling her to go pound sand...  
The unmitigated hubris and narcissism of celebrities is just astonishing sometimes, especially some washed-up has-been like Linda Ronstadt. 

 Oh, and I found this comment in the Moorewatch entry, which should silence certain Hollywood sympathizers out there: 
 Do you know what the first Amendment guarantees?  It guarantees that you will be free from government interference in your speech.  It does not say that the Aladdin Casino will not interfere with your speech.  The Aladdin has just as much freedom to send the message that they will not tolerate their stage being used to utter personal political beliefs.

       John Kerry spoke at an NAACP Convention Thursday,  urlLink praising chairman Julian Bond : 
 
Julian Bond sent electricity through this country when he burst on the scene when he was a young man. I remember watching him set an example for our country, and he's still setting an example for our country. He is eloquent. He is powerful.
 

 Good for Bond for fighting the civil rights battle, but just one month ago he compared Republicans to terrorists. The NAACP is no longer about black rights. It's about hatemongering and supporting the Democratic party. This organization is supposed to be nonpartisan. 

 George Bush was invited to speak at an NAACP event, but he turned it down. Can you blame him? He spoke to them in 2000, and  since then,  urlLink the NAACP has done nothing but disrespect the president . 

 How dare you Mr. Bush! You racist!

       I can't stand war protesters. They do nothing but undermine the efforts of our military. Without the brave men and women in the Armed Forces, we wouldn't have the freedom to protest. I think some of these sick people should think of that before they  urlLink say stuff like they did to Jason Gilson . 

 Gilson is a veteran who served in Iraq. He came home recently after being disabled in an ambush. He marched in a Fourth of July parade, and he was greeted with the sounds of boos and screams of "Murderer!" and "Baby killer!". This is pitiful. People like Jason Gilson honorably serve their country for us to be free and some people treat him like this. Here is a quote from a letter Gilson sent from Iraq: I really miss being in the states. Some of the American public have no idea how much freedom costs and who the people are that pay that awful price. I think sometimes people just see us as nameless and faceless and not really as humans. ... A good portion of us are actually scared that when we come home, for those of us who make it back, that there will be protesters waiting for us and that is scary. And there were protesters waiting for him.

       John Edwards has been in the Senate for only five years, and before that, he was a trial lawyer who sued hospitals when babies were killed even though their deaths were inevitable. Edwards is too young to have such a prominent position. If something were to happen to John Kerry, Edwards would take over as president. We don't need a "boy wonder" running the White House...

       The more I read about some of the idiots in Hollywood, the less I want to go see their movies and buy their music. 

 Someone who I definitely won't be giving any money to is Whoopi Goldberg, an anti-American moron who talks about how stupid Republicans are every time she gets the chance. At a Kerry-Edwards fund raiser Thursday,  urlLink Goldberg bashed the Bush administration , which is an international sport these days. Her comments were unintelligent, crude, and uncalled for. And supposedly, John Kerry and John Edwards were seen laughing at her ridiculous comments. 

 Others who made am-Bushes were Jessica Lange and Chevy Chase (hey Chevy, what happened to your career?). Make sure to  urlLink check out the article  to read what they had to say.

       If you get the time check out this new band called  urlLink The Right Brothers . I listened to Hey Hollywood a long time ago, but don't remember it too well. It's about the left wing bias of Hollywood celebs. I haven't listened to these songs yet, but they are anti-left and pro-military. And it's good ol' country music! 

 The album costs $12. There's so much stuff I want to buy right now and so little money to spend.

 I know it's not a very important issue. And they are not gay with each other. But it's funny. And heck, John Kerry will get his hands on anybody worth millions.

       As most of you know, Michael Moore recently came out with his newest craptastic lie-fest, to quote the guys at  urlLink Moorewatch . It is called  Fahrenheit 9/11 , and it is a movie filled with lies, exaggerations, and deception. I know this for a fact because I saw the movie. I downloaded it off the internet, mind you, so as to not contribute a single penny to the 350-pound "little guy" known as Michael Moore. 

 If you want to download F-9/11 to see what it's all about, go  urlLink here .
 Note : You need a BitTorrent client to download from the above site.

 Now, for the point of this entry. If you want the truth about Michael Moore, you can just browse the internet for sites that question Moore and his works. There are plenty. But the first book that is taking on Michael Moore has just come out, and it is called  urlLink  Michael Moore is a Big Fat Stupid White Man  . I have yet to get a copy of this book, but I plan on ordering it soon. I am sure it will be a great read. Supposedly, the authors really did their homework. And I am sure they did.

       Welcome to the Right Wing of Cyberspace. Here I will post frequently about current political issues and try to incite some dissenting opinions among viewers. Anyone is free to post comments, but please limit the profanity and ignorance. I am a Republican and I will be biased just so you know. This is not a "balanced" blog, it is right wing, hence the name. But liberals are welcome and we will take you seriously and more often than not prove you wrong. So let the blogging begin!

       I am tired of the anti-Bush rhetoric. It's everywhere. And there are still 80-some days until Bush's reelection. After 9/11, like 99% of the U.S. was behind the president. Now it's about 45%. All because of the Iraq war. Excuse me if removing an evil regime was wrong to do. 

 All the Bush-haters admit the world is a better place without Saddam in power. So why does everyone hate the president so much? Why does everyone hate making sacrifices to preserve freedom? Yes, 900 Americans have died. But it is the price we pay for freedom. We have to defend ourselves. We are the protectors of peace and freedom for the whole world. Are we going to bend over and take it in the ass like France? Not under President Bush. But all the liberal hippies want peace, not war. Peace you shall have as a result of this war. And if you have a problem with President Bush, I implore you to reconsider. 

 We will not waver; we will not tire; we will not falter; and we will not fail. Peace and freedom will prevail.

 Oh, how I can't wait until Bush is reelected in Novemeber. I will laugh in every Kerry supporter's face.
