       Placebo – Nancy boy    I read some reviews of Sting’s book  Broken Music  on Amazon.com, and I was a bit surprised to see that almost every single reviewer gave the book 3 or less stars (out of five). I love the book! Sure, it might be a bit heavy, filled with words that no one uses in the daily life, but that’s just the type of person Sting is. He uses the words he needs to express himself, and to make the readers experience more believable. I would recommend you to check out the book as soon as possible!       When I’ve finished it, I’m starting on  Lolita . My copy of the book has a very amusing story behind it: I spent all my shopping days in England looking for the book. But no one had it in stock. Not even Barter Books! And on the second last day, we went to Metro Centre, and there, right before I was about to leave HMV, it was sitting there on the shelf, with a price tag saying £2.99! How cool is that? So I went over to it, grabbed it, and paid for it.    I think Sylvia’s gift will arrive tomorrow, so I’ll go pick it up, and then go over to Lars’, because he wanted to watch  Lost in Translation , so I offered to lend him my DVD, and watch it together with him. Yay. So, loads of fun going on tomorrow.    Last night, while talking with Lars on MSN, I realized that I won’t be going to band camp again till I’m 19! And that’s kind of sad, because I really wanted to go this year, but I couldn’t, and I’d totally forgotten about my exchange year next year. I’m not saying that I’d rather go to band camp than to the US, I’m just saying that I’m gonna miss it. I really hope I’ll get to play in some kind of band in America.

       Bruce Springsteen – Atlantic city     So, Sylvia and me are having a very educational chat about what type of swear words we use. I use stuff like ‘poop’ and ‘pee’, while she uses ‘damn’, and ‘crap’. Yup. In case you were wondering.  I watched ‘The Butterfly Effect’ yesterday, together with Susie (aka my kinder-garden home girl). It’s a truly amazing movie, and I loved it. I didn’t really think that Ashton Kutcher could do such a serious part (no offence, Ashton), but it turns out that he’s not just some hormone-sweetheart-celebrity boy, he’s an actual actor. Yay for him.  I was planning on renting another movie tonight, but that’s as far it got (to the planning). So I guess I’m gonna strap myself to the sofa, and watch some quality Saturday night television till I drop. Also gonna consume some unhealthy amounts of crisps, candy and Pepsi. Gotta have Pepsi, right?  It’s so damn hot! It’s like, 30ºC outside, and about the same inside. I had to sleep with a pony tail last night, because my hair was so warm… And I also had to have my bedroom window wide open, and my door, and the terrace door on the other side of the loft was also wide open.  Obsession of the moment:  Tara MacClay’s song in ‘Once more with feeling’. Also: her dress in that episode. Amber Benson rocks!        Looking wicked good singing in that dress, right? Wish I had one just like it...

       (in my head) Michelle Branch – Breathe    Why would anyone set up a camera, and videotape themselves typing on a computer keyboard? To erase some very embarrassing clips from the tape? Yes, that might be one option. Because they are extremely self-observed? Might be an option, but highly unlikely. Because they’re bored? Sure, that could be it. Now, you might ask yourself, why is she asking these strange questions? I have no idea.  Spent a very pleasant evening with my kinder garden-home girl (gotta love that word, right?), watching TV and a movie. She’s the first person to agree with me on the whole England-matter, which I will not bring up again.  Anyways, the town’s very quiet, and extremely hot these days, and I can hardly sleep at night, so I spent my nightly hours here, in front of dear old ‘Puter, typing away like a slayer in a graveyard (my metaphor! I made that up just now!).   I mean, what’s the point of lying in bed, twisting and turning till you’re so exhausted you fall asleep, just to wake up half an hour later, to flip your extremely hot duvet, or to take off your nightgown, and slip on a top, or to open the window even more, or to just lay awake in bed again? Can’t really see the point in that, but that’s what I’ll be doing in a little while.

      A lonely, petit girl, sitting in her room, dressed in casual slacks, like she always did when she had a day off. Her fingers were pounding the black keys of her computer-keyboard, and her eyes were fixed on the screen as she typed away. Little drops of water slid down her forearms, where her wet shower-hair came in contact with it. She raised her right hand, and threw it back, behind her shoulder.  The sound of the birds outside filled the silent room, and the dull breeze was beginning to lower the hot temperature. She’s been sitting there all afternoon, all by herself, like she usually did. She didn’t mind being alone. She kind of enjoyed it, not having to worry about everyone being okay, and not bored, and satisfied. She enjoyed the natural silence, the time by herself, not having to dress up to be someone she wasn’t.  She scratched her eye, and stopped typing for a second, and looked up to listen. There were sirens sounding clear and far away. It was probably an ambulance. She’s never been able to tell the difference. Not that she’d ever tried.

      Oh god… I just want to go back to school, make new friends, learn something, and be happy. I wanna grow up; get rid of all the teenage-worries, feelings, and problems. I just wanna be me, without all the obstacles. How come that’s so hard?
