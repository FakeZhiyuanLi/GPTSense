      THE MEDICAL DOCOTOR IS NOW THE MAN. I am seeing a new OBGYN because he came highly recommended. I was given a script of a new drug for cramps.  I went to fill the prescription but my insurance requires a prior authorization.  WELL THE OBGYN'S OFFICE DOES NOT DO PRIOR AUTHS: THEY DO NOT CALL INSURANCE COMPANIES FOR MEDICAITION.  I called, complained, and now I am waiting for the nurse to call me back.   Lets project:    I am in labor; the OBGYN tells me that the epidural is not covered by my insurance unless he calls them and verifies that I really need it.  So I do not get the epidural becuase it is his policy not to call insurance companies for medications.     THAT POLICY REALLY IS HURTING THE PATIENT NOT HELPING.   I HATE THE INUSANCE COMPANY.  I REALLY HAVE ANGER TOWARD MEDCO.  MEDCO IS THE REASON YOU CANNOT GET AN ASPRIN WITH OUT A PRIOR AUTHROIZATION. WHY DO WE HAVE TO DO THE WORK FOR THE DOCOTORS OFFICE?  .   WHAT HAPPENDS IF I NEED TO HAVE SOMEHTING DONE IS THE DOCOTOR GOING TO REFUSE TO FIGHT FOR MY CARE?

      Majdi and I both had food poisoning last night and it is still with us today.   Rules to live by: never eat out when it is humid and hot bacteria grows.  I get the feeling restaurateur did their best, but no matter how clean and well known the restaurateur you can never really rely on the staff.  It was pizza for God Sake.  I hate to think that the staff did not wash there hands ,but I am thinking that was it.  AHHHHHHH    Majdi gets over this stuff fast.  I was not well at all.  He was a great partner in heling me with my trauma in the bathroom.  Nothing like Newsweek to pass the time.

      It was just announced that today is National Ignore Pradeep day.  Now you are thinking   What is a Pradeep?  Pradeep is a man ( well I like to think of him as a man child) who works with a personal friend of mine.  Pradeep is similar to a snake with two legs.  He lives in an altered reality where he believes women are beneath him and that he is GOds right hand man.  What do you if you see one?  Try and ignore it while sending postive thoughts its way.  If that does not work and it is still making noise, whack it with your hand.    If you have a Pardeep sighting let us know.    Thank you

      Mondays, the first day of the traditional work week.  I use to work non traditional jobs; retail or in salons/ spas, and even if Tuesday or Friday were the start of my week Mondays never seem to have that "I am embracing the day" to it.  I think about the weekend that just passed as if it were a far away memory.  (AH so dramatic).  I look around the house and make another list of all the things that did not get accomplished because we just wanted to see friends or relax. That is the great thing about dust and chores; they will still be there no matter what.   There have even been songs written about Monday's "Manic Monday" by  urlLink The Bangles  and "I hate Mondays" by  urlLink Tom Waits , and the band  urlLink The Mondays  . I am sure there are many more expressions about Monday that I have not included.   Monday gets a bed wrap.  I have tried to think more positively about Mondays, but it is hard when not everyone has the same look on there face when Monday comes.  Maybe listening to "The Happy Mondays" or rename the day or start a movement towards three day weekends.  That would be wonderful to work only four days and have three days off.  I still would not complete the things on my list.

      It is my last Sunday for at least 3 weeks with Majdi.  We are such tech heads we worked most of the afternoon.  It was more of brain storming but it was still work.   I am overwhelmed with all the packing that needs to be done for our move and the next two weeks I have a seminar and then I am leaving for 2.5 weeks to California.  I scheduled myself too tight.  Oh well that is life with the ADHD brain

       Blue Cross Blue  insurance is the most disorganized company I have ever encountered.  They have over 10 800 numbers for various task that still take you to the voice prompt loop form hell.  I needed to get a prior auth for a medication for one of my employerâ€™s patients.  Doctors do not write scripts for fun: They write them because people need them. If they write them out side of the PDR (physicians desk reference guidelines a la the FDA) there is a good reason.  I love it when the frigging pharmaceutics in Charge tells the doctor 'well we cannot authorize that because it is more the FDA approves"  LOOK YOU WACK JOB INSURANCE COPMANIES THEIR PEOPLE NEED THEIR MEDS.  WHEN YOU GO TO MEDICAL SCHOOL AND THEN SURVIVE A RESDIANCEY THEN MAYBE YOU CAN QUESTION ANOTHER DOCORTS ABILTY TO TREAT.   What is the lesson from this?    The lesson is one must approach all insrucance companies with compassion: The people that work for these companies must have doen something horrible in anoher life.

      My client appears 1 hour early.  Luckily I was free. Yesterday the same individual arrived 24 hours late for their Monday appoitment.  I love my clients, I am grateful for them.  Some of them need two appoitment cards.

      Majdi's first day at Van Huesen!!! I have a picture of him for the AM but I am trying to figure our how to post it...    At 2:15pm he calls to tell me that it is going well.  He walked in and instead of having the typical first day of HR/meet and greet: Majdi starts to solve their computer problems.  But when do we find out about the discount?  Off to get ready for my next client.
