      i went to go see farenheight 911 today, but they wouldn't let me in because i was under 17,and my sister wasn't 18 so she couldnt buy my ticket. so we drove around and bonded. i didn't realized she is leaving in less than a month, crazy. wow me and moe used to hate each other...but i definately don't hate her anymore, and i never really did. so we talked it up and i realized  a lot of things. don't you hate it when people mold themselves to be like who they hang out with. they change to make everyone else happy. yeah well sometimes i do that. and i'm a pushover. and i make plans, and break them. and i feel sad when i don't go out and do things, when i shouldn't because being alone is good sometimes. sometimes you have to let go...you can't hold on to everything and everyone..because things are bound to get lost. boys suck...well with the exception of a few cool ones. as i told alex box, testosterone can kiss my ass until it grows up. don't you hate knowing something but knowing there's nothing you can do about it. i constantly feel like there aren't enough hours in a day or days in a week to do everything iwant to do. i feel so rushed, and i want to have as much fun as i possibly can the rest of this summer. i don't want to feel rushed anymore...

      last night we had a game and lost...oh well. we went to matt's house and swam afterwards that was cool. i got thrown in with my uniform on, and then thrown in with my only other clothes on. so, i was a really wet kid. i realized i suck at marco polo, as well as making s'mores. oh yeah and basketball lol. court and i had to get up at 7 and babysit her little cousin this morning so i am sooo tired. it was funny though because he kept going "look at my butt!" hahaaaa. I'M NEVER HAVING KIDS. tomorrow i have to have this "operation" where they put a camera down my throat for like 2 hours and thru my organs trying to watch my acid reflux and find a hole that i may be bleeding from inside. i'm anemic and they don't know why...so they have to do this. yeah but it sucks because i've had this done twice before and it's a bitch. if ur my friend come and visit me during the day tomorrow, i'll be home and in pain, and tired. bring me ice cream!! u know i would be sooooo happy. i was supposed to go to this really cool concert with some kids, but now i can't because of this damn thing. ickkk.

      "You said you wanted to get to know each other So let’s go, let’s do it, let’s get to know one another, I don’t want to wait any longer knowing something may or may not be.  Just look at me, come on, tell me what you see. Do I wreak of potential, do I smell of a sure thing Am I everything you might want forever or just a fling? You shoot out the signals with a flare gun at my heart, you pull away , hesitate, with a rope tearing me apart, Just pull me with you, I’ll go, lasso me in. Let’s go take the time to figure you out... While we’re there lets look for me because I’m lost. We’re going nowhere fast."

      the quarry dance was dull as usual. dancing just isn't as fun as it used be ha. i went with kristen and karissa, that was fun. eight cop cars came and busted up some horseplay...exciting i know. so, after the dance we walked over to in & out mart to visit our fellow companion deanna holding up the fort at her ice cream serving job. well...someone brought out the mean evil annie in me last night. her name starts with a b, has two other b's in it, ends with the same last two letters as my first name does, and well there is an o in the name as well. but i mean who is mentioning names here? not i. so, since like beginning of school she has been married and blew us off the whole winter, and not to mention ditched my birthday party to hang with her bf. i mean husband. well, after a course of events similar to that one over a long period of time, we were like screw you. so she calls candiss yesterday and asks to go to the quarry dance wtih us. she's all giddy and excitedand is like ok thuper i'll be there by 730...candiss waits and waits, anonymous is a no-show. not to mention, she did the same damn thing LAST QUARRY DANCE!we call her house at the dance, and her madre is all like "well (insert husbands name) had two basketball games and she is there" like as if she had to be there because god forbid she wouldnt be with him or being his personal cheering squad for one damn game. so, i decided to hell with anonymous. don't  cry to me when you and ur husband file for divorce because you have used up all of the little bit of sympathy i was trying to scrounge up for the day it happens. so peace out!

      MAIRE'S BACK! yayyy. i hope she had a healthy irish time in ireland. so the other day i went go-carting with caity, courtney, lisa, germany, jorden, and then ryan and some kids showed up. it was funny. the first time on the track lisa spins out and caity crashes right into her. but the funniest thing ever was when caity wiped out and blocked the whole lane and caused a 10 go-cart pile up. lmao it was so funny and she is just sitting there like "oops, my bad". that day i went to the mall with court and matt. good times. i fell in love with a dress, and boy was it a pretty dress. yesterday we went to the J for summer gym and did nothing lol. alex box came, good kid. his brother is my twin; i mean we could be related we look so alike. i took a trip to the village yesterday. fun as always. i almost caught a frog, but i scared the bugger. when i got back i walked over to meghan's house and me candiss courtney watched a movie with her. then, alex and max came over and we chatted. they rode me home on the pegs so i didn't get raped. i'm going to karissa's brother's grad party tonight. i remember when i was little and i had a crush on him, and he called me annabelle. wahahahaa.

      wooohoooo chicago was a good time my friends. i love emily shump! she is a fun and smart and awesome gal who i can talk with about anything in the world. if you need someone to put ur head on straight, and give you some good wholesome advice...she's quite the deal.      well, the day i got there we went to go see spiderman 2 with some of her pals. great movie. james franco is a fine piece of meat. we went to the quarry the next day, and then to the "commons". that was some good times. the best part was going down town for the 3rd. emily and i got to shop and walk around all by ourslelves the WHOLLLEEEE day. it was wonderful. i bought some cool stuff, like this lip stuff with snake venom in it...it makes ur lips look cool lol. then we found those people who steal expensive purses off the back of the trucks and sell them for less. emily bought her mom this really expensive purse for like 100 less. it was so funny. and the lady was all like "yo, mon take that bag of purses and put it behind here. hurry someone is goin to see mon" all in a hushed secretive voice. i felt scandalous. we then got lost looking for urban outfitters. we went 7 blocks too far until this old man told us where it was. then we were late for dinner and got in trouble. after dinner we went down to navy pier with the family and watched the fireworks. emily and i rode that huge ferris wheel. me and this boy had a rundown for a park bench, and he won. bastard. he then invited his family to sit there so we couldn't sit with he and his friend. after a long and funnnn day we spent the night at a hotel downtown. the next morning we rode the train back to her house. we went to her high school and watched the fireworks the 4th, and then the quarry the next day. it was sooo much fun. i love getting away from this stupid town! she helped me realize what i really want, and how i really want to get to it. being with emily helps me to forget about shit, and realize what stuff i should be sad about, and what i should just be like oh well about. if i could i would take back a lot of things, but there a lot of things i'm happy to move on from.          someday i'm going to live in chicago again. i'm going to have an apartment and a starbucks on my corner. realizing that there are things outside of suburbia is the best thing that can happen to anyone. too many people stay in little sylvania towns their whole life, never getting out to see what else there is to this country. don't settle for UT...and don't settle for living here the rest of ur life, just because that's what your parents, and their parents have done their whole lives. you'd be so amazed at how many cool, interesting people there are out there. get out of here.

       Wade picked Candiss and I up on saturday to go up to Katie's cottage on Devil's Lake, for her 16th bday. When we got there everyone was in the water, so we got our suits on and said hey to everyone. My first time out tubing was crazy. It was courtney, candi, katie, gabby, and me all on the big tube. we wiped out numerous times. my livestrong bracelet fell off on the first wipe out! don't fret....i found it. When we got back to shore we walked around the lake to katie's aunts house to play volleyball in the really shallow water. That was hilarious...the girls got killed and we sucked. They got an action shot of me diving for the ball though haha. Then on the way back Tom picked Candiss, court, and i up when we were walking. We fit 11 kids in his tiny car and our legs were like out the windows, and max was in the trunk. Some lady started following us and honking...but when we stopped she was just like "wow it must be warm in there" so alex told her to get the hell away haha. Chad, wade, drew, court, and me all went tubing after dinner with Mr. Wambold. They told me i shouldn't go becasue they are going to be doing really tough stuff and going super fast. Haha me and chad were on the 2 person tube, and we only fell off once. the rest of them fell off like 4 times. it was so fun. mr. wambold was trying so hard to get us off. andrew jumped on to our tube on a turn and scared the crap out of me. We had a bondfire later and some s'mores. Then we played catch phrase until the boys had to go to the tents. good game. gabby, court, and i bombed the guys with water balloons at night. They got mad and started coming up to the windows scaring us and stuff. Then they exploded a can of shaving cream in the fire, which they planned on putting all over our heads. dustin and scott woke us up at 8:00! ugh. we went and pulled down wade, drew, and chad's tent becasue it was a piece of crap and got it on video. Then the girls, dustin and nick went to church on the lake. we came back and katie took candiss and me on the jet ski. the rest of the day we just tubed, and videotaped it, and played cards and layed around. candiss, gabby, court, and i took the paddle boat out because we wanted to go to Round Lake. we were in like the middle of the lake and a family of horseflies started attacking us!! we were screaming and jumping up and down while the boat started to sink. They kept biting us and it hurt like hell! i went to go get in the front of the boat to swat them with my tupperware lmao, and i went to go grab on to courtney and she was so greased up in oil that i slid right off of her into the water head first. then everyone else jumped in. gabby and court swam to shore and left me and candiss to pull the boat in. everytime we tried to get back in it they came back to bite us so we pulled it like half way. chad and andrew swam out to save us and we paddled the rest of the way in. it was one very fun weekend and i love you katie thanks so much for having me!
