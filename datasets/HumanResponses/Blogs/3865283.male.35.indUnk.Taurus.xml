      2 funny things happened today:  a detective from the conway police department called me up to inquire about a case of electronic identity theft about 3 weeks ago i made an online application for a mortgage on a potential new home well it seems i had two numbers transposed on my bank account number •• the person whose bank account number i did reference received some sort of correspondence about the credit inquiry into the account •• the person whose account it is does not handle their bank account, because this person is mentally handicapped and their accounts are handled by an agency••well the agency was quite alarmed to see this activity and notified the authorites who in turn called me  ••  long story short the detective was very nice and the situation is now resolved - however i commited a felony and the agency could have taken me to court  after speaking with mr. law i checked my bank account info online and was met with shock myself last week we i paid off a credit card by way of a check by phone with a human being every payment made that day at the credit card place had their checks deposited twice so i'm out $310 until they get their head out of their asses and re-credit my account but, of course, i didn't have an extra 300 in my account and now a check has bounced - but the bank told me that i can get all of my bounced check fees back because they made a unauthorized withdrawal  funny stuff

      so we are met with more rain here in the central Arkansas region  all in all we have been very fortunate with regards to the heat this year, the temp has only been over 90ºF about 10 times, and then the humidity was pretty high, so it was quite manky out  ive been looking for a different line of work lately as my current nazi employer has begun laying people off, he is a big asshole and liar  are all employers trying to be assholes or is it just mine  today the nazi fuck made mention of Democratic running mate John Edwards visit to a local workplace and he said, "hey all the stupid people will go to work there and we'll get all the smart people  yep that's our piece of Claude Fulton all right  he'll complain to me about something not being the way he likes it in my workplace where he never goes and has no idea how any of it works, but he is certain that i am wrong  so business has been kinda slow and it makes him edgy - so fucking what - GET YOUR OWN ASS OUT THERE AND SELL SOMETHING instead of looking at cars on yahoo all day long
