      haha... things are finally settled... i just knew it!!! things will eventually be solved by itself... so happy today although i have lots of homework... but who cares anyway... me, niangqing, dajie, erjie went to sakae sushi to have our lunch... my god... i was so full that i cant walk anymore.. while erjie said that she nearly vomitted... the servive there is damn super lousy.. especially this supervisor there.. she is so rude to us.. that's very unfair.. just because we are students she treat us as though we haven got any money to pay for our meal.. my god.. the meal is only about $16.05 per head.. what's the big deal.. we nearly got a feedback form to complain... we got her name and even over it.. maybe it is because my eyesight is bad.. i thought her name is Bao Lang when actually her name is dunno what Bee Luan... i think... we hide lots of sushi all over the place.. we even wrap some in our pocket and bring it out to throw away.. me and erjie worst.. i know it may sound a bit gross.. we actually put the sushi into our mouth and went to the toilet to spit it out in the toilet bowl.. we got no choice at all.. we are not suppose to waste food... though wuite a number of happy things happen today.. one sad thing happen to.. a girl frm our sch had passed away on saturday due to high fever.. i mean just a fever.. though i may not know her but it is really such a pity that she passed away at such a young age... we can never predict what is going to happen in the future...
