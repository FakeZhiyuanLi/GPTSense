      I was gonna add some more pictures like Rob's been doing, but for some reason Hello (the program that so conveniently allows me to do that, or at least in theory does) isn't cooperating.  Just imagine some really cool pictures.  Keep rocking and rolling, Rob, I'll catch up sooner or later.

      What a play on words. Well, no one gets it.  Here we are. A team. Like Tenacious D or P. Diddy and Mace. It seem like the more dough we make, the more brothers we see. Ain't dat tha trut'. Since we are the greatest lost cause to have ever walked the planet. We speak and no one hears us. We shout and some one says "Did you hear something?" "No" "I thought I heard 'We suck!' Must be hearing things, oh well."  But onward we march, like there's hope, light at the end of the tunnel, some prize at the finish line. But we're lost, hope's lost, we are in the darkest abyss, veering off the track.  Well there is one thing. We have vivid imaginations. And we can pretend very well that there's something worth living for, and it's not just True Love!... ok so the only thing worth living for is true love. but we've got it. we have the love of art and creating, and we both have our own loves. and we both love our wieners.

      Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the first-ever post of bentwerx@blogspot!  It's not exactly important or anything.  Rob had something really clever to say about it in his own first post, but I forgot it.  It was still really good though.  If we're lucky he'll put it up here.  Everyone begin praying to Rob now.  There's absolutely nothing important to be said here.  We'll just go over the basics for now:   who can comment?  Anyone.  Go ahead and flame us.  We'll flame ya right back, bitch.  why does this site suck already?  If you feel like putting time into it, do so immediately and you won't have to deal with it.  Oh, yeah--you can't.  ...  What?  is... that it?  Yep.  We'll do some more later.  Goodnight everyone.

      A conversation between myself and El Renss. Can you guess who is who? anyways. We are probably the only people that think this is funny. I implore you to waste some time and brain cells: [21:26:05:23:2004] The MASTER: we worked out the system of the yard sale in gloucester [21:26:05:23:2004] The MASTER: it's a self-supporting cottage industry [21:27:05:23:2004] durandal: cottage? cheese? [21:27:05:23:2004] The MASTER: there's these people, see--and this is fact, you'll know when I get to the stuff we deduced [21:27:05:23:2004] The MASTER: forget that part for now [21:27:05:23:2004] The MASTER: anyways [21:27:05:23:2004] The MASTER: these people go around to yard sales, and buy things [21:27:05:23:2004] The MASTER: then they come home, and have a yard sale, and try to sell them [21:27:05:23:2004] The MASTER: BUT [21:28:05:23:2004] The MASTER: in fact most of the yard sales are the same people doing the same things [21:28:05:23:2004] The MASTER: this shirt, that's selling for one dollar [21:28:05:23:2004] The MASTER: one guy will buy it, then he'll sell it and the guy who sold it will buy it right back, so that he can sell it [21:28:05:23:2004] The MASTER: and it goes back and forth [21:28:05:23:2004] The MASTER: eventually [21:29:05:23:2004] durandal: eventually...! [21:29:05:23:2004] The MASTER: some dumbass comes up and says "oo, nice shirt," and buys it for a dollar and twenty-five cents [21:29:05:23:2004] durandal: lol [21:29:05:23:2004] The MASTER: so the guy selling the shirt goes "ah! Made a profit! I totally ripped that guy!" [21:29:05:23:2004] The MASTER: well, no [21:29:05:23:2004] The MASTER: he's spent about twenty dollars on gas toting that shirt back and forth between yard sales [21:30:05:23:2004] The MASTER: and he's reclaimed... a quarter [21:30:05:23:2004] durandal: he should walk! [21:30:05:23:2004] The MASTER: allright, rob, look [21:30:05:23:2004] The MASTER: he's a lazy fatass who tries to make a living raiding yard sales [21:30:05:23:2004] durandal: lol [21:30:05:23:2004] The MASTER: he can't hardly walk up the doorstep to go watch TV [21:31:05:23:2004] durandal: so he sells it [21:31:05:23:2004] durandal: or pretends to [21:31:05:23:2004] durandal: so he doesn't have to walk up the doorstep [21:31:05:23:2004] durandal: and then someone buys it [21:31:05:23:2004] The MASTER: and his exercise routine is reaching over on the couch while he's watching TV to order a brand new shiny penis pump he just saw on a paid advertisement [21:31:05:23:2004] durandal: and he has to go driving to get it back [21:31:05:23:2004] durandal: penis pump mmmmmm [21:31:05:23:2004] The MASTER: vicious cycle.. [21:31:05:23:2004] durandal: dman it [21:31:05:23:2004] The MASTER: not that it'll do him any good [21:31:05:23:2004] durandal: where's michelle [21:31:05:23:2004] durandal: i want her now! [21:31:05:23:2004] The MASTER: I mean, seriously, his hand will not be impressed [21:32:05:23:2004] durandal: lol [21:32:05:23:2004] durandal: that's good [21:32:05:23:2004] durandal: that's the best [21:32:05:23:2004] durandal: i mean think about it [21:32:05:23:2004] durandal: the guys who buy penis pumps don't have a sex life [21:32:05:23:2004] The MASTER: basically, yeah [21:32:05:23:2004] durandal: they buy penis pump so that they can, but they're losers [21:33:05:23:2004] durandal: so the only thing they'd impress is their hand [21:33:05:23:2004] The MASTER: yep [21:33:05:23:2004] durandal: which isn't going to happen [21:33:05:23:2004] durandal: wait [21:33:05:23:2004] durandal: i can imagine it now [21:33:05:23:2004] The MASTER: there she is, yeah [21:33:05:23:2004] durandal: *zip* alright here we go... wow. [21:33:05:23:2004] The MASTER: heh [21:34:05:23:2004] The MASTER: Damn, you been workin' out? Heh heh, my little secret. [21:34:05:23:2004] The MASTER: Imagine that--he keeps sexy secrets from himself [21:34:05:23:2004] The MASTER: that's desperate [21:34:05:23:2004] durandal: lol [21:35:05:23:2004] The MASTER: and then, he goes up to ocean mystique and gets handcuffs [21:35:05:23:2004] The MASTER: kinky handcuffs! [21:35:05:23:2004] The MASTER: and he cuffs himself to the bed [21:35:05:23:2004] The MASTER: but then--oh shit! [21:35:05:23:2004] The MASTER: this is a real kinky setup and all [21:35:05:23:2004] The MASTER: but you can't jack off with your hands cuffed to the bedpost [21:35:05:23:2004] The MASTER: but he was so hot and bothered cuffing himself up that he dropped the key [21:35:05:23:2004] The MASTER: so he's screwed [21:36:05:23:2004] The MASTER: he has to scream for help until the person in the next trailer over comes on over [21:36:05:23:2004] The MASTER: and that's embarrasing [21:37:05:23:2004] durandal: yep [21:37:05:23:2004] durandal: and we makes his bud Bud swear to never speak of it over a half full can of left over beer [21:37:05:23:2004] durandal: *he [21:37:05:23:2004] The MASTER: yep [21:38:05:23:2004] The MASTER: a promise that's broken next time Bud's over a half full can of beer at a party

      This is a story I'm writing so that a friend (El Rensso) and I can begin wroking on the comic book. I think will just turn into a thick one-shot, or a thin graphic novel. Once I figure out this picture thing, I will host some early sketches of the characters. It's an interesting style. It's a dynamic stick figure art. The stick figures are 3d. The only "stick-figure" characteristic is that they have oval detailed smiley faces and they wear gloves like disney characters, and they have thick black lines for arms. Can't wait to finish it. I'm going to see this one through unlike the other projects that only made it half way throught the creation process.

      Chapter 4 “Where it All Began”  “Jordan?” “Yes. Father.” “Take this money and go buy some milk.” “Yes, sir.” “And while you’re out treat yourself to a candy bar.” “Thanks Pops!” I said as I darted out the door. “Jingle-Jingle-Jingle.” I ran down two blocks to the grocier. I picked out a quart of milk and my favorite candy bar. As I was walking gleefully back, I heard a racket. “Ta-rat-rat-rat-rat-rat!” I made haste back to McBride’s Meat Deli. I saw the men flee the deli with Tommy guns in hand. “Father!” I ran in the deli. Blood was everywhere. Human blood was everywhere, on the walls, on the floor, on the ceiling, on the windows. I was even on my Birthday cake. They, my dead friends and family, had thrown me a surprise birthday party. “Jordan.” I heard faintly from my father behind the counter. “What is it dad?” I said with tears streaming down my face. “Take the money from the safe and go. Leave this place.” “How?” “A gang lord named Bazyli. I owed him money which I did not repay.” There was a pause. I was too shocked to say anything. “Oh, and Happy Birthday.” “I love you, dad.” And my father died in my arms. I took the money and ran. I didn’t know what to do I just followed orders. I wandered the streets. I didn’t fit in with the other kids. I had lost my innocence and I was only 10. Often I ended up in fights; probably because I didn’t have a heart anymore. And one day a man saw me fight. And he said: “Kid, you sure got some fists on ya. And how old are ya? 12?!” “Yeah. So.” “How’d you like to fight kids everyday and not get in trouble for it?” “What’s in it for me?” “Respect. Strength. Money. It’s boxing kid. Not many people got what it takes, but you do. I’ve seen it.” So Henry, the trainer, saw my potential. He always said I was a natural. Not before long I was fighting above my weight rank. I became quite popular too; the even called me “Johnny One-Fist” because some fights I won with only one fist. Because of this popularity, I was the hot topic for gangsters. I heard the name Bazyli mentioned once. And I knew this was what I had to do. So, I accepted. Chinquay gave me a job. Under Chinquay, I again became a “natural.” I was desensitized, heartless, and merciless- I was a cold-blooded killer. Once I thought I was good enough I started to enact my revenge. And that’s where it all began.

      I woke up around midnight in a dark alley. Don’t remember a damn thing. Questions flying around in my head: Who are you? Where are you? What are you doing? How’d you get? I attempt to stand “Shit!” Now I remember. The sharp sobering pain in my left leg brought me back to reality. I have to get out of here. I headed back to the bar.

      Chapter 2 “Alexei Theron ‘The Hunter’”  Alexei marches determinately out of Bazyli’s office and the speakeasy. “Hey Alexei, Where you going?” “To find the rat bastard that killed Arsenio and Cadmus,” he said without stalling He saw the pool of blood at the garbage can. He followed the trail. It ended at the door of Tony “The Barber’s” shop. “Tony!’ “Alexei, I don’t know a damn thing.” “Wrong answer!” “BLAM!” Alexei gives himself 0 years of bad luck. “You ‘don’t know a damn thing’ about what… Huh? Where’d he go? Where’d. He. GO!” Alexei said as he held the gun to Tony’s head. “Alright! I’ll tell you… He came in here with his left leg bleeding. I helped clean him up. I asked him where he lived. He said on the corner of 5th and Marlon. I offered to give him a ride, but he couldn’t be bothered. And he left” “Thanks. Here’s a dollar, buy your daughter a nice dress.” And the sentinel trudged onward to his next target.  I only have three friends: guns, pain, and the bottle. With all friends and family dead, you get lonely. But when your heart is dead, you just get bored. And to pass the time, you kiss the bottle. If you can’t think, you can’t think about your problems. Alexei arrived at the corner of 5th and Marlon. There were four corners. Only two of them were inhabited. There was a hotel and an abandoned bar. Alexei walks into the hotel. “Have any men walked in here with a limp?” “No, sir. I don’t believe so.” “Are you certain?” “Well. I wasn’t here last night. You’d have to talk to Charlie- I’ll call him.” “Tell him I want to see him in person. Give me his address.” The receptionist saw the seriousness in Alexei’s eyes and gave him the directions. He headed off to his new destination. But just then he saw a stirring in the abandoned bar. Grasping his pistol he approached the bar. The doors burst open. “Werz ma hatt!” “Your just a kid! How old are you? 15… 16?” “I’m a dam sexteen” “Get lost! And sober up. It’s not right for kids your age to be drinking.” Alexei entered the office of Charlie, accompanied by two hefty guards. “Charlie. I have a few questions to ask you. Now I want them ansewered, with no crap. I don’t have time to deal with crap. So question number 1: Last night. Did you see a man who had trouble walking- maybe a limp- or had a wounded leg?” “Uh… I didn’t see any men. But I did see a boy- maybe 15, 16- who came to the speakeasy late last night. And now that you mention it, he beat up about 3 of our best men!” Just then, Alexei realized what he had done, he had let go the man (boy) he was hunting. This has never happened before. No one escapes the aim of Alexei Theron. And Alexei rampaged. Charlies dead. Wrong place, Wrong time.  “Boy! Where the hell are you!” Alexei ran through the old bar kicking empty liquor bottes. “You tricked me once, but never again.” And that’s how being piss drunk saved my life.

      Chapter 1 “Big Mistake”  “Leave me to my business. Or. Else…” I said calmly with fury behind my eyes. The doorman of the speak-easy erupted into laughter “Give me your best shot. Squirt!” He became serious, as I already was “BLAM!” He got my best shot; it landed right between the eyes, before he had the chance to lift his pistol. “Big mistake.” Shit; backups. Probably have Tommies. I thought to myself. Before I finished thinking I dove behind the garbage. “Ta-rat-rat-rat-rat-rat!” teased the Tommy gun. Big mistake. “That’ll teach the basta-“They should have made sure I was dead. Although, I was hit so much adrenaline was pumping through my veins I couldn’t feel the wound in my left leg. It wouldn’t be long until the rest of those dirtbags would be on my tail. So, if I wanted to live long enough to do what I came to do, I’d have to wait. Jordan McBride’s place is a complete dump. My place is a complete dump. Not even vermin could call this home. I use it to sleep and drop off my things. The only roof I need is my hat. “This is boring, I’m going to the unmentionable” I sit down with a whiskey. Flappers and floozies were burning a hole in the carpet behind me. “Hey there Handsome.” “Get lost, flirt.” “Fine, Mr. Grouch.” Big mistake. I anticipated the event and left. But I couldn’t escape the boys. “Wait. We’re gonna give you a lesson in manners.” “I’ve already been to school.” And the rumble starts. Unfair odds, but they made it easy for me. The two weak ones attacked first. The one on the left lunges at me, easy dodge. Then a hard right jab to the other’s kisser. Now it is Rough-Houser’s turn. A few jabs, but he’s too tall and slow to land a hit. I hit him straight in the gut with a left. Then I finished him with one to the side of the head.  I’ll never get over the rush after you throw a punch. I’m punching my card out for the night. “Alexei. I want him dead. DEAD!” “As you wish Bazyli.” Bazyli was standing. He had a very business-like presence for a gangster. He was dealing with business. Since I had interrupted his business (time is money, money is business) and incurred him a few good men. I must repay him. He’s sending Alexei to collect. The predicament is Bazyli still owes me 10 million more men. The cost for his murderous acts against my family. Big Mistake.

      If only I had at least talked to Michelle, I would be better- no, I would be great. One word uttered from her soft sweet lips would instantaneously cure all ails. All pains would be replaced by pleasure. Where emotional grieves hung on my soul, would be lifted away by joy and happiness. Oh how I miss her. No one can know, but her. She may even miss me more. But "Look to the future hopes and dreams," as she has advised me, and now I feel better. I will see her tomorrow. And until then I must live in illusion.

      There most always be a first post on blogs. I mean how else are people going to know if it's the first post. If you just start posting, people will think that you've been posting since the beginning of time. And then they feel like they've missed so much. And then they don't want to keep reading, like if you catch a movie in the middle.   On the other hand: if you have a "First Post Ever" post, then your post becomes really corny and pointless. And now people lose interest because you're not professional.  Thank You for reading my Pointless bullshit, Robert Ramsay Defender of all that is hopeless

      I am not a musician, nor do I sing. I don't even dance. And the future of those qualities in me is bleak. So this blog is purely hypothetical.  A musician has thousands of girls throwing their panties at them. They could bang 5 chicks a day 24/7. So how do the "Rockstars" choose which fish is right for them. The normal guy can't even find a fish, he's deprived. But the "Rockstar" is drowning. While "Joe" has to settle for less, the "Rockstar" has to find the needle in the haystack. How can he find the best girl. How can he tell who really loves him. This can also be applied to Actors. How does the actor know that the person is in love with them or the character they act as. I feel pity for these tainted deities. I am sorry for their doomed romantic drama.

      This weekend was excellent. I got to be with Michelle a lot on saturday. I had the playboy channel, a 12-pack of Vanilla Coke(c), hotpockets, a house to my self. I saw "HP3," as my girlfriend's sister LA calls it, twice. I was good. I liked the story. But like Shelly noted, the new director left the audience a bit on the lacking side. Lacking the Harry Potter experience. But, if someone really wants the experience that bad I suggest they read the book. I won't. I can't leisurely read books, it bores me. I think my love of Michelle has gone up to the next level. It's the strongest emotion I've ever felt. I can't wait to see her again.

      This phrase muttered between people is very loaded. Eventhough the speaker is refusing to give information, he (or she) said something. This something is "I don't know what to say." While the speaker is remaining silent, he has already said too much. He has told the other half of the conversation that he doesn't want to say what he's thinking. He is too scared to reveal his thoughts. But if he were bold he could do so well. It's all a matter of social developement. Whatever you say it doesn't matter what you're thinking but what the listener is thinking. So the moral of the rant is: think about who is listening before you choose your words.

      I was riding in a car. and we pased some sationed train carts. Of course like most public things, it had graffitti. But it said "Save the trees." And i thought, well if YOU want to save the trees you shouldn't have been releasing those CFCs into the atmosphere with that can of spray paint. YOU'RE DEPLEATING THE OZONE LAYER! Ahhhhh!   --  Rock.

      First there is one thing i should say: I rarely hate a movie. I just can't turn down a movie. The only times I've ever hated a movie is when I refuse to see it... ever.  Ok so i thought sm2 was great. The object of the movie was not to bring you highpaced hero action. And it was not to amaze you with special FX. and you aren't supposed to be wooed with a romantic love story. the movie was about peter paker, not spider man. it was about peter parker and he's troubles as a human-hero. that he can't do everything. he can't have what he wants. he'll live in regret for the rest of his life, for the death of his "father" uncle ben.   so when you make your choice to see the movie or when you make you opinion of it, keep that in mind.

      Both myself and a close friend of mine have managed to get into some horrible situations. His situation is more of bad luck and dangerous decisions. Whereas mine is more of betrayal and dangerous decisions.  My friend:  Long ago he was driving. Trailing behind a large truck hauling a huge trailer. The truck moves into the left lane of a two way street (one lane each direction). My friend assumes the truck driver was allowing him to pass, seems almost reasonable even more in the situation. But passing on the left is "illegal and stupid" as the cop said. Since the truck turned into the side of his car scraping the car head to toe. Now the damage was minimal- only cosmetic. But, he got lucky and wasn't charged with anything. But he had another mistake of going 74 in a 55 at the north end of 17. it was stupid. but not really that bad until he got caught. for that mistake he got probation. It was okay as long as he didn't do anything stupid soon.  Well he did. A very long straight road one-two minutes from his house. He made the mistake of pushing the car to 56 mph in a 25 mph. and that, is very illegal... and dangerous. He didn't think he could get caught. But he did, by a state trooper. Now he must go to court again. He’s looking at a huge insurance bill, major fees, and strict punishment. He could loose his license, which means no car for senior year. Or he could be able to drive but only to and from work/school= no social life. Also he was trying to save up for a "euro trip." which he was looking forward to with great pleasure. But that's not happening with insurance, court fees, and gas. Impossible unless he were bill gates. That’s hell.  Myself:  A have a girlfriend (see last post). She and I are teenagers- horny teenagers. We can't just sit around all day 100 feet from each other wasting are dull youth away. So we break a rule. One stupid rule. Neither of our parents was home. We both have sisters. My sister baby-sits all day tuesday-thursday. Her sister sits at home festering. So since nobody would know, because NOBODY would tell, it was a really good life. But as I’ve mention we are horny teenagers. Sitting on each other's laps- no, being in the same room makes us go crazy.  -Now I can ignore something, I can forget to inform. But I can't blatantly lie. I suck at it. -  We made out when her sister wasn't looking. And when she wasn't in the room. We were animals. I have inhidable bite marks covering my neck. We were in the chair. It wasn't big enough. We moved to the floor. Her sister walks in. and that's when things fall apart. She leaves us for the rest of the time I was there. We finish up. And I leave with considerable time before the parents arrive. Everything would have been cool. But someone lied. The sister betrayed us. She told her mom about me being home. Why, no one will even understand. Now Michelle is a shaken mess. The parents have lost trust. I have lost my standing (as if I ever had one). And the sister. I have no clue what to do with the sister. I can't do anything rash. And I can't hold a grudge; it would only make matters worse. So my choice is to be nice.     And there is, for you, my readers, two situations that suck ass.

      the more important question is if i even want to. but the answer to that question is yes. i want people to engjoy my blog. so how do i attract/entertain readers.   well for starters. i think an important part of any blog is to avoid alienating readers. if they don't know what you are talking about why would they read it. so avoid at all costs inside jokes. never talk to your friends as you would with them. and address them properly as if introducing them.   keep topics to theoligical, philosophical, or social debates. politics is good every now and then, but you don't want to become another news website. to include your audience use large amounts of rhetorical questions. because (1) it gets them thinking even harder and (2) they'll think you are requestion commments. when talking about these topics don't be afraid to be radical. let your guts spill. whatever you think write it. the more radical the more you may anger or enlighten someone and encourage them to comment.  make it personal. because the more personal you make it, the more unique it becomes. but when speaking personally be sure to explain. make sure that whoever reads it will know enough to understand the situation.   show emotion. be pissed, be happy, be depressed. just be something. goddammit.

      Now I remember the cartoon. It was cool. But I wanted to know the source of this creative hero. And I found it "The Toxic Avenger." Known for being a gruesomely horrific satire of horror, super heroes, and modern (well the 80s) society.  &nbsp; The humor of Toxie was odd. The acting was horrible. And some of the horribly "avenging" Toxie did made you giggle more than squirm.&nbsp;There was plenty of blood and screaming, as well as horrible acts against innocents such as old people, little kids, blind people, and animals.  &nbsp; Melvin Junko the nerdiest guy in the world is a janitor at Tromaville's health center. Where his coolness is foiled by the hot chicks and cool jocks who tease him. A prank causes him to become into contact with radioactive goo while wearing a tutu. &nbsp; So he ends up a super-powered mutant freak who wears a tutu and cleans up vice with a mop... literally. &nbsp; He ends up with a girlfriend. She's a hot sexy blonde-bimbo. And she's blind so she can't tell what Toxie looks like. But she can feel his cock! Seriosly. There's a hot sex scene, er hot fuck scene. &nbsp; But the underlying political and social statements were good. Such as the ridiculous obsession of muscles and beauty. Then that church doesn't mean crap. And that big business and politicians are evil.  &nbsp; The acting may have been bad. And some of the actions scenes were too long and ended anticlimatically. But that's the point. Just watch it. And laugh. It's comedy. Sick comedy. &nbsp;  urlLink http://www.thetoxicavenger.com  &nbsp;
