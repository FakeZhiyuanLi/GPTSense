      Date: 23/2/2004 Hey! I'm here to make things clear! Sorry if my previous entry would kind of make you people mistaken about my relationship with him, but it is just that I was not in a very pleasant mood yesterday, and I just felt like sharing this incident with everyone. Anyway, today, I was so totally bored in school! The horrible (and terrible) weather made me soooooooo sleepy...plus Mdm Wee's lesson??? A perfect lullaby!!! I still don't get what she wants with us!!! Can she stop using the excuse as "we are a literature class" to get us answer questions??? I find it kind of irritating...and when will she ever stop the "pass up" stuff? Have you noticed? Almost every teacher teaching us uses "hand in" except her. So what if she is the english hod? Does it make her so special till she have to use "pass up" ? It is not that we are selfish, but we did remind her (countless of times) but I think it is her rather stubborn nature that is preventing her from learning "perfect" english. I dont know why but i just feel like criticising her now...probably due to the weather that is making me lose both my appetite and temper. Back to the events that happened recently. It is all thanks to a certain Mr Royce Kiang that make Pinky they all call me yang yang. I felt it is essential of me to share this as I hope that everyone will STOP calling me that. It is rather disgusting. And my name is Vannessa, not wad yang yang k? (this applies to every single living thing on earth...including air molecules and such.)

      Date: 22/2/2004 It has been two days already, but I still cannot forget the incident that happened on Friday. It was when I saw HIM at the Mcdonald's in Tampines Interchange. It was the first time I met him since that day when i confessed to him. However, he made me feel very hurt. Is it my fault that I din't go over and say Hi to him? Or is it because of that day that made us feel so awkward? Or is it that he din't recognise me? Or is it because the circumstances were not right? I hope i can get the answers to these questions as soon as possible...best thing if he tells me personally the reasons...

      Date : 22/2/2004 Today on the way home from tuition, I came across a mother and her young son (about 2-3 years old) on the 28 bus. It was a double decker, and i sat on top at the first row. This young son wanted to sit beside me, but on one condition and that was that his mother was to accompany him. I din't take much attention to the commotion as I was sleepy. Later his mother found a seat beside me and her son went over to her. He kept whining about the seat he wants. It was this sentence that captured my attention : "Son, in life, you will not always get the things you want! So you must learn to give and take, and be satisfied with the things you are given." It is so meaningful! I really take my hat off for this wonderful mother! Kudos to her!

      Date: 29/03/2004 haha...tis day will be a very memorable one...cos it is the day when i made the decision that would affect my life from this day onwards..due to lousy results for both pure chem and pure physics..i have decided to drop these two subjects and take up combined science instead! yes! it is such a relief for me cos tat mrs fong has been coming to me almost every day asking me to drop...and after getting my a maths quiz marks back..i have decded to concentrate more on those subjects which i can gurantee at least an A..unlike chem n physics which i am not too sure will get an A for me..come on...my L1R5 for ct is lousy lor...got me a lousy 23...hope this time my aggregate will improve tremendously...but i wont be joining the other sub-science ppl for class.i will still be with the pure ppl for class cos the enrolment is already full...but i am not alone...chui fong also wif me...which means a really can put in a lot more effort on my lousier subjects like A maths and s.s...muahahahaha...i finally feel so relieved...otherwise this hing has been bothering me for like quite some time...YES! EVERYONE GAMBATTE!!

      date: 2/3/2004 I juz realised that i am coming here to update this almost every day! this cannot go on..i have to study! and i'm trying to do my homework while typing this out! what a feat...haha...i'll juz see how long i manage to finish this..now the time is 9.12...i'm not chatting with anyone now too..so probably can save more time..haha..oh..today had my dental checkup...i think i was too excited or nervous or frightened of having the thought of having your mouth too wide open in front of some stranger and letting the person see who noes wat inside your mouth that i kind of banged into the door when going out..so pai seh...:$ the guy dentist's eyes is kind of nice...no wonder so many people saidhe was quite good looking. guess he would look better if he went on a diet however...haha...hmm...i must be loyal to my darling...hehe...had a vocab test this morning...we have to write out a passage using at least 10 of the vocab words in the boxes. i managed to use 16..hmm..not bad huh? haha...basically i just wrote crap..they wanted the passage to be about u being locked up in a bus after ur fren's birthday party..my whole passage only made mention of the party like for 1 sentence only? the rest was on describing the person's feelings... after school had library duty again...as usual slacked again...helped to shelf a bit...but the rest of the time was spent walking and talking to others..esp. stephie and diana...haha... my brother finally got his school's yearbook after wad seems like 3 months...saw many of my primary school frens' photos...they have changed alot! miss the good old days in primary school...haiz...some of them have become so much 'lian' after a mere 3 years! imagine how much a person can change after such a short time...i guess i have changed too...even my fren sylvia, whom i met on saturday said i have changed alot..in wat way? mebbe i have become much more outspoken..i dunno..hope that people can say in wat way i have changed in my testimonial for friendster..i'm curious to noe wat people think of me...haiz..i think i'd better end here...time is 9.27

      aw man.....................................................i'm actually starting to miss the exams now!!!!!!!!!! i think there is something seriously wong with me these few days!!! haiz...probably identity crisis or something like that...haiz...exams kind of ended today..but not yet officially as we still have chinese listening tml...hope and pray hard that my parents will let me go for a karaoke session wif celine they all...although they do sound as if they resented me going there...haiz...but surely i do deserve a well-deserved rest after slogging like hell for this past 2 weeks or so?? (although i do admit i slack lah...) but c'mon...i know that the Os are coming and that this is a very crucial year for everyone..but ever heard of the saying " all work and no play makes jack/jill a dull boy/girl"? i seriously believe i am really losing my touch with my frens although i seem to be the same with others..but i do think that m ability to communicate with other fellow planet dwellers has deteriorated seriously...thanks to who? haiz...i'm juz so plain bored now...got to go anyway...try to keep u updated as usual as possible...

        Somewhere between the *procrastination* and the homework.. and the incessant forwards and the friendships and the calls to each other complaining about CrUsHeS and BF/GF!! Somewhere between the phone calls to oldfriends and the "I miss you's", the "I love you's" andthe "What are we doing tonight's?" And somewherebetween all of the changing and growing...somewhere between the classes and the skippingclasses...and the StUdYiNg for teStS...And thePRETENDING to "StUdY" for TeStS... And the downright NOT StUdYiNg for TeStS... I forgot--I forgot what ScHooL was all about.  Somewhere between all the appointments, starbuck coffee, and Mc Donald's... paying bills and then not paying bills...Making plans then breaking plans... Appearing, Disappearing, then reappearing... I forgot--I forgot what it was like to cry. I forgot that pretending to be happy doesn't make you happy... And that pretending tobe SmArT doesn't make you smart .. I forgot that you can't just forget the past infear of the FUTURE... I forgot that you can't control falling in LoVe.. And that you can't make yourself fall in *LoVe*.... I learned that I can LOVE... I learned that it's okay to MEsS UP.... And it's okay to ask for HELP!!!.. And it's okay to feel like crap... I learned it's okay to cOmPLaiNand wHINe to all your friends for a whole day........ I learned that sometimes the things you wantmost you just can't have and the things that you look for are right in front of you.I learned that the greatest thing about HiGh ScHOoL and CoLLeGe and the working worldit isn't about the parties or the DRiNKiNG or the Hookups ...  It's the *FrIeNdShIpS*, which means taking chances. I learned that sometimes the things we want to forget are the things which we most need to talk about... I learned that TIME and LOVE can heal all things... I learned that just when you think it can't get worse - it does! ...but with the love and support of friends - you survive... I've learned that when you start feeling BaD about L O S I N G touch and about those that you've lost! They too, are feeling the same way....  I learned that letters from friends are the most important things. And that sending cards to your friends makes you feel better! But, basically, I just learned that my friends........ Both old and new..... are the most importantpeople to me in the world AND.......without them, I wouldn't be whoI am today.....  So this is a THANK YOU to all of my friends... For always being there. And even if we're not on good termsor we have lost touch... I will always have an unconditionallove for you.. ~Always and forever ~
