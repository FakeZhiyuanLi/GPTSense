						   I'm really having a great time learning about this blog stuff. One of the coolest things about blogs is the ability to  urlLink  syndicate   them using RSS or Atom files so that they can easily be read by programs called  urlLink  newsreaders  . I'm a big fan of web-based tools, so naturally I was easily swayed toward  urlLink Bloglines , a free web-based aggregator.  You can subscribe to my blog by entering the following URL into Bloglines or other readers that support the Atom format.  http://www.clifjohnston.com/siteFeed/atom.xml

						      We loved the Scions so much that we bought 2, an xA for me and an xB for my wife. The xA should be a great commuter car for me, and it's fun and sporty, too.      My wife fell in love with the xB and we're looking forward to hitting the road on Thursday in our new camouflage milk truck. :)     Thanks to Sunny at Bob Bridge for hooking us up.

						   So I took my wife back to the lot today to test drive an xB and we ended up putting a deposit down. Hopefully we will drive it home on Tuesday.

						   Yesterday I took my wife's Corolla in to the dealer for service in preparation for our upcoming roadtrip to Montana. Since I had about an hour to kill, I walked around the lot and checked out some of the new models. The coolest rides on the lot were the new Scion xB's. These new mini-mini-vans are functional enough to be smart and futuristic enough to be cool. And they get fairly decent gas mileage (30 city / 34 highway) for a box on wheels.  The xB (and it's little brother the xA) comes standard with most of the things you'd pay extra for in other models, and with a base price of $14,995 (automatic) it's priced comfortably for most entry-level car buyers. The paradigm of the Scion line is that dealers won't keep many on the lots. Instead, buyers are advised to go to the website and configure their car with any of 40 custom accessories, print out the specsheet, and bring it in to the dealer. Pricing is standardized, so the price you get on the website is the price you get on the lot. My man-on-the-lot John warned that there is NO negotiation, as there is very little markup for the dealers.  Tech-heads will love Scion's online configurator, which allows you to see the parts being installed as you choose them. There are some really cool options, like LED floor lighting, cupholder lighting, racing pedals, and color-coordinated shiftknobs and steering wheels. It seems like these vehicles are tailored for the  Fast and Furious  inspired twenty-somethings, but my man John was quick to point out that he has yet to sell one to anyone under 45.  Check out the  urlLink Scion  site for more info.

						   The recent big scare with IIS and Internet Explorer security issues prodded me to start looking for real alternatives to IE, and at the suggestion of a coworker I decided to try Opera. I must say I'm impressed, amd if I can get past the few plug-in issues I've encountered, I don't see any reason to go back. Version 7.5 is intuitive and blows IE out of the water as far as functionality is concerned. I love how new pages open in the same application instance, as opposed to IE's taskbar-hogging strategy. And the fact that it's not being targeted by every virus lab out there is a plus.  Check it out at  urlLink http://www.opera.com

I've been drafted to work the counters and Justin is outside waving down cars in a Merlin costume.  For those of you savvy enough to subscribe to blogs, my Atom file can be found  urlLink here .

						         So I'm sitting at Doofer's Tavern waiting on 3 orders of wings and posting this using my Blackberry. Isn't technology great!?!    I just finished my first class at the University of Phoenix. I attended the class,&nbsp; Skills for Lifelong Learning, 100% online using newgroups in Outlook Express. Anyone who thinks online classes are a cakewalk obviously hasn't gone to UOPOnline.    In addition to the standard reading and assignments, students are also given team assigments and assigned to a learning team. Communicating with 3 other students through newsgroups to complete assignments on tight deadlines is quite a challenge. Still, it's amazing to be able to attend school full time while working 50 or so hours a week in my career. It's like living two lives at once.    With work and school, I haven't had a lot of time to focus on music lately, but I am getting ready for a big house concert for my wife's birthday around the middle of July. I'm also looking forward to doing some recording toward the end of the year after we get the new studio built out at work.    Justin, my 12 year old is out of school for the summer and we're heading out next Thursday for a short getaway in Montana.    Wings are done...more later.    --------------------------  Clif Johnston

						   If you've been to my website before, you may notice that things have changed a bit. I have decided to make a fresh start on my site, with a more holistic approach to me as a person as opposed to a strict focus on my music. If you're looking for MP3s of my songs, or any of the other info that was on the site in the past, please be patient as it will take a little time for me to incorporate all of that stuff back into the site.  More soon...

						   I'm a little less than pleased with Blogger's new  urlLink WYSIWYG functionality , because apparently it doesn't apply to  urlLink Opera  users. Now I can't even preview my posts. Here's a copy of the comment I sent to the folks at  urlLink Google . If you're having similar issues, please let 'em know.    "Like scores of other web-savvy folks, I ran away from IE screaming about a month ago. My browser of choice is now Opera. For whatever cross-browser incompatibility reason, I don't see the new WYSIWYG interface, and what's more, I've lost the ability to preview posts altogether. This is true even when I set Opera to report itself as IE, so I'm assuming it's an ActiveX thing. Anyway, it's unfortunate. Paired with a less than wonderful comment system (I'm being nice 'cause I love Google) and lack of other standard blogging features (aka Trackback and Categories) this is almost enough to send me packing. :("

						      This weekend we had a big party for Rachel's birthday. Thanks to everyone who came (all 40-50 of you), especially the musicians. Here are a few of the guests, in no particular order:               The party happened in two main installments, one from noon to 4:40 PM and the other from 5:30 to 10:30. Barbecue services were provided by yours truly (aka the Grill Seargent):     The first half of the day included the standard lung capacity test:     Entertainment was provided by the self-dubbed Rachel Smith Birthday Trio Plus One, organized by my friend Troy Kendrick (the bassist):     For the evening entertainment,  urlLink Charlie Spring  and I traded songs playing mostly original material:     This was the first time Charlie and I ever shared the stage (or gazebo) together, but hopefully it won't be the last. The birthday party proper finished up with a bit of Karaoke. Here are a few incriminating photos:       Here's a picture of Paul, who somehow avoided being caught on camera while singing Karaoke:     The post-party karaoke party started around 11 PM and lasted until 4:30 AM.

						   I lost my wallet tonight and I am pretty much freaking out. This is not an experience I would recommend. All my credit cards, debit cards, driver's license, insurance cards, social security card, etc. were neatly tucked inside a tiny leather container that is no longer in my possession.  Luckily, it's a fairly easy task to shut down your credit cards, but of course that leaves you without access to funds for 7-10 days while they get a new card out to you. I personally rarely carry cash, so making it through the next week or so without a debit card is going to require conscious effort.  The other freakish thing is realizing that most of the documentation I have that proves who I am is in that wallet. I have to go to the DOL tomorrow to replace my license and I have none of the documents on their A or B lists. I do have a military ID from 10 years ago, tax returns, my work ID, etc., so hopefully there's enough to get them to say, "alright, already, we believe you."  On the positive side, I'm really not worried about the financial aspects of the loss. There was approximately $17 in cash which I will never see again, but the credit cards are worthless. I worry more about the possibilities of identity theft with a copy of my ID and social security card floating around out there. Hopefully the wallet was picked up by some dumb punk who will take the cash and toss the wallet, or better yet, some responsible citizen who will return it.

						   One concept that has appealed to me since I started reading SciFi in my preteen years is the idea of immortality through technology. We're not quite to the point of transferring consciousness to a microchip or replacing our mushy bodies with more resilient cyborg ones, but the invention of online communities, message boards, blogs, and personal websites has given average folks a means to freeze some version of themselves in time. So the questions is raised, for us webfaring folk, what happens when we die?  I ran across a few interesting articles, starting with  urlLink this one . I'll let you follow the links.

'Wise crowds' need (1) diversity of opinion; (2) independence of members from one another; (3) decentralization; and (4) a good method for aggregating opinions." —Publisher's Weekly

						   Last night was quite an adventure in the hotel room with the two dogs and the fireworks going off. We finally had to turn on the TV to cover some of the noise, but the dogs still freaked out at least once an hour. As an added bonus, we got to listen to British comedy and anime all night which made for some interesting dreams.  Keeping with the red rocket theme, we discovered this morning that Chai is in heat and Mochie's raring to go, which should make for an interesting trip home in the confined space of the Scion.  We stopped at Denny's for breakfast hopefully we'll be home by mid-afternoon.

						   We tried to remain a bit spontaneous on Saturday and ended up missing out on a couple of tours because all the movers and shakers had made reservations. We did check out the Farmer's Market and the World Museum of Mining in Butte and enjoyed a scenic ride back to Pipestone on Highway 2, which is mostly paved. We had a phenomenal dinner of Filet Mignon at a place called Land of Magic Too in Butte - highly recommended if you're in the area.  We ate 4th of July breakfast with the rest of the campers and headed out about 9 AM for Idaho. About 2 hours into the trip I realized I still had the keys to the cabin in my pocket. Oops...I sure hope they have a copy. I'll have to send them next day air when I get back home. Based on the first part of this journey, we decided ahead of time not to try and make the trip in one day and made reservations for a pet-friendy hotel in Coeur d'Alene. We arrived here around 3. Luckily, they have wireless internet, so I was able to complete and turn in all my assignments on time.  We plan on getting out of here early tomorrow and arriving at home by early afternoon which will give us time to unpack and unwind before hitting the wheel on Tuesday.

						   So we finally arrived at the campground in Montana a little over an hour ago. We had originally planned on driving straight through and arriving Thursday evening, but we ended up spending the night in St. Regis.  I realized in Cle Ellum that I had left the power supply to my laptop on my desk. It's extremely difficult to find a Dell power supply and I spent hours on the phone with my network admin and Dell to find a solution. We finally figured out that Targus made a Universal Notebook AC Adapter the would work with my Inspiron 5100. I was able to locate one at CompUSA in Spokane.   The whole situation was fairly stressful because yesterday was the first day of my 2nd class, which is COMM 105, Introduction to Effective Communication. If I hadn't found a power supply, it would have completely derailed my first week of class.  Of course I was sure to test the power supply as soon as I got to the car. Everything seemed to work, and I set up my son to watch some DVDs for the rest of the trip. However, after about 2 1/2 hours (just about the amount of time my battery lasts fully charged), the computer hibernated and refused to wake up. When I turned the computer on today, I got a power warning saying that this computer doesn't support a 70 watt power supply. I called Dell, who assured me that it would be OK despite the fact that it was a little under-powered. After logging in to Windows, I checked and the battery was completely drained, although it's charging now and has made it back up to 40%. Not sure what happened yesterday, but I'm keeping a close eye on it.  The dogs did well on the trip, and the Scion was great. We got great gas mileage with the xB stuffed to the ceiling with bags and people. We were able to maintain good speed (70-80mph) even coming up the mountains. Unfortunately, the one thing that our $1100 extended super-duper platinum warranty doesn't cover happened about an hour into the trip. A truck threw a rock and damn near put a hole through the windshield. That's gonna cost us a $250 deductible. I'm hoping this is a fluke and not an indicator of future issues we might have with the almost perpendicular windshield on the xB.  Anyway, we got here and the cabins are great. We're looking forward to a few days of relaxation (and schoolwork). We'll probably leave on Sunday because recent experience has shown that we can't make the trip in one day.  I was able to log in to check on class, and of course I have like 2 or 3 assignments due tonight, so I guess I'll relax  after  I get those done and posted.  More later...

						         For some reason yet to be determined, our phone lines are dead. Unless Jason's setting us up for the kill, the phone company should (hopefully) be able to figure it out tomorrow. Meanwhile, we have no internet access and I'm having withdrawals, which is why I'm posting this from my Blackberry.

						   I'm always intrigued when I read something in the news that points to the kind of sci-fi future that geeks like me hope to witness in our lifetimes. The European Space Agency (ESA) is beginning to study ways to produce  urlLink human hibernation  for long-range space travel. The plan is to have a hibernation system in place for a manned mission to Mars in 2030.  Source:  urlLink Slashdot

						   This posting is a community experiment that tests how a meme, represented by this blog posting, spreads across blogspace, physical space and time. It will help to show how ideas travel across blogs in space and time and how blogs are connected. It may also help to show which blogs (and aggregation sites) are most influential in the propagation of memes. The dataset from this experiment will be public, and can be located via  urlLink Google  (or  urlLink Technorati ) by doing a search for the GUID for this meme (below).  The original posting for this experiment is located at: Minding the Planet (Permalink:  urlLink http://novaspivack.typepad.com/nova_spivacks_weblog/2004/08/a_sonar_ping_of.html ) --- results and commentary will appear there in the future.   Please join the test by adding your blog (see instructions, below) and inviting your friends to participate -- the more the better. The data from this test will be public and open; others may use it to visualize and study the connectedness of blogspace and the propagation of memes across blogs.   The GUID for this experiment is: as098398298250swg9e98929872525389t9987898tq98wteqtgaq 62010920352598gawst  (this GUID enables anyone to easily search Google or other search engines for all blogs that participate in this experiment, once they have indexed the sites that participate). Anyone is free to analyze the data of this experiment. Please publicize your analysis of the data, and/or any comments by adding comments onto the original post (see URL above). (Note: it would be interesting to see a geographic map or a temporal animation, as well as a social network map of the propagation of this meme.)  INSTRUCTIONS  To add your blog to this experiment, copy this entire posting to your blog, and then answer the questions below, substituting your own information, below, where appropriate. Other than answering the questions below, please do not alter the information, layout or format of this post in order to preserve the integrity of the data in this experiment (this will make it easier for searchers and automated bots to find and analyze the results later).

						   I ordered tires and wheels yesterday for my Scion. The wheels are 17" ADR Sokudo's and the Tires are Toyo Proxes 4's.      I'll post more pix when they're installed (hopefully Wednesday).  I also ordered personalized plates that say SCI-FI. Hopefully I'll get them fairly soon.  More later...
