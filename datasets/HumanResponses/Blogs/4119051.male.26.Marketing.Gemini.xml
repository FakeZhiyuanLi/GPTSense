      The new pick up line of the century:  man: I must say you're quite comeuppulant woman: What? man: I think your "end" is quite justified.  Somehow I got comeuppulance in my head even though that's not the word I was thinking of.  LushRain and I tried out the Beachers at Petco Park tonight. Row 8, seats 29,30. Not bad but any plays in LF or RF are obstructed as is 1/2 the video board. So we watched the first 4 innings there, walked around the park at the park, off to the Padres Store in the bottom floor of the Western Metal Supply Co. Building. We returned from the store just in time to see them go from 5-0 to 11-0. Nice. Stood at a table at Randy Jones BBQ with nachos and a lemonade watching the game on the big video screen behind the batters eye. We headed for the car during the top of the 7th. Listened to Mark Loretta's second homer of the night and Khalil's great play to end the game. Santana's...nice veggie burritos. Yum.  Came home to hear of the passing of Rick James. Strange. I know I should feel more than just, "So what?" but I don't. With all the bad things he did and the fact that I never personally knew him and never cared much for his music I just don't feel anything about this. Stick another icepack in my chest. I swear I'm really not cold hearted but I don't feel like I should force feelings there that just don't exist.  In the meantime I read an article by a good friend of mine at staticmultimedia.com Michael Tatum. Great guy. Was interested in what he had to say about the new Beastie Boys and Morrissey. A- and B. Not bad. Could be worse...Much. SO I could buy them or I could download them. Morals or money? Isn't how the world goes these days?  Well...off to bed. Gotta drive out to Agoura Hills tomorrow morning around 9am. WOW. I must get some sleep. Love you all and see you Monday.

      OK so I've finally awoken from my short slumber. Yeah that's right folks I got up this morning at 6:30 and I now regret it but here I am at work so what the hell. Can't go back now, right? Yeah so Butch and I finally hung out after a dozen years of being incommunicado. Let's see...how do I remember the evening? I'm sure he'll give his account over at butchrosser.blogspot.com (and once I learn how to make a sidebar with links I'll have one for y'all) but here's how I remember it: So I visit the in-laws to get that $300 loan from them (so irresponsible with money you know) and head over to meet Butch around 9pm. I drive into the complex and am promptly greeted with a "TENANT PARKING ONLY" sign. Ignoring the sign I park in an empty spot just praying the owner of said spot doesn't return home while Cricket is sitting there (Cricket's the car). Having a bit o' trouble finding the actual apartment I look up to see some guy peering into the parking lot and take the big guess that it's him. Upon finding out I was correct we say our hellos not know what the night has in store and we proceed to Brunswick Lanes in Rancho Del Rey. I proceed to have my worst night of bowling EVER. I swear to you 4 things made that possible. First and most guilty were the shoes. The soles had no slide in 'em and my fear of stumbling and tumbling down the lane forced me to change from my normal delivery and had me off center all night. Second The ring finger I use to push off on the ball hurt like a bitch for some reason and I wasn't comfortable there either. Couple that with nerves and my pants being just a bit too big for me and I never got comfortable on the lanes. OK I lie. I had 3 or 4 frames there in the second game where I found my groove and hit Spare after Spare. Otherwise Two games under 70 and a 112. NOT GOOD. So after three games I'm getting a bit sweaty and I'm a little frustrated so I declare bowling that night to be over. We return the shoes and were about to head to the bar nearby when I got the ingenius idea of heading to Moose McGillicuddy's. So we park at 6th and G in the little Ace Parking Lot in space 146 and make our way. Long do I forget this is now 10:30 at night and right after a game has gotten out. So we walk past the long line into Moose's and proceed to Fred Mexican Cafe instead. So here is where a lot of those stories just start to come spilling out. He hears about my first time being drunk, the incident at Tony's (forgot to mention the swimming on the carpet thing...my how little details get missed), typical high school drama (not much of it but a tad bit), and I get to hear loads of great and horrific stories of drunken moments and we share our 9/11 stories.  Trust me Butch you were right. That story DOES merit a free drink next time we hang. We sit and chow on food and drink until about midnight. We pay for our tab and head home. Once we pull into the parking lot I'm thinking "OK well here's the end of the night...do I walk him to the door?" Then I realize that's just crazy talk and we're all a little worried about him. Instead we sit and chat about video games, technology, the sound incident Memorial Day, and various other topics until about 2:20am. I get home at 3am...sleep came to me around 4am and the alarm rudely awoke me at 5am. I slept in until a little after 6am, took a shower and here I am. So my impressions of last night's re-reunion: 12 years? What 12 years? What are you talking about? This guy was my best friend throughout elementary school and when we hung out last night it was as if we'd never been apart. I know that sounds a little odd when two guy friends talk about each other but I swear it's all innocent. The only difference is that there is a big chunk of our lives that the other doesn't know about. It'll be good fodder for conversations as we hang out more. We have the same sense of humor and our core personalities are the same. The difference there is we've grown up so we're smarter and more mature. Not more sane, mind you. Just more mature. So I think either next Thursday or Friday we'll be seeing each other again. This time I'll pick him up and transport him to my place where he'll get to meet LushRain and sample her great cooking (if she'll agree to it...haven't exactly asked her yet). Should probably do it Friday so that this time if it runs until 3am or whatever it's no big deal because no one has work the following day. I tell you. Right now I need a pillow and Nidol will not be required. Until tonight y'all. Ciao

      Heading out to see Butch tonight. Haven't hung out with  the dude in like 10-13 years. We'll see how my bowling is holding out. In the meantime I sit here watching the Padres game thinking...when was the last time our offense was this anemic? WOW. Hitting with RISP has gone the way of the Complete Game and the Stolen Base. Oh well. Such is the fruits of life.  My English skills are limited so you'll have to forgive me. Actually you don't have to do anything. just read this and enjoy it cause you never know in life man. You never know how long you'll be around. You have to live like the next moment you'll be meeting your maker and answering for your life's choices. There's my deep thought of the day. Hey, it's better than F*ck off isn't it? Well I'm outtie so....F*ck off.

       Breakfast:  Grapes, Water, Trail Mix  Lunch:  Pad Thai at  Thai Table  in Oceanside  Dinner:  White Rice, Sesame Ginger Chicken breast. Salad with spinach, bacon, toppers, and 1000 Isle Dressing, some onion rings.   Hit of the Day:  Watched the Padres drop the opener in their series against the Phillies and watched the Cubs beat the Rockies. Should have exercised tonight and did not.  Tonight was chores night. Took out the trash, cleaned my filthy dining room and did laundry. Now I'm just sitting here bored at about 9:52pm waiting to go to bed. Kinda early for me but what the hey. Waiting for Butch to call but I'll get back to him tomorrow. Need to get in touch with Tony. It was his birthday Saturday. Oh well. We'll hang at some point. In the meantime I'm just relaxing and watching Last Comic Standing.

      OK now that you know me, why don't we say hello? HELLO!  Alright the past weekend we went to all three Padres games against the hated Dodgers. Well I don't really hate them. I'm more a baseball fan than a team fan so whatever. The first game was a 12-3 snorefest. The other two were AWESOME! Other than April 8th I'd say they were the best games I've seen in some time. Great defensive plays, late comebacks. My kind of baseball.  You know I'm sitting here typing and trying to be funny and amusing but I just don't feel it right now. You don't mind if I'm dry do you? Good cause that's how you're getting it. Dry and rough.  Music...saw tony play the Casbah July 26th as a member of Red Pony Clock. Bad set but I got the CD anyways and they're not bad. Kinda like late Beatles with some latin influences. Good stuff overall. Since I'm listening to just about everything these days. Alternative, Grunge, Indie Rock, 80's pop, R&B, new &amp; old punk, new & old rap, metal, folk pop, folk rock, ska, reggae, classical, Brit pop, goth, you name it. Even Drum &amp; Bugle Corps stuff.  Movies...want to see so many movies right now. Fahrenheit 9/11, Some Kind of Monster, The Village, The Manchurian Candidate, The Bourne Supremecy, Drum Corps International, Harold & Kumar go to White Castle, sorta wanna see King Arthur, The Terminal. Perhaps I'll see Napleon Dynamite.  Old movies I love...Pulp Fiction, Resevoir Dogs, Office Space, Kevin Smith stuff, Princess Bride, Kill Bill, LOTR, Harry Potter gets me (why?), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Pirates of the Caribbean, Willy Wonka, etc. Best horror movies include Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist. Blair Witch was scary when it first came out. Other movies I've enjoyed but haven't stuck as favorites include Jurassic Park, Titanic, Star Wars, the Nightmare on Elm Street series, and other stuff.  Still a Transformers freak. Will never accept anything other than Gen One though. If it ain't original it ain't Transformers no matter what the package says. I miss Thundercats too. GI Joe, M.A.S.K. and He-Man. Did we have some great cartoons in the 80s or what? Even ESPN was better from about 85-96 or so.  Miss the original Nickelodeon shows like Today's Special, Pinwheel, and most of all You Can't Do That on Television. even original Double Dare.  Alright enough reminiscning. See you tomorrow...

Killer Carne Asada!Also love Thai Table and Philadelphia's Best in Oceanside. Favorite Restaurant: The Prado. Hands down. Nobody even comes close.

Get along with your parents: Yeah still get along with both. Hasn't always been that way but right now I actually wish I talked to them more. I'm always the reason I fall out of touch with people. Like thunderstorms: I'd prefer the lightning shows that go with thunderstorms. Esp. on the CA/AZ border. Those storms get pretty wicked. Play an instrument: Trumpet very well, guitar satisfactorily, drums I can fake. Played Trombone and Euphonium in High School a bit but never got very good at either.  LAYER SIX: In the past month, have you... Drank alcohol: No alcohol in the last sixth months (edited Aug. 18th. I fell two weeks ago hopefully never to return).

Made out: Yeah just this afternoon. I tell you Victoria is such a great kisser. Too bad you'll never know. Gone on a date: Yeah. We went out of town and then home for some Olive Garden. 30 hours without sleep. First time I've tried that in quite a while. Gone to the mall: The only time I've been to the mall recently is to park at Horton Plaza for a Padres game. Eaten an entire box of Oreos: Just finished off a box and it took me a month to get through it. Eaten sushi: I wish. Love the stuff but haven't been to Sushi Deli in a while.

Never liked it. Never will. Made homemade cookies: HAHAHAHAH. Me bake? HAHAHAHA Gone skinny dipping: Nope. Trust me it wouldn't be a pretty sight. I'm not 105lbs anymore. I'm bordering on 280 now. Dyed your hair: No my hair isn't long enough. When it was longer I dyed it a few different shades of red. Stolen anything: No. If I can't pay for it, it wasn't meant to be.  LAYER SEVEN:Ever...

I always give it up in the end. Gotten beaten up: Not since I was 10 years old. I still remember that fight. We pretty much just beat on each other until we were both too tired to continue. Couple of wimps we were. Couldn't even knock the other one out or cause any lasting damage. Shoplifted: Again I haven't shoplifted since I was a youngin. Changed who you were to fit in: Tried that in Junior High and it didn't work. The moment I started being me I started being popular. So I stuck with what worked. People just like being around me. Not that I'm egotistical or anything.  LAYER EIGHT: Age you hope to be married: 21. Cause that's when I got married. Oh God...what have I done? j/k Numbers and names of children: Dude not only do you want my kid's name you want their number too? Why not just go looking for your dates at the local grammar school or have you already tapped that? No kids yet so go somewhere else with that. How do you want to die: Painlessly and in my sleep. Doesn't everyone? What do you most want to be when you grow up: I'm not grown up yet? Oh yeah that 80's Toys R Us jingle. OK I want to be a musician. I want to write LDS rock so that BYU Radio will stop playing that wanna be KYXY stuff. What country would you most like to visit: England. Don't know why. It's gray and sorta boring but it has all those castles and old history and stuff. One word to describe yourself: Conflationary  LAYER NINE: What do you look for in the opposite sex: a vagina. You can't be too sure these days. Best eye color: Who's to say what color is the best? Oh you want me to be the one? What if I don't want that kind of responsibility? I'm not answering this question because there's no right or answer. Best hair color: see above Short or long hair?: Depends on the girl. Some girls look great with one or the other. My girl looks best with either. Best height?: Again with this best stuff. My wife is 5'6". Is that good enough for you? Anyone 0'1" to 12'11" is great. Best weight: Dude you have got to stop obsessing with this word. I think this would be one that you could use to answer the IM question. I'd prefer if my wife and myself were 100 lbs lighter but that just isn't gonna happen right now. These things take time. For now I think she's sexy and I still tap that every other day or so. Best articles of clothing: gotta go with the socks. Nothing says sexy like a kinky pair of socks. NO? I'll go with skirt. If a girl has a nice long loose skirt on, it makes for easy access. Nothing wrong with that Best first date location: Somwhere near the coast during a pretty sunset. Great dinner near the beach and later...well...let your imagination flow. Best first kiss location: see above  LAYER TEN: Number of people I could trust with my life: Outside of family I'd say right now just two but it could grow or shrink any time. I have a lot of good friends so I guess we could expand that by quite a few but 2 stand out because we've been so close for so long and because of their proximity to me at this time. Number of CD's I own: hundreds. Don't make me go count. Number of piercings: none and never will Number of tattoos: none and never will Number of times my name has appeared in the newspaper: Not since High School and even then I'm not 100% sure. I know I have talked to reporters since then but nothing I've said has ever made the paper. Number of scars on my body: plenty. Thought I was a slick dude on my bike as a kid. Things in my past I regret: treating my parents so bad in high school. Losing touch with some good friends I had as a kid. Wasting 8 years in the church (still not temple worthy). Some mean things I said about people I've worked with over the last few years. I don't know them enough to make those types of judgements.

      But listen closely. Not for very much longer.  OK enough of that or I'll forget to be nice. Butch called last night. After reading the quick blog he posted I wish I'd gone. I was given permission but somehow felt, "Hey if we can get together tomorrow it'll be fine." Kinda glad I took that road cause I was really tired I just didn't know it. Once my head hit the pillow at about 10pm I was out.  So...got Butch to see tonight, Tony tomorrow, Anaheim Saturday & Sunday, the sister coming to stay for all next week, and I've got no weekends free until September 11th. (insert scary music here)  Just keeping my life in order sometimes can be a chore in and of itself. Like remembering to put the "d" on "and". Now I've got to go clean up these records for our Dallas run so we can get them into our system and start reaching these people. Well until next time keep your body parts where they belong. Having one's foot on one's head is not polite. So you can kiss your own arse so long as your lips don't stay there. Or your arse for that matter. Depends on what you're bringing to what.  OK I've lost you. That's the perfect time to say good bye.   Recent Music listened to:  Beastie Boys "To the 5 Boroughs" and "The Blackest Album" by various artists.  Most frequented radio station:  BYU Radio  Most frequented TV program:    A History of Britain with Simon Schama  Movie I last saw:  Elephant  Movies I most want to see:  Fahrenheit 9/11, The Village, Harold &amp; Kumar go to White Castle

      Has anyone seen this website?  urlLink www.qsleeper.com  It's an odd little site for paranoiamaniacs. The bed does look kinda cool though.  Had a great weekend. Here's a brief synopsis:  Friday: Padres game. Won 13-1. we sat in the "Beachers" in right center field. Great place to sit but we couldn't see most of the balls hit deep to RF or LF. Otherwise it was all good. We got up in the 4th to check out the park at the park with more detail. Tried a Randy Jones Pork Sandwich. Pretty good. I still am partial to the Nachos. We hit up the Store and just cruised around parts of the ballpark that we haven't spent much time in. Mostly we know 3rd base around home plate to the 1st base side. The stuff in the oufield we haven't explored much. It was a lot of fun. Saturday: Headed out to Jennifer and Alex's. Stopped off to pick up Andrea. I'll explain more about them later with their permission but since I haven't asked yet I won't add anymore than Jenn is my cousin about a month older than me. Alex is Jenn's new husband though they've been together for quite a while. Andrea is Jenn's younger sister. About 21 I think. Anyways we all went to 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica, CA. Great little shopping district. We ate at the Broadway Deli. Decent food, OK service, average prices. My body hates grease but I got a Patty melt anyways. Paid for it and felt the pains all day. Went back to Jenn and Alex's for dinner. We ordered Thai food from Westlake Village Thai. Good place to take out food but Alex says it's not a great place to dine in. Service is slow. Anyways the food is tremendous so I didn't care. We all played Turbo Cranium and I won't say more than we were all having a grand time and the Girls beat the Guys. Sunday: Woke up and Jenn fixed a stupendous breakfast. Omelettes, melons, vanilla yogurt with cinnammon, toast with apricot jelly, great home fried potatoes with peppers and onions and Orange Juice. Lots of food but all relatively healthy. We went out to the Getty Museum. GREAT PLACE! Lots of stairs so it was a bit physically demanding for one who doesn't exercise much but the exhibit halls were mind-boggling. Great paintings, photographs, gardens, views of LA and even furniture and dishes and the like. Statues, vases, clocks, beds, tables, bureaus, tapestries, desks, etc. Lots of stuff. I loved it and I'm not really one for art but I do have the ability to appreciate it for what it is and therefore I really really want to go back. We went back to the house and headed to Sharky's for Mexican Food. Sharky's is pricy and I don't think the food is that good but I was hungry so I ate it. Also Jenn likes it so much and i didn't want to make her feel bad. I don't know if it was what I did Saturday night or ate Sunday afternoon but Sunday night I was having a rough time of it. Bathroom and Bedroom were it for me and neither room was pleasant. No more details. You don't want it anyways.  Took the day off today to get better. I still don't want to eat and my stomach is still cramping on me or turning over from time to time but I think (hope) I'll be ok tomorrow. I slept most of the day and spent the rest either IMing LushRain and Rachel or watching The History of Britian with Simon Schama. Great show that.  Anyways...My body is telling me it's time to go. I'll be back...

      Well today could be the start of a new spirit here or it could just be how I'm feeling right now.  Watching BYU-TV via online streaming. It helps at work for me to keep my mind on good things and I consider the things shown on BYU-TV good things. Here is what I've gotten from it today:  I want to start a real journal. I want to spend a 1/2 hour documenting past events in my life and another 1/2 hour writing about today. I want to spend another 1/2 hour on genealogy. ALong with the 1/2 hour scripture study and 1/2 hour physical exercise in the morning, this will fill my day with goodly things. I want to schedule Family Home Evening one night, a date with my wife another night, and a family activity night a third night. Sundays are church days and that night we could have Family Discussion Time where we talk about what each person learned that week, what happened good and bad and what each person needs. Then combine it all and find what the family needs to focus on in the coming week. We could also discuss then whether our goals for the previous week were met, how they were met, and how we feel about it.  I think it will all bring our family together, genealogy and journals will help set our place in family history and help us realize who we are and of what we are made. Scripture time will strengthen our spirit while physical exercise will strengthen our body. Victoria and I both are in a constant search for new knowledge and that search helps strengthen our minds. These FDTs will help strengthen our emotional state as well as our family as a whole. Wow just used "as" three times in a single sentence. I'm sure that could have been worded better. Oh well.  Today I feel really bad. This morning on my way to work I hit a rabbit. Driving towards it I though it was just a paper bag or some sort of trash that was in the lane so I swerved to avoid it. No other traffic was on the street around me. Just as I got to it, the paper bag became a rabbit which got up and darted in front of the car. When it did this I couldn't have been more than 5 feet from it and going 45 mph I had no time at all to swerve though I really tried to at least keep it under the center of the car and not under a tire. This, I thought, would give it the best chance to live through the experience. Unfortunately in my state of hurry and panic I drove off and didn't even look back so I'm not sure what happened to it. I'm very sad because I feel not only like I killed it, but that I didn't stop or go back to try and help. I thought about it and made a conscious choice against it. That makes me feel even worse now. Victoria says there's not much I can do now so to just pray for forgiveness (which I've done) and for the rabbit's health (which I've done) and that's all I can do. It still hurts though. I hurt one of God's creatures. Human or animal it still hurts me.  Anyways...all that is on my mind today. Take care everyone and pray for the rabbit.

      OK...Weekend of August 14-15...San Diego to Anaheim to Montclair to San Diego.  Saturday we headed to Anaheim for what was supposed to be a great weekend celebrating our anniversary. As we started out LushRain wanted to check the mail and the California Department of Motor Vehicles...or rather the Division of Mortal Victims as I formerly referred it (actually I came up with that this very minute) decided to give us an annniversary gift. Apparently I paid my car registration twice. So they kindly wrote me a check and sent it mine way. Yippy! We'd actually end up spending most of that this weekend.  Traffic heading up to Anaheim was atrocious. How the heck is there stopped traffic north of Oceanside where there is NO off ramps, NO cities, NO Houses, NO stores, NO NOTHING!!! I also can understand people slowing down during a traffic jam to let cars safely onto the freeway or safely change lanes, but people there is no excuse and I MEAN NO EXCUSE for stopping on a freeway for ANY other reason than the car in front of you comes to a complete stop and you must in order to avoid hitting them. Otherwise I want to see your car moving because I want MY car moving.  Hit the Rainforest Cafe and had what must have been just a fluke of service. I've been there about 4 or 5 times always with excellent service. This time we sat there for 45 minutes before we got our food. Meanwhile everyone around us that was seated AFTER us had their meals and were half done before we got started. The orangesicle. YUMMY! That's it. I tipped quite low for my usual standard (I gave the guy 4 and change for a 35 and change bill). The only time I've tipped lower is the 42 cents I gave the waitress at Fat City in San Diego for a 32 dollar meal on July 26th.  We went out to the Angels game right after dinner. It was against the Tigres. Yes I spelled that just how I wanted. Let me say Angels Stadium is nice. It's not better than PETCO I don't think but the fans are 100000 times better. I guess since the Padres moved downtown it's now considered "uncool" or "out of style" to cheer your team on. It's much more cool to walk around, talk on your cell phone, or just overall not pay any attention to the game. Pretty pathetic when the only time you hear the crowd get loud is when the scoreboard tells them too. I swear if we were down a run with the bases loaded and no one out in the bottom of the 9th and our scoreboard operator forgot to hit the "GET LOUD" button the Padres fans would still be sitting there silently watching the game...just waiting for it to get over. Obviously it's more cool to be seen at the game than it is to be a fan watching and cheering. It's pathetic. And people wonder why the Padres have a hard time winning at home? Anyways the ballgame was a homer fest with Chone (pronounce Shawn apparently) hitting the would be game winning homer and K-Rod striking out 5 in One and two-thirds innings. He came on in the 8th with one out and the bases juiced. Struck out the next two and then retired the side in the ninth. Great game. Great fans. Great stadium. I love Petco Park but I miss Qualcomm. At least the TRUE baseball fans showed up there. I haven't seen 'em much in the new place.  After the game we headed to the Denny's on Harbor Blvd by the Disneyland. Wasn't hungry but had a Philly Melt anyways. Pretty good for a Denny's. Service was the best I've had there ever. Don't get too excited that's really not saying much as I've NEVER had good service there and this service was acceptable. 7 out of 10 vs. the usual 2 or 3. So I can't complain right? After a good romp in the hay while watching west wing (what is wrong with us?) we fell asleep.  Sunday morning we got up in great spirits and headed to the House of Blues for their Gospel Brunch. Let me tell you that buffet was by far the best I've EVER had. Jumbalaya, eggs, bacon, sausage and biscuits, fried catfish nuggets, waffles, chicken, fruit of all kinds, shrimp, bread pudding, meats of all kinds, potatoes, veges, etc. WONDERFUL how it all just seemed to melt together on my tongue so well. About 11am the "gospel" part started. Now it's not what you think. There were no large mass choir but there was a reverend screaming and singing and getting people excited. There was a trio of men singing great gospel songs. They got people up and clapping and twirling their napkins and dancing and all sorts of stuff. One gentleman in the crowd seemed like he had tipped back a few before the brunch. When they invited everyone on stage to dance he grabbed a mic and was dancing and singing with the guys and even tried to take the minister's mic from his hand. Weirdo. Other than that we had a ball.  Headed out to DOwntown Disney for some shopping and then over to the Queen Mary for their haunted excursion tour. Bad thing is the $8 tour we were expecting cost us $28. Good thing is that included an annual pass so we can go back whenever we want and all it costs us is parking which is $8. Some places in that ship are quite scary. I didn't really feel or see or hear anything that could be connected with any ghostly activity but everytime we came to a place I knew to be highly active with spiritual residue LushRain got splitting headaches. She described it as a great pressure on her head, like she was deep deep under water. Even when we were above water or in open spaces this happened. Just kinda weird. Anyways we enjoyed it.  That was pretty much our weekend. We headed to my mom's to pick up my 12 yr old sister Rachel who's staying with us. Always cool having her down. I don't spend as much time with her as I probably should but just having her around makes my week fly by. She's a cool kid. Anyways I'm tired so I should end this and get back to work. ciao compadres.
