      People like quick and snappy answers to questions these days, which explains a lot about how readily they embrace sound bites, catchphrases, and pre-fabricated belief systems.  So here's a quick, snappy sentiment - there is no god.  Moreover, the lack of a god's existence undermines the ethereal, imagined justifications for people's lifestyles, value judgements, and their overall tenuous hold on their own sense of purpose and self -worth.    For example, these sorts of beliefs continue to reinforce the ridiculously self-delusional idea that has spread through our society that "no one is any better than anyone else".  This is a completely irrational, disingenuously espoused notion of social altruism which serves no other purpose than to make people who are ugly, ignorant, or otherwise unsavory feel better about themselves.  Further, people who are NOT, at first glance, possessed of any of these characteristics still encourage the idea so that they won't be killed by an angry mob for being attractive or wealthy.    Example 1:  Most people are ugly, stupid, and doomed to be poor, and for all I know, I might be one of them.  The fact is, I accept this fact, and don't spend my time resenting those who are not.  I don't hate the rich, or the highly intelligent and educated, or the physically beautiful.  In fact, I'd prefer to be around them, in the hopes that it will help me improve my own life.    But most people don't do this.  They say, "god loves me and everyone else the same, and even though you're attractive, rich, and smart, you're still going to hell because you don't love Jesus."  Well, doesen't that just make them feel so much better!  You don't have to worry about the fact that you're ugly and stupid, because those smart pretty people who you resent so much will pay for it later!  But guess what:  They won't.  "Don't expect me to conform to your artificial, arbitrary standards of beauty!  I'm fat and hairy and gorgeous," they say.  No, you're not.  As Nikos Kazantzakis said, "Beauty is merciless.  You do not look at it, it looks at you and does not forgive."  That means you're ugly!  You can either do what's possible to make yourself look better, or you can shut the fuck up.  But either way, standards of beauty are NOT arbitrary.  You fat, hairy bastard, you know you think the models on TV and in magazines are hot.  That's because they are.  Whether or not you'll ever look that way is not a societal conspiracy.    It's this paradox of worship, envy and resentment that forms a fundamental dissonance in our society.  We raise celebrities, politicians and public figures to deity-like status, profess our admiration for them, put their pictures on our walls... but after a while, one of two things happens.  Either they reveal themselves to be as inherently depraved and flawed as everyone else, or they unapologetically work to demonstrate how different they are from the rest of us, reminding us how unattractive and flawed WE are.  In either case, we delight in subsequently tearing them down; dethroning and shaming them.  How we love to see the mighty fall - but we're the ones who put them there!  What did we expect?  A god?   There is no god.  No perfection, no perfect plan, no ordered love for all with justice for the meek.    Now, do I need to go into a philosophical and metaphysical explanation of why there is no god?  Well, I'm not going to, because the reasoning is self-evident, and is hung on the nails of logic and objective thought.  If you're a theist and you wish to debate me, I invite you to, but this post is not for the purpose of disproving the existence of god; that's already been done many times over.  It's purpose is to expose the correlation between god beliefs and the silly, self-delusional ideas about ourselves and our society that we all carry.    Example 2:  Most people are stupid, and willfully ignorant.  That said, there are still people out there who are smarter than you, and there always will be.  There are kids right now in 8th grade who are smarter than you.  Deal with it.  This whole flap about closing the acheivement gap is moronic.  The acheivement gap exists because MOST people are dumb, and a FEW people are really smart.  You can't close that gap, idiots!  Lawmakers and bleeding hearts think that by spending tons of money on 'alternative programs' for education like teaching kids multplication through rap, they can show that everyone is equally intelligent.  Bill Gates isn't a trillionaire because he got lucky, it's because he's smart.  The guy in his high school class who is now mopping floors wasn't "just as smart" as him.  That guy isn't mopping floors just because he didn't "have the right learning environment".  Now we have schools abolishing A.G. and A.P. classes so that the stupid kids won't have to be reminded that they aren't as smart as someone else.  Why?  If you see kids in an AP class and envy them, wouldn't you work harder to acheive that goal?  Apparently not.    Apparently the best way to feel good about yourself is to say, "No one is any better than anyone else".  Just like, "Jesus loves us all the same and we're all equal in heaven."  Guess what?  You're wrong.  There are people out there better than you, and if it pisses you off that much, get to work.  Otherwise, accept your place.  There is no god.  Start coping.  All there is is what you can do with what you've got.  And if you ain't got much, work to make it more.  But stop trying to equalize everyone to make it look like you've got a lot.  You're hurting my goddamn ears.

      I remember a time when, while listening to the radio, I could feel as far removed from all the talk about the economy, the current administration, and the consumer/investor confidence ratings as I still do from stories about Rwandan genocide.  It meant as little to me as a story about a hurricane leveling a Floridian suburb - that sucks, but I'm unaffected, and as such, I don't care.    No more.  I am officially a casualty of our current economic conditions, for which we have to thank many factors; the largest of which is surely a big, silly WAR which is burning money at a rate so alarming that investors, and thus companies which employ people like me, are scared shitless to do anything but hoard what resources they have left, fire everyone who doesen't support the weight of their office ceiling with their own bodies, and wait for it all to pass.  It's like submitting resumes in a post-apocalyptic job market - bands of desperate foragers build crude shanties, and defend their piles of crumbs by grunting and shaking spears at everyone who passes by.  It's monster.com meets Mad Max.    Having been unemployed for awhile now, I've reached the point where I'm nearly qualified to go on talk shows as a guest expert on the job market.  I can predict patterns of behavior in response times of employers (which is easy because generally there IS no response), how long they take to review resumes, interview, review again, interview again, and the ENTIRE time leave you hanging, waiting haggardly for the phone to ring, only to hear upon calling them yourself, "My boss hasn't gotten to look at all the resumes yet.  When I know something, you'll know something."    This is, of course, if you're lucky enough to even GET an interview to begin with.  I've submitted to local employers over 275 resumes at this point, by my own estimation.  (I suppose I should mention here, just to cover it, that my resume is extremely impressive.)  I've had a total of 6 interviews, out of a grand total of 10 replies to the literal flood of emails, faxes, and snail mails that I've sent out.  They don't even have the decency to tell you that they GOT your resume anymore.  They don't even bother to tell you that you suck and that they don't want you.  You just hear silence.  NOTHING.    This is a new phenomenon.  It bears no resemblance whatsoever to the market I entered after college - this is a scary, desperate, down and dirty, rude job market, where anything goes - and they'll string you along until they figure out how to pay you the least amount of money when, what they fail to realize is, we're all working cheap these days.    More later.
