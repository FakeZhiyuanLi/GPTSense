      Hey all, it's Amy Lynnette.  First, a little about ME~I'm currently a full-time graduate student at the University of Illinois at Springfield, working on my M.A. in Political Science.  Surprisingly enough, I'm starting to like Springfield, although it's taken some adjustment.  I'm taking a graduate seminar in Poli-Sci, and American Constitutional Law and Civil Liberties. The grad seminar is boring as hell, but con law is a lot of fun.  In addition, I'm interning with Congressman John Shimkus (IL-19) approximately 15 hours a week.  When I'm not in class or at the office, you can find me working at the mall.  All in all, I'm EXTREMELY busy.    I did my undergrad (in Poli-Sci) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which is just over an hour away from my new home.  I absolutely loved it there! I spent most of my free time involved in College Republicans (External-VP), working at the B-E front desk, volunteering for various political campaigns and putting up yard signs ALL over the quad, sampling the drink specials at all of the fabulous campustown bars ;) and just hanging out with the greatest friends in the world. :o)  I try to go back and visit as much as I possibly can, seeing that I have a great deal of friends still there.  Even though I've met new people and found new places to hang out here, nothing compares to friends I left behind, and the great times we have had and still have together.  And no bar can ever compete with Murphy's.  It's just as simple as that.    Moving on, I'm originally from Centralia, Illinois, a small town in Southern Illinois.  If you haven't heard of it, chances are, you aren't missing much.  If you HAVE heard of it, you have my deepest sympathy!-lol :o) I graduated from CHS in 1999.  My favorite activities in high school were being a full-fledged band nerd (section leader), editor of the newspaper, FBLA v.p., Spanish Club, etc., in addition to terrorizing the town with my fellow band rats after competitions on the weekends.  My parents and younger sisters are still in Centralia-Jami is in 8th grade, and Lori is heading for UIUC next year to study Computer Engineering.  My parents both teach high school.    Anyway, with all that out of the way-since I'm in grad school now, and away from most of the people near and dear to me, I figured this is the best way of letting everyone know what's going on.  My posts will probably be quite boring a great deal of the time, but at least you'll all know what's happening! :o) Take care and I'll post again soon...

      OMG.    What an evening.  I think that I can safely say that I won't be having any more dinner parties w/ the Chambanaites anytime soon, at least not ones that include the company of Dan, Joe, and Donald TOGETHER-when they are by themselves, they're fine, but the three of them TOGETHER have proven to be more than I could take.   For the dinner party, I cooked a lovely dinner for everyone, chicken Parmesan, garlic bread, Caesar salad, tiramisu, red wine-and it turned out fabulous, I think it was well received. Things actually seemed mature and dignified for awhile, but it wasn't meant to last-I mean, who are we dealing w/, after all?  Things went downhill as soon as the greygoose and absolut made their appearances.  Those, in addition to Dan and Joe's gift of Franiza boxed wine-the consumption of these beverages made the evening one of the most hilarious, infuriating, and memorable ones that you could probably ever imagine.  After sitting around my kitchen table and trying to prevent the boys from lighting napkins on fire, (candles=BAD IDEA!) the boys decided my living room was quite boring and needed decoration-if that's what you would call it.    My living room, for one brief shining moment on the evening of January 9th, was turned into a fort.  The destructive forces I like to call Dan, Joe, and Donald proceeded to take the furniture in my spotlessly clean apt., and construct an elaborate fort that they claimed would protect me and my roommates from the pedofiles and rapists of the world (in addition to dirty UIS boys).  But, the fort wasn't enough, apparently.  When my roommate Heidi, Joe, Meghann, and I decided to go on a run for more, er, beverages, I made the mistake of letting Dan, Donald, and Diller behind-a group that I'll now refer to as the Triple-D Destructive forces.  Anyway, when we returned, I was mildly alarmed to find the lights in my apt out, but assumed it was just the boys goofing off.    Goofing off is far to tame of a term to use when it comes to describing just WHAT they did to my place.  If I hadn't found it just so ingenious and demented and hilarious, I swear I would have killed them.  They had RAIDED my coat closet and decorated the entire apt. with toilet paper-we're talking hanging from ceiling fans, strewn on the floor-everywhere.  Dan and Donald were seated underneath the fort and were waving coat hangers in the air, while Diller pretended to be passed out/dead in one of the chairs.  (They told me later that they had wanted to put ketchup on him to give it the aura of a horror movie, but had decided to draw the line-WISE decision) They had also dragged out my vacuum and turned it on full blast to add to the weirdness and hysteria.  Finally, they had taken pages from my roommate Liz's flip chart and decorated the upstairs balcony.  If it had not been there, right in front of my eyes, I wouldn't have believed it.  The worst part was, as mad as I was at them for destroying my apt., I couldn't help but laugh because GOOD GRIEF-I mean, they built a fort.  If you don't believe me, I recommend to track down Joe Worobey and have him show you the pictures he took, (tragically, my disposable camera was lost in the shuffle) because that's really the only way you'll believe it.    So after the excitement of the fort, and the initial humor, I proceeded to become pissed that the kiddies had wrecked the apt.  Snaps go to my new roommate Heidi, who JUST moved in yesterday, and the fact that she didn't even know me well, and didn't know my friends, and she was so cool about the entire situation is amazing.  While the destructive trio plus Meghann proceeded to do...(well, I'm not sure what they did, aside from Dan sneaking into my room and putting porno wallpaper on my computer)...whatever, I, having gotten tipsy by now off of my couple of glasses of wine, proceeded to get into a long, drunken, conversation with Diller which finally ended at 4:30 a.m.-I'm just going to say that Diller is one of the best listeners I know, and I am so lucky to have such great friends.  There's this *thing* I'm going through right now, something that has been bugging me, big time, since last year, and he's probably the only person that can truly understand both sides to this situation, and hopefully not think I'm being ridiculous.  It just felt so good to once and for all to get it off my chest, and get advice.  Many thanks to Diller for once again, being there for his friends.    Meanwhile, I took the first step in trying to reconstruct a friendship with a certain person, but I must say that I think it failed miserably, and I really don't think that I have the time and energy to deal with this particular person anymore. I'm perfectly comfortable hanging out in a social atmosphere, but that's where it ends. I know friendships aren't easy, but this particular situation has gotten to a point of ridiculousness that I can't handle anymore.    So-that is the tale of the happenings at my uber-crazy dinner party.  In the beginning, I was kind of disappointed that some of my Centralia and Springfield friends couldn't make it, BUT-looking back, it's probably a good thing if you think about all of the nonsense that occurred.  All in all, it was quite the interesting evening.  With that said I'm going to go home to Centralia for the rest of the weekend, but I had to write about this before I forgot the details, so the whole world can have a record of just how insane last night was.  more later folks-Amy Lynnette's outta here.   P.S. I GOT MY INTERSHIP! I rule. All in all, with the exception of one certain thing-life is good, and it's getting better all the time. :o)

      I am quite exhausted.  My sleep schedule is seriously messed up, and classes haven't even started yet. It's taken less than a week for this to happen, and it's all FB's fault. And I can't go to sleep yet, bc if I do, I'll wake up at some insane hour like 2 a.m., and I'll end up watching infomercials until my alarm goes off at 4 a.m.  I hate them I hate them I hate them!!!....Ok, enough of that. I'm not going to be there much longer, so I'll enjoy the few perks of the job while I can...After-Christmas sales rock my world.  I've spent the afternoon running errands, and now I'm planning the menu for my dinner party tomorrow...I think I'm going to attempt making tiramisu this evening, which goes against every diet rule I know of, but hey, it's for my friends.   Just because I'm suffering doesn't mean they have to, lol.   Not much else is going on now.  For the first time in a long time, I am kind of bored, bc most of my Springfield people are still out of town, including my roommate; if she was here right now, it is likely we would be sitting in the living room watching another stupid VH1 all-access show-it's become the A #1 guilty pleasure-unhealthy, but addictive.    Speaking of guilty pleasures, I have to say that in my opinion, the first episode of  The Real World San Diego    was absolute crap.  (you can tell I'm on break, seeing as I have time to watch this nonsense) The only cast member that I have observed to have any depth at all is Jacquese.  The cast members have no chemistry worth mentioning.  Once again, MTV has chosen cast members to fill specific roles:  the ditzy hot girl, the feisty minority girl, the odd one out, the token african-american, the Neanderthal frat boy, and finally, the free spirit.  Although MTV occasionally deviates from these stereotypical roles, the last Real World episodes have been fairly true to this standard, and I see this one as no different.  My only comment on the first episode is directed about Frankie:  what the H*LL is she doing smoking? She has cystic fibrosis...hi, a fatal lung disease, dangerous enough by itself, and still she decides to smoke.  I really don't understand people's logic sometimes (or lack thereof).    Since I've decided to talk about TV shows, I'm going to move on to my favorite TV show of all-time-Sex and the City!  There are only 7 episodes left so I'm kinda heartbroken.  However, it's had a great run, I recommend that everyone catches the last few episodes (even the guys, you could learn a thing or two! *wink*), even if you haven't been a show faithful.  Just to bring SATC loyalists up to speed, after this last episode I am still skeptical of the Miranda/Steve reunion, however, I'm convinced that Steve brings out a better side of Miranda. He has went out and made something of himself, which has made him comfortable w/ Miranda's career success, and meanwhile Miranda has come to face the shocking reality that she is in love with Steve (See episode 75), and finally had the guts to act on her feelings (See episode 86).  Being somewhat of a cynical b*tch myself (at times!), I definitely embrace the idea of a man who can make roll my eyes, but laugh while doing so.  Meanwhile, Carrie is still dating the handsome older man Alexsandar Petrovsky, but I must say that I agree with TV guide when saying that Carrie is destined to remain single. She's far too independent and has a penchant for the dramatic, which is why she hasn't managed to hold down a man thus far. We'll just have to wait and see how the series ends.  Finally, commitment-shy Samantha was lured back to the arms of the only man who broke her heart, Richard Wright-but only briefly.  While it appeared that things were over between her and her adoring Smith Jerrod, he proved to be the ultimate gentleman and was there for her when things crashed and burned.  *awwwwwwwwww* He's GORGEOUS, decent, and I hope Sam finally gives him the commitment he deserves and they end up happy together!   Ok, enough of my tv observations...I'm going to run some errands and hang out for awhile.  Catch ya on the flip side folks-I'll post again soon.

      Hey all, it's been awhile.  It's been quite some time since I posted. I had originally planned for this to be a regular thing, but my hectic schedule got in the way. I hope to keep up this semester, so ya'll can follow along with what is happening.    Since we've talked last, I have finished my first semester of grad school and completed my internship with Congressman Shimkus.  Classes went very well this semester.  I wholeheartedly feel (after one semester at UIS) that the Poli-Sci program here deserves more recognition, I've been very impressed w/ the professors and courses.  As far as my experience with Shimkus, I'd definitely say that the internship was worthwhile-it sucked that it was unpaid, but I learned a ton and made a lot of worthwhile contacts here in the capitol city. Wheeeeee...   Speaking of internships, I just got my first bitter taste of rejection. ARG. I applied for an internship w/ Cook-Witter, a well-respected lobbying firm here in Springfield.  I got an interview with them, and made it into the final round; however, they ended up giving the job to someone else. I, of course, was gracious on the phone, but was, of course, inwardly furious & upset. (being as self-critical and insecure as I am) However, Bruce of C-W told me that they had been very impressed w/ my resume, and had decided to forward it to one of their clients.     So, moving on, I had my interview with them today, and it went VERY well, unlike my C-W interview, during which I was fighting the flu.  Heather, the woman who interviewed me, seemed very impressed with my experience thus far, and told me that I came to to the interview very highly recommended by C-W.  It looks promising-so I'm keeping my fingers crossed. I'm realistic, though, and I won't get my hopes up.  If I get this internship, it will be extremely similar to the one w/ C-W, and will have me down at the capitol during session, sitting in on committee meetings, speaking on varioius issues, and doing research and writing.  In short, it's exactly the kind of experience I'm looking for!  Anyway, enough of that. *fingers crossed* Not much else is happening. Work sucks, bc of inventory, and the weather is freezing, but things are generally good.  I'm taking 12 hours this semester, (my first class is next Tuesday night) I'm getting a new roommate this weekend, and some of my pals are coming to visit on Friday.  Nothing much else for now...I'm going to make dinner and hang out for awhile...more later kiddies, peace out.

      Well, well, well.  Last semester, my biggest problem w/ my roommates was the fact that one of them (I won't mention any names) left green bean casserole remains on the stove for 3 days straight-yes, disgusting, I know.  I'll definitely say that I lucked out, esp. considering that I didn't even know these individuals I was rooming with!  I began to think that living in one of the campus townhouses wasn't such a bad idea after all...  Fast forward...Spring semester, 2004...  I have two new roommates.  One of them, Heidi, can be a bit interesting at times, we come from different backgrounds, obviously, but all in all she's a sweet girl and we get along well-and she's a clean freak, and an overall respectful roommate.  However, at the last minute, housing put ANOTHER roommate in-and she's a little hellion, that girl is.   First of all-she keeps all of her food in her room-which is fine, except for the fact that she comes down and eats ours (me, Liz, and Heidi all share food).  Second, her boyfriend is attempting to live w/ her while he finds his own place.  All I have to say about that is-it's not going to last much longer-the other three of us are going to go to housing and file a complaint.  Finally, she's just a bitchy person in general, and has a really bad attitude.  Take for example the other morning.  Being the EXTREMELY busy girl that I am, I got up for yet another long day, was cooking breakfast (I'm dieting, and if I don't eat in the morning, I'll end up snacking on something bad for me) and got a plate out of the cabinet.  No biggie-something I've done many mornings in a row.  However, the sound of the plate coming out of the cabinet was apparently too much for my roommate, (even though it was already 9:15 a.m.) and she came out of her room and very bitchily told me that I was making too much noise.  I kind of rolled my eyes when she went back in her room, but I tried really hard to be quieter (even though I WASN'T being freaking noisy!).  However, as I went to remove a pan from the dishwasher, it made a little creaking noise, and before I knew it, she was storming out of her room and complaining AGAIN.  I had had enough at this point, and politely but firmly informed her that I was NOT trying to make a racket-however, I had places to go and things to do, and that was that.  She proceeded to stomp back in her room, and the conversation was over.  Yeah. My other roommates thought it was bitchy, too.  Anyway, we're having dinner, the four of us on Monday night, to "discuss" things, and here's hoping we clear up some of these stupid issues.  Because I can live with a lot of things, but I CANNOT live w/ hypersensitive, hypocritical, disrespectful bitches.  I don't think I'm being unreasonable about this-everyone who knows me knows that I am a down-to-earth, easygoing person who gets along w/ 99% of the people I meet.  I don't have to be best friends w/ my roommates, but I DO have to co-exist peacefully.  Yet another reason why I'm living alone next year-I don't have to deal w/ unnecessary b.s. (And p.s., I found a FABULOUS apt. downtown-I'm so excited)  Oh-and another thing-she insists on leaving the thermostat at 70 degrees, in the WINTER! I explained to her that I want to save on power as much as everybody, but if the thermostat goes below 75 ever again, I'm gonna have an issue.  I don't want to bundle up like an eskimo just to sit and watch the freaking tv.    Anyway-enough of my roommate-bashing.  Hopefully we'll be able to get things cleared up on Monday.  Until then, I'm going out w/ some of my Springfield friends to Mowie's tonight, and going home to C-town tomorrow for the long weekend.    All in all, except for the roommate issue, things are good-that, and the fact that I feel very sorry for one of my friends right now, just bc of all of the unnecessary b.s. that has been piled on her.  Some people can be such disrespectful, unappreciative jerks-I have been in a similar position before :( and it blows. Big-time.  I'm just trying to be a good and loyal friend-bc in times like these, those are the only people she can depend on.  Arg.  Ok guys, that's about it for now.  Oh-and classes went really well-but I can tell already I'm going to be VERY busy this semester-last semester was a vacation compared to what's ahead.  In the words of my friend and fellow grad student Lesley-"Interning and work and thesis-OH MY!"

      Nothing too exciting today...I'm at home in Centralia right now, getting ready to head back to good ol' Springfield.  Classes start this week.  I'm taking graduate seminars in state and american politics, in addition to POS 502, graduate methods of inquiry (which ultimately is designed to help me write and research my thesis-ARG).  I have classes on t-w-th, all in the evening from 6:00-9:30 p.m., in addition to putting in about 15 hours a week at FB, and 3-4 days downtown interning.  Fun times are ahead, but my schedule is going to be even crazier than last semester...and last semester I was dangerously close to burning out. Let's hope I keep my wits about me. It's hard to believe that in less than a year, I'll have a master's degree and be out in the "real" world.  That is, unless I decide that I want to go on to law school or a Ph.D. program, (ideas which I've toyed with) but I imagine that if I do either of these things, it will be after a few years of working.  I'm just trying to open myself up to take advantage of all the opportunities I can while I'm here in Springfield, so that I can #1, build up my resume and #2, gain necessary experience.  That's the reason I came to UIS in the first place, and it has served me well thus far.    Anyway, I've recovered from Friday night, visited with the family, and now I'm going to head back to Spfld. and start on my application for ILSIP-it's due the first week of February.  More later...

      Have you ever had such strong feelings about something/someone that you just wanted to shout it from the rooftops, and felt like you would explode otherwise? That's just about how I feel right now. Yep.  Just when I think I'm becoming too jaded for words, something stupid happens to remind me that my feelings are genuine.  Arg.  I think I'm losing it. I always thought I had my life/emotions in perfect control, but I was WRONG!

      Hello again, everyone...   It's been awhile since I've posted, but not much has been going on.  My thoughts as I am finishing the second week of the semester is that things are definitely going to be crazy, in terms of schoolwork, but I've already established this.  My internship starts next week, and at that point, I imagine my friends and family will see me drop off the face of the earth.  The roommate situation is  slightly   better, at best.  My bitch roommate seems to expect all of us to be quiet whenever it suits her, despite the fact that she enjoys blaring her television until all hours of the night. That, and the insistence of my roommates to keep the thermostat at seemingly sub-zero temperatures-I wore a sweatshirt and sweatpants to sleep in last night, and I was covered by two blankets, and I was just barely comfortable. Ugh. Another one of my roommates  claims  to have the best intentions when it comes to her schoolwork, but the empty liquor bottles in the trash have since convinced me otherwise.  Meanwhile, Liz is her usual busy self, and thankfully, so am I, so I won't have to bear witness to the nonsense going on in my apt. most of the time this semester.  Thank God I'm getting my own place after this semester-I think I'd go insane otherwise.    Not much else is going on-tomorrow I actually have open until my class at six, and I plan on taking full advantage of that fact by sleeping in and then spending a couple of hours at the salon.  After class, I fully intend on kicking back and relaxing w/ some of my friends at Dempsey's...not my favorite Springfield bar by any means, but it will provide me an opportunity to de-stress before the hectic nature of the semester sets in.    Oh, and John Kerry came out on top after the Iowa caucuses, proving that this will indeed be an interesting Democratic primary.  I'm disappointed, because if any of the candidates pose a threat to W, I feel that it is Kerry, but at the moment, I think Georgie has enough momentum to beat out any of the potential Democratic nominees...but then again, it's only January...time will tell.    With that said, it's time to kick back and relax while I still can...thank you and goodnight.

       Memories...gotta love 'em    Current Mood:   Reminiscent   Current Song to convey mood:  Summer of '69   "The only thing that remains the same is that everything changes"  And the sooner you learn to realize this, the better.  It's amazing the clarity that comes w/ just one year's time.  A year ago, I was a senior at my beloved University of Illinois, walking the halls of a place that I had loved and dreamed of attending since I was a young child (so sue me-I didn't dream of Harvard or Yale or an equally stuffy place, I wanted to be an ILLINI, ever since the first time I saw Chief dance out on the field!), taking amazing classes, involved in the most kick-ass organization on campus (which, literally, kicked ass...hahaha...let me hear it for my CR's!), enjoying a lively social life :o) in addition to having some of the greatest friends imaginable.    When you're involved in a situation like that, it seems impossible that you'll ever have to break away from that and start fresh somewhere else.  But unfortunately, that's the bittersweet nature of college.  I had the same feelings after high school graduation, and after graduation from KC-both places that I had great friends from, and amazing memories.  Victoria, being part of the most recent crop of U of I grads, was talking to me about last night about how amazing it is that things can change so quickly-and she's right.  I remember how things were a year ago, and I see how some relationships since then have blossomed, and withered away, some long-standing relationships have been destroyed, while others remain as strong as ever.  It’s comforting to know that your true friends are never more than a hop, skip, or a phone call away…the case is true w/ my best friends from home, my KC friends, and the Chambananites…you can’t ever have too many friends, in my opinion. :o)   And Springfield is finally feeling like home…I feel like it takes about 6 months to get fully adjusted to a new place, and I’m finally feeling comfortable w/ my friends here, w/ my roommates, and with the new surroundings.  It’s always confusing and a little weird at first, but things are good.   Anyway, to take a turn OFF of memory lane and change the subject, I just got drunk dialed by the residents of 1004-a.k.a. Dan and Joe, who, for their previous drinking records did NOT sound all that drunk.  They’re having their big Super Bowl party tomorrow, and for the first time in a few years, I won’t be going. I’ve actually got plans w/ people here-but given the state of my car, I might just end up staying in and hanging out w/ the roommates, which wouldn't be all that bad. We get along great.  I miss the U of I kids, but I see them on quite the regular basis, all things considered. And I’m really starting to feel at home here in Springfield. Still, I can't live life completely without Murphy's (lol) and with that said I’m planning on going back to Chambana sometime in February, once I get settled into the new semester routine.  And Victoria and maybe Natalie are coming next weekend, yay! Me and V will finally get to see Second City, which is coming to Sangamon auditorium.  Fun times.    Anyway, I don’t know much else.  I’m getting caught up on the work from this past week, now that the moving hysteria is over, and classes are looking busy but good.  Week 2 of the internship should be exciting-I’m going to be running around the capitol like a crazy woman, and I couldn’t be more excited :D Anyway, I’m going back downstairs to watch tv w/ Elizabeth (I’m feeling pretty tired and low-key right about now), so, I love you all, and g'night.

       @#$%&*! Pontiac!   My car is being a pissy little bitch.  I hate midwestern winters.  My dear old car, a '91 Pontiac, has survived since my high school days, and has proven very reliable 98% of the time, but this is the first time in about a year that it has just been so darn cold (we're talking 4 degrees!) that is has chosen to ignore my pleas and not start. I put some heet in the gas tank and waited about 45 minutes, but still no good. Ugh. I think I'm going to take a nap and pray it starts once the temperature raises a bit.

       Reading, Papers, Thesis, OH MY!   My room, with the exception of some of my desk drawers & a little laundry, is in perfect order.  Just  the way I had it before-thank goodness.  For of those of you who don't know me well, I'm a bit of an organization nut-I don't mind clothes thrown around or the bed not made, but I MUST have a sense of order in my room when it comes to my desk or possessions, or I'm likely to go nuts.  I had my first night of good sleep last night, since the craziness of last weekend, and I couldn't be happier.     Baby Beauty Products   Totally random thought, completely off subject:  my best friend Krissa made a recommendation to me a couple of months ago, saying that I should try Johnson's Baby Bedtime Bath as a body wash for it's stress-relieving properties.  So I finally tried it, and that stuff rocks my world! Number 1, it smells awesome, #2, it's moisturizing and delicate for the skin, and #3, well, forget #3, it's just amazing.  Being a beauty product junkie, I'm always thrilled w/ a new discovery.  My last great discovery was Lancome Photogenic foundation-I have been blessed with good skin (except for about a week out of every month-BLAH), but this stuff makes a good thing even better-we're talking Catherine Zeta Jones on the front of VOGUE good skin-it's pricey, but amazing, and I have the hook-up at FB w/ my friends at the Lancome counter-we're talking free products pretty much all the time, and they're always suggesting new products and giving me free samples. Yay for great makeup!   Other Stuff   Totally changing the subject again, it seems like EVERYONE is going out tonight, including my new roomies, as well as some friends from last semester, but it's unlikely I'll be joining them, mainly because of the fact that 1) I've gotten behind this week, 2) I need to do laundry, 3) It's FREEZING! and finally, I have to work tomorrow, and I'm going out for Superbowl Sunday, so I HAVE to work on my thesis proposal and various other projects, so I can get ahead before I have a chance to get behind.  Yes, I know you're probably all shaking your heads, saying, "What has HAPPENED to that girl-what a nerd!" but, unfortunately, tonight I must put on my responsible student hat-although I'd seriously kill for a carbomb right about now. I wonder if Marley's has carbombs? I haven't bothered to check thus far...(and it's not like I would actually do one here in Springfield-that is strictly a Murphy's tradition) but my roommates  were  talking about an interesting drink they had recently, called a 'Red-headed Slut'-lol. I didn't get around to asking what was in it, but it seems the more people I talk to, the more interesting drinks I hear about.    Not much else is going on-let the exciting night of studying begin. I can't wait until I get caught up on my reading and stuff, then I'll be able to relax once and for all, now that the fiasco is over.  Until then, I've got chapters of reading waiting for my attention.  Cheers, and more later from this busy lady.

      Things are back to normal now, SO great, and so much better than they were a week ago.  I am SO happy w/ my current housing situation.  Seriously-my new roommates and I have only known each other for 48 hours, and we're already talking like old friends.  It is definitely a comfortable situation.  We're all so much alike, as far as study habits/living environment/social environment, it's not even funny.  They seem to be a lot like me, studious and responsible, but not afraid to let lose and have fun on the weekends (or even occasionally during the week, lol, as Jess proved tonight-coming home drunk after a night out w/ her internship buddies, the girl had 8 vodka tonics and was still able to walk AND talk AND was NOT puking-why can't I be more like that?! Why not, bc I have a toilet at IHOP that loves me...hehehehe).  In addition, they like to cook, clean, and enjoy watching reality television in addition to being addicted to HGTV (as am I)-why couldn't I have had them as roommates LAST semester? :o) Needless to say, I'm very happy w/ the situation.    Class tonight was by far the worst one of the semester-one of the guys summed it up by saying that he didn't think there was any activity that could have been more painful than that 3 hour class! So boring, so dry! Information that I have heard a million times, partly thanks to Poli-Sci 312 at UIUC-it's like a longer, more boring version of that, if such a thing is possible (Amy A. and Diller would tell you it's not) Oh well, that's why I'm glad that this particular class, despite its dull nature, has some of the most gorgeous guys I've ever seen on campus. DAMN. The hottest one of all, named Dan, is someone that I could seriously sit and watch all day, and to top it off, he's so nice.  It's a shame this is his last semester, but oh well. I'm interested in someone else-but every girl needs good eye candy. Enough drooling for one evening on that account.  Oh, and I talked to Victoria tonight, we caught up on life in general and since I hadn't talked to her in a week or so, I told her the gory details of the hellish roommate situation.  (I swear, does anyone else have such random things happen to them? I think not.)  She was, of course, shocked by the horrific details, but was pleased that I had been removed from the situation.  She expressed similar sentiments as Natalie and Krissa did, by saying, "OMG-get the hell out of there!" Don't worry, I AM! :o) Anyway, yay for her and Natalie coming to visit next weekend! At least they won't build a fort...  Oh, and my sister was in town tonight! She was downtown next to the Crown Plaza w/ some of her fellow KC students, they're in town for a student presentation there tomorrow, so I got an opportunity to go and visit w/ her. Yaaaayyy for that, despite our different personalities, me and Lori are really close.  It reminded me of KC and similar trips for StuCo...great memories :o)--we had so much fun! So many crazy  stories...if they wanted to, any of my fellow StuCo officers from my sophomore year could probably ruin any potential political career of mine before it even started-but just like the UIUC CR's, we have made a pact-what happened in Centralia, stays in Centralia (similar to Champaign)-although, there is still a questionable videotape out there (don't get excited, it's not porn, thank you-none of us are Paris Hilton wannabes)-but we won't discuss that any further.  Ty, if you're reading this, here's hoping that tape has long since been DESTROYED! I know it contained many priceless memories *AHEM* of our KC glory days, but here's hoping that it has gone up in flames-for all of our sakes!  Anyway, with that said, I do believe it's time for some sleep-it's gonna be a hectic weekend, studying, thesis proposal work, actually WORKING at FB, in addition to Superbowl fun at Dempsey's. So night ya'll, go getcha some! Sleep, that is! What did you think I was talking about, you perv!

      Ok, now I'm really going to post something legitimate...recap of my crazy week.  -I MOVED. With that said, I would just like to forget completely from this point on about those two weeks in my life.  My new addy is 2111 Carl Sandberg Ln., Apt. #5. Of course I'm still in Springfield. Come and visit any time, unless your names are Dan, Joe, and Donald, and you are planning on coming as a group. This apartment isn't ready for a toilet-papered fort.  -I've started sampling the lovely downtown Springfield eateries.  I went out to lunch w/ Heather and Matt, along w/ some of the other IARF crowd, and we went to Two Olives and a Pepper, which is right next to the famed Statehouse Bar and Grill. 2 O's & a P is great-I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a quick lunch or dinner who's just down wind from the capitol. In addition, it's such an adorable little restaurant, in addition to having good food. I mentioned that I have yet to have been to the Statehhouse B & G, and Matt confided that he had yet to be to it sober-lol.  This led to the sharing of drunken college stories among the three of us, which was needless to say amusing, considering that we went to arguably the 2 biggest party schools in the state-SIUC and U of I-I shared stories of the drunken quad stumble, but sorry guys, no references to my famed evenings at IHOP.  I'm afraid those memories will stay with me and the IHOP women's toilet-well, and everyone who saw me stumble out-oops.   -I was formally warned by one of C-W's lobbyists to watch my back down at the capitol, simply for the fact that I am a young, unmarried woman, and that there are a bunch of disgusting pig-headed congressmen wandering the halls looking for a**.  I don't care how badly I want a great political job, I'll be damned if I'll throw my morals/principles out the window and screw some geriatric congressman for a job.  I'm not that kind of girl, and never will be.  I've never wanted something that badly that I'd throw away my own personal pride and decency in favor of something material that can be lost just as easily as it could be gained.  I don't care where I'm at 10-20 years down the road, I want to be able to look and the mirror and still recognize and LIKE the person that I see.  -Classes are hectic. Seminars are a ton of work, which is part of the reason why I am not leaving my room this weekend, except to work at Famous Barr.  I've got a good GPA going into this semester, and I intend to keep it that way. Hurrah.

      HOORAY, I'm moved!  My new roommates are wonderful.  At this point, anything a step above what I had before was desirable, but truth be told, my new roommates are 1) friendly, 2) neat freaks-THANK GOD! and 3) not druggies or criminals! It's amazing what a horrible an impact a roommate can have on you, despite only having lived with you for 2 weeks! I got really lucky last semester w/ my roommates, and I'm glad that I only had to be in that hellish environment for 2 weeks-good riddance! I just feel so much more relaxed/relieved since I've moved out. Anyway, like I said before, now that I've gotten my apt. in order, things are pretty much perfect-I have a hectic school/interning/work schedule, but it's nothing I haven't done before, and now I can actually enjoy my classes and internship, which is fabulous.    Let me see-what else is going on...John Kerry won New Hampshire; no surprise there, in my opinion-to be perfectly honest, over the summer, I was feeling like the voters would gravitate towards Kerry-I've never been very impressed w/ Howard Dean; politics aside (yes, he's still hot, and Diller, I don't CARE if he has no neck-I'd still make out w/ him. I just wouldn't vote for him!), he's far too volatile of a person to gain the support of the DNC-they want someone politically correct and safe as far as the issues are concerned, and I believe they have found that in Kerry.  I'm starting to speculate that Kerry might choose John Edwards as his running mate, if and when he gets the nomination; I'm afraid that a Kerry-Edwards combination may be the toughest hurdle the Bush campaign has faced since Osama and 9/11-maybe that's an exaggeration, but it will certainly be difficult.  You've got two popular senators, coupled w/ Kerry's experience/veteran status + Edwards' youth, vibrant personality, and positive attitude.  Heck, I LIKE John Edwards, I just don't like his politics.  And I think America will like him as well-if they don't already.  In my mind, Kerry has a shot so long as he brings Edwards along for the ride.  Personally, I'm hoping that by some miracle Al Sharpton will pull out in front, so that G Dub rides on to an easy victory, but I think that we all know that's not going to happen.  Drat.  I knew I should have started Conservatives for Al Sharpton back at UIUC. It might have made all the difference...lol, jk.  Anyway, things should get very interesting between now and November, stay tuned for Amy Lynnette's political predictions-take them how you wish, they're just my random musings.   Anyway, I'm going to take a break from the blogging and unpacking and go catch the tail end of American Idol-yes, the allure of reality TV has sucked in another victim. Later, ya'll.

      OMG.   This last weekend was undoubtedly the weekend from HELL. And it's not because of Stacy, the bitch roommate anymore.  I'm talking about Heidi, the OTHER new roommate.  She was new, and I could tell she was very different from me, but I was still willing to give her a chance.  However, the shady late night guests, the fact that the POLICE had been called to our apt. while I was gone for the weekend, in addition to the fact that she had informed me she had a criminal record-OMG-I had reached a breaking point.  The last straw was last Saturday morning, when I arrived at my apartment to find her w/ one of her many male companions and in a roughed-up state-apparently, some of these friends/thugs of hers had gotten angry and decided to storm into our apartment and steal her jacket and various other possessions of hers.  I faced the aftermath when I came back and discovered the situation w/ the police there.  After I informed my parents of the situation, they sent me to a hotel until the situation was resolved-meaning, me MOVED OUT.  Luckily, UIS housing moved very quickly, and has placed me in a new campus apartment extremely similar to my old one, and my new roommates are both normal and wonderful.  That is just making a VERY long story short, but to sum up, I simply didn't feel safe anymore, bc I have NO idea what kind of crap she is involved with, and frankly, I didn't want to stay around to find out.  I'm SO pleased with my new living situation, words can not describe it.    Meanwhile, moving on to more cheerful things (I'd rather forget the last 2 weeks and my hellish roommate situation, bc overall, last semester was fabulous)-I just finished Day 2 of my internship, and it is going wonderfully.  Today was my orientation on the legislative and lobbying process.  I was knowledgeable about most of the information, but it provided me with a refresher of the stuff I had forgotten since my freshman year of college and Poli-Sci 100.  My job will primarily consist of research, IARF projects, and being down at the capitol tracking bills and sitting in hearings-a lot of legislative exposure, which is exciting.  On a side note, I think I'm falling in love w/ downtown Springfield.  Springfield as a whole is ok, but downtown is just fabulous-the best restaurants, the cutest shops, the most adorable coffee shops, historic sites, the capitol-the list goes on and on.  I'm so excited to be living downtown starting this summer.   Ok, I'm exhausted, so I'm going to stop writing for now, but I'll fill in more of what's been going on lately when I have more time and energy.  Oh, and I've decided to nickname my American Politics seminar "Bush Bash 2004" bc that's all that my Clinton-loving professor seems to do, every chance he gets. Blah. Ok kiddies, more later-love to you all.

       hehehe...I found this online, enjoy, my GOP faithfuls...   YOU CAN BE A DEMOCRAT - Virtually anyone can be a Democrat; just simply quit thinking and vote that way. But if you want to be a GOOD Democrat, there are some necessary prerequisites. Compare the list below and see how you rate.   1. You have to believe the AIDS virus is spread by a lack of federal funding.   2. You have to believe that the same teacher who can't teach 4th graders how to read is somehow qualified to teach those same kids about sex.   3. You have to believe that guns, in the hands of law-abiding Americans, are more of a threat than U. S. nuclear weapons technology in the hands of Chinese communists.   4. You have to believe that there was no art before Federal funding.   5. You have to believe that global temperatures are less affected by cyclical, documented changes in the earth's climate, and more affected by yuppies driving SUVs.   6. You have to believe that gender roles are artificial but being homosexual is natural.   7. You have to be against capital punishment but support abortion on demand.   8. You have to believe that businesses create oppression and governments create prosperity.   9. You have to believe that hunters don't care about nature, but loony activists from Seattle do.   10. You have to believe that self-esteem is more important than actually doing something to earn it.   11. You have to believe the military, not corrupt politicians start wars.   12. You have to believe the NRA is bad, because it supports certain parts of the Constitution, while the ACLU is good, because it supports certain parts of the Constitution.   13. You have to believe that taxes are too low, but ATM fees are too high.   14. You have to believe that Margaret Sanger and Gloria Steinem are more important to American history than Thomas Jefferson, General Robert E. Lee or Thomas Edison.   15. You have to believe that standardized tests are racist, but racial quotas and set-asides aren't.   16. You have to believe that Hillary Clinton is really a lady.   17. You have to believe that the only reason socialism hasn't worked anywhere it's been tried, is because the right people haven't been in charge.   18. You have to believe conservatives telling the truth belong in jail, but a liar and sex offender belongs in the White House.   19. You have to believe that homosexual parades displaying drag, transvestites and bestiality should be constitutionally protected and manger scenes at Christmas should be illegal.   20. You have to believe that illegal Democratic party funding by the Chinese is somehow in the best interest of the United States.    VOTE DEMOCRATIC... It's easier than getting a job!

       SATAN IS GONE!   Yep, that's right, Nancy is gone! 6 months too late to do me any good, but she's gone all the same.  I extend congratulations to all of my Illini, current students and alums alike-today is a happy day.   Also, I was informed that U of I's shady version of a student government, ISG, actually did something useful for a change and regained a neutral position on the Chief Illiniwek issue. Now, the BOT just needs to vote on the Chief, and decide once and for all that the the opinions of those darn hippies doesn't mean a thing, and things will surely be better for everyone at the good ol' Alma Mater. Meanwhile, back at UIS, things are just fine w/ our politically correct mascot, the Prarie Star, despite the fact that I find it ridiculous that we are represented by a large, blue star. Whatever.   Speaking of UIS, I was talking to some of my friends in the grad program, and this year we're having our end-of-the-year POS banquet at the Governor's Manion.  We've got the whole 2nd floor to ourselves, complete w/ DJ, karaoke, dinner, open bar...you get the idea. It's one of the nice things about being in a small grad program, where you can actually get to know your fellow students, and enjoy an event such as this one.    Not too much else is going on...V is visiting tomorrow, Cheryl might be visiting, and meanwhile, I need to get some work done, so this is where I leave you...more later...have a great weekend kiddies!

       To cut or not to cut!   All afternoon, I've been fighting against the irresistible urge to grab my scissors and chop my hair off. It's gotten sooooo long and it's very thick and all over the place, and it's driving me crazy. I need it chopped, layered, and thinned out, STAT! Only one week...only one week. Why didn't I schedule my appt. for this week? Darnit! I'm going to have to have my roommates hide my scissors from me, it's gotten to that point.  My hair is just annoying the heck out of me.  Long hair days are definitely beyond me...this is the second time I've tried to grow it out, and it just doesn't suit me anymore.  I'm not going to go and be scalped or anything (I've had some pretty short hair-but it was cute!), but this has gotten to a point of ridiculousness.

       A quote all good leaders should pay attention to...   Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power.  --Abraham Lincoln  In short, be wary of power.  There's a reason they say "absolute power corrupts absolutely".  Sorry, just had to wax philosophical for a bit, now that I'm getting an opportunity to work with some of the most important state officials, good and bad ones.  What else...I'm sleep deprived. I wish I could take afternoon naps. I OD'd on caffeine yesterday morning and ended up sick.  Not only can I not hold my liquor anymore, apparently I can't hold my caffeine, either.    Not much else is going on, except the weather is growing worse by the minute. And I have my most boring class of the week tonight-my state government seminar. Ugh. Other than that, things are good.  More later.

       Good song!   For all you country fans, like me...you'll love this song.   Well this town has closed down way too early,  And there’s nothing to do, So I’m driving around in circles,  And I’m thinking about you, Today I heard you got a new last name, Sure didn’t know it was gonna hit me this way, And the radio just keeps on playing all these songs about rain  Now there’s all kind of songs about babies and love that goes right, But for some unknown reason nobody wants to play them tonight, Hey I hope it’s sunny wherever you are, But that’s sure not the picture tonight in my car,  And it sure ain’t easing my pain all these songs like,  Rainy Night In Georgia, and Kentucky Rain, Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again,  Blue Eyes Crying In The early morning Rain, They go on and on, And there’s no two the same,  Oh it would be easy to blame all these songs about rain, Well I thought I was over you but I guess maybe I’m not, Cause when I let you go looks like lonely is all that I got, Guess I’ll never know what could have been, Sure ain’t helping this mood that I’m in, If their gonna keep on playing me songs like,   Rainy Night In Georgia, and Kentucky Rain, Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again,  Blue Eyes Crying In The early morning Rain, They go on and on, And there’s no two the same,  Oh how I wish I could blame all these songs about rain, All these songs about rain, Songs about rain.......   -Gary Allen, "Songs About Rain"

       Hmmmm...   Sometimes I wish I wasn't always such an accepting, forgiving person.  Sometimes I wish I didn't always look for the best in people.  If these things weren't true, it would make it possible for me to accept the inevitable truth and move on.  It would make things so much easier right now.  But unfortunately, it's just not that simple.  It seems that no matter what I keep hearing, no matter how upsetting or disappointing it is, I can't shake how I feel.  I don't want to believe that this person has changed like it appears that they have.  I want this person to be the person they were when we first met.  But it doesn't seem like this is the case anymore.  I just keep hoping against hope that they'll see the light, but until then...I just don't know.

       Old habits die hard...    I'M 124 PROOF.  HOW DRUNK ARE YOU?   Just a fun little quiz here. In all honesty, I haven't drank in almost a month, and I wasn't even drunk then-but I guess some of this carries over from my habits last year. Oops. Oh well. I'd kind of like to see the ranking of some of my partners-in-crime (you know who you are).    MEN!   Some guys are such insensitive pricks.  Sometimes I don't know if they even realize it. I'm not talking about any having to do w/ me, all is well w/ my guy friends/interests and I. However, I do have a couple of friends who are having issues and have talked to me a lot lately, and as for the men they are dealing w/, I have nothing but terrible words for them (the men-wait, no. The stupid boys).  Didn't your mothers teach you to be more sensitive? Girls, you have my sympathy. I seriously hope that these guys get their hearts chewed up and spat back out, like they rightly should.  That may sound a little cruel, but it is definitely what is deserved in this particular case.     Daily Summary   Meanwhile, all is well w/ me. IARF this morning, as usual, and now I'm in my apartment and wasting time, and considering taking a nap, before Bush Bash '04 resumes (my class tonight, not the primary).  It's freezing outside once again, but that should be no surprise to anyone.  My car is starting, and I got the locks de-iced, so I'm a happy girl.  My activities/classes are becoming a comfortable routine.  W/ that said I'm going to get even  more  comfortable, and go ahead and take that nap. More later!

       Tress Talk   So, next week I'm taking the plunge and drastically changing my hair.  Yep, that's right, my long, chesnut brown locks will be transformed into something truly magnificent, at least that's what I'm hoping for.  Current plans:  4 inches knocked off, a longish bob w/ layers and perhaps a little bang, w/ blond and caramel highlights. Everyone I've talked to has seemed to favor these plans, so here's hoping for the best.    Six more weeks?   Damn that groundhog and his shadow. It's freezing and yucky enough as it is, w/o having to worry about 6 more weeks of winter. Ah, whatever, it's just a groundhog. Meanwhile, I've been running errands all day, getting ready to head into good ol' FB for the evening. Fun times. No, not really. Nothing that exciting has been going on today, but tomorrow is back to the regular grind of things...interning, class, OH MY! This post is becoming completely boring and pointless, so I'm going to put you all out of your misery and say...MORE LATER!  P.S.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY GRANDMA!   (She's 77 today!)

       Song of the moment:    I’ve got you under my skin I’ve got you deep in the heart of me So deep in my heart, that you’re really a part of me I’ve got you under my skin  I’ve tried so not to give in I’ve said to myself this affair never will go so well But why should I try to resist, when baby will I know than well That I’ve got you under my skin  I’d sacrifice anything come what might For the sake of having you near In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night And repeats, repeats in my ear  Don’t you know you fool, you never can win Use your mentality, wake up to reality But each time I do, just the thought of you Makes me stop before I begin ’cause I’ve got you under my skin   Frank Sinatra (the one and only!),  "I’ve Got You Under My Skin"

       Patriots Suck   The Patriots won! BOO! But just barely. The Panther's players were cuter. (yes, you can tell I'm a woman, I enjoy football partly bc of the fact it allows me to openly check out the rears of some hot guys, w/o judgement...I can back it up by saying I'm JUST WATCHING THE GAME!) The halftime show was overrated, and a bit tacky, in my opinion-did Justin really need to undress Janet in front of millions of people? Whatever. He didn't really have to, we can already see she has a better body than 98% of us females. Talk about ab envy! Anyway, I'm sleepy, so it's bedtime.  Love ya'll,  more later.

       Super Bowl Nonsense   I have been watching the Super Bowl w/ my roommates, and is it just me, or do the commercials get worse every year? The only one so far that has been even remotely amusing was the Willie Nelson one. I guess they're running out of ideas, but whatever.  Still waiting to pass the verdict on the halftime show.  And there's no score yet! Talk about boring. Oh, wait-the Patriots JUST got a touchdown. Damnit! I don't care one way or another about these particular teams, but I do hold a grudge against them for barely beating my Rams 2 years ago. BOO! Go Panthers, I guess. Like I've probably mentioned before, I'm not the biggest follower of pro-football, but I do claim allegiances to two teams-the Rams, bc they're near STL, and the Cowboys, which is just a family tradition-much of the fam is from Dallas, so this makes sense.  Yeah, yeah, I know they're all supposedly on steroids, but whatever.   Meanwhile, my room is finally COMPLETELY organized-the drawers, the boxes, EVERYTHING is in perfect order. I'm so excited-organization makes me happy.   Enough of this, I'm going back downstairs to see how much the halftime show will rock/suck.  More later.

      My car is being less of a pissy bitch, it started! God Bless Cingular roadside assistance-you rock outrageously. Ok, time to shower and get some work done before the Superbowl festivities-although I must admit I couldn't care less who wins-the Rams & Cowboys are the only two teams I even bother following, and they're not in it.  No worries, though-there is more to life than football.

       The Hair Verdict!   It's fabulous, absolutely fabulous! Friday the 13th didn't make a difference. I ended up keeping the length, opting for a bunch of layers and texture, in addition to getting my hair thinned, a LOT.  If you know me, you know I have some of the thickest hair ever seen, so my hair is now light, layered, and totally manageable.  Now that it's not such a bush, I think I'll be able to stand growing it out. I'm hoping that it makes it about 3 inches past my shoulders. Also, it takes a lot less time to dry.  And yet, it still looks very full and healthy.  In addition, I now am sporting beautiful caramel-colored highlights, which are noticeable, but still subtle enough to look natural to those who don't know I've had stuff done.  And the hair still fits into a cute little ponytail, which is great for when I'm exercising.   Meanwhile, I don't know much else, but I had to report on the hair, I'm exhausted, and tomorrow I'm running errands and working yet again and the much-dreaded part-time job. I think I'll also paint my nails tomorrow...I realize that my weekly manicure is something I need to get back in the habit of doing. I have great skin and great hair, I'm working on getting back my high school figure, and darnit, I should also have great nails. Anyway, this has been one of my girliest posts to date, so to spare my male readers the torture, this is where I'll say GOODNIGHT!

       KENNY CHESNEY!   Yes, he's coming, yet again! To Champaign, that is-I'll being going to see him for the third year in a row. If you're game, let me know! Although I'm unsure as to whether or not anything can top last year's concert (Montgomery Gentry was FREAKING AMAZING), it should be fabulous anyway-we're talking Dierks Bentley, Keith Urban, and the man himself-triple the testosterone, I'm there! ow ow! hahahaha.  Eye candy AND good music-it can't get much better than that.     ROAD TRIP!   For the first time in 4 years, me and Krissa actually have the SAME spring break! I've been planning on a visit to the southland, and now it looks like it's going to be a full-fledged road-trip through the south's best places-we're talking Memphis, Nashville, Tunica, perhaps various places in Georgia, and more-good shopping, great food, southerners, and best of all, CIVIL WAR BATTLEFIELDS! You're talking to the granddaughter of one of the biggest C.W. history buffs that ever walked the earth, so yeah, I've been visiting the battlefields since I was about knee-high! I know, I'm a nerd. Rather, a good southern girl. My favorite picture is the one of me next to a cannon at Shiloh. HA! The trip will finish up w/ a visit to KD's stomping grounds in Murray, KY, to see what her gang does for fun.  Hopefully she'll be able to join the road trip fun, meanwhile, I'm working on getting a couple of other friends involved.  Good times, good times.  You can take the girl out of the south, but you can't take the south out of the girl!  It's gonna be a blast!   Anti-Valentines Day?   Hectic weekend ahead of me...lots or reading (as usual), working on a few papers, in addition to slave labor at FB on Friday and Saturday nights, in addition to daytime on Sunday. At least working gives me a legitimate excuse to miss out on the V-day nonsense.  I'm sorry, but if Hallmark is the one telling the guys to buy me flowers, candy, etc., don't you think it's a bit insincere? Same goes for girls buying for guys! And no, I'm not just saying this bc I currently don't have a significant other-I've had them around Valentine's day, and I've had all the candy and flowers I could stand, and it was just as insincere then! I'd much rather have flowers just bc he felt like it, rather than because he was trying to obey some stupid Hallmark holiday!  But at the risk as being labled cynical and heartless, Happy V-day anyway!    What else?   Class tonight (the most boring seminar I've ever had-but I've been through this before, ugh), followed by the usual Thursday night drinking festivities of the POS grads downtown at D. H. Brown's...but I hate having to drive-it takes all the fun out of nights out-seeing as I won't drive drunk.  I have to admit that I miss being able to walk home after a good night of fun in campustown-nothing beats the drunken quad stumble! Oh well, I'll be able to do it again next weekend when visiting the Chambana gang.  Besides, my partying habits did get slightly ridiculous during my last semester at UIUC...but ah well...the memories! (or lack of them, lol) With that said, more later!

       Song of the moment...  This song makes so much sense, it's kind of scary. I give you the Piano Man!   Don’t go changing, to try and please me You never let me down before Don’t imagine you’re too familiar And I don’t see you anymore I wouldn’t leave you in times of trouble We never could have come this far I took the good times, I’ll take the bad times I’ll take you just the way you are  Don’t go trying some new fashion Don’t change the color of your hair You always have my unspoken passion Although I might not seem to care  I don’t want clever conversation I never want to work that hard I just want someone that I can talk to I want you just the way you are.  I need to know that you will always be The same old someone that I knew What will it take till you believe in me The way that I believe in you.  I said I love you and that’s forever And this I promise from the heart I could not love you any better I love you just the way you are.  Billy Joel, "Just the Way You Are"

       Love, Hate, and Grad School   As I sat in class tonight, listening to my Clintonista professor repeatedly bash President Bush (one of his favorite things to do) in addition to resurrecting the entire dirty event we now know as  Election 2000 , I wondered why I am submitting myself to this torture...and went on to formulate a list of things I like/hate about grad school. Here's what I came up with...  Likes: 1) EVENING CLASSES!-no more worries about sleeping through my 9 a.m. on Thursdays after the usual drunken mid-week celebrations (celebrating nothing, as usual...haha, good times).  Or for that matter, any other 9 a.m. class. 2) Classes that meet once a week-if you get stuck w/ a crazy professor, I have found one block of time per week to be much more bearable than a MWF w/ the same lunatic.  Luckily, I haven't had any severe crazies so far, just raging left-wingers...no surprise there, it is academia. 3) Studying ONLY what I want to-more or less, I get to plan my track of courses for my M.A. degree-there are only two specific courses I HAVE to take, the rest is flexible. 4) Less tests, more papers-I've only had 2 tests so far (and they were in a class w/ undergrads), and I'll have no tests this semester-this is a huge relief to me, seeing as I have horrible test anxiety.    Hates: 1) I didn't think it was possible, but yes, there is WAY more reading now than anything I ever experienced back at UIUC.  I'm keeping up...but it's a pain. 2) Having my professors constantly trying to convince me to go on and get my Ph.D.-"if you're putting the time and effort into your M.A., why stop there?" they say to me-ugh. Just drop it already.  So, the pros have it...grad school is favorable, overall, in addition to the fact it is curing me of the reckless habits of my undergraduate career (specifically, using any excuse available to party at the most random times, including tuesday nights).  I'm lucky now if I go out to the bars a couple of times per month-yeah I'm a nerd.  I've replaced White Horse Wednesdays w/ evenings at Brookens buried in the back corner reading the AJPS.  I've become a weekends-only gal.     In other news...   Actually, there is no other news. I've been working on my thesis proposal and interning and keeping up on my readings for class-yeah it's exciting.  That's another thing about grad school-the workload is intense, especially when balanced w/ an internship and a part-time job.  Anyway, it's about time for bed...I'll post later when I have stuff of an exciting nature to discuss...until then, adieu.

       I'm baaa-aaack   It feels like I haven't posted forever! Actually, it's only been about 48 hours.   This weekend, after my guests bailed due to inclement weather, I decided to go home for a few days, (to do laundry, watch SATC, and just hang out) and as soon as I arrived, I found that my father had chosen this weekend to rebuild the three main computers in our house.  (yes, I'm aware that we have too many computers-between my 2 sisters and my parents, they have seven.  I know, it's sick) Since he was doing this, I was unable to get online.  I decided to test myself and see if I could go for 48 hours w/o internet: no AIM, no e-mail, etc.-and I'm happy to say that I MADE it! I didn't even go online on my cell phone.  You may not see this as that big of a deal, but I'm quite excited, knowing what an internet whore I am.   Good Sex can't last forever   That's right.  My favorite show of all time, Sex and the City, is ending in less than two weeks.  Call me crazy, but I was fighting back the sniffles after Sunday's episode. I LOVE THIS SHOW! And in two short weeks, all I'll have left is reruns. *sniff*  For those of you who missed Sunday's episode:  Carrie, realizing that her and her friends' lives are changing dramatically (Charlotte and Miranda are married/starting families, Samantha actually has a BOYFRIEND, Carrie is happy w/ Aleksandar), accepts the offer of Aleksandar to move w/ him to Paris.  It's a big dilemma for her, bc she's choosing Paris and Aleksandar over her friends, New York, and her job-but she feels it is a choice she's ready to make, particularly because of the fact that she doesn't want to find herself old and alone while all of her friends have settled down.  She realizes that things must change and her friends and her cannot remain the carefree party-girls forever.  Miranda is extremely upset by the choice of her best friend, and Carrie accuses her of being selfish, and the episode ends with Carrie becoming very upset w/ Miranda, but more convinced that she is making the right decision.  Personally, I always wanted Carrie and Big to wind up together, even though Big is all wrong for Carrie, but I'm glad that Carrie has found happiness w/ Aleksandar.  I'm even more happy that Charlotte married a nice guy, Miranda ended up w/ Steve, and Samantha is finally settling down w/ Smith.  All in all, I'm happy with the way the show is ending.   It seems fitting for Carrie to move to Paris now, it is time for them to move on into the next state of their lives.  Like some of my posts before, even in television drama-things can never stay the same! All good things must come to an end-it makes it a little sad, but with one door closing, another door opens.  I know this sounds ridiculous, but this last episode put things even more clearly in perspective for me.  I think some of my friends could stand to watch this show more!    To color or not to color!   Oh, and I think I'm chickening out of the haircolor idea. I'm definitely getting it cut, but I'm contemplating whether or not I want to mess w/ the color...I've done highlights before (they were my *thing* for the first two years of college), but I do really like my natural haircolor....ugh. I can't decide.  I need feedback on this one!   What else?   Ok...I don't know too much else...school is hectic this week, turning in my thesis proposal on Wednesday, reading, reading, reading, interning, interning, interning, and if I'm good and productive, I'll let myself go out to D. H. Brown's on Thursday to celebrate w/ the gang. (my gang of grad students, that is) With that, I'm exhausted, another crazy week begins...more later.

       Mardi Gras!    So of course the moment I make plans and promise people I'll come to Chambana for the weekend, my friends here think of something even more entertaining-they're all going down to STL for Mardi Gras celebrations on Saturday night-and I know of at least 12 other people that are already going. Darnit! I've never been to Soulard for Fat Tuesday celebrations, I'm ticked. But I'm true to my word, and I WILL be at Joe's on Saturday night-as promised. And probably some other places as well. Hopefully it will be a fun weekend anyway, but judging from all the Chambana drama I've heard about lately, all bets are off.   Insomniacs-R-Us   I still can't sleep more than about 6.5 hours per night, and late-night phonecalls do nothing to help the matter.  I'm not even talking about drunk dials-it was my MOTHER last night! Arg.  Love my family, but hate being woken up.   Carbs   I'm dying for some. DYING here. I figure I'll hold out till tomorrow, when I can justify ruining the first week of my diet by a couple of nights out in Campustown.  Hopefully I'll make it that long.  Then, it's back to the grind of things on Sunday. This diet is GOING TO WORK-bc it already is.

       Truth revealed...   So basically, if the rumors I'm hearing are true, one of my worst nightmares of Spring semester '03 has been brought to life. I'm horrified and appalled, and a bit sad, but that's life. We move on. Things change, and people sure as hell do.    And for the record, although I might be a bit jaded at times, really, I'm not so bad-the cold hard truth is just that- the truth -and IT HURTS sometimes.    Meanwhile...   All is well in Springfield-but the budget address is tomorrow-yikes-may God have mercy on the citizens of IL-bc rumor has it that a lot of them are going to be hurting after tomorrow.  With that said-I'm going to sleep to prepare for a long day downtown.

       Decisions, Decisions   So, recently I made a decision that I believe will have a big impact on my future (career, that is-and perhaps life in general).  After a loooong time of examining my interest in state v. federal politics, and examining my situation here in Springfield, along w/ some other factors, I have made a decision to move ahead and pursue an internship in Washington D.C. in the fall.  For awhile, I thought that my involvement in state politics would be sufficient, and I really love Springfield, but I have come to realize that my deep interest in the federal government is an itch that desperately needs to be scratched, and it would be unfair to deprive myself of the experience.  I don't want to look back, five or ten years down the road, when I'm married and (oh geez) maybe even have a kid, and wonder, "what if".  I don't want to be resentful in the future, should I settle down sometime soon, that I didn't pursue my interest.  No regrets-that's what I always say.  So what better time than in the fall? Washington will be alive w/ activity, with the election around the corner, and D.C. is wonderful in the fall (not too hot, not too cold...well, maybe a little...).  If I hate it out there, I'll be more than happy to return to Springfield and pick up where I left off.  But if I love it out there, I probably won't come back. After this semester, I've got 16 hours left, 8 of which I plan on picking up over the summer, and I've spoken w/ UIS admissions and it will be no problem for me to finish up the remaining 8 via correspondence.   So yeah...that's my decision and I'm sticking to it.  And I'm happy to see my parents supportive of my decision (and more importantly, me).  More details later.

       Style Observations...   Ok, since I have been working at Famous Barr since early September, I have had the opportunity to observe many poorly-dressed women (many of them old) trying to dress properly.  I have made some observations:   HAIR  Highlights: good. Regular hair color: bad. Especially if you're over the age of 50, and trying to maintain the same hair color you had when you were 20 (unless you're a blond, that's a bit different).  If your face looks 50, don't try and make your hair look 20, unless you have a darn good plastic surgeon. (I witnessed an 80 year old woman today trying to pull off jet-black hair, while her face looked like leather. Sorry, it just DIDN'T work!) People like Sharon Stone and Kim Catrall can pull this off.  It's likely that you cannot. Accept your age and your ever-changing "beauty" and move forward-work w/ a style that is age-appropriate. In fact, salt and pepper hair looks a lot classier than some brassy fake color, or worse, something of a purplely/blue hue.  As for hairstyle, short is fine, but LOSE the super-tight curly perms.  That is all.   NAILS  Fingernails should be of a tasteful lenth, and not yellow in color.  If you're a smoker, by God, keep your nails short and preferably clean.  For those who choose acrylic nails, a modest lenth is preferable as well.  And for heaven's sake, choose a classic color.  Deep reds and light shell colors are the best-they suit almost anyone.  Oranges, bright pinks, and anything else of this appalling nature are frowned upon. Anything resembling Morticia Adams is, fittingly, horrific.   WARDROBE  Polyester pants are never, EVER in style.  I don't care if they're Alfred Dunner and you paid $60 (yes, FB sells $60 polyester pants, a LOT of them) for them, the harsh truth is, they're UGLY and make you look old and outdated.  My recommendation to polyester pant afficianados:  Docker's khaki pants do very well, and Jones New York has many tasteful pant styles.  For the heaven's sake, lose the polyester.    That is all for the fashion advice today.

       Homework Schomework   I have so much stuff to do tonight, homework-wise.  I'm so glad that a M.A. only takes 40 hours, bc I think I'd die otherwise-no way I could ever stand a Ph.D. Seriously.  And law school-yuck.  I'm forever grateful that I chose the M.A. route as opposed to the J.D.  Yeah, so I have to revise my thesis proposal (surprise, surprise-it's too broad), work on a loooooong paper, catch up on reading, and work on my article summary presentation due on Wed.  The thing I love/hate about seminars is the class participation, which makes for fascinating discussion (at least, in my 512 class), but it also means you have to REALLY know the stuff you're talking about as to not make yourself look like an idiot.  Yep.  It's a blessing and a curse.    Random other stuff...   Thanks to my uber-neat roommates, (in addition to my own habits of cleanliness) I WON'T have to clean up the apt. before my parents' visit tomorrow-in my last apt., I had to CONSTANTLY be cleaning in order to keep the mess from building up-Liz, although she was a nice girl, was a slob.    Phone Etiquette   My father DID call me at 8 a.m. yesterday to say Happy Valentine's Day, and by the time I got off the phone w/ him, I suspect he was very sorry he called, and will not be calling before noon EVER AGAIN-I have warned my parents numerous times that phonecalls before noon as NOT acceptable (as they used to call me at 7 a.m. on Sunday mornings to see if I was going to church-ROAR!)-especially on the few days I have to sleep in.  However, my dad doesn't really listen to me when it comes to these things (he things a proper day starts at 6:30 a.m.), and since it's usually my mother calling, it hasn't been an issue.  Ugh. I very kindly called them back later and explained 1) I hate Valentine's Day and 2) he had ruined the ONE moment of blissfulness I was likely to have that day, so 3) he should be very sorry and never call that early again.  I think he got the idea.  Now, why have I ranted about this for as long as I have? To serve as a lesson to my friends reading this-do not, under any circumstances, call between the hours of 4 a.m. and 12 p.m. if you value your life., or unless you see my away message down and can clearly tell that I am AWAKE!   I don't know much else-I know this was not the most exciting of posts, but I've been working all weekend, so in reality, it hasn't been that exciting of a weekend. More lata...

       Carbs please   I am going nuts.  I would kill for a bagel right now.  The carb cravings are supposed to die off pretty soon (hopefully in a couple of days), but until then, I'm dying here.  This is the second day back on the diet (after two days off)-hardcore, and the total I've been on it is about a week.  Forget all the stuff I have going on-today, as we were having lunch downtown after committee hearings @ the capitol, I seriously became transfixed by these stupid breakfast muffins.  I've completely lost it.  Instead of caving, I purchased a large, green salad w/ broccoli, a little egg, sunflower seeds, a little cheese, and low-fat dressing-no carb heaven.  And I drank my beloved Diet Dr. Pepper.  And topped off my lunch w/ a sugar-free caramel. Tasty. Yep. I'm trying to get my mind off food.  First, I finished my studying.  I still have a paper to work on, but it can wait until tomorrow. I'm sick of reading.  Next, I thought about shopping. Scratch that, in the state I'm in, I'd only wind up in massive debt bc of the spending I would probably do...plus, I am not buying a single item of clothing until I have lost 25 lbs. That's right. So then, I thought about going out for the usual drinking festivities-and scolded myself.  I'm not allowd to have liquor during stage 1 of this diet.  ARG. I'm deprived of all of my favorite vices.  I keep telling myself it is good for me, and I look at pictures of myself in high school, and yes, I'm motivated, but still...sometimes I just want a darn cookie. But if I eat one, I know I'll want one more, and then it will be all over!    I saw the baby-eater! AAAAAAHHHH!   Yeah, that's right, I saw the baby-eating monster who made Tom Berns have a stroke-a.k.a. Naomi, in the DD/MI committee hearing today.  And just FYI-she looked very bored to be there-but no falling asleep just yet. Rest assured I am watching, though.  I'll get that sleeping picture if it's the last thing I do.

       Throwing Up   Typically, the only two times I throw up is either when I've had, um, too many beverages to drink, OR due to a nervous stomach.  Yes, this happens regularly during finals week, or when I'm upset, anxious, etc. Call me hypersensitive.  And of course it usually happens AFTER finals week for obvious reasons-I'm out celebrating. But it's usually due to the former.  Anyway, last night, I went to bed around 11:30 p.m., after having a forbidden bowl of cereal (Thanks to SB, none of that until week 3-but I wanted to finish off my last box).  Of course, I used milk on the cereal, and while it didn't TASTE bad on the cereal (It was grape nuts), probably bc I microwaved it, it certainly didn't set well-AT ALL.  I felt fine when going to bed.  However, I woke up about an hour later feeling the dreaded disgusting feeling rising in the pit of my stomach.  I tried to hold out for a few minutes, but finally jumped out of bed and luckily made it to my trash can.  Thank God.  If there's one thing worse than drunken puking, it's sober puking.  You can feel everything, smell everything, and taste everything.  It's so disgusting.  Now, some people may understand why I hardly drink anymore, bc it never fails, if I have more than three drinks, I WILL throw up.  Guaranteed.  And I'll throw up sooner if it's beer, which I just can't drink anymore.  And throwing up is bad enough while drunk/hungover, which makes it downright awful when you're stone-cold sober.    Anyway, I realize this has been a very disgusting post to read, but I felt that it was necessary to 1) justify my barely-drinking status, 2) warn people of the horrors of drinking too much by 3) reminding them just how awful it actually feels. Yuck.    In other news...   Meanwhile, it's been a good day, I felt fine when I woke up, I was downtown for the morning and part of the afternoon, came home, watched Days, and did some grocery shopping for South-Beach friendly food. Yaa-aay...the diet is officially back on track from this weekend.  Now, I'm looking over my stuff for class, my presentation in 502 is tonight, after not happening last week due to cancelled class.  Random neighbor guy, (I call him that bc I don't know his name) who seems intent on hitting on me, asked me to come with him to the basketball game tomorrow night, however, 1) I'm not sure if I'm interested, and even if I was...2) I won't settle for anything less than my Illini basketball players. Prarie Stars? PLEASE. Once you've watched a Big-Ten game I really don't see the point of wasting your time on anything less quality.  Even if the Illini are shaky at times.  Anyhoo, whatever. I like UIS academically, but I have no school spirit in terms of sports/school activities-I'm here to get my piece of paper, and if I have fun in other ways along the way, so be it. Those activities will most likely not be school/sports related.  I should probably give neighbor boy a chance, but I really don't know if I'm stable enough to be in a relationship right now-I would probably just end up being vindictive and mean and break a heart...I'm not sure if I'm capable of intentionally breaking someone's heart, but stranger things have happened.  Having had my heart broken badly once, I would never wish that on another person.  Enough of that.  You also have to consider the fact that I have almost no free time-it's a wonder I visited Chambana last weekend, which had good parts, but overall was not so great, thanks to bullsh*t drama.    Anyway, I am going to read over my article one last time, cross my fingers, and hope the presentation goes well.  But first, I am going to cook dinner.

       Burning Bridges   Here are lyrics from Garth-dedicated to certain people (you know who you are!).   Burning bridges one by one What I'm doin' can't be undone And I'm always hoping someday  I'm gonna stop this runnin' around But every time the chance comes up  Another bridge goes down.   Like ashes on the water I drift away in sorrow  Knowing that the day  My lesson's finally learned I'll be standing at a river  Staring out across tomorrow  And the bridge I need to get there Will be a bridge that I have burned.

       Mardi Gras!   Happy Fat Tuesday.  Here's hoping you don't get  too  fat. The jumbalaya they were making at Andiamoi's today was making me hungry. I would love some good shrimp e'touffe right about now.  And we're not talking the Central Illinois stuff-what I wouldn't give to be down in N'Awlins right about now.  Maybe for next year...until then, I've figured out what I'm giving up for Lent.    Bye Bye Chocolate...Hello Smaller Jeans!   Ta da! I am giving up... Chocolate!!!- I'm on the South Beach diet anyway, I have been for a week (although this weekend was a massive failure-I had Timpone's AND pizza AND liquor! Oh well, I'm back on track) but eliminating this won't hurt, seeing as it is my #1 guilty pleasure, now that SATC is over.  Arg. The goal is to have lost 20 lbs. by the end of Lent, and judging from the diet's predictions, I don't think this is so unreasonable, as I have lost between 5 and 7 already.  The total weight loss goal is 50 lbs., in hopes of getting CLOSE to my high school weight again. That may sound like a lot, but seriously, I was less than that once, I can make it.  If I wanted to totally kill myself, I'd try to get down to my actual high school weight, but in order to do that, I have a feeling I'd have to start up the three mile runs again, and there is NO WAY that is going to happen-back during freshman/sophomore year (@ CHS), I was running at least 15 miles a week. No wonder I was slim. It's hard to believe I was that little at one time.  And strangely enough, I never thought I was little then.  Funny how your perception changes w/ time!

       Big has a name!   P.S. WE FOUND OUT MR. BIG'S NAME! AAAAHHHH! Judging from me and Lori's screams, this was a huge moment.  Btw, it's John.  His name, that is.

       Good Sex is over forever...   That's right, Sex and the City, my favorite television show of all-time, is over.  But whoa, what an ending! I must say things ended just the way I hoped they would.  All four girls are happy. Samantha finally let her guard down w/ Smith & they are in a committed relationship (despite that huge gap in age), Charlotte and Harry are going to be able to adopt a baby, and Miranda and Steve have built a happy family life.  They've moved on to new phases of their lives, and things will never be the same, but they're not bad, either. Finally, Carrie ended up with Big, who after 6 years realized that they can't live without each other.  *Sigh* I cried at the ending. I know it's ridiculous, but this show was so much more than sex, style, and shoes-it was about relationships-and Carrie ended the show w/ one of her trademark voice-overs about relationships.    "Later that day I got to thinking about relationships.  There are those that open you up to something new and exotic.  Those that are old and familiar.  Those that bring up lots of questions.  Those that bring you somewhere unexpected.  Those that bring you far from where you started.  Those that bring you back.  But the most exciting, challenging, and significant relationship of all is the one that you have with yourself.  And if you find someone to love the you  you  love, well, that's just fabulous."  So, as in life, all good things must come to an end-things may not stay the same, but that doesn't mean that things necessarily have to be over.  And with every door closing, another one opens.  Old things can be good, but you'll never know how good things can be until something better comes along-this I've learned very well.  Don't be sad when things end, because you never know what rests just on the horizon.  I've learned this very well througout the past 5 years.  And I hope I'll always remember that when things get different/weird, or whatever.  I hope my friends will remember it as well, even through times of struggle.    And just as I discussed this past weekend-you make new friends, but you'll always keep the old ones-they're there forever-everyone knows true friends are but a phone call away.

       My Weekend...   So yeah, after a loooong day in Springfield on Friday, dragging V around the capitol, making random introductions and running into Lee Daniels (He's such a short, squatty, ugly man in person.  Not that his pictures were great, but you know what I mean. Geez!), it was time for a weekend away from it all.    So, got to Chambana, hung out w/ V, V's roommate, and Nat till around 9:30, when we stopped in on the Bushie's little "kegger", which ended disastrously-before it seemed it had actually began.  Tragic-I've never seen so many terrified underage faces in my life.  If you ask me, the idea that the police were busting up a tiny, quiet, party in bufu Urbana seemed ridiculous, however, when given some thought, V came to the conclusion that it was the dems up to no good-seriously, all they would have to do is hear about this and PRESTO! One well-timed phonecall and bye bye Bushie celebrations.  Yup.  So after me and Victoria escaped the underage inferno, minus one Natalie, we stopped and 1004 so I could run in and use their phone to see where the heck Natalie was hiding (V had conveniently forgotten her phone).  I knocked on the door, and Donald answered it (looking/sounding VERY surprised to see me), I proceeded inside where I was greeted w/ lively screams of "AMY! AMY! AMY!" and after the hysteria died down, I called Natalie and discovered she was hiding in an upstairs room. Smart girl! I grabbed Joe and we brought Victoria inside, and for about an hour things seemed fairly normal-just all the overage old-school CR's hanging out just like old times-good times.  Natalie escaped to 1004 w/o a drinking ticket, and having been (rightfully so!) somewhat traumatized by the situation, did not accompany us to Legends.  Legends was the usual, got the chance to catch up w/ everyone, and the evening (not lacking its usual drama) ended w/ quesadillas at 1004 and Joe being a saint and driving me back to V's to crash.   So, the next morning was somewhat uneventful, then coffee w/ V and Diller, mall w/ V, dinner w/ Nia and Amanda @ Timpone's-yum, Tanya's crossing party at Joe's (the reason I came to Chambana in the first place), and rounding out the evening yet again at Legends w/ D & J, Donald and Meghann.  Yeah-so things were great except when Dan decided to steal my cell and start calling people, and letting Joe cuss at them.  Yeah.  Then Joe decides to call this person on his own accord, and continue the belligerent behavior.  Needless to say, I don't know what went down between the old gang & this person, and I don't know if I really WANT to know-I would like to think that I am (or at least WAS) good friends w/ all involved parties, and I just wish that all of us (meaning CR's/former CR's-my other Chambana friends don't believe in drama) could get together like old times and have a drink and NOT have blood on the table as a result, as it seems very likely such behavior would happen if such a reunion was to occur.  Whatever.  Sincere apologies to the recipient of certain phonecalls-someone as uninvolved as I does not know whether or not they were deserved, but someone such as myself DOES realize that such phone behavior is still rude.    So, it was good to see the Chambana friends, but geez, I'm getting too old for the drama.  It has its place at times, and a good dose of it now and then, but now I realize how much the drama last year & my life resembled a soap opera-Meghann and I discussed this, she agreed that Chambana life was somewhat of a soap opera-a very poorly written one! And like V said-"When did getting accepted to college give you the excuse to behave like 3rd graders?" Word.    Back in Springfield...   I wasn't back in Springfield for long today, just long enough to hear that I missed a fabulous night in STL. Darn. Next time. Work was uneventful as usual, and now I'm home in C-town for Jami's b-day (I don't have class/work/interning on Mondays! Hooray) tomorrow.  I'm getting ready to go collapse-I haven't been this exhausted in a long time.  BTW-last episode of SATC was tonight-the last one EVER! TEAR! And BOY was it ever an ENDING! Needless to say, I will go into great detail about it later, but right now, I had just enough energy to sum up the weekend, and now, darlings, it's time for BED! **MWAH!**

       Off today...   Thanks to the boredem that ensued yesterday (the grant-writing workshop for IARF), they gave me today off. Yay! So far I've done nothing except sleep late...I'm so terribly productive nowadays.  In reality, I have homework to do, so what else is new? Hopefully I'll get my 517 paper finished by 5:30 p.m., before I have to leave for class.  It shouldn't be to terribly difficult.    Hair   My hair has been being so amazing lately, it's hard to believe it's actually my hair.  It's amazing what one good haircut (at two weeks ago, at that!) can do for you.   Tomorrow...   Back to the usual, hearing w/ Lee D. and company at ten down at Stratton Building...fun times shall ensue.     No more Blago?   Rumor in Springfield suggests that there is about to be a HUGE scandal break out of the Governor's office, one that has enough damaging power to potentially end Blago's political career.  No specific details except that it has to do w/ activity a la our old pal Slick Willie.  Yeah.  It's supposed to break out in the next couple of weeks...so if it DOESN'T, then I guess it's just a rumor after all.  We'll see, should be interesting.  that's all for now...more later friends.

       Average Joe   ...Is such b.s. Tonight's episode was the worst ever, thank goodness Larissa ended up alone. She's a b*tch, she deserved it.  SOOOOO ridiculous. I have nothing more to say about it, except that I hope Mr. Beantown gets a million dates thanks to the show.    Drama, Drama, Drama   Soooo sick of it.  And it amazes me...just as I start thinking that things CAN'T get more shocking, then they go ahead and do.  Ugh.  And I have just been informed of the absolutely pig-headed activities of someone I used to consider (to say the least) a very dear friend.  Like I said earlier, people have a way of surprising you sometimes.  But I refuse to worry about it.   Dan Bolin   Sorry if I cut you off on the phone.  After I hung up I realized I was kind of rude.  I guess I just don't want to rehash all the drama.  Sorry.  Come visit Springfield again soon, and we'll do lunch or something.   Grant-writing   I have to spend 8 hours of precious time learning how to do this tomorrow-I have no idea what I'm getting myself into, since I have been dealing primarily with the state legislative stuff, as opposed to obtaining federal funding (which is what I assume this is for).  It should be interesting.  There's still so much I don't know, but I'm learning as quickly as possibly.   Political Science   Just give me my degree already! (16 hours away after this semester...) I'm reading the most horribly boring book-EVER-at the moment.   Affective Intelligence and Political Judgement  by George Marcus.  It's about as exciting as the title makes it out to be. BLAAAAAAAHHHH...I hate 90% of the reading I've had so far this semester...it is so terribly dry and soulless, it bores me to tears. That's what I get for taking stuff besides constitutional law...darn requirements.  that's all I've got for now.  Adios amigos/amigas.

       Oscar Night!   Yes, once again it's Oscar Night, the night where Hollywood's elite get the excuse to come out and celebrate their "fabulousness" is tonight.  And I too am sucked in to the glitz and glamour of it all. They're getting ready to report the best supporting actor, a category I haven't really cared about/followed-Benecio Del Toro is scary looking! YIKES! And the winner is....wating...la la la...stilll waiting...the Oscar goes to Tim Robbins.  Greeaaat.  It's his first nomination for a performance, and his first win.  I didn't see Mystic River, hear it is very good, and he's supposed to be a great actor, he's currently giving the usual speech, thanking everyone in existence and giving props to his fellow actors/nominees.  Thank God he didn't pull the usual Hollywood stunt, and try and push his political views on all of us. We already know that he's one of the most liberal people in existence, and frankly we don't care-he's not there to tout his political views.  Anyhoo-as for the other nominees-I hope to see Charlize Theron win in the Best Actress category (anyone who would destroy their looks for a role as she did for Monster is deserving, in my opinion), Johnny Depp in Best Actor (although he won't-he was AMAZING-I don't care if it was a comedic role, and it has nothing to do w/ hottness), and Renee' Zelleweger for Best Supporting Actress-she was amazing in the last two movies she was nominated for, and this year I hope she finally wins.  LOTR needs to pick up best picture.  As for the others...I haven't paid much attention.  Fave dresses so far: Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee', Angelina Jolie, and Diane Lane.  More later...back to watching right now.    P.S. Sean Connery. Still awesome after all these years.

       The Weekend...   *Yawn* The weekend has been ok-pretty busy, working like 20 hours of it.  I've got a lot of stuff to do tomorrow, paper-writing and what not.  Nothing really new to report, except that life is remarkably drama-free.  One of my neighbors was found dead this weekend-it was really freaky, and very sad to hear about-he was a really nice guy.  It appears to be natural causes-they're doing an autopsy.  He had epilepsy, but they're not sure if that had anything to do with it.    Anyway-not much new to report, I'll let you know when more exciting stuff is going on. More later...

       Diet Mountain Dew   In my quest for weight loss, one of the things I have done that seems to be making a HUGE difference is the elimination of regular soda from my diet.  That said, I've been getting a bit tired of drinking Diet Dr. Pepper ALL the time, and I'm not a big fan of Diet Coke/Pepsi, and while Diet 7-UP/Sprite is fine, it has no caffeine, so really, what's the point?  Last week, just on a whim, I decided to buy a can of Diet Mountain Dew at work, and surprisingly, it tasted wonderful.  I drank it when I was younger, because my father drank it regularly, but never got into it, but now it's like I'm tasting it for the first time! Needless to say, I'm quite excited about this-the discovery of a new favorite diet soda is a great thing, in my book.  Next to try:  Diet Coke w/ Lime...according to Krissa & her blog observations, it's the shiznit.  I don't like Diet Coke at all, but who knows, I may be surprised by this new invention.     Spring Break   Is HERE! HOORAY! I'm going to be stuck in Springfield until Tuesday afternoon, thanks to Famous Barr and stuff for IARF (another hearing downtown...what do you expect?), but it's probably just as well, considering that I still have a lot of work that SHOULD be finished before my trip in order to avoid the procrastination that I embraced at times during my undergraduate years. Yeah.     Current plans over the next few days:   *Finish applications & resume, send out--> ALMOST DONE  *Finish papers...and get a start on 517 *Get car checked out & cleaned for Spring Break Trip---> DONE AFTER TOMORROW  *Make trip on Sunday to STL for dinner and movie w/ friends from home! *Do laundry and pack  Meanwhile, I'm sooooo excited about going back to Memphis.  I love it so much down there, but I never really have a chance to go downtown, seeing as my grandparents live in a suburb and when I'm down in TN it's for such a short time that it's strictly to see them and nothing else.  I love my grandparents to death, so that's fine, but I'm also really excited to have enough time to visit the city.  Meanwhile, Victoria, who will be accompanying me on the SB activites, is convinced that she is headed for redneck-ville, but that just goes to show how much the suburbanites know!  The south is the only place left in the country (as far as I'm concerned) with class, grace, and a sense of hospitality and goodwill towards fellow individuals.  There's no place like it.  Only 5 days!  Gotta run for now, but more later when I have time...byyyyyee.

       Today's Gallup poll   If the election was today... 52% of eligible voters would choose Kerry 44% of eligible voters would choose Bush 4% were chose another candidate or were undecided  I refuse to believe that Bush is going to win by a landslide.  Don't get me wrong, I'll vote for him over Kerry, but it is going to be closer than anyone thinks.  Bush's campaign team is going to be hard-hitters when it comes to Kerry's inconsistency on issues throughout the past 6 years, and his reputation as a hard-core Massachusetts liberal, but Kerry's team is going to be equally tough when it comes to the economy (whether or not it is Bush's fault), unemployment and the Iraq war.  In 1991, H.W. was enjoying some of the highest approval ratings seen since Kennedy, but once Clinton stepped onto the scene it seemed to evaporate.  I am cautiously optimistic about Bush's chances in November, but now is not the time for Bush's team to become arrogant.    ...meanwhile, stepping away from politics...   Afflicted   I have the early stages of Acid Reflux disease...yick.  Currently taking Prilosec.  I hope it heals itself soon.  I'm supposed to go back in two weeks, but so far it seems to be getting better.  However, when I was weighed at the doctor's office, I was pleased to find I have lost 12 pounds.    In other news...   Nothing! 3 classes, 2 days at IARF, and 2 days of work until SPRING BREAK! I'm so happy.  I have a lot to do, homework-wise, this weekend, but once Sunday comes I'm throwing down the books and heading south...first to Centralia for a few days, then to Tennessee-quite possibly one of the most peaceful places I know-it's really my second home.

      Hey everyone.  Not much new here.  Got up, met w/ Professor Redfied about my paper (which was about the shortest meeting I've ever had w/ a professor-but that's ok), he proceeded to tell me I was doing fine/on the right track, so I smiled, thanked him, and left.  Ate lunch, Shimkus thing in PAC, followed by errands and busy work around my apt.  I have so much to do before break, it's not funny...including the following:  *Applying for internship in Hastert's D.C. office  *512 Paper *502 Presentation *Reading for class (finishing all that needs to be done after break BEFOREHAND) *517 paper  ...and that's just the schoolwork part of it.   I'll be happy when Sunday gets here, that's for sure.  None of this stuff is due until after break, but I definitely want to get it squared away so I'll be able to relax.   Moving on to other business...I'm glad I'll be home for a few days before I leave for TN, have been talking to many of the high school & KC friends setting up plans to hang out-I haven't seen so many of my friends from home in so long...there's still no place or people like @ home...that's what I have to say.   Meanwhile, speaking of people from home, I went over to Chatham tonight to see my dad and the CHS Scholar Bowl team play in the IHSA regional-they usually have a pretty good team, but unfortunately they lost this year.  Anyway, it was great to see my father, I miss him, he's a wonderful person. Anyhoo, the high schoolers, mostly boys, pestered me w/ questions about college, politics and college, err, activities.  I answered some carefully (and at times untruthfully), while ignoring others.  Most of them were extremely immature, go figure, but their innocence was somewhat refreshing. I finally got annoyed and told them to change the subject (so we would all stay out of trouble), so they proceeded to tell me how cool my father is. (Yes, that's right...he may come across stern at times, but once you get to know him everyone sees that he's a good guy) I bid the high schoolers and my father goodbye at around 8 p.m., and headed back to get some work done and organize my room, which has become increasingly DISORGANIZED lately.    What else...no session for two weeks (they're on break), one of which I'll be out of the office, so this week should be pretty low-key down at IARF.  Lots of busywork to take care of before session resumes.   Anyhoo, with all that said, it's time for bed.  More later...

       I'm baaa-aack.    Wow, I haven't posted since Wednesday.  Here's hoping the 3 of you who actually read this haven't missed me  too  much-lol.  So, the end of the week was somewhat uneventful.  Thursday was spent at the capitol, trapped in committee hearings until the end of time, basically, but good news-HB 5000 made it out of committee-so good for IARF, and good for the DD/MI committee.  I sat up front trying to stifle my laughter when Naomi took out her box of cheerios and started chowing down during witness testimony-it made it somewhat amusing, and I don't think I was the only one.  Anyway, after we FINALLY got out of there, went to lunch w/ IARF groupies and one of our clients, fun as usual-I really love the people I'm working with.  They proceeded to tell me how lucky they were to have me there, and while I happen to think that  I  am the lucky one, being placed where I was, it's still nice to hear from them.    So, Friday was pretty much the most unproductive day I've had in quite some time.  We won't talk about it, but let's just say that I slept, a LOT-and that never happens anymore.  Friday night was spent @ the mall, working, hating the fact that I couldn't go to U of I for unofficial, which was a blast apparently-oh well.  I came home, went to sleep, and got up Saturday morning to do it all over again.  Saturday was pretty much your regular hectic day at the mall, that is, until around 5 p.m. when a crazed maniac (gang member, supposedly) comes in the mall about 20 feet from our store (or less!) and started SHOOTING! Yeah.  Only one person was injured, he's going to make it apparently, but it was scary as heck.  I managed to keep my cool until I got outside, when I proceeded to start shaking like a leaf and feeling nauseous-two things I'm well-known for when I'm anxious.  So yeah-I'm safe and sound, and so are my co-workers, but still.  It was terrifying.  Needless to say, a night out was in order, and my Chambana friends were happy to oblige me-those that were in town, that is-seeing as I wanted to be nowhere near Springfield after these events took place.  I'm supposed to go into work this afternoon, and I must say that I"m feeling slightly apprehensive about it, but hopefully it will go all right.  Yikes.  With that said, I need to get ready for work-so more to come later. bye.

       Disgusted   ...more political banter...   Disgusted with the primary results, that is-so disgusted, in fact, that I actually might vote for a democrat for senate this time around.  Yes, that's right, and to my republican friends reading this (there are a lot of you), don't you dare throw a fit, because you can't give me any legitimate reasons to vote for Jack Ryan, other than the fact he's a member of the party that I have claimed to support for many, many years.  I've never voted blindly according to party lines, and this upcoming election will be NO EXCEPTION! Maybe it will result in me not voting for some races (i.e. Senate), but as far as I'm concerned, the only decent candidate in the entire senate race is out-so I'm not sure what to do next.  I'll end up voting for someone, but rest assured, there's a good chance it won't be our buddy Jack.  His looks are superseded only by his arrogance.    Now, I'll take the opportunity to vent on what I consider to be big problems-not just in our state, but throughout the nation.     First* , I'm disgusted by the fact that the citizens of our "great" state are so gosh-darn apathetic about politics.  They can't get off their lazy behinds and actually care about elections to save their lives.  The majority refuse to get to know their candidates or even bother voting; instead, those who actually choose to vote typically throw their support blindly behind the candidate w/ the most and flashiest television ads.  Citizens take every opportunity they can to complain when politicians screw up, but do they really give a rat's behind when it comes to identifying themselves with a particular candidate or even voting in elections? NO! You don't have a right to complain if you don't know your candidates and VOTE...so just DO IT!    *With that out of the way, I can understand why some people DON'T vote-with as many individuals running for political office as there are, and with so many of them being power & money hungry slimeballs who are shackled to the special interests and corporations, it's easy to see why people get jaded.  However, this can all be changed if people would actually get off their behinds, mobilize, and VOTE VOTE VOTE!!!  It's a vicious cycle...but it has to be stopped and the only way this can happen is if the people make it happen.     Secondly , I'm disgusted by the system, one that allows such exorbitant amounts of money to be spent on political campaigns.  It should come down to issues, not fat pocketbooks & party darlings, and 95% of the time this is not the case.  Viva la Campaign Finance Reform, and John McCain, one of my political heros. I can only hope that there will be sincere changes in the future-and on a sidenote-I have sincere respect for John McCain for never backing down when it came to his principles/beliefs.  He's the man.     Finally  (at least for tonight), let me take this opportunity to go off on the Electoral College.  I know what you're thinking-this is the reason that the GOP has their man in office right now-and that is fine, I voted for him, and despite my problems w/ Dubya, am glad that he is there instead of Gore-but I still have issues with the Electoral College, and always have. Here are two of them: 1) The electoral college is disproportionate in terms of representation-it does not represent the citizens of the U.S. equally.  Look at the delegate/citizen ratio in California, and compare it to that of Wyoming, and you'll see what I'm talking about.  I know California is liberal, but still, we live in a democracy-and our citizens should be equally represented, and they AREN'T with the current system.  2) In states such as Illinois, along with other states that lean in one direction heavily in terms of partisanship, it makes my vote pretty much worthless.  Sure, if I can get enough people to back my candidate, then he might have a shot of taking the state, but I hate to say it kiddies, as much as everyone might want it, Dubya isn't gonna take Illinois in '04-which makes my participation pretty much pointless, if it is going to be a slew of Democratic delegates choosing the president (not me).  And the same goes for the states that lean Republican.  The Electoral College completely de-legitimizes the entire democratic process, implying that the citizens of the United States aren't capable of choosing a president by themselves.  It's infuriating to me.     Memphis! Tomorrow!   Enough about politics for now. I'm on Spring break and I'm leaving for Memphis tomorrow, currently packing-so excited!  Beale Street, Wolfchase, B.B. King's, the Rendezvous, Graceland...here I come again!  Memphis is hands down one of my favorite cities...no matter where I travel, this place always feels like a second home to me-and I love the energy and atmosphere of this lovely southern city.  I can't wait to get back.  Details of the trip shall follow upon my return.  Looking forward to good food, great music, fabulous shopping, and an all-around great time.  This shouldn't be a problem.     Chief   They're voting on Chief back at the good ol' Alma Mater...I'll save Chief Illiniwek banter for another day...tonight it's all about he primary...but we'll see what the UIUC student body has to say about the issue.  Should be interesting.  Meanwhile, good luck to Matty McDiller, running for Student Trustee, and Amy A., running for S.O.R.F., and Schlau, running for the organization formerly known as ISG.  If you're reading this and currently attend U of I, vote for these kids, and if I've forgotten you in my list, I'm sincerely sorry-after all, I've graduated and don't follow these things beyond my friends' IM profiles-I wish you all the best.     Wild Country   STL-April 2nd-it's gonna be fab.  Plans underway to attend w/ some of the Spfld. crew, and meet up w/ old friends from the KC days...if anyone would like to join the festivities, let me know-you're more than welcome-it's going to be a blast!   Procrastination Ensues   My papers still aren't finished! AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!! Oh well, I've got over a week-darn this blissful state of relaxation I've fallen into.    That's all for now folks, hope you have a wonderful week, and I'll see you/talk to you/post for you when I get back.

      So I'm home in Centralia for the moment and it feels awfully darn nice...good food, my own bed, etc...and no hard water.  My hair is so fabulous when I'm here.  Too bad it was just an overnight trip.  Last night was girls night out w/ Cheryl, where we had a 2 1/2 hour dinner in Mt. Vernon w/ girly drinks, good food, and great conversation.  Haven't seen her since the end of August, so it was good to play catch up.  The nice thing about best friends is that no matter where you are or what you do, and no matter how long it is between visits, you can always pick right up where you left off.  Such is true of many of my friends from home.  First weekend in April I made plans to come to STL to go out w/ the crowd from KC and such-I'm so excited, I haven't seen so many of those kids in such a long time.  And we're planning to go visit Krissa just as soon as the three of us can get a weekend in common...hopefully something towards the end of April.    But anyway, back to being home...I've forgotten how nice a small town feels, it's like nothing in the big bad world can harm you. Just like the Alabama song, "Down Home".  Not to act like I don't like the big bad world, but it's always good to go back.  I'm forever grateful that 26 years ago, when my father graduated college, he chose to turn down a job w/ the Chicago Trib and take a job at a downstate newspaper instead.  Many people may be like, "What was he THINKING?" but I'm forever grateful that he and my mother chose to call SO-IL home, and I'm not just another suburbanite. Southern IL, where people are still cordial to one another, you can leave your car and house unlocked w/o fear of being robbed, and where you can still see the beautiful night sky without the blinding city lights.  Anyway, enough banter from me...I'm headed back to Springfield in a few hours for a couple of days, and then heading down to Memphis for Spring Break.    Right now I'm observing my father's high school class, and I find it impossible to believe how immature they all are.  It's kind of ridiculous-it makes me cringe to think that I was this age once.    Anyway, enough out of me for now.  I'll post again before I head on break, until then everyone, take it easy.

       Congrats   To certain people who have gotten their affairs in order. You know who you are. All I can say is it's about time.   Karma   We didn't go tonight after all, bc some people bailed, leaving only 3 of us interested in going-and then WE bailed, bc we're are lame-o's and are tired from working at evil FB all day.  That's why I'm writing this right now instead, but no worries-next weekend will be fun for all...WILD COUNTRY and various other entertainment!   Night Cream   IT'S WORKING, you jerks. Just FYI Dan, Joe, and Donald: (I forgot to post this in my SB re-cap) On Spring Break, we went into a casino, and I got carded, and Victoria DIDN'T-and she's a year younger than me-so HA! So I look 20. You can never be to careful when it comes to prevention and maintenance.   Confederate Flags   More SB-I forgot about this, but we only saw a couple on Spring Break-one over a Civil War cemetary (very appropriate, in my opinion), and one on the Mississippi flag-as you may know, it has the Confederate flag in the corner.  However, Victoria obviously hadn't gotten over her yankee suburban-ness and shrieked every time she saw one like it was the Grim Reaper or something.  Sheesh. It was just a flag. And I'm still mad I couldn't find postcards w/ one on it to send to everyone. Boooooooo...   I Believe In A Thing Called Love   Actually, I don't know if I do or not. But this is about the song-it was played entirely too much over SB-however, it's oddly addictive, I'm ashamed to admit.  Although I have the horrible image of the jigga-dance in my head every time I listen to it (thank you Dan, for sharing the tape w/ all of us-now it haunts me).   Songs of the Moment    Every now and then -Garth Brooks  Desperado -The Eagles  I Believe in a Thing Called Love -The Darkness  Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)- Garth Brooks  The Heart of the Matter -Don Henley  When the Sun Goes Down -Kenny Chesney  -they are all very significant at this time for one reason or another.   To sum up...   I realize this was the most random of posts-now, w/o futher ado, I'm going to bed-tomorrow I have to work AND do muchas paper-writing, bc I refuse to procrastinate anymore this semester. Yick-only 16 credit hours...only 16 more...that's what I keep telling myself.

      I have just one thing to say for now (I'll put up a new post later...), and that is.......  GO ILLINI!   (I'll be at work, but rest assured I'll be sneaking up to the break room to watch my ILLINI!)

       Things to complain about:   1) My hair-it's dry...and I'm getting sick of the length. 2) My skin is icky and dry in some parts and oily in others. 3) I'm sick of politicians and politicking and it's kind of scaring me bc my career plans center around them.  4) My back is hurting for some unknown reason.  I think it's stress. 5) Certain people like to complain, a lot.  They complain without thinking about all that they have to be thankful for. 6) I like Springfield-but I am stressed out right now and sometimes I long for the simple days when all we had to worry about was where we were going to go on Wednesday night, and what we wanted to drink.  (Simple:  White Horse, and R&C Pitchers) 7) I wish my Chambana friends still got along.  I don't see them nearly enough as it is, and this whole nonsense of inviting them to visit in shifts (at least the CR gang) is highly annoying.  8) I can't wait to move off campus.  One of my roommates is so anal about cleanliness (I like it to be clean-but she goes overboard) that we can barely breathe w/o her spraying lysol everywhere. Seriously.   That's enough out of me for now.  I'm off to class.  More later.

       P.S.   I almost forgot! The Illini have made it past round two (sorry KD, I know we beat MSU in round 1 but ya'll put up a good fight) and are now up against none other than............DUKE.  dum dum dum......keeping fingers crossed-the Illini at their best could very well beat these guys, they've got a GREAT team this year, but Duke is hot stuff, so we'll see...the cards are stacked against us but during March Madness, all bets are off-UAB already knocked out Kentucky, and Stanford got beat as well, both considered favorites, so we shall see.   Matt Diller   Is the new Student Trustee for UIUC!  You deserve a shoutout-congratulations! And congratulations to the UIUC campus for proving once and for all that PEOPLE LOVE CHIEF! Hail to the orange, hail to the blue...hail alma mater, ever so true!   Vera Bradley handbags   ...are becoming an unhealthy obsession.  Would someone help me, please!     urlLink

        SPRING BREAK '04    ...is almost over.  I'm headed back to Springfield tomorrow, currently home in C-town, did lunch and shopping w/ Grandma C. in Mt. Vernon today-have a lot of work to catch up on.  But while I'm wasting time, I'll fill in the trip details.     Wednesday  Left Centralia around 5 p.m. after Victoria successfully arrived, w/o getting lost-I DON'T live in the boondocks despite what people may think.  Stopped in Carbondale @ the SIU-C campus for dinner at one of my favorite places down there, Pagali's-it's an old college haunt of my parents, and I probably love it as much as they do-it has the best pizza in the world.  Move over, Papa Del's.  (not that I was ever much of a Papa Del's fan...but folks in Chambana seem to think it's the greatest, whereas I do not)  So that took about an hour and a half, but once back on the road I drove the speedy route through Missouri which brought us into Millington (right outside Memphis) around 11 p.m.  Chatting w/ my grandparents was promptly followed by much-needed sleep.     Thursday  Pancakes, followed by a trip to the Galleria, which was cut short as I found I had a flat tire leaving my grandparent's driveway...after a walk back to my grandparent's, my grandfather helped us fix the tire and V got her first glimpse of southern hospitality when one of the neighbors came by and helped my grandfather fix it.  Finally, after purchasing a new tire, we got to the Galleria, where I purchased an uber-cute shirt and some salon products.  After shopping, we headed back into Millington to eat dinner, and then explored downtown Memphis for the better part of the evening.     Friday  Elvis' home, (Graceland) and random souvenir shopping, followed by an evening in Tunica, Mississippi-the Vegas of the south.  On the way to Tunica, V commented on the fact that my accent had grown increasingly southern in our short time down there, but I explained to her that this happens whenever I visit, seeing as my grandparents have strong accents.  Since we didn't want to waste a lot of money, V and I made it our duty to collect coin cups from every casino we went to, and ended up not spending that much money but having fun.  Between the complimentary drinks and flashing lights, it was an entertaining evening.   Saturday  Wal-Mart, Galleria, Peabody Ducks (if you're unsure what I'm talking about, ask me sometime about them...) and Rendezvous-the best bbq joint the world has ever known.  Wanted to spend some time on Beale street, but thanks to the rain, it was nearly impossible.  Other than Saturday night, the weather was absolutely beautiful.     Sunday  Church, luncheon w/ my grandparents, then headed back to C-town, making extremely good time, upon arrival, V headed back to Chambana.  And that was spring break!   I'll write more later.  Until then, I have much to work on before this week is over. Later gang!

      I'm so exhausted, I used to go out no less than 3 times a week (last year) and now I can't even handle one sober night out every few weeks! WHAT HAPPENED TO AMY LUHNETTE?!?   ...wait...she graduated. That's right.  Ya gotta grow up sometime.  With that said, I'm going to sleep. And yes, I realize it's only 8:39 p.m. And I could care less!

      Last night was so much fun! We ended up going to Wild Country, about an hour and 10 minute drive from Spfld., but well worth the wait! Natalie drove from Champaign to Spfld, and then we met up w/ Cheryl at WC-it was great! Also got to see a bunch of the KC gang-people I hadn't seen in AGES and miss a lot, so that was a blast-those guys are so awesome, I miss them! Anyhoo, after a night of dancing and (sober) fun, (at least for me and Natalie!) it was time to drive back, which was perfectly fine, except I got stopped by a police car ONE BLOCK from my apt.! AARRGG!!! I realize that the UIS police like to stop people pretty regularly late at night/early morning, since a LOT of people drive home drunk, so I didn't panic, just simply got my license, registration, etc., and smiled nicely at the cop and asked him what I could do for him.  Apparently, in my state of exhaustion driving back, I was being a little, err, liberal w/ the distinction between the road and the bike lane, and he had wanted to stop me and see what was up.  I explained to him (truthfully!) that I was completely exhausted, and might have not been as careful, taking my half of the road, seeing that no one was around driving, but that I hadn't realized that my driving appeared irresponsible.  I also explained to him that I hadn't been drinking (in truth, I hadn't), and I never drink and drive bc, well, it's just stupid.  I apologized, and the cop very nicely let me off and told me kindly to get some sleep.  Me and Nat then drove the 1 block to my apt., slightly surprised that he had stopped us, but I really didn't think it was highly unusual, given the nature of the UIS cops and their lack of anything better to do.  But oh well.  This just goes to show that if you treat cops very nicely and are respectful, they'll typically treat you well, and there will be a better result in the end.  Screaming and complaining and yelling will get you absolutely nowhere.  Ok, so that was my night in a (very quick!) nutshell.  I have to go to work, so I'll fill in details later.

       April Fools   Want to hear about mine? Boy, do I feel stupid.  As I was doing my routine check of online news sources last night, I stumbled upon the DI and this--> urlLink   and actually got excited for a second.  Then I actually read the article. And looked at the date.  And felt IMMENSELY stupid.    Sometimes I wonder if I wasn't meant to be a blonde.  Well, at least I wondered that in THIS particular instance. But have a happy April Fools day anyway.    Wild Country   Tomorrow night, friends old and new alike, both the Spflders and the gang from home-IM me if you're interested-leaving Spfld. at 10-so speak up now if you want to go!!! It will be nice to take a break and actually go out and relax...something I have so little time for anymore.   Panic Attacks   Are scary. I had one last week and seriously thought I was dying.  But then I talked to one of my friends here who has had them, and figured it out.  I'm just too gosh darn stressed out.    POS 502   ...isn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.  After I discussed my situation w/ my professor, (working, interning, taking a full load, PLUS trying to sleep/have a life besides study/working) she was very understanding, and acted a bit like a mother hen and explained that I needed to slow down, a LOT, before I made myself seriously ill.  She offered to give me an extension on my final project should I need it, so this way I can stress a little less and still maintain a good GPA-she can tell my heart is in it, but the brain (and body) can only take so much-stress, caffeine, sleeplessness, etc.   Enough posting, I'm tired, I'm going to attempt a nap before class, but will probably just end up showering and drinking more caffeine to stay awake...more later kids.

       Etiquette Grrls   I've discovered a great website, thanks to Krissa and her Southern-belle-ness, it's under my links-check it out, I promise you'll like it.  (Well some of you might not, but those same some of you probably don't read this that much, so in that case, ignore this, and go about your regular way of behavior)  It's both entertaining and enlightening, and it's about time THIS belle from IL discovered it, wouldn't ya say?    Politics as usual   Right now, I'm off to the evil evil state capitol to hang out w/ our corrupted legislators and the fabulous folks from IARF-back later this afternoon, and then it's time for my weekly interrogation (a.k.a. POS 511-but Prof. Miller likes to question my every facial expression-my fellow students say he does this bc he "enjoys" me-but I could definitely think of better ways for teachers to let their students know that they like them-and no, when I say "enjoy", I don't mean it in a sick sense, so just get that thought out of your mind right here and now.).  I'll post more later folks. Until then, adieu.

       The end is in sight...   ...And I couldn't be happier. The Summer Schedule is out, and I have planned my coursework for the last two semesters-I have 16 hours of coursework left for my master's degree, including the following:  1) Grad Seminar on Lobbying in State Government (4 hours-this summer!) 2) Grad Seminar on Terrorism & Politics (4 hours-this summer!) 3) Graduate Internship (4 hours-this fall!) 4) Closure Exercise (YIPPEE!!! I have yet to decide what this will be, but it is going to be as painless as possible-that's all I have to say about that)  And then, ladies and gentlemen, yours truly will hold a master of arts in Political Studies, and will be done w/ her higher education until futher notice (or at least until I have a few years experience-I can't have myself educated out of a job, you know)

       Currently reading:   What Southern Women Know (That Every Woman Should)  -I picked up this book on Spring Break. Victoria read part of it and thought it was absolute crap. I admit, some parts of it are silly, but a good deal of it makes great sense to me-why act like a man in a man's world when femininity is the key to success? Work it, girls-that's all I have to say.    Currently listening to:   Keith Urban-any and all songs  -I was watching the concert special on CMT, since I'm not in Chambana now for the KC concert-I'll be seeing the gang in September at the UMB Bank Pavillion-can't wait! KU is much better in concert (it seems) than he is in his music videos-but then again, many artists are. Looking forward to a third year of concerts w/ KC, and finally seeing the hot aussie in concert.    Current activity:    Cleaning my room/packing winter clothes.    -It's about time, I say-it's become very messy/cluttered.

       Chambana...it's different.    So last night I decided to go to Chambana for the bc, and me and Nat went out to Brother's to meet everyone around 10:45.  It was kind of weird...all of these people milling around in CR t-shirts whom I didn't know at ALL, scattered w/ a few familiar faces (Dan, Joe, V, Donald, Diller, etc...) who greeted me and attempted to carry on conversation, despite the fact that you can't hear anything in those blasted bars.  Anyhoo, I wished Diller a happy 21st and proceeded to make the rounds.  We then went to Joe's, where I ordered a shot because I was sure it was the only thing I could tolerate-sadly, beer makes me sick and I don't drink much of anything besides a good cabernet nowadays...yup, I'm getting old.  Not so much old, but more mature. And it doesn't help that most of my friends in Springfield are between the ages of 25 and 35 and have actual careers.  And...I don't know.  Maybe it was just the lack of familiar faces crowded together, and the fact that a bunch of the old gang took off early-it just felt different, and pretty much all of my friends on the crawl I talked to agreed-things have just changed so much since last year.  But really, it's not a bad thing-it was going to happen sooner or later, we're all growing up. And you have to grow up sometime.  And I think that's what we're doing-some people it has taken longer than others.  Anyhoo, after Joe's was Legends, followed by Murphy's, where I proceeded to do a carbomb w/ Garrett and somebody else (I think) for old times sake, and despite the fact that I really just DON'T drink anymore, & true to Amy Luhnette history, I had that thing down before he had passed the halfway mark. YEAH! I am still a champ.  The cold beer didn't feel too good in my warm stomach, but I was neither drunk NOR puking-so it's all good.  IHOP followed, where I declined sitting next to Dan, seeing as he enjoys salting my hair, stayed for a bit, then headed out w/ V, went to B-E to visit Amanda (who was working!) till 4:30 a.m., then headed back to Nat's to sleep.  Got up this morning, feeling suprisingly well-rested after my 4 hours of sleep, and headed back to good ol' Springfield.     My dream job?!?   Plenty more details to come on this one.  Just stay tuned-I'll just say I'm really excited!   Home Saturday, Back Tuesday!   Working for the next 2 days, then heading home-I don't have to work at IARF on Tuesday, so I get to come back late, yay. :o) The rest of next week will be full of stuff for my seminars, thesis research, reading, Chicago on Thursday w/ the IARF gang, and maybe fitting a night out in there somewhere.   That's about it for now, folks, hope this caught everyone up.  Now it's time to get ready for work, ttya'll later!

       WHO NEEDS SLEEP?  as sung by BNL-great song.  I hate not being able to sleep.  Despite my body's severe LACK of it at the moment, you would think it actually liked to be sleep-deprived, seeing as I haven't been able to fall asleep over the course of the last hour.  WHICH is why I'm writing this, in hopes that it will wear me out.  All bets are off.    I have friends who are talking about what is stressing them out, so here is what is stressing ME out:  Thesis Proposal Selecting a Thesis Committee & Chair WRITING my Thesis Working WAY too much (I'm serious) My internship Springfield & Politics as usual Random drama w/ various people And did I mention my thesis?!?   Thesis=Puking?   So yeah, the thesis is basically which is what is making me want to puke, and the thought of defending my independent research in front of three of my professors is enough to send me over the edge.  Luckily, I have until December, but seriously, that's not a LONG time.  Fortunately, my professors have reassured me that I WILL be ready, otherwise there's no way they'll even attempt to let me defend it.  I have a great topic, but I'm still fine-tuning things so when I finally have it JUST where I want it, I'll let you know and go into great detail on the topic and hopefully bore some of you to tears. Muhahahaha...  Just as a sidenote, I'm serious about the puking.  For those of you who don't know me as well as others, I regularly get a nervous stomach, and this quite often leads to me throwing up.  Prime examples have been before tests, dates, speeches-you name it, I've puked before it. This can't be good for my stomach lining.   Back to the school stuff, did I mention that I got an A on my presentation for 511? YAY! HUGE part of our grade-my nervousness didn't get the best of me, and my professor gave me a hug. You know you did something right when your professor says he's proud of your work.  (And it's ok, my prof. isn't a perv or anything-like Weissburg-he's a genuinely nice guy and shows great concern for our well-being as students, which is something that you don't usually find in college, particularly in grad school) Now, onto finishing the dialectic journal and author log-wooo hooo.....   PICTURES !  I finally found my disposable camera from way back when, and used it to take pics at WC of me and the KCers...the pictures are hilarious and include everything from New Year's in Chambana w/ V and the hamster and group pictures at midnight, to various Spfld. activities, to the crazy dinner party, and the best picture of all, w/ me and Cheryl posing w/ Adam the self-proclaimed pimp (haha Adam-but it is a cute picture).  WC was a blast, the KC gang HAS to get together more often-I LOVE YOU GUYS AND MISS YOU!   To crawl or not to crawl...   So my Chambanite CR friends are having their Spring barcrawl tomorrow, an event I have been asked to attend, I must say I am a bit apprehensive, seeing as my mere presence in Chambana always seems to stir up drama.  Well, not necessarily stir up drama, but I end up HEARING about LOADS of drama-and drama is something I have learned to do w/o. And lack of drama is BLISS. Still, it would be nice to see the gang again, (esp. since there won't be many more opportunities for the old school CR's to get together) and see if tomorrow they decide to love or hate each other.  Those relationships within that group have and probably always will be volatile, to say the least. Liquor will add to the comraderie of the group, but I know better-things are NOT the same as the once were, but ah, such is life, such is life.  If I end up going, I'll write more about it later. I do have class tomorrow night, and I'm not skipping it, so if I do show up, it will be late.   Ok, I'm going to give the sleep thing another try.  And with that said, I'll talk to ya'll later.

       HOME   Ahhhhhh home.    I love home.  Most of the time.  Last night:  Dinner w/ parents, sisters, Jami's best friend Megan, and Grandparents Hodges.  Smoked ribs, scalloped potatoes, salad, corn on the cob, dinner rolls, baked beans, homemade brownies, various beverages-now, this is what I food.  This is just a regular Sunday dinner at the Hodges household-I miss home cooking.   I've been working on my powerpoint for 511 ALL DAY-it's awesome and if Prof. Miller isn't uber-impressed, I'm going to be highly disappointed.   Average Joe finale is on tonight-what on earth are they going to do when this one is over? Booo...I love Average Joe, even though it is truly the worst of the worst reality shows.  Hate Survivor, hate Celebrity Mole, and yet I LOVE the lame-o NBC reality shows-AJ & Apprentice.  Have also became a huge fan of American Idol-but the only one I get really upset about missing is AJ.  Unlike my roommates-who tape every SINGLE reality show ever invented.    Current Stressbusters/Guilty Pleasures  Average Joe VH1 All Access, Fabulous Life Of..., etc.-pretty much any of these worthless shows are shows I absolutely adore watching, but tell very few people I do-oops, the secret is out.  Sam's Choice Peanut Butter Cups (like Reses-except WAY better-trust me on this one!) Evening Walks (to counteract the PB Cups-and for peace of mind) **Without these things, I think I'd probably lose my mind.**  I'm gonna keep prepping for the presentation, do some laundry, and watch AJ finale-ttya'll later.

      AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH sleep.  I love sleep.    Trying to awaken myself enough to gather my belongings and head home-my parents are on Spring Break this week, and my grandparents are coming to visit, so I'm going to have to spend a couple of days with them till I have to be back on Tuesday afternoon for work and my otherwise hectic and stressful life.  After IARF-ing on Tuesday, I'll be giving my presentation for 511-eeeeeeeee. Then Wednesday is just another 16 hour day, nonstop-yeah, no biggie, I'm used to it by now.  Thursday will be slightly better, IARF, then a little afternoon break, then class, then (hopefully) heading over to good ol' C-U for an evening out w/ my Chambanaites.  Supposedly, the CR barcrawl is going on, and the last CR barcrawl I came to town for produced nothing but trouble, but if anyone tries to unload their drama on me, I'm going to silence them with a nice, simple, "SHUT UP!!!"  Now it's time to pack and go home...I'll talk to everyone later this week.  I swear, if I didn't have a Monday off every now and then, I'd go insane.

       Random thoughts   So basically all my life, I've been what's known as a pleaser.  I aim to please.  I like little drama and happy people.  I love it when my friends are getting along and not hating each other.  Needless to say, life is not so simple.  But with this being my nature, you can understand why being friends with various drama queens (and kings) is at times trying.  I specifically refer to my Chambana friends when I refer to the dramatic folks, although some of my friends from home definitely qualify.  My Springfield pals are too new and with the exception of a few I don't confide deeply in them.    ANYHOO-moving on...  I very seldomly ask for sympathy or make people feel sorry for me.  I don't like being the center of attention or the subject of pity/sympathy.  I'm not shy, but I am definitely reserved.  I get physically sick at the thought of being at the "center" of things-this may sound weird, but it's true-my friends in Chambana regularly scream/freak out when I show up at various events, I guess because they don't see me so much this year.  I've never said this before, but when everyone is running around me and showering me with attention, it actually makes me nauseous.  I miss the simple days of my senior year where is was just all of us chilling at White Horse with a few R&C pitchers and a bad rendition of "Piano Man".  When no one missed me and people took my presence for granted-how horrible is that? I'm not saying that it's not nice to know I'm missed so much, but, yeah-life was simple last year. Everyone loved me, but they didn't have to worry about  missing  me. Last year, when the biggest decision any of us made was what bar we were going to and what we were going to drink, and where we were going to eat afterwards.   Let's just say things have changed...a lot.  Not just with me, either.  But with this being said, I wish some people would realize that I am NOT invincible.  And although I try to keep people happy, even I am sensible to realize that sometimes this is NOT entirely possible-LIFE freaking HAPPENS and you have to roll with the punches, so to speak.  I realize that I CANNOT be everything to everyone at all times.  I try, but there's no sense in doing this because you only end up hurting yourself. You cannot spend your life apologizing for everything that goes wrong and everyone that DOES wrong otherwise, you'll be apologizing your entire life-bc this world is full of faults.  I have finally realized that I have to take care of  myself   first  and this semester I really HAVEN'T been doing that-I am taking a full load of graduate coursework, I am working about 25 hours a week at FB, and doing an internship on top of things-and still trying to pull a 4.0, eat, sleep, and maybe somewhere in there squeeze a social life. Oh, and deal with drama in general-strangely, hardly any of it is mine!  FORGET dating-when would I have time? Not that there have been any potential Mr. Rights (or even Mr. Right Nows), but if there were, you can rest assured that I wouldn't have time OR energy for them.  The fact that there are no decent men left in the ENTIRE world is an entirely different story for when I have much more energy.    Basically, my doctor told me that I have to slow down or I am going to end up with an ulcer or mono or something equally horrible.  So today, as I was thinking about the hectic state that is my life, I made a vow to start putting myself ahead of others (not in a selfish way), LEARN TO SAY NO, and just overall take better care of myself.  Because I haven't been doing that.  Not at all, lately.    Ok.  that's enough for tonight, I'm really tired of all of this rambling/ranting and the best way I can take care of ME right now is to get some sleep...stay tuned, more later.

       YAA-AAY!    First (official) interview:  April 21st. WISH ME LUCK! (I'm so excited-but I'm not saying anything else until then for fear of jinxing myself!)   My Pets   So since I'm getting a dog AND a cat next year for my apt., I have decided that they will be named MILO AND OTIS.  :o)  They're going to be adorable and I'm totally going to be one of those people who dress them up for holidays and pose with them for Christmas card pictures. hee hee hee...  Not much else except I am back in Springfield after a long & lovely Easter weekend and have plenty to do.

      P.S. I officially have enough Easter candy to put me, a non-diabetic, into a sugar-induced coma (or state of hysteria). Yeah, it's bad, but hopefully I'll make it. SUGAR!!!!!!!!!!!   THANK YOU MR. AND MRS. EASTER BUNNY!

      Currently listening to: "Redneck Woman" by Gretchen Wilson...hehehehe   HAPPY EASTER    Everyone-hope the easter bunny brought you lots of nice treats-Sunday started much too early, with me being at church w/ the family at 6 a.m. for sunrise service.  My father and mother told me I should be a bit more cheerful waking up, and I explained to them that I'm sure God loves me even if I'm not cheerful about being up at the crack of dawn, despite the fact Christ is indeed resurrected.  I seriously hope you understand God-it is nothing personal.  Anyhoo, after sunrise service, back home for a couple of hours, (I took a nice nap) then headed off to my grandmother's house to spend the day w/ the ENTIRE family-a la my mom's side. The usual, everyone talking a LOT and eating and driving each other crazy-gotta love it.  Then back home to C-town around 9 p.m.    Had the weekly phone convo w/ Krissa, and we are both just too hillarious for words, I don't think anyone understands our strange senses of humor except us, so it's probably good she is my best friend.  Anyway, it turns out after going to WAY far apart colleges, we both might end up getting jobs in Springfield and if this happens will probably get a townhouse downtown together-YEAH! HOORAY! The best bachelorette pad, ever. We will be the most fabulous, well-groomed, southern belles that central IL has ever seen-WATCH OUT!    Hopefully  setting up THE job interview for this week-WISH ME LUCK!   Blago---> sucks the big one. The fool is trying to kill of one of the top employers in SO-IL, what will he do next? More ranting on this one later, I'm too tired to go into deep discussion of this right now.   BOO---> guys you aren't attracted to trying to KISS you on barcrawl-yeah, sorry, I AM NOT INTERESTED! HOW CLEAR MUST I MAKE THIS?!? (I realize I forget to add this in my last post, but it was worth mentioning) The only  worse  person I can think of would be...well, you know who I'm talking about, CR's!...and yeah...that thought is too horrific for words, and w/ that I digress.  Oh, and apparently this Brian Colgan character thought I should make out w/ Schlau, who is a little brother type.  Wow-the things drunks say. Sorry, but um, I'm going w/ a big  NO  on this one.     NEW CAR!!!   I'm getting a new car.  I'm so excited! If all goes according to plan I'll have it by the beginning of June! The Redneck Princess and I have had many good times, but nothing stays the same forever, and sometimes it's just time to accept that things have changed and it is time to let go.  This goes for more than cars, btw, but it was a good analogy.     A DOG!   I'm getting a dog for my apt. next year! I won't get her until the beginning of August, but I have decided to get a pug puppy-they are the most adorable dogs and I have ALWAYS wanted one.  I'm also going to get a kitten, bc I love cats and want to get them young so they'll get along.  They will be my roommates next year, bc I think I'm going to live alone, I want to try the "no-roommate" thing for at least a year.  Not that my roommates and I don't get along, but I would kind of like to see what it's like, and that way I can decorate however I want and DO whatever I want, and have whomever I want over.  It will be good times.    I don't know much else except I'm going back to school tomorrow, going to Chicago suburbia on Thursday, and have a lot of general work to do this week-so I'll post more when I have time.  Later all.

       Wow...the end of the semester is here.   Almost.  I can hardly believe that I'm 12 hours & a thesis away from being done w/ my higher education.  (Well...for awhile, at least-I need some time to breathe and live) I have sooooooo much to do before May 7th gets here...luckily, after this semester is over it should be smooth sailing-no more than 8 hours per semester, and my LAST semester (fall) I will have only an internship (for credit!) and my thesis...now that's gonna rock. And I might have a job sometime soon-that is, a REAL one actually doing what I'm interested in...so keep your fingers crossed for me.  Things are stressful as hell right now, but hopefully I'll be able to breathe in a couple of weeks, and it will be bliss to do NOTHING except work for a month.  Summer session starts up in June, ends at the END of July, so it won't be too bad, and then I'll have August to relax...ahhhhhh...   Lorillini!    Lori is officially an ILLINI now!  She got accepted into the Computer Engineering program at UIUC-and I always knew she would.  She was getting very nervous, but got her letter yesterday.  As if they would reject her-she had a 33 on her ACT and a 3.97 GPA-and her college GPA has been just as good for her first year at KC...she'll transfer as a junior in the department.  The child is a genius-I'm not kidding.  Who pulls straight A's while taking 18 hours of Calc 3, Calc-based Physics, Differential Equations, and Linear Algebra? (PLUS Adv. Comp?) Yeah, that would be Lori. Anyhoo, if she has HALF as much fun at U of I as I did, she'll be bound for a wonderful college career-I hope she loves every second.  And I'm going to be only an hour+ away, so hopefully we'll get to see each other a bit more often next year.   Craziness...   This has been such a busy week.  I have finally gotten to the state of sleep deprivation where I have resumed taking naps-you know, I have one of those schedules now where it's sleep when you have any spare time, otherwise you WON'T.  This week has been a mess of committee hearings at the capitol, various papers, work, IARF Spring Meeting, job interview...the list goes on and on.  Oh, and I rediscovered the fact that I have absolutely NO tolerance, as I had a few glasses of wine at the IARF legislative reception Wed. night and was, well, "relaxed" as a result...it's been quite awhile since I've been like that.  It felt good...lucky I didn't drive that evening, though.  Then, Jess fixed vodka tonics for herself, me, and Elizabeth as we watched TV...it's so bad here-people just sit around and drink, people don't even bother going out! Ah well, I guess it's part of going to school on a campus that is far and away from nightlife of any kind (well...except for Bootlegger's...but it doesn't count)-far in away meaning 10 miles, but still that's a pretty long drive when you can just kick it in your living room!   Oh-I did something this week I thought I'd never find myself doing.  I actually APPLAUDED Speaker Madigan after he made a statement at Wednesday's hearing.  Before you criticize me and call me a bad Republican, don't-he was making a jab at Gov. Blago-they are not friends, to put it mildly.  Blago made the statement that he will not balance the budget on the backs of the hard-working citizens of Illinois (that's a lie-bc really, he is-isn't he closing Vandalia prison? And forcing fees on small businesses who are nearly going BANKRUPT trying to pay them? He's a liar and I hate him. HATE HIM!)-well, Speaker Madigan said to Blago's rep at the hearing, "Please take this message to the Governor-we want to let him know that the budget will NOT be balanced on the backs of the DD/MI community!" SWEET! Even Dems know Blago is a dirty bastard.  He's not gonna survive the next election and I cannot wait to work on the opposition's campaign.    I've adopted a new slogan:  I stole it from the Dems-they have "A.B.B."-"Anyone But Bush".  Well, I have adopted " A.B.B. " as well.   "Anyone But Bla-gag-me-vich" .    Yup, my hatred of Blago has gone far past any silly Republican/Democrat thing-bc when it comes down to it, I'm really more of a moderate-socially moderate/liberal, fiscally conservative..with a few exceptions. However, I typically align myself w/ Republican politics, always have.  Anyhoo, Blago is trying his best to kill Southern Illinois simply bc of a few legislators down there that are at odds with him. Specifically he hates Frank Watson-no surprise there. That's fine, Blago, make THEM miserable, but DON'T punish the people who are ultimately responsible for electing you to office!  Downstate is the reason that Blago won the primary, and downstate is responsible for his victory.  Maybe the cold-hearted, unforgiving branch of conservatives say that they deserve it, and they got what they voted for, but I don't think this is true.  Democrats always claim to be champions of the "little man", but this Governor could not be more different.  You do not cut corners in the name of balancing the budget when there are no more corners to be cut!  Vandalia prison is just one example-I don't have relatives or anything working there, so it doesn't affect me (my parents both teach high school); HOWEVER, I do see so many hard-working men and women in my small town who are going to be affected by VCC's closure, and this is just another harmful blow to an already fragile economic system in Southern Illinois.  UUUUGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH... SAVE VANDALIA PRISON!   IMPEACH BLAGOJEVICH!   Well...I could write a lot more now but I'm VERY tired-and tomorrow is basically going to be the longest day ever, and then some...so I'll write more later.  Until then, adieu.

       Time to vent...   Yeah, I was pretty annoyed last night, for various reasons, but luckily I kept my cool.  The last time I lost my temper, REALLY lost it, was junior year, (of HIGH SCHOOL!) and my dears, it wasn't pretty.  Pretty much everyone that knows me knows that I'm pretty easygoing when it comes to most everything, and although at times I have had a penchant for drama, that's all beyond me now.   So last night I was basically accused of downplaying "important" drama, and talking in a "condescending" manner to people.  These accusations came from someone who I (used to-and still do) consider to be one of my best friends.  Let me make a few points here to clarify myself:  seeing as I sometimes have a difficult time doing it over the phone.    I never have been, am not, and never WILL be condescending.  It is NOT in my nature.  I was born and bred to get to know the real person, not the shell of a person-I have friends in all social classes, ranges of intelligence, and ages-I have NEVER been judgemental. NEVER-that is one thing that most people value in me, my ability to be a careful and understanding listener without ever passing judgement of ANY KIND.  If anything, I feel like I have been the one being judged or criticized.    A great example of this is last year, when I was applying for grad schools and informed my friends of my intentions to attend UIS.  My friends from home & KC were overwhelmingly supportive of my decision.  Most of my friends from UIUC thought is was great.  Everyone knows that my interests lie primarily in the practical side of politics-and what better place for me to explore these interests be than the state capitol, where I can get all the practical application of my undergraduate degree I could ever want (with 2 U.S. Congressional districts, U.S. Senators' offices, and state politics GALORE), in addition to earning my M.A.? I thought it was an ideal fit for my ambitions.  Still, I faced the "looks" from some friends of mine who shall remain nameless who seemed to think that UIS was a bad choice, an unprestigious school, and somehow unfit for my abilities.  Needless to say, I missed UIUC at first, but the things I missed had nothing to do w/ education-I missed the social atmosphere, my friends, the bars, etc.  Anyhoo, I went on to do VERY well in the program in addition to getting a great internship with U.S. Congressman John Shimkus.  I decided once and for all that MAYBE the politics of the federal government isn't where my true passion lies, and pursued an internship with on of the state associations downtown, and I can honestly say I've never been happier.  And this has led to what will hopefully be a great job-fingers crossed.    Now, it seems that the same people who appeared critical of me are now 1) either in awe of or shocked by my success, and 2) dare I say, a bit jealous?  That may sound unfair, but I can't help it if that is the vibe I am picking up.  And one person in particular has criticized me for my tirades on how stressful things are right now, and how I just "don't understand" what's going on with other people, but I don't think this could be further from the truth.  I have been a patient listener even when it WASN'T convenient for me. Because that is what friends do.  And I'm sorry, I'm not and never have been the type of person to get a big head just bc I was given power-I know just as well as any other rational human being that power is a fickle friend that can be taken from you as quickly as it is given to you.  And I have NEVER tried to say that my life and my business is so much more important since I'm in grad school and it's a slightly clearer glimpse of the real world-that is not the case.  ESPECIALLY since this so-called drama is something I was a regular part of last year.  It's not unimportant, but my business isn't unimportant either.  And I guess graduating kind of puts a new perspective on things, and makes you realize how silly things you did in the past may have been.  You're still usually glad you did them, for one reason or another, but you can still appreciate the fact things have changed-priorities have changed.  And it kind of makes you try to avoid all avoidable drama at all costs.  Bc you've got so much else going on.    UGH-I guess all I'm trying to say is that I'm exactly the same person that I was last year.  Only slightly more mature, a bit more refined and very much sober.  And if anyone has had to deal with judgemental and "condescending" behavior, I would argue that it was me.  I mean, I love my Chambana friends very much, but you have to admit that I put up with my fair amount of b.s.  The CONSTANT cracks about SO-IL, southern tradition, and all the other ridiculousness-I can't even remember all of it.  It is funny at times but rest assured if you were in my shoes, you would understand that it, like anything else, gets REALLY OLD when you've repeated the SAME JOKE 20 MILLION TIMES!  No, my parents ARE NOT cousins.  Or brother and sister.  The same is true for other families in Centralia.  Centralia and SO-IL isn't entirely composed of dirt roads, cornfields, and cows.  We have a large city nearby, so we're NOT completely alienated from "the real world".  We DO have indoor plumbing.  We appreciate family values and home-cooked meals.  We like living in a place where you can still hear the crickets chirp and see the stars at night.  A place where you can leave your doors unlocked without worrying about being murdered in your bed!  I love my suburbanite friends, they can make fun of this lifestyle if they wish, but frankly, it's not bad.  Not bad at all.  Quite good, actually.  And although I'll probably never live there again, I won't forget my roots.    That was long and I'm not sure if it all made sense. But if it didn't rest assured I'll read over it and clarify if necessary.  Until next time...

       This weekend...   I haven't done much except work and run errands.  Yesterday I had to run over to Chambana to FINALLY order my class ring, since me and my mom haven't had time to make a trip up there to pick one out.  And I graduated last year!  Anyway, it's so cute-it has Chief Illiniwek in the center, surrounded by "University of Illinois", with my degree and year of graduation.  I figure if somehow, someday, the anti-chiefers succeed in their evil quest to get rid of Chief, I'll always have a tribute to him and my days in Chambana.  Anyhoo, I met Natalie for lunch and we went to the mall, where I was reminded why Chambana's mall is crap (EXCEPT for the Gap, which is way better than ours, and Lerner New York-we don't have one! TEAR!).  Then it was back to Springfield and working at FB till the late evening.     3 days!    Till the biggest career possiblity of my life...so far! I have the outfit, I have the skills-all I need now is for them to hire me.  It seems like a GREAT possiblity-considering the behavior of the association thus far, but I am not getting my hopes up until they say, "YOU'RE HIRED!"  Still, it's fun to daydream about the prospect of an exciting job doing EXACTLY what I want to do, and getting paid well for it!  We shall see...until Wednesday comes I have plenty to do.  I kind of wish my interview was another day, bc it is also the day of IARF's spring meeting and lobby day for the members, and I'm going to be EXTRAORDINARILY busy there, along w/ the legislative reception in the evening at the Sangamon club-but I should be able to steal away a couple of hours-hopefully the members will be tied up in meetings at that point of the day.     Tons of work   I have so much stuff to do in the next two weeks, it's sickening.  I'm going to breathe a huge sigh of relief when May 4th rolls around........ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.    What else?   Not much else here-I could start ranting about various things, but that would only take away time from schoolwork, and that is my priority right now-so we'll save the rants for later.  Oh-and Dan Bolin-you are freaking hillarious and I always enjoy your drunk dials (you are the one person who can call me in the middle of the night, and I don't mind TOO much-bc you are so darn entertaining).  ttya'll later.

      WOW-I think I'm in love w/ Stella Blue.    So this is definitely a bar I'll be spending quality time at in the very near future, in addition to next year-it is DIRECTLY across the street from my new apartment! JOY OF JOYS! It has a most EXCELLENT selection of fine liquors from all around the world, and is a nice, quiet, sophisticated setting-perfect for coversation and good drinks.  Went out w/ Marylynn there first, then followed w/ Catch 22, where I ran into people I knew including Bill from Shimkus' office last semester, whom I hadn't seen since December, and WOW-he is just as good-looking and nice as ever, and was always an awesome guy, and seems even moreso when he's out and loosened up.  Anyway, after awhile there we went down the street to D.H. Brown's, but it was absolutely dead quiet so decided to call it a night. BTW, for those of you wondering:  D.H. Brown's to Springfield is like Murphy's to campustown->the place where everyone knows your name, yeah.  It's not hoity-toity, the drinks aren't too expensive, and it's a relaxed atmosphere, but it's very, very popular nonetheless.    Oh-and just for the record-I have found the Springfield equivalent of Kam's-TWO BROTHERS...it SMELLS!!! EWWW!!!  (even from the outside-you know it's bad)  Oh, and random comment:  Campustown, while it has many special places (yes, places) in my heart, is seriously a ripoff.  Drinks-wise.  When it comes to cocktails, they put, like, half a shot of liquor per drink, and charge you $5.  And I always willingly paid it-or, I drank $1 longnecks-part of the reason I don't drink beer anymore-seriously, I can't.  I will PUKE, even after one.  SOOO disgusting. Anyhoo, in downtown Springfield, if you pay $5 for a drink, you get SERIOUS liquor in exchange-I swear to you, the bartender made me a cosmopolitan, and she seriously poured like half a bottle of greygoose in the shaker, plus the other ingredients-needless to say, you can actually get drunk off of one drink-and I know I have a low tolerance, but still.  It's sweet to get REALLY GOOD drinks, and be getting your money's worth-oh-and the margaritas DON'T taste like ***! In my entire time at UIUC, the only bar I found that could mix good margaritas were Brother's and White Horse-and if you don't know it, the margarita is my DRINK-so I'm quite happy with the Springfield bar situation.    Moving on, apparently I am an acceptable candidate for matchmakers.  My roommate's new "male friend" (I'm not sure if it's bf/gf status yet) has a single roommate, and apparently saw me, thought I was acceptable looking, and suggested to Jess that I be invited out with them sometime.  If I hadn't had plans already, I just might have gone. This could be interesting...  Oh! And story of the day, random cute guy in my living room this morning-Jess comes home, and one of her friends is downstairs, unbeknownst to me.  I know it's not her new male companion, seeing as I already met him-and he introduces himself, and seems  extremely  nice and friendly-we all spend a few moments talking about what we all did last night, then it's time for me to head home to C-town.  If he was that nice and friendly with me, straight hair, jeans and t-shirt, and no makeup, I wonder if he'd like to see the glammed-out version of me? :o) Anyhoo, I may just ask Jess for more info about him...I definitely wouldn't mind seeing him around our place more often! Maybe there is life after Chambana dating & what not after all...  Oh, and V is going to be an unofficial roommate this summer-she's working for JBT in Springfield, and plans on crashing when necessary-maybe SHE will also realize that while Chambana life is GOOOOOOD...Springfield ain't bad, darlin'...not bad at all. And believe it or not-it's getting better all the time.

      My roommate Elizabeth needs to learn 3 things:  1) It is NOT cool to knock on people's doors asking them if they are awake when you KNOW that they are not. (I.E.-this morning at 7:30 a.m., and last week, knocking on my door at 1 a.m.)  Especially when SOME of us don't have the luxury of sleeping in all that often.  2) It is NOT cool to yell upstairs to try and talk to us (Jess and me) when you know we are occupied-as in, on the phone, etc.-it's just plain RUDE!   3) If you want to use my printer, FINE-but don't get upset when I tell you it's not working, and *news flash* don't wait until 30 minutes before your class to print out the assignment for that class! COMMON SENSE!   She also needs to learn that normal people like to party and bring friends over.  Jess, being the socialite that she is, had some friends over a couple weeks ago when Elizabeth and Kara were home for the weekend.  They were drinking and having the usual fun times that college kids have, and unbeknownst to Jess, one of them puked in Elizabeth and Kara's bathroom.  Well, Jess had no idea this had taken place, so of course she didn't go and bother checking out their bathrrom.  BIG MISTAKE! Whoever had made the mess had obviously tried to clean it up in their drunken state, but not done a very good job.  Elizabeth comes home, finds a few suspicious specks on her towel and on the floor, and I SWEAR, she completely loses it.  She's crying and whining and pissy, even when Jess tells her she'll clean up the mess.  I swear I've never seen anything like it before.  I mean, if it was me, I would have told Jess about it, cleaned it up (or maybe let her, but whatever), and gone about my business.  We're in college, stuff happens-and it's not like Jess is disrespectful of our stuff or a dirty girl-she's the one who is ALWAYS cleaning things up.  So yeah.    Anyway, Elizabeth responded by telling Kara that she just couldn't stand living here anymore, and proceeded to take all of her stuff out of the kitchen and hide it in her room for spite, acting like a 3 year old.  And she proceeded to ignore all of us, until Jess finally went in and forced her to talk to her, and now things are back to normal-except we all came out of this realizing that Elizabeth is awfully immature for someone who is 22 years old.

       ALMOST there!   WOW-my first year of grad school is almost over.  Only a paper and one big assignment left, and I'm done until June, when I'm taking 2 classes-a lobbying seminar and an online course.  I'm so glad-my last assignment for 511 is going to be a bear, but I'm just glad to almost be done.    My dinner party for this weekend had to be cancelled, unfortunately, thanks to me having to go home under penalty of death-not joking.  I'm planning one for August once I've moved into my new place-it will serve as an apartment-warming party, a reunion for some, goodbye for others, and fun times for all, I'm sure.  It will be fun to see how the personalities of my Chambana and Springfield friends mesh...hmmmm...   Memory Lane   It's so hard to believe it's been almost a year since graduation-yikes.  So much has happened since then, so much has changed-drastically changed.  I still miss many things about U of I, but I can finally say that I'm really happy here.  I'll always cherish my memories of U of I, and I hope that the old gang can get together in 10 years at an alumni function and laugh and goof off just like old times.    Some things I remember fondly...(as we travel down memory lane)   1) Move-in day, 2001, sitting up w/ Alisha (my cousin/roommate turned cousin/roommate/great friend) and talking all night.  The first time I realized that U of I was really gonna be great-and maybe I WOULD find that there was life beyond KC and C-town.  2) George Forman cookouts w/ the B-E girls-particularly, making 2 a.m. Meijer/Super Wal-Mart runs w/ Amanda and co.-filet mignon on the George Forman at 3:30 a.m.! Yeah!  3) Wednesday nights out.  This tradition started my 2nd semester at UIUC, and turned into a regular cult gathering by my last semester! Gotta love all of us at White Ho, downing the infamous rum and coke pitchers in the beer garden w/ the guys smoking like chimneys, singing American Pie and Piano Man-good times, good times.  4) Cubicle/Office hours. This may sound silly, but I bonded w/ some of my favorite people in that darn RSO complex.  5) Campaigning-too much caffeine, too much pizza, WAY too much alcohol and too little sleep-and we all loved every second. And the image of Dan dressed as a barbershop quartet member, dancing on the table in the Berns office to Michelle Branch and Santana will forever be ingrained in my memory.  And who could forget all the nights afterwards at Boltini’s? Not me.   6) Election night, 2002-'nuff said!  7) All those OTHER nights out drinking that haven’t been mentioned…happy hours, CR barcrawls, etc…  8) Formal dinners at Timpone’s w/ Nia, Alisha, and Kamakshi-since most of the time we were eating bagels from late night for dinner, it was always a blast to get away from it (even if it was just across the street) and for a couple of hours, be dressed up and fabulous and dining on some of the best Italian food in Chambana!  9) Dinner parties!  Surprisingly enough, ramen wasn’t all we could cook, or so we found out-Donald, Meghann, Dan, and I had a great 4 weeks last summer!   10) Late nights at the B-E front desk w/ the girls…we would stay up for HOURS talking about absolute nonsense! And having the time of our lives.  11) COLLEGE REPUBLICANS.  The best choice I made in college was joining this organization-hands down.  We had our ups and downs and fights and trying times, but I made some of the best friends I've ever had, had a BLAST, and made a lifetime of memories-all in two short years.  I don't know what it was about our gang, but we had something special-even if it was all too brief.   12) My last hurrah-sure, I ended up sick by the end of the night, but I can’t think of a better way to bid goodbye to the gang than a visit to all of my favorite, err, places in Chambana-one last time! The turnout was great, and the memories are precious.   All right, that's enough of the reminiscing for now-today was crazy as usual, running around the capitol for hearings and doing research at IARF-my internship will be over in about two weeks, and I'll likely be doing something w/ the state republican party for the summer.  Fun times.  Tonight, I'm going to get my dose of "Must See TV", pack for home, and work on stuff for 511 like the good little student I am-no Mowie's tonight. Boo...oh well, summer is almost here!

       Downtown Springfield isn't so bad after all!   Ahh, last night was good times, let me tell you.  It was like the many nights in Chambana all over again, except this time it was different people, better drinks, and a slightly different bar/restaurant atmosphere.  First, we started out at Cinco de Mayo, where I discovered the BEST drink ever made-frozen margaritas with a touch of sangria. You must try this, it will win you over, I PROMISE-even if you don't like them.  Good food and good times were had by all in attendance, and after SEVERAL hours of laughing and other nonsense, (Oh-and I think the waiter wanted to ask me out, lol-he kept telling Angela to say "hi" to that beautiful woman across the table for him-lol-and apparently he meant me. This made me laugh, a LOT) it was time to move downtown-so we did. We headed to Catch 22, which is in the basement of 11 West, a hoity-toity martini bar a la Boltini's, but a lot less fun. Catch 22 is great, though. Anyway, I have found that I am significantly more at ease and significantly MORE charming when I have a few in me.  Me, Marylynn, and Angela proceeded to be loud and obnoxious (but hilarious!) by quoting from the blue-collar comedy tour, and this prompted many gentlemen to gather 'round and listen to our antics-yes, they got quite the show if I do say so myself. So then, don't ask me why, I felt compelled to answer the southern guy at the bar who starting making MORE southern jokes, and I returned the favor until Marylynn pulled me away, telling me he looked a bit too interested.  Since the guy was, well, AVERAGE, I escaped and we continued with our behavior until around midnight, when it was time to depart.     Location, Location, LOCATION!   The best thing I discovered is that my new apartment, which is RIGHT in the middle of downtown (yeah!) is literally within spitting distance of all the good Spfld bars, something I really didn't realize until I was just walking around.  So I'm exicted about my new location for next year-it's gonna be fabulous when I have people over, or just want to go hang out myself.  I guess the best part about everything is that I'm finally starting to feel at home in Springfield-I knew it would take a lot to get me past the homesickness I felt when leaving Chambana (Seriously-ask my parents-they were the ones who had to console me when I was crying my eyes out upon leaving Chambana following graduation-and I don't cry. EVER.) But time heals things like homesickness...and good friends are hard to come by, but come w/ time.  And once again-I am having  THE TIME OF MY LIFE!

       BACK   Hey ya'll, it's been a little while, so here's an update:  So I'm stressing a LITTLE less over final papers and what not, thankfully things will be over soon.  Then I can focus on the 12 hours I have left, and my new child (a.k.a. my thesis-but it's going to be consuming so much time I might as well refer to it as my kid), in addition to working this summer (hopefully doing an internship w/ the state party, BUT we'll see-if not then it's full time at the mall for this girlie).  Oh, and getting a  new car, VERY excited about that, and mentally decorating my fab new apartment downtown, which I will move into in August. YAY!   So yeah, other than school, I have been swamped w/ work at FB and interning downtown-hearings, hearings, hearings, research, research, research! Anyhoo, after I was done w/ IARF business today, I got to say hi to the Chambana gang, (some of them) who were in town for the Senate aprop. hearing for higher ed.-they were giving testimony and stuff-only got to see them for about a half an hour, but it was great to see them, I miss them (some more than others).    Anyhoo, now it's time for errands and class stuff (or not?) and winding down this evening at Cinco de Mayo w/ some friends.  Gotta run now, I'll post more later when I have time to breathe.

      Alright gang, time for an update. You might say I've been busy. I'm tired, so it will be quick.    Tuesday:  Turned in my dreaded AUTHOR LOG for POS 511-it ended up being almost 40 pages, and that had better be good enough for Professor Miller! I worked, my first day full time, rather uneventful.  Wednesday: Worked (again!) then went out for Cinco de Mayo AT Cinco de Mayo-the restaurant.  Cute, huh? They have the best margaritas in town, but not tonight.  The mexicans must have taken the night off to really party, bc the white guy behind the bar made me the CRAPPIEST margaritas that us gals had ever tasted. YUCK! It was like drinking a snowcone w/ tequila-sick! Anyhoo, afterwards (and being hit on by some NASTY men at the bar), I rejoined the girls and we headed downtown and wandered in and out of the various places (it was kind of dead, unfortunately) and ended up at Catch 22 after tequila shots at 11 West. Got hit on by a GORGEOUS gorgeous and friendly guy, unfortunately, I think his friends were gay, bc they kept putting ice cubes in his pants when he was talking to me. Riiiiiiiiiight...anyhoo, he ran to the bathroom and we switched tables, so that was the end of that.  Me, Marylynn, and Mary were definitely amused. Oh-and I ran into Emily from KC, I had completely forgotten she goes to school up here! Kind of interesting how those things happen.  Anyhoo, at around 12:30 it was time to call it a night.    Thursday: Work, then Stella Blue w/ Marylynn and Angela. Fun times, just sitting around chatting, and Angela getting hit on by a nasty old drunk at the bar-gross.    Friday: Sleep, work, then hanging out (what I'm doing now).  I was supposed to go to STL to hang w/ Cheryl and co., but plans fell through when the battery light on my car started blinking. BOO! So, relaxed-since I need to do that sometimes-I can't go out EVERY night.  Work again, tomorrow, dreaded 15 hour sale revisited, then a short trip home on Sunday for Mother's Day, will likely come back Sunday evening.    Summer is bliss...no classes for a few weeks, and when they start they will be EASY, a stress-free job, a new car in a little over a month, lots of nights out, 16 hours away from my M.A., moving to my new place at the end of July, etc. etc. etc. Also going back to Chambana to visit the entire gang one last time (next Friday)-I mean, of course I'll be going back to visit after this, but this is likely the last time the whole "old school gang" will be together drinking there, or at least one of the last times.  It's hard to believe a lot of my friends are graduating and won't be around (even close by) next year, but I had a year to soften the blow of separation, so I think it will be harder for them than me-not that I love them any less, but I've had a year to move on, so to speak.  I think if I had graduated this year things would have hurt perhaps a bit more-maybe. But whatever. It will be amusing to see where we all are in 10 years-that's one reunion I surely won't miss for the world.    Anyway, there will be lots more of exciting details later, but frankly, I'm about to crash. And I need to get to sleep before Jess and co. drunkenly stumble in...hehe.  Kara's moving out tomorrow, I will miss her! She's been an awesome roommate, but I think Jess and I will have a good summer-and Brandis is moving in next week.  I have a feeling we're going to have a great summer, and I couldn't be too much happier with the way things are going now.    OH-P.S. There's this guy at my internship-we've casually talked for the past couple months, but nothing too long or too serious.  I've got two weeks left-I'm taking a vote.  Should I a) Keep talking to him, but do nothing b) ask him out for coffee or c) ignore things completely.  IM me your votes.  Keep in mind I have NEVER asked a guy out in my life, but he's cute and I'm kinda interested.  I'll let you know how things go. MORE LATER...

      First, I have ONE DINKY PAPER left and then my semester is OVER! The author log, after a day of extremely hard work, is DONE! YAY!  Second, the fact that Taco Bell in Springfield has reopened is both very, very good and very, very bad:  I have eaten dinner there 3 times out of the past 4 days-that is how much I have missed it (the nearest one to Springfield was 40 miles-so yeah).  This can be nothing but badness-the ten pounds I have lost are going to pile themselves back on-I MUST be strong...but their cheap chicken quesadillas and mild sauce OWN me!   Third, I LOVE SPRINGFIELD. This summer is going to be awesome.  :o)   Finally-I'm going to bed. G'night! More later...

Oh, and UIS Student Trustee Andrew does think you're a cool guy-it's awesome that I know and party with 2/3 of the student representation on the UI BOT!

      WOW, my room is destroyed.  I had to empty out both my dresser AND my desk (the housing goons are replacing all the furniture in the townhouse bedrooms), so my stuff is piled haphazardly around my room, hopefully far enough away from my furniture that they can move it out safely.  YUCK.  It wouldn't have been so bad if they hadn't told us TODAY that they were planning on moving stuff TOMORROW! JERKS! Me and Jess were pissed, but hey, what can ya do?   American Idol Update  After the tragic loss of George Huff last week (when Jasmine SHOULD have gone home...I HATE HER!), it becomes ever so clear that Jasmine should definitely be leaving.  Diana ruled, as usual, Fantasia was good but not spectacular (she is kind of an acquired taste, but I haven't really acquired that kind of music taste thus far), and LaToya was great as usual.  Personally, Diana is my favorite, she's got an amazing voice, she can dance, and she's got style.  I miss my John Stevens, but even I am willing to admit that he was really crappy towards the end-he needs to stick to his Frank and Bing and Dean and he'll do just fine.    I AM SO TIRED. And I hate that my room is a mess now.  And it will be for a week, until they bring the new furniture.  While the furniture is out, I'm going to try and organize everything. TRY being the operative word.    I have a LOT more to say, about a lot of different topics, but I really don't have time right now, seeing as I'm about to pass out from sheer exhaustion. I'll post more tomorrow when I have time.

      OMG I'm so psyched that I only have 12 hours left (plus one big, nasty, thesis-but still).  MY NIGHTMARISH CLASSES ARE OVER!  I have: 1 internship, 1 lobbying seminar, and 1 random course I have yet to decide on, and THAT IS IT!!! No one can possibly understand how happy this makes me.  I have met all of the required courses for my program, except for one, and it's going to be a breeze.  This summer can officially start being fun after my internship ends this week.  Don't get me wrong, it's been A LOT of fun, and I totally love my co-workers, but it's been a way-stressful semester and I can't say I'm sorry to see things die down a bit.  I am looking forward to one last summer of a stress-free job and relaxing nights out on the town.  Anyhoo-digression-if you go to UIS and have any brilliant ideas on interesting and EASY courses to take, PLEASE let me know.  I'm growing exceedingly lazy in completing my degree, so when I say EASY, I mean it.  I have suffered enough this semester. Seriously.    So today was a very long, emotional day...that's all I'm going to say about it now, (I don't have the time or energy to elaborate at this moment) but sheesh I'm glad I will be able to enjoy a good night's sleep tonight-at least I hope I will.    I need to do laundry, clean clean CLEAN my room, move my stuff to the new room downstairs, etc.  In addition to working full time.  And finishing my internship.  All this and stupid classes start up again in a month. Oh school, how I hate thee sometimes...what a burden you can be. I will be so happy when December rolls around.   HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY MAMA! I love ya.    This hasn't been the most organized post, but I'm kind of frazzled today.  More later...hopefully I'll have it together a bit better.

      Well guys, it's been awhile...time for an update.    For starters, I haven't been online, bc I STILL have no desk.  However, I have made a makeshift desk out of my bookshelf and my desk chair.  I've also moved into the downstairs bedroom.  Brandis moved in today and Jess moved into my old room-it should be a fun summer. The girls are great!   Last Friday, I got to spend some quality time saying a proper farewell to the Chambanites, but in all honesty, it really wasn't like old times and I can't say I'm really sad about anything.  We all had our good times, but there comes a time in your life when you have to move on.  The sooner you learn this, the better.    Also, a couple of my friends told me how lucky I was to graduate LAST year and escape all the drama of this year.  For awhile during the beginning of Fall semester, I would have given anything to be back in Chambana, but now, I realize that it really turned out for the best.  I get so tired of the random drama and by the time October rolled around, it was clear things had changed dramatically-for the worse.  Victoria was commenting on my graduation barcrawl the year before, and how well everyone got along and how happy everyone was. I told Victoria-while I missed everyone in the beginning, I still followed my own advice...that being-"Don't ever be the last to leave the party.  You want to leave while you're still the life of it.  That way, you can come back and visit anytime.  Otherwise, you'll find yourself unwelcome and outdated."    Needless to say, this has proved to be pretty true.    Things are great.  I just got my grades, I did very well, so I'm quite happy.  Only 12 hours and I'll have my M.A.! It's so hard to believe.  The social life is active once again.  Work is crappy, but my co-workers are great.  Classes start in 2 weeks.  My internship is over, going out to lunch w/ everyone on Monday as a farewell of sorts.    Not much else that I can recall at this moment...getting ready to run to Wal-Mart, semi-watching the Daytime Emmys with the girls, and going up to Chicago tomorrow to visit V for her graduation shindig.  More later ya'll...it's time to relax. It's been a long week.

       Quick note-   In case you're wondering if I've died and fallen off the face of the earth, I haven't-however, our furniture in our townhouse is being replaced, therefore we've been without for a few days (desks, that is) which makes sitting at your computer increasing difficult. And since there is no internet access DOWNSTAIRS, I'm just out of luck for a few days. Anyway, I promise to have long and detailed posts coming your way very soon, and until then, sorry for any inconvenience for shorting so MANY of you on your daily reading material. haha.  -A.L.

      Hey gang, it's been awhile (for all three of you who read this, that is)  So, I've been thinking the last few weeks, about graduation (in December) and how NOT READY I feel for entry into the "Real World".  Sure, a fat paycheck and ultra-luxurious surroundings would be nice, but to be perfectly honestly, I do like my life right now.  Anyway, considering the fact that I DO plan on continuing my education (whether it be for an additional M.A. or even a Ph.D.-in Public Administration-not sure yet), I am torn between searching for a job or continuing my education before I get tied down.  Knowing full and well if I get married any time soon (God forbid), or even MEET someone SIGNIFICANT (note-significant does not include any of the following: make-out buddies, random dates, or anything in between), I will be reluctant to continue.  In addition, there's the fact that, despite my residence here for the past 23 years and 5 months, I truly hate Illinois (except for parts of SO-IL, and maybe bits and pieces of the rest of the state).  For one, it is an ugly, ugly state. Second, the weather is horrible. Third, the people leave something to be desired. Fourth, the food is terrible. Fifth, I hate Illinois politics-Chicago will always be the boss and there will be no changing that unless Daly and/or Blagojevich and all of their followers perish. Needless to say, I want to apply OUTSIDE of Illinois-I have no intentions of staying here, no matter what part of the state it is.  Which brings me to my dream place to live.  Everyone knows I love state politics...and everyone knows I LOVE country music...and everyone knows my second home is and always has been...TENNESSEE.  So I'm pretty much smitten with the idea of moving to Nashville, or somewhere near there, to continue my education, and then to end up living there.  It would combine my 2 true loves in life, and of course you can't beat good ol' Southern Hospitality.    So it's unofficial, of course...but there's a good chance I'll be going on to school past graduation at UIS.  I've even picked a day to take the GRE...(yes, I avoided the GRE when applying to UIS-thank goodness) fun times.  I plan on applying to several southern schools, including University of Tennessee, Tennessee State University (located in Nashville), Ole Miss, Louisiana State, UGA, and just for kicks, I might throw in a D.C. school, probably George Washington University, even though I have no intentions of going there.  I'm seriously afraid though, if I don't leave now, I will find myself in Illinois 5 years from now, working in Springfield-and while there are worse things, I want more for myself.    Anyhoo, it's been a very long day, but I'll post more later.  For all reading this, IM me about my BBQ on Monday! It should be good times.

       Bolingbrook or Bust   Survived the trip to suburbia, in all honestly, it was quite fun. Downtown Naperville is so cute, and I have greaaaaaaatt pictures. This weekend was good times. More details to follow later tonight, when I have time for a real post.   Redneck Woman   I bought a CD for the first time in quite awhile (I enjoy Wal-Mart's 88 cent MP3's a little too much), it being "Here For the Party" by Gretchen Wilson.  In addition to being from Southern Illinois, she has amazing talent and isn't another cookie-cutter country princess.  I'll let you know how the CD is once I've listened to the entire thing.  I've listened to four songs so far, and so far, the verdict is.........awesome!  Ok I will write more later tonight when I've rested a bit...suburbia was a long drive...until then I'll share this announcement:   BARBEQUE  Memorial Day May 31st, 2004 5 p.m.-??? Hosted by the girls of Marigold Court, #5 2111 Carl Sandburg Ln. Springfield, IL 62703 (217) 417-2901  If you're reading this and I know you, consider yourself invited.  It should be good times.  But rest assured, if anyone tries to build a fort, there will be hell to pay!

       Home Sweet Centralia.   Yep, I'm home in Centralia for the time being, until tomorrow night. Arrived back in town yesterday afternoon, to find only that it hasn't changed much since my last trip home. Yup. After Jami's graduation festivities, I got my first night of good sleep in quite awhile...that is, until my mother so kindly woke me up this morning with her LOUD conversation with my grandmother. Anyhoo, after I fell back asleep, I woke up again naturally and spend the day relaxing followed by a trip to the grocery store w/ my dad.  We're grilling ribeyes, chicken, corn, and equally yummy stuff tonight, and I plan on spending the remainder of the evening doing ??? We'll see where things go.  Tomorrow I'll be heading back in the late evening, after meeting Cheryl for dinner in STL.    So, I don't think my parents are thrilled with my plans for more school.  They think that I should find a job, work for a few years, save money, and then decide if I want more education.  As for me, I know very well that if I DON'T go on now, I will probably find an excuse not to go any further, period.  I'll find myself in Springfield in ten years, and will always wonder what it would have been like if I had left.  However, I made a decision in my life last year, after various things happened, and that decision was to never live to "regret"-don't leave things unsaid or undone, because it's very likely that you'll live to regret it.  The point is, I don't like Illinois, and I DON'T want to be here in ten years-so I'm applying to grad school and come a year from now, you will very likely find me in a much different (and likely southern) locale.  If my family thinks I'm making a mistake, then that's their problem-some of us aren't meant to "settle"-at least not any time before we're ready to.    Not that my parents aren't supportive. I don't mean to sound like that. But I DO think they want me to "settle", and I'm nowhere near ready to be one of THOSE people-I have my whole life for that.  Right now I'm living for me.   With that said, I will leave you with one of my favorite quotes-one that my cousin Alisha discovered during our U of I days:   "Some people may say you are going the wrong way, when it is simply a way of your own.  "-Anonymous

      So my room is finally in order now that I've moved downstairs and I'm feeling organized again.  Hooray. Work is the same, full-time kinda sucks but I'm the most relaxed I've been in quite awhile so it's nice to have a stress-free job.  And I got a raise for being full-time...so yay.  My intership gang bid farewell to me last Monday...it was a great experience but I'm glad I won't have any internships tying me down this summer.    Session will hopefully end tomorrow for the summer...things in IL government are the most dysfunctional I've ever seen them...but this is to be expected.  Jess brought her old Nintendo back, and we have played games for the past 3 hours straight.  We keep talking about exercise and dieting, but end up eating and sitting in front of the TV watching Soap Network.  (and now playing Nintendo) We haven't gained any weight, but we certainly haven' lost...yet. The Tae-Bo tapes are sitting there and we WILL use them...seriously, we will...just wait. Hopefully Michelle will get us motivated once she moves in...she is an exercise buff.   Movies I want to see (so far) this summer:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban -I've been waiting FOREVER!!! The remake of  The Stepford Wives   We are having a BBQ tomorrow starting at 7 p.m. so if you read this, COME. Call me for directions.  So in short, so far this summer has been nothing but TV, barbequeing, going out, playing video games, the occasional exercise, and working.  Very relaxing. It's a nice feeling.  I'm going home on Tuesday for Jami's graduation (I have three days off in a row, and one of them is even paid-SCORE!), and I will be back Friday morning. I'm not sure why I mentioned that, but if you're from C-town and reading this and you'll be in town, call me and we'll hang out.  That's all for now. Later everyone.

      Ronald and Ray in one week. I'm not sure I can stand much else.  Let this be my tribute to Ray Charles, one of the great musicians (in my opinion) of our time.  I started playing piano very young, at (barely) age 5, and Ray Charles was always a larger-than-life musical icon to me.  He played and wrote with the best of them, all the while being blind.  In addition, he made a great name for himself, being recognized as an accomplished musician during a very difficult era for his people.  When I thought of great pianists, I thought of Beethoven, sure, but I also thought of Ray Charles.  He forever will be one of my musical influences (despite the fact I don't get to play as much an more), and no doubts will be missed very much by musicians and fans of all genres.    With that I'll share one of my all-time favorite songs with you, from the man himself: here's to you, Ray.   Georgia, Georgia, The whole day through Just an old sweet song Keeps Georgia on my mind  I'm say Georgia Georgia A song of you Comes as sweet and clear As moonlight through the pines  Other arms reach out to me Other eyes smile tenderly Still in peaceful dreams I see The road leads back to you  I said Georgia, Ooh Georgia, no peace I find Just an old sweet song Keeps Georgia on my mind  Other arms reach out to me Other eyes smile tenderly Still in peaceful dreams I see The road leads back to you  Georgia, Georgia, No peace, no peace I find Just this old, sweet song Keeps Georgia on my mind  I said just an old sweet song, Keeps Georgia on my mind    (Funny how 3 of my all-time favorite songs relate to GEORGIA-those being "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" {written by Vicki Lawrence, performed by her and Reba} and "Midnight Train to Georgia" {written by Jim Weatherly, performed by Gladys Knight and the Pips}-but this particular Georia song takes the cake)  While I'm talking about great men who died this week, I'll go back to Ronald Reagan for a second-I was appalled to hear rumors that Bill Clinton is miffed to be left off the speaker list at his funeral.  Frankly, I am annoyed at the mere thought of this, seeing as it should be clear to anyone that the only reason he's interested in speaking is to get PR in order to promote his new book. However, he's trying to make it sound like the Republicans are "excluding" him. What a jerk, and so disrespectful to Reagan's memory.  You don't hear Carter bitching, or FORD for that matter, and he's a GOPer. Now is not a time for bitching between the political parties.  Ok. Enough banter.  May Ray and Ronald rest in peace...they will certainly be remembered by those of us they left behind.

      Nintendo, walk around campus, then MORE Nintendo. At least we walked tonight, right?   Wow...with such fabulous entertainment as we have, it's a wonder that any of us have social lives. Like Michelle said tonight, "Hey, are you guys going out?"  Our response: "WHY? We have THIS!!!"-regarding the Nintendo.   Keep in mind, it's not even a new and fancy Nintendo. We're talking old-school Nintendo and old-school games. And it is FABULOUS.   Who needs boyfriends...we have Mario and Luigi...and they will always be faithful to us...lmao.   LOL-I hope you all know that I am joking to some degree about our obsessions. Really...  With that final note I do believe it's time for bed. We're actually attending a cookout in addition to going out on Friday night, as to save ourselves from Super Mario Land. And I'm going home for a few days on Saturday, so I'll (hopefully) get some of it out of my system. On a sidenote, at least we don't snack while playing. So we won't turn into fatasses. And we are sticking to an exercise routine. There's hope for us.

      It's 6:54 a.m. and I'm getting ready to hop in the shower, just as soon as my roommate gets out. I'm tired, but work beckons so it's up and at 'em for me.  I won't complain; as much as I hate retail nowadays I'm glad I have a non-stressful summer job-you wouldn't find me down at the capitol if my life depended on it. Speaking of which, they're going into special session today. I swear, they're just like a bunch of kids sometimes. I'm far too young to experience burnout, right? I hope this phase, like everything else will pass.   I apologize for my lack of insightful, meaningful, and thought-provoking posts lately-I've been too tired, and frankly too busy to take time to write more than just the general wrap of my day/week, but rest assured I'll write more soon.    For those of you who actually read this (all three of you), I have decided to forgo Chambana this evening due to my sleeplessness and piles-o-stuff to do tomorrow...but maybe next week? Gosh, I'm getting old. Me and Victoria went out after work last night (for those of you who don't know, she's working in Springfield for the summer, so she's been crashing on our couch occasionally), and were dead tired after an hour. LAME!   I'm so glad to be going home for the weekend. Leaving Friday, not coming back till Tuesday morning. I miss Centralia (don't laugh, I really do sometimes), I miss my kitty, and I miss going out down there, and running into half my friends from KC and high school-as lame as it sounds, ...seriously, if I ever just decide to ditch the whole politics thing, it's likely I'll look for a teaching position at one of the community colleges in that area. Now, I don't consider myself jaded and bitter-YET. So maybe there's still hope for me on that level.    With that said, I must get ready for work. I'll try to write more tomorrow.

      So guys, I've been being kind of lazy w/ this thing, but you'll have to forgive, seeing as I'm working 40 hours a week and starting 6 hours of class this week, PLUS working on my thesis. Yick. I'll try to keep ya'll updated at least once a week.    First, Ronald Reagan, the Great Communicator, our 40th president, died Saturday.  A political maverick, unwilling to conform to the party bosses. Confident in his own abilities, and unafraid of going forth with his own agenda. He is my second political hero to die in the past twelve months-with the first being Paul Simon.  It's sad to see him go, but his suffering has stopped so in many ways I suppose it is a blessing.  To the man who ended the Cold War, revitalized the Republican Party, and restored faith in the presidency, I offer the following words:  "All in all, not bad. Not bad at all."-words from Reagan's farewell speech.  Second,    Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban     The movie was fantastic. Yes, it varied at times from the book, but it was done in a very tasteful way.  The acting was the best I've seen in a HP movie thus far, and it was an all-around good time. I can't wait for  Goblet of Fire.  I may be 23 years old, but I still LOVE LOVE LOVE Harry Potter!  Third, classes start this week. Woo-ha. Taking a lobbying seminar and 2 hours of thesis prep.  Fourth, I'll be in Chambana for KARAOKE on Wednesday night! YAY! I'm riding back with Victoria, who is conveniently working in Springfield this summer, and can basically be my ride if I want one. So if you're in town and bored and happen to read this-come out! Hopefully it will be fun.    Fifth, the BBQ on Memorial Day was fun. If you didn't come, you're a loser!  All in all, things are busy but good. Even fun. Although I'm worked to death, the summer is going pretty well, and actually a bit of a break compared to last semester. I mean, there are days that I actually get to sleep in-so that's something, right?

      So it's been a bit...  You might say it's been a long week. Because actually, it has been.   Working and going to class are taking up most of my time nowadays, in addition to sitting on the porch screaming obscenities with Jess in the late evening-it's a wonderful stress reliever! (don't ask) Also, I've started playing tennis again...I'm no Serena Williams, but I manage to have a good time and get some exercise, while enjoying myself.    Honestly, I don't have much new to report: my life nowadays is remarkably drama-free, consisting of school, work, going out, and occasionally playing nintendo.  I'm currently home for father's day-last night I went out for margaritas and Shrek II with some friends,  and it was fun enough.  Today I worked, then headed home, and currently write this after an evening of catching up and drinking margaritas with Alisha.  Now I'm getting ready for bed...and I don't have much more to say except that the only downfall right now is I'm not sleeping in as much as I would like to.    More later, 'cause it's time for bed.

      Update:  Home in Centralia. Spent yesterday wandering around STL w/ the family, Forest Park, then down to Laclede's Landing.  First, we went in this freaky little wax museum that me, Krissa, and Cheryl explored 3 summers ago during a VERY hot Fair St. Louis...it was creepy but fun. For dinner we headed to the Old Spaghetti Factory right down the street. Good stuff. Happy Birthday to my mom! The whole restaurant sang to her and I think she was successfully embarassed. I really miss STL. I hadn't been down to the landing for...GET THS...almost three years! Afterwards. we hit Garden Ridge on the way home, and who did I run into but...la familia de el "ex-factor". Yeesh. After the obligatory "Hi, how are you?" and forced niceness, I forced  myself  NOT take another trip down memory lane, as I find I have been doing as of late. If the past two years have done anything for me, they have forced me to grow up and realize that my life is not necessarily going to resemble the cookie-cutter picture-perfect existence only seen in Happy Days or another unrealistic 50's sitcom...my life has had twists and turns and bumps and ups and downs, and frankly...I'm ok with that. It keeps things exciting. After all, what fun would life be if we all took the same path? Exactly.    Anyway, today we're having some typical Southern IL afternoon festivities (what do people do in SO-IL when it's summer and a nice day? Cook out, of course), and then I'll  probably be heading back over to the 'lou with some friends from home for the evening. I'll talk to ya'll more later...if you're in town, and reading this, and I haven't seen you in awhile, you're welcome to stop by!

      Hey everyone!  Currently avoiding packing, instead I'm writing in this lovely little waste of time that is of interest to no more than 5 people...lol.    I woke up in dreadful pain this morning, thanks to an aggressive game of tennis with the roommates last night. Wow, I'm so out of shape-tennis takes endurance and I seem to have lost most of mine.  Ah well-nothing will bring it back except more exercise, so that's what I'll have to keep doing.   To change the subject-I consider myself a pretty fair cook, all things considered, but my newest specialty is oatmeal cookie bars-my roommates went nuts, so nuts that Jess told her father about them and he now wants the recipe. Step aside, Betty Crocker!   In other news, I've seen 3 movies so far this summer, which is one of the reasons I like summer, because I never seem to have time to watch any during the year.      Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  -fantastic! Even if it didn't follow the book entirely   The Stepford Wives  -overrated, but funny   Shrek II  -Very clever, but not quite as hilarious as I had expected. Very enjoyable, nonetheless.   Next on my list:   Farenheit 9/11   What can I say, it sounds quite interesting. Plus, I need to prove to liberals everywhere (including you, Lance) that I'm not as hard-core right-wing as they come, in addition to being open-minded and a proponent of civil rights.   Moving on with this somewhat random post:  Things I'm annoyed about right now and will rant about:  MEN-they pretty much suck right now, the only decent men I know are a select few related ones in addition to some guy friends, none of them people I would ever date.  As for the rest of them...the ones I have encountered lately belong to the following categories:  1) Emotionally unavailable a-holes who run from their emotions in favor of instant gratification-but not before breaking your heart or at the very least making you slightly bitter/jaded about relationships. (I'm not even going to comment, but for any of you girls who have been in this situation, I feel your pain!)  Example: Mr. Big from Sex and the City  2) Unchivalrous, arrogant jerks who show no respect for women by violating their personal space when it's obvious the woman they're hitting on has no interest in them, and would rather spend an afternoon getting a root canal as opposed to being in their presence. (Take for example, the other night I was out w/ the girls. I think all of us have been in this situation a time or two)  Example: Daniel Cleaver from Bridget Jones' diary: he was cute and charming but seriously couldn't take a hint once Bridget had decided to move on-very, very pushy!    3) Sweet, understanding, attentive guys, who hang on to your every word and treat you with respect...only to reveal in later conversation that they have a girlfriend/fiancee/wife. (I'm encountered many of these, and they aren't jerks at all-the problem is, they make some of us feel like there's no good ones left!)  Example: Aidan Shaw from Sex and the City  4) The cute, boring guy-a guy who wouuld obviously date you, but unfortunately you have no interest whatsoever. Yeah, sorry. Been there, don't that-don't wanna go back.   Like Carrie (from SATC) said:  "Some people are settling down, some people are settling and some people refuse to settle for anything less than butterflies."  I'm not interested in finding "Mr. Right"-not for quite some time. I'm nowhere near ready to get married and I don't think I will be for a long time. But I don't want "Mr. Right Now"-for obvious reasons.  If I could find someone in between-a nice, considerate, yet quirky & interesting guy who wouldn't necessarily need a lifetime committment (but wouldn't be afraid to stick around for awhile)-that would be ideal.   So...the real question is:   Where do you find such a guy?  and...  Do these guys exist?  I myself am not so sure...  Whenever I DO find the right guy, the ideal relationship would be something of a partnership-neither one having to give up any of their interests or desires, yet somehow managing to complement each other-not complete each other, because if you're interested in finding someone to "complete" your life, your life is likely something that needs improvement before you start looking for a soulmate.    I can't say that the women of the world are without blame.  In many cases they're the ones responsible for men turning into jerks.  The trick is getting these emotionally scarred men into the mindset that ALL women are NOT inconsiderate b*****s, and that learning to trust isn't necessarily a bad thing.    Ok, enough of ranting. I don't want to scare the 3 people that DO read this away from ever reading it again-but it's just something to be frusterated about, and this is my personal space for telling stories and venting, so why not?  Stay tuned for my next rant-which will discuss the lack of "genuine" people in the world.   Meanwhile, I wish HAPPY WEEKEND to everyone! With that I'm off to class, then packing, then Nashville! YAY! It should be fabulous. Stay tuned for details on my trip-talk to everyone later!

      Sorry for not posting much lately, I've been busy as well as sleep deprived.   Tomorrow marks the last day of inventory-thank God. I'll admit, summer inventory is much better than winter inventory, 5:45 isn't nearly as bad when it's 70 degrees and the sun is rising outside (as opposed to the winter, where it's -20 and pitch black with snow everywhere). Still, 5:45 a.m. is awfully early to be at work, so I'm glad tomorrow is the last day. I took a 4 hour nap Monday afternoon, and that has helped make the week more manageable, because I was severely sleep deprived before then.    Right now: Watching CMT 100 greatest love songs-I am the biggest CMT junkie the world has ever seen, and this is only helping me get in the mood for Nashville and the Grand Ole Opry, which I will be seeing THIS WEEKEND! AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! I am so excited, I'm about to scream.  I've been to Nashville before, of course, but I was a baby the last time I went to the Opry...then followed the youthful hatred of country, and when I turned 18 it was like a switch flicked and I fell in love with country music all over again-aww, hooray.   Country Concerts I'll be attending this summer:  Kenny Chesney (3rd time to see him) Toby Keith (surprisingly, I've never seen him in concert, yet he is one of my favorite artists: however, his concerts have always conflicted with my schedule) Brooks & Dunn, Montgomery Gentry, and Gretchen Wilson (this one will be AMAZING-I have seen MG before, and they were even more amazing than I had hoped for-I expect B&D and Gretchen to be just as awesome) George Jones (MY ALL TIME FAVORITE country male musician. He's going to be at the IL state fair and I cannot wait-I jumped up and down and shrieked when I heard about the concert)  Oh, and I'm hoping to make an end-of-summer road trip to Nashville to see the Opry again, in addition to hit the best night spots there-so if you're game, let me KNOW!   Anyway, back to the countdown: they've included many of my favorite country songs, including the following: (Sorry, I'm in an obsessive country music mood right now-with good reason!)  I Cross My Heart (George Strait) I Wouldn't Have Missed it for the World (Ronnie Milsap) Forever and Ever, Amen (Randy Travis) You Were Always on my Mind (Willie Nelson-but I liked the Elvis version much better) Hello Darlin AND You've Never Been This Far Before (Conway Twitty-haha I will always love him!) Strawberry Wine (Deana Carter) Your Everything (Keith Urban) I Believe in You (Don Williams) Annie's Song (John Denver) Cowboy Take Me Away (Dixie Chicks) Something That We Do (Clint Black) In Another's Eyes (Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood) The Heart Won't Lie (Reba McIntire and Vince Gill) When You Say Nothing at All (originally by Keith Whitley, redone by Alison Krauss-both versions amazing, although I'll always love the original) She's in Love with the Boy (Trisha Yearwood)  ...and finally...  I Will Always Love You (Dolly Parton)  Ok, so there's a few...oh how I love country music.  Like them or not...these are some of my favorite country love songs-and I'm quite glad that CMT decided to recognize them!  Meanwhile, enough of the music stuff, it's time for tennis w/ Jess and Brandis. More later, and a full account of the trip when I return next week! HOORAY for time off! I'm working too much, but summer is definitely going well.

      Ok, it's been awhile so here's the rundown of the last week:  Nashville was AWESOME! I had a blast at the opry, although I don't think the 'rents and the sibs were quite as thrilled. My dad (a formally trained pro-photog) took some amazing pictures, one of the best being the one where the famous Whisperin' Bill Anderson looked STRAIGHT at my dad and grinned! Anyway, other opry performers included: Rachel Proctor, Steve Azar, Connie Smith (to name a few well-knowns), in addition to one of George Strait's songwriters and the new guy who sings "I Miss Billy the Kid"-in addition to a lot of old time country singers of my grandparents generation, as well as some bluegrass performers. It was absolutely fantastic, I'm just upset that I missed Vince Gill (who sang the following night) and Trace Adkins (on the Tuesday night opry)-I would have stayed much longer if I could, but it's only a 4 hour drive from C-town, and everyone knows how much I love it down there, so of course I'm planning a trip down there before the end of summer. Anyway, the rest of the weekend was spent at Opry Mills and just wandering around Nashville.  The shopping was great, purchases include the following:  Straw Cowboy Hat (shut up, you know I had to have it) 2 new tops (Banana Republic and Old Navy) 1 new purse (dark red leather, from Wilson's Leather-bringing my purse total to over 20-hey, there are far more unHEALTHY obsessions) a LOT of cute underwear-me, Lori, and Jami bought about 40 pairs between the three of us!  After Nashville, we headed to Memphis-land to visit with the grandparents, and headed home to C-town, where I remained for a few days. Saw Spiderman 2 and The Notebook: Spiderman 2 was okay, quite predictable but not entirely terrible. The Notebook was INCREDIBLE, I absolutely loved it-it was so sweet and romantic, yet not a chick-flick, I think most decent guys would like/appreciate it. I read the book first and I think the movie was just as good as the book, a rarity in cinema.  I won't talk too much about it, because I don't want to ruin it, but it's a great film, the best I've seen in  a long time.   Anyway, after a nice week of R&R away from the hustle and bustle of Springfield, I'm back-my roommates and I celebrated absolutely nothing yesterday varied beverages and after a long day, I fell into bed, quite relaxed.   Right now it's Saturday afternoon and I'm enjoying doing absolutely nothing. Tomorrow I'm either going to FSL or Dan and Joe's, haven't decided yet. Happy 4th of July!

      4th recap:  The weekend was overall good-my last relaxing bit of vacation. Ugh. I HATE Famous Barr, it is the devil, and after next month I will NEVER work retail again unless my life literally depends on it. UGH.   Anyway, Saturday was spent being a lazy bum in my apt. and it felt fantastic...not having to go anywhere or do ANYTHING. Sunday morning was spent watching movies w/ Jess, and then I got ready and drove over to Chambana for Bolin's party, seeing as I haven't been there for like 2 months and hadn't seen much of the gang in that long.   Anyway, I show up and greet everyone, even though I really didn't know many people, other than Bolin and Diller. I sit on the porch talking to people in general, but mainly catching up with Diller, and then talking to both him and Meghann (his girlfriend) for quite a time. Joe was also there, and Garrett and Schlau showed up as well. Additionally, there were some new CR's/ISGers that I didn't know, but of course politely greeted along with everyone else. Anyhoo, it was good to see everyone. After the fireworks at Memorial Stadium, it was back to 1004 for more food and drinking-I didn't drink anything, because I find beer repulsive. However, I was introduced to a new invention called the "kegerator", a ridiculous invention by Garrett that is essentially a KEG in a refrigerator, with a spigot on the outside. As you would imagine, the result is EXTREMELY cold beer. Anyway, the boys (there were three girls there-TOTAL-me, Jenny (Dan's girlfriend) and another old CR) drank ridiculous amounts of beer, with Garrett insisting that his goal was to end up at the hospital at the end of the night like this poor guy Ryan who (unfortunately) believed that he could outdrink him on New Years and suffered such a fate. Anyway, most people would probably tell you that one of the more amusing events of the evening was Garrett challenging EVERYONE to a chugging contest, drinking (seriously) like half the keg, and growing EXTREMELY beligerent. I'll leave the comments at that and abstain from sharing my own opinions-let me just say that some people should have SERIOUS limits on how much they're allowed to drink in the presence of others.   Anyway, the evening ended with 2 specific people getting in a fight (no comment, but apparently these kids are roommates), and the rest of us halfway laughing and rolling our eyes at the ridiculousness of it.  Afterwards, myself and the 1004ers watched improv comedy and ate pokeys and fell asleep. I left the following morning around 10.   Anyway, back in Springfield it's relatively uneventful. Back to work, etc. I'll post more later-right now I'm tired and heading for bed.

      One week ends, another begins. As can be expected, the week has been relatively uneventful other than working and school, but me and the girls (Marylynn, Angela) went out to Cinco De Mayo last night for salsa night (only to find it was 70's and 80's night). Nonetheless, it was good times, lots of dancing, a little drinking, and other fun and nonsense. Oh-and this guy there seriously WOULD NOT leave me along-I've been hit on before, but this guy seemed a little too infatuated/desperate/or whatever-it was actually quite annoying. Call me crazy, but yes, I fall for the guys who play VERY hard to get and sometimes act like a-holes. Afterwards, we crashed (literally) on the floor of my kitchen and spent about an hour laughing, talking, shrieking-whatever you call it, before we all decided to go to bed (Marylynn and Ang went on home). Today hasn't been too productive, I still need to write a paper and do some laundry. Oh, and go to Wal-Mart.   In other news, my newest beauty must-have is a foundation brush. I've never had a more perfect application of makeup until using this. My skin is flawless and glowing!   I'm finally going to visit Krissa, two weeks from now. Haven't seen her in almost a year (although we talk all the time), and it should be good times-catching up is always fun.  Anyway, it's time for me to be productive. More later skater.

      Sorry gang, it's been awhile.   Updates:  First, my AIM isn't working. Don't know what's up there, but strangely, I don't really miss it.   Second: CINCO DE MAYO and Salsa night rock my world. Those latino boys know how to shake it! hehehe-girls nights out rock and being single really is fun, now that I've just embraced it and stopped worrying about relationships.  Third: I have a lot of paper-writing to do before the end of the semester, but it should be pretty easy and I should easily get an A in my seminar.   Fourth: Last day of FB (full-time) is August 20th! YEAH!!!  Fifth: I'm going to be in Kentucky all weekend visiting KD-so if you need me, I won't be in Spfld! Call the cell.   Sixth: I have red and blonde streaks in my hair and red underneath, in addition to a new cut. It looks AMAZING and soooooooooo not typical Amy Lynnette. Be warned! But so far EVERYONE loves it, even strangers!  Seventh: I started back at Curves (all women exercise club, for all you manly men). It feels wonderful to be working out again!  That's all for my quick update. Much more later-it's been a fun couple of weeks but what can I say, I'M BUSY!

      I GOT MY NEW CAR!   It's a 2001 Chevy Impala, midnight blue, and it's absolutely gorgeous. Everyone I've showed it to has loved it. I'm soooooooooo excited about it, it feels wonderful to drive it!  Meanwhile, the DNC is over-and can I just say that I'm glad, not bc I really have anything against the democrats, they have a right to a convention as well, but I DO have something against the psycho left-wing celebritys crashing the convention and spreading their political views all over the media.&nbsp; I don't pay 6 dollars a movie because I enjoy hearing Hollywood's political views. I understand that they are citizens as well as us, but you don't see FOX or CNN letting many normal people just run their mouth, so I'm not so sure the same should apply for celebrities.&nbsp; It just gets annoying, that's all. I'm not President Bush's #1 fan, but he is our president and he does deserve a certain amount of respect.   Ok-I don't know much else-this week was spent working, picking up my car, working and presenting my final project for class, and going out last night (Stella and Catch 22). I have a bunch of papers to write before Tuesday.&nbsp; But right now I'm off to work. Gosh, I hate Famous Barr. But that's another story, for another day. Only 21 days till I'm FREEEEEEEEEE!!!  &nbsp;

       Hey everybody, hope you're all well.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Weekend in Kentucky: a nice time in general. It was great to see Krissa, we spent most of the time playing catch up. And hanging out with her friends, all of whom seem very cool and were very welcoming, but not to the point of being annoyingly nice-do you know what I mean? I hope you do. Anyhoo, I think her and Devin are just darling together, and epitomize what a healthy relationship should look like.&nbsp; I'm so glad Krissa has finally found a nice guy who treats her well-it's what any self-respecting girl should expect, after all. :o)     &nbsp;   The DNC started tonight. I don't really have anything to say about it, but there you go. Both candidates annoy me, but the conventions are fun to watch. I still&nbsp;don't know who I'm voting for. Probably Bush, but only because Kerry annoys the hell out of me. That, and I have a bet riding on it. However, if you ask me who I really like, I'll tell you: it's all about McCain.      &nbsp;  Finally, not much else new EXCEPT: I bought a car today! It's a 2001 Chevy Impala and it's gorgeous. It is EXACTLY what I was looking for and I got really lucky to find one used, yet in great condition. With that said, I'm really tired, so I'm gonna hit the sack. More later.
