                       1. The first rule is to question everything that the President does –even in a time or war.    It is our duty in a democracy and it is unpatriotic not to do so –especially in a time of war.    If the ‘other side’ says that we are aiding and abetting the enemy –we scream ‘foul’ and claim that they are contesting our constitutional guarantee of dissent.            2. The second rule is ALWAYS distrust the motives of the President –it’s a personal check and balance that keeps us safer.               3. We      must always criticize the economy –regardless of what the numbers      show.    It is unpatriotic to assume      that ‘  America        can’t be better’.    It would dishonor      those killed on 9/11 not to expect more of our leaders.          4. We must always remember the economic horn of plenty that Clinton provided-don’t let anyone imply this was a tech bubble; and reject the idea of the Clinton/Gore recession in 2000-2001 because they can not be blamed that a tech bubble burst.          5. You      can cover all political bases by voting for a war, but then criticizing it      later.    This is an important rule as you will always have two sides to stand on regardless of the crowd that you are addressing.    The hawks will      respect you for voting for it, and the doves will love you for protesting      against it.          6. If your constituents are mad that you voted for the war just vote against the funding of the war. To avoid people saying that you are hurting the troops, claim that the bill was worded wrong and that you didn’t want to give the President a ‘blank check’.         When all else fails continue to evoke the evils of the President.          7. Attempt      to discredit everyone in the current Administration even if some were      appointed by your political allies.         When they are correct –take credit.         If they mess up –cut them and run and blame the Administration for      keeping him too long.          8. Use      any minor infraction to discredit the opposition.    Try not to belittle the soldiers,      because the American people won’t like that but the Administration is fair      game.    If you discover people putting underwear on someone else’s head or treating a prisoner in any way less than would be expected at the Waldorf Astoria, report ‘wide-spread torture’ and keep using the word ‘atrocity’.    While you are at it –bring impeachment charges against the President just incase he wins a second term-start proceeding immediately.    Downplay      any horror committed by the opposition as retaliation for the war in      general.          9. Do not let them use Nick Berg / Paul Johnson as a diversion to any news here at home –dwelling on these deaths may remind the people what we are fighting for and there is a possibility they may rally behind the President.          10. Constantly remind your constituents of all the awful things that America has done –never let them de-humanize the enemy or label them as ‘terrorists’ because they will relate it to 9/11 and may rally behind this corrupt administration.    Remind them that we have done terrible things to African Americans and the Japanese and that we are not superior to anyone-reiterate cultural tolerance (Maybe even quote one of the 'nice' verses from the Koran).            11. Don’t      let   America        forget that we too have bombed things and killed innocent civilians and      that the opposition in the  Middle East  are just young freedom fighters who strongly believe in what they are fighting for …didn’t we kill the British when we felt that they were invading our land.            This is what I have learned in the past two weeks in my conversations with liberals on these blogs.    It is wrong for me to have a flag or a yellow ribbon because that is implying that Republicans own Patriotism and that those who don’t want to fly the flag somehow love the country less than I do.    I should be more worried about protecting a person’s right to borrow 'Tthe Anarchist Cookbook' from the library, and having it be kept private, than the security of my homeland –because that is the premise my homeland was built on.    I should never insinuate that we should feel funny if 5 Muslim men -in there 20s- all get on my plane reading the Koran... because that would be racial profiling and lots of Muslims love the West and if we go down that road they may all end up in interment camps.    The other side can accuse the president of every atrocity known to man, but I can question nothing about John Kerry because he served in   Vietnam  …     Does everyone know that…John Kerry was on a swift boat in   Vietnam  ?

                    Who  are  the delegates?  Why      was everyone at the convention so very unattractive?  Will      the GOP convention be as ugly?  Does      Vanessa Kerry have nostrils?  Why      did they mention that J. Kerry was 6’4” FIVE times?  Why      wasn’t P. Diddy clapping?  Why      does Alexandria Kerry have SO many teeth?  Why did      the “John Kerry movie” timeline go-Soldier>Dad>Prosecutor>Presidential      Nominee…wasn’t he a Senator for 20 years?  Were      the vets on the stage real or actors?  Why      doesn’t Max Cleland wear any prosthesis?  If 90%      of the delegates there were anti-war –why all the glorification of war?  If he      has 70 billion dollars, why hasn’t John Edwards had that mole removed?  If      they don’t want to “limit educational opportunities”, why vote against the      school voucher program?  Do you      get to pick your own secret service guys?  Why      does John Kerry always wear the same tie?  Why      hasn’t John Kerry been back for his follow-up Botox injections?  Why is      Gary Heart so damn grumpy?  Why is      the DNC suddenly claiming the GOP values of “Faith, Family, Country”?     Why does John Edwards keep having his      little kids up so late?  Does      the Bush-bashing resume today?

         Here is small tour through my head at any given time during the day…           ***  I watched as much of Edwards’ revised stump speech as I could handle last night…I hate that him and his mole keep saying that he is practicing the ‘politics of hope’ while in the next breath he talks about ‘Two Americas” (this is politico-speak for playing class warfare and the race card).    How divisive and coming from the richest ticket that has ever thrown their hats in the Presidential ring… (We will go into the whole hypocrisy of him even mentioning high health care costs at a later date)           ***  My husband has to have two knee replacements and I am a stay-at-home mom/student.    This is always on my mind…Last year, after taking the leap in 2002 to start his own business; he was stopped at a red light when an 18-wheeler plowed into him without ever touching the brakes.    Was the guy asleep, on drugs, over-worked by his union…who knows and quite frankly I don’t really care.    His carelessness has the potential to ruin everything we have worked so hard for…           ***  I want to see Kerry’s divorce records.    The Dems have adopted a republican platform at the “re-Invention Convention” this week and are not only evoking God (guess the ACLU doesn’t have delegates there), but are claiming ‘conservative values’.    Let’s See Them.    I want to see actions –not words…The Democrats had Jack Ryan’s sealed records opened on a hunting expedition-I want an eye for an eye.    I have seen reported numerous times that in the years after Kerry divorced his first Millionaire wife, and was running around with various B-Movie actresses, that he was a dead-beat dad.    I want to know if that is true!    They bitch that W may not have shown up here and there for NG duty (even though he was honorably discharged and they have no proof), but I think being a Dead-Beat dad is WAY worse of an offence.    The fact that he wife was suicidal because of their marriage seems bad enough- and that wasn’t sealed…What is he hiding?    The folks have the right to know –full disclosure!    I also want to see THK’s tax returns…           ***  As with Edwards’ role in the skyrocketing health care costs, Kerry’s   Vietnam   service is on my mind, but that will have to wait until I can devote the proper amount of time and research to it.           ***  We are supposed to be leaving for the beautiful Outer Banks of North Carolina on the 7 th …I have so much to do before then…           ***  I saw a great bumper sticker the other day:     “If Theresa doesn’t trust John Kerry with HER money, why should   America   trust him      with OURS”.           ***  I have to go food shopping and I have been putting it off all day –I used to love going and now I hate it, but I have no idea how the transition came about…

      Do you see what I mean about how people answer the poll question "Is the country going in the right direction?"  Uh, no..I'd say it's going in the left direction...                Oh God, I almost forgot...when Janeane Garofalo was on Sean Hannity today, she bestowed these peals of wisdom on the listening audience...I had to write them down ------  I report -you decide...(haha)    "The Soviet Union was collapsing and no threat"  "The Ronald Reagan myth needs to end"  "George Soros was instramental in ending the cold war"                  This ties in beautifully with earlier conversations:  http://www.drudgereport.com/dnc8.htm

      I know we all have been talking about the "14 Syrian Musicians" and this (link below) article makes it sound A LOT worse (if that's possible). I know it's kind of long, but worth the read!  -14 Syrians  -Air Marshall kicks down plane bathroom door to find a man removing the mirror -what was behind the mirror___THE COCKPIT  -Middle Eastern men rush the cockppit -then stop short ...trying to flush out Air marshalls...

                 The Good:                  Anne Coulter    was booted from her job of covering the “Democratic Re-Invention Convention” by     USA     today for…being Anne Coulter.    I wanted to post a paragraph from the article that got the papers panties in a twist –              Written by Anne Coulter    7/26/04   :         “… the corn-fed, no make-up, natural fiber, no-bra needing, sandal-wearing, hirsute, somewhat fragrant hippie chick pie wagons they call "women" at the Democratic National Convention…”  –Anne Coulter ( urlLink www.annecoulter.com )              Written by me    7/25/04   :         “ They all dress like they live at Goodwill and wear no makeup and even the cutest of them has uglied herself up beyond recognition with pointy little Lisa Lobe glasses…” ALa71 ( urlLink www.mobyrebuttal.com )                   Now can two ‘angry right-wing blondes’ be wrong?

         Mention amending the Constitution (to stipulate that marriage is between a man and a woman) and you will hear a collective gasp from the left.    My God!    Those evil Republicans do not respect this sacred piece of paper.    How could you amend the Constitution and take away State’s rights, this would be the worst thing since prohibition…     YET, it is these very same people that are STILL saying that Bush stole the 2000 election.    Beyond just saying, “Get over it”; we have to force these people to be intellectually honest.    It is a Constitutional directive that our President is elected based on the votes of an electoral college (the word ‘college’ is not actually used-for you sticklers out there)…This is something that was written into the Constitution by our founding fathers.         The purpose of a representative democracy is to protect smaller states and keep them politically viable.    If the election was purely a popular vote the candidates could focus solely on states like   Texas   and   California   and never look at the interests of smaller states like   Vermont   or   Maryland  .    A candidate needs 270 electoral votes to win the Presidency.    In 2000 Bush got 271 votes and Gore 266.    Three major news organizations (Time Magazine, CNN and The New York Times –all fair and balanced publications…) did extensive investigations into that election in the year that followed and they all came to the same conclusion…Bush won.    The only voters that were proven to be disenfranchised were the 790 servicemen whose absentee ballots Gore attempted to block (what a Patriot).         NEVER before in the history of Presidential politics has a candidate sued over the outcome of an election.    In 1960 when Nixon ran against JFK there was overwhelming evidence that election fraud had taken place (especially in  Southern Texas  and   Chicago  ).    Nixon was urged to contest the election (even by Ike), but declined.    He said, “A challenge would cause a Constitutional crisis, hurt   America   in the eyes of the world and tear the country apart”…so began the Nixon precedent.    In 2000 all of Nixon’s predictions came to fruition.    The country was –and still is- torn apart.    Bush is blamed for this, but it should be Gore.    He didn’t receive enough votes to be President.    If Gore would have followed Nixon’s lead our country would not be as bitterly divided as it is during a time that it is imperative we be united.     I am not bringing this up to argue and rehash election results or the mechanically -challenged people who can’t operate a hole punch in Florida (and if Bush and Gore were both punched on the same ticket- who is to say they were Gore’s votes –I’ve never gotten that). I am bringing this up to show the inconsistency of the left.    Almost four years later I still hear some referencing the ‘stolen’ election.    If you insist on calling this a stolen election -- you are obviously disregarding our Constitution –therefore you can have no problem with amending it to reflect the will of the majority of Americans…              Note to Pollsters and Wishful Thinkers:          I actually got selected to do a Zogby poll the other day and when asked the question “Do you think that the country is going in the right direction?” I said “No.”      I hear pollsters and DNC talking heads on the news touting the “wrong direction” poll results.    What the question doesn’t ask is “Why?”         Oh, why you ask?         Because of the division in this country (that we now know was caused by Al Gore), because activist judges are over-riding the votes of the people counted through referendums, and because the ACLU is slowly undermining all that was good in this country and turning us into a secular shell of what we once were.         So don’t get too excited when you read these polls, because I am sure that I am not the only one in the country that feels the ‘wrong direction’ has nothing to do with George W. Bush.

         I am really not into the whole black helicopter/conspiracy theory thing…HOWEVER--I do allow myself one indulgence –The Hillary Factor…         Now, let me preface this apocalyptic post by saying that I was never a ‘right wing   Clinton   basher’.    I thought that his abuse of power was disgusting, but I wasn’t driving around with a 12 foot effigy of him with flames coming out of his pants.    He wasn’t a hate inspiring President for me –kind of a non-President.    (“Consensus signals the absence of true leadership” Madeline Albright)     Hillary is another story.    She scares the hell out of me.    There is a small bit of respect mixed in with that fear (–in the interest of full disclosure).    Now, I have tried to think through the two available scenarios by which she will get herself elected as the first female President of the   United   States   in 2008 –because this is the grand plan…that I would bet on.    Only one scenario works for her…           Scenario 1: Bush Wins         The   Clintons   control the DNC right now.    This is unusual because, technically, it should be Al Gore as he was the last nominee.    The head of the DNC, Terry McAwful, is the   Clintons   hand-picked guy.    Dean said that he would fire McAwful should he attain the nomination.    Dean was promptly taken out of the race in a scream of agony.    Gen. Wesley Clark (whom I found quite handsome –in the interest of full disclosure) was also hand picked by the   Clintons   as the ‘anti-Dean’ –with full knowledge that he didn’t have a shot in hell.    It is no coincidence that it was Clark that leaked that the “Kerry intern problem will cause Kerry’s candidacy to implode” to 12 top media outlets, “off the record”, on the day that he bowed out of the race…This failed because the Kerry intern story was never pursued by the mainstream media.         Kerry’s poll numbers are quite close –if not even with Bush’s and this is a problem for Hillary.    If Kerry wins (god forbid) and has a 2-term Presidency (shudder) it will be 2012 –at that point Edwards is the likely nominee and if he gets 8 years (arggh) it puts us at 2020 –which makes Hillary 73 years old.         She  needs  Bush to win this election.    There are many Democrats that would be very hesitant to vote for a woman president (think teamsters-roofers-plumbers unions), BUT if Bush gets 4 more years the hate on the left will be at historical highs and they would vote for Forest Gump if he ran as a Democrat in ’08.    Add Trouser-Gate and my scenario is all but written in stone.    This info (the stealing of national archives) was NOT leaked by republicans…Karl Rove is WAY too intelligent for that (call him the devil, but he is smart as hell).    The White House had the 9/11 report before the public did and knew that there was nothing damning to the Administration in it.    If they were going to leak this they would have held on to it until the weekend before the election (just like the Gore campaign did with Bush’s DUI).    SO either the   Clintons  ’ leaked (likely) it or Kerry’s campaign leaked it (Kerry denies knowing about it), figuring better now than later and thinking they could use the convention to make people forget that Sandy Berger was a Kerry campaign foreign policy advisor.    The 9/11 report did enough damage to Burglar as it was (4 denied attempts to get Bin Laden) –so what  was  in those papers?    It’s going to be fascinating to watch what else is leaked “by the republican attack machine” (AKA Hillary) to hurt Kerry’s chances in the months ahead. (*for the record –Kerry & Terry McAwful DO NOT get along and Kerry has also made subtle comments about replacing him…bad move).            Scenario #2: Kerry wins           Is it worth Bush winning if it all but guarantees a Hillary presidency in ‘08?    Would we be better of with 4 years of Kerry?    Now some of you may say if Kerry screws up too bad Hillary can run against him for the nomination on ’08, BUT if it was a democrat in office that screwed up another democrat has a slim to none chance of getting elected –history shows this and Hillary knows it!     Do you see the dilemma?    Kerry now or Hillary later…Who would be the least destructive of the two?    Hillary may become a hawk to prove that she isn’t a weak woman.    If she is elected she will want a two-term Presidency, so she may shift to the center like ‘magical me’ did when he was President.         This is why Hillary didn’t leave Bill throughout all of his shenanigans.    This is the grand plan.    There is NO way she is going to let some insignificant senator from   Massachusetts   take it away from her…         A little something for everyone (on both sides of the isle) to contemplate as we go into the week of the Convention…and head into the election…should be fascinating!

         So I find myself turning 33 tomorrow and looking back at what makes me –me…       I received an email the other day from a fellow blogger (FarenHate 9/11 listed as a movie favorite) that basically stated (not this bluntly of course): How can a person that listens to Dave Matthews and Bob Marley be a  Conservative ?    How can you hear Bob belting out One Love and hate everyone that is not like you…just curious…have a great night…       I will be the first to admit that I label people-I do.    I make it a game in my head actually…when I am driving I watch people and create who I think they are: “Deaniac” to the scruffy bearded Birkenstock boy in his early 20’s, “Bar softball league” to the slightly beer-bellied, too-old-to-be-wearing-his-baseball-cap-backwards guy with the faded green Miller Lite t-shirt…you get the point.         I HATE to be labeled.    Hypocritical?    I don’t know…I meet many 20-somethings (as I have a sister and three brothers that are all 20-somethings) and they are SO predictable.    They are MTV, they spout pre-packaged opinions and find themselves enlightened because they French-kissed their best friend in 10 th  grade.    They all gave Dean $25 because that’s all they could afford working non-profit for the Philadelphia Clean Air Council.    They all think smoking is horrible and are vegetarians, but have all done Special K and Ecstasy.    They all dress like they live at Goodwill and wear no makeup and even the cutest of them has uglied herself up beyond recognition with pointy little Lisa Lobe glasses.           I try not to be condescending.    I really do, but for all their PETA literature and statistics about the number of people in  Africa  that have to sleep on dirt floors and not mattresses –what have they done?    They are so self-absorbed.    They remind me of that commercial where four girls are standing in a bathroom all looking at the water running and exclaiming how awful that is and what a waste of water and drag on the environment…as they stand there in horror another girl walks over and turns the water off.    I am that girl.    They are looking at the waste, wearing cute-slogan t-shirts about it, but I am turning it off.           I wrote an entire diatribe about compassionate conservatism and how I got to where I am…all the good things I do…and then I deleted it.     It’s easier than that…At 33 I am the girl who just turns off the water.       (*exception: one 20-something brother actually volunteers quite frequently*)

      LeftyJones has just informed me that my 'comments' section must be full (Under "Censorship" post) and won't allow for more submissions. I will post the 'debate' about the DNC schedule posting (see below) here and the discourse can resume:                  urlLink this we'll defend  said...          ...Yes I am left of center. If you promise not to believe everything that is said about liberals on Fox News I promise not to believe everything that is said about conservatives on AirAmerica. For instance, I believe in a progressive income tax system, for instance, and hate the Bush tax cuts. That doesn't mean I want to punish the rich for being rich or that I believe in income redistribution or communism (I am VERY capitalist because I think history has shown it to be a more effective system). Instead I believe that we are all better off when we invest in schools, infrastructure, enforcing the rule of law, ensuring poor children have a healthy diet, etc. Just like I believe tax dollars spent on defense can be good or bad depending on how they are spent - spend wisely and we are better off, spend poorly and it is a waste - such as national maginot line - I mean missile defense. And if you disagree with me - God bless America that you and I can do so and not want to imprison each other, or censor each other, or even hate each other. That is what scares me about how partisan and one-sided the nation has become. Next stop: one party state. I don't care which party it is - it is wrong and everybody that believes in democracy and our Republic should say STOP. That is why your "funny" DNC schedule of events really wasn't that funny. Flag-burning? Do you honestly believe that Democrats hate America when they oppose changing the 1st Amendment to prevent flag burning? Or do you think we really burn flags? Or that we want to appease terrorists? Why even suggest it? Don't give me the humor excuse. I'm not blaming you, it is acceptable these days. But that doesn't mean it is right......................So where did our informed, logical, honest argument about national policy go? And how can voters make intelligent decisions when this is the way we learn about the world around us? Don't buy into it. The democrats are not the enemy, but the loyal opposition. The republicans are not the enemy, but the loyal opposition. Anybody that thinks otherwise IS THE ENEMY.  (shortened -read entire post under"Censorship")                 urlLink ALa71  said...              TWD:           A progressive income tax system means that you do want to punish the rich --this doesn't effect the richest people (like Theresa H. Kerry who got their money through an inheritance) it effects the WORKING rich--that are already paying up to 60% of their income on taxes (meaning they are working more than half the year to pay taxes) The rich (1-5%) of this country carry 70% of the tax load --how is that fair and how is that not punishing the rich? Would you even bother to go to work if you were only going to be given 40 cents on each dollar?                   I think that just as you have said that history has proven that capitalism works --it has also proven that government programs don't. Did you know that up to 73 cents on EVERY welfare dollar goes to administration cost? What business would be allowed to run that way --what charity wouldn't be criticized and scrutinized were this the case? When I give to charities, the first thing I do is look up what actually goes to the charity (Freedom Alliance 100% =Women for Women International 96%) This is why I believe in small government and private contribution. I can pick where I want MY money to go and I can ensure that the charities stay honest in competition for my dollars.               As for education the Teachers Union (NEA) has gotten more money than any time in history =average dollars per student $9,354, more teachers (one staffer for every 8.2 students), higher pay for teachers (average $44,642 for 9 months) --and has education gotten better? Average reading scores: (on a scale of 1-500) 1971= 285.2 / 2001=287.8   Average Math: 1971 = 300.4  2001=308.2   Illiteracy rates 2000 (4th grade): 63% blacks, 58% Hispanics, 60% children in poverty                         That is why I believe in School vouchers -pro-choice!              Obviously I cringe at the thought of 'free health care'. Not only did I live in England for a year and experience socialized medicine first hand, but when I was young we had to go to the Police & Fire clinic (as all Police and Fire families did then -now they have Personal Choice) and sit in a jammed waiting room for HOURS waiting for them to call you into the 'big bird room'. You went with a stomach ache and ended up with every ailment known to man after spending HOURS in that germ-infested non-ventilated waiting room.              You said:'spend poorly and it is a waste"...as I think I have illustrated --the government always spends poorly. It is inherent and too systemic to fix.              As for the DNC schedule...yes (obviously) it is a joke...meant as a slight departure from the stress of the 9/11 report, the election, the war and life in general -BUT it is also a satire of the direction that the Democratic Party is heading.               Do I think that the far left hates American and really burns flags, you ask? Absolutely! If you don't please visit www.protestwarrior.com and watch 'operation wolverine'. I am TERRIFIED of the far left. What's in the video: burning American flags with Palestinian and Communist flags flying high, people dressed as homicide bombers, blood stained Israeli flags...SCARY. I hope you watch the video. It's not 10 or 50 people -thousands. Groups like ANSWER/ NARAL / NOW (all lobbyists and contributors to the Democratic Party). So do I think you (no I am sure not you) burn flags...YES. Or that you (once again, I would bet my life not you) want to appease terrorists...YES. So I am not giving you the humor excuse, I am giving you the "I have seen it with my own eyes and I hope you will too" excuse. This is why I said that you must be a Democrat and not a 'left liberal' (big difference). If you have not seen these 'protest' and heard all the anti-American statements made abroad by the likes of Michael Moore and others in the far left --you should before you align yourself with them. As I do not put myself in the same category as the rev. Jerry Falwell and others of that ilk.               So I say don't go to the media. Watch real life. Watch the video, watch the politicians, check the statistics and then decide. I don't hate anyone (well maybe Michael Moore -but I believe in free speech -not libel and slander). I think that most of us have the same goals -just very different methods of achieving them.               The informed, logical, honest argument about national policy is right here -right now...that is in fact why most of us are here right? http://www.protestwarrior.com/videos/operation_wolverines.php

         I used to be an avid Howard Stern listener.    I listened from the first day that he came on in Philly—I was 15.    For weeks before his climactic debut, the station kept running this promo of Stern repeating, “He’s a Dick, He’s a Dick” (referring to the local ‘Morning Zoo’ guy who was #1 back then …you know the type –Hawaiian shirt Fridays and Wacky Wednesdays).    Anyway, what could be cooler at 15 than someone saying ‘dick’ on the radio –it was unheard of then.    I was hooked.    Years ago he did this great bit about turrets before people believed it was a real ailment –he called the principal of a school with the perspective turrets inflicted ‘student’ on the extension.    It was SO funny, the kid kept saying all these crazy sexual things and cursing and the Principal was trying to be PC but had no idea what to think.         I don’t listen to Howard anymore.    It isn’t because of his daily bash-Bush tirades.    I stopped listening after his wife left him.    He wasn’t real anymore and he became another rich, ugly guy with a hot young blonde that wouldn’t have given him the time of day were he not ‘Howard’.    I understand why Howard is lashing out about being censored, but I am angry that he is misdirecting that anger.    I am even angrier that people are listening to him—he is swaying votes based on false information!    Howard ‘the hawk’ had Michael Moore on the other day and kissed his ass!         We should all be outraged at censorship.    Be outraged even if you despise Howard, because it may not stop with him.        I hear many conservative Christians saying “Good, take him off, he’s a pig”.    What about someone that thinks Rush, Sean or Savage is a pig?    TURN THE DIAL PEOPLE.    I have been glad to hear Rush, Sean and Glen Beck all defend him…but I have yet to hear that Howard has defended Rush.    A defense appropriations bill was recently sent to the Senate where Tom Harkin(D) added a stipulation that Rush be removed from Military radio.    That is scary…a senator using a defense bill to censor a political personality.         With a bit of digging Howard would see that the person leading the ‘indecency’ witch-hunt over at the FCC (did you know that the commissioners regulating what  you  see and hear are NOT  elected  officials) is not Michael Powell, but Michael Copps (D).    This should NOT be a partisan issue.    Just like our soldiers fight to keep the freedoms that allow people to say things that they may not agree with –we need to fight for the same things here at home.

           Have you all seen the article “Terror in the Skies…Again”?    If you haven’t- you should, here’s the link (long but worth the read)  urlLink http://womenswallstreet.com/WWS/article_landing.aspx?titleid=1&amp;articleid=711   I think that I will never fly again.    I have bungee-jumped, rock-repelled, went white water rafting…but I don’t think I will be on a plane in the foreseeable future.    Call me immature or paranoid—I don’t care.    I had a very similar experience to the one in the article in 1996 on a plane from   London   to Philly.    I was crying and paralyzed with fear (and that was pre-9/11).    Looking back I wonder if I should have notified authorities.    Michelle Malkin has been investigating this story.    She is linked on my site.              I heard today that news organizations ‘calling’ the election in 2000 before other states had voted cost Bush 1,400 votes on the western side of   Florida   alone.    Someone called Hannity today to encourage people to go vote regardless of what the news is saying the day of the election…do people really need to be told that?              The mayor in   Philadelphia   is the worst ever in the history of the   United   States of America  …ok, ok after Marion Barry he is the worst ever.    I heard on CNN that Philly is one of the last cities in the country that still votes purely based on race.    The GOP dropped the ball and ran a white dude against this incumbent who ALWAYS plays the race card…”Don’t let  them  take  us  out of power”.    He defaulted on his student loans, didn’t pay taxes, had his gas and electric turned off and is running the 5 th  largest city in the country.    NOW he wants to add money ($20-$30) to everyone’s gas and electric bills to cover the people that don’t pay! (Aside from trying to close  8  firestations). Are you kidding me?    If you were the other person out there that watched the short-lived HBO K Street then you saw James Carville shamelessly using the show to campaign for him…            Moby hasn’t posted in days…he must know I am watching his every move…            I think 91Ghost IS Michael Savage….            It’s really starting to piss me off that every guy I know is making excuses for Scott Peterson…            I wish Jack Ryan hadn’t pulled out of the race in   Illinois  .    He is a better-looking (and Republican) John-John and he could have gone far in the GOP. He is pro-life, pro-tax cuts, pro-Israel, pro-tough on crime and going after terrorists.       If the ‘public sex’ story is true, I am OK with that.    After   Clinton   I find it quite refreshing to see a man dig his own wife that much.    I say he should embrace it and campaign on it.    What a change that would be….I want to have sex with my  own  wife…how uplifting.

      I just got back from driving around running errands in my big, evil, gas-guzzling SUV  (I saw someone with a bumper sticker that said "Ted Kennedy's car has killed more people than my gun" --that rules).  Don't worry 91Ghost--it is a Grand Cherokee NOT a Hummer (and it actually gets pretty decent gas mileage...)  Anyway, my point.  I was listening to Sean Hannity  and he had a caller that raised a really great point (ironically he was from Philly-actually that's not ironic at all --sorry Alanis Morrisette overtook me for a second) Oh yeah, my point.  Ok the caller was referencing the fact that John FORBES Kerry has been in the Senate now for 20 years and has never sponsored and had a bill passed.  He went on to say that Kerry claims that he will 'change world opinion', but considering  he couldn't even change his colleague's opinions  that seems unlikely.  I HONESTLY would like to hear a democrat/liberal/independent's  answer to what signs of leadership skills this man can possess if  in 20 years he couldn't get one thing passed.  It seems that there is one of two explanations:   1) He has no diplomacy or persuasion skills.    2) He has really bad ideas that even his liberal friends won't sponsor/pass.  Now, you are not allowed to answer a question with a question and say --'what did Bush do before he was President'...He is President already and we do not deal in hypotheticals here (unless they are mine).  Bush has had many bills passed (and supposedly with false info so he must be pretty good).  I would love some honest thoughts because I really don't get it....

          Over the past six or seven months there has been an all-star lineup of liberals coming out against the Bush Administration --and then, conveniently adding their names to the growing section of Bush-bashing books on the front table at Barnes and Noble.             Each person has been the star-of-the-moment, splashed all over the news for days and touted for their service and truthfulness—YET when something has happened to expose them as liars or to discredit them- they just disappear from the radar screen. Poof. (A little like that pesky Oil For Food scandal!!!)         Sandy Berger (burglar?), the former Clinton NSA, is now under investigation for shoving classified documents in his UNDERPANTS and socks (allegedly   J   ).    He has now resigned as Kerry’s aid (Did the     Clinton    ’s leak it? Oh, that’s for another day).    What was in the documents?    Was it information about the three offers that     Clinton     had from the     Sudan     to ‘take Bin Laden’?    Was it info to help Kerry’s campaign?    I seem to remember that after he testified everyone sang his praises---but let’s not gloat because I am sure that this is all a vast right wing conspiracy to take attention from the 9/11 commission report.         What would they say if this had been Condeleeza?         ‘Terrorism Czar’ DICK Clark was the star of the moment –every show on every channel.    Michael Moore lauded him, Moby praised him…all the libs evoked his name to justify their crazy liberal theories of how ‘Bush told all the Jewish people to leave the Twin Towers and then let the planes fly into them’ and other truly intellectual ideas like that.    Richard Clark was exposed by a Fox news interview done the year before where he had stated that 1) there was no plan for Al Qaeda passed from the     Clinton     to the Bush Administration and 2) the Bush Admin. increased CIA capabilities and the plan to go after Al Qaeda by FIVE FOLD.    ALSO, as I have been told, a chunk of Michael Moore’s schlockumentary is based on the ‘fact’ that members of the Bin Laden family were allowed to fly right after 9/11 when there wasn’t a plane in the sky and it was all personally sanctioned by Bush.    WRONG! It was after the planes were back in the air and who gave the clearance for all of them?    Michael Moore’s hero –DICK Clark.                ‘Ambassador’ Joe Wilson, another of the 60 minutes book deal club, claimed that he was sent to    Africa    with no help or recommendation from his CIA wife (LIE), and that he found and reported that there was no proof that Saddam was seeking to buy Uranium.    He says that he gave this info to the Bush Admin., and that they blatantly ignored it.    The 9/11 commission says that     Wilson    ’s report BOLSTERED the case that     Iraq     was indeed looking to buy uranium.    Did Saddam want radio active smoke alarms, because that is the only use for uranium that I can find… besides, of course, the proliferation of NUCLEAR WEAPONS.         In their rush to smear the President, democrats have clung to any figure with a grim tale to tell before fully vetting their stories.    They hailed Michael Moore then bowed their heads as Christopher Hitchens tore him to shreds.    They have disenfranchised the true Democrats (Miller, Lieberman, Evan Byah –they even lost Dennis Miller) to embrace the leftist fringe of the party.    If the Republicans had person after person making slanderous claims and consistently being proved liars it would be on the front page of the New York Times for at least 97 days –just like the Abu Ghraib ‘torture’ photos.          I don’t know if I can take 3 ½ more months of this…

      It seems strange to me that in the hot pre-election days, that al qaeda has gleefully promised to be the 'summer of blood'; the debate has turned to 'values'. As Islamic extremists continue to practice their sacred act of beheading our candidates are arguing values.   This begs the question, "What are values?"  Are they what  you  value and what will drive your leadership or are they a core stem of morality within your person? Bush claims the values of the conservative platform: faith, family, country. Kerry said to the NAACP (after throwing up the black power sign -sorry that is funny no matter how many times I think about it) that he thinks values have nothing to do with morality or belief, but instead jobs and fighting aids. He said that AIDS is the biggest problem facing our country. Hmmm...funny, i thought it was preventing a dirty bomb.   As I thought about who should get to define values, I remembered Kerry saying that Whoopi Goldberg's anti-Bush rant at Radio City Music Hall (bottle in hand -expletives flying) represented the values of Americans. Does Whoopi Goldberg represent us? Now, don't get me wrong...I am a 100% advocate of free speech. If Whoopi wants to make comparisons of Bush's last name to parts of the female body --it might be tired and obvious for a professional comedian and I would think she could be a bit more original, but never-the-less it is her right. That night (at a Kerry/Breck Boy fundraiser) the President was called a poo-tang, a liar, a killer and a thief. ..in a time of war. wow.   Now I wanted to compare this with an event that took place that very same night about an hour away that has gotten little or no coverage from the very balanced main steam media. Sean Hannity &amp; Ollie North's "Freedom Concert" at Six Flags in Jackson, NJ. It was a concert to raise money for the children of all the soldiers that have been killed or injured in Iraq or Afghanistan (raised over 2 million) -the Kerry/Breck concert raised 7.5 for...Kerry/Breck. At Six Flags there were flags everywhere (American flags! -thank God the ACLU wasn't notified!), soldiers brought up from Walter Reed Medical Center (GREAT guys!), Bush/Cheney shirts, signs and stickers, smiles, cheers, chants of USA. In front of 12,000 people Darryl Worley sang, Martina McBride, Ted Nugent, and Danny Aiello (believe it or not a pro-Bush celebrity). There were NO bad things said about Kerry -actually he wasn't even a thought. It was Pro-troops, Pro-America, Pro-Bush, Pro Pro pro.... I know, I was there.   Quite a contrast to Anti-war, Anti-Bush, Anti-Cheney, Anti-haliburton, anti anti anti...   This was a nice snapshot (to me anyway) of values. To me it is summed up in the difference between the "Bush/Cheney '04" and "Anybody But Bush" bumper stickers. I am FOR something. I KNOW what I believe. I believe that GWB is the person that best represents my values. He has moral conviction and doesn't cave to poll numbers. He doesn't tell Jewish groups that the wall around Israel is a necessity one day and the Palestinians that the wall is a crime the next. He doesn't say that he owns five SUVs in Detroit and on Earth Day claim that he has none. Some may say that it is Bush's moral clarity that scares them, because they don't have the same beliefs as him and they know that he will not change --they call it closed minded. I say if you believe in something and don't stay with it you didn't really believe. If John Kerry is elected we have no idea what we will get because he hasn't said --and that my friends, in the summer of blood and the ancient sacred practice of beheadings --scares the shit out of me!

      Here is a quote from Moby the other day:  "the bi-partisan senate 9-11 commission has concluded beyond a shadow of a doubt that there were no wmd's in iraq and that there was no connection between iraq and al-qaeda and there was no reason for bush to have waged war against iraq."  Members of the 'bi-partisan' 9/11 commission went on various news shows to rebut how the media had handled this report. They said that the report in NO WAY said that there were no connections between Iraq and Al Qaeda --in fact the report sited that they found  numerous  connections.  What the site couldn't find was 'operational collaboration' for 9/11.  Quite a different thing there Moby.    Curiously there has been no report from Moby about the Oil for Food Scandal at his precious United Nations. There has been not a peep about the fact that they have now proved that Ambassador Joe Wilson was a LIAR --and that his reports actually bolstered findings that Iraq was indeed looking to buy Uranium from Africa. Where are the apologies for the accusations against Bush for his State of the Union that stated this --and was true!  I will agree that the post-war situation in Iraq may not have been fully planned through, BUT I truly believe that the reason for this was that The President (&amp; his Admin) 100% believed that they would find the WMD's and then all the other countries would have to bow their heads in shame and come and help us out. This was not the case, but I think that it shows that Bush is not a liar --he honestly thought they would be there. We can argue about what happened to them. I find it a bit hard to believe that the ENTIRE world and two Administrations got the intelligence wrong. Everyone moans about the 'rush to war', but I think 17 resolutions at the UN and a year of build-up after the final resolution were plenty of time for a trip over the Syrian border.

      I spent a year abroad when I was in college. I went a lot of places and everyone was really nice. I am an American and LOOK like an American (I am from Philly so I definitely SOUND like an American). BUT__the Brits were nice, the Irish were the best, the Dutch were great (and mellow), the Greeks were friendly, the Spanish wonderful and low and behold even the French were really nice to me. The only people that I met in all my travels that were consistently horrible were the Canadians. I don't say this to be mean --it's just true. They all wore giant Canadian flags on their backpacks, so --god forbid-- someone didn't mistake them for being from the States. They told bad jokes referencing our inability to speak more than one language, and generally bristled whenever a lower-48 was around. Why? I can't answer that because to this day I don't know. It can't be as simple as "we took all their hockey players and now their teams suck" (one explanation that I have been given).   NOW, they are continuing to harbor two AWOL US soldiers --continuing the proud tradition of slapping the US in the face that started during Vietnam.   I hate when Canadian bloggers have US politics pages. I just read one and I had to fight the urge to post a comment and risking giving the person an ounce of legitimacy.   Canada: Extradite our soldiers and allow Fox News on your airways...what are you afraid of?

      There will be a Protest warrior Counter-protest in NY for the GOP  convention.  I am not sure how many of the PWs will show because  they will be in for a rough ride.  Spitting, screaming, ripping  signs, tripping, punching....ironically all from the 'peace'  people.  All the Anti-War groups will be out strong and a few  brave souls will counter their hate with signs like "Beside Ending  Slavery, Fascism, Communism, and Nazism ...War has never solved  anything." The Doves are never very dovish when the PWs show up and all  free speech rights seem to fly right out the window when it's a  conservative mouth moving.  Anyway, my fantasy is that all the PWs  that show up have lunch at Moby's Meatless cafe.  I would love to  see his face as the Bush supporters flooded his establishment.   Would he spit in their faux burgers?  Would he smile politely as  the sun beamed off his head?  Would he turn down the filthy  dollars of capitalism?  Oh well, a girl can dream...

      Here's the thing...this election is about one thing and one thing  only--National Security, regardless of what your social, religious or  even political views are. You can't marry your gay lover, have an  abortion, listen to Howard Stern or fight for union overtime if you are  dead. That's just a fact.    I just heard a speech Kerry gave today where he joined the chorus and  blamed the President for the pre-9/11 intelligence failure.  This  statement from a man who served EIGHT years on the Senate Intelligence  Committee and consistently voted to cut defense and intelligence  budgets. At one point he even proposed a bill with such sweeping  intelligence cuts that  not even his liberal mentor, Teddy Kennedy, would put his name on it.         Kerry recently spoke to the NAACP and said (before throwing up the  'black power' sign) that [a man with words and no deeds is dead].   Hmmm...So he voted to cut intelligence, but now blames Bush. He claims  that he believes that "Life begins at conception", yet he would never  let that influence his votes or policy making. Is that not a man with  words and no deeds?    "I voted for the 87 billion before I voted against it." John Forbes Kerry

            I read  Moby's on line journal every day. I don't know why I do because it  usually makes my head feel like it will explode. I hate that famous  people have a 'voice' and a forum and I don't. I am not even sure if  Moby is even relevant anymore. Does the MTV generation still dig him? I  guess I am considered a GenXer and I know no one that like/listens to  him. My fear: that the MTV generation does like him, reads his journal,  doesn't have the where-with-all to independently research the things  that he writes and actually believes the half truths that he espouses.      For instance...the other day he went on and on about  how President Bush was actually from     Connecticut    .  Bush 41 and Barbara Bush moved to     Odessa   ,    Texas     when Dubya was an infant. They then moved to Midland, Texas when he was  three and bought a house with the help of an FHA loan (how rich could  they have been if they needed FHA?).        Moby's blog claims that he bought his ranch in     Texas    on "the advice of Karl Rove" --which may    be true. "Hey George, I know someone selling a great  place in Crawford...” Moby, of course, makes it sound sinister. Like  Bush was the     Massachusetts     liberal that Kerry is and was like "get me a  place in     Texas    , so I can fool people into thinking I am a cowboy".   He lived in     Texas      his entire life! This is one small example of how disingenuous this  Moby guy is. (But what can you really expect from a self-proclaimed  pinko).

         In the personal interest of beating a fellow blogger to the punch....  In this heated political season where tensions are running high, I thought it would be good to demonstrate a bit a of bi-partisanship --   Leftyjones takes ALa71 to the Prom in 1988...   (Can we get a collective -'Thank God the '80's are over!--whose hair is bigger his or mine?)  -Lefty is now happily married to a fellow lib -and I am happily married to a fellow sane person (aka: Conservative) --so all ended well!

         In July I met a wonderful soldier who is currently recovering from wounds he sustained in   Afghanistan   at   Walter   Reed    Medical   Center   in   Washington ,  DC  .    I have been in such awe at how positive he is and how committed to the cause he seems.    The picture above is of him and other recovering soldiers who were injured in both   Iraq   and   Afghanistan   (with Sean Hannity & Col. Ollie North).    I wanted to share with you a letter that he wrote me recently –I wanted you all to see his spirit and dedication first hand.    We have CB ( urlLink http://cbftw.blogspot.com/  ) to share ‘in theater’ news, but we don’t often get to hear from the boys that have come home seriously wounded.                 A*****,     We are all doing great.  There are new soldiers coming in almost every day.  It’s just a matter of how many now.  I am probably going to start working here at the hospital while I am recovering.  I am so tired of sitting around doing nothing.  Some of the soldiers are perfectly fine with it.  I guess the boredom hasn't hit them like it has hit me.       They were talking about sending me back to   Nashville   to finish my therapy.  I complained about it and won the battle for now.  It just didn't make any sense whatsoever to send me home and then re-deploy me in a couple more months.  I mean...Geez.  As for the soldiers wanting out, send them home so they can get home health care.  We have quite a few retirees sitting here waiting to be released but have got to get an "ok" from medical.  It's such a long process.  It could be a lot easier if the people of the govt. didn't make it so hard.     I haven't seen A***** ( his daughter ) since right before we met.  I have talked with her.  Of course, she is ready for both of us to move back to TN and get ours lives back on course.  I look forward to those days too.  We have another job at hand and this is something I have to do first.  She hates it, but understands it.  She won't be too happy when I go back to the theatre ( they tried to talk him out of it, but he insisted on being re-deployed ).  I do so miss her.  I struggle with the complexities of life that I have put her in by being a soldier.  This makes me wish I would have gotten out so many times before.  In turn, I am an American, a father, a son, a brother, a friend, and I am free.  I am going to stand my ground and support the cause so those that follow me or are like me can live free, without feeling threatened by terrorists in the   USA  .    The USO, the US Govt., and many volunteers and other organizations set up these events ( Explaining all the pictures he sent me with celebrities like Reba and R. Lee Ermy ).  The concerts are usually mutual between the artist and the USO.  They want the soldiers there so they can show their support and the soldiers want to go.  The biggest kicker is that it is almost always completely free to the soldier.  The trips are always free, but if someone wants a memento, that is usually out of pocket.  This isn't saying that we are never given anything.  OMG, people are always giving and giving.   It truly makes a person proud to be a soldier.       The biggest drawback is that after all this daily attention is gone and they have completed their recovery and go home...the high amounts of praise and attention will diminish.  I only hope that our soldiers are strong enough to maintain those high spirits at home and continually work to regain being a positive member of society.  I pray that they become better people after their accidents than they were before.       There is no other country in the world greater than ours.  I am and forever will be proud to call myself an American.       Strength and Honor,     S***          If anybody wants to comment to him I will make sure that he reads this! Thanks S***!

                           I decided to remove this post as I am feeling a bit raw lately...Drained, Tired, Disillusioned... Someone called to tell me that this was not a good picture of me --said I look like Melanie Griffith in it. I think Mason was peeing on me as the photographer snapped the picture -which could explain a lot. It's virtually impossible to have me in a picture anymore. I took a bunch of photography classes and ever since then I am always behind the camera...I miss the darkroom -it is one of my dreams to build one in the house. For those of you who have never been -it is a wonderful stress reliever... In the meantime maybe I should buy some Calgon?!          Looking for a little Sunday night fun...go to   urlLink http://www.fundrace.org  and type in your address...you can see if any of your neighbors donated any money to Bush, Kerry, the RNC or the DNC....you can also type in specific names to see if and what people gave.

         I have breast implants.    This was not really information that I envisioned myself discussing in this forum –though I am quite open about it in my ‘real life’.    I only release this for discussion at this point because I hope that it will educate people to think before they speak –or judge…          It was 1992 and a typical Thursday night of good friends, junk food and 90210.    In this particular episode Brenda, Kelly and Donna were all having a ‘sleep over’ and were reading material about self breast exams (because that’s what us girls do at sleep-overs…not!).    They all began to examine their breasts (which I am sure was more for the pleasure of the adolescent boy viewers than the education of the female viewers).    My friends and I followed suit –mocking the silliness of the unrealistic scenario.    As I jokingly ran my hand under my right breast I found a sizable lump.    As each of my friends verified its existence the laughing faded away...          Thee short days later I was being wheeled into an Operating Room of a   Philadelphia   hospital, at the tender age of 21, with the possibility of cancer tangible in the air.    It was supposed to be a quick surgery –two hours at the most, so when I woke up almost seven hours later I began to worry.    They eventually shipped me off and told me the doctor would call…oh yeah, and the biopsy would take TWO WEEKS!              I endured the two weeks and was finally called to go into his office --to have the bandages and sutures removed and to hear the verdict.     Benign.    BENIGN!           As the bandages began to come off,  I thought I would die on the spot…my breast was virtually non-existent....gone!          “Yes, well we had to take much of the breast tissue as the growth must be encapsulated.”     Oh.          Fast forward nine years and two kids later…          In 2002 I finally decided to have reconstructive surgery.    I had looked into it many times before, but all the pictures I saw showed women with bigger breasts that were still lopsided –I didn’t care about bigger, I wanted even.    I also wanted to make sure that I would be able to breast-feed when I eventually had children (which I did for 16 months each).          A breakthrough from Monitor saved my life (well, maybe not my life but definitely my self image) New implants complete with valves that remain out of your body after the surgery.    When the swelling goes down, they stay in as long as adjustments are necessary to provide the best chance at symmetrical breasts.     I was so torn over whether to go through with it.    I had two small children and I kept envisioning my funeral if I died under anesthesia:     “I can’t believe she was so vain.”     “I know and with those precious boys left with no mother so she could have boobs.”           My husband intervened and said that it was ridiculous that I was only 30 years old and so miserable and insecure about my body.     “You should not want to cry every time that you look in the mirror!” (I'm sure it didn’t hurt that he has always been an implant man).         Anyway, I went to a great surgeon –not a stripper 'Sal Calabro' doctor that makes each breast identical to a submarine torpedo.    I don't mind mirrors anymore --and it was wonderful to throw away the padded bras that hid my secret for so long.       Lately I have been hearing a lot of talk (mostly on the right –but also from feminist groups) about the evils of plastic surgery and what a terrible indictment it is on our society.    I hear people’s conversations about the vanity that must be involved with anyone that could do this to their body (I actually laugh to myself when this happens in front of me- like today with two checkers at the grocery store which inspired this post).    I have heard church leaders denounce it and talk show hosts disdain it…     We are all taught that we shouldn’t judge people on their looks or their clothes, job or wealth… but plastic surgery –especially breast implants is fair game –judge away!    This procedure has been a God-send to many cancer patients and has helped to restore their self-confidence and their femininity.    So the moral of this story is the next time you want to talk about the vain girl that paid $7,500 for big boobs –stop yourself and think about the reasons that she may have done it.

         Wow!    I haven’t EVER seen a press conference like that!    New Jersey Governor Jim McGreedy emerges –docile, smiling, Stepford wife in tow- rambles on about how he has tried to “fit into the mold of a traditional life” and my mind was racing…what’s he gonna say?    Hookers?    Strippers? Call girls? Under-age Girls?    I lean towards the TV in anticipation –his nervous preamble alerting me to the fact that the disclosure was going to be big!        “I am a gay American” (as opposed to a gay Frenchman or a gay Australian I suppose)        Once again, Wow!    That I didn’t expect ---in a million years!    I know that I shouldn’t be reveling in someone else’s pain –and I’m not really, it’s just that it’s SO juicy and I know there is a giant scandal behind it that has yet to unravel (and yes, I will be the first to admit that I love a good political scandal).    I mean why resign for ‘coming out’ and admitting that you were having a consensual affair with another dude?    I will get to why this story is relevant to the rest of the country in a minute…      Anyway, it has been reported that Magical Me himself (Clinton) flew into NJ to talk to McGreedy last night…why?    To tell him to resign –to tell him not to resign? I want to know!    It has also been reported that there will be a law suit filed by a man that worked in the Governor’s office charging him with sexual harassment.    The man was made head of McGreedy’s security team after 9/11-- with NO previous security experience…hmmm….     Before you go thinking it was brave and honorable of him to disclose this information –the man that he was having the affair with (also a government official) –was basically blackmailing him…asking for a large amount of money to make it go away.    He had no choice. For those of you who may not know –there has also been a big financial scandal brewing –having to do with his campaign finances.    This man is also driving businesses from NJ by the truckloads with the Liberal method of tax the hell out of the ‘rich’.    This resignation shouldn’t/doesn’t have to do with the fact that he is gay –just a seemingly corrupt person (but that didn’t stop   John Street   or Marian Barry from multiple wins).     Anyway, here’s how this is relevant to you in other states.    There is a NJ state law that says if a resignation is 60 days before a general election the people of NJ get to vote on the new Governor, BUT if it is after that the Lt. Gov. takes the position. Today is 82 days until the election, but McGreedy said that his resignation would be effective as of November 15 th …how convenient!    Is it all starting to come clear –  Clinton  ’s visit…     The person that would most likely be elected is a Republican (not the Democrat Lt. Gov.) –which means higher GOP turn out on election day –which means NJ is back in play as a swing state and Bush gets a real shot at winning it.         How shady is it to say ‘I resign’ –but not until 13 days after the election.    I am quite sure that as the plot thickens and the real story unfolds, there will be lawsuits filed regarding the timing of the resignation (as there should be).    Most people that I know from  Jersey  (Republicans &amp; Democrats) had a low opinion of their Governor anyway and would welcome this chance to vote in someone else.    So, thanks to McGreedy and his pesky little secrets…Bush may just have a shot at the 15 electoral votes from   New   Jersey   after all!    Those of you in NJ have 22 days to demand your right to an elected –not appointed- governor!    Get going!    ******************************************************    On a completely seperate subject I would like to take a moment to say Happy Birthday to BigandMean! In breathy, wispy Marilyn Monroe Voice: "Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you....Happy Birth day Mr. Big and Mean....Happy Birthday to you!"

         I have been feeling angry lately. I try not to, don't want to and it's just not 'me' to feel this way. I am drained and a big part of me just wants this election to be over. I don't really want to talk to my liberal friends until after November 2nd...Maybe they feel the same way. My husband is worse --he has now arrived at the conclusion that any vote for Kerry is a vote to kill his kids (wow-I've created a monster!) . It's not just politics --my husband owns a business and this too has diminished my opinion of the human race as well. I can not believe how many people screw you. The worst thing is that 'friends' are the worst offenders. How do you have work done and just not pay for it? I am baffled. I was really supportive in this whole 'I want to work for myself and leave my job with a pension and benefits when we have two kids and you are a stay-at-home mom' thing. SO supportive...who am I to stand in the way of someone's dream for monetary reasons? I was under the false impression that it would be fine because when you do work for someone they pay you --WRONG! So very very wrong... This is frustrating for me because I was always the 'happy one' -the joking one and I don't want to be the angry one. I want to be able to agree to disagree --but when you TRULY believe in your ideals how do you do that? If the Dems had nominated Joe Lieberman I would feel a bit better --he is socially very liberal but consistently strong on defense. I would feel more secure with him running...As far as saftey goes -we would be OK either way. A new fear presented itself today amidst the swiftboat vets accusations...I have heard numerous military personnel calling various radio shows saying that they will not re-enlist should Kerry be elected (and people thinking of joining that are waiting until after the election to do so). This is attributed to 2 things -their feeling that he betrayed the military with his Jane Fonda/Vietnam Vets Against the War alliance and the rustling among the enlisted about the sweeping cuts that were sustained during the Clinton administration. I do not know about the second point as I was not in the military then -nor am I now. If re-ups and new enlisting drops in the midst of the 'War on Fundamentalist Islam' will the draft have to be re-instated? I have read a few anti-war sites lately that strongly advocate a draft(?). They claim that it will even out the fact that it is 'only poor uneducated people in the military'. So this is where I am at tonight...mad at dead-beats with no regard for other people and mad at the prospect of a weak-on-defense President. I want to be happy again ---it would be a great help if everyone could just pay their bills and re-elect Bush in the fall. Thank you.

      I love the drive to North Carolina. It is almost a tangible feeling when the 'south begins', and it happens closer than most Notherners would think. I can almost pinpoint it to somewhere around Smyrna, Delaware. Beyond Smyrna the business signs are mostly hand-painted. "Jackie's Hair Hut" (complete with silver stars that dot the i's) "Melvin's Pool Room" "Salisbury Beauty Supply" The types of restaurants change from "Fridays" to "Fomy's Barbecue Pit" The businesses even change as John Deere stores and Harley shops begin to line the road. The thing that stands out the most for me is the unabashed declarations of faith: "Redemption Auto Repair" "Christ's Cleaners" "Christian Diner" Actual Billboards that proclaim: "Jesus is the Way, the Truth, and the Light" "One Nation Under God" "Trust in God Alone" These are not urban images...God does not live openly in Philadelphia... Another image that is plain for all to see, but that is virtually non-existent in Philadelphia is the amount of Bush/Cheney, W '04 and various other pro-Bush signs and stickers ...so strange -refreshing, but strange... Nature takes on new meaning as stretches of land grow larger -and greener. Corn fields pepper the large expanses -all equipped with giant sprinkler systems... I love watching this transformation.  I have been making this journey for over 15 years and it never ceases to amaze me. Traveling down Route 13S, you almost have to believe John Edwards' proclamation about the reality of two Americas. In Virginia there seems to be only two living situations. Sprawling plantation-style homes on rolling acres complete with wrap-around porches and silos --or --small mobile/modular homes that are barley larger than the sheds that many in Philly have in their back yards to store lawn mowers. (Though in defense of the 'plantation' owners --we looked at a house while we were in NC that was on ELEVEN acres and was going for $199,000...so it would seem that you don't have to be rich to own that much land). The Outer Banks itself is probably not indicative of inland Southern living --OBX benefits immensely from 'renter taxes' and boasts some of the best schools in the south. The homes are all big, beautiful and outrageously overpriced. I love the surf shops, the HUSH PUPPIES, the giant sand dunes, the shells that you can find on the beach before dawn and the 'realness' of the locals. My stress fades away there --it's not just the fuschia sunsets over the Currituck Sound, or the dolphins and pelicans racing over the waves in Corolla...it's the pace of life there...Slower and laid back. Road rage virtually non-existent. It is hard to get used to at first and sometimes I catch myself in big-city-mode wanting everyone to hurry up. It was also hard to get used to the fact that everyone talks to you -at first you awkwardly say hello back and unconsciously grip your purse. Now I love meeting the variety of people that North Carolina has to offer, and look forward to conversations that quickly lead to each person's 'story'. I know many Northerners snub the south --I have had the rare pleasure of being able to love both worlds... This trip was too quick and I can't wait until the end of September when we go back for a week or two. When I am here- I can't imagine living anywhere else, but as soon as I cross the Wright Memorial Bridge-I wonder what keeps me in the urban jungle...

      Ok, so I had to return from my beautiful sand and sun filled week to this...sigh... I wanted to come back (reveling in my argument-free zone) and write a nice little post on how much this Yankee loves the South --I guess that will have to wait for another day. I see that (conveniently) in my absence I have been attributed words that were not mine and bashed on my own site. I will not be able to sleep tonight if I do not address this now (BigandMean-I am now passing on the limerick....hope he'll understand). First of all, I had promised myself that I would be internet free while I was away...I cheated and peeked at the site shortly after my arrival (already a bit grumpy from an eight hour car ride). I read what Rab wrote (2nd post) and quickly shut down the computer...I vowed that I would not let this *cough* "writer" ruin my time.... Being perfectly honest, I did stew for a bit --resisting the urge to shoot back right away. Then something happened. A friend of mine (M), that lives where we were visiting, stopped by with a 'belated' Birthday cake. It was homemade (she doesn't normally cook) and itwas even two layers. It had a little picture of President Bush and a GOP elephant done painstakingly in red, white and blue sugar. M is a liberal. How cool is that! All of my ire melted away and I realized that I had nothing to be upset about. Most of us can have very different political views and be civil --some of us can even have very different political views and be great friends --few of us can have very different political views and spend hours on something that is the opposite of our views just because it will make a friend smile... I have that in my life --I would dare to guess that the "writer" Rab does not. What 'Rab' does have is the ability to prove my point that 'peace activists' are often pretty nasty people. Sticks and stones Rab... I was going to respond by simply deleting all of his comments (nice little links to his silliness at the end of them all) --I do welcome discussion, but if I wanted blind hate and lies -I would see Moore's film or read Moveon.org's webpage. BUT I will not be a party to censorship the way that the ACLU and the left seek to censor all conservative thought. Then I thought about challenging him to put up his life against mine --his charities, his volunteer time, his sacrifices for his fellow man -to see how the talk of the left holds up to the action of the right...but then I realized I would have no way of knowing what was true. I came to this conclusion: There has been plenty of healthy discourse on this page and he is the only one that has ever gotten nasty--so he can feel free to "monitor my repugnant site" and he can link me as 'the danger to society' and he can even label me a "fascist" --and I won't censor what he writes (I guess blowing the whole 'fascist theory'), I would still hold the door for him if he were behind me, and will refrain from bomb-throwing and name calling (though I have some good ones)....I guess that's just the difference between him and me.  I know this will be long but I must answer specific charges made (not only by Rab the 'writer', but also TWD and Lefty-I retract the previous 'chivalrous' comment boys): 1) I would think that this would be obvious, but I guess not --I did not comment on the last post--I specifically wrote that I wasn't commenting...so it would be hard for me to be "posting slanderous comments" IF I DIDN'T COMMENT.  2) The "rich republican donor" donated 100,000 to Swiftboat Vets for Truth a 527. How much has George Soros donated to moveon.org a 527? 11 - 15 MILLION... I don't hear ya complaining about that...  3) I didn't derive from "one article" that Kerry committed war crimes ...I derived from Kerry saying that he committed war crimes that Kerry committed war crimes. Hmmmm, I thought that was an easy one too....  4) I linked the website because it is relevant -because Kerry has made his 4 mths. in Vietnam the center piece of his campaign. I didn't comment because I am waiting the read the book-- UNFIT FOR COMMAND when it is released (8/13)    urlLink http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0895260174/qid=1092111821/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-9485739-8439845?v=glance&s=books&amp;n=507846   5) The 'facts' that I put in one of my comments are not my facts --they were directly from an except of this book -UNFIT FOR COMMAND -in a store near you on August 13, 2004. These were not from me (or Sean Hannity Mr. LeftyJones) -they were from Kerry's fellow officers. As for John McCain (first TWD -I don't know why this would mean anything to me either way as he has been quite the RINO lately) BUT McCain thought that this ad was put out by Ted Sampley (who runs Vietnam Vets Against John Kerry). Sampley had smeared him in 2000. McCain was wrong -Sampley had nothing to do with this ad.  In summation, I wish Vietnam wasn't an issue. The fact is, that regardless of what I think of his actions when he returned from Vietnam (which were 'repugnant'), he was awarded medals of honor. Another fact is that Bush was given an "Honorable Discharge" from the Air National Guard. That should be the end of it. This should be a referendum on the President's performance over the last four years put up against Kerry's record in the Senate over the past 20 years...end of story. But you people can't have it both ways...if you are going to ignore the 'fact' and accuse Bush of being a deserter, and if Kerry is going to walk into his convention with a Band of Brothers and 'report for duty' -choosing to run on his four months in Vietnam instead of his 20 years as a senator --then this is what it opens up. Why should the 13 on the stage with him have a voice and escape vetting -while the 250 against him get accused of...well you name it and they have been accused of it. Why can we not question Kerry because of his service and medals -yet these men (who served longer and many of which have more medals) can be readily dismissed....I just don't get it. Ask yourself this...if you found someone that said that they could prove that George Bush really didn't show up to the NG duty for a year...would you finance the commercial -or the book? I think we all know the answer already................ (Thanks Kat --your comment kept me sane *smile*)  P.S. Notice that Rab 'the writer' never said anything about Mumia --I threw it in there to see if he would bite (these people are so predictable)...and of course -jackpot!

                                  A recent article, from the Wall Street Journal, detailed findings that suggested most children retain the politics of their parents.    I think this is a fascinating subject. I was not raised in a particularly political house, and am not quite sure how my love of politics and policy began...    Does the fact that my boys are growing up in a very political house mean that they will adopt our values –or will they rebel against them?    I decided to ask each of my boys some questions and see how much they have already been ‘indoctrinated’ to our way of thinking… I  am  interested in the evolution of personal politics, but I did this more for a bit of levity…      THE POLITICS OF THE FIVE YEAR OLD :     ME:     What is your name?     JUSTICE:     Justice      ME:     Who is the President?     JUSTICE:     President Bush     (I won’t brag or anything, but he has been able name the ENTIRE administration including “Who runs the Federal Reserve” and various other world leaders since he was 3 ½)     ME:     Who wants to be the President?     JUSTICE:     John Kerry…the wiener      (He watches that JibJab movie 100X a day –he likes hearing J.K. say ‘dumb ass’).     ME:     Who do you want to win?     JUSTICE:     President Bush     ME:     Why?     JUSTICE: Because President Bush makes toys a little bit of money and John Kerry takes so much money you can’t get me any toys.      (I have NO idea where he came up with that…I swear…)     ME:     What is the President’s job?      JUSTICE:     To protect the army men and all the people with   Tom    Ridge  .     ME:     What do you want the President to do for you?     JUSTICE:     Buy me 100 toys.     ME:     What is the most important problem the President has right now?     JUSTICE:     The hurricane in   North   Carolina  ….oh, and Saddam-Who-BinLaden         ME:     Why, what did Usama Bin Laden do?     JUSTICE:     He knocked our buildings down…Daddy loved those buildings…remember he said lots of bad words, like............         THE POLITICS OF THE THREE YEAR OLD :      ME:        What’s your name?       MASON:     ‘Poop Poopypants’       ME:        What is your name?       MASON:     ‘Poop’       ME:     Ok, who is the President?       MASON:        Sean Hannity…on the Big Talker 1210.

                              Watching a re-run of Bill Maher's show last night got me thinking...it got me furious too, but that is for another post. Bill made what I feel was an erroneous statement--He claimed that 'liberal' has a negative connotation in our society, but 'conservative' doesn't. I am not sure where Bill lives, but it sure ain't in Philly (bad gammar used purposely for effect). Being a conservative in Philadelphia is a risky proposition --espcially when you have 'Bush/Cheney '04' on the back of your vehicle. I have been flipped off, growled at, cut off (so the driver behind me can get in front of me to make sure I see his "Like Father Like Son -One Term and You're Done" bumper sticker), and tailed late at night by hulking men in those tiny almost-trucks (AKA union thugs)...You name it -it's happened. So, I reject the notion that 'conservative' is an ideology that is widely accepted and embraced... That train of thought dropped me off here: Liberals often object to general terms being used: such as 'terrorist' or 'homicide bomber'...I have been advised on numerous occasions to understand that the 'opposition' is another human being. They say that if we 'understand' them, we won't dehumanize them --and subsequently demonize them. So, in an attempt to make myself 'more human' --and detract from the moniker of 'angry right-wing blonde' --I will divulge a bit of personal information. That being said --this was inspired by JustRose who thinks I need to expose my underbelly a bit more (to prove that it doesn't have scales on it).  1. I might as well get this right out of the way...I love fruitcake. Not just the expensive kind with the real pineapples and almonds, but even the cheap gooey stuff with those disgusting green things in it.  2. I love lists .  I have been known to make lists of lists that I need to write.  3. I smoke.  It is my one vice and I love it.  4. I don't drink.  Not out of a religious conviction -or a 'recovering' problem...I just don't like it.  5. I watch the Sound of Music at least six times a year.  6. One of the only foods that I actually  crave  is Peanut Butter Captain Crunch.  7. I am obsessive about matching -even undergarments or pajamas (what if there was a fire?) --This causes me to have to switch handbags everytime I change.  8. I have a Coach Bag fetish...I have a lot (which helps with fact #7). I sometimes go into the Coach store just to inhale the leather.  9. I also have a 'soft t-shirt' fetish. I have been known to fondle t-shirts...even if there is someone in them. (James Pearce and C&C -ALa71 tested &amp; approved)  10. The name choices for my second son were Dionysus or Bronte...proving that it is not always beneficial to be the child of an English major. We named him Mason.  11. One entire room of my house is adorned in Marilyn Monroe memorabilia.  12. I am only 5'2 and I have never wished that I was taller.  13. In high school I played field hockey, softball and was a cheerleader.  I once got MVP.  14. My son, Justice , and I walk for miles on the beach early in the morning to pick up trash.  15. I still watch 'The Real World' and 'Road Rules' (OK, so I have 2 vices)  16. My youngest son wants to be 'popcorn' when he grows up.  17. I have a very silly sense of humor --during the most heated arguements, if my husband says something ridiculous ('squishy underpants') I find it impossible to stay mad.  18. I have met Sean Hannity twice...a picture of me, him, and my boys will live forever on my refrigerator.  19. I love dogs with no noses: pugs, frenchies, bulldogs and mastiffs. I feel guilty about it, but I don't like mixed-breeds (but I have been bit badly twice -both times a mixed-breed). We have a Freedom Bulldog named 'Tink'...  20. I often sing into my round brush while I am driving --this embarasses my husband to death!

              FOX NEWS: ANCHOR-We are getting reports of a car bomb that has gone off in   Baghdad   –tentative reports say it may be in front of a Christian Church…wait we are getting the first pictures.    The smoke looks very black, can this really be a car bomb or was a fuel station hit?      REPORTER-No, this is a car bomb –they have gotten very good at making them out here.     ME: That’s was CB said the other day.     HUSBAND: Yeah, I know.     SISTER: Who is CB?     ME: He’s our soldier…            Mine, justrose’s, ~Jen~’s, 91Ghost’s, EXFBonnie’s, ThisWe’llDefend’s (the list is endless)….he has become ‘our soldier’, and many of us are here because we started reading his site and ours evolved from there.             Fox News: Anchor:We are also getting reports there was a bomb in   Mosul  …            My heart sinks…I will be checking every hour to see if CB posted now.    How did this stranger become such an important part of my life?    I have been thinking about this all day as I fretted over the fact that he has yet to post at  10pm EST.     What if something happened to him?    How will we know?    Do his parents know about the site?    His wife?         No matter what our politics of origin, those of us who flock to his site -(for the most part) leave them behind there.    It is a sanctuary from the vitriol.    There we don’t care so much if it’s Bush or Kerry –we only care to know that he’s OK and that he continues to feed our addiction to war-real-time.    Maybe somewhere deep down we all feel guilty (stateside guilt I always say)…if we read each and every day we are involved –invested even.            JUSTICE: Mom, I want to see what CB looks like.     ME: You can’t, he can’t put his picture up.     JUSTICE: You have yours there.     ME: I am not at war.            Sometimes I feel like we are all being selfish –maybe not consciously, but selfish none-the-less.    We want confirmation to validate our point of view… “See he says that he is mad at Bush for stop-loss…” “No see, he said that he thinks it would be a slap in the face to vote for Kerry…” and so on...      I notice reading the posts that many try to slip in their views --scantily veiled in ‘concern’…”CB, I am undecided, but vote Kerry so maybe you can home quicker.” In some small way maybe we all want him to justify all that we have said-- for or against the war.               ME: Dad, have you read the soldier blog that is linked to my site yet?     DAD: It takes me long enough to read everything on yours.     ME: Read his instead then, you will love it…read his.    Ya know what he said the worst pick up line in   Iraq   is?     DAD: What?     ME: Are you a terrorist, cause you da bomb….            Here is a person that I have never met…a person who has no first name…no face…yet a friend.    His words have become so familiar –so anticipated.    He seems to be the embodiment of all that is good in this country.    A hero….yet he is often blunt, disgruntled…and human.    A visitor to his site once pointed out that the ‘hawks’ were overlooking glaring signs that say, “Anti-war” –the painting choice, the link to Hunter Thompson…but I think that’s what I find so wonderful.    He seems mad about the war sometimes –yet the next day touched by a gesture from a local.    He listens to SOD, but reads Hunter Thompson.    He comes from a republican family –yet contemplates a vote for Nader.           ME: Do you think more than one person writes CB’s page?     JUSTROSE: Why?     ME: Because he just doesn’t make sense. Hunter Thompson said that he would rip off the heads and piss down the neck of this Nazi administration….     JUSTROSE: No, it’s just him…           I disagree with those who constantly tell him to go to school for writing/journalism.    Academia will steal his edge and attempt to reign in his raw talent and passion.    His writing is real and prompts many of us to respond with words of comfort and well-wishes each day.     The things that many of us say/want to say to him –“We are proud of you”, “Stay safe”, “Thank you for what you are doing”…seem to ring hollow typed in the comments section of the blog…but I know they are all truly from each person’s heart.     There is no figuring this soldier out –and that’s why he is everyone’s soldier…he is our soldier.          *For anyone that hasn’t read CBFTW’s site –please do at  urlLink http://cbftw.blogspot.com/

                   1)          Provided “Winter Soldier”, as listening entertainment, for POW’s in cells and cages in   Vietnam  .       2)          Provided work for Military Personnel Records when they had to re-ship the medals/ribbons that he threw at the White House.       3)          Provided various jobs in editing, publishing and book distribution when he published ‘The New Soldier’ in 1971 (–but he is hindering jobs now that he won’t allow it to be republished…wonder why?)       4)          Provided work for restaurant wait staff as he romanced Morgan Fairchild, Cornelia Guest and even President Reagan's daughter, Patti Davis –all while still married to Julia Thorne.       5)          Provided employment for psychiatrists, counselors and pharmacists to treat then suicidal first wife –as he left her to campaign to become Dukakis’ Lt. Governor.       6)          Provided employment for lawyers when divorcing first multi-millionaire wife.       7)          Provided work for Archdiocese when he petitioned for an annulment from Thorne even though they had two grown daughter together.       8)          Provided employment for more lawyers to set up pre-nup with Theresa.       9)          Provided employment for various city workers when he demanded a fire hydrant be moved from the front of his house to fit his SUV (that he owned in   Detroit  , but didn’t own on Earth Day).       10)      Provided steady employment for hairdressers.       11)      Provided employment for various plastic surgeons.       12)      Provided work for various mechanics to maintain private jets/planes.       13)      Provided work for many service people in maintaining various mansions (though this may include outsourcing as some are overseas).       14)      Providing future plans to create jobs as lawyers stand by in   Florida   awaiting election results.       15)      Continuing to provide endless fodder for conservative bloggers.             I see that I have rushed to judgment.    In the past, I have wrongly insinuated that Kerry has done nothing-- clearly I was wrong…
