      Why is it that even if you wanted him before, when someone else wants him, you want him a lot more than you ever did? Jealousy is so stupid, and yet, it gets everyone, even the best of people. You don't even know all the details, and you just jump to the conclusion that for some reason, she's taking him from you. But he's not even yours. And still you feel like he is yours. Duh, okay people are not property. To put it in a better way, you feel like she is taking his heart from you or maybe his love for you--even if it's a friendly love or more than that--or something along those lines. She's already closer to him in many ways, but you feel connected to him more deeply anyways. You fool yourself into believing he's yours, but he's not. The truth is that he's more hers than he'll ever be yours. You stare from afar, and yet, you're just too far, farther than you ever imagined.   Okay, enough of that for now. It's way too unrequited love-ish. Maybe I'm just tired--well no I am tired. Maybe the lack of sleep is getting to me or maybe I'm thinking honestly for once. Who knows?

      Before you jump to any conclusions that I'm joining in a crazy trend, stop and think. When have you known me not to want to express myself? Exactly. I figure I've used up just about every piece of paper in my house, every notebook, every scrap to use as a journal. People wonder why I keep a journal in the first place. It's just a place where I write down what I'm thinking because surprise, surprise,I think a lot. I'm done wasting paper. Online there are no cross-outs, no white out, no pens running out and I can type faster than I can write. Plus, I spend a lot of time online talking to people, researching for school, and looking into things, so I decided to try this blog thing out. If I don't like it after a while, it'll disappear and if I do like it, it'll stay up. What harm is there in either of those options?  "Why not take a crazy chance? Why not do a crazy dance? If you lose a moment, you may lose a lot, so why not? Why not?" Okay, this isn't that crazy, but it fits nonetheless. I like to express myself, so I'm doing it here. If you don't like to hear what I have to say, then don't visit. This is for me, just like any other piece of paper or journal I've had in the past was. Sometimes, it may be thought-provoking. Other times it may be boring. Sometimes it could get sappy. Visit at your own risk, but whatever you decide to do, welcome to my new haunt.   S Double W...what does that mean? Okay, Nicholle-that's what S double w stands for. Nicholle is from the Greek phrase meaning literally, "she will win." That meaning to my name has always bothered me in a way. Just think about it-she will win. I always wonder what would happen if I just stopped winning. People always comment that I win, and I do win, so don't take me the wrong way. I'm proud of my achievements and the person I am today, but I wonder what'll happen if I stop winning all of a sudden. Like one day, I just don't win anymore. Then what? I don't like that uncertainty, so I guess I make myself win. "She will win" is always going to be there. It's a part of me--it's my name. I can't escape that, so rather than try to run from it, I'll embrace it. Maybe I won't always win. In fact, probability tells me I won't always win. The good thing is that I don't have to win anymore.

      Also...do we have a right to question ourselves so much? Maybe first impressions are our bodies' way of signalling us that this person is not to be liked, trusted, accepted. Maybe first impressions are to keep us from trusting "wolves in sheeps' clothing."   At first, I didn't like a lot of people, and in the end, after giving them a chance, I think I was right in the first place. Maybe I should trust myself more to make a quick decision and if someone or something instinctively doesn't work for me, maybe it shouldn't.   I could name a bunch of people who I met and knew I'd never like. Then, with most of them, I gave them a chance despite this initial feeling, and in the end, it turns out I was right.   I feel like I'm a good judge of character. I seem to be right about it in the end, but because of what society and my peers tell me--not to be prejudiced, I give them a chance. In the end, I'm usually right about my first impression.   Thus, I don't trust my body's initial reaction to vomit and purge myself of every memory of the person. I try despite it, and maybe that's wrong.   Maybe there is some way our bodies know better than our minds because they are not influenced by society. Maybe I should trust my instincts more often. Maybe I should stop giving people the benefit of the doubt, but then, sometimes, they deserve it. It's so hard to decide what's right. I guess we can only hope to find a balance between the two extremes.

      Ever notice how you can be having an awesome time for say three hours, but then something bad happens for say thirty minutes, but at the end of the night, all you can really remember are those thirty minutes? They ruin the fun. Is anger for some reason a stronger emotion? Or is it resentment, hatred, disgust?  I was having a pretty good time and everything was fine, but then it wasn't anymore. The entire evening turned sour and everything that had been so fun disappered in my mind. All I could see was the horrible experience playing out before me.   Once I heard this strange thing about "toxic friends" and it basically defined these people as friends who have a negative influence on your life and often get you into bad situations. I wonder if they can expand that definition.  I'd define "toxic friends" as people who are not your friends, or people who are your friends, but then, many times, don't live up to what it means to be a friend. Naturally, there are times when people cannot live up to this, but when it becomes more frequent than not, I guess then someone becomes a "toxic friend."  I'd also say after tonight I've found one more person to add to this list.   It's possible to move off of this list once a person stops being a "toxic friend," but it of course takes work because the trust has to be rebuilt. A new foundation must be formed for another real relationship to blossom.   Thanks to the fruitful work of one such toxic friend, I don't think I'll trust anyone for a long time. Everything I told him, he threatened to reveal to a lot of people, and among them, to the one person who could never hear it. I mean, it's not like my world is completely different, but we all have our own, unique worlds. I choose to live in mine and that's fine, but to reveal its inner workings to this one person would destroy it. It would cause my world to tarnish, diminish, and then crumble before my eyes.   I don't know any way to live life, but in my world. To take that away from me, would be to take everything. I'd have to find a new world, and that's not fair. For someone who calls himself a friend to threaten to hurt me that much, it's unexpected, it's unthinkable, it's disgusting.   Then, after all was said and done, after all the threats were proved idle, he had nothing to say. I got upset and it ruined my night, and possibly more than that. It ruined my sense of trust in other people.  Because we both had so much to lose, I thought he'd never dare put himself in jeopardy by saying what he threatened to say, but I guess there comes a point where you have nothing to lose, while the other has everything to lose. A true friend, at that point, would drop the information in his mind and act as if he never heard it for fear of it ever looming up again to harm his friend. A toxic friend would not.  Tonight, he did not. Rather, he tried to hurt me, then when it was all over, he didn't really try to apologize. Instead, he tried to say my actions condoned his. He tried instead to claim I can't hold a grudge. Then, at the end of the night, he tried to shake my hand. Shaking someone's hand, in its original use, was a sign of respect and admiration. He throws it around at whim, and to shake my hand after such a display--the thought of it made me ill, so I said goodnight and I held my tongue as best I could, hoping for the night finally to end. He then had to audacity to say that I could "stay mad" as if I were holding a grudge when the disgusting display had just happened. Of course, my original reaction and emotion was anger. In fact, that's all I felt.  Right now, I feel more than anger. I feel distrust. I feel disappointment in him and in myself for having trusted him, and for having allowed him to mar my night of fun.   It's going to take a lot for me to trust again and if we ever hope to be friends again, it's going to take much, much more.   I just literally cannot believe what happened. I don't want to believe it, but I guess I'll just have to come to terms with it. I'll have to understand that some people are "toxic friends," that some relationships only last so long, that trust is always broken, that hearts are always broken, and that love fades, time moves on, people move on, and things are meant to be.

      I had a ton of fun today. Ultimate basketball, "you can't handle the booty," "chunky booty," swimming olympic jumps, walking in the desert for hours, singing along to girly movies, "let's make a hit list to become valedictorians...oh by the way, Nicholle you're on it," "finally, something Nicholle's not good at," music drama, exercising, "Surfing USA," and the dance floor.   I spent like no time actually in my house today. Girls' afternoon with AB, Becca, and Britt was fun. Of course, we watched portions of my video library including The Lizzie Maguire Movie and How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days. Good, girly movies. Britt and I sang along at the end of Lizzie because as we say, the music at the end saves the whole movie from totally sucking.  Swimming all afternoon until then deciding to watch Jeopardy, then playing Ultimate Basketball *yes it's capitalized because now it's our sport,* then going back to the pool, eating some cake...mmmmm...then talking about music drama galore.  During basketball, we discovered that Nicholle is not just a smart girl, she plays basketball too, haha. It was too funny. Brittany got a tad intense and Natasha resorted to physical violence. Her friend from Roselle is really cool too. Caroline and Diana got crazy with their "You can't handle the booty" team slogan. It was too much fun for a basketball game. Now Caro and I are gonna kick some butt in tennis to prove our skill, and I'm a hero...I saved a life, well sort of.  With all of this going on, I was having an amazing time, but also thinking about some stuff in the back of my mind. I was surprised at how many times a certain name came up, despite the person not being there. There wasn't much associated with the person either, but the name kept being mentioned in some form or another. Its frequent mention hit me since I really hadn't thought about the person in a long time, well in a while since we haven't talked since one strange, akward conversation, then an abrupt goodbye out of bitterness.   It sort of made me wonder if I'd ever be friends with the person again, but then I remembered I hadn't done anything wrong. I don't need to blame myself. I don't need to wonder if we'll talk again. It's really not my problem. The first move is up to that person because I feel the person owes me more of an apology than I could possibly owe in return. And with me leaving on Monday for a month, well ugh, now with all this annoying paperwork drama, I BETTER be leaving on Monday, then being home for a really short time before leaving the country, I don't know if we'll have a chance to fix things before it's way too late. And if it becomes too late, I wonder if whatever happens is what is meant to happen. If I say yes, then maybe we're not supposed to be friends past this point.   So yeah, I guess if I were to ask a question that you guys could answer later, it'd be : "Do you agree that certain people are in your life for a set amount of time, to touch it or affect it or teach you something and then when their time is up and it's time for them and you to move on, that's it?" I think I agree. "Are there only a limited group of people with whom you're supposed to share your entire life or do we lose people because of our own faults, our own shortcomings, our own petttiness?" So think about that.

      I got into the Junior Statesmen Program at Princeton. It starts on Monday and I'll be done July 22nd. That means a month of fun and I hope an amazing, unforgettable experience. Looks to be awesome. Then, I go to London, then I go to Paris.   This news makes me even happier (if that's even possible at this point...Yay). I won't be around this summer, so I hope to find some adventure and fun.  Yay. Ugh, I'm sooooooooooooo HAPPY!!!!

      OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! School is over! Junior year of hell is over! Two months of freedom ahead. I'm so happy, I can't even describe it. I literally haven't stopped smiling since I got home from the Bio Final. I don't even care how I did on that. I'm floating on a major high.   I feel totally deserving of the title of Senior now. We made it through an insane schedule of tests, quizzes, papers, pop quizzes, writing assignments, homework, and just everything College Board could throw at us all at once. We made it through AP French V and crazy Alma, AP English and anal Beaumont, AP US History and liberal, black power advocate Z, AP Biology and class wars and evil tests, Honors Math Analysis and hilarious Morris with her annoying mini quizzes. Why couldn't she just call them pop quizzes, lol? That always bugged me. Oh my gosh. So many memories from this crazy year. It's been such a wild ride. Drama, friends, unforgettable times, lunch jokes, morning fights, great weekends...And now it's all over.   That's good and bad I guess, but I'm not gonna get all nostalgic and start into a refrain from "Memories." I'm too happy for that.   I feel like a huge weight has been lifted and I can finally breathe. Maybe that's why everyone thought I was unhappy this year...because I was too busy to feel happiness. I needed to focus, but now I'm done and I couldn't be happier. I definitely feel happiness now, so don't be surprised if I smile a LOT more. Believe me, I've tried to stop smiling, but it's not working. I feel like I'm feeling all the happiness from the year that's been stored up and is exploding now. Haha. YES! OMG! This is amazing. I don't think I've ever felt this this...I have no words...it's ineffable.   I could go on forever about how elated I am, but I'd rather go do something more productive. Just one more...OMG! I'm so HAPPY! LoL. Okay, now I'm done.  NBTHS Class of 05!!!

      So my "Puzzle Solved" caused considerable drama. Apparenlty, a lot of people think I'm talking about them when I'm talkng about one person. I will say that one person who did ask was right, but I'm not going to dignify the inquiries by answering anyone.  Some people took this badly and I guess they concluded that if I wouldn't tell them, it must be them. About five people asked me about it, and only one was right. It wasn't meant to cause drama. It was meant to be a sort of catharsis for me. So, assume it was you if you want to and if not, whatever. I'm talking to one person who I'm sure is now convinced he's right.   But here's a general hint about how to approach me. If you think I may be upset with you for some reason, try calling me or being nice about asking me. If you go about it the wrong way, there's no need to ask if I'm mad at you because I'm sure if you screwed up in the way you asked enough, I am now.

      I solved the puzzle. Everything since last year now makes sense and it's hard to believe everything hinged on one little message in a yearbook. See, yearbooks cause revelations. I told you so.  To you, I just have to say you are a pretty oblivious and often times dumb person. I see that your eyes are closed now, and I don't care to try to open them for you. You can do whatever you'd like from now on. It's no longer my concern. When you show up again, don't be surprised if I'm not around. If I am around, then don't be surprised if I'm not the same person. If you don't know who you are, I'm again not surprised. Like I said, you're oblivious and often times dumb. I guess you'll figure it out eventually and when you do, it'll probably be because I'll be gone and you'll wonder why.  Don't wonder why. Just think back to everything that's gone on and then remember a yearbook message. Yes, you should feel dumb once you figure out the puzzle like I just did. You tried so hard to confuse me, but I'm a smart girl, remember?   Yes, I'm a smart girl, so I'm done doing stupid things like...um...hanging out with the likes of you. I'm done.   But I'm really not bitter. I would actually like to thank you. Now, I won't waste more of my time.   Funny puzzle. It's solved now, so don't worry about it. I understand the course of events and I'm not bitter. Thanks.

      So since I haven't written in a while, I figured I might as well. I'm not going to go into everything that's been on my mind because trust me, it's a lot. I'm just not in the mood to delve into the..."ocean of emotions where no definitions exist and things lurk under the surface to appear out of nowhere."   Basically, rather than talk about some of the deep things that have been on my mind, I'll just talk about stuff that's been happening in general.  Let's see. I took my History, Math, and French finals already. Just English and Biology to go. I'm so not studying for English because it's just two essays and there's really no preparation you can do for that, so whatever. I'll probably get the same grade I always get. And anyways, the fact that*(kiss my butt, E. B. Strunk and White)I'm studying for finals in the first place is a joke. No matter what I get, my final grades for the year are going to be the same. The only class it would affect would be Math anyways. I studied for that one. We'll see how I did on Monday when that grade is posted.   Besides finals, yearbook signing has been an issue this year. I haven't had enough time to sign even like a quarter of the yearbooks I wanted to. I really wish we had one day before finals where teachers did nothing and just let us sign yearbooks and finish the year. Wishful thinking I know.   Considering that idea of yearbooks...I really don't know how one message can be enough for some people. For example, if someone is your best friend, a message in their yearbook is nice of course, but how can it say enough? And for another example, if someone is leaving for college, same question. A little message in a big book isn't going to say too much. And on that note, what's up with people writing what they couldn't say all year in yearbooks?   They write it at the last minute as if things can all of a sudden change or evolve. Like in the old show Felicity, he wrote about how much he'd been admiring her from afar as they were leaving for college. Now that's messed up. They could have had an entire four years or more together and the stupid boy waits until the absolute last minute to tell her. But then, the stupid girl forgoes her dreams of attending Stanford (well it wasn't certain if that was totally her dream and not just her parents', but she wanted to go there for her entire life) and she follows him to NYU.  That's too funny. Now that I think about it, that show has a lot of parallels with my life. But that's too much for this entry. But yeah, my point in drawing the example from Felicity was that if you have regrets, I don't know if a yearbook is the best place to express an unrequited love or something like that. Maybe you should have done that when you had time together. Maybe if you want to do it at the last minute, you should be a little more romantic than that. I don't know. That's just my take.  Yeah, it sucks to have regrets, but at a certain point, you missed the opportunity and you can't go back in time to change what you didn't do by leaving a message in a yearbook. If you love someone, then tell him or her. I agree with that, but I don't think it should be revealed for the first time in a parting message. That leaves way too much to be desired. You'll never know what would have happened had you taken the opportunity, but now it's too late, so stop being selfish.  Now, I see one exception to this rule--one very important one. If you and this person met late in life, and you and this person have been friends throwing hints at one another for the longest time, and you and this person cannot just tell one another because you've had premature such revelations in the past or you've had issues in the past, and if one of or both of these people is leaving soon and you want to take advantage of the time you have left, and if you want to be tied to one another by a stronger, more dear bond than that of friendship--then go ahead and write a sappy yearbook message explaining how you've loved him or her for the longest time, but couldn't say it and wish you had.   In that case, and that case only, it's sweet. It's cute, it's amazingly romantic and fairy tale-esque. In other situations, it's a selfish and pathetic attempt that can be summed up in the common expression of being too little and too late, or as my grandmother would say you're "trying to pick up the barrel after the fish have been let out." I love my grandmother's quirky quotes. Haha.   Anyways, I didn't want to get into a belief or anything, but I digressed or I guess you could say I developed. Whatever.   So Tuesday is the "Picnic of Splendor." I don't know if I'm going to go to that. I'll figure it out later. Then you have a couple of cool parties thrown by a couple of cool people later in the week, and then you also have the graduation performance on Wednesday.   It's going to be so hot and sticky and disgusting out there I cannot even believe it. Some people think they'll be useless because they'll be so upset that their seniors are leaving. Some people think it's going to rain, but Egan says if it rains, it'll be a good thing. He says we'll just take our instruments inside, then have a band v. orchestra football game in the mud. I just find that idea all too amusing. I cannot imagine in my wildest dreams anyone in orchestra daring to do that. I could see practically the entire band up for it, but not the orchestra. You have to admit though, that'd be funny.  So anyways, I guess I'm sort of sad the seniors are leaving, but we all knew it was coming. Some of them are awesome people I'll sincerely miss and wish I could have had more time with, but oh well. That's life. We have the summer and then we can keep in touch and have visits. Time flies; people change; they grow; they evolve; they change; they move away; they die. That's how life goes on. "It's the circle of life" on a smaller scale when talking about graduation. So yes, my point is that I'll be quite useful during the performance. I don't think I'll cry. If I do, I'll be so surprised. I'll be sad or whatever, but I accept it. Of course I'll miss them, but that's how it goes.   So, as for an update...finals are almost over. School is almost over. Graduation is near, at which, I'll be fine. Yearbooks can cause drama and revelations. You often don't miss someone until he or she is gone. You often don't realize how much you love someone until he or she has disappeared, but yearbooks are just not the place unless of course it's an exceptional situation.   I've been thinking a lot lately, but this was supposed to be an update. I think I ended up going a little deeper than that. Oh well.

      I saw the fireworks at the carnival on Saturday, and while I was watching the fireworks, fireworks went off in my head. I get it now. I understand what I couldn't before. I know, I know. What am I even talking about? Well, it's complicated.  I was right about a lot of stuff, but I was wrong about much more. You'd think I'd learn by now. But, I'm just not that slick. Oh well. I don't seem to take the knowledge I gain from one experience and apply it to another. I'm going to have to work on that. I mean, I've had experience with this and I could have prevented my being totally mistaken had I just thought about what I learned before from the exact same situation.  Did I just think it'd be different this time for no reason? Did I randomly say to myself, self, this time is different because this time is later in time? That's dumb. This time is just like last time. The only difference is that this time I feel dumber. Why would I expect you to open your eyes this time when you didn't before?   Because I'm kidding myself. That's the only reason I can come up with. Old habit really do die hard. They just stick around, or at least, they stick around for me. I don't know if other people have the same issues. I sincerely doubt it. Otherwise, mankind is dumber than I thought. There have to be those people who learn from the past in all situations and apply the knowledge effectively to future similar situations.   Well, I'm here to say I'm not one of those privileged people. Clearly, I can't be when I just fell into the same mind trap for maybe the third time this year. All I know is that I can't wait until next year when I won't be able to fall into such traps. It will no longer be an option. If that gives you a clue as to how where when who or what I'm talking about, then all I have to say is: aren't you Nancy Drew? Well, I'm done. I just pretty much needed to rant about my stupidity.   I don't want to fall into the same trap again. This isn't even like the second time, so it's just messed up. Once the signs appear, I'll just steer clear. I'll ignore the statements and hints. I'll ignore the attention. I'll ignore the proposals. Then, I won't fall into the same trap again.   The only problem with that--I'm sure I've said that before too. Hopefully, I'll succceed this time.

      Lately I've been thinking about the situation of just about everything in my life. I've been thinking about how commomplace and predictable everything is until something unexpected, and usually bad, occurs to rattle my set foundation. And I've been wondering.  Wondering "what if" never does any good, but I can't help but wonder about the state of certain things. Some things are just so ordinary and regimented that they don't seem natural, and if they're not natural, then what is? Am I supposed to lead this life? I mean, there's nothing particulary wrong with it. It just seems so safe, secure, and set--and don't get me wrong, those are good things I'm lucky to have--but it seems so overly safe and secure that it's just freakish. Something is off, but I'm not sure what.  I'm okay with everything, but my life's so set that it can be overly tedious at times--well a lot of times. Everyone who knows me knows I love a good fairy tale with a happy ending, so it's only fitting that I refer to a Disney cartoon. In Beauty and the Beast, Belle sang, "There must be more than this provincial life."   I'm not unhappy, but I admit I'm bored. I'm not looking for drama. I'm just looking for some sort of change. This stagnation equals irritation. Nothing happens that's not planned for (with the exception of one sad loss recently). But generally speaking, my life goes on with the same schedule every day.   I'm bored and I don't think that's wrong. It's fine. I'm happy and appreciative of what I have, but I'd like some variety--that doesn't have to be sad--once in a while. I'm not looking for a fairy tale happy ending existence. I'm just looking for more than the normal set of events.   Then in thinking about that, I wonder again. Is my life the way it is because of me? Well, Sartre would say that it's a result of my choices that my life is what it is. I guess I'd have to say I agree, but then, can't I now make choices to cause some variety?   I'm not the type of person who enjoys not knowing what's going to come, but I don't like the other extreme either. Life is the other extreme for me. I'm not complaining, but I don't see any harm in shaking things up a bit. I want to see what happens and if it's wrong to be curious, I don't want to be right.   So did I make a choice that set me into this scheduled life? Yes. But what was it? What if I hadn't ever gotten involved in orchestra? What if I hadn't ever taken advanced classes or won awards? What if I hadn't been so focused on academics? What if I didn't live in a small town my whole life? Would I have come across adventure in my life? I think yes.   But I'm happy with the choices I've made. So I guess, I'll have to be contented with my life as it is because it probably is my fault. I probably missed opportunities for romance, action, and adventure. Oh well. I'm happy with the way things are, but I'd love it if I could get some variety once in a while.   So yeah. An entry of questions without real answers. Wow, the English research paper clearly affected me...thanks again Sartre.

      Today was interesting. I mean, it was a lot of stuff to experience during the course of only one day. Sad stuff, funny stuff, ridiculous stuff...ahhh memories. Good times, bad times, sad times. The day was a mixture of all three.   At least now I have some closure. I also have more faith in some of my friends. Now, I know what a chicken salad sandwich tastes like. And I have some big ideas and projects in mind for the coming weeks.   Oh when the wheels in my head start spinning, it's time to watch out. That's what my mother said to me once. Haha. I think it's true. When I set my mind to something, it is definitely time to watch out because something big is in the works. So basically, something big's on the way. Keep your eyes open.   The idea of keeping your eyes open brings to mind a few other things, but I'm not gonna go into them all. That's too much. Basically, carpe diem-seize the day-is a major one of those themes. Another one's related to that theme and centers around missed opportunity. Basically, saying what you want to say while you still can--letting someone know how much you care about him or her now, not later--those are the major components. But of course, going into everything I'm thinking connected to that would turn into an unbelievably long and personal blog. Too much so for now. Trust me, I'm doing you a favor.   So in keeping with doing favors to spare myself and others, I'm gonna end this right here and not go into all the things that have been on my mind lately. I leave you with two ideas: old habits die hard and once you get something or someone into your thoughts, that thing or person seems to stay there.

      SAT II's are finally over and I'm done with them. I'm done thinking about them and talking about them until scores come out. I don't know. They were okay I guess.   So I finished the tests, and I took a nap and when I woke up, I talked to people. And the first thing I was reminded about was the loss of an amazing person whose student I was privileged to be. Mr. Schiavone had a lot to give us and he shared so much with us, but now he is sadly no longer with us. All I am left with to say is I hope he rests in peace.   That's why this blog is entitled what it is. I'm happy I'm done with the tests and I feel relieved, but on the other hand, I feel a great sadness and loss. I'm sure that's how a lot of seniors felt yesterday. Their prom was the same night as hearing such devastating news. They were supposed to have one of the best nights of their lives thus far, but I'm sure, for many of them, this loss hung over them. I try to take comfort in the belief that he is in a better place now, but somehow, it doesn't help much.  Mr. Egan quoted someone very wise and said, "Grief is the price you pay for loving someone." It's sad, but I guess the only thing left to do is to remember the good times and memories.   So I guess these mixed feelings won't last forever. They can't possibly last forever. On the one hand, I'm happy. On the other, at least for now, I'm also sad.

       So I was hanging out with Brittany, eating ice cream, when a face from the past appeared. I was taken aback. I hadn't seen this kid for like two years. It was so weird. And then, as if reading my mind, he came over and started talking to me and it turns out he just got back from France, where I'm headed to really soon. I thought it'd be interesting had we seen one another there instead. Anyways, the whole situation was weird since Brittany had never seen him before and I had to talk to him--something inside me was urging me to. So, I talked to him. The funny thing is that he doesn't seem to have changed very&nbsp;much--still the dorky, little kid who followed us around all summer, but of course older.     &nbsp;   That wasn't the importance of seeing him, though. The important thing worth talking about now was that in seeing him, a flood of memories came into my mind from years ago and my summers with Camp Journey--the people I met, the things I did, the trips we took, the stupid, but funny sayings--just everything came back to me. And in reviewing all this, I realized I have grown and developped in life--not because of JSA or because of any single experience--but because that's the natural progression of things.     &nbsp;   The importance in seeing him stemmed also from the fact that it made me wonder. What if I had seen him in France instead of here? What if, instead of ignoring him those years ago, I had taken an interest in him and taken him up on his offer? What if I hadn't gone to Camp Journey? What if I hadn't met some of the people I did? How would I be different?     &nbsp;   The answers weren't important. The answers still aren't important. The importance was that I asked the questions in the first place. It's really amazing when you think how seemingly insiginificant things can shape your life in small, but fundamental ways.     &nbsp;   Something as trivial as meeting one kid who isn't like your best friend or even that great of a friend can matter. I wonder how many people I've met who have mattered in this way. Of course there are the ones who definitely matter--the ones whose importance manifests itself each day--your best friends, boyfriends or girlfriends, family members, teachers--but I wonder if even the smallest people whose paths you cross each day have a purpose.     &nbsp;   Like if I didn't pass that one guy, say hello, and casually smile, would the course of my day, and consequently of my life be different? I know that sounds crazy, but yes, that's what one encounter with one minor character from my past prompted me to ponder. Think about that one.     &nbsp;   It's a tough one. Because if you believe that even the passer-by can have an impact on your life, where do you draw the line? Is everything and everyone planned or does everything and everyone you come into contact with have a significant effect in shaping the course of your life from the random pedestrian to the driver at your right to the stranger at the store? Wow, I don't know.     &nbsp;   Coming face to face with your past, in my case at least, always brings up these deep questions. Tell me what you think.

       I feel really weird trying to get used to this non-schedule. Friday night, I went to see "White Chicks" with Britt and 'Em. Needless to say, very funny, but also utterly ridiculous. Saturday was me trying to wake up, while watching some Blockbuster flicks, and Sunday, I played tennis with Britt, Natasha, Jill, and her friend, Anita. Let's just say, N and N Nomenclature Nation memebers should stick to Cricket and naming things. It was fun of course, but I felt asleep.     &nbsp;  I feel as if ever since JSA, I've been asleep, and yes, it ended only a couple of days ago, but seriously, I haven't yet woken up. I need to work on that 'cause being asleep and trying to go through the motions sucks. I think I'm just finally feeling the effects of the month without sleep or reality. I hope I wake up soon because I need to get back into the groove. My room is still a mess. I'm still packed up. My room still feels foreign without my stuff back where it belongs. I want to get settled back in, but then I'm leaving again on August 11th, which makes me sad to think that this whole summer, I'll be like&nbsp;a stranger in my own room, in my own house, in my own town, with my own friends.    &nbsp;  There definitely is a different dynamic in hanging out with my friends. It's fun, of course, but it's not how I remember it. That's dumb. It was only one month. Oh well. Yes, my point is that I won't be around in August too much either, so this summer has been bizarre.     &nbsp;  On a better note, I'll be seventeen really soon! Yay! I don't know what that means, except that I'll be another year older. I think it'll make me feel more like&nbsp;a Senior in high school. August 6th baby--17 years-old! I doubt I'll actually have time to plan an entire party, so I might just hang out with some people. I don't know. Anyways, this was just an update, so nothing much--simply a string of random thoughts.     &nbsp;  Maybe next time I'll write something more interesting.

       Looking back on JSA, I can't say I didn't have the time of my life. I can't say I didn't fall in love. I can't say I didn't find people across the country with whom I can share ideas, values, memories, and friendships. I can't say I didn't learn a lot about myself as a person. I can't say I haven't changed, but I can say that I don't know exactly how I have changed.  &nbsp;  I'm different, but I can't yet put my finger on it. I just know I've changed...and in my opinion, it's for the better. JSA was an amazing experience and looking back at being overwhelmed with "less sleep than I thought possible for the human body to function and more homework, readings, papers, tests, and speeches than I thought were within the legal limit," I'd do it all again just to come out of the month the person I am today. Even if that person isn't infintely different, I'm somehow changed; and those people--they've become a part of me.  &nbsp;  I think that everyone who went to JSA is a selfless person. Guys, to you, I have to say- we gave up a month with&nbsp; those we held most dear to cut ourselves off and study, and we gave up a part of our lives-we gave up parts of ourselves, but in the end, we came out better for it, with a greater understanding of the world, and with parts of ourselves dedicated to those we met and taking away a memory of each person with whom we've crossed paths.  &nbsp;  Okay, pause.com, I don't want to be totally sappy here, but I can't help it too much. I'm surprised. I thought they were just exagerating when they said you'd make friends of a lifetime and have an unforgettable experience. I thought one month couldn't possibly change a person to such a degree. I thought one month couldn't make such unforgettable memories, unforgettable friends, and a room without AC in the summer which I would cry in leaving. After graduation, it all sunk in. I didn't want to cry, and I promised myself I wouldn't, but then I said goodbye, even though people say it's just "I'll see you later,"--the sad thing is that for most of us, it's not that we'll see one another later, but that we'll simply talk to keep in touch if we do at all, and it will never come close to spending all day together, working, living, laughing together for hours.  &nbsp;  I said goodbye to my twin from TN. I said goodbye to the crazy cheese country girl. I said goodbye to my insane, passionate, sweet little roommate. I said goodbye to the driven twin who wants to go to West Pointe. I said goodbye to the crazy, looking people up on Yahoo boy from NY. I said goodbye to the cute little guy from TX. I said goodbye to my professors who were absolutely amazing. I said goodbye to my "omg, she' s out of control, pause.com" RA. I said goodbye to the insane Jamaican girl. I said goodbye to my floor. I said goodbye to the boy who touched my heart in ways he'll never know. Hell, I even said goodbye to the Kentucky and Mississippi boys.  &nbsp;  And it all saddened me. I cried hugging people goodbye. It was overwhelming, and I don't know exactly why it was so difficult, so I came up with the idea that I was so upset in saying goodbye because I didn't want to believe it was true. I didn't to believe that after letting these people into my heart for a month, I'd have to say goodbye. Well, it was true, and I'll get over it, because I'm sure we'll talk. We have to talk, but the problem is that we won't actually see one another for some time. Awww...I have to stop. This is making me sadder than ever.&nbsp;   So I don't know. I guess I want to say thanks to everyone for making my month an undeniably integral part of my development and growth&nbsp;as a person. I want to say thanks, and I dont' know what other word could express what you've all done for me. You're all amazing people, so don't ever forget it.   I plan to see you all "turning the world upside down and molding it to your liking," like Dunkar always said. I plan to see you all again. But no matter what happens or where&nbsp;I go&nbsp;in life, I'll always remember my times at JSA.   And if you think that's sappy, well keep it to yourself. Because you can't possibly understand until you've lived it. I have lived it, so I get it. This place is now ours. We are now each others' in a special way. I'll miss you all.

      So today, my internet service FINALLY started working completely here. Yay! Time for the happy dance...okay that's enough.   We went to the UN building today and hung out around NYC. Geese...I really don't know what to say because well...because so much has happened. I've met too many people and seen too much stuff and done way too much to explain it all here.  But, I have been feeling lately like I left some things unsettled in NB, and well it's true. I left some things iffy and messed up and just not right, but I don't care. I'm sorry, but I left for fun and experience, not to dwell upon our shaky parting terms. I'd rather not go into that, but guys...let's just say you have major issues. So yes, I left things in a bad way, but I'm not coming back for a while and then after I do come back, I'm leaving very soon after, so don't expect me to be around.   I'm not mad at you, really, I'm not. I'd just rather have a good time this summer and ignore our goodbyes. They weren't pretty, but I guess they never really are. Things end the way they're fated to end and maybe that night was our ending.   So yeah, just had to get some NB thoughts off my chest so I could get back to focusing on fun times. Talk to you all as soon as I can.  Mwah...I miss you!!!

      So I finally got online. It's the end of my first week at JSA and I'm absolutely loving it. But that doens't mean I'm not majorly missing some of you. You know who you are. Alas, I can't lament it. I'm making the most of it. I'm meeting new people. I'm learning. I'm living. I'm having a blast. Why is JSA an amazing experience after only one week?  1. Classes. I know, what? Classes, but yes classes. Oh my gosh. They are so interesting it's not even funny. It's an open debate and discussion forum where people from all over the country and out of the country just discuss foreign policy, controversial issues, and the rhetoric of politics. We make speeches, speeking of which my first one is on Monday. We discuss policy decisions. We debate. It's just great, nnd it's 3 hours!  2. Connected to classes...the teachers. The teachers here are amazing. At first I really wanted Dunkar because she's this out-of-this-world, Jamaican woman who just is so energetic and passionate. She urges us to turn the world upside down and the first assignment for her class was to read Colon Powell's report on the 2004 agenda and "come up with a better idea." Haha. She's so cool, and even though I don't have her, she's still like amazing. My real foreign policy teacher is Dr. Anand. She's amazing. She speaks like every language on this planet, it's crazy. She is also like THE nicest, most interesting person I think I've ever met. She already offered to put me up for a couple nights in her house in the South of France when I go later this summer because she's just that awesome. We click really well. Her class is just an open space for discussion and even though we already had our first test this Saturday, I feel like I'm getting so much out of the class. My Political Commmunication teacher, Dr. Worth, is different. He's not openly nice. You have to like earn his respect, which is admirable. He's brilliant, as is just about ever professor here. I have so much respect for them it's insane. He really makes us think about how rhetoric and politics are so realted and how rhetoric and "ethos" have taken over the system. Yeah, but everyone here loves this stuff, as do I. Oh for my Congressional Workshop class/ Debate class, I get to debate affirmative action on Wednesday.   3. The people. They people here are from all over the country and they are amazingly cool. My roommate's from Egypt. This guy we call Chief is from some commonwealth no one's ever heard of and took a 17-hour flight to get here. All the accents are so cool and I think I'm starting to pick up on lingo and accents slowly. Ahhh...we'll have to pull it out of me when I come back. The girls here are great, and the guys are...well some of them are amazingly cool, most are just perverted. But it's all good. There are a few who are really cool.   4. The Administration I guess you could call it. Anyways, the people in charge are hella* cool.(* hella= really- lingo I picked up from hanging with the California boy). They basically let us do whatever we want within reason. They're all college students, so they totally relate, but keep us under control.  5. The campus. It's BEAUTIFUL! Trust me, it is. It's really nice here and it also has the aspects of a city. Ice cream and Thomas Sweets and Palmer Square and Starbucks are just a walk away. Well, everything is just a walk away. It's such a nice change.  6. Campus Lifestyle. It was strange the first couple of days, but now it's great. We walk everywhere, which is great exercise haha. We eat between classes, we do homework starting after bedchecks at like 11:30, run around the dorms, stress together, it's great. I'm used to this schedule and then on Sundays we're totally free to roam Princton and do whatever crazy stuff we can think of. There are dances, which don't totally suck, and tons of things to do in a nice city like this. I might rethink my idea of living in a small, college town like Stanford. There's no TV. I thought that'd be a problem, but actually, with so much to do for classes and so much to do in town and around, your free hours are taken up and you don't need TV. I don't even miss it. What else? I don't know. Just the life of a college student minus the alcohol...which I doubt I'll add later...is great.   7. I'm adjusted, and I don't get lost. For those of you who really know me, you know I'm a total dork when it comes to directions, but you know what? I haven't gotten lost once. After just one day, I was leading other people around. Maybe, college life is my niche. Who knows?  There are tons more reasons for which I could go on about how amazing this place is, but I gotta get some researching done for my speech on Monday for Political Comm.   Let's just sum up and say this place rocks and it's only been one week so far. I can see why they say the friendships you forge, you'll never forget. These kids are an interesting, diverse bunch of people. It's a great experience and it's funny how fast you get to know people and open up when you're thrown into a situation like this one.

       So, I'm leaving tomorrow, which means that I won't be online for over two weeks and I won't be telling you people how my trip's going. I will tell you afterwards, but it won't be like my JSA entries could be. So yes, I'm off to see Europe--the old countries.  J'espere avoir un bon voyage. Je ne peux pas attendre pratiquer le francais et voir les monuments. Au revior.      Peut-etre que je sois une personne differente apres avoir vu les pays d'Europe.

       I'm sitting here on the eve of my seventeenth birthday, well I guess by now it is my seventeenth birthday, and I'm wondering to myself if every girl has a story to tell--if every girl feels as if she has had sixteen years of unforgettable times worthy of publication in a manuscript and being sold to the world--if every girl has a story. I don't know if my story is all that amazing because I don't know the answer to the question I just posed. If every girl has a story, well maybe I'm not alone in feeling as if sixteen years of an amazing story have taken place for me and me alone, leaving me with the responsibility to those girls who come next to write a book like "Chicken Soup"--to write a type of Chicken Soup for the Soul. Yes, I say Chicken Soup for the Soul without an adjective in front because I feel as if maybe this book would be totally different. Maybe this book would be truly a Chicken Soup for the soul, only I generally don't like soup at all, so I'd say it's something everyone loves that comforts them...or at least something I love that comforts me...like macaroni and cheese but not just any macaroni--my mother's homemade macaroni. I don't know. By the way, I've stopped using proper grammar and punctuation in this entry because well the thoughts are flowing so fast I can't bother with such conventions. So, it's around 2 am and I'm up because I for some reason can't sleep and the only remedy I can conceive is writing. It's as if I have a story to share, which brings me back to where I started--does everyone have a story?       Well, I have no clue, but I do know that I have a story I want to share, and I can't possibly do it here--there's absolutley no one crazy enough to write a life story when one's life isn't nearly half over yet--when there's so much left for this author to experience--so much yet to see and do and feel and touch and know--I mean truly know, not just know like  anyone knows from a book of accounts, but to know from firsthand experience.       Here I simply want to purge some of the thoughts keeping me from sleep. I want to go to sleep, and all I can do is roll around in bed thinking--unhealthy, I say, unhealthy. I have a story to tell of broken hearts, what ifs, missed chances, stolen moments, countless opportunities, deeply captivating friendships. I have a story to tell and I'm just crazy enough to share some of it here. I'm sure everyone, if she looks deep enough inside, has a story, but I guess I'm one of the few crazy enough to share it.       I'll look first to my later years because they're what I can actually remember. And I warn the reader because the story changes as time moves on--because we're so quick to romanticize the past and remember only the good, pretending as if the bad does not exist and never did-- maybe to make ourselves feel better about it and feel as if our time has not been wasted. I'll warn the reader because with each narrator, the story alters. I warn the reader because with time, the story alters. With time, the perception alters--bitterness or romanticism influence the story greatly, despite the narrator's attempts to simply recount the past. The truth, however, is that no one can objectively tell the past to someone who wasn't there, so no matter what I do, this story is not exactly what happened.      I guess an interesting place to dive in would by when I was twelve--in the seventh grade. I could start earlier because I remember further than that, but I'd rather start there. Those of you who knew me then know that was definitely a time of anxiety and just insanity for me and everyone around us in our little Team A--Team A was the Orchestra team, B for Band, and C for Chorus. Orchestra doesn't start with A, but I guess it's just that band and chorus work so perfectly and alphabetical is best, starting with B would be dumb. Then, of course, they mixed the General Music kids in each of the teams evenly. Team A was dramatic, to say the least, well to say the very very least. It was crazy. We managed to turn everything into an epic drama concerning the fate of the world, and in some ways, things have changed very little, but in others, they are worlds apart.      So Team A--the "crew" I hung out with, well let's see you had me, Danielle, and Jimmy as the best of friends, then our lunch table of Zoie, Brittany, Tahoorah, Rebecca, and our constant visitors of Ryan and Kim. Our lunch table was drama central and I can barely remember one week when we were all talking. Things have definitely changed. Danielle, Jimmy, and I used to be so close--it'd probably have made most of you vomit had you known us. There wasn't a day when we didn't all talk on the oh-s0-popular three-way calling system, which we had just discovered on our phones. I would get home from school around three and the first thing I'd hear the moment I walked in off the bus would be the ringing of the phone and I'd know it was Danielle. That's how it always worked. Danielle'd call me, and then, later, we'd call Jimmy. It would be the strangest day ever if I didn't get the phone call. So, even when we fought, we'd call one another--I think because we neeeded the voices for comfort, and even when we'd fight, we'd try to make up because we'd have to sit near one another in orchestra--that all-important class--that foundation for everything that we were when you really look into it...without orchestra, we wouldn't be Team A and without Team A, I'd be a profoundly different person with fundamentally different friends.  Gosh...picking up the violin wasn't a huge deal until Middle School--Linwood's system made your music choice a part of you through separation, then isolation of schedules. It was taboo to talk to kids in Band and Chorus--and hell, that stayed with us to high school.       Orchestra--wow--that class was haha crazy. That's the only word I can come up with to describe it. It was me, Danielle, Jimmy, Zoie, Merin, Brittany, Taylor--remember Taylor guys??, Pratik, Rebecca, AB later on, Salma, Kevin who was very haha different to say the least then, Devjoy, and just everyone. Mr. Schiavone was at the helm, driving us to play these songs with "impossible" rhythms and notes that we now laugh at in remembering. "Don't Cry for Me Argentina"--I hated that song, that and "Air on the G String"--oh my God...horrible. We couldn't play them, no matter what we did or how much practicing, well maybe if we had actually practiced back then...haha we used to just BS those Practice Sheets--those mandatory two hours per week sheets we'd lie on and have our parents sign, knowing we hadn't taken the instruments home all week--all month for that matter. So yes, these terrible songs mixed with the constant drama and the diva impressions people had about the First versus Second Violins and the constant screaming of Mr. Schiavone--they made up our days. Everything would essentially start and end in that class--fights, issues, conversations, friendships.       So with orchestra being such a formative class, and then our plunge into high school--people dropped the instruments. We lost Pratik and Zoie and Jimmy and Merin and Taylor for another reason, and more--and if you think about it, in losing them in Orchestra, we lost them in our conversations, outings, friendships, and lives. We just lost them. Of course, some of these friendships survived--it wasn't the be all and end all, but it was strong enough to severely weaken them.       Gosh...the things we did in seventh grade--there is no way I could actually end this blog with just seventh grade if I went into it all. We were just insane. Let me just say that we hurt and loved and felt more deeply than I think ever I have and ever I will. Constant puppy love and furious attacks on one another, along with the entertainment provided by my utter lack of poise and balance. I fell down, I rolled down, I tumbled, I slid--I just embarassed myself day after day and I guess that's why those times are "akward youth." But, the importance is that I survived it all--not without a couple of scratches of course, but alive and better for it.       Peer mediation--haha Jimmy, Rebecca, and I helped so many other people figure out their problems and solve them, but we couldn't make heads or tails of our own--well not so much Rebecca for she always was the logical, calm one. When we ended up there as a huge group--think about it, guys--it was sad. We cried over "she told everyone that I tripped out the doorway and the teachers were playing soccer with me," and just stupid things like that.       That was truly "the best of times, the worst of times." Guys, I'm going to end this with just a light touch upon the past at age twelve. I'm not going to even attempt to explain it all, because I could write a novel of War and Peace length with just seventh grade antics. I hope you remember always because Orchestra--it truly is our root. Whether you play in the future or not, stop and think. Without that class, chances are that we wouldn't have each other. Without being yelled at all the time by "Tomato" as we used to refer to him, we would have sucked even more. Without one another to get through those insane times, we'd all be in clinics or undergoing some intense therapy.       Whether you remember the things we said to one another, the good times, the bad times, the fights, the kisses, the love, the hugs, the dances, the making up, the breaking up, the classes, the letters--remember us. Remember that we had one another then, and that in the future, we have the memory of one another and that is the strongest thing you can have of someone--and that like it or not, you're in each other's hearts--you're in my heart, and perhaps, that's why I can't forget that phone number even though we've had a horrible falling out--perhaps that's why I'll never forget "The Queen Bee"--maybe that's why I'll always play the violin no matter how much I complain about it--maybe that's why we have one another--perhaps that's the reason I'll never be able to ride a feras wheel wihout smelling something or hear KC and JoJo without laughing--maybe that's why everything.       You can trace most of it back to Orchestra. So, maybe as much as we feel we've been tortured by our conductors since third grade and the age of eight--we loved every moment of orchestra. We needed every moment. We were meant the be the "fiddlers or the stringers" as they said. We were meant to be Team A and help to form one another.       And perhaps this is why I couldn't sleep before--because I know that in sixteen years, I made some friendships that I have tried to let go of--with people I've tried to ignore and forget--but in the back of my mind--in the back of my heart, they remain.  And just maybe this act of clarity comes with old age--17 years, and still going strong, so I say if my first 16 have been this crazy, and this long entry barely touched on just one of them--I have a story that just might be a tad bit unique.

       Hmm....I don't really have much to say, but I find it odd that my last post was in July. It's August, so I figured I'd update. I guess I have something interesting enough to say, and if not, then, discontinue reading right about now.       So I've hung out with some cool people, had a sleepover, saw some movies, ate some dinners. Fun times. Unfortunately, however, I haven't done enough of my summer work as in reading and writing essays and my math work. I haven't looked into college applications and early applications like I should have, but I have had a blast this summer. One thing that's certain is that I will never forget Summer '04--the people I met, the things I did, and my overall experiences.     So I guess I'll get to that work, but it's so hard when just about every moment has been planned out for me prior to my realizing I had a ton of work that needed to be done over this summer too.  For now, I'll have to deal with it later.       What else? Well, people have already brought up Senior Prom. I just said wow...school has not even started yet. I don't want to even think about that right now, and I doubt I'll want to think about it when it comes up.        I've been thinking a little lately though. This is going to sound absolutely horrible, but my major question is--when you look around at people, and they're just average, as in they're smart, they're nice, they're pretty, they're sweet--why is it that these people seem to find romance so easily? It's not as if they're much prettier, smarter, more interesting, or more popular than you are, but they find romance without all the restrictions and obstacles you do. They find romance all the time, and they're never single for more than a week or two. This is going to sound selfish and mean, but it's not as if they're better than you in any way that you can see. They're your friends and all, but they're not that amazing. Yet, they have relationships galore as if they're especially great--and they're just not.       That sounds bad, but it's what I've been thinking about.  I definitely don't consider myself stupid, unpopular, ugly, or lacking in talent--so why is it that I have so many issues with the opposite sex? I'm about to be seventeen, and let's just say that aside from this summer, my romantic life has been, well-- sad.       So, I'm sorry, but what the hell? Do guys honestly want a bimbo without an opinion?       If that's what they want, I'll be single for life. I'm sorry, but I"ll never give them that, and I'll never change. So is it that I'm intimidating? Is it that I don't give guys a chance, as has been previously suggested? Is it that I'm  repulsive in some way? Or...is it that I scare guys with my "air of confidence and security" like some have proposed?       All of these questions lead to simply more questions, so basically, what am I supposed to do? People asked me about which guys I like or could even see myself developping feelings for in our school, and sadly, I couldn't think of one "acceptable" guy--maybe one or two, but still. That's sad. Am I that picky? I don't mean to be that picky, but I won't settle for someone dumb or disinterested or uninterested in academics. I won't settle for someone without anything he excels in besides schoolwork either--well no, I just won't settle for a completely boring, unintelligent guy. He has to be sweet and a great listener. He has to be understanding and helpful and just nice in general. I just refuse to settle, because I know what I deserve.       And I know guys like this must exist. I met a few this summer, but why is it that North Brunswick has none? Is it something in the water? Why are there so few that I seem to know even across the country? Is that the rare type or is it that I just don't see it in people? Maybe I'm too picky, but maybe not. Who knows? Not me...that's the problem.      Well, I guess I"m done. But I'm not satisfied. I just wanted to get some thoughts out, but this hasn't helped much. Maybe I won't even publish this. I don't know.       Where is my match? Isn't everyone supposed to find, if not his or her match--someone he or she can relate to in a romantic way--during adolescence usually in school?       For now, I say...I guess not.
