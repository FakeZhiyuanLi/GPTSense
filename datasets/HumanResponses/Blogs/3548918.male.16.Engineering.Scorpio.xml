      Woo hooo Just had our last training. We're still suffering with people not doing things right. For one so many were absent. Can't believe Guozheng ponned training to play soccer. Jerk. Then I was rowing alone coz we had one short for the left side, so i had the whole partition to myself. Matthew isn't bending low enough. Allen keeps saying "Sex, sex, sex , sex" with every stroke and keeps us all laughing and in a good mood.   The coach Ah Hee, was in the national team. Wha... such a pondan was in the national team. Power la. He keeps saying, shift ur butt once in a while or you'll get "presents". And the look on his face when he says it ah. Wha lan eh.... Scary man. Sounds gay.  Then it started raining and the sea was rolling. Lightning etc. So we went under the bridge and waited side by side with the girls team. Then our coach kept embarrasing us by telling the girls we couldn't concentrate because their boat was bobbing up and down right next to ours. I mean come on la... If kairavi was sitting in the next boat fully drenched then maybe i wouldn't be able to concentrate but those girls are like... nvm.... they're lame la... but they're fun to be with  So we did all kinds of things under the bridge... Then we silently started rowing so that the edge of the boat, where the coach Ah Hee was sitting was stuck out in the rain. hahaha damn funny......  Then i took endurox as usual. The damn thing works man. No muscle aches at all later. Splendid. Bought a cap and a watch later in the evening. The watch i needed for the stopwatch for training... Timing laps and stuff  Then the problem was how the hell to get home  We were dressed in shorts, slippers and our singlets (official jerseys). So we walked, shivering in the thunderstorm, our bags getting drenched, to national stadium and after a hot shower that felt good, it was back to the cold. Freezing la. Waited at the bus stop so long for the stupid 16. Then took it to this hawker centre before park mall and bought two steaming paos, two not so nice pratas and a packet of wanton noodles. Went home. Great nobody home. Went in. Luckily they had closed all the windows and gone so the place was kind of warm. Felt lovely, warm inside, rain outside.  Ate hungrily and fell asleep and poor little animesh was locked outside his house and didn't even say so, just said want to go eat? and i said no i'm going to sleep now... and i fell asleep.  woke up, started reading chem, then mum said let's go walk. So basically, you see, when is the blooody time to study? Nvm man, this is what JC is all about. As cliched as it sounds, i'll strike a balance soon.  Now i'm trying to talk to kairavi as much as i can, but too many people online on her side and mine and her comp's getting slow she says...  Brilliant.   Got this Adidas watch that was for 100+ for only 69 coz of great singapore sale, at city chain... cool. Totally suited for sports. Split lap and 100 lap memory and what nots, good for kayak marathons and 2.4...  I'll sign of here..... Too tired to go on.... Haiz....  Good Night  "Good Thoughts, Good Words and Good Deeds"

        WHAT DAD SAID  So i woke up, asked for the paper and went staight to commentary and analysis and the forum at the back of the main section which is pretty useful for GP. Am i stupid? My GP common test is over....   Then i had hardly read two lines when he started. "Bodybuilding is 40 percent of your priority, canoeing is another 40 percent and only 20 percent is studies. It's time you stop sidetracking into sports and *ahem* and start studying seriously now because nobody falls in love for love anymore or at least nobody stays that way. If you don't have money, game over. So decide whether you want to enjoy with girls now, and fuck up the rest of your life, or put in hard work now, and enjoy the rest of your life. Save money, for heaven's sake save money. Whatever you get in your hand, put away 10 percent. For example that day, you mother and i went to buy a sofa. She had fixed in her head that she wants to spend a thousand dollars on it. Someone offered us a really nice one for 400 and then her face became so small, and after that she went and spent on another sofa so now we will have three pieces. She said "mane sofa ni uppar suvuch". Sofas are not for sleeping, they are for sitting, but then you love the person so much so then how to argue? Fuck it then, buy, buy, buy, buy the bloody sofa. Real life example, your mother studied more than me and now she has a job with saturday and sunday off and i don't. The amount of passion with which you go for canoeing, put into studies. These 4-5 years are for studying. You don't study, ur dead. You've come all the way to raffles junior college, how will it look if you graduate with Cs and Ds? All the effort in the years before this, for what? If you love some girl so much, and want to spend the rest of your life with her, you have to feed her right? Or do you intend to live on love and fresh air and make her starve as well? Think Zephyr think. Don't screw up your life...." And he went on.  When he finally saw enlightenment on my face, or maybe he didn't, because i look like a blur fuck all the time, he softened his voice and said bye, coz he was going out somewhere.  Saw laws of attraction yesterday. Beautiful, and i'm not only referring to the storyline there ;)  Dragon Boat training tomorrow, competition is on sunday. The thing about dragon boat and kayaking is, it's kinda hard for supporters to make out who's who on the open sea... Nvm, guess we'll just rely on our inner selves for support.  Well, it hasn't even been an hour since i woke up, and it's 10.50 now, and i'm starting studying at eleven so see ya.  "If you waste time, time will waste you"

        Kayaking  I tried K2 today. Yeah baby. First i and ruiyang tried to get into the boat, the moment we left shore, we capzized. Yay. Lucky Ruiyang had the foresight that both of us were too unstable so we had to split up and find more stable people. I got hold of eugene. But we still capped and capped and the girls were standing on shore laughing at us because i and eugene were the only two guys left on shore. Nice people, they all came to help. We all had a good laugh as i and eugene proceeded to cap like 10 more times without being seaborn. Haha. Then the coach was observing so he asked us each to go with a girl since they're more stable and have been training longer than us. Eugene went with Yong Hui and i got Esther ( i think ). She was good, trained properly and all so in ten seconds we were off. And at what speed... K2s are really fast. She was doing all the balancing and bracing whilst i was twisting and turning at the back. But we managed like 5 rounds without capping even once so i got arrogant i guess and asked eugene whether he was ready for us to do together. He said ok, and we were capping again miserably near shore. Sheesh....  Then See Hong and Joshua came and Joshua partnered Eugene and I partnered See Hong... See Hong, what a man. So stable, so strong and i could match him. I was the back man by the way, he was in front. So we were an awesome team, not one cap. Until, i felt like drinking gatorade so i put my paddle down and started drinking. The sour taste was a sharp contrast to the seawater and then i shook a bit, making everything unstable, but we were gathering speed, and we could feel each other's strokes getting stronger and faster, and we continues that way till we were sprinting. Then i did a particularly hard stroke on the left, making the boat flip left, and as a natural reaction we both leaned right to counterbalance it but we leant too much and the boat flipped right and next thing we knew i was looking some fish in the eyes... Haha..... Then we swam to shore with the boat... Then i partnered TQ.... Coz See Hong's ass was hurting because of too many blisters.   Was the most fun training ever..... I love canoeing. And guess what? I got Philip's paddle, and it turned out fine, and he agreed to sell it for 175 175!!!!!!!!!! can you believe it? only 175? i told him ill pay 200. then he seemed damn happy. It's like almost brand new. The first user was the J3 secretary, then philip, the J2 and soon it's gonna be me and for such a new paddle, i'm only paying 200, while ruiyang is gonna get aaron's which has passed through 3 pairs of hands before ruiyang, and he's paying 250!!! hahaha  i got a good offer..... yay! i'm gonna decorate it really nicely.   one day i'll take kairavi kayaking, and make her cap on purpose thousands of times.  yesterday i made 2 exceptionally long and lovely phone calls, one to my darling and the other to my sweetheart. the first one was 47 minutes and the next was 1 hour and 56 minutes 48 seconds. Dad's gonna kill me i know.... Nvm, i'll pay for those calls.....  Going to watch Laws of Attraction with my mom and her friend now, it's like seven now, just got back from training and she calls on my way home and says i've booked your ticket, and then she expects me to study. i mean what kind of logic is that? c'mon la mom.  haizzz.... better go change now if i'm gonna be on time for the show at 8....  life is beautiful.....  kairavi is so mature, i feel all overwhelmed... i feel like a little kid. i am, i guess. signing of here.  "study hard, train loyally and love faithfully"

      Woke up at 5.45 went for training... had endurox with milk before training and endurox with water after training. hardly helped. i'm like shagged like shagged silly. I bet even sex doesn't get ya so tired...  Yet to get a paddle from a J2. Michael got through first round on Singapore Idol. Wooooooohoooooooooooo. Congrats to raffles canoeists. Keep flying.  Wonder when i' officially starting studying for the remaining three weeks. Supposed to be now, but too shagged after training. Think i'll go sleep now. Mum gave me a big, well balanced lunch. I had root beer, khichdi, dhai curry(if thaT'S HOW U SPELL IT), chicken kurma, onions and pappads. Now that's what i call food... after training.  Almost missed my bus stop while thinking about kairavi... Charming.  Pictured myself bashing manik up... That felt good. I'll do it someday.  Dragon Boat Tournament on sunday, the thriteenth. Harry Potter on channel 5 today  Good Night. I'm going to plop onto my bed now...  ah one more thing, i love kairavi and can't stop thinking about her.  "for honour, for pride and glory, for raffles"

      haha finally got a blog....  going out with her for our 1st movie date next week .... wooooohoooooooooooooooo  gosh i love her .... everytime i see her, i just want to kiss her and kiss her and kiss her and kiss her....  moving on to more interesting news.    Canoeing   Had to skip two trainings because of my brother's religious ceremony, it's called a navjote, where the kid is initiated into the religion. What an honour, that i performed it. I'm a priest by the way. The audience of like 280 told me i prayed spectacularly, spoke spectacularly for the speech, looked awesome, the food was fabulous, and we danced till 11.30 after the oldies all left. My RI/RJ indian gang, RI/VJ hunks and chicks and the DJs were like saying, ur supposed to be going home, in between songs.  Nischal and Janani sang brilliantly, i'm proud of them. Sarnpal Singh graced the occasion with his jolly presence as well, and i was over the moon when i was dancing with her.....  Animesh came too... Pramit didn't. Idiot. But Animesh didn't dance ... boring la  I didn't get to eat dessert. Not FAIR!!! Hmph.  Haven't had such a brilliant party in years. Couldn't call my classmates coz there were already too many people. If i called everyone i knew, which is like over a thousand people, my dad would have died paying the bill which was 41 people per head and that's only counting my friends....  Ahhh, good times..... let's see if i bump into nadia and her friends on friday ...  hahahaha They'll be left ogling at Kairavi...    Studies  studies, what's that? fuck.... i'm supposed to start today..... and i'm creating a blog at 1.30. what the fuck!!!  perhaps i should learn from kairavi. she studies early in the morning from like 5 to 11. brilliant. yesterday i was telling her how i'm going to keep her fit for the rest of her life and not let her get fat like the rest of the indian women i've seen, except a few...  i better finish up my breakfast now. just had an omellette. yes that's how pathetic my will power to study is..... it's a miracle i got into RJ really  must have been my parents prayers  how i got 7 points i dunno  that's enough for today i guess......  oh ya and i just found out that someone in the class has a crush on me... now that doesn't happen very often... guess i'm just lucky...   i'm turning out to be a very fortunate human being.... thanks to god  nadia is too frisky.... learn to calm down a bit nadia, calm down and relax. perhaps go take a walk on the morning. kairavi tells me it can be very relaxing....  see y'all  i still want to get my hands on butterbeer.... the creator would make a fortune....  "all that is gold, does not glitter"
