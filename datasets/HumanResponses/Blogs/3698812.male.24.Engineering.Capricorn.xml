      Well it's really been a long time ! And time has really stretched for me. It's like holding the two ends of a thoroughly chewed, tastelessly bitter remnants of a chewing gum which little kids generally pull out into long strands.   All of this started with my friend Anand alias Yeda getting a GMAIL account. And that bugger actually had the guts to mail me from his GMAIL account !!! Well that was it ! How dare he ? I visualised slowly strangling him with my own hands (My idea of a painful death). hi ha ha.... but it did not do any good for me. Next i imagined shooting him in his stomach with a dum-dum bullet (aarrgh... my idea of an even more painful death).... that did not do any good either. Then i thought of tying his hands up, fixing a loud headphone to his ears and then blast Britney Spears' - "Hit me baby one more time" and Backstreet Boys' - "I want it that way", both remixed the Desi way by our very own DJ Aqueel, interspaced with interim wails of "Kaanta Laga" (eeeeks,.. my idea of the most painful death on earth). Called him up, told him, he fainted !  Serves him right !  Thus began the quest for a GMAIL account of my own. Needless to say the moment i logged on to the internet i realised that i am horribly late... at least by three to four months.... and i'm horribly low on funds.... at least by 60 dollars (That's the minimum price of a GMAIL Invite on EBay).   Somebody suggested FreeGMAILInvites. That site requires u to roll, dice to be more precise, and if you get four straight in a row (a chance of 1 in 1296) you get an invite. Highly desperate for an invite i started rolling, dice, and in the middle of the 13th roll they changed the rules to getting five straight sixes (a chance of 1 in 7776). Drat ! (Now i know why they say 13 is unlucky !).   Cursing myself in the choiciest French expletives I know (Note that the list is limited to "Al Kutto" and "Al Kamino" only...) I headed for the forums on the net again.  Someone suggested Orkut. But then even that needed an invite to get in, phew ! I was just wondering how to get out of this recursive cycle of invites when Shreerang popped up as my fairy Godfather and enlightened me with an invite. Highly excited at what seemed my passport to an invite, i treated him to a fag at the shop near the office main-gate.  But things at Orkut had a different story to tell. It seemed the whole damned world was queued up for an invite before me and some seemed so desperate that i felt like personally consoling them, buy them a beer and then kindly suggest that they go see a nice psychiatrist.  Dejected and thoroughly concerned about the misery of my fellow earthlings I thought of starting a Counselling center.... and then, out of the blue it happened....   Had logged on to my comp one fine morning at work and there it was. A shiny new invite in my mailbox (Thanks to Carey Drake and Stevens Hollingsworth @  urlLink Drakeshangout ). That made my day !   Called up Yeda and Spammed him from my GMAIL Account. (They say elephants do not forget... though i do not resemble an elephant in even the remotest way.... I guess i'd made my point... )   I bragged about it all day to my colleagues at work who were convinced that i've gone loco (not that they think i'm sane anyway.....) and my boss thought that this extreme expression of happiness was the sign of impending doom for  the poor souls who work around me !  Thus ended my quest for GMAIL. Patiently waiting for Invits so that i can do my own save-the-world-from-going-berserk thingie. Just post a comment if u want a GMAIL or an ORKUT and i'll start doling out as soon as i get them......  PS: UD is going Home. (He says "Home is where the HEART is..."). I know better....  And Monsieur Oscar Wilde, thou art welcome....

      As a five year old i used to ask my mom why everyone has to work ? Nineteen years thence i ask myself the same question !  Well i'm generally not philosophical but questions like these really make me sad. Because questions like these compell me to think and that is definitely the last thought in my head right now. Coz if you think u use ur brain (will a time come when i'll actually use up my brain ??? i mean whatever little i've left of it ??? or do i have any left ???) see ? thinking is just one recursive process. And i'm sad. Just the thought that i think i've no brains left makes me feel like a jellyfish !   My co-worker tells me even jellyfishes have brains.... What about carrots ? Do they too ??? NO ??? Good ! Not so bad after all.... coulda been worse....  I wake up at 8:00 am every morning and look at my boring face staring at me with a bored look on it, through the mirror. Thoroughly disgusted at the look it gives me i try to get some solace in the bathroom, sitting on the comode looking at the pretty faces in the Pune Times interspaced with recollections of the face in the mirror i saw a coupla minutes back... greatly helps in bowel movement. Done with my bath and all (I love water as much as a fish loves living out of it.) i try to get on something that'll make me look decent. (Please note the ommitance of the word "PRESENTABLE". A monkey with fancy clothes can look "decent" but NOT "presentable"). After a 15 minute fight, i give up.... monkeys with fancy clothes on can still look presentable.....  I get on my bike and start on the pre-programmed route to Office. Reach office, boot my comp (literally) (Monkeys can look decent but they can't boot a comp... no way... they cannot even spell one.... ask them !) and i'm set for the day's work or the lack of it....(which busy person in this world will write a blog from office ? Please Note: The keyword is BUSY.) Sleepwalk the whole day between faxes, phones, memos, emails and incomprehensible commands of my boss.... wake up at 12:30 for the lunch. Not that it is great but it just provides a break from the drag... again sleepwalk the rest of the day between faxes, phones, memos, emails and incomprehensible commands of my boss.... wake up again at 5:00 for a prolonged snack break after which looking for a chance to escape becomes an obsession. Though u only have to work 9 to 6, unofficially it's even more.....  At last having made my escape from Alcatraz i start on my pre-programmed way back, tired and zapped !  Back home, try to get rid of my exoskeleton, listen to "Sad but True" on my Cd Player, graduate to Radio Mirchi (Pardesiya et al....), hog dinner and my system is ready for it's systemic shutdown at 10:00 pm.   Wake up next day and look at the same bored face in the mirror again....  And yes.... in case you've still not found the answer to the question posed in line one, keep searching....   i still am.....

      Well i think i should start off with a warning in good earnest : "This Blog can affect your mental health. Read it at your own risk..."  People say that i'm a bit "Beeeeped" in the head, and i beleive them.... why ? because they know and i know they know. basically i have this respect for people who know and everyone seems to know other than me !  You know what ? I owe a lot of people their sanity. People who were perfectly normal at one point in their life till their luck ran out and they were unfortunate enough to meet me.... Well that's what cost them a piece of their head or maybe their entire head !  So i decided to use my powers for the betterment of the world... i'd decided to do a "Save-The-World" thingie and host this blog... after all who needs their head anyway in this world ?  I lost mine long back !!!!
