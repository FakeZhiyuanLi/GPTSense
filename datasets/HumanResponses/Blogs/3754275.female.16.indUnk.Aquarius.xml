      Last night Dana and I went to see Scooby Doo 2 at the dollar theater because we're poor haha.  Well, I have some money but it's money I got from working and I need to save it up..yea like that's going to happen hehe.  So today I'm just sittin around all day and hopefully driving for a bit tonight.  Yea around a parking lot...maybe mooter will let me drive on a REAL road, scary thought I know.  So tomorrow I'm babysitting along with Thursday.  ALL DAY.  I get so annoyed with them, well not Tara, she's cute and leaves me alone a lot.  But no Emily's the bitchiest 10 yr old I know haha.  She's always walking around yelling at everyone, including me.  Then on Friday me and Amy are going to Waldameer!  Oh yea!! We're excited!  hahahaha We still aren't sure why we are going, we asked her 6 yr old brother what we should do, and he said go to Waldameer so that's where we are going! I hope the weathers nice.  This weather kind of sucks, it's been rainy and dreary..meh.  It's a nice day today though.  But it's not very warm.  Oh well, July's coming soon so it should warm up!    .>*.Tons of Love.*   It's a beautiful day not a cloud in sight so I guess I'm doin' alright

      Hmm, well I guess each day has become just another day sort of.  I'm a little bit on the sad side, because I talked to Joshua earlier and he said his mom had deemed it "Taking down posters day".  That made me realize he really is moving soon.  I haven't been doing too much lately.  My dads in Buffalo so I haven't had to work or anything.  Our computers being a bit of a...well I'm not too sure, what can you call a computer who you think may have lost its way at life? haha, our virus protection pretty much just shut down and we can't reinstall it so I'm thinkin it may not be a good idea to be online haha.  Wouldn't you hate to be a computer?  You'd be clicked on all day, and when you went too slow opening something your user would get mad and start screaming at you, kicking you, slamming on the keyboard, clicking the mouse at a million miles an hour confusing you even more.  So maybe my computer is having issues it just needs to work out (even though it's not alive so it can't really think).  Who knows?  So I have spent 7 hours trying to fix the computer, can't we just start it over and make it happy?  Maybe it'd be more willing to work.  I think I'm going to plead insanity right now because who actually writes an entry about her computer, and talks about it like it's a living thing?  I guess me.  Well, hmmm, I'm hopefully going driving when my mom gets home, I think I'm going to be a really bad driver because I forget to use the breaks around the turns and I've already driven over potholes lol.  Whoops.  But for now, I'm off to go find something to fill my tummy!

      I got my permit today! Yay for Kate!  Little things excite me nowadays.  Well today I decided this is going to be my new beginning.  No more teenage drama, no more saying I'm ugly, no more sitting here feeling alone and complaining about it.  I just kind of woke up this morning and realized I really shouldn't be lonely just because I don't have a boyfriend.  Or sit here upset because someone I like isn't sure if he likes me.  No more dealing with guys playing games with me.  I'm done with it.  This is honestly no way to live my life.  Worrying about if I'm pretty and trying to get guys to like me.  No more sitting here saying no guy will ever like me more than a friend.  I know one day I will meet someone, probably not today, probably not tomorrow, or in a month, but I'm not going to be alone until I'm 30.  I'm just going to be myself from now on, no more trying to impress people, no more asking people if I look ok.  No more.  I am me and I am not going to try to look pretty everyday so guys will like me.  No more being concerned about what I'm going to wear when I see someone.  Where is that getting me?  Nowhere, just making me not feel good enough.  And as for if guys want to play games with me.  That's fine with me, but I know how it goes, and I'm not going to like a guy who walks in and out as he pleases.  It's like my aunt told me, she was really concerned about how she dressed, what she was doing on Fridays and Saturdays, and if guys liked her, in highschool.  She said she doesn't even talk to her friends from high school or college anymore.  She wishes she spent a little less time on guy drama and had more fun in life.  She would say she loved someone, and she cried and cried when he would play games with her.  And a year later when all was said and done, she couldn't believed she wasted a year on a stupid guy who could never make up his mind.  I have two years left of high school and I'm going to have fun, and sure maybe I will meet someone special along the way.  This may not have been the best way to start off my new blog, but I'm really overall becoming happier.  This is me, take me as I am.

      How is everyone?  Oh I'm doing just dandy if you were wondering.  Haven't been up to a ton lately.  Jessica slept over last night which was cool of course.  We hung out and roamed the streets of Millcreek.  Aren't we cool?  I got some sad news yesterday.  Amy's best friend Gwyn, and my good friend, is moving to Gettysburgh.  Meh.  Amy and her have been best friends forever, and Amy was crying.  She's really sad but she's being a good sport.  She said that she knows crying isn't going to make her stay and being sad isn't either, so she's going to have as much fun hanging out with her before she leaves as possible. I guess that's a good outlook on things.  Amy's like that thought, she really doesn't let much get her down.  She's always so happy.  Hmmm.  I saw Katie at the mall yesterday!!  That was awesome!  I'm kinda sad cause we haven't been hanging out much at all.  It was funny she told me she was going to the mall with Nanci, and like 5 mins after she said that Amy called me and asked if I wanted to go to the mall.  Nanci and Josh were there hanging out with Katie.  Then I saw Mike.  He completely caught me off guard and then he like came up and gave me a hug.  I didn't real have much to say, but Amy helped me out on that one.  She's really quiet but not shy at all.  She'll go right up to people and start talking to them thinking nothing of it.  Sometimes I feel awkward, but I haven't seen him in a while, and me and Amy talked to him for a few minutes then we had to leave.  I guess I thought I'd feel sad if I saw him again.  Well I didn't feel sad at all, to tell you the truth, it just felt like I was talkin to an old friend and that's all we ever were.  heh.  But I have realized that everytime I go somewhere.  Guys repel away from me.  Like same sided magnets ha.  On the other hand I'm upset with the male species, namely...Keith.  Ok ok, so maybe I shouldn't be worried I mean I wasn't the one who liked him.  But the nerve of him to treat my Katie like that.  She doesn't deserve that and I wish it was me he did that to cause she's been sad too much.  Sometimes I feel like it's my fault and I don't know why.  But I know she'll find someone soon.  I know it.  I just do.     Do you ever feel like everything is changing and you aren't changing with it.  Like your friends are leaving you behind?  Like they have better friends then you to hang out with?  You are their old friends, and the newer ones are better than you?  Like your old friends just aren't your friends anymore?  You find yourself wondering what they say about you when your not looking?  Do you ever feel like you don't trust your close friends anymore?  Have you ever thought everything might just be based on lies?  Like none of these friendships are truely real?  You wonder if your close friends are telling you the whole story?  Is it possible for me to be writing this..and be trusting my friends at the same time?  You told me I don't know how much I mean to you.  You told me I was your friend and your friends were the only thing you haven't given up on.  You told me I meant more to you then I'd ever know.  You promised me if I ever needed anything you'd be here for me.  Well where were you when everything fell apart?  Where were you when I reached an all-time low and the floor still crumbled below me?  Where were you?  I doubt I mean much to you.  Actually.  I doubt I mean anything at all.

      Oh joyous!  Well I got up today at 12, it seems like I've been sleeping in later and later everyday.  I probably would've slept longer but my dad called saying he took my cell phone to cell one so they could transfew my number onto a new phone.  That is definately a plus because the antenna was cracked and I just need a new phone plain in simple because it goes in and out of service randomly, and on top of that my plan was expiring at then end of July.  Unfortuneatly, verizon doesn't have any good company plans (my dad bought 6 new phones and you get 2 free, and he only needs 7 so I get the 8th one) so we get to stick with sucky cell one again.  My new phone was supposed to be all ready at 6:00 today but guess that didn't happen, so my dads going to pick it up in the morning.  Ha, oh well, it's not like I ever get calls hahaha.  So yes the first half of my entry was about a stupid phone...wow...lol.  Anyways today I didn't do too much, I've been excersizing a lot in the last what three days haha, so I'm proud of myself, we'll see how long I last.  Then I cleaned upstairs, and tomorrow morning I'm going to run the vacccuum so its all pretty!  Tomorrow I'm doing nothing, oh joy.  And Friday I'm babysitting.  I feel weird, like something's not right but not wrong either.     When everything is goin' wrong Don't worry, it won't last for long Yeah, it's all gonna come around Don't go let it get you down You gotta keep on holding on    Up--up--up-- Can only go up from here Up--up--up--Up where the clouds gonna clear Up--up--up-- There's no way but up from here

      Jessica came over today and we dyed her hair!  It looks pretty nifty!  I didn't wear gloves though and the dye got under my fingernails and it burned so baddddd.  But besides that we had a good time.  We hung out pretty much all day which was really fun, cause we never really get to hang out anymore.  We managed to get dye all over the carpet and the walls which made my mom real happy.  My mom and I got into a big fight today so that was real cute.  Sorry you had to witness that Jess lol.  My mom tells me to clean up after myself, which I mean makes sense seeing as I'm the one making the mess.  So lately I've been extra careful about cleaning up, I've been cleaning my room without being told, etc.  Sounds like I'm lying huh?  But the thing is..I'm not, my moms always bitching so lately I've been humoring her.  Well today she told me to clean up the dishes.  So I'm like oh ok, I'll clean up my dishes.  So I clean them all up load them in the dishwasher.  My brothers are still sitting out from the morning.  My mom yelled at me for not cleaning up my brothers dishes!  I got really angry, then she started saying I don't do anything around the house and I have a bad tone of voice with her.  The regular speeches.  Then of course she tries to ground me, and I laughed at her because she claimes I'm grounded then she gets sick of me and ungrounds me so I'll leave the house.  So she freaked out!  So then one thing lead to another as poor Jessica watches.  Sorry again Jess.  So now my mom is refusing to talk to me.  Meh, I feel bad now.  But I think my mom and I need a break from eachother.  I tried locking myself in my room hahahaha, but I got bored.  Well, I suppose I'll be off for the night!

      I know something you don't know! hehehehe  Good afternoon to whoever reads this.  It is kind of a dreary day outside, but then again it is dreary erie.  I woke up about 10 mins ago when my Heather called.  I don't think I'm up to too much today.  Erica and I might hang out today.  We haven't seen eachother in forever!  She has been living with her dad for the past few months in girard so I haven't gotten to see her more than a few times.  Also, I've decided to start going on a diet and excersizing a lot more.  Who knows if I'll stick to it because I'm horrible with eating healthy foods, but I'm going to try!  I eat sooo much junk food and I really need to stop that.  I've gained about 15 lbs in the last 7 months.  I know I made a mistake 7 months ago, but at the time it was really the only choice I had.  Well the hard times are over, and this is a big decision for me.  I could take the risk and there is a 75% chance I'll fail.  Odds aren't good I know.  But this is something I need to do to make myself happy.  I haven't told anyone about how much my life has sucked for the past 7 months because the truth is, I didn't think anyone would care.  No one has any idea about what is really going on--well Lia sort of has an idea.  I'm not really comfortable at this point discussing this with anyone else.  I have an extremely hard time discussing it with Lia, so we've probably talked about it for 5 minutes total.  For right now..I'll keep this all too myself until I explode lol.

      HAHA me and Amy went to Waldameer today that was awesome lmao!  We had too much fun!  I'm not even gunna list all the funny things that happened haha!  Well, we saw Valerie working at one of the games so we went and talked to her for a half an hour which was cool.  Steve came over to talk to us, he was being a fag as usual, and we saw Angel!  I haven't seen Angel in almost a year, so I was really happy to see her.  I was a little upset about Steve but I'm not going to dwell on things that were said, they've been said and I'm just going to let it go.  I kind of made a realization today.  I definately have made a few..ok a lot of mistakes with past guys.  I would like to try things again, but ya know, it didn't work out for a reason.  I have changed a lot but I'm not going to waste my time trying to rekindle an old flame.  It's weird how some things in the past sting, and you want to drop the subject before it's brought up.  Well enough on that, no more complaining.  So me and Lia are going to go see Kenny Chesney August 22nd which should be a ton of fun!  I don't really like country, but I do like Kenny Chesney...and his music haha.  I miss Lia cause we haven't hung out or really talked in such a long time.  We used to talk every night, but now that it is summer we're lucky if we talk for more than 10 minutes each week.  I've been in a very weird mood lately and I'm not sure what's triggering it.   Think of all the times you've once had Write them in a letter that says goodbye

      Hmm, so lately I have been doing quite well.  Yes, indeed I am a bit on the alone side, but what are ya gunna do?  Hedda's finally back from Florida!!  She's beein gone for a month and I haven't seen her.  We weren't on great terms before she left, but I am soooo happy we're friends again after tying the bitter ends.  So I went to her house around 6 yesterday and her mom took me home at 11.  Her mom was test driving a Spider, so she let me drive which was fun.  Then we drove around and a bunch of guys were honking because the top was down.  Her mom is so cool though she found it awesome when the guys pulled up next to the car haha!  She was like "Kate when you get your license, if it's ok with your mom I'll let you drive it whenever you and Heather go somewhere."  I was like wow...she trusts me more than my mom hahaha.  Then we went back to her house and went swimming.  Today, I went over to her house for a little while again, we walked down to the beach (which is in her backyard) and then we went tanning.  Then my mom picked me up from Hedda's and we went to my aunts house.  Tomorrow of course I'm hanging out with Amy which will be pretty fun cause I haven't seen her since school let out.  I hope me and Katie hang out soon..she's been really upset lately, I hope I've been helping her, sometimes I think I relate to my problems or bring my problems up too much, which I shouldn't cause I guess I don't have anything to complain about.  I guess Katie was right though, being emotionless is kind of frustrating.  Sometimes it's easier to feel sad or happy rather than nothing at all.  Well maybe I'm just used to it by now.  Hedda and I talked about how sometimes we feel lonely, but eventually we'll both find guys.  The truth is I probably won't find the "right guy" for a long time, but I guess if you don't over analyze it, waiting isn't that bad, so I'll wait!
