       urlLink commercialappeal.com - Memphis, TN: Local :      'Sambo' - Come again? Germantown alderman apologizes if he said that      By Cindy Wolff  Contact  July 24, 2004  It�s not a word you expect to hear in a meeting of government officials talking about a library.  But Tuesday evening, Germantown officials were discussing their book collection and how it should better cater to people who live there.&nbsp;  As the aldermen discussed their library�s holdings, Alderman John Drinnon uttered the word 'Sambo.'   It was unclear whether he meant the controversial book 'The Story of Little Black Sambo,' written in 1899 by Helen Bannerman, or whether his remark was less specific.  Officials at the meeting recall Drinnon making a racially insensitive comment. No one recalls the specific quote, only that 'Sambo' or 'Little Black Sambo' was used."  &nbsp;

       urlLink Radio Iowa   I read a story the other day about iPods getting real popular because radio listeners want to hear music and not useless banter or commercials. The same can be said for radio news, much of which is boring crap no one cares about (like massive coverage of political conventions).   The conventions are nothing more than staged commercials for the party's. I covered the GOP convention in Houston in 1992. I thought they were staged back then, but it has gotten worse. The only thing worse is staged radio reports.

       urlLink USATODAY.com - Woman charged in alleged 9/11 scam :  ROCKFORD, Mich. (AP) � A woman who collected more than $70,000 from the Red Cross after claiming her still-living husband died in the Sept. 11 attacks has been accused of fraud, authorities said.    The scam fell apart when Donna Miller's husband walked in while a detective was interviewing her at home, authorities said.  Miller, 49, of Sparta, was charged Thursday with three felony counts of false pretense and released on $10,000 bond. Besides a possible prison term, she could face restitution costs if convicted.  Kent County Sheriff's Detective Steve Moon said Miller told officials at the American Red Cross September 11 Recovery Program that her husband, Michael, died when the World Trade Center towers collapsed on Sept. 11, 2001.  Donna Miller made the claim during the frantic days following the terrorist attacks and collected eight checks over 10 months, starting in November 2001, Moon said.  Red Cross officials contacted the sheriff's department after she was unable to provide documentation of her husband's death.  Moon said he was questioning Miller at her home about her supposedly dead husband when the man walked in.     There is no indication Michael Miller participated in the scam and he will not be charged, the detective said. "     Really? Where did she say the money was coming from?

What had been a mellow evening at Wente Vineyards, with the crowd even serenading her with 'Happy Birthday' at one point, turned into a rush for the exits by some fans angry by her encore tribute to filmmaker Michael Moore.  'She just had to do it,' one fan steamed as he headed for the parking lot. 'It was good until the end,' another yelled to TV crews waiting outside the concert.  'She's getting out of line; it's ridiculous,' said Cindy Williams of Livermore, as she left during the last song of the evening.  Ronstadt's encore dedication of the song 'Desperado' to Moore, the controversial maker of 'Fahrenheit 9/11' who she described Thursday as 'a great American patriot,' got her booted from a Las Vegas casino Saturday and drew cheers, some boos, and a few 'traitor' yells from the Livermore crowd.  Until that last song, the concert had been an evening of good music and happy fans."

But the people who got his joke weren't laughing.&nbsp;  SNOHOMISH COUNTY - Michael Syravong has a very fast car and he wanted his Toyota Supra to have a suped up name.  So, on his license plate application he wrote GOT MILF. And he got it.  'Yeah I just thought it sounded funny,' said Syravong. 'Like 'Got Milk' and the term MILF was getting popular so - GOTMILF, I really didn't think about it.'  To be honest, he had thought about it and it had nothing to do with Got Milk.  It had everything to do with lingo from the movie American Pie. It is, in the most delicate of descriptions, a newly coined noun: a lustful term of endearment, he admits, for someone's mom.  'MILF is an attractive mother,' he said.  But in the nearly two years he had the plate on his car at least two mothers didn't find it attractive.  Emails of disgust rolled into the Department of Licensing. The women wrote that they found it offensive and not humorous at all. After months of review the plate was officially canceled.  'Yeah, I was a bit surprised, shocked, that someone would stoop that low to ruin my fun,' he said.  As for the fun others didn't find so funny, Syravong claimed on the original application that maybe it meant 'Manual Inline Lift Fluctuator.' He admits he just made that up.

Having become one of the nation's most recognizable athletes in one of the country's least recognizable sports is testament to Armstrong's accomplishment. He reportedly earns $14 million a year in endorsement fees, virtually drawing even with Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods, who, according to a poll by Knowledge Networks (reported by ESPN.com) are the only two athletes with more commercial pull among American consumers.

The store's assistant manager, Frank Holmquist, said a man first came into the store to say he wanted to buy the props marked 'secret' displayed on the front counter.      Grothus, who worked at the lab as a machinist for 20 years before retiring in 1969, said he refused to sell them because they're conversation pieces for tourists. "

News - Putting the Bite on Mailman-Shaped Dog Treats    Fri Jul 23, 9:05 AM    TORONTO (Reuters) - Dogs chomping on mail carrier-shaped treats is no laughing matter for Canada Post.    The unamused Canadian postal service -- whose carriers endure more than their share of real dog bites -- convinced Pet Valu Inc. stores to stop carrying Bark Bars, dog biscuits that come shaped like cats and letter carriers.  'This is not in any way, shape, or form funny for us, and to make light of that ... I don't see that as funny at all, not even in the least,' said John Caines, Canada Post's national media relations manager.  The pet store chain, which has 292 outlets in Canada, agreed to withdraw the treats after it received a letter from Canada Post saying that employees were concerned about the risks mail carriers face from dogs and unhappy with having dog biscuits shaped in their likeness.  Earlier this summer, a letter carrier from Chatham in southwestern Ontario broke both her wrists and had part of her ear ripped off when she was attacked by two pitbull-like dogs.  Caines said that in the first six months of 2004 there were 160 dog attacks on mail carriers across Canada. "

BY ROGER EBERT   'Catwoman' is a movie about Halle Berry's beauty, sex appeal, figure, eyes, lips and costume design. It gets those right. Everything else is secondary, except for the plot, which is tertiary. What a letdown. The filmmakers have given great thought to photographing Berry, who looks fabulous, and little thought to providing her with a strong character, story, supporting characters or action sequences. In a summer when 'Spider-Man 2' represents the state of the art, 'Catwoman' is tired and dated."

Furlong was elected an alternate delegate to the convention, and was sitting in the balcony earlier this week, and didn�t find out �til yesterday that he�d be on stage.

       urlLink Radio Iowa: High oil prices will likely lead to higher prices at the gas pump   by Darwin Danielson  Oil prices have hit an all-time high and Dawn Duffy of Triple-A's Iowa/Minnesota office says that will likely translate into higher prices at the gas pump. She says we still have a whole month left of our high summertime drive time and this definitely is going to affect prices at least in the next month. Duffy says there are a number of factors at work.What is happening in Russia with their oil production, what is happening in Norway with the possible strike of their oil workers, the pending recall of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, and also things that are happening here in this country with the increased use, the increased demand that we have. Gas prices in Iowa in the last Triple-A survey averages one-dollar and 82-cents a gallon."

One of the 'bloggers' had even compared his presence to the introduction of television to politics more than a half-century ago.  But it quickly became clear that bloggers were still trying to figure out their role. Three dozen of them were granted media status alongside an estimated 15,000 traditional journalists."

Mr. Kerry, speaking in a convention hall that was packed shoulder-to-shoulder with delegates and other Democrats two and a half hours before he strode in, promised to take charge of 'a nation at war.''   He invoked his service in Vietnam 35 years ago   as he vowed to protect Americans from terrorism in the 21st century."

A new postage stamp featuring a likeness of California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger went on sale Friday - his 57th birthday - in his native Austria and the postal service said it was bracing for heavy demand for the 600,000 stamps.  E-mail requests for the euro1 (US$1.20) stamp have flooded the nation's postal headquarters in Vienna, spokesman Johannes Angerer said. Austrians showed up early Friday to buy the stamps, but there were no long lines.  'Now you can 'stick' Arnie!' Austrian state television exulted in a report on the stamp's release."

Kerry was accompanied by former Ohio Senator John Glenn and Florida Senators Bill Nelson and Bob Graham. Photos taken of this visit depict Kerry and others wearing so called 'bunny suits' which are required of all visitors entering a space shuttle orbiter in the Shuttle Processing Facility.  Bumbling by Kerry's staff, and a press corps itching for something to make fun of, and a perfect photo opportunity turns into a media nightmare. The net loser? NASA.  Now, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel has told NASA to remove all images of Kerry's visit to KSC from all NASA web sites - immediately - due to Hatch Act concerns. These images have now been removed. "

The movie came to the dusty Texas town of Crawford (population 750), best known as the home of President Bush's ranch, at the invitation of the Crawford Peace House, a group that has staged repeated demonstrations against Mr. Bush and his policies.  Most Crawford residents weren't excited about Moore's private showing.  'I haven't seen the movie but if it's like I've heard that it is, I don't think it should be shown here,' Crawford resident Hazel Hawkins told 1200 WOAI's Jeff Vexler.

In a statement, Twentieth said it was its desire that On-Air appeal 'to a wide array of viewers, but, unfortunately, the marketplace's response was not as strong as we had hoped.' The decision follows Monday's announcement from Sinclair Broadcast Group that it would pull the syndicated talk show from more than 20 of its TV stations across the U.S.    On-Air has suffered low ratings since its January debut   , but Seacrest remained upbeat despite his show's cancellation, saying, 'I wouldn't have changed anything about this entire experience, and I look forward to building my business within Twentieth Television.' Meanwhile, XM on Monday quietly dropped its simulcast of KIIS's morning show, also named On-Air With Ryan Seacrest, on its 'Kiss' channel in favor of a more music-oriented approach.

Only those movies were cinema classics, while 'Showgirls' was so bad that adjectives such as awful, wretched and appalling somehow seemed too kind. But if a film festers in video stores long enough, its audience eventually will sniff it out.   Since it imploded critically and commercially in 1995, 'Showgirls' has gained such a fringe following of movie masochists that distributor MGM is releasing a 'V.I.P.

Researchers at the regional Federal Reserve bank acknowledged the importance of productivity and investment in the economic process but looked at some recent unconventional efforts to explain differences in national prosperity.  The St Louis Fed drew on work by outside economists who studied 35 countries, including the United States, European nations, Japan, India and Turkey and found that religion shed some useful light.       'In countries where large percentages of the population believe in hell, there seems to be less corruption and a higher standard of living,' the St. Louis Fed said in its July quarterly review.

Referring to the media's coverage of Alley's increased weight since her days on 'Cheers,' Smith, a former plus-size model, told syndicated entertainment TV show 'Access Hollywood' on Tuesday, 'They are just being so mean to her.' Excerpts of the interview were released in advance.  Alley's weight problems have been well documented by the tabloids, but she's not running from them. In a reality-comedy series for Showtime, the actress will send up her own image, as well as Hollywood's obsession with weight and beauty, in 'Fat Actress.' The half-hour series will air sometime next year."

Scottsdale, Ariz., -based Taser International and retailer The Sharper Image are negotiating to make the store the only national retailer to carry Tasers.

The consumer version is designed for personal security, and the cycle of electricity from the gun lasts up to 30 seconds.   'It's nonlethal, yet it's extremely effective,' said Steve Tuttle, a spokesman for Taser International. 'People can feel confident that they can knock down the most difficult of targets.'   Although Tasers have been publicly available through phone sales and the company Web site for more than eight years, some police officers worry that wider availability might open the door to criminal use."

Former presidential candidate Wesley Clark drew applause from Iowans this morning, but actor Ben Affleck drew louder applause and laughter from his speech. Afterrwards, he was mobbed by Iowa Democrats who snapped picture after picture of the movie star.     �Mr. Affleck, this didn�t happen with Mr. Clark. Why?� Radio Iowa news director O.Kay Henderson asked.     �Oh, I don�t know,� Affleck said, laughing. �Mr. Clark�s extremely charismatic. I think he�s sexy, to be perfectly honest.�     A little later, amid the mayhem, Affeck leaned back toward Henderson, made eye contact and touched her arm to deliver a line before his exit from the room.     �Maybe people are a little intimidated by the General,� Affleck said. �He�s imposing and seems serious. I don�t think people confer the same kind of gravitas on me.� "

More than a hundred models shed their clothes on the shores of the Millstaetter Lake in southern Austria over the weekend to be painted all sorts of weird and wonderful colours by artists from around the world.  But it was Welsh body painter Raphaelle Fieldhouse from Caerphilly who took home first prize in the 'brush category' after decorating Bristol model Charlie Dean with a 'water theme'.  Raphaelle, who was there with her husband Gary, said she was stunned to have won first prize. 'I've won prizes before but never on a world scale, it's great,' she said.  Raphaelle was joined by fellow Brit Mark Dennis who came in 22nd place. Around 150 artists took part in the contest, which has three categories including brush, airbrush and special effects."

A typical trick by guests, mostly businessmen, is to call the front desk for extras, such as fresh towels, to get female company, said the Norwegian Hotel and Restaurant Workers' Union, reporting a rising number of complaints.  'Most room service personnel work alone. It can be very unpleasant to get called to a room to be met by a naked man,' union leader Eli Ljunggren told Reuters. She said the complaints ranged from sleazy remarks to physical assaults.       'Pornography does not belong in hotel rooms. (Really?)     Pay-TV should be limited to entertainment,' she said. Most Norwegian hotels, like many hotels around the world, have easy access to pornography channels in hotel rooms for a fee. "

'You know, I have to hand it to Warner Bros.,' Miami resident Tom Peebles said Monday.   'Catwoman was terrible, but it actually had one or two decent parts. I really have to say: It could have been a lot worse!'   Catwoman, loosely based on the DC Comics character, has similarly shattered other viewers' bottom-of-the-barrel expectations, offering a small number of redeeming features instead of the expected none. 'That one part where the woman pushes Catwoman off a balcony to demonstrate that she can land on her feet was sort of cool, I guess,' said Bangor, ME's Sally Burrows. 'And it was kind of funny when she ate, like, 10 cans of tuna in a row. Oh, and when she drank that glass of cream at the bar�that was, though not exactly funny, at least funny-ish. My kids seemed to like it. Well, Mindy, at least.' 'Mindy just turned 7,' Burrows added.

Claude Meadows, 34, approached a man in the parking lot of a Murphy Road coin-operated laundry about 4 p.m. and patted a bulge in his pocket, saying he had a knife, Capt. Ben Dicke said. The victim surrendered his car keys and Meadows left with the vehicle, Dicke said. A description of the thief was broadcast over the police radio. From the description, some officers suspected it was Meadows, Dicke said. A little later, Officer Marty Burns and others were attending the Night Out event in McCabe Park, at Murphy Road at 46th Avenue North, and they spotted Meadows getting a hamburger there. In his pocket, officers found a multi-purpose pocket tool and the victim's car keys."

Police on foot chased down the suspect in the first robbery, which occurred just about when Bush was stepping off his plane. The second and third robberies at different banks took place while the two candidates were addressing their respective crowds -- which was almost certainly factored into the thieves' thinking, police Lt. Don Gano said. 'Without actually talking to the bad guys, that's probably what happened,' Gano said of the robbers' timing. When police answered the first call, it further thinned their ranks, Gano said. Police were hunting for the other two suspects, who were both armed. They did not believe any of the suspects were aware of the others' plans."

The running chainsaw crashed down onto the neck of his wife, who was working in the garden below him. "The woman was killed instantly, although she was not decapitated," police said in a statement.

They occupied the small space with another Jewish family and a single Jewish man, and were aided by Christian friends, who brought them food and supplies. Anne spent much of her time in the 'secret annex' working on her diary. The diary survived the war, overlooked by the Gestapo that discovered the hiding place, but Anne and nearly all of the others perished in the Nazi death camps."

      This item appeared in the  urlLink Opinion Journal , the Wall Street Journal's insightful feature.    Moore Slime  Having already angered science fiction writer Ray Bradbury by plundering the title of his best-selling novel for his own film "Fahrenheit 9/11," Michael Moore is now being accused of doctoring a newspaper headline shown in the film. Given that every media examination of the 2000 presidential election in Florida found that George W. Bush would have won a statewide recount, Mr. Moore was obviously hard up for headlines that would bolster his claim that the Bush forces had stolen the election. He wound up using one from The Pantagraph, a newspaper in Bloomington, Illinois. In the film a copy of the paper's front page from December 19, 2001 is reproduced with the headline: "Latest Florida recount shows Gore won election." The only problem is that The Pantagraph's editors say those words didn't run in its December 19 edition, but rather on December 5 and not on the front page. Instead the headline appeared in much smaller type above a letter to the editor, which the paper says reflects "only the opinions of the letter writer." The falsification of historical evidence here is calculated and blatant, and the paper is understandably demanding an apology. Given Mr. Moore's track record of "hit and run" journalism, however, the paper's editors can expect to wait a long time.

The Summit County coroner�s office identifies the woman as Mary Wiper. Wiper had reportedly just recently moved to Albuquerque and was working with the New Mexico chapter of the Sierra Club. According to the Summit County Sheriff�s Office, officers were called at about 3:20 Sunday afternoon after wiper was hit by lightning while hiking.

       The Democratic Presidential nominee is making history! Not since 1972 has the Democratic Party and nominee experienced a post-convention bounce like Kerry experienced coming out of Boston.      urlLink ABCNEWS.com : Kerry Foresees No More U.S. Troops for Iraq   ...Kerry made the rounds of the Sunday talk shows with his running mate, Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, while on a two-week, 3,500-mile trip through battleground states.              He was seeking to capitalize on momentum generated by last week's Democratic convention as a new CNN-USA Today Gallup poll showed he had gained only 1 percentage point over Bush.              The poll of registered voters showed Kerry leading 50 percent to 47 percent for Bush, compared to a larger lead last month, 49 percent to 45 percent. A Newsweek poll on Saturday gave Kerry a four-point jump, or 'bounce,' from the convention among registered voters.      The Bush campaign pounced on the Gallup poll to point out that Kerry was the first nominee of either party to receive no bounce from his convention since Democrat George McGovern in 1972.     A senior Kerry adviser dismissed the survey as an aberration. "

Instead of flower or contributions in her name to a charity,   she asked those who loved her to try to make sure President George W. Bush is not re-elected.    Loved ones said that Joan Abbey was committed to her political passions, even in death. Abbey was born in Montreal, but lived for many years in Miami Beach and Aventura. Family and friends came from as far away as Canada and California to remember Abbey at the Mount Nebo Jewish Cemetery in Miami. Abbey, who was a lifelong Democrat, died Monday -- coincidentally on the first day of the Democratic National Convention."

Niagara Regional Police report the 17-year-old youth burst into the home uninvited, and the girl's parents tried to stop him. The youth allegedly pulled out a canister of bear repellent - four times more potent than the pepper spray used by cops - and began spraying. By the time officers arrived, the youth and the girl's father were 'incapacitated and required decontamination.' The youth is accused of assault with a weapon.   No word on the status of the romance  . "     I'm not sure, but I think we can correctly guess the status of the romance.

       urlLink Dead legislator cashes in war chest   BY CHRIS FUSCO AND TIM NOVAK Staff Reporters Advertisement  In the case of former state Sen. Aldo A. DeAngelis, you can take it with you. The south suburban Republican who served in the General Assembly between 1979 and 1997 died on Feb. 13. But newly released state records show that DeAngelis' political fund was cashed out on March 30, with $143,000 posthumously paid directly to him. Such a lump sum couldn't happen under today's state campaign finance laws, which prohibit political war chests established after mid-1998 from being used like personal bank accounts."       This from the city that coined the phrase: "Vote early and vote often."

A partially clothed body, face-down and hunched over, was floating nearby in the water.  Police reports later described the victim as a white female of unidentifiable age who died two to four days earlier from four gunshot wounds to the chest; one bullet pierced her right hand, on its way to her heart, as if she had taken a defensive posture.
