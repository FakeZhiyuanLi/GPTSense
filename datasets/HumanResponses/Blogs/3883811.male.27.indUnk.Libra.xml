						   It's musing time... why is it that some 13 year olds are better looking than girls my age?  Take that in a sexual or non-sexual way, I don't care.  But what scares me is that I know some of these girls, the way they dress, etc., could probably get into a bar.  Okay, maybe the 16 year olds could.  You can't assume they're 21 at all.  That scares me.  You never know what you're getting.  It also scares me that they all want to be married at 18 with kids.  That's just not right, either.  But some of them are just incredible looking... I'm pretty sure girls didn't look like that when I was 13.  I think they're just growing up too fast.  What will happen when I get kids who are 13?  Especially if I have daugthers?  Man, that's not something I want to think about.  God help us all, but especially the kids of today.  You couldn't pay me to go back to high school now.  I'm heading to see Rush in Atlanta this weekend... sweetness.  I love that band, those guys put on a better show than almost anyone else I've ever seen, and I've probably been to well over 200 shows by now.  I'll tell you who I really didn't dig was Dave Matthews this past weekend.  Sorry Dave fans, but I don't get the feeling he's into it this tour, at least not at that show.  I saw him a little bit ago, maybe a year or two, and it was a good show.  But this time I felt like he was mailing it in.  Not great, and not really even fun.  I don't know, I'm not uber fan who knows all the words and shit.  Not for him, anyway.  But I enjoy lots of live music.  I just wasn't into it.  Neither was Dave.  Dave is not God.  Get over that, Matthewsfan.  I like the music to a certain extent, but get real.  Stop sucking him off for every little thing he does.  I've been in a mood to start writing lately, and it extends beyond this.  I think it's going to develop and manifest itself soon.  And it's also time to travel more.  Europe is calling.  The money isn't there, but Europe is definitely calling right now.  **sigh**  I miss sitting in the pub and getting pissed.  Might need a night like that sooner than later.  Brian and Vic arrive next week to stay with me, and that's cool.  I'm excited to have them down here, he's my best friend from college.  And that in itself is saying something, that Brian has stuck by me through thick and thin.  I love him for that, and I always will.  Thanks man.  Can't wait to see you.  Okay, time for me to get my ass moving, even if it is to the pub for a pint.  Anyone wanna join me?  Let's meet at the Highlander.

						   Gotta tell you, I love that show.  I love people crashing into each other and really hard objects.  Sweet.  Right now Meaghan is crying because her family sucks.  She's very sad because she's having a rough time at home and can't wait for us to be together.  Yes, more than likely one day we will be together.  And there's not a damn thing I can do to help her now. Her mom hates me anyway, but that's more due to our age difference (7 years) than anything.  I've always gotten on with parents very well, but for whatever reason it's just not working out in this case.  I've tried to make some inroads, but apparently whatever I'm doing isn't enough.  Fuck off Julie.  Led my hockey team to victory with a shutout tonight, and actually had to work for it. Made some damn good saves tonight, and played my best game in a while. It kicked ass.  I feel good about that.  Angie called, she's doing well and misses me already.  We had a great weekend.  One of my favorite moments was just her being with me Sunday at Mellow Mushroom, hanging out and shooting the shit over a few beers.  Thanks, dear, I needed a good, friendly weekend like that.  Just don't tell you-know-who...  And oh yes, I have my access up at home, and this is the first post from my actual lap on my laptop.  It's about damn time!  Later

						   Finally got my damn home internet working, it's about time.&nbsp; Now I can get to the eporn in an easier way.&nbsp; Although I do have to say it's getting a bit boring these days.&nbsp; Back five, maybe ten years ago, it was easier, not all this pop up shit, and people wanted to share their porn.&nbsp; Now, if you want it, download it.&nbsp; You can't get porn on line anymore. Anyway, finally got some shit sold at work, so therefore have staved off job elimination for a little while.&nbsp; Hopefully I can keep my shit in gear right through August and just make some sales, get some extra cash, and most importantly be here when fall rolls around.&nbsp; So far, so good. Not much else to report.&nbsp; Dawn is disappointed because she can't come down and visit me later this month, Meaghan will be here.&nbsp; I'm glad Meaghan will be here, she'll be looking at Atlanta schools.&nbsp; Dawn and I go way back, but it's just one of those wrong place, wrong time things.&nbsp; All the time.&nbsp; Always has been. Angie and I had a good time in Charlotte (Dave show) and it was nice to have her down here.&nbsp; I discovered she gives the best head ever.&nbsp; Sweet!&nbsp; Thanks for that, with no effort, she got me twice this weekend in less than ten minutes.&nbsp; Which for any female on me is unreal.&nbsp; Good for her!&nbsp; Bad for me, she had to go back home.&nbsp; Dammit. Okay, time to go procure dinner.&nbsp; Just feeling a little relief now that things have abated a bit.&nbsp; Whew!

						   Apparently it was my turn to play cyber bitch, as nothing I wrote was posted correctly.  Fine - fuck it.  Or as they say down south, fuck  y'all.   There you have it.  Elizabeth is going to have a bit to deal with over the coming weeks, I think she finally got the hint that her ex is just no good for her.  In a very bad, self-destructive way.  I think I may have to keep away for a bit in case of meltdown, but still be there for her if she needs me.  It's an interesting time to head to Charlotte.  It also seems that I've become an electronics device killer lately.  Usually one who has had nothing but a green thumb with that stuff, all of a sudden the desktop, laptop, and DVD recorder all go at the same time.  Dammit.  What's the deal there?  Seriously!  One fixed (desktop), two to go.  Maybe I can get it in gear at some point.    So Judas is wandering Russia and hasn't been in contact much.  Not surprising.  Nor is his random bloggage.  I know exactly where he's at and why he's there, if only mentally.  I truly feel like I could step off a plane near where he is and find him.  It would just work.  Trust me.  Mike, my prayers are with your family, especially your dad.  Consulting Col. is the right thing to do, and him retiring is the right thing to do, too.  Col., enjoy your family.  They've been waiting.  But rememeber the large extended one you've created.  We'll always be with you.  Okay, I've gotta get back to work.

						   Perhaps this is going to turn into something that I just use to vent, perhaps I'll just leave it as a little slice of life that leaves me to detail everything to complete strangers while not at all worrying or bothering my friends with it.  Perhaps... I'll have to jump off that bridge when I come to it.  But in the meantime, I'm just happy as all hell that my computer has finally been fixed at work, now it's time to fix the one at home and the laptop at home.  And the DVD Recorder... and... oh, hell with it, that list pisses me off anyway. Just had lunch with Ellie, that was good.  We talked about her getting over her BF and she's getting stronger about herself, which I like.  I think she's very close to coming full circle, dealing with a lot of demons, and getting things on track.  She's one of the most interesting people I've met, and I have to say that I can't wait to get to know even more of her.  We're going to be great friends for a long time, and I look forward to that. Meanwhile, Meaghan continues to film her independent pic in upstate NY.  I hope things are working out for her with that, and I hope it leads to more, bigger, and better things.  Her potential is limited only by the scope of her experience, which widens all the time.  I know she'll be successful, I just hope I can be part of it.  We're all heading for success in some way, it's just getting there that can tend to piss us off.  But that's good, really.  If you don't get pissed about something on the way there, it means you have no passion.  And having no passion for life is where you're going to get stuck in a rut. Remind me to tell myself that more frequently.  Do as I say, not as I do.  Okay, back to the grind. Tom

						   Okay, this should be interesting.  I'm actually starting this right now because I have a total and utter lack of anything to do later on a Friday.  I'm appreciating the path that my good friend Brian Smith has taken with  urlLink www.milobloom.com .  We often find that which passes for every day life quite interesting.  So why not?  I'm going to take my potshots at the world and see what people have to say.  It all starts with a post and a dream. I suppose there's nothing really going on of note in Augusta, GA right now, other than the fact that next week I'll be formally announcing a buddy of mine getting a job down here (but I can't even let that slip on line yet).  For those of you who don't know, I work for a minor league hockey team doing radio, public relations, and sales.  I hate sales.  We all hate sales.  They're evil, but without them, you have no team.  So there you are.  Anyway, he'll be joining us soon, and I think this may become a fun spot to chronicle what's going on with my life on the road once the season starts.   Oh, before I forget, let's get one thing straight.  There's no way in hell I'm going to post to this thing every day.  Read it once a week if you really, really have to.  But there's just no way in hell I'll be on here every single day.  Enjoy!

						   Just cleared out Brian and Vic from the weekend they spent here, which was a great time.  I really liked having them around to hang out with, and I hope I didn't bore the shit out of them.  There's only so much you can do in GA without gonig cow tipping.  Yes, that was sarcastic. Anyway, Meaghan comes down for ten days starting this weekend.  Her and I will stay in ATL for a few days and check the area out for her before coming back here, hopefully for amazing sex as always and some quality time.  I'm really looking forward to it, because not only am I excited for her, but I'm tired of masturbating.  Hey, a guy's gotta get some now and again!  Hopefully she's down here full time starting in January and I can go from there.  That's the hope, anyway. Let's see here... Angie is going through the same thing at her work that I went through a month ago.  I can see it coming to where it's going to be tough for her to get fired up about things, and get more organized, but she's got to do it.  Best of luck sweetie, I'm always here for you.  And I've been there about the job thing.  She knows this.  So now it's my turn to rally her.  She'll get through it.  I know she will. Ellie is doing her thing, although she's doing the annoying I don't eat for two days bullshit.  She knows it's not healty to not eat.  But this whole I don't have time excuse is wearing thin.  Dammit Ell, eat something.  I don't want you turning into Mary-Kate. Off the house buying track for now.  It looks like tight money will get tighter once again, but at the end of the day things should be okay.  I just gotta make it through this month.  As always.  Am I still in college or what?  Maybe once the car is paid off... yeah, sure.  Otherwise I don't have a lot going on, but I did get a shitload more responsibility at work, which means I'll have a job for sure through the season.  That's a plus, I was getting a bit worried there for a while.  But fear not, I'll be back for yet another season!  Whoo! Aight, time to jet.  May the force be with you.
