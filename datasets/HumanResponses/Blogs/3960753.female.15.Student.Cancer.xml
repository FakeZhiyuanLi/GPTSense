Don’t try to be like anyone else you don’t have to be.  Its not the hours, the time that we’ve spent. Special moment like this makes you notes heaven sent. Your nothing less than the right one for me, Don’t try to be like someone else you don’t have to be.  You’re the right one, the right one for me. We can be friends for life. Good friends we’ll always be. No matter where life leads us, we’ll always have each other ‘cause you’re the right one, the right one for me.  Its not the sweet song. It isn’t the dream. Its just you’re my good friend and the love that you bring. Throughout the season you’re the one for me. You’re the one I love to love and you’ll always be.  You’re the right one, the right one for me. We can be friends for life. Good friends we’ll always be. No matter where life leads us, we’ll always have each other ‘cause you’re the right one, the right one for me.  You’re the right one, the right one for me. We can be friends for life. Good friends we’ll always be. No matter where life leads us, we’ll always have each other ‘cause you’re the right one, the right one for me.  The right one for me.

      What a wonderful, wonderful world this could be. What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world. Don’t know much about history. Don’t know much biology. Don’t know much about science book. Don’t know much about the French I took. But I do know that I love you. And I know that if you love me to. What a wonderful, wonderful world this could be.  Don’t know much about geography. Don’t know much trigonometry. Don’t know much about algebra. I don’t know what a slide ruler is for. But I do know one and one is two. And if this one could be you. What a wonderful, wonderful world this could be. What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world  Now I don’t claim to be an A student. But I am trying to be. I think that maybe by being an A student baby I could win your love for me. Don’t know much about the middle ages. I look at the pictures and I turn the pages. Don’t know nothing about no rise and fall. Don’t know nothing about nothing at all.&nbsp;Boy its you that I’ve been thinking of. And if I could only win your love. What a wonderful, wonderful world this could be.  What a wonderful, wonderful world this could be  What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world  What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world  What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world  What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world

      When I see you on the street I loose my concentration. Just the thought that we might meet creates anticipation. Won’t you look my way once before you go and my eyes will say what you wanna know. Well I’ve been thinking about you day and night and I don’t know if it will work out right, but somehow I think that it just might, if we try.  Faces come and faces go in circular rotation. Something yearns within to grow beyond infatuation. Won’t you look my way once before you go and my eyes will say what you wanna know. Well you’ve got me standing deaf and blind, cause I see love as just a state of mind, and who knows what it is that we might find, if we try, and who knows what it is that we might find, if we try.  Were walking different directions from most people I’ve met. You’ve given me signs of affection I don’t usually get. I don’t want you to pledge your future, the future is not yours to give. Just stand there a little longer and let me watch while you leave.  ‘Cause when I see you on the street I loose my concentration. And just the thought that we might meet creates anticipation. Won’t you look my way once before you go and my eyes will say what you wanna know. Well I’ve been thinking about you day and night and I don’t know if it will work out right, but somehow I think that it just might, if we try. Somehow I think that it just might, if we try. Yes somehow I think that it just might, if we try.

         It's not Firday the 13th. Mr. Lago was absent. And the bullies were suspended. But Me and my friends really did have some bad luck today!      First, we haven't finished our project in English, which will be submitted tomorrow! My friend, Jerelynn and Russell was left by their bus. And me and my other friends were stuck in school because of the rain. So what we all tease each other and do some crazy stuff. The only thing we did is to talk, chat, talk, and chat the whole afternoon, we were the only one left in school because it's halfday.      It was almost quarter to 3 so we all just recorded our voice in the radio, and we dubbed all afternoon. We was so noisy that the teachers in the faculty room almost heard us. But we still talked and talked. We were getting really noisy, so our school directress ( which we call the "penguin" ) heard us and started calling Mang Bhay ( our school's head janitor ) when we heard her voice, me and my friends started running, and we hid at the back of our school's canteen, but "BULAGA" one of our janitor in school saw us. So we all run to get our bag and head off the school's gate. I was getting my radio so I was at their back when our english teacher saw me. I acted as if I didn't heard her, but I saw her furious face so I ran to catch up with my friends.     We were in the gate and were trying to find some umbrellas we can use to protect our head and our uniform from the rain. Then when we had a glance from our back we saw "THE PENGUIN" coming, so even wothout umbrellas we ran in the streets with only a folder on our head.      So we thought were free from "BAD LUCK" but we were wrong, we were all WRONG, when we was walking on the side of the street, this F****** jeepney splashed a mud in our skirts!      THE END grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
