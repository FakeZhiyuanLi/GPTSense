      I've been packing for what seems like 3 weeks.&nbsp; My stuff is all over the house.&nbsp; I'm sitting here writing this from one of my last nights in my house.&nbsp; The mountain of knick knacks that accumulated over the years is by my feet, closets are empty, walls are bare.&nbsp; I only have 6 cds that aren't packed in a box, so tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday, the changer is rotating David Via & Corn Tornado, Alison Krauss, Old Crow Medicine Show and Susan Tedeschi.&nbsp; I guess I'm in a bluegrass mood, huh?&nbsp; So, tomorrow at this time, I will be making my first loads to my apartment.&nbsp; It's so weird to think I am doing this.&nbsp; I've never lived alone and feel like I have a lot of good things to look forward to, but I also know that it isn't always going to be good.&nbsp; The thought of waking up alone every morning weakens my stomach and the thought of coming home to an empty house every day, or not having to sort through the mail anymore, because you know it is all going to be yours.&nbsp; I thank my stars everyday that I am only 25 going through this rather than having to rediscover yourself at the age of 35 with children to consider.&nbsp; I know I won't always make the best decisions, but at least they will be my decision to make.&nbsp; I haven't cried in days.&nbsp; I'm still not sure if it's because I'm adjusting, or just tired of being emotional about everything.&nbsp; My mother in law called last night.&nbsp; She told me that she has loved me for 10 years and she can only hope that we both will be happy.   I guess only time will tell.   I spent the night with Mike on Tuesday.&nbsp; I'm sad he's leaving.&nbsp; We have the most amazing conversations about life.&nbsp; Laying there with him on Tuesday night in his arms warmed my heart.&nbsp; The first time I've felt that way in a while.

      I started my current job in May.&nbsp; I'd often noticed a car parked in the parking area with WP & Bonnaroo stickers on it.&nbsp; Today, I met its owner.&nbsp; Erika that works in the cafeteria drives it.&nbsp; We talked for a while about festivals and shows and I mentioned that I had gone to smilefest.&nbsp; She seemed to know a lot of the same people as I, including this guy that I camped with last weekend.&nbsp; Small, Crazy world.&nbsp; It's so funny that music brings the world together.&nbsp; Once you meet someone and you discuss music with them, it seems like it is the most effective combatibility test.&nbsp; Take Jules and I.&nbsp; We met on the INTERNET at a music discussion board.&nbsp; Now, a year later, I consider her one of my best friends.&nbsp; We can hang together without any drama.&nbsp; There's an unspoken understanding between friends that share musical interests.&nbsp; Now, I am not saying that everyone must like the same music, but people who  appreciate  music really understand each other.   &nbsp;  My first experience with music was probably when I was around 9.&nbsp; I spent the weekend with my grandparents, incidentaly my grandfather was a moonshiner and had several of his buddies up that weekend.&nbsp; They sat around the dining room table picking bluegrass and sipping moonshine out of a dixie cup, chasing it with Sun Drop.&nbsp; I wish I could go&nbsp;back to that time and sit in the corner of the room and take all of that good music in.&nbsp; That was the first time I heard live music.&nbsp; Never will I forget, Kermit Mason playing the fiddle and singing along to Dooley.&nbsp;   I wish I had gotten into music then and taken up playing an instrument.&nbsp; I have a mandolin now, but it's been sitting for two years begging me to pick it up and play it.&nbsp; I'm too lazy I suppose.&nbsp; I honestly wish I'd just saved enough to buy the instrument I really wanted--an upright bass.&nbsp; I just want to play something!   So, back to my musical journey.&nbsp; I guess when I was around 12, I was poking around in a bin of my dad's old records.&nbsp; My mom always listened to pop and motown stuff, so that's what I was accustomed to listening.&nbsp; The first record of my Dad's I played was a compilation Rock album,&nbsp; I still have it as a matter of fact, including songs by Grand Funk, America, Led Zeppelin, White Oak Arkansas and others.&nbsp; The one song that did "it" for me was Zeppelin's D'yer Ma'ker.&nbsp; I have  no  idea why it did it for me, but it did.   Now, here I am 13 years later, totally obsessed with music.&nbsp; I spend most of my days, when work allows, discussing music or other topics on a music message board, all the while listening to wncw.org.&nbsp; Music in the car, music at home, music at work...My world revolves around it.&nbsp; This small crazy world.   Anyhow, here are the lyrics to the song that stole my heart and gave it to music.   &nbsp;  Oh oh oh oh oh oh  You don't have to go oh oh oh oh oh  You don't have to go oh oh oh oh oh  Baby please don't go.   Ay ay ay ay ay ay  All those tears I cry ay ay ay ay ay  All those tears I cry ay ay ay ay ay  Baby please don't go.   CHORUS  When I read the letter you wrote  it made me mad mad mad  When I read the news that it brought me  It made me sad sad sad.  But I still love you so  I can't let you go  I love you- ooh baby I love you.   Oh oh oh oh oh oh  Every breath I take oh oh oh oh oh  Every move I make oh oh oh oh oh  Baby please don't go.   Ay ay ay ay ay ay  You hurt me to my soul ay ay ay ay ay  You hurt me to my soul ay ay ay ay ay  Darling please don't go.   CHORUS  Oh oh oh oh oh oh  You don't have to go oh oh oh oh oh  You don't have to go oh oh oh oh oh  (Baby please don't go)

      Smilefest was lots of fun.&nbsp; It's Tuesday now and the festival ended on Sunday.&nbsp; I am just now feeling back to normal.&nbsp;   My Smilefest Review:   I didn't see enough Music.&nbsp; I contribute this to the lack of sleep and the intense heat and humidity.&nbsp; Saturday, I was miserable.&nbsp; The music that I saw was great.&nbsp; Highlights for me include Big Daddy Bluegrass Band (they are always fun), Derek Trucks Band (I still kinda like them in a club a little better), and laying in my tent listening to Garaj Mahal.&nbsp; I almost got up and went to the stage, but at that point in the night, I figured it was best I stayed in my tent.&nbsp; My trip was intense.&nbsp; I enjoyed every minute of it ;)&nbsp;   I've been slack ass about packing this week.&nbsp; My plan was to move some stuff on Friday, but now it looks like folks from work are going out to celebrate Mike's new job.&nbsp; I really wanna hang out w/ folks from work, but I really need to get some stuff moved Friday night.&nbsp; Maybe if I get enough done this week I can convince myself that it will be okay to go out Friday night...?&nbsp; Jules is going to DBT on Friday too, which would be fun, but I dont know if I can hang out late and then do sooo much work on Saturday.&nbsp;   What to do?&nbsp; My social calendar is just too big.&nbsp; I'm supposed to be driving down to Gastonia on Sat night to see Mark Van Allen play w/ the Planet Riders.&nbsp; If I can find someone to go with me, I just might make the drive.....   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Gosh.&nbsp; I am sooo excited to go to Smilefest.&nbsp; Even though I have a million other things to do right now, i.e. PACK, I'm ready for a FESTIVALLL!&nbsp;   I'm ready to move.&nbsp; Travis and I are arguing about stupid shit all of the time.&nbsp; Last night we went to the hospital to see my new niece, Katie, Born at 5:12 pm, weighing 7 lbs 8 ounces, and measuring 21 inches long.&nbsp; He didn't even speak to my grandparents until they were leaving when he told them to take care.&nbsp; They didn't respond and I really don't think they heard him.&nbsp; Now he's just freakin paranoid about it.&nbsp;   Anyhoo.&nbsp; I'll post a picture of my niece soon.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      And then you find out some wonderful news that will make it even better.  I am going to be an Aunt again this morning.  My sister is in labor.  Lets just hope this one is easier than the time before.  I did get some crappy news this morning.  My "buddy" from work has accepted another job offer and will be moving to Cleveland, OH August 3rd.  Sad that we didn't get to see what could become of this.  Oh well.  More later perhaps.

      This weekend was pretty lazy for me.&nbsp; I did some packing Friday night and Saturday, but for the most part, I was pretty lazy.&nbsp; It was nice.&nbsp; Friday night it seemed like I wasn't going to be able to make it through the weekend at home because we were fighting already.&nbsp; But Saturday was a little better except that I made a huge mistake and had sex w/ Travis.&nbsp; Ick.&nbsp; I don't know what the hell I was thinking, but I guess yesterday he figured it wasn't going to happen again, because I told him to grab his pillows when I went to bed so he&nbsp;could sleep on the couch again.  &nbsp;  I am going at lunch to measure the doorways of my apartment.&nbsp; I have to make sure that my couch is gonna fit through there!&nbsp; Tomorrow, Mike comes back from Vegas.&nbsp; I'm sure he will have plenty of good stories to tell.&nbsp; I kinda miss him.&nbsp; Crazy I know, but he's my cube mate!&nbsp; It's lonely here without him!  &nbsp;  I've been talking via email to this guy from the phook.&nbsp; He's interesting and we have good conversations and he's a college grad w/ a good job, he just doesn't have his license.&nbsp; I guess we all make mistakes sometimes, he just got caught.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Maybe it's a good thing he doesn't have a license.&nbsp; ;)  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I've decided to take a mental health day on Friday.&nbsp; I guess I will tell my boss Thursday, or should I just call in Friday morning?&nbsp; Hmmm....  &nbsp;  SMILEFEST is this weekend!&nbsp; Woo Hoo!

      I’m surprised by the weight of your body on mine. Surprised by the strength in your large hands exploring me. Only moments before you seemed like a shy boy with an instant hard on when I leaned in for that first kiss. Unsteady as I unbuttoned your pants and slid them down your legs. Lips quivering as I licked and sucked on your hard cock. A surprised look in your eye when I massaged your balls as you shot that first hot and excited load in my mouth. Now. Now those same eyes had a firey and devilish look glimmering in them as your hungry mouth devoured my own. The intensity in your hands almost burning my skin. My pussy wet and hot …. almost uncomfortably so, as I squirm below you. Your hands … those large, rough hands, slide under my ass and grip it tight pulling me closer into you. My body is still fighting to be in control … but wanting to let you take over. Not yet ready to succumb I push on your shoulders to lower your face and that mouth … that hard wet mouth …. between my quivering thighs. My nails digging into your arms and tight neck I continue to push until you stop licking my breasts and squeezing my ass and flash a large grin at me. Then kiss down my stomach …. again the devilish grin right before you bite hard into my thigh!! So hard I wonder if you drew blood and I clench my teeth ready to scream but before it comes out you’re licking my clit with a masterful technique that surprises and excites me all at once! Within minutes I feel the orgasm take over my body … pleasure/pain … dominance/submission …. my mind is spinning. You grab my hips and twist me around so I’m on my stomach, still trying to get my bearings. You pull my hips up to meet your own and I steady myself on my elbows. Pushing back into you, you rub the head of your throbbing cock on my slit. At first gentle and even … then a little rougher, with more friction on my clit. Right as I start to get my head together you surprise me again and slam your body into mine … driving your cock deep into my wet – wet pussy. I moan loudly and push back into you. You continue to pound hard into me until the aching in my clit is matched only by the aching in your balls from smacking up on it. Suddenly your pace slows and I beg you not to stop … I can feel another orgasm welling up from the repeated friction of your head rubbing on my g-spot. You smack my ass lightly and continue at the same slow, drawn out pace. Fully removing your cock from me and then sliding it back in so you can feel your head push through my hole as I tighten around you. You lick your finger and tickle my asshole with it, sliding it in gently. After a few pumps you slide in another finger … your fingers sliding in motion with your cock. You can feel your it pushing into me through the thin layer of skin separating the two. Then you completely remove your self from me and I turn to see what you are up to now. You reach up and grab a handful of my hair, pulling my head back so I’m forced to look forward and not be able to see you rubbing lube all over your shaft and an extra amount on your head. You release my hair and grab your cock at the base and start rubbing it on my slit again. It’s nice and wet and hard. You move up to my ass and start to rub and massage me. I relax and allow you to enter. First you slowly slide your head in and then a little deeper and a little deeper. A few slow thrusts to lubricate us both and then pain gives way to pleasure. You gauge my reaction perfectly and start to grind into me at a nice even pace. After a few minutes my moans get louder, louder than you have heard all night. My back arches and the orgasm takes over. You reach down and feel my juices flowing. You take your cue and start to drive your hard throbbing cock into my ass, harder and harder. It doesn’t take long and you too feel ready to explode. You push all the way into me and let loose, pulling out as the cum releases from your aching balls and fills me up. Right as you pull all the way out the last few hot drops spray on my ass and you collapse next to my weak body.

      So I ran upon this the other day.  Its a story that I wrote w/ SeeEmilyPlay on the phook one day.  It makes me really want to be with a girl again.  Not for a relationship by any means, but you know, just for the sheer fun of it.  God, I am such a freakin horndog lately.  Why would my hormones be raging at a time like this in my life.  I can totally see myself having a bunch of meaningless flings when I get out of here.  I'm a little girl with nothing wrong and I'm all alone.  That was the line in the Norah Jones song that I was listening to, but at this moment in time it seemed to fit my life at that exact moment.  How weird?  I don't want to have a bunch of meaningless sex, I just want to be wanted.  This will do some crazy things to your mind.  Hmm...let me take a quick break and then I will decide if you should read the story yet...Ok, so I do want to write a little more, until Mason gets too annoying.  I can't believe I agreed to keep him in my apartment while Travis is traveling.  I can only hope he will calm down after he gets fixed.  We all have dreams don't we?  So, do you think I should take all of the board games?  I think it would be lots of fun to have a game night with friends.  It may sound cheezy to some, but I've had a lot of fun nights playing games.  Anywhoo, enjoy the story below.  I know I do.  she walks into the room, her snug white t-shirt  pressing against her erect nipples. her long brown  hair flowing down over her shoulders. The v-neck of  her shirt showing just enough cleavage to make me want  to see more. her long legs stride over to my desk,  where i have turned around to watch her. she leans  down and whispers in my ear and her luscious lips  nipple at my ear lobe. her tongue, moving slowly down  to my neck. her mouth moves to my lips where she  plants the most scrumptious kiss on me. My hand raises  and moves toward her breast...I must feel her erect  nipples between my fingers....my hand cusps her  breast, i gently tug her shirt down, exposing her  awaiting presents. I lean forward and tickle them with  my tongue, then taking all of it in my mouth, gently  rolling my tongue around her erectness. her head leans  back in pleasure, her heart beating faster. my other  arm wraps around her body, pulling her closer to me.  my nipples erect now, i am beginning to feel my juices  begin to flow. i slide my hand under her skirt sliding  my fingers slowly under her tanga. Tantalizing her  thighs with my touch.carressing her ass shes wiggling  with excitement. her hands fondling my breasts as i  slide my finger into her wet waiting wonderland. her  hips gyrate, making the entry easier. I slide her  panties down and put her on the desk. I push her  thighs apart and kiss her knee. my tongue trails down  her thigh, leaving gentle kisses along the way. The  warmth of her is guiding me. the closer i get the more  excited she is. i breathe on her swollen clit and  gently lick it once. I taste her honey, reaching  further in with my tongue to taste all that I can...i  put my throbbing finger inside her while i focus on  her engorged clit. my tongue first, licking up and  down, then focusing around and round. your hips moving  around and up, pushing my fingers deeper and deeper  inside of you. your breasts bounce gently as you move,  your hair swishing around your shoulders. your sweet  moans are making me wet. i suck at your clit and put  another finger inside of you..

      That's about all I can say to being pleasured orally for an hour and a half.  I have  never  been so turned on in all of my life.  He said he loved to give, but  never  did I think he liked it that much.  My god, I am still dripping thinking about last night.  Too bad he's going to Vegas tomorrow, because I could already use an encore.

      I figure if I start out that way, It has to happen, right?  Seriously, I am feeling much better today.  Last night I packed up my office and managed to find all kinds of stuff.  None of which made me cry, I am proud to say.  I think I am going out tonight w/ some folks from work.  I hope no one backs out, because I could use a good time.

      Well, It's Monday again.  Yesterday was a rough day.  I just woke up feeling blah and ended up sleeping most of the day.  Friday night was fun, I decided to go to Gboro and check out  Scarlet Harlot  which was freaking awesome.  Totally blew me away, now if I can only get them to record a live show and spread it around.  Met a couple of Jules' friends.  Names are out of the question at this point, but one of them left me a voicemail at work at 1:32 AM on Sat.  hehe  :)    Saturday, Travis and I hung out at the pool then went to Gboro for Thai food and went to Target.  I got a tent for Smilefest.  I had one, but it was ENTIRELY too large for just me.  I think that is why I was so depressed Sunday.  We really had a great day together.  I need to stop that because it just confuses me.  At least I had enough restraint not to sleep with him.  Thank God.    I tried to watch Secret Window again last night, but fell asleep.  Oh well, I guess I'll give it another try one night this week.  I am hoping to get some boxes from work so I can start packing up some stuff.  I MUST have a yard sale, I have way too much crap!  Ok, that's enough for now.  I might venture on later with some more words of rediscovery.

      Last night I had an AMAZING dinner @ Jules'.  Grilled tuna, NY strip, grilled veggies and couscous.  It was soooo GOOD!    Today at lunch I found an apartment.  It's seems like its in a really cool neighborhood. I'm so excited and scared to death at the same time.  I have sooo much to do!  I've never lived alone, so taking the first steps in this journey would terrify anyone.  But I know that, and I expect it, so accepting it is all I have to do.  Feels so weird!  Tonight is visitation at the funeral home for Robin's mom.  I still have to decide if I am going to Greensboro afterwords...Hmm....

      Ugh.  I have the worst cramps ever.  Headache, backache, and grumpy.  Last night, Robin's mom passed away.  I got to the hospital about 45 minutes after she died.  I didn't get to see Robin, so I am not sure how she was doing, she was still in there with her dad.  Arrangements aren't final yet, but it looks like it will be Friday night visitation and a Saturday funeral.  What a way to spend a weekend.  After I got home from the hospital last night, I had a beer and two veggie corn dogs.  Thanks Jules for turning these on to me. I had dinner in 2.5 mins.  Yumm.  I smoked a bit and then went outside on the patio and decided to call my sister.  I told her everything that was going on with me and Travis and she listened as any good sister would.  I was kind of hot and sticky, so I decided to go for a naked night swim which was totally relaxing. I also managed to get off on the water jet in my pool, but shhhh!  don't tell anyone!  So, all in all, it was an okay night.    Oh, almost forgot, I got on the internet last night and wanted to check on an apartment that I had found the night before.  Naturally the easiest way for me to find it is to use my internet history, so I am in history and I see the MSN history and slide my mouse over it.  You know, just enough for it to give you a description of it.  Well, the description was mailto:randomgoddess@hotmail.com.  Jenny.  That mother fucker had gotten on the computer after I went to bed on Tues night after we had a huge freaking argument and emailed that bitch.  I was royally pissed and called Travis, who is staying at a hotel, mind you, and blessed his ass out.  Then I cried.  All in all, I had a smoke, a beer, an orgasm, and a good nights sleep.  I don't think I have that much to complain about, huh?

      So, today is hump day.  Named so for the decline in the work week that follows.  But it sounds funny, doesn't it?  Hump Day.  A day for humping?   Don't I wish!   I get so frisky right before my cycle, my hormones are raging, and I.must.have.sex.  :)   So, while driving to work this morning I was listening to a little David Via & Corn Tornado.  I can't believe how good that record sounds.  That's right, they aren't records anymore.  I can't believe how good that CD sounds.  Better?  He is an amazing song-writer and I can't wait to see him at smilefest.  I'm really excited about this festival except for the fact that my ass will be dripping wet with sweat.  Man, I'm rambling this morning....Ok, so the Via song I was listening to brightened my day.  "It All Comes Down to a Song".  It does.  Life is just a song, its a story that we live.  Whatever happens in life must happen for a reason.  Today, the reason for me to be here is to be support for Robin.  Her mom had a brain aneurysm on Sunday and her family has to make the decision to pull the plug today.  Robin lost her only child last year and still hasn't fully recovered from that.  This is going to be  really  tough for her.  And although I barely know her, I want to be a strong support for her--she needs it right now.  wow.  That paragraph was sad.  Anyway, back to the subject at hand--HUMP DAY.  2 more days till the weekend.

      So today, I returned to work after a very relaxing long weekend.  Jules and I drove to Nashville on Friday after work and met up with Justin.  He's so sweet to drive in from Nashville and he always makes sure that we have a great time.  I was excited to see Erika, as it had been since last October since we had seen one another.  She was in a grumpy mood, but it was still good to see her.  Sunday I woke up feeling a bit depressed.  I really shouldn't be surprised, I have so much on my mind right now.  I guess that's why I am writing in this blog thingy--my first experience in online journaling.  Or any journaling for that matter.  I've always had someone to talk to about what was going on in my life, but now it seems as though I should just write for the sake of my own sanity.  So, Life goes on.  That's the title for today.  Life can't be filled with long weekends and escapes from reality.  People have to work to survive, unless you were born into a family that had worked and earned enough for you to not have to work.  But then, I can't really see myself in that lifestyle.  Nothing has ever come easy for me, luckily.  I wouldn't know what to do right now if it had.  Oh, by the way, my marriage is ending.  After 5 years, he decided he didn't want to be with me forever.  I'm not bitter--yet.  Just hurt and angry, but I am sure I will make my way down the ladder of emotions before it is over.  I've never been alone.  I've never lived alone.  I've never lived outside of my hometown (except for 2 months when I went away to school, but had to drop out because of a family emergency).  So, that's where I am now--trying to determine where to live, what to take, who to love and not to love anymore.  No one tells you that love is so hard and hurtful.  Don't get me wrong, I don't hate men, or the sanctity of marriage, I'm just still hurting.  The thought of waking up alone every morning scares me.  The thought of carrying groceries up two flights of stairs to lay on my kitchen sink in my crappy apartment fills me with joy (sarcasm, in case you didn't get it).  I do look forward to some things though.  Like cooking an egg sandwich for dinner or having cereal and not having to worry about someone else.  Being able to listen to  my  music as loudly as I'd like sounds nice too.    So, as I keep sorting out all of the details of my crazy life, I plan to journal here as the days pass by and my life goes on.

       Booker T. Washington:   I have learned that success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome while trying to succeed. Out of the hard and unusual struggle through which he is compelled to pass, he gets a strength, a confidence, that one misses whose pathway is comparatively smooth by reason of birth and race.   If you want to lift yourself up, lift up someone else.  I believe that any man's life will be filled with constant and unexpected encouragement, if he makes up his mind to do his level best each day, and as nearly as possible reaching the high water mark of pure and useful living.  What some call health, if purchased by perpetual anxiety about diet, isn't much better than tedious disease. --George Dennison Prentice  A good laugh is sunshine in a house. --Author Unknown   Women are the real architects of society.  urlLink Harriet Beecher Stowe  ( One of my Ancestors!)

      I can't believe it's only Tuesday. Getting up this morning, I could've sworn that it was at least Wednesday. I think I am going to go home and take a nap this evening. MMM.....sleep. I hope today gets busier because I am really getting bored at work. I am in between my busy weeks and my boss is on vacation. I am test wearing a bra today though. Finally wearing some of my product, which makes me a brand ambassador. I'm such a dork. Style 7530.  Ok enough about that crap. I listened to my new JGB last night during dinner. I cooked a bunch of spaghetti and Sarah and Bruce came over to eat dinner with me. It was nice. The dinner was fabulous. I am such a good cook sometime. ;)  Still not sure what I am going to do this weekend. Barefoot Manner is @ Ziggy's on Friday. I really wanna make the trip to Charlotte to see Jeff, but now that he's banging some flight attendant he is never at home! I really want to go kayaking again, but I'm too scared to go alone. Just because I've only been once before! I should keep my rear at home and get my office set up.  Ok, guess I better get some work done today...

      Well, my weekend was pretty good. Friday night, Travis came over and we did a little shopping, he drank some beer, and we hung out with Sarah, my neighbor. Saturday morning we had breakfast at the Cloverdale restaurant, which was very very good. The rest of Saturday, I just hung out at my place and then I went to Kathy's for dinner and drinks with Robin. It was fun hanging out with them even though there is a big difference in age between us all. Yesterday I drove back to Martinsville and picked up a few items that I had left behind. Had lunch at my mom's and played with my nephew and held my neice. It was good to see them and make them promise to come visit me.  A pretty relaxing weekend even though I still feel tired. This week should be pretty low-key. I'm seeing Barefoot Manner on Friday and next week is THE DEAD with Warren! I'm excited as hell for this show even though I still don't know who is coming with me.

      I really don't know where to begin with this post. I know when I get done writing I will feel better so I guess I'll just keep typing. I woke up this morning and laid in bed for an hour trying to find the strength to get up and face the day. I wanted to lay there in my mountain of pillows and warm sheets and cool breeze blowing accross my face. Although the windows were open, the blinds were shut and I was in a dark, comfortable place. I knew coming to work, I would have people asking me about last night, and how I was doing and I was right. The first person that asked me, I broke down in tears. Last night I think I was strong, made my point to the persons I needed to, and went home. Albeit I was propelled by liquid courage, I was proud of myself. It wasn't until this morning that it all sunk in. Seeing him with her and hearing him tell me that he might be going to Asheville this weekend with her, killed me. I left a voicemail for him last night and told him it would be much easier for me if he would just admit that he loves her. In his email this morning, he tells me he's sorry but he can't say that because they are just good friends.  I guess that's what hurts the most. It would be easier if he had found his soulmate and was experiencing a love that he's never felt. A small part of me could understand that. That is not the case though, I sit here wondering what about me doesn't he love, what about our marriage couldn't be worked on, and why was I at a show not speaking to the one person that I've spent 10 years of my life loving?  I know no one wants to read this depressing stuff, but I have to get it out. I've been sitting at my desk at work crying off and on all morning. As soon as my boss gets in, I'm probably going to go home. I just can't do it. Not today.

      Last night was fabulous. I had a great meal at Jules' house and got to hang out with some ever elusive friends, ahem, Joel. After dinner I went home and hooked up my new turntable! I found a lot of vinyl when I moved, but I didn't have any way to listen to it. So, I bought a turntable. The first album I listened to was Greg & Duane Allman from 1972. The cover of the album is white with like a pencil sketch of each of their faces. GREAT album. I went through the whole collection and pulled out a stack that is now my "must listen" to stack. Crazy mix of music granted, but it will be fun. I found a Weather Report album. I can't wait to hear that one. There was also some Herbie Hancock, more ABB, Janis Joplin, Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, Grand Funk, The Carpenters, Diana Ross, America, and even a Jerry Clower album. Does anyone remember him? He tells stories about growing up in the south. I can't wait to hear that and see how funny it is now. As I child, I guess I didn't get a lot of the jokes.  Anyway, I'm excited about the record player as you can see. Tonight is Big Daddy Bluegrass Band at Ziggys. Supposed to be a big work crowd going as well as Jules. I think I might have convinced the Jagels and Joel to come along too. My apartment is going okay, I finally hung some pictures and curtains. The washer and dryer was delivered yesterday, thanks to Travis's guilt, but I'll take it. I did a load of laundry yesterday afternoon, but still have TONS left to do. I might get a load done tonight before I go out. I'm sure whoever is reading this is thoroughly enjoying reading about my laundry. ;)  Ok, gonna go grab some more coffee! Might write more later if I can hop on while the boss is gone.

      Ok, so last night I made a complete ass out of myself and don't even remember everything I said or did.  Started out drinking Long Island Ice Teas at the bar with Mike and some other coworkers. Before long I was guzzling down tequila shots, coming on to Mike in the hallway to the bathrooms, rubbing on Robin's ass, and nearly picking up this black guy with a baby. *shrug*  So I went home after that, Robin and Chad followed me (it's only less than a mile), and I decided I wanted a beer for some godforsaken reason! I layed in my living room floor and then proceeded to call everyone in my phone book. I don't even know what I said on half of the people's voicemail, but I remember talking to Justin and Tim for a little while. I talked to Travis too, and of course ended up crying. Soon enough I'll be over it and won't make drunken phone calls to him anymore. Justin said I asked him to hold me and kiss me and tell me that everything was going to be okay.  When I finally decided to make my way to bed, I fell asleep rather quickly only to be in a dream world filled with strange tales. In the first dream, I was sitting in a park with my mom, sister, stepdad and I was holding a baby. I also had a balloon tied to my wrist. For some reason, someone called the police because they believed my balloon was hurting the baby. When the police were walking down the trail at the park, my step dad stood up and went into this big drainage pipe to stash his bag of ganja. Of course, the police saw him and they arrested him. They searched his house too, and found his stash and I remember waking up feeling as though my mom would surely be arrested.  My second dream of the night had me wading in the surf at the beach. It was a cold day because I was wearing pants rolled up and a sweat shirt. The sun was barely visible, so it must've been dusk. I was frollicking in the waves when the storm approached and I tried to find my way back to the house where I was staying, but I walked for miles and miles and couldn't find it. I took cover from the storm underneath a walkway extending from a house over the dune. I woke up terrified that lightning was going to strike me dead, and no one would find my body because the ocean would swallow me.  The meaning of these dreams eludes me. I know not to drink LI teas and Tequila before I go to bed though.

      I can't believe I thought packing could be any worse than actually moving. What was I thinking?!? I am extremely tired today both physically and emotionally. I moved both Friday and Saturday and spent most of yesterday just organizing my apartment. My first night in my place wasn't so bad. I have GREAT neighbors. They are in to music and are very sharing ;) Saturday night when Bruce got off work he knocked on my apartment and we hung out for a while. Had no idea he was gay, but he is and has just ended a 4 year relationship with his boyfriend. He seems to relate well to what I am going through right now. My mom and nephew came over Sunday. We went to Panera and got some sandwiches, layed a sheet out on my living room floor (my couch wouldn't fit inside my apartment!), and watched Willy Wonka. It was a great afternoon. We even have a picnic song that we wrote....it goes something like this:  Picnic sandwiches make no mess....shit, I don't remember it now. Anyway, after they left Travis finally called and I asked him if he could bring something out of my closet for me and well, he couldn't because he didn't freakin stay at home Saturday night. He stayed with her. I cannot begin to express the hurt that I felt and how irritated I was at him. I must've cried for an hour and my eyes are still puffy.  I needed the cry. I had kept all my emotions bottled up for the entire weekend and it was a good release. He must've felt guilty because he called me back to tell me that I am having a washer and dryer delivered Wednesday. Oh well......
