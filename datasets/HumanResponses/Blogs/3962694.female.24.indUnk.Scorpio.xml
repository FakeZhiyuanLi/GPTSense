       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am addicted to blogs!&nbsp; After reading my friend Beth and Cs's blog, I was intrigued...I had a site on diaryland, but after so much time of not logging in, it was dismanteled, so to say.&nbsp; Anyway, on Cs's page she has blogs that she reads, and lists as favorites or something like that, so I clicked on a few, and became addicted.&nbsp; How weird that I can get so excited about logging onto AOL to read about people's lives that I don't even know, and they don't even know that I exist!&nbsp; Weird, if ya ask me, but nonetheless, I am creating my own in hopes of someone's enjoyment in reading about my somewhat boring, but exciting life, to others...Let us begin shall we?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday I went shopping, imagine that, me shopping..ha.&nbsp; I got a dress for the rehersal dinner, an outfit for the bachelorette party and reception...If you don't know, I am in a wedding!!&nbsp; How exciting...It's for my friend Jamie, a friend that I've known about 20 years...What a great girl she is.&nbsp; Anyway, went to Wal*Mart afterwards, bought some fun stuff, I love that store, it always has cool little things around there...And of course, they always stare at me saying "buy me, buy me".&nbsp; Well I was a good girl, bought some scrapping stuff, and some other d0-dads, and I was out of there.&nbsp; I had today off, went and got my haircut and went into the store (work - CVS/Pharmacy) to see what was going on with the girls.&nbsp; I am a manager there (well, shift supervisor t0 be exact, but in about a year I'll have my own store as the manager).&nbsp; Anyway, that was about it, came home, ate dinner, talked to a few people, and scrapped for a few hours, I am working on something special, can't tell ya in case someone reads this, I don't want to spoil a surprise...It's getting kinda late, and I have an 11 hour work day tomorrow, so I am off to the bed.&nbsp; Sweet dreams r
