      Holy shit.  Could work  be  any more intense this week?  /chandler  I've got data from two new radars, an EMI sensor, a seismic sensor, new data from an old radar, a paper to write and about 30 other different bug fixes and tweaks to do.  It's insane.  In any case I've been a total pony all week, staying up late working, waking up late, working, etc...  It's like grad school all over again.  Although I di kind of feel like maybe I'm back in the tons and tons of work groove - which is a good groove to be in when you've got tons and tons of fucking work.    Weekend, where for art thou?

      Weekend == Eventful.  Usually my weekends are piles of the same old crap.  Technically, this weekend was a pile of the same old crap, too.  But for some reason it felt...  eventful .  First of all, went out Thursday.  For what reason, I forget.  Probably to get drunk.  Hit the B-side, River Gods, and the Middle East. Proceeded to driink my face off.  Similar story Fri. night except different bars... Pretty much Saturday is when shit gets interesting...  Iyad called me at noon to go  urlLink bouldering  with Sean Patrick Murphy.   urlLink Bouldering in New England  is supposedly really good.  We went to some place in Rhode Island right over the border.  Essentially, if you don't already know, bouldering is like rock climbing, except you never get far off the ground.  This makes it easier to bring hungover jackasses like myself and Iyad bouldering, because there isn't any real fear of death involved (as opposed to  urlLink rock climbing ).    So basically the thing with bouldering is that your goal isn't to get to the top of the rock fast.  Your goal is to take the hardest fucking path up the rock as possible.  Many of the "problems" actually have you start out sitting down - because if you were to stand up, well, that would just be easy, now wouldn't it?  So my out of shape ass spent all day saturday hanging from rocks about five feet off the ground, with only a tenuous grip, and a spotter.  This is more than I've done on a Saturday in a long long time.  Following that, my good friend from Texas came to town and we got shitty at the Middle East.  He opted to start macking on some cuties we met and invited them over to our table.  They sat down and we chatted for about 5 minutes before some douchebag donkey came over and decided he wasn't having this.   Douchebag : "What's up with you whores?"  Lady #1 (to texas friend): "This is our friend."  Austin Friend : "You ladies should kick his ass for talking to you like that."  Douchebag : (throws full white russian at texan)  Me : (stands holds douchebag back) "Yo, what the fuck?"  Douchebag : Chokes me.  Rest of the bar (including police officer) : Pulls douchebag off me.  Me, texan, friend : "Ladies, you need to re-evaluate your friends." (sit down, continue drinking)  The rest of the night slowly degenerated into a drunk fest at Iyad's place.  Drunk Fest.  Sunday we saw the Gauguin exibit at the MFA.  (Classy!)  That's it for the weekend.  Getting choked and climbing rocks are somewhat rare in my experience.  Managed to get two done in one day.

      I came up with the best fucking lyric yon wednesday in the shower, and now it's totally gone, like "poof".  It was so dope I was going to write it down once I got out of the shower, but it slipped my mind, and now I'll never get it back.  Fucktard.

      So I went to the 1369 coffee shop this morning to get nice refreshing ice-cold beverages for myself and my roommate (it's hot as balls here today).    When I walked in, I heard an effeminate voice say "Chatanooga?" and I saw a man clearly talking to me, and saying "Chatanooga".  I figured out that the last time I had been in the coffee shop he had asked me about the suit I was carrying, and I told him I was en route to Tennessee for a friend's wedding.  Nevertheless, the fact that this guy (A) remembered me and (B) the fact that he knew where I had been the previous weekend kind of startled me, since given a line up, I couldn't have told this guy apart from any of the other odd balls who hang out at a coffee shop at 11 on a Wednesday.  "Oh, yeah.  Chatanooga.  It was fun."  I mustered. "Good wedding?" "yeah, had some drinks." "You're looking a little scruffy today."    OK.  Now this is getting a little odd.  There's an unspoken rule about male conversations - unless you're my mom or my barber you don't comment on my facial hair.  Unless it's to say "that's a fuckin nice beard."  That's acceptable.  "A little scruffy"?  No good.  So it begins to dawn on me that this isn't your typical effeminate man sitting at the coffee shop counter at 11 on a Wednesday striking up conversations with customers.  "Yeah, I guess I'm getting lazy... I haven't... yeah."  I pretty much fell apart at this point. "Well, I  like  it." "Oh, um... thanks." And I quickly scuttled 5 feet down and ordered my 2 iced coffees.  Walking out I tried to be polite and said "have a good one."  He replied:  "You too,   beautiful  ."  Why does this kind of shit never ever happen to me with girls?

      Some new words we came up with shitfaced over the weekend:   pony : reminiscent of the suddenly overused "douchebag".  Someone who doesn't quite qualify as a true asshole, but is damn close.  Often more subtle than a true asshole.   donkey : asshole.  specifically, a dumb asshole.   faucet : Drip (think like the 50's - He's totally the bee's knees, but his girl is a total faucet.)

      Just watched Bubba Hotep last night.  If the idea of Elvis and JFK battling mummies in an east-texas nursing home sounds at all interesting to you, go see this flick.  If it doesn't seem interesting to you, go see something else.

      Hold on a second, people can fucking post comments about this shit?  I pray to the good lord jesus that no one ever sees this.  My friends would kick the living shit out of me if they knew I had a blog.

      Who is this pony who's starting a blog?  I don't even know what a blog is.  I'll write like personal stuff here, but then what if personal friends come and see it.  Then I'll be embarassed.  But otherwise, what do people write about?  I'm into like chess and math... that's not too cool.  I'm also dumb, and not funny.  Current events?  They just piss me off.  Actually, this pisses me off, too.  I'm out.
