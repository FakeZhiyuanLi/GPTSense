         It defines the music that you listen to. As if rock could never complement with hiphop. I just happen to like both, but not those baggy, oversized jerseys that go with their music.  It’s a neutral color. It’s sleek and formal enough for any event that I was pushed into. And it’s easy to blend in with any crowd.  It doesn’t have to signify the death of a loved one. Rather, it’s the mood that I’m in. When you are merely compelled to go about your daily tasks because it is what is expected of you.   It’s walking zombie-like in the mall or on the streets, mentally shrouding myself in a black cloak to be invisible to everyone. I’ve tried this trick many times and it actually works. I just need to concentrate a bit to lose myself in the crowd.  It’s the depth of words, the intense array of images that throb within, the constant confusion that’s fairly audible in the physical level, hence, it’s the signifying color for Dream and Death.

      Who would've thought...  That one can never have enough photos taken with all things going digital nowadays That going to the office can be like going to a playhouse  That watching movies and TV series can be a good diversion from work That writing is inherent, even if I have shunned it, I can't seem to escape from it That cafes also serve liquor..(thank you Segafredo!) That staring on your PC is a good way to doze off (..atleast you'd look busy)  That geeks can be a fascinating bunch provided you allow them to express their geekiness

         Keep it simple.  Does it concern me or do I want to be concerned?  If something’s amiss, I find out about it. If I don’t understand, I ask questions. If I don’t agree, I argue. And if I don’t want to concede, I say no.   The difference between the old timers and me is that they’re forced to give in to this environment whereas I chose to be in it. I had a fair idea of what I was getting myself into (work-wise). The old-timers already had their work attitude developed from their GP days and naturally, these changes can be a difficult thing to grasp.  Office politics.. it’s a given and I try to avoid it. I’m used to dealing with the top honchos head-on, which gave me plenty of headaches and perhaps a few lines on my forehead. I just want it plain for now.  So far, I’m still adjusting to this ‘rank-based’ structure. Life is attractively simple as a developer. I can spare myself from seeing the ‘big’ picture which often goes with bigger responsibilities.  So work is work. I try to be nice but I can’t help it if I end up being a strict taskmaster. I try to get along but I don’t have to get along well with everyone.   I try to keep an open mind. I’ll let you say whatever it is you want to say. But don’t expect me to always agree with you. And I don’t always have to have a say on your issues.

      Oras nang magkape, mananghalian, magmerienda Sa maliit na silid na parang pridyider sa lamig Ano naman kaya ang pwedeng pagusapan? Loner ka ba?  Hindi. Pero sa pagkain, ok lang. Mahirap kalabanin ang kalam ng tiyan.  Pasok si G.. at kanyang pinansin  Masarap pala talaga ang kape sa opisina Madalas lang ay luma ang umaabot sa ‘ming mga mahilig magtimpla Sumunod si T.. at sinimulang buklatin ang  takeout sa KFC Bakit nga ba kailangang pumunta? Nagulumihanan siya sa email, pati rin pala si J..  At ito ang nag-hudyat sa mga isyu na hindi ko pa narinig na pag-usapan subalit matagal ko na ring napag-isipan Sino nga naman ang mag-aakala Magaling silang maglibang subalit sa tulad ko na marami nang pinagdaanan Hindi na rin ako nagulat sa kanilang mga paratang Subalit ano naman kaya ang patutunguhan? Di kaya ito isang kwentong barbero lamang?

      Cycles. I'm an old soul. I've gone through many lifecycles. Not much has changed but I do believe my world expands everytime.  Time. It teaches us many things. The mere presence of it helps us explore new grounds. The lack of it makes us overlook so many little and yet important things.  Conversations. I've had so many conversations with myself and it went on far too long. Recently, I understood the significance of having a real talk. This means that the people doing the dialogue are actually listening to one another. Otherwise, it's just talk-- empty and meaningless. How many times have I done this? Perhaps endless.. Manila's society taught me theimportance of doing just that..Talk, to mindless or unmindful people. It's quite easy to go on and on every night because people can actually find you charming for that. But then, if you begin talking sensibly, then you'd be dismissed even before you know it.  Dreams. I'm so full of it.. Always hoping and always seeing things whether or not they should be.   Colors. They're my everyday adventures. For a time it were the many trips that I had. It's trying out new things that people would only talk about but never actually did. And then the colors became distinct with the many personalities that I've met. They have brought me to the heights and angles of human emotions. I could never get enough of it I suppose.  Carpe Diem! Home is where the heart is. Love is the only real magic and these words are mere expressions of the truth for reality can never be fully captured by ink.

      Kailangang magsimula. Kwentong makalilibang.  Subalit papaano mo pipigain ang utak na hindi naman bihasa sa nakangiting lathala. Bakit hindi subukan. Naaalala mo pa ba? Si Tino yung Bikolano mong kaeskwela. Noong una’y nahalintulad mo siya sa isang karakter na pambata. Yung batang mahilig lumipad at hindi tumatanda. Natuwa ka sa kanya at sa mga sulat niya.  Pahingi naman ng papel. Gawan kita ng drawing.  Lumipas ang taon. Pagsapit ng bakasyon, naiwan ka sa Maynila. Marahil sa sobrang pagkabagot, sa init ng panahon o sa ingay ng mga pulitiko, naisipan nyong magpalitan ng selyo. Kamusta na? Bungad ng una niyang sulat. Siya’y tumutulong sa pagkokopra nilang mag-anak. Minsa’y lumalangoy siya sa ilog, kasama ang mga pinsan at kababata. Ika’y nagulat, natuwa at nalibang. Sino nga naman ang mag-aakala.

      Life is like going to the gym. The most painful part is deciding to go. After that, it's easy.   And it's a wonderful feeling afterwards. :)

      A friend asked me to take this   urlLink quiz   and here's what I got upon answering all 36 questions.  I'm an Intrapersonal thinker... meaning:  I spend a lot of time thinking about and trying to understand oneself. (I think I've gone pass this stage already. I got tired of it i guess. Now I only think about walking along the woods, riding a chopper, having a room built on top of the sea, a full moon lighting our beach camp, being on top of a mountain, lounging on the asotea while tracking the stars, feeling warm on a cold Baguio peak, etc...)  I reflect on my thoughts and moods, and work to improve them. (I try to be passive. I now realize that I am what i choose to be. I do not dwell on ill feelings, ill thoughts.)  I understand how my behaviour affects my relationships with others. (Damn if you do. Damn if you don't. I have seen how my actions stir up the awkwardness, the uncertainty, the fear amidst my circle.  Other Intrapersonal thinkers include  Sigmund Freud, Gandhi, Grahame Greene  Careers which suit Intrapersonal Thinkers include Psychologist, Teacher, Pilot, Child Care worker, Explorer, Drama therapist (A few years from now, I'm most likely to be in Child Care, either caring for my own born or perhaps running a day care. But for now, I'm bound to be the Explorer.)  Here are the nine thinking styles that the quiz has to offer: 1. Logical-Mathematical thinkers 2. Linguistic thinkers 3. Interpersonal thinkers 4. Intrapersonal thinkers 5. Naturalist thinkers 6. Existential thinkers 7. Musical thinkers 8. Spatial hinkers 9. Kinaesthetic thinkers

      It started as a fad. I was a college senior, savoring our last months in school. My peers began cajoling me to spend a night with them at a nearby bar. It was a night of many firsts. I was young and we were having fun. When I showed up in class the next day, I knew I was different. I felt a bit unruly. Then I began cutting classes.  Graduation came and went. I was labeled ‘yuppie’ although I never quite understood what it really meant at the time. I merely went were everyone else was flocking to. For a time I thought I enjoyed dancing, only to realize that I needed at least a shot of tequila to have fun on the dance floor. It was always exhausting afterwards.  For years, I shared many long evenings with just a handful of people. We shared many thoughts, from relationships, angst, to philosophies, debated on religion, existence and discovered many other things together.  Those were the nights which I hoped would never end. We all felt lost and consoled ourselves with one another. Somehow, not everyone understood. The night embraces those who are lost, hurt or are abandoned.  Work got all mixed up with my nightlife. I learned how to enjoy cocktails, attend dinners and have nightcaps. I worked better at night, especially when I was doing my writings. For a time, I couldn’t distinguish the difference between partying and working. The places and people that used to dazzle me now became common as I swang from one new place to another. It was too common that it became part of my lifestyle.  It burned me out. I thought drastic changes would do me good so I shifted from my usual path. Hence, I took up my Masters.  Except for Saturdays, we only have night classes in Grad school. I enjoy taking long walks to or from class since our building is within a residential area, away from the main hustle of the city. And when the pressures of finishing the degree began to arise, I found myself chilling out in bars, once again. Only this time, I didn't feel lost anymore.  Once again, the nights were long, but it no longer engulfed me. I was meeting people, and was actually enjoying their company. I learned how to socialize.. for real this time and not because I had to.

      Surviving Metro Manila traffic is an everyday challenge for whoever's crazy enough to traverse it. There are pot holes, vendors, defunct traffic lights, pedestrians and worse, Public Utility Vehicles or PUVs, all crammed up in the narrow, old streets of Manila. I never realized how awful it can really get out there until I began commuting to work.  Testimonials from my driving friends, or simply the rants and ravings that they mutter while driving made me conclude that PUVs are not only an eye sore, but are major traffic deterrents as well. Sure, it's not easy to do away with them since 90% of the Metro's residents (including me) don't have their own cars. But their lack of road discipline, especially with the loading and unloading of passengers, are such a menace to other cars on the road, that it's often the cause of bottlenecks and accidents. And because of the apparent disarray that they project in their driving skills and habits, a Metro Manila driver would then have to adapt to his fellow driver's ways in order to survive.   So as we endure the daily hassles of city driving, why not do something about it? Since drivers play a major role in this, my sister conjured the idea of educating the PUV drivers since they obviously are not aware of the mess that they make. I toyed around with it and ended up with a proposal (an after-effect of my marketing days).   Project Name: PUV Refresher's Class Objectives:  - To educate PUV drivers in proper driving and road etiquette. - To help PUV drivers understand their role on the street & the significance of their livelihood - To identify the people that affects their livelihood (ex. MMDA, commuters, police and traffic aides, LTO, colorums, etc.) - To review basic driving skills & to understand road courtesy - To gain feedback from PUV drivers on their concerns & views on driving the streets of Metro Manila  Target Market: C/D  Mechanics:  1. Find classrooms. Consider public schools. 2. Schedule several dates for the class.  It can be a quarterly event. 3. Consider enlistment via phone to control the number of students. 4. Get volunteer instructors (from driving schools, volunteer groups, NGOs etc.). 5. Develop a lesson plan, AV materials, exam, feedback forms, etc. that will be used by all instructors for consistency. 6. Coordinate with PUV groups/ associations, local government to encourage drivers to enlist. Transport companies may consider this as part of their employee training. 7. Media promotion.  Suggested Sponsors:  1. Oil & Gas companies 2. Automotive & car accessory dealers  3. Fastfood 4. Driving/ Technical schools 5. F&B companies 6. MMDA, DOT, LTO & other related government agencies 7. Car repair shops & service stations.

       Pumunta 'ko sa National Bookstore&nbsp;kahapon para bumili ng kard at para doon ko na rin antayin si&nbsp;Ate. Sa kahihintay, nakita ko&nbsp;yung "The Last Temptation of Christ"&nbsp;ni Nikos Kazantsakis.&nbsp;Isa 'to&nbsp;sa mga&nbsp;nobela&nbsp;na pinagpilian namin nung nag-major ako ng Lit.&nbsp;Yun kasi yung 1st choice ko sa pag-report.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaya lang sabi ni Ma, na-ban&nbsp;raw yung&nbsp;libro dito sa Pinas nung panahon ni Marcos, kaya bagama't hindi ko siya nahanap noon, hindi pa rin nawala ang pagka-intriga ko dito.   Tumungo ako sa Powerbooks dahil alam kong meron din sila nito.&nbsp;Atsaka naalala kong meron nga pala akong Track Card, para masulit naman. Malay mo mapuno ko rin yun!&nbsp;Magiging Powerbooks Club member ako kung nagkataon.&nbsp;May isa kasi akong ka-opisina na nakapuno na nung Track Card. Siya yung geek na mahilig sa collectibles&nbsp;tulad ng&nbsp;books, CDs and toys.   Sa tagal ko sa Powerbooks, napabili pa ko ng&nbsp;dalawang&nbsp;libro ni Bob Ong, ABNKKBSNPLAKO at Bakit Baligtad Magabasa ang mga Pinoy. Ipapadala ko yun sa States.&nbsp;Bukas na alis ng pinsan ko papuntang US&nbsp;para dumalo sa kaarawan ng Daddy niya.   Nagsimula nang kumalam ang tiyan ko. Mag-aalasiete na kasi ng gabi, wala pa ring text mula kay Ate. So tumambay muna ko sa Children's section. Matagal ko na kasing balak kolektahin yung Chronicles of Narnia ni C.S. Lewis. 7 books yon and around P1500 yung isang set ng mga small na paperback edition. Gusto ko sana yung mas malaking version&nbsp;pero hindi naman kumpleto yung nakadisplay.   Naku! Medyo nahihilo na ko! Ang tagal ni Ateee!!! Tapos, bigla nag-ring yung celfon ko. Paalis na sila ng carpark, daanan na lang daw ako para iabot yung pictures. Siempre naimbyerna ako kasi, buong akala ko eh magkikita kami ni Ate para tulungan ko siyang pumili ng mga pictures. Susmaryosep! I was really pissed off kasi ang tagal niya kong pinag-antay. Sana pinadaan na lang niya ko sa office niya para hindi nasayang oras ko!     Arrggghh!!! So the moral of the story is... ay ewan! Basta alam ko, nalilibang ako sa bukstor. Ok lang sa kin and magpalipas oras dun. Yun nga lang, madalas eh napapabili ako o di kaya, humahaba yung listahan ko ng mga "must have" na libro. Kung sa ibang tao, sa damit, sapatos o CD&nbsp;sila nagsusunog ng pera, ako sa libro.

      "And you've been so busy lately  That you haven't found the time  To open up your mind  and watch the world spinning  gently out of time  Tell me I'm not dreaming  We're running out of time"&nbsp;  (Artist:Blur)  &nbsp;  I've been&nbsp;playing this over and over&nbsp;at work and sometimes, I can't help but ponder on the reality&nbsp;behind the lyrics.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  What I like about our office is that we have floor to ceiling windows&nbsp;throughout&nbsp;the entire floor. We got a good view of&nbsp;Buendia,&nbsp;SLEX as well as the bay area. I can even see the PLDT tower from here.  &nbsp;  Anyway, it's quite often that I catch my officemates staring out by the window. Sometimes I wonder what goes on inside people's heads when they're doing that. When I'm the one looking yonder, I'd often think back on the times when&nbsp;I watched the world spin... through&nbsp;the 360 degree view&nbsp;on top of Pico de Loro, the neverending tides&nbsp;of Mindoro, the approaching storm at Zambales, the rising of the great big&nbsp;moon in Batangas, the&nbsp;mysterious air&nbsp;in Banahaw, the wonderful shades of trees in my numerous&nbsp;trekking exploits, an so on and so forth.  &nbsp;  Maybe I did have the chance to watch the world spin. Although I must admit, those four years at Jewelmer passed by like a breeze. I don't even know how I managed to survive and surpass those&nbsp;years.  &nbsp;  They say that I'm just using the job that I have right now as a breather. Maybe, maybe not but when Jas&nbsp;laid&nbsp;this out to me explicitly,&nbsp;it absolutely made sense.  &nbsp;  I've seen&nbsp;plenty of rifts&nbsp;after college. Friendships were put to&nbsp;test, families grew, morality questioned, tragedy struck me quite a few times and yet, I'm still here welcoming each new day.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I used to have so many questions and craved for all the answers.&nbsp;My quest for knowledge although diluted is still quite insatiable.   "Tell me I'm not dreaming. We're running out of time." There is so much to see, so much&nbsp;to&nbsp;explore, be it&nbsp;mundane&nbsp;or esoteric. To live&nbsp;fully and well.. blame me not for&nbsp;the&nbsp;diversity of my interests and&nbsp;the&nbsp;multitude of my&nbsp;thoughts.

       "Put your affairs in order colonel..  &nbsp; ...grasp that power and control it!"   &nbsp;  Akira is the ultimate energy.&nbsp; It is the source of energy and knowledge.&nbsp; Humans, and every little creature that exist have incredible amounts of energy inside them. That energy gives us the power to build things and this power is inherent in us, it's within our memory.  &nbsp;   "What if everyone shares those memories and what if something shakes up that memory?"   &nbsp;  Man's search for power ultimately leads to his own destruction.&nbsp; It's&nbsp;history&nbsp;repeating itself over and over.. be it in textbooks, popular fiction or in this case, Japanese animation.  &nbsp;  The likes of Akira&nbsp;and Neon Genesis Evangelion, contemporary anime flicks traversing on the obscure, playing with&nbsp;bizarre philosophies and the common faults of man, attacking fundamentalist beliefs and rationals.&nbsp; Such creativity and profundity, often wrapped in futuristic settings&nbsp;are intertwined in a visual spectacle of art in film.&nbsp;&nbsp;And they're definitely not for minors.&nbsp; &nbsp;  When I was&nbsp;younger,&nbsp;I never could follow the entire story because it was probably too much for my puny head, or because they stopped showing the rest of the episodes.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are plenty of insightful messages in the vast world of anime although not everyone may be&nbsp; mature enough to understand them.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it's quite disheartening to see how the stories reflect so much of the truth behind today's&nbsp;society. Watching them now makes me feel&nbsp;hopeful, privileged and still, entertained.&nbsp;

      I was in SM Lucena last Saturday with my ten year old niece. We were at ToyKingdom, going through every interesting item that they had on the shelves. She showed me the toys that she like while I get to point out some of the toys that my officemates collect and display in the office. Then I saw rocket launchers that were exactly like the ones that we had in the office.   The rocket itself is made of foam and is lunched by air that is generated by a simple movement of the plastic stick. I went in full detail as to how it works and how much fun we had in the office as we aimed and fired the rocket. She was probably so taken in by my enthusiasm that she ended up pleading for me to buy it for her.   I explained the impracticality of the purchase. I reminded her that she can't have objects flying around inside the house. She said that she'll be playing with it only in school. They're allowed to bring one toy every Friday in school. (Kids..they sure can reason well!)  Well, I really didn't plan to buy anything there since we were just there to meet my sister. Of course that caused her a bit of frustration. The next day though, I ended up buying her a Disney video, 'Lilo and Stitch', just to make up for the rocketlauncher.

      It amuses me to see how people allow themselves to fall prey to trends, ads and gimiks that flood our city. Most spend at least a month's salary just to get the latest cellphone unit even if they can't figure out how to use all of its features. Some thinks it's cool to be seen in private parties or the popular bars in town. There are those who find it chic to pay at least P100 just for a cup of coffee at trendy cafes. People flock to the malls for a weekend sale.. ever noticed how stores go on sale every payday weekend? And don't forget the fashion victims!  Maybe it's because they don't want to feel left out. Or they're not confident enough that they allow trends and fads to define themselves. Or are they really that clueless?  All this superficiality, brand-consciousness and labeling.. is really just a big LIE! I pity those who allow themselves to be brainwashed by advertisements. However, I'd give a big thumbs up sign to those people behind the 'trend-making' business coz that means they're doing a great job. But for people who take these ads, trends as gospel truth..??   I've done Marketing and Advertising work for at least four years and that has stripped away the influence of ads and trends on me. I can still recall how we created the need for our products. We made a lot of 'conditioning' for our market which eventually, grew. And that's good business for us.  I don't see anything wrong with wearing the latest in fashion, having the 'cool' gadgets or partying in trendy places. I just think it's stupid to be, do or have something just because it's cool.  To be cool is to be confident of who you are.  It's not allowing trends and advertisements to tell you who you ought to be.

      "Can I avoid temptation?"  "Of course. You're always free to choose, or make your own decisions."  "What if freedom is taken away from me"  "Physical freedom may be taken away from you but not your free will."  I wanted to explain to him the concept of 'free will'. That we are what we make of ourselves. That despite the limitations being set on us, we can still make the most of what we have.  Then it dawned on me. I'm talking to a boy who's barely 14 and has been forced by his parents to move into a different country, a different school and different household. He once said that his life is in Macau. I also found out that he has a girlfriend there.  Well, I realized that I can't go philosophical on my nephew, so I had to be more like a big sister. Often, I just listened and if necessary, i then share my thoughts and experiences hoping that the younger mind would understand the life lessons that I've learned. But our conversation was cut short. Eventually though, I found out that he's already keeping himself busy here even if he's only been around for two weeks. He's now part of the varsity basketball team and I think he had no problems making new friends.  I'm sure there's still plenty of adjustments for everyone in the house that we share in the province. He's my cousin's son and is a newcomer in my parents' household where a brother and sister, children of my other cousin, have also moved into a year ago.   Going home to the province is like going to a retreat. I get to talk my elders and share their thoughts on life as a grown up. I also get to reflect on my childhood and my growing up years as I relate with my nephews and nieces. Sometimes it's a bit tiring because I need to make the most out of my short stay there. Upon returning to Manila, it's back to the superficial, fast-paced routine of city-living.

       True friends can grow separately without growing apart.   I was chatting with my friend Marj the other day and she asked me if I have a female bestfriend whom I had for years. When I said yes, she then asked if there ever came a time when I felt that our friendship seems to be deteriorating. I said "Of course!". I even thought we’d end up hating each other’s guts.  I can’t remember exactly how it all started. I’m never good with memories anyway, especially bad ones. What I do recall is that when she left for the US, we were in bad terms. But before she left, she personally delivered a goodbye letter to my house. I wasn't home then, and was still in pain. I vaguely remember the letter, perhaps it didn't mean much back then. I thought it was the end of our friendship.  Months passed and lo and behold, i received a hello card from her. The mail was actually quite thoughtful since emails were already in vogue. And it came to a point that it was up to me to decide wether or not I'd want to be friends with her again. We talked, listened and heard each other out. A dialogue is important in true friendship. Eventually, of course, we managed to patch things up.    I guess humility, honesty, support and understanding helped a lot. 'Expectations' were probably what caused the rift. But we've gone passed that and despite the distance, and the changes in our lifestyles, we managed to remain friends. We're even closer now than before.  She returned to Manila sometime last year with her husband, and is now nursing their first born. Come Sunday, July 18, 2004, I'll be godmother to their daughter Iya.  We've been through a lot Thet and I. And I'm always amazed and grateful to see how far our friendship has brought us. We may be living different lives right now, but we both know that we're always there for each other no matter what.

      It's become enjoyably chic for my young colleagues to read books and appreciate leafy salads. Most of the first time readers were influenced by the rage on Dan Brown's works. Now I'd get to exchange thoughts with them.. which is more interesting that the usual chatter. Here are some of my recommended must-read titles for readers of the yuppie age:   Angels and Demons  by Dan Brown It's much better than the 'Da Vincci Code'. It's witty and fast-paced.   American Gods  by Neil Gaiman This I've yet to read but the author I already like from his Sandman series.   The Little Prince  by Antoine de Saint Exupery Life's profundities are simplified and expolained from the a child's point-of-view.   Who Moved My Cheese  by Toni Morrison A very short, and insightful read on personal success.   Rich Dad, Poor Dad  by Robert Kiyosaki Mind-opening. Practical advice on financial stability.   Harry Potter  books by J.K. Rowling A good read. It gets more interesting, chivalrous and dark as the boy grows up.  Salad for lunch was an offshoot of the slim-trim vendetta of the noticeably heavy members of the Panda family in our team. We now experiment on dressings and leafy combinations.  Recommended dressings: Vinegrette and French dressing Recommended extras for the green salad: hard-boiled egg (white only), tomatoes, olives, apples and grilled chicken breast.

      Fate leads you to where your heart is. This list is inspired by the movie,  A Walk To Remember .   Go to Paris  There’s something about Paris that draws me towards it. Sartre, Hugo, Gidé and Rice helped me appreciate the history, complexity and familiarity of the place.   Skydive  It’s the closest that I could get to flying.   Live in a foreign land  Change, though hard, often ends up being in favor of me. It’s always a challenge to  traverse and survive the unknown.   Learn French  I like the language. I’m simply intrigued by it.   Drive in Manila  It’s the ultimate test for a cooped up passenger.
