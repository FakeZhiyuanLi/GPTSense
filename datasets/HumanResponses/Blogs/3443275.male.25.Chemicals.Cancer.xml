      Why does everyone take on a hushed tone when saying something they think they shouldn't?  If you don't have enough conviction in what you're about to say, DON'T FUCKING SAY IT!  Now to follow that up, I'll fess up and admit that I've done it to.  The difference is when I do it I'm surrounded by obsverent mother fuckers with a talent for using biting sarcasm that can actually cause physical pain.  Why hang out with these people, you say?  Well in answer to your question that you didn't ask: the reason is simple, I'm just not going to share it with you.  I've digressed enough, back to the point at hand.  A prime example of this horrible habit happened the other day.  I was in the car with my brother and good friend Bren....za.....bah.  We were coming back from a concert which is another story in and of itself.  We saw a car full of arab-types, with thier hats which have a name that I haven't bothered to learn, and brenzabah makes a comment which I don't remember because it wasn't about me, and I sayed, in a hushed tone,"sleeper cell."  He laughed and nodded his agreement then pointed out that we were going 70 mph down the road and they had there windows up and why the hell was I whispering.  Score one for Brenzabah.  Really I'd like to think that in another time and place they might find my comment funny....I sure did.
    
As I write this I realize that was a racist remark....the whole thing, about the hats and them being terrorists and all.  I'm feeling a little guilty....no, wait...indegestion, yup I'm feeling indegestion.  Now what I really do feel guilty about is the central fact that although this little rant sounds like it has a point, it actually does not, and I feel guilty about that, nope....indegestion again, sorry.  What I should feel guilt about is that I'm an asshole and feel no guilt.  Now thats something to feel guilty about.....if I could.  I know not everyone can understand the feeling of guilt an asshole gets when he doesn't feel guilty when he's supposed to, but I also know that everyone reading this can understand it, because you're all assholes.....and by all I mean both.  I apoligize for my overuse of the word guilt in this story.......guilt.

      So where was I....was what I was asking myself Sunday morning.  Do you know that feeling you get right before you wake up?  Its a feeling of security because you know exactly where you are.  This feeling is horribly ripped away when you wake up after a black out, its terrible.  There's an instant when you wake up and your eyes are still closed and you think your in your bed.  All of a sudden "KERRBLAMO" you realize your in the most awkward position ever on someone else's couch and your ass hurts, please ignore that last part....ahem.  
  
The worst part of losing time when drinking is losing time when drinking.  It would be much less frightening if you lost time while sleeping, no ones ever done anything stupid or embarrassing while sleeping and you don't have to turn to a friend to find what the hell happened.....unless your ass hurts.  Its only happened to me twice in all my years of drinking and this time everything appeared to be o.k.  But the last time there were  several unexplained clues as to what may have happened and yet no one was able to figure it out.  I'll give you the clues and you see what sort of scenario you can put together, it'll be fun....like a game, just don't judge me.  I wake up on a friends couch fully clothed minus one sock, the magazines on the back of the toilet are knocked off, the shower curtains pulled over and my missing sock is next to the toilet soaking wet....what-the-fuck?
  
On a separate note, Charisma Carpenter's on the cover of Playboy, and holy crap its exactly what you expect.  She is so damn hot....wow.  I have to go touch myself.......sexually.

      Why do I have such a love/hate relationship with Mr. Jose Cuervo?  I cuss him out on every shot and yet still I keep going back.  I went to a party the other night with a friend....we'll call him Nash..in...son, yes Nashinson(names have been changed to protect the innocent).  When we arrived at the party it was very apparent that we were the token white and black man.  How is this, you say?..well I'll tell you, asians have to have fun too(dude there's like a trillion of them.....most of them were in this apartment).  Side note: asian girls are uber hot.  As soon as we arrive we down a couple coronas, cause thats how we do.  Around beer three I realize Mi...ahem Nashinson is drinking slower then normal...not true I was drinking faster he was.  This is never a good sign....ever(seriously he's an alcoholic....really there's something wrong with him......he may not be human).  We proceed to look for something to drink.  At first glance there's nothing that would be palatble to seasoned alcoholics.  When what to my wondering eyes does appear, hey its cuervo....tremble in fear.  Yes a bottle of cuervo...untouched and rightly so.  After all, asians are smart...you've heard the stereotypes.  Nashinson promptly declares this bottle ours and we belly up for our first shot of the night, a few minutes later another and so on in that fashion.  We ended up killing the bottle with no help from our eastern brothers...at least i think we killed it.  Last memory I have is Nashinson holding up the bottle and asking, "Who wants the last shot?" NEXT TIME:Thats your classic black-out.....

      I edited my profile, check it out. It's very informative.  I mean not...not informative.  Anywho, I just got done eating a pantload of tacos and I don't think I feel so good.  I wish I had a beer, hold on.....back from the fridge with a can of miller lite in hand.  Some dreams do come true.  Why do all the low calorie products use the word "lite"?  Lite's not a fucking word.. it's made up, does-not-exist.  But its everywhere, oh well.    Normally I could turn out a few paragraphs on my anger about this lie perpetrated on the american public, but the tacos took the fight outta me.  I went to see the spiderman sequel at a midnight showing last night, which means I saw it before all of you and that makes me feel special.  I had never seen the first one so we watched it right before we left, it worked out quite well.  For those of yoiu who have not seen it, Spiderman dies.  Hey don't call me a fuckin liar!  How dare you?!  
  
I'm watching this movie with Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington, there piloting a nuclear submarine.  I don't know what its called, but its pretty damn good.  My legs hurt, I played basketball today with Mike and Brendan.  Brendan pretty much took us to school, but he's in for a big surprise once we've had a little practice and get our skills back.  A big surprise...sexually.  Sorry, that was inapropriate.  I'm tired, I can't seem to hold a line of thought in my head for more than a couple of sentences.  I know you noticed.  In closing, do drugs, rape sluts, blah blah blah.....

      Alright, I'm trying to go back to school in august right.  One of the things you need to accomplish this are your transcripts from high school.  If you're just exiting high school this is no problem, you just walk your stupid ass to the school and pick them up, however if you are four or more years out of high school like my stupid ass, it gets a little bit more involved.  Its like a test of your patience and resolve to go back to school.  Its like they're saying,"Hey lets see if he really wants to go back to school.  Lets really fuck with his head a little bit and run him around, but we've got to make it look easy so he'll keep chasing the damned wild goose."  Fuckers.  First I went to the old stomping grounds at parkville.  I walk up to the desk and the lady at the desk is eyeing me up like, what the hell do you want.  Meanwhile, in my head, I'm thinking,"Bitch, I'm not one of these students, and if you keep looking at me this way, I'm going to reach across this counter and rip your throat out....then eat it."  So I put on the cold, expressionless stare that seems to freak people out sometimes( especially the ones who think you're going to be the one to back down from their rudeness), I ask my questions, get the appropriate number to call, and have the enjoyment of seeing her gulp a few times and stop making eye contact.
   
Now the insanity really begins.  I call this number that I've been promised will yield my stupid, stinking transcripts.  Next I listen to a drawn out message giving me options, I choose the correct one and listen to another drawn out message......FUCK!  I know it doesn't seem like that big of a deal, but I have no patience you see.  Now this lady on the phone is saying that I can either submit my request in writing or log on to the public school's website, awesome.  I get onto the website and look around for a while until I find the only thing about transcripts.  Its a document....um, yeah.  I don't need a fucking document, damn it, I need some sort of option to have my transcripts sent to me.  At this point I see only two options: read the document, or put my fist through the computer.  Its not my computer, so I opt to read the document.  It says to obtain the transcript I have to mail my request in writing and wait ten days, this sounds familiar, but I'll read on.    It also states that, and this is where they got me, that I can pick them up in person by calling a number, then I assume, going to pick them up, fine...sounds good, or does it.  
    
Now I'm calling the number and listening to a long drawn out message giving me options, I choose my option and now am listening to another long..drawn out.....messa....WAIT JUST A DAMN SECOND.  I compare my number obtained from the website and the one from the school and yeah, they're one and the same.  At this point, my turrets kicks in for a little while, the dogs hiding in the corner and the birds have stopped chirping.  I'm insane at this point listening to the message on the phone, I've got it memorized, and searching through the website, hoping I've missed something...I haven't.  Whatever I'll just submit it in writing and wait two stupid weeks for it to come in the mail.  Thanks for letting me get that off my chest.

      My younger brother asked me to go to Six Flags last weekend, I love theme parks.  Anywho, he wanted to go to the one in New Jersey, cause everything's better there(the Six Flags, not New Jersey).  He had to get his season pass activated at the one in Bowie....hang in there, the story picks up, so we're in Bowie, he's got his new season pass and we're on our way back.  I see a car full of girls drive by and turn to my brother and say,"Hey was that a car full of girls?  You should wave to them."  He does, they wave back, and now we're both waving like a couple of retards on the side of the road waving at random cars(like DiCaprio in What's Eating Gilbert Grape).  We pull up to a red light and Bren...ahem Brenzaba says "Hey, one of them is running up here."  I wasn't real sure what he said when I looked out my window and saw this cute ass chick in a bikini top and short skirt.  I frantically begin trying to roll down the window, much to my chagrin, my brother has power windows(so stupid).  Upon getting the window down, I hear,"You guys want to go to a pool party."  What the hell?  So know I'm looking around for cameras, cause I'm sure I've just wandered onto the set of some teen movie or something.  Finding no cameras, I say yes and we drive to the nearest gas station to get phone numbers and directions.  I get out of the car and wait for Brenzaba for a second before I realize, he's pumping the gas on the other side of the truck, that chicken shit, now I've got no wing man...Damned!  I've got to do all the talking now, anyone who knows me and how much I love my voice, knows this is not a problem.  The problem comes not with talking, but with avoiding saying something(too many ings in this sentence...ing) that will screw up an already foregone conclusion.  Long story short its three cute chicks in the car, they all love sarcasm, which is good because if they didn't I would've screwed it up for sure, we went to a pool party in Annapolis that night and had a good time, and later on that week I got to write this run-on sentence about it which doesn't seem to have an end in sight, it just keeps on going.
    
On another note, Six Flags in New Jersey does kick ass.  Superman is an awesome ride(the roller coaster, not the man...so gay).  They also have the tallest and longest ride on the east coast, which we didn't get on until last, when it was dark.  One of the coolest experiences ever, it's so fast and the only lights are small ones on the track...very cool.
    
On yet another note....I'm a pimp, Jackie Chan's awesome(screw you Mike)and so is turret's.

      Since when is 9:30AM the middle of the night? Well you may be surprised to find out, it's not. Sure feels like it right now though. I drank some beers and hit the cuervo with Mike last night (and this morning) to appease the deadly beast that skulks inside.  The beast loves his cuervo. My eyes feel like they're bleeding. I'm going back to sleep.....

      I called Matt last night to go get something to drink. The beast was once again awoken from his fitful slumber because I was opening multiple beers while bartending yesterday. Much to his chagrin none of the beer hit his cavernous mouth. He was angered and threatening to eat me from the inside out. I had two choices as I saw it: drink some alcohol or die and unleash the beast upon the well meaning villagers. The villagers haven't done anything to deserve the beast's wrath, so a-drinking I did go. Besides, I like the alcohol as much as the beast, perhaps more(mental note: Who's the real beast?). Matt has this friend who opened a bar last night. It was named after him,"Floppy's," or "floppy's," or something like that, I don't know. It's not in a bad location, right between Fells Point (drinking capitol of Baltimore) and Boston St.(drinking capitol for Baltimore's well-to-do). The ambiance is pretty cool, only two major complaints. The first is that the bar stools are too low, you're forced to rest your arms on the bar, that's fine for now but when ...If it starts getting busy that bars gone get sticky and you don't want that on your arms....At all. The second complaint, where's the air conditioning? It was hot as Hades up in that bitch, if they weren't so big I'd have sweat my balls off. Dave dropped by with his hot ass girlfriend that just cheated on him not two weeks ago, she's really hot and apparently has him by his balls. We ended up going to the Ritz to look at boobies, dave's girlfriend Kara has a room mate that dances there, so we got in for free. We almost got into a fight with a couple guys, I'm not sure why, but lately the almost getting into a fight thing has been becoming less infrequent. It's coming to a head, someone's getting hurt soon. I'm torn between wanting to see how many people I can tear apart and not wanting to hurt anyone. Quite the conundrum.     Going to O.C. this weekend, all four of the Deadly Venoms will be assembled. Zaniness  will  ensue.  Adam's girlfriend will be down there, so that may tame him a little, it also may not.  More next week bitches.    
    Next week: Tales of drinking and debauchery from the poor man's tourist destination!

      Good times. I found out how to add links to my shit and also how to put a counter on this thing-thing. When I say that I "found out," I mean Mike told me how to do it. I also registered my shit on google we'll see what happens with that in days to come. I actually pulled my shit up in a google search already, before I registered, but there was no description of my blog so there weren't any keywords to pull it up, you'd have to actually enter my url exactly, and that's more than likely not going to happen. After doing all this crap to my blog I feel as though I've done something, really I have not ....enjoy the update whores. Holy crap! I just realized that I over used the word "shit" in the worst way. Apologies.

      This particular post is going to be entirely devoted to gas, so if you're not the two people who I think are reading this, I apologize. 
    Sometimes I think it's funny to think about gas and the incredible power it has over everyone. Think about it, it's the one thing that controls every civilized person in one way or another. "What brings on this particular line of thought?" you ask. I have gas from the excessive drinking I did last night. Its one of those silent-but-deadly types of flatulence, but it has a short dispersal time.....its fast-acting. Its like, all of a sudden your nostrils are filled with this incredible stench, and you're consumed with disgust for yourself. Then its gone. Like a ghost, gone as if it never happened at all, but it was so horrible in that instant, that now you think you've imagined it. So you go on the hunt. Going on the hunt is when you're in your car or on the couch at home and you let one go that you think might be a record setter, so you contort your body so you can smell your own ass. I know what your thinking,"This guy couldn't have more class." You've done it yourself, so stop being so damn high and mighty.   Speaking of high and mighty, I'm going to make a bold statement,  everyone gets gas at some point or another, some people daily.  If this is true, can you imagine the ramifications of this statement. That means all kinds of powerful and important people are blowing wind out their ass. Even worse the pretty people, all the health foods they eat and all the protein, dear god the pretty people must have the worst gas. And am I alone in finding it easier to picture the president cutting the cheese than Angelina Jolie. I picture G.W. having the absolute worst beer farts in the oval office right before he has a meeting with some important head of state and then not saying a word about it....who's gonna call him on it? He's the leader of the free world. 
     In summation, everyone farts, so do you, but at least its not painful gas....right Mike?

      Why don't old people have normal conversations like the rest of us?  Why must they persist in talking about health problems?  Their health problems, the health problems of others...What the duece?  I was at my grandmother's 75th birthday today and I love my grandmother dearly, but god damn, I can not sit in on a conversation with her and her elderly friends.  All they do is talk about who's sick, who died, who stopped taking their medication.  And ultimately who the hell cares?!  We are all going to die, aren't there better things to do with your time than talk about how its going to happen?  some of us will die sooner than others (I'll be the last to go, so don't think you'll outlive me) you should make the most of your time here on earth.  Try new things, travel, spend some valuable time writing a blog few will see.  There's plenty of ways to live a full life.
  
Moving on.  I got a job working as a bartender recently.  I already new how to make drinks, but right now I'm "training".  Yeah, training consists of me doing all the work and getting no tips..pretty cool you say?  Not cool when you think about it some more...I get no money, I worked for the tips.  I remembered names, stories, drinks, I earned that shit, whats up with this damn rule?  You get the new guys tips and yours?  Bullshit!  Luckily I worked with this cool dude that gave me like $60 out of $180 in tips, I should be grateful but I'm still pissed off!  I wanted $90!  What a racket.
I was making the drinks faster than the dude thats been there for like 4 years, fuck this shit...I want my damn money!
  
To change the subject.  I have off this thursday and Mike and I are going to power plant to visit our friends, local celebrities Steve and Miles (I don't care if you've never heard of them, they're cool and we're cool by proxy...although I'd be cool no matter what.  Mike however, needs help).  That's all I've got bitches

      If only. If only this stupid computer hadn't went all wonky the other day you'd be reading a kick ass post right now, instead this is what you get.  urlLink Beggars  can't be choosers. I know, I know, you weren't begging. You should be though, if you really appreciated good stories. Is that boastful? Yes. Self promoting? Yes. Inaccurate..............probably. Anyway, there was some good shit in that lost post, you'll have to take my word for it though cause I'm not rewriting it. The shit was almost done and then..... nothing. Gone. Not a damn thing, it had a nice flow and if I tried to recreate it it would sound like something contrived. Like I was  trying  to recreate something. I won't insult your intelligence with that sort of crap. This is something entirely new.
  If only. If only I had a real bartending gig maybe I'd be making real bartending money. But instead that's a big negative to both. I went around  urlLink canton  to drop off a couple applications today. I figure all the college kids will be going out of state and back to their schools and positions will be opening up. I get the applications in a week or two before they leave and maybe I get priority on the call backs, who knows. Since I'll be going to Essex University. I mean Essex Community College. I mean grade 13, I'll be able to go to school and bartend. We'll see. If only these bars knew the level of alcoholics I could bring in on a slow night they'd hire me in an instant. If only they knew the repeat business they get when all the hot ass chicks in Canton see I'm working there. You know. On account of me being so awesome. I know..... too far. Seriously though, those chicks in Canton are super hot and if I do get a job down there...............ass soup. I may even go so far as to say, three ass soup, but that may be a little presumptuous at this point.
  If only. If only this job bartending at the  urlLink country club  continued to to be as profitable as it was when I started I wouldn't be so pressed to find a new venue for to showcase my bartending prowess. The jobs really not that great. The only benefit of working there is the hourly wage. I make $8/hr., if you ask another bartender what they make this is pretty decent. An average bartending job will pay you between $2 and like $4/hr. So it's kind of nice when the tips aren't coming as quickly as they should, and sometimes they don't, even for a guy with a smile like this. This theory don't hold no truck when you're not getting any shifts though. I can't deal with this bullshit of making no money for weeks at a time and being promised that the busy season is coming up. I understand that that's true no matter where you bartend, but I can't do nothing for so long. I at least want the opportunity to try and make some money.
  
If only. If only I could get these movies I downloaded to play that would at least bring a small ray of sunshine to this listless, painfully boring time in my existence. HaHa, happy days are here again.  urlLink Seven Samurai , directed by legendary director Akira Kurosawa is playing currently and I'll be enjoying it directly, as it is much more important than this post. And I'm out.........
