        Hmm, so i decided to start one of these things because i am really bored. I'm talking about so bored that cleaning my room sounds like an effing rave right now... however, my room is already clean, so this is my other choice.      anyways... today is like the epitomy of boring days. of course, i thought that was yesterday too, and maybe the day before that (and so on and so forth). Either way, everyday turns out to be the same: BORING. i can't wait till vacation in a few days.. matt is coming with me so that shouldn't be too boring. and i get to see my sister, yay! Laura is leaving tomorrow to go see her "friend" Ramzi in pennsylvania. I'm gonna miss her, and by the time that i get back we will only have like two more days until school starts. I HATE SCHOOL. especially since matt isn't going to go to the same school as me.. not like he was before we started going out, but yeah. this summer has actually been pretty good compared to other summers. lots of work, hangin out with laura and brittany and matthew, and well basically thats it. Soccer started again monday, and i am so damn out of shape. i haven't done anything physical since probably last season. so jason carnine is moving.... SCORE.. well actually you know i might miss him. i don't know... he's put me thru a lot of shit and treated me like i am nothing, but then again i have a lot of memories with him. Oh well, he is only moving like 30 mins away haha. this summer has been weird. I am dating a guy that didn't even know i existed in middle school, and i'm best friends with a girl that used to hate me (brittany) and a girl that is way too good for me (laura) lol. but i love them to death. i wonder if everything will stay the same when school starts. probably not. i just hope i stay with matt. and i better still be friends with laura, but i am not counting on brittany still hanging out with us.... she is in a completely different group than us. I miss eric... he is still in the hospital from his OD, and he is not out until friday which is when me and matt leave for vacation. i think matt should stay here to take care of eric, but he still wants to come on vacation. you would think that after all this happened with eric that everyone would kind of lay off the drugs... but they haven't. i feel bad because i've smoked twice since that happened... i mean i haven't done any pills or anything (not like i ever did) but still, i think its kind of disrespectful. then again its crazy what people do to have fun (and yes i know i am talking about myself too).      Laura's problem is getting better i think. Unless she is lying to me, but i don't think that she is. This is really good, and not to sound selfish, but I'm glad its gotten better because if she didn't get rid of her problem then i was going to start up my problem again. I'm glad i don't have to because i would have lost matt. I'm a damn hypocrite... at least i know it though, right? well i better get going and read my stupid book for English that I've put off all damn summer.      Til next time ;)      --sara--
