      i had a flying dream last night. first, i was made princess of a dying planet and was asked to save their people. so i took off flying, and had the same feeling i had in some dreams i had in the second hospital, that i can't quite describe. kind of like being in an elevator going down. anyway, i took off flying, looking for naomi. but i realized that i couldn't just yell "naomi," i had to yell her last name too. but i couldn't remember her last name. i found sarah k, from middle school, and i asked her if she had seen naomi anywhere. she said, "no, and you're never going to find her with  that  sweater." so i give her a yucky look and leave her. then i keep flying, and i get to earth, and i'm at camp. except it looks nothing like camp hi-rock. i think i'm still looking for naomi, but i'm not sure. i'm above a bunch of trees and i think it's a secret that i can fly. so i can't let anyone see me. then i lose the momentum and come back down to the ground. then i'm in a clearing and some flying monkeys are following me. the flying monkeys are dressed up like mojo jojo from the powerpuff girls. once i'm down on the ground, i have trouble getting back up. i have to run and try to lift myself up. i keep doing this, and keep failing. then, kari is with me. we are trying to escape from the monkeys, from one side of a lake-ish thing to the other. to help us fly, we are using two plasitc swords stuck through a huge dollar bill held out in front of us. since she does not have the ability to fly, she has to hold onto me, making it that much more difficult for me to fly. but we do get up and almost across the lake, but we fall down to the lake right before we reach the shore. we manage to get out with one of the swords and the dollar bill before the monkeys catch up with us. then we're running to a floating bridge-type thing, but all of the planks are just kind 0f floating by themselves. before the floating planks, there is an old man who shares with kari that he is the one who taught me how to fly. this disappoints kari because she thought i was amazing and taught myself. not that i'm not amazing otherwise. so we have to run across the floating planks to gain momentum to fly away from the monkeys, and we do it, but as soon as we're up we see a group of kids who aren't supposed to know i can fly, so we have to come down and turn around. then i woke up.

      i don't like the way i'm feeling and i guess i'm just an idiot. that's the main point. you know? as long as you think it doesn't matter, it's okay. o.k. right? it's not something you can do anything about. you know what i'm talking about.

      here are some dreams i had while i was in the hospital this year.  1 - there's a house kids go to where the residing family teaches the kids about sex. there's a lot of safe, experimental sex going on and it's well-known. then one day this kid goes there and sees the mother on the bathroom floor, and she is very sick. she licks the kid's ear and he leaves. then suddenly the mother becomes evil and removes her daughter's bones. then she disappears. then everything in the dream changes, and aliza is the daughter and bob balaban is the father. the evil mother is gone, and she's inside a wall in my mother's room. i hit the wall a few times, trying to get her out, but i'm not strong enough to break through the wall. then i get a hammer and bang it against the wall and it releases her. then we're all on coney island, at some kind of a gathering. then the released mother shows up there, and she's a doll. i run and give her to bob balaban so she can't do any more damage, and he and aliza turn her into a real person. and then aliza goes shopping with di from clueless and i listen to sublime.  2 -  i'm spinning around in the air above some kind of monkey bar thing with a chain, and i'm really high up and i'm pretending i'm ice skating. blair is there. then i'm in a department store that's also a gym, and i'm with my mother. she is trying to get me to go to the gym with her, but on my way to the changing room the ball from my lip ring comes off and it's made of clay. then i think the ring is gone, and i look all around the department store for it, but it turns out it was in my lip the whole time.  3 - lela (my cat) is dying. it's something about her stomach. the doctor operates on her and me and switches our stomachs and i try to take care of her, but she still dies. then i'm in a cafeteria-type place and lela hasn't died yet. my mother has forgotten all of her things on a table and i try to get them for her but i can't. then i'm in a hallway at east side middle school, and i see lewis. he says "you look great" and kisses me on the cheek. we leave, and then there's two lewises and i can't keep track of them and i get confused. then we're in laguardia. then we're in blades and we almost have sex in a phone booth that's in the store, but we don't because i woke up.

      she wakes up from a pointless nap. she is still tired. she is tired a lot these days, you know. she goes to the computer and looks to see if anyone has sent her a message since she's been away. nobody has. she looks at the clock, it is 7:04 pm. not to early, she thinks. the tv is on in the other room. she waits for the mother to leave. she thinks about what she has done today. and the day before. and what she will do tomorrow. her fingertips are numb, and she doesn't know why. she takes off her glasses and cleans them, taking longer than necessary. okay, here we go.  she can't feel her body. and neither can anyone else. because it's not there.

      make fun with a piggy on your back make fun with a piggy on your back cause it would be a shame to leave your child alone in the darkness and once my folder blew away in the wind so you should hold your folder very tight make fun with a piggy on your back make fun with a piggy on your back.  i made that up when i was six years old. i'm the same as i was when i was six years old and oh my god i feel so damn old. i don't really feel anything.
