      Sunday was Father's Day and we geared up for a fantabulous day outside.  It was perfect weather, 80 degrees, bright blue sky and we had a terrific day planned.  Just before we left I read my mother's Father's Day sermon which was eloquent and sweet and moved me to tears (check it out at:http://reverendpat.blogspot.com ).  She wrote of her Uncle Ernie and revealed more about him to her congregation than she's ever shared with me personally.  My mother's family all died before my brother and I ever came on the scene (except for Ernie who we only met once) and they all carry this mythical mystique.  I only know them in stories that are pieced together that don't form cohesive wholes.  And since I only know them through my mother's eyes I always wonder what I would have seen or which of their personalities I would have encountered.  For as with any mysterious character, they all have glamorous qualities, scary dark ones, and lots of shadows.  Uncle Ernie used to send us cards on our birthdays.  Cards with crisp new bills in them.  Usually a dollar but I remember getting $5.  He never wrote notes and there was never news.  Just the new money and "Love, Uncle Ernie".  It was like magic for me, getting those cards on my birthday.  Like getting a gift from the beyond almost.  He was such a ghost to me in many ways.  When I met him I was 13 and there's really no way for me to describe what it was like.  I suppose I had all these dreams and fantasies in my heart about what he meant to me and how much I thought he was this magical leprechaun kind of creature.  And since I was extremely shy and extraordinarily self-conscious at 13, I had no way to really express any of that to him.  So I mumbled and looked at my feet and ran off to play as soon as I could and felt entirely trapped by my age and awkwardness.  And it was strange to meet him face to face, like seeing a unicorn almost.  In a way, it wasn't supposed to happen.  I can only hope he enjoyed it.  I know I did but I'll always feel as though I wasn't quite good enough.  And that he would see I didn't deserve all those nice cards he sent.  My Mom's sermon is about Uncle Ernie being an extraordinarily kind man.  And let me share with you this quote:   "Spirituality is often about doing the tiny work of God, little acts, small responses to God's presence in our lives.  Spiritual people are about tiny things, which is the fruit of their spirituality.  The spiritual life is not a life of success; it is a life of faithfulness.  God does big things once in a while, but there is no question that the primary work of God in the world is tiny.  God knew we would naturally be dazzled by big.  That's why Jesus told the parables of the lost sheep, the lost coin, the lost son, the mustard seed.  The small, seemingly insignificant acts we do in the name of Jesus Christ don't seem very impressive to us, but they can make a big difference in people's lives.  Acts of habitual kindness can generate stability, unity and wholeness in a community."  And to my mother, Uncle Ernie, her father figure, embodied this spirituality.  This got me thinking of course.  And since I pride myself on being the kind of person who is kind to strangers I start to feel pretty darn good about myself and about how indeed I am a spiritual person living out my faith in small measure.  Yes sirree I'm just small enough to be relevant to God.  So Mikie has a soccer game on Father's Day and since he loves to play soccer Collin and I happily join him.  Luckily he was playing at a field that has a playground attached.  So Collin and I set up camp at the playground while Mikie plays soccer.  When I say we happily join him....let me clarify that this is a choice I make for Father's Day.  Honestly the idea of keeping Collin entertained at the park for 2 hours during his nap time is not that exciting of a prospect.  And had it been an ordinary Sunday I would have sent Mikie off to play while Collin napped at home.  But since it was Father's Day, and luckily a gorgeous day, we joined Mikie.  And quite frankly, in spite of it all, I'm glad we did and I would do it again.  But it's important to note that I am just a little frazzled and anxious at how it's all going to go.  So no sooner than we arrive and Collin heads up the stairs to the "Slide! Slide! Slide!" do we meet Roman.  Roman is 7, well, he'll be 7 in just 3 months.  3 months is his math, he'll actually be 7 in 2 months, August 31 to be precise.  Roman is a talker.  At first we merely exchange pleasantries, he actually says, "Good afternoon" which is charming.  We go over all our names.  He has me guess both his middle name and his last name.  He then wants to guess mine and Collin's names.  Then he wants me to guess his nickname, then he wants to guess our nicknames.  Then he just wants to chat.  Well, it's a nice day and he seems a little like a lost soul (they always know where to find me) so we strike up a chat.  Except also remember I have a responsibility to Collin who is busy on new playground equipment so I'm sort of torn between the two of them.  I'm getting a glimpse at what it's like to have two kids and it scares the hell out of me.   And then Roman just keeps talking.  And talking and talking and talking.  I'm wondering to myself where this kid's parents are and I start looking around.  He eventually tells me he's there with his grandma who is busily chatting away with one of her friends on a park bench.  And I am torn between the desire to be God's servant and the desire to tell this kid to shut up so I can enjoy my own child.  I take deep breaths, focus in on Collin and remember a challenge from my mother's sermon, "Listen to the neighbor kid's troubles instead of saying, 'Get lost.'...Usually giving our life to Christ isn't glorious. It's done in all those little acts of love, 25 cents at at time."  I resolve myself to be good and ask more probing questions.  I come to discover that Roman has 1 sister and 2 brothers, all of whom live in Ukraine.    "So who do you live with here?" I ask.   "THAT is not a good question..." he replies with all the 7 year old seriousness he can muster.  So I learn even more about Roman while Collin is looking around wondering where his mother is and why she's talking to this kid instead of sliding.  Roman's had it kind of rough.  He's "trying out" his third Dad.  The first one was greedy and the second one was mean and bad.  This one is OK but he's the laziest according to Roman.  There are stories of abuse and stories of neglect.  It's obvious the kid carries a painful load.  And to help him cope I guess he talks.  And talks and talks.  And I spend a good deal of time really investing in Roman, encouraging him, asking for details, telling him he's great and smart and a very mature kid.  He apologizes for having to say a bad word.  But he just has to use the word "stupid".  Again he apologizes after he says it.  But it  is  just stupid that the community center wants to charge $72 for only 15 basketball games when swimming is free.  I told him it was OK to use stupid in that context and that I agreed with him.  I also told him I appreciated that he's very careful about that bad word.  And then I had several ooey gooey moments where I looked lovingly out at the soccer field and at my sweet Collin and said Amens and Hallelujahs that my life is so much more simple than poor dear Roman's.  I started to feel as though Roman was there for me, as a little kick start of gratitude.  Stop your whining and anxiousness and give thanks that Collin only has one Dad who is neither greedy, mean, bad or lazy.  And if Collin wants to play basketball, stupid or not, we'd easily pay the money.  So I had nothing but misty eyes for Roman for a while.  And Collin was enjoying his company.  And really, it was so nice out.  It was turning out to be quite a good day.  And then Roman just kept talking and Collin was getting more demanding.  Collin needed to eat but he was all dirty so trying to clean him and offer him food that he would eat and all that jazz while Roman was busy chatting away was distracting and nerve producing.  It was hard to interrupt Roman and speak to Collin, I mean, I wanted to be present to this poor kid and make him feel special.  But at the expense of my own sanity and my own kid?  It started to get a little tricky.  Where was this grandmother anyway?  And there were plenty of other people at the park, couldn't someone else entertain Roman for a while?  Once Collin downed his sand covered banana and his energy was restored for more exploring, we headed back to the jungle gym and Roman began to recount to me all the details of the SERIES of books his teacher read to them this year.  And you know 7 year olds are not the best story tellers.    "So Annie, she's King Arthur's sister.  You know King Arthur?  Well, she's King Arthur's sister.  Well King Arthur's sister's sister.  And she, um, Annie, the sister, she has a friend Jack.  And Annie, her sister, King Arthur's sister's sister, she made this house.  This magic treehouse.  And when they want to come back they just get in and it spins and spins and then there they are.  And this one time, Annie, she went to the dinosaur times."  And on and on.  My head is now officially aching and I'm getting angry at this kid for wasting my time and distracting me with this  drivel !  Then I remembered something I read recently from Pamela Anderson in Jane magazine.  She talks about positive energy and surrounding yourself with positive energy.  And paying attention to the people you're with, do they give you positive energy or are they "energy vampires".  And it hits me like a ton of bricks that Roman is an energy vampire.  I'm giving all my energy away to this little blood sucker and I'm so stressed and frustrated about it that I'm cranky and miserable.  And totally unavailable for my child and husband.  I'm giving all of myself away to this stranger who is draining me so I'm now empty for Mike and Collin.  It seems like the only thing to do is to just distance from Roman, to start ignoring him and paying more attention to Collin.  So Collin and I go down the slide together which delights him so we do it "again" and "again" and "again".  Roman, sensing my separation, now asks for me to play tennis with him.  I explain that I need to keep a closer eye on Collin and he still persists, "we can play in the grass" he says pleadingly.  Those innocent eyes looking so hopeful.  I apologize and keep sliding with Collin.  The guilt is nagging at me.  I'm having internal wars about whose religion I'm going to follow my mother's or Pamela Anderson's!  The choice seems strangely ironic to me as they both seem utterly opposite and utterly attractive at the same time.    Where the hell is his grandmother?  Occasionally she comes over and speaks to him in  hushed, not so friendly Ukrainian.  But for the most part, she has left him to me.  I start to wonder if she always does this.  He did say he's at this park every day.  He explains to me that he forgot the popsicles and that he's really upset because they are going to be here all day and it's so hot out.  This is when I realize, Roman is not going anywhere soon.  I'm still dancing between ignoring him and playing with him when he starts to ask me to reach a tree branch for him so he can climb the tree.  I tell him I can't and suggest he ask his grandma, to do it.  He won't do that.  I realize of course he wants me to do something for him that he shouldn't do so I say I won't and sorry and all that jazz.  There is a tornado of guilt and obligation and woe and empathy and frustration and hatred inside me.  I keep trying to breathe deeply and "appreciate" the blue sky and the nice shade of the park but it's no use.  My anxious insides are wearing me out.  What would Uncle Ernie do I wonder?  I know the answer of course and I feel I've failed him once again.  The whistle finally blows to stop the game and I scoop Collin up, announce that we're leaving, say a quick and kind good bye to Roman and march off to the field for some relief in Mikie.  And wouldn't you know, as we're leaving the field heading for the car, who is heading home from the park?  Roman with Grandma in tow.  He wants to know which way we are walking, maybe we could join them.  "We're going in the car" I say, "we live far from here."  "Oh." he says with obvious disappointment.  And while I said pleasant good byes and was as nice as I was able, I can't help but feel I let him down.  People are always letting Roman down I guess.  In the end I didn't really choose either religion.  Just my often practiced and ever faithful tension and anxiety.  And the hope that I'll be out of this situation as soon as possible.

      We had the pleasure this week of experiencing our neighborhood pool.  We are fortunate enough to live in the Chicago area where people take summer seriously.  We've been indoors all winter and we get outdoors all summer.  The city is bursting with fun and exciting things to do.  Our "neighborhood pool" is basically a water park.  Water playground is its official name and man they ain't kidding.  This place is awesome!  They have a super huge pool with lots of shallow water, 2 HUGE inner tube water slides for the big kids, and a groovy little play area for the small ones.  We naturally were in the groovy little area for the small ones.  Imagine a huge climbing structure in the middle of a shallow pool with a zillion little fountains and things.  At the top are two different water slides which we can go on with Collin.  At the very top of the structure is one of those giant buckets that fills with water and periodically splashes down on the entire area with tremendous force.  OK, so that's what it is.  Now let me tell you that last night we went to the pool after Collin's nap, we arrived about 5:00pm.  Let me also tell you that it is mid June.  Being from Texas, mid June is HOT.  Chicago has slightly cooler weather and we were a little nervous to arrive at the pool and find it not quite warm out, but not quite cold either.  We try to divert Collin's attention with hanging out in the warmish shallow end of the giant beach like pool.  Neither of us was really into getting truly wet.  But he wanted to head for the slides so we followed him over there.  Let me tell you, that water is COLD.  Like teeth chattering cold. This did not deter our son however and he started for the slides right away.  In order to do that he of course had to climb up through all the cold spraying water.  And since he's 20 months old we decided parental supervision was in order.  OK, that's the setup, here's the pitch.  You know how when you're faced with something cold splashing on you, you brace yourself, duck for cover and do whatever you can to cover yourself from the water?  Well, my instincts were right on the money and I did just that.  Except, what I used to cover myself from all this splashing was Collin!  I didn't really realize it until we got to the top of the stairs and he is sputtering and shaking and trying to get the water off of his face.  It was one of those brilliant parenting moments let me tell you.  Fortunately, it didn't seem to bother him much and I made adjustments.  We went down the slide "again" and "again".  Poor Collin was shaking and his little teeth were chattering but his smile never faded.  And Mikie and I freezing and shivering ourselves had one of those united front parenting moments I just love.  I turned to him and said, "You know this is one of those times when you know just how much you love your kid."  His chipper response, "That's right, we can't ruin his fun."  And I just smiled at this amazing man, so appreciative of the tremendous effort he and I were happily making for our boy.

      So my husband is a bit of a Star Wars freak.  Not the dress up as a character and go to conventions kind (although he has been to a convention or two) but worse than that - he is the collecting kind.  Oh yes, you read that right.  He collects Star Wars stuff.  He has a room, a Star Wars room, of all things.  And it's filled with toys and books and comics and posters and various other Star Wars merchandise.  An entire wall filled with toys in pristine condition from all the new movies.  Oh sure he has stuff from the olden days, stuff his parents weren't smart enough to throw away (he would say they were smart enough NOT to throw it away), but mostly he has the new stuff.    I'm not quite sure where this collecting addiction stems from but he's got it bad.  And of course he's kind of a snob about it so you can't really get him anything.  He's got this bizarre and mysterious criteria for what's cool that only he knows.  He started collecting when the re-releases happened.  He was fresh out of college and flush with Wall Street cash and before you could say "May the Force be with you" his passion for the movies became a passion for collecting.    Now where do I fit in to all of this?  I began to see early on that this childish joy was so pure that I really didn't want to be the mean old witch getting in the way of things so I decided to accept it lovingly.  Wasn't that nice of me?  I assumed it wouldn't last forever.  Well, it's gone on way longer than expected and quite frankly he should be lucky the house is big enough and we don't need that room.  Of course I have days when I wonder, "Hey, what about my room?"  I suggested painting the the laundry room pink and making it all girly just for me but then that depressed me.  I'd really rather not hang out there thank you very much.    Anyway, my husband has this R2D2 robot that he got from his parents last Christmas.  (Yes, they still purchase toys for their son even though he's in his 30's.  Trust me, they too think it is weird but they are those wonderful super love kind of parents who would do nothing to stand in the way of their son's happiness.  That and really, what the hell else is there to get?)  And now he is using this Star Wars character robot with our son (20 month old Collin).  Well not surprisingly, Collin thinks it is really cool.  And I think they are adorable, the three of them playing together; Mikie giving commands, R2 making these weird electronic noises, and Collin doing his happy dance.    But when Mikie isn't at home Collin points at the thing and says, "R2! R2!" and looks at me expectantly wanting me to give it commands to make it dance and sing those mechanical "songs".  Well I don't know how the thing works and to be frank, I don't really want to know.  Knowing sends me much farther down the Star Wars path than I am willing to go.  And really now, don't you think I'm far enough already?  (Remember the room people.)    But when that sweet boy starts to get frustrated and throw a terrible two tantrum over it (yes, he is ahead of his age thank you for noticing) I wonder if it's worth it just to know a few things.  But then I remember "diversion" and Collin and I play with good old fashioned wooden puzzles instead.  And then we'll read some books or sing some songs.  I'll let Daddy be the one to teach him all about Star Wars.  I'll let it be their little bonding thing.  Just look for me in the rosy pink laundry room.

      We recently enjoyed a visit from the MIL and she requested we go to Ravinia one night.  Since Mikie and I both LOVE Ravinia we were happy to oblige.  Ravinia, for those of you who don't know, is one of Chicago's most impressive treasures.  Ravinia is a place, a state of mind, an event, a world all into itself.  Basically, from Memorial Day to Labor Day Ravinia, an outdoor music arena, hosts a variety of concerts from jazz to pop to classical.  As it is the summer home of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, classical is the predominant musical medium.  We decided to attend Saturday night's concert.  This season the symphony is featuring the works of Rachmaninoff and we were thrilled to learn that Saturday night, the symphony would play Rhapsody on a Theme by Paganini.  I'm no classical snob.  I basically like the stuff I've heard before.  I enjoy all types of classical, but the songs I love are the ones that are familiar tunes.  Usually made familiar by commercials and elevator music.    So I was thrilled when I learned that I would actually know some of the music.  Not only that, I do love that Rhapsody on a Theme.  You know the one.  It goes like this:  Da da da da dum Da da da Dum Da da da da dum La da da dum  And on and on.  Typically an evening at Ravinia is one of elegant sophistication and romance.  It's a giant picnic under the stars where people bring fancy little tables and place settings, everyone sets up candles, has wine and cheese and gourmet snacks.  Presentation matters.  The woman at the table next to us brought a hurricane lamp and surrounded it with fresh flowers.  This gives you an idea of the lengths people go to to make this a special occasion.  And it is special, magical even.  There's nothing quite like live classical music played by a world class symphony.  But instead of being crammed in an uncomfortable seat wearing shoes that are too tight, you are in your most comfortable (yet stylish) outfit, lying on your back looking at the stars.    OK, so imagine a 21 month old thrown into the mix whose bedtime is right around the start of the show.  Wondering how this is going to go?  So were we....  On the drive up we had lots of conversations about setting expectations.  I made it clear that we shouldn't force Collin to do anything.  That if we let him drive the bus in terms of walking, standing, sitting, strolling, whatever it would keep him quiet and happy and we would all enjoy the evening much better.  Quiet is important at Ravinia.  There's no talking during the performance.  They even have noise police in khaki pants and Ravinia golf shirts walking around with signs asking people to be quiet.  So we were a little on edge about keeping Collin quiet.  And of course we can feel the tension of the people around us wondering when this toddler was going to explode and ruin their Ravinia experience.  Well he did make a noise.  But he only endeared himself to his fellow music lovers when he did it.  You know how in a big symphonic piece there is a slight pause between movements?  A hush so you can linger in the last moment of the first section before they thrill you with the next?  Well it was during this hush that Collin broke into applause and shouted "Yay!"  We were the proud recipients of many warm giggles and stares after that.  For the most part, Collin decided that Ravinia is best enjoyed on foot.  He circled the entire complex several times and we spent countless minutes going over the same steps and ramps and trips to see the train and the potty.  As there were three adults there it was just perfect.  One adult was always up and completely focused on Collin, his ideal.  And then two were left to enjoy each other's company back at our base camp of our blanket, chairs, snacks, and bottles of wine.    I don't mind admitting that sometimes when I'm on Collin duty it feels much more like a chore than play.  Especially when it's the weekend and I feel stuck doing the job I do all week.  It's just like if you had to go into the office on a Saturday.  I can't explain why I have that feeling and I wish I didn't but I do.  But not at Ravinia.  I'm not sure if it was the music or the wine (probably a little of both) but we both had the most amazing time.  Collin was running around in his pajamas (we had brief delusions that he would go night night under the stars) looking like the happiest kid on the planet and he easily switched partners when one of us needed a break and never lost his happy grin.    I was off duty when the Rhapsody came on and I thought we made a mistake.  I didn't see how this song would eventually become the famous tune I was hoping to hear.  And then gradually I began to hear that it might and I was switching over to "Collin duty" when it started.  Well, I was in heaven!  Collin and I danced in circles to the music.  I couldn't contain myself.  It was the most exciting and glorious sound I had ever heard.  My feet HAD to dance.  And I was glad to have Collin in my arms both because I love him so much and because he gave me full permission to be as bold of a dancer as possible.  (Had I not been with Collin I might have danced anyway and that would be the thing that inspired Mr. D. to start his own blog....)  When certain music plays that leads me to dance, it's as though it is the natural extension of the swells in my heart.  Classical music always makes me yearn for the stage.  And Collin giggled and twirled right along with me.  Still too young to roll his eyes and be embarrassed by his mother.  Rather he was looking at me with pure adoration.  After our big number we headed over to the stairs where we played with Isaac.  He had one of those "be careful" Moms and I felt sorry for her.  Collin and I had a ball playing with her child and she was so anxious and self conscious that she couldn't really let go and have fun.  "He just gloms on to people" she said in an exasperated and apologetic tone.  "That's fine! How cute!" I yelled back as I chased both boys back up the ramp.  I could have played with them all night but she was getting uncomfortable (to her credit she was pregnant and I forgive a pregnant lady for anything) and Collin was ready to move to the next big thing.  The train!  Collin has a passion these days for trains.  And the Metra, Chicago's commuter railway has a stop right at the Ravinia gates.  So wouldn't you know it, just after we left Isaac and his Mom and we were near the front gate I saw that the Ravinia staff was preparing for the arrival of the train.  So Collin and I parked ourselves behind a fence and waited for the train to arrive.  "Here it comes, here it comes!" he kept saying.  "Oooohhhh, a train! A train!" he shouted over and over as it pulled into the station, looking at me as if he couldn't believe his luck.  "Bye bye train!  Bye bye train!" he said and waved as it left.  With a twinkle in his eye he shared with me a conspiratorial smile as if just the two of us had seen a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.  Next we were off to the potty, one of Collin's other new passions.  We're potty training in full force now.  But this trip Collin didn't want to go potty himself "No" he just hung around with me in the stall occupying himself with all the delights of the toilet paper and flushing and the little trash can.  I started our adventure in the stall by getting out a liner for the bowl.  Just as I was about to put it on the seat I thought better of it and decided to give that one to Collin to play with, undress a little bit, then put mine on the seat and pull-down-sit-down in one swift motion so he wouldn't steal my liner.  Well wouldn't you know he took the liner and placed it perfectly on the seat just like my own personal potty valet.  And then he quietly amused himself with toilet paper which he then handed me when I was ready.  I was beside myself with the bounty of my good fortune.  It's not that Collin isn't a good kid, he's actually a really good kid.  But keep in mind it is about 9:30pm and he is still in excellent spirits and blissfully happy and well behaved.    His Nannie, as he calls his grandmother, was on Collin duty when Mikie and I decided it was time to go.  We packed up our little site and looked out over the crowd searching for Collin and Nannie.  It was such a beautiful sight.  Silent reverence for the beautiful music, candle light, the twinkling of the stage lights in the distance, 16 stars in the darkening sky.  We didn't spot Collin but sure enough, when there was a pause from one movement to the next we heard his familiar "Yay!" and those little hands clapping and we knew just where to go.
