      We all knew it was coming... I just thought it would happen differently.  Last night I hardly slept a wink.  Some crazy, delerious dream about us having visitors all night and thoughts about the baby all night too.  Ethan's been pretty good at nights so far.  He's past the 24/7 drowsy stage and crys for sometimes extended periods of time before nodding off now.  It's frustrating to let him cry but sometimes it has to happen!  However, when he is asleep he's out to the world... not even the melodious sounds of Beck's voice can stir him.  Ahhhh.... he's his mothers son ;)  Life continues at the hectic pace it was before parenthood.  I'm back at Dale Christian School doing 4 half days and spending the rest of my time looking after my family and doing NewLife work.    Church has been awesome lately.  We're growing steadily (we're going to need a new building I know!), our people are becoming more committed to the church and each other, the worship has been awesome, God's been rocking the House weekly and there's just blessing flying all over the place.  WHAT A GREAT CHURCH!!!  Life is great... even though it's lived right now through sleep deprived eyes.  It's all good :)

      WOW.  What a week!  I find it amazing that so many great things can happen in the midst of so many horrible things.  We've been robbed, harassed, endured a 2 day labour (22hrs actual labour), had our firstborn in the intensive care unit for 4 days, our car alarm went off and someone let our dogs out.    In the midst of this however, we've been given more money than was stolen from our house, given grogeries, food, food and more food, someone mowed our front lawn, someone cleaned our house, we got back (thankyou Charlestown Police) almost all the stuff that was stolen and oodles of people have been praying for us endlessly.  AND on top of all that... today someone left a digital video camera on our front verandah for us to find!!!  PRAISE GOD!   Amidst trial and pain, His blessings shine through.  I told our church this morning that I feel so privileged to be a part of God's awesome church... especially our church.  What an amazing blessing it's been!  So life is really looking up.  Praise God... it's nothing that we've done... it's all been the Dude upstairs.  Praise God!

      Sounds a little cliche-ish but it seemed the only appropriate title for a momentus event such as this.     BECK AND ETHAN ARE HOME!   Yep, it's true.  Right now they're resting together... so nice... so cute.  I understand that 80% of you are vomiting right now but this truely is a wonderful thing.  The pregnancy is over, the labour is over, the hospital is over, the baby is here, he's healthy, happy and feeding well, my wife is home... she's actually home!  The crowd rejoices!!!  Well praise God is all I can say.  Now we move into the role of 'real' parents ('real' meaning home I guess) and start the road to seeing this young (1 week tonight!) boy grow up into the great man of God that he has been called to be.    Again, thanks for all the prayers and thoughts... you people are amazing!

      If any of you are movie buffs, you'll have recognised the quote above (Gremlins).  It's pretty appropriate at this time because Ethan's been under the Photo Therapy lights for the past day.  He has medium levels of jaundice so the light therapy (using ultra-violet lights) is supposed to help.  And it has... he's much less yellow than he was.  Beck didn't seem to like me calling him Bart either... lol.  For all you inquisitive minds, jaundice is something that 50% of all full term babies get and something that 80% of all pre-term babies get.  It's a red blood cell overcompensation which isn't being broken down properly by the baby's liver because it's not fully developed yet.   Part of the baby's natural method of losing these extra red blood cells is by pushing them to the surface, making it yellow.  Years ago, someone discovered that those babies that were put on the window sill in the sun (yes, I thought it was only pies as well) had milder cases or no case of jaundice.  Interesting yah!    Now my unscientific mind thinks that it should make the skin red... anyway... maybe some light research is in order.  Hope you are all well!

      Well an interesting 7 days to say the LEAST!  Last Tuesday at this time many of us were sitting around having great conversation and great food at Small Group unaware of just what would start in 3 1/2 hours time.  Becks waters broke at 11:55pm last Tuesday and we finally got the poor kid out at 10:05pm Thursday night.  Those 46hrs and 10 minutes were some of the longest in my life.  Then all the rigmarole of this break-in, going up to the cops, the forensic unit at our house today and  trying desperately to see my wife and son while still having enough time for a few minutes break has been quite exhausting.  Many people have been asking how I am doing through all of this.  I'd like to firstly say thanks.  It's nice that people care... I love that when I've spoken to any of you on the phone that each and every one of you has said "let me know if we can do anything for you ok?".  That's been awesome and I praise God for you people.  Such a support base can't be dreamed about.  You are certainly the support we need at this rather difficult and interesting time.  And to all you pray-ers.  I praise God for you.  Without you, who knows how this last 7 days would have ended up.  Thankyou thankyou thankyou!  Thanyou to all you people whom I am labelling (for this special blog), the Amazing Blessings.  God bless you all!

      I type this blog with surgical gloves by the keyboard.  Why you ask?  Because today our house was broken into, stuff stolen and the Police would like to check the house for fingerprints tomorrow morning.  Who said a pastor's life is boring??!!!  The house is a complete mess.  We still have yet to go through everything and sort it out... see if anything else was stolen.  It was very strange (but an act of God no doubt) because I got a call from the Police who had tons of my stuff including my laptop, PDA, watch, dvds etc.  Thank the good Lord that most of it has been returned... the things we're still wondering about is Beck's engagement ring and some other valuable items.  Will keep you posted on this very interesting week of ours.  Love you all.. Darren

      Feeling great tonight.  My boy is getting better, my wife is happier (feeding and sleeping much better thankyou pray-ers), and I just got my brothers adsl (super fast internet) connected for a couple of months until we get a wireless LAN setup between his house and mine.  Anyway.  Today was great.  Started off poorly with a frazzled wife, a baby that wouldn't feed and me being torn to go to NewLife or stay with Beck.  I opted to stay with Beck as I believe firmly that family comes before church.   Sure, God comes before family... but too many families have been torn apart because ministers have put the church before them... if the family fails.. the ministry fails.  God will never ask you to put the Church or work for the Kingdom before your family.   God is completely committed to the family unit.  If the family unit breaks down, society breaks down... that's the way it goes.  So I stayed with Beck (sorry... got a little off track there, lol) and we had some serious discussions with the nurses about poor communication between the NICU and the ward Beck's in.  Too much conflicting advise and different protocols for one baby and one mum to handle.  But after a couple of good feeds and a good nap, Beck was feeling great!  Thanks to those of you that visited today... it was great to see you all and (again) the presents were completely fantastic.  SPECIAL NOTE:  Thankyou to all NewLifeians who contributed to the 'secret' love offering today.  Beck and I have been totally blessed by it!  We praise God for you, your committment and your love.  We will continue to work together to achieve the kingdom goals that have been set for us.  God bless all of you!!!

      If you cruise over to  urlLink Planetnewlife  and go to the Leadership page, you can see some pretty cool pictures taken of our new son Ethan.  They were taken with my Sony Ericsson T610 so the quality is average but you get the idea :)  Enjoy!!!!

      Hi... It's late, so my blog tonight will be short... but good ;)  Beck continues to get better albeit slowly.  She is in high spirits and the recent changes to Ethan have only made us more happy.  Keep praying for rapid healing and a quick recovery for Beck.  She still needs our prayers.  Ethan has now been approved to leave the NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) and it staying with Beck tonight, praise God.  He is still classified as a NICU patient so they will come down and check on him periodically.  He has had a few great feeds today (YAY!) and seems to slowly be getting the hang of it.  Our preference is not to bottle feed because the best stuff comes from mum so this feeding aspect is a very important part of our lives right now!  Other than them, I'm holding up pretty well.  I was kindly taken out to lunch by my good friend Paul Solomon today in my short 1-3pm lunch break (lol).  It was awesome to catch up with Paul and Alice again.  We had a great amount of visitors today.  Not too many which was great.  Thanks to all who visited and for all the goodies...  they will be used (and eaten) well.  Blog again tomorrow night :)

      Some truly great things have happened today (PTL!). Beck was able to feed Ethan for the first time today and he fed really well.  His 8pm feed he was kinda sleepy for so they had to tube feed him but we're praying that he'll become a good feeder really quickly.  The ultrasound was done on his head as well.  The doctors are happy with the results and we are ecstatic.  Ethan's colour is normal now, his responses to everything is normal and his swollen head is subsiding.  The oxygen mask has been removed and the nurses are really happy with his progress. We are praising God for the great things He is doing in our little tiger.  I had my first hold of him tonight... it was amazing.  Holding your son for the first time is incredible.  Especially because he's looking healthier by the hour.  It was great to realise too that he's 1 day old now.  That's a pretty interesting thought... maybe only for his parents... but for us it was pretty interesting!!  Thank the good Lord I'm not preaching on Sunday...  All this time at the hospital with my gorgeous wife and new bub doesn't make for suitable sermon preparation.  Thanks David Jones for preaching this Sunday... can't wait to hear what God has placed on your heart.  Tis gonna be awesome.  Well, more on the newborn and the new mum tomorrow folks. If any of you are thinking of visiting please sms me or call first.  We're going to have to regulate the visitors for the next couple of days.   It's in the best interests of Beck and therefore myself.  Blog tomorrow :)

      I've been this morning to see my beautiful wife and the little tacker.    Beck is going ok but she can't have any visitors until tomorrow.  Please contact me first if you'd like to visit her as she needs a great deal of rest for her to heal quickly.  Please also pray for Beck that she would recover quickly, sleep soundly and become mobile as soon as possible.  She's finding it difficult because Ethan is still in Neonatal intensive care and it's hard for her even to see him.  Be great if you could keep her in your prayers.  Ethan is going ok.  He has some fairly serious internal head bleeding which he's being monitored for.  He will have a head ultrasound today and constant blood tests to monitor this injury until it's fully healed.  Please pray with us for little Ethan, for complete healing, for the swelling to go down, the bleeding to heal and for no permanent damage to him.  The long, traumatic birth put him into shock, but the oxygen mask is now off and he's breathing fine by himself.  Praise God!  More updates as we hear of them.  Thankyou so much for the prayers and support we have received already... we are completely blessed to have so many loving friends and family that are standing by us right now.  God bless every single one of you.

      Here's a SHORT blog to mention the fantastic arrival of our new son :).   WOOHOO!!!    Ethan James Chapman was finally born (after a 24+ hour labour) at 10:05 last night (October 16th). He was 7lb 15oz and we're still waiting to hear on the height.  Beck is coping ok... it was a very difficult and long labour and we really praise God that it's over!  Ethan was having some breathing problems after the birth so we really didn't get to see him that much last night.  He was taken to the nursery and put on oxygen and an IV.  Your prayers would be greatly appreciated for him and for Beck as she heals after this difficult labour.  God is good!  And now I'm going up to the hospital... enough time on the net!  Blog tonight some time with more info for you on the little guy :)  Praise God!!!!!

      Well... there's movement at the station to say the least... just how long it will take is completely unknown.  But we praise God that at least SOMETHING is happening. IMO (in my opinion) the baby should be born by the end of the day... but hey, what do I know.  I thought it was going to come 2 weeks early!  More as it happens folks... Will keep you updated when more comes to hand ;)  Oh, and while you're there, if you could put up a few prayers for Beck and the baby, that'd be greatly appreciated.  BLOG SOON!

      Believe it or not, the inevitable has not yet happened.  Yet another blog is flavoured with baby talk... but what else could I discuss?!  Is this not the most important thing happening in my life right now?!  Of course it is!  Enough with the apologies.  Despite the due date being October 11th, the baby saga continues (Years from now my child will be going through my blog archives and will read all this).  Are there any signs?  No.  Does the baby  want  to come out?  It would seem not!    However, on the flip side of the coin, it would also seem that the past 2 weeks of holidays was a gift from God to Beck and I.  With Beck having stopped work, it's given us much more time to spend with each other.   This has been a real blessing and I thank God for it.  Heck... we're going to have the kid for many years to come... we might as well savour the last remaining 'couple' moments we have left!    Service this morning really cranked.  God rocked the House again and we met 7 new people including a couple more from Harvest.  Church life is awesome and we bless God for every minute.  Well, I'm off...  The Family Man  on Prime is beckoning... fancy that... a movie I haven't seen yet! :)

      Every blog it's the same drama... title first... or blog first, title last.  Normally I opt for title last when I get into some good blogging action LOL.  This crazy world of ours forever plummets into further and further despair and helplessness.  Today, I discovered that Coles has now stopped selling Raspberry Leaf Tea.  I mean, C'MON!  What is going on here??!!  I make a special trip to get the necessities (chocolate and RL tea) and leave with just chocolate and a Coke!  Extended search showed up nothing... even the Coles dude couldn't find it.  So I did the dirty on them... I checked out Woolies... but to no avail.    (Beck wakes up and enlightens Darren)  It would seem that even pastors can be wrong (lol).  Coles, as I am advised by my gorgeous  40  week pregnant wife, actually sells the Raspberry Leaf tea in the Health food section... ARGH!  Back to Coles I go.  Been preparing for a great service tomorrow.  Sermon notes should be online from Sunday afternoon to Monday afternoon... will let you know when they're up.  Well, I'm off to check out the wonderful land of health food at Coles.  Please let them have some...  Oh and FYI, Raspberry Leaf tea aids women in bringing on the birth naturally, it tones the uterus and is supposed to make the contractions much more efficient.... HENCE THE IMPORTANCE!  Blog soon...

      It's late, I'm tired but somehow I manage to push through and blog anyway.  The pace of life will very soon quicken.  A particular school of thought thinks the baby will come tomorrow.  One can only hope!  We will see if the prophecy comes true.  In just 2 days my gorgeous wife will be a full 40 weeks pregnant with our first.  The masses of prayer, the barrage of mental change and anticipation hope desperately that tomorrow will see the birth day of our first child.    What a concept, what a bizarre notion it is to think that Darren and Beck will soon be parents.  Parents to an eternal being, a life that will make good and bad choices, a person, a life, a being, a human with a will, emotions and definately a sense of humour.   Such a cool and mind shaking concept that will most probably keep me up into the night the day it arrives in the open air.  Today I worked on my message for Sunday... I was sure that scheduling today as my 'message prep' day would bring the birth on, if only due to Murphy's law!  But nope... not this time.  We have scheduled another doc's appointment next week, in the hope that we'll have to cancel it.  Mind you... the receptionist didn't like me mentioning that I hope we have to cancel it! LOL  We will see... Nothing planned for tomorrow except a visit to the office... and the BIRTH OF MY BABY!!!  Bring it on... We've had almost 40 weeks to prepare for parenthood... surely we're ready!  And surely not!  What can prepare one for parenthood except parenthood!  There's a Paul Reiser book and a Steve Martin video around here somewhere about that... They'll know!  Yeah right.  I'll stick with prayer and the Bible thankyou very much ;)

      Of course it had to be another BABY post!  Yet another day has passed in our month of anticipation and not a stirring in sight!  The baby has been quite active, but for the time being, it's happy to sit in the warmth and listen to the melodious sounds of Beck's voice.  Today has been about learning.  I've read 7 chapters in the past 2 days of the million sale baby book  Baby Wise .  It's very good.  It's insightful, logical and provides a great deal of useful and relevant information and experience to us... unexperienced ones.  The other book taking our fancy at the moment is  Baby Love .  I'm sure that with all this baby knowledge floating around (parents, sister and bro in law, books, GOD!) that all this parenting stuff should be pretty ok.  It's such a wacky thought that someday... SOON... I'm going to be a dad... a REAL DAD!  Not a fake-I-bought-a-cool-dog dad... but a real one!  The thought of holding my own child in a time that is totally unknown to every person on earth except God is a mind blowing concept that stirs me to prayer.   "CAN I HAVE MY BABY NOW PLEASE!??!!?!"   Any time now Lord :)  Darren

      I'm currently browsing  urlLink Australian Weblogs  which is REALLY COOL!  It's a weblog tracker which tracks updates of tons of Aussie blogs.  Very cool... so I inserted my little blog name and web address for extra exposure.  It would seem as though thousands of blogs worldwide have something to say... something that's much more than simple chit chat.    If this is your first visit to my blog, this is what you'll find here - what's going on in my head at the time, thoughts on random world and Australian issues, thoughts on the state of the church (I'm a pastor ok?  What did you expect? :P) and other random things to do with life, the life of my family and local church.  Hope you're having an awesome Monday.  Darren

      So both of us are thinking, "Is this baby EVER going to come out??!"  We hope so... technically we have another 5 days to wait until the 'official' due date but I'm not sure any of us can wait that long.  Beck's Itchy-Annoying-Rash-Thing kept her up from 3am last night and she's clearly had enough of it!    Our NewLife service was great last night.  Superlow on numbers but God showed up and rocked the House and it was awesome.   You can download the message  urlLink here  if you missed it.  Hopefully soon we'll have audio files to download as well.  That would really be cool.  I'd love a site like www.harvest.org someday... man that would be great!  Quality website that looks awesome, great flash animation, huge list of cool downloads... someday Planetnewlife will be like that too.  Only a matter of time...  Life is generally cool at the moment.  Have today off, like the rest of NSW, Australia and hopefully I'll be able to take the next couple off as well.  Schools out for another week so my Youth Worker position at DALE is off as well... which is good... because I was kinda needing a break.  The kids are good... but they are a handful no doubt.... but we love them and will surely persist until they're ready for mainstream schooling again.  Well, that's about it for this cloudy, easy public holiday.  Hope to do nothing much at all today.  That should be easy!!!  Darren :)

      This should be fun... my first blog begins with some thoughts on our new up-and-coming baby.  Beck is 39 weeks pregnant and has truly HAD ENOUGH!  I'm praying that it comes early... and why shouldn't it!?  I was 3 weeks early, BECK was 3 weeks early... so as far as I can tell, this baby is already 2 weeks overdue!  Don't they induce babies when they're more than 10 days over?  I thought so too!  Anyway, Beck's lying on the lounge, recovering from her day shopping with her mum.  I've just come back from 3 hours spruiking at Whitakers Jewellers at Kotara and I thought that setting up a weblog would be a cool thing to do.  SO HERE I AM!  Life is cool at the moment.  Actually it's awesome.  Baby on the way, growing church seeing fruit, great wife, new kitchen on the way... could life be any better?  Well... yes... it could... a baby NOW would be great thanks.  So that's it... thanks for tuning in to Pastor Darren's first blog.  Stay tuned for the first Pastor Darren-as-a-father blog!!!  Darren

      Another day, another kitchen problem.  It's been more than a week now since they started installing our kitchen.  What a joke!  Won't be recommending them to anyone.  2 days they said... more like 10!!!  The handles have yet to be fitted, the plasterer hasn't shown yet, the electrician forgot about the powerpoint for the mircrowave and the endless series continues.  Oh, to sleep in my own bed!  We're still living at Beck's parents house which isn't bad at all... it's just the inconvenience of it all that frustrates me!  Getting your kitchen done?  Come and talk to me first.  Thumbs down to this mob...  it's a pathetic situation that we can't do anything about.  Onto more life giving and important matters, Stu Brown is getting baptised this Sunday after our service at NewLife.  We're going down the bogey hole to baptise him so feel free to join us there at about 1:30pm.   It's going to be great, we can't wait.   It's about time Stuey!!!! :P

      So this morning, Chris (my work client/kid) and I are sitting at a picnic table at Raymond Terrace in a park and this huge bus pulls up with hundreds of elderly people in it... ok... there might have been 50.  Within seconds we're surrounded by them as they eat slice and drink coffee and I'm suddenly struck with the thought that there is a total wealth of great knowledge and wisdom from these people.  I said to Chris, "Man... do you have any idea how much these old people know?!" and so he starts sprouting off random questions from his school work in the hope of catching them out.   "What disaster happened in 1883?  What about 1338?  What disaster happened in the 1600s?... " and on it went.  We were surprised with the amount of correct answers.  So there you have it folks.  Never look down on an old person... because chances are, they know a whole lot more than us and we can really learn a lot from them.

      Ever felt guilty walking your dog?  Normally I feel pretty guilty for NOT walking our dogs... but today, during our super-irregular walk I felt guilty.  We have a lot of dogs in our neighbourhood and most of them can see the street and dogs being walked by their owners.  This (for some unknown reason) annoys the little brains out of these dogs and I can't help but think that the owners are a little annoyed at the 'reminder' that their dog needs a walk.  If you don't already know, we have 2 dogs.  Stella, a Boxer cross Ridgeback is a playful, yet time consuming 2 year old pup.  Stella's digging out fascination continually prompts her owners to chock up the fence line with all sorts of hard and heavy objects :)  Zeus, an ugly yet surprisingly cute monster of a Mastiff cross Ridgeback is suprisingly well trained!  He, unlike his female friend, can do all sorts of tricks that we like to impress guests with.  However, most of our guests never see our Backyard-Blitz-prepared backyard which our 2 playful dogs have carefully destroyed.   In another couple of years, we might think about some plants again lol.  Life continues at blistering pace so I've been forced to take a few afternoons off this week.  Perfect timing too because Janet Sykes from Victory ( urlLink www.victory.org.au ) is preaching this week on Extra Mile Relationships.  Can't wait.   Our new kitchen is also 1/2 installed so we're kind of living at Beck's parents house until it's finished.  Been waiting 9 months+ for this... few extra days can't hurt!!!  ARGH!!!!  Love you all.

      After such a full week we have gone on to endure a huge weekend as well.  Saturday was spent with the Victory Network pastors at a Vision Planning day which was very productive and inspiring as well.  Saturday night was family and sermon stuff which was all great but still tiring and hardly restful!    Then today we started the day with another huge NewLife service (if you weren't there you missed out BIG TIME)!  The worship really cranked, God again filled the House and touched many people's lives and for some strange reason the song I wrote, He is Stong went down really well again!  It is so weird hearing your first song sung by your congregation!  And what's weirder (if that's a word) is knowing that people are worshipping using the words you strung together!  They're bringing glory to God through it... I mean... how amazing....what a cool concept.  So many songs are written these days, many of them pointless, many quite poignant... but how many song writers draw people closer to God with their songs?  Answer me that!? :)  On the Beck and Ethan update, both are doing really well.  Ethan has found the huge weekend to be a little upsetting but he's gone to sleep ok tonight finally.  Beck is completely exhausted at the moment, you're prayers would be great.  She's gone to bed already because of a headache.  I'm doing pretty well... I'm completely trashed because life hasn't let up this week and we've been out every night since last Monday (aka Alias night ;) ) so I'm totally trashed but I'll keep standing on the rock of my Lord because He is strong!!!  Need to move in a supernatural energy this week... I'm thinking it's going to be the only way I'll make it sane!  Rock on people, love you all.

      Oh my goodness.  Well so much for the great intention of blogging more frequently.  This one has to be quick because I'm SOOOO tired!    This week was super busy.  I worked long hours because we were short staffed at DALE this week, then the kid I look after assaulted one of our youth workers on Thursday so I was at school until late (3:30 :P) doing paperwork and stuff.  Then Friday was a blur (thanks Craig for the game) and today was spent in a great meeting working on the vision for the Victory Network.    Check  urlLink Planetnewlife  for the latest squash scores ;)  GTG legends... blog soon... well more soon than last time ok!?

      Well it's been almost a week since my last blog!  Sincerest apologies to my regular visitors... this is supposed to be a 'regular' thing!  I could use the lack of time complaint but as I'm told "everyone has 24 hours in a day!".    Anywho, life is moving along pretty well.  Ethan is only waking up for feeds during the night (and normally only 1-3 depending on when he is put to bed) so I'm sleeping normally pretty well.  My sleep is much lighter though I think... might be the fact that there's another person in the house and we're kinda responsible for him!  Beck is doing really well.  She is now starting to see herself as human instead of a walking feeding machine so that's good.   Beck's mum has been an incredible help in keeping a stable, tidy, functional and clean house too... so if you're reading this Marg, THANKS HEAPS!!!  Blogging, I've decided is a really weird thing.  You have (or don't have) all these readers... you're not sure who they are (apart from those that tell you, "Gee, you haven't updated your blog in a while"), you don't know who doesn't know you but is reading your blog... and you don't know what they want to hear either.    I, for one, have no idea just exactly who my blog is aimed at... do I dazzle people with my mediocre computer knowledge, surprise them with my average church history, growth methods and church life stories, entertain them with my personal life stories, talk about gaming, the internet, parenthood, family life, ministry, spiritual life or just plain ol' me?  WHO KNOWS!  If you're here to learn, read or be entertained on any of the aforementioned topics, please send me an email to darren@planetnewlife.org and I'll try to include a little more of you're particular preference of topic in my blogs :)  Signing off for now (not a week this time!).

      As I blog this, my son is sitting by me in his trusty rocker, rocking away... and laughing at me.  His goos and gaas continue to melt my heart every time and his smiles and laughs combined continue to enhance the baby experience like never before.  It's great that he's responding now... it's just so awesome.  I've been thinking... (alarm bells go off in your head)... everyone should have a blog.  These days with so many people losing touch with one another, and bulk emails becoming so tedious and 'impersonal', why doesn't everyone just start up a blog... then we could keep in touch on an impersonal level and email when we want to be personal!!!  That's my opinion anyway :)  To get a free blog go to  urlLink Blogger  and create one.... it's SO easy... and super fun, and we can see what's happening in your world a little bit more often.  Great to stay in touch and hear whats going on behind the scenes.

      Wow... what a day.  I ate so much I think I'm going to need some new belts lol.  For some strange, unknown reason I just had to blog... even at this ridiculous hour, my blogging bug still bites.  And who reads it?  Craig, Tim and some bored guy from upstate New Jersey called Petro.    Well... we scored... again.  We live in such a great country and are completely blessed by great family and awesome friends... what a blessed life we live, truly!  My magnetic dartboard has already had it's money's worth I think, my squash clothes will get a workout as soon as the Viking Centre opens again, I've already half read Scott Cam's book on Home Maintenance for Knuckleheads (and discovered that I truly am a knucklehead) and my DVD collection got another small influx.    Thanks Lord for an awesome day, a great service yesterday, family that are life-giving and for the blessed life that I have.  You Rock!  Oh... and Beck's brother Brad and his girlfriend of 8 years Nat got engaged tonight.  Somehow there was this cool velvet bag in her bon-bon which had a nice shiny ring in it!  It was a massive surprise to say the least... I thought he was totally joking... although I did feel pretty ripped off for a second because I only got some daggy jokes, a paper hat and a pathetic little green alien creature in mine!  It was a great evening, especially with extra to celebrate.  Nite all... I'm trashed :)

      Well it's Christmas Eve already.  I only started getting in the Christmas spirit about 3 days ago so it can't be Christmas yet!  Today's Christmas Eve service at church went really well.  Was good to see some family, some frienda and some failthfuls :).  Played some hard core squash with my bro and Ben (Denjin) this morning which was good.  Got myself a flogging however... but it was really fun and I needed it!  My new and awesome racquet (thanks Craig for the surprise!) is kicking along nicely.  Pity I couldn't even beat Glenn today LOL!  Ahh... the brotherly competitive spirit returns for a rematch.  So Christmas is tomorrow eh?  Actually, it's in 50 minutes according to my Windows time.  I gotta admit... I really enjoy Christmas.  This year has been good for me spiritually because it's been the first year in ages where I've been able to dodge the materialistic crap, the shopping craziness and the many distractions and actually appreciate the birth of my Saviour.  Whether you believe it or not... Jesus completely rocks... and he's the REAL, ACTUAL reason we have Christmas.... not fat men dressed in red suits, not even to give or receive presents (although that IS pretty great)... it's to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ.  Planetnewlife is down again... aahhh another thorn in my side.  Oh to have free, 0.1% downtime hosting ;)  Thanks Fred for all you've done for us... now get that server back into shape lol.  Anyways, hope you all have an awesome Christmas and no doubt I'll see most of you in the New Year!  God bless and drive safe.  Darren

      It would seem that I'm not as committed to blogging as some other blog-freaks out there but never you mind.  I'm a busy man, what with a church, a 9 week old baby, Christmas nearly here and my spruiking work getting all fumbled up, I'm starting to think I need a personal assistant :).  Had a few much needed shifts cancelled this week but I'm not going to lose it.  God knows what He's doing here!  It wasn't a surprise to Him that my shifts got canned... besides, I had a backup coming for yesterday anyway.   Thanks Angus and Robertson Bookworld in Hunter Street Mall for coming through for me!  3 and a half hours of listening to my own voice... ahhh... it was heaven.  So I'm in the middle of my message today and I remembered this wacky quote from Black Adder... I was talking about Paul being in a sticky sitation in Acts 21 (I'm starting to giggle even now hahahahah) and I just blurted out, "It was the stickiest situation since sticky the stick insect got stuck on a sticky bun"  - ROFL (Rollin on the floor laughing for the non-geeks out there)!!!   Then Alison was so polite to point out that I do enjoy my own jokes tonight!  HAHAH... it's true... if a man can't laugh at and with himself, what can he do?  Woke up this morning at 5:16am (my alarm clock is 7 minutes fast btw) and I'm a little bit cold so I pull up the doona over me and get that great, satisfying feeling of being just the right temperature again... Ahhhh... perfect sleep is coming.  Then 2 seconds later my alarm on my phone goes off because it's actually 5:10am!!  ARGH!   So I hit snooze a couple of times and enjoyed the perfect warmth for 20 minutes.  Does anyone else do that?  Ever set your alarm 20 minutes early so you can hit snooze twice times before getting up?    Anyway, going to work on some stuff for Planetnewlife for a while before hitting the sack.  G'nite all :)

      So I'm driving back from Raymond Terrace today (last day with Chris my work client (I'm a youth worker btw) so WOOHOO!) and I'm driving carefully, as is my conviction, AND to the speed limit and this  MASSIVE  truck comes looming up behind me and sticks on my tail for several hundred metres before he had to turn off.  I was || close to doing something outrageous... like speeding... or putting the brakes on lightly just so the light comes up... or just completely freaking out... but I didn't.  Why do hoon truck drivers think they own the road?  Do they think we're likely to just pull over when they come up behind us because they're so huge and scary?  Not likely!  By the way (btw) what is ~?  It's called a tilda but I've never seen it used in proper English context before.  If someone knows can you email me on darren@planetnewlife.org??  That would be great :)  The kitchen saga is finally over.  The plasterer finally came and did what he was supposed to, someone came and fixed the leaky sink and the bin and it's all done!  YAY and Hurrah!  Oh, massacred Glenn in squash today (actually it was pretty close... pretty sad seeing as he hasn't played in MONTHS!) which was good.  Good to get an extra game in per week... might just lose those extra Christmas kilos before they arrive :).  The Viking Centre has a $30 deal for 30 days so we'll be making the most of that one over the next 30 days!!!  Thanks God! :)  Well, some weird visitors are coming over soon (my bro and his wife lol) so I'll sign off... about ...... now

      Personally I think the world has gone hold-line crazy.  As I blog this, I'm on hold with the Commonwealth Bank where the lovely lady continually appreciates my patience and assures me that my call is important to them.   I really love it that sometimes you hear your call 'going through' to the next level of computer annoyance.  And it would seem that big business is only going more and more computer and hold-line driven with more and more options to frustrate more and more people.  This is why the internet is so great.  Because if everything could be done, chatted, filled out, sent and applied for online, I'm sure life would be much easier.  Of course this would mean little to no human contact, nor would people have to leave their houses... but for some it's a nice thought!!!  Anyway, I think I'm blogging for the sake of blogging!  Just wanted to catch up :)  Email me on darren@planetnewlife.org to 'really' catch up.

      Well it would appear that my blog has influenced others to start their own!  Check out thehaddens.blogspot.com for Steve and Erin Hadden (from NewLife)'s blog.  Blogspot is the bomb and I completely endorse it.  Today I managed to whip Craig Sparrow's backside in squash yet again (LOL).  Actually, he beat me in 5 games but somehow the final 2 games I won 11-1 and 11-9 so I beat him in 7! Pretty happy with that!  Sorry to rub it in Craig but the peoples want to hear what's happening in my life and beating you takes the cake! :)  Almost finished my sermon for Sunday morning.  Really looking forward to it!  Don't miss out on the keys to becoming a 2nd Level Giver!!!  Beck is going great guns as is Ethan James.  It was very interesting to realise (much to our shock-horror) that all three of us have middle names starting with J!  We didn't even think about it until the Medicare cards came in and then it was blaringly obvious!  Oh, little bit of random Simpsons trivia for you.  What is Homer J. Simpson's middle name?...  Give up?.....  It's Jay.  Apparently all the Simpsons have middle names starting with J.  Don't expect me to remember all of them, this random thought just came to mind right now!  Going to see the movie S.W.A.T. tonight.  Can't wait.  Been looking forward to this ever since they released the first trailer on Apple.com.  Looks very interesting, action-y and like it even has a plot!  Master and Commmander was awesome too.  Russell Crowe did brilliantly as did the rest of the cast.  Pity Russell gets seasick all the time and had to live on sea-sickness tablets!  lol  Blog more soon... See y'all

      Just got back from walking my largely neglected dogs with my bro, Glenn.  My second game of squash for the week had to be replaced due to needy dogs.  Still, got us out of the house and a whole lot of exercise.  My waistline still isn't impressed with my current food consumption record but I'll be working on that for the rest of the week!  That's what I get for going to the Silver Dolphin twice in a week.  Argh!  Mind you, seeing Chris eat 8 plates of food was certainly an achievement.  I didn't realise 13 year olds could eat that much.  In fact... I'm not sure they're supposed to!  Tonight is a lazy night... most probably spent in front of some CRT (Cathode Ray Tube for all you non-90's-computer-geeks).  I wonder if they still teach what a CRT is in school these days.  Heck, they're proably only teaching them stuff about LCD screens and plasma.... Poor standard monitors... they've been so faithful... and yet are so heavy.  My 19" that I'm typing on at the moment weighs about 30Kg I'm sure (thanks TeX :) ).  Well I'm sure that if I don't watch it, that I'm going to go overboard in the blog territory.  2 decent paragraphs and a closing line is all I'm allowed isn't it?  Man this is scary... :P  Beck and Ethan are both doing really well.  After some slightly traumatic days and nights last week, it would seem as though Ethan's (and therefore Beck's) routines are back in some sort of regular pattern which is great.  Ethan's only woken up once to feed in the past 2 nights so that's been awesome praise God!  Planetnewlife is down at the moment.  Fred's server to server configuration had a coronary a few days ago and they're still working on the problems.   Terribly sorry to all of our NewLife team who have all their emails going through it.  It should be fixed REALLY soon we hope.  But thanks God for free hosting and free email anyway!!!  It's still a blessing :)

      The weeks continue to fly by and this one has been no exception... except it's been more fun :)  This week has been the last week of school for the kids at DALE.  It's been great doing some really fun stuff with them (pool, surfing, snorkeling, dvds, bbq, hanging out and the presentation night last night).  You could say that my work life has been a bit breezy this week (ask Kristy, she'll tell you!) but it's still been trying with the ADHD lot of them.  Ahhh... but we love them so much!  Spiritually, things are great.  Been changing my devotional structure around a little (scary stuff) but it's proved to be a great method and I hope to continue using it for revelation and sermon prep.    This Sunday night's service should be great!  Don't miss out on it.  We've got Kristy back on keys, Zac is going to bass bless us and I'm preaching on being firmly planted in the House of God.  I can't wait!  Oh, email to planetnewlife is down until tomorrow afternoon too.  We've got our top men working around the clock and this time it's not a lemon, swiss cake roll!  Love you all.

      Well, I have to say that the frequency of my blogging is exactly proportional to the busyness of my life.  I mean... 10 days since my last blog?!  So sorry to my regular fans ;)  Here's what life has cooked up in the past week.  Sundays service was great.  We clocked 35 people, had a great time of worship and people responded well to the message I gave on Philippians 4.  Man, there's so much in that chapter it was very hard to cover in 1 sermon.  Monday was a lazy day inside watching the Australian Open and sobbing after Phillopousis and Hewitt lost miserably.  That was this week so far.   Last week was hectic as.  (Don't you just hate it when someone puts 'as' on the end.... we had a business behind the mobile phone shop I used to work for called 'Salads As Fresh As'... no wonder they went out of business lol)  I got a call from Kevin from DALE to come into work on Tuesday which really thwarted my well thought out plans to Backyard Blitz the backyard.  However, we need the money so I went in on Tuesday for some wonderful moving around of heavy things for a few hours.  Wednesday was the St Philips Big Day Out which was great and on Thursday I did some OH&S with DALE and then joined the wonderful St Philips IT team for an afternoon of moving computers.  It really was a fun day... no really!!!!  So this afternoon I've been hard at work on NewLife's revised vision.  It's going to be much simpler and easier to remember and run with this time.  I've decided that for people to take a hold of a vision and remember it... it needs to be easy to remember!!!   Esp since I even have trouble remembering our vision statement!  Been working on the next calendar for NewLife too.. should be available this Sunday from your local NewLife church... ours! ;)  Oh and  urlLink Planetnewlife  is up too so check it out... it's been fully updated for your convenience :)

      I have to say that spider webs and things touching you that you weren't expecting would have to be one of the scariest things ever.... apart from that MASSIVE spider in Lord of the Rings 3.... man that was big.   I finished 'offloading' about 5 bags of rubbish and stuff last night into other people's unsuspecting wheely bins (those silly things never expect anything!) and on my way back up the street to my house proceeded to step through a spiders web.  Seriously scary stuff... I get in the house and I'm pulling imaginary things off me and asking Beck if she can see any spiders about to bite me... it was a really traumatising time!  While I'm on the topic of spiders, I think that everyone has at least 1 good spider story.  I've got one... and it sure scared the living daylights out of me when it happened!  I was in Canungra just south of the Queensland border during my stint in the Army in 95.  Our trip to the Border Ranges was canned due to the horrendous weather detroying the only road to where we were headed so we had to return to base and head out first thing the next morning to a different site.  One of the jobs of a standard rifleman Private is sentry/picket.  It's not fun... but everyone has to do it.  This time it was my turn to do picket.  I had my weapon prepared for the worst (year right) and I made the short trek to where the sentry position was.  I tapped the dude on the feet, he got up and I proceeded to position myself on the ground.  I plonked down fairly hard I must admit but I think I scared the willys out of this trapdoor spider residing close to my elbow.  He flew out of his trapdoor and scurried into the surrounding bush.  Now, anyone that knows me, knows I HATE spiders.  Anything with hair simply freaks me out.  I didn't breathe for quite some time... my body was stiff for the next 10 minutes and even if there were any enemy out there, I wouldn't have noticed.  Needless to say that when Gaunt and I were told that we would be doing alternative pickets for the next whole day because the rest of the platoon was going to be practising platoon attacks I wasn't impressed.  However, I did get pleny of sleep that day when I wasn't 'on' and platoon attacks just hurt your knees anyway :)  Wow... well if you got to the end of that rather long winded story (sorry bout that :P ) you must be more bored than you think!  Check out the Elastic Turnip's blog to the right.  You wont be dissapointed.  Craig, imo, is the king of random hilarity.  And that was MY WEASEL PRESS man! lol... jk  Well I think this qualifies for the longest blog ever.    Yep.  So my brother and I (mostly my ingenius brother) finally managed to sort out a wireless LAN between our houses.  It's a long story but basically he can't get ADSL where he is, I can and we're only 150m apart.  Hence a wireless LAN means that we can share our ADSL costs.... actually... they're HIS ADSL costs.. but it means he can have it too which is awesome.  So what are you doing this Sunday morning?  Here's a thought!  Get yourself out of bed 20 minutes early, spend a little time with the Man upstairs and then head on over to NewLife for some pumping worship and a Philippians 3 preach-a-thon... no I'm kidding.  But seriously, there's so much stuff in Philippians 3 that I could just keep going!  Check it out if you haven't been before.  10:30am... it's going to rock!

      So I get up this morning (I love starting my blog with 'so' for some reason.  It seems to be such a great starting device for the continuation of this one sided conversation) and my 12 week old son is laughing at me.  I've got him cradled in my lap looking up at me and he's gooing and gaaing and making all kinds of baby, heart melting noises and I'm fully encouraging it.  For some reason it seems to be the perfect start to the day... save spending time with God obviously :)  I looked out the backyard this morning to see a plethora of fun activities that I should be pursuing today but none that REALLY tickle my fancy... except moving the 10 (yes ten) bags of chipbark and rubbish (all mixed in together) out to the front so that tonight I can slip them into other people's unsuspecting wizbins for the early morning pickup tomorrow.  Is that legit?  Do people mind that or is there suome unwritted rule that says you can't rid your house of excess garbage in other people's hald filled wizbins.  I dunno.  Maybe I should check it out.    Finally got my Christmas pressie by courier the other day.  I'm fully stoked.  C&C Generals would have to be one of the greatest RTS games ever produced in my opinion and I'm looking forward to playing it online in a few days or so.   I think I'm getting Zero Hour (the expansion pack) for my birthday from my brother.  It was so funny... he was complaining that something was going to take 10-12 days for delivery.. and I'm like, "What is?"... and he's like... Ummm... nothing! LOL  So, just in case you haven't heard, I'm asking for cash, moolah, dollars, money and dosh or any combination of them for my birthday because I'd love to get a new graphics card for my computer.  So all of those people out there that read my blog and were looking for a present for me, the search has ended!  Visit your nearest ATM for a gift for Darren... it's that simple!!   Well, I really should be getting back to the backyard and it's relevant issues and friends (oh, btw if you're in the market for 2 lovely dogs and you have an escape proof yard, then contact me!  Nah... just jokes Beck :)

      I'm intrigued... does anyone out there who actually reads my blog, read through my old posts?  Does the most recent blog have to just be better and better?  Is it like everything else we experience in our Western, fast paced, dissatisfied culture?  Do I have to 'please' my audience more and more, making the blog better and better every single post?!  Nah...

      Wow... what a day eh?   We had the largest service ever I think actually.  We even had to drag the white plastic chairs from out the front in to seat everyone... 46 in total.  And there was still plenty away.  One of our YWAM DTS' goes on Outreach soon so keep your prayers up for them.  There's still lots of finance to come through and they'll need prayer for the mission too.  Fell asleep on the lounge this arvo... for 2 hours!  Kinda feel like I can stay up late now... funny how that works.  So how's your devotional life eh?  Mine's been a little up and down over the past week.  Can I add that it's one of the most important aspects of our Christian lives.  If you're reading this (and got this far) but you're not a Christian, let me just tell you that the life I have now... with God.... is THE most fulfilling life anyone can ever have.  Not fulfilled?  I know the reason.  Email me on darren@planetnewlife.org, msn me on oxygenonline7@hotmail.com or icq me on 18498580 and we'll chat :)  Go the fro

      A quick blog for now as in 20 minutes I'm finally due to get my hair cut!  I can't believe the phenomenal price of mens haircuts these days!  19 bucks to get a few hairs shortened with a few quick snips from the specialty scissors.  For me, I need my hair cut every 4-5 weeks otherwise it looks like it does now... I think I'm at 6 or 7 weeks right now and even my wife is commenting lol.  So I fully expect to look considerably different at tomorrow's service than what I did last Sunday night.  Lets hope considerably better lol.   One thing I'm sick of is the worlds notion that looks is everything (after me hoping to look better, it seems that I too am affected).  People are so concerned with looks and themselves that they fail to see past their makeup, their face lifts and their tummy tucks and see something of eternal value.  I'm sick of the world and the state it's in.  I'm sick of how people are being conned into thinking that it's all about them, that self is the most important thing, that they should look after number 1.  No. 1 should be the Man upstairs in my strong opinion.  Anthony and I were talking about this on Thursday night at coffee... people can seek all they want to satisfy themselves... in money, things, relationships, sex, filth, evil, crime, etc but they'll never be fulfilled until they realise that it's NOT about them... it's NOT about satisfying self... it's about being selfLESS, NOT living for self but living for GOD!  The sooner people understand this the sooner our society will turn around and start becoming a society that we were meant to be.  Mad at the world... great name for that old band... and just how I'm feeling right now.  Gets the spiritual juices flowing... try it someday.

      Last night I went and saw Lord of the Rings: Return of the King.  My goodness.  Has there been a better movie ever created?  I think NOT!  It was simply amazing.  Now I haven't read all the books (still trying to get through the long FotR) so I haven't judged the movie from a book-to-movie perspective  but still.... I left the cinema a little stunned it was so good.  The intensity was amazing, the fighting awesome, characters and acting excellent, plot and story tie-ins superb and the cinematography was stunning.  I'd be making a huge call but I think that for me, it was even better than the Matrix.  Well my message for tomorrow is done too, so today will be filled with family activities, squash with Glenn and Ben and some good ol' relaxing.    Hope you're having a great one.

      Happy new year peoples... the night before was fun (friends, food, fun and fireworks) and now we're fully engaged into 2004.  COOL!  Ok, here's the deal.  For those of you that start blogs, email me on darren@planetnewlfe.org and I'll add you to my site.  Notice that the lovely Steve Hadden has got his link fixed on my site now... maybe we can get a little community happening here ;)  Life's been great thanks!  Today Beck and I veged in front of 3 great movies on the lounge (praise the Lord for that lounge!).  It was great!  Glenn and El came over for the last 2 and we had heaps of fun together.  Then... da da da daaaaa... the study got a full makeover (got cleaned finally!).  So tomorrow's sermon prep will be completed in a lovely office, free of clutter, mess and dust... and random piles of paper everywhere!  YAY!  This month, I'm preaching through Philippians.  Can't wait... I think it's my favourite book of the Bible!  Imagine me when God tells me that I'm preaching on it this month!  I'm stoked.  Looking forward to putting finger to keyboard tomorrow and listening to the voice of God more.  Darren's tip of the day - get off the internet, get your Bible, a notebook and a pen and go pray, read and journal.  You'll be stoked you did!

      Last night's Victory Network screening of The Passion of the Christ was great.  7 people came to Christ and hundreds of seeds were planted.  It was a great thing to be a part of and I was privileged to give an altar call at the end for anyone wishing to respond.    The movie is totally powerful and very shocking and real.  In my opinion the truth wasn't stretched in any way and it was an accurate portrayal of the last 12 hours of Christ's life.  However it is totally brutal and very impacting and I honestly don't wish to see it again for a while.  So what was the Passion of the Christ anyway?  The Passion of the Christ is you.  If you see the movie you'll understand why I believe God's love is so incredibly amazingly HUGE!!!  God loves us so much that He was willing to come to earth and die the most excruciating, humiliating death possible.  He did that for you.  Our response can only be to accept His forgiveness that was made possible through the Cross, start a relationship with Him and start living to glorify Him.  That's the only reasonable response!  Hope you see the movie and are challenged to deeped your commitment to Christ... he sure proved how deep his commitment is to us.

      Just been praying and had some great revelation that I thought I'd reveal to the world of blog.  If you're a Christian, I hope you get plenty out of this in your relationship with God.  If not, God's forgiveness is real and totally powerful.  So here's an actual excerpt from my journal today - I'm being totally transparent here so have grace!  "REVELATION!  I've been strugging in my relationship with God recently, last week I discovered that guilt was inhibiting me from really getting to God and living in His presence.  So I've been pretty good on the guilt front... or so I thought.  I've just been asiking God what my problem is.  I think that I'm having troubles accepting God's forgiveness.  God is readily forgiving me but I'm not accepting it, instead choosing to live in my guilt and unworthiness and trying to  live my lift to earn God's favour.  How stupid.  I can't  earn  the favour of God!  If I try to live outside of God's forgiveness then it's just like I'm trying to be saved by works!  It simply can't happen!  Rejecting the forgivenss of God doesn't all us the freedom from guilt of that sin that was committed, it moves to a life of works not grace and it suggests that God's forgiveness isn't good enough to cover your sin, hence the cross isn't enough. Accepting God's forgiveness also re-establishes our relationship with Him, the most important aspect of our faith.

      How great is my life?!  Yesterday was the largest NewLife service on record.  53 people showed up to our 50 seat building.. yes... 3 people had to sit on the benches.  I don't think they really minded either!  The whole service was amazing.   The people just kept pouring in, people were there on time (for the most part), many people were back, we had about 8 new people there, the worship was totally cool including the 2 new songs we did (Face to Face - Paul Baloche and Prepare the Way - New Life Worship - Colorado Springs... you know... Ted Haggards church) and people actually laughed at my jokes.  I mean... does it get any better than that?!  Last night we invited Beck's cousin to The Passion on Wednesday and he's totally keen.  That's about 9 people we're bringing :)  It's so going to rock!  I'm still a little nervous about the whole altar call thingy at the end but that's probably a good way to be.  That was I'll be relying on God for strength and confidence instead of relying on my own ability to put words together in sentence fashion in front of a whole load of people.... 724 to be precise!  It's so great that we've sold all the tickets too.  AND that all the cinemas across Newcastle are showing the movie heaps.     If you go and see the Passion from Wednesday onwards and you're unsure of what to think or believe, email me on darren@planetnewlife.org, icq me on 18498580 or msn me on oxygenonline7@hotmail.com and you can ask all the questions you want.  Have a great day...

      You know those once in a lifetime moments (they happen almost weekly for me now) where your lightning fast reflexes do something that even you can't believe?  I'm shooing a fly as I walk out of Merewether Baths the other day when Jamie and I took some of our kids down to the pool and my left hand goes up as if I can catch the fly in it.  My index finger and my thumb actually CATCH the fly and kill it in one fail swoop.  I can't believe it.   I'm standing there looking around, as I discard the fly remains, wondering if anyone saw this momentus event.  If anyone would like a replay, please ask me next time you see me... this has to be seen to be believed!  Hmmm... actually the chances of an ACTUAL replay are small :)  The other snake-like-reflex moment that often comes to mind was when I was at Rachel's party a couple years back and we're eating some sort of dish that required a bowl and fork.  There were only plastic forks left and I noticed that the guy on the OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM had them.  He was with a few friends and they were having a joke around so I asked if he could throw me a fork.  He picks up the plastic fork, throws it across the room, I catch it in my thumb and first 2 fingers ala chopstick style and start casually eating my food as if it was nothing.  The group of guys on the other side of the room are all standing there jaws open wondering how the heck I caught that and started eating my food like it was nothing!  One of them's like, "Nice catch dude" and I'm like, "Yeah, thanks" as if it was nothing.    I was discussing these moments with Luke Nahasapeemapetilon (Narayanan) at work last week and we were laughing that on the outside you're calm, cool and totally casual about the reflex moment but on the inside you're like, "OH MY GOODNESS!!!  HOW GOOD WAS THAT!!?!  I TOTALLY CAN'T BELIEVE I CAUGHT THAT FLY/FORK/BALL/(Insert caught thingy here)!!!!!  DID ANYONE SEE THAT?!  WOW!  MAN I'M GOOD!"   That tends to be the general thought process.  Have a great reflex action day ;)

      Good news for the Australian Christian culture... The Passion seems to be showing at all major cinemas around the country.  In Newcastle, both Greater Union cinemas in Newcastle AND Glendale are showing up to 5 screenings per day and Hoyts at Charlestown is showing 5 screenings a day after the start of the movie's release.  I'm stoked... that more people will be able to see the movie, that it's being advertised heavily (previews before other movies, Cinebuzz and Hoyts Mailer features), that there are many screenings for people to see it at, that it's MA15+ and not R18+ and lastly.... that I'll get to see it in the Senstadium at Glendale!!!    So what are we doing to help people understand the meaning and the relevance behind The Passion?   Do we have people standing at each cinema handing out brochures?  Is there any form of interest-to-faith evangelism being pursued out there?!  What am I doing?!  Praying that there are others out there showing people what to do with this newfound life changing information that's what!  Working a 22 hr week outside of running a growing church doesn't spare me a great deal of time.  But if you want to, we can get a flashy brochure put together and you can stand in the cinema foyer handing them out and showing people how to get saved!  It would be great!!!  For all those people that have a couple of hours spare from the 25th February onwards, please email me on darren@planetnewlife.org and we'll put something together!  Good idea Darren!  *pats back :)

      Many of you regular followers of  the musings  will know that sometimes, during a light-hearted blog I get kinda on the angry side.  Sometimes this holy anger burns hotter and brighter and it just comes out in the ol' blog.     urlLink Here  is one of the reasons I get so mad at the world.  Physologists getting paid to research this?  I mean, come on!!  Revealing these ideas to this sex crazed, filthy, day-dreaming, flirtatious world is only going to give them more ideas... and how to conceal it!  It's no wonder I get cranky!    The world continues on it's surefire path to discontentment, unfulfillment and a total state of unhealth and we Christians simply look on and shake our heads.  Get praying people.  Pray during your busyness, pray travellling to work, pray at the gym, the lecture, the hallway, in your bedroom.  God is the answer to this world's complete lack of direction, meaning and fulfillment and only He can turn the tide.  I've learnt that prayer is the result of a heart connection with God and a complete frustration at the status quo.  Try it sometime.  On a lighter note... Ethan is now rolling over from his tummy tumpkins to his back :)

      The pressure of the blog sometimes consumes me.  I have Tim and Craig sitting near me complaining of the infrequency of my blog.  I'M A BUSY MAN!  It's always interesting 'holding' a blog that some people are addicted to.  Well... I'm not sure anyone is actually addicted but people sure get on your case when nothing is happening.  LOL... just joking dudes.  I'll try and be more frequent.  Had a blowout with Ethan the other night... Wednesday night to be precise.  Beck left for VSM and Ethan decided that with only a short feed and a 10 minute nap, he wasn't prepared to go back to sleep and began screaming.  I got him up for half an hour but when the grizzling happened and I put him down... to no avail.  He screamed so loud I thought he was going to damage himself!  40 minutes later I had to call Beck back from VSM to give him his much needed feed.   Man was I stressed, upset and tired.  Life is going great though.  Our Mens coffee night last night went off!   All of us came with the idea that we wanted to talk God stuff more.  And it happened.  It was amazing.  We ended up talking until 10:30pm about the Holy Sprit and other christian life stuff... was awesome.  So if you missed out, then you better get yourself along to Gloria Jeans in a fortnight and check out what you're missing!!!!

      Argh, the dreaded 45 minute intruder!  Ethan was soundly asleep when I opened this page to blog... and the darn 45 minute intruder woke him up!  Man, I'm going to do some pretty nasty things when I meet him... put laxatives in his coffee ala-Mr Bean, make him slip over on marbles ala-Home Alone and poke him in the eyes ala-The Three Stooges.  Anyway, enough banter - always wanted to use that word in a blog ;)  Last nights service WENT OFF!  Man, I love it when God totally rocks the House when worship is really happening.  We were all worshipping and the presence of God was huge.  I love it when He meets with us.    Got no idea what I'm talking about?  Visitor to this blog and are screwing up your nose at all this God stuff?  Well I've got news for you buddy.  You can search all you want throughout the rest of your life and the only thing that's really going to fulfill you is God... yep... that's right, God.  And the only way you're going to actually get to Him is through His Son Jesus.  What's up with Jesus you say?  He happens to be the only person that's going to give you any kind of a shot for heaven.  Not Muhammad, not Budda, not New Age, not crystals, not astrology or tarot reading or mysticism or any combination of Eastern religions that you think is going to satisfy you.  NONE OF THEM WILL!  THE ONLY way YOU will every be truly satisfied is THROUGH A RELATIONSHIP WITH JESUS!  GET IT?!  I'm so tired of seeing people wasting their lives looking in sex, drugs, filth, poor music that kills the soul and kicks it while it's down and other meaningless religions when Jesus is the answer.... Not fulfilled?!  I know the reason why.  It's because you're missing Jesus in your life... that's all... that's it... and that's the bottom line.  So stop wasting your life and start living it... goto  urlLink Christianity Works  and you'll discover why you were born and what you have to live for.  Go on... get over there!!!

      Well, it's only 3 days until I perform my very first wedding.   Brad and Nat, Becks brother and fiance are finally tying the knot after a HUGE 8 years of dating.  Brad used to hassle us all the time about when his nephew or neice would be arriving.  We just kept coming back with, "And when are you two getting married".  It seemed to stop the nagging remarkably well!  So we had Ethan and we figured Brad was keeping his end of the deal..... nah.. just jokes.  The two of them got engaged on Christmas Day (Natalie means Christmas apparently so it was very appropriate) and time's been counting down since then... for me included!  It's my first wedding and I have to say, I'm kinda nervous.  I know everythign will be superfine... but I just recall the speech I gave at my brothers wedding after losing my speech in my shirt pocket (it was in my jacket pocket I'm SURE of it!!!).  So I'm going to be super dooper prepared for this one.  School continues to be a hard life.  I've been finishing with Chris at 12 and chilling with the other kids for 1/2 an hour and tomorrow we're all going skin diving :)  Can't wait.  Last time we went snorkelling I saw some MASSIVE whiting... I'm talking HUGE!  Well... the snorkel and goggles amplifies the fish 25% but they still looked pretty darn big!  I'm still afraid of sharks, barnacles, oysters and the whole diving with goggles thing... but I'm doing very well.  Ever since the "3 Freaky Water Events" I've been in recovery.  Here's a rundown for your information (fyi - continually training people in nerdiness :) )  3FWE number 1 - Swimming in a normal, backyard pool at a friends 21st I pushed off to do a full length of the pool underwater and felt some pain in my foot.  I get out of the pool and realise that I've pushed off on the light fitting.... no cover, no bulb... just the fitting sitting there underwater waiting for a disaster to happen!  My foot bled constantly for over 10 minutes... Luckly the family dog was there to lick up any drops left on the side of the pool... GROSS!  3FWE number 2 - Went knee boarding (like water skiing but on your knees - duh :) ) and I managed to fall off the knee board twice on the same angle and slam my head into the water at super speeds.  My ear hurt like crazy and I didn't go back in... except for one more try when I was feeling a little better.  Same thing AGAIN!  Went to the doctor who couldn't see my ear drum (my ear canal is as small as a baby's) so he flushed my ear out with a seringe!!!!  I'm in massive amounts of pain now.  But that's nothing.  I went home, took some Panadine Forte and laid down on the lounge to recouperate.  Couldnt sleep nor hear so I figured there was still some wax preventing me from hearing (BAD BAD BAD IDEA!).  Got some of the ol' Waxsol and dropped it in.  INSTANT AMAZING AMOUNTS OF PAIN!  I screamed for 10 minutes while Beck ran around the house crying and wondering what the heck she could do.  We looked at the Waxsol afterwards... it had an acidic base.  DER ON ME!  3FWE - Number 3 (If you're still here, congratulations!) - Spear fishing with friends out at Brougton Island.  Followed the master (Tony Payne) into the water and over to the rocks - bad idea.  He's underneath the water... I'm on top.  A huge wave took me and put me on a barnacle covered rock that went up and out of the water.  I scrambled to the top knowing what another massive wave could do, tearing my hands and legs to shreds in the meantime.  Another wave took me over the rock and tumbling over 30 metres underwater away from the boat.  I look underwater at my hands and exposed body parts and realise that I've almost slashed my wrists up and my right chin was bleeding badly.  In seconds Tony is propping me up and taking me back to the boat where we discover that Tony doesn't believe in First Aid kits.  Steve (the other dude) had brought along an old flanny so we tore it up and wrapped my wounds with it like bandages.  I'm thinking, "Man, this sucks... let's go home".  BUT NOOOOOOO.... Tony and Steve spearfished for another 2 hours!  I'm lying there in the sun feeling sorry for myself and in intense pain while they bring in huge amounts of fish.  THEN I had to wait for them to gut the fish (all the while people are looking at me like I've been taken hostage and hurt deliberately)  When I got home, I took a bath in Dettol, screamed my lungs out as I picked all the pieces of barnacle out of my hands, arms and legs and then my lovely wife got home to take care of me.  There.  Now do you understand why I hate water sports!!!???!!!?  If you're still reading (I'm impressed by the way) I hope you have a great weekend and if you're a NewLifeian we'll see you Sunday night at 6:30pm.    Rock on, pray hard and dance like no one's watching.... but only if no one is watching.   Fav comment:  Be careful about reading health books. You may die of a misprint.

      For committed blog readers, here's a little prequel to what you'll hear on Sunday morning.  Craig 'Birdman' Sparrow said that I should put this on my blog for all the world to read. (Ever blogged with someone around you... man it's hard... GO AWAY CRAIG LOL)   Every person wants to have meaning and purpose to their life.  Every person wants to make something of their lives, wants to do great things, have a full life, accomplish the impossible, soar past mediocrity and be great, whatever their definition of great is.  Not many people in this world strive for failure, live to accomplish the inevitable.  No one yearns for a lack of purpose or seeks to have no direction in life at all.  Everyone wants to be great at something.   Did you see Shamus from Charlies Angels 2 on Alias the other night?  Of course not!!  You were at Cell Group!  Well for those of us who watch it religiously and taped it... we had the pleasure of watching him in yet another baddie role.  Apart from that, life's good.  Again, thanks for asking.  Blogs.... they can't all be randomly funny.

      Well I've been totally and utterly inspired by the latest blog of Stu.  Totally random and totally hilarious were my first thoughts.    Anywho, how's your day been?  I've had a remarkably fantastic day with a spot of Grandma's old whipped cream on top.  Yep, it's been a thouroughly inspiring, creative, successful, productive day.  Kids at school were great (no really), we watched a fantasic movie on sharks (which I've come to think aren't so bad afterall... except when I saw the tiger sharks totally mauling a dead sea turtle.  Speaking of sea turtles, I SAW one the other day.  It was during a really hard day at the Stockton breakwall fishing with the kids and two of them came running up to me screaming something about something and I ran down with them to see a massive, wild sea turtle preparing to dive... man was it impressive and continued to reinforce to me the amazing creativity of God (Read Genesis to see the REAL story on how the world came into being.. shouldn't take you too long).  Due to the success of my previous blog and the wonderful comments made, I've decided to stay a little  urlLink random.   That link is to test your memory and then it gives you some great tools to help improve it.  I almost forgot the link but then I remembered one of the tools and put that baby into action and voila Linkage! Ooooohhhhhh ..... Linkage.  Does anyone remember the famous Pauly Shore?  Man he was funny.  I own most of his movies on old VHS.  Man they were funny.  The old, "Weezing the ju-uice" was simply hilarious and the catch cry of my 1992 school days.  Thems were the days.  I've also realised that hardly anyone in MY congregation reads my blog.  I made the terrible mistake of asking them a few weeks ago.. and almost no-one put up their hand.  I'm like, well what the heck am I blogging for?!!!?!  It's for the likes of Ben (who's creating the new McDonalds burger, the McNevin rofl), Dan (1 o'clock sleeper man :P ), Tim (TIME magazine, memory freak) and my aunty Lorraine (called Penny) who scans my blogs infrequently looking for the word Ethan.  THERE IT IS! LOL  Ethan is doing really well btw.  He's starting to teeth which is really frustrating his clothes a lot because they're constantly getting drenched with drool and we keep having to change them.  He's also pretty fussy atm too which is getting annoying and he's starting his old sleep patterns again which is tiring Beck to no end.  On the flip side, he's reaching for stuff, learning to speak his mind, studing Chemisty and he's about to sail a steam yacht with Pope Gregory the 9th.  Seriously though, he's doing really well and we're so thankful to God for his constant growth, health and the blessing that he is.  I'm still learning that life will continue to change at break neck speed though... and that's frightening.    Vision Sunday went pretty well.  It wasn't at alive as I was expecting however.  If you're a NewLifer, ask yourself this.  Why should I get involved in the vision of my church?  If you don't know the answer, come to NewLife on Sunday and/or email me on darren@planetnewlife.org and I'll be able to help you on that one.

      I'm in kind of a weird blogging mood so I thought I'd blog!  There's just so many cool things and weird things happening in the world that it's really hard to pick one and yabber on about it for a while.   I mean, there's the amazing Starburst Sucks which I totally love (thanks Todd and Kiri for the introduction) - they're actually a lollipop made by the famous Starburst company... and I think it's funny that they called them Sucks lol.  I mean, imagine if someone didn't like them... they'd be like, 'Man, Starburst Sucks!'  And then I'd be like, "Oh man, they are soooooo nice eh? I totally love them!"... and on the saga would continue :)  And what's  urlLink this   obsession with Roy Orbison and cling wrap.... man some people are just plain weird (or as we fans of Homestar Runner like to say, 'weord').  Click  urlLink here   to change your life,  urlLink here   to download a version of the old classic game Ports of Call (it's a shipping simulation so don't get too excited) and click  urlLink here  to discover what's happening in Stu Brown's busy life.    It's the random nature of this blog that keeps you coming back isn't it?! lol  Well today's been great.  Thanks for asking.  I know you haven't really asked but what would you be here for if not to find out how Darren is?  The reality is that I'm going pretty darn well.  Vision 04 this Sunday.  If you're a NewLife person or a NewLife wannabe, don't miss out on where NewLife is going over the coming years and where you can fit into it!  It's going to be great... with a full roast dinner at the end, you just can't go wrong!  And I'm not even kidding about the roast dinner!!!  So have you checked out my friend's blogs.  I have to say... some people that I know (and love dearly) don't even check MY blog... let alone my friends!!!!  Maybe I'll set aside a full page ad for the NewLife Vision 04 document specifically to advertise my blog... COME AND CHECK OUT THE INSIDES OF PASTOR DARREN'S HEAD!  Or maybe not.  See I told you I was in a random mood!  Don't say I didn't warn you now!  Created a blog?  Email me on darren@planetnewlife.org and I'll add you... that is if you're a personal friend and not a fan of Mark Latham... jk.....

      To prevent a swag of blog-addicted people sending me nasty emails, behold!!  A blog! ;)  Today at work I had to try and sedate Chris for an extended period as he was isolated from the other students and 'working' in a little shed-type-thingy that the Work for the Dole people made out the back of our school.  Chris still managed to cause serious havoc on his way to and from the toilet several times and swear blatantly at our on-site psycologist.  An interesting morning indeed.  So this afternoon I put off the memories of the morning and focused on spending time with God and 'going up to the ramparts' for some vision revision.  It was awesome.  The plain text version of the vision document (Vision 04) is getting close to being finished (I think!) so as you can imagine, I'm pretty excited!!!!  It's been a long time coming but it was really necessary to refine, simplify and revisit the vision of our congregation.  I'm very excited with how God is going to use us (NewLife) this year and how He's going to grow us, shape us and bless us!  It really is an exciting time in our church!!!!  How cool is God?!  Anyway, my son has just joined me at the keyboard so I'd better be off.  But not before a quick blog from him!!!  444saaaaaaaU*, kln            12cxzd fjdddcdvc  Well there you have it folks... who said 5 month old babies can't blog eh? Hmmm.... we should set up a blog for Ethan... imagine that?!!!!  jk :)  Have an awesome Friday and weekend ladies and germs...

      Well I've got 7 minutes to blog!  In 7 minutes my download will finish and I'm off to Insomnia for the day.  Insomnia is a LAN (Local Area Network) which is basically a computer nerd party lol.  It's a huge event where about 60 guys (not usually too many girls although there has been some) bring along their computers, hook them up  to a few servers and war against each other in many different games and maps etc.  It's very fun and Insomnia is an outreach event put on by TLegion which I am a part of.  My role in TLegion is spiritual oversight and pastoring and leadership mentoring.  I mentor my brother who is the leader and founder of TLegion and participate in events like Insomnia in terms of relationship building, prayer, gaming with the gamers and keeping the atmosphere fun.    Gamers are a unique breed... they're unlike any other sub-culture in the world.  And they're also a sub-culture that is often forgotten about because they are usually hidden away in a dark corner of their house gaming, surfing the net or gaming online.  They can normally drink their own weight in caffine (usually Coke) and they can stay awake for long periods of time, searching for the final experience... which is usually to get to the next level in the latest game their playing.  I identify with gamers... mainly because I'm one of them.  Yep... I think I'm one of the few pastors in the world who is also a gamer.  I game to relax.... it's incredibly fun.  For example, at the current point in time, I'm playing games like Battlefield 1942, Desert Combat (a modification (mod) of BF1942), C&C Generals and Counter Strike (a counter-terrorism game).  So sue me, I like gaming!  Check out  urlLink www.tlegion.com  for more information :)

      For art at school (yes, if you weren't aware I'm a youth worker at a behaviour school) we're doing sculpture... but not your average, clay vases, bowls or figurines... we're working with airated concrete and chipping away with hammer and chisel like the greats.   It is scary however, working with kids who like to attack each other randomly (and sometimes with great and ingenious planning) when we've all got chisels and hammers and files in our hands.    But the most interesting part is watching the projects morph and change as the kids get angry.   From a turtle to an egg, from a totem head to a turtle then back to a totem head, from a piece of coral to a turtle to a block of chipped concrete that isn't supposed to be anything.... we've seen it all.  Anger management... now there's an area of life I wouldn't like to get into.  Some of the kids at school have some serious anger problems.  Chris (my client) for example gets frustrated at the drop of a hat and gets angry if someone tries to pick the hat back up... "Thats my &$*!@$ HAT!!!!".  But, that's enough about work..  Oh... just one more.  Yesterday, Stu came in to fill in for Luke Narayanan and it was such a fun day.  When Luke is onsite though... it's just as fun... no really!  But it was nice to have Stu filling in for Luke...  I've decided that I'm really great at digging holes for myself and not so great at getting out of them... Did that on Sunday in the message and I'm like... ummmm... soo..... yeah... ok..   LOL  So MY turtle is really coming along.   It's actually starting to look like a turtle now! lol  NewLife was great Sunday... another packed service.  We had 54 jam pack the building and we pre-arranged extra seating with Bruce-TheRegal-Avard.  It was a great service with several people being added to the worship team number.  Thanks Brendan and Josh for alieviating my continuous drumming saga.  Yous rock.  Just dont hit them drums too loud ya hear? :)

      Well this weekend is shaping up to be a great one!  Tonight I'm at a TLegion team-building event, tomorrow some more team building, bit of time off and then we have the ministry team for dinner, Sunday it's our 6th wedding anniversary then lunch with the fam and  urlLink NewLife  service at 6:30pm... that's PM!  Then it's back to work for the week with Monday arvo off!  Looks fun!  Life is good.  Ethan is totally cracking me up these days... he's hilarious... a total blessing.  Beck has been good too.  She's healthy and been housemaking all week... no wonder she needs some time out Saturday sometime... She's awesome and yes, her food is my favourite... despite the burnt lasagna the other night hehe.  Church is going great.  It's good to hear that people are plugging into cell groups.  They are SO important to your involvement at NewLife... but if you can't make it to one DON'T STRESS!  You can still be a part of NewLife and involved without being in one.  They're just great for plugging in.  Went for a HUGE ride with Anthony on Wednesday afternoon... about 15kms I reakon.  Went up to Birmingham Gardens and Jesmond then over to North Lambton to visit Stu and Rach but neither of them were home!  Oh well.  It was fun anyway... untill I got off the bike and collapsed.  Serves me right for not riding in 10 years... oh man that feels long.  Anyway... cyas all at NewLife Sunday night... don't miss out on hearing why We Value Unity so much :)

      Well it's bean a weak so I thought I'd beta right again.  Don't you just hate poor spelling.  I found this email the other day....  Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at an Elingsh uinervtisy, it  deosn't mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod  are, the olny iprmoetnt tihng is taht frist and lsat  ltteer is at the rghit pclae. The rset can be a toatl mses and you can sitll raed it wouthit porbelm. Tihs is bcuseae we do not  raed ervey lteter by it slef but the wrod as a  wlohe.  But it's so true!  I can read the whole thing!   Just reconfims to me the incredible nature of the human brain.  Anyways...  Yesterday was great... in fact, the whole weekend was great.  Even Friday was great!  I've started playing golf... I never thought I would because I've always hated driving (of the golf variety) but now I seem to have a knack for it.  It was great ALMOST beating Craig's butt hehe.  So Friday arvo was golf up at 'Royal' Beresfield, Saturday afternoon a friend gave me Battlefield Vietnam... a brilliant game that I had before but got convicted (surprisingly enough by the guy who bought it for me - thanks Pauly) and deleted it...  Now I'm all legit with my own copy and all.  It was SUCH a blessing.  Thanks God! :)  Saturday night was also awesome.  Kristy and Jamie came over and we played Cranium... an awesome game with a bit of everything.  We had such a great time... it was very funny!  Sunday's service was great.  Michelle from  urlLink Lakeside  came with Craig and she led worship for us because half the church was away!  She did a great job and then I preached on evangelism, looking at the prophesy of John the Baptist and how our calling is so similar.  Several people commented which always feels good.  There was a great sense of fellowship happening after the service which is really important.  Some people went down to Jesmond Park for Hamburgers and Fish and Chips which I'm sure was a great time too.     I'm really understanding to new levels how important fellowship is in a church.  Fellowship isn't just talking, it's sharing each others lives, it's partnering togther for one cause through relationship building.  It's been said that it's sometimes hard to fit in in a new church... I think it's only as hard as you make it.  Fellowship is so worth the effort.  Sure, every church needs to look out for new people, make them feel welcome, invite them to stuff and introduce them around but there's only so much the church can do.  Each new person also needs to make the effort to become a part of the church.   Good fellowship is so essential to a growing, vibrant, life-giving church.  Keep up the good work troops!  Gtg.  Cya in less than a week for some more brave, fresh blogging action...   Is it brave?  Joining the army is more brave... SKYDIVING!  Now THAT'S BRAVE! :)

      Well the wireless LAN that my brother and I (mainly my brother) have set up between our houses was almost up today.  If it wasn't for that dodgy wireless access point that Glenn is taking back AGAIN for warranty today, we'd be up and running.  All 3 antennas are working perfectly and all cables except for mine which has corroded from the heat in the roof of our house.  SO... in 2 weeks, when it gets back, we'll all have internet, lanning fun 24/7.  HURRAH!  Yesterday was great.  Our service at NewLife went really well.  There was a great feel about the whole service, great life-giving fellowship, great worship and the message and vision extra went over really well too.    Last night's message at Victory went off as well!  It was pretty huge being the middle of both camps and the response was excellent.  I really felt like I went up a level yesterday.  I felt stretched both morning and night.    Bill Hybels is great.  During the conference that we went to in Feb last year, he stayed at his notes, wording everything carefully and he didn't really move around that much.  That gave me a great sense of freedom NOT to need to move around so much.  Sometimes it's important to say the right things, sometimes it's important to word things just right so that they are received with the right spirit so watching Bill speak was very liberating in that sense for me.  Thanks Bill!  Anyway, this week should be fun.. however I think we've already filled it up with stuff!  ARGH!  Oh well.  Tomorrow is war movie day with The Fahey, wednesday Beck will be out for some well earned beauty treatment (before the voucher runs out that is!), thursday we have the Mullers for lunch which is about time and will be great... and friday.... well... friday I'll have to make sure that I have my message finished for Sunday morning.  Hope your week is looking as full and fun as mine... catch ya

      Well I might add it's annoying not having titles for my blogs.  I'll have to work out one day how to put them back in.  This new skin didn't have them.  Oh well.  I have to say, I'm really enjoying researching Sunday nights message.  I was reading through some of the TIME Top 100 influencers of the 20th Century (Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King, Adolf Hitler etc) and learning HEAPS.  Learning stuff about stuff you never learned stuff about in school is heaps good... Stuff it's good!  So I'm definately committed to learning more stuff!   Gives me a wider perspective as a human, allows me to have more material and illustrations for sermons and helps me live a more rounded life I think!  So yesterday it was all read read read.  Today's been a bit of study with some of Tuesday night's Alias thrown in (my bro and his wife hadn't seen it yet... so we were glad to accommodate (it was awesome)).  Been spending a lot of good time with my wife and son too.  He's such a classic.  Ethan is now sitting up, doing a bit of a clicking noise with his tongue in response to Beck (he doesnt do it with me yet - argh), he's reaching for just about everything (except me... and no I don't have a complex) and he's just started on his new pattern this week which has been trying but suprisingly not as trying as we first thought :).  So what do you do if someone says you're in denial but you're not?  Anyway... on that note, have a great rest of the week.  If you're a NewLifer, Sunday's service is 10:30am (sorry about the pm displayed on Planetnewlife last week - all those that showed up to NewLife last week at 10:30pm please send an email to darren@planetnewlife.org and we'll take you out to Henny Penny for some baked dinner fun!)

      My friend Paul is here with me and just alerted me to my original FREAKY WATER EXPERIENCE.    When I was young I remember now being woken up by a HUGE FREAKY dream that i had about swimming in a fishbowl and having this MASSIVE (and freaky) fish chasing me for several hours around this crazy, round bowl.   MAN that's scary... when you're a kid and you dream something like that... and it seems real... it totally freaks you out and you wake up crying.... or worse... wet.  Thanks Paul for reminding me that my life in the water is not recommended... again.  Peace out.... ;)

      Just a quick blog...  Tomorrow is the celebration of the greatest day in human history.  The resurrection of Christ.  My faith is based on this awesome historical figure and his resurrection is essential.  All of us are trying to find hope somewhere.  Each of us is looking for answers, truth, the way to heaven and fulfilment in life.    I have all of these... through Jesus.  Like it or lump it, Jesus is the only way you are ever truly going to be fulfilled.  Trust me I'm a car salesman.... lol.  If you are searching for the truth, if you haven't found the reason you exist yet, then consider Jesus.  Through Jesus, God paved a way for you and I to get to heaven.  We also get a real, actual relationship with God, forgiveness of all the wrong we've ever done, an amazing sense of peace and hope and a faith that clears mountains.... sounds a little corny-email to me lol. (NewLife joke - if you remember!).  Goto  urlLink www.christianityworks.com  and find some hope there.  Without Jesus in your life, you will forever be unfulfilled.  And that.... is a fact.

      Well I tried blogging this afternoon but my DSL connection was lost and it didn't save!  So I'm here to type out my 'thoughts' again for you all to get your fix :)  The wedding on the weekend was totally amazing.  The ceremony went over without a hitch and all involved were extremely happy with the way I did it and my brief message as well.  In fact.... Beck and I were approached by dozens of people wanting to say thanks for such a *&*^% great ceremony and that they were touched and challenged by what was said.  Not only that but we both had continuous conversations with many people throughout the afternoon and evening about our beliefs, our church, purpose, marriage, God and other things God related!  It was simply incredible and we praise God for it.  I prayed hard that the wedding would be great... I also prayed that God would somehow use what I said to really touch people and give them an alternative but very relevant approach to life, marriage and love.... and it happened!  All glory to God for everything that happened and all that He did through it.    The whole weekend was totally amazing but we were very happy to get home on Sunday afternoon.  Sunday night's NewLife service went off!!!  The worship was amazing (thanks Stu, Kristy, Brendan, Zach and Josh!) and I was really happy with the message too (thanks GOD!).  Had an average night service attendance too so that was nice :)  I hope God continues to challenge you and bless you. If this blog goes 'down' for a period of time I'm trying to implement a skin... soo we'll see about that one ;)

      Wow, what a productive day!  I've totally cleaned up my less than tidy office and now it looks almost awesome!  Strangely enough it also looks twice it's size.  Least I'll be able to pack twice as much junk in there now :)  Ethan, we think, has been sick the past couple of days... not sleeping well during the day, runny nose(that's what gave it away!), sleeping well at nights, grizzly all the time and crying without reason (they tell us this can happen anyway but I don't believe it!).  So you could pray for him and us to know what to do, that'd be great!  Preaching at Eastside tomorrow.  Have a pulpit swap with Ashley so that should be great!  I'm looking forward to it, but a little sad that I'm going to miss our own service!  It's all good.  I'll be back in time for the fellowship folks so someone save me one of those yummy chocolate cookies :)  This week has gone really fast.  I've done heaps but seem to forget most of what's happened!  That happens when you get old I've heard... 27... now that's getting old.  25 was a great age, anything before that was great too... 26 was mature... but 27... that's when my mum had me, that's getting close to 30, it's part the 1/4 century and by this time cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin had already became the first person in space.  Man... life goes way too quickly.  So... who are you inviting to church this Sunday?  Don't neglect praying for your friends and family's salvation.  Keep on it!  Let's be committed to seeing people saved this year.  Next Sunday we'll have some sweet postcards for you to hand out to people to increase NewLife's awareness out there and hopefully see more people come to church and to faith!  Have fun and I'll see yous after church tomorrow :)  Later!

      Well it's late so I'll be brief...  as if that was possible!  This morning's service was good.  Low on numbers again but we had several people sick, some away, our YWAM DTS still on ourreach and several unnaccounted for.  It's a weird dynamic the whole GenX (or Generation: Soul as I discovered at this amazing conference) and the local church.  They're looking for something relational (check), vibrant (check), something aimed at them (check), something fulfilling and a learning experience (check) yet still we experience a significant turnover of people.  Still... I'm not going to give up.  One of our new people showed up with 2 friends today so that was great. Still only hitting the 30's though which is a little disheartening but we'll keep soldiering on.  IF you've been watching MRR (My Restaurant Rules) then you'll know that Adelaide just got the flick.  Beck thought they had what it took to win the whole thing but those crazy cats and their scooter incidents booted them from the game.  I really hope Perth win.  I mean... Perth is so easy to type... most of the letters are on the top row of the keyboard, it's the shortest name to write and, hey, let's face it, Perth doesn't sound weird when an American Airline Pilot says it.  That's my pick anyway. (Of course I'll edit this blog in the case of Melbourne actually winning hehe)  Have a great week, stay close to God, get your prayer life happening and I'll see you at cell, at church or around the traps... Comment away!

      Well yesterday at work was more than interesting.  Started off with me doing my great basketball moves in an attempt to keep the rascals from stealing the ball.  I didn't notice the slimy piece of pear that was sitting comfortably on the pavers in the morning sun and I slipped rather awkwardly falling hard on the ground.  Grazed kneecaps and hands and sore bones was the unfortunate result... and a considerable loss of dignity lol.  Also in attempting to play-wrestle a child back to the table (from off a fence I might add) I was accidently punched in the right eye.  Now this wasn't any old play punch.  This was an ADHD, 14 year old child flailing his arms about madly, all in fun, but I can tell you that my eye wasn't having much fun!!!  Today however, was much more fun.  Visited Chris in Raymond Terrace only to find that he wasn't home but was down the street.  Found him after minimal searching and was told in very clear terms that he wouldn't be doing schoolwork today but had decided to help one of his many many friends fix his car.  Was a lovely, relaxing drive to Raymond Terrace anyway :)  Well tomorrow afternoon I'm off to an evangelism conference in Sydney called GENERATION:SOUL.  Looks like it's going to be great.  Can't wait to see what I'm going to learn and bring back from it.  Will be staying with my sister and bro in law on Thurs/Fri nights so that will rock too.  Just need to find the time to work on my message!  Stay safe, rock on and keep sowing into your devotional life.  Have fun!  Darren.

      Wow... what a huge day.  Church cranked this morning.  I brought a heavy message on repentance and it was taken well and people responded accordingly.  Praise God.  It was a hard message to bring... not something I'm used to preaching but God keeps taking me to new levels and for that I'm totally grateful.  Hour of Power tonight was incredible.  If you weren't there (and all but 5 of you weren't) you totally missed out on an awesome time of prayer for our church and our city.  It's only 2 hours a month and totally worth it.  So how's your devotional life going?  Prayer is so important to the Christian.  I was thinking tonight what it would be like to go without water for a whole day (and other liquids including Coke and the infamous Dr Pepper).  Then imagine that for a week... your mouth is dry, you start to feel weak, your tongue is sore, you have serious headaches and you can't breathe properly... How are you feeling?  Thirsty?!?!  That's what your Christian life is like without prayer.  We simply can't function at all without adequate prayer in our lives... All those physical side effects transfer almost perfectly to our spiritual condition.  We mustn't neglect our prayer life.  Prayer moves the hand of God, it aligns our will with Gods and it enables us to help stuff happen... said so eloquently again LOL.  Well, hope to see you at cell this week and Men's Coffee too... actually I wont be at Men's Coffee... going to an Evangelism Conference in Sydney on Thursday nite and Friday, Saturday.  Have an awesome week and stay close to God.  Rock on as always :)

      It's been way too long since my last post so I thought I'd better get my fix hehe.  An interesting week it's been so far.  Work has been pretty good, however the kids have been inventing new ways to test and try their youth workers and teachers... that hasn't necessarily been all that fun.  I was also asked to leave Jesmond Centre yesterday because apparently droppong off letters to businesses is against the law.  I was embarrassed, humiliated and left wondering what the heck happened.  It was an interesting afternoon... printing out 72 letters, signing them all, printing envelopes for them all, packaging them up and delivering only 15 or so of them.  ARGH!  Still... I will not be deterred.  There's always a different way to approach something.  And I know tons of ways to swing cats... I mean... isn't that what cats are for?  Personally things are going really well.  I've been really close to God all day which has been amazing... especially at work!  I've been keeping the communication lines open and I had a good time with Him this morning.  Amazing how much a difference it makes.  This week at  urlLink NewLife  I'm preaching on Deeper Living... because that's where God is calling us.  I love it.  Bring on the deeper levels of our relationship with Him, our service to Him, our sense of His presence and Him working through us to accomplish His will... that's so what I'm after.  Are you?  How much are you prepared to do in order to see God move more powerfully in your life?  THAT'S the question.  For me?  As much as it takes... and yes that's easier to type than live... but I'm trying my best :)  Rock on troops... love you all.  Oh and you can now post comments on my blogs... enjoy!

      Man I'm glad the loser t-shirts are on their way out.   I was getting sick and tired of seeing negative words plastered all over people who have been created in the image of God and who have potential for totally awesome things.  I'm enjoying the random words plastered over the latest fashion in t-shirts these days, the numbers and the style (and you thought I didn't care for style :)).   Today's been great.  Went shopping with my beautiful wife this morning... she's in dire need of some new jeans so we found some great ones at Just Jeans in Westfield Kotara (still can't get used to that).  You'd think that Just Jeans wouldn't sell anything else would you?  I mean, isn't the store totally dedicated to JUST JEANS?  I'm sure someone will sue them for that one day sooner or later... "Man, I bought a shirt in there, tried to wear it as jeans and now I have some REALLY bad lacerations!!!"  LOL  So who's ready to fast with me?  Man I hate fasting.  It has to be one of the hardest things God has called us to do.  I mean, go without WHAT???!!  FOOD?!  You can't be serious God?!!  Surely something else, like TV or my computer or chatting on the internet... or at least make it less harsh... fasting without soya beans or lentils or asparagus, zucchini or brussel sprouts... Now THAT'S fasting I can handle!  Every Tuesday for a while I'm going to fast.  Each week I might change my purpose for fasting but I'm determined to do it.  A lifestyle of prayer AND fasting accomplishes more and is more powerful and close to God than a lifestyle of just prayer.  Why?  Because fasting releases something that even intercession can't.  Remember what Jesus said to his disciples about a certain type of demon?  "This type can only come out with prayer and fasting".  That says something to me.  Join me for NewLife's Powerful Weight Loss Program... and fast breakfast and lunch (no snacking either until dinner) every Tuesday.  Let's see more stuff happen more quickly... so gracefully said.  Later!

      I'm sitting in the library at St Philips with my kids from DALE.  They're laughing about a silly mistake that young Ben made when he said 'bong drums'.  I can't imagine anything more exciting.... sarcasm reigns... hehe  Apart from these 6 kids playing havoc with these computers and with each other's self esteems and lives... everything is great!  Only saw my family awake for 5 minutes this morning.... but I'll be going home in 1/2 an hour anyway so that'll be good.  Men's coffee tonight which should be great... meet at Gloria Jeans at Jesmond at 7:30pm for some fellowship and sharpening (iron sharpens iron etc :) ).  I look forward to it every fortnight... it's great to get the guys together and sharpen up.  If you can't get there (need a lift etc) let me know... call my mobile on 0404020777 and we'll organise a lift for you.  Always good to have plenty of guys there.  BTW... read the blog below if you haven't already... funny as... that poor real estate agent would have laughed his way home... LOL.  Hope life is great for you and that your devotional life is continually getting better.  D.

      Sometimes you think that life simply can't get any funnier... and then it does.     We had a call the other day from a Jesmond Real Estate who were doing free market appraisals.  Beck took the call and she thought it would be interesting to know.  Today, the real estate agent came around and did the appraisal.  He looked through the house, out the front, out the back and so on.  While he was out the back our 2 dogs were extra friendly (if you've met them you know what that means) and took much notice of him.   Recently the dogs have been rummaging through our laundry even though we try to keep them out of the laundry, sometimes the door is left wide open and they are free to peruse and take what they please.  The other day Beck noticed a pair of my not-so-good underpants lying on the back slate area.  We were quick to roll our eyes but neither of us did anything about it.  A couple of days later we noticed a pair of Beck's underpants doing a similar thing... both had been damaged beyond repair but were still recongisable.   Anyway... Stella in her wisdom, decided that while the real estate agent was over and while he had one leg up on the stair out the back, that she'd ever so carefully place Beck's underpants on his leg... to which Beck was simply mortified to discover.   We simply can't imagine the story that this guy's wife is going to be told tonight when he gets home!  "You wouldn't believe what happened today honey!" LOL  Anyway... life continues to poke us and make fun of us... and all along, we're thinking it's hilarious.   CORRECTION  On a previous blog Beck's amazing cooking was seemingly challenged. However: "Beck's Lasagne was not burnt but merely well cooked...with love" - From Beck  Hope ur all having fun... if not, at least have some at the Chapmans expense :)

      Hi all.  It's been a week so I thought I'd better blogsicle once more.  Apparently the blogging bug has been waning around the world.  Many people, once keen to blog have let it slip and according to statistics only approx 20% of bloggers are still avid.    Beck's discovered that I can't say some words properly (I'm sure this is going to kill me for telling you this).  She's intrigued that I can't say muesli, Anglican and... yes... you read correctly... congregation... I can't say them right!!!   It drives me crazy sometimes because NewLife is a part of the Victory Network and in many references, we call ourselves not a church but one congregation of many in One Church (VN).  Hence I have to use the word more often than I'd like (in preaching, sharing, talking about the Victory Network etc) and it leads me rather quickly to frustration.  At least I can say all the stuff my mum can't... but I'll bet she can say congregation!!!  However in many ways, this slight speech impediment (peech inspediment like my father calls it) is the least of my worries.  But due to the faith growing No Limits conference, I'm choosing FAITH over WORRY these days... it's much healthier!  Choosing faith over worry is such a great concept and I'm really enjoying it.  I really believe that faith and worry are choices that we make... don't let worry consume you!  Matt 6:34 says, "Therefore, do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about itself.  Each day has enough troubles of it's own".  I agree... don't worry... have faith... worry is a choice you don't have to make.  Till next installment... rock on peoples :)

      Just got back from our Senior Ministers Retreat at Pokolbin and man we had a blast.  Lots of laughs, many productive sessions of vision sharing and personal help etc... it truely was fantastic.  And the golf!  OH the golf!  Check  urlLink here  for scores!  Didn't do too well but I don't care... it's all fun.   Ethan was a bit of a nightmare for the whole retreat however.... strange people, strange place, extended time, too much light coming into his room too early in the morning... it was incredibly frustrating and annoying how upset he was and fussy he was all the time.  I'm sure the others didn't appreciate his constant whinging and we're really sorry for it.  It was annoying for us let alone you guys!  Next year, he'll be at his grandparents place or somewhere else!  Meeting Mark and Darlene Zschech was great too.  They came up on Sunday night and we went out for dinner then went back and talked Mercy Ministies till late.  Monday morning we talked Mercy again until 11am when they had to go.  They are both incredible people and we really connected well with them.  Meeting Darlene I have to say was pretty special.  She's such a great Australian Christian icon, it was a real privilege to meet her, Mark and Zoe.  You'll have to come to NewLife on Sunday for any announcements about Mercy (or another Victory Network congregation).  I'm not at liberty to discuss it here.    I thank God for what He is doing in me right now.  He's stretching me, growing me and challenging me to step even deeper into the river of God.  I'm so challenged right now... deep into the core of my soul have I been stirred.  And the results are going to be great.  I'm really looking forward to finding my prayer voice too.  Check Planetnewlife's files section in a few days or a week or so for the notes I took at the conference.  I'm making them available for everyone's benefit.  I was so gobsmacked that I wanted everyone to benefit from it if they didn't take notes... that'll be coming soon.  Well this has been long enough... rock on and I'll catch you soon hopefully.  Bless ya!

      Well I have to say, the No Limits Conference was totally amazing.  If you missed it, you sure did.  However, I have secretly arranged for some dvd's to be made so that more Victory Network people (including you NewLifers!!!) can benefit from the faith building messages the speakers brought.  Mark and Bernie Kelsey were down to earth, funny and inspiring, Phil Pringle was amazing, hilarious but deep and faith building and Ian Jagelman brought his new leadership teaching on going from vision to reality which was systematic, enlightening and totally excellent and a must-use!  Hopefully we'll have the DVD's within a few weeks and we'll be having a couple of screenings of some of the above speakers.  Don't miss out when this opportunity comes around again... it was totally faith building for me and both Beck and I loved the conference.  Praise God for such a great time with His people, growing!  I have so much to process... all of us who went to the conference do I'm sure. I took 19 handwritten A4 pages of notes throughout the conference.  I HAVE A LOT TO PROCESS!  Hehehe.  It's great though... it was so good to sit under the teaching of these prominent, established, faithful, groundbreaking leaders.  It was totally inspiring.  It's retreat time for the Senior Ministers again too (finally!).  Man I'm looking forward to it.  I think we all need a little bit of a retreat after the conference.  Thanks to all who helped and made the conference possible.  Thanks also to the NewLife/Lakeside team who played last night, it was incredible and the Spirit of God moved powerfully.  Also don't miss Beck preaching TOMORROW morning!!!  She's going to be great.  Come ready for God to do a new work in you.  Come expectant.  Come ready and willing.  I can't wait to see the great things God is going to pour out on us at NewLife over the next few months.  All I can say is BRING IT ON!    Bring a friend tomorrow.  You never know what God wants to do through you and in that person.  Let's become an inviting church, a church that is inviting from the outside but also a church that invites it's friends and family to experience the great things that God is doing.  Have fun and I'll see you tomorrow!

      What an up and down week already?!  Had a massive headache yesterday and the remnants still haven't gone.  I'm thinking it's spiritual because I didn't sleep much at all last night, neither did Beck and I never get headaches!  Hence today I've been totally stuffed, sitting here wondering what to do, my brain going around in circles, my body aching from squash yesterday (yes, I got  urlLink slaughtered ) and my eyes are a little fuzzy.... speaking of fuzzy, I picked up my brother's fandangled Gateway 19" flatscreen monitor yesterday and it's awesome but a little fuzzy... I've been playing with the settings and I really shouldn't do that... now I need glasses to look at the computer... ARGH!  Well the No Limits Conference starts tonight!  It's going to be good.  I'm really looking forward to being challenged and taught by the speakers.  I really encourage you to go.  If you can't afford $80 for the whole conference it's only $20 per session and each night rally (starting at 7:30pm at Victory) is FREE!  So don't miss it!  You'd be crazy to miss out on these calibre speakers, in OUR city for free... by these I mean, Mark and Bernie Kelsey, Phil Pringle, Ian Jagelman, Phil Dooley and Mike Murphy.  You can't honestly tell me you wouldn't like these guys speaking into your life?!  If you can't afford to go, email me on darren@planetnewlife.org and we'll see what we can arrange.  See you tonight for some limit breaking stuff!  Rock on.

      Today was great.  Finished my message first thing this morning, then some gaming action (kicked butt in online BFV), had time with Ethan while Beck shopped, went to Craig and Cal's Engagement Party (18 cakes man, I was soooo stuffed (just kidding... but it seemed like the cake line was never going to stop!)), came home, did a powerpoint for tomorrow (but I still encourage you to bring your Bibles tomorrow NewLifers!) and now.... well it looks like I'm blogging!  Gearing up for a nice relaxing evening actually.  It's only 5:30 and I'm all set for tomorrow.  Do need to do some praying though which will be good.  For the small percentage of NewLifers that read this before tomorrow... or before any Sunday, I want to really encourage you to come to church expectant.  Expect God to do something great in you, expect Him to bless you and show you His presence in a new way, expect to be challenged, expect to be changed in the presence of God... for who can't be refined in the Presence of God?!  Not me!  Every time I enter the presence of God I leave a changed person... sometimes greater changes happen than others but it's all about going from glory to glory.  Expect God tomorrow.

      Wooh, what a weekend!  Started off on Friday night with setup for Insomnia with a quick trip out to the Mattara pub for Stu and Rach's birthday dinner party.  Saturday was Insomnia (9-3) and then Brendans Bucks Night.  Insomnia was great (so I hear!).  There were hardly any people there until about 12/1pm so I was a bit bummed that I had to leave at 3.  Oh well.  Ducked back before the bucks night for an hour of BFV which was good.  Had tons of fun when I was there anyway.  See  urlLink Tlegion.com  for more info.  Sunday morning the whole Mowday tribe (including some from Beck's family in WA) rocked up to Oakvale Farm near Nelson Bay... MAN that's fun!  We scored some footage that we are seriously hoping will win us something ($10k please Lord!) on Funniest Home Video's.  Hopefully Rob is going to send it in soon :)  Then Sunday night was church which I really enjoyed.  Why wouldn't people want to be involved in a local church?  If it wasn't for what they call the Christian peripheral then I'm sure more people would see church as a more suitable option.  The Christian peripheral is what people 'think' about Christians that isn't necessarily true.  It's these notions and rumours that hinder our gospel spreading and also more people entering the kingdom of God.  I guess that's why the enemy helps these ideas spread.  It's part of our mission to repair people's ideas on God, Christianity, faith, truth and the real human condition.  Hope you are part of the solution too.  Rock on.

      How about a quick blog eh?  Life's going well (Happy Birthday Stu for today, Rach for yesterday, Philly (Josh told me to say that) for last wednesday)... apart from this crazy frog in my throat and the fact that my time seems to be simply slipping away this week!  If any YWAMer's are reading this, you might like to know that I'll be attending the first part of the DTS commissioning on Wednesday night.  Need to be somewhere at 7:30 so I'll only be there for about 45 minutes but better than nothing!!!  This Sunday I'm preaching a message called "Would you like 'Nothing' with that?".  Don't miss out this Sunday NIGHT at NewLife... yeah, don't forget that it's a night service... we forgot to mention that at NewLife on Sunday morning.  I heard Ashley preached an amazing message.  GO ASH!  I'm going to have to schedule some time this week to listen to it.  Did you use a microphone?  Hope so... that means we taped it :)  Cell group starts in 22 minutes and I have to pick up Dan and wrap Stu's pressie... You better like it man... LIIIKKKEEE IIITT!!!  Have fun!

      Hey again,  Blogger have included a few new fonts to their ever expanding menu of things to do with your blog but I can't seem to locate the previous one that I loved so much (see previous 2 posts).   I'll try not selecting any and see what that does!  WOW.... interesting start to THIS blog!  lol    Life's been good.  Been uber-busy which has been great!  Been fantastic to get back into it and be run off my feet again.... kinda missed it hehe.   Church fully rocked on Sunday.  Had a great response to the message on Revolution I brought and there was a great feel in the House.   The more I give to the local church the more I'm convinced of it's significance in bringing salvation to the world.    Beck is not well at the moment.  She's contracted an eye infection which has worsened with the special eye drops the pharmacist gave her.  She's going to contact her doctor first thing in the morning because she can't open her right eye because of the swelling.  Pray for her if you can, that'd be great.    Ethan is doing great.  He's moving around surprisingly well for not being able to crawl yet hehe.  He's a wiggler that's for sure.  He's now saying Nanananan as well as Dadadadada which is nice for my mum (Nana) but not so nice for Beck (Mumumum which he can't say yet).  All good.  It's so great to watch him develop and experiment with his voice and stuff.  So great.  Makes me wonder how God feels when we develop.... I'm sure He loves it.    Well that's all folks... I have to go and prepare Ethan's bottle for tomorrow morning and then hit the sack.  Have fun y'all and I'll post again in hopefully less than a week!  Later!

       Wow, it's been a while since my last.  The last 7 days have been pretty jam packed so forgive my lack of blogging.    Been on holidays for the last 2 weeks. Holidays ended Monday but it's all good. I really needed the holidays (hadn't had one since Nov 2002) and it was great to have holidays from both DALE and NewLife at the same time. Wow... what a treat! We were totally blessed with some money and a fuel card too so we could actually DO things during our holidays... HOW AWESOME IS GOD!?!?!     SO... we went out to breakfast (Beck totally loves going out for brekky) to this awesome place in Lambton called Chaddies... very nice and they do a MEAN big brekky. I also cooked a scrumptous meal for Beck on the Wednesday before I went to Dubbo for 3 days... that consisted of Margeurita Pizza with roasted capsicum and pancetta and then vanilla risotto with caramelised pears for dessert... MAN it was good. I'm sitting there eating my own cooking thinking... 'This may very well be the best meal I've ever eaten! LOL.... AND I COOKED IT! Stranger things have happened... that horse becoming Pope for example.    Interesting that in my last blog, I took the mickey out of those people who don't update their blogs... and it's been over a week since mine! Terribly sorry y'all.    Well Friday arvo I'm off to Sydney again for the Real Men conference put on my CCC Oxford Falls. Should be awesome... you know... rubbing shoulders with Mark and Bernie Kelsey again... well I assume Bernie wont be there lol.    Anyway... until next time, rock on, cya at church on Sunday and have a great one!  Laters!

      Wow... what a week.  I'm still on holidays but I thought a good ol' blog couldn't go astray.    Dubbo was great, although cold and I had tons of problems with my computer whilst up there.  In fact, we ended up reinstalling Windows 4 times and then once more today, I had to borrow someone else's hard drive to use because mine died using great ol' Partition Magic.  So I've lost plenty of programs and data and I've spent the last day trying to get it back to working condition.  Fortunately all my NewLife and sermon stuff was on my laptop, my contacts were saved on Plaxo online and my calendar and tasks were on my pda!  Thank God for technology!  So after plenty of time copying data back over, reinstalling stuff and the like, my computer was still running like a dog.  I remembered that my great, fandangled, super, almost new video card drivers weren't installed and went looking for them... another hiccup... no overseas web pages would work... ARGH!  I remembered that I had the drivers on a CD so I put them in and voila!  Smooth working computer :)  YAY!  Anyway, Ethan received his last injection today for a very expensive vaccination... he screamed like crazy, I hated it and then he's been upset all afternoon and waking up every half hr so far tonight... he's just gone down again and he seems ok.  The amazing thing was the that doctor didn't charge us for the injection or the consultation... around $200 worth.  THANKYOU GOD!!!!  I love that God is always looking after us and being faithful to us.  I love my life and even though it's hard sometimes God is always with me, He never forsakes me, never leaves me.  God rocks... check out  urlLink www.christianityworks.com  if you're intrigued.  Jesus is so totally the answer.  Rock on.

      Well, I'd blog, but I really don't have time... I'm off to Dubbo for a few days to LAN with the TLegion Dubbo guys... my last gaming LAN until... well who knows!  Been challenged by God to further reduce the gaming component of my life and so I thought this would be a suitable bang to go out on.  The whole express lane at your local supermarket... it's so... weird.  When you're next in line there's a whole uncomfortable stage between the person who's just left the checkout and you standing there waiting and wondering, "Shold I just go up?", "What should I do?", "Am I supposed to wait here until she yells 'NEXT!'?"... I love watching people in this situation... there are a myriad of different responses.... some quite hilarious.  Keep an eye out :)  Check out the  urlLink new links section  at Planetnewilfe.  Much time used to perfect this lovely new addition to NewLife's website..  Well I better go and see my son and wife some more before out trek to Dubbski!  Have fun all and I'll cya next week :)  Laters!

      Wow... what a weekend!  The weekend started by our calendar clearing almost completely!  Beck's eye infection prevented us from our Friday night dinner appt with Bren and Jen and then Nadine was sick so that cancelled our Saturday night one!  Beck was ok for our Sunday morning Ministry Team meeting so that was good.   She's going great now too if you're wondering :)  Sunday night's service at NewLife was amazing.  Jasmine, a friend of Jens (who actually asked to come to church with her) responded to the message (along with several others) and started her relationship with God.  It was amazing!  We praise God for the fruit we're seeing and are about to see.  Our new building isn't any closer yet... well it is... we've narrowed it down by another 3 hehe.  That was last week.  I'm yet to go searching this week but will do tomorrow afternoon for a while.  Beck's Saturday night consisted of going through the yellow pages searching relentlessly for possible buildings and she's made quite a list!  We've decided to slightly delay the 'Do Life Well' series... for about 3 weeks we think.  We'd love to start it in our new building so we can make maximum benefit of the growth potential.   We're really hoping to be in our building in the next 3-5 weeks in FAITH so that will be exciting.  Stay tuned for the latest news on this!  Life's great.... last night I did a major overhaul of  urlLink Planetnewlife.   That was cool and really fun.  For some stupid reason, I love updating PNL for fun.  Go figure. :)  Well I'm off to go to Music Team prac.  Have a great week and cya on Sunday church!  urlLink
