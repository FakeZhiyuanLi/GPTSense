       "A True Patriot"  Former Arizona Cardinal's football player, Pat Tillman, was killed just a few days ago during fighting in Afghanistan.  This man is truly a hero. Tillman turned down a 3.6 million dollar contract with the Cardinals to enlist in the army.  Serving his country as an elite ranger, Tillman made 18,000 dollars a year.  I think it would be safe to say that you could count the number of pro-athletes on one hand who care enough about anyone but themselves to turn away from a multi-million dollar contract to serve their country.

       "Communist Party Still Alive in Bedford County"  As I was researching for the exit polls (volunteers still desperately needed) I found that in Hyndman Borough, there is a registered member of the Communist Party as well as a member of the Socialist Party.  I still can't fully believe that there are people like that in Bedford County.  I thought all of them had moved to the cities, became hippies, or joined www.internationalANSWER.org (ANSWER, for those of you who don't know, is a group of hysterical anti-American commies that are responsible for nearly all the anti-war demonstrations around the country).  If anyone actually knows these people from Hyndman I would love to know who they are.  Maybe they didn't know what they were doing when the registered to vote.  Although, as a keep telling myself, they  are  from Hyndman and that explains a lot.

       "Wal-Mart"  Just a few interesting facts ...  1. Wal-Mart is now the worlds biggest corporation, banking 7 billion dollars a year in profits. 2. Of the 10 richest people in the world, 5 are Waltons 3. Wal-mart is the country's largest private employer with over one million employees (three times more than General Motors)  You would think it would be a nice place to work wouldn't you?  Ponder the following...  1. The average employee makes only $15000 a year for full-time work.  Most are even denied this measly income because they're limited to part-time only work. 2. The company brags that 70% of its workers are full-time, at Wal-Mart "full-time" is only 28 hours a week.  This means that "associates" gross less than $11000 a year. 3. Only 38% of Wal-Mart workers can afford coverage under the company's health plan. 4. Wal-Mart is rabidly anti-union.  When workers at a meet packing plant signed union cards at a Wal-Mart supercenter in Jacksonville Texas, Wal-Mart announced that it would be  closing the meat-cutting departments in  all  of its stores.    It gets worse...  Wal-Mart repeatedly breaks workers' compensation laws, child-labor laws (It has 1400 violations in Maine alone!), and surveillance of employee laws.    The turnover rate in stores is above 50 percent a year.  Many stores replace 100 percent of their employees each year.    Wal-Mart's purchasing headquarters is in China.  It is the largest importer of Chinese-made products in the world, buying $10 billion worth of merchandise a year.    Charlie Kernaghan of the National Labor Committee reports, "In country after country, factories that produce for Wal-Mart are the worst."  He adds that Wal-Mart is actually "lowering standards in China, slashing wages and benefits, imposing long mandatory-overtime shifts, while tolerating the arbitrary firing of workers who even dare to discuss factory conditions."  The people who make the products that Wal-Mart sells typically live in 7x7 shacks, work for 13 cents per hour, 7 days a week, with 20 hours shifts, in 100 degree temperatures.  Consider this the next time you hear "Always low prices, Always Wal-Mart."

       "Ketchup"  Sen. John Kerry continues to accuse President Bush of sending thousands of American jobs overseas.  Obviously this isn't true because Bush doesn't actually  own  any factories.  This can't be said of Sen. Kerry however.  You see, the senator is married to Teresa Heinz-Kerry.  There company, the Heinz Company, as sent quite a few jobs overseas.  50 to be exact.  32 in Europe and 18 in Asia and the Pacific.  Do you think that if elected, Kerry will ask his wife to move her companies back to America?  Of course not!  Why would the Kerry's give up the millions of dollars they make from the cheap labor?  Don't believe me that Kerry would be such a hypocrite?  Go look at the Heinz products in your fridge.  I bet that if you have a few, at least one of them will be made somewhere outside the US.  Just one more reason not to turn America over to the liberals.

       "Wade"  If you're reading this you probably already know that today is Wade's funeral.  First of all, I'd like to express my deepest sympathy for the families of the victims.  What bothers me about all of this though, is the drama acted out by those who didn't even know him.  Just yesterday I listened to a group of girls argue with another girl because she suggested that it was Wade's fault.  The accident report showed that it was in fact Wade's fault.  He was driving well over the speed limit on wet roads, tried to pass the car in front of him and collided head on with an oncoming car.  It's tragic that someone so young had to die that way but it doesn't excuse the fact that it was his fault that 3 people are now dead.  Another thing that bugs me is the seemingly endless list of those missing school to attend his funeral.  A funeral is supposed to be for family and only very close friends.  The school shouldn't be taking a bus full of junior high kids to such a personal event.  Am I being insensitive? I don't think so. All I'm saying is that the list of those attending should have only been less than 1/4 of one page instead of a whole page front and back.  Most of those on the list didn't even speak to him while he was still with us.  I'm sorry he died, I'm sorry that his family and friends have to go through this hard time, but it ticks me off that ignorant people would take advantage of this situation just to get out of school for a day.  It's insensitive of them and it's rude to his family and to his real friends.   R.I.P. Wade

       "Moore Liberal Propaganda"  Michael Moore, the creator of "Bowling for Columbine" and "Dude, Where's my Country?" has a new film out entitled "Fahrenheit 9/11."  This new film is basically 2 hours of Bush bashing, just as "Bowling for Columbine" is 2 hours of American-bashing.  Moore claims that the new documentary proves the Bush administration knew about the 9/11 attacks before they happened and that Bush has only increased terrorism w/ the liberation of Iraq.    The film won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival this past week.  Amazing!.  An Anti-Bush film winning the top prize at a film festival held in France.  How can it be?!?!    Fahrenheit 9/11 hasn't been released in the United States yet.  Disney has used its veto power of Mirimax films to stop distribution of the film.  Moore will surely find a liberal film company to release the film.  It wouldn't surprise me if it hit theaters in September.  Right before the general election.    Moore is now claiming that he has come into possession of 20 minutes of new footage from the Nick Berg beheading video.  Maybe someone could make a film about how Moore knew that Berg was going to be beheaded?

       "The moral decay of the class of 2005"  I wasn't going to put anything about class elections in here but I feel the need to speak my peace.    First of all, our class must not have know what Chaplin meant when they voted for it.  It was down to 2 choices, 1. the preachers daughter (literally) or 2. the porn star (not much of a star, but in a porn film none the less).  Since the Chaplin is the religious leader of our class, wouldn't the obvious choice be the preachers daughter?, the girl who's nice to anyone she talks to.  Apparently not for our class.  We elected a girl who made a movie of herself and ex-boyfriend having sex, a girl who can't make it through a day w/ out insulting someone to their face.  And then we have her hypocrisy.  She preaches to me about how I shouldn't talk about people behind their back.  Maybe she should practice what she preaches.  It's not setting a very good "moral" example when the "religious leader" of our class, sits in first period and talks about people who aren't in the room.  If you have something to say to me say it to my face.  I have no problem posting my opinion for all to see.  I don't keep what I think away from you.  If you've got a problem w/ me, take it up w/ me, not everyone in first period.  And this gets even better...  Apparently our class Chaplin was "led by God" to run for the office.  I ask, did God lead her to turn on the video camera as well?  Let me say that I would have voted for this girl for any office she ran for except Chaplin.  She will make a great class officer because she can handle the work.  Chaplin is another story though.  It should not be such a morally disillusioned person, it should be a person of good moral character, a person that hasn't exploited herself on video tape.  If I've offended anyone else in the past few days w/ comments about this, I sincerely apologize.  It was not my intention to group all the officers for next year in w/ the Chaplin.  If you do choose to group yourself w/ this person still, maybe you should really think about it, read the main part of this post again, and if you still feel that the right person was elected, well, then you must be a democrat.

       "Welfare Whores and Ice Cream"  You know what really ticks me off?  No, not John Kerry's comment about Bush needing training wheels to ride a bike.  No, not how Sivits got off easy w/ his prison sentence (more on this later).  What really bugs the heck out of me are stupid welfare whores that come to the igloo 2 freakin minutes before we close and order a crap load of ice cream.  It wouldn't be too bad if it were a cone or something, but no, they have to order flurrys and sundays and banana splits.  It's bad enough that I have to give up part of my paycheck to fund the program they live off of.  They don't have to rub it in by making my job that much harder.  Now don't get the wrong idea here.  I like my job.  I don't mind serving ice cream to people.  Just have enough respect to not order 20 freakin things 2 minutes before we close.  (Note...the igloo closes at  10:00  PM)

       "YES IM A BAD AMERICAN by George Carlin"    I am your worst nightmare, I am a BAD American. I am George Carlin. I believe the money I make belongs to me and my family, not some mid level governmental functionary be it democrat or republican.   I'm in touch with my feelings and I like it that way d*** it!   I think owning a gun doesn't make you a killer, it makes you a smart American.   I think being a minority does not make you noble or victimized and does not entitle you to anything.   I believe that if you are selling me a big mac, try to do it in english.   I think fireworks should be legal on the 4th of July.   I think that being a student doesn't give you any more enlightenment than working at blockbuster,in fact, if your parents are footing the bill to put your pansy a** through 4 years plus of college, you havent begun to be enlightened.   I believe everyone has a right to pray to his or her God when and where they want to   My heroes are John Wayne, Babe Ruth, Roy Rogers, and whoever cancelled Jerry Springer.   I dont hate the rich. I dont pity the poor.   I know wrestling is fake and I don't waste my time arguing about it.   I think global warning is a big lie. Where are all those experts now, when I'm freezing my a** off during these long winters and paying and paying and paying?   I've never owned a slave or was a slave, I didnt wander forty years in the desert after getting chased out of Egypt. I haven't burned any witches or been persecuted by the Turks and neither have you! So shut the h*** up already!   I want to know which church is it exactly where the Reverend Jesse Jackson practices, where he gets his money, and why he is always part of the problem and no the solution. Can I get an AMEN on that one?   I think the cops have every right to shoot your sorry a** if you're running from them. I also think they have the right to pull your a** over if your breaking the law, regardless of what color you are.   I think if you are too stupid to know how a ballot works, I don't want you deciding who should be running the most powerful nation in the world for the next four years.   I dislike those people standing in the intersections trying to sell me crap or trying to guilt me into making "donations" to their cause. These people should be targets.   I believe that it take a village to raise a child, it takes two (heterosexual) parents .  I believe if she has her lips on your willie, its sex, and this applies even if you are the president of the United States (*cough* *cough* *Clinton* *cough* *cough*).   And what the h*** is going on with gas prices....again?   If this makes me a BAD American, then yes, im a BAD American    If you're a bad American too IM me w/ an AMEN.

       "Response to 'U.N. American'"    Unnamed Liberal: alright now...i know we don't agree on politics and that's fine...but that shit about the UN not going into Rwanda was a direct result of what happened in Somalia   Ok...I'm not quite sure why it's ok to try to help the people of one African nation (Somalia) while letting the other (Rwanda) become a living hell.    Unnamed Liberal: the US went into Somalia thinking they could save the world, only it backfired when they went in with out notifying the UN and had to get the UN peacekeepers to save our ass   Clinton did one of the few good things in his presidency when he went into Somalia.  Personally I think we got a bit too involved but someone had to help those thousands who were starving to death each day.  We got into a mess when a black hawk helicopter was shot down by Somalia militia (watch "Black Hawk Down" for the story).  We needed the UN peacekeepers to help us.  I didn't say they were  all  bad.  Just most of the time.    Unnamed Liberal: and the key word is genocide Unnamed Liberal: they called the whole thing in Somalia genocide but not Rwanda for a reason Unnamed Liberal: no one would send troops to Rwanda even if they did call it genocide   Again, what makes Somalia in any greater need than Rwanda?  Both had hundreds of thousands of innocent people starving and being shot daily.  How does the UN distinguish between two nations misery?    Unnamed Liberal: and before you start critzing the UN...u should learn how it works   I'd love to hear this sometime...    Unnamed Liberal: its sad that all you republicans think that the US can rule the world   Wouldn't it be great if the GOP did rule the world?

        urlLink "U.N. American"    A lot of people still think that we should have gone to the UN for approval before liberating Iraq.  These people either don't know (bad), or don't care (worse), what the UN really is.   Take for example, the UN Council on Human Rights.  This council is responsible for safeguarding the simple inalienable rights of every member UN nation.  You would think that the United States should at least be  on  this council if not leading it, wouldn't you?  What nation's citizens have more freedoms than those of the United States?  The truth is, the US was voted  off  the council, which is now headed by the delegates from Libya.  Libya is as far from being a "free" country as Al Sharpton is from being President of the United States.  Quadafi, the leader (dictator) of Libya, has had his country bombed and put under economic sanctions during the Reagan administration for harboring terrorists and seeking WMDs.  Is this really the best choice of country to be on, more or less  lead , the Council on Human Rights?   Take Rwanda for another example.  Hundreds of thousands of Rwandans were murdered during a bloody, uncontrolable, civil war in the early 90s.  What did the UN (which is responsible for peace in Rwanda) do about this atrocity?   Absolutely nothing.   The blue helmeted UN peacekeepers stood and watched, weapons in hand, while this genocide took place.   Think about this the next time you hear John Kerry talk about how "important" the UN is.

       "One Sick Man"  The man who drew  urlLink (this)  should be taken outside, beaten, tarred and feathered, then beaten some more.  After all that's done, I'm all for sending him on a one way flight to Baghdad or Kabul.  He can get an eyewitness perspective of the War on Terror for his next cartoon.   It's one thing to disagree with the War on Terror.  It's a totally different ballgame when you sink to the new low (even for liberals) of exploiting and mocking the sacrifice's of brave men, like Tillman, simply to score political points in an election year.  Politics in this country need to stop at the waters edge.  Our national security and is far too important to be left up to partisan mudslinging.

       "mmmm...Burgers"  The problem with America today is that people don't take responsibility for their actions anymore.  Take the lady who sued McDonald's for example.  This woman ate McDonald's food all her life then blames the restaurant for making her fat.  NEWS FLASH: It's her own fault for shoveling all that sludge into her pie hole.  Someone made a documentary not too long about in which they ate at McDonald's 3 times a day for 3 weeks and gained 25 pounds.  This person really needs a get a life (and go on a diet).  Just recently however, a woman wrote a book about how she also ate at McDonald's 3 times a day for 3 weeks and  lost  10 pounds.  The difference between these two individuals is that while the man ate double quarter pounders with cheeseevery day, the woman ate salads.  (If you haven't had the California Cob salad you should really try it)  This lack of responsibility extends into other areas of life as well.  Example: Girl has sex, gets pregnant, has an abortion.  It's not her fault she had sex.  The abortion is just an easy way for her to escape taking responsibility for her actions.  Its sad and scary the way this country is gone.  At this rate, in 50 years we'll be a nation of fat people and trial lawyers, suing every company into bankruptcy.

       "I'm a hypocrite?"   Anonymous: you're a hypocrit Anonymous: hollister is a multi million dollar company Anonymous: so even though your shirt may cost 30 bucks, you may as well just buy a nissan, b/c theres no difference  Hmm...Nissan/ T-shirt...$30,000/ $30?  Not seeing a big similarity here.  Hollister makes $25ish from one shirt that I buy.  Nissan on the other hand makes at least $2500 on each of their cars.  My buying of a couple shirts doesn't add up to even one car being sold.  I don't know about you, but I think a car is a much bigger investment than a T-shirt.      Anonymous: most gas stations dont have u.s. gas, so walk if you dont like it  This is true.  Few gas stations actually do us domestic petroleum.  The entire point of my previous post was to inform my readers about where oil companies get their gas and what countries the company itself is based in.    One of the biggest reasons oil companies don't use American oil is because we don't have enough refineries to process it domestically.  Why don't we just build more refineries you ask?  Simple, the Democrats and liberals in congress won't allow it.      Anonymous: and chevrolets aren't made in the usa Anonymous: like you want to think Anonymous: parts come from all over the world  This is partially true and very misleading.  It is true in the sense that there are no 100% American made cars.  All Ford motor company cars are assembled in America and nearly all are made from over 80% American parts.  Not perfect but a heck of a lot better than Nissan and Hyundai.  To directly refute Anonymous' point, the GM owned Chevrolet company, builds the Astro Van, S10 pickup, and Silverado (just to name a few) in the US from over 90% American made parts.    Generally, if you want an American made car, buy a Ford or a GM product like Chevy, Oldsmobile, or Saturn.

       "Buy American"  Something that really bugs me is how people can bitch and moan about our country loosing jobs and how the economy sucks, then turn around and drive off in their Nissan filled with gas from 7-11.  Where do you think that Nissan was made?  Ohio?  How about the gas from 7-11?  Chances are that it’s from Citgo, a Venezuelan company.  How can this person stand to be such a hypocrite?  Now, I realize that it would be nearly impossible to buy  all  American made products.  The clothes I wear from AE and Hollister are made mostly in Mexico, Egypt, Pakistan, and Vietnam.  It would be nice though, if all Americans would stop and think about where some of the more major products they buy come from.   Think how much money is lost to our economy every time someone fills up at a 7-11.  Or how many American workers lose their jobs every time someone buys a Nissan or Hyundai.     Contrary to popular belief...Honda Civics are not made in China or Japan, they are  all  made in Marysville, Ohio.   urlLink  Please check out this page for a list of American and foreign owned companies...     urlLink  THIS LIST IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT...WHERE THE GASOLINE AMERICAN COMPANIES BUY ACTUALLY COMES FROM

       "Not so fast"  Before all you drugies out there start adoring me(doubtful that many are actually reading this), and before my conservative friends start thinking I've turned hippie (I think you'll agree more with this post), you all need to hear what goes along with my pot legalization idea.  Marijuana, like any intoxicating drug, including alcohol, should never be used when it could potentially cause harm to others.  The greatest danger that would, and does, face the public from pot heads and drunks, is when these people sit behind the wheel.  For a more personal story on how intoxicated drivers are dangerous in the driver's seat, ask a friend of mine (most of you already know who this is) who was hit by a drunk driver coming home from work this summer.       There is simply no excuse for driving while intoxicated.  Anyone caught driving under the influence of any drug, including alcohol, should loose there driving license for ten years and sit in jail for one of those years, all for his or her first offence.  If an innocent person dies as a result of another drivers blatant disregard for the law, I say hang ‘em at sundown.  (More about public hangings for criminals in a later post)    A lot of you are going to say this draconian resembling punishment is simply too harsh for America.  I don’t think so at all.  Tougher penalties for crimes would solve a lot of problems in our country.  Deaths caused by intoxicated drivers are as preventable as the spread of AIDS.  There is purely no reason for drunks and stoners to be behind the wheel.    With great freedom comes equally great responsibility, keep that in mind.

       "Pot Heads Rejoice"  I'm a strong supporter of limited government.  Fewer laws and smaller government lead to a freer society.  As long as what a person does causes no harm to another, the government shouldn't get involved.  This is why I'm for the legalization of marijuana.  Right about now you're probably thinking I've either lost my mind or that I'm on the herb myself.  Either way, you're wrong.  Just think objectively about it for a minute.  Add the amount of money the government would save each year if police didn't have to combat the use of weed and the amount of money that could be raised by imposing federal taxes on the drug.  Quite a bit of money, isn't it?  Now, the use of marijuana, or any drug for that matter, goes against my personal feelings and against my religious faith.  The governments job is not to protect you from yourself.  Its your own fault if you destroy your life with alcohol or drugs. Besides, if the pot head down the street is paying taxes on his weed, maybe Uncle Sam won't have to take so much out of my paycheck each week.   Check out  urlLink this page.   It debunks most of the common myths about the use of marijuana.  Definately worth a look.

       "Reporting for Duty"  Hopefully you didn’t waste your time watching John Kerry’s acceptance speech like I did tonight.  The Democrats have done an extream-makeover on John Kerry that would make even TLC proud.  But, no superficial makeover can cover up Kerry’s 20 year Senate voting record or his years of documented public remarks.  In his acceptance speech tonight, Kerry asks us to "…judge me by my record."  Lets do just that.    "I will be a commander in chief who will never mislead us into war."   That was an excerpt from Kerry’s acceptance speech tonight.  Now read the following excerpt from the congressional record in October of 2002.   "It would be naive to the point of grave danger not to believe that, left to his own devices, Saddam Hussein will provoke, misjudge, or stumble into a future, more dangerous confrontation with the civilized world. … He has supported and harbored terrorist groups, particularly radical Palestinian groups such as Abu Nidal, and he has given money to families of suicide murderers in Israel. … We should not go to war because these things are in his past, but we should be prepared to go to war because of what they tell us about the future."  "The threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real, but as I said, it is not new. It has been with us since the end of that war, and particularly in the last 4 years we know after Operation Desert Fox failed to force him to reaccept them, that he has continued to build those weapons. He has had a free hand for 4 years to reconstitute these weapons, allowing the world, during the interval, to lose the focus we had on weapons of mass destruction and the issue of proliferation."   After making the case against Iraq, Senator Kerry voted to give the president the power to use force to disarm Iraq. Quite a change in policy for Senator Kerry isn’t it?    Let’s take another quote from Kerry’s speech tonight.     "Saying there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq doesn't make it so."   Ok.  I agree.  Then why did Senator Kerry help to convince congress and the UN that there were weapons?   "The Iraqi regime's record over the decade leaves little doubt that Saddam Hussein wants to retain his arsenal of weapons of mass destruction and to expand it to include nuclear weapons. We cannot allow him to prevail in that quest."    "Regime change has been an American policy under the Clinton administration, and it is the current policy. I support the policy. But regime change in and of itself is not sufficient justification for going to war--particularly unilaterally--unless regime change is the only way to disarm Iraq of the weapons of mass destruction pursuant to the United Nations resolution."   Both of these statements made by John Kerry on the Senate floor in October of 2002.    John Kerry? Attempting to "mislead" us into war? How could he be so hypocritical?    Let’s try one more quote from tonight’s speech.     "Saying we can fight a war on the cheap doesn't make it so."   I don’t recall the Bush administration trying to avoid providing proper funding for the war.  Perhaps it was Senator Kerry who has tried to under-fund our troops.      "I actually did vote for his $87 billion, before I voted against it."   Yes.  Sadly it’s true.  Senator Kerry did vote against the 87 billion dollars to fund our troops in combat.  And yes, at the same time, he tries to accuse President Bush of "fighting a war on the cheep."     Had enough two faced lies for one day?  If not, check out the  urlLink GOP website .

       "A Strong Leader"  As I write this, the Democrats are trying to portray John Kerry as a moderate, at the convention in Boston.  I think  urlLink Sean Hannity  puts it perfectly when he calls the Democratic Convention the "Re-invention Convention."  That’s exactly what Kerry constantly does.  He re-invents himself into whatever type of person the polls favor.  Is this the really kind of person you want as President?  A person without his own principles.  A person who says "life begins at conception" yet supports abortion?  A person who votes to go to war with Iraq yet refuses vote to give the troops the body armor and supplies they need to fight?  Thank God we have another option...  Our country has been blessed with a great leader.  A leader, who seeks guidance from God each day.  A leader, who makes a decision and sees it through till the end. A leader, who won’t put our national security in the corrupted hands of the United Nations.  A leader, whose principles don’t change direction with the winds of public opinion.  And a leader, who, with your help, will be re-elected on November 2nd for another 4-years of strong, faithful leadership.

       "What does America think of John Kerry?"  According to a recent  urlLink ABC News  poll, most American’s don’t very nice things to say about the Jr. Senator from Massachusetts.  Only 36% of the population believes Kerry is a “strong leader,” while 55% of Americans have confidence in George Bush’s leadership.    Kerry isn’t racking up points on the issue of national defense either.  Merely 38% of Americans think John Kerry will make our country safer.  54% however, believe Bush is doing what it takes to make America safe.    Even after watching Michael Moore’s sorry excuse for a “documentary.” The general population still trusts Bush over Kerry.  46% of Americans describe the president as an honest man, while only 40% have the same to say of Senator Kerry.    While we’re on the issue of honesty and trust, the same ABC News poll shows that 55% of Americans trust President Bush on the issue of terrorism.  Only 37% would rather have Kerry dealing with terrorists.    Speaking of war, 52% of Americans trust the president to handle the situation in Iraq.  Only 40% of America would trust Senator Kerry with the same responsibility.    Through all the prisoner abuse scandals, the leftist propaganda, the less than awe-inspiring 9/11 Commission report, and the endless drone of the liberal media, President Bush still maintains a razor thin (but now growing) lead over Senator Kerry in the popular vote.  In the electoral vote however, (the number that really matters) Bush is leading Kerry by a small margin.  Even if Kerry can manage to win every state won by Gore in 2000, he still has to pick up several states from Bush’s side.    Maybe if John “Flip-Flop” Kerry would articulate his vision for America, the polls would show him some mercy.  Is he going to do this?  Not likely.

       Duct Tape and Gum Bands has been receiving quite a few comments lately.  I feel that for the benefit of you, the reader, this liberal spin should be cleared up.  I strongly encourage you to read the original posts in their entirety before reading this post.       Comments and response from "Liberal Garbage"     What exactly did Moore expect Bush to do?  As soon as Dick Cheney heard about the attacks, he called for the planes to be shot down. That's how a responsible executive reacts. Unfortunately, by the time his words were conveyed, the attacks had already gone through.  I believe that Vice President Cheney did exactly the right thing.  He was the one who was first briefed on what was happening, (to the best of our knowledge) so he was in a better position to make the call.  You liberals would be ranting just as loud if Bush would have rushed out of a room full of frightened children to give an order to start shooting down anything that had wings and engines.      Jump up, run out of the school, pick up a gun, and start shooting Muslims?  Maybe. You'll have to ask Mr. Moore.  Moore spends a lot of time criticizing Bush's actions yet never suggests what he feels should have been done by the president.      The simple fact is that the Bush's used to be in the Oil Business.  The Bushes are still in the oil business.  George H.W. Bush is still in the oil business.  He no longer has a duty to perform above that of an average American civilian.  I'm not really sure what point you're trying to make here.    Unfortunately, war is sometimes necessary.  I think Mr. Moore's assertion was that the war wasn't necessary. Rather than "demonizing" the U.S. soldiers, as you suggested, I think Michael Moore tried portraying war as damaging to soldiers, their families, and to civilians involved.  Did you not watch this "documentary?"  Moore portrays the our brave fighting men and women as heartless bastards who jump at the chance to slaughter innocent civilians.       Comments and response from "You don't support John Kerry...Why should your Ketchup?"     John Kerry is married to Teresa Heinz, owner of the Heinz Foundation, a philantrhopic organization which gives back to environmental and other causes. She owns relatively little stock of Heinz Corp., and she does not sit on the board of directors. Actually, the Heinz family (that is, those that were related to Senator John Heinz, of Pennsylvania before his tragic plane crash) are mostly Republicans. John Heinz himself actually was.  Well isn't Teresa just an angel?  Maybe the pope should declare her a saint along with Mother Teresa.    I'm not really trying to bash the Heinz company.  I'm simply pointing out that there is an alternative.  As I said before, a purchase of "W Ketchup" benefits the Freedom Alliance Scholarship fund.  This wonderful scholarship helps children whose parents are serving our great nation on active duty in the armed forces.    It is interesting to point out that until Teresa married Sen. Kerry, she was, herself, a republican.  (Talk about taking a step down in the world)  She was a major supporter of Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Spector.  I'm surprised a Joe Hoeffel supporter like you, Devin, would stand up for Teresa.       Comments and response from "Trouser Treason"     Do you read Newsmax? Read about Joseph Goebbels? Because you seem fond of spreading propaganda.  Don't lecture me about propaganda.  Moore's movie, which you so promptly came to the defense of, is nothing but a piece of liberal propaganda.  But I guess liberal propaganda is ok.      Bill Clinton said it's something to "laugh about" because Berger's messy desk while an official was obviously an inside joke among people in the White House. And to correct you, he "stuffed" documents into his "pants" pocket, and one lone witness told of the sock comment. I don't recall the witness being named; how credible is an unnamed source?   What does Berger's "messy desk" (I don't think it's in our best interest to have classified information pertaining to national security sloppily spread around the NSA's desk.  Do you?)  have to do with him "stuffing" classified documents in his pants, shirt, socks, shoes, or ass for that matter?  I don't care how he took the documents.  You liberals try to blind people with pointless details.  The simple fact is, Berger took documents he knew he was not supposed to take.      John Kerry, as a senator, has authority to read classified documents. Why would he need Sandy Berger to do this? With as many "leaks" (none of which have been identified and brought to justice) coming out of the White House at odd times, you would think this was a Republican tactic (i.e. Amb. Joe Wilson's wife).  The Republicans accused Bill Clinton of striking Al Qaeda after the USS Cole ... to distract the public from the Monica Lewinsky scandal. That's quite the excuse. Both parties make suggestions like these.  A federal investigation has been pending for several months. It's a huge newsmaker.   Were you part of the team that "wagged the dog" for Clinton, because you're pretty good yourself at trying to distract people's attention from the topic? Kerry can't use classified information he obtains himself in attacks against the president.  If one of his "advisors" told him something that was later found out to be classified, Kerry can push the blame on his advisor.   Joe Wilson will get his own post here at Duct Tape and Gum Bands in the near future.  For now I'll say that Wilson's wife, a desk jockey at Langley, isn't a "covert" agent.  Her life wasn't threatened or her sources (if any) compromised by Novak's column.  It's also worth pointing out that all of Wilson's remarks about Uranium have been proven false, thus making the ambasador look like an incompetant moron to the whole world.  Amazing that the liberal media has barely whispered about THAT part of the story.    Bill Clinton bombed some abandoned tents in the deserts after the USS Cole.  Hardly a stong message to send to islamic extreamists.  Kill our soldiers and we'll launch a missile at a tent!  I'm sure Clinton's "response" had Bin Laden and company shaking in their turbans.

       "Trouser Treason"  Why did Former National Security Advisor Sandy Berger stuff classified documents from the 9/11 Commission hearings in his socks and pants to smuggle them out of the National Archives?  Is it that he had a fetish with papers as the democrats are trying to say.  Is this really something that we should all "laugh about" as Bill Clinton suggests?  Or was it just "sloppy" handling of papers on Berger’s part?    Seriously people, I’m not making this stuff up.  These are the actual reasons and excuses  the Democratic Party is presenting to the public for Sandy Berger’s "sloppy mistake."  And if these lame excuses aren’t enough; The Democrats are also accusing the GOP of leaking the information about Berger to the press, in an attempt to overshadow the final report of the 9/11 Commission.    This is what real liberals do.  When in trouble themselves, they go on the offensive, attacking Republicans for something the GOP had nothing to do with.    It’s also interesting to mention that Berger was an advisor to the Kerry campaign.  He has since stepped down. (Smart move Sandy)  It’s not so far fetched to think that a Kerry advisor with a paper fetish, would be sent to steal classified information that could be used in attacks against the Bush campaign, is it now?    I guess having "extra" things in one's pants is common in the Clinton administration.  Bubba couldn't keep Monica out of his pants.  Now we come to find that Sandy Berger likes to be "close to papers," as one Democratic spokesman puts it.    A federal investigation of Sandy Berger is pending.  More on this developing story to come...  Thanks to Lacy for the catchy title.

       "Liberal Garbage" &nbsp; I finally went to see Fahrenheit 9/11 today. &nbsp;Now I can justly criticize that piece of liberal trash (the movie, not the white trash that wrote, directed, produced, and stared in it).&nbsp; That was seriously the most wasted two hours I’ve ever spent in a theater.&nbsp; I’m glad I went for the matinee price rather than usual 8 bucks.  &nbsp;  A post long enough to debunk all the stupidity in that film would take days to write so I’ll just hit on the most ridiculous points that Moore tries to make.&nbsp; The “Stupid White Man” starts out by attacking the president for not taking immediate action when he first heard of the attacks on that Tuesday morning.&nbsp; For 7 minutes after hearing that the country had been victim to a terrorist attack, President Bush sat in an elementary school classroom in Florida reading with students.&nbsp; What exactly did Moore expect Bush to do?&nbsp; Jump up, run out of the school, pick up a gun, and start shooting Muslims?&nbsp; Nobody really knew what was going on in the first few hours after the attack.&nbsp; There wasn’t anything that Bush could have done even if he had been at the white house.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Another of the bizarre ideas Moore throws out is that the Bush family is in the pocket of the Saudi’s and the Bin Ladens.&nbsp; The simple fact is that the Bush’s used to be in the Oil Business.&nbsp; What is the largest oil producing country?&nbsp; Saudi Arabia.&nbsp; Now how could it be that the Bush’s knew the Saudi Royal family and the second richest family in the kingdom, the Bin Ladens?&nbsp; Is it not plain to see that there would be some sort of business connection between big shots in the oil industry?&nbsp; And really, so what if the Bush’s do know the Bin Ladens?&nbsp; Just because Usama Bin Laden is a terrorist from Saudi Arabia, doesn’t make his family or any other Saudi automatically guilty of terrorism.&nbsp; Timothy McVeah was an American terrorist from Flint, Michigan (ironically the same town where Michael Moore is from).&nbsp; Does this make the McVeah family guilty of bombing the Oklahoma City federal building?&nbsp; Of course not.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Moore goes on to demonize US soldiers, making it point to show the carnage after US bombing raids in Baghdad.&nbsp; War is a terrible thing.&nbsp; I don’t think any sane human being disagrees with that.&nbsp; Unfortunately, war is sometimes necessary.&nbsp; It’s either war against terrorists on their turf, or endless suicide attacks on our homeland.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I strongly discourage anyone from going to see this “documentary.”&nbsp; It’s really nothing but 2 hours of propaganda.&nbsp; If you could shorten it to 30 seconds it would make a great ad for the Kerry Campaign.&nbsp;

       "'Big Loser' Alright"  You won't be seeing any Slim Fast commercials featuring "Big Loser" Whoopi Goldberg anymore.  Slim Fast decided to stop airing the TV ads after Whoopi made inappropriate comments, relating the president's last name to women's pubic hair, at a Kerry fundraising event in NYC.    Finally a celebrity has to feel the bite from all the barking they do about the president.  What is it anyway, that makes famous people think that run of the mill people care about their political opinions?  Multi-millionaires like Goldberg don't have the same self-interests as average Americans.  When was the last time a major actor like Martin Sheen worried about his job being sent to India?  When was the last time Madonna worried about whether or not she would have enough money to make it till her next paycheck?  Seriously, where do celebrities get the illusion that average people care what they think?  To echo the words of Laura Ingraham, " urlLink Shut Up and Sing! "

        urlLink Nader for President!   Every liberal knows that the biggest reason Bush won in 2000 (other than being the best man for the job) was Green Party candidate Ralph Nader.  It's almost a fact that Gore would have won had the pessimistic trial lawyer (no...not John Edwards) not ran.    The 2004 election could end with the Dems in the same sinking ship as 2000.  Nader is back and this time over 5% of his campaign funds are coming from Republican donors.  Yes, you heard it right; Republicans are donating a lot of money to hard-core left winger Ralph Nader.  Is this because they’re sick of Bush?  Not likely.  If they were truly sick of Bush, why not just give that money to the most liberal democratic ticket of all time, a ticket that includes another trial lawyer, and one that is actually elect able?

       “The case for War: Part 2”  To date, over 1000 American lives have been lost in the Global War on Terror.  Was it worth it?  What price are we willing to pay to protect our homeland?  What will it take to win the war?  Only the incredibly insane liberals out there (the ones like  urlLink Ted Rall  and  urlLink Michael "Stupid White Man" Moore )still think the Battle of Afghanistan was a mistake.  They refuse to see that as a result of the war, Al Quida has been severely disrupted, the people of Afghanistan have been liberated from the oppressive Taliban regime, and our homeland is one battle closer to security from terror.    The next battle in this global war is currently being fought in Iraq.  The insane leftists who opposed eliminating Al Quida leaders in Afghanistan, have been joined by more the moderate liberals, in denouncing the continuing fight to guarantee the safety and securityof our nation.  Seriously, what do these people think the insurgents in Iraq would be doing if they weren’t fighting our military men and women?   (Well they’d be at home, beating…, I mean “taking care" of their wives and children of course.  If you actually believe that, I've got an ocean front property in Kansas for sale.)  Those same terrorists, who are dieing by the hundreds each week, would be planning more attacks against our homeland.  Attacks even more horrible than 9/11.   As much as liberals and isolationists would like to believe it, it would be impossible to completely secure the borders of the United States.  At least 500,000,000 people pass through our nation each year.  Millions of crates are shipped into our ports annually and only 6% (at most) can be inspected, without bankrupting the government.   The only way to protect ourselves from terrorists, is to take the fight to them.    Because of our actions in Iraq, positive change can be seen around the world.  Protesters in Iran are demanding freedom and democracy more than they ever have before.  Libya has given up its WMD program for fear that they may be next.  Even North Korea has allowed IAEA agents in to inspect their nuclear program.  How can any logical person say that the Global War on Terror hasn’t been a huge success so far?

       "The case for War: Part 1"  The loudest liberal chant these days seems to be “Show us the WMDs?”  while “No Blood for Oil” comes in a noisy second.  All liberal protest cries aside, Where are the WMDs?  The way I see it, there are three possibilities.    1. Iraq really did destroy them.   The problem with this is that they’ve never been able to show proof that the weapons have been destroyed.  Did they pull an Enron and destroy the records along with the weapons?  Not likely.    2. Saddam ordered the weapons to be moved out of the country before the war started.   While we wasted our time trying to convince the world that Saddam was an evil tyrant who, for the sake of the Iraqi people and the world as a whole, deserved to be removed from power, Iraq could have moved its weapons into Syria or Iran.    3. The weapons were sold to terrorists.   This is really the worst case scenario.  It’s public knowledge that Saddam promises 25,000 dollars (US) to the families of Hamas suicide bombers.  Since Hamas is a terrorist organization, and Saddam gives them money, is it not obvious that Saddam supports terrorism?    It’s blatantly obvious that Saddam was an evil man.  He used chemical weapons on his own people and against Iranians.  His torture chambers and rape rooms were always occupied by political dissidents.   He invaded another sovereign country (Kuwait) and planned on the invasion of another (Saudi Arabia).  He has violated nearly all of the restrictions placed on him by UN resolutions and the Cease Fire agreement with the US.  Being in violation of international law and countless UN resolutions, the US would have been in dereliction of duty as a member of the international community had we NOT removed this despot from power.  Even with all these perfectly good reasons to end Saddam’s evil rule, liberals continue to accuse the Bush Administration of starting a war for oil.    The simple fact is, we wouldn’t have needed to go to war to get Iraq’s oil.  All we needed to do was ask the UN for it.  Heck, France and Germany have been getting it for years by going behind the back of the UN sanctions.  Why shed the blood of  900 Americans for something that could have been obtained diplomatically?   The debate over the war really comes down to this.   Is the United States safer now that  Saddam Hussein’s evil regime is being replaced with democracy in Iraq?   I think the answer is a resounding  yes .      More on this topic to come…

       "A winning Gamble"  Well…I have some disapointing news for the some of my readers.  Schools around the state will be starting on time as scheduled. The Legislator passed the budget passed yesterday, only four days late.  Although there is an increase in spending in the new budget, there is thankfully no increase in state income taxes.   The Governor got his slot machines yesterday as well, making Pennsylvania the 18th state to legalize such gambling.  The new slots promise to bring in close to one billion dollars in revenue.  Revenue earmarked to give property tax relief to Pennsylvania land owners.  Experts estimate that in several years, Pennsylvania will have the second highest number of slot machines in the nation, second only to Nevada.  The new slots will be located in the state’s horseracing tracks for now, with the potential to expand into other venues in the future.      In the end it looks like Rendell’s tactic worked out well for both sides.  He got his slot machine bill signed into law and the Republicans got the budget passed without having to shut down the state government.  All in all a pretty good deal.

       “Gambling with Education”  Everett students will already be starting school late this year because of an asbestos problem at the high school, and if the state budget doesn’t get passed before September rolls around, the rest of the students in the state will be getting off to a late start as well.  Yesterday, Governor Rendell vetoed a bill, which would have provided the necessary funding for schools, citing that it was “unconstitutional” to remove school funding from the general budget process.    It seems to me that the governor is trying to blackmail the state Republicans into giving him his slot machines.  The GOP ought to give into the Governor on this.  The slots would be good for our state, bringing in much needed revenue that is currently being made only by states who allow such gambling.    I don’t think the Republicans are going to give in so easily though.  They’re going to try to paint Rendell as a greedy man who would forfeit the education of his youngest constituents in a political ploy to win his slot machines.    It doesn’t really make sense why the Republicans detest the slot machine plan with such a passion anyway.  People who are going to gamble are going to do so whether Pennsylvania has slot machines or not.  They will simply go to New Jersey or any other state that allows slot machines.  Why shouldn’t Pennsylvania cash in on these people’s gambling habits?

       "There are but two things guaranteed--death and taxes. - Ben Franklin"  Speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert (R), has introduced a bill, which calls for the elimination of Federal Income Tax and the IRS; replacing the current, unfair, tax code with a National Sales Tax.  Now I know what most of you are thinking right now, "Why should I care?"  Since most of my readers are rather young, most of you don’t give much thought to income taxes.  You probably don’t even know that April 15th is the deadline to file your end of the endless paper work.  This bill, if passed, will definitely impact your life if you have a job, especially a minimum wage job, like myself.  In addition to eliminating Income Taxes, the bill will also stop the deduction for Social Security out of all our paychecks each week.  The downside to all this is that you’ll pay slightly more for the things you buy.  Ultimately, we’ll all be paying less to fund government.  Stop and think how much money is spent in the US by foreign tourists each year.  All of that money will be subject to the National Sales Tax.  This bill, if signed into law, will create enormous economic growth in the US.  Companies will start outsourcing jobs  into  the US instead of shipping American jobs overseas.    The "fair tax" bill currently has 56 co-signers including only one congressman from PA, Pat Toomey (R).  I’m personally asking my representative, Bill Shuster (R), if he plans to co-sign and support House Bill 25 at a public forum on August 4th. I encourage all of you to ask your respective representative to support House Bill 25, also being called the "fair tax" bill.    Surprisingly, the liberals haven’t openly opposed this bill yet.  But really, what leg do they have to stand on?  Nobody can honestly say that our current system of taxation is fair.  How can anyone say its right to burden the richest 10% of American’s with 50% of the tax bill?  The system needs reform. The less money the government takes from you, the better off we are.
