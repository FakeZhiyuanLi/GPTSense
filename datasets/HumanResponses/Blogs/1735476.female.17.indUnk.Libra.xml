      I can't imagine all the people that you know And the places that you go When the lights are turned down low And I don't understand All the things you've seenBut I'm slipping in between You and your big... dream sit's always you and my big dreams And you tell me That it's over Wake up lying in a patch of four leaf clover And your restless And I'm naked You've got to get out You can't stand to see me shaking no, could you let me goI didn't think so and you don't want to be here in the future So you say the present's just a pleasantInterruption to the pastAnd you don't want to look much closer 'Cause you're afraid to find out all the hopeThat you had sent into the sky by now had... crashed and it did because of me And then you bring me homeAfraid to find out that you're alone, no And I'm sleeping in your living room But we don't have much roomTo liveAnd I had these dreams, in them I learned to play guitarMaybe cross the countryBecome a rockstarAnd there was hope in meThat I could take you thereBut damn you're so youngBut I don't think I careand if I hurt you then i'm sorry please don't think that this is easy And then you bring me home 'Cause we both know what its like to be alone, noAnd I'm dreaming in your living roomBut we don't have much roomTo liveAnd Konstantine is walking down the stairs Doesn't she look good Standing in her underwear?And I was thinking, what I was thinking But we've been drinking And it doesn't get me anywhere My Konstantine came walking down the stairs And all that I could doWas touch her long blond hair And I've been thinkingIt hurts me thinkingThat these nights when we were drinking No they never got us anywhere, no This is because I can spell konfusion with a K And I can like it It's to dying in anothers armsand why i had to try it It's to jimmy eat world and those nights in my car when the first star you seemay not be a starI'm not your star?Isn't that what you saidwhat you thought this song meant you thought this song meant And if this is what it takesjust to lie with my mistakesand live with what I did to you All the hell I put you through I always catch the clock it's 11:11And now you want to talkit's not hard to dreamYou'll always be my KonstantineMy Konstantine They'll never hurt you like I do No, They'll never hurt you like I do No, No, No, No, No, No, No, NoThis is to a girl who got into my headwith all these pretty things she didHey Baby, You know that you keep me up in bed It's to a girl who got into my headwith all the fucked up things I did Hey Maybe Baby, You could keep me up in bed&nbsp;My KonstantineSpin Around me like a DreamWe played out on this movie screenAnd i said, did you know I missed youDid you know I missed youDid you know I missed you Did you know I missed youDid you know I missed youDid you know I missed youDid you know I missed youI miss youAnd then you bring me homeAnd we'll go to sleep but this time not alone, no No,And you'll kiss me in your living room, ohI know you miss me in your living room Cause these nights I think maybe that I miss you in my living roomWe don't have much room I said, does anyboy need that room?

       Do you ever have those conversations with people that bring up really bad memories? last night i was talking to kuhn about alot of shit and i ended up just spewing everything i hate about myself to her. i feel bad for her, i would have punched me in the face.    &nbsp;  But you figure the candy coating has to come off sometime. i dont know my mind is really weird right now, thinking about my past and how far it seems i have come. but really in one night just talking about it kind of puts me right back where i was. its so hard to explain, and figuring mike is the only one who reads this...there is no need to explain bc he knows.    &nbsp;  however, wow, i dont know...

       I don't think i could be happier at this point in my life...     &nbsp;   well actually if i were going to Warped...but, cant have everything, otherwise we'd all be living in bliss. &nbsp;   &nbsp;  however back to the real world...i have white spots on my throat.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to the doctor in T-3 hours.   &nbsp;

      so today is an alright time...i started pilatis (sp?) yesterday and thats fun. dave says im trendy for it...well fuckin sweet.  its interesting how quickly we all want to grow up...im not trying to be insightful or anything right now...god knows im not like that. however, isnt it funny to think about how peoples morals are just thrown away in the matter of a drunken second?  why does everyone have to do that so recently? like it makes you more grown up or experienced? fuck it, its ok to be in a club on my own.   its funny how everyone always talks about wanting to be different. because HOLY SHIT having sex is a different thing to do. BY GOD NO ONE HAS EVER DONE THAT BEFORE.  not to say im not going to have sex...bc well...we all know my feelings on that.  you want to be so different and respected...but go on and degrade yourself some more...go on and fuck someone...anyone, because sex doesnt mean anything...right? giving away the one thing that was meant to be sacred and used in a state of love is nothing...am i right?   i dont think so.    dont worry D...i got big plans for ya.

      What's funny about this is that no one knows im blogging lately...its like the exact opposite of what people usually want. HA. fuck you all im blogging, bloggity sweet fucking blog!  anyhow. last night was fun, i had a bbq, wondering why some people didnt come with others...even though i may have said i only wanted some people there, in the back of my head i really wanted others there too. oh well, ill see them tonight or tomorrow, hopefully tonight.   i miss kat, i really do, i talked to her last night. i havent seen her in like 2 weeks. i miss her...  i hope the used is good, even if other people dont like them, i still do. sometimes they put me in the best mood.   i hate people to criticize (sp?wtf?) other peoples music...fuck you, find something useful to talk about, music is music...the way it makes you feel is something to talk about...  penis...cock...........................wang...

        Isnt it funny how your mind can change so quickly? ever since ive been back my whole mindset on life is different. i have my friends, mexicans and mexico in general to thank for that.           im finally ok with being home, even if it took this long. but my life has to change. i want to be different. i have to live my life. so what i want to................?....................................... (in the wise words of kat)..................................................mmmmmmm...NAH!          so from now on I'm doing what i want, without looking back, im going to act on what i feel and say what i would never normally say.          thats it....here i go....                    but first a shower.

      So i just  got back from MEXICO and i cant even take how much i miss it there. all the friends we made...and stuff like that just makes me insane thinking about it. it actually makes me sick to think how much fun i had there...im a changed woman completely...last year was awesome but this year we experienced so much more there are no words to describe it.          i miss them...         i miss the nights...         i miss............................................carlos o'brians.............         you can say you have been there and you miss it bc you get drunk there and shit like that...but when you actually gain friendships from the people that work there you would rather die than go home.         GOING BACK IN OCTOBER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
