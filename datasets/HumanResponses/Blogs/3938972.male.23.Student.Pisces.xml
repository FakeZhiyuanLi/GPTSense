      PETA&nbsp; sees you swat and kill a mosquito that was flying by you.  &nbsp;  Your argument for doing it: "It could have landed on me! What if it bit me? What if that mosquito had West Nile? I just saved my life  possibly .&nbsp; I have evidence from people all around me that the mosquito had the potential to bite me.”&nbsp;  PETA says: "Whatever! That fly was no threat to you whatsoever! It wasn't a grave threat.&nbsp; Sure, if it had stayed around long enough, it might have tried to bite you, but it wasn't doing anything at the time"   &nbsp;think about it...

      On my "One Nation..." post, I changed the last sentence.&nbsp; After someone pointed out to what I had typed, I thought about it and it came out the wrong way, so I deleted it. Sorry for the trouble

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “One nation, under God.”&nbsp; This phrase was once uttered by thousands of children without thought.&nbsp; Today, this one phrase is something that is splitting our nation in two.&nbsp; The right of our nation is telling us that it is our right to say this.&nbsp; The left is saying no, the government cannot tell you to say this.&nbsp; To be honest, I have to side with the left on this.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now before you go off and just say that I am a bleeding heart liberal, let me give you some information about myself.&nbsp; I am a member of the Bethlehem Missionary Baptist Church in Russellville, Alabama.&nbsp; I have been so for almost four years.&nbsp; I gave my heart to the lord on November 17, 1999.&nbsp; I have served as teacher and superintendent for my church.&nbsp; I love the lord with all of my heart and I will fight for him until he calls me home.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The argument that the conservative right has been fighting is the wrong fight.&nbsp; According to our constitution, our government cannot endorse a specific religion.&nbsp; The constitution was created to give all people certain rights.&nbsp; After it was created, the authors of our nation seen that certain rights were not granted or protected.&nbsp; Thus the amendments were born.&nbsp; The first amendment, which states “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” protects us from someone or something inhibiting us from worshipping our lord.&nbsp; However, it also protects those who do not recognize the lord from persecution as well.&nbsp; We as a Christian people must respect the laws of the land unless a law goes against God’s law.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When our authors of government created the first amendment, our country was in a different time.&nbsp; Churches were respected and our founding fathers observed this.&nbsp; The first amendment was created to prevent a church from becoming an official religion.&nbsp; This happened in England when Henry VIII created the Church of England.&nbsp; All British people were required to worship in this way.&nbsp; Our founding members of this country were persecuted because they did not want to worship this way.&nbsp; So when we won our freedom, we gave ourselves the ability to never let this happen again.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what are we to do?&nbsp; Technically, if our government does decide to remove “under God” from our pledge, it will not stop people from saying it.&nbsp; I know I will always say this and if the lord permits, when the time comes I will teach my children to say this.&nbsp; I am not inhibited from worshipping my lord because the government tells me that I don’t have to say this phrase.&nbsp; Neither is anyone else who chooses to say this.&nbsp; Removing school prayer doesn’t stop students from praying.&nbsp; The lord says to always be in prayer in heart.&nbsp; I can say a meaningful, silent prayer as well as I can say a meaningful prayer in front of a group of students.&nbsp; The lord will hear both of those prayers equally.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think our Christian brothers and sisters have forgotten that we are to be a peculiar people.&nbsp; The bible says that we are to be discriminated against.&nbsp; We are to be persecuted.&nbsp; We are in this world and not of this world.&nbsp; I am not saying to stop the fight, nor I am saying that the fight is not worth it.&nbsp; What I am saying is that we must be smart about this fight.&nbsp; We are not a Christian nation.&nbsp; Never has this nation stood up and claimed that we are a Christian nation.&nbsp; Since this country’s inception, we as a people have predominately been Christian, but that doesn’t mean that are a Christian nation by legal terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So again, I ask, what are we to do?&nbsp; The key to the whole to debate is looking long term.&nbsp; I am not in favor of changing the constitution to make our goals more achievable.&nbsp; The reason is that the change would be far sighted.&nbsp; What helped us for 200 years and now hurting us, if changed, will help us for a short time and hurt us again.&nbsp; I believe the key is the vote.&nbsp; Our nation is built on secular laws, but can be led by Christian people.&nbsp; These individuals can lead us in the path of right.&nbsp; We can instill in our children our Christian values.
