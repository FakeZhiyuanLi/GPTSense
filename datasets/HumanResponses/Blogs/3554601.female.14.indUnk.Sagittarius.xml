      well this is tha 1st day of tha blog! i had a really hard time doing this and i even had to get help from mr. deal!! today was pretty boring...but the other day i got 2 phone calls that made my day! i hope my life improves cuz its not going to good right now! I think im takin sami joe to tha beach this weekend but im not sure yet cuz she still has to ask her mom if she can go.  I got my report card the other day n got good grades considering all the makeup work i had to do from when i got suspended...so i guess i'll be in 9th next year!
