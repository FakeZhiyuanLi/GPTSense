        I had an interesting dream last night....and thought someone out there might like to take a stab at what it might mean.    In the dream, I had bought myself a nice house that was quite near a huge theme park. This didn't bother me too much, and I got on with my life. One morning, I woke up, and somehow, the theme park had managed to build a new rollercoaster over night, and it was half in my property. I was a little upset by it at first, but then I got over it and became excited instead, as I now had a way to climb into the theme park for free.    Well I am quite a rollercoaster junkie, and love going to theme parks and riding the wild rides. And I looked around a few minutes and one possible interpretation is that I could be suffering from a lack of fun in my life, and need to get out there and enjoy life a little more. In a way this could apply, but I am not too sure. So if anyone out there has any ideas about other meanings, I would be more than happy to hear them.    Take care now....and sweet dreams!

        Driving home from work yesterday, there were yet another two incidents of people doing stupid things on the road. I was just about getting out of Winchester on my way home from work, and as all UK drivers are supposed to know, you yield to the right at a roundabout. This was working just fine at one particular roundabout. I was in a line of cars all turning right at the roundabout, and we were making our way through. Suddenly as I am about to turn, this woman in a little rubbish car, starts accelerating into the roundabout. I had to slam on brakes to avoid hitting her, and she was giving me a real mouthful as she carried on her way. At first I actually thought I was the one at fault and had gone out of turn in the roundabout. I was driving along feeling slightly guilty after that, when I suddenly realised that I was not the one in the wrong and she had just been really stupid and not waited her turn. For all the anger she directed towards me, I hope she felt pretty stupid if/when she realised that she was the one at fault. A short while later, I was driving up a main road near my home, and it just happened to be a two lane road that merged into one. And again, as everyone is supposed to know, when the two lanes become one, it's only polite to feed in one car from the left, then one from the right, etc. Well I started edging my way over behind the car in front of me to the left, but the person behind that car was obviously in some kind of mood, and was adamant that I should not be let in. She tried to drive so close to the car in front that she was almost touching his bumper. Unfortunately for her, I have a bigger car, and as the rules of the road were on my side, I just kept going to get into the lane. Had she carried on with her futile attempt to block me off, she would either have had to swerve off the road, or drive into the side of me. The law would have been on my side in that instance, and she would have been the one to blame had she hit me. What I don't get, is why people just can't stick to the rules of the road. It aggravates me when I see people driving the wrong way in a one way lane - even if it is just a shopping centre parking area. It also bugs me when people zip off down the shoulder on a highway to try avoid a piece of traffic, and then force their way back into the traffic when they think they've gone far enough. People need to get back to a place where they have common decency and courtesy for others. Especially when driving. Traffic would probably be reduced if all the morons driving like idiots could just learn to obey the rules of the road.

        And now back to the Lightning escapade...   Well now that I have a little time again, I can rewrite my little story from yesterday. I did warn you that you would probably be hearing about Lightning’s antics from time to time.   First of all, let me introduce you to Lightning. She is an Abyssinian kitten and is about 9 months old. She is sorrel coloured, and a very beautiful little girl. She is also very friendly and affectionate, as well as talkative. She has a lot to say to whoever will listen. She was born in October 2003 in Colchester, Essex, and came home to live with me January this year. Of the entire litter, I selected her because she was the bravest and most inquisitive. When I went to meet her, she was the first one to come up and meet me, before whizzing off to play some more. Her official registered name is Lady Lara Croft and this was chosen by the breeder. I dubbed her Lightning because the name fits her well. She doesn’t do anything at a slow pace. It’s all about speeding around as quickly as she can, almost to the point of being frantic.&nbsp;      So now that you know a little more about her, let me tell you what she got up to the other day…   As I have already mentioned, Lightning is an extremely friendly and affectionate cat, and when I arrive home from work, she rushes over to say hello and get some affection, and tells me all about her day to the best of her abilities. This has pretty much become a routine and I find it very adorable.   Yesterday I arrived home, and was not met by the little purring cannonball. Instead she was hiding under the sofa with just a tiny nose and eyes peeping out at me. She was also not being as vocal as usual, and was just mewing quietly to say hello. I was a little surprised but not too worried, as I am quite used to cats having quite varied personalities.   I went about my ‘chores’ for the day, and when I finished, I came back to the room, and she was still hiding under the sofa. I was finding this quite strange and started getting worried that she may have been hurt or perhaps she had been ‘disciplined’ by my landlord. This does happen once in a while, whenever she decides that outdoors is not good enough for her, and she finds a pot plant or somewhere else to use as her litter box. The form of discipline is being sprayed with a water bottle just enough to let her know she’s been bad. So it’s not a harsh discipline. I went and checked with the landlord, and he said that nothing had happened.   I then decided I had better get her out from under the sofa and check that everything was ok. So I reached under the sofa, and she backed away to the far corner. I was not going to be that easily deterred, so I reached even further. I grabbed something cold and ‘mushy’ for want of a better word. My first instinct was to let go, but then logic took over, and as I already had it in my hand, I just pulled it out, and found to my absolute delight, a half-eaten bird.   I’ve had cats before, and I am used to finding ‘presents’ every once in a while, but I’ve never had the luck to grab one without knowing it was there before. I gave Lightning a very stern lecture about bringing animals into the house, while I disposed of the poor bird. After washing my hand very thoroughly, I got back to the room to find that Lightning was now very upset with me, and not on speaking terms. She bolted out of the room and went outside. She decided not to return for a few hours. She probably though I had eaten her dinner.   As much as it was quite a disgusting experience to grab hold of that bird, I wasn’t quite sure whether I should be proud that my little girl was learning to hunt or not. She’s nearly all grown up now. What I do know for sure, is that I will be a lot more careful about looking under the sofa first before trying to grab something under it.

       So here it is...my first official gripe blog.  I was thinking about Lightning after I wrote my initial blog entry, and I decided I needed to tell you all about her escapades yesterday just for the hell of it. So I wrote the entire thing out, and as I hit submit, my work connection dropped, so I got a 'Page could not be displayed' error. I hit the back button, but it was too late, the whole story was gone, and now has to be rewritten. I don't have time to do it right now, but I will get round to doing it a bit later on. Now I've been at this Internet game for a good long while now, and I am almost paranoid about submitting any kind of long written detail, and will copy the text I've written before posting nearly every time. But of course I will have the problem the one time that I don't actually copy first.  It really annoys me when my connection dies at a crucial moment. I think somehow, there is some kind of intelligent software out there that knows when you can least afford a connection drop, and makes sure that your connection drops at exactly that time. It's all just to make sure you get a little more frustrated.

       So I've finally done it...I've joined the ranks of the bloggers.  "Why?" you ask.  Well, because I think I actually might have something to say. I've been noticing blogging all over the Internet lately and I've been feeling a bit left out. It seems like a good way to get your thoughts out of your head and into the world. I've seen people blogging about all kinds of things and I felt I had better join in.  So I started looking around, see how it all worked, who had what to offer, and what my best options would be. I eventually decided that I didn't feel like signing up with someone else's service, and as I have my own domain, and I am a developer, why the hell not put my own blogging system up. I searched around a few minutes at work today, (Yes, at work. I needed a break from my current project ok. So just let it go.) and I came across this handy little blogging system that you now see in front of you. It's called dasBlog and if you're interested, it can be found   urlLink  here   . It is free. Yep...you heard right. Free!. Isn't that really nice of the people at Newtelligence. It takes a few minutes to get set up, and once it's up, you can blog to your heart's content. So enough of the publicity for Newtelligence right now.  Next up I need to mention   urlLink  www.blogger.com   . They are another free blogging site where you don't have to host the blog on your own site if you don't want to. You can set up a free blog quite easily to them. I am cross posting my blog to them as well.  I'm not entirely sure what I will be blogging here yet, but I do know that I have lots of opinions and things to say. So you could hear my views on the latest music albums or dvds, get an earful about what my little lightning (insane Abyssinian kitten who lives up to her name)&nbsp; has been up to lately, get a rant about the latest idiot to get in my way, or anything else I feel the need to write about. So if you're into rambling - sometimes useful, sometimes not so useful. Keep checking back. you might find something interesting here. You can also leave comments and discuss things if you like. But please...this is a clean blog...and if you leave vulgar or any comment I deem unworthy, I will remove it - cos it's my blog!  I'll be back...  Bye for now!nj
