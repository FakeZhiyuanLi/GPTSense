      Why else would I get up at 6:00 a.m. on a Saturday morning to take Derek to hockey practice?  That's earlier than when I get up for work.  Good night!

      Over the years, I have been the target of several  urlLink nicknames , the most recent being  urlLink The Beaver .    The first nickname I can remember dates back to  urlLink grade school .  When I was younger, much younger, I had a full head of thick unmanageable hair.  Unmanageable, you see, because I had not yet discovered  urlLink hair gel .  So, my thick, un-gelled lid earned me the moniker “Bun Head”  Oh, fun days they were!  Then during  urlLink high school , probably as a result of science class, my last name mysteriously evolved into  urlLink Beaker .  I think my good ole friend Greg Baran helped that one to stick.  Apparently, 2 syllables is too much for us lazy humans to say ‘cause this name eventually got shortened to “Beak.”  Later on in high school and into  urlLink university , I became well known for my love of  urlLink Tim Hortons .  Can you guess what’s coming?  Yup, that’s right.  Timbit.  Even at  urlLink work , I’m know for other names then just Al.  There’s another Al in our office so, to avoid confusion, people call him AK  and me AB.  Even something as simple as AB has been shortened to just B.  So if I hear somebody say “Hey B”, I know they’re calling me.  My former co-worker Mark started a whole range of nicknames starting with “ urlLink Al B. Sure  Baker.”  When I went to Tokyo twice in one month on business I became Al B. Sure “Bonsai!” Baker.  I can’t even remember them all.  I was always Al B. Sure “Something” Baker  Finally, there are the  urlLink FRWY  nicknames.  Oh it doesn’t stop at just Beaver.  No, I’m Alastair and Albert too.  (Thanks  urlLink Pernell .)  Actually, come to think of it I used to get Albert in high school too.  Remember those  urlLink Canadian Tire  commercials with the hockey player named Albert and the whole crowed chanted his name?  Yeah, that resulted in me being Albert for awhile.  Surprised I’ve never had:  Al-i-babba, or Al-o-rama, or Al-a-gator.  I am only 33.  Plenty of life left for those I guess.

      Well, why not?  So many of my  urlLink church  friends are blogging, I couldn't resist starting my own.  Oh, I've tried.  Been resisting it for weeks now actually.  And totally decided on a whim today to make the plunge (when I really should have been  urlLink working ).  Not that I'll ever have anything  really  significant to say.    I like the interactive nature of blogs.  I like the concept of journaling, although I've never been able to find the time to consistently do it.  I hope I don't use it just to vent and whine.   Why  urlLink "The Beav"  nickname?  It started at Wednesday night floor hockey.  I think it was  urlLink Pete Martin  and  urlLink Pernell Goodyear  that started it.  I was playing goalie and, I guess, they thought I was doing a good job (I don't think so!).  They started saying that I was a beaver putting up a dam.  HA!  Well it has sure taken off from there.  Now Pernell tells me that I am as busy as a beaver.  I guess I've helped to make it stick.  So I don't mind.  Not sure I like the format and features of this blog.  But I like the price (free). I like Pernell's format much better.  Maybe when I get some coin I'll transfer over.  We'll see.  So I hope you enjoy my musings (that word seems  so  over used now).  I hope I can, at least sometimes, say something profound.  Most of all, I hope that you, my friends, get to know me a little better and that you think that's a good thing.  A friend of mine once said that intimacy means "in-to-me-see."  Well, here I am.

      I have to because ever since I read it two days ago, my mind keeps going back to it.  My friend  urlLink Brian  posted this on his Blog:  The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want He makes me lie down in green pastures He leads me beside quiet waters He restores my soul  He guides me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for You are with me Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me  You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life  And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever  (Psalm 23)  Rest in peace, Cecilia Zhang. When we meet in Heaven, I will tell you how you made me love my son even more.   Thanks Brian for putting into words what i've been thinking ever since Cecilia disappeared and every time I hear of a child gone missing.  Peace.

      Thanks to my  urlLink Transplanted Texan Friend , I have found a free way to add pictures to my Blog.  I love the one of Jordan that I posted below.   urlLink Carolynn  took it at the  urlLink FRWY  Retreat a couple of weeks ago.

      The  urlLink FRWY  had an art gallery tonight instead of our usual Infusion Worship Gathering.  It was a lot of fun.  I've never been much of an artist.  In grade school I used to get C-'s (just short of failing.) In high school, I took an introductory piano class to get the one art credit I needed to graduate.  If I had to take a visual arts class, I might have never got out of high school.  I do like photography.  But, I've never considered my photos "art", until tonight.   I have a pretty run-of the-mill point and shoot camera and love experiencing God's great outdoors.  I go to  urlLink Algonquin Park  every summer and love to take photos.  Well,  urlLink Krista  encouraged me to put some photos into the art gallery.  I did.  Krista put my five photos into some frames and they actually looked great!  Thanks for the encouragement Krista.

         I've blogged about my oldest son Derek now a couple of times, but have said nothing about my younger son Jordan.  You can tell Jordan has an older brother because he is sometimes witty beyond his years.  Saturday night we were out for dinner and were talking with the boys about Amy's Baptism (Amy is Cindy's younger sister who was baptized tonight).  Jordan said, "Why is Auntie Amy getting baptized?"  Cindy replied, "Auntie Amy is getting baptized because she believes in Jesus."  Jordan says, in the cutest voice, "I believe in Jesus, can I get baptized?"  He is so adorable!

      Derek's hockey team battled hard but were in tough as they lost their championship hockey game this morning.   I have to share this story because this is one of the traits of my son that I truly love.  Even though his team lost, they still got a trophey (as did the other two teams that did not play today).  After he received his trophey, he turned around and skated a couple of strides back toward the stands and holding that trophey in one hand, pumped it up in the air a couple of times.  He was so proud of getting that trophey, even though they didn't win.  I love his innocence.  I love his innate ability to see the good in situations that other kids might be disappointed in. I love him so much that I find myself fighting back tears as I'm typing this.  God has so incredibly blessed me.

      The below story was posted on  urlLink Yahoo  from  urlLink Reuters .  Pretty cool story.  If only people would realize that they don't need to see a Mel Gibson movie to be transformed by Jesus' sacrifice for us.  Christ Movie Moves Man to Confess Murder  HOUSTON (Reuters) - A repentant Texas man went to police after seeing Mel Gibson's controversial film "The Passion of Christ" and confessed to murdering a 19-year-old woman who was pregnant with his child, authorities said on Thursday.   Police had thought Ashley Nicole Wilson, who died on Jan. 18, had hanged herself, but Dan Leach, 21, went to them on March 9 to admit that he had killed her, said Fort Bend County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Jeannie Gage.   Leach wanted to seek redemption after talking to a friend and seeing the movie about the last hours of Christ's life, she said.   "He mentioned that speaking with the friend and seeing the movie 'The Passion of Christ' made him feel remorse," Gage said.   Leach said he killed Wilson because she was pregnant with his child and he did not want to be involved with her anymore, she said.   Wilson was found in her apartment with a suicide note describing her depression but Leach said he staged the murder to look like she had killed herself. The Houston Chronicle first reported the story in its online edition.   Leach was released after his confession while police investigated and was arrested on Tuesday after a grand jury indicted him. He was being held on $100,000 bail, Gage said.   The Mel Gibson film has been criticized for graphic violence and for its portrayal of the role of Jews in the death of Christ.

      What a game!  Derek's team won the game 5-3.  Although Derek didn't score any goals, he played a great game.  I'm so proud.  So now it's on to the Championship game this Saturday at 8:00 a.m.  It's going to be a blast!  It's an early one but all are welcome to come to the game and cheer.  Coronation Arena is on Macklin Ave just north of King Steet.  Macklin Ave is the road that runs parallel to Hwy 403 down to Princess Point at Cootes Paradise.

      Big game tonight.  My son Derek's hockey team, The Coronation Admiral Trophies Leafs, play a must win playoff game tonight.  If they win, the're in the Championship game this Saturday.  If they lose, it's all over.  It's going to be tough.  Tonight's opponent has already secured a spot in the championship game.  A battle of epic proportions.  I'm so excited...I can't wait.  You'd be surprised how thrilling and exciting Novice (7-8 years old) hockey can be.  I'll let you know what happens.

      Most of you know that I spend a lot of time in my car commuting to Mississauga and on sales calls for work.  So music is a huge thing for me.  Here are the CD's I listened to this week in the car:   urlLink Evanescence  -  urlLink Fallen     urlLink The Tragically Hip  -  urlLink Phantom Power   urlLink The Northern Pikes  -  urlLink Secrets of the Alibi   urlLink The Northern Pikes  -  urlLink Snow in June   I finally bought the Evanescence and Hip CD's this week.  Really liking the Evanescence CD.  I like a couple songs on The Hip CD (Poets, Bobcaygon, Fireworks).  Last Hip CD I liked from start to finish was  urlLink Fully Completely   I re-discovered the Pikes this week.  I really like this band.  I'll have to post again about them.  One song in particular that I loved when I was younger, toubles me a little now that I am a Christian.  The song is called Unimportant.  Actually, there are a few songs on Snow in June that are kind of dark.  Stay tuned.  I want to post about it further.

      Derek made Cindy and I kill ourselves laughing today.  He's a live, walking TV Guide.  He announced to us this afternoon what cartoon was coming on  urlLink Teletoon  at 5 o'clock. (Don't remember what show it was)  The funny thing is the way he announces it " Such-n-such is coming on at 5 o'clock, but we don't watch that show"  So he has this memory like  urlLink Dustin Hoffman  in  urlLink Rain Man  for both the shows he watches and the shows he doesn't.  It's so funny!  Last week at the  urlLink FRWY  retreat too was funny.  Derek was constantly monitoring the schedules posted around the building and reminding us of the next scheduled event.  Guess he's too young to understand the concept of "FRWY Time"

      I tried adding a Bio section to the side bar of this blog.  I didn't like the way it looked.  Blogger's (or Blogspot's) free blogs don't give you multiple pages for these types of things.  So, I simply created a new blog and I'll just link to it.  My bio stuff is there and I plan on adding to it from time to time.  The link:  urlLink About me

      Heard on the radio this morning that a company in Saskatchewan (or as  urlLink Phil Callaway  calls it: Saskatchabush), has developed a process to convert pig poop into methane gas as an energy source.  Remember the old oil furnaces that had the huge tank in the basement?  Perhaps in the future we'll have big tanks in our basesments for pig poop!  Hey  urlLink Mark , does it make you feel any better that you actually had a shower in the "energy of the future" and not just a couple of pails of pig poop?

      A friend of mine from work put me on to an interesting website.  It's called  urlLink Christian Apologetics & Research Ministry.   This website defines Apologetics as "the practice of defending the Christian faith against those who raise objections to its validity.  We are commanded to be apologists (those who defend the faith) in 1 Pet. 3:15 - ". . . always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you. . . "    Someone once told me that they did not like the book  urlLink A Case for Faith by Lee Stroebel  because it is "too apologetic."  After reading some of this website, I don't really understand how you can be  too    apologetic.  Anyway, there's a ton of info here.  I'll add it to my links list.  Have a look.

      Those of you who know me, know that I could stand to shed a few pounds.  I believe the term is "portly."  [Reminds me of a funny  urlLink Cheers  episode when  urlLink Sam Malone  is trying score with a lady but the lady has a bit of a fetish and is smitten with barfly  urlLink Paul .  Sam says "How can this be??? Paul is....Paul is..."  Paul interjects emphatically "The term is portly Sam!  I'm portly!"]  Yup, I'm portly.  I regularly worship at that great white alter in the kitchen.  Cindy bought this book on weight loss.  I'm embarrassed a little to admit who it's written by.  But I am endeavouring to be transparent (remember in-to-me-see?) so I'll admit that it is written by  urlLink Dr.Phil .  Believe me, I have not nor could I ever force myself to sit through one of his TV shows.  It's nauseating.  However, I somehow forced myself to block the sound of his southern drawl out of my head as I read the  urlLink book .  Other than being quite repetitive, the book was quite good.    It has, at the least, inspired me to set goals and timelines to what my diet and exercise.  I want to lose 45 pounds, 2 pounds a week from March 8 to August 16.  So far so good.  The first three days have actually been pretty easy.  Which is a total switch for me.  Normally when I start watching what I eat, it's murder.  Hopefully that bodes well for the future.  I want this to be a permanent change of mind.  The warmer weather inspires me to get out and get some exercise.  There is a lot of heart disease and stroke in my mom's family and that worries me a lot.   There's a lot of work to do, one day at a time.

       urlLink Work  was a little frustrating today.  This morning I had to drive all the way to  urlLink Markham  to meet a client at a dusty warehouse to look through some of our desks he has stored there.  Not fun.  So I have sold this job in Montreal for 10 trading desks.  This is a brand new trading desk and this is the first time it's been sold to anyone.  I sold this job with no brochure for this desk.  Just some drawings, a couple pictures from our showroom and a good relationship on previous projects in other locations.  I instructed our Project Manager and Engineer to review the cable management in the desk and make sure that the large volume of cables can be accomodated (Cable management is a huge deal in our business) .  Engineer says "It'll be fine"  And I'm like, Wait a minute, was this really looked at?  So I have to drag the President, the Project Manager and Engineering Supervisor into our showroom and say: Show me.  Here we are, looking at a desk we are already selling (albeit with no literature), and we are trying to figure out how the cable management will work.  This is so bass ackwards.  This should so be thought about when designing a desk, not after.  Things like this almost always result in me going (sheepishly) to the client telling them that we need to make some changes and that it's going to cost them this much.  That's hard and frustrating.  On top of all this, all the other salespeople were out of the office today and I was looking after all their stuff too.  Sorry for venting...and the long post.  I know life could be a lot worse.  And I don't want to draw the ire of  urlLink Bob   I feel a little better now.

      I don't understand some of the fashion business either.  While channel surfing the other night I caught some of one of these  urlLink fashion shows .  These outfits are outrageous.  Which begs the question (for me anyway):  Does anybody actually buy these clothes?  Hard for me to believe.  And if not, why spend all the time and money designing, producing, and then organizing a huge elaborate show?  Does it highlight an excessive/wastefulness inherent to the business?

      I don't get it.  Why do skiers feel the need to keep their lift ticket stuck to the zipper on their coats for weeks after they've gone skiing?  Is it really a "Hey look at me, I'm a skier" kind of thing?  When I go to a sporting event ( urlLink Blue Jays ,  urlLink Leafs , even the  urlLink Ti-Cats ), I don't stick the ticket stub to my forehead for a couple of weeks after.  After I go bowling I don't keep wearing the stinking, dirty socks that were stuck in the rental shoes.  No offense to any of you whom may be skiers.  I just don't get it.

      I love this city.  For a number of reasons I guess. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what it is.  Maybe the fact that the culture here is a little different, yet similar to  urlLink Hamilton  and  urlLink Toronto .  The food is great too.  Had a  HUGE  smoked meat sandwich yesterday from Reubens (sorry, no decent url link). LOVE IT! More meat than you can shake a stick at.  The train ride was about what I expected.  Loved the 5 minute drive from home to the Aldershot station.  Sure beats that 40 minute drive to Pearson.  I was a little disappointed about one thing.  The ads on TV recently, talk about how great the train is because you can plug your laptop in.  Well, I guess us peasants in economy class aren't entitled to that luxury.  Be nice if VIA urlLink   would put some small print on their commercials.  Mildly misleading, but if I had of really thought about it I would have realized this.  Same kind of tratment you get on airplanes also.  Even though I love Montreal, I don't enjoy travelling as much as I used to.  Nice to see different places.Nice to get a break from the kids, and the wife ;-) .  Now even for a couple days, I miss them too much.  Kids are at such great ages.  Love carpet wrestling, even though I'm starting to get the snot kicked out of me.  Love watching  urlLink hockey  with Derek.  Looking forward to coming home tomorrow night.

      So I'm off to  urlLink Montreal  tomorrow for a 3 day business trip.  Doing something different this time.  I'm taking the  urlLink train .  When you factor in things like travel time to and from both airports, it actually doesn't tak that much longer.  (Less than two hours difference for the trip there.)  And I only need to drive to the Aldershot station.  Should be an interesting trip.  Should be a lot more relaxing than flying.  I'll let you know how it goes.  Another early morning coming up.  Need to be up at 4:00.  Hopefully I can catch a few winks during the ride.

      Although not nearly on the same scale as the Great Goodyear Flood, we had our own little water calamity this morning.  Cindy woke up at 4:30 and heard running water in our laundry room (right next to our bedroom in the basement).  Seems the pipe going into the hot water tank decided to spotaneously spring a leak.  We figure by the amount of water that it must have been leaking for at least 30 minuties.  Good thing Cindy's a light sleeper and good thing I ouwn a Wet/Dry Vac.  Lot of stuff's wet, but we'll manage.  I have to head out of town for three days tomorrow.  Please pray that nothing else will happen to Cindy while I'm away.  The house we rent is quite old.  Cindy's more than a little freaked out, especially after what the Goodyears are going through.  Peace.  Al

      A friend of Cindy and I, Angie Williams, plays in a band called Messenger.  They are playing at Cafe Adonai! this Saturday night at 7 p.m.  Apparently, Cafe Adonai! is a Christian Sports "bar" located on Kenilworth Ave just south of Main St.  This event is is kid friendly.  Anyone reading this is welcome to go.  Cindy and I will probably be there.

      Just a quick entry before I begin Night 2 of Tax Return Hell.  Tonight my 8 year old son Derek was doing his homework.  Each night he has to write 2 sentences using the spelling words from that week's list.  His second sentence tonight was: "Hardships can travel across the Great Lakes."  Priceless.

      Haven't had much time to blog lately.  It just seems to have been quite busy.  Won't have much time over the next week either.  I still have not done my or Cindy's tax returns yet.  Quite a bit of work adding up  receipts and stuff.  I better get to work soon.  You may have heard that there was a big fire at King and Sherman on Wednesday.  Electronic Liquidators (the old Midtown appliance store) caught on fire along with all the apartments upstairs.  One poor young guy, his name escapes me right now (I know Cindy knows it), was in tears on the news because he had lost everything he owns, including his pet and all his 2.5 year old son's toys.  Well, this really made an impact on Cindy.  She and the boys gathered together some toys and when I got home we drove down to the City Motor Inn to give them to his son.  He was so happy.  Apparently four other people had given him stuff that day before us.  One lady even gave him a dresser.    We gave him our phone number and invited him to come to our house for dinner some time.  He said he would take us up on the offer.  I hope he does.  Peace.

      For a day that was supposed to be quiet, today ended up being pretty busy.  I was asked yesterday by my friend Gerald, to go to a men's group breakfast this morning at  urlLink Winterberry Heights Church .  Well, it turns out the men's group, faciltated by  urlLink Philpott Church   urlLink Senior Pastor Lane Fusilier , ended a couple of weeks ago.  Not entirely a bad thing.  It was really great having breakfast with Gerald and spending a couple hours getting caught up.  Ever since I met Gerald, he's been my spirtual "big brother."  So, it was fantastic spending some time with him today.  We hadn't really spent any time together since the  urlLink Promise Keepers  conference last November.  Just got home and had to take Jordan to karate.  I can't tell you how cute our little munchkin is in his karate outfit doing his kicks, jumping jacks and push ups.    Home for a while, gave the kids lunch and out again to take the boys for a haircut.  Thankfully they're no longer looking like  urlLink Beatles  offspring.  Home to get Cindy and out to a couple of stores.  Home for like 30 seconds and then back out to get  urlLink groceries . Just get them put away and out to the school yard with the boys.   Had a lot of fun shooting hoops with Derek.  He's growing up so fast.  He's  finally  riding his bike on his own.  That just happened last weekend.  We knew last year he could ride, but he wouldn't do it unless we were holding on to him.  Last weekend at the school yard, he watched a kid younger than him bombing around on his bike.  This finally motivated Derek to just go.  And he did.  Now that's all he wants to do.  I don't mind, it's great.    Tomorrow's going to be busy too.  We're taking part in Sabrina's Walk for Smiles, take Derek to buy a bithday gift for his friend's party tomorrow afternoon, meeting at the  urlLink church , and church itself tomorrow.  Oh well.  It's all good.

      I'm sitting here in the office, it's beautiful outside and I have a song stuck in my head. One of those old "summer" tunes.  I can't remember the artist.  "Sunny days....Ooooh sunny, sunny, sunny da_ays.  Nothing better in the world, you know, than lying in the sun with your radio..."  Oh, how I wish I was outside today.  Don't even have a sales call scheduled.  Too bad.  Only 4 hours 12 minutes until 5 o'clock!!

      It seems I get a few visitors to this blog from the Far East.  How do I know this you might ask?  Well, you'll notice that I have a "Site Meter" on this blog.  Well Site Meter tracks the visitors to my blog by time zone, ISP provider, web browser version, etc.    According to Site Meter, approximately 4% of the visitors to my blog come from the time zone that includes Singapore, Phillipines, Indonesia, Malaysia.

      My wife is an artist, if you didn't already know.  Today she did a small painting that I totally love.  The perspective is looking through some very beautiful flowers out to the ocean.  She says she was just fooling around.  I think it's great.  I love my wife.  I think she is great.

      What a great time it was last night at FRWY. urlLink    The final performance was really exciting.  Quite a few friends and family came.  Thanks to:  - Mom and Joe - Doug, Jewell, Alden, Ben, Amy (and Amy's friend Denni) - Ruth & Gerald - Ruth, Dan, Chelsey, Alisha & Mara - Randy, Edith, Jane and Eric - Bruce, Crystal, Cameron & Malcolm  It was great that you all came out.  Cindy and I were discussing the whole gathering today.  She was incredibly impressed with the professionalism of the production.  This is testimony to all the hard work of everyone involved.  It is also testimony to the job done by Pernell directing the play.  We think that this drama made a great impression to all the visitors to the FRWY.  Another thing that was great last night was the worship.  Melissa, Dallas and Dave did a fantastic job last night.  Ever since we started going to the FRWY, we have been impressed by the worship leaders and band members. The musicians make it very clear that they are worshipping God when playing their instruments and singing.  They demonstrate this with the humbleness in their body language, they way they don't even acknowledge that they're being watched.  Their playing is all about sincerely worshipping God and nothing to do with performing for an audience.    Anyway, Cindy and I are both very happy to be a part of this great church community and last night really epitomized this.

      Below is an article that I wrote for the newsletter at  urlLink Philpott Memorial Church  a couple of years ago.  It outlines how I came to know Jesus.  The "community" that I describe is one of the things that my new church,  urlLink FRWY , has as one of it's strengths.  I wanted to post this on my blog to reinforce the importance of this ideal.  As Connections Leader @ FRWY, reading this tonight is inspiring me to do more, be more creative, to be somebody else's Ruth and Gerald (read on and you will know what I mean). I hope you find it inspiring, whether you have a relationship with Christ or not.  *******  On Sunday October 21 (2001), Pastor Lane interviewed me as a lead into his message during the contemporary service.  During the interview he asked me how long I had been attending Philpott.  He also asked me to share with the congregation how the church had helped me grow as a Christian.  I answered the questions and then took my place in the pew.  My first feelings after sitting down were relief and happiness.  I was happy to be able to share my church experience with the congregation.  But then a sense of disappointment crept in.  There was so much more that I could have said!  What could I do to share more? Quickly I thought, "Maybe a second interview?"  No, I didn't think that would happen.  At the end of the sermon, Lane held up a newsletter and encouraged us to read it.  "That's it!!" I thought.  Therefore, I submit to you this article.  I hope to share more of my experience with you in way that will encourage you to be an important part of the Church you have always longed for.    My wife Cindy and I began attending Philpott in September 1999.  Cindy had been working on me for a long time to start going to church.  The pressure increased with the birth of our second son that June.  Cindy had some exposure to Christianity as a child and became a believer at age 9.  She had not attended church regularly but felt the strong need to be raising our children in a Christian home.  Finally that September she warned me that she was going to take the kids to church with or without me.  Reluctantly, I agreed to come too.   Only God could have arranged the sequence of events that first day.  We arrived early as Cindy insisted that we attend Sunday School as well as a service.  We asked two people in the parking lot where we should go.  Just as we were asking them, Pat Harvey was getting out of her car.  They told us to go with her.  Pat took us into the gym and introduced us to Pastor Wayne.  Wayne then introduced us to Ruth and Gerald L'Abbe. During that Sunday school class, Ruth graciously let us use her Bible.  After the service Ruth and Gerald did something they said that had never done before.  They invited us over for lunch.  I couldn't believe how nice these complete strangers were being to us!    Six weeks later Gerald helped me in praying for forgiveness and asking the Lord into my life.  So many things over those six weeks helped me grow to that decision.  Walter Dickson was the first person to share the Gospel with me.  I had never heard it before.  I also learned of the resurrection of Jesus.  The truthfulness of what I was hearing really impacted me. But that wasn't all.  We experienced so much love in those first weeks.  A friendship emerged with Ruth and Gerald and we got together often.  We started a 50 day spiritual adventure on our second Sunday.  That was an immediate introduction to regular Bible study, which was a fantastic experience.  We went to a Newcomers Luncheon.  Jeanette Carey insisted that she  hold and entertain Jordan (only 4 months old at the time).  It was just what we needed to be able to enjoy our meal and converse with other people.  At that Luncheon we sat with Rick and Martha Bradford.  Again, we experienced a genuine interest in us that was very comforting.  And our son Derek got a real kick out of Rick.  Rick talked us into bringing Derek to Awana on Tuesdays.  Also in those first weeks I played touch football and attended a men's breakfast.    On Tuesday November 16, 1999, in my car in the Philpott parking lot, I accepted Jesus as my Saviour.  I will never be the same again.    That Sunday, Cindy and I dedicated our children to the Lord.  Before Lane dedicated Derek and Jordan, I announced my good news to the congregation.  After the service Ruth Marshall hugged each of us with tears of joy in her eyes.  She had been praying for us.  In the past two years we have continued to grow in our faith at Philpott.  I have taken part in several adult electives, men's breakfasts, and a retreat.  Cindy & I completed the Alpha Course with Ruth and Gerald.  We really wanted to get connected so we attended a Christmas party with the "In Betweens." Cindy was asked to help out with coordinating the 2's and 3's room.  That has helped us connect with a lot of parents as well.  Now we are a part of a small group facilitated by Jason and Joanne Silver.  The first few meetings have been great and Cindy and I are really excited about getting to know the people in this group better and growing further in our faith with them.  In closing, I would like to re-iterate the importance of the relationships that I have experienced at Philpott in my coming to faith and in my growth since.  I encourage you to take the time to chat with somebody you don't know.  Maybe you could even invite them over for lunch!  I also encourage you to get involved.  It will open doors to friendships and growth in spirit and faith.  Consider this: Perhaps this article is part of God's plan to encourage you to do something different like invite a newcomer over to lunch.  Maybe you'll help lead somebody to faith.  You  can  make a difference!  ******

      ...and I have not yet partaken of the morning meal.  Rachel!!  Been a busy week.  Thus, the lack of posts.  Two  Crown of Thorns  performances down, one to go.  Early reviews have been positive.  Thanks  urlLink Dave .    One more, tomorrow at  urlLink FRWY .  I'm looking forward to this one the most.

      We had our last dress rehearsal tonight for our Easter drama  The Crown of Thorns .  It went well, although Thursday's rehearsal seemed to be better.  I think we know the play so well now (been rehearsing since November) that maybe the rehearsals are getting a little mundane.  I think that once we are able to perform for an audience that it's going to be awesome!   I've really enjoyed getting to know the other cast members much better.  I love them all ( urlLink Pernell ,  urlLink Mark ,  urlLink Krista  and Sharlene.)  Thanks for such a great time working together on this play. I can't wait to perform with you.  Those of you reading this who might be interested in seeing the play, please check out the  urlLink FRWY  website for dates and times.  I emailed invitations to a bunch of people, but only a couple have responded with yeas or nays.  So I have no idea home many people are coming.  I hope a lot.  It's a really powerful story.

      We have been suffering with a slow, old computer for some time (Pentium 150 mhz, 24 MB RAM) for what seems like forever.  Hard to believe that old thing cost me like $3000 7 years ago.    So I was out for lunch with a couple of guys from  urlLink work  on Friday and I got complaining about it. I toldlthem that I'm thinking of buying a used one because I don't really want to spend that much (for a new one) and even a used one would be a serious upgrade over what I'm using. The one guy, Wil, says, "I have an old computer sitting in the garage.  Want it?"  I said sure!  Wil's such a great guy.  We've been working together for ten years now and really get along well.  A few years ago he and I spent 2 straight weeks together on a business trip to Asia (5 countries in 14 days).  We sure got to know each other well then!   Anyway, a little later that afternoon I asked him what he wanted for it (I felt I should at least pay something.)  He said he didn't know, didn't want to put a price on it, that I should just do what I can.  We went to his house after work and I picked it up.  I brought it home and fired it up.  This thing (I working on it now) is a Pentium II 350 mhz with  192 MB RAM.   Needless to say, it is a  huge  upgrade.  Oh yeah, it has a 56K modem.  The old thing was a 28K.  Had to work out a bunch of "bugs", but it seems to be working fine now.  I'm so grateful!  The only thing is, I need to determine what is a fair price and how much can I afford?

      I took the boys to see  urlLink Shrek 2  on Friday.  Generally, I thought the movie was really well done and I echo the opinion that this movie was better than the original.  The spoofs of nursery rhymes and other Disney characters were particularly funny.  However, there are some things about the movie that troubled me.  I don't understand why these movie directors/writers/producers feel the need to include sexual content in animated films that are clearly marketed to children.  There is so much Shrek 2 merchandise out there that it is ridiculous.  I heard the words sex or sexy at least a couple times in the movie.  In one scene the "new and improved" Shrek is all but jumped by three sex starved sisters.    In one scene, it is revealed that Pinnochio wears womens' underwear. And it goes beyond that. The gingerbread man pulls the band, snaps it against his butt and declares "He's wearing a thong!"  Is this really necessary??  The donkey is referred to as Ass once.  Of course, calling a donkey an ass is not incorrect.  However, I don't really want my five year old, or my 8 eight year old for that matter, to be running around and repeating it.  It was quite funny, but tainted for me.

      Has it really been a week since I last posted?  Time is at a bit of a premium lately.  I have a couple things to blog about, but not tonight.  It's gotten too late and I still did not achieve everything I wanted to tonight.  Hopefully tomorrow.  Thanks to all you faithful blog readers.  My counter keeps ticking upwards, despite my sporadic posting.  Not as sporadic as  urlLink Mark  though.    For those of you you can't seem to get enough, and thus are disappointed when you check in here, I suggest you read  urlLink Dave's  blog (if you don't do so already).  It's always quite entertaining.

      For those of you who don't know, we rent a two bedroom apartment in an old house that has been converted to an triplex.  In the last two months, both the other apartments have been vacated.  This is always a little stressful for us because usually when new tenants move in, there are some sort of hassles to deal with.  And there's always a fear that the apartments will be rented to young, partying, dope smoking, bad attitude people.  On May 7, a week after it was vacated, the third floor was rented to Perry.  Perry seems really nice.  We've learned that he is a coach with the Toronto Argps.  We're not holding that against him.  Tonight he gave our boys a nice new Wilson football.  Very cool.  And...Apartment 2 has been rented to friends of ours!!   urlLink Chris  & Donna Celeste, friends of ours from the  urlLink FRWY , have rented the apartment above us.  It's going to be great.  Welcome Chris & Donna!

      My son Derek has  "big" oral book presentation tomorrow.  I stayed home from floor hockey tonight to help him out.  He chose to report on this book:   urlLink     He has been working for two whole evenings on a cool plasticine model which includes a piece of cardboard covered in green plasticine for grass and an plasticine boy (Jigsaw Jones) and a plasticine dog (Rags).  Good thing Cindy is creative and artistic, 'cause I could not have helped Derek come up with anything nearly as good.  As they were working on the model tonight, I was skimming the book and making notes so I could quiz Derek about what he wanted to talk about.  It was amazing how much he remembered and comprehended!  It made it much easier to help him orgainize what he wanted to say.  I think he will do an excellent job tomorrow.

      Remember those cheesy "Where's the beef?" commercials.    I know, I know. Haven't blogged in days.  Not gonna get much from my tonight either.  It's almost 11:00 and I really should be trying to wind it down soon.  It's been a crazy busy weekend: Friends over Friday, Biking with the kids Saturday morning, Jordan's karate, family dinner at Mom's Sat aft/night, biking with the wife and kids this morning, big hockey game at the school yard this afternoon, Cousin Rick and family over for a while this afternoon, and then  urlLink church .  Good weekend though.  Biggest thing lately is that Cindy and I got bikes last week.  Can't afford it, but we've been saying that for years.  So we finally said nuts to it, found the cheapest, decent bikes we could find and bought them.  Really enjoying riding with the kids.  It's great.  So, I'll see about blogging a little more this week.  Definitely want to make some changes to the look of this thing.  Stay tuned.

      Wow.   urlLink Google's  IPO hasn't even been done yet, and there are big changes at Blogger (Google owns Blogger, if you didn't know.)  Lot's of new templates, Blogger's own commenting, better user interface.  I like it.  Really like how  urlLink Chris'  site.  I think I'll make some changes too.  I really like the addition of the comments, though I'd really hate to lose the comments that are already on my blog.  We'll see.  Later.

      Today I was bouncing around downtown  urlLink Toronto  because I had four meetings.  The third meeting was on Queen Street West, near Dufferin.  I parked the car, got out to feed the meter.  As I got out of the car, I noticed a great little cafe.  The name?   urlLink Beaver Cafe.   :-D  Cool.

         Some might say that there are much bigger concerns in life than the price of gas; that there are other people much worse off.   While that is true, the increase in the price of gas really sucks for me.  In the last couple months, the price of gas has gone from about $0.65 to $0.90 a litre.  When you're dumping 400 litres a month into your car...well do the math.  Try and find $100 in your monthly budget.

      Thought this might be kind of fun.  Once a week, I'm going to go over to my CD collection and, without looking, randomly pick out 5 CD's and let you know what they are.  You'll get a glimpse into what kind of tunes I've liked now and then.  Some of them won't even necessarily be bands I like.  I used to disc jockey weddings and parties, etc. and some of the CD's were bought just for that purpose.  Some are Cindy's (eeewww!) I'll points these out as we go.  Won't tak the time to link or get pictures from the 'net.  Just a list.  This week's list:  Boston - Boston (More Than a Feeling, Peace of Mind, Foreplay/Longtime etc) Rod Stewart - If We Fall In Love Tonight (So Far Away, My Heart Can't Tell You No) The Guess Who - The Best of.. (These Eyes, American Woman, Share The Land...) Hootie & The Blowfish - Cracked Rear View (Hold My Hand, Let Her Cry, Only Wanna Be With You) The Tragically Hip - Music @ Work (My Nusic @ Work, Lake Fever)  Later.

      I learned this afternoon that my Aunt Marlene, my mom's eldest sister, is dying of cancer.  Didn't really impact me that much because my mom and aunt have never really been that close.  At least not as long as I can remember.  I couldn't even tell you the last time I saw her.    Funny thing; my mom's family.  11 kids.  At some point during my lifetime, virtually every one of them have not been on speaking terms with one of their siblings at one time or another.  My mom and aunt just drifted apart over the years, probably for a number of reasons.  But there was my mom today in tears as she was telling Cindy and I about it.   This raises some questions for me.  For example, my dad and I have not spoken for eight years.  And I wonder, if I found out tomorrow that he was dying of cancer, would I be in tears?  As I type this, I'm unable to stir up that emotion in myself.  How is it that my mom can?  Maybe growing up together in a brutal, abusive childhood on the farm they experienced at the hands of their father, created a life long, deep rooted emotion for my mom. Maybe my mom is just a much more compassionate person than I am. I don't know.   So in two weeks my mom is hosting a huge family meal. My aunt Marlene will be there. Her son Rick is going to drive in from Napanee for it. Some of my mom's other siblings will be there. And as I am finishing this thought, I am envisioning how emotional that day could be. It always gets me when my mom cries. Could be a tough day.   Another question. What does the future hold for me? My mom's oldest brother, Glen, died 11 years ago of cancer. He was probably in his mid to late 50's. My mom is 52. That make Aunt Marlene probably 62 or 63. Now she has cancer. Neither Glen or Marlene were smokers. My mom is a heavy smoker. Will she get cancer? Will I get cancer someday? Four of my mom's brothers have had heart attacks with my Uncle Keith dying of a massive heart attack at 51 years old. Will I have a heart attack?   My biggest fear is how my wife and kids would be without me. Not becasue I think they need me for survival. But if they love me even half of how much I love them, it would be very tough emotionally for them. I don't know how I could survive if I ever lost one of them. Amy's latest entry pretty much sums up the fears us parents endure.   Above all, I believe in God's plan for my life, and trust in Him. It's this faith that gives me peace.

      On Saturday morning, the family and I went canoeing in  urlLink Cootes Paradise . We had just launched off of Princess Point when we saw a big  urlLink Great Blue Heron  standing in the water to the left of us.  It took off, flew around behind us and all the way down the east side of Cootes.  I love the way he flew just above the water with his wing tips almost touching the water as he flew.  It was quite windy early Saturday morning and the kids were getting a little freaked out, so we turned around and decided to try canoeing down the little strip of water that is right in between the 403 and Macklin Road.  Have you ever noticed it?  It goes all the way from Cootes to about Main Street.  As we were paddliong, we noticed a large bird (not sure what kind) sitting in a tree near the water with a fish in its beak.  We stopped at a giant cement culvert.  It was wide open and we could have paddled in but it was dark and we had the kids with us, so we didn't.  As I checking out websites about Cootes tonight when I was writing this entry, I learned that this little strip of water is actually called Chedoke Creek.  What is really interesting is that Chedoke Creek actually is above the escarpment also and feeds like  urlLink six seperate waterfalls  over the Escarpment behind Chedoke golf course, through underground drains and into Cootes Paradise.  When I worked at Chedoke Golf Course as a student, I always wondered where that water went.  Now I know.

      So I'm flipping back and forth tonight between the  urlLink basketball  and the  urlLink baseball  game.  I gotta tell ya, as a purely heterosexual male, ABC's floor cam used in the basketball game is truly horrifying...

      I need to complain about  urlLink work  a little....just a little I promise.  I should be in Chicago right now for the biggest tradeshow of the year:   urlLink Neocon .  But I'm not.  That sucks.  Here's the deal.  Our company has 3 sales people:  Me (Canada), Greg (Vice-Pres & U.S.) and Sylvanna (International).  So Tony (our owner and president), Greg and Sylvanna are in Chicago.  I'm the odd man out. Whatever...

      One of the questions most often asked at church is "How was your week?"  For the past 5 or 6 weeks my wife and I have been getting together on Wednesday nights with Dallas Friesen and Ian MacLennan.  Inevitably, this same question is asked every week.  I've come to realize that I hardly ever have an interesting answer to this question.  The same old "It was good...not much new...same old, same old"  Is my life really that mundane?  I guess it is pretty routine.  And with the exception of  urlLink work , I enjoy most of my day-to-day life.  Just wish I could be more creative with my answers.  This reminds me of a message I heard from Erwin Raphael McManus, pastor of a church in LA called  urlLink Mosaic .  His message was about "Living Dangerously" for God.  I'll have to dig out the tape I bought of that message.  It's really, really good.  Maybe it'll inspire me to not be such a boring Beaver.

      Had a great bike ride tonight.  Yeah, I know.  Exciting stuff.  Rode from my place up to the  urlLink Radial Trail  entrance on Dundurn at the foot of the escarpment and rode along the trail up to the Meadowlands in Ancaster.  Pretty cool trail.  And near the top there's a bunch of trails that run off the main trail.  I'd love to check them out sometime.

      So last week was my vacation.&nbsp; And a week was definitely too short.&nbsp; I think the perfect vacation is minimum two weeks so that you can go away for the first week and then stay home and chill for the second.&nbsp; Going away always involves so much work.&nbsp; Especially when you're going camping.&nbsp; It takes a long time to pull out all the gear and then pack it into the car.&nbsp; And I'll tell you, when you're packing gear, clothes, food, etc for four people into a Malibu, you have to be methodical about it.   We left on Tuesday morning, but before we left I had to do some work on the car.&nbsp; I have been hearing a nasty creaking sound coming out of the driver's side front brake.&nbsp; So on Monday I pulled the front wheels off, dismantled the calipers to lubricate them.&nbsp; While I was at it, I adjusted the rear drum brakes and rotated the tires.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;I spent most of Monday afternoon working on the car. Not exactly a restful part of the vacation, if you know what I mean.&nbsp;   After finishing the brakes, I started&nbsp;stuffing into the car&nbsp;all the gear and clothes that Cindy and I had been pulling together all weekend.&nbsp; This left me with the cooler, canoe, bikes and othe misc. items for Tuesday morning.&nbsp; I had hoped to be on the road by 9 am but didn't get going until 10.&nbsp; After, almost 5 hours of travel (including stops at Tim's, Gas, the Town of Tweed for the propane bottles I forgot and fishing licences, we arrived at our destination:  urlLink Bon Echo Provincial Park.  (BTW, didn't see Elvis in Tweed).  I gotta say.&nbsp; The Park is fantastic.&nbsp; Our site had great privacy.&nbsp; The kids shows on bats (Tues night) and frogs (Wed night) were teriffic.&nbsp;The park chaplain had a great kids' programme Thursday morning.&nbsp;There is a 375 foot high rock face directly across the lake from the park is absolutely beautiful. (Check out the picture on the above link.).&nbsp; There are trails and hiking to the top of the rock face, but we didn't get up there.  The mosquitos, however, were plentiful and they were hungry!&nbsp; And the Deet just was not doing the job.&nbsp; Our poor kids came home looking like they had the chicken pox or something.  The other downer was all the rain.&nbsp; It rained off and on all week.&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't even get on my bike the whole trip.&nbsp;We woke up every morning to rain and the kids ate breakfast in the car each morning.&nbsp; We waited two full days before attempting to go canoeing.&nbsp; Sure enough, we weren't in the water 10 minutes when it started thundering and raining.&nbsp; So we went to shore and the kids swan in the lake in the rain.&nbsp; Then the skies cleared and we wre able to paddle over to that rock face and check out the native pictographs, etc.&nbsp; So, at least we were able to get in a good paddle on our trip.  Friday morning we had to pack up wet gear, drive home, waste an hour in Toronto traffic, set up the tent to clean it, pack away gear and do a ton of laundry, clean a filthy car.....and so on.  All in all, it was a good trip, great to spend time with the family.&nbsp; The kids were really great.&nbsp; I just wish I had that second week at home to just chill.    All for now.&nbsp; Peace.

      Well, I'm back after a week's vacation.&nbsp; Don't have much time to blog about our camping trip right now.&nbsp; What I will tell you is that we met many of those "friends" pictured below.&nbsp; In fact, the Baker Family entertained&nbsp;probably 100 or more of them over for dinner...  &nbsp;

         The new  urlLink Tragically Hip  CD came in the mail today.  Many thanks to  urlLink Chris  and  urlLink Donna  Celeste for the birthday present.  Haven't even opened the wrapper yet, so I can't offer you a review.  I have added it to my "This Week's Car Tunes" list.  I'll let you know what I think.

      Just finished watching the first episode of  urlLink The Amazing Race 5 .  I am not a Reality Show junkie, but I really like this one,  And the first episode did not disappoint. It was fast paced with many twists, turns, and lead changes.  I think the rest of the race is going to be fantastic as the remaining teams traverse the globe in an effort to win the grand prize of a cool one million bills.  A guy at work has organized an Amazing Race pool.  The team I drew is  urlLink Brandon & Nicole , which is pretty cool as I discovered watching the episode tonight these two are Christians.  I was kinda impressed with some of the things they had to say during this leg of the race.  Their bio on the website says that their relationship is "God-centred."  Another bit of good news, they were not eliminated tonight, so I'm still in the running for the pool.

      I received this via email today and thought they were funny.  Things that, without movies, we would not know:  -It is always possible to park directly outside any building you are visiting.   -A detective can only solve a case once he has been suspended from duty.   -If you decide to start dancing in the street, everyone you bump into will know all the steps.   -Most laptop computers are powerful enough to override the communication systems of any  invading alien civilization.   -It does not matter if you are heavily outnumbered in a fight involving martial arts - your enemies will wait patiently to attack you one by one by dancing around in a threatening manner until you have knocked out their predecessors.   -When a person is knocked unconscious by a blow to the head, they will never suffer a  concussion or brain damage.  -No one involved in a car chase, hijacking, explosion, volcanic eruption or alien invasion will ever go into shock.  -Police Departments give their officers personality tests to make sure they are deliberately assigned a partner who is their total opposite.   -When they are alone, all foreigners prefer to speak English to each other.   -You can always find a chainsaw when you need one.   -Any lock can be picked by a credit card or a paper clip in seconds, unless it's the door to a burning building with a child trapped inside.   -An electric fence, powerful enough to kill a dinosaur will cause no lasting damage to an eight year old child.   -Television news bulletins usually contain a story that affects you personally at that precise moment you turn the television on.

      I was sitting here at my computer tonight when I heard some thunder roll outside. I was a little surprised because it was such a beautiful day today, with no sign of rain. For some reason tonight, after hearing that thunder, I  had  to go out side. It was almost as if God was saying, "Come, listen to me. Hear my power."  I love thunderstorms. Ever since I was a kid, I've loved thunderstorms. I love the light show that lightening provides. I marvel at how loud thunder can get as the storm gets closer and closer. I love the sheets of rain that pour out of the sky. The sound of that rain pelting the roofs, the pavement, the puddles that the rain already created, the sound of the rain in the eavestroughs, draining down the pipes. I love it all.  I can remember as a teenager just sitting in my bedroom with the widow open watching and listening to the t-storms for what seemed like hours.  I remember once, when I was a young kid, visiting friends of the family. They lived on Balsam Ave., near Gage Park in an old house with a large covered veranda, much like the house I live in now. I remember thinking how cool it was to sit outside during a storm. To be so close to it. To hear it better than you do inside the house. Yet I was still sheltered; not getting wet. That was the beginning of my fascination. And to this day, I still like to just go outside, and enjoy a good thunderstorm. For some reason, it gives me peace. A kind of meditation. And the feeling has grown further since I found God almost 5 years ago. And I sensed Him tonight. I prayed to Him. And as fast as the storm came, it went again. And I had to come in and get this out of my head and into the computer...

      I live in  urlLink Hamilton . The Steel City. The Hammer. The so-called Arm Pit of Canada. Well, maybe it is. Why do I love this city so much? My wife and I were out tonight  sans  the chillin's. After  urlLink church , we drove to Van Wagner's beach and got some fish and chips at Hutch's. Mmmmm...Hutch's. We went for a short walk along the beach trail there. Then we drove up the "Mountain", grabbed a coffee at  urlLink Tim's , and went to  urlLink Sam Lawrence Park . I enjoy so much sitting on the stone wall, sipping coffee and looking out over the lights of the city at night. Tonight was no different. And what a beautiful night it was, although a little cool for August 1. Then we strode along the paths through the flower gardens. Pleasant enough to allow your mind to filter out the noise of the traffic on the adjacent Jolley Cut.  There's certainly more to this City that what I just wrote about. As much as there is industry and poverty in some parts of the city, there's just as many green spaces and pleasant neighbourhoods. And the city is nostalgic to me. Lot's of old buildings, old houses, large trees that are probably hundreds of years old. The city seems to be jsut large enough to be a "big" city but also has many "small" city charateristics.  Athough not an expert,  urlLink Hamilton History  is a bit of a interest and hobby for me. I have two great books on the history of Hamilton. One is called   urlLink Hamilton: A Panorama of Our Past   and  urlLink  Hamilton: A People's History   .   Great books.  Especially the Panorama one.  I find it so interesting to see old pictures (and some  really  old pictures) of this City and compare them to present day.  I love it.   My "Niagara" outpouring is peetering (sp?) out.  I'll have to try to pick this up again some time tomorrow.   Peace.

      I know that some of my regular visitors know about  urlLink Bloglines .  For those of you who do not know, let me enlighten you.  Before I discovered this great website, I used to go to the trouble of visiting each of my friends' blogs individually to see if anything new had been posted.  Bloglines has a cool little free service where it monitors each of the blogs you enter in (ie subscribe to).  In other words, I can go to the "My Feeds" section of the Bloglines website and at a single glance see which of my favorite blogs have new posts.  Again, it's free.  Try it out!

      There's so much I want to post about, just haven't had the time, or been motivated, to post.  Blogging tends by an ebb and flow kinda thing for me.  Okay, more like a desert to Niagara Falls kinda thing.  Feast or famine.  Anyway...I maybe on the precipice of multiple posts.  Let's see what I can get out of this cranium of mine...
