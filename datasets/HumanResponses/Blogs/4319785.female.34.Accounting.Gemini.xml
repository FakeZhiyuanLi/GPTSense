      For the brine:   1 bottle Fruit2O, lemon flavor couple tbls soy sauce dried onion flakes chopped garlic lemon pepper seasoning black pepper salt couple shakes of Tabasco  I just eyeball this.  Put the chicken wings, about a dozen, split into drums and flats into a ziploc bag.  Pour in the Lemon water, add the seasonings.  Zip to close.  Shake well.  Pop in a bowl (in case it leaks) and set in fridge for about hour.  Drain off brine and continue with chosen cooking process.  I tend to coat and bake mine.  Brining makes the chicken juicier, more tender and it just has a better flavor all around.  It doesn't take much time or effort, and the Fruit2O already has the sweetner dissolved into it, so you can add just about anything.  I have found that the options listed above work pretty good.  Like garlic a lot?  Add more.  Omit the onion if you don't like it.  Leave out the lemon pepper, substitute it for something else.  You really can't leave out the soy though, that's pretty important for the salt.  I wouldn't leave wings in this longer than 2 hours.  You can certainly increase the amount and brine larger things, like that turkey breast I have thawing in the fridge, it's getting this treatment come Wednesday night.

      Today I prepare for a colonoscopy and an endoscopy. Which means tomorrow morning, I will (hopefully) be knocked silly by really good drugs and be probed from both ends. The prep for such an event, is not pretty,  First, don't eat anything during the day. That means, breakfast consists of a Tropicana (tm)  Some Pulp Orange Juice and a Diet Dew. Lunch with your spouse is a cup of coffee, no cream! And a glass of ice tea, with lemon. Eyeball her cottage cheese and mentally smack yourself. Then cave in on the way back to work and pick up some Jell-o (tm) snack packs, lime and orange. Consume 4 snack packs in 10 minutes (give the orange one's to your mom). Sigh. Listen to your stomach complain, tell it it doesn't know how good it has it right now.  Come home from work and proceed to work with food, knowing full well that you can't have any of it. Proceed to take the tips off of 7 lbs. of chicken wings, freeze this for future broth makings. Split wings into drummets and flats and then pop them into a bag for a quick brining. You're already ahead of the game, cause you made up a big batch of wing coating the night before, go you! Let the wings sit for an hour in the brine and watch some Olympics (synchronized swimmers). Melt butter, coat wings and put in the oven. And now the really fun part begins.  Start to consume, as quickly as possible the most disgusting, foul, nasty tasting water you have ever had. The cute medical name for this hideous drink? GoLytely. Yeah, I am not amused, and I bet Holly wouldn't be either. Suck this back as fast as you can, gasp for breath between gulps. Quickly suck on a Lifesaver to kill the taste. Repeat, ad nauseum, literally. Bleargh. I am not one to gag in general, but this stuff makes me start making noises that even the cats look at me funny for. And then my wife looks at me all sad and says that she would drink this for me if she could. But hey, she promised to do the "Poop Clear Cheer" for me later on, so wheee! I got that working for me.  And now my guts are roiling, and the house smells like tasty chicken wings and I can't have any. I can't have anything other than another tasty, lip smacking glass of GoLytely (yum!) and a mint. And a cigarette. Can I say that my mouth tastes so, so very nasty? It does. So not letting my wife kiss me anytime soon. Churn, bubble, the insides do not like this concoction that has been forced on them, and quite frankly, neither do I. This sucks. There's just no way around how sucky this is. And this isn't the first time I've had to do it either. In fact, I think this is my 3rd, or 4th time. I've been lucky and not had to go under the scope since my surgery in 1997, so, cross fingers, everything will look good tomorrow.  I'm waiting for my body to stop doing what it's doing so I can take a shower. The hospital always wants you to be clean when you show up, even if you can't use deodorant (I don't understand it either). I guess it's in case they perforate me somewhere and have to wheel me off to surgery, they don't want me going in a "smelling like a fresh breeze" or something.  After the event takes place, I've been admonished that I must have a responsible driver there, because I will NOT BE ALLOWED TO DRIVE. I also shouldn't smoke by myself or plan on signing any legal documents tomorrow, while I'm under the influence of these drugs. Fun fun. I can only assume I will go home with both my kidney's intact.  The extra fun part of it all? It's a brand new doctor. One I have only seen once before, and that was just a "hi, I hear you're really good with Crohn's Disease and I happen to have that and I didn't like my old doc to much so how bout we form a search party and go investigate my colon, okay?" Always fun to start a new relationship off naked in a butt flapping gown with someone you hardly knows finger up your butt. Sigh.  Hopefully, all goes well and I can sleep through it all and stumble after my spouse and finally get something to eat. But not before the "Poop Clear Cheer!".
