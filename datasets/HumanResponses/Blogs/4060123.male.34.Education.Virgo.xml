						   Well last night my brother and I went shooting at TargetMaster. Spent 108.00 in lane fees and ammo Just to shoot for a half hour before they called last call. Let me tell you the guy that works behind the counter is a real a**hole.&nbsp;I only got to shoot through 2 boxes of ammo and my brother only one box &nbsp;before they told us the lanes were closed. I think the next time we decide to go we will be leaving earlier.  &nbsp;Oh and Fran just to help you realize what my web site is about... So far its about my love for Muscle cars... it will be changing when I think of better things to put up!

						   Its Thursday August 19 2004 about 7:00 AM started the next room in my remodel yesterday I got pretty far, the walls are built 4 sheets of drywall are already installed. The project will be done in time. Talk to ya later. M       Here is more on the robbery:     FOLCROFT -- Police are circulating surveillance photos of one of two suspects in Wednesday’s robbery at the Wachovia Bank. Though the face is covered, investigators are hoping that someone might recognize the body features and/or stance of the person seen holding onto the arm of the bank manager during the fast-paced crime . Witnesses described two women as the culprits -- similar to suspects in the robbery of the Commerce Bank in Brookhaven a week ago today. Cpl. Robert Ruskowski and Officer Christopher Eiserman are leading the probe in the Wachovia heist, which was reported about 12:45 p.m. Tuesday at the branch on Delmar Drive. The women’s faces were partially covered when they entered the bank. Both headed toward a separate teller and verbally demanded cash.They implied having a weapon by the way they hid their hand in the clothing, police said, but no weapon was displayed. At one point, one of the women pushed one of the bank employees, but there were no physical injuries.According to police, the women left the bank cupping money in their hands. They fled in a white car, which sped down a rear alley behind an adjacent strip mall. The alley ends at Grant Road.Meanwhile, Brookhaven is continuing an investigation into a robbery last week in which two women in wigs and sunglasses robbed the Commerce Bank on Edgmont Avenue. No weapon was displayed or implied in that case, according to Officer Rick Fuller. And in Radnor, authorities are investigating a possible link into what they described as "a suspicious circumstance" at a Fleet Bank Monday afternoon. A woman in a wig entered the bank and inquired about opening an account. When she was pushed to present proper identification, she left.An alert teller had read about the robbery in Brookhaven in the Daily Times and contacted authorities based on similarities in behavior and appearance, according to Radnor Sgt. Sue Cory. Anyone with information is asked to call Folcroft Police at (610) 522-1300.

						   Well its Wednesday August 18, 2004 about 8:00 AM. well only a week and a half till I go on vacation and I cant wait! I am almost done the remodel work and it should be done in time. Ive been working on these damn rooms too long. I think Iam getting burnt out. Hopefully it will get done before I go on vacation. I still havent got my brothers web site together. at  urlLink www.DunlapRoofing.net  . You can check out my buddy Frans web site at :  urlLink www.TotallyDelco.com  its just been "remodeled" its pretty cool. I just heard the Bank in Folcroft got robbed last night, My town is going to shit. here is the story :    Thelma and Louise: Two women sought in another bank heist    The hunt is on for two women whom authorities suspect have robbed at least two banks - including the Wachovia Bank in Folcroft, where they made off with literally handfuls of cash Tuesday afternoon. Authorities suspect the pair is connected to a heist at a Commerce Bank in Brookhaven last Thursday. Additionally, police in Radnor are investigating a possible link to what Sgt. Sue Cory called "a suspicious circumstance" at a Fleet Bank Monday afternoon. According to Folcroft Police Cpl. Robert Ruskowski, two women entered the Wachovia branch on Delmar Drive about 12:45 p.m. Tuesday. Their faces were partially covered as they each approached a separate teller and verbally demanded cash."They implied they had a weapon by the way they held their hands in their pocket," said Ruskowski, who is leading the investigation with Officer Christopher Eiserman.They didn't wait long enough to place the undetermined amount of cash in a bag. They left cupping the cash in their hands, he said.The bank building was immediately secured with yellow tape and a note was taped to the front door stating that the facility was temporarily closed.There were no customers in the bank at the time of the robbery, only five bank employees. Brookhaven police arrived at the bank within a short period of time, as did a number of federal agents. The Commerce Bank on Edgmont Avenue in Brookhaven was robbed shortly after 7 p.m. last Thursday. The suspects were then described as two females wearing wigs and sunglasses. There was no weapon displayed or implied in that case.Brookhaven Officer Rick Fuller was on the scene in Folcroft, along with Investigator Randolph McGoldrick. From what information they had obtained, Fuller said he suspected an ongoing spree."We think they are the same women," he said. Police at the scene said an incident in Radnor might also be connected. Sgt. Cory credited an alert Fleet Bank teller for making required notifications during a transaction with a female customer wearing a wig about noon Monday. The woman said she wanted to open an account at the Rosemont branch - similar to the method of operation in the Brookhaven case. Cory said the teller had read about the Brookhaven robbery in the Daily Times. Though no crime was committed, Cory said an investigation is under way because of the similarities.The woman entered the Fleet Bank alone, though it appeared she arrived at the bank in a car with two other females and a male driver, according to Cory.A woman arriving at the Wachovia in Folcroft on a motorized scooter was obviously distraught. Ignoring the crowd-control tape, she walked up to the door and began knocking. "My sister just called me. She was personally robbed," she said.Police presence drew a small crowd of children from the area. A few late-afternoon customers were turned away, encouraged by the note on the door to do their banking at the closest branch in Sharon Hill. A woman whose family runs a nearby restaurant said she saw a white car pass quickly by the rear of her property. The car was traveling so fast it scared her, said the woman, who asked to remain anonymous.The restaurant is one of several businesses in a strip located next to the bank. An alley behind the strip mall empties onto Grant Road. Authorities had no statistics readily available, but many were at a loss to remember a bank robbery involving females. "I've been a police officer for 35 years and it's a first for me," said Fuller.Likewise, Cory characterized it as uncommon, historically. "It's unusual for women to be involved in high-end crimes," she said, "but times have changed."Police are asking anyone who may have seen or heard anything to call Folcroft police at (610) 522-1300.

						   FOLCROFT -- Concerned about illegal video and/or audio taping-recording equipment that might compromise potential future prosecution, police opted to conduct all interviews involving Wednesday’s homicide at nearby Darby Township police headquarters. Folcroft Police Chief Ed Christie said as many as 30 law enforcement officers from surrounding areas assisted in the probe that resulted in the swift arrest of 57-year-old Vernon Lawton of Philadelphia. Charged with first-degree murder and related offenses, Lawton is accused of gunning down his wife’s apparent lover outside a borough tavern. Victim Michael O’Brien, 44, of Ardmore, formerly of Folcroft, died in an ambulance of multiple gunshot wounds while being transported to a hospital. "The officers decided" to move interviews to Darby Township, said Christie, adding that he did not object to the reasoning. "They felt (Folcroft police headquarters) was not the proper facility to interview" several people at once, including murder suspect Lawton."This was a serious crime," said Christie. We moved things to Darby Township" without any added concern of lapses in certain expectations of privacy.In May, county investigators confiscated video equipment and about a dozen videotapes from the borough municipal building, which houses both district court and police headquarters.Christie and other officers began to hear rumors of surveillance in the borough building two years ago. The chief met with county authorities in the spring and two detectives subsequently combed the building for illegal devices. Christie also hired a private investigator to sweep the police department for bugs. In a prepared statement later, Borough Manager Anthony Truscello said he and Public Safety Chairman Joseph Zito and his committee installed three surveillance cameras because of complaints they received about police officers sleeping on the night shift.Christie previously called the explanation "baloney." Any concerns brought to Christie’s attention were always handled quickly, he said. The chief knew of only one incident regarding an officer sleeping on the night shift and he resigned."The problem was brought to our attention and corrected," he said.Even without the concern for privacy, Christie said there was a sheer matter of space to accommodate all the necessary interviews that were conducted Wednesday night. Police lost about a third of their space about a month ago, he said. The decision by borough officials was made to accommodate analternative school, slated for opening in September.There is no conference area and the chief’s office is doubling as an evidence room,’’ he noted.

						   FOLCROFT -- A jealous husband pumped numerous bullets into his wife’s lover outside a local bar Wednesday night as she watched in horror, police said. Vernon Lawton, 57, of the 200 block of East Mermaid Lane, Philadelphia, who police said is a securities analyst for the Federal Reserve Bank in Philadelphia, is behind bars, without bail, charged with first- and third-degree murder. He is accused of shooting former borough resident Michael O’Brien as he stood outside of the Delmar Tavern.  "I just lost my best friend," said a distraught man who identified himself as O’Brien’s brother Thursday morning. He declined to give his name and requested privacy for his family.According to police, O’Brien, 44, who lived in Ardmore, had been having an affair with Lawton’s wife, June Lawton, 49, for about one year. A painter, O’Brien previously lived around the corner from the bar.The Lawtons had lived in Folcroft, but recently moved to the Chestnut Hill section of Philadelphia, police said.Lawton apparently tracked down his wife and O’Brien and confronted them in the bar at 2012 Delmar Drive at about 7:51 p.m., according to authorities.June Lawton and O’Brien had been to several bars earlier in the evening, police said. They had just arrived at Delmar Tavern and had ordered drinks when Lawton walked in, according to police.Lawton ordered his wife to leave. He and O’Brien exchanged words, and Lawton allegedly told O’Brien to step outside, police said.As June Lawton left the bar with her husband, O’Brien followed. As the door closed behind him, bar patrons told police they heard five or six shots. There was a pause, then two more shots were fired, police said.Hearing gunfire, bar patrons ran outside. They saw the fatally wounded O’Brien on the ground and Lawton jumping into a black SUV. O’Brien was transported to Crozer-Chester Medical Center. He was pronounced dead by trauma surgeon Dr. Steven Fukuchi at 8:33 p.m. He died of numerous gunshot wounds to the chest, abdomen and head, according to the affidavit of probable cause. Officer Chris Eiserman, who was only blocks away when the shots were fired, arrived at the bar moments later. "My husband shot him," June Lawton allegedly told the officer.Witnesses told Eiserman that Lawton was driving westbound on Delmar Drive toward Norwood and he broadcast that information over police radio.About five minutes later, County Detective Adam Sendek spotted the SUV turning onto Route 420 from Chester Pike. When Lawton turned onto southbound I-95, several officers gave chase.Lawton spotted police and accelerated, driving at a high rate of speed, according to police. Eddystone Officer Edmund Kienzle and Ridley Park Officer John Morris stopped him at the Blue Route entrance.As he was ordered out of the vehicle, Lawton identified himself as Vernon Lawton, police said. When asked where he was coming from, he allegedly replied, "Folcroft, the bar, I just shot a guy in the bar."On the front seat of his SUV, sticking out of a bag, was a Walther .380 automatic pistol, according to the affidavit. The magazine, which holds eight bullets, was empty. Lawton does not have a license to carry a gun, police said.Lawton was taken into custody without incident. Don Caso, owner of the Delmar Tavern, said O’Brien was a regular. "He was a painter and traveled a lot," he said. "But he hasn’t been in here for about five months.""He was a nice guy, very quiet, a regular in here," said Danyelle Winter, a former bar employee. District Justice Steven Sandone arraigned Lawton at 4:30 a.m. in Darby Township. In addition to first- and third-degree murder, he is charged with simple and aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, firearms not to be carried without a license and possessing an instrument of crime.O’Brien’s murder marks the first homicide in Folcroft in at least a decade. It is the county’s 14th murder this year. A spokeswoman for the Federal Reserve Bank refused to confirm whether or not Lawton was an employee. Eiserman and county detective Michael Palmer are the lead investigators

						   Police Chase Suspect In Fatal Shooting  Love Triangle Leads To Shooting Outside Tavern  FOLCROFT, Pa. -- A fatal shooting at a Delaware County prompted a high-speed police chase. Police say the incident began because of a lover's triangle. A woman's husband apparently showed up at the Delmar Tavern and found her inside with another man. Witnesses inside the tavern said the husband came in and called for his wife to come out. The man with her went outside with her, which is when gunshots rang out. The gunman sped away in his vehicle, but police from all over Delaware County swarmed in and eventually arrested him on the Blue Route. The victim, Mike O'Brien, was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Police said they were questioning the gunman Wednesday night and expected to charge him with murder.

						   Today is Sunday, Last Night went back to TargetMaster again this time spending $245.00 between My buddy Tom, Cousin Chris and my brother Bob. We had a blast last night though. we bought a case of 40 cal. bullets. We had lanes next to a older police officer. he was shooting a Smith & Wesson 500 (50 cal.) handgun. Man that is a hell of a handgun, not to mention the loud explosion every time he fired it. that gun made it hard for me to aim (it actualy gave me a headache) the guy offer me a chance to fire it but by then my head was killing me, so I went into the lobby. He also offer my brother and cousin a chance and they took him up on the offer. they told me it had one hell of a kick. I was going to rent the same gun from TargetMaster but at $10.00 for the gun and $44.00 for a 20 box of bullets the price is a little steep. Maybe the guy will be there next time and I'll get a chance to fire it. Oh Fran if your having a problem with your roof check out my home page. (yeah I know my brother wanted to kill me for doing that to him. but really he is one hell of a roofer.) I'll tell him to cut you a break.
