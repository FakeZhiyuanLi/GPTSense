      Text Message from Mike:     I'm a practical guy 4 a neurotic hottie who didn't have such a good day and I'm determined to end it well 4 her      (his response to my   Can't I have a bad day and vent about it without your bullshit theories and 'power of motivation' speeches?? Why do you have to be so friggin practical?! )  Maybe he is worth keeping around for a little while longer...

I can't even describe all the things that went wrong today.  I hate my boss. Hate her. Hate her. HATE her.

      My Ouija Board told me in order to get rid of my Boy Bad Kharma I need to "act like a lady".  Apparently that means quit whoring around!!  It also said I'm going to marry Bill... and the very next day I was driving along with my sister and this song came on and it goes somethin like this:   Bill - I love you and I always will... something something something.. won't you marry me Bill... won't you marry me Bill... I love you and I always wil....   Now, how friggin wierd is that?!?

      Just had my date with Butcher Bill.... I think we have a winner.  We had a totally casual night, went for Burgers at Kopp's...ate outside since it's absolutely  gorgeous  outside.. then took turns kickin eachother ass at Fun World (let me tell you, we played some mean air hockey), then sat outside on my curb for hours and just talked.  It was the perfect first date, we had a blast. No dressing up and wining and dining bullshit, it was straight up 'This is me. The no frills, every day, me. Take it or leave it'.  He's someone I feel totally comfortable around and he didn't make any moves on me unlike   Marine Boy -VERY much appreciated.  He may be a blue collar worker for the rest of his life, but he's a hard worker and he enjoys his job, loves kids, has a good family relationship, has an active social life and he's a nice intelligent guy... all in all he's quality boyfriend material.

      The downside to having the washer and dryer in my bedroom??  My roommate coming in to do laundry at   3 a.m.   !  Not acceptable.  Yesterday was your day off, buddy, you had all fuggin day to switch your clothes from the washer to the dryer -   Don't interrupt my beauty sleep for that bullshit!

      I must be dying.  That's the only explanation I can think of why I got 9 hours of sleep last night and still feel like I'm in a coma.  Ridiculous. Psycho Czech boy called me in a panic because he hasn't paid his credit card in a year and now the credit card company is telling him he needs to pay his late fees...??!?!?  Because I can surely help him, working in an   auto loan   collections office of an   entirely different bank  .  Now I'm not only the International Welcome Wagon, but the International  FINANCIAL CONSULTANT      as well...  good god.    I must be going thru Funquita withdrawl because i'm gosh darn cranky today >: (

      SO TIRED!!!  That's it, I am turning off my phone and going to bed at 8:00 tonight.. No hour long conversations w/ Butcher Bill or Marine Mike, no endless texting w/ Funquita.. the phone is BANNED from my thoughts tonight.  Ha ha.. just as I'm writing this Funquita calls.. Go Figure =)   Had an alright day at work.  Actually it really sucked. I hate my job.  I did talk to Kenny though (ahhh....love him) and I did get a rave performance review from my sexy supervisor and a 6% salary increase --ROCK!  Oh and I got an email from HHHHOTLanta Boy Micah... (ahhh, Love him too! -- For those of you who don't know, he and I shared some crazy nights in Florida last October).  It was a little too short and sweet, but he was at work so I'll forgive him I guess.    I'm gonna go take a nap....

      What does she think is shady about Marine Mike?  I thought he was a nice guy but pondered why a man should need to travel to Milwaukee to meet a nice girl.....not that you aren't worth it cuz of course my Kit Kat is worth any man's attention....but why in the big city of Chicago must he come here?  Maybe he's an FBI agent on secret mission to find out What a Woman Wants?  LOL...okay Kitty Kat, how are we going to go over a week without seeing each other?  I feel so lost without you and it's only been about 18 hours since I last saw you!

      Disturbing thought:  Flashdance thinks there might be something shady about Marine Mike... Could he be too good to be true?!?!

      Marine Mike came up Saturday.  He's hot.  Wasn't as uncomfortable around him as I feared I would be... actually he's way more of a dork than I originally thought.  That's okay, thought, b/c I too am a DBC (Dork By Choice).  We hung  out at my place, using Funquita and Flashdance as my backup.  Everything was going great until they left and I had to seriously work to keep my new Celebacy Pact in effect.  He wasn't being a dick, just persistant, but I don't care how many languages he speaks, 'No' is universal in all (except Japanese, apparently, which he  just had to point out).  After making him feel like the disrespectful shit he was being, we had a good talk and he apologized.  He still slept on the floor though.. probably afraid I'd knee him in the balls when he was all vulnerable and unexpecting.  And he still didn't get any the next morning either, even when I caught him without his shirt...and let me tell you, ladies, tempations run high when facing a body that beautifully sculpted!!  I still haven't decided how I feel about him.    Had another marathon phone call with Butcher Bill last night, too.  We're tentativly rescheduling for Wednesday, he has to make sure he can get out of his bowling league...AWWWWW!!!... j/k.  He marveled at how well we get along... how he hates talking on the phone, yet he'll talk to me for hours.  How he was thinking the other day, "Wow, my life is going pretty good, I'm moving into a new place... I've been talking to an awesome girl...." (that's me, in case anyone was wondering).  That was sweet, I hope I don't have to break his heart... of course Marine Boy already has me pegged for marriage practically....I might have to take a poll amongst my whoppin' 3 followers to decide who to choose =)

      I'm so tired.   The kind of tired where you little wonder "Do I have narcolepsy?!?" because at any moment you just might pass out at the very spot your standing.  My plan to be asleep by a reasonable hour last night was shattered when Marine Boy Mike called me and talked my ear off for 3 hours.  Not that I minded.  We had good conversation, and he has the kind of backhanded, matter of fact complimentary that I'm fond of.  Found myself thinking "huh. I'm kinda likin this guy!"....which is the same thing I was thinking about Butcher Bill on Thursday.    Speaking of... I half cancelled our date tonight via text message.. how lame is that?!?!  Didn't think it was at the time b/c I was at work and couldn't very well call him, but according to Funquita I'm a heartless bastard.   I really want to see him, I'm liking him a lot.  But I'm pretty sure I'll be dead asleep by the time he's done with work.......  Oh well.   Swiss is coming up from Chicago to "spend the day with me" tomorrow... we'll see how that goes.

      HAPPY ST PATTY'S DAY!!!!!!!!!  I got picked up by a 22 year old self described 'Denzel Washington/Usher Mix' from San Diego today.  He called to do a phone payment for his vehicle loan and either I sound like a phone sex operator at my job or he's desperate for female attention because he's all set to meet me.  I told him I'd call him if I was ever in the area and he gave me his e-mail address.  Trivial thing, but it added a smile and slight boost of ego to my day...    So a good friend of mine found out she was pregnant... lovely result of a one night stand.  Got me thinking about how many times I've lucked out myself, so she and I took a vow of celebacy.  No more sex until we're in relationships for a respectable number of months.  Well, maybe weeks.  I'm done with all these boys who aren't interested in getting to know me.  Fuck 'em.  I'm juggling 3 guys right now, 4 if I want to include Matchbox 20 guy...but I'm pretty sure he's in the elimination process... at least ONE of them has to be interested in pursuing a relationship!!  And if they're not willing to invest a little time into me, I'm not willing to invest my body in them....  So There.

      Found out why Mr.Wonderful never called me again....(Scott)... met his GIRLFRIEND last night.  Yeah, there was a little bit of drama.  Leslie dragged her into the bathroom and told her about us, then dragged me in there with them to explain the story.  Let's just say she was not a happy camper.  She said that they have been together for 3 years and were technically broken up but he still calls her everyday trying to get her back because he "LOVES" her so much *AHH BULLSHIT* and that he's cheated on he before and she was warned when she first started dating him of what a dirty dirty boy he was..  She was crying, I was pissed.  I don't doubt that he loves her after the way he was chasing her around the bar afterwards trying to apologize/explain or whatever. And I have to give her props for holding her own... although I'm sure she eventuallly went home with him.  Typical.  Just SO FUCKIN TYPICAL that the one guy that doesn't annoy me is a lying, cheating, FUCKER.  Let me just tell you, I will be going to that bar every god damn week and I will be a constant reminder to him of what a god damn idiot he is and he will wish he had never been born...

      Love will abide....take things in stride That's what someone told me,  But there's no one at my side.  And time washes clean Love's wounds unseen... That's what someone told me,  But I don't know what it means  Cause I've done everything I know To try and make you mine,  And I think I'm gonna love you  For a long, long time...   Caught in my fears, Blinking back the tears I can't say you've hurt me,  When you never let me near And I never drew one response from you,  All the while you failed,  All the girls you never knew   'Cause I've done everything I know To try and make you mine And I think it's gonna hurt me For a long long time...   I wait for the day When you go away  Knowing that you warned me of the price I'd have to pay  And life's full of loss Who knows the cause,  Living in a memory  Of a love that never was  Cause I've done everything I know To try and change your mind And I think I'm gonna miss you  For a long long time   Yes I've done everything I know To try and make you mine And I think I'm gonna love you For a long long time.....

      It's amazing how therapeautic a good shopping spree and crazy night of dancing can be!  Yesterday my good friend Funquita and I hit up the outlet mall like none other, then I took my happy ass to a free beer party Leslie's friend Gio won. I think I lost about 80 lbs..  Got a couple digits... all in all it was a good night.  Met Rob - who looks surprisenly a lot like the lead singer of Matchbox 20 (even crazier that they share the same name...) and Mike.  Me Likey Mikey.  He's 27, from Switzerland, going to school for his 3rd degree (aka, intelligent and ambitious). And very much the gentleman. He might be a little too pompous for me, though.. little too know-it-all.. haven't decided yet.    So I was dating this Czech guy for a whoppin month, until we had a falling out due to his overly opinionated mouth, and so what does he do?  Gives my number to his soon-to-be divorced friend who has literally called me 3-5 times a day since.. How do you tell a sweet, heartbroken Czech guy that he's borderline PSYCHO without hurting his feelings??!?!?  Lord help me.  I can't get the guys I like to stay, and the one's that drive me nuts won't go away. Must be some BAD KARMA I have.

      It's Saturday.  I woke up at 7:30 a.m. furious.  Furious that I was awake so early on a friggin Saturday.  Furious that I'm still sick. Furious that  urlLink Scott  turned out to be a bastard (see march 5th posting on funquita's page).  Furious that Bootycall Bryan has found a girlfriend, even more, has met her parents- (What happened to his fear of commitment?!?) Furious that everybody else around me seems to find happiness and all I attract are extended one night stands and married men.  I'm not bitter, I'm just having a bad week.

      Went to Kareoke night last night.  Ran into Jeff - my old nasty apartment manager who used to call me all the time and buy me flowers.  He recognized me.  Ew Ew Ew Ew.    I love Spammy.  How do I get to him without hurting Spooner?  Would it really be breaking the friend code if he has told her he's definitly not interested? And she's aware of this and accepting of this??  Yes probably.  He's so not worth it.    Giving Butcher Bill a 2nd chance tonight.. we'll see how that goes.

      Dragged Funquita up North with me to a friend's housewarming party.  We drove 2 hours, sat on the couch for 2 1/2 hours, and drove home.  These people were the most unwelcoming, unsociable people I have ever met.  So what if we didn't grow up in the same hick town and know them since we were in diapers.. JEEsus!  Anyway, we came home and were passed out by 10:30.  On a Saturday night.  I'm blaming Friday night's rendevous for that.   We did make up our very own rendition of "Because I Got High", though.  Very impressive if I do say so myself.  Funquita's in charge of  posting them, stay tuned.    Had a dream about Him AGAIN last night.  What is going on?!!?  He and I were at this party, thrown at my place (which was much larger than it actually is).  I was talking to this girl I work with and he came up behind me, put his arms around my waist and rested his head on my shoulders and started talking to her.  I was irritated, thinking he was flirting with her because she was black.  Even though he has never dated or been interested in a black girl before and we weren't 'Together' in the dream, so I really had no reason to be mad.  I leave the room, go talk to other people.  On my way out to the balcony I see him across the room.  He looks at me.  My shoulders drop, defeated, I just shake my head and look away.  I lean over the balcony and he come up beside me.  Very close.  Our shoulders our touching and our arms are overlapping.  I look the other direction for a few moments before deciding I should quit being so childish.  Ask him a question (how have you been, or something like that) and he answers with a big story.  He's smiling while he's telling me this and we're making direct eye contact.  He suddenly interrupts himself mid sentence and kisses me.   And then kisses me again.  And again.  Then we walk inside, somebody stops me and he disappears again.  That's all I remember.  Weird.    I need to get some shit done today.

      Recap of this week:     Tuesday   The best feeling in the world -  The 'I Just Got Laid' glow.  What's better than that??  Having the 'I Just Got Laid' glow without getting laid, without any reason what-so-ever.   Tuesday was a great day for me, I was happy and upbeat.  I even smiled at my snatch whore boss.  I was nice to customers who yelled at me (and my theory of 'you can catch more bees w/ honey' was proven true--I should really excerise that idea more often).  I also  found out that out of control good moods are quite contagious, because I was getting positive vibes from EVERYONE that day, even crotchety old Ms. Mary.    Tuesday night I ditch my resume writing/job hunt plans to console my good friend Funquita in what was, as I found out, just the beginning of her Weird Boy Dilemma Week.  We watched   The Sweetest Thing   (for the 800th time) and analyzed the sitiation.  Yes, I said 'sitiation', not 'situation'.  This is not a typo.  Learn my lingo if you're going to read my web page.  We determined he's freaked out - because, heaven forbid he should develop  feelings  for a beautiful, intelligent, fun loving, sexy ass girl!!  Fuck boys.     Wednesday  I realize that I am a PUTZ and I will never accomplish anything unless my procrastinatin' ass gets in gear.  Back to being cranky at work.  I hate my job. I hate the world.  Get a text message from Butcher Bill saying " To be perfectly Honest, I miss you.  A Little".  Why would he write that?!  WHY??  I don't miss him. How can he miss me??? We've seen eachother twice.  I didn't really know how to respond to that... maybe "that's great, the feeling's not mutual though"??  No.  Because I'm too nice.  So I send him and "awww.... =) "  and ignored his calls the rest of the night.    Wednesday night I had a strict plan to turn off my phone, ignore the world, and get my shit done.  All was going as planned.  Worked out for an hour.  Even cleaned the kitchen and my bathroom.  Was just about to settle down to job hunt when Trailer and Nick show up at my door.    *Nick=guy who rolled the jeep that put Spooner in the hospital*   Why he is hanging out with us now is beyond me.  Nick recognizes me from the Race Shed.  Turns out he used to bartend there.  Fatty Fatty Two-by-Four used to always make him show us his abs.  Never thought he was cute then, don't think he's cute now.  He immediately takes a liking to me, I could have probably felt the overbearing 'I want you' vibes from China.  Trailer prints out music for me to learn on the keyboard.  Apparently he has big plans for me, him and Spooner to play at Open Mic Night.  Um, okay buddy.      We head over to Spooner's and chill for awhile until T & N have this sudden intense urge to show Spooner and me the video they made in college.  We have to go to Nick's for this.  Nick's place is nasty.  NASTY.  I mentally add this to list of reasons I don't want to date Trailer - Nasty friends in Nasty homes.  Been there, done that with Jailbird's friends.  I think I'm above and beyond skanky surroundings.   *Trailer Ego Boost of Night:  Uses me as an example of a "Perfect Hourglass Shape" in one of his stories  Flattering coming from anyone, especially someone  who really doesn't throw out compliments at free will.      Thursday    Funquita comes over with the intent to rollerblade.  Ended up ordering pizza and doing a couple drive-by's.  She's (understandably) freaking out over his attitude and as it turns out, her hunches were dead on.  =(   FUCK BOYS.   Friday  Nothing special.  Ended up at Kelly's with Trailer, Spooner, Funquita, Spammy and Matt-Stealer's skanky ass.  Funquita and I get hit on my dirty the Dirty Mexican Posse.  Her guy tells her he's gay, my guy tries to get me to cage dance.  Ha.  Too bad his friends leaked that he just wanted to get laid, cuz he was a little bit of a cutie.  Quita finally drags me away from him at bar time and we feast on some good ass George Webb's.     *Trailer Ego Boost of the Night* -"Your ass looks fantastic in those pants"  -"You and me could sit on the fuckin roof and have a blast" (while discussing everyone's drama of which bar to go to) -" I was going to invite Nick, but as soon as he found out Katie was coming he was just a little too eager to tag along..." (meaning a.)he was looking out for me and 'uncomfortable situations' or b.) he didn't want to share my attention. I'm guessing 'a' and I'm flattered that he cares.)   -and "Every Katie I have ever met has been hot.  I mean, look at you."   I may not want to hook up with him anymore, but I very much appreciate the attention I've been getting!

      A few months ago I met a man named Jon, and let me tell you he was a real Don Juan. Jon took me out for fancy dinners, and after just two dates we were sinners. I felt very special when I was with him, doing things just on a whim.  Now he's not sure he wants to be with me, but he's too confused and wants to see. Jon doesn't want to give me up just yet, but any closer to him I won't get. He told me he cares for me a lot, but let down my guard I will not.  I'm confused right now to no end, but my own rules I cannot bend. If he cares for me as he said, he won't be able to get me out of his head. Jon doesn't really have a clue, nobody to tell him what to do.  I won't sit around and wait, while he gets his own shit straight. My ego's bruised and my pride is hurt, but in the end my pain is inert. I met a guy named Jon a few months ago, and now today I must let go.

      What a _______ weekend I had.     Friday:  Candle party night at Funquita's and off to O'Brien's afterwards, where for 2 hours I got no male attention and then right when we were getting ready to leave I got hit on my 2 guys.  Figures.  Funquita of COURSE had to embarrass the shit out of me in front of Red - Thanks Funquita!  That's okay though cuz he wasn't all that cute head on.  Mr.Kickball on the otherhand was a cutie patootie, I think I might wanna make a trip back there nxt friday for an aftergame checkin'-you-out moment.....    Saturday:  I lounged around and did virtually nothing all day.... wait, scratch that.  I painted bar stools, but it took me 8 hours to paint 3 - does that count as being productive?  Went out with Spooner (formerly Flashdance) and Matt-Stealer for a couple hours.  Met this 'cute boy' (cute by Spooner's standards, not mine) at the Shed.  He was new in town from New York.  Thought we'd be nice and show him a night out on the town.  Little did we know he was a mute freak w/ random, non coherent spurts of insight, straight out of a 3 year NY rehab for "mostly narcotics".  So WEIRD.  We'll call him Idiot Boy.    Bar time.  Spooner and M-S decide they want to meet Trailer (formerly known as Matt) at an after bar.  I veto the idea, not particularly wanting to see  them all up in eachother's shit.  3 a.m.  The fun flirty bootycall conversation I'm having w/ Sosa is interupted by M-S telling me that they were in a car accident and Spooner might need stitches.  I fly to the hospital where I meet her and Idiot boy (yes, he's STILL with us).      So I'm stuck in the waiting room with a girl I hate because she stole my lust object and a boy who's very presence makes me want to gnaw my arm off.  Fun.  While Idiot Boy when on a smoking binge w/ M-S's cigarettes (p.s. he's an idiot AND he's rude!)  She and I bonded over vending machine food and cell phones.  5 hours later we can finally see spooner, she went thru cat scans and  cathaders (sp??) and her first comment is "My doctor is HOT!"..... oh yeah, she'll be fine.     Sunday:  I tried to sleep all day, but of course that's the day I'm suddenly popular.  Funquita calls.  I go back to sleep.  Sosa calls.  I try to go back to sleep but he yells at me about what a beautiful day it is.  Very true.  So I sit outside and do nothing until Funquita calls and wants to do this thing called   excercise  (on a Sunday? how absurd...).  Our retarded gimpy asses tool around the river, blown over by the 95 mile and hour winds and pelted with sand and pebbles.  Maybe that was a little dramatic.  It was fun, defninitly should be a routine.  Head off to the Rooster for a good ass burger and chat w/ Sosa...  I think I have a crush on him.. Too bad he's off limits due to the Friend Code.     Monday:  Horrible day.  Not even going to talk about it.  The sun will come out Tomorrow, Tomorrow.....

      EVERYTIME ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Notice me  Take my hand  Why are we strangers when  Our love is strong  Why carry on without me?  Everytime I try to fly I fall  Without my wings  I feel so small  I guess I need you baby  And everytime I see you in my dreams  I see your face, it's haunting me  I guess I need you baby   I make believe  That you are here  It's the only way  I see clear  What have I done  You seem to move on easy  Everytime I try to fly I fall  Without my wings  I feel so small  I guess I need you baby  Everytime I see you in my dreams  I see your face, it's haunting me  I guess I need you baby   I may have made it rain  Please forgive me  My weakness caused you pain  And this song is my sorry  At night I pray  That soon your face  Will fade away  Everytime I try to fly I fall  Without my wings  I feel so small  I guess I need you baby  And everytime I see you in my dreams  I see your face, it's haunting me  I guess I need you baby

      Last night was a little bit crazy.  What started out as a nice, short night of cards and drink turned into a full fledged drunken peanut tossing, shit talkin, coffee table crashing alll nighter.  Flash, Sammy and Matt came over.  Have to say, I have a new perspective on Matt.  For awhile I was thinking he's a chump, but we had good conversation last night.  When we FINALLY went to bed at, ahem, 4:53 a.m.  he jumped in bed next to me and spooned me like no other.  Ahhh... and it didn't annoy me! (unlike the Butcher Bill episode).  Haven't had that good o' cuddling since Funquita and The Chair  ; )   I'm happy things are back to normal with us, I like that we're friends AND can snuggle - such a bonus!   Anyway, shit was so NOT cool when I woke up in a panic at 7:28 a.m. after sleeping thru my alarm for 40 minutes.  Had to do rapid change, mexican shower, hair in pony mode.  Took me a good amount of screaming and kicking and hair pulling to wake Flash's ass up and then she putzed around forEVER.... And to my great surprise we STILL made it to work with 5 minutes to spare!!!!     They're trying to drag me out to the Rooster AGAIN.. these crazy kids.  There's a time when I have to put my foot down and say NO, I can't handle this partying every night routine, I'm starting to look a little haggard!!

      What the @#*$?%?! is wrong with this thing??? It's psycho, it won't let me make any changes to the appearance, and then 4 days later it will finally kick in and not let me change it back. Bullshit.    Kareoke at the Rooster last night.  Matt is hot.  Ahhhhh.... too too bad he's a loser.  Jenny was there last night and he spent most of the night ignoring her.  The bitter, jealous me was secretly elated by this.  Almost perfomed a little debut but chickened out. Maybe next week, gotta work up the momentum.... it's just not the same as my little Car Concerts I like to give myself.....   Butcher Bill came along.. he was pretty quiet.  He stayed over and spent the ENTIRE night rubbing my shoulders and arms and stomach.  I found it rather annoying and didn't get much sleep.  Definitly losing interest.  DAMMIT why can't I just like a nice guy?!?   Funquita, what the...?!?!  I thought you were over the whole JB dumping you thing?

      Dear Trish,  I met a nice man online about a month ago. We go out frequently and seem to get along fairly well, but I have the sense there's something missing. I've only been dating him for a few weeks, but I suspect he's about to give me the boot. How can I tell if he's about to dump me?  - Nervously Waiting   Dear Nervously Waiting, While a woman's intuition is strong, it can be overridden by other emotions like fear or insecurity.   Are you afraid of being dumped? Nobody likes to be, but it's part of dating, and it helps to be as philosophical about it as possible. This relationship is fairly new, so the stakes are still relatively low, aren't they? And isn't it better to know now rather than farther down the road when your lives are seriously entwined? Changing your attitude won't avoid the pain altogether, but it will help you get back in the dating game faster.   Or could it be that your self-esteem is a little low? Are you concerned that he's too good for you? Or simply convinced that this one will end as others have - in a break-up that leaves you gutted? Just because a relationship doesn't work out doesn't mean you're a bad or unworthy person. It just means you need to keep looking. There really is someone out there for everyone. Sometimes you have to kiss a few frogs to find him.   Be sure to check in with your gut before you go any further. Ask yourself if you really think he's going to break up or if you're just overly concerned about harmless behaviours.   Here are a few sure-fire signs that something's up:   He stops calling or checking in and/or stops taking your calls  He's suddenly unavailable for dates  He radically changes his look  He makes a lot of pathetic excuses  If this sounds familiar, it's possible that a break up is in your future. However, it's important to note that there are perfectly good reasons for any of these behaviours. They don't really prove anything but could be solid circumstantial evidence that a crime of the heart is about to be perpetrated.   If you honestly believe he's going to break up with you, you'll need to decide if you want to beat him to it and end the relationship first. But since there's still a margin for error, it might be best to have a non-confrontational conversation with him. Avoid the "state of the relationship" talk; it's far too early for that.   Instead, the next time you're together in a private setting, tell him how you're feeling. Yes, it's scary to put your emotions on the line. And yes, there's a possibility he'll stomp all over your heart. But it's just as possible that he'll appreciate your honesty and either allay your fears or be equally forthcoming about his doubts. As corny as it sounds, honesty is the best policy.

      Last night was crazy fun.  Started out boring- Me, Funquita and Pseudo Boyfriend (PBF) were the only ones there for the 1st half hour.  Finally Flashdance and the gang came.  Got big ego boost by both PBF and Funquita when Jenny walked in.   "What?!" says PBF, "He likes her over you?!?  You are so much hotter".   "Really?"  I ask, " I think she's cute actually.  And they look so much better  together".  "No" Funquita says.  "She is not cute  at all .  She looks 'weathered'.   Definitly not cute".  Thanks guys. Apparently the Funquita stamp of approval is not in favor of Matt either, because after 2 seconds she decided he's a big fat ol'  loser.  Yeah, pretty much.  But, like Flash says, he's excellent  friend material, not so good boyfriend material.  I still like the guy. Seems the Pseudo Boyfriend or SOMETHING was working in my favor last night, though, because Matt was following me around like crazy.  We were back to flirty, chummy friends, which is actually what I wanted.  Obviously he's still very much interested in Jenny, and that's fine.  They really are cute together, I don't care what anyone else says.  I don't want to date him or even fuck him anymore..I got the attention I wanted, and I'm satisfied with that.   And  speaking of attention.... PBF got a LITTLE out of hand with the attention he was giving me!  The ass grabbing I can understand... I mean, I  do  have a grabbable ass (or as Matt puts it, a "very slappable ass"), but when he tried to kiss me I damn near flipped out.  He is   engaged   HELLO!  Very not cool.    Anyway, after a tiring night of bootyshakin' and ass slappin (I think I broke my hand on Matt's ass), Funquita and I stumbled back to my place, had an uncontrollable gigglefest as we made some burnt ass grilled cheese sandwitches  *Mental note to self: Do Not Cook While Under the Influence of Several Alcoholic Beverages*   and watched Zoolander.  My happy ass woke up at 6:50 a.m. bright eyed and bushy tailed... What the..??!?!  I'm going back to bed.    Happy Easter!!!!

      Matt like's Flash's friend Jenny.  They're both coming with us to the concert tonight.  This oughtta be interesting....    Looked up his criminal record today.  Way too long for my taste and has way to many outstanding tickets.  Add that to his already long negative list and I just have to say... I can do   DAMN  better!

      Saw   Eternal Sunshine for the Spotless Mind  with Funquita last night.  I'm not usually a big fan of trippy, neurotic, out of order movies, but I have to say this was excellent.  It really got you thinking.  Before I went I thought of how great it would be if I could erase events and certain people from my memory, but the more I think about it the more I realize that, whether or not you still communicate with those people, the memories -Good and Bad- are a good thing to hold on to.  Especially the Good. I have a hard time moving on from relationships (one in particular) and I think that's because I always concentrate on the good memories.  I don't want to think about how perfect He and I were together, how much fun we had, how much he adored me (in the beginning at least) because it makes me sad that we'll never be back together again.  But then I think of that old saying "It's better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all", and I've come to realize that some people are not meant to get out of your head.    Speaking of, I had a dream about HIM last night.  No, not Matt.. Not Mike or Bill or any other of my crazy little dilemmas.  HIM- the only guy I've every really truly loved.  The only guy who is constantly on my mind.  Not necessarily in strong thought process, but always lingering there.  The only part I remember is towards the end.  We were both laying face down on the floor, hooked up to a Matchmaking machine.  They were testing him to find out who was most compatible with him and I was summoned.  In my dream we were broken up and not exactly pleased to see eachother, much less be bounded together by a machine, but after awhile he reached over and nudged my foot with his.  I smiled at him and he smiled back.  Above our heads the machine was flashing red "Perfect Match" arrows at me and I knew everything was going to be okay with us.    I haven't dreamed about him in a long, long time.  Maybe it was the movie that stirred up something.  Maybe there's a reason he's still on my mind.

      Why is it that I can have 3 guys interested in me and go after the one who isn't.  And why is it that I let that one guy mark my confidence.  And why do I let that make me feel lonely.  What is wrong with me, for real???    Matt's out.  I had already decided that he was too pretty for me and he and I don't really have anything to talk about, but now that he's really not interested in me it's driving me nuts.  Fuckin Fucker.   Mr. Sherwin Williams called out of the blue last night --  Funquita, did you have anything to do with that? ;)

      But you don't have to settle or even make any decision about either one of them right now do you?  I mean neither one is asking you to be their girlfriend just yet are they?  Date 'em both!  You'll know what's right when you are asked to be part of a couple!  Go with the flow baby doll.  Matt sounds like the preferred, but we all know where that can lead.  Come on girl, you and I have been around the subject many times over...screw the fact that you don't like his middle name by the way.  I happen to like the name Jonathan ;)  and it happens to flow very well with Matthew...all 3 Matt's that I know have that middle name!!

      So I met Matthew J Moede on Thursday night thru my friend Flashdance.  My first thought: He's too short.  My second thought: He's got amazing teeth.  He's 25.  He's an amazing artist.  He's been to jail.  He's been in the military.  He's going back to school for Graphic Design.  He's hot.  He's funny.  He's a really nice guy.  With an edge.  With mystery.  Which of course is completely appealing to me.  We all passed out in Flash's bed that night and he spooned me and rubbed my stomach all night.  The next morning he was gone, and for a moment I was irritated... leave to a guy, can't stick around until the morning.  Then I found The Note.     Nice meeting you Katie, I had fun with you both.  Please call me.   . Redemption, he's still a nice guy.    Then there was Friday night... pretty self explanatory in the entry below.  But I still don't know how he feels about me.  Which is fine, because I'm still not sure how I feel about him.  The fact that his middle name is Jonathan also throws a Red Flag, as I have very poor history with "Johns".  He told Flash that "I'm totally myself and he loves that.  And he loves hanging out with me.  And if it leads to something else than so be it, whatever happens happens". But I don't know if he was saying that because he's not interested, or because he thinks I'm not interested.    Then there's Butcher Bill.  Genuinely nice guy, no bad ass too him. Which I need but don't necessary think I want.  And Bill's cute. And he's funny.  And he's a smart ass, and I can be dirty and raunchy around him, like I am with my guy friends.  And he doesn't care if I'm dolled up.  And he doesn't care that my abs could use some sculpting.  He's not a puzzle, he's not a friggin scavenger hunt.  I don't have to piece him together and hunt for clues to figure out what he thinks of me.  He thinks I'm amazing.  And I think I can live with that.  But does that mean I'm settling?

      He pulled me close to him and started grinding to the music.  It was a pleasant surprise to finally find a white guy who can dance.  His kisses were soft and sensual (as sensual as you could possibly be in the middle of an overpopulated bar) as they traveled from my neck to my ear, hovering around the lips then landing lightly at the corner of my mouth.   He offered me a sweet, dimpled smile while ever so lightly brushing strands of hair from my face.  I can remember the smell of his cologne, his Juicy Fruit breath (who chews juicy fruit anymore?!?), and the way his clear blue eyes connect so well with mine.  It was one of those few perfect moments when nobody else even existed.

      It's amazing how the most comfortable place in the world when you're sick is the bathroom floor.  Spent the whole day camped out on mine, the cool tile my only support as I slowly regurgitated to death.  At first I thought I was hungover from my Red Rooster outing last night... but 12 hours later I'm starting to wonder.  All I know is that I had to cancel on Butcher Bill AGAIN and if I died right now I'd be okay with that.

      My phone boyfriend Kenny is coming to town for a Prince concert... Do I really want to meet him??  We have such witty, flirty phone banter.. meeting him just might ruin all the fun. The image I have created is most likely the direct opposite of what he really is.  True, LOOKS DON'T MATTER... Except, well, they do.  To an extent. Because I'm shallow.  I look forward to talking to him everyday... what will keep me going at work if I find out he's a nerd?  Or a jackass?  No, he's definitly not a jackass.  Quite possibly a nerd.  Although, believe or not, It's a sign of utter coolness and masculine security to be going to a Prince concert.  And if we don't click, I don't want any awkwardness.. you know... during the 2 seconds of  a phone transfer.  Is it worth the potential disaster and humuliation, not to mention the fall of a pefectly innocent and ever- so- fun fantasy?

      Are you KIDDING me?!?!  Are you FUCKING KIDDING ME???!?!?!?    Those are my famous last words before almost getting us kicked out of Hart Park Saturday night, when the rent a cops banned me from going potty.  They literally followed me to the "correct" bathroom to tell me they "thought it would be best if I just left".   Fockers.   Oh well, we had fun anyway, jammin to the sounds of our pasts...  2 DECADES ago - (isn't that crazy to think about???!)...  As the Toys played some great 80's tunes.    Afterwards we headed up to the rooster for someone's birthday... we don't know who's... but, hey.... F IT - IT'S MY BIRTHDAY!!!!  Spammy got his lip pierced, which does not suit him at all, Mentos played the wounded 'good guy who been done wrong' and had girls practically fanning him and feeding him grapes, Spooner made out with Nastygram, and we all (well I) got sloppy drunk. Yup, it wås a good night.

      Had to bury my phone today.  Apparently cell phones are not in favor of overnight stays at the Mud Puddle Inn, where my drunk ass ever so maternally abandoned it in.    Had a good time last night.   Went to some ho dunk corner bar and kicked major asshole in air hockey for a couple hours.  I have a nice little blister forming as a result.  AHHHHH war wounds!!!  It was good, laid back fun though.   Had to cut out early since my origional intentions were to leave for Lacrosse this a.m..... which... didn't happen any b/c I've spent all morning replacing my phone and getting my oil change (since 8 Mile failed to follow thru with his promise yesterday).    I am EXHAUSTED.  Going to take a nap now so I can be rejuvinated for a whole new week of partying...

Maybe it's the effed up dreams I've been having lately that are interupting my sleep.  Maybe that lump under my throat really is cancer and I'm dying a slow, agonizing, sleep deprived death. I want to go home.  I want to sleep for years and years.  I can't, though, because everybody else called in sick today.  Fuckers (Effers?? does that work?!?).

      OUCH!  Spent entire day outside yesterday and my dumbass didn't think I would need sunscreen.  What was I thinking???     Went to 8 Mile's softball practice with Spooner for 3 HOURS.  Taught the cutest little kid the baseball "stance", so now I'm his best friend.  Too bad his mom is a stupid whiny whore.   Afterwards we headed back to Spooner's for an impromptu cookout.  My idea, which I do believe was brilliant.  We had  a pretty good turnout for being so last minute.  Played some volleyball, drank some beer and ate a WHOLE lotta food.  I'm pretty sure I'm still in a food coma right now actually.  We've decided this will definitly have to be a weekly event.  Busy friggin week lineup for me!!  Sundays: softball practice and cookout Mondays: kareoke at the Rooster Tuesdays: softball game for the boys Wednesdays: softball game for Funquita's boys Thursdays: Volleyball game Fridays: volleyball/drinking/hottubbin at my place  This definitly is not going to work if I want to function every day living activities, such as paying bills, cleaning and, well, sleeping!

      Taurus  April 19 - May 19 You are about to experience a major change in your life's direction, dear Taurus, and it may occur today. Keep your mind open to all sorts of possibilities, as you are likely to receive some important information. Of course, you may not realize right away that it is important. It is only with the passage of time that you will look back on this event as being pivotal. Make sure that you don't miss it.   It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood!!!  The Sun is shining, I'm going to spend the day outside, I'm feeling SKINNY (despite the fact I mowed down an entire pizza on my own yesterday), AND my horoscope is optomistic.  HAPPY HAPPY day to me!

      Ugh.  My place reeks of vodka, chlorine and damp towels that have been molding  on my floor all night.   Funquita, Spooner and 8 Mile came over for a night of pool volleyball, hot tubbin and drinking.  Waiting AGAIN for an eviction notice thanks to Spooner's loud ass.  It wasn't supposed to be a crazy drinking event but, well, get us all together and it's inevitable.      Key Moments of the Night:    -Ghetto Riggin my swim suit  -Vodka concoctions in water bottles to "fool the cameras" -"My bumper doesn't work"  -Flashback 80's  -Shaving Spooner's treasure trail    Deep Discussions of the Night:    -Body hair:  Should women shave their treasure trail?   -Monet's:  Beautiful from far away, up close a big ol' mess -Illusionists:  Men and women who throw off such an aire of confidence that everyone is tricked into thinking they are cool/sexy/hot.  The illusion can immediately be ruined at the first sign of insecurity/indecisiveness/psychoness -Navel rings:  Hot or Not?

      Taurus Entertaining impossible ideas is your best safety valve. You have enough sense to stop yourself from carrying them out, because in practice this would be dangerous stuff. Keep your urges and temptations in a hammer lock. Draw a thick, obvious line between reality and fantasy, and do not cross it. Keep a journal. Detailed references to your dark underside will make for an exciting read if you ever decide to share them. And if certain things are just too personal, that's okay, too. As long as you're coping with your problems, anything is acceptable. - By Astrology.com

      So Funquita took my car home Saturday night, right?  She took my house key off my key chain and left it with me so I wouldn't, you know, lock myself out.  When she returned my keys, instead of putting the apt key back on the key chain.... I didn't.  No other reason other than sheer laziness.  So yesterday, I'm trottin on home from work, dig in purse for my key and... whoops, not there.  No problem.  Got a temporary key from the front desk (also got a scolding from the apt. manager regarding saturday's party like a rock star event), and went on with my merry way.    Fast forward a few hours.  I get ambitious and decide to work out.  I look at my apartment key (the temp b/c as of then I still hadn't found the real one), decide I'm NOT going to put it on my chain b/c it will expire tomorrow anyway, and therefore is a waste of the 2 seconds it wld have taken me to put it on.  Instead I decide to look for my real key.  In doing so, I get sidetracked by a phonecall from Mother, grab my CAR KEYS (***NOTE!!  NO APT KEY HAS BEEN ATTACHED YET!!!***) and walk out the door, realizing only when the door slams in my face what a terrible terrible error I made.     There's me.  Standing in the hallway, flipflops, shorts and raggety t shirt.  No cell phone. No purse.  Of course I don't have anyone's phone #'s memorized because I am way too dependent on technology.  Thankfully I have my car keys.  I drive around town for an hour visiting all my nearest friends in hopes of finding someone w/ warm clothes and my roommates phone#.  Finally Mekka comes to the rescue and all is well... (I still had to camp out at the local tavern until my roommate got home from work at 1 frigging 30 a.m.).    Moral of the Story:   Don't be retarded.

      I spent $80 on a  pair of sunglasses today.  $80.00.  Eighty.  I don't even think I can justify that.  Okay, let me try.    1.  I go thru about 200 pairs of cheap sunglasses a year, I might as well get a good quality pair,  learn to take care of my things , and have them last for a good few years.   2.  It's my F-ing birthday (though I don't know how much longer I can get away with that excuse...maybe another week??)   3.  They would be considered a "steal" in Cosmo   4.  I've been 25 for 2 days now, I'm obviously hitting my mid life crisis.    5.  Everybody else can do, why can't I???  So there.      My birthday wasn't everything I hoped for.  Granted I had a great turnout and we had some crazy crazy fun, but there was still something missing (Maybe it was the $80 sunglasses).  Got 2 hours of sleep after fighting off a  21 year old for the night.  Woke up feeling refreshed yet PISSED at 8 Mile- which he picked up on right away, even though I thought I was doing a pretty good cover up job.  We had a nice little chat, chowed on some Webb's and everything's kosher again.   I'm just missing male companionship in my life, which is my own friggin fault since I sport a "No Trespassing!!" sign around every decent guy who shows any interest.   ugh.  ENOUGH of this topic!!!  Quick, somebody, Prozac!!  Anybody watch  urlLink Nip/Tuck  last night??

      Went to Sully's last night to celebrate 8 Mile's Roommate's birthday with Spooner, Funquita and some slummers.   Found out that Spammy still wants a booty call and 8 Mile wants to do "naughty naughty things to me in a nice way".  Spooner got hit on by Birthday Girl and well... that's about all I gotta say about that.

      Funny shit this weekend:  Sheets of Egyptian Cotton!    Hey Pussy Willow?    Spilling my smoothie up and OVER my shoulder onto the couch.  Stupid c*** running up the curb.  Forgetting which aisle we parked up, then pausing simultaneously as we realized.  Catherine's Plus Size Store next to LA Weight Loss.  Asking that hairy bitch if she ever thought about shaving her mustache.    ...  Not so funny shit this weekend:  Serious conversations that I seriously am tired of having.  NBJBPK Make the voices stop!  My park job in the garage last night.  My park job in the garage Saturday night.    ...

      Spent the day with Funquita yesterday.  Went shopping - NOT a good idea for an ego boost... I realize that, yes people, I am FAT.  Or maybe I should just stop shopping in the Junior's section....   Finally struck gold in footwear and we realized that it is true -- Shoes are a girls best friend.     Funny of the Day: Impatient lady runs up a curb, nearly flipping her truck and barely misses a pole after flipping US off for not letting her pass. Stupid bitch.    We went to see Mt Olive last night and had a blast, despite the lack of male prospectives.  For once I did not care that I was not hit on once all night.  Ran into some the old baseball team at Milly's... always nice to see some familiar faces.  We never hung out much in school but they came right over and we had a pleasant little conversation.  Ahhh.. how I wish I was back in college, life was so much easier back then!   Some guy just knocked on my door.  I think he had ADD.  He walked in, handed me some toilet, asked me if I would be interested in owning my apartment for only $200 more a month, talked to me about his family history, rambled on about the current owner of the apartment and how much he hates him, explained that he was thinking about buying the complex, told me he had to find a way to climb up into his apartment b/c he locked himself out,and asked me what I was in school for....all in about 3 breaths.  Strange.

      What the....?!?!   Payday today and my check hasn't been directly deposited?!?  What the fuck's goin on here... very NOT cool.  Hello, RENT DUE???    Found out last night that my roommate might not be able to afford the Fad Pad anymore, due to possible termination of his current employment.  Have to smirk a little over that, seeing as his pompous ass talks incessantly about how 'advanced' he is over the rest of his training class... and now I find out he's not 'up to par' on several things... In other works, according to his reviews he showed me, he fuckin sucks.  So whatever will I do should he need to vacate???  No worries, I always land on my feet.     Went out for Dancing Queen's B-Day last night.    F It, It's My Birthday!  .   Apparently she and Spammy disappeared together in the middle of the night and Spooner is NOT SO HAPPY... guess that answers my question of whether or not she'd approve hanky panky between me and him, huh?  Ahhhh well, much better fish in the sea for me.     Birthday Countdown   7 Days

       KatiKen Communication:  The art of simultaneous input and output, the ability to speak and listen at the same time.  Created  by DJ KEF and KitKat, this new method of communicating will, without a doubt, cut conversation lengths in half, thus creating smaller phone bills and smaller time consumption.  .... to accomodate the 'on the go'  lifestyles we've adopted.      KEF (Formerly known as "Kenny!!!!!" ) and I are now on a daily phone conversation schedule.   Even though we usually talk over eachother, we somehow manage to follow the same story line..  a skill we have oh-so-cleverly named the "KatiKen Communication" (say it really fast and it sounds cool).    8 1/2 hours for now I'll be leaving for the airport.   I'm finally PACKED.  Have some kickass CD's made (though no time for labels, so i have no clue what's on them =(  ).      Went to Mully's for a little while to tt Mekka, he says I'm more or less guaranteed a possiton at SFB ...so... YAY!..   I'm excited.  I'm excited to move down with Des and Mekka.. even Bitchatello... and of course Kef, who's gonna show me some good good times ; )   I will miss my beloved Funquita and Spooner TERRIBLY, though  =(     I don't know what I'll do without my totem poles, my 'lean on me's'...   who's gonna spoon me when i've had a night of rejection at the bars?   And who's gonna tell me my ass looks good in my shoes????   Alas, I need a change and I think this would be a good experience for me.....    Any way -  8 1/2 HOURS!!!!! WHOOOOO HOOOO!!!!

      Every once in awhile, someone will go out of there way to do something nice for you and it just makes you SO OPTIMISTIC about the human race.    On Tuesday one of my wisdom teeth started attacking me with a vengence, so I finally made an appointment to see my dentist next Wednesday - figuring he could take a look at it then and we could have it removed when I get back from Hawaii.   Today the pain was unbearable.  I call the office, talk to this nice guy named Jared who gave me a recommendation for an oral surgeon.  After calling around for an hour and not finding anyone who can get me in before mid july, I call Jared back in a panic.  This is ridiculous, I don't want to be in pain for Hawaii.. blah blah blah.  He said he was sure my (regular) dentist would be able to remove it, and rearranged a couple things in the scheduling book to make room for me tues a.m. so I would "surely be healed by Hawaii".  At 4 p.m. I get a voicemail from him.  "It's Jared.  Call me  as soon as you get this message  ".  They have an opening for me, could I make it?  Of COURSE.  I don't think I've ever been so excited to visit the dentist!  By the way, Jared turned out to be HOT.    I'm thinking there was an appointment cancellation or something.  No.  The office CLOSES at 4:00.   Not only that, Doc wasn't even  working  today.   He happened to stop by to check on Jared and Jared filled him in on my "emergency".   They removed my tooth right then and there solely on the idea that they wanted me to be cured by next Saturday when I leave.  I've only been to this dentist once in my life and that was a year and a half ago.  He has no obligations to me, no real personal bond or anything.  They didn't have to call me in after hours.  They didn't have to stay an extra hour for the procedure, they could have taken the x rays and told me to come back Tuesday.   I can't even DESCRIBE how grateful I am, for something as simple as pulling my friggin tooth.  Now I know how my customer's feel when I go out of my way to help them out and it is such a good feeling to know that YOU're giving something that same good feeling too.    I love the world today =)

      Well let's see: rollerblading, tennis and softball turned into babysitting, rain, taco bell, and the bar singing any song we could possibly think of at the top of our lungs and pretending we actually WERE at a karoake bar.  We're going to have to rely on sexercise if we plan on having any kind of cardio work out!    "You wanna make a bet?" "Sure, how much?" "One hundred THOUSAND dollars!" "How about fifty bucks?" "mmm okay."

      I'm falling apart.  I can't feel the left side of my face because my wisdom tooth is raping my gums and it's caused my whole face to go numb...except for the searing pain every time I eat, smile, breathe, etc.  I can't walk because my toenail seems to be ingrown?  EW and OW!!! I'm pretty sure within the next 2 hours it's going to get infected, spread gangrene up my leg and I will be peggin it for Hawaii.  Won't that be sexy?  Hey, check out that hot albino chick with the wooden leg... must be from Wisconsin!  9 DAYS!!!!!!!!!!!

      There must be something in the water.    A co worker of mine asked me out today.  out of the blue just started emailing me about how 'gorgeous' i am.  We've always joked around and stuff, but i never really took it as anything serious.  and now i feel retarded around him.  then Bloomington boy Josh starts text messaging all day, and I receive another email from Kenny (we all know I LOOOOVE kenny!! ) saying how much he wants to meet me.  I got macked on by DILF of the YEAR Ryan, who plays on a rival softball team (found out tonight he's NOT married after all... he's 26 and divorced...wife cheated on him)  he's very cute.  The owner of Diamonds told me I'm the "Cutest girl in the WORLD" and bought me free pichers all night.  THEN, in a drunken haze,I ask 8 Mile what he  really  thinks about me.. because half the time i'm wondering if he can even stand me.  He says "Serious  serious  sexual attraction to you".  Who DOESN'T he have a serious sexual attraction to?  I mean seriously.  Although, since we already got that sexual tension out of the way and it wasn't very good, it was not quite the answer I was expecting from him...  I'm drunk. I'm tired.  I have rollerblading, tennis and softball with funquita tomorrow.  I need to get some sleep or i think I just might die.   p.s. I emailed my resume for the Bloomington position today, wish me luck!

      Two Words:  FOOD COMA  I ate way way way... WAY... too much this weekend.  I wonder if I can make it until the end of the week without another meal?   Had a pretty sedate weekend.  Stayed in with a very ill Spooner Friday night.    New favorite Movie of the Week:  Miracle  .  Awesome movie, cute hockey players an extra bonus ; )    Saturday Night - Hit Stonebank Days... which, well, sucked royal ass.  Luckily the 3 trays of jello shots we downed at the cookout beforehand kicked in just in time to make it bearable.  Watched 8 Mile make out with a 37-year-old-so-NOT-a-MILF for a  good 2 hours.  His defense?  "She had pretty eyes!" .  Good God.  We'll let this one slide considering he was so wasted he passed out mid sentence with the phone attached to his ear.    Sunday - Bright and early, medicated ourselves  w/ The Best Hangover Cure in the World (McDonald's Breakfast),  and prepared to watch Spooner's sail boat race.  After and hour of ringtone previewing and still no sign of sailboats, 8 Mile and I decided a 3 hour nap was a much better way to pass the time.    Tonight went to graduation party for Red's kids.  Since when did kids start 'graduating' from grade school?  When, huh?  I had to wait 18 years for a graduation party, I think everybody should have to.  Anyway it was an odd party... the guest list including ex strippers, ex porn stars, and 5 year old boys who liked to grope grown woman.  After starting a cake fight (Funquita's doing), we decided it was time to go.  Went back to Funquitas and Highlighed my hair... I'm blonde(ish) now!!!  Looks good, I think.  I'll have to get a couple more opinions before I'm comfortable with saying I look good lightheaded =)

      Had a fairly relaxing night tonight.  Chilled with Funquita and watch The Tempations movie while stuffing our faces w/ pizza and ice cream (NOT on the 'Ways to Lose Weight for Hawaii' diet), Then hit the Main Stage for the celebration of 8 Mile's long awaited EMPLOYMENT.  He has made for 1 full week at a job and has another one lined up for next week.  Atta boy!   It was not much fun,  I am not too impressed with the new element he's hanging around... hootchie skank whores who are all about coke,catfights, and letting their fake boobs and love handles hang out.  DEFINITLY not cool.    Had a chat with my pal Mekka today... think I might be moving down to Bloomington.  He says there's still plenty of openings and my name is on the list....

      I don't look cute today.  I haven't slept in days, my hair looks like blah, I have no makeup on.  I was very pleasantly surprised/flattered when Spooner and I were taking cover from the rain on our lunch break and a TOTAL DILF gave me a quadruple take, smile AND the backwards glance as he walked away to his awaiting ride with his business partner. Spooner thinks he was mid-late 30's, I say late 20's, early 30's.  Either way he was very scrumptious.  Ahhh... if only I could just open my mouth and TALK when opportunities like that arise...

      I love black guys.  Know why?  Because they will hit on anyone and not make them feel dirty about it.  I got hit on by the McDonalds Drive Thru guy this morning, and, even though he works at McDonald's and is probably a Lo-HOO-oo-ser.... he was cute and it totally made my day.  God bless those little ego boosts....

      I'm going to be unemployed in 2 months.  I've known this since March, but somehow it took this long to sink it.   The "Unemployement" people met with us today.  They called us "dislocated workers".  I like that.  I'm not going to be unemployed, I'm going to be dislocated.    Until now I was counting on severence and unemployement coming so I've been bling blinging away.... like the $100/wk unemployment check I'll be getting is gonna get me far.  Not to mention I'm supposed to be saving for Hawaii.  Good God. I think they wrote this song for me, check it:    Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suits (With Da Gucci Suits) Ain't got no job, but I stay sharp (Ehh-Ehh Ehh-Ehh, I Stay Sharp) Can't pay my rent, cause all my money's spent (I Can't Pay My Rent) But that's okay, cause I'm Still Fly (Uh,Uh, Damn! Cause I'm So Fly)  Got a quarter tank of gas - in my new E class (In My E-Class Benz) Cause that's alright, cause I'm gon' ride (Hmm-Mmm) Got everythang - in my momma name (We Got Everythang, In My Momma Name) But I'm Hood Rich - dadah-dadah da-dah da-dah da-dah (Uh-Huh!)  Get your car *cuh-ck-cuh-cuh* car play gems gone shine Instead momma get a bling - baby girl let's ride (Let's Ride) You a number one stunna, and we gon' glide and go straight to the mall and tear down the inside Do that Prada, Gucci, full length leather Bourbon's cool or Coogi sweater (Sweater) Twenty-inches pop my feather - the Birdman daddy I fly in any weather Alligator seats with the head in the inside Swine on the deck, G-wagon is So Fly Number one don't tingle and twist it When it come to these cars I am that nigga The *cuh-ck-cuh-cuh* Coogi with a matching interior Three wheel ride with the tire in the middle It's Fresh and Stunner and we like brothas We shine like paint daddy - it's our Summer   With my $80 sunglasses, $300 cell phone, endless "shopping quickies" and rock star partying... and today I was just thinking "I really need an i-pod".  NEED?! 4 cd's on an mp3 player just isn't enough for me.  I need 10,000 songs on it and that's final, no negotiations.  What is  wrong with me ?!  Seriously. I better come into some inheritence or streetwalker position real quick!

Yeah - something in common with my father!!   =)*   Pet Peeve of the Night   Men who feel they have to use "Hun", "babe" or "sweetie" after EVERY SINGLE sentence while im-ing me.

       5.  The amount of sleep I've been getting these past few weeks    apparently partying like a rock star doesn't agree with my immune system.  4. My roommate WHISTLING incessantly while I'm within a 3 mile radius     Like right now.  Leave the song alone, dude!  FOR REAL!  3.  People who make me feel like kaka for sucking at darts   So what?!? I will kick your ASS in air hockey!  2. Thongs designed for 8 year olds... and the parents that allow that nonsense in their homes  what kind of sick fuck thought of that anyway?    1.  My place of employement changing my hours to 7-5   yes, that's right. Starting tomorrow I alone have mandatory 9 hour days.  That is homosexual beyond repair. That is the Kahuna of Kaka.  That is.... TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!!!!

      I'm crippled.  4 hours of Tekken 3 matches the other night has left me with a callous on my thumb the size of Texas and major inflammation of my carpel tunnel however you spell it problem.   "At least you don't have TMJ!" Slick Nick tells me after I share my inability to grip things for long periods of time.  What a Fauker.  He has ever so grandly nicknamed me "Booty" and my ass is now the topic of every conversation amongst the greasers.   Speaking of Booty, Bootycall Bryan has been blowing up my phone for the past two weeks.  What is it about men than make them call MORE when you avoid their calls???  Women (most  women..well..SOME women) can at least take a hint.  I can't tell if BCB is in serious denial, serious determination or just seriously dense.    My throat is killing me.  The Fabulous 4 are all down for the count - Me, Spooner, 8 Mile and Spammy.  Guess we better stop those crazy orgies.  Or Maybe I should take it as a sign that we didn't go to our weekly binge drinking softball event and go to bed early?!?!?  What a concept.

      July 23rd section 3, row 2, seats 9 & 10 =)   It was my first time to see Prince and one of the most wonderful times I have ever experienced. I had a date with this wonderful girl that I had never met before and took her to the show. Everything was so perfect. Prince, the band and especially the crowd. We were right up center stage where prince sat when he read the magazine of himself and tossed it into the crowd just 1 seat in front of us. The whole moment was beautiful and my mind will never let go of it.   I want to thank everyone on this site for bringing back my favorite moment in life that I have ever had and I want to thank Prince and the NPG for giving me the real full life experience. I especially want to thank the gorgeous lady Katie for joining me on this date and showing me how fun and loving life can really be. Thank you all again and keep the spirit and hope alive!!    ken

      So I'm on my way down to Chicago for this Prince concert, right?  I get to the train station and realize I  don't have my I.D    Well that's just wonderful, considering I a.) Need the I.D to get on the TRAIN and b.) Need the I.D. to get into any club in Chicago.    So I call KEF in a panic, and he's like... HEY!!  wait a minute!  My friend just left her I.D. in my car last night! She kinda looks like you!  It could work!  Freaky things about this chick's I.D.:  -Her first name is the same as my middle name -Her last name has the same first two letters as my last name  -Her street name was almost the same as my first name  -She had the same face shape (kind of), same hair color, same eye color, was the same height and weight and wore contacts   Now how weird is that???  I must be the only 25 year old to have to use a FAKE I.D!!!  Prince was absolutely fantastic.  We had 2nd row seats, center stage... just fabulous.  I could have practically licked his 3 inch heeled boots if I wanted to.... Um, no, just kidding about that.  Anyway, we didn't get to go back stage and we didn't see him at the 'after party' .... and the VIP Service was pretty non-existent...but we had a blast anyway!  I swear, KEF and I ... we're like peas and carrots.  =)    We hit up the after part at Excaliber (after wandering aimlessly around Chicago for at least a half hour)... P.S. Sorry Prince -but your club kinda sucks!!  It was very mellow, but that was good.  Kef and I did a whole lotta talking and he showed off his slick techno moves on the dancefloor.  Afterwards we walked and walked and WALKED around Chicago, sat by the lake.. ate breakfast at dunkin donuts...  and then spent and hour and a half at the train station taking pictures of ourselves with our picture phones.   I don't know if I've ever had so much fun with a guy??  Not in a long time anyway.  I think I have myself a new platonic friend.... I feel like I've known him my whole life!!  Anyway, it was a perfect low key night...     Number of Times We Got Lost on Foot or in Vehicle   18 MILLION at the very least!!! Effin Chicago...

Boys and motherfuckin' girls ("319, 319" "Cool") This is your captain with no name speakin' And I'm here 2 rock your world With a tale that will soon be classic About a woman U already know No prostitute she, but the mayor of your brain Pussy Control (Are U ready?)  Aaah, Pussy Control, oh Aaah, Pussy Control, oh  Our story begins in a schoolyard A little girl skipping rope with her friends A tisket, a tasket, no lunch in her basket Just school books 4 the fight she would be in One day over this hoodie She got beat 4 some clothes and her rep With her chin up, she scolded "All y'all's molded When I'm rich, on your neck I will step" And step she did 2 the straight A's Then college, the master degree She hired the heifers that jumped her And made everyone of them work 4 free? No! Why? So what if my sisters are triflin'?  They just don't know She said "Mama didn't tell'em what she told me 'Girl, U need Pussy Control'" (Are U ready?)  Aaah, Pussy Control, oh Aaah, Pussy Control, oh  Verse 2 Pussy got bank in her pockets Before she got dick in her drawers If brother didn't have good and plenty of his own In love Pussy never did fall And this fool named Trick wanna stick her Uh, talkin' more Schick than a Bic 'Bout how he gonna make Pussy a star If she come and sing a lick on his hit Pussy said "Nigga, U crazy if U don't know Every woman in the world ain't a freak U can go platinum 4 times  Still couldn't make what I make in a week So push up on somebody wanna hear that Cuz this somebody here don't wanna know Boy, U better act like U understand When U roll with Pussy Control" (Are U ready?)  Aaah, Pussy Control, oh Aaah, Pussy Control, oh  Breakdown (Are U ready 4 the best Pussy U ever felt?) {x2}  With one more verse 2 the story I need another piece of your ear I wanna hip U all 2 the reason I'm known as the player of the year Cuz I met this girl named Pussy At the Club International Balls She was rollin' 4-deep 3 sisters and a weepy-eyed white girl drivin' her haul I pulled up right beside her And my electric top went down I said "Motherfucker, I know your reputation And I'm astounded that U're here I fear U're lonely and U want 2 know A 12 o'clock straight up nigga That don't give a shit that U're Pussy Control Well I'm that nigga, at least I wanna be But it's gonna be hard as hell 2 keep my mind off a body That would make every rich man Want 2 sell, sell, sell (75, we need another.. 85, 85 here, sold!)

      Got to write my first letter of recommendation today!  I feel so important... more so, i'm honored that she wanted me to write it.  I did her good, too.. .DAMN proud of that letter!   Saturday went to Fish Days... boy THAT was fun.. Actually, it would have been a lot of fun had we not gotten lost and roll in 15 minutes before closing time.   Port Washington is a happenin town, eh?!  We went so Funquita could meet up with Freebird and, lucky me, he had a cute friend with him.  Didn't talk to him at all, but today he passed his digits to me thru Freebird and Funqui.  Hi, I'm in 3rd grade again.    Yesterday tooled out on the lake with Spooner, 8 Mile and MILF.  Got an HDI - Hot dog related injury - when Milf and I were catapulted off the inflatable hotdog at 60mph and her foot attacked my ear, causing my earring to practically slice my ear of.  Whatever made me think hoop earrings and innertubing mixed is beyond me.  That's the effin girl in me though.   We had fun... good times riding the big weiner ; )  Prince in 4 DAYS!!   A little nervous about meeting Kef!  It's just weird.  We've been phone buddies for so long... I mean, you know, that's my BRC Boyfriend!!!  It'll be fun, I know we'll have a blast.

      Why is it that I can have 18 guys interested in me, but when I see my ex with his beautiful new girlfriend I feel worthless?   (ahem, which by the way happened today)    Why is it that when 9 out of 10 guys in the room want to be near me,  I only want the attention of the one not interested?    Why is it that, after almost 3 years, I still compare everyone to my ex (same one as above)?   Because the only real thing he had going for him was his looks and his penis .... so... I should really STOP   Why is it that every guy I decide I'm interested in lives between 500 and 3000 miles away?   Why is it that I'm on this damn thing when I have so much shit to get done?!?!

      I just found out the prince concert is on the 23rd, not the 30th.. Yikes!  What am I gonna wear?!?!   I guess I should have known by the way you parked your car sideways That I wouldn't last.  See you're the kinda person That believes in makin' out once love 'em and leave 'em fast. I guess I must be dumb 'cus you had a pocket full of horses Trojan and some of them used but it was saturday night I guess that makes it alright and you say "what have I got to lose". And honey I say: Little red corvette baby, you're much too fast. Little red corvette you need a love that's gonna last. Guess I should have closed my eyes when you drove me to the place Where your horses run free 'cause I felt a little ill When I saw all the pictures of the jockeys that were there before me. Believe it or not I started to worry I wondered if I had enough class. But it was saturday night I guess that makes it alright  And you say baby have you get enough gas?" oh yeah.  Little red corvette baby, you're much too fast. Little red corvette you need to find a love that's gonna last. - oh no -  A body like yours ought to be in jail 'Cause it's on the verse of bein' obscene. Move over, baby give me the keys. I'm gonna try to tame your little red love machine. Little red corvette baby you're much to fast. . . Little red corvette honey  you gotta slow down. Little red corvette 'cus if you don't you're gonna run into the ground.

      I need to get a place of my own.    I have been roommate free for 2 days now and it is like HEAVEN.   No coming home to him and his gf bogarting the whole living/kitchen/breathing space area ... no having to feign interest in his long winded stories.... no having him tromp through my room with 18 loads of laundry every day.. because, you know, it would just be ridiculous for him to get that shit done when I'm gone, being that he has the whole daylight hours to twiddle his unemployed thumbs......      don't get me wrong, he's a super nice guy, but good god... i just like to be alone!   **Celebrity of the Day***   John Holmes aka Johnny Wadd:  1st porn star EVER + slept with over 14 THOUSAND women + was participant  of  horrific drug related slaughter +  Died of AIDS (go figure) = Celebrity of the Day!    What a winner!!     watch the movie, "Wonderland", featuring Val Kilmer, Kate Bosworth, Lisa Kudrow and Josh Lucas... highly recommended in a effed up kind of way

      So let me ask  you this....   What company in their RIGHT MIND would think that someone with a college degree and supervisor experience would jump at the chance to move to Bumfuck, IL  for a  COLLECTOR 1  position, making less money and crappier hours?!?!?!   The "Specialty" position I thought I was interviewing for turned out to be full for a couple weeks now, but I was "strongly recommended" for late stage or early stage collections.   EFF THAT!  Sorry, Kenny, but I am NOT moving down there to be demoted!

        Top 5 Reasons Katie Has No Business Being on a Moped     5. Couldn't for the life of me work the kickstand 4. Almost ran into a bus because I couldn't figure out how to turn  3. Missed a turn and got lost for 20 minutes (damn one way roads!!)  2. Locked myself out of the damn thing (how do you lock yourself out of a moped you ask?  read on...) 1. Forgot to release the gas while braking and almost skidded/flipped through a red light, nearly taking out pedestrians on the way....    yeah, i'm GOLDEN!      Okay, I'll FINALLY finish my Hawaii saga, since I just know y'all are sitting on the edge of your seats to find out how it ends =)*  Just kidding.  Also, check previous entry for added quotes and antecdotes.   Thursday   Indulge in th art of sleeping in for a change - I mean, we ARE on vacation, right?!?  Head for the moped rental place where we meet Nias from Iran who wants to be our new best friend.   He seems like a nice guy so we give him our number so we can party together.    On the way to Hounama Bay for another snorkeling session, we stop at the Aquariam and my brilliant ass locks my keys in the seat.   We hadn't even had the things for 10 minutes yet!  So Funquita gallantly rides solo back to the rental place for a spare set of keys.    After an hour, I'm starting to worry... I mean, the rental place  is  only 5 minutes away.   And just as i'm convinced she was in a horrible accident and nobody can contact me because my cell phone is locked in my moped,  some guy tells me "Be careful on those things, drivers don't watch out for you, they'll run you right off the road".  THANKS DUDE.  Luckily she finally shows up, she had made a wrong turn and ended up in Honolulu.  Lol.. sounds like something I would do (foreshadowing!).   We finish our trip to Hounama... snorkel for about  1/2 hour and decide the day sucks for it.  My mask kept attacking me and cutting off my air supply (seriously.. like some cheesy horror movie where an innocent victim is peacefully snorkling on the beautiful beaches of Hawaii and some heartless, sick, freakoid decided to cover her snorkel hole and watch her struggle, wide eyed behind her mask,  until she finally succumbs to defeat.. Then he steals her underwater camera full of  amazing sea life shots, which he eventually sells to National Geographic and makes millions.. meanwhile, the sharks are taking turns snacking on the poor girl and nobody will ever know what an amazing photographer she really was).  Or something like that.  Not wanting that to  happen, naturally, I sit on the freezing beach (yeah, it gets cold in Hawaii)  and listen to some middle aged, divorced guy yap my ear off about what the good clubs are around here and how he goes out every night and blah blah blah blah. ....  Run into Nias's FRIEND there, he also invites us out to play that night.  We are apparantly very popular with the middle east boys.    So we tool around town for a few hours on our BIG PIMPIN mopeds... Mingled with fellow mopeders.. had a couple adventures on the way.   As Funquita makes a sudden illegal left turn and I keep going straight, I realize... hmm.. I'm FUCKED.  Then I think - oh, it's simple!  I can go around the block and i'll be fine.. NO that didn't work, because there are so many one way roads in waikiki there IS NO BLOCK.  So 20 minutes later, as i was just about to ditch the bike and head off on foot, I finally roll into the Mirimar parking lot.     We decide enough of the mopeds and beautify ourselves for our last Hurrah on the town.      Key Moments of the Night  -Eating at the Big Italian Tomato.... with a cheesy keyboard soloist, plastic table cloths, a waitress that thought we were from "Wisconza?" , 2 toothless gpsy street rats next to us, customers bringing in their own beverages and drinking straight from the paper bag... oh, and don't forget the roaches!!  Oh yeah, that was a memorable restaurant.    -Getting kicked out of Moose McGuillicudy's for "standing in the walkway"... could they yell at us anymore that night??  Jesus....     Funquita Quote of the Night: "Hang loose muther fucker" M   - to the bartender who refused her a drink because she was standing on the wrong side of the bar and - AGAIN- blocking the walkway!  What a prick.     -Me Leaving my purse in the bathroom of the Red Lion, and some girl searching the whole place trying to match my I.D. to it's owner.  What a Sweetie!    -Psycho Boy getting mad at me because I was talking to him and then I decided to talk to Crack-a-Lackin for awhile.  "What's wrong with me?" "Do I have to wear a hat to make you like me"  "Do I have to grow a mustache"  " I thought we were getting along"  " Why are you talking to these guys" ... OH MY GAWD.    -Me, Crack-a-Lackin, Navy Davy and Funquita swimming in the ocean  -- OUCH... whole lot of reefer in there....   All in all it was an interesting night and a perfect ending to our vacation... Too bad it was spent with Crack instead of Tiki.. but oh well.  I would go back to Hawaii in a Heartbeat.. in fact.. I'm thinking, I just might want to live there... so perfect and peaceful and laid back (except for Moose's!)... No worries... ahhh.. They have a term called a Hawaii Minute... which means "We'll get there when we get there.. I have a term called Hawaii Expectations:  Sit back with your umbrella drink,  get some hony hony's, get leid and.... HANG LOOSE!

      Aloha!  Well, I'm back - Welcomed by coldness, rain and stale Milwaukee air... Grrrr!!!  I wish we would have missed the plane.  Hawaii =Heaven.   Wisconsin=Headache.  At least I have some fond images in my memory bank....  (get your bookmarks out, this is gonna be a long one!)    Saturday    Arrive in Honalulu at 5:30 p.m  (10:30 p.m. Milwaukee time).  Dismissing our jet lag (it IS Saturday night after all), we beautify ourselves as best we can and begin the hunt for some drinky drink.  A half hour of aimless wandering leads  us to the Hi Club.  After paper/scissor/rocking to see who entered first,  we boldly step forward - only to be stopped by a man in black sporting a headset a 'what do you think you're doing here' attitude.   Uh... drinking?   He proceeds to  radio in  our arrival to the bartender around the corner and usher us thru the crowd of a whole 10 people, like we've just interupted an underground coke orgy.  We settle uneasily at the bar,  and slowly realize that EVERYBODY in there is japanese - and NO ONE is too thrilled to see us.  After downing our (COUGH) $16 vodka cranberries (that were the size of a shot glass) we make a quick get away.  Effin Hi Club.  End up at theTiki Bar and Grille... laid back rooftop location with a one man band serenading us with soft hawaiian jams and  friendly  bartenders (fancy that!).  Sweet relief after our Hi Club experience.  We call it an early night and collapse into our welcoming beds at the Mirimar.      Quote of the Night:   "I like that brown bag"..... I say, while passing a store window with ALL BROWN BAGS  (Blaming it on the Jet Lag!    Note:  Clear Shoes = HIA (Hookers In Action) - BEWARE!      Sunday    Hit the beach (with tons o' sunscreen) followed with a jaunt thru the International Marketplace to get our souvenier shopping over with  International Marketplace:  Land  of pushy venders; shortcut to my mom's hotel, the beach, food,and a few bars.  We became very familiar with this area, after cutting thru it 18 times a day...  Hit up a rinky dink tiki hut  bar on our way to dinner (located in the...ta da!  International Marketplace).. get loopy on Hawaiian Teas (think fruitier Long Island Ice Teas).  Beat some Aussie Navy boys in a couple games of pool, Funquita hooks up with Mr. T- a big ol' black man (big as in TALL, not fat).  We try to get in at the Cheesecake Factory, can't stomach the 1 1/2  hour wait  so wind up at the Tiki Bar and Grill for some scrumptious dinner and souvenier coconut cups(!).     Funny of the Night:   Lisa reading the menu to an old guy - He just wanted better light, dude, he wasn't illiterate!  =)*   Run into Mr. T again on the way home, he's with Ferguson - Who came to Hawaii on vacation 3 years ago and forgot to go home.  I think to myself   I can do that! ...can't I???    Fergie prided himself on looking exactly like Donnie Wahlberg...who was my favorite New Kid back in the day.   Too bad Donnie is ugly now ... didn't have the heart to tell Fergie that.  Nonetheless, they were fun for a short while.       Monday  Rent a jeep (!!!!) from scary hairy dude.  Do we  really  need to know all about his girlfriend from  22 years ago  who is now on prozac?!?  I mean, really.  Almost die climbing  Diamond Head (Water: great idea during a 2 hour hike in 85 degree weather - who woulda thunk??), head to Honauma bay for ... SNORKELING!!!!  The most peaceful, amazing experience ... I want to live on the beach just so I can snorkel every day.   Funquita, this one's for You!   Don't step on me, in the Sea, Don't Step on me!!  Afterwards we pull a Sweetest Thing and change in the parking lot behind the jeep while singing along to blaring music.  Head for Honalulu for a Lobster dinner.  (  Can we get some service here?? HELLO??  )    Tuesday   Attempt to go to Pearl Harbor, can't stick around for the wait... Sister A-Lo has to get back for senior pics.     Sidenote:  A-Lo's photographer : Cosmo's appointed "Hawaii's Most Eligible Bachelor" 2 years ago, photographer for many models, including that new show America's Top Model.. or whatever.  Thinks my sister should be a model.  I hate my sister =)  A-Lo's Makeup Artist (Yes, she had a make up artist for her senior pics - can you believe that?!?!):   Pearl Harbor, Baywatch and that new show "Hawaii" are just a few big names making up her resume.  I was impressed/jealous that I never had such special treatment for MY pics..   Tuesday night:   Hit up Da Dawghouse... the local watering hole.  Turns out 40,000 Navy Boys were shipped in that same night,  and boy were they eager to give us attention.  Only met a few that were memorable though.  Cameron: Young Ray Liotta.  Yum.  Young, but fun.. only talked w/ us for a few minutes, but we did run into him again later that week.  Fell in lust with Island Boy.   He walked into the room like he owned it - knowing he was hot, but somehow oblivious to the stares he was getting.  He watched me for a good half hour and tripped over his tongue when he finally approached me.  After attempting conversation next to the blaring speakers, we took the talk outside - sneaking moments here and there since he was technically working.  It was the sweetest thing.  I regretfully declined a walk on the beach at bar time due to our early morning schedule, with a vow to meet up with him the following night to capture "my first good polynesian experience" on camera.  I never did though =( .   Now he's just a beautiful image that will have to stay etched in my memory...    Wednesday  After 2 1/2 hours of sleep, we drag our asses out of bed at 6 a.m. for the trek to Pearl Harbor.  We skip our planned surfing lesson and opt for a couple hours of floating sanctuary in the middle of the ocean instead.  **FUNNY OF THE DAY:  A wave catching my raft on the way to shore, picking me up and shooting me a good 5 feet before knocking me over***   Head out for a Luau .... Loong shuttle ride thru rush hour traffic, luckily we had the comic and musical entertainment of Cousin Spencer (our "escort").  "You're taste just like a mango... drop cuz I'm hungry!" ...He was a fun guy, had awesome lips - I was mesmerized by them as he leaned in to give me a  honi honi  as he was lei-ing me.  Mmmm..    The Luau was entertaining, even got to get up on stage and shake our ass.  Met Ruby and Sam, 2 girls from California.    Oh my GAWD!  They  like  were  SO much fun!  No, seriously, they were.  Exchanged #'s so we could hook up w/ them later.    Key Note:  "Dip the pee pee in the poi to make poo poo!"  pee pee = beef poo poo = appetizer poi = flavorless goo

      Our 2nd date...He stopped midstride to hold me tight And time could have stopped for all I cared  He calls me "Baby" and kisses me in public,  And I don't cringe or pull away  He calls me 3 times a day... And I can't wait to see him again  It's only been a week... but he thinks I'm 'the one' And I haven't been dying to escape  He's got beautiful eyes, a genuine smile And his scent will drive me wild  His favorite things about me  are my nails, personality and smile  He thinks i'm beautiful  When I'm on two hours sleep, smelling like campfire with afro hair and his oversized clothes  And when I'm lying next to him....  For the first time in a long time, I don't feel like I'm suffocating  Am I falling for this dude or what?!?!

I have another call"  - (come ON, people!!) 7.   "I mailed the payment yesterday, you should have it"  - In what WORLD does is take 2 days for mail to travel halfway across the country without priority mailing it?  Really, I'd like to know.   6.   "I have never had this problem with any other company"   Well, deal with it.  5.   "I spent too much money at Christmas/Vacation/Etc, can I have a 2 month deferral?"   Hey, buddy, no problem, in fact, take the whole year off if you want.  Fuckin idiot.  4.   "Some guy keeps calling, but he won't say who he's looking for"   It's a fucking RECORDING you dumbass.

      I told you I'd write you a poem. I'm doing it at work not at home:  I met you at Pfudpuckers over a year ago. At first I thought that you were a ho. But soon I realized you were nice and likable. Together you and I became double the trouble. It was okay cuz I discovered you were quirky. Atleast you don't make me eat beef jerky. You helped me stay away from a guy named Chris. You and I have even shared many a kiss. Sometimes we even fight like we're sisters. You borrowed me your shoes that gave me blisters. A short time ago we rang in the new year together. We'll be friends rain or shine, any kind of weather.

      wow, I'm really starting to sound bitter.  so let's take a minute to look at the positive things in my life.  1.  I am alive.  My health is good (well except for the constant pain in my knee).  2.  I have friends who love me and who mostly would do anything for me.  Friends who are there for me and want to see me happy.  Friends who look out for me and want to protect me.  Friends who miss me when I'm not around.  Friends who put up with me no matter how ridiculous I am being and friends who deal with my soap opera life.  3.  I have family who always love and support me no matter how disfunctional we are.  Family who picks me up when I need it and family who puts me in my place when my head gets too big.  4. I have a good job and work with a great staff of people whom I consider my friends.  Something I have been searching for for along time.  5.  I've got a roof over my head (for now) and a nice vehicle to tool around town in.  I don't go hungry and I have the luxury of buying what I want and going where I want.    6.  I'm intelligent, attractive and have a good sense of humor.  I have fun with most things I do and lead a very active life.  I've got a big heart and a lot of love to give someone.  All in all, life ain't so bad =)

       White Flag  by Dido  I know you think that I shouldn't still love you or tell you that. But if I didn't say it well I'd still have felt it, where's the sense in that I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder  Or return to where we were but  I will go down with this ship and I won't put my hands up and surrender  There will be no white flag above my door, I'm in love and always will be   I know I left too much mess and destruction to come back again  And I caused but nothing but trouble,  I understand if you can't talk to me again  And if you live by the rules of "it's over" then I'm sure that that makes sense but  I will go down with this ship and I won't put my hands up and surrender  There will be no white flag above my door, I'm in love and always will be   And when we meet, which I'm sure we will  All that was there, will be there still  I'll let it pass, and hold my tongue  And you will think, that I've moved on....   I will go down with this ship and I won't put my hands up and surrender  There will be no white flag above my door, I'm in love and always will be     August of 2004 this song came out.  It seemed to capture everything I was feeling at the time when S left.  It was a strange twist of fate that it played on the radio only moments after he walked out my door for the last time.  It was then that I knew it'd be fine and it was okay to still love someone even if they won't be there.  And once again six months later this song captures my thoughts.  S told me he would never say goodbye and I believed him.  He said he always wanted to be my friend, I believed him.  Again six months later M told me he'd never say goodbye and I believed him.  I have lost two people who were very close to me.  So here I sit pretending that I'm okay and if I saw either one I'd pretend everything was great, but it's just not.    I'm too afraid to get close to anyone.  To be free and open and let myself love.  I'm not afraid to fall in love, I'm afraid of loving too much.  I never gave care or worry to being vulnerable but now I try so hard to make people know that I don't care and I'm too strong to let anything get to me.  Well that's not true.  The only two people who I could talk to and who understood the real me are gone.  The ones who knew my insecurities and knew my thoughts before I even thought them.  How can I let another in?    "Better to have loved and lost then to never have loved at all" fuck that

      *begin rant* god, why is it that men think they can just grab/touch/feel a woman whenever wherever they feel like.  okay I can stand a touch on the arm or back and even the occasional squeeze around my shoulders.  But grabbing my ass is a whole other story.  That is what is considered a private part and is off limits for unsolicited groping.  Especially not from some random guy in the store!!!  And let me tell you, telling me I've got a sweet ass or big tits isn't a compliment and doesn't warrant a thank you,  unless you know me like that.  Men are so fucking clueless sometimes it's pathetic.  I'm so tired of having to fend off this kind of attention.    And the dude at the dance club...kissing me the way he did and pushing his dick into my leg like I'm some kind of whore for hire.  I actually thought he was a nice guy until I realized he was just another jackass looking to get laid.  And his friends, looking me up and down and asking him who this "sexy bitch".  As if sexy and bitch belong in the same sentence as a compliment?!?!? The only people allowed to call me a "sexy bitch" are my friends.  What ever happened to, 'hi my name is Tim, I'm Tom's friend" and shaking my hand?  What the f#%$?  Where's my knight in shining armor to fend off these jerks, I fight my own battles , but for once I'd like to drop the act and let someone take care of me.   Someone to fight for my honor damn it.  Where have all the cowboys gone?  The men who would start a bar room brawl with a  man just for looking at my tits.   *end rant*

      hey beautiful-  let's shed some light Ignoring the adding of the 1 it becomes more obvious, multiplying by 80 and 250 is same as multiplying by 20,000 which moves the first three digits to the left 4 positions to the left, and doubled.   Adding the last four digit twice leaves them in same position but doubled.   Dividing then by two you end up with your number.  The adding of the 1 just adds 250 to the result, and thus you have to subtract it out later before the divide by 2.  ......love, Uncle Chuck

      Here is a math trick so unbelievable that it will stump you.   1. Usa a calculator, not an adding machine. (you won't be able to do this one in your head)  2. Key in the first three digits of your phone number (NOT the area  code)  3. Multiply by 80  4. Add 1  5. Multiply that number by 250  6. Add the last 4 digits of your phone number  7. Add the last 4 digits of your phone number again.  8. Subtract 250  9. Divide number by 2    Do you recognize the answer?

      I can't decide what's harder, quitting smoking or quitting someone you love.  Craving a cigarette is much the same as craving attention from someone you love.  Wanting to pick up that pack and light one up mirrors the desire to pick up the phone and call that special someone.  Taking that first drag and inhaling the sweet taste feels just as good as hearing their voice as they answer the phone.     it's all bout willpower. Controlling yourself to not buy that pack, to not bum that cigarette, to not steal that drag.  Convincing yourself that you don't need it, you don't want it and you're better off without it.  Controlling yourself not to make that phone call, not to send that email or text message, and not to go to the places you think they might be.  Convincing yourself that you don't need them, you don't love them and you will be fine without them.    Then after a period of time you begin to forget why you smoked in the first place.  You forget why that person was so special to you.  Your health improves.  Your heart stops hurting.  You remember getting winded walking up the stairs and the coughing fits you suffered.  You remember how they would push your buttons and all the fights you ever had.  Until you reach the point of not caring about those things and only remembering fondly how great a cigarette tasted with a beer, after a meal or after sex.  You remember how that person brightened your morning, afternoon or night just by being around.  But it's okay cuz you don't need that cigarette or their love anymore.  Until....you are faced with the temptation once again.  Someone is smoking and it smells so good.  Just one drag.  You see something that reminds you of that lost love and your dying to tell them about it.  One email wouldn't hurt.  So you slip and have a cigarette.  So you send that email.  As long as you don't start the cycle over, what's the harm?  But it's an addiction...one slip leads to two and then to three and then suddenly you're into old habits again.  I can't decide what's harder, quitting smoking or quitting someone I love.

      i hate it when you let yourself go with someone despite every thought in your head telling you to stop.  canoodling with a stranger is something you do when your the ripe age of 21, kissing some boy in the bar seems like the thing to do.  then you hit an age where it's not but it still happens.  on that rare occasion that it does it's exciting, it's fun and it's delicious.  until the inevitable happens.  he asks you to come home with him, your ex walks in or worse, his ex walks in.  me, my luck, all 3 events simultaneously occurred.  so close on the dance floor i could   feel   the question coming as I spot my ex watching me from a nearby booth.  i pull him off the floor back to the table as i plow over his ex.  I'm battin' a thousand here.  she turns to berate me for spilling her drink and instead starts to cry as she sees "her" man holding   my   hand.  he dismisses her and kisses me hard.  whispers in my hear that he wants to take me home and well...use your own imagination.  i'm appalled and know my face shows it as my ex saunters up to say hello.  meanwhile this girl is still standing there crying and swearing and asking "who's this whore?".  if i cover my eyes will they still be able to see me?   scanning for the quickest exit, i try to wriggle my way out of dude's grasp.  luckily Teaser walks up and grabs my arm to pull me on the dance floor.  Thank you so much DJ for playin' my song =)    As for the dude, he went home alone that night...although i'm sure he had a late night visit from water works.

      I spent an hour last night watching a little program called "The Surreal Life".  I've come to the following conclusions: Porn King's have feelings too...I just wanna be loved, is that so wro-o-onG? There is such thing as too much make up and psychics just might be the devil themselves. Vanilla Ice has a sour taste in his mouth and it's very obnoxious.  I wasted an hour of my life that I'll never get back but I was so entranced with these people and amazed at how ridiculous they are/were and will continue to be!!!  And just who the hell is Trishelle?   Tune in this Tuesday if you missed it!!!!

      A very hung over me staggered out of my ultra-comfy bed yesterday morning and stared in the mirror.  Can I sacrifice a shower for 20 more minutes of sleep?  Of course!!  I get to work knowing that in 8 short hours I can go home and crawl back into bed.  Then the phone starts and disaster strikes.  My day is filled with running in and out of meetings, consoling and apologizing to customers and trying to find a resolution to a monstrous problem that was caused by someone else.  Slowly I realize that I haven't had time to get anything done and I have a stack of work to be tended to.  The decision to stay late is made and suddenly I have completed a 12 hour day with one short break for lunch.  Depleted of all my energy and mental capacity at a negative I head for home.  Leaving work at the absurd hour of 8pm, I realized that there was nobody out there wondering why I wasn't home and worrying if something had happened.  Nobody knew nor cared that I had one of the worst days possible.  I arrived home safely and staggered through the house to the bedroom, I stopped to stare in the mirror.  A shower would have felt like heaven right then.  Instead I opt for a cup of hot cocoa and a cuddle with Teddy (Teddy as in Mr. Teddy P. Bear) before drifting off to sleep.  I betcha Teddy wondered and worried about me not being home.

      He gave me up and I still felt the chains. I struggled to release myself, but couldn’t. You were there pulling them tighter. He gave me up and I saw you there. You held the door open for me. I followed you in, too weak to fight. You showed me all I am and held me up. He gave me up and I let you keep me. You slipped away, not mine to have. I reached for the chains, then realized I was free.

      My relaxing weekend, not so relaxing.  I had a cigarette last night, but to my own defense I was in a high state of distress.  It didn't taste good and I only smoked half of it.  Today I sit here wishing I hadn't smoked that cigarette, wishing I could go back and change that one tiny event.  Why doesn't life come with a rewind button?

         I spent the last 3 years running to the edge of a cliff then stopping before jumping, then turning around and running away.  Last night I found myself standing on the edge of that cliff, something drew me there.  The sound of the waves crashing on the rocks, the smell of the salt in the air, the thrill of making that jump ...100 feet to the cold sea water below.  The thought of surviving such a jump and the excitement I would feel as the water envelopes me.  The chance that the fall could be devastating keeps me on the edge of the cliff.   As I look over it I realize I will never know what's in the water below unless I jump...then suddenly someone appears behind me.  I turn around and am startled by them, I jump back and tumble over the cliff.  All I can think about as I descend is where the water will carry me.

      Alas, it is Friday again.  Looking forward to a nice relaxing weekend filled with so many things to do.  Tonight marks the return of my truck, no more zipping around town with D's cute little 5-speed Honda Civic which he had so gallantly let me borrow while mine's in the shop.  Then it's of to Walker's Point for a "keg party" courtesy of some girl I don't even know.  Hopefully the roomie's ex will not stumble upon me there.   My Saturday is jam packed with obligations, a pool tournament I said I'd play in, a friend in town to be visited, a birthday party to be dropped in on and a night of dancing with the girls has been promised.  So what on Sunday?  My body collapses from overuse.  I think that should be a fitting end to the weekend considering there is no Packer game to watch (thanks Favre)!  But inevitably I will receive a phone call sometime between now and then disrupting my plans for a peaceful Sunday.  The new boy has given up on trying to be fit into my schedule, I think it's better that way...who has time to date when they are staying active to keep themselves from being lonely....hmmm sounds like a vicious circle if you ask me.

      If he doesn't know he's my best friend, he's a fool. The closeness we've got is like no other I've known. If he doesn't know I'm in love with him, he's blind. The way he looks at me makes me melt. If he doesn't know I think about him all day, he hasn't a clue. The thought of seeing him again makes me smile. If he doesn't know I want to be close to him, he's in the dark. The time we spend together is too short. If he doesn't know he's my best friend, I have to make sure he does.   What is this poem about? a.  My best friend, whom I'm secretly (or not so secretly in love with) b.  My dog c.  My Teddy Bear d.  The dude down the road who tries to peek in my windows as he walks the dog.  Answer to follow next week.

       Why do smart women still smoke?  By JENNIFER PIRTLE   Posted: Jan. 10, 2004  Caren Chesler, 40, is no dummy. She's well aware of the health risks associated with smoking: She lost her father to a form of esophageal cancer thought to be linked to cigarettes.    Yet she continues to light up - sometimes smoking as many as 35 cigarettes a day.  "I think about my father's death, and the increased probability that I'll get cancer," she says. "Does it make me stop?" she asks. "No."  Like Chesler, most female smokers can practically recite the statistics in their sleep:  1.  They run up to six times the risk of heart attack that non-smoking women do.  2.  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women and will kill an estimated 68,800 women this year (about 29,000 more than those who will die of breast cancer).  3.  Smoking-related illnesses, such as lung cancer and heart disease, will kill close to 178,000 women each year.  4.  Women who smoke have an increased risk of cervical cancer and difficulty conceiving. Despite these sobering statistics, a quarter of all American women in their 30s smoke, the highest percentage of any age group. (Twenty-one percent of women smoke overall.)  What's behind our predilection to puff? Experts say there are a number of factors that can make it extra tough for women to kick the habit.  In fact, women are one-third less likely to be successful at stopping than men, according to Saul Shiffman, director of the Smoking Research Group and the Clinical Psychology Center at the University of Pittsburgh.  Why do women find it so challenging to give butts the boot, and can you become a quitter for life?   "I'm afraid I'll pile on pounds"  A significant number of female smokers say they want to quit but are afraid they'll gain weight if they do. (One of the reasons teen girls start smoking in the first place is to avoid gaining weight.) They're right to be concerned. Smokers tend to have diets low in fruits and vegetables and high in fat, according to Nancy Betts, professor of nutrition and health sciences in the College of Education and Human Sciences at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. Plus, nicotine speeds up your metabolism, so when you quit, your body slows down the rate at which it burns calories.  Smoking may also affect levels of serotonin, the feel-good hormone that regulates mood and appetite (in fact, smoking itself may act as a mild anti-depressant).  When you come off cigarettes, it's tempting to reach for sweets and carbs in an attempt to improve your mood. It all adds up to a possible weight gain of five to 15 pounds, according to Robert Klesges, lead author of the book "How Women Can Finally Stop Smoking."  It's no surprise that women who try to quit often consider starting a diet at the same time, but experts say this double-barreled approach will probably fail. "Women need to focus all their energies on quitting smoking first and worry about the weight gain later," says Klesges. "In fact, I tell them not even to step on the scale for six weeks."   "I'll become a total crab."  Men who quit smoking get cranky, too, but women seem to be hit with an extra whammy.  The mood-elevating properties of nicotine are stronger for us, making our pre-quit highs higher and post-quit lows lower. Plus, the side effects of stopping - lowered concentration, heightened anxiety, depression and irritability - often mimic the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and, in a cigarette catch-22, PMS often makes those symptoms worse.  About 60% of relapses occur during the first 14 days after you've kicked the habit, according to Klesges. "Women should quit smoking a few days after their period ends so they're not hit with PMS at the same time," he says.  Even so, you may feel extra vulnerable to remarks from others during the first two weeks after you stop. While a man might brush it off when a friend says, "You're so grouchy now that you've quit," statements like that can cause some women to ditch their efforts. Instead, say: "The first few weeks are the hardest, so I hope you'll understand if I'm stressed."   "I've tried - and I can't"  Stress reduction is often cited as one of the biggest benefits of smoking. A fight with a friend, a harried day or an unexpected traffic jam become reasons to light up. Indeed, a deep drag can help a smoker chill out, concentrate better and feel more energetic when she's tired.  Once nicotine enters the brain, it results in a temporary change in chemistry that the smoker experiences as enhanced pleasure, decreased anxiety and a state of calm alertness.  "It goes straight into the brain in a very immediate, sharp spike," says Corinne Husten, medical officer of the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) Office of Smoking and Health. "It's much more reinforcing than other drugs, such as heroin, that have a slower delivery to the brain."   "My friends all smoke"  A strong sense of connection often comes with smoking. While tobacco company ads 30 years ago emphasized the independent woman ("You've come a long way, baby!"), today's product pitches feature groups of gregarious friends chatting, laughing and bonding over cigarettes. For many women, kicking the smoking habit often means limiting contact with or moving away from those relationships - a decision that may be as tough as actually giving up cigarettes.  Although having pals who smoke can make it more difficult to quit, it's not impossible, says Steve Wood, a therapist who counsels patients at the live-in nicotine addiction program at St. Helena Center for Health in Napa Valley, Calif.  "Ask your friends to work with you by not smoking around you and by certainly not) offering you a cigarette," he advises. "As you continue to succeed, you'll get a lot of reinforcement from others wanting what you have."   "Smoking is my identity"  "Women almost always start smoking in their teen years because they want to be cool or sexy," says Wood. In fact, many women in their 30s who light up started as teenagers. And the rebellion that played a part in the first puff remains decades later, but with a slightly different face.  "The young rebel is closely connected to a strength I see in successful adult women who smoke: They are highly independent decision-makers in both career and family" Wood explains. "The rebel transforms over time and becomes the modern woman managing life in the early 21st century-career, mother, wife, often divorced, and on her own or never married."  Smoking is a constant for these women. So while they might change their romantic relationships or move or get a new job, cigarettes remain, literally, as pocket-size friends. "The one companion for these women throughout the years is their cigarettes," says Wood. "They are, in some ways, more dependable than these other aspects of their lives."

      Hmm, had a very accomplished weekend.  Had my eyes measured for contacts (a first by the way), bought a dishwasher (to jason's own chagrin as he busted his chin trying to bring it in the house for me, as dave collapses from laughter), rearranged my bedroom (i never knew what a hercules i could be), got my mattress delivered (heavenly comfortable - thank you so much Nutter Butter), made a trip to the bank (takin' care of that negative balance), exchanged some clothes at the store (daddy's gained some weight), washed laundry (as it now sits in a heap), saw a movie (Big Fish...good show, highly recommend), had a few drinkies (and seriously only a few as I was out in BFE), wasted 3 1/2 hours watching the Packers get stomped on (Yea Favre).   All in all, not a bad way to spend the weekend.  Oh and I met a boy.  That's probably the best thing I did all weekend.  Although by this time next week, I'll probably be saying otherwise =)

      I've just been informed that my good friend's ex wants to hook up with me.  I didn't know her when they were dating and I don't know him at all now.  They spent 6 years of their lives together until she called the wedding off...2 weeks before they were to tie the knot.  I met her a few short months after that occured.  Now, I would never even consider dating a friend's ex but where are these lines drawn?  I met this guy once when out with her and barely spoke 5 words to him.  Recently I saw him out and had a brief conversation.  If I didn't know who he was I would have been interested.  What would have happened if I would have met him and started dating him, only to find out that it was her ex?  He could be my soul mate, my one and only, my true true love.  Here we go again, I only want what I can't have and once I have it I don't want it.  (Of course the exception to that rule would be when MM (Matthew McConaughey) appears at my door proclaiming his love for me, I'd drop everything for that day.)    Oh well, maybe I'll just go to the Sizzler with the guy at the mattress store and call it a day.

      I spent the day at home today, sick.  All I did was spend the last 7 or so hours on the couch thinking of all the things I could and should be doing.  I was guilt ridden about not going to work and lying around.  Why is it that these days you can't even take a day for yourself without feeling bad about it?  It's like we're trained to think that we always have to be productive and anytime wasted on resting is just that, wasted time.  I thought about how I should be cleaning my bedroom and getting it ready for my bed delivery.  I thought about the laundry piling up behind my door.  I thought about the dishes in the sink, the bills on the table and the garbage overflowing in the kitchen.  Thought about the trip to the bank that needs to be made, thought about the oil change my truck needs, thought about the clothes I need to return and the groceries I need to go get.  Hmmph.  Got nothing done but relaxing and watching reruns of The Cosby Show.

      I once went on a date with a guy who was so gorgeous I couldn't even look him in the eye.  I fidgeted my way through dinner and tripped over my own feet on my way to the bathroom.  Why was I so nervous?  This guy couldn't hold a conversation longer than my pinky finger and wouldn't stop staring at my chest.  He was 24 years old, lived with mom and dad, was between jobs and talked an awful lot about partying with his boyz.  Not exactly a catch by my standards.  But yet I couln't get him off my mind after the date...oh yea and he never called for a second.  I once went on a date with a guy who was so average looking I found myself flirting with the waiter.  I drifted in and out of the conversations and excused myself twice to call my friends and make plans for later that night.  Why was I so disinterested?  This guy told me about his career, his friends and his family.  He asked me questions about myself and complimented my smile.  He was 28 years old, owned a condo downtown, had a bachelors degree with a career to boot.  I didn't think twice of him after I headed out to the bars with the girls...and it took him 3 unanswered phone calls before he left me alone.

      Quit smoking for the New Year.  So far so good, even made it through a night at the bar and a night bowling with no cigarettes.  Now I've just got to make it through the next 60 years of my life...that shouldn't be too hard!!!

      I woke up this morning and cursed myself as I walked past the mirror and noticed a new crinkle that cuts across my nose.  My hair is the texture of straw that has been baked in the sun for days and the skin under my eyes is the color of a fading bruise.   My over processed hair and under pampered skin is telling me to slow down and stop hanging out in smoky bars.  You might wonder how one person can come to so many conclusions in one brief 3 second glance in the mirror...well as a woman, let me tell you that it's not that difficult.  If you've ever "tripped" you've probably been told not to look in the mirror, your face suddenly becomes a sea of endless pores, dirt, and oil patches.  You eyes look to be the size of golf balls and shine so bright you could probably light up the room.  Every hair on your head is visible as a single strand and if you get close enough you can see the hole in which the root has attached itself to your head.  These are the things I notice as I look in the mirror, every change that has come in the middle of the night.  Today, my shoulder aches a little more and my knee buckles as I bend over to put on my boots.  Why didn't I listen when my mom would tell me to take care of myself while I was young so as not to regret it when I'm older?  I'm 27 years young and feel a though someone snatched my young body and replaced it wih that of an aging football player.  You might think that today is my birthday the way I speak, but it's not.  Today is just Tuesday.

      ... Every time I read that poem it sends a certain chill down my back.  I must have written it 7 or 8 months ago when Scuba Steve broke my heart for like the 5th time.  It's a wonder I ever survived any of it.  I remember the feelings I had and how desolate I remained.    Now I read it and feel as though I'm looking in on someone else's life and I'm invading their privacy.  It just shows me that if you look ahead and keep your eyes on the road things will always get better. Feelings will only hold you for as long as you let them.  Moving on isn't something you do in a day, it's something you are doing every day.

      In an effort to save what I could from my hard drive as my computer is attacked by a nasty nasty virus I came across this poem.  I don't know when exactly I wrote it but I decided to post it before I delete it.   Time has it’s own Pace   Time moves so slow. Pain overtakes every minute. I can’t take much more. This is where I will remain. Caught somewhere in between. I want it to be over and find my way ahead.  Time moves so fast. Pain takes on a new form. I feel nothing but awe. You aren’t here with me. Time has taken it all away. I look back on it all and can’t see much. There’s a fog that has covered the past.  Time stands still. I look forward to see my future. I feel excited and nervous. I want it all at once. Who will be by my side. I lost my way again, but the path remains ahead. I try to go back, but the road has disappeared. I walk to nowhere.    Yesterday was Today and Today was Tomorrow.

      ... oh my God.  Ever talk to someone and have your shirt involuntarily pop open?  you're going about your business when poof your shirt just decides that it's going to open up and let your tits hang out in all their glory.  Good thing I wore a cute bra today...I don't know who was more embarrassed Gary or me!!  Many  men have seen my breasts before but jeez I'm at work for crying out loud.  I haven't let the girls out in a while, maybe they are just starving for attention and felt the need to remind me that they are here.  It's pool night so I suppose I can sport some cleavage tonight, plus we are playing the men's team so that would give me a leg up...particularly the short one in the middle ;).

      My big gay friend Mishko is after my new guy!  I never knew my showing up somewhere with a guy could cause such an uproar!  It's like people didn't realize that I may actually have what it takes to snag a man.  It's been so long, hell I didn't know I did.  Bay wanted to ditch her fiance for him and flirty Aaron kept close tabs on my movements.  Big gay Mishko wanted his phone number and proceeded to try and get me drunk to get me out of the picture.  Made for quite the interesting evening.  Even the Urban brothers were a bit in awe of the antics going on around them.  Too bad I still haven't made up MY mind.

      People are intimidated by me.  People come to me when they need someone to fight for them, whether it's dealing with a vendor at work or it's returning faulty merchandise to a store that won't take it.  I am not afraid to speak my  mind whether you want to listen or not and rarely do people get the opportunity to take advantage of me.  This year alone I've had 2 crappy meals comped and gift certificates given to me as compensation, I've gotten my cell phone company to agree to waive replacement charges for my defective phone, I've gotten my insurance company to lower my rates simply because I didn't' want to pay the higher ones.  I made a man feel two inches tall after he performed an unsolicited grope, I stood up to a mechanic  who thought that because I was a woman I knew nothing about the repairs he did and he could charge me what he wanted in the end I paid half of what he was billing me ... I could go on, however the list is too long.  I may sometimes let people take advantage of me but usually this is so that in the end I can get what I want.  A very manipulative minx I am, but a push over I am not.  I don't know why I even care if people perceive me as a push over, maybe that's not such a bad thing considering I'm more of the in your face type person and sometimes worry about others perceptions.  But meek I am not.    'Nuff said?  God I'm a bitch.

      At certain times in life certain things occupy most of your focus.  Currently my focus is work and that just sucks.    I'm not a very girly girl but I tell ya what a facial, a pedicure and manicure, an hour in a steam room topped with a hot oil deep stress relief massage sounds like absolute heaven.  Where's my sugar daddy?  I think I need a vacation, I can't wait for Hawaii in June.

      The problem with being good at something is that people always come to me for help or with questions.  Not that I mind helping other people, it's just that I'd rather teach them to do it for themselves then have them come to me each time.  But it's easier for them to just come to me and have me do it for them.  It's almost like as an adult they feel like they don't need to learn anymore.    What would have happened to you if every time you needed your shoe tied your mom or dad or teacher or friend did it for you and you never learned?   And what if your mom never taught you how to use a fork and knife, she spoon fed you all the way until you left the house?  I'm constantly called upon to format a spreadsheet, upload to an ftp site, fix a crashed computer, write a letter of thanks, research a product, call a vendor with a stern hand...when does it end?    Then there's the problem with being on a committee is that the person who's got the best ideas and the skills to get things done is that they get stuck with all the work.  Hmm I think a told you so is in order to my boss.  People only do what they can get away with doing and let other people pick up the slack.  Seems to be a problem with society as a whole.  Now I'm just rambling, so I'm going to go sit and the corner and ponder why it is that I couldn't have been just another D student.

      I must print a retraction.  I am indeed the person at fault for fucking up.  An email was sent at 5:32 on Friday requesting the proper product.  Gee forgive me for not staying to receive that email. The nerve of me to leave at 5:15 on Friday.  Hmm and here I thought I was supposed to only work until 4:30.  Oh and forgive me again for not being included in said email's recipient list and not tapping into my psychic powers to order said product Monday.  My Lord I'm slipping...I better take my Ginkoboloba (?) before I forget to breathe.    Fuckin' A. Who wants to get drunk?

      Lisa  What happened to Copy B?? Kris called and is concerned about it being missed originally.  Between you and I, she is wondering if you are overwhelmed with work. I think you are!!!  Should we talk to Sue  about balancing your workload, are you ok???    Bob Hill Vice President  My Response to this:  Bob-   Listen asshole, she never asked me for Copy B or I would have ordered it.  She called me at 4pm on a Friday looking for forms for delivery on Monday, you think I would have skipped half the fucking order?  So tell little miss tattle tale that next time she fucks something up not to blame it on me.   I may be overworked but I'm not stupid.  Bending over backwards for this woman apparently is just not good enough.  Yes talk to Sue and tell her that I can't seem to do the job of 2 1/2 people for the pay of less than one anymore and maybe if the sales people didn't take 2 hour lunches and disappear inexplicably at all times of the day leaving me to deal with their crabby whiny customers I could get some shit done.    Thanks...I'll be here ALL week.  Lisa Dorn Peon of all peons.  Mmmmmm that felt good.

      I have "volunteered" to work on a committee to develop a newsletter for our customers.  Not only do I have the honor of writing marketing strategies and stories to put into the newsletter I also have the pleasure of deciding which products to highlight each month.  How exactly I got entangled in this endeavor I am not sure.  We were asked for volunteers and somehow during the silence that ensued, all eyes turned towards me.  "Lisa you're so good at ASI, Matt (Pres of Co.) was really excited for you to take on a role in this project.  He spoke very highly of you and thinks you'd be an asset with this project....blah blah blah."    This went on as I debated in my head.  How do I say no when the President wants me to do it?  How do I say yes when I know all the work that it will entail?  So instead I kept quiet watching the others squirm...all the while knowing I was going to get roped into this... as our manager pleaded with her eyes for two volunteers and explained to us how important this was.  Finally a volunteer, my good friend Patti took some of the pressure off.  But by golly they were determined to have two volunteers...by many twists of my arm and much protest on my part I have taken on yet another role here at Teuteberg.  Volunteer my ass.

      De ja vu is the feeling you get when you feel as though you had already visited a place you'd never actually been or gone through the motions of a situation you've never experienced.  Most of us have experienced this phenom more than once.  But what do you call it when you're entire day seems as though you've played it out before? Everything from the parking spot you chose to the song playing on the radio before you turn your cube lights off?  I'm having said such a day and damn if it's not freaking me out.   Have I lived this life before?    I very much believe in life being laid out like an outfit you lay out for the next day before you go to bed.  It's there for you to put on but the trick is someone else picked the clothes for you so you don't know what will be waiting for you in the morning.      Don't buy that?  Well how about this?  Life is like a book.  All the chapters have been written and you are merely a character acting it out.  All the decisions and free will you exercise are really just a means to get you to the last chapter.  Maybe the book is like one of those mystery novels where you can choose your outcome and it tells you which page to turn to....but in the end all decisions lead to the last chapter. Only you can't peek ahead and see which choice you should make based on the outcome.  You have to make your choices with blind faith and hope that which ever path you choose is the best one.    Hmm or maybe we're all just put here to torture each other and call it a day.  I don't' even know what I'm talking about anymore.

      I walked through the door at midnight She looked through me as I stared Her eyes of stone pushed me back I looked to escape but found no way  Where were you to help me just then? I was lost in an unusual way I looked to you for guidance and you had let go of my hand. It's cold but my feet are solid.  Moving towards me, she starts to scream. Where did he go? I turn towards her and she's gone. I'm surrounded by noone.

      I haven't written anything here for over a week because I've been uninspired.  Haven't had much to say.  I've lost a certain passion for life somewhere in the last few weeks.  I've been drifting in and out of reality with no real concept of how much time has passed.    It's already the second week of February and I'm unsure if I've realized any of the goals I set for myself in the new year.  I've resumed the nasty habit of smoking.  It's not an every day occurrence but atleast once a week and sometimes twice I indulge myself and manage to go through a pack every couple of weeks.  I haven't joined Bally's like I set out to do, partly because of my busy schedule but mostly because it would be a waste of money since I probably wouldn't even go.  The other 3 or 4 promises I made to myself...I don't even remember what they were anymore.    I've decided I've got no self control or discipline and am so self absorbed that I just do what I want when I want no matter what/who is involved.  I used to think I was agood person with good intentions and that made it okay to be an asshole once in a while and made it okay to be selfish.  I'm so bored with this life, can I exchange it for a shiny new red one?  Some would say my life is very full and even exciting, but I've been on this track for so long that it's starting to be monotonous.  Maybe it's winter, maybe it's Wisconsin...but I need a change.  Something drastic to jump start my excite-o-meter.  But what?  I'm going skydiving this spring.  That'll be a rush for all of about 3 hours.  Then how will I top that?  One rush just leads to another to top it and so on and so on, you do so many things in your life, pretty soon there's nothing else to top it.

      I won in one of my pools...yippee.  I drank enough alcohol lined fruit smoothies yesterday to support the fruit industry.  Yummy!!!  I think that's going to be my latest obsessions...Thanks Pop for the smoothie maker.  I came to the conlusion last night that I have the best friends ever.  I was lying in my cloud last night re-thinking the events of my weekend.  I realized how lucky I am.    Each friend that was over last night serves a different purpose in my life.  Each of them have been there for me in different times in my life and it makes me all warm and gooey inside to have them all over and realize that they are there for me...not the alcohol, not the food, not the game...but me.  They came to MY party to hang out with me.  I remember a day when the only person I really cared about in my life was my bf.  I had no real girlfriends to speak of.  And now as I look around my cube and look over the pictures of all my friends I just feel so happy to have them.  To know that I can call on any one of them with tears in my voice and no matter what they are doing, they will stop and listen to what's wrong.  They don't judge me or what I do.  Of course they have opinions and aren't afraid to give them, but that's okay.  I have such a great and diverse group of friends, I hand picked some and fell into others, but all in all, there isn't a single one of them that I'd trade in.  I feel very lucky to be surrounded by such wonderful people.  I've been so distraught at losing one of my bestest friends that I seem to forget how important the ones I have really are.  It's sad to lose a friend but it's sadder to not appreciate the ones you have.

      When you have no plans you must make your own.  So since I had nothing going on for this super bowl Sunday, I decided to have a party.  Now if I could just get people to come to it I'd be set =)  actually have 6 girls coming over and think this will be more fun then hanging out with a bunch of testosterone at the bar.  But of course the inevitable.  I received 3 phone calls in the last two days inviting me to various super bowl parties.  Ah well, I want to hang out with my girls...Now if they'd just hurry up and get here!    this weekend has been very hectic for me.  Drank for eleven hours straight on Friday, ugh!  Wasn't in a very festive mood on Saturday for my surprise plans for Sharon.  But it all turned out great in the end.  A good time was had by all.  Now if I can make it through the day without a cigarette, we'll be golden.

      From my seventh floor hotel room in Green Bay I was watching a family crossing the street down below.  Jay walking really.  I narrated the scene for Greek as he combed his hair in the mirror across the room.  A seemingly poor family of 4, consisting of a father...A short stout man of no stature... and 3 children...A little girl and two boys...were all standing on the edge of the curb holding hands like ducks in a row from tallest to shortest with the smallest being the little girl on the end.  They were jay walking and waiting for 3 lanes of traffic to clear so they could make their way to the median.    As soon as it was right the four of them started off.  Suddenly the little girl let go of her brother's hand and ran to the median.  When she reached the curb she jumped up and down with her hands waving in the air triumphantly.    As soon as her brother's and fathers caught up with her on the median, the brother who had been holding her hand walked right up to her and smacked her on the back of her head then snatched up her hand.    It was a sweet little scene that for some reason I haven't been able to get out of my head.

      I came over after work and took a bath with him.  He scrubbed my back as I rubbed his feet.  The bubbles got a little out of control and we splashed around making a mess on the black tile floor.    We went to the bedroom to take a nap.  We were staring at the ceiling giggling and joking around with each other.  Bickering about which really  is   better, peanut butter or jelly.  It was all a bunch of silliness until she walked in.  I dove under the covers of the top bunk, yes I said bunk.  She came in the room whistling and excited to see him.  She reached up to my bunk and grabbed my leg, quickly moving it and grabbing the suitcase next to me.    "I'm going to pack for our trip now while you nap" she told him.  She goes to the closet and starts chattering away about her day.  He looks nervously up at me as I catch his eye I mouth to him "she knows I'm here."   I'm ashamed and I feel like I've been cheated somehow.   He grabs her and takes her into the bathroom to take a shower together.  I scramble out from underneath the covers and head for the door.  She comes back into the room with soap bubbles on her feet and whispers to me that she knows what I've been doing.    He's in the shower now, alone.  She and I sit down with a cup of coffee and I tell her everything.  I feel a mixture of self loathing, pity for her, embarassment for me, shame, understanding, sympathy, hatred and jealousy.  I leave them together and walk down the street alone.  Yelling to anyone around me that he's wrong and he has made a mistake.  A man approaches me and asks me why I don't tell him that.  "I can't" I respond.   I woke up at 3 am in a sweat with my heart racing.  This was my dream last night, every detail was remembered.

      I talked to S today.  it was very weird.  It was pleasant but very weird.    it's odd how you can totally put somebody out of your mind just by not talking or seeing them.  Then the second you hear their voice or see their face that all changes.  I haven't talked to him since I got new tires and that was beginning of winter...or maybe I've talked to him once since then??  When I was on my way to meet Jax at BW3's?  That was before Christmas.  It's been so long I don't even know any more.  I don't miss him.  Well okay I'd be lying if I said that because of course there's some part of me that must miss him.  But it's a different kind of missing.  I finally realized that with S it's all or nothing.  There is no line of being friends, it's either we're together or we can't talk at all because there are too many feelings involved.    Yes I realized this all by just hearing his voice.  Just seeing his number come up on my caller id was enough for all kinds of thoughts and feelings to be dredged up.  I see his truck atleast once a week (no I'm not a stalker, his girlfriend lives in an area that I pass often) but this doesn't bother me.  If I were to see him walking to it, that may upset me.  It's odd because I've moved on completely and don't entertain thoughts of us getting back together any longer, but yet talking to him gave me a nostalgia that I can't even describe.

      I would like to share with ya'll about my 4 days in Green Bay but I don't think I should!    I cannot count how many times I repeated the phrase "What happens in Green Bay...STAYS in Green Bay".  It got to the point where as soon as I started to say it, everyone chimed in with me.   It was 3 days of steady drinking and partying with hundreds of people young and old testing limits and boundaries.  People crawling on balconies from one floor to the next, women baring breasts to security guards (okay that was me, but in my defense someone grabbed my arms back and someone else pulled up my shirt and bra), men peeing in the corners of elevators and hotel staff peeling condoms off of windows.    Wednesday, Thursday and Friday all blurred into one long day of pool and drinking, not to mention the free for all sex fests going on.  Wedding rings...meant nothing to anybody.  Sexual preference out the window and to hell with modesty.    I won't bore you with the details, but I will tell you that I got more attention from the women then I did the men.  But I don't kiss and tell ;)

      I love how when I take a couple of days off of work the people who do my job and pick up my slack do such a half ass job that I spend the entire first day back just trying to figure out what the hell they did.  There is no follow up and no completion of any task.  Any emails or faxes that I received after 10:30 on Friday were left untouched.  I can hear it too "OH that's fine, it can wait until Monday" as I've heard this sentence uttered by my manager many times in the past when others are on vacation.  It's as if they don't care that you are going to have one hell of a time piecing things together when you come back.    When I have to cover someone else I make damn sure that things are in order and done properly so they do not have to come back to a headache.  Is it really such a difficult thing to ask that the same respect is given to me?   Very cranky today and not wanting to be here.  I want to go back to Green Bay and continue my 4 day drunk spell.

      Ah, today is my Friday.  I'll be in Green Bay for the next two days for the state pool tournament.  I've been practicing a lot lately so hopefully I'll be able to bring home some money...sha-right.  I'm more likely to bring home a hang over.  I've got to get up at the ass crack of dawn tomorrow and be on the road by 6am.  I've got to get my stick re-tipped tonight, head to the bank to make a deposit, pack a bag for the trip, finish up my laundry, all before 8pm tonight when I have to be at the bar to shoot leagues.  Ugh.    If I were smart I would have come home from the bowling banquet last night and did chores or went right to sleep instead of seeing  urlLink Starsky and Hutch  with JB.  But I'd say it was worth it, cuz it was fu-u-u-nny.  I've also come to the conclusion that no matter how much time I have to get ready in the morning I will  always  be late.  I got home this morning at 6:15....a full hour and 45 minutes before I needed to be here and I was still 5 minutes late!!!  Usually I'm crawling out of my cloud at 7:15!!!!  Today I brought in bbq and jello and chips for lunch to share with everyone today (in a momentary lapse of judgment at lunch yesterday I offered to make extras for lunch and it became lunch for 8).  After cooking 80 thousand pounds of sloppy joes yesterday for the banquet and today's lunch, I'm not much in the mood to eat it!!!  I'm going to go through  urlLink Kit Kat   withdrawals this weekend!  I won't see her sweet ass until next week.  This makes me sad, very sad.  Funny Marquee of the week:  Oil Change $18.99 Every Saterday   What's a Sater and how did it get it's own day?   AMF!!!    (Adios Mother Fuckers)

       I'm damaged goods. My heart - It won't work right.  You see, I'd really like to love you,  But it's putting up a fight.    It seems I lent it out to someone once, And never fully got it back.   I was blind,  He was selfish,  And he broke my heart in half.    I've tried to piece it back together.... And sometime's I swear I've healed, But the moment you try to get too close That tape will start to peel.   So if you wanna be with me, Be prepared to just be friends. Because it's not fair to let you care Until my heart can fully mend.    I'm a hopeless romantic:  I fall in love fast, I fall out of love fast.  I generally have my whole wedding planned before our second date.  I've been truly in love Twice... the 2nd time was the first time I laid my heart out on a silver platter and, well, not good results.   Ever since then I have had a hard time getting into a relationship.  Every time I think I can love someone, they run away.  They aren't the kinds with staying potential anyway, and I think I subconsiously choose those types b/c deep down I don't want to be in a relationship.  Every time a perfectly nice guy tries to love me, I seek out every fault of theirs until I can't stand to be around them anymore.  I'm trying to be patient because I'm certain there's 'That One' out there for me... but sometime's I'm worried that I'll never quite connect with anyone like I connected with the one who got away......

      Religion is a touchy subject among certain people.  Ever since I saw "Passion" I have been noticing different things about the way people react to my "interpretation" of the movie.    When I state that even though the movie was based on a story I considered to be fiction it was very powerful and moving and made me think differently and question my views; certain people make a point of rebuttal, stating "it's a true story".  Stating this as though it was fact.    So I counter and point this out..."You believe it's a true story and I believe it's fiction."  I get "It is based on true events".  "That is what you believe" I counter again stating the person's beliefs rather than facts.    How does anybody really truly know whether it happened or not.  When speaking of religion I make a point of putting a disclaimer on all my statements, beginning them all with either I believe or I consider as to not push my thoughts on other people.  But I have found that people who are religious and believe what the Good Book teaches tend to push their thoughts and beliefs as fact.    If religion teaches based on a system of beliefs and faith, why is it that it is often toted to non-believers as real true hard fact?    I believe that there is a higher power in the world that is a driving force behind all things.  Is this one superb being, I don't know.  Could it be? Yes.  Given all that is tangible in our world, is it likely?  Probably not.  I'm not about to tell anybody that what they believe and have faith in is based on fiction and I expect nobody to tell me what to believe either.

      When I was a little bit younger and you would have asked me if I'd ever been in love I would have told you yes, 3 times.    That was until I met S and realized that my other "loves" were nothing short of the feeling of wanting to be loved.  As I was truly falling love with the man I thought would be my forever, I knew that there was nothing else like it and that no matter what happened with us I would always love him.  Almost 3 years after we broke up I still know in my heart that I will always love him.   It's a deep nurtured love that doesn't just disappear, a love that grew over time and a love that we strove to maintain and perfect.    Then there's M.  I love him with all my heart and probably always will.   It's a different love, it's a love that came more from a connection rather than having it grow over time.  It was as if one day I woke up and just loved him.  I care for no other reason than I feel I must, I feel like there's some greater reason we know each other.    Here I am now starting a new relationship wondering if I could ever love this man.  I like him a lot and he really truly makes me happy.  When S and I parted ways for the 3rd and last time he told me about the man that I deserved to be with.  So here this man is, sitting in front of me, giving me what I want and being what I need.  I'm not the type of person to date someone and wonder if he could be the one I marry and have children with.  I don't think about our future endeavors, I get as far as a few months from now but that's as far as my mind wanders.  With JB, I'm thinking about things that I hardly even thought about in my 5 years with S.  But is it because he looks so good on paper and has all the things I would want in a man?  Or is this going to be the quiet kind of love that just sneaks up on you and grows over time?  Maybe I just need to sit back and enjoy what I have now and stop overthinking things.  You cannot judge your new relationships based on past.  Love comes in many different packages and no love will ever make you feel the same as an old love.  Nor does it take away from what you once had.  It's just different.

      Here it is Monday again and I may be becoming rather predictable as I am about to ramble on about my weekend.  Friday:  Went to a Texas Hold 'Em poker party at BH's.  Coincidentally three of the players were guys I went to high school with.  A year below me and amazingly they knew who I was and were impressed with the way I "turned out", don't know quite what to do with that.  Good night, I was up about $300 early on in the game and left with an extra $150 in my pocket by the end of the night.  I won some nice pots and played some good games.    Later that evening I decided to head out with Short Fry and went to the Drift Inn to socialize with ghosts from my past.  And by the way NB if you are reading this, Chad and Clay say hello and Chad is especially jealous of your recent winnings.  Saturday:  Had my first fight with JB this weekend.  Which led me over to Kit Kat's to meet Marine Mike and hang out with her and Flashdance (is that right Kit Kat?) for the evening.  Then I decided to let up on JB and end his torture by going over and seeing him. All in all our fight was a good thing cuz I learned a some things about myself and about him.  I learned that I am growing up and have a new found maturity to handling "relationship type issues".  I learned that I   have   learned from previous relationships!  I am now officially a part of a couple.  I now officially have a boyfriend for the first time in 3 years, it still sounds foreign to me, but it's kept a grin on my face for the last 48 hours.  We'll see how I'm feelin' in a couple weeks when I realize what I've done!!  Oh the horror!  Sunday:  I went to see a very powerful movie with Kit Kat and Old School.  You may have heard of it "Passion"?  It brought emotions out that I hadn't realized were there, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen as I watched a story I consider to be fiction and pondered what the reality of it all really is.  I highly recommend this to even the least religious of people.

      Came in to work today to donuts and orange juice.  It's always nice to come in to treats.  "Oh you remembered my 2 year anniversary" I joked to co-workers who had no idea that the 21st marks my 2nd year of employment here.  "Where did the time go?" my boss pondered.    Only minutes later our happy Friday chatter was interupted by 31 year old President Matt coming up to break the news to us that yet another faithful employee has been disposed of.  "Sometimes when a sales person comes to a new company it just doesn't end up being a match," he explained to us as if we were 2 year olds.  So here I sit in my cube quiet as can be, look straight ahead and keep your mouth shut I say.  Do my work and shut the fuck up.

      So I went to pool last night.  After sleeping on and off from 2pm on, I decided to venture out after all.  And was it ever a nightmare.  I think Big B and I were the only ones not having fun.  He had a migraine and I was clutching my kleenex in the corner trying to stay away from all the smoke.  My new best friend Tiff was in true form having consumed enough alcohol to drunken an entire high school football team.  Let me tell you, there is nothing more annoying then drunk people trying to get you to dance...grind rather...with them when all you want to do is crawl onto your cloud and drift into slumber.    Everybody and their brother was at the bar last night, which I normally would have been grateful for, but instead my tolerance for human beings was so low that even my most cherished bar buddies got the cold shoulder.  My pool game suffered as well...although it can't really suffer much when it's not much to write home about in the first place.   So for the second week in a row I managed to escape the bar stone cold sober.  I had two tall glasses of orange juice all night.  Bartender Stoney, as he's known, had such an incredulous look on his face when I refused each shot that was bought for me, however judging from the sound of  his   voice this morning when he phoned me he must have doubled up and took them for me.  In conclusion, it was all worth it because today I feel much better and will be healthy for the weekend.

      I love St. Patty's Day.  For the last 5 or so years I have made it my business to drink green beer and shots of Irish whiskey for the better part of 12 or 14 hours and pretend that I've got Irish blood running through my veins, (I do a mean Irish accent after 37 drinks).  This year unfortunately it happens to be the middle of the week and I'm stuck here at work.  Tonight I've got pool which means I'm stuck at the same bar as always and won't really get out to enjoy all the other festivities.    To make matters worse I have developed a nasty cold and will actually be skipping pool and sitting at home tonight.  But for some reason this isn't upsetting me.  The thought of fighting crowds of drunk people spilling their green beer all over me has somehow lost it's appeal over the years.  I really think I'm getting to that ripe old age where drinking until I want to pass out next to the toilet on the cold bathroom tile and then spending the next day on the toilet ridding myself of green pee (among other things) really doesn't sound as fun as it once did.  Yep, I think I'll stay home tonight and watch the snow fall.  Turn on the tv and enjoy a quiet evening at home with my chicken noodle soup and a bottle of nyquil.

      I like gyros.  I love "Golden Gyros", they have the best gyros and their custard's yummy too.  So last night I drove past their marquee and happened to notice it said: Flavor of the Day Kit Kat  Way to go Kit Kat, you are finally getting your recognition =P

      So I entered this poetry contest figuring it would be like the time in 8th grade when I sent a silly poem to YM magazine.  Every month I would open that magazine and look to see if they published my poem each time to be disappointed until finally I got a simple rejection letter telling me that although they appreciated the time and effort I put into my creative efforts they would not be utilizing my poem.  Or like the time when I was about 14 and I thought my anecdote about my father's grooming habits would win me $50 from Reader's Digest in one of their reader's stories sections.  However this time around, I received an email (dawning of a new age) thanking me for my submission and letting me know that I am being considered as a finalist.  What does that mean really, I have no idea.  Is there money involved, I don't really know.  But hey it's something.

      What a day over here.  The cops have been here for an hour and they are going to be arresting a former employee.  The person who was let go last week is in some deep shit around here.  Speaking of deep shit...I heard the funniest song the other day on my way home.  The lyrics went something like:  "If you think your shit don't stank you better lean in closer cuz the roses smell like poo poo..."  The song as a whole was hilarious but I have no idea who it was by.    I also heard Usher's latest single entitled "Let it Burn" over the weekend, it reminds me of his 1997  hit "You Make Me Wanna".  But nothing makes me want to dance like "Yeah", his collaboration with Lil Jon and Ludacris.  I think I'll go dance now..yeah yeah.  =)

      It's Monday again.  A day that is used solely for reflection on the events of the weekend.  I had an absolute blast this weekend, aside from a little Kit Kat overdose everything was great (=P).    Friday was one of those nights that you forget you have any worries or any responsibilities.  I ran into one of my mom's best friends and she got to see me in rare ...or not so rare... form.  Haven't seen her in probably a  year and a half, she didn't even recognize me.  I had my contacts in and apparently my hair was "so straight" and "so blonde".   Saturday was an interesting event.  I laid on the couch until 5pm when the hangover gods decided enough was enough and let me up.  I headed over to Kit Kat's to hit the pool and get ready for our date.  Yes our date.  JB called with a proposal for a double date of sorts. Kit Kat and I were both nervous about who this person would turn out to be.  As we walked over to JB's house Kit Kat turned all shades of green as we imagined the possibilities of this blind date.  In the end all was well and we were both happy with the results.  We drank and played cards until all 4 of us were ready to pass out.    Sunday took a lot of strength for me.  The plan was to have a swim in the morning, head to Johnson Creek for a little shoppy shoppy, head downtown to nosh before the game and then hit the Buck's game.  But alas, I laid around JB's for too long and we never made it to Johnson Creek nor to lunch.    But the game...oh the game.  Even though we sat in the section where the living are like the dead, we had a great time.  Starting out with a heavy lead and keeping that lead until the half, the Buck's seemed to be kicking the Knicks' asses.  But the second half was not so pretty...losing by a skim 2 points at 103-101, the disappointment weighed heavily.   I still blame Kit Kat for her sex bet on the game.    Here I sit Monday morning, trying to remember exactly what work I am supposed to be doing.  Why does Sunday always have to lead to Monday?

      Is it true?  Is it really Friday?  yay!!!   Going to a St. Patty's moonlight adult's only bowling party.  woo hoo, all the girls are comin' out tonight.  A night that is much needed.  We'll start the party at my house and move on from there, I understand we're paired up with some single boys, I'll have to wear my lucky four leaf clover tanky top.  I don't care how cold it is outside =)  A little bowling, a little flirting, a little green beer....who am I kidding a lot of green beer...which will lead to a lot of flirting and something that you can't even really call bowling.    Saturday I get my hair chopped and died.  Going back to my roots.  I've decided to get my hair stripped because it doesn't hold color at all anymore.  My blonde is already showing through my red and it's only been about 2 weeks...tragedy.    Sunday it'll be a day of therapeutic returning of merchandise from the  last shopping day and then it's off to the Buck's game.  Then soon enough it'll be Monday again.    I'm just looking forward to getting out and doing something a little different this weekend.  The air is getting stale.    Kit Kat....Atlanta, November?  I may just join ya =P

      Do you even know that I'm mad at you? do you even care? Do you know this is the first time I've ever  really  been mad at you? do you know how it feels? Do you know that I can't stop thinking about it? do you even feel bad? Do you know that I can't even vent anymore because I end up yelling? do you hear my frustration? Do you know that there aren't even words to explain? do you think it's okay? Do you even know I'm mad at you?

      It's like a morgue around here.  One of our employees was let go this morning and everyone is in shock.  The last person in the company you would have expected to be canned.  Job security, what's that?  Scary how your whole existence can be totally altered in a single moment.    Pool: Game 1: Victory, I brought out the can of  urlLink whoop ass  Game 2: Lost on an 8 ball shot Game 3: Had the table ran on me Game 4: Victory by default, she hit the 8 ball in on her 3rd shot.  I actually walked out of the bar sober last night!!  Which is surprising considering I had friends come up and hang out.  I was in quite the exceptional mood.  Smiles for everyone.    Making my signature sweet and sour pork tonight.  Complete with sticky rice and egg rolls.  Roomie's working late tonight and the boy is bringing dessert.  Last night I actually slipped and called him my boyfriend, but with a quick recovery I rolled my eyes and laughed.  I was quite shocked that the words had come out of my mouth.    Exciting weekend coming up.  Can't wait for this week to be over.  This emotional roller coaster has to many loops and turns on it for me.

      The folowing explains why certain people make me want to take them and shake the hell out of them.  I have a friend, a person I have been friends with for almost 3 years.  I don't ever remember ever having this person apologize to me or take my feelings into consideration when she treats our friendship with total disregard.  Due to recent events and the below text taken from a recent email, I have decided to go tell her to eat a bowl of fuck (words taken from my good friend NB).    I can't make it on Friday.  I completely forgot.   (no apology, you forgot and made other plans-therefore you cancel on me it's okay to be inconsiderate)    As far as volleyball  - I was pretty much thinking it wasn't going to happen with all the drama and changes going on.     (what-the-fuck-ever I asked you if we should have D be the replacement or if we should find someone else and we agreed to find someone else, this was only a couple weeks ago or can't you remember that far back?)     C said she isn't going to play this summer and G asked me and N a month ago to play with them so I'll probably just do that this year.    (oh, it's okay that you just decided to quit the team and not tell me.  oh yea and it's okay that you are bailing to go be on another team.  It's okay that you punk out and don't seem to give a shit at all.  apology accepted)    .

      It came to me in a dream.  There was a girl there.  She was from my past.  She told me she couldn't be anymore.  Then she walked away and I never saw her again.  Then I was in a room that was bare except for a picture of a boy I once knew.  Except he was older and worn by the years.  I couldn't stop staring at the picture.  I caught my own reflection in the glass and realized that I was old too.  My hair was grey and my skin was wrinkled.  My eyes told a story of lost loves, missed opportunities and joy that was never seen.  There was a tear in the corner of my eye and I realized that I was dead.    life is meant to be lived and enjoyed.  When I see  my reflection in 30 or 40 years I want to see wild grey hair and laugh lines, my eyes should be full of life, things I've seen, things I've done, joy I've experienced in friendships and lovers.  My smile should never fade and my head should always be held high.  I woke up in a sweat this morning and reached for my dream dictionary.  All the hair on my neck was standing up and as I got up from my cloud I had to steady myself before standing.  Dreaming of dying is one thing, dreaming of being dead is a whole other.

      LOL...unfucking believable.   The sip of disappointment I had quickly went through me so I had to chase it with a glass of sadness.  That didn't last long either and I blindly took a shot of hope.  To get rid of that taste I tried a bottle of replacement, which seems to be working nicely.  Until suddenly I realized that I'd drank and entire bottle of anger, top shelf of course,  and somebody quite possibly slipped me a shot of bitterness into my glass of happiness.  I'm ready for my shot of indifference now.   This bar sucks.

      I was cleaning out my old emails on yahoo and came across this email.  For those of you who know the Peter story you will find this hilarious.  For those of you who don't, well last April I met a boy who really took me by surprise.  He was h-o-t and sweet to boot.  It was the first time in over a year that I actually wanted to spend time with somebody.  But alas he was a disfunctional man who couldn't get past what his ex had done to him and was too scared to do anything about what he was feeling...so he became known as "No Show Schenk (or NSS)", as you can imagine why.    Anyway, read on:  From: Peter Schenk   Sent: Tuesday, April 01, 2003 12:47 AM To: Lisa  Subject: More pictures...you love it!   I know, I know...I'm completely bombarding you with emails.  But I figure if I have to wait to see you I might as well type something, just to let you know I'm thinking of you.  I don't know why I'm still awake at 12:30, knowing fully that I need to be at work in the morning...but I've kind of got that nervous yet excited/wish I had spent more time with you on saturday vibe happening.  And if you've ever tried to sleep while your mind raced through a thousand and one moments of memory, you know exactly how I'm feeling.  I should warn you though, I majored in journalism in college...so I do tend to babble on quite a bit, but I enjoy writing so you'll just have to make do.    And what's running through my head you ask?  Well I'll tell  you.  It's the little things that have me smiling tonight.  It's the silly fact that after you left on saturday I found myself tasting my own lips, as sad as that may sound, for a hint of the taste you left behind.  The idea that I'm not quite sure but I think I may have felt a belly-button ring on  you at some point while we danced?  And of how it felt to be kissed...of how for some reason you had me completely suckered in, as if for one brief moment I was in total agreement that the world did in fact revolve around you (refer to that little hand gesture you enjoy performing).  And now I feel as if I've officially said too much.  I will ad this last tib bit however, it is a hard thing indeed to leave when you kiss me the way you do.  You've got this mystic yet compelling way of letting me know that everything around us is just scenery, and I love that. So needless to say, I cannot wait to see you again...I'm wearing this ever present grin on my face ;)  'nite Tulip.  Kit Kat - See they all have some kind of bullshit they like to spin.

      Why do we always want what we can have and then when we get it we really don't want it as much as we thought we did?    This is the heart of all my frustration in life.  I spend so much time chasing after things I think I want and then once I obtain them it doesn't seem to matter quite as much.  Then I just go after the next thing and nothing seems to satisfy me.  Is this what it's like for everyone or do I have some sort of a problem?    Yesterday I didn't go swim with Kit Kat cuz I had to walk around with my new contacts for a while and then wanted to go see JB since he had been gone all weekend.  I got over there and wanted nothing more than to walk down the street to Kit Kat's and have a swim and to have our 80's reunion karaoke in the pool.  JB just got on my nerves and I didn't want to be there.   My good friend and long time car fixer upper Dave called while I was there and Mr. Possessive got all kinds of inquisitive... who's Dave? an old friend how do you know him? met at whitnal park  did you guys date? 10 years ago for all of about 8 seconds etc etc...  omg I do not do well with that!!  Now when my girlfriends call I don't get that kind of interest.  So here I sit at work today pondering the reasoning behind my never quenched thirst and my never full stomach.  Always in search of the next "high" and wanting all the things I am unable to have.    Things I learned this weekend: I cannot escape my past. I cannot follow my heart. I cannot be what anyone else wants. I can hide from my past. I can be patient and wait for things to come to me. I can be me and be wanted for just that.

      This weekend started out real nice. I found a new cue stick, it's real phat then I made dinner for my friend Kit Kat. Went out and played pool and even shook some dice.  Saturday we went to Johnson Creek to shop. Spent some money and got lots of stuff, which for me and kit kat that isn't very tough. After that it was off to go bar hop.  Kit Kat went off to her free beer party and Teaser and I headed to the local watering hole. Wwe had a few drinks and they sure took their toll. I ran into Kevin and then even saw Charlie.  We left my favorite place and moved on to the next. A lot more beers and a shot or two later we headed to web's and I think I hit on the waiter. My night wasn't so great it must have been hexed.  I woke up today with quite a headache. I sat on the couch and watched cartoons then I got a phone call from that buffoon. It was Charlie asking if plans we could make.  "Hell no" I said "you must be crazy." So I went back to my tv and relaxed  I think my party meter was pushed to the max I think I'll going to go back to just being lazy.

      I've been bitter and sick  Since Wednesday Eve,  Til Funquita took me  On a shopping spree.  We gots lots of stuff For not so much cash We shopped for so long, We were almost late for our bash.    Then I went DANCING At this lame club called "BAR" Got a couple digits, I'd say my game was under par.   Then I met  Swiss Boy Mike  At Have a Nice Day Cafe.  He's 27, Educated, and wouldn't you know it,  Not gay.   My sore throat is back, But I lost 80 pounds.  Found a nice guy,  I wouldn't mind keepin around.  All in all I'd have to say  The night was success.  And, damn, what a concept I didn't have to get undressed!! (j/k)

      Did somebody say it's Friday??  Woohoo I htink I just realized that it's Friday, and it's 3pm.  Rock on.  Ugh, I need this weekend BAD!    I'd love to just sit on the couch and veg out in front of the tv watching bad 80's movies and eating buttery popcorn in my tank and sweats but alas, I go stir crazy after about 10 minutes of that.    I'll have dinner tonight and probably head up to the local watering hole.  Wow I am such the creature of habit.  It's Friday so the natural assumption is that Funqi will be at Boz's.  Old School wishes I come with her and her crew to Rooter's to watch Exit play, sounds like a good idea but am I adventurous enough to stray from my  normal Friday activity?  I don't know if I'm ready for that!  Maybe I should considering my gal Teaser will be hitting the town with me Saturday and mentioned she'd like to go to Boz's as a first stop on our night of wild and crazy fun (I'll be home by 11---bet).    Somewhere along the line I have become predictable...I need to have one of those nights where you just let the road lead the way and pick up some hitch hikers on the way.  One of those nights where your crew of able bodied drinkers somehow multiplies from 2 to 20 and by the end of the night you're trying to remember where exatly you left your car all the while knowing you'd be better off if you didn't find it.  A night of shots, bar hopping, dancing on tables and flirting with strangers.  Mmmm to be that ripe young age of 26 again ;)

      I think I gained around 14 pounds since last night.  We went to  urlLink Maggiano's  for dinner last night with the intent of stopping at  urlLink Potawatomi  and playing a little black jack.  After stuffing ourselves with warm bread dipped in olive oil, spinach stuffed mushrooms, manicotti draped with cheese and profitoroles (pastry atop vanilla bean ice cream, topped with whip cream, fudge and sprinkled with powder sugar) for desert, the priority was more in the line of a nap than gambling.  Not to mention we finished a bottle of wine that went straight to my head.  I highly recommend treating yourself to a little Maggiano's when you get the chance.  Mmm mmm, yummy!  Suddenly Papa's Pub pizza we planned for lunch doesn't sounds so great anymore.

      So, I thought all men could be categorized into three easy groups: 1.) The One Night Stands -Easily excused as "Oops I Did it Again" 2.) The Bootycall Boys- Convenient pleasure for the girl on the go with no time for   relationship drama...  And Finally, 3.) The Relationship Boys - ..It's been so long since I've ran into a non retarded one I can't even give you an accurate definition...   I thought I had it down pat when out of nowhere comes what I have deemed The Extended One Night Stand.  Example: Scott.  Met him Saturday night. He let me wear his hat all night, held my hand throughout the bar while proudly introducing me to his friends, kissed me when I lost the dart game for us... Of course, came home with me (c'mon, he gave me his hat).  I'm thinking "woo hoo- one night stand" because, though it's not the norm for me, it's a damn good thing to have occasionally.  Plus he's only 23, what more could he want?    After a shared night of good good lovin, he talks about how it 'means something' that we were both sober when we first started talking, how he's going to buy me a pink hat to match his blue one I was wearing, something about playing cards right and having a future (??)...And, while partially falling in love with the idea of possibly someday marrying this guy in matching trucker  hats,  I'm expecting him to hightail it first thing in the morning with a hasty kiss and half hearted 'i'll call you'.  Wrong.    He lounged with me for a good part of the day, kissed my neck as I made breakfast, cuddled on the couch, little kisses on my head here and there, joked how he was glad I "was rejected" by his friend (who he swears I was after in the first place), would have stayed longer had I not kicked him out.  Called twice the next night, came over, held my hand through Comedy Central and my friend Leslie's man-bashing, had hours of foreplay -breaking only for the Simpsons, Friends, and liquids- and he left for work the next morning after offering a huge 'take my breath away' bear hug and kiss on the cheek (to avoid the already forewarned death breath).  The start of a beautiful friendship, right?? Wrong AGAIN.   Had he not called after the first night, I would have understood.  Had he said he's not looking for anything serious, I would have accepted that.  Lord knows I knew it wouldn't go too far anyway, but COME ON.  Don't reference 'our' future if you don't know what you're talking about.  I know marriage doesn't spring from one night stands, but if you're not going to stick it out for more than a week, don't even bother pretending you can pass yourself off as a Level 3.  BOYS, I know you think you rule this world, but you CANNOT invent your own categories!!  And they say women are confusing...

      I'm sore from who knows what today.  My throat is dry and scratchy from yelling last night.  Went to a Marquette game and yelled my arse off.  Damn refs need glasses.  I decided to save myself the humiliation of getting beat at pool and getting drunk afterwards and then coming to work hung over as all get out.    Well half my plan worked anyway.  After the game I went to the bar anyway to say hi.  Well 76 drinks later I went home.  The plan was to stop up, have a couple beers, play a game or two and go home.  Little did I know that people were going to crawl out of the woodwork and invade my party for 1.  Just how many shots of cherry bomb can one person consume?  I'd count for you but let's just assume it's somewhere around 14.  I made a new best friend.  Her name's Tiffany...Tiff for short I've been told...and she has all of about 3 brain cells.  She's your typical Barbie doll, pretty, skinny and blonde who much to my surprise is a total sweetheart.  It's nice when somebody tells you they think you're awesome upon your second encounter with them.    can you hear me over that loud drumming????  Oh wait, that's just my head.  ... I'm addicted to Cheez-Its.  Every day around 9:30, I purchase a 50 cent, 1.5 oz bag of Cheez-Its.  220 calories, 12 grams of fat and 23 carbs and the bag makes the claim that it contains 100% real cheese.  They are yummy.  Yes, I'm addicted to Cheez-Its.

      one isn't sure one wants to go it's the trip to atlanta on the funqui and kitkat show  funqui knows everyone everywhere she goes she might not miss that but she'll miss when it snows  "i wont let you go" pleads the saddened funqui "it wont be as fun without you, and you can't have fun without me".  alas, the weather is warm and there's a boy who rocks her world so what will become of these 2 hottie girls?  only time will tell as it usually does life wont ever quite be the way that is was  and now this poem has come to an end but no matter what happens they'll always be friends.

      ... Today is my brother's 30th birthday.  Why is that so hard to swallow?  My mom turns 60 in April.  Now that's a hard one to take.  60 is retirement, grandchildren and golf.   My mom still works a 40 hour week and even goes on call at the MRI facility in West Bend.  She bowls once a week and is hardly ever found home on the weekends.  But she'll be 60!!!  Do we ever think of our parents as old, I hope not.  But my brother, now that's another story cuz I'm not too far behind him.  It's weird because it's not like his turning 30 should affect me in any way, but it just does.  I can date guys who are over 30...in fact S turns 32 this year and it really doesn't sound bad, but my brother?  He still lives at home with mom, is back in school, has no job, an ex girlfriend with 4 kids that he still chases around, drives my mom's old car and lives in my old bedroom.    He's 30!  Happy Birthday Brad.

      ...oh Funquita, how I wish you would move to HHHOTlanta with me!!!  .. here's a poem to persuade you!  I hate Wisconsin In every way. Only here will it be 80... And then SNOW the next day.  Whoever comes here willingly, Is on some serious crack.  I'm takin my ass to Atlanta So I can show off my fanTASTIC rack (ha ha)  Wisconsin is the epitomy Of everything that's evil -- It make you fat, it makes you cold,  It makes you hate all people.   Yes Wisconsin is lame,  There is no doubt..  And if you stay here too long- You'll never get out!!!!!

      I feel the need to ramble for a few minutes.  Unfortunately it's Monday and that means the weekend is over and the week has begun.  So I'd like to relive my weekend.  My Friday started out on a very positive note, details which will not be divulged for privacy reasons, but you know who you are and you know what you did.  The rest of my evening was spent relaxing watching movies at Kit Kat's and hanging out doing not much of anything.  Something I wasn't able to do all week and deeply needed.     Saturday started out worrisome.  I decided to change up my hair a bit and break out the dye.  What was meant to be more of a blond with some reddish highlights turned out to make me into a full fledged redhead once again.  I freaked out and resigned myself to the house for the next month.  But each time I caught myself in the mirror I liked it more and more.  So I decided I could leave the house,  I spent the rest of the day shopping for cues and a late lunch with dude.  After taking a short-lived nap we played let's see how annoyed we can make Lisa.  That was fun let me tell ya =)  In the end I opted to spend the last part of my evening at the bar for a bit and shoot some pool.  Little did I know that this choice would lead me to be molested by a drunk guy wearing an afro wig.   Sunday was spent listening to Madden in the background as I read the paper.  Lounging around doing nothing and feeling bad that I was doing nothing...so instead I went down the road to Kit Kat's and did nothing there =)  Ate, swam, watched a "Sex and the City" marathon, flipped through catalogs and gave myself a half assed pedicure.  I think I may be turning into a girl here.   All in all, it was all time well spent.  The laundry didn't get done, my room didn't get cleaned, my car didn't get washed, and the bills didn't get paid... but my only regret is that I didn't spend much of my time outside in the 55 degree heat wave we had both days.    Back to the hair, so far I've got: 1 it's beautiful, 3 I love its, 2 I like its, 1 it's just not you but I'll get used to it and 1 it's not that bad.  Hmmm...

      my brother got a tattoo.  Lord oh Lord, what is going on in the world?  My brother...MY BROTHER...got a tattoo of a rhasta man on his upper arm.  MY BROTHER has pierced nipples...or maybe nipple...I was too distraught to really take a good look.  For those of you who have actually met my brother or known him you would understand why this is so disturbing for me.

      i had my faith in human nature restored last night and my faith in myself shattered!  i went to target last night to pick up a few things for this weekend, including some tp that my roommate doesn't seem to understand is a necessity.  i checked out and for the first time in years actually wrote a check for my goods.  i walked out to the 'ruck and put my new stuff in the back of the hatch, as i did so i saw a man running towards me... i jumped back preparing to utilize my kickboxing skillz and give him a switch kick to the head...when I noticed he had his hand extended towards me which was holding a little black wallet.  MY little black wallet!!  i don't know where or how i had lost it but somewhere in between writing that check and getting to my 'ruck it had left my purse.  no money missing, all credit cards in place thankfully.  thank you sir whoever you are!

      I feel like I'm waiting for something.  I think this happens every year around this time. The weather is starting to get nice but the cold and wet still lingers.  We want to pack up our sweaters and bring out the shorts and t-shirts.  I'm waiting for the city to come alive again. For people to be walking on the streets and for the sound of motorcycles and the sound of kids playing outside.    Changing seasons in Wisconsin is like going on a roller coaster ride.  We stand in line for what can sometimes be hours.  Slowly making our way up to the platform.  We talk to each other about all the different color gums stuck on the walls and the guy 3 rows ahead of us who keeps picking his butt.  Then as we get closer to the platform, the line stops.  What's going on up there?  The ride better not be broken, we think.  Then we start moving a little again.  Then we're held behind the yellow line for what seems like an absolute eternity.  Craning our necks past the wall watching for the coaster to return, our hearts jump as we see it.  We're just waiting for that silver bar to open and let us free.  Then it's off for the crazy ride, we fight a little about which side of the car to sit and the operator warns us to keep our hands and feet inside the car at all times.  Screaming through each loop and over each hill and each jerky corner, we don't want it to end.  Then as soon as it began the car is slowing down and pulling back into the station.  That was too quick we think.  Maybe the operator will let us go again.  As the lap bar releases we pause just a few moments pretending we don't have to get off.  We even pause on the ramp exiting the platform and look back to see all the happy faces getting on the car and taking the seats we just had.   Then we go stand in line at another roller coaster.     wait    v. waitÂ·ed, waitÂ·ing, waits   1.  To remain or rest in expectation.    2.  To tarry until another catches up.  3.  To remain or be in readiness.  4.  To remain temporarily neglected, unattended to, or postponed.  I hate waiting.

      Anxious magnet face again today.  I have this feeling of anxiety that has carried with me for the last couple days.  Not sure exactly what it is but I'm sure it has something to do with JB.  I've made a decision about him and until I get it off my chest I will be uneasy.

      please pass the milk.  I can't walk on this skateboard anymore.  where is your underwear?  I have no more gum.  throw me a towel.  did you see that frog jump?  turn around and face forward please.  where did the smelly socks come from?  who's at the door?  my toe has lost all feeling.  that reminds me, for the second time this year I have had to have somebody take great care and precision to remove a tiny piece of glass from my foot.  as we laid in bed thursday night I kept getting sharp little pains from my foot, quickly recognized as a sliver of glass that had somehow become buried under the skin of my foot.  JB spent the next 20 minutes digging it out while I silently whimpered and tried not to yank my foot away from his grasp.  how can a little tiny speck of glass be so incredibly painful???  and why do I keep stepping on them???  I wear slippers, little red fuzzy ones.

      Things went very well last night.  I feel so much better about things.  It's amazing what a little communication can do for a person.  With plans to go to Bartalota's for dinner I was really nervous about what I was about to do.  We ended up at Saz's and I felt much more comfortable with this.    JB is one confused man.  He refused to let me tell him goodbye.  Insisting that that's not what he wants I enjoyed the ego boost but in my mind I knew I couldn't do what he was asking me to.  I told him we had to say goodbye and he told me he was still going to call me.  We'll see what happens, atleast I've got some clarification as to what he's thinking.  He's one of those guys who are in fight or flight mode with their own feelings.    I made him stop at Boz's on our way home so I could drop off my volleyball receipt, let him wait in the car while I ran in and made my rounds saying hello.  It was a little scary, 3 people asked me what I'd like to drink, the bartender already had popped open a bottle of beer for me before I was able to say that I wasn't staying.  It was crazy that on Friday when I went up to get a beer Shawny asked me if I planned on paying my tab...MY TAB.  I had forgotten I even had one!!!  I'm soooooo glad summer is almost here...get me out of the bar!  All in all I'd say last night was a very good night and today I feel much better.  My roomie's gone for 2 weeks...anybody want to come to a party?????

      I'm having dinner with JB tonight.  I've decided to tell him that I've got my own terms if we are to continue dating.  I've thought a lot about this and it occurred to me that I don't need to take cues from him, I should be able to get what I want out of this as well.  If I can't, then why should I stick around?  And men wonder why we treat them like the enemy!  I'm just tired of waiting around for guys, how about what I want for once?  I'm tired of being the nice patient girl who respects their decisions and understands what they are going through and will be there for them when they figure things out.  Fuck that!  I'm done biting my tongue and smiling in sympathy.  LOL- no I'm not ranting I'm just empowered  =)  Crazy kind of weekend...fun, boring, fun, boring, fun, boring.  Each day had it's highs and lows.  Friday night I did something I haven't done in a number of years and oh boy did I enjoy it.  Then for my own pleasure I talked to JB to rub it in or something like that.  He thought I was hilarious..I'd say I was as well.  I was probably deemed the entertainment for the night.    By the way, if any of you get conned into going to parties with Kit Kat, make sure you bring your pillow...lol. Just kidding sweet thang, it's not your fault Mishicot was such a snore.   I'd do it all over again just for you!  Yesterday, after going to the movies with Old School and her posse, I spent the rest of the evening fixing the horrible highlighting fiasco she had earlier during the day.  I told her she should always come to me for her highlights, never had a complaint yet!  Now she's all fixed and happy once again.  Tonight I've got a v-ball meeting and then well the dinner that I'm not looking forward to.  Atleast I know he'll take me somewhere expensive and he'll probably even fight to keep me around.  We'll see...

      On the trip up to Manitowoc this Saturday, Kit Kat and I decided to become song lyricists.  Similar to Weird Al, we grabbed a familiar song and changed it to our own liking.  Inspired by my recent endeavors Friday night we chose Afroman's "I got High"...Enjoy!  I was gonna keep my legs closed, until I got high.  I said I was done with one night stands, but then I got high.  I had 9 orgasms and I know why..yea yea yea...cuz I got high, because I got high, because I got high.  I decided I was done with you, but then I got high.  I said I wouldn't take your calls, but then I got high.  I stopped over late one night and I know why..yea yea yea, cuz I got high, because I got high, because I got high.  I turned into the new town whore, because I got high.  I jumped from one bed to the next,  because I was high.  Been having lots of sex with different guys...yea yea yea cuz I got high, because I got high, because I got high.  I used to be such a good girl, until I got high.  Now I might have HIV, because I was high.  I went to the clinic today, but I forgot why...yea yea yea, cuz I'm, because I'm high, because I'm hi-I-igh.

      can i be any more pathetic?  obsessive-compulsive can't get anything out of my mind until I beat it to death!!  Ode to a boyfriend: A few months ago I met a man named Jon, and let me tell you he was a real Don Juan. Jon took me out for fancy dinners, and after just two dates we were sinners. I felt very special when I was with him, doing things just on a whim.  Now he's not sure he wants to be with me, but he's too confused and wants to see. Jon doesn't want to give me up just yet, but any closer to him I won't get. He told me he cares for me a lot, but let down my guard I will not.  I'm confused right now to no end, but my own rules I cannot bend. If he cares for me as he said, he won't be able to get me out of his head. Jon doesn't really have a clue, nobody to tell him what to do.  I won't sit around and wait, while he gets his own shit straight. My ego's bruised and my pride is hurt, but in the end my pain is inert. I met a guy named Jon a few months ago, and now today I must let go.

      What am I thinking? 1.  I don't want to dump him. 2.  I can't blame him for being a little freaked out.  I even agree with him about things moving fast.   3.  Atleast he talked to me, maybe not right away but he did take the time to sit down and have a conversation about what he was feeling and thinking.  He could have been an asshole and blown me off all together. 4.  I'm glad he told me this now so that I have the chance to step back a little bit and not put so much stock in this relationship, who knows where it will go...now I know to put my guard back up.  Nothing is ever perfect and if I run away from something the second it's not exactly what I want I'll be alone forever.  I waited for S for over 2 years and well the other situation as well, I've got patience.

You'll just have the same reactions when things get more serious. 4.  It's only been a few months, wouldn't you rather know now before you develop real feelings?

       Things I think are gay:  A line for the bathroom. Paying for water. Having somebody yell out the window that I have a "sweet ass." Mice in my garage. Cold weather and rainy dreary days. Dogs that bark at 6 in the morning. People who mow there lawn at 8am on a Saturday. My roommate's boyfriend. The cat peeing on my couch, multiple times. Blisters from my golf clubs.   Things I think are awesome:  Sheets fresh out of the dryer. Thunderstorms. Riding your bike  with   the wind. A cool breeze on a sunny day. Little kisses in a movie theater. Getting honked at walking down the street. A smile from a gas station attendant. The smell (only the smell) of coffee in the morning. The smell of a man's cologne on my pillow and in my hair. Advil. My friends. Sweat Pea body lotion.

      I'm driving myself insane.  I'm going to go back to being single...it's so much easier and more relaxed.  Sure I may get a little lonely and want company, but loneliness is nothing compared to the way I'm currently feeling.  It's not like I can stop feeling like this, cuz if I could I would.  Argh...put it out of your mind and concentrate on other things.  I hate not knowing what's going on, it just makes me obsess and think about every possible bad thing that could happen.    Pool tonight, last week.  No Boz's though, thankfully!  I will atleast be home by 11.  I'll probably have a few too many drinks and think it's a great idea to call JB at that hour and make the situation even worse.  I should probably have Kit Kat come over and steal my phone from me.

      Argh.  I'm tired today.  I was in bed by 10pm which is earlier than most nights, however I had a few beers last night and didn't sleep all that well.  I had a disturbing conversation with JB after I left the bar and now today I have all those stupid feelings of insecurity and doubt that I thought I had already gotten rid of.  Yes, now I remember why I was single for so long, it just seems easier.    I had a lot of fun last night...got chased around the bar by a 20 foot long centipede that Stacy's Mom had caught...ran out of the bar paralyzed in fear.  I tried my revenge to pick her up and carry her ass out the back door...but instead received a spank on the ass from Shawny for getting rowdy in his kitchen.    RyRy tried to make me feel guilty for some reason that I'm still not clear on what it was.  Old School filled me in on her date and for once had some input to the conversation when it turned to the topic of "men are scum".  I also had unexpected conversation with an old friend...reminding me of what I miss.  Made me wonder what again the problem was??  So here I sit Tuesday morning wondering why it is that I can't just pick up and fly off to Australia on a whim whenever  I  want to.

      "I always get what I want" said JiggaJ this afternoon when I declined his invitation for dinner (about the 5th time I've had to do so).  When he asked me why, I simply stated, "Because I have a boyfriend and I'm not interested."  I wasn't mean I wasn't flirting I wasn't rude and I wasn't overfriendly.  I was just stating the truth.    I understand that nobody likes to be rejected, but come on buddy!  He's asked me on numerous occasions and every time I've told him I'm not interested.  On top of that, every Friday around 4pm he calls my extension and tells me to have a good weekend.  When I tell him I have a boyfriend and won't go to dinner he proceeds to tell me that it doesn't matter, it's just dinner and I'm not doing anything wrong.  DUH...do all guys  really   think like this?   Somebody enlighten me here!!  But hey I mean he always gets what he wants, hmm..I told him that if  I  change  my   mind I'll come find  him .

      What a great weekend...I don't think it could have been any more perfect.  Friday night's party was a great turn out.  It was nice to get all the girl's in the same room again, and Angie and I have decided to have a "real" party very soon.  I could have gone without the drama with her and Brian, but I'm loving life without drama so I'm just glad it wasn't mine. Then SuperFreak's drama with Matt, I love SuperFreak to death so I'll go through just about anything for/with her.   I just hope these things don't come to bite me in the ass when all is said and done.  Headed to O'Brien's and kicked it with the kickball teams.  Ivana's team as well as Sharon's team was there...nice turn out, nice talking to everyone.  I woke up around 7 Saturday morning and got myself ready for the trip.  Showered, shaved, packed, ate breakfast and even had time to spare.  I went to the bank to get some moola...saw S's truck outside the bank so I drove over to the gas station to stall.  Not quite sure why I didn't want to see him..maybe I didn't want to break my mood.  Went to mama's house to drop off a check and then headed over to pick up JB.  I was a little early so we had some time before we needed to leave...spent the time wisely (cough).  The motel was really nice and it was good to get out of town even if it was just for the night.  JB and I had a blast together.  Considering the only people I knew was the bride (barely the groom) and her mother him and I had drinks together and were pretty much in our own world at the bar and the reception.  We went out to have a smoke and he started playing football with some kids that were out there.  Drunk me decided it would be a good idea to play a little D.  I did a good job too..tipped the ball before he could catch it and tackled him in the process.  Landed on top of him with my dress showing off my best 'ass'et.  Quite comical really...good times!!!    Sunday was pleasant and relaxing.  After a nice breakfast at the local greasy spoon we headed homeward.  But not before stopping at the gas station and meeting Cheeng...Cheech and Chong's long lost cousin...the gas station attendant who declared JB and I to be in love.  Love the way JB handled it btw.  After we got home and took care of some business we went to the golf range.  He was quite impressed with my swing as well as how I hit the ball.    Later that day I went blading with KitKat around the Fox River and just about died as we walked back to her apt.  Had dinner at the Red Rooster and headed home to watch myself a movie...which I might add had me crying for good portions of it.    I had a nice, fun, relaxing weekend.  I'm not even complaining that I'm at work!!!!

      I just had it pointed out to me that I don't write much about JB here.  I countered...you never post any comments.  In fact nobody really does.  I know you're all reading cuz you talk to me about things I've written but you're all too chicken shit to write =)  Or not.  I'm glad that you like to see what I'm up to and thinking each day and flattered that you even remember what I say so I don't care that nobody's got anything to say.  Including my friend Kit Kat who has started her own site and now is too good to throw me a bone anymore.  Atleast I know you're reading.  I keep things about JB a little more secret because it's very private to me and there's only certain things I want to tell for the whole world to be able to read.  Besides this is supposed to be a rant site how can I write about shiny happy people moments and keep the complaining level where it's at?

      I just can't wait for the weekend to start.   my highly ambitious ass turned to mush last night.  I got home tired but determined.   Made some rice and Italian tomatoes for din din and started a load of laundry.  Unloaded the dishwasher and took out the garbage.  I then ate my dinner and proceeded to attempt a nap.  Instead I called Kit Kat and asked her to go shopping with me.  We went to Starship, Maxx, Wally Mart and McD's...as we drove through the drive thru that runs parallel to the golf range I drooled and debated coming back to hit some balls.  After all, it WAS 65 degrees out.    In the end I finished everything I needed to do at the stores  but I took so long dickin' around that I wasted a lot of cleaning time.  In the end I finished my laundry (towels are currently in the dryer) cleaned the basement top to bottom for the party,  and painted my nails.    Tonight I must tackle my room before everyone comes over.  Most would say to just keep the door shut but that's just not possible with my friends =)  Now I'm at work while Angie's at home cleaning the rest of the house...well actually she's probably still sleeping.  She told me to call in sick...oh if I only had the luxury to call in sick on a Friday when everyone knows I'm having a party and it's going to be 80 today...yea they'd believe I'm sick...uh-huh.

      I got to work at 7:54 this morning.  I grabbed an emergency fed ex and headed out the door (815am) to College and Howell to drop off artwork.  I came back to work (9:30) and headed into a meeting that took an hour.  I headed to another meeting (11:00) that took another hour.  I went to lunch (12:30).  Now here I am having to do some actual work and I can't concentrate.  I think I have adult ADD, I mean seriously.  I get distracted so easily and always feel disorganized.  I wandered the building after lunch for no real reason other than I didn't feel like coming back up to my desk.  Now I've been here about ten minutes (1:40)  and started 4 different tasks...and now look what I'm doing.  Writing here.  I must compile a list of things I need to do before I go away this weekend.  Considering tomorrow is our party, I've got to get it all done tonight.  Argh.  And to think I've been doing little things all week to get prepared but yet I still have a ton to do.  Laundry!!!! Clean bedroom Clean basement Stop at Boz's to pick up volleyball check Make physical therapy appts.  Laundry Paint nails Sally Hansen's for hair product Highlight hair Clean golf clubs in case JB indeed decides he wants to golf this weekend. Go to bank to get cashola since dummy me has seemingly lost my debit card.  So what have I gotten done so far?  Half my room is clean, I cleaned out vacuumed and got my car washed and freshly changed oil.  I've bought the wedding presents and wrapped it all up.  I've got my dress, shoes and jewelry all picked out and ready to go.  The hotel reservations have been made and I printed out directions/maps to get there.  I'm sure I'm forgetting something.  Speaking of forgetting things, I'm like having an asthma attack and I forgot my inhaler at home today...swift.

      I love this song "Burn" by Usher...I'm jammin' in my cube thinking about how true the song is.  Wanting to leave a situation you know you should but yet wanting to stay because you're too scared to leave and you don't know what the future will be without them.  SuperFreak's got a situation that can be summed up by that song.  I feel bad for her because she loves him and he loves her.  They both want to be together but yet want such different things.  How much time do you have to spend with somebody, after you realize you may  never be on the same page, before it becomes wasting time?  Yours as well as theirs.    It's sad when a relationship ends for no reason other than wanting different things or one person falling out of love.  When a relationship ends most amicably it seems as though it's the best way, no hard knock down drag out fights and vindictive behavior.  But I know from first hand experience that a no fault break up is harder than anything.  You suffer a broken heart but aren't quite sure why you are leaving.

      I guess I just ask to much of our receptionist who answers phones and receive faxes!  This is so ridiculous it's hilarious.  This woman calls in atleast 2  times a month and is seriously 2-4 hours late 3 times a month.  They won't fire her because she's one of these people who blame everything on the fact that she's black.  I ask her to pay a little more attention to who the recipient is on a fax and this is what I get.       Lisa,            You are the only one that send me e-mails regarding my mistakes or timeliness of forwarding them.  (IT'S PROBABLY CUZ YOU FUCK MINE UP THE MOST)      I'm sorry I routed it to the wrong person, but,  I'M HUMAN! (IT SAID ATTN. LISA HOT RUSH AND YOU SENT IT TO DEBBIE WHO'S ON VACATION UNTIL THE 19TH YOU DUMB FUCK) The time you spent typing this e-mail perhaps another job could have been completed. (I TYPE 70 WPM, MY 2 PARAGRAPH EMAIL TOOK ALL OF ABOUT 2 MINUTES TO TYPE AND SEND) Another thing, I do a lot of other things besides sit & route faxes. (LIKE SURF THE INTERNET AND FORWARD JOKES??? WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU DO, NOBODY WANTS TO ASK YOU TO DO ANYTHING CUZ YOU SCREW EVERYTHING UP AND YOU'RE NOT RELIABLE ENOUGH TO BE HERE) I get calls all day long from people that want to speak to Lisa--- which Lisa? There has          been two Lisa(s) here for months now, please give and ask your customers to ask for you by first and      and last names. I'd really appreciate it.  (I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO RESPOND TO THE ABSURDITY OF THIS STATEMENT).       Thanks Much      Marie  I got an earful from my customer and then the sales person called me wanting to know what's going on. Being one of our biggest customers, she is upset that it took me 3 hours to get back to her on something that was a hot rush.  I didn't even have the fax.  But of course I won't tell the customer this.  I'll take the fall.  Yikes!

      Why does life have to come with so many decisions? I put a security deposit down on my new apartment and then yesterday talked with my newly single not so much a brother Matt about being roommates.  A couple weeks ago I had made mention in passing to him that I'd be looking for a new place soon and if him and SuperFreak seriously broke up I'm open to having a roommate.    Now he's stating to me that he may be interested, but he needs just a little time to get things straight in his head.  He did after all just move out of there and back into his mom's house.  Let's examine this.  Cons: MNSNSMABM is my long term ex's brother. is my good good friend SuperFreak's now ex-boyfriend. has been known to be somewhat of a hmmm man whore, before meeting SuperFreak. likes to party and works second shift...lots of noise late at night? isn't exactly notorious for being a neat freak nor a responsible individual. is a boy and I'm not quite sure that JB would be too thrilled about that. Pros: MNSNSMABM is seriously like a brother to me and we have always been very close. is the father to the most adorable little boy in the world who still thinks of me as Auntie Lisa and I'd get to see him every other weekend like I used to. would be paying half the bills in a larger apartment then what I'd afford on my own. has a job he's been at it for 8 years now and has been getting better with money.   works second shift for the greater part of the year and would barely be around when I'm there anyway. is a boy and I wouldn't have to deal with any bullshit.  What do I do?

      Wow, I was pretty drunk in that last entry, couldn't seem to find the correct keys =)  Crazy fun this weekend.  Friday I went and saw  urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind   with Kit Kat on Friday.  Very good movie.  I used to think that I wanted to just forget all the memories of an ex just to be able to move on however after viewing this movie I really understood how much it would destroy me to not have the good as well as bad memories that we made together.  Sometimes you think pain is unbearable, but as they say "don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened".  This trippy movie about erasing people from your memory gets 2 thumbs up!!!  The effects in this movie were eerie and even gave me goose pimples.  Plus this movie made me laugh out loud which most of Jim Carrey does.  Playing a pathetic lonely romantic brooder, his character is nothing like I've seen him play before and he pulls it off with an air of quirkiness that only Carey can.  And with that I'll stop before I start sounding like a movie reviewer.  After the movie we stopped for a drink at Amann's to celebrate my newly singe not so much a brother Matt's birthday.  I took Kit Kat back to her car and then went back to the bar to party it up with my good time pals.  Matt, Chris, Chad, Clay, Wes, Adam, Joel, Tim, Jim, Jeff, Paul and I all decided we'd see how much alcohol 12 people could drink.  I showed the girls for a free bottle of champagne (I wasn't even drunk at that point!!! but I took one for the team since I was the only partier who had tits =)) Keri and Kim joined in later and we all had a dance off...and the winner is Chris who decided to create a mosh pit out of us as 6 of us swayed back and forth in a circle singing (more like yelling) "You've lost that lovin' feelin".  Thanks Chris for the sore shoulder =)  Saturday was a  day for family.  Ate some food, threw the football around and then the softball.  Ate some cake, watched some tv.  Wrestled with my cousin's kiddies for a while and then headed home.  Shopping with Kit Kat to prepare for our night out.  Headed out to Rooter's around 10 to see  urlLink Mt. Olive  .  Ran into Jax and her crew.  Got offered $700 to have sex with Chuckie...uh no!  I agreed to find a girl for a $200 finder's fee ;)  Good times, lots of dancing and lots of drinking, finished the night with shots of tequila.  Flashdance and her crew weren't my cup of tea though, I'm starting to feel out of place at these things.  Kit Kat and I suffered a giggle fit later at her crib, trying to make grilled cheese she decided she didn't need heat to cook hers and though the butter would work better on the INSIDE of the sandwich!!!!  I was rolling on the kitchen floor lmao.  Sunday was sweet, spent the day at Mag's for Easter.  All the kids were there and my pops etc. in true form with their martinis and bloody mary's.  The thought of more alcohol did not please me.  So I just had a couple Lisa's (so names for I drank them all weekend in GB vodka and orange juice with a splash and a half of cranberry juice), and played with the kiddies for most of the afternoon.  JB came home from Green Bay around 5 and I made it over there around 8:30.  Spent some quality time with him and woke up this morning to his cat's trying to claw their way through the comforter.  Spent some more quality time with JB and off I went to work.  Here I am, bored and busy at the same time.  Rambling on about nothing anybody wants to hear about but who cares, this is my blog!

      I got the sweetest text message from JB this morning.  Before heading off to bed last night he sent me a text saying "nite sexy"...mmm I love being called that.  This morning I awoke to "I love your sexy smile".  I don't know what he's buttering me up for but I like it.    He's one of those men who uses lots of pet names.  He calls me Tootse, Sugar, Baby, Sexy and Mama.  Tootse is cute, but gotz to go cuz my mom calls me Tootse.  I like Sugar, but that's reserved.  Mama is a little too ghetto for me.  This leaves Baby and Sexy.  Both are fine choices.  He's doned me with the nickname Monkey, which is very fitting considering I'm already Nutty Monkey.  And I've found that he likes to say my name.    I like to call him Short Fry cuz he's 6 foot forever and towers over me.  Honey and my Dear are about as creative as I am these days.  I have more fun making up silly names for people rather than using terms of endearment.  Somewhere along the line I have taken to calling him Sweet Cheeks but I'm tiring of that expression.    I'm completely rambling about nothing right now and ya know what?  I don't care.    I have a half day of work today.  I'm going to lunch with my mom.  I'm signing a lease on an apartment today.  I'm going to a movie with Kit Kat and most likely going out to celebrate my newly single not so much a brother Matt's birthday, (provided S is going to be out).  I've got family crap Saturday afternoon as well as Sunday and Saturday  night after bellowing out some karoake at Flashdance's house, we're all heading out to see Mt. Olive.  I won't get to see SweetCheeks until Sunday or Monday night cuz he'll be in Green Bay, but I think I'll make it.  Although I am still a little perplexed as to why the invite hasn't been extended as of yet.     So I'm off to do some work now.  AMF!!!

      I am so dumb, well atleast I'm the best gf EVER.    I'm walking out of work around 5:30 last night when Mr. President himself calls me into his office.  That's usually not a fun thing.  But this time he offered me our season tickets to the Bucks game.  Pretty much on the floor, right where the players come out of the locker room.  I declined?!?!?!?!!  "I've got pool tonight" I responded.  HELLO?  I took the tickets anyway promising that I could find somebody to give them to so as they didn't go to waste.  Oddly enough JB's name was not the first that popped into my head.  Luckily I recovered fast and realized that duh...I have a bf now, he's supposed to be the first person I think of in a situation like this.  So I called him and told him to find a friend cuz he was going to the Buck's game.  HELLO? Why am I not going to the game?  I'm not exactly sure what my deal was here folks.  He's going with Painterboy and I'm happy with this.  He stops to pick up the tickets and he's appreciative of this.  I bid him farewell and to have a good time.  After he leaves I send him a text message to stop and see me after pool if they decide a drink is in order. I watch the game at pool...Buck's pull it out and the last 3 or so minutes of the game were probably the best.    JB sends a text saying that Painterboy has to work in the morning and they won't be stopping...frowns all around but oh well.  He also informs me that they left with 5 minutes left on the clock....JEEZ.  I later find out that they went to a bar after all...jerks.  Show some mf'in gratitude.    Why should I be salty?  I mean duh, I should have just gone my damn self!!!!!!!!

      it happened again except this time it was different.    him and i were in the car talking after spending the night out together, it was 4:30 in the morning and the birds were happily chirping.  we were in the driveway and I guess we fell asleep.  I got out of the car to have a smoke and she came out of the house.  she started screaming hysterically and i let her push me out of her way.  she yelled through the car window at him and shook her head at me.  i let her slap me in the face twice.  then i grabbed her wrist to calm her and she started to cry.  this time i was woken up by JB wondering what was wrong.  apparantely i was struggling in my sleep and had woke him up.

I washed dishes I wrote a letter to Mike. I paid my bills. I washed my sheets. I re-figured my budget. I filled out a rental application. I flipped through the employment and classifieds. I saw "Ladykillers". I ate at Applebee's. I watched an "Oblivious" marathon. I had my feet massaged.  Mmmm I think I'm going to call in sick once a week.  It seems like I actually get shit done.

      It's Monday and I"m really busy but can't seem to get myself motivated to do any real work.  Maybe if I come here and ramble on for a bit I'll have some power to concentrate.  Had a nice unplanned laid back weekend.  Friday I helped Oompa Loompa (previously known as Old School), buy paint at Home Depot.  It's lucky I was with her or I'm afraid she would have ended up curled up in a ball in the middle of the store ;).  I helped her figure out what she needed and how to go about getting it.  It was fun =)  I suppose it paid off sleeping with a carpenter for 5 years.  We did a little other shopping, US Cellular, Pier One to visit Teaser and then rushed home to make ourselves pretty.  Went to SOB's for some drinks and darts and ran into our past head on.    After reminiscing a bit with Oompa about my nickname Bumpy and LL's nickname Lumpy.  A freak accident where we collided head on during a rousing game of "Shoeball", (trademark 1995; it's a game of little skill, played only after 2 am at Bradford Beach ), coined us with these name's.  Not thirty seconds after our brief reminiscing, MexiAfroman walked in the door...(co-founder of Shoeball).  How odd!  That same night I received a pleasant call from my newly single not-so-much-a-brother Matt.  It's midnight and he's calling me to tell me that Big D will be terribly upset if I don't make it to his Chuck E. Cheese birthday on Saturday.  How can I say no to that?  Poor JB gets cancelled on again.    After hours of skee ball, pop a shot, Bass fishing, Jet Skiing through Hawaii and Jurassic Park GREAT ADVENTURE...an exhausted Funquita headed to JB's house to make up the afternoon to him.  After a few hours on his couch I could have stayed there for the duration of the evening.  But alas, my plans kept me moving.    Poker Party at Bobhill's.  Goodie for me cuz I doubled my money and still got out of there in time to go out with Kit Kat and Flash Dance.  Change of heart, I didn't go.  I'm afraid of Kelly's Bleachers.  Instead I went back to JB's for a little R&R.  We started to watch "The Big Lebowski" but I couldn't keep my eyes open and he couldn't keep his hands off me.  So we called it a night and made the same attempt in the morning after we got back from breakfast.    Sunday afternoon I finally made my way over to Oompa Loompa's house to "help her paint".  Her walls were pretty much done, so I sat on  my arse and found some new modtunes for my phone...set up my brother to ring to the tune of the Inspector Gadget theme...LOL.  Read the paper and found some apartments to call on.  Oompa and I did some drive by's and I've got two appts. tonight.    I'm getting psyched about having my own place again.  The inconsideration is growing at my house and I"m seriously getting annoyed.    If your room mate is lying quietly on the couch at 8:30 with all the lights out and has a movie on when you and your BF or GF come home, which of the following do you do:  a.  Start talking to them, turn on all kinds of lights then go in your bedroom, lie on the bed with the door open and  talk in your outside voices to each other and laugh loudly.  b.  Decide to fix the thermostat by having one of you upstairs yelling to the other one who is downstairs, fight about who actually fixed it then talk in your outside voices about the movies you rented and want to watch.  c.  Order a pizza, wander around the house back and forth, then check out the window every 45 seconds to see if the delivery guy is here yet, (I mean come on he's not coming any faster if you look out the window 43 times). d.  Quietly say hello, take care of any business you have upstairs quietly, order a pizza and ask the delivery boy to deliver it to the back door, head downstairs, where there is another TV and DVD player, and set up camp for the night.  I vote for d, but apparently a b and c are all excellent options, especially when done in combination.  Okay, I think I've rambled on long enough.  AMF!

      Karen was having a bad day.  I was standing at the reception desk trying to get an invoice straightened out.  I don't know why I didn't pull away when she started but it was funny.  Here's a 48 year old woman doing something a  5 year old child would.  It was making her feel better about her bad day so I let her continue.  She colored the entire back of my hand with a pink highlighter.  As a finishing touch Terri added a smiley face with a green highlighter.  ha ha ha right.  Then she wanted to color the other hand orange...no no no I have to draw the line somewhere, don't I?  I left it on for a number of hours cuz it was funny and people seemed to have gotten a kick out of it.  Yea well, now here I am 2 1/2 hours later, washed my hands about 6 times now and used half a bottle of soap and guess what?  I have a pink hand!!!!!!!!!!

      I went and looked at an apartment yesterday.  It was cute but I'm slowly getting ticked about the fact that Cantbealone is having her boyfriend move into the house.  One of my biggest reasons for hesitating on giving up my cute little cottage and moving in with her was that it had to be for a lengthy period of time and her finding a new guy to move in with her was a big thing that we discussed.  She assured me that it wouldn't happen.  If she really thinks I"m not upset by this she must be living in a cave.  So I'm just going to quietly find an apartment and move out.   The place I looked at last night was cute but I really couldn't see myself living there for a lengthy period of time and I am soooooooooo sick of moving that I've got to find somewhere I can call home for a few years.  Went to Pieces of Eight with JB last night.  We ordered a bottle of wine and had steak and prime rib...yummy.  We then went into the bar and sat by the fireplace for a couple hours of conversation.  I finally opened my mouth about the things that have been bugging me.  I feel much better today because I've got a much better understanding of him.  My original feelings of running far far away have been squelched.  I think I'll keep him around for a bit longer.   It's odd however, I'm not used to having a guy who recognizes when he's wrong and when he's being an ass.  S had this golden quality of being able to turn any issue around on me and somehow I'd believe that his forgetting to pick up milk on his way home was MY fault.  I kind of like this new side of man that I am seeing.

      Vibrators have been on the market since 1904 and doctors often used them to cure "hysteria" in women, thinking that the hysteria was caused by the uterus losing focus and 'wandering' around.  Yeah.. that's what I use MINE for - gotta keep that uterus in line!

      what my 12 smiles mean (thank you kit kat for the reference). what emotion I'm feeling in just one simple word of "Hello". which blanket I want when I'm sick and which blanket I want when we're cuddling up for a movie. what it means when I stare at the floor, what it means when I stare at him, what it means when I stare off in the distance. what my eyes are saying. what I like on my toast and what my favorite drink is. what time I'm at my best and what time I'm at my worst. what I'd like to change about myself. what my biggest fear is. what makes me the most self conscious. which "Friends" character is my favorite and which is most like me. who I like more my boss or my job. which buttons to push and which ones to stay away from. when I need a hug. how to make fun of me.  I'm afraid of not finding that connection with somebody ever again.  Not finding someone who can get into my head the way others have.  Not finding someone who I can bounce off of and who bounces off of me.  Not finding someone who compliments me as I compliment him.  Not finding someone where just the thought of him makes me smile.    If I ever find it again, I'll never letting it go.  I will fight for it if I have to.  I won't lose it again.

      Well my "relationship" is slowly going to the shitter.  Tonight we're going downtown to have dinner and I may just cut him off at the knees.  What's the point of having a "boyfriend" if he won't perform his boyfriendly duties?  Like going to a wedding.  Nobody really  likes  going to weddings but you go to support the people getting married.  Or you go because your significant other has asked you to be their date.  I spent most of my night last night crabbing about this subject to my g-friends that came up to pool last night.  I expect certain things out of a relationship and so far I've been disappointed.  If JB wanted me to go to a friggin' computer geek show with him, I'd go even though that would be close to last on my list of things to do. I wouldn't play 20 questions with  him .    Where's the show? How long do you want to stay? Who do you know that will be there? What do you want to buy from there? Will we be eating there? How much does it cost to get in?  Who told you about it? What color socks are you going to wear?  Christ!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'm going to become a nun and join a convent.  I'll use my vibrator to get myself off and otherwise live a celibate life.

      I am incredibly glad that this week has finally come to it's conclusion.  I have been out every single God forsaken day this week.  Last night I thought it was a good idea to stay out until 1 in the morning.  Why again?  Hmmph I don't know maybe because I have no self control?  Maybe because I'm easily influenced by the people around me?  I try so hard to be good girl and leave early but then all of a sudden these people start walking in the bar who claim to be my friends and then next thing you know I'm doing shots and slamming beers with the best of them.    I met a man last night that made me weak in the knees.  He was so adorable I wanted to just scoop him up and keep him in my pocket.  29 years old, dark hair with a goatee, tall, muscular, and big brown eyes that I got lost in somewhere between his first words "hey cutie" and his last words "it was great to talk to you".  Oh, did I mention he's engaged to be married...in two weeks?  Yep, that's it, that's the catch.  *sigh*    Sleepy Magnet Face today, am I going to make it without passing out at my computer?  Any bets?

      Honda called last night, didn't have my phone with me (OH MY GOD) so I don't know what he wanted, but I'm guessing to beg for my forgiveness =)    Ugh, I'm in food coma. Went to Maggiano's today for a business lunch.  Oh my food food food and desert.  Started with bread and moved quickly to the side salad.  I ordered Chicken Parmesan which was delicious.  We even ordered Tiramiso(sp?) and an apple kuchen for dessert.  Ugh, someone throw me a pillow.  During our entrees I picked up my glass of soda and was about to wrap my lips around the straw when the waitress came by and snagged it right out of my hands!!!  "Let me get you a refill," she chimed as she walked away with my glass which was half full.  Whaaa??  Okay seriously, the straw was 2 inches from my mouth!  The VP and Pres of our company both looked at me in puzzlement and we all started laughing.  Later as she cleared the plates she grabbed Kris's plate and as she was lifting it off the table asked "Are you finished?," Kris slowly set down her fork!!! and again we all started laughing.  I've heard of quick turnover on tables but my oh my, maybe they should have just served us our food in the to go boxes from the get go!!!!!   Oh yea and they didn't have to seat us at the same table JB and I ate at and give us the same server, that just wasn't necessary!

      I have a pact with Honda that if neither of us are married at 30, we're getting hitched.  I went and saw his new house last night and we discussed the terms.  With Mullet Man acting as his legal advisor and CPA being my appointed, we worked out the terms of or union.    Since Honda and I have been good friends for the last 10 years there is no reason for the formality of an engagement period.  We will not wed until after his 30th birthday as he is 5 months my junior.  So there it is folks, January 24th 2007 please join me in my nuptials!  Oh yea and we're getting married on a beach in some far away land.  It's either that or an Elvis wedding in Vegas.

      I cannot seem to wake up today.   Why am I so exhausted?  Could it be this God forsaken weather?  I didn't do much yesterday.  Had a late bre'fast, swam and played volleyball in the pool, hung out at Kit Kat's being silly and then home for some relaxation.  My mama came over with my uncle and his wife for a short visit and I headed to bed with my book around 10:30.    Could it be the two days proceeding yesterday?  Friday night was spent chasing beers with shots of cherry bombs. Kit Kat came with me to a surprise birthday party for an old school friend of mine (whom I haven't seen for almost 10 years, whom didn't even remember me until I rattled off some memories for him).  Slightly Stupid and I teamed up in pool and kicked some major ass, 8 wins in a row, haven't had a streak like that since Sully's reign of greatness with Nutter Butter.  Big C and Jeffy came out as well and Stacy's Mom brought Schizo and Duh-Dale up to party as well.  We were at the Calhoun Station and the bartender happened to be a girl I poured drinks with at Latin Fest last summer...made me feel good to know that Doug didn't just stiff me, he didn't pay anybody, the bastard, her and I made a pact to lynch him.   My unfortunate mistake that evening was deciding that at 12:30 it was a good idea to go to Boz's and continue the evening.  I then ran into the  Urban Brothers (bowling buddies) and probably made a big ass of myself performing the secret handshake....LOL.  Oh what a night.  Saturday was spent nursing a bit of a hangover...Cancelled my tee time due to BAD WEATHER and instead stayed around the house.  Got a lot done in way of cleaning and helped my distraught roommate make sense of being dumped.  Then it was off to Hart Park Fest for The Toys.  Started off as a slow evening and for some reason I was hit with sadness.  Memories floated all around me, but I quickly recovered once I sucked it up and started drinking.  The evening took us to the bar to meet up with a birthday party.  Lots of drinks and naughtiness later we headed to Big Bird's to continue the fiesta and with dreams of passing out.  However, passing out was not an option, each time my attempts to do so were thwarted by Matt & Matt trying to tickle me literally to death.  So I remained one of the parties and took my blanket to the kitchen (we were all hanging out in the kitchen because Big Bird managed to break her futon so it wouldn't stay upright....(could it be the 5 of us all crunched on the thing or could it be her trying to give one giant lap dance for us?).   In the kitchen I tried to sit in a chair in the corner...one of those chairs on wheels...put my feet up on the seat and shifted my weight just so...when suddenly I was thrown backwards and tipped the chair over with a CRASH.  I landed in a heap in the corner with the chair blocked me in.  I banged my head on the wall and smashed my elbow into the ground.  I decided to sit on the floor after that.    Big Bird and Matt & went to pick up George Webb's while Kit Kat, & Matt and I all cuddled up on the futon for a nap.  Hours and Hours and Hours (slight exaggeration) later Big Bird finally showed back up sans Matt & and sans FOOD!  Hungry, tired and now irritated we took our asses back to Kit Kat's for some sleep.    Ah yes, I'm still running around like a 22 year old.

Not sounding as harsh as it's cousin "fuckin'" it still gets the point across...but who started it and how did it get so popular?  Can you say it on tv?  I bet you can.  Who cares.  I need a Not Feeling Quite Up To Par Magnet Face.  Can I draw that?  I don't know how.   Did I go somewhere last night?  Where did I go?  What did I drink?  Why do I have some guys number shoved in the back pocket of my jeans?  Ugh.

      Last night was strange.  Teaser and I had a "celebration of food" last night accompanied with some half price margaritas.  The conversation was preoccupied by reminiscing of the days when we were attached at the hip.  Now a full time student, two part time jobs, a live in boyfriend and his live in teenager, she's hardly got time to blow her nose let alone party like a rock star.  I then returned home to call JB and tell him to bugger off however apparently he forgot how to answer his phone...that's a first.  I received a text in the am asking if he can call me after golf tonight.  My response to that?  NOTHING.    I spent almost an hour on the tele with Stacey's Mom last night, she's 41 and having almost the same problem that I've been dealing with, this leads me to question:  Does it ever end?  I also had hours of convo with my roomie where she pondered many of the same questions.  I feel as if I need to throw back some beers, get down and dirty in the mud and get rid of some of the estrogen that has been plaguing me for the last couple of weeks.  I've been such a girl...now where should I hide those feelings?  Oh and I've come to the conclusion with the steady help of Nutter Butter that I'm moving to the Dominican Republic and running a resort out of my home.  He won't let me go to Antartica because it's cold or something...so I'm off to be closer to the equator.  Adios!

      Is it possible to be elated and pissed at the same time?  I'm staying put in my house.  No moving for me.  I'm happy but at the same time still mad at the roomie for even starting the ball rolling on this.  I do feel like a huge weight has been lifted and I seem to have a smile on my face that I haven't seen for weeks.

      Life is just full of surprises.  The day before I am supposed to sign my lease I have two opportunities for other places to live.  Kit Kat's roommate has been canned and may not make it to live out the lease and in my current situation, Roomie's boyfriend may not be moving in after all.  Argh.  I told her that if she wants me to stay I will stay (shit I don't want to move and let's face it, it'll save me a good chunk of change), however I told her that whether he ends up moving in or not I will be staying until the end of October, either way.  In other news, I went for a late walk last night just when it started to thunder a little.  Well I shouldn't have taken that 3rd block cuz I got soaked!  It was awesome though.  I love thunderstorms and love running around in the rain.  The new kitten slept at the foot of my bed last night and Smokey stayed in my window all night.  Awwwww.  I might actually have to get a cat if I get my own place.  For some unGodly reason I'm starting to like them.

      Sad Magnet Face today.  There is nothing else in this world that I would like to do less right now as work.  I didn't know that my cloud had a wrong side, but this morning I managed to find it when I got up.    I didn't go camping as planned Saturday.  Instead I slept off a hang over and didn't make it over to my Newly Single Not So Much a Brother's house for the drive up.  Oh well, I had a nice relaxing evening doing not much of anything and in the end I can't complain.  It would have been fun to hang out with the boyz, do some fishin' and catch frogs with Short Fry, but the cold day and drinking wouldn't have appealed to me much.    Last night CPA and I went to see the whales.  We watched the waves crash into the breaker wall and reminisced about the old days of ShoeBall and nights spent at Grant Park watching the sun come up.   I had a very reflective weekend.  It seems like everything I did dredged up many memories from my past and many demons I haven't dealt with in years.  Thinking about all the people who have come in and out of my life.  People I'd all but forgotten and people who I'll never forget.  I realized that we are truly alone in this world, no matter how many people we surround ourselves with.

      Oh my God I finally got it to work...whew.  Yea so volleyball last night...headache and sore muscles today.  I stayed pretty active all winter and have had lots of sexercise the last few months, but man volleyball kicked my body's ass.  My shoulders and my hips are aching like bacon.  I was on my ass more than anything last night.    We all played very well but got our asses beat.  We were short a person but I think the real problem was that none of us had ever really played as a team together.  I'd played with Nutter Butter's Boy Toy last year and even played with 77th as a sub on his team before, but as a whole our team was not in synche.  It'll happen though, I'm excited cuz we've got some good players and it will be a ton of fun again this year.  That is of course if the ref's can get their shit together.  2 boys on the other team hit the ball over...no foul called.  We inform her of the rule and the ball is passed our way.  Kit Kat rocks 2 serves and we're in the middle of a long volley when 77th (a boy) hits it right over, ref calls a foul on us....um no that was one boy over the net on the first hit.  Replay, Kit Kat has lost the momentum of her previous 2 solid serves and serves it to our own first row.    Later in the game, I take a dive to bump the ball off the net and then up and over.  The ball catches in the net and bounces around a little bit, (mind you I'm on the ground here), ref calls me in the net.  Huh?  2 of my team mates say I was in the net and 2 of them say I wasn't. Personally I don't' believe my body even touched it, it was the ball that bobbled around in the net, not me!  3rd game, you are supposed to switch sides at 8 points, it's 11-3 and NBBT asks "Aren't we supposed to switch at 8".  Apparently the ref doesn't know that rule either.  I'm sorry but when you take a job as a volleyball ref don't you think you'd know the rules?  Everyone was telling me to cut her some slack "it's her first day" they said...but come on, it's the basics she didn't even  KNOW THE RULES  of the league for cryin' outloud.  I gave her a half assed apology at the end of the game and told her that I sometimes take the game a little too seriously and she'll get the hang of it.  Ah well, up side is that it's Friday.  I may take an impromptu camping trip with the boyz, leave tomorrow morning with my Newly Single Not So Much a Brother (I really gotta shorten that) and his Short Fry.  We'll see how much I get accomplished tonight.

      I am convinced my customers are morons.  Or just like to irritate me.  My favorite customer has yet again found another way to nit pick and prove once again she COULD compete for Mrs. AnalAmerica.  in printing most everything is priced per m (1000).  I quote her a form that comes 2100/case (as noted in quote) and the price for various case quantities.  I made the grave mistake of quoting her prices per m.   Her email to me:   can you give me a CASE price - not a /m price.  I will be ordering 5 cases   thank you   You dumb fucking bitch, you can't multiply it out?  Go fly a kite.

      Happy Magnet Face today.  I read this article on MSN this  morning about a cat that survived a 2 week trip cross country in a dresser drawer.  I'm less than impressed.  I used to have a hamster.  His name was Fugi (short version of fugitive because he was always getting out of his cage).  S would find him in the basement crawling across the clothes line or I'd catch him crawling around on the top shelf of the linen closet while reaching for a towel.  We had had him for about a year and a half  before we moved from our apartment and into my mom's basement.  Needless to say, Fugi had been missing for a couple days as we prepared for the move.  The day we locked up the apartment I searched every nook and cranny for him and was very sad when we had to leave without him.    Fast forward 6 months.  I'm grabbing a soda from the fridge in the pantry when I hear something scratching around.   We had gotten two dwarf hamsters who had babies and 3 of them had escaped into the night so I thought nothing of the scratching.  I searched for a couple minutes to see if maybe I could retrieve one of them.  When I came face to face with none other than my old friend Fugi!    If you've ever seen a dwarf hamster compared to a teddy hamster then you'll understand as to why I jumped back a few feet.  The size difference is rather much and I thought I had stumbled across a rat.  Well Fugi had gotten himself into a bit of a mess and had dropped into an empty dehumidifier bin and couldn't get out.  I reached in to grab him and he started hissing and barking...yes barking at me.  When I finally managed to get him into my hands his strength was unimaginable and I had to have S come help me restrain him.   Fugi had made it into one of our boxes at some point and been moved over with us.  He had survived on a bag of gardetto's that we later found with only bits and pieces left.  He had probably crawled into the dehumidifier for whatever drops of water he could find.   For a few weeks after we recovered him he made funny noises whenever we were around and many attempts were made to escape again.  That Fugi went on to our next apartment with us and followed me to my pad in Wauwatosa where he finally met his demise.  Fugi died at 4 1/2 years old..I actually shed a tear for that hamster...he was a survivor that Fugi.

      So I've been waiting for the nimrods in our plant to two hole punch some paper and shrink wrap it for me.  A project that should be done pretty  much the same day the order is sent down.  I sent the order in april 29th.  The excuse from the plant as to why it's not done:  "We're in a weird way right now"...that came straight from the Plant Manager.  What the hell does that even mean?

      Come out to O'Briens, we'll be up there around 8. Come up to Boz's and shoot some pool with us, I'll be there at 9. Come out to dinner with me tonight, we'll have some drinks afterward.  This  was my Friday and do you want to know what I did?  I said, no, no and no!  I stayed home and RELAXED.  Watched a little tv, did some cleaning and got all my laundry done.  Nice job!!  Can't say that about my Saturday though.  What a day/night.    I Started throwing them back around noontime and ended up leaving my pool banquet half in the bag.  I went home at 7:30 to change and took a brief 15 minute snooze at 8:00 then got up and changed into my night attire.  Headed up to Boz's to wait on the girls, had a few there and they snatched me up to go downtown.    Tangerine - stay away.  High prices, pretentious bar goers and a ONE STALL WOMAN'S ROOM!!!  With a smoke glass door!?!?  Who wants to see the silhouette of a woman pulling up her skirt?  Don't answer that.  It was a good time though, I had a nice start to the evening, as soon as I paid for my drinks a man next to me started a conversation, which ended up lasting almost the whole time we were there.  He bought me a drink and birthday shot for my gal Kit Kat, he was very cute but removing his hat revealed quite the receding hair line.  Once our group was assembled at Tangerine we were to go across the street to Eve....unfortunately khaki shorts prevented us from entering so we headed to Water Street.    Water Street - crazy party people.  Not conducive to good dancing nor good conversation.  I followed the crowd to the two M's and decided I don't really like either anymore.  But it was a good time...much of my time was spent dragging Kit Kat around and getting boyz to give her birthday kisses!  We all went to Kit Kat's for an after bar...bad idea on my part.  Should have gone home as planned but I feared for who would drive Kit Kat's car as I had drank myself sober but others were not so lucky.  After some drama and some tears, a very tired Funquita decided to head home.  I stole Kit Kat's drove home at 5 in the morning.  Talk about ready to crash.  Sunday was spent cleaning mama's house for her company coming to town.  Chicken and potatoes on the grill and a showing of "Kill Bill" was the topper for the evening.  I'm dead tired today and in desperate need of more relaxation.  Problem is I'm at work here with no relief in sight!

      In a time where everything is available on demand, one would think that our time would be freed up to rest.  However it seems as though the more time we have, the faster it gets filled.    I don't stay idle for longer than an hour and I hardly allow myself time for relaxation.  The only time I seem to spend lounging and doing nothing much else seems to be when I'm either a. hungover or b. living on no sleep and my body must collapse.    I can order anything from food to furniture delivered to my door.  Money basically comes in the form of air.  I can tell someone my debit number over the phone and receive goods and services.  I can call someone to come and fix my cable, my heater, my window, my car, mow my lawn, clean my house, deliver groceries and more.  I can receive word on a loan applied for within minutes, my credit card payment can take money right from my checking account within hours and I can access any bit of information I could ever want just by dialing up the internet from the comfort of my own home.  But the one thing I cannot order or download is rest and relaxation.  I busy myself with friends, boys, family, and events (birthdays, parties, bars, golf, volleyball, banquets, softball games, dinners, exercise) every day and night.    I attempted to take a nap the other day before getting ready to go out and my phone rang incessantly and I even had two visitors at my door.  On top of it couldn't rest because I kept thinking of the dishes that needed to be done and the laundry piling up.  My time would be better spent accomplishing something rather than lying in bed.  So instead, I sat on the couch and flipped channels for an hour and a half and didn't do anything.  Silly isn't it?    When I go on vacation I like to plan all the things I want to do and have some vague idea of which days I'll do what.  Leaving me exhausted coming home wanting another few days to recover.  But I've decided that when I go to Hawaii I'm going to plan to do nothing.  I have ideas of what I want to do while I'm there, but mainly I just want to relax and not feel like I have to run run run and do all kinds of things.  I'd like to take a surfing lesson, maybe a couple. I'd like to go parasailing. I'd like to go cliff diving. I'd like to go snorkeling. I'd like to go out on jet skis. I'd like to go deep sea fishing. I'd like to go to a luau. I'd like to go to see the Dole Plantation and the North Shore. I'd like to go to Diamond Head Volcano. I'd like to go to the site of Pearl Harbor and see the Arizona and Missouri Monument and the Bowlfin Submarine.  I'd like to rent a scooter and cruise the coast line. I'd like to eat at Mama's Fish House.

As if that weren't bad enough as I fell backward I grabbed the nearest thing to me, which just so happened to be the boss's netherlands.  Yes folks, I grabbed my boss's package.    Is my face ever going to return to it's natural color?

      Sleepy, Excited, Crazy Magnet face today.  Went out AGAIN last night.  And am going out AGAIN tonight.  Haven't done the during the week thing in a while, and after this week I probably won't do it for a long time AGAIN!  Watched my boyz play softball last night and headed out to celebrate their loss.  I had some strange conversation with Big C last night.  Rehashing things that happened 4? 5? years ago after which he told me about S's reaction to seeing M a short time ago...must say I wasn't expecting to hear any of that at all!  I was smiling that S still has that passion...um or something like that for lack of a better word.  When ghosts from your past make an appearance in such strange ways it makes you think about everything you do.  What will what I do today effect events in my future?  I sat up last night and thought about the last 5 or so years of my life and realized just how much I fuct things up...with so many people...I think I'm relationship retarded.

      Sad magnet face today.  I am officially single again. Not a bad thing.  Not a good thing.  Just a thing.  I had my "final" talk with JB last night, told him I had to say goodbye.  It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  I then proceeded to go out and have a few beers and stay out too late.  Went to Sully's to meet Kit Kat and Algebra Challenged and a bunch of people for some chica's birthday.    I got hit on at the gas station on the way there, some dudes on some crotch rockets.  I was tempted to throw caution to the wind and ask for a ride like the old days of cruisin' hwy 100 in the Double G or my Mustang, that we so named "Speedracer" in honor of my own nickname.  Then at the bar I gave my number to 6-pack for some unGodly reason...cuz he asked?!?!  That's a phone call I won't answer.    My newly-single-not-so-much-a-brother-Matt (I must shorten this), Clay and Chris all came out to meet me and hang out.  Clay will now be referred to as "Slightly Stoopid" as his shirt showed off the name of some band that  I've  never heard of, from long beach and in the styles of Sublime so I've been told.  Anyway, thought of the day:   People are like boomerangs.  They drift out of your life but are surely to come back at some point.  You have to love them while they are here.

      Introducing a new character to the story of my life:  valentino  valentino has spent the last 7 1/2 years in jail.  I dated him slightly before S and I hooked up.  I call him valentino because of valentine's day 1997.  It was a Friday evening and I had spent the last 14 hours at work.  I was managing a bar and waitressing Friday and Saturday nights as well.   My car had taken a crap on me and I needed a ride home.  Well valentino thought hanging out with his friends was more important and he told me that I should call my mom.  So instead I called S and I hung out the rest of the night.  He showed up with a dozen roses and chocolate covered cherries.  Two days later S bought me a diamond heart necklace and told me he was falling in love with me...  Well that valentine's day was the last I heard from valentino because the next day he was arrested in some bar fight and ended up getting a bad deal and sent to prison in Tennessee for the next 10-15 years.  Seven and a half years, countless letters and dozens of phone calls later he is being realized.  June 1st of this year he will walk out a free man.  The last letter I just received was very hopeful for him and I to go out and start seeing each other again.    He's come to this epiphany about life and tells me that my letters have been very encouraging to him and have changed his outlook on life.    SIDE NOTE:  I should seriously consider counseling prisoners because my old friend D-Duck was in and out of juvey and jail since he was 13 and this last stint he served 4 1/2 years for assault and battery.  I wrote to him for all that time as well and he came out with a new outlook and completely grateful for all my words of wisdom, he's been out for 3 years and hasn't got into any trouble at all.  END SIDE NOTE  Well congratulations valentino on your reform, but I don't think my pops nor my moms would appreciate me bringing home an ex-con!!!!

      BOTTOMS UP   Alcohol is the enemy of good sex, at least as far as men are concerned, so avoid men who drink to excess, stresses Masterton. "No matter how worldly-wise and attractive they seem to be, men like these will eventually drag you into a world of hangovers and snoring and not much sex."   Martini drinkers maker terrible lovers because inebriation comes quickly: "They will be very bad-tempered in the mornings, and if they can't perform in bed they will inevitably blame you, just like they blame the rest of the world for everything that's gone wrong in their lives," says Masterton.   "Beer drinkers are much better adjusted, and much more sociable, but they do tend to be socially and sexually immature, and lack sexual sophistication, and more annoyingly, they tend to make multiple treks to the bathroom."   He says lovers of dry white wines make creative and sensitive lovers, and will give you some very intense experiences; while men who prefer richer, deeper reds will be strong, passionate and long lasting.   Try to find a man who enjoys a drink in moderation: "After all, he's supposed to be looking after you, and if he can't take care of you in a bar, how can he take care of you in bed?

      Devilish Magnet Face today.  I'm feeling naughty today.    Refreshed from an evening spent at home relaxing.  Well...talking on the phone mostly.  I swear it seems that every time I try to have a quiet evening watching tv I end up on the phone for hours.  Nobody's fault but damn why can't I just shut up?  Talked to cpa about her new boy toy =)  Somebody's fallin' in lo-o-o-ve.  Talked to Stacy's mom about her adventures this weekend and was filled in on some blanks I've been trying to figure out.   Then it was Kit Kat's turn and also made misc. phone calls to get things straightened out for volleyball.  I can't believe how fast this year is going...jesus it's already May.       Funniest thing I heard yesterday:   "Sug (pronounced like Sugar) you don't need an excuse to love me, just plant your ass in my garden and let's grow"   ???????  what this means i'm not quite sure ??????

      I had a very nice weekend.  drank every day of it for a change, but it was very nice.    had teaser and kit kat over for a girly night.  I cooked dinner and made alcohol lined smoothies and we watched movies and gossiped about boys.  then we watched this movie called Henry and June....oh my God the sex talk came out after that.  It was borderline porn!  All 3 of us were wishing we had somebody to go to bed with.  good times!  Saturday was spent shopping and trying on clothes that were too small.  I'm going to start shopping at Omar's for cryin' out loud!  I got some cute shoes though and a pretty pink girl skirt too =)  we almost got run off the road by some psycho in an expedition.  trying to pass me on a 25 mile an hour service type road, she ran up the curve narrowly missing a pole and then almost tipped her ass over...man I wish she would have hit me.  I wanted another excuse to get out of the car and bitch slap her after she flipped ME off.    Went out to the Ale House and asked some chick if she ever thought about shaving off her mustache!!!  She asked for it though, as I excused myself to walk around her she gave me a dirty look and then turned to her boyfriend and called me a bitch..I decided embarrassing her would be more fun than burning her with my cigarette.  cpa and exit showed up to my surprise and hung with us for a while, tres cool.  after having a ten minute conversation about my breasts with a couple of 40 year old broads and their boyfriend we decided to leave and find fun elsewhere.  I wanted attention and damn it I was going to get it....off to water street we went.  attention I got.  a drunk kit kat and I crashed in my cloud around 2:30 and we cuddled ourselves to sleep after having a moment..."seriously you're my best friend I don't know what I'd do without you"....LOL!  What a slobering sentimental sap I am when I've drunken too much.  then there was yesterday.  it started on a bad note, but with the given situation it was comical and started to feel more like an adventure.  golfed like dorf and shot a 111 for the day.  I broke a golf cart sign with my powerhouse shooting.  shanked an 8 iron right into the damn thing and broke it right off it's posts!  too much alcohol was consumed on and off the golf course.  ran into my old roommate at the bar which was an awesome surprise.   JB was texting me and called twice before I relieved him of his misery and returned the phone call.  Probably not a good idea since I was pretty shit faced and already upset.  We're having dinner Tuesday...argh more conversations I don't want to have.  And here I sit at work with nothing to do today.  So I just sit here and type until someone comes around the corner....rambling.

      ALOHA-2 more days and I'm checking my bags in at the airport and getting ready to board the plane!  This is my last day of work before I leave...unless of course I decide to come in for a couple of hours tomorrow which I may just do.  Getting ready to go on vacation is hella stressful at work.    I've got most of what I wanted to get accomplished at home finished.  I'm bailing on the Summerfest plan tonight simply because I'm still sick sick sick and I need the time for rest and relaxation.  Tomorrow I've got to make up my golf match and go to Mags for my pedicure, then it's off to Summerfest with the gals.    I saw Jailbird last night for the first time since he's been a Freebird.  It was really good to see him and to my own surprise those old feelings came back to me.  I now remember why it was so hard for me to choose between him and S all those years ago.  Keeping things strictly as friends may be a little harder than I thought. Talked to Teaser only moments ago and she was surprised to hear me talk like that.    She said that I have the highest standards of anybody she's ever met and she can't believe that I won't date a guy with a kid but I'd even consider dating an ex-con.  I didn't say I was considering it!!  I just said I wish things were different.  I was a little surprised to hear that she thought this of me though, she also said I was super picky.  This I knew, I've also come to the realization that as much as I say I don't fear being vulnerable and am a very open person, I've got walls built that need to come down in order for me to let somebody into my world.  Revelations all over the place today.    Hawaii is a much needed vacation and I'm hoping to get my thoughts together on my life and where I want it to go.  I can't just keep coasting along and expect things to come to me as I have...okay too heavy for a day before the day before a vacation!!!  ALOHA!

      3 days and so much to do.  I spent most of last night in bed coughing and sneezing and chasing my runny nose.  I should have been sleeping but I decided to flip channels and finish my book.  Then for some reason beyond myself I arose and went down to the computer.  I needed to download all the pictures on my digital camera so I could clear them out for my trip.  I also needed to make a disk for CPA.  There was 105 pictures on that thing.  So I started to fold the laundry as I waited and started a load in the washer.  By the time I was done dicking around on the computer with other things I had folded half of my laundry and had a load in the dryer and one in the washer.  Jeez...now it's 10:45 and I've got laundry going that should really be finished lest it be wrinkled in the morning.   Went to bed instead.  Couldn't sleep.  Wasn't tired anymore.  Then when I did fall asleep I coughed and sneezed myself awake again.  Tired as all get out today.    I've got to shoot pool tonight as Smiley had his appendix taken out in emergency surgery yesterday so I'm the sub. Tomorrow I've got volleyball and summerfest.  Do I bail on Summerfest?  We'll see how I feel I suppose.  I'm going to the doc today to get on some heavy antibiotics.  I think I have bronchitis, I think I'm dying.    Aloha.

      The scrummdiddlyumptios applicant for the IT position did not get hired =(  Damn.  I was looking forward to leaning a little more about computers ;)    Sweetest thing said to me all week: "I have to go but damn Lisa, you are just so hard to put down!"    My dumb response to this "I'm like a good book hey?"  Yea  uh sometimes my wit escapes me.   Due to the inclement weather inside my head I have opted to take some Nyquil when I get home and escape to my cloud for the remainder of the evening.  Those of you who know anything about me know that this will last all of about an hour before I start getting cabin fever.  Started to pack last night....the cats helped by lying down in my suitcase AFTER I had a layer of clothes packed.  Thanks guys!    Aloha!

      I am sick.  I've got a sore throat and a headache.  I've been sneezing like crazy and my nose is running all over my desk.  I've been coughing so hard I pulled my back yesterday.  I'm tired and cranky.  My nose hurts from blowing it so much and my eyes are swollen and red.  I hope I get better by Saturday cuz I do NOT want to be flying in a plane for 8 hours with a head cold!!!!  Any suggestions to knock this out of my system??????  I can't stomach tea and I don't normally do cold medicines (allergies and all)...I need home remedies.  I've been eating Vitamin C pills like candy and drinking water until I float away.    =(  I need a big fluffy blanket and a boy to smooth my hair as I lay on the couch with my box of kleenex.    Yes, yes I would love some cheese.

      I don't want to hear about how many fucking t shirts you are selling in Houston, I don't care how much fucking money this new website is going to make you, I couldn't give a shit less about how many fucking phone calls you got over the weekend.  Congratulations BH on your website and Hold 'Em items that are selling like hotcakes, I'm fucking glad you are on your cell phone closing deals like crazy, but I have fucking work to do.  You're running a business out of your home, keep you fucking work there and quit causing me problems here. You're the VP for God's sakes, how about some fucking professional behavior jerk off.  I just walked up to our swear jar, plopped in a dollar and said "fuck fuck fuck FUCK".  I don't feel any better.    My stress level is rising today.  I swear sometimes I cannot work with BH to save my life.  He interrupts me every 5 minutes (seriously, I'm not exaggerating) and most times it's for the stupidest reasons...like he needs to know at this exact moment who's attention an order was shipped to.  Like that was important enough to interrupt me while I'm sorting through some complicated project.  Jesus Christ.  And then he wonders why I have 16 things I'm working on at once...well duh!  Fuckin A I can't wait to get the fuck out of here for a week.  Breathe.

      So there's this guy Bobby who goes up to Boz's, (my Cheers).  I've met him a bunch of times and he is friends with some people I play pool with.  I would call him an acquaintance at the very least.    Bobby is scrumdiddlyumptious.  One of those people that you just want to put in your pocket and take out once in a while to look at. But then he opens his mouth and you think to yourself "thank God you're pretty".  Upon first introduction to Bobby, him and I proceeded to flirt with each other and in true high school form, Stacey's mom gave him my  number "for me".  Yea, that was quite embarrassing given how drunk I was.  That was months and months ago.  The next time I saw him I laughed it off with him and since then I've seen him a few times and we've exchanged pleasantries.  Here's the thing...he's Jailbird's brother.  Through writing for the last 7 1/2 years I have come to realize that a couple of the people I know at Boz's know Jailbird.  I also would run into his ex roommate's girlfriend there and we've talked.  So I knew that there were some connections between Boz's and Jailbird. Now I'm just a tidge embarrassed that I tried to mack on his brother.  Not to mention the fact that Jailbird is totally jealous that his brother hit on me.  Most of you won't understand why this is all so funny to me but it's something noteworthy in my world.   Just another reason why I think Milwaukee is too small!!!!

      Well this is shaping up to be one fine Monday.  On my way down the alley this morning headed for work, a lady in an Intrigue backed her ass up right into my truck as I am pulling through.  Nice.  Nice damage and nice whiplash.  I slammed on my brakes and honked the horn about 27 times in the quick 3 second reaction period.  My lower back is now aggravated again and now I've got some crappy damage to my truck.  No dent, just part of the running board by the wheel well is half torn off.  I think I'd rather have a fucking dent.  I've got a sore throat and no voice, I have sunburn that is killing me and my neck is sorer than usual.  Yes it's a great day...okay I'm done bitching.  Now I'll ramble about my weekend.  Friday:  "Six in the City" is an elusive group of people who have happy hours across the city starting at 6pm.  It's a sort of catch me if you can event.  Headed down to the Park East for Jazz on the Roof which was moved to Aqua...by he end of the night we had gone to 9 different bars.  The Terrace, McGillicuddy's, Flannery's, Tangerine, Kennedyz, Three, Eve then finally back to Flannery's.  Exhausted we called it a night   Saturday:  8 am, Vici's bright an early for my hair appointment with Mags.  4 1/2...yes 4 1/2 hours later I walked out of the salon with freshly waxed eyebrows, softly parafined hands and a whole new hair color.  I love it but the only thing I was sad about was losing the red in my hair.  I got home, threw on my dress and strappy heels, put on some make up just in time for Big Gay Mishko to ring my bell.  We headed to the church for Lisa and Paul's wedding where I realized that many of the guests were people I knew from grade school!  The wedding reception was an absolute blast.  Big Gay Mishko's very straight and very cute friend Delpino met up with us there and we all proceeded to have a fun, uninhibited drunk ass evening of dancing and celebrating.  We all made it home in one piece and I scored some couch time with Delpino only to realize that he's got a 7-year old daughter =(  I gave him my digits anyway but have no intention of following through on that one.  Hot or not I don't do kids.  Sunday:  Up at the unGodly hour of 7:30, I stumbled my way around and headed over to daddy's for our annual father's day golf outing.  The first 9 was a challenge...I couldn't do much to save my game, until I birdied the 7th hole.  A 188 yard par 3.  I tee off and land on the green 15 feet from the pin...then rock even more by making the putt.  The back 9 was much much better, 2 more birdies - one on a par 5 I might add - and 3 pars I finished the back with a 47.  Shooting a 104 for the day I was quite happy with my performance.  Red as a lobster and tired as hell we headed to DJ's for the "best burger in 'Skego".  Yum.  Off to the homestead where the boyz came over for pizza and a movie.  Can I just go to sleep??  Nope.  I don't know what it was or why but everything from the way he chewed his food to the way he rubbed aloe on my shoulders annoyed the hell out of me.     5 DAYS

      Now this is the kind of email I like to get :  Hi.  Sorry I wasn't more straight with the envelopes.  You’re so good at your job, I just expect that you can read my mind sometimes.  :)  Thank you so much for the quote, it looks like once again you've got it all organized for me!   Don’t ever hesitate to ask if I’m not making myself clear.    By the way, I talked to Oren and he spoke very highly of the way you handled the CMS situation.  Thank you again!  Let me know if you want some tickets to the Summerfest concerts!!!  -S Rock 102.1

      When I am depressed I think of all the things I can do to depress myself further:  watch a sad movie, look through my old photo albums of vacations I took with S, take a walk by myself by the lake and think about all the things I've lost in my life, lock myself in my room with the lights off and stare at the ceiling thinking about all the things I could be doing and how much fun everyone else in the world MUST be having.  When I am happy I think of all the things I want to do and get hyper:  go rollerblading in the park, take a bicycle ride, go down to the lake with a blanket and a book, clean (yes it's insane but cleaning is something I do when I'm in a good mood), shop, cook a meal or bake cookies.    Today I am a mixture of happy and depressed.  I came in to work happy as hell that it's Friday and I've got fun plans this weekend.  Happy as hell that this time next week I'll be at home packing my bags for Hawaii.  Then something happened and I received a huge dose of sadness.  It's amazing what one person's words can do to another.  They can stir up emotions and thoughts that you have put away for years.  They can bring back feelings that you thought weren't there anymore.  But in fact these feelings were just hidden, masked by every day life.  We as humans only function by ignoring our own mental health and pretending that things don't affect us.  We go on through our ordinary days in a sort of fog, never in touch with our true selves.  We work, we run errands, we pay bills, we play and we play hard, we drink, we have sex, we conversate with each other, but rarely do we sit inside our own heads and listen to what we need.  So busy trying to do everything that we forget how to heal.  I have emotions I never dealt with that I forgot about.  Things I pretended were okay but in truth had merely been pushed aside until something brought them back.  I need a "Mental Health Day".  We all need a "Mental Health Day".    I say I've got all this love to give to someone if I could just find that person to love and accept me for everything I am, why can't that person be ME?  Instead of trying to figure everyone else out we should figure ourselves out.    I left the love of my life to find myself.  I was my boyfriend's girlfriend.  I didn't know how to function on my own really.  I've come a long way since that day...3 years and one day ago.  But I can still be derailed a bit by that realization of how long we've been apart.   June 17th 2001 I came home from golfing with my dad on Father's Day and plain as day told him I couldn't do it anymore.  He and I had no future and it was only a matter of time before things ended.  Why were we holding on?  He didn't want to marry me, I wasn't even sure he still loved me.  Not the way he once did anyway.  I realized last night over beers that it was the 3 year anniversary of the day we broke up.  Cheers to that.

       8 DAYS!   Brewer's lost, first game I've been at where they lost =(  Ah well, Mariner's sooooooooo did not deserve it either.    Tired today.  My week has been nothing but go, go, go.  Argh, not a break in site until Sunday night.  Even then my dance card may be filled.  The new boy returns from his Indy trip and will undoubtedly want to get together.  This new boy is a mystery to me, maybe it's the age thing?  Who knows, I have to hyper analyze everything.  I need to work on NOT doing that.    I need to make a to do list for Hawaii.  I've got lots to finish before my trip.  Get my thoughts organized and things in place.  Oh my God I can't wait!

      I'm still at work.  Ugh.  This is awful.  Preparing to go for a vacation is worse than anything.  I've got so much I need to prepare for and the work just keeps piling up.  Plus tomorrow I leave around noon to go to the Brewer's game with clients.  Seats behind home plate and lunch and beers on the VP, can't go wrong there!  Except that it's business!  Ugh.  Roomie's having the new boy over and cooking him dinner tonight.  She's called me like 3 times and every time has made mention..."Yea I'm cooking dinner for Paul tonight"...if you're hinting for me to scram why not just come out and say it?  Don't worry chica, I'll be out of your hair for the evening.  Pool was the original plan but apparently they don't need a mediocre player like me, so it's off to watch the boyz play softball.  I'd rather stay home and do laundry and clean for Hawaii..yes I said HAWAII...10 DAYS!, but alas, I would feel intrusive on the happy couple.  Ah ha...I'm going home now, I've had all I can take this fine day.  Ciao bella.

      I'm melting over here.  They are interviewing one of the hottest men I've ever seen for the IT position over here.  He's like 6'4", dark blonde hair with deep blue eyes...scrumdiddliumtious.  I'd like to climb him like a jungle gym.  I shook his hand and I swear my knees drooped.  He winked at me and gave me one of those killer smiles where you can almost see the sparkle in his teeth.  Mmm. I think I'll have him for lunch.

      Today is a crazy work day.  I have gotten 73 emails since 8 this morning.  8 of which were personal and 12 of which were read receipts but oh my god.  I also just realized that I leave for Hawaii in 11 days and I need to clean everything up so there aren't any loose strings left behind when somebody else has to do my job.  They are freaking over here about my leaving and worried that things are going to get screwed up.  The VP is freaking that nobody is going to be able to take care of things here.  It's kind of nice but it also sucks cuz I know it'll be a nightmare when I return!    all of a sudden my popularity has sprouted new wings.  I am going to be running around the next two weeks busy every day.  Maybe I'll forgo sleeping and pack and get things accomplished in the wee hours of the morning.  argh.

      Happy birthday Andy!    He's 27 today and my youngest cousin, with the exception of Toby and Alexander who I'm beginning to doubt even exist.  I met Toby once when I was like 5 or 6 maybe.  Alexander is just a myth who lives in the pictures that I see now and again...They live in Seattle with my Aunt Kendra and Uncle Dan who is a Pastor.  I bet none of you even knew I had an uncle who's a Pastor!

      Another one bites the dust here at the great factory o' crap.   But I want to write about my pleasant weekend and thank all those who were involved =)  Friday:  Comedy Cafe on the agenda.  Little did I know I was being set up on a sort of blind date.  I found that out around 2:30 in the afternoon.  My roomie was setting me up with her new guy's best friend.  My review, he's tall, he's cute, he's got a good solid career, he's into motorcycles and motor cross, he's attentive, he's generous and an all around nice guy.  We had a fun night with everyone at "The Corner Bar and then off to the Comedy Cafe where we lost most of our crowd.  Only about 6 of us made it back to the Corner Bar where more drinks were had and more darts were played.    Saturday:  After waking up in a strange apartment in a strange bed I slowly remembered the four of us crashing at dude's downtown apartment.  Don't worry mom, I was a good girl.  After hitching a ride in his convertible Miata this fella asked me to lunch.  We decided to tag along with the roomie and her two little cousin's to Kopp's after I freshened up a bit.  At Kopp's we were asked  to join them bowling.  We went.  Roomie's brother, we'll call him Alchi, hit on me relentlessly and finally gave up when I beat him arm wrestling (ok I cheated).   After bowling, dude went home and so did we.  I then accompanied the roomie, her new guy, the two kids and invited CPA along to the Brewer's game.  I must say it was an awesome game and I got me a Scott Pacendick bobblehead.  Good day good day.  Cancelled my evening plans with Teaser and Ghetto Girl to stay home and watch "Jumanji" with the chitlins.    Sunday:  CAKE WAR! Can't wait to get the pictures back!  Then I highlighted Kit Kat's hair.  Apparently the jury is still out on the results though.  Hmmm, I wish it was Saturday again.  Hmmmm, 12 DAYS!!   Hmm, I wish I wasn't at work.  Hmmm, I'm easily distracted as usual.    Ciao bella.

      "CAKE FIGHT" someone screams amongst the chaos as I get a handful of cake smashed into the side of my head.  My reaction?  A handful of cake thrust at the 12 year old who trashed my hair with frosting and bits of chocolate cake.  "Thwap" was the noise it made as it crashed against her neck and stuck to her and started to slide down.  The other one stuck her hands in the cake and squished the frosting between her fingers, where that cake landed I don't' know.  But my next endeavor was smearing my frosting covered hand all over her face and neck, making sure I rubbed it in real nice.  It started as a playful joke.  I was helping Stacy's mom with one of the grad cakes and as I turned to set it down on the table it started to slide of the platter.   I made a quick recovering but in the process my 4 fingers ended up stuck in the side of the cake.  My other hand had grabbed the other side as the cake smashed into a cabinet. But I saved the cake with minimal (or a little above minimal) damage.  I was squatting down laughing so hard I almost peed my pants.  Luckily everyone was laughing with me instead of getting angry!  In a playful gesture I took my frosting covered fingers and swiped them all over Dale's face.  Ha ha ha right?  Apparently when you've got a bunch of 11 through 14 year olds in a room, it's not a good idea to smear frosting on someone's face because before I could say boo the kids had their hands in that cake and declared a cake war with me being the target.  I don't think I've ever laughed so hard in my life.  Cake on my legs, my shorts, my shirt, my neck, my face, my hair...but it was Yu-u-u-mmy.   12 DAYS!

      animation, beration, congregation, degradation, emanation, fortification, gratification, hallucination, illumination, justification, k, lamination, masturbation, notification, ovation, personification, qualification, rumination, salivation, trepidation, unification, verification, w, x, y, zonation (?)  Taught to me while I was drunk on a bus touring all the haunted houses in the area, the "ation" game became a challenge.  CPA and I would  play the "ation" game when we were at a bar and bored out of our gourd. We used to name the people in the bar or name songs with certain themes or words in the title, but that got old so we took up the "ation" game.  After a few drinks the game became much more interesting and challenging to remember what's been said and what hasn't.  Due to the fact that we both have very large vocabularies, the game continued on for months until it finally dribbled down to a one word text message.  What do ya say cpa?  Up for another challenge =)

      I recently had my emissions tested.  When I renewed my plates I was going to order personalized plates to read "Funqui". Pronounced Fun-qwee or even Fun-key if you prefer.  But alas, my small pea brain forgot that this was my plan and I'm stuck with TMR-### for the next year!  15 days.

      i don't know what i did to piss you off.  well i have some idea.  i think you're more like dissappointed maybe even baffled.  i don't know why i did it.  i wasn't thinking.  i needed something, somebody.  but what i got wasn't anything close to what i wanted.  i had a break in rational judgement.  i could blame it on alcohol but the whole time it was going on, i kept thinking it was wrong.  i even thought of you and worried you'd know. and now you're mad at me, you're distant and now i know exactly why.  i have these moments when it doesn't matter to me what kind of reactions my actions are going to have and all that matters is my feelings at the moment.  some need inside of me must be met and i don't care what happens to meet it.  it's a sickness, i'm like a damn disease.  stay away from  me before you too are taken.  you hate me, you love me, you fear me, you covet me.  you don't know.  you never will.  i don't mean to take away, i want to give.

      Ever feel like you just need to laugh but there doesn't seem to be anything to laugh about?  I think I'm in a funk.    I go through these stages where everything in life is fun and makes me laugh.  I go out and laugh and let loose.  I smile at everyone and give hugs and kisses to my friends.  I feel like everyone's my best friend and I appreciate the hell out of everyone.   Then there are these other times where nothing makes me smile, my current funk.  I walk around with a scowl on my face and people avoid having to talk to me.  I go out and for the most part sit around just staring at people wondering why they are having a good time and I am not.  I start feeling like none of my friends even like me and I'll never find the one to share my life with.    Maybe I'm schizo, or maybe I just need to eat more iron.   Tonight I have a feeling that my plans are going to fall through and I'll just end up sitting at the homestead.  Although I am getting better at regaining that independence and am okay with spending time with myself.  I actually bladed by myself last night.  It's funny.  Each time a relationship ends I go back to surrounding myself with people and I can't seem to do anything alone.  But it passes and I again realize that nobody knows that I was just rejected and I CAN go out in public without ridicule.  Random thought process today.  I think I'll have a V8.  Ciao bella, see you in heaven.

      17 days!   Today is Employee Appreciation Day over here.  What does that mean exactly?  They have lunch catered for us.  Usually it's a tent outside, "door" prizes, and a nice couple of hours spent chit chatting with each other.  This year, we're up in the lunch room.  Catering is by some no name local company and we are allotted time from 11:30am to 1:00pm...oh and it's bring your own drink.  Yea baby, I feel appreciated now!  The ironic thing is that I had to write our promo newsletter this month and the theme was Company Picnics and Employee Appreciation...I had major writer's block and kept walking around the office asking people "How do you write about employee appreciation when you don't know what it's like to feel appreciated?"

      I just made a hair appointment to have a full color, haircut and highlights.  I've never had my hair professionally colored or highlighted before.  I always just did it myself.  It's funny cuz I'm looking at all the pictures on my cube wall and the crazy hair I've had.  From red hair 3 years ago, to full blown blonde 2 1/2 years ago, then red with blonde highlights a year ago, then blond again, then brown with blonde highlights, then blonde again, and now it's somewhere between red and blonde with dark dark roots overtaking my whole head.  My dad's g-friend's daughter is at Vici in training and is going to do something "spectacular" to my hair.  It'll be a dark honey blonde with brown low lights underneath soft blonde highlights with red lowlights added for good measure.  Should I be scared?

      Are we ready to proceed?  After her hand left the grip of mine I watched Steve's face as he beamed in my direction.  Was he surprised I was so nice, was he glad to see me, was he gloating?  For the first time ever, I couldn't read what Steve's eyes were saying.    For the next hour or so we all continued to hang out by the beer tent.  I couldn't really tell you how many beers I/we finished in that time, but I know it was atleast 3 - 16 oz bottles with the possibility of a shot mixed in there(?).  The longer we stayed the more people we picked up along the way.  Jeffy and SC eventually wandered over and Slightly Stupid became a part of the mix at some point.  S & S were away from each others side for majority of the evening, but anytime he came close to me I thought she was going to burn holes right through my jean jacket with her eyes.    Eventually alcohol got the better of me and I thought it a grand idea to pull Shannon aside and talk to her.  I don't remember most of what I said but do know that some of it may or may not have been appropriate.  My purpose was to make her feel comfortable and make sure that it wasn't a big deal that I was around.  To tell her that eventually this was going to happen and I found out that she was waiting for it and wanted to get it over with as much as I did.  In the end we made nice and on some strange level made friends.  We finally rejoined the group twenty minutes later when Big C came over and put an end to the seriousness.  Off to McGillicuddy's we go.  Yes,we.  Why at this point am I not running for the hills?  I couldn't, none of the guys would let me be backed out of the group by her.  You see the secret is...nobody likes her.  Shhh.    So it's out at the beer garden at McGillicuddy's having more beers and more good times.  2 more beers later I think it's a grand idea to steal Steve away from the group and have the same conversation with him.  After all, I just wanted to make sure nothing was awkward.  I heard such things as "You know I'll always love you" "Everything I told you that day was honest and sincere, nobody will ever take your place.  You were more to me than anybody else ever would be." "I think about you a lot, more than you probably think I do" "You will always be Auntie Lisa to Dylan, there is no Auntie Shannon and never will be.  That kid loves you to death and it makes me so happy to know that you're still around"  "My friends all love you, there's no reason you shouldn't be around.  I hear things Lisa and I know what's going on with you, I ask questions" "You know me better than anybody else ever has, we're always connected." "I've always said you have a huge heart and mean well you deserve somebody who will give you everything you ever wanted, I tried but we just didn't work."    It's funny cuz I still can't figure out if he was trying to convince me of something or if he was trying to assure himself.  For some reason we rehashed all the old news, it was a good thing.  It was good to revisit that after all the emotions weren't quite so raw.  I tried to keep the conversation really light and just make things not so awkward (which they weren't at all anyways) but he just kept telling me all these things about his feelings...what gets me is why he would bring it up and rehash it all of his own accord unless he was unsure.  But that's just me reading into and overanalyzing things that don't need to be.  After an hour of talking off by ourselves we ended the convo and headed back towards the group..  He gave me a hug and whispered in my ear "Never forgotten".  Off I went to the bathroom and when I came back, we were leaving.  Him and Shannon way ahead of the group and me way at the end.    Finally my cell phone was working again as I drove out of the parking structure and I dialed all the peeps I misplaced at the festival.  I was in serious need of rehashing my evening or making some sort of sense of it.  Nobody was anywhere and I left somewhat frantic messages for multiple people, but nobody to talk to =(  Not even my room mate was home.  I reflected on the evening the entire way home and came up with the following:  When I saw Steve I had an adrenaline rush all through my body.  When Shannon came up I freaked a little but held it together and managed to hold conversations with her.  I saw them touch on two occasions, as he guided her through the wood chips in the beer garden and later as we stood by the bar they had a quick kiss.  I felt nothing as I saw them kiss.  Nothing, no jealousy, no anger, no disgust, nothing.    When I walked off with him to talk we sat in silent for a minute and just stared at each other.  His eyes smiled and we had a conversation without words, until he finally blurted out "It's great to see your face", to which I replied "I just brought you over here to stare at you".  It was all very cute and flirty but it made me realize that my feelings for Steve aren't there.  I wasn't sure until then, I mean I've been saying that I'm over it and I've had my closure, but I knew that I'd never really know my true feelings until I saw him and I was tested.    I'm in love with the idea of Steve.  Having somebody I can have a conversation with without even speaking.  Somebody I can sit across a table from and just stare at and never blink or look away.  Somebody who knows what I'm thinking before I even think it.  Somebody who understands me and why I do the things I do.  Somebody who knows what I mean when I say "It's been that kind of a day".  But that person isn't him just because I loved him, that person was him because we took so much time and got to know each other.  We were extremely close and connected because we worked at it, because we loved each other.  It's not Steve who I miss, it's the type of relationship we had.  That's what I'm in love with.     The strangest part of the evening:  Shannon and I holding hands as we fought our way upstairs to the ladies room..yes I said holding hands.  I do it with all my friends and it just kind of happened...What the fuck?

      Grab a cup of coffee and make yourself comfortable cuz this is going to be a long one.  It's Monday after the weekend.  I have a story to tell.  The story will mean more to those of you who know me and to those of you who don't, you'll understand and may be able to relate.   Friday Night.  CPA and I headed down to "Riversplash" after we spent a few hours downing glasses of white zinfandel at a wedding reception.  With a healthy buzz and a smile on my face I drove us down to the kick off event of the Milwaukee festival season.  First, in walks Craig.  Craig is Teaser's boyfriend's friend and also happens to manage "Silk", a relatively new strip club in the area.  For some reason he always feels the need to give me free passes to his joint when he sees me.  He handed me a stack 2" high of passes that I shoved in my purse.  Then it was off to watch the Toys with CPA, Bowler and her Soon-To-Be-Kicked-To-The-Curb-Boyfriend.  I wandered off to meet up with Teaser and her entourage and eventually became separated from my peeps.  Wandering the streets of Riversplash alone I ran into My Old New Best Friend Tiffany and chatted with her for a bit about Greek who was recently discharged from the hospital.  I also ran into P's friends Benson and JimmyJ.  JimmyJ was a little too excited to see me and freaked me out when he insisted on having my phone number.  It seems as P really wasn't just being a typical man and not calling me, he didn't save my phone correctly and had asked JimmyJ to get a hold of Teaser to get it.  After making a semi-drunk phone call to P with JimmyJ, I headed off to the potty and back to find my clan who I lost in the end anyways.  My cell phone wasn't working very well so I was having a hard time calling anybody and all night when I'd check it, I'd suddenly have voice mails.  Eventually my Newly Single Not So Much A Brother got a hold of me and told me to head to Mel's, everyone was inside I was assured, and he'd be there in a half hour...my coaxing finally had convinced him to come down.  Alone and 3/4 drunk I headed into Mel's where I found NOBODY...except for Eric (an old friend of the Billmyer clan).  Chit chatted about life and headed outside to call Jeffy.    "We're in the middle of the intersection" he shouted at me.  "I'm standing dead center and I don't see you" I countered.  When all of a sudden somebody captured me in a bear hug.  It was Charlie...ugh..."We are destined to be together, can't you see!  We are at all the same places sugar" he explains.   "If we're destined to be together, shoot me now! And don't call me Sugar!" I replied with my sweet smile still in place.  Ooops I'm still on the phone..."Dude where are you guys?"  I see 'em and sprint across the concrete and jump into a hug with Big C.    Big C and I decide to go buy me a beer and leave Jeffy and SC waiting for us.  Arm and arm singing the Munchkin theme from Wizard Oz, Big C and I head over to the counter when suddenly I see Steve.  I think my heart dropped out of my chest and landed somewhere around my toes.  I pulled Big C along with me and went to say hi...skipped over by him really as he was walking to the Port o John's.  As I grabbed his arm he turned right into me and we landed in a hug and cheek kisses.  As we pulled away he gave me a once over and exlaimed "You look amazing!"  My reply "Thanks!  It's good to see you!  Come on Chad, let's go get a beer!"  Instead of continuing on his journey to the pisser he walked with us to get beer.  A short minute or two later this chick comes bounding over.  Standing all of about 5 feet tall and sporting short brown hair I knew immediately that this was my replacement.  I took a deep breath a long drink and turned around to greet my successor.  Steve didn't waste a moment "Shannon I'd like you to meet Lisa".  Her face dropped, but only for a second and she recovered with a nice smile.  I stuck out my hand and gave her the biggest most genuine "It's nice to finally meet you Shannon!"  with the biggest (maybe drunkest) smile I could muster.    That was only the beginning ...there's a whole other 2 1/2 hours to disect.  To be continued...

      Now I feel bad.  My roomie just called me and told me that Brian is seeing somebody else, he's been on three + dates with her and he's taking her to the Dells.  My recent experience with mostly the exact same situation, being replaced by somebody that quickly and knowing that he's doing the same things with that other person, I really feel bad for her.  Dude's dropping off all her stuff he had at his apartment while she's at work cuz he doesn't want to see her.  I mean seriously folks is this an epidemic with men?    I'm going to have t-shirts printed up for all the men that pull this:  "You're the one for me, but I'd like to see other people"   Okay Okay, I'll work on the slogan, help me out!

      I got home a little after 1am.  I went to the bathroom.  I laid in bed and talked to Kit Kat for 15 minutes on the phone.  I went back to the bathroom.  I left the light off, however luckily the street light outside reflected off the toilet because otherwise I would have fell in.  The seat was up.  My roommate, freshly broken up from her boyfriend-who's side of the bed is still warm, had a man in her room.  Okay ASSHOLE, if you are spending the night in some strange girls house where there are WOMEN living....put the effin' seat down after your middle of the night trip to the pisser.  Oh yea and it didn't make me feel any too comfortable to know that some stranger is wandering around the house in the middle of the night while I'M sleeping in the nude (I spose I could have put pj's on).  This morning his size 11's were parked outside her bedroom door.  How cute.

      Today  must just be my day.  The VP, who's accounts I am responsible for, has a tendency to give me monetary gifts from time to time.  For my birthday, for Administrative Assistant's Day, for Christmas, for just doing a good job and sometimes cuz he knows I'm going to a concert or special event.  I've come in to work many times to a card sitting on my chair or on my keyboard.  He takes care of letting me know I'm doing a good job.  I always take the money with a bit of guilt, but that quickly washes away with the thought of that 3 figure salary he makes and all the profit he sees from my hard work!  Today is one such day, excited for his little vacation he leaves on today, he was feeling especially generous.  That Hawaii fund is starting to stack up nicely!

      My jailbird buddy got out of jail yesterday.   For the last months and years of his sentence he repeatedly asked me if we could try again when he got out.  I can see it now... "Hi Dad, this is (no name as to not slander his reputation), he's an ex con, spent the last 7 1/2 years in jail, he's my new boyfriend."  "No, no dad! he won't make me the mother of his illegitimate bastard children and make me live in a trailer by the airport, really he won't!"  Hee hee, I am kind of excited to see him though.  Poor fella gettin' railroaded and all.  I should go back to work now.

      I'd like to add a bit to my post on lying.  I have had a few friends inquire on the gossip behind the lying bit and want to clarify.  I was lied to, by you, I didn't say anything when I found out the truth.  However you were standing only a person away from me when it was revealed and even joined in the conversation on the matter.  However because you have lied to me in the past about such a similar situation it probably didn't even dawn on you that I was finding out that you had lied, again.  I didn't say anything about it because I didn't feel like having it be brushed off as nothing like the last time, nor did I feel like having it be made a big deal.  You should just remember that I always have my eyes and ears open and pay attention to a lot more than you may think.  I also have a memory like an elephant and will remember what is told to me, even if it is in passing.  'Nuff said.

      Ah, these last four days have been absolute heaven.  Drama free days of having good times and good company.  The Memorial Day weekend went off with a bang.    Spending the night at a festival and then out to a few bars, I spent the evening in some sort of spotlight.  I haven't had that many men after me in one night since I was a stripper!  On 4 occasions I was asked to give up my digits.  It was a nice boost for my fragile ego.  Went out with the girls that were practically attached to my hip for 2 years...a great change of pace.    The Brewer's game on Saturday was an awesome showing and I have still yet to be at a game where they've lost.  I was exhausted from the night before so I made it an early night and enjoyed some me time on the couch.    Now if the heavens would have stopped pissing on us for a few hours I would have gone golfing on Sunday but alas, there was no hope.  Instead I spent the afternoon cleaning and doing my laundry before Super Freak, CPA, Bowler and I went to see Raising Helen.  Two thumbs up!  Super Freak and I hit the town ready to raise some hell and had an absolute blast.  Only slightly ruined by 3am conversations of the exes (they are brothers!).  However I made it home safely at 4:30am in time to hear the birds chirping outside my window. Just before I crashed into my cloud, I noticed that I had a text from none other than The Great Charlie...blech.   Monday was a more mundane affair, to a surprise birthday party for a girl I barely knew and bombarded with questions from a guy who didn't understand what it meant when a girl got up in the middle of a conversation to talk to somebody else.  He sat patiently waiting until I finally came back and I swear he didn't miss a beat.  Finished the sentence I had gotten up during!!!  Then it was off to pizza and wine with 2 obnoxiously happy couples and a singleton we'll call, Do-I-have-a-booger-in-my-nose-Don.  Here I sit on a Wednesday morning just counting the minutes until I can leave work and get back into my cloud.  Last night was an unexpected jaunt to the barskis where I had the pleasant experience of running into The Great Charlie.  It was there I realized that I don't care who's saying it, the greatest word you can throw at me as a compliment is  gorgeous . Ciao bella.

      Lie (noun)  1.  A false statement deliberately presented as being true; a falsehood.  2.  Something meant to deceive or give a wrong impression.    Why do people lie?  It's such an unattractive quality to have.  An ugly trait that I despise.  People tell lies all the time, white lies, half truths and bold out and out lies.   I tell white lies or half truths on occasion to spare someone's feelings, but I grew out of my days of bold face lying when I realized that there was no point to it because it just hurt other people.  I think it's a great sign of immaturity. The thing I hate the most is to be lied to by someone who CLAIMS to be my friend.    What's even worse than that is when you catch somebody in a lie and they tell ANOTHER lie to back up the other one.  Do you think I'm stupid, gullible or a pushover?  The dumbest of liars are those who tell a lie that is easily revealed with no effort, like when there are other people who are inadvertently involved in the lie and aren't aware.  It's amazing how quickly the deceit is revealed.    Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.    It's sad because the more somebody lies to me, the less and less I trust them and the more and more I step away from them.  I can't respect people who lie to me on a regular basis.  I can't even listen to what they are saying without wondering exactly what the truth is and wondering when exactly it's going to be revealed to me.  I give trust from day one, I hate taking it away and I will forgive many a time before I do, but when I do, it's gone.

      The last two days have been exhausting.&nbsp; So proud of myself on Wednesday as I was prodded and peer pressured to come out after my boyz played softball. I needed to get up at 5:30 on Thursday to meet the VP for our golf outing.&nbsp; Knowing my boyz all I could see was a night of drinking, drinking and more drinking.&nbsp; Having drank many 40's before their game and multiple cans in the stands and parking lot, I knew continuing the night with them would have proved to be a drunken haze.&nbsp;   Hitting a new low loss of 18 to 7, they had their asses handed to them on a platter, summed up by Wes's genius analogy  "The only thing cooler than that loss, is the cooler of beer!"    In the end I was a good girl and home in bed by 10:30, yay me!   I shot a 102 yesterday, not bad for the course we played.&nbsp; I drank Par Punch until the rains came and ate a dinner fit for a queen, including apple baked chicken and terriyaki beef with beans.&nbsp; Yum!&nbsp; Then my stuffed, drunken, sleepy self traveled home for a quick cat nap before volleyball.&nbsp;   Ending up having to play a double header, Funqi headed home ready to collapse around 10:45pm.&nbsp; We won all 6 games!!!!&nbsp; And laughed our fool heads off for much of the game, between our girl Blondie " I've gotta make sure the saline's back in place"&nbsp;  and Jeffy's failed attempt at a spike (much reminiscent of Nutter Butter's whiff last year) we still managed a 6-0 slaughter against the 19th Hole.   Yes yes, work piled to the ceiling and eyelids half closed, I've got lots to do so I can get out o here on time today.&nbsp; Okay concentration is now a must.

      This morning I was so very tired, for the first time I didn't care if my clothes matched.&nbsp; I also didn't care if I wore underwear, so I didn't.&nbsp; I came in to work and actually got complimented on my outfit.&nbsp; Maybe I should get dressed half asleep and hung over more often!   What is it in men that makes them feel as though they must fight when challenged?&nbsp; Alcohol involved or not?&nbsp; Last night I had an experience that I honestly do not recollect ever facing before.&nbsp;   I ran into an old "boyfriend" while I was out shooting some stick last night.&nbsp; We talked on and off throughout the night but given our history I had to make it very clear that I was seeing somebody and he needed to lay off.&nbsp; I mean I'm flattered hearing "You're incredibly gorgeous" and "You are so hot tonight" every 2 minutes, but c'mon buddy leave the wandering hands at home!&nbsp;   This was all well and good until the evening took a wrong turn.&nbsp; As I was fighting his hands that he couldn't seem to keep to himself, I laughed and told him to stop in a semi-stern tone.&nbsp; As I said this another gentlemen who'd been playing pool&nbsp;came out of the bathroom and told my old "boyfriend" to lay off of me in not so nice terms.&nbsp; Thank you very much sir but I can handle myself.&nbsp; Well one can only imagine where this went.&nbsp; I actually had to stand between them and yell at them both that it's not 'effin worth it and they should both knock it off.&nbsp; As soon as I stepped away my old "boyfriend" extended his hand to introduce himself and make peace with dude.&nbsp; Instead dude&nbsp;decided to be a total cock and push him as he shook his hand.&nbsp; Drinks went flying, sandals landed across the bar, and the two of them landed on the floor pummeling each other.&nbsp; This went on for atleast a minute before the bartender and others got involved and pulled them off of each other.&nbsp; Ay-yay yay....I just stood there shaking my head.&nbsp; Fucking machismo.

      Correction:&nbsp; It was not Big C who spilled the beer, it was Slightly Stupid.&nbsp; Get those brothers mixed up.   CPA has requested the Sluggo's phone story. So my good friend Bumpy works for a landscaping company and we saw a guy who had&nbsp;a Chremlawn T-shirt on.&nbsp; I inquired as to where/what Chremlawn was, her response: "Call the number!"&nbsp; now being buzzed and slightly bored at the moment, I dialed the number on the back of dude's t-shirt.&nbsp; To my own chagrin he raised his cell phone to his ear.&nbsp; After a few moments of confusion I hung up the phone after hearing the "hello".&nbsp; TO my horror moments later he called me back!!!&nbsp; Oh that was all I needed to be prompted to have a little fun.&nbsp; I called back and hung up as he raised his phone towards his ear.&nbsp; This was incredibly hilarious for some reason!&nbsp; Then one of the boys in our group decided it'd be funny to go and tell him it was me "No!" I cried as he&nbsp; moved in the dude's direction.&nbsp; THankfully he did not tell him and I was able to continue my fun.&nbsp; As my cell phone started ringing again I noticed this guy scanning the bar.&nbsp; I called him back and was able to leave him a voice mail "You shouldn't wear your cell phone number on your shirt!" and promptly hung up.&nbsp; I started to receive phone calls from him and his buddy's number and was very amused as I watched them scanning the bar for girls with cell phones.&nbsp; Hee hee hee...this was my entertainment watching these monkeys trying to locate the perp.&nbsp; At one point I left the building to talk on my cell and received 3 calls while there.&nbsp; As well as a call from CPA and Bumpy.&nbsp; Apparantely while I was away they started chatting up some of&nbsp; dude's buddies who were playing Golden Tee by our table...they told them that some girl in the bar was calling their friend and they were trying to figure out who it was.&nbsp; I finally threw him a bone as CPA and I exited the bar,I patted dude on the back and said "That was me by the way."&nbsp; Yes, yes it was funnier in the moment.&nbsp; Yes, yes it is a "had to be there" story.&nbsp; Yes, yes I am in 3rd grade!

      I sit at my desk barely able to function today.&nbsp; What is going on?&nbsp; I am so incredibly tired I feel like all life has been drained from me.&nbsp; Yesterday was spent rollerblading and lounging around Kit Kat's until I was ripped from sleep by "Big Pimpin" blaring from my cell phone.&nbsp; I headed home and watched "Heartbreakers" and then headed off to bed at 10pm.&nbsp; I read my book until I could hold my eyes open no longer.&nbsp; Was it the pain pill I took at 9 that has got me so groggy this morning?&nbsp; Who knows, but it sucks cuz my ass is not getting anything done.&nbsp; I have the attention span of a gnat at the moment and it doesn't look like it's getting much better.&nbsp; These are the days I wish I drank coffee, cuz at the moment I think I'd shoot myself straight up through the vein!   This weekend was filled with craziness and crappiness:  Found out Big C has a Big Crush on me.&nbsp; Drank for 12 hours Friday.&nbsp; Straight from work, do not pass go, I charged out of the gates throwing back beers at Sluggo's until 9:30.&nbsp; Genius idea next?&nbsp; Head to St. Terese with Slight Stupid, Jeffy, Big C and&nbsp;The Foreigner.&nbsp; Super Freak met us up there but she missed our scuff with the Po Po.&nbsp; Five adults ranging from 27 to 29 all pretended like we didn't know you couldn't carry in cans of beers to a church festival, oh yea, we had those cops convinced!&nbsp; Funqi was quite buzzed as she decided to smoke something other than her cigarette that night as well.&nbsp; Aye aye...after heading to the bar for a solid 3 hours, we returned to Jeffy's...after I, yes I drove.&nbsp; Slightly Stupid was slightly drunk (highly usual for the man who is never without a cooler of beer in his truck) and somehow I was elected to drive because I had waved at a cop car....wuahat?&nbsp; 2 plus hours later, grass stains on my knees - get your mind out of the gutter I was trying to tackle Big C in Jeffy's backyard and well if you've ever met Big C, he's B-I-G!     Quote of the Night: &nbsp;    "Gettin' wood, backing away" uttered more than once by GolfPro after attempting to dance with me.     &nbsp;    Highlight of the Evening:     Winning another Nutty Monkey from the stuffed animal claw!&nbsp; This one is fuzzy wuzzy and soft with a "sweater" that says Heart Golf...that's right, a heart and the word Golf, not I heart Golf, but heart Golf, this was so perfect and only took me 5 times.&nbsp; Unlike the Popeye I won for Bumpy that took me a quick fitty cents.     &nbsp;    Funniest Moment:     Chad spilling his beer right&nbsp;down the front of my shirt but not spilling a drop ON the shirt.&nbsp; A river runs through it as the cold liquid makes it's way down my chest and tummy soaking the top of my pants.&nbsp; Nice.      Crappiest Moment:    Walking in&nbsp;to the bar only to be greeted by Jill, SuperFreak's&nbsp;arch enemy.&nbsp; After giving me a grand hug and making a big production of seeing me, her friendliness quickly turned cold when she realized how good of friends SuperFreak and I are.&nbsp; Not to mention that all the guys were more concerned with us, then them.    &nbsp;  Saturday was not quite as eventful but so much fun nonetheless.&nbsp; La Fuentes left us feeling exposed and margarita relaxed.&nbsp; Relaxed enough to discuss our feet and pull them up to the table barefoot...I'm sorry I forgot I'm not a monkey and  do  know how to act in public.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there were the attacking birds!&nbsp; Ah, La Fuentes, wehre the margaritas go down like candy and the waiters look like candy.&nbsp; Mt.Olive rocked that evening and honest to God my ears are still ringing from standing next to that God Damn speaker!&nbsp;  You think I'd stop there?&nbsp; Nope, went and scooped up Freebird for a finish to the evening.&nbsp; Ended up at StepSis's pad for the bbq, a little late at midnight they were still up throwing them back (I know this surprises you ;))...cuddled up under a blanket by the bonfire and I learned things I hadn't know about my Free Bird.&nbsp;   Amidst the craziness of this weekend I managed to accomplish none of the things I had wished to.&nbsp; I'm lazy, oh well I've come to accept this I suppose.

      Here's a tip for all you knuckleheads out there like me:&nbsp; If you are at home for the evening and tired STAY HOME!&nbsp; I went out at 10pm last night, which normally wouldn't be that unusual however on a week night, this is not a good idea!&nbsp; I managed to close the bar last night and though I was not drunk, 5 beers and 2 shots was all I consumed, I am still extremely tired today and feel like I smoked a carton of cigarettes.&nbsp; We played umpteenmillion games of pool last night and folks I was on FIRE.&nbsp; I made bank shots that I didn't even think I could see let alone actually hit my pocket.&nbsp; On numerous occasions I found myself jumping up in the air as I watched the awesome shot I had just made.&nbsp; Winning was definitely in the cards for Funquita last night.&nbsp; This and all the male attention we received proved for a late night.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Won all 3 in volleyball last night!&nbsp; Yay us!&nbsp; Of course it helped that the team we played against seemed to be all the kids who got picked last in 7th grade gym =)&nbsp;&nbsp; I am very disappointed in my friends though.&nbsp; I called 11 women last night and could not find a single one who would come play with us...we played with 5 short a girl and still rocked.&nbsp; Kit Kat and I had some fun in the sand and Nutter Butter and Jeffy narrowly escaped a head on collision.&nbsp; All in all fun was had by all, I think.&nbsp;   Finished the poem, not sure if I'm going to post it or not.

      So I screwed up an order for a customer, I missed a due date and had to rush to get his forms printed.&nbsp; I actually drove them over to him myself and met with him briefly.&nbsp; Upon returning to work, I received the following email from him.&nbsp; I don't even know what to think of this other than the fact that this is so unprofessional and makes me feel dirty!    Thanks Lisa. FYI, If I get mad at you about something? Make a personal appearance. There's something about seeing you that melts away the frustration. Thanks again for your help with getting me the exercise tags. Gary

       urlLink    Wow, for once I don't have anything to bitch about.  For once I have no interesting stories to tell.  For once I don't have anything fun going on.  I spent last night camped out on my couch in and out of conciousness.  I was in bed by 10:30.  Monday was a similiar experience except I took a long walk down by the lake with CPA for some exercise.  Tonight my plans consist of not going to a softball game and not going to watch my friends play pool.  Which leaves me at home not cleaning my room and not doing anything useful.  I'm bored.  I should have said fuck work and went to Cali this weekend, but nooooooo responsibility won over my sense of irrationality.  Hmmph.  &nbsp; urlLink

Have any of you ever seen me squeal? I don't squeal. Atleast I never thought myself to be the squealing type. Although, before I am corrected I must admit that I squealed in the middle of the grocery store with CPA and took two hops in the air when Kit Kat called me and told me that the pictures she developed had the picture of him and I on it and I could pick them up.&nbsp; urlLink

      I'm very tired of hearing about babies and weddings.&nbsp; My boss here just became a grandma a couple weeks ago, and just found out that her daughter is pregos and due in December.&nbsp; Another woman here just became an aunt and the daddy is somebody who used to work here.&nbsp; One of our retired senior partners just let us know that he's going to be a grandpa in January.&nbsp; Somebody overheard our President talking on the phone and he said "we already know the sex" leading us to believe that his wife is with child.&nbsp; One of the gals around here is getting married in September and another is planning a wedding for next February.&nbsp; Another former coworker will be wed in April.&nbsp; If I have to listen to any more wedding and baby talk I swear I'll shoot myself.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I am boyfriendless and childless,&nbsp; according to everyone here as they look at me with sympathetic eyes and say "You're day will come".&nbsp; As if I'm waiting around for Prince Charming to walk in the door, sweep me off my feet and bear me the fruits of his loins so I may become the wife and mother I was meant to be.&nbsp; Are you kidding me?&nbsp; I'm not a spinster just because I"m almost 28 years old and still single.&nbsp; Did it ever occur to anybody that I may actually choose to be single and that I like the life I have?&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean seriously, I am happy with my life.&nbsp; Yes I may get lonely from time to time but I'm perfectly happy and SANE to be alone.&nbsp; I do not measure my worth by who's waiting for me at home, so what if it's a roommate and two cats and not a husband and children.&nbsp; When I'm damn good and ready  I &nbsp;will walk into  his  life and if  he's  lucky, bear him the fruit of  my  loins!&nbsp; (And no I'm not some kind of feminist, I would just like to make the point that I'm not waiting around for anybody!)

      Begin Rant  &nbsp;  After having her new Dick (aka DorkBoy or DancingQueen) stay the entire weekend, I'm very annoyed with the boy.&nbsp; He's such a dork and I don't mean a good dork, he's the kind of dork that in high school, even I would have picked on.&nbsp; He's annoying, not obnoxious like I am, just annoying.&nbsp; He has already made himself at home and decided that it was okay to walk around the house in his towel after he took a shower while&nbsp;Roomy slept.&nbsp; Hey Dick Wad, put some fucking pants on, it's just not appropriate nor comfortable for me to have to&nbsp;be subjected to that.&nbsp;&nbsp;He also felt comfortable enough to fuck around in the &nbsp;kitchen cutting up fruit and making a fruit salad for the picnic they were going to the next day while she was still napping, do you have a home?&nbsp; Oh my God, he's been around for a week and a half and he's ready made himself quite at home.&nbsp; I think I saw an extra toothbrush in the bathroom this morning?&nbsp; Then I awake to a note on the kitchen table...yadda yadda yadda, I'll be home around 6.&nbsp; Eric's coming over for dinner...um hello doesn't he have a home you two could go to?&nbsp; Jesus, was that a hint to leave or just a warning that he'll be there.&nbsp; $100 says he will stay the night AGAIN.&nbsp; Every time they have seen each other he has spent the night.&nbsp; Maybe I should invite Freebird over for movies and dinner.&nbsp; I get home at 5.&nbsp; We can have the whole house taken over by the time they get there.&nbsp; Nope, instead I'll probably make myself scarce cuz they annoy me.&nbsp; Argh.&nbsp; Shoulda moved out when I had planned to.&nbsp; &nbsp;  End Rant

      The Top 5 Reasons Port Washington Sucks:  5.&nbsp; I don't know my way around.  4.&nbsp; My cell phone doesn't work there.  3.&nbsp; Their festival closes at 10pm.  2.&nbsp; TRAFFIC leaving their festival was like the Brooklyn Bridge at rush hour.  1.&nbsp; Did I mention I don't know my way around?  &nbsp;  Fish Days was rocking Saturday evening when we arrived at a useless hour of 9pm.&nbsp; Thinking we'd have a couple hours to enjoy some music and beers, little did we know that this festival of fish closed down after the 9:30 fireworks.&nbsp; The party was rockin' when we got there.&nbsp; Set at the marina, they had what I counted as 4 music stages and tons of people milling around.&nbsp; Had I not been on a mission to find Freebird, we may stopped to enjoy some of the festivities.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fireworks were mediocre at best but this is definitely an event I will surely check out next year.  &nbsp;  Following this road trip gone from a 1 hour total drive to an hour and&nbsp;a half because of the Where's Waldo directions I received, we went to Boz's for Jay's birthday event.&nbsp; Holy shit was that place packed and packed with people I knew from past and present.&nbsp; Walking in to that place was somewhat of a time warp.&nbsp; First I talked with a girl who was part of my life 3 years ago and&nbsp;we spent 20 minutes trying to figure&nbsp;out just HOW we knew each&nbsp;other...&nbsp; Psycho Angie.&nbsp; Then a bit later I ran into another flash from my past.&nbsp; I hadn't seen this one in easily 7 years.&nbsp; Still as ditzy as ever I was still excited to see her.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  And of course I got to see Freebirds yummy brother.&nbsp; This was the first time I'd seen him since Freebird and I figured out that I knew him.&nbsp;&nbsp; This world is just too small.&nbsp; How was I supposed to know that his brother hung out at MY Boz's.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean jeez the last time I had seen him before that was at Freebird's apartment for his bro's  18th birthday!&nbsp;  How was I supposed to know he was so hot and that when I met him I'd be wiping drool of my chin and trying not to jump on top of him?&nbsp; He's dumber than a box of rocks but those um...eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp; He kept telling people the story about how when we met months ago he thought I was hot and we talked and I gave him his number and that it's funny that I'm his brother's ex and have written to him for the last 8 years. &nbsp; I was flattered in an odd sort of way that he was telling people (people who knew me) this story.&nbsp; Crazy how Will and Poppy and Dena all know Freebird.&nbsp; Saturday was just an odd night.&nbsp; I swear there had to be a full moon.&nbsp; I didn't get home until 4:30 in the morning...when's the last time I did that?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Friday night was a lot of fun too, Mt. Olive rocked as usual at the fest down the road from home.&nbsp; CPA, Kit Kat, Teaser, Roomy, DorkBoy, WhiteTrash and Dancer and I all walked the 6 blocks and set up for a fun evening.&nbsp; Afterwards I found myself on my way to Maverick's with Dancer to meet some of her work buddies.&nbsp; Mavericks?&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Walking in to that place was like walking in to my past again.&nbsp; Having spent many a drunken Thursday stumbling around that bar.&nbsp; Playing darts so drunk I can't see the board, chasing beers with shots and vice versa, hanging out in power outages, yanking people's pants down, letting the bartender take pictures of me flashing the bar - oh wait after having somebody (not mentioning any names here) pulling my shirt up for me so he could take the picture, being pushed around the pool table after being doused with a glass of beer thrown at someone else, pulling my cuz out of the men's bathroom so we can leave, breaking up fights between her and whatever girl she pissed off, devouring tacos that tasted like heaven after 3 pitchers of beer ....memories.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not quite so much excitement this time around but I was amazed to walk in and have Todd remember who I was.&nbsp; "Hey Lisa!&nbsp; Nice to have you back honey!" was the greeting I received.&nbsp; I did a double take as I found it hard to believe he remembered my name.  &nbsp;  Having had a weekend where my past was pretty much my present I've been reflecting on how many years have gone by that I've forgotten.&nbsp; People that have been cut or fallen out of my life.&nbsp; People who's lives have touched mine and I've touched theirs.&nbsp; You don't realize what kind of an impact you have on people or vice versa until they have been gone and resurface into your life.&nbsp;&nbsp; So many experiences I've had and places I've been.&nbsp; Highs and lows.&nbsp; Good times and bad times.&nbsp; I can't ever imagine living a different life.&nbsp; I've loved a lot of people along the way and am finding out that I've been loved more than I could have imagined.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      So I'm standing in front of the fax machine waiting for my 16,000 page order to go through.  I look up at the picture that hangs on the wall behind the fax machine.  It's one of those cheesy inspirational pictures that has a picture of an Eagle with the title "Dare to Soar" and a caption underneath that says "You're Attitude Almost Always Determines Your Altitude in Life".  I don't know what kind of drugs somebody slipped in to my lunch but I put my arms out in the air and started to sway the top half of my body while making the airplane noise.  Now this is something I think I've seen 4 year olds do in the back yard and then they pretend they've been shot down and crash to the grass.   I'm in my own world here kids.  When I realize suddenly where I am and that there are eyes on me.  I turn around slowly with my arms still raised only to find the President of the company trying to stifle the smile on his face-very unsuccessfully.  He busts out laughing and tells me to keep up the good work.  Can my face get any redder????  I AM SO SOFA KING WE TODD IT.  (Say it outloud kids)

      people are weird.  i'm weird.  i came home all buzzed up last night to my roommate and her flavor of the week.  i was acting like an idiot.  talking silly and wandering around the house entertaining them.  i'm a fun drunk.  when people aren't trying to kick me out of bars that is! i was telling the flavor about all the guys i'm talking to and that if i could just melt them all together i'd have a decent boyfriend.  he probably thinks i'm a ho.  i told them i was going off to bed to knock one off.  thanks kids, i'm here all week.  i beat rat at pool last night.  i found out just how good Hector's margaritas really are.  i wore a magnolia (?) in my hair courtesy of CPA.  i talked to freebird on numerous occasions and don't remember what i said.  he probably thinks i'm weird.  i have a headache. this weekend is gonna be fun.     Newsflash:  Drinking alcohol promotes feelings of grandeur.

      I've got the opportunity to go to San Diego for a long weekend in 2 weeks.  To go or not to go.  Shall I suffer more damage to my credit card and pretend that money really  does  grow on trees?   I was so proud of myself for not putting a single dime on my credit card when I went to the islands I would hate to ruin that by charging up a storm at the end of the month.    But what fun I would have.  I've never been to Cali and I'd love to be spontaneous and take a quick weekend getaway, especially since I feel as though I already need another vacation.  Hmmm.

      Okay I'm here to finish my never ending Hawaii saga.   The trip couldn't have ended more perfectly.  At the Red Lion we had much fun.  Between Kit Kat leaving her purse...yes her effin purse in the bathroom, psycho boys who claim possession after hanging out for a bit, booty boys dry humping us on the dance floor and being harassed every two steps about how how we were, a tired Funquita had had enough around 1am.  We were getting geared up to go when some pud started hitting on me as Kit Kat finished up a convo with Cameron (a boy we met earlier in the week).  Ugh, I ran to the shelter of Navy Davy and company who happened to be standing nearby.    Three hours later Navy Davy and I realized we just spent the rest of our bar time locked in conversation.  Next logical step was to strip down to our undies and jump in the ocean...I had wanted to go night swimming all week and here was the perfect opportunity with a cute boy to boot.    Bar close, 4 am, Navy Davy headed off in what we thought was the direction of the beach...uh yea turn around kids...we cruised past Kit Kat and Crackalakin (forgive my murder of his nickname)who decided to join us.    What a perfect way to end my vacation.  Under a full moon we swam out and swam out but couldn't seem to avoid the reef.  It's okay, in his arms I would have suffered a stingray attack and not even noticed.  After bouncing around for a bit we decided to head in to the beach...the cops thought that was a good idea too as they made there way down the beach towards us.  We all scrambled into our clothing and headed in the direction of civilization.  Walking hand in hand back to the hotel, my skirt was soaked and I was now wearing a shirt capable of winning me a wet t-shirt contest anywhere in the country.  More beers at the hotel caused us all to pass out in exhaustion.  But not after we watched George Bush address the nation at 5:30 am...something I couldn't' seem to comprehend (duh time difference ace).    Mmmm, the night was perfect except for the fact that we had to leave the next day.  Hawaii where are you?  You are now a faded memory and a picture taped to my computer monitor =(

      Going to sleep freshly showered in a bed that has just been made. Lazy Sunday afternoons, mostly spent puttering around the house. Cooking a sit down meal using the oven and real plates =) The smell of freshly cut grass and charcoal grills. A cool breeze coming in the window and hitting my bare legs as I lounge in bed reading a book at night. Watching a thunderstorm from the porch and listening to all the sounds it brings. Walking along the lake after sunset and watching the waves. Washing my car on a hot summer day (what are those) while the dog runs around chasing the hose (I miss my Heidi ='( )  Summer where are you?

      I don't think there is another place in the world where I have been treated so rudely.  I was "yelled" at 4 times while at this establishment for 2 1/2 hours.    1.  Lighting my cigarette in a non-smoking area.  (They do not allow smoking in restaurants, however since we were in the bar and I had not had this problem before I was unaware that they had a separate area for smokers in the bar-one would think that since I was sitting at the bar I was okay).  2.  My seat was in "the walkway", although my bar stool (that I had been sitting on all night including when I got yelled at for the cigarette) was one barstool away from the bar and part of the circle we had all formed.  3.  Standing on the landing on the stairs (after the rude bouncer man said "stand in line like everyone else" after Ruby asked if he'd let us back in if we went outside for some air-so she could make a phone call).   4.  Ordering a drink when I was standing behind a bar stool and not sitting on it...okay this one makes no effin sense.  My friends were all sitting on this corner of the bar all night and where I was standing I was leaning OVER an EMPTY bar stool.  The bartender and his high falootin' attitude pissed me off so I swung my leg over the chair, skirt and all and stood on the footrest of the stool as I very curtly ordered a Miller Lite.  Fucker brought me a Bud Lite with a twinkle of defiance in his eyes.  I proceeded to crumple up the twenty dollar bill into a ball and take a nice big swig of this nasty Bud Lite.  I placed it back on the bar and tossed the crinkled twenty dollar bill on the bar and said "I ordered a Miller Lite"..."No you did not, you ordered a Bud Lite"....my response..."I have never drank Bud Lite in my entire life why would I order one now?"  He shook his fat little head and went back to get me a Miller.  Brought me the beer and proceeded to argue with me and some guy Kit Kat was chatting up.  Her newfound friend defended me saying me and my friends had been sitting on this corner all night etc etc.  After bitching at me about how rude I AM!!!!   (Okay I was being a bit beligerrent here but seriously this guy was being so rude and condescending to me I just got pissed, I asked him why he was being so rude to me and told him that I was just trying to have fun and every time I turn around someone is yelling at me)   he turns his back and I give him the big "Hang Loose Mutha Fucker!".  At this point we still hadn't seen the change for the twenty.  But I see the bartender call the bouncer over and I yell to him I want my money back and I'll leave.  He gives us the money and I quickly turn to my buds and tell them I'm getting kicked out.    The asshole bouncer who'd been yelling at me all night comes up and give me the shoulder.  I promptly turn to him and tell him in the sweetest tone I can "I'm leaving, I don't' want to stay here any more than you want me here, I've never been treated so rudely in my entire life.  I'm trying to have fun with my friends and you guys make it very difficult.  Give me two seconds to say good bye to my friends"  he shoulders me again and I promptly turn to him and spew in his face "Don't fucking touch me!"  I notice that at this time, there are 5, yes I said 5 bouncers around me.  I'm a good 5 inches shorter than most of them, have a skirt and heels on and they have to have 5 bouncers around me?   Ruby's confused and keeps asking me why I'm being kicked out..."Cuz they're assholes" was my reply to which the bouncer starts to move toward me again..ugh...jeez I'm leaving already.  Outside I just about have a freak attack and my hands are shaking as I'm trying to light my cigarette.  Moments later we are joined by our Aussie stalker, the girls and a new member-some dude from Ohio that had a thing for Ruby.  Kit Kat starts chatting up some Navy dudes while I'm just fuming and bitching to the air basically.  We talked the Navy dudes along with some passerbyers not to go into this establishment and the Navy dudes escort us to the Red Lion where they had been earlier.  Get Funqi out of here and get her a drink before she explodes!!!  As it turns out this was a good thing getting kicked out because on this sidewalk during my tirade was where I met Navy Davy, one of our escorts to the Red Lion.  To be continued kiddies...I know you're on the edge of your seat but I gotz work to do!

      Sleep was a good thing.  Waking up refreshed at a leisurely hour of 9am, we hit the buffet breakfast and got ready for a day of swimming, snorkeling and laid back adventure on our rented mopeds.  We hit the moped rental stand where we proceeded to fill out our paperwork and prepare for our journey.  As we stood on the sidewalk watching the nicest man in Hawaii inspect our bikes I was approached by Elias...I made him spell his name as his thick Iraqi accent muddled his words.  After his quick introduction he threw it out there like a bomb(ok bad analogy) "Let's go party tonight girls, come on we'll go together".  Wow, that was quick, 2 minutes of foreplay and he wants to dive right in.  What the hell, call us we agree or not so much agree but sometimes I even have a hard time being mean (imagine that).    Off on the peds.  Lovin' it!  We decide to hit up the Aquarium before hitting Hunauma Bay and gear up to go in.  "Shit shit shit" stomps Kit Kat after closing her seat storage compartment. "what happened?" I frantically check her appendages to see if she lost a finger or something as I notice she looks like she's about to cry.  Well my friend Kit Kat locked her moped key...IN THE MOPED.  Off to my adventure to get a second key...  Now this should have been a 25 minute journey at best.  Because Waikiki has so many one way streets one must maneuver themselves around and make sure they stay on the correct path.  For some reason this was easier to do in a Jeep rather than on a moped because shortly after my final left turn I found myself in Honolulu by Magic Island...whaaa?  I remember seeing that on the map...nowhere near where I wanted to be!  After some deliberation and more left turns I found myself back on familiar territory.  I'm hoping Kit Kat hasn't put an APB out on me by now and I manage to get back to her after an hour of cruising around.    Fun fun, Aquarium was cool, saw things I've never seen.  Snorkeling wasn't quite as much fun as the first time through.  I did however have an underwater camera this time around and got some nice shots.  My mask however, did not want to cooperate and was continuously filling up with water and steaming up.  I kept bumping into people because it was busier than hell, the tide was high and waves were as well making it hard to negotiating the jagged reef...not to mention the fact that after a half hour of snorkeling I lost my "snorkeling buddy" =(  After a couple hours I returned to land only to find Kit Kat lying in the sun talking to some old dude.  What's with the old dude's around here??  That's  it, we've had enough.  Back on the peds for some more motoring.  Did I tell you how much I loved these mopeds?  I want to get a motorcycle now.  I raced a Harley on the way in to town, beat him off the line but ate his tailpipe when he was done amusing me.  Went to find the parasailing to no avail but had a nice walk around the park.  Cruised the city a few times and ran with some biker gangs (okay they were on mopeds too)...Honk if you're pedding.  After losing Kit Kat on the road for 15 we decided to call it an afternoon and head up to the room.  We had dinner to eat and partying to do.    After a quick call to the girls and listening to our messages from Elias and co. We headed to the "Italian Tomato" where we met the cheesiest lounge singer and a waitress who didn't' know what country "Wisscanson".  Good pizza though, but the gigantic bug I noticed on the way out the door didn't make me feel any too good.  Off to Moose's McGillicuddy's for what we are sure will be a bang up night with our Cali friends.  Ha ha...so we thought!   That's a story I will have to save for tomorrow.  Current Events:   Teaser's birthday was fun but not too much fun.  The cold weather didn't help to bring us into the party mood.  Not to mention the fact that I seemed to run into every person I wanted nothing to do with!   Saturday was a lovely day.  After barbecuing with Vince, I headed home to meet Dave for him to look at my truck.  HE took me for a ride on his crotchrocket and told me that I should let him take me out sometime...he still harbors feelings for me from dating me 9 years ago!  Argh.  Off to the Brewer's game w/CPA which was a blast, it was a sold out game where we had to buy Standing Room only tickets...Fortunately somewhere around the 5th inning a nice young man offered us his tickets as they were moved to the handicap section.  Then it was off to the Lincoln Pub to meet up with my peeps, we played lots of pool and  sang a little karaoke and got home before bar close.  All in all a good day.  Sunday was spent cooking and puttering around the house.  Got lots cleaned and taken care of.  No ice cream with BriBri...that was easy!  I'm super relaxed today and ready to take on the week =)

      "Is your boyfriend here?"  Asked the man with the straggly hair, trucker's cap, missing teeth and red flannel shirt with the ripped pocket.  "No" I replied as leaning backwards to avoid his breath.  I quickly added "But I wish he was"  "Hey well, no harm I just wanted to tell you that you are absolutely gorgeous" he replies to this as he sticks out his grease stained hand that is holding a crumpled up $5 bill. "Go buy yourself a drink"  I laughed as I instinctively took the money from his hand but quickly realized that I couldn't take this guy's money "No no, I can't take this" I shook my head as I tried to hand him back the money.  "Just buy yourself a drink, you deserve it" he replied as he walked away.  I threw the $5 on the counter and stifled my laughter until he was out of sight.  The guys we were shooting pool with joined me in laughter as I stuck the $5 in my cleavage and told them I'd be taking up a collection!   Unbelievable!

      Spent the night at Boz's hanging out with Freebird and other various members of the Boz's gang.  Am I ever going to feel normal around him?  I caught myself toning down the party girl inside of me whenever I saw him looking at me.  That's odd, I've only ever done that with one other guy...okay  maybe more than one...but nonetheless I don't usually do that unless somebody makes me nervous.  And most men don't make me nervous unless I've got some sort of feelings for them.  Uh-oh.  Is it the bad girl in me looking for the bad boy in him?  Is it the last 8 years of letters exchanged?  Is it the fact that I swear to God when we hung up the phone last night I heard him say "I love you" in a mumbled tone?!?! - God I wish I hadn't been half asleep when we talked.    I seem to be overrun with boys these days.  I have gotten 4 text messages from 3 different dudes and 2 phone calls since I got to work this morning.  Vince wants me to go to a wedding with him next Saturday (say what???  we haven't even had a "real" date yet).  Todd is vieing for my attention this weekend but I'm keeping him at arms distance, why? I'm not sure.  Nice guy, bought me a Ferrari hat after he got back from Indy a couple weekends ago after only knowing me for a week =)  I like those gestures-sweet.  Then I'm supposed to have dinner or something with Brian tomorrow.  My gf's want me to bring a man out tonight, "pick one and bring him" they say...and all I'm thinking is "hell no then I can't pick up any guys!"  Sad.  Is this the definition of a player?  I never thought of myself like that but man the title seems to fit.  I always have 2 or 3 guys I'm "working on"...I need to narrow my scope cuz I'd really like to have some sexercise soon.   I'm not a player, I'm just a girl who's having fun being single!

       Wednesday:   Destination: Pearl Harbor Departure Time: 6:45 AM Travel Method: Shuttle Bus  Whaaaaaaaat?  We crashed into bed (together?) somewhere around 2:30 but didn't giggle ourselves to sleep until somewhere between then and 3:30.  As Kit Kat muddled around the room getting ready, I rolled over again and again moaning..."mmna nu go" was my response when asked if I was going to get up.  It's 6 am for christ sake, who gets up that early?  Yea bullshit, that was one of the things I absolutely had to do while in Hawaii so of course I stepped up to the plate and got up.  Half asleep I slapped on some clothes and ran a brush through my smoke laden hair.  Mmm, picture perfect.  Off we go...through the IMP to Outriggers Waikiki to meet our peeps and our shuttle.  I attempted something they call sleep on the shuttle but to no avail.  So tired.    Pearl Harbor was an emotional and moving experience.  I took a stroll through the "museum" to see pictures of soldiers and artifacts that were recovered.  Letters to family and lovers, uniforms that were charred on the edges and decorated with medals.  Then before they ferry you off to the memorial they show you an emotionally charged 25 minute film of real footage.  Standing in awe of where I really was I took pictures of all the surrounding ships, the memorial itself and the sunken ship beneath us.  If you ever get to Hawaii you must see Pearl Harbor.  On a less serious note we decided to take surfing lessons this fine day, squeezed in between Pearl Harbor and the luau that was scheduled that night.  Tired and worn from the day Kit Kat and I trekked back to the hotel and then back to the Outrigger once again for our lessons that would surely turn us into the next blue crushes.  Burt alas, sista who's 9-12 years our junior was "too tired" for the surf.  Oh well, we laid out on our ABC floaty things in the middle of the ocean instead.  Peaceful and relaxing.   Mmm take me there now.  St. Germaine's Luau is a story in itself.  Where to start, where to end?  Cousin Spencer.  Our tour guide.  What can I say, he had us laughing from start to finish.  He taught me that poi tastes like preparation H.  He taught me to dip my pee pee in the poi and make it a poo poo.  He taught me the words to my new theme song: Just hang loose, Just have fun Sippin on a drink, Lyin' in the sun Don't try to fight it, there ain't no use. Cuz when you're in Hawaii you should just HANG LOOSE! After getting leid and getting some pics by the oceanic view we headed in to the party where we were greeted by a less than friendly hag who showed us to a table.  Sitting on the ground in the sand we got the real feel for Hawaiian tradition.  A couple of Blue Hawaiians and a Pina Colada later we ate good food, tried some poi and traditional Hawaiian dishes and sat back to enjoy the show.  Got up on stage and shook what our mamas gave us doing the hula.  Fun fun!  Met our pals Ruby and Sam from Sacramento.  Total sweethearts despite their deceiving look.  We shared cigarettes and laughs out by the shoreline and decided we had to all go out before our time was up.    An exhausted Kit Kat and Funquita debated for quite a while as to whether we wanted to waste our night sleeping or meet the girls for drinks after the luau.  The choice was inevitable.  Once back in the hotel and lying on the bed we knew what we must do!  (Party would be the logical choice here, but we opted for sleep!).    Current Affairs:  Today is Teaser's birthday celebration, we'll start with the traditional Bastille Days and go on from there.  Ooooh ooh, that reminds me...I've got another Best of:   Best Convo of the Trip:   Driving in the Jeep Kit Kat turns to me and says "I didn't bring a hair band!!"   Slick and all, my reply "I brought Aerosmith" Kit Kat looks at me quizzically for a moment until I bust out laughing. Okay it WAS funny...yea the better response would have been Warrant or Guns n' Roses or Extreme or Poison or Nelson or Skid Row or any number of bands that are better known for being a hair band but come on...it WAS funny!

       I've come to the conclusion that I suck.  And I'm not talking about the kind of sucking that involves swallowing afterwards.     My desk looks like a war zone over here and I can barely keep up with the stuff going on, but yet I spend 25 minutes writing on here and then come back for more.  Also for some reason my personal email use has seemed to triple since I've been back.    I've got 3 job "offers" on the table right now.  One that's been in the horizon for a couple months but is approaching decision time.  One that I will learn more about on Tuesday, but from what I know the pay is great and the  people are even better (sha-right).  The third is an opportunity that would take me to California but I know I'm too much of a chicken shit to follow up.    I suck cuz I'll probably stay here cuz I'm settled.  I have tired of my job here however I am too chicken shit to do anything about it.  I suck cuz I talk of getting out of here but never do.  I suck cuz I don't know how NOT to spend money.  I suck cuz I have the attention span of a gnat.  I suck cuz I am the queen of procrastination.  I suck cuz I am not motivated.  But mostly I suck cuz I am in love with the unattainable.

       Tuesday:  Somewhere along the lines I got confused and I am lying to my readers.  We did not go to the Dawg House on Monday night, Monday we stayed in and didn't do a whole lot, I think we went right to bed???    We awoke Tuesday around 7am and drove ourselves and Kit Kat's sista and mama to Pearl Harbor. After a quick trip to the Military DMV (don't ask) we found ourselves at the Arizona Memorial.  After a half hour wait and our tickets for our ferry reading 11:30 am, we headed back for the Jeep having wasted an entire morning on this affair.  We didn't have time to stick around and actually see the memorial.  Unfortunately sista had to be back to get ready for her senior pictures and Kit Kat and I had a date with Friendly Fat Bastard to return the Jeep.  After we returned the Jeep, which is a story in itself as Chinagirl found a couple little dents in the passenger door that apparently were not there the day before.  As we waited for Friendly Fat Bastard to return and check out the "damage" we were freaking out a little bit wondering what kind of  damage  this would cause our credit cards.  We spent the next 15 or 20 getting hit on by some married Naval men.  Damn sailors are everywhere!  After Friendly Fat Bastard arrived, he did his checks and shook my hand with a "You're all set, hope you had fun"...what no $15 billion repair bill??  So moving on, after we returned the Jeep Kit Kat and I split up for the first time in 4 days, she went with the fam and I hit the beach for some afternoon rays, which turned me into a boiled lobster.    After we hooked up again we decided to head to the Cheesecake Factory for an early dinner.  I had the bestest chicken salad sandwich ever and accompanied it with a divine drink named the "Flying Gorilla".  I ordered it mostly for it's name but a concoction of banana liqueur and chocolate corocoa with other tasties thrown in, this drink quickly became a close rival to the "Nutty Monkey" I consumed to earn my nickname.   Yummy!    Bellies full and left overs in hand we went on with some souvenir shopping and headed to the hotel to get ready for a night of drinky drink and naval men.  On our way out we were hit up by Hawaiian Ryan the local disc jockey and given fair warnings on where to go and where to avoid...we were also given a  piece of golden advice "Watch out girls, there are 40,000 horny sailors looking to get laid tonight!"  Our answer to that:   CLEAR SHOES!! CLEAR SHOES!!   The rest of the evening...well just reread the end of Monday's post...the Dawg House was our starting point and ended up being our final destination as well.

      Monday: Decided to rent a Jeep, a big yellow Jeep to take to Diamond Head and Hunauma Bay.  Friendly Fat Bastard tells us of how all his belongings were stolen from the airport locker 22 years ago when he came for vacation and he never went back to "the mainland".  Tells us stories of his psycho ex girlfriend who he still checks up on in the states from time to time.  From San Fran, imagine that!   After 45 minutes of instruction from Friendly Fat Bastard we're off.  Map in hand and swimsuits safely stowed, we take off to Diamond Head for a 1 1/2 to 2 hour hike sans water nor sanity.  After an hour we're ready to die and debate the trek down..."Are we going to be mad at ourselves if we don't go to the top?"  I inquire to a matchingly exhausted Kit Kat who looks like she's ready to faint "Yea, probably".  I turn for a second..."Let's go" I call as I head farther up the path.  We come to a 75 step stairwell and barrel our way up..after a tunnel and a short break there is another 99 step stairwell that I swear to God is at a 90 degree angle.  But I tell ya folks, after the next spiral staircase and short jaunt after that, the breathtaking view was well worth it.  Now we must go back down...WHAT???  Where's the helicopter or the hidden elevator to relieve us of this burden?    Off to Hunauma Bay where I fell in love with snorkeling..."Don't feed me, I've got plenty...don't step on me, I'm ALIVE!" sang the reef from the instructional video.  Funny shit.  I swam with eels and sea turtles as big as a small child.  It was AWESOME.  Kit Kat and I pulled a "Sweetest Thing" and changed in the parking lot where anyone looking could have gotten a good show.  At one point I had the urge to tear off the towel and run around naked, I think the tropical scene does that to you.  Then it was off to Honolulu to catch some dinner...steak and lobster that melted in my mouth...that is of course after I sent it back to have them finish cooking my snapping lobster.   We took a walk up the fishing pier only until I got freaked at the 15 men hovering around...we were NOT wearing clear shoes but I had an eerie feeling these guys didn't care!    So it was back to Waikiki to cruise around while we still had the Jeep.  After about 15 trips around cuz Waikiki is a city of One Ways we headed in to freshen up for a night out.  Found ourselves at The Dawg House.  It was a night of constant barrage from the 40,000 Navy Men who had arrived in town earlier that day for "Impact".  Navy Joe became my object of interest for the next couple of hours as Kit Kat occupied herself with one of the natives.  All in all it was a fun night and our drunk asses managed to find our way back to the hotel to crash.  Side Note:  I just got an email from Troy Boy.  Now where's Navy Davy?  To be continued...

       Best Souvenir Bought:  Nutty Monkey Hula Girl Bobble Head with sticky bottom for application on my 'ruck dashboard!   Best Moment While Getting Ready for the Bar:  MTV Commercial..."My friends all know that I'm an 'effin crazy driver, they're always telling me, "Katie you need to slow the 'eff down", and I'm like, I'm a busy 'effin girl..."  Kit Kat and I stop in our tracks my hand still in the air with the mascara brush up to my eye and her with her shirt half on/half off.  We look at each other in disbelief and bust out laughing when this Chevy commercial is over.   Best Jet Lag Statement:  Kit Kat "Oooh I love that brown bag" Funqui, stifling a laugh "Which one?" Said as we walked past a shop window that had 6 handbags of assorted sizes on display...All of which were BROWN.

       Sunday:   Deciding that we are the whitest howlies in Hawaii, Kit Kat and I decide to hit the beach before blinding the locals.  We somehow manage to cut through the International Market Place, (Hawaii's answer to Rummage O' Rama, by replacing crap merchandise with shiny crap merchandise and pushy Asians who will eventually give you your prize for the price of a cheap souvenir if you hold out long enough), to make it to the beach.    15 SPF suntan lotion in hand we lather up and plop ourselves onto the beach.  After a few trips into the clear blue waters of Hawaii, we head to the IMP for some souvenir shopping and to pick up some post cards.    Now we're ready to party and are ignoring the looming jet lag that has claimed us.  So after beautifying ourselves back at the hotel we head off to find a shit bar to waste some time at before din din we planned to have at the Cheesecake Factory.    We find a no name bar where Steve threw our drinks together, Hawaiian Ice Teas - named for their cousin Long Island Teas - they did their job and had me looped up after 2.  While ordering my 3rd I was summoned by Troy Boy sitting at the far end of the bar.  At first I declined but by the end of my 3rd drink I strutted over to him to see what he had wanted.  Standing at 6 foot forever, or 6 foot 7 as he claimed, he towered over me as he took my hand in a honi honi.  I sat and chatted with him for another drink and a half as Kit Kat beat up some Aussie's at the pool table.  We then bid them all ado and headed off in the direction of a steak house Troy Boy had recommended.  But instead we ended up back at the Tiki Bar for dinner and another fat Hawaiian playing his uke.  Tired and worn from the day we decided to call it a night and cancel our wild party plans....little did we know.  As we cut through the IMP  again , we walked past Troy Boy and were summoned inside.  Never letting me more than a foot away from him Troy Boy expressed his disappointment that we hadn't gone to the steak house for he had called the owner to get our meal comped...did I mention Troy Boy was a local and had quite a bit of money?  We sucked down another drink and a couple of shots and went "home" to pass out from exhaustion...after a couple more beers bought by the boys.  Argh.    To be continued...

      One day at a time.  I'm going to go through my trip a day at a time as to not overwhelm my readers and to not occupy too much space at once!  Saturday:  Kit Kat gets dropped at my house 9 am.  I cook us a quick breakfast of scrambled eggs and yummy french toast.  We take a few before pictures with our bags and await the arrival of mama to take us to the airport.  Can I tell you how excited we were?  I had a bit of a headache from Summerfest the night before but we were in good shape.  9 1/2 hour later we could barely contain our excitement (and crabbiness from the long flight) at the airport and took manic pictures as we breathed in the sweet smell of our leis and the ocean air.  Ahhh, I've reached paradise.  After the long trek to the hotel and COusin Jake's orientation to island life, we dumped our bags and freshened ourselves for somewhat of a night out.  It was 7pm but our bodies told us it was midnight.  We set off on foot in search of some local flavor and found ourselves in The Hi Club...a seemingly innocent club set in the middle of some bushes and somewhat hidden from street view.  Bouncer dude came out with his little headset and ushered us in the walkway wondering what we wanted.  Um a drink maybe?  Continuing in we found the place to be charming yet very foreign...as in we were the only howlies in the place.  The tv's were all Japanese and there wasn't another straight eye in the joint.  We ordered two of the smallest vodka cranberries you've ever seen, (somehow I don't think the bartender would have responded to my ordering: "something with a pineapple in it!"), after shelling out $16 for the drinks, I was none too happy to tip the tender a buck.  They probably all laughed at us as we strutted out the door with our heads held high.  Next we landed ourselves at a little place called the Tiki Bar.  More of a Hawaiian feeling with umbrella drinks and a fat Hawaiian playing his uke.  By midnight we were ready to pass out in our stools so we headed back to the hotel to rest up.  Did I tell you how excited we were to be there?    Stay tuned for this week you'll hear stories of boys, bars and Funquita getting tossed out of one on her fanny.

      Aloha - Hello-Goodbye Mahalo - Thank you Honi Honi - Kiss Wiki Wiki - Right away Howly - White person 2 Hawaiian minutes - We'll get there when we get there Hang Loose - Party on =)  I don't' even know where to start.  I am so incredibly relaxed and stress free.  People on the islands really know how to make you feel like nothing in the world matters but chillin' out.  I can't believe I came back...we should have missed our shuttle to the airport.  We should have missed our plane.  I could handle another bunch of months in Hawaii.    I fell in love twice this last week.  Once with Hawaii and once with my Navy boy.  Mmmmm, I wish I could have packed his 6' 3" frame into my carry on and taken him back with me as a souvenir.  After 3 hours of solid conversation and a few beers, we went swimming in the ocean under a full moon and walked hand in hand along the coastline while being pursued by men of the law =)  I couldn't have asked for a better end to my vacation.  Who knew you could fall in love in just one night without tons of tequila and mind blowing sex!  All it took for me was a few beers and sweet kisses.    Today I am in recovery mode.  Trying to get myself back on Milwaukee time...that 5 hour time difference is a killer.  I partied last night since I was wide awake and had nothing better going on today.  I'm fighting not to go back to sleep for a while...I tell ya, the only thing I missed on my trip (except my friends of course!) was my cloud.    Oh I've got lots to tell ya'll, to be continued...  Aloha!

       urlLink    E'rebody in da club gettin' tipsy.  Yes my friends we had a lovely time for my Roomie's birthday on Saturday night.  This is my good friend Barbie passing out on the mongo size footstools in the basement of Tangerine.  She's going to kill me for posting this picture but I couldn't resist.  I had to stand over her in my heels and skirt to get this picture, damned if it's going to waste.  We had an evening of free drink and comp'd food as we strutted our stuff around town pretending like we owned every joint we went into.  But who can blame us, we were damn hot that night.  We didn't get card at any of the clubs we went into, one bouncer was noted to say "fuck it I'll take the ticket for their fine asses if they're underage" as we walked by and he nearly broke his neck trying to check us all out.  Yes it was quite the evening.  Happy Birthday Ang!  Just so sad as she passed out with her arms curled around the toilet.  I carried her off to bed around 3:30 and tucked her in with a bucket safely at her side.  &nbsp; urlLink

      In 3 years I didn't see him once unless we planned on meeting up. I never once ran into him at the store, the movies or the bank. Not once did we end up at the same bar or festival. Now twice, twice in one summer I've ran into him. Atleast this time I didn't have to see/talk to the gf. But damn if I didn't look good when I saw him. His elevator eyes were so obvious I was almost blushing.

      Yesterday: Work Brewer's Game Pass Out Boz's.  Today: Dying.  I don't know what happened to me yesterday. I don't remember driving home from the ball game. I don't remember dropping Bev off. I don't remember driving home from her house. I don't remember crawling into bed. What I do remember is waking up at 6:15 and realizing that I was TRASHED. After a quick trip to the bathroom where the room began spinning so fast I thought I was on a ride at the State Fair, I passed back out figuring to be awoken by Kit Kat to go to volleyball. No such luck. What did however wake me up was Freebird calling me somewhere around 8:15. Struggling to remember who I was and why I knew I wasn't supposed to be sleeping I incoherently had a conversation and freaked when I realized what had happened. Ugh. Then I decide it's a grand idea to get up and head over the bar. Sleep in my eyes and hair slightly askew. I met Freebird and company for many games of pool and about 5 gallons of water. I slowly sobered up and quickly developed a headache. Which I may add is still lingering. On the plus side, I came in to State Fair Cream Puffs this morning....mmmmmmmmmmm.

      I sent an email yesterday from my hotmail account to all my pals inviting them along to the Brewer's game for my birthday. Trying to get a general idea of who would like to come. This morning on my work email I received the following email from a Christopher Phillips:  hiii Lisa remember me? i got your email about the brewer game and it sounds like a good time. i figured id bring my buddy mark i think you met him befor. so your bdays coming up! atleast i still have a few years on you. :) talk to ya, chris  Okay, who the hell is Christopher Phillips??? Seriously, have no clue who this is. Either somebody is playing a joke on me by forwarding my email on, or I really need to job my memory and figure out who this is. Anybody got an idea of who this is??? I could really use a clue.

      Watch out, I don't want you to get any one you, you'd better stand back.  Who the fuck do you think you are making such a decision? What the fuck do you mean you didn't think I'd mind? When the fuck were you even going to tell me? Where the fuck do you get off assuming it doesn't bother me? Why the fuck didn't you just ask me first?  And that my friend are the 5 W's. Who What When Where and Why.

      I heard those 3 little words this weekend. "I love you". Why is this little phrase so god damn powerful? Granted it was said in a drunken stupor, but the conversation preceding and following them told a much bigger picture.  Am I so intimidating that men need to get drunk before they tell me that they love me? Yes these words are hard to say, but I seem to only get them when somebody has consumed nothing but a highly toxic level of alcohol.  Either way, I knew the feeling was there but I'm just not ready to hear it yet. So I know you're on the edge of your seat waiting to hear if I said it back. Well those of you who know me know the answer without even having to think about it. For the rest of you shmucks who think you know me but truly don't. My response to this was "You don't love me, you're just drunk"...by the way, this is not the proper way to respond to such a statement. The person uttering the words will not only have his or her feelings hurt, they will also be angry that you are doubting their sincerity.   On a less serious note:    Why does Michael Jackson hang out with twenty eight year olds?   Cuz there's twenty of them!  Ar ar ar.  (This joke works better when spoken aloud)

      It seems as though I cannot get enough sleep.  I slept for the better part of our 3 hour drive home from "up north" and continued my slumber with cat naps throughout the day.  Eventually I fell asleep somewher between 9:30 and 10pm.  It' snot as if I didn't get any sleep this weekend.  Well I suppose sleeping on a rock hard ground after you've been heavily consuming beer, korbel and jagerbombs steady is not the best effort for sleep.  Continuing on to the next day where the kick off of my day is a jack and coke followed by cashing off a bottle of Hurricane between two people and moving onward and upward to more korbel and a few beers thrown in there somewhere....while swigging from a jug of hot sex and taking double gulps of Doctor's as it makes it's way around the campfire.  Yea that makes for a great night of sleep as well.  Atleast there was an air mattress to roll around on instead of that ground with the rock that no matter where I moved to followed my right shoulder around.  Good times.   Best Line of the Weekend:   Crazy Jer's Wife "You've got hair all over you" said as she picked dog hair from the front of his black shirt.   Crazy Jer "Yea baby, I just got off the dog" said with arms outstretch pulling at the air while jutting his groin back and forth.

      I wish you'd come by some other day Whisper your fears in some other way Take me away from all of this Because I can't bear to resist You can't be what I need Keep pushing me to believe What is it that you want? Can't you find someone else to haunt? Your heart is whole and tender Is it in my thoughts you must wander? I can forget if I try Feelings are not hard to deny
