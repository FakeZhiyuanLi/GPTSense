       you are a splendid butterfly it is your wings that make you beautiful and i could make you fly away but i could never make you stay you said you were in love with me both of us know that that's impossible and i could make you rue the day but i could never make you stay  not for all the tea in china not if i could sing like a bird not for all north carolina not for all my little words not if i could write for you the sweetest song you ever heard it doesn't matter what i'll do not for all my little words  now that you've made me want to die you tell me that you're unboyfriendable and i could make you pay and pay but i could never make you stay

       i've worked so many hours in such a short amount of time. my mind has exhausted all of the things that make it happy. why do i even put in any effort anymore. it gets me nowhere and all it does is cause me pain. why can't i just stop?

       i wrote a letter on a nothing day i asked somebody “could you send my letter away?” “you are too young to put all of your hopes in just one envelope”  i said goodbye to someone that i love it’s not just me, i tell you it’s the both of us and it was hard like coming off the pills that you take to stay happy someone above has seen me do alright someone above is looking with a tender eye upon her face, you may think you’re alone but you may think again if i could do just one near perfect thing i’d be happy they’d write it on my grave, or when they scattered  my ashes on second thoughts i’d rather hang about and be there with my best friend if she wants me and far away somebody read the letter he condescends to read the words i wrote about him and if he smiles, it’s no more than a genius deserves for all his curious nerve and his passion i’m going deaf, you’re growing melancholy things fall apart, i don’t know why we bother at all but life is good and “it’s always worth living at least for  a while” if i could do just one near perfect thing i’d be happy they’d write it on my grave, or when they scattered  my ashes on second thoughts i’d rather hang about and be there with my best friend if she wants me if you think to yourself “what should i do now?” then take the baton, girl, you better run with it there is no point in standing in the past cause it’s over and done with i took a book and went into the forest i climbed the hill, i wanted to look down on you but all i saw was twenty miles of wilderness so i went home

       today was the last day of school for the year, and my finals for the day were quite easy. first semester i really applied myself and actually enjoyed the fruits of my effort. second semester i sort of slacked off, which is still better than the normal person's best efforts, but i did have a lot more fun outside of school. which semester really had the most impact on me? probably the second. you might sit and wonder why, but so many great things happened from january to now. some i've probably talked about, some i know i haven't. i got a job, i'm starting to save up so i can get a car (an suv, so i can actually fit into it), and too many other things to list. my grades may not be as good as they were first semester, but you know what? that's fine by me. one who lives a good life does not always graduate first in his class, nor does he often get recognized for his accomplishments, be they tangible or not. so many great things cannot be seen by anyone unless they truly know and understand you. truly happy people are the ones that have, side-by-side, a person who be with them to see their triumphs, as well as the inevitable defeats. unhappy people are those who have to live in a shell, hiding everything that happens to them, and not having anybody to share with their successes. the combination of the negative feelings of these unrecognized successes and uncomforted defeats is the telltale equation of an unhappy person. thank god (irony?) i realized this and now know what my purpose in life is, whether you do or not.

       today was my sister's graduation from middle school.  we went to that and then went to giovannni's, which is the nicest restaurant around with the exception of those downtown.  i had my chemistry final today, and it was much more difficult than i had expected! that's the first time i've not studied for something and regretted it.  it probably doesn't help that i didn't have a calculator so i had to do all my calculations by way of pencil.  i'm quite confident in all of my other finals, i think.  apush was 87%, which is poor compared to what i should have earned.  algII, 88%, again, very poor.  the only ones i have left to take are french and english, and those are tomorrow.  i'm not worried, however, because ever since freshman year i've aced every english final i have had and well, french, what can i say. je suis un génie :] besides that i'm not really sure what i'm going to do tomorrow.  last day of school, nothing to do.  maybe i'll go eat with my friends or go home and sleep.  i have work on friday, though, but it's payday so i'm not too worried about having to force myself to go.  it's weird, i love working at mcdonalds, but sometimes it's such an arduous task to drag myself there and know that i'm scheduled for eight hours and that i'm going to get cut after four.  it seems like whatever i'm scheduled for i only get half.  maybe it's because allen, my manager, is really fat. maybe it's because debbie, the head manager, is really fat as well.  perhaps it is some insane combination of the two.  whatever it is, i do not appreciate it one bit.  plus i didn't time-and-a-half on memorial day.  I"M GOING ON STRIKE.  words of wisdom: let others know how you feel, because oftentimes you will not have the chance to do so again.

       Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don't know how to replenish its source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of witherings, of tarnishings.
