      So what I was saying before.  This girl from my old neighborhood who I really haven't seen or talked to in a couple of years (with the exception of two im's) has complealty changed.  Every other word was a swear, something I never expected from her.  Not that I'm being condescending, to each its own, but she used to be so proper, always afraid of breaking the rules.  Now she's like watch out baby!    I'm going over to Tom's tonight to watch Secret Window.  I'm going to miss that kid when he leaves.

      So I went to the beach today and worked on my non-existent tan.  I hate the Irish in me(ok no I don't) and it was really great not doing anything and just  being .  I know that sounds tremendously dorky, but I'm still on a high from being outside and not under fluorescent lights.  I wish I could work outside all the time, just soaking up the rays on beautiful 75 degree days.  My Dad gave me the spiel on how I'm lucky to have this job because there are layoffs going on in his work, but that doesn't make me feel much better.  So I got an email from Alex today labeled "free porn" because I told him that seems to be all I ever get, but it wasn't porn--- and I got a real email!  Alert the press. Boo-ya grandma.  If any of you people out there want to write me, feel free I love a good letter.  I keep up with 3 peoples blog because I love hearing about others lives.  And how they different they become sometimes when they're typing without an audience.--Dinner More later

      So work was work yesterday (believe it or not), but I got through it.  I wonder what I'm going to do today.  I want to read more of Pride and Prejudice, my friends really don't like the book (even some who haven't even started it claim they don't like it) so I think they want to change it to The Notebook because its an easy read and then we could go see the movie.  Give Jane Austen a chance people!  Its a classic for crying outloud, enduring through the centuries.  Of course last time two people ahem*catie,Kelly*cough didn't read Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya sisterhood.  I just wonder if we'll ever have a meeting where everyone has read the book. Now watch, next meeting, I'll be the only person who didn't read it after all this complaining. My mommy is making me some eggs and ham.  Yum!  How many of you out there have Moms like mine?  Not many I presume.  For our first book club meeting, she did the whole thing while I was at work.  Decorations, food.  What can I say? The woman's a saint Any work is better when you've got the people at home cheering you on.  Breakfast is ready. Bye all.

      Have you ever seen that movie?  That describes my life at work.  Thank God I don't have to go every day. I can't quit because that would be kind of embarrassing to my dad and I can't work shorter hours because the arrangement is already figured out.  There's no way out.   This quote just popped into my mind:    "True Faith is not knowing that God can,       but believing that he will."  That he will what?  Save me from this job?  Get me to like it?  Start a fire that destroys the place so I never have to set foot in it again?  I'm tired and depressed. Good night all.

      I ended up going to Target, Kohls, Famous Footwear, Marshalls and Panera Bread with Emily.  They were having these great sales at Kohls, I got a pair of pants for $3.83!  I also got a pair of black and pink converse, a pair of adidas sandals that everyone wears with socks, and a pair of dress pants for the dreaded work.  I may hate the place, but at least I'll dress well.  I watched Dawson's Creek today in the morning.  I love how there's always drama going on every second in Capeside.  There's always someone falling in love, being in love, getting dumped, getting laid, talking about getting laid, or complaining about how so-and-so doesn't notice them.  So much teen angst, so little time.  I think I have to go babysit tonight for my mom and her friend.  They're going to see The Notebook and I'm going to watch Mrs. L.'s kids.  I wish I could go see it instead of staying home.  Maybe I'll go see it tomorrow night to congratulate myself on getting through another day at work.  And maybe I'm being a baby about this whole work thing.  Other kids seem to hold jobs without complaining as much as I do. My brother should be getting home today and he can tell me about it.  I hope we don't have to answer phones because then people will know how absolutely little I know on the subject of title insurance.  What if they yell at me for it? Pray for me...

      I have work tomorrow.  What a depressing thought.  I work at my dad's title insurance, and I image and copy all day.  For 8 hours. In a row.  Sometimes I even work through lunch.  Just thinking about it makes me sick.  My brother and I job sharing so he's working today, and then I work Tuesday.  My cousin gets paid more than we do for doing the same job.    I think I might be going shopping today with Catie and Emily so that's good.  I really want a pair of black converse and a pair of nice   flat   dress shoes I can wear to work.  Lets look forward to that and maybe a movie.  I hope the work situation gets better.

      I just went for a long bike ride with my brothers, my sister, and our friend Roger.  I was so tired!  There was a lot of wooded areas and those were downhill, but of course the sunny patches seemed to be all uphill.  Our friend Tom came in his corvette and we kind of collapsed into that and rested.  I think I might go see that movie tonight. I called my friend Emily who has seen it, and she said that it wasn't very good, and for a PG-13 movie, it was pretty racy.  Ofcourse we both get pretty embarrassed by steamy scenes, probably much more than normal people.  My mom got me Pride and Prejudice from the library.  That's the next book in our book club.  Our first meeting was at my house and we read Divine Secrets of the Ya ya Sisterhood.  It was so much fun, I love being with my friends!!  When we're together, well, crazy things happen.  Ofcourse with Pride and Prejudice we might have a "proper" meeting, but I doubt it.

      Hey Everyone! By everyone I think I mean my lone reader Catie.-- Hi Catie!!  See Catie, because you are my lone reader you get two, count 'em  two  exclamation points. I treat my readers well.  So babysitting went ok last night.  We watched Haunted Mansion which scared the bejesus out of me.  HEY YOU! Stop laughing.  Seriously, it was scary.  Then after the kids went to bed I read a little and then watched "Monk."  It's a show about a defective detective with OCD except because of his OCD he is able to solve all these cases because of his close attention to detail.  I recommend it to any of you late-night TV watchers, good times.  My Nana is here.  She slept over last night and this morning she went to church with my parents.  She usually comes over every other weekend to hang out.  If Grandmothers do indeed "hang out," which mine does.  She's full of great stories about WWII (which she was a nurse in) and the Depression (which she grew up in).  I remember when I had my Gone With the Wind faze in 7th grade, she told me about going on a date to see that movie when it was first released (in 1939)!  She even had a little program they used to pass out for the big movies.  The 30's and 40's seemed like such a romantic time didn't it?  I read the biographies of Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh, and the times sound so romantic.  Even when there was drug problems and failed marriages you thought "Gee if I had to have a drug problem and a failed marriage, by golly I think I'd want it in the 30's or 40's"...  OK you're right, not really.  But the other aspects of it, the fashion and the manners (who wouldn't mind being helped out of car)that sounded wonderful. Not about the 50's... and blahedy blah blah....Why don't yall say something when I start to wander?   Oh I'm so excited about "The Notebook" coming out.  As yall have probably figured out I like a good romantic story, but it has to be  good .  I hate those romance novels that follow the same exact formula each time. (My friend Kathryn was reading from quite a steamy romance novel in the tent the other night.  It was quite funny because she skipped ahead to "good" part and she had quite an audience, including me.)  I thing I really dislike about those books is that the girl usually has no backbone and just follows whatever the guy says.  Or sometimes the girl's wild and he "tames" her...What are we women, horses?!   As long as the story has a strong female character, that can stand up for herself, I'll enjoy it, hence my fascination with Gone With the Wind.  I read this book called Outlander and it drove me crazy because the husband, (the good guy, the romantic interest) actually beat his wife, and at first she was mad and then she forgave him!  WHAT?!  There's no forgiving and then getting on with the love story.  There is no love story!  I had to reread it 17 times to believe it, and it actually ruined my day.  Hmmm... My coffee's almost cold and I have a bit of a headache from not eating any breakfast.  We have nothing good in my house though so you can understand my dilemma.  You can't have fruit with coffee and I'm not a cereal person.  I could have eggs but I always make them runny.  Last night I was kind of sad because I was thinking about how my childhood is pretty much over. Next year I'll be going away to college, I'm not old enough to be on my own!  I just figured out how to put gas in my car, I don't know anything about mortgage payments or HMO's or doctor visits or money management or...Anything.  The only thing that makes me feel a little better is that luckily, I'm not the only teenager in the world who has to face this stuff, and hopefully I'm not alone in my apprehension for the real world.     Wow I just reread this entry, how many times can I randomly switch subjects?  A lot apparently.  But now I must go in search of food and shower.  Hi ho Silver!

      So last night was American Cancer Society Walk for Life.  It was a long night.  I got there at about 6:15 after work and met up with Kelly.  She took me to our little campsite thingy which was kinda cute and cozy.  Becky had brought a tent and all the sleeping bags were inside.  We had a couple of coolers filled with drinks and snacks, which surprisingly not a lot of people ate.  They had the survivors walk first thing and Rebecca's friend Audrey walked that.  Audrey was diagnosed with lymphoma last year and since then has done chemo and the cancer has thankfully gone into remission.  When I found out that someone my age had gotten cancer, it really hit home.  How scary that must have been for her, I was amazed my her courage to just talk about it like it was the most normal thing, which by this time, I suppose it is.    At about 3 am, we had no one walking because all of us were just too tired.  The rules are, you're supposed to have someone walking at all times, but when you think about it, walking around a track isn't that important, it won't save anyone from cancer, the $1800 our team donated, will.  Kelly kinda hung out in a chair because she couldn't sleep but me, Catie, and Kathryn slept in this huge sleeping bag outside the tent.  It was the only time I was warm all night.  I love being a girl.  Ok its 4:49 and I haven't even taken a shower because I've been sleeping all day.  I have to go babysit for my Spanish teacher at 6. I better get going with the shower thing.

      So I just spent a night with some of my nearest and dearest, Catie, Kathryn and Kelly.  Kelly is our driver most of the time because her mom bought her a car.  We were hanging out at her house and when it was time to go home she pulled her car out of the garage and smashed into her Mom's car.  Her Mom's car just had a little scratch but Kel's car is scrunched in the back with big scratches.  All in all, its not that bad, but you know how traumatizing a first fender bender can be. Her mom took it pretty well considering but their insurance is going to go up now. Poor Kelly, she was crying and we were all trying to make conversation to keep the mood light, but it wasn't really working.  Finally I just tried to be quiet, knowing that nothing I could say would make her feel any better. I gave her hug and told her I loved her when I left.  I know there are much much worse things in this world, but its hard to keep that in mind when something happens to you--and I feel Kel's pain. (I got pulled over 2 weeks after I had failed my drivers test for not stopping completely on right on red.  I almost hit the cop car, can't understand what he was so upset about)  I think we were both wondering why stuff like this always seems to happen to people who don't deserve it.  As much as I hate to admit it, the answer is that there really is no answer.  There is no higher reason for why Kelly had to hit her Mom's car tonight.    I hope the girl feels better, since she doesn't read this, I'm just going to ESP her a message. FEEL BETTER, FEEL BETTER, FEEL BETTER, WE LOVE YOU KELLY!!!!!!!!!

      Hola amigos! and welcome to my first ever blog. My friend Catie started blogging almost 2 years ago and I'm addicted to her site, so since I like to write, I thought I would start one of my own.  I'm just a little cautious though because I know I'll have to be careful about what I write, especially when I write about people.  Maybe I should use code names...  Speaking of addictions, my brother plays this game Starcraft for hours on end and refuses to get off the computer so I don't know how often I'll be able to write.  For those of you who have never written in a blog before, I must say its kind of weird.  Usually one writes with an audience in mind, knowing who's going to read it and its hard when you have absolutly no idea.  Oo.. I just previewed my first blog and I got shivers.  How exciting!   My sister wants to get on with her friend and research Harry Potter. Until next time amigos~~

      well its 11:01.  I just got back from Johns house.  Scary.  I'm going to Michigan all this week.  I'm not exactly looking forward to it.  Must go return library books...and sleep. Good night and see you on the flip side  PS I can't be held responsible for what is written, I'm so tired I can't even see straight.

      I can't believe I havent written in this thing since Sunday.&nbsp; This week has been pretty good though.&nbsp; On Monday I went to downtown Chicago with Emily and Kirby.&nbsp; We saw the bean and we had lunch in Grant Park.&nbsp; Afterwards&nbsp;I was pretty thirsty so we walked for like two miles to Navy Peer and I got a coke.&nbsp; Then we&nbsp;walked to the beach&nbsp;rolled up our jeans, and splashed around in the water because it was way too cold to go swimming.&nbsp;&nbsp; We were so tired from the walk that we just layed in the sand for&nbsp;awhile in silence.&nbsp; Pretty relaxing actually, execpt I still can't get the sand out of my purse.&nbsp; On Tuesday&nbsp;I worked, and I will not lie, it was really hard to get&nbsp;through.&nbsp; Thats one thing I won't miss when summer ends.&nbsp; End of the month is&nbsp;really bad though at First American Title.&nbsp; The clan surprised us at like 2:30, I guess just to drop by and say hi&nbsp;but they&nbsp;couldn't stay for long.&nbsp; Jer had to go to work&nbsp;from 4-10, so&nbsp;ofcourse at like 7&nbsp;we all went to his&nbsp;place of buisness and watched him push carts around.&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, we hung&nbsp;out in downtown and met up with Rachel, Rick, Phil and some other guys I didnt know.&nbsp;&nbsp;I finally saw Catie on Tuesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hi Catie!&nbsp; Hope Great America was fun!!)&nbsp;&nbsp;We actually thought we were going to watch a movie but ofcourse we get to Family Video and there's absolutly nothing to rent.&nbsp;   Today we&nbsp;took&nbsp;some pizza to&nbsp;Stephen at work.&nbsp; We went to the park and ate it and I took&nbsp;pics with my 35 mm&nbsp;of the clan.&nbsp; I don't know what I'll do with a roll of&nbsp;film of the clan.&nbsp; Distribute them I guess.&nbsp; Then Steve&nbsp;had to go back to work&nbsp;and we just kind of hung out.&nbsp; We went to MGPPL (Meadow Glens Park Parking Lot) and then to Ranchview to play some tennis which I'm really bad at.&nbsp;&nbsp; We also went out to dinner at Rockin Robin because eveyone is leaving for their separte vacations in the next few days.&nbsp; Jer to Alaska, Chang to China, Amit to India, Me and Steve to Mich, Kel to Connecuit, Kathryn's in Colorado, Kirby is leaving for her grandparents and Manmeet is going to India as well.&nbsp; We won't have everyone back until a few days before school so it was kinda the last hurrah.&nbsp; At dinner, the waiter gave me and Steve two straws because we we're sitting&nbsp;next to each other,&nbsp;Amit informed me that&nbsp;they do&nbsp;that&nbsp;because&nbsp;they&nbsp;assume we are a couple.&nbsp;(Gross!!) Then we went to Caribou, and as a last&nbsp;stop (ofcourse) MGPPL.&nbsp;&nbsp; We were playing the keep-the-ball-in-the-air game when this silver beetle comes sreetching into the parking lot and does donuts.&nbsp; Amit and Jer jumped in Amits van and they chased the beetle but it got away.&nbsp; We also had this white car come by and yell things, and then it randomly threw a basketball out of its sun roof at us.&nbsp; So quite a busy night at the park.&nbsp; Usually we sit there for hours and no one comes, so it was wierd having a 2 car night.&nbsp; Right before we left everyone&nbsp; talked about where they were going in the next few weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for one or two people, it sounds like everyone is going to have a good time.&nbsp; Clansmen, hope you have fun and keep it safe!&nbsp; Until next time, I bid you adieu.

      Its 9:09 Sunday morning.&nbsp; My parents are at church with Grammy and I am sitting at home.&nbsp; I think I'm going to go the teen mass tonight at 6:10 with Stephen, John, and Maggie Rose.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate Sunday's.&nbsp; They're always so boring and a little depressing because you know Monday is coming.&nbsp; Luckily, I don't have to work on Monday.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;I went to go see The Bourne Supremacy last night and I was a little disappointed.&nbsp; It was kind of the same old, same old, run-for-your-life-even-though-your-innocent story line.&nbsp; In the first movie, he had Marie and he had to figure out who he was and why these people were trying to kill him, and the audience was along for the adventure in his search for Identity. In this movie, we knew the whole time that he was a&nbsp;falsely accused CIA agent&nbsp;and it was just him running from the bad guys.&nbsp; The action was good, the acting superb but the&nbsp;plot needed work.&nbsp; And what the heck?&nbsp;Hollywood took some liberties with the book when they killed off Marie.&nbsp; I wonder what their thinking was behind that.&nbsp; I could understand if it would kick Jason Bourne into revenge mode, but it didn't really.&nbsp; Sure he was sad and mad and upset but he was just trying to figure out why they wanted him, he wasn't really out to get them.&nbsp; All in all, this movie&nbsp;is doomed to&nbsp;Tinsel Town's&nbsp;sequel fate- 2nd movie, 2nd best.  While I was at the movie, I saw a poster for a new Johnny Depp movie called  Finding Neverland .&nbsp; It's about the author of Peter Pan and his inspiration for writing it.&nbsp; Kate Winslet, and Dustin Hoffman also star.&nbsp; Hurrah for a Depp Movie!&nbsp; I only have to wait until Catie's birthday Oct. 22 (sniff sniff).&nbsp; Gasp!&nbsp; what if I wait all this time and it turns out to be a terrible movie?&nbsp; So far the movies I look forward to ( The Notebook, The Bourne Supremacy ) &nbsp;always seem to disappoint, so I'm going to underestimate this movie.&nbsp;  Finding Neverland  looks pretty lame, and that Johnny Depp guy, no one ever understands his weird movies.&nbsp; And Kate Winslet?&nbsp; She made one worthwhile movie, she'll never make another Titanic again...   ahh.&nbsp; I think I'm going to go read my book now,  The Heart is a Lonely Hunter. &nbsp; Oprah's new book don't you know.&nbsp; Until next time, Toodles.  PS.&nbsp; Amit,&nbsp;your Xanga won't let me comment.&nbsp; I don't know if you have to change some setting or if I need to do something.&nbsp; Let me know.

      I was just watching the special effects dvd for The Return of the King.&nbsp; It just looked like so much fun to put that movie together.&nbsp; The cast, director, crew, producers, everyone just looked they had a blast working on The Lord of the Rings movies.&nbsp; I hope I have a job like that when&nbsp;I grow up.&nbsp;&nbsp;A job I just can't wait to get to every morning. You know that old quote "Find a job you like, and you'll never work a day in your life"?&nbsp; I want that.&nbsp; I don't want to trudge off to the office every morning and gather around the water cooler to talk about what we saw on TV the night before, like 80% of the&nbsp;poor&nbsp;shmucks&nbsp;walking around America.&nbsp; I want excitment, adventure,  meaning .&nbsp; Unfortuanly my mom just called and she wants me to set the table.&nbsp;   Oh, the exciting life I lead.

      So tonight I watched this really freaky movie The Butterfly Effect.&nbsp; Not scary, just really messed up.&nbsp; Now I'm kinda afraid to go to sleep.&nbsp; I think I'll go watch Benny and Joon, a nice normal&nbsp;movie about two mentally ill people falling in love.

      So today was ok.&nbsp; We were going to visit my brother at his office and bring him some lunch but that didnt work out because he had no money and he had a lunch from home anyway.&nbsp; Maybe you people will come visit me tomorrow when I work.&nbsp; That would be nice  &nbsp; So then Catie im-ed me about going out to lunch with Kathryn and Kelly because they're going out of town.&nbsp; Kelly to Michigan and Kathryn to work crew for three weeks.&nbsp; Bye dearies, have fun!&nbsp; Catie had to go go home for a trumpet lesson so then Kel, Kath and I rented Mystic Pizza--which was ok.&nbsp; The ending you would expect from a chick flick.&nbsp; I wish I worked in a cute little pizza joint...  My brother John is being a meany (like my nice grown-up word?) and he's blaring the TV until I get off the computer so it looks like I gotta jet.&nbsp; You people better call me tonight!&nbsp; Toodles.

      Haha.&nbsp; Its 7:13 and Stephen and Tom are sleeping right behind me.&nbsp; Tom doesn't have a pillow and his feet hang off the bed even though he's at an angle.&nbsp; Steve has two pillows but neither one of them has a blanket.&nbsp; John's upstairs in my room on my fold-out couch.&nbsp; My mom is making our PB&J's (I wish my dad would just take me out to lunch) and I, sadly, have to go to work.&nbsp; Catie suggested I name all the states in alphabetical order, and Amit suggested some computer games that&nbsp;I'm afraid to go on to because my boss might catch me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I stayed up too late last night, 1 in the morning and now I'm tired.&nbsp; It was entirely my fault, I didnt want to go to bed because of the aforesaid reason.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a lot of weird dreams.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was reherasing for a play and I didnt get&nbsp;cast because I read off the card they gave me, I had a dream that Lizzy McGuire (as in Hilary Duff)&nbsp;wasnt getting up out of bed even though her tv dad was doing everything possible, like dragging her out to the lawn and blowing foghorns in her ears.&nbsp; A bunch of other random stuff I can't remember now too.&nbsp; Well the boys are starting to stir and my dad wants to get an early start&nbsp;at work (yippie).&nbsp; See you all later

      It's really late at night and I'm super tired but I don't want to go to bed.&nbsp; See I have work tomorrow, and besides putting off that, I'm hiding from the fact that I'll have to say goodbye to Tom tonight, since he won't be awake when I leave, and he'll be gone when I get home.&nbsp;  Already gone to Texas.&nbsp; Forever.  Lord, I'll miss that kid.&nbsp;

      Today turned out to be good.&nbsp; Amit came at lunch time and we went to go pick up Kelly.&nbsp;&nbsp; We got some Panera bread which was really good.&nbsp; Then we had nothing better to do so we hung out at my house for 3 in a half hours and talked.&nbsp;&nbsp; What did we talk about you say?&nbsp; Indian family parties, a cat named Mango, and whole bunch of other random stuff I can't rememeber now.&nbsp; Stephen, my brother is going to be so mad when he finds out that they came over while he was at work. But its all good now because he should be home any second and then he doesnt have to deal with work for another day.&nbsp; Yesterday I may have laughed at him because he had work today and I had the day off.&nbsp; So he may retaliate.&nbsp; Its such a futile fight because&nbsp;obvioulsy your situation changes everyday.   Now I have 2 people IM-ing me and its hard to write in this and type to them.&nbsp; Plus, there's nothing more to write about in this exciting life I lead.&nbsp; Dont you worry though, the next time I even  think  of an interesting tidbit, yall be the first to know.&nbsp;

      Last night was so boring.&nbsp; My brother went out with his friends but he didnt want me to come along so I stayed at home (sniff sniff).&nbsp; I can take a hint.&nbsp; Catie was gone and I didnt feel like calling Kelly or Kathryn.&nbsp; (I think since Kel doesnt see her Mom all day, she wants to be at home at night to talk to her.&nbsp; That's my theory any way.) There was nothing on TV like there never is in summer.&nbsp; I wanted to go bug Amit at McDonalds (and maybe get some free food) but Steve  also  took the car.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; My dad was trying to teach me how to play golf but I got sick of that quickly.&nbsp; I guess I'm going to take lessons with my brothers and sister.&nbsp; At least it will be something to do.&nbsp; --O yay!&nbsp; Amit just got on, now I have someone to talk to.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I'm not usually this pathetic.&nbsp; I swear.

      Nothing makes the earth seem so spacious as to have friends at a distance: they make the latitudes and longitudes.  Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862)  &nbsp; What do you think this means?&nbsp; I went to this site asked myself a question and then chose a color.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the quote they gave me.&nbsp;

      On friday night we had a goodbye party for Tom.&nbsp; He is moving to Texas on Wednesday!&nbsp; We went to Chiles .&nbsp; There were like 12 of us, it was so much fun.&nbsp; We could have gone to Mickey D's and still had as much fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone it our group just seems to click.&nbsp; I think we're going to Couger stadium tomorrow or something but I'm not sure.  I worked today.&nbsp; It was long and I'm really tired.&nbsp; I'm sorry its been awhile since I last wrote but I must go eat and recooperate. Goodbye all &nbsp;

      You know that depressing feeling when you havent done anything all day, and you know that you could have but you didnt?&nbsp; I feel like I just  wasted  this day off work.&nbsp; And days off from work are not to be taken lightly.&nbsp; I wish adventure would come knocking on my door.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Isn't is sad to think of people who waste their lives at an office?&nbsp; Sitting at a computer day in and day out with nothing to look forward to.&nbsp; I think thats the scariest thing.&nbsp; To come to the end and realize your life meant nothing,&nbsp; and that your time was wasted.&nbsp; I hope to God that doesn't happen to me.

      Writing in this thing while waiting for my Dad to get out of meetings on our lunch break is really working out.  He said to come back at 12:30 and we would eat then but he's stuck in a phone meeting with some guy.  He's actually right in the office next to this so I can hear them talking.  If he stays too late we won't be able to go to the park for lunch.  Its really lonely when you have no one to talk to at lunch time.  Today I went to a seminar on what exactly title insurance is. It was ok, ate up all of my morning.  Last night I hung out with the clan.  We always go to the Meadow Glens parking lot to meet, and from there we went to caribou. I got a free cup of coffee because Tom ordered it without whip cream and they put it on, so they made another one and they gave us that one for free.  Then we went back to the parking lot where we met up with Jeremy who had just got back from work and we test drove his mini-van and Amits.  I had never driven a van so it was good times.   Jer told us there was homicide near our house.  A few weeks ago we had seen this house that had yellow tape all over it and like 10 cop cars and we asked what was going on but they wouldn't tell us.  Jer's Mom works for the police dept. And that's how she found out what really went down.  Apparently the victim was found half-naked in a pool of blood, curiously enough she was found by the ex-husband who called the cops.  Hmmm ...That doesn't look incriminating.    My dad still isn't back.  Its now 12:49. I'm going to finish my lunch.  Well hope all you guys out there are finding life enjoyable. Au revior.

      Hey everyone.  I'm at my Dad's work right now on lunch break.  Its bad, he's at a meeting and I'm all by myself.  Today has just been long and boring.  Friday was good for no reason just as today is bad.  I guess when you have some place to go for lunch and you know its Friday, you have a better day.  Talked to my cousin Cait for a bit, she works here too.  I have senior pics tomorrow at nine, so I'm getting my nails done at Marshall Fields tonight at 6.  Man I just want to go home and relax.  Last night we had book club at Emily's house.  It was so cute she had an English theme with triangle sandwiches, scones, tea, fruit in wine glasses and much more.  The food was absolutely delicious and it will be hard to outdo this one.  Not many people actually got through the book and even fewer liked it, but that was fine because there was definalty no lack of conversation the whole night.  We're still not sure what book we're going to read next month but we'll decide some time today.  My Mom suggested this fictional book called  Jane Austen's Book Club .  A book about a book club  for  book club.  I read a review in the paper for this other book which was a true story of a Jewish woman escaping the Nazi's as a kid. I forget the title, I'll have to look it up. Its kinda weird because our next meeting is two days before school starts.  We're so close to the end of summer.--And I still haven't looked at any colleges!  Man all my friends have at least looked at a few with Kelly looking at somewhere around 157.  Well, not really but you get the idea, I'm sure she's researched that many.  I think I kind of want to be a teacher.  I want to also study theology and philosophy but those majors leave me open for teaching.  I wonder if I have the patience to work with little kids.  Will I get burnt out like so many teachers I see?  Who knows.  1:37, I have to go back at 2 and I want to research that book.  Until next time folks

      Fa la la la la la la la la.  I just finished P&P.  I had totally given up on that book but I'm glad I finished it.  Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth end up together as do Jane and Mr. Brigley so it all turns out.  I have book club tonight at Emily's.  I went shopping today for my senior portrate outfit.  I got this really cute knee-length white skirt and a sky blue top an Ann Taylor.  I'm going to get a manicure and a pedicure and I also got these cute black sandals that will go with it.  The new premium outlet mall is awesome.  Yall should check it out.  I'm so excited for book club.  Every month we switch off, last month I had it and we read Divine Secrets of Ya-Ya sisterhood.  Tonight we decide who has the next one and what book we should read.  Any ideas?

      Tonight I went to church for a one month reunion of the canton trip.  They had some good food but everyone had to share stories and they picked me and I didn't really have anything to say but they made me go anyway.  I like it better when people can just speak when and if they feel they should, not because they're forced to.  The trip itself was amazing though and I wish they had more.    Our house is in disarray with all the work going on.  My room doesn't have a door, which is very unsettling and they're painting the trim of my windows so the blinds had to come down and they're laying across my bedroom.  My room is my sanctuary and I hate that I can't go up there and relax.  On the flip side, they installed a make-up table in my closet, so now I have room for a desk.  I feel like its a waste though because I'll be moving in just a year.   I want a car.  All of my friends have at least a car at their disposal (even if they refuse to drive them ahem*Catie*cough.) I don't care if I sound like a whinny kid, I'm 17 and I have an excuse. ITS NOT FAIR.   And don't you   dare   tell me that life is not fair.  Even if its true, I refuse to live in such a reality.  God, look at me.  I'm whining about not having a car when just a month ago I saw people who didn't have running water in their homes, who had trash piled waste high in their front yards, who lived in poverty I still can't even imagine.  And I don't have a car.  Poor, poor me.  Well on a happier note lion king 1 and a 1/2 is on.  Must be going

      So last night I went to Blockbuster and rented Wuthering Heights which scared the bejesus out of me.  I didn't understand that movie at all.  I seriously think I missed whatever that movie was about.  For those of you out there who've seen it, will you explain it?  The reason why it scared it me is that its about this guy who needs to find a place to stay, and he goes to this mansion which has some creepy and mean owners.  A nice girl who lives there shows him this room that hasn't been used for ages and gives it to him for the night.  So he sits down and ofcourse there's a storm outside and all of a sudden a these branches crash and break the window.  So he pushes them back outside but when he pulls his hands back in the branches have been replaced by two hands gripping is.  He looks out the window and there's this ghost with white clothes moaning  Come with me, Cooooomeee with meeeeee .  And thats where the story begins.  Freaky Deaky  So now I gotta finish P&P.  I'll tell you all how I liked the end because I know you care.

      Friday at work was actually fun.  My dad took the day off, so at lunch my family came, picked me up and we went to Rock Bottom.  There wasn't much work, so I spent the day listening to some good Celtic music and e-mailing this nice girl named Arpita.  I would say I spent more time emailing than working which was what made it a good day :)  I went mini-golfing with my friends tonight, I got two sixes but still managed to tie with Kelly.  Catie won with a score of 53, good job Catie!  Then we got some noodles, at Noodles.  My parents had to go a funeral today so I was left home with my brothers and sister and the worker guys.  I took Maggie Rose to the beach, and wanting to get a tan, got a massive sunburn on my neck where she forgot to put the suntan lotion.  We went to Colonial Cafe for lunch and I got some grease with a little burger in it.  It was seriously running down my hands, it gave me that gross heavy feeling but then I swam two laps at the beach to hopefully burn it off.  We had the worker guys over here all day which was really uncomfortable.  I can't go upstairs and its me and 4 strangers in my room without my parents in the vicinity.  Not that they were inappropriate, but still.  Now my sister wants me to take her to Blockbuster and I want to get  Wuthering Heights  anyway.  Until next time amigos, adios!

      Today I went on a website and realized I had outgrown an old friend.  Let me explain. When I was in middle school, my favorite book series was not the critically acclaimed Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, although both are entertaining, clever and written extremely well.  I loved going on adventures with Frodo, Sam, Harry, and Ron, but I never felt like their magical world actually pertained to my mine, their problems, while thrilling, never were mine.  I loved their lives, but knew I could never live in their fantasy existence.  Alice McKinley was a girl who had a life I could relate to.   The Alice series by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor posed the same dilemma's that I had.  Asked and answered the same questions that bothered me. There must be about 10 or 11 books out and I have read them all.  They start when she's in sixth grade and I think she's now a sophomore.  6th grade is time when you're outgrowing the junior section of the library but not quite ready for the teenage section.  Alice, a book  about  a 6th grader was my bridge into new territory.  I avidly read all of her books wishing she was real and I could be her friend.  When I heard they were going to make a movie, I knew I was perfect for the starring role.    But I am fast outgrowing Alice.   There are 3 books to every year of Alice's life, and while at one point we were the same age, I have finally surpassed Alice.  A sad thing, like losing a close friend.  She got me through some tough times and for that I'll always be thankful.  And while I'll still probably read the Alice books, they aren't quite for me anymore.  They are for the thousands of others yet to discover her, and in doing so, will discover themselves.

      Ok, I'm going to try and write a blog without it all being lost in a computer crash.  For you computer junkies out there, is there anyway to save a blog as you type?  Your comments would be most appreciated.  So today at work was ok.  Nine hours is rather long though, I don't know how the office people do it every day with out losing their insanity.  Part time is good enough for me.  So I've given Pride and Prejudice a chance so I have a reason to say this, its a harder book than some to get through.  I'm only half way, and I only have until Monday.  I had this huge spat with one of my friends but its over now.  What a relief...and that's all I have to say about that.

      My morning was luxurious, I didn't wake up until 10:48, which may not sound like much to you, but I think it beats my previous record of 10:30.  I come from a family of early birds, it's uncommon for my dad to sleep past 5:30.  So when I get up at 8 he always jokes that the day is half over, that I may as well just give up and go back to bed.  I wonder what I'm going to do today.  Sundays always seem to drag by...

      Have you all ever seen that movie?  Its one of the greatest of all time and I was just watching it on Turner Classic Movies.  My favorite line is after they've found Tom Robinson guilty and Atticus Finch walks out of the courtroom and the black man tells Scout to "Get up, your father's passin'"  The whole movie has such quiet dignity, and it doesn't over-explain things too much like movies today tend to do.  I won't say any more about it except if you haven't seen it or read it, go out and rent it today.  My headache is better since we turned the AC on.  My brother John is at a birthday party, and my other brother Stephen is out bowling with his friends.  I kinda wanted a night home for once.  I was going to go see that movie but Mom says that she doesn't want me to see it because of the bad scenes.  I understand her point, I hate sex scenes, they're so embarrassing!  Cold Mountain was physically painful at times, I kid you not.  Especially when you're with your mother.    I wrote a letter to my friend Bernadette tonight.  We still keep in touch with snail mail.  It's nice to get a real letter once in awhile instead of College ads.  I'm so sick of thinking about college.  I want to "Forrest Gump" my way through life and just see where it takes me, however I am way to much of control freak to let myself do that.    "The Best Years of Our Lives" is on now.  I think my Dad wants me to watch it.  Good night all.

      So the party today was a total bust.  It rained most of the time and as soon as we got in the water we had to get out because of rain.  We couldn't go in the indoor pool either because lightning might strike through the glass and into the pool.  What a joke.  My cousin just left after an hour and never came back. She's my age, and we used to be really good friends, like sleepovers every other week.  Since high school started though we've been drifting.  Even in 7th and 8th grade I could feel her starting to go.  She reached an all time low though today with the actual leaving.  Usually she just calls her friends on her cell phone when I'm over or goes on the computer and IM's them.  She also likes to leave early and go to her friends' house, but to actually leave for the entire day, that's really rude-even for her.  The funny thing is, she sees me twice a year and them everyday.  Ah well.  I've had time to get used it so its not a complete surprise.  Why do families always have to disappoint us so? Or at least my extended family always seems too.  Then again, maybe its normal for teenagers to ditch the families in search of friends.  Maybe she has it right and I'm messed up.  Anyway, I need to get away from it all.  Its muggy and rainy outside, the worst kind of weather possible so that's not improving my mood.  My hair frizzes and I get a little bit of a headache.   I said I would do something with Ben tomorrow but I don't know what.  Maybe I can drag him to   The Notebook  .  That's about all for now folks, yall come back now, ya hear?

      Tonight I went over to Kathryn's and we hung out at her house.  It was quite fun, Jer, Kel, Kath, Steve and me threw a this blue ball around for the better part of a half an hour.  I mean we didn't silently throw a ball around, we just talked and absentmindedly threw the ball.  It just started with Kathryn bouncing it, saying how it must be annoying to hear that sound so she threw it to one of us, who threw it to another person and so on.  Good times.   Another part of my day that made it was good was that I had to call this number for help with my computer.  The guy who helped me was from Texas and he had the most sultry voice..He is now known as cute-Texas-phone-boy with my friends.  We had some weird conversations--matches led to gay marriage somehow.  Our next door neighbors are having this huge party.  There was like 20 teenagers in my driveway when I came home.  I wish they'd leave...Good for nothin teenagers--I hate em!  I want to go to the beach tomorrow.  I'm also going to ribfest!  yay leonarnd skinard.  Go white sox and who ever plays the flubs!

      Today work did not, I repeat,  not  make me want to shoot myself.  In fact I might go so far to say it wasn't bad at all.  In fact,you might even say I was  content !  I know this comes as a surprise to my readers that I could ever put "content" and "work" in the same sentence, in fact it came as a surprise to even me.   "Life is funny with it's twists and turns, as everyone of us sometimes learns" that's from a poem called  don't Quit  and I think its really true.  Have you ever had something really unexpected happen?  I mean something that was  absolutely   hopeless  and somehow, it all worked out in the end?  You do a double-take and think "wow, did that really work out? How did that happen?"   "Everything will work in the end, if its not working out, its not the end"  Take it from a 67 year old man in my church, for every thing there is a reason, and in the end, all of your inconveniences and troubles, turned out for the best.

      Grrr... I hate senior pics.  Its so confusing with all the million of poses and packages that you have to choose.  I don't have any idea what I want and I don't feel like picking.  Sra Wood called me this morning and woke me up wondering if I wanted to babysit.  Its a Saturday night which isnt my favorite time to babysit but its nice having some extra dough.  So yeah this week has been quiet.  I want to call someone but there's nothing to do and we would just end up being bored together.  I wonder if there's anything on TV....  O what an interesting life I lead.

      I really wish that I didnt have to move in the middle of high school.  I was cleaning out my closet, flipping through old year books from middle school, and thinking how unfortunate that I didn't get to go to highschool with the people I grew up with. Or grow up with the people I went to High School with. Not that my friends in here aren't great, in fact they're wonderful, and I'm blessed to know most of them, but I don't have that history that they have. Its sad (but necessary) to see your old best friends move on and make new ones.  Even though you've done the same. People always say they'll keep in touch, but its never like it was.  (Sorry Tom I miss you hun, and we all think of you and wonder what you're doing) Its annoying though, to make the transition in the middle of high school. Once in awhile (these times are far and few between) when I go back and look at old memories I feel like I'm straddling two lives, one in Gurnee and one in Naperville. My past is there, and my present here, and who knows where the heck my future is? For all those who were the new kid at one point, you know what I'm talking about. Most of the time it doesn't bother me, but now and again I wonder what if.  What if my dad hadn't have gotten transferred? What if I had gone to Carmel or Warren? Who would my friends have been? Would I have turned out as a different person? What if we had moved into another school district? What if what if what if. All these doubts. And then I remember. Life in Naperville aint that bad. My school is fun, my problems workable, my friends and family--always interesting. And the memories?  Irreplaceable.

      Last night I had a sleepover with Joanne and kelly, it was so much fun!  Kelly went to bed and 11:30 and then me and Joanne turned off the light fully intent on going to sleep as well and then we ended up talking for another 3 in a half hours.  Good times.  We also went to go see PD2.  Awesome!!

      My day doesn't quite feel complete until I've written in this thing. Today was fun, hanging with my homey's. I volunteered today at school and stupidly wore high heels which killed because I was given a job as a runner which meant I took the printed ID cards to the last station to be picked up by the freshman when they were done with everything.  I watched Office Space over at Joannes which reminded me of work tomorrow. I feel like that place is sucking the soul right out of me. I am wasting my life in a cubicle. Bright and cheery thought for tomorrow. haha. Well good night kiddies  Catie--the blog thing doesn't type every letter, any suggestions? I know its not my keyboard because it types fine with im's. Thanks hun!

      Jeremy and Roger are over right now.  I was banished from the living room because the board game Risk came out and we all know girls are incapable of playing it, or so Stephen would have you believe.  But thats fine  because conquering countries as a sport doesnt seem like that much fun to me.  Something is wrong with this keyboard, I have to type everything twice because it doesnt get every other letter.  Grrrrr.... I dn't lik tis thig.

      I am back in Naperville!  I saw Joanne yesterday, I'm so glad she's back and I want her to take me to England some time.  It looked like so much fun.  We went to go see  Little Black Book which was a pretty good movie, and if you listen it has some pretty good advice thats slid in there.  Not your typical romantic comedy, not anything life-altering (so few movies are) but pretty good.   I went to the beach today with Emily.  We jumped in, the lifeguard yelled at us for not doing free style and as soon as we got to the raft they blew the whistle for everyone to clear the water.  So we spent about 4 minutes in the water and 2 and in a half hours talking.  I also got some Cold Stone ice cream (which is so hard to finish) and I saw Julia, Joanne's sister, who had just started work.  Speaking of work, I have it tomorrow. Blah.  I hate my job. I hate my job.  I hate my job.  Only three more days. MCG

      I'm writing from the Van Buren District Gobles Branch library. This week hasn't been as boring as suspected although I still haven't done much. So far, in two days I've read two books.  The Jane Austen Book Club  which wasn't that bad, but I think it might be hard to have a book discussion about a book that's about a book club--if that makes any sense. It was good though. I also read  The Hellion Bride , a paperback that I found up at Hilltop (our cottage). I finished that one in a day. The next one I'm going to read is  Dantes Club . Kind of philosophical mystery, like  Da Vinci Code . Actually, the librarian that recommends  Da Vinci Code  to us last summer, also recommends this book. She told us to read it before it it was a number one best seller, so I have a feeling this one is going to be good too. Besides the book, I've spent some lazy days at the beach. My brother broke his collarbone so we haven't done much swimming. My Aunt is coming up today with her two boys Jack and Joe. It's raining, so I hope it will clear up, but my mom just read the forecast and its supposed to rain all day. And its supposed to be cloudy the next few days. Great, they drive 3 in a half hours for it to rain. Oh boy, this should be interesting.  ***Hi Catie! Having fun by yourself? :) Tell Jo I say hi and welcome home. We'll all be home in a few days. I think we're shooting for late Saturday. See you then!
