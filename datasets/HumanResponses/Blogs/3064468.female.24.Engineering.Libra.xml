      From Matrix revolutions, the lyrics to Neodaemmerung (played during the big showdown between Smith and Neo) are actually taken from the Upanisads. The first verse:  asato my sad gamaya                                  tamaso my to jyotir gamaya                           mrtyor mamrtam gamaya                                                       From delusion lead me to truth                    From darkness lead me to light                    From death lead me to immortality.   etc....  Thats interesting, because the upanisads, Brhadaranyaka, Isa, Mundaka, Katha, and all the others, are the end of the  Vedas, and is the source of Vedanta philosophy, aka science of self-knowledge. essentially the universe we experience is not real, and there is a higher truth to be perceived linked with divinity ... we are ignorant to our true nature and the goal of the self is an understanding of our true nature, and in that way, "free" ourselves, achieve a "higher state of consciousness". sounds very matrixy-y doesnt it. as I read this, i recall Plato's theory of forms, albeit somewhat different, its got the same idea of the illusion of our pereption, that what we perceive are merely shadows of what is real, what is perfect.   These are the most sacred text of hindhuism ..   found this quote: "The Absolute Consciousness is the fundamental cause of the universe and everything in it. It is free and perfect, unlimited by time, space, and causation. The individual Consciousness or the Self which appears to be limited by time, space, and causation is also free and perfect. It has come from that Absolute Consciousness. When a competent aspirant learns this from a teacher and discriminates the Self from the non-self, he comes to know that he is fundamentally that Absolute Consciousness Itself—ever pure, free and perfect."  sounds very morpheus-ish, doesnt it? actually i remember in Queen of the Damned ie from the Anne Rice vampire chronicles, they used Vedanta as well, "Akasha", the mother and source of all vampires, is actually a vedanta word that refers to the source of all matter in the universe.   Katha Upanisad 6.7                                                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indriyebhyah param mano                                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manasah sattvam uttamam                                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sattvad adhi mahan atma                                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mahato vyaktam uttamam                                                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the senses is the mind, and beyond the     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mind is reason, its gasoline. Beyond reason is    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Spirit in man, and beyond this is the Spirit  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the Universe, the evolver of all.

      ok so tomorrow is new years eve .. and i'm trying to figure out what to do:  a) go to YS' place, at turkey and drink myself pissed all night b) hang around here in klcc, since i am working tomorrow and probably will be working late.  b is tempting, since i do get VIP seats to the show from the office (unless they kick us out, which i doubt they will). plus the fact that it'll be just about impossible to leave KL aftyer 5 tomorrow. although someone pointed out that everyone will be coming into KL. but then again everyone like me would be trying to get out of KL.   on the other hand, leaving after the fireworks and all will be insane, so i'd have to hang around here until who knows what time.   and i'd also have to find people who'd hang around with me. unless i wanna usher in the new years alone (yeah rite)  options options options ..   oh yeah, i turned 24 yesterday. not very eventful considering no one had time for me (except Hanis, who was sweet enough to run down to alexis to get my cheesecake and have the telawi people surprise me with it at midnite, since their kitchen was closed or some shit like that :). you know who's disappeared again as usual .. not surprised at all, since she aint got no guy problems (hear that? you know who you are. you take me for granted and i have no expectations of you! all that 'best friend' 'good friend' crap .. all dandy when you've got problems and need company and ears to bitch to. but once things are good not even a whisper in the wind. this goes for you, all you else who call yourself friends. you who whisper empty promises of "i'll call you next week and we'll go to dinner". you who agrees to plans and cancels on the last minute, and don't even bother to pick up the phone for a hi how are you lets go for lunch. except when it suits you to do so, when you need and desire something so urgently that you make use of my good faith and nature. to you i refuse to be your lackey)  whatever. i'm not that good natured. i got myself Carolina Herrera 212 for men .. nice birthday present to myself. and i'm still deciding on what my mom's gonna get me. speakers? sports springs? electronics? clothes?   options options options ..  yesterday went to lunch with sabrina, she was like .. tell them its your birthday they might give ya free cake. that got me thinkin .. time to start cafe a'hopping and free birthday cake a'hunting  ok i'm hungry

      sitting here waiting for hs, we're going to ln's wedding. where is this girl, aren't we late or something?   whatever, too many weddings to keep up with. honestly, I don't get it, what's with all these people and getting married so fast? Its like, graduate college, get a job, get a husband/wife, have 6 kids. Some kind of default template for life or something  anyway .. Say LOTR 3 on Thursday .. So good .. So dammmnn gooddd!!! man, the battle at minas tirith .. Especially when the rohirim charged in .. soo goooddd! orgasmic!! but then there was all that gay hobbit cameraderie going on .. the number of times I though frodo was going to kiss sam .. or that merry and moppin or whatever that other fellow's name is. if you want cameraderie, check out legolas and gimli. good ole pat on the back, now thats cameraderie. the hobbits are just gay. that's why I think (SPOILER alert!) [ frodo had to leave in the end with the elves .. cuz he couldnt take it that sam got married. it just tore him apart ]  mental note to self, run spell-checker .. because for the life of me I can't spell cameraderie  tried to get tix again for sunday, but at 10 am the line at KLCC TGV was 6 miles long. after like 15 minutes of crawling I figured i'd better run back to the office before my boss wonders where I disappeared off to. I gotta get tix again, I gotta see minas tirith again.   went to a friend's friend's party yesterday .. it was alright, food was pretty decent. bar was very decent. and this guy kept going around with this pitcher full of some weird green thing, I swear the damn thing would've glowed in the dark. said it was vokda+bicardi+pineapple. or was it vodka+midori+pineapple. thats sounds more like a real drink. anyway, pretty good at first, but kinda overdosed on sugar. after the fourth cup, I think *I* was oversaturated in sugar   btw credit cards are evil. I got my new ikea credit card .. and now I have the urge to run out and shop like a madman. actually i'm doing that on sunday, gotta go xmas shopping. nice long list. and while i'm at it I should get something for myself too right ;)

      man what a week. what a WEEK. and what happened o the weekend? its 5pm on sunday already?? and i'm sitting in the office trying to get some work done, and instead i'm listening to launch.com and bloggin' and surgin'  wait, not surgin' .. surfin'.   yesterday, after 5 hours of wandering around sg wang and low yat, i got myself a t610. actually i want this one samsung e700:   urlLink ">http://www.samsung.com/Products/MobilePhone/GSM/MobilePhone_GSM_SGH_E700_ac.htm   cool huh? looks reall sweet on the otuside .. but once you open it up its .. well .. its alright. but then again most flip phones are like that.  and since i'm superficial when i need to be, i'll don't mind. now here's the catch, that's brand new, and it costs RM 2200 on average. i was like .. wtf are you insane? its not even bluetooth  so, after hours of deliberation, i settled on this one:    urlLink http://www.sonyericsson.com/my/spg.jsp?template=PS1&B=ie&PID=10055&LM=PSM_V&gal=105   half the price, plus after some bargaining i got about RM 300 trade in for my old 8250. man the price of that is really dropping .. i paid over 600 for it, and apparently it retails for only about 400+ now. So I paid 1030 total, got the Sony Ericsson, international set. They also have the AP set, thats like 300 bucks less .. but hey, I can't settle for that can I? gotta go for the real thing man!!!!  besides, i figured i could always go e700 next year if i wanted to , after the price drops. The only difference between the two is that the t610 is bluetooth and triband, the e700 isnt. its kinda like a blond that way, nice to look at but nothing of substance  ok corny jokes aside, now i'm all connected ... pc sync with ipaq, ipaq bluetooth with t610 .. woohooo!!!! now i need accessories. bluetooth handsfree (400+), desktop cradle and sync (RM ???)  went to I's open house today, food was homecooked and good .. mm. and she wants to hook me up with her friend .. hey i'm game, she seems cool. too bad i couldnt stay longer, needed to work on this report.   speakin of which, i should work on this report ...   oh oh LOTR next week!!!!

       Koyanisquasti : "life out of balance"  am reading dan brown's da vinci code, really interesting, learning a lot about the history of christianity .. although most of it I already knew, (being an established atheist its my duty to know these things ;) historical evidence has shown that the current version of the bible and christianity are not entirely accurate. in fact the current version of it was really a result of charlamange's compilation back when he turned the roman empire into the holy roman empire, who's recompilation of the bible and selection of gospels for the new testament was specifically to promote the idea of the divinity of jesus and the role of women in the original sin, thus destroying centuries of religious ideology of the importance of the balance and equal importance of masculinity and femininity, centuries of worship and reverence to women and femininity and the source of life. until the moment of Council of Nicaea, Jesus was seen as a mortal prophet, bringing his message of humanity.   after all .. why should the act of Hieros Gamos, the natural sexual union between man and woman be viewed in shame? look where the lack of balance has brought us today, what Brown suggests as the "male ego [spending] two millennia running unchecked", resulting in "testosterone-fueled" wars and misogyny.   the fact is organized religion is about power. its about control. by way of suppression. and often in the pursuit of such power and control is the real goal of spiritual fulfillment often forgotten. heck, the term "organized religion" is an oxymoron, how could you put organization and structure on something as personal as religion.   imagine how the foundations of the church would shake, if it were popular knowledge that its version of history was indeed an inaccurate reinvention of history as a vessel for power. it would discredit its claims as the single path to reaching god. I say "popular knowledge" because, after all, what is truth but what is widespread perception?  its true what Napoleon said, "what is history, but a fable agreed upon"?  but this brings up an interesting point, what is "truth"? what is "real"? the fundamental question morpheus posed to neo in the first matrix. there's absolute truth, and then there's perceived truth .. and everything that we see or experience is merely perceived truth. everything we "see", "hear", "know" through our senses are filtered through our own preconceptions of what things are supposed to be.   how do I we know we "see" "blue" as the same thing? but then again does it matter?   therefore what is real? the world is full of data .. data is meaningless without interpretation. the screen that I see is really data on EM waves .. my mind interprets it as a computer screen. therefore, is "reality" meaningless? if perception is everything (flash that soda commercial, "image is nothing, thirst is everything"), if perception is "reality" per se, then if I were really hooked up to some machine and what I see is really a virtual environment pumped directly into my brain, is that so wrong then, assuming the conditions of that simulation provide me with the adequate rights to choice, comfort and sustenance?   just occurred to me that this sounds like what buddhists (or was it hundhus) say about the ultimate reality being "nothingness", and if you free yourself of attachments (mortal perceptions?), you will achieve this state of enlightenment, nothingness.   plato said that what we see are "shadows" of absolute, perfect forms. perhaps he was right after all   sorry, feeling a little contemplative today :)

      finally got around to staring up the bogger again. although technically I should be reading more proposals (man, can they get any more dry and boring?) oh yeah i'm reading proposals for work for that thing i'm doing that i'm not supposed to mention (yeah yeah, i know, i'm not supposed to care what i say in my blog or who reads it .. heck I don't ... its just that NDA I signed a while back thats hovering in my mind :)  anyway, yesterday I noticed that my front license plate had fallen off .. heck only knows how long ago. now my poor car looks sorta  pathetically bald on the front. gotta do my best to avoid any cops (especially road blocks) until tomorrow morning.   oh yeah .. i gotta remember to email di and nicole  i miss chicago. i miss the snow. this place, sunny as it is, is depressingly mundane. i feel like things are missing in my life .. things that this location can't provide me.   sucks doesnt it.

      so why is it that the blog address is *.blogspot.com, but the admin login page is blogger.com? damn it keeps confusing me  am reading Naguib Mahfouz, Nobel prize winning author of novels of postrevolutionary Egypt, his two novels that I've read so far speak of alienation in the face of social and ideological change, as an aftermath of a turbulent revolutionary upheaval. reminds me a lot of soviet literature, not the boorish, Leninist and Stalinist propaganda, but rather the subtle satiritical references to social and governmental ills. as well as kafka and his "Entfremdung" (alienation).  actually i really want to read his "The Children of Gebelaawi", which portrayed the patriarch Gebelaawi and his children, average Egyptians living the lives of Cain and Abel, Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed. apparently the book was so controversial it was banned in all of the Arab world save Lebanon. fat chance of finding it here   i dunno, lately i've been getting interested in eastern, south asian and and middle eastern culture and philosophical influences. not hardcore, its a little more subtle as yet. and i don't mean the cheesy asian pop culture scene with skinny guys in blonde hair and tight outfits. its that level of mysticism, cultural heritage, combined with the evolution of character and ideals as a result of years of oppression, colonialism and the birth of ideological influences, and not to mention an inherent elegance in simplicity and cleaness in thought and design. suddenly the aristocratic victorian and baroque bombastic influences don't seem so appealing.   after all, in a turbulent world we strive for stability, and often do we find stability in simplicity and straightforwardness.   or am i merely seeking my own definition of the self, my own identity. perhaps that is what the uneasiness and agitation i feel deep, and uneasiness inherent of having no stable ground to grasp and hold the self.   My own Entfremdung?

      http://www.johntitor.com/  f. pointed me to this guy, he claims to be from the year 2036, who travelled back in time apparently to pick up an old IBM 5100 machine, to debug the UNIX 2038 bug. apparently sometime in the next couple of years, the civil war will break out in the US, essentially between the oppressive government and the militia. and in 2015, nuclear ww3 will break out when russia nukes the US. china, the EU and russia will be destroyed.   real? first of all, the images of his "time machine" look like some cheesy prop from some cheesy 80s scifi movie. not to mention the quality sucks ass. i'll say one thing though, he's doing the right thing to make people believe him, by going around saying he doesnt give a damn if anyone believes him. and people believe him.   i feel that he's contradicting himself though. on the one hand he goes around saying he wants and hopes to give people awareness to what's going to happen. which can't (or maybe shouldn't?) be prevented, but prepared for. on the other hand, for someone trying to instill an awareness, he couldve done a better job at proving himself. granted its not his ultimate goal. but if he's truly as humanitarian as he claims ..   granted also that many of the time travel concepts he presents are valid and have basis in physics, it seems to me more rather a mash of carefully compiled pastings of research on the matter, which given the time and effort anyone could compile off the web. and when pressed further, the classic answer is "i'm not a physicist" or "maybe i shouldnt tell ya"  so where do we stand. if civil war breaks out within the next year or two in the US, then maybe he's worth more consideration. someone mentioned to me that in that case nuclear war won't break out because either a) he's lying or b) we'll realize he's telling the truth and take measures against it  thats possible. but thats oversimplifying. what if the act of attempting to avoid nuclear war itself creates so much angst and paranoia that it itself leads to war. nervous, trigger happy superpowers with enough arsenal to destroy the world multiple times is a very dangerous thing.  in that case, the very act of coming back into the past and attempting to create an awareness itself could've been the cause of war.   unless of course you buy into his infinite world-line concepts and percentile divergences associated with time travel. which, in my mind, is a convinient "escape-route", should his "prophecies" from the future turn out to be false. easy to say, well, the divergence between this world view and my own mustve been large enough to alter that portion of the future.   not to mention i didnt quite like his depiction of the future. sounds very rural-ish, kampug-ish. and his overt support of the 2nd amendment of the bill of rights:  "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed. "  basically the right to carry guns. you know, guns. those things responsible for the high death rate in the US. those things kids find under their parents beds or in their parents closets and blow the brains out of their friends and siblings. those things kids bring to schools and start a massacre with.   so lest see. pro-gun. enjoys rural-like lifestyle. must be a redneck.   and why the hell is his machine mounted in a vehicle, when it should be stationary while operated? back to the future?   hope this is constructive criticism. if not .. well if i wanted to be constructive i'd write an academic paper :p

      i miss travelling  last great vacation .. while i was studying in the states, spend 2 weeks in Italy (rome, venice, florence), and then another 2 weeks wandering around europe (paris, berlin, munich, hamburg, vienna, budapest, zurich ... errr .. did i miss anything ... )  i argue those to be the best years of my life .. went off to see the world, came back with empty pockets, empty bank account, maxed out credit cards, and a priceless sense of fulfilment and thirst for more. if tomorrow i struck the lottery or inherited a gazzillion dollars, i'd drop everything and wander around the globe  and i'd do it the best way. no cheesy tours being herded around in a bus. pick up my copy of let's go or lonely planet and get myself lost in the maze of civilization  i am my own herder.

      was at iguazu all night .. love that place. actually, there was this cute waitress there .. and everyone was like .. go .. go make your move .. go chat with her. but by the time i got enoguh booze in me to get my nerve up, the place packed up and she was busy.   damn...  sheesh whats wrong with me tonite.   anyway i had lunch with L the other day. I dunno, she didnt seem flirty or anything, just normal, friendly. and i found out that she lives with her boyfriend. and she went on a hol with him and his family. sounds like a pretty serious thing going on  but then again she did say she gets bored easily.  so thats why i didnt ask her out for the weekend like i was supposed to. M seems to think i still have a chance .. i'm not so hopeful. but she's still cool though, i wouldnt mind having her as a friend. and i bet she has cute girl friends too :) m suggested i wait about week and if she doesnt call/sms me first, sms her out for coffee or something.   good idea?

      "It is not the luck of the gods that has given the countries of the world into the palms of Rome. It is not the weakness of foreign tribes that leads them to throw themselves onto our swords in battle. It is our strength, greater and deeper than anything they can bring to the field. That is our first tactic. Before out men even reach ther battle, they will be unbreakable in strength and their morale. More, they will have a discipline that armies of the world can blood themselves against without effect."  "Each man will know that his brothers at his side will have to be killed to leave him. That makes him stronger than the most heroic charge, or the vain screams of savage tribes. We walk to battle. We stand and they die."  Excerpt from Emperor, by Conn Iggulden.

      "....Last night it was hot and I was leaning on the sill of the open window in the living room. Then my imagination got the better of me. A single idea had taken possession of my dreams, a thing I had never, never thought of, an emptiness that I had never felt. I was alone and something was missing. I knew that I wanted someone who would love me and whom I could love with all my heart. It is an image or an idol that my dreams have created and that I am searching for in mortal form. Does [she] exist?

      computer's up  now to downlad realplayer and burn some mp3s  and i'm still waiting for my pay. my pda keeps buzzing to tell me to pay my car loan. gotta survive another month :) wheres my credit cards  on the plus side, we finally finalized .. (sounds redundant doesnt it) a start that for the u-know-what project. finally you-know-who and you-know-the-other-who will quit bugging me on this. W is an interesting character to work with though, his first reaction to anything is always "what, why would i want that/do that/need that/let you/they anywhere near that system"??? and your first instinct is always to be like "yeah you're right what the hell was i thinking??". just gotta snap yourself back to reality and be like, wait a minute, yeah we need to do that.   i also notice that upper management has a tendency to stop listening to you talk when they're thinking or pondering something. you gotta learn to recognize the "phased out into own world" look and just shut up then and wait for them to say something.   L says i need an de-egoxiatian. or something like that. so she's gonna come by and do that tomorrow. :)

      got my maxis bill .. apparently I spent RM127 on international calls last month. funny how they add up haha. and then i spent another almost hundred bucks on about 500 smses (heck I know to who). funny how they add up to haha. wait how the heck did i end up sending 500 smses in one month?? haha.  btw if you cant tell, the "haha" is an attempt to diffuse my anguish and frustration and disappointment at not finding any billing errors. apparently i *AM* just really high maintenance.   i saw L yesterday .. she came over after work and she was sorta hungry and not feeling well so we went to get a bite to eat. think she's working out too much and not eating enough to sustain it. haha was kinda funny, though, was almost like feeding a poor orphan who hasnt eaten in a week. then we came up and had tea and just hung out, exhausted as heck.   she said she likes my company and my sarcastic sense of humor, cuz its almost like hers. and i make good conversation. and my nose aint flat and has character apparently. and i like kisses. and, come on, i'm just so damn gorgeous heh.   then she was like .. so how do you "use" women? actually made me ponder for a bit .. I came to the conclusion that if i just took you to movies (ie as a pre-event before going home and taking your clothes off haha) that probably means i'm just using ya, cuz i dont have to talk to you at the movies.   pg was being a bitch yesterday, something about not being over me and me inadvertantly pissing her off by talking about my dating life. and of course when i don't say anything she's like "oh no, i want you to tell me the truth no matter what i wanna be your best buddy i dont want you to keep things from me etc etc". what the fuck woman, make up your god forsaken mind. its been like 40 years or something.   driving me nuts.   i dunno why i even bother.  oh i was chatting with s today, she told me she fancies girls too, i was like, heh, another one. why am i like surrounded by bi or almost-bi women: l, s, sb, d, a, f (eventhough she refuses to admit it). oh wait what am i saying, thats a good thing, wohoo!

      right .. so i've been finally scheduled to meet with A on Friday. which just plain sucks because what the hell am I supposed to do till then? and How the heck are we gonna get everything sorta out by the 1st week or March??  so valentines day was nice ... went for sushi at genkis .. wanted to go for desert at chillis .. rich chocolate cake topped with a scope of rich vanilla ice cream, smothered in a thick, tantalizing coating of chocolate sauce and caramel. but then there were 6 billion people waiting in line at chillis, so i said, lets get some ice cream and brownies and go somewhere quiet. and it was quiet. and nice. just the two of us. *grin*  and then around 10ish she said something about sympathy (emphasis on pathy as a reference to pity) for the bf who's apparently sitting at home alone. left at 11. why am i not surprised.   she said i have an innocent, virginal look on my face. i was like, wtf?? but then she said my eyes are playful, like "come play with me, i know more than you think". and makes her wanna know what i know.   virginal? haha .. suurree.   seeing her again tonite.   the restlessness is back.   i think its a halo effect from the travel fair this weekend, which I decided to avoid at all costs since I don't have any money to book my Rm2000 trip to egypt. why join the rest of kiasu-malaysia in a pointless stampede. im not a mindless twirp.   of course, that doesnt explain why i joined the other half of kiasu-malaysia at the ikea sale.   just posturings, delusions of imagined self-importance. or a psychotic apotheosis of the mind?

      Reflections on a Mote of Dust  “Look again at that dot. That’s here. That’s home. That’s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know. Everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever WAS lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering , thousands of confident religions, ideologies and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every “superstar”, every “supreme leader”, every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there – on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam."  "The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors, so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds , Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light…"  "Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity -- in all this vastness -- there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. It is up to us. It's been said that astronomy is a humbling, and I might add, a character-building experience. To my mind, there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly and compassionately with one another and to preserve and cherish that pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known"  Carl Sagan Excerpted from a commencement address delivered May 11, 1996

      ok so apparently i hit my maxis credit limit again. which to me is quite impossible considering that I just dumped 200 bucks in there not two weeks ago. Which means that I charged 200 bucks to my account in 2 weeks? That's impossible, i've been consciously NOT calling people as much as possible and sticking to SMS. ok fine so there's a couple of Kb or Megs of wap charges (thanks to my pda), but according to my data counter and calculations that should only be about 10 or 15 bucks.   and there's no way i sent 600 smses over the past 2 weeks. ok so i made up the 600 ... sounds about right though assuming worst case to non-maxis lines at 20c per sms, 600 smses = RM120.   but of course the lovely people at Maxis customer service are kind enough to inform me that there's no way to review itemized call charges before the next statement. so i just gotta suck it up and pay something to get my line reactivated.   at least they were nice about it. i guess its not the customer rep's fault anyway .. its maxis for not implementing an on-demand usage view feature. i mean how hard can it be? all the charges are in there anyway in some database, just write a stupid query that'll look up all charges from the last statement until today, dump it to a HTML page. whats more or less how they'd have to generate statements at the end of the month anyway. except for the HTML part  unless that data is sitting somewhere in some remote server somewhere which just is not accessible in any way from a web frontend. which seems kinda silly.   the reason I ask is because I remember AT&T not having the same feature either.   anyway I am broke. just paid my portion of the condo deposit. so i calculated after my credit card payment checks clear i'm gonna be down to three digits. well ok 5 if you count cents. and its another 2 weeks till payday. 2 weeks of cheap lunches, locking myself at home, and avoiding CD and/or DVD stalls at all costs.   oh the pain. sure, "its an investment" you say. "pain now, gain later" you say. well, true. but what do i do about the pain now?   L asked me out for valentines. apparently her *darrling* bf is working then (seems kinda fishy-odd to me actually). no idea what we're gonna do. I actually wanna go to the movies, i havent had time for cinema in ages .. but she watches all the new movies in advance thanks to her movie review job. i'm probably too poor for dinner too haha.

      Metaphysics asks: What makes something real or not real? If all that exists is matter and motion, what is a mind? Can a computer like Agent Smith, Neo's nemesis, have a mind?   Epistemology asks: What is the nature of knowledge? "Skeptics say we can't acquire knowledge by means of the senses, because we can't be certain that what our senses tell us is true," said Schick. So how can we be certain that we're not living in the matrix?   Ethics asks: What makes something right or wrong? Is all that matters in life having good experiences even though you're a "brain in a vat," or the kind of choices you make?   Is perception of choice all that matters? Or is absolute truth the point? And how would you differentiate absolute choice with perception of choice? How would you differentiate the illusion of control from absolute control?  Is ignorance bliss?

      another weekend gone. yesterday I got compulsive and bought myself a nice dvd player. i knew i was stockpilling all those dvd for a reason. anyway i'm fully converted, there's just no going back to vcds anymore. the clarity. the sharpness. the realness. you can almost smell the silver nitrate.   so yeah the Gr. decided not to go out of town this weekend. damn gr. always screwing things up. heh ok fine what am i complaining about i'm the bad guy in this scenario aren't i?  she's nice to snuggle with. says she loves the way i touch her and i hold her. mmm. so do i. :) haha she looks so cute snuggle under my blanket, with just her eyes showing.   mmm .. compartmentalize.   oh yeah she said she isnt seeing anyone else. well, except the gr. guess he counts too.   so whats my goals for this week. get that #$@!@% project on the move. I have one week to get everything ready for starting on Monday. of course all this depends on the level of coorperation the P-side is willing to provide. heck its bad enough N took half a week to finally get around to getting more information on moving forward with things from me. apparently she's not going to be around on tuesday either. #$!@#$@# them. $%#$!# them all.   otherwise poor S from M is going to have my neck and my arse for postponing things again.   anyway now that i've made a contribution to the household and bought a dvd player, i'm gonna trade the hifi in my room (with the busted cd player) for the sony one in the living room. i think its a fair trade. then hook up the dvd player to the hifi and now we're in business  signed the SP and all those other legal documents today for the condo, damn my full name-as-in-IC, so freaking long. couldnt stop laughing about it too, heh i gotta work on taking signing ceremonies seriously ... you know, for future reference, when i'm a CEO or MD or something. can't be laughing my head off in front of the press.   then again ... laughter masks anxiety of the what-the-hell-did-i-just-do/buy realization. doesnt it.

      haha i had a consensus with M that the reason why we get along so well is because a) we're both gorgeous and b) we're both so messed up and screwed up that no one else can stand us   ok well i thought it was funny.   haha

      so apparently mr bf might be away for the weekend. and she has something on at midvalley. would be much more convenient for her to go from my place. i mean yeah sure .. subang.. midvalley .. maybe a little further away. but hey like she put it, my bed is comfy, she'll definitely be well-rested for her thing. definitely. plus i could drive her there, else she'd have to take the LRT. we can't let that happen can we.   hey i'm just being considerate here. trying to be helpful ya know. :) yeah. helpful.   and apparently today's my dad's birthday. wohoo (*sarcastic*). did i mention apparently someone was trying to kill him. apparently he got into a piff with some not so nice people. and the best part is, my first reaction was, "geez, now what". just can deal with him, its just too much drama. what's that song ...   No more pain No more games No drama No more drama in my life No one's gonna make me hurt again No more No more tears, I'm tired of crying every night No more fears, I really dont wanna fight No more drama in my life  ok maybe not that dramatic. but you get the idea.   Oh, it feels so good When you let go Of all the drama in your life Now you're free from all the pain Free from all the games Free from all the stress  you get the idea  heck he didnt remember my birthday. whats the big deal about his. mom's making me go down there though, just to stop by. might as well, shut the old man up.   Ad wrote about me in her journal. at least i think its me, (but where'd the "H" come from in "SH")? or maybe i'm being presumptuous :) but then again "don't be a moron" is trademarked, isnt it? i kinda feel for her, I think i've been somewhat there and I know how hard it is and how much it sucks when your head's telling you one thing and you heart's telling you the other.   or as someone put it, think with your head. the problem is, which "head" is current elevated higher?   ok how many people go that joke .. raise your hands and pat yourself on the back for being a dirty bastard :)  its nice to connect with people though. isnt it?

      so here i am sitting at home. alone. man i even cleaned my room.was getting late (early morning tomorrow).  she wasnt feeling well either, although i guess that's partially my fault (although i still maintain it takes two pairs of lips to kiss :p)  anyway its just casual. thats it. besides, she's obviously still in love with the guy. despite all the bitching and complaining. why else would she still be so insistant in trying hard.   i think she's trying too hard, and he just isn't. theres only so much you can do, a relationship is supposed to be a two way thing, isnt it.   anyway i'm staying neutral and .. well .. trying to keep my mouth shut, althoughi'm so damned opinionated that i cant of course :)  asked her why she liked me, she said (after some thought .. yeah thanks babe :p), its cuz i'm laid back and just cool with things and go with the flow. yeah. i am. so compartmentalize and screw all that emotional, am-i-falling shit. she's fun to hang out with and do stuff with and do stuff to. she's an attractive, intelligent young woman that I wanna ravish on a daily basis. whats the big deal.  oh yeah. put up those shelves. right in the corner over my head. hope they hold, else i'll wake up with a mouthful of plant dirt.

      finally got that damn *squeek squeek squeek* in my car fixed. at first the guy said something weird about it might be some absorber thingy. the blur look on my face prompted him to pull me outside to this car with an open hood and pointed to this rubbery thing that sits on top of your suspension. and i was thinking .. its a little plastic rubber thing, cant be that xpensive. so i asked him. he said, "dunno, maybe a couple of hundred". i was like, wtf? cant i just cut some pieces of rubber somewhere?  then he took it down to the actual suspension guys, at first they were like .. hmm absorber problems. great, so now i have to change my absorbers, how the hell much is that gonna cost  turns out they just needed to tighten something. i guess they screwed up somewhere when they installed my springs last .. month (heh, whoops). didnt cost me a thing. well, RM30 .. that was for the front skirtings i stuck on. hey, it was only 30 bucks .. i though it would be like 100+.   and then of course they locked my keys in the damn car. that was smart. i always knew that was going to happen someday, with my auto-lock alarm.   ok .. 2nd of february ... 23 more days till payday. just need to get through february. yeah. february. after all, i did get my .. errmm .. RM 34 "raise". "wohoo"?

      think i realized that my ideal job is really something that combines IT and Art, working with a museum of contemporary art or something, finding new ways and new modes of expression with technology. like that stint i did for the Block Museum, what could be more fulfilling than giving a new voice and new presence to an artistic and expressive minority, one that could be considered avant-garde and breaking conformances  plus you meet the weirdest people (and because of that the most interesting too), with the most fascinating ideas and are just so passionate about what really is just about expression and individualism, and have an inherent understanding and appreciation of modes of expression, which otherwise may be pointless and have no practical purpose.   and they have the most interesting fashion sense too.  but then on the other hand you don't make a whole lotta money at museums do you.

      saw an episode with an uncannily sweet ending message ..  *scene: butters crying by the ditch after being "dumped" by "gf" (who is really a cheap slut working in a diner paid to flirt) surrounded by goths who are pissed at life*  butters: no thanks, i love life, and yes i'm sad, but i'm really happy that something can make me feel that sad .. its like, it makes me feel alive you know, it makes me feel human, the only way i can feel this sad now is if i felt really before. i guess what i'm feeling is like a .. beautiful sadness ..   just like what i said all along, life is a balance, and extremes lead to opposite extremes. but why shy away from it, why shy away from being badly hurt if that means denying yourself the capability to be extremely happy.   too many people seek sheltered lives hiding away their "delicate" souls and/or hearts encased in what they hope to be indestructible and indiscoverable. yet why do we claim our hearts and souls to be "weak", just because they have the capability to hurt or suffer? or is not the capability to hurt and suffer part of what makes something alive? and is not strength and perseverance characterized by the ability to survive and pull through strife?   is not an athlete's strength and will-power determined by how far he/she can endure, even in the face of pain and fatigue? or is an athlete automatically termed "weak" once muscles start aching? it is neither the heart nor the soul that is so weak, but rather the mind and the spirit that is weak in its will to take risks.   and what soul may survive the suffer of confinement and the loneliness that is brought?

      hi there  i feel uneasy. uncertain. restless. uncomfortably unknowing directions and paths. unsettled. complexities of thoughts and emotions. unsure with no stability to rest my feet or prop my soul. i tug at my own leash but it refuses to respond, choosing instead its own, unseen, unfathomable path. or having a path chosen for it. matters not.   feelings are complex issues to deal with. especially when the situation refuses to unveal itself and at least give you the comfort of knowing what feeling or emotional reaction needs to be manifested or dealt with. emptiness and voidness. rawness and gnawing. anxiety and agitation. disquietude and inquietude. mental malaise.   fatigue.   funny what drives people. one may lack the energy to step away, yet have the drive and motivation to keep going. paradoxical. conflicting. mutually existing dualities. emptiness and voidness is worse than direct pain and hurt.  don't want to wake up another morning only to be disappointed again by the void.  lack of control is unbecoming.

      ever get the feeling life just sorta screws you over. like, you're sitting patiently and it leads you into delusions of having seeming semblance of control and hopes of good tidings when really lurking behind the shadows is a disappointment that awaits the opportune moment when your hope and ideas are at a pinnacle and then it strikes. and as you fall to the ground and the strength within you nurtures the ability to deal with such a blow, a second and third strike follows, which you realize are merely precursors for the final, fatal blow.   or perhaps even not precursors but rather subtle yet potent combinations that together deliver a torment made worse by the nurturing and cultivations of false hopes and delusional aspirations. the passing of which brings the dawn of a new cycle of hope and hurt and despair.   Heraclitus said:   Listen to the Logos everywhere always.  Spurn false myths that maim human life.  Life without strife is eternally impossible.  Awaken to the wonder of Power here now.  See the undying drama of opposites.  Rejoice in the eternal procession of Power,  Learn to live in harmony with the Whole.  Love the everliving Fire   life is strife. life is defined by strife. woe be those who fail to see the unity in experience.

      ok its been a while i know  apparently some ppl have been reading my last anais nin quote and figured it was a sign of some obsessive loneliness and depression. while i appreciate the caring thoughts, be assured that it was merely what i took to be an interesting and beautifully written quote and no i'm not about to jump off the 60th floor of the twin towers :p  and A's starting to freak not just me but C out as well .. the other day he msged me and said something like .. you're a good friend or good company or something like that. and i couldnt take it anymore and was like, dude, get off me man you're freaking me out. so now he's buggin C, apparently smsed him at 3am, woke the poor guy up and was like, what are you doing this weekend, and invited himself along.  man this is the kind of attention you want from a cute chick. ugh.   anyway i've decided i'm sick of dealing with people. peopel are lazy, argumentative, self-indulgent. people do things half-assed, refuse to take initiative, responsibility or ownership. Its one thing to bring issues forth for open discussion and mitigation, but people don't. People bring things up and forcefully ask you for solutions on how to cover their asses. People take one look at you and immediately assume you're out to screw up their work or lives. when really it's their own lack of willingness to cooperative that sabotages themselves and their doings.   people suck.   http://www.necroticobsession.com/gothname.html   Apparently my goth name is: Morbid Mistress. or Angelic Scars.   or  Midnight Fantasy. I think i like that one.

      am sitting here trying to go through these proposals and at the same time trying to stay awake. EH put it in perspective by mentioning that this has got to be better than staring out the window down in Segamat. He's got a point, except that I didn't even get a window in Segamat.   these proposals are another unfortunate show of how technology in the business world is always cluttered by business, management and admin driven overheads and red tape, that frankly just rather tedious. i was actually having fun going through the technical portion of the proposal; unfortunately happy days are over and i have to force myself to digest the other portions on project management and business value and commercials and cost/benefits and comms and and all the other sleep inducing goobledigook  espcially since they all have a tendency to sound exactly the same .. ever noticed that?  colorful diagrams help though  and why is it so damn quiet in the office right now?? where is everyone and why am I not there too?

      a whole weekend of alternating between sleep and tv during the day, and drinking and partying all night long, seems to have done wonders for my flu. except my nose is still running ...  i better go catch it. heh heh heh.  ok fine, lame joke. LAMMOOOOOO.  i suddenly realized that i'm lacking in something else to do in life .. aside from work and hanging out. most people have other things .. gigs, working out, some sport, painting, art, golf even. what do i have .. sure hanging out at bangsar or kl on the weekends is cool and all, but i need something more to flesh out my life and give it meaning other than work.   unfortunately hobbies cost money. uurrrggghh.   i need to go check out the spca volunteering .. ok this weekend.  oh and btw you know who got back together with her bf apparently.    oh yeah .. i need to bitch about that cat ... that damn slut of a stray that i was so kind as to feed and look after her first litter of brats. how does she repay me? i'm looking for something to wear in my closet, and i hear a little sneeze .. and knowing that that cat isnt pregnant anymore, i'm suddenly worried. so i start looking around the room, under all the boxes and stuff, but no kittens .. *pheewww* slight sigh of relief. quickly washed away by a sudden thought .. i rip open the doors of my closet and low and behold .. there nuzzled quietely in the corner, all warm in my clothes .. is that little bitch slut of a stray and her new litter.   clothes covered in blood and afterbirth and cat gook. walls streaked with blood, looking like something was slaughtered in there.   and if that wasnt bad enough .. the next day the little bitch gets locked in the house somehow (no thanks to my idiot brother no doubt) .. i come back and guess what, it decided to take a fucking piss on my bed. soaks thought my blankets and my sheets. i end up sleeping with a thin little sheet, the only thing i could find to shield me from the artificial cold. probably how i caught the flu.   i'm gonna kill that cat

Really nice doctor. Except that after listening to my go on about repeated illnesses and fatigue and inability to function, she just sticks a termo in my ear and one of those wodden sticks down my throat and tells me she's gonna load me up on pills and antibiotics.   what the hell

      its 8pm and i'm stuck in the office. not because of work this time, but because i'm looking out the window and all i see is a sea of stationary brake lights. i hear the duta bridge is flooded and semantan isnt moving at all. just hoping my trusty penchala is still going  not that it makes a difference anyway since with Tun Razak it would probably take me the rest of the night to get there.  anyway now that I'm officially transferring to iP Holdings, I should decide if i want to joint the management office or join global consulting. this is actually going to be a tough one, because i've spent a good portion of my rational-thinking life knowing that I wanted to go into software engineering, so I've had a lot of time to think and plan that. but now its a different story. do I want to delve in depth into something, or do i want to be a jack of all trades .. although then again arent most consultants more or less that anyway.   one thing i do know, I want to work on projects. i dont want be doing the same thing everyday. i need change. i get bored easily.   its funy how quickly things change or people change. for 4 years i *knew* i wanted to be a developer. i'm far from it now ..

      i keep saying i'm gonna blog after i get done with work, but when you're only done at 330 am and gotta be at work at 8am after that (although alrite i come in at 9 but whatever i think i earn that) sleep takes precedence and priority. blogging suddenly becomes an unnecessary luxury one can't afford to indulge in  yesterday was supposed to be my sleeping night and today my party night, but J decides he wants us in on saturday morning. its 6pm and i just left the office like maybe an hour ago.   man my life is sad. iPerintis gathering at bon ton last friday was my social event of the week??  makes you wonder .. where are we at, where are we going, what are we doing with our lives. it was different in college, in school sure you had midterms and papers and deadlines, but you ere doing so many different things ... or could do so many different things that it sorta makes you feel you are living to an extent. except around midterms and finals.   now its just work. after which i neither have the time nor the will, or even the energy to go out and do something   thats why i admire and envy E's life, you could argue that she lacks that stable career path, but then again when you consider her field (or multitude fields ;) of expertise, its not the same sort of progression  or career destiny that you find in mine.   i envy the inherent freedom and flexibility built into her chosen lifestyle. and I admire the adamant courage and boldness she manifests in embracing and challenging the inescapable uncertainty that would have many others tremble  so where are we at? seek us our wretched desires and embrace us our uncertain destiny? or take charge so as not to succumb to the whims of probability?

       Where are you and I'm so sorry I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight I need somebody and always This sick strange darkness Comes creeping on so haunting every time And as I stared I counted The Webs from all the spiders Catching things and eating their insides Like indecision to call you and hear your voice of treason Will you come home and stop this pain tonight Stop this pain tonight

      well i'm having drinks with some people from a particular company (which i'm not gonna name but starts with an 'M' and they make software .. go figure) .. and we're leaving and we all walk outside to get into our cars ... one walks into her Audi A4T, another into his alpha romeo, and another into her VW Beetle (yes, the new one).  and i'm sulking back to my beat up old wira with plastic bumpers and a crack headlamp hoping no one saw me and thinking to myself, "man i work for the wrong company"  as the malaysian work force we are used and abused by corporations, simply because they know they can. i look with scorn upon anyone who exclaims with glee "oh its so good to be in malaysia, cost of living is so low!". yeah sure, you can get your teh'o limau for RM1 at a mamak .. but i can't replace engine oil with teh'o limau or use 'roti kosong' as brake pads.   we are not fortunate, we are abused. i am abused for having to by a sub-par quality car at over 2-yrs worth of my salary, whereas my fellow college graduate can buy a USD15k car, a mere 1/4th of her salary. and since when is "living frugal" a requirement of a low cost of living? if thats the case i could move to London and live off saltine crackers and tap water and call London a city of "low cost of living"

      so what have i learnt from reading all my roman historical novels? what are the three things i have learnt about life, based on readings on roman politics and military strategy:  1)  Never underestimate your enemy , give due respect when waranted. Countless Roman generals and consuls have been overrun and hordes of roman lives have been lost thanks to the arrogance attributed to supposed patrician blood and disdain for "barbarians". Incidentally, the word "barbarian" comes from the Greek word "bárbaros", or "the sound foreigners make". The greeks originally used it to refer to all races of non-Greek origin; it later evolved into the rude sub-human, uncivilized definition we have today.  2)  Information is everything . Not just information but information of information. Know your enemy, its strengths, its weaknesses, its strategies, its whims and fancies. Know your battlefield, know your own forces and resources, and know how to muster and motivate them. And know and control what your enemy knows.  3)  Always have a backup . Never throw all your resources into a battle, always have fresh reserves.   i still remember what my roman history professor told us on the first day of class (and reiterated again and again, both explicitly, and implicitly via example and demonstration) .. Rome was not just a city with its temples and its senate, it was not just an empire. Rome was an idea, it was a vision, it was an ideal, a dream. A vision of a civilized world standing in the darkness that was the ancient world. And like all such human indulgences, the vision held and lasted long after the physical manifestations crumbled, be it to corruption or power struggles or external influences. And that's why it prevailed so long, long after the empire crumbled, long after the temples collapsed and the marble stolen, the idea of Rome still lived on in the minds of many. i think this is part of the answer of how Rome became what it was, it was loyalty and commitment not just to king or emperor, but to the vision of Rome that drove men.   Kings die. Dreams live on.   apparently F's brother hooked up with some hot girl and had weed at our version of boot camp. man i wanna go for that now, sounds like a real party

      its funny how life twists and changes and before you know it you're doing something completely different and probably so far fetched from what you had originally expected or planned. its also funny in consideration of that how everyone preaches that you gotta have some plan or direction in life, but is it really so worthwhile to make an effort if things just change and alter with whims and fancies that are probably beyond your control or comprehension? perhaps some plan is important, to add structure or direction, but I can't help but wonder if by doing so you're really just limiting yourself to your limited knowledge/experience. you think you want to do something and just that, but maybe it's only because you don't know any better. but to what extent do you trust your knowledge of your ignorance? socrates (or one of those old guys) said that the wisest are those who know that they know nothing, ie aware of their ignorance. and the most misguided are those ignorant of their own ignorance  a year ago i was sitting around segamat sipping over-sweetened tea doing jack shit but surfing and chatting. now i'm close to being assistant project director of one of the biggest (and most ruckus-causing) projects this company will ever see. among other, unmentionable-in-public-realm things. some things never change though .. i'm still sitting around surfing and chatting too. 'cept its not coffee and not tea, and made just right ...   maybe we should just hop on, strap in, and sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster ride ( but i hate rollercoasters! ). because ultimately, what control do we have? control in this world only really comes with clout .. clout only comes with power, power only come money. and while a select lucky among us have sufficient clout to steer their rollercoaster ... the rest of us tend to get tagged along.    random sidenote:  ok i told ch i'm blogging, he doesnt know what that means and i couldnt be bothered to tell him. and some how or another through a blur-5 line conversation he something seems to have gotten the idea that blogging is jerking off to porn. like, wtf?  oh btw Punisher sucks. or more accurately, Punisher as played in malaysian theatre sucks. I mean, bad enough the movie itself was weak, it didnt help that every 5 minutes something was cut or censored .. its like,  "blah blah blah you gotta di... *snip* *bang ban..* *snip* *punisher standing looking incredibly blur* *snip* *silly lame attempt at stupid jok...* *snip*" . and what the hell was up with the guy and the guitar and the singing at breakfast??  john travolta did a pretty good villian ala-swordfish style, except towards the end his character pretty much seemed to have degenerated into just barking find-him-and-kill-him orders and random goons.   nice cars though. 2004 corvette, XJ8 and a DB9 among others   and bear in mind .. things left unsaid don't imply there's nothing to say. it implies just the conscious choice to leave them unsaid

      i have already written too many in my own and its barely even saturday, so i think i am going to hop onto this domain and plonk a few tidbits to keep a few people entertained (at least i will be somewhat entertained, took a nap and now i cant sleep anymore, and guess what -- its fucking 3am!)  so sakinah told me that she learned in her personal relationships class (dont know why shes taking it, i think its just because the prof is acclaimed and famous, and goddamn brilliant, apparently) and she reported to me that "statistics has it that unmarried couples that cohabitate will end up in tragic breakups". if you had told me this a few months/years ago, i would have freaked out. but lately, the news comes to me as no surprise and i couldnt give a damn really. its to be expected. and since i have had the premonition being hand-delivered to me by he himself, i have grown very pessimistic and extremely uncaring of where i find myself. and with the possible moving looming in the air, it makes it even easier to expect a tragic ending.  kinda sad, considering the fact that we are reaching our second year. it's too bloody annoying. someone said "holy cow--you wasted two years??!!" (alikened to how i told myself "damn, i burned 4!! :p"  what is it with fucking men, i swear? and this is the best part. theres really two kinds of men. the metrosexuals and the machomen. i have dated them both, and both are long termed relationships. and i detest the fact that i somehow ended up with two extreme ends of the spectrum. is there NOT a middle ground?!   i think, after this foretold "tragic" break up, i am going to stop choosing men for myself and let others do it for me. i shouldnt be allowed to pick, since i like to go to extreme ends of the burning stick. what was it that someone said about the men your parents choose for you to either date or marry? in a more traditional setting, it could work. modern parents cant choose for shit a good candidate for their children, but if you ask those more traditional, conservative parents, and the success stories their children tell about how being set up by their parents was the best thing that ever happened to them, you begin to wonder, if you somehow were born out of context, out of time, and out of place. like most modern women (and men), we fear the notion of "blind dates" and "setups" and the coined "arranged marriage" terms, but are they really so bad, that you will continue to choose for yourself and end up wondering either, "where the hell did it go wrong" and "how the fuck do i end up getting THIS one (again!)", or the classic "might as well settle, since there isnt anybody around and i am so fucking horny, i need someone there right now"  i think i am beginning to understand chastity and abstainment. it makes sense. what you dont know, makes you not crave it. and when you dont crave it, you dont need it, so you dont seek it. and if you seeked it implicitly, it wouldnt be such a dire need that you will settle for almost anybody with either a fucking vagina or a semi-decent dick. i stick to the motto "ignorance is bliss" (and yes, sam's favorite saying is "curiosity was framed; ignorance killed the cat"). as much as i like that and as much as i have uphold my values to that, i am at this point in life (regarding relationships) have stumbled upon the door with a big huge graffiti:  fucking chastity is much better than fucking  fucking.    FUCK! gawd, why do i always end up rethinking things like this, especially when i really dont need to given the fact that i already have a million other things to think about, for example, the money-making venture called finding a fulltime job upon graduation.  im sorry sammie -- didnt mean to vent on here, but you are lagging in your posts, i have beaten you by more than 40! and i started three months after you did!!! =)  aight, thinks me done fer now. listen to hoobastank, the reason, everybody. LOVE IT!

      there's this ambiguously gay looking guy sitting in front of me and he keeps looking at me. sure, take it as a compliment you say. i'd just much rather he be an ambiguously gay looking female.  and his just as ambiguously gay looking friend is checking out every guy that walks by. how cute ..  so i've been sitting around the house all day wasting my time because we were supposed to go to dad's today ... but my brother had tuition until 4 so i figured i'd watch tv and go at 4 for an hour or so and then go sit a starbucks cuz come on i have things to do.   well he doesnt get done until like 5 at which point he informs me that dad says not to come until 7. i'm like wtf, i've been sitting around the whole freaking day for nothing. so i get fedup and go off and do my own thing, and my brother just called and casually informs me that dad says we can go now .. its 745 by the way. what the hell does he think i have nothing better to do than to sit around and wait for him? i have a life you know. of course that concept is completely foreign to mr general everyone-do-it-my-way there.   whatever  whoops there he goes again. what am i supposed to be, blind?   or is my noticing supposed to be the point?  eww   was watching an interesting episode of the practice today, this christian scientist couple was being tried for murder for the death of their 3-yr old because they refused to seek medical treatment due to their faith.   aside from the disturbing nature of watching your child die a painful death by illness while you sat back and prayed, one thing the father said during his testimony had sorta got me, he was saying that human nature has a line of tolerance, and that as time progresses this line changes and moves forward, adapts and evolves. from organ transplant, and now stem cells, and in the future some form of human cloning may even be acceptable. and as christian scientists they refuse to allow their line of acceptability to change and evolve  what gets me is his automatic implication that change and evolution of beliefs is supposed to be a bad thing? the fact is that everything has to change and evolve and adapt to the times, and anything that doesnt gets left behind. anything that doesnt evolve will die, that includes any gods and deities and any believes that accompany and support them.   in Lamb, chris moore made a good point, the character Joshua look at the great wall and realized one of the greatest flaws of Tao. The Tao value inaction above all else, and a wall is the defense of a country that values inaction. but a wall imprisons its people as much as it protects it. inaction imprisons people, only change liberates them.   gotta wash my sheets *grin*

      FA was trying to argue that we should be considerate of all others in our actions .. i argue that morality and consideration is tied to spheres of responsibility, which is related to relationships with people, ie that we can really only afford to consider those who are within our sphere of responsibility, or ie within who's spheres of responsibility we reside. because although in an ideal/noble environment, everyone may consider everyone else in their actions, but realistically, there's a limitation on how many people we can actually consider. in reality resources are always limited.  so for example, lets take a hypothetical situation A with hypothetical person, L, with a hypothetical bf, GAR, and Me, S (hypothetical situation that may or may not be related to a real life situation). S doesnt know GAR, and S is sleeping with L, GAR's gf:    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+++++++++++++++++++++++++  |---------+--------|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ |&nbsp; GAR   L   S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ |---------+--------|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+++++++++++++++++++++++++    As you can see, GAR and his relationship with L is beyond me sphere of responsibility, my sphere only encompasses up to L. Therefore it is not my responsibility to consider GAR and the GAR-L relationship, it is only my responsibility to consider L. It is L's responsibility and choice to consider GAR L and the impact of L S   now say for example, lets take a hypothetical situation B with hypothetical person, X with a hypothetical gf, Y, and there's me, S (hypothetical situation not related to any real life incidents). I'm friends with X, so that places X within my sphere of responsibility and vice versa, as a consequence of our mutual relationship:    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;++++++++++++++++++++ &nbsp;------+-------------&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ | Y   X   S |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ &nbsp;------+-------------&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;++++++++++++++++++++    Note the mutual overlapping spheres of responsibility  Now if i were to try and steal his gf, now we have a problem:    &nbsp;-------------------- | Y   X   S | | ^&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^ | | ****************** | &nbsp;--------------------     because X resides within my sphere of responsibility  someone might argue that if some random guy stole my gf, i probably wouldnt be sitting around thinking "oh she's a bitch but he's alrite cuz he should've have had to consider me". True, i'd probably be like "what a fucking bastard, how could he be so inconsiderate". True. But just because i'm pissed off and feel a particular way doesnt mean a model and dynamics of morality should be that way.   If i were to prick my foot on a sharp stone on the sidewalk i might be cursing and swearing at the street cleaners for not cleaning it or the city for not clearing it, when shouldn't I really be asking myself why the hell i'm wandering around barefoot?

      ronald reagan passed away a couple of days ago. can't say much about his presidency (cuz i don't know all that much about it to have an intelligent opinion on it, except for his role in the cold war). What i can say was something mom decided to tell me while watching CNN, that when i was 9 months old, and we first arrived in the US, the very next day Reagan was shot. Interesting huh?  enough politics. so i was right all along, she is sleeping with that guy (how do i know these things?). yeah fine partially my fault for asking, she started it though, she's the one who asked first :p who am i to complain anyway, its not like i'm not seeing other people. or someone else.   maybe i just don't like losing.   no its not that.   on a positive note, they're making a movie on Alexander the Great, I can't wait. Colin Ferral (sp?) as Alexander doesn't quite cut it though, i don't see him doing Alexnder justice, he's just not charismatic enough. dammit, he's just blur looking. but with angelina jolie and anthony hopkins (as darius, maybe?), might just save the day.   but if they go by history, you're talking one of the greatest battles in history, Alexander's army facing the numerically superior persian army of Darius III, with elephants (sounds familiar?). Alexander's triumph in face of immenant defeat was in a personally lead charge by his remaining forces direct into the persian line against darius himself (sounds familiar?).   we shall see ...  "and what may at first seem like a series of unfortunate events, may in fact be the beginning of a journey"

      went to this malay wedding last night with Sb, nothing particularly interesting (except that apparently the bride is the sister of some TV host of some local show called 3R, which i've vaguely heard about). What was interesting was the dessert they served, Tapai with ice cream. Tapai is a dessert made from fermenting rice with yeast and sugar, or something like that, which is of coruse quite similar to making sake or wine. now, i've alays thought tapai was alcoholic, heck it even tastes midly that way too. i mean, makes sense doesn't it, fermentation produces alcohol as a by-product doesnt it?  did a little poking around, apparently at one point the Kelantan Islamic Council issued a fatwa proclaiming tapai as halal, arguing that a) tapai is consumed before the alcohol is produced and b) tapai is a food, not drink (which is completely beyond me since that would make eating anything soaked in wine halal too since its food, nice little loophole). not to mention that tapai sitting around in the fridge for a couple of days definitely starts edging towards happy hour.   i take it as another example of the clash between culture and religion and the adaptation of religion to survive and achieve acceptance. you can't take a centuries old tradition and just throw it out. which to me is fine, any system, be it religion or whatever, must be flexible and able to adapt to survive. what becomes a problem is hypocracy when flexibility is conviniently applied when some governing power deems so, and taken away when otherwise felt. I remember once reading somewhere that Muslims who wished to keep Chrysanthemum tea in a flask were advised to be sure that the flask contained no yeast or sago traces, because the bacteria in them could produce alcohol. you're probably in more danger of getting intoxicated from tapai than from a spot amount of ethanol from leftover yeast.

      I feel detached and removed from my blog, probably from an extended leave of absence. probably the same way I feel detached and removed from life right now. I need to travel  so presented LD to TCC today .. man what a bunch of anal people. the thing is, no one told me I was supposed to present it until this morning, and no one explained to me what the hell the point is. and the other thing is, this deck was designed and meant for executive level decisions, to drive a point in on what the issues are and what our recommendation is (or at least hint at what it will be). of course its going to sound biased towards one side. we're supposed to be recommending something dammit.   and I realize there's a conflict of philosophies here .. on the one hand you have JH saying be all aggressive in your language and hit them hard with the issues and tell them that what you have sucks and you need to change. NOW.   and then you have the other party saying .. oh you gotta be careful how you word this and that and that word (which btw Jh used himself) might offend some people  bureaucracy is a dirty and painfully anal process that simply kills productivity. how are you developing an innovative culture when you're making people get too busy deciding on every word and phrase? you don't grasp the bigger picture when all you do is pick on details.   I think it’s actually an interesting challenge, on how do you manage the interaction and collaboration between a group of people to tap on their creative powers to address issues and solve problems .. but at the same time not end up in a committee-based bottleneck debating semantics? I see the value of placing decision making powers in the hands of the group, not giving any one person monopoly or dictatorship over processes, as well as not limiting the creative pool of solutions to a single source. but the challenge in creating synergy within a group of people is in ensuring a common baseline ground for analysis and discussion. that’s when you get bureaucratic  whatever I’m hungry .. and I wanna go see Disagree .. they're playing at Starbucks at midvalley.

						   hmm... i just watched "pieces of april" and it's very humbling to watch something that is as great as that movie - that's twice now that i have been touched by the simplest of feelings and yet also the most complicated of them all - LOVE.. the other time i was deeply touched about love feelings was when i watched "eternal sunshine of the spotless mind" ..   i won't ruin the movies for any of you who haven't seen either, but it suffices to say that they are on the top of my list of great movies of this time (i cannot claim that they are the greatest movies of all time because all time isn't up yet for me)   love is quite an interesting feeling .. if you evaluate love, and think up of all the ways you can experience it, yearn to experience it, you can potentially spend an entire lifetime analyzing and dwelling about it. love is something that i grow weary thinking about every day, yet yearn to keep because it feels comfortable and it feels safe, and once in a while, it feels fiery and passionate, and when those times happen, i want to capture those love feelings in a bottle and treasure and cherish them from the outside every time i think i might forget what those feelings are .. love also reminds me of home, of hot meals and warm hugs from my mom and hearty laughters between siblings.. it's hard to feel comfortable and cosy in this world nowadays, when support structure, especially for me, isn't around anymore .. my buffer zone has been haphazardously been removed and when i think it's there, it almost always sneakily leaves me hanging ..   why does that happen?  now, why can't love just stay constant and permanent? why can't my comfort/buffer zone stay the way it used to be? why are things always moving and changing constantly?   yes yes, people change, people move, people grow up and experience changes in their different lifestyles .. but in that changing and moving and growing up - shouldn't we be allowed to bring with us those loving feelings, as GOOD love feelings, and NOT as baggage? instead, what i am presented with are "baggages" .. some are mine, some belong to others around me .. and each of those experiences, and baggages somehow get STUCK on me and it changes MY already fucked up world ..   yea i suppose i can confine myself and not interact with others around me so as not to be presented with negativities, but even in confinement, i can imagine, i can think .. and my imagination and thoughts almost always go to bad and sad places ... at least these past few years they have ..   i can't think of the last time i was truly blissfully happy .. completely care free, oblivious to pain and sadness, and my life was so much simpler back then .. back when i had nothing to carry, not even my own baggages, and certainly none of other people around me ..   and now ... NOW i am presented with baggages every single day, and i have too much of them that don't even belong to me, and i am seriously running out of storage!   *sigh*  give me happiness goddamnit!

						   aight, i'm sorry i aired some dirty laundry on here, but i was venting and i had to do it .. sorry if anybody for any reason got offended.   *****  now that THAT disclaimer is over and done with, can i just share a thought or two about blogging.  have you realized how a lot of bloggers-addict tend to use this blogging hobby of theirs to whine, complain, and vent about their lives? everytime something bad happens, everytime something messes up with the way they view their lives, it gets blogged .. and when there is something good to write about, somehow that gets overlooked and skipped (and i'm not talking about joyous, significant, life-changing events like getting married or moving into a new house, or graduating, coz those are special happy occasions), i'm talking about the simple, honest-to-goodness moments of happiness... NONE! there is ALWAYS something to complain about, something to improve on, something to bitch/piss about, and it's pretty fucking sad!  the concept is eeriely similar to our faith, at least in my view of what religion and faith is.. people talk to God when they're in trouble, they complain to God or refer to their holy books when they need help. very rarely do i see or hear people talk to God or refer to the holy book when they are simply, normally, happy (but now we get to the point where we need to bring in the term "simple happiness", but let's use the non-life-changing-happiness-event and pretend that every human being on this earth IS capable of simple happiness and CAN indeed smile at the simplest of things)... now, i think it's interesting how a lot of people have turned to these blogs and simply pour out their hearts, to complain and contemplate, and to use the blogs as a sounding-board of some sort .. in place of God or the reference to a holy book. and for us atheists or agnostics who don't believe in one holy book, or simply just don't believe in a higher power altogether - do you notice how the blogging activity can be considered as "talking to God" (of the internet board obviously, but you are still somewhat enslaved by it, writing in daily or weekly, or however often you visit the blog - and this extends to not only blogs but also forum boards because there are atheists and agnostics out there who are afraid to start blogs but aren't afraid to frequent discussion boards and forums and vent out there instead)  i'm not saying that it's a direct analogy per say .. in fact i could totally be wrong and there ARE bloggers out there who DO write honest-to-goodness simple happy facts about their lives, but i don't read blogs that are happy - i only read whiners and complainers coz those make better candidates to compare my own pathetic and sad life to ...    but as i was getting my point across (or i think i am, at least i'm sorta kinda going in some direction)...  blogging is like praying ..   -you do it pretty much the same time every day or every week you update the blog (for the most part) -you whine and complain and vent, and hope that somehow some way, that all the whinings and venting can make you feel better  -there is centralized server thing that keeps track of all the venting bloggers do and if you have one of those commenting things on your blog, people reading can write back to you and you get feedback (God does it in freakish ways sometimes to answer to your prayers, but you see the pattern here?) -bloggers very rarely blog when they are happy  pretty interesting stuff huh?  of course none of the things i've said are my own expressed opinions only i just view things in a really skewered sorta way  but i think the most humbling thing about this is this:  that no matter what religion you are, or if you aren't religious, or if you are semi-religious, blogging makes you feel like you are talking to something/someone that matters (or you wouldn't be blogging) and even though that something or someone doesn't say anything back to you, you do it anyway because it makes you feel better in a scary, pathetic, internet kinda way, and that dependency to vent, even tho to an inanimate object, is just something all humans do.  we need something to depend on, to vent to, to complain to, to move along in this tiny, crappy world that we live in.   we just do it in different ways..  ......... ok, NOW you can shoot me for talking garbage =)

						   i give up - i hate my life .. every time i'm on the verge of something great, something awesome, something that may change the course of my life, i get brutally dumped on the bottom of the sharp-edged rocks on the bottom of the fucking ocean! how cruel can life be - to be tempted by the sweetness of an "almost-freedom", to be given the opportunity to live in this land of the "free", to be handed over the green-card that will allow me to stay in this country and work as hard as every other hard working corporate Americans, if not harder - only to wake up this morning and receive a "NO" phone call by the company i have fallen in love with, and to make things even MORE frustrating - it's not because they don't love me; it's not because they don't think i can make an excellent contribution to their corporate culture ..   why-o-why ...   and to top that off, my not-very-supportive, all-for-bans-on-international-workers-in-the-interest-of-himself was not (surprise, surprise) very supportive .. and i know i shouldn't have brought up the delicate matter of M, but i was depressed and stressed out, and desperateness overcomes common sense - i laid the trap of marriage and of course was very humiliated and disappointed with the outcome and response ..   "no, im not sure" "i'm sorry, but i don't want to get buyer's remorse" "i cannot be 100% sure if this is what i want" "things are going pretty great, but i don't know if i want this permanently"  KILL ME ALREADY!  now, on top of the depressiveness that wallowed me up on this already crappy monday-blues, i had my boyfriend to thank for, for humiliating me, but ultimately it was my own fault of laying out the trap, and catching myself in it.. =/ i know i can't expect my almost-2-year boyfriend to think other than what he always does, but i thought things were looking up and that there may be some promise over that horizon ..   but once again, i am deluded ... about my job, about my relationship, about my life, pretty much about goddamn everything .. you see why i called myself a 'surrealist-idealist'? i don't belong here, this world isn't mine!!! oh save me, the One who belongs with me ..   and so after a trying morning, i walked out to the bank to deposit my pathetic, measly $200 into my bank account, all the way crying to my one support system - one i can trust will be there to always listen and give the right responses .. and it breaks my heart that that support system isn't my boyfriend - i've always been one to want the other half to be everything in my life, but alas, that doesn't happen in this world we live in - so i turned to my best friend of 7 years ...   thank you sam .. i love you always =) you didn't fix the situation for me, but you made it easier to cope with .. the disappointment, the horrors, the horrible time i have had to contend with .. thank you ..  *sleepsintears*

						   have you realized how treacherous this "blogging" fad is? here we are, trying to pour out our deepest, dankest secrets, for god knows how many millions, billions of people with nothing better to do but read about the lamest things some poor dude did today .. *sigh* what has this world come to? it's pretty pathetic how i have come to this gathering of "bloggers" (who the heck came up with the name anyways?) to tell my story and then reread it to see how lame my life has become ..   and have you realized the color-scheme on yours truly's? wanna know why i picked it? it's because I NEED A FUCKING GREEN CARD!!!! i have decided that maybe, just maybe, if i made the damned site green, it will give me hope (altho all it's doing right now is depressing me since i don't ever think i'm gonna get one of those) .. why can't they just hand the green cards over to hardworking and ever-hopeful person like me? i mean, seriously, can't they tell that i am going to make my contribution to this country as much as the next citizen sitting on the el next to me? if not more probably, considering all the shit i had to get through to bear with this forsaken place .. and why do i even bother half the time?   what the INS dept (or BIS, or watever the fuck they are called these days) need to do is recognize my hardwork, gimme a praise worthy of plaquing-or-two, and hand me over the green card (i wonder if it's really a card, and if it's really green) and say "welcome to the land of the free, now work your hard ass off!"  *hopes*

						   it seems that my conformity is offending some people, so i'm sorry, it wasn't my intention to typify myself to jumping off a bridge when everybody else does it. i'm not saying i would. i'm just trying to extrapolate the time into a much farther than that single moment on the second every body jumps off the bridge, think aeons after that. i'm sure it would be fun wandering off in this world alone but seriously, alone forever and ever and ever? who wants that?  in some ways, yes i am a conformist, but in many ways, i am a rebel. how many people do you know have been apart from their parents for close to a decade? and haven't seen them for almost 3-4 years? how many people do you know packed up their bags and left the known world to venture forth in the scariest and biggest landmass of them all? how many people do YOU know embrace change and adapt to it so flawlessly that it's almost impossible to tell the origin of that person? i don't see that as being a conformist. it's not really being rebellious but it's a pretty gutsy thing to do, don't you think? so no more calling me meek and weak and typifying me into this subclass of humanoid. you aren't god. and you aren't god's gift to man or womankind.  not to burn anybody, i am just stating the obvious.  on another note, i have figured out that stress isn't something that i need to have in my life. and i think i'm getting better at envisioning a single, less tied down life. if before it was a very scary thought, something happened to me on the train yesterday to school, that puts a jolt of life into my very soul and i start to remember again how fun being single could be. yes, you don't have your daily supply of nookie (as sam would put it), but it's the idea of being free and not tied down to any one person's whims, and not having to conform or adapt or somehow put up a wall in defense of another person. and if treated the right way, it could bring me the joy and happiness that would light up my life and bring me close to being ecstatic again. that part of being single is very attractive right now.  sam posted some very nice properties around KLCC area, he has already planned on the furnitures he wants to bring in to MY condo! :p hehe, silly old sam. it's nice to plan, yeah? realize, however, don't rely on plans. or promised words. because you either can misinterpret the meanings, or the person promising can slyly twist their words to mean something slightly different at a later time. and never ever assume. assumptions, i have learnt, are the worst thing you can do when it involves important matters in life. better get it straightened out from the beginning.  i should rest. i told my boss that i am sick and to tell you the truth, what started out as a tiny white lie is starting to become an amazing truth. cheerio and taa.

						   i was thinking about how small this world is last nite, when i found out that two of my team members went to the same high school as my boyfriend. i mean, it's just pretty bogus how that worked out. and i have met so many random people in this life time that i knew back in my previous life time and somehow these people have managed to catch up with me and rattle my world. and the interesting part of this discovery was that team member LOVED that high school and is doing absolutely wonderfully... i guess she was just in the exact opposite end as he was. funny how that works out. i thought about his experiences and he keeps saying that people who do well in high schools are conformists. i did well in high school, does that make me a conformist too? i mean, i LOVED high school, those were some of the best years in my life .. being nominated for everything and anything, and being popular, and loved by many, respected by all. i mean, i guess im a conformist. i just dont think being rebellious all the time has any part in this world. i understand that you should be a rebel at some point or another in your lifetime, like i am now about not wanting to go gome to my parents just yet ... but to be a rebel your entire life? how is that going to make you enjoy life and be successful, especially if this entire world seem to be on the brink of conforming to one set standards?  *shrug*  my ex used to tell me that i shouldnt be jumping off the bridge if everybody else jumps.  frankly speaking, i dont think thats a bad advice, but if EVERYBODY jumps off the bridge besides you, that would make your life pretty empty and lonesome wouldnt it? and wouldnt after a couple of days, months, years, watever, of being totally alone in this big horrible world drive you to jumping off the bridge too? so whats the point of holding back?  i don't understand how people LIKE being alone all the time. i guess im just not programmed that way, i guess interaction is key to my life. too bad my other half somehow doesn't get that.  here's a little interesting exercise for all of you . it hasn't been scientifically proven but i thought it's interesting nevertheless.  squeeze tight your right palm and look at the creases that appears from the end, by your little finger. taking away the creases that result from the folds of your palm and fingers, count the deep etch(es) or deep line(s) that appear. According to my mother, those lines represent the number of lovers you have in your life time. the deeper the line, the more you love that person, and if its a deep long etch, you will end up marrying that person. the lighter etch is just another person in your life that was worthy of real love but not worthy of forever love. we are talking distinct etches or lines here, coz those stand out to be more important.  ok, what's freaky about this entire exercise is that, i have two somewhat deep lines. there are other somewhat lighter streaks but those dont count. of the two deep etches, one is really really deep, and pretty long. the other one started deep but then became lighter and it's not as long as the first one. the freaky part about this is that in my entire lifetime, i've only really loved two man. and since i foresee myself getting married some time in the next 5 years, i don't see myself dating that many men until that time. now which of those two lines will make it to the altar, i dont know. i have a feeling that something weird and bogus will come out of this entire situation. it's pretty disconcerting to only see two deep lines. maybe a third one will develop or something. i wonder if that might happen ... =)  ok well enough blabbering i have a shitload of work to do.

						   so shaz showed me this site, friendsreunited.co.uk, i think, and its basically sorta kinda like a UK version of friendster, except that you have to PAY to receive and send out emails, and to put up pictures, and to post on the board and yada yada yada ... so that part kinda stank, but ... the thing that i am SUPER excited about is the fact that i found almost ALL the people that i grew up with in england, and i know little bits and pieces about their lives ... and it's so freaking awesome to know that, from people you havent heard from in over a decade! i am uber hyped up about this, and am waiting patiently for poncho to reply my email (we, me and shaz, had to guess what his email addy was, and i think we hit the jackpot in guessing, but he still hasnt replied yet, so hopefully it will happen some time soon... )  and as soon as he replies, i am going to use him to get to all the other people that i've lost contact with, seeing that he is mister hathern village and all, and half the people i know live there ...   my ex-ex boyfriend was on the list too .. i wonder what hes doing now and what he is up to and what the heck he looks like .. hopefully he hasnt turned into an ugly wirey thin british boy, like they usually turn out to be .. joanne and sarah both are married (sarah married a TREE surgeon, wtf is that??) and joanne has a baby boy! ahhh .. how freaking WEIRD is that ??? i used to remember sarah, jo and i would strut around limehurst high, with our little friendship bracelets and promising each other that boys are icky and we shall never date them for as long as we shall live .. hehe, oh how stupid was THAT =) it's one of those survival things where you just have to do it whether you fully enjoy it or not .. hehe ...   i think shaz and i will have to make that trip down memory lane some time next year or two... she asked me if i would and i was like, hell yea did you HAVE to ask? i think itd be fun to go back to the place where we both blossomed from awkward infants into somewhat less awkward adolescent. the places that we hung out at, and had lunch and bought candy from old jerry's, walking from the annex to main, and those summers where we stayed in to play SCRABBLE *and learned a bunch of new freaking words that i dont even remember anymore!*, and played the world map, memorizing the capitals of every country .. haha ..   got our first periods, and grew our pairs of boobies ... all happened in england man .. good old england..  i wonder what loughborough looks like now ..

						   *ahhh*  good ole, lazy, bumming around sunday .. wonderfully awesome breezy, mild, cool, drizzly sunday .. i love rainy days, especially ones that come with the mist or the fog .. it somehow brings out the tranquility of this chaotic world ..   in any case, i was just taking a break from my homeworking and the normal stuff that you do on sundays to catch up with life. and i realized, that i spend A LOT of time doing homework and reading. i mean, seriously thing about it. ever since i was, oh, i dont know, as far back as some time in elementary school, i remember having a million homework set due every single day. and thinking back to those strict chinese school teachers back home, with those really, really thin and scary looking "rattan" sticks, not doing your homework will almost always land you in trouble. one wrong answer gets one smack on the butt. although, my 6th grade teacher came up with the weirdest of ideas to punish us "smarter" kids. i probably should describe to you how this went.  in 6th grade, our home room teacher divided the class into 3 groups. i was in group 1 aka the smartest. and being a group 1 member, every time we did anything in class, be it Maths or Malay, or English, or Science, we CANNOT get any wrong answers on any of those in-class exercises. and i mean, NONE! it was good practise i suppose, for those UPSR times, but man, all the pressure and stress that i had to go through to make sure that i didnt get anything wrong ... and if you got something wrong, depending on what group you are in, you got punished differently. my teacher devised this, really sadistic punishment where the "punished" would stand in front of the classroom, bend down, and she would flip up our pinafore-uniforms for a few brief seconds to display to the entire classroom, our cotton panties. mind you, she probably wouldn't have done that if it wasn't an all girls' elementary school, but still .. you weren't allowed to wear shorts underneath those uniforms either, and if you did, you risk the chance of exposing your bare buttocks when she yanks down the shorts together with your panties .. !  among other things she made us do was to walk like a duck across the school field, AND we had to make it look and SOUND like a real duck, sometimes, we had to do it across the front of other classrooms, which was really, really embarrassing.... other times, she would make us put our arms around the big, huge palm trees outside in the school yard, kissing it ... hehe.. oh the good old days...  why are we talking about this anyway? oh yeah ... homeworking and me spending a LOT of time doing it.  *sigh*  i've been a student since 1985. it is now 2004. that's almost two freaking decades! that is like, 90% of my lifetime. my goodness ... didn't realize i've been at this for a while. i guess when you're that good at it, you just keep on doing it without really thinking about it. i wonder if i will go any further with this whole schooling thing.  ok well enuff rumbling. i gotta get back to my ERDs and DFDs. and try to figure out this stupid normalization thing.

						   wow my bf took me to the house of blues to see crystal method in concert, and my-gawd - the entire night was TREMENDOUS! it had started off pretty iffy because i was tired coming home from work and he was tired driving home from being interviewed out in bufu land, and we were both tired from the train ride, and hungry from lack of dinner .. but once we got there, we were chilling ... and to tell you the truth, i cant even really remember half of it coz after a few mike's hard lemonade, i was pretty much buzzing and enjoying myself .. i think i met a few really good looking latina women, and their men-friends, i think someone bought me a drink, can't remember who though (i think it was some guy who tried to pick me up but before he found out i had come with my bf), and then, the fucking music ... omg the music was fucking unbelievable! and the atmosphere, and the people .. everybody was just having fun, including my boy and we both had fun, and his friends came over and had fun, and everybody shouted their names coz they couldnt hear us upon entering the music hall .. the music, the people, the place, the dancing and jumping up and down ... the dancing .. oh i miss the dancing ..   it was freaking awesome ..   i needed that =)

						   so i was cleaning out my booklet of cds and found in there, some of my old skewl cds that i used to listen to alot to remind me of my parents, of home, of certain times and certain people who have been important (in either negative or positive way) in my life .. like, take for example .. MODERN TALKING .. hehe.. for those who dont know what the heck this is, modern talking is some 80s band that my dad loves, and probably still does and we used to travel from Kuantan to KL listening to these kinds of songs .. visiting mom .. those years of long ago .. he used to make us listen to BONEY M too, and after a few rebellious fights about not wanting to listen to some big haired, big braided group of singing weirdos ... we had to succumb to dad's choice simply because it was his car and he was driving .. so that began the whole journey of into dad's head of sing-a-long songs .. =) it makes me smile every time i listen to the two cds, not because i like them, it's because the songs remind me of simpler times of being loved by only your parents and not having to deal with the outside world.  come to think about it, life really was a whole lot simpler then.. i mean yeah ive had crushes and ive rebelled a lot to get to those crushes (countless myriads of british boys in my early teenhood, regardless) but those crushes and so called "first loves" have no bearing upon the two big ones that i have had in my young adulthood. in fact, the first one i had just before this one, seemed a lot simpler than the one i have now .. i dont know what it is, perhaps the fact that im a certain awkward age and that i have been burned down once, or perhaps that we are living together, makes it feel a whole lot more ... not burdensome, but weighs a whole lot more.e  simpler times of puppy love reminds me of whitney houston songs .. omg .. i used to come home after school (go Limehurst High!) at the age of 13, dream about a certain hazel-eyed, brunette young man by the name of Paul R. and wish he would stop staring at my fair haired best friend, Sarah and concentrate on the more awkward looking, trying to blend in Malaysian girl, who just started school ..   then there was Stuart F., my first "real" boyfriend, age 14. haha, this one is funny .. i had to try going out with him three times before i could settle down with the idea that we are a couple.. it just seemed so wrong, and he was such a scrawny blonde haired, blue eyed, true Aryan boy... i have him to thank for, for the many kissing moves that i have .. haha.. as if i had more than one :p   then there were those hunks that didn't quite look like hunks when they were in junior high but at the end of junior high into middle school, blossomed into the hunkiest of all hunks .. i shared my fantasy and dreams with one of my best friends from england, because we BOTH liked this guy (if you are reading this and recognize who you are, remember those times? when we drooled and fought on who should sit next to him on the bus? hehe) ... the boy in question is no other than Andrew P., also known as PONCHO (dont ask, i dont know)... i remembered in 8th grade, he used to sit across from me in MISSUS MADDOCK's class in Maths, and stare at me and try to get my attention in so many ways .. even Graham said he had a crush on me, but Ponch was such an awkward kid back then.. his hair wasn't properly cut, and he just had a whole lot of baby fat on him still, hehe we used to pinch his love handles to drive him mad ..   .... and THEN ....  come 9th grade, he freaking turned into a HOTTIE .. and not to mention 10th grade in Burleigh Comm. College, he was like, wreaking fermones or sth and all these girls would flock to him, sighing and swooning .. it was kinda cute .. at that time though, i had other crushes already, too many to even list down here .. they were all white boys, needless to say (i think i like my white men, what can i say) .. lets see shall we .. if i listed them all you will die of shock but this is quite fun to reminisce:  1. Paul Rycroft 2. Stuart Freer 3. i think i kinda like Adam Freer too, hehe 4. Andrew Pycroft 5. Mark Adkin 6. Adam Fairweather (more Shazz's thing but he was damned cute) 7. Adam Roper 8. Johnny sth, couldnt remember his last name 9. Lee .. err ... sth he was cute but he became my best friend for a whilee 10. Nikki sth, i just thought he was adorable, but like, about a foot shorter than i was hehe  those are the only ones i remember .. mind you the only one i dated out of all of those crushes was Stuart, for like, 6 months or something, i think, before he dumped me to go after my best friend .. i swear, all the dumpings have been painful for me .. but watever ...   then i came home, and had crushes on a few malay men, but gave up on those and came back to the US to get me another hot white american .. well, after i got me a somewhat decent looking malaysian men who claims to be a chicagoan (hehe just kidding!!! you are oh-so-hot! :p)  ROFL  alrite, time for me to leave this playground and go to another one, that is ASP.NET... *sigh* i wish my prof could speak real english, his sounds too guttural to be understood properly.

						   *yawn* man, i am EXHAUSTED  ... i have had waay too much drama and stress to thank for, and i think i am about ready to drop and start over again ... but i am feeling a little better, thanks for asking =) still sux, but i suppose i can deal ..   i found out that it was my boss' bday yesterday - the one day that he called me in to work when i wasn't supposed to work .. it was kinda hard to be nice to him when i was wishing to not be there, i mean, seriously, how can he expect me to drop school and work.. for god's sakes, im only an intern who isnt supposed to work more than 20 hours and not even being paid for the extra time that i come in! it's ridiculous .. but i can't be mad at him for too long - he is nice coz he has hooked me up with a big, geeky IT project for the summer with one of the guys down in the basement .. gotta love him for that ..  better brush up on my geek-lingo and open up my geek-dictionary (oh wait, i can just ask my bf - thats probably easier)  i am counting on one of my gay friends to pull through with the apartment thing for next year, if i need to move .. i hope that it will happen fine, coz he said he isnt too sure yet .. otherwise im pretty much screwed .. wouldnt know what to do coz i really really dont want to move in with random strangers ...   ok, this blog sux, i am not creative right now .. will chat later.

						   i hate goodie-goodie (or watever they are called) people who tell me that things will be fine.. if i really thought things were going to be OK, i wouldn't have whined and bitched and complained. i would have smiled happily and moved on with things. and yes, in the greater scheme of things, it will be fine. it will be OK. and what the heck does THAT term mean anyway - it will be "O-K"? who are YOU trying to tell ME that things will be OK based on MY POINT OF VIEW!  argh!!  i may be over dramatizing things, and i may not be one of those "grateful", "unwhiney" people who accept things the way they are - that's because I LIKE to have control over my life, i LIKE to know for certain that things are going to be MY way, I DONT CARE THAT IT ISNT HOW LIFE WORKS, and YES.. i KNOW it will come and haunt me and hurt me because i dont listen to you ...   but for now .. fuck it! i am going to WHINE and BITCH and COMPLAIN my way through ... and when i am done, i will look for the "grateful", "optimistic", "live life, love life" perspective, ok? till then - can it.

						   all joy has been sucked out of me.. this is it fellas - this is the big change that i have been dreading and it's so close to knocking on my door, and all i want to do is run away.. run far far away into the oblivion, where it's peaceful and happy, everything stays the same way, always. where my comfort and familiar zone doesn't ever need to expand, or shrink, and where my joyfulness doesn't have to dim or be cast away into the long and lonely island of no man's land.  i feel like .. all the happiness in me was sucked out with a vacuum cleaner.  why can't i be looking forward to this change like he is? why can't i just, be ecstatic with the change? why must i feel this way? it's because i am being left behind. while life is going to improve for him, mine is going to stay the same way, MINUS him, so in essence, it's going to be worsen. i am sure i am being all melodramatic about this, and come time, i am sure i will be able to face the rhythm but right now, all i want to do is curl up in a ball while chaining him to my waist, and hide under my blanket, and never come out to face the grimness that is this situation.   how am i going to make it through this week?

						   omg my 3 hour class is killing me. i'm sitting in it right now wanting to leave. i miss my baby and am dreading the hw awaiting me...  so today was seemingly ok. so, i have nothing to bitch about really.. well i do, but you've all heard it before ....  i've realized that i need to appreciate more of life and the ppl who surround me, especially those who love me.

						   oh-no, oh-no, oh-no!  sadness and fear of being alone without my loved one has crept into my heart and the pit of my stomach, and i feel.. well, at a goddamn lost! it's the same feeling that i got a few years back, torturous, slow and painful sadness, and i am feeling somewhat drained out right now. the reality of things that may come to be is starting to sink in, my stomach churns every time i think of the prospects of being without him, and it makes me fear the coming months, and it makes me sad, thinking that this summer i could be without him. what i fear the most is the lost dependency, the simple things that have kept us going for this long, how i am going to miss his smell and his touch, and the easiness of welcoming that hug or that spank, that sparkle in his eyes when he tries to steal kisses and his big, huge warm embrace. how i will miss the buying of toothpaste so we can share it in the bathroom, the meals that we eat together, the nights where we would talk forever before actually falling asleep, ruffling his warm, chest and relishing in the sounds of his soft breathing, and waking up to that beautiful supernova-colored eyes and charming, dimpled smile ...  please don't go .. =(

						   man, i was so stressed out and frustrated, it made my allergies and sickness come back! i was not able to breathe, eat (everything tasted like chalk), and my eyes started to collect gunk in the tearducts, i can barely see anything. thanks alot for stressing me out!!!!  but that aside, i need to stop being so irrational and emotionally freaked out because it's annoying even myself. i have to just accept things the way they are and make the best of whatever i have left. it is hard to be optimistic in times like these, but i suppose the higher power knows what's best for me, and maybe this might turn out to be a good thing overall. maybe if things go well, it might progress in other directions in my life that i had forgotten to turn towards in the midst of all this chaos. it may just be possible things may get better with distance, who knows.   but like i said, i can't let this get to me. it's not the end of the world, he is right. it was a good journey, great experience, and will always get a special spot in all my special memories box. just like everything else that was a good and interesting experience, even bad ones, get a slot in the memory box. i think i just treasure memories. everything seemingly bad now, may look like flowers in the next few years.  think good thoughts, think good thoughts ..

						   yea. i guess i won't have to worry about not being lazy to actually STIMULATE the life changing event. a life changing event will happen without me having to lift a finger. and as hard as i try to stay optimistic about this entire thing, i find it hard to not be real about it. there is no way this is going to last. i can list a few reasons, and you can fill the rest in:  1. even together, nothing feels stabiliized. there is no stabilizer here. 2. what makes you think that being away from each other is going to help with the stability? 3. why would ANYBODY come down 100miles to see someone they don't even care to like? (by this i mean, what incentive do you have, especially being incompatible) 4. even if things go on fine, being apart, what is the point? there is no permanence. i seek permanence. i seek stability. in case you haven't noticed, i'm a big fan of the future. i worry about it. i plan it. my entire present life revolves around what hope i hold on to for the future. if the future thread of hope is gone, why should i hang on to the present? give me a good reason to do it. anything.  i hate to admit it. this routine was the worst thing i could have gotten used to. it's so bad for me, for everybody. it makes us all forget the bigger picture. and the fact that i had jumped right into it from the beginning, without giving it much thought, made it worse. i should have weighed my options, figured out the difficulties, learned to rationalize that things don't last forever. but i clinged on to my hopes. i was stupid. i think i'll always be stupid when hope comes to play, but man, what a bad time to be making mistakes. again, right as i approach the summer of the year before i graduate. am i seeing a pattern again? am i going to go through another 3 summer months, crying over a broken heart?  please. no more of that. i cannot take it. i cannot handle it. i've already been broken. once was enough. why do i put myself through this? what path did i choose, that make this all seemingly wrong. this entire picture, this whole situation, doesn't fit anymore. with the advent of impermanence, i seek to stabilize other parts of my life, and i don't see the point anymore. why bother. why linger. why must i stay here anymore? what is the point - damage is done. now my entire future needs to be repatternized. nothing will ever smell so sweet or feel so clean.  i need to break away. before i go insane.

						   ok, i really need to stop watching the swan. that tv show makes me want to go through bizarre stuff to get to the body i want. i know i will probably chicken out of the liposuction part, but they get personal trainers and dieticians working on their side too - those i can deal with. the lipo part, if it didn't look so gory i may want to try it out ...   *sigh*  oh well - live with it i guess. it's not like i don't go to the gym. i do. and it makes me feel good. but i think gym alone isn't going to be enough. i feel like i should be at a size 2 or 4 before i can make my man (and a sleuth of other people, not naming any names) ecstatic. sad, real sad ..

						   my outlook on life has improved a little in the past few days. i am beginning to accept many things in life that i never thought i could. and it's been quite trying to do the little adjustments here and there, but i think i can face whatever that may come my way. if i can get through what i went through and have been through in the past few years, i think i should be able to sail right through these next few years.  i hope in the end i will end up in a better place ..

						   ******  R: u see, the only option is to talk to him and ask him to change or u better break up with him I: i cant ask him too change and im too lazy for a life changing event right now such as a break up  R: so u know the only choice that u have then. accept ur fate or leave. just hope that by the time u realized that u won't be permanently damaged I: why do i have to do anything right now. im alrady permanently damaged R: U ARE? I: i have life and [the situation 2 years ago] to thank for. if you only knew how bad it was, you would understand. i lived life in fear R: well, u have a very good way of hiding em then. a good façade I: im usually fine but i get depressed easier now compared to before. before, i dont even remember being depressed. if before, being depressed was not getting an A in my classes, afterwards, it was the fear of men breaking my heart. R: do u think it's a phase thing? I: who knows, maybe. what didnt break me, makes me stronger. and i learnt from it  R: well, nice way of saying it. but in the process u might just change I: oh of course. you cant expect a significant event like that not change you. you just gotta learn from it i spose. and make sure we dont repeat the same mistakes. right now, im not repeating the same mistake. im just making a new one ....  *******

						   you know, the more i sit down and think about my relationship-life from past to present, the more i realize how much like shit i've been treated. even though the shit-treating part isn't the ONLY part of my relationships, it's true that the only times you really remember are the times when the one you love(d) so much have hurt you ... i almost wish i had started this blog when i was 21, way back when i deeply hurt and scarred, and i dare say, for life. granted the fact that i am over the boy, and that we are best friends now, the fact of the matter remains - remnants of scars are prevalent in how i deal with myself and how i view myself since then. if before i was a vibrant, extremely optimistic person, perhaps living in an idealistic world, now i am less vibrant, a little more pessimistic (some might call is realistic) and all the idealism seem surrealistic. nothing that good should happen to someone. at least, after the event, i seem to have been thrusted into a world where good things happen to everyone but myself, the undeserving fool who dared to love. it's pretty funny how i still feel that way even with the new boyfriend - but it doesn't feel like i've completely recuperated. i could've .. but i don't think i chose the right person to have depended on so much for support to completely pull myself out of this scarred place (and perhaps because HE too is a scarred and scared puppy himself, the two of us seem to have fallen deep into the vortex of complete dependency of each other, giving up the chance to haul one another out of the trenches of despair)  i don't know where i have gone wrong, which path i seem to have missed and how i ended up not correcting that mistake. maybe it's the hope that this new man in my life can use me as a stepping stool to haul himself out of miserable-dom, hence lifting me up with him too. maybe it's the hope that i can love and live the life i used to live, devoid of pain, anger, bitterness, and cynicism. it's definitely a life experience - and i hate to accept that i have been completely changed by it. in some ways it has made me a better person, in that i don't expect people to do anything for me anymore. yet in some secret way, i had hoped that perhaps with the meeting of new people, some man out there can afford to give me his all, utterly selfishly and dotingly. i don't expect 24-7 doting, but a lot of support, the balancing act of one another, in times of need and in times of yearning, would surface without the begging of it.   alas, i have somehow missed that path and chosen a more prickly thorned life. shouldn't complain - i am loved. but is love alone enough? it's a constant debate going on in my head - can i really sit quietly on love and not expect friendship? if once upon a time i use love and friendship interchangeably, i stand to amend that notion, because you can have love without friendship. and i cry in my sleep, wishing there are ways to fix it, that there are ways that perhaps, i can better myself to fit the description of "friend" to him, or vice versa. it just isn't doable.  and i suppose that alone, is a good enough reason to not live together forever.   it would be a very lonely journey to eternity, otherwise....

						   my bf got his evo last night. i'm glad the whole ordeal is over - if it hadn't gone the way it went last night, i wouldn't know what to do with him. it would be pretty much your hell advanced class (i'm already learning the basic hell 101 right now, so enough already as it is!)

						   hmm ..   i just saw fox's new reality show called "the swan" - interesting beauty pageant. the premise of the show is to pick 2 overweight, average/ugly looking women and transform them into skinnier and prettier looking beings. while the idea is kinda, well, grotesque, because the ladies are undergoing all these plastic surgeries and liposuctions and therapies all in one go, in three months nonetheless, i find myself wishing i was one of the contestants. i would LOVE to undergo free lipo and personal training to get up in my shapeliness. i have been wanting to lose weight since, like, oh i dunno, - 14, and now that im 24, i still haven't quite lived up to that goal weight - 115lbs. it's quite hard to get down to that once you've surpassed a certain weight, and by that time you are just glad you aren't putting any more on.  i think i need to take another vow - to get down to at least 120lbs.   *phew*  that is going to be ... a lot of challenge since i get tempted with food all the time! i mean, ok, fine - to get down to that weight isn't too bad coz i'm not too far from it, but still ... it's just so much harder when you aren't depressed, like REALLY depressed.... i lost a lot of lbs when i got dumped from my 4 year boyfriend, and was close to 110lbs. i was crying an entire summer though, on top of not eating and working out relentlessly every day to rid myself of bad memories, and i don't think i want to go through another traumatic experience like that.  oh well - stop sayin' start doin' right =)

						   you know, i say i am inundated with all these project works and yet i still blog faithfully. what did i tell ya about blogging and praying, this is my way to repent and absolve my sins. i hope god is listening to me via the Internet. hehe. i swear ... if praying was more fun i would do it more often...  anyway, i spoke to a friend of mine who is basically working for two or three companies downtown here, and he is THE IT department for those companies (they're law firms and securities, and know NOTHING about computers) and he makes $75/hr for hooking up networks! i mean seriously - there is SO much money in networking and securities, and i almost wish i had the desire to do more work like that. but alas, i don't like to pretend like i know networking stuff, coz i don't, and i don't like to work on my own, all alone, and what's more to be THE IT department of an entire organization. it's kinda scary, and extremely geeky. i don't know why my boss is trying so hard to save me from the geek-society, coz i am so not one! fine, i'm not your typical dumb-blonde, party-hardy, nor do i LOOK like ms. suave paris "who-has-it-all-worked-out-for-her-now-let's-flaunt-some-legs" hilton (and trust me, our relationship is one of the love-hate kind) - but i sure am NOT one of those "closed-up-stare-at-neon-lights-radiating-from-green-computer-monitors" kind either.  to tell you the truth - i'm not sure if i BELONG to any organization, race, clique, types, etcera etcera.  what i should do is start up a fasha-fan club, cept i think i may be the only member =/ sooo saddd ... hehe, oh no wait - i think i'll drag my best friend, sam into it, he can be the vice president and we can smoke hashis all night long - aight sammie? =)  i took a vow - i have decided to give up on pessimism and live up more to optimism. i don't care if i am stuck in my lala land and my head will either be up in cloud-99 or down in the sand with those animals that stick their heads in the sand (ostrich is it?) ... i think we all need to escape this world of cruel realities, and enjoy a better, albeit imagined, world up in your head. and i bet you if everybody in this world did that, this world would be a better and happier place.   but since i can't make everybody do it - i am going to do it myself and rally my friends, families, and loved ones to join me - so if the world can't enjoy the happy-zone that i plan to create for myself, i can at least establish a nice, comfort arena, whereby the people i interact with on a daily basis will join me in this vibrant, positive energy!   COME ON GUYS - SIGN MY PETITION IN MY COMMENT BOOK =) !!!

						   you know what - i know that people say that you get more bitter and cycnical as you get older, but i should really start to realize that it's a pretty pathetic way to live your life. i mean great sarcastic cynicism is allowed up to a certain degree, but i am not going to live my already shortened life pining and worrying about things that may or may not be.  and that includes marriage. as i told my boyfriend last nite how i plan to live the last 5 years of my 20's, i realized how utterly ridiculous i sounded and i can't expect my life to actually turn out that way. i mean seriously - i planned plenty when i was younger, not necessarily keeping tabs or score cards on how well i did or if i achieved those goals, but i still made those plans, and they aren't nearly half way done! what i told my bf last nite was this (in reference to our, or rather, MY dilemma about a certain issue):  a. i want to get engaged around 27 b. i plan to settle down with a husband in a house and a nice job by 28, 29 c. and make babies by 29, 30  ok, a - not gonna happen, and b - i don't even KNOW how i came up with those numbers! i think i am just so ... influenced by the society, or rather, the society that i know of, the culture of women and men getting married around my age. and seriously, you cannot blame me for freaking out and panicking - half my friends who came with me on the same boat in search of wisdom in the American shores, have already settled down with husbands and wives. and the one here, already have TWO kids, and he is the same age as i am! so yeah-pressure on all sides and angles, makes me go crazy, apparently.  you have to understand - i am very maternal. everything i do can be translated into some maternal kinda mannerism and instinct. ok well - maybe not but i have a certain maternal touch inside of me and i don't know why it does this, but every time i am with someone for quite a long time, the instincts tend to surface. whats funny is this: sam gave me the same response after a year and a half or so, and i am getting it again now. it seems like history is repeating itself, so maybe this one will last 4 years too - so i have 3 years to go i spose, if history truly will repeat itself.  to cut story short - i REFUSE to not enjoy life now. i REFUSE to not cherish every moment i get with him. and who knows, maybe i will either realize and fully accept the incompatibilities graciously without making a big deal or maybe i may be surprised with better news. who knows, but that is the key - NOBODY knows. you can only decide and plan and make up timelines and in the end, if you are meant to be, you are.  if i am meant to stay in this country, i will. if i am meant to go home and rekindle hot love and romance, so be it.  but the point of the matter is this - i love my life. and i love how i have turned out to be a pretty decent person with an exceptional brain capabilities to do really well and excel at what i do. i know how to love passionately, and i know what it's like to be loved. i can ask for more, and i know that i want to keep love forever, but i won't force it and i won't assume it, and i won't expect it.   i resign to fate.

						   this always happens to me - i was promised an event or an outing and it never happens. and almost always, the promised event or outing is planned on either friday or saturday nite, so by the time the event or outing gets cancelled, i end up having nothing else to do, and therefore i get stuck sitting at home doing what, you ask me? homework ... work ... and some other pathetic thing that is not even worth mentioning here.  i give up.  i give up making plans or trying to make plans. because:  a. i don't have anybody to do it with, at least nobody reliable b. my plans don't seem to fit other people's idea of "fun" c. even if i MADE plans, and people seem to WANT to do something with me, they will cancel on me last minute anyway, for the stupidest of reasons  so what's the point. i will stop relying on other people for event planning. i hate being so isolated and secluded. i don't even talk to anybody anymore. it feels like i have somehow swirled down some lonesome vortex of abandonment and isolation. against my will, and without my control.   the more i think about it, the less i want to live my days. life makes sense (OR doesn't make sense, depending on how you view it) when you look backwards. too bad you are living forwards.

						   why-o-why am i affected by pollen and dander, and god knows what else that is seriously bugging my vision, my olfactory senses, and my stupid hearing ... =/ i've been in this country too long, i'm starting to pick up the allergies too ... i wasn't always allergic to the month of april - when i first came here, i wasn't affected by anything. this allergy thing started a few years ago - the first year it happened, my room overlooked some cherry tree with a ton of blossoms, so you can imagine all the pollen THAT tree released in april .. who would've thought that something so pretty can be so deadly .. but that's how everything is these days - you can never trust a pretty looking object. it almost always bites.  anyhow, i went to work today *yes, on saturday* (if you can call it that. work is usually tied to being paid, and hating your boss. in my case, i am not getting paid and i actually like my boss, at least this one) i did my work and while waiting for mike to get done, i passed out on the carpetted floor of one of the office rooms. i must be that tired. i don't know why - it must be the bug or the flu or the allegies, or all of the above.  i have nothing interesting to contribute today - so i'm going now. i need to analyze my work. i'll get back to you on that some time.  peace.

						   bosses, especially old ones, think that the world revolves around them. they think that since they've elevated themselves to that level of superiority and the graying hair is proof to the world that they are distinguished and wise, they expect everyone to drop everything to cater to their whimsical needs, which aren't even that important. and i think that these old fools need to wake up and smell the coffee with the rest of the world - you ain't that important, you old bag of bones! if we think you've outdone yourself, we WILL take an axe to your wrinkly hands and lop your fingers off to quieten the incessant phone calls to our desks every 10 minutes. and we WILL pull out your droopy tongue and staple it to that memo that you love so dearly ...   sheesh .. what a day!!  you can tell my weekend is off to a good start .. i am glad it's friday, coz i can rest in peace and nobody will be calling me every 10 minutes so that i can adjust a certain someone's posture and wipe a certain someone's nose because that certain someone cannot do it. i know, i should feel a certain amount of compassion but i'm really pissed right now, so i don't care... quadriplegic or not, he has no right to be telling me what to do with my fridays ..   so what did you guys do today?

						   the human body is remarkably resilient - you could take a pin needle to it and poke it in so many different ways, FEEL the pain either briefly or for a few minutes, and then adapt to the pain and brave a few more pricks .. well, i was poked and pricked today, on the dentist chair, with a collection of pricking metal looking things, and another set of drills and shockers to scare my plaque and deposits away from my wonderfully white teeth ..  --oh_my_gawd--!  and i thought root canal was bad (well actually i didn't .. i had fun watching the dentist drilling a huge gaping hole into my molar tooth, and yanked out all the nerves from inside, then POURED hot wax/gold/ or watever the fuck they poured into that hole, then COVERED it with filling, to be crowned later on .. total cost of root canal and crowning of one tooth - $1400 ... cost of keeping your tooth your own and healthy - PRICELESS!)  why would you put yourself under all this torture and pain?? ok, fine fine, if you didn't go for your check ups every 6 months, like i have failed to do since i am a cheapskate student who would much rather spend $150 on my textbooks than a dentist (and believe me, i did it very, very grudgingly) .... but to cut the story short (coz dentist stories are gross, and i don't know why ANYBODY would want to become a dentist to poke and prick into someone's mouth - maybe just for the pure pleasure of seeing your patient's discomfort, perhaps - and that is pretty sadistic) .... i got my teeth cleaned, x-rayed, and polished until they're completely and utterly "sauber"ishly C-L-E-A-N.  now i have to maintain the cleanliness ...   *flosses*

						   to those of you who were looking for me this past weekend -- im sorry i sorta left and didnt leave notice .. i totally forgot! heheh .. mike took me to some cabin out in the middle of nowhere in wisconsin .. some friend of his has a 5 bedroom cabin with a real nice manmade pond and fishies swimming inside .. real cute .. bonfire was real nice too .. cant speak too much about the company though .. im not a big fan of ugly, fat people who talk about cars and computers 24-7 and make jokes off off something they found on the internet .. nor am i interested with the collection of girls that were present .. they were either very, "homey" coz they are married, or unbelievably "slutty/ditsy" ... lately, i have found it really hard to keep an interest in things that other people around me do .. like, i find car things boring, computer talk gibberish, game/board/poker playing stupid, random hanging out a waste of time ... i dont know what is wrong with me, but all the free time i have i seem to not care about hanging out or doing things most people consider a "hobby" .. instead, i find myself thinking about how to advance myself in life/career/studies .. its pretty sad ..   so anyways, i kinda hung out on my own and enjoyed resting my brain, after a week of torturous pain and relentless stress .. the bonfire is very very hypnotizing and it makes you think and realize horrible things about yourself and/or your life (thats how i realized that i couldnt care less about the people around me or the things they do that is sposedly fun) weather WHILE we were there was fine, but it was pouring like cows and buffaloes all day today, kinda reminds me of home and monsoon season, when i would sit in my balcony, staring out at the lightning and listening to the thunder, savoring the cooler, milder weather ...   speaking of home..   my brother starts college today! he has opted for the matriculation course, and will be going on to an architectural degree in a year.. when asked why he doesnt want to do engineering, he said "engineering degree is a sell out degree, everybodys doing it and he wants to be different!"  haha, oh good old brother .. his nonchalance and indifference to whichever college he goes to and whatever path he takes is very alarming, and unnerving! instead of him worrying about his future, i ended up having to do it for him since he obviously is too cool to worry .. glad he has paved his way fine, now all we gotta do is wait and see how he dose =)

						   happy 50th to my mom, first of all!! wow, can't believe she turned 50 and even more freakily, i will be turning 25 not too long from now ... ahhhhh!!!! kinda creepy ... *brr* the coming of age is just not very attractive right now, and the more i think about it, the less attractive it becomes, but heck, watever .. plenty of time to live my dreams of becoming a harlot extraordinaire ..   secondly .. i got a $10 magazine from some guy sitting next to me on the el .. it was kinda funny how it happened .. i was on my way to the gym and this dude (who smelled of flowers or some kinda really gorgeous smelling musk) sat next to me .. he aint all that cute to look at, but he sure dressed nice and im pretty sure he is gay too, but what do i know .. i aint gay .. but anyways, he had this really cool looking magazine with him that he set on an empty seat in front of us .. i didnt think much of it at first because it was just a magazine and it had a tomboyish kiersten dunst on the cover .. THEN, i looked at the title of the magazine (it's called "dazed and confused") and you see, one of my friends nickname is "dazed and confused" (ok granted she changes it every so often, but i have come to remember her with this nickname) so that caught my attention, and i asked this guy if this magazine was local or not ..  now .. being the fact that he looked good, smelled good, and carried a european-esque magazine around like that, i was half expecting a british accent to pop out of his thin delicate mouth, but all i heard was a flaming (excuse my gay) american accent, and i almost laughed my head off .. and what's even funnier, he said he just came out of the navy (hehe, boy the navy sure did this one wrong) and bought the magazine to read on the train back home, and since he has had it with him for two entire days, i can have it ..   haha, i didnt really want it, really, but i took it anyways, since otherwise i wouldve laughed my head off and he wouldve wondered why .. thank god the next stop was fullerton, so off i went, grinning like a cheshire cat ..  one good thing -- the magazine smells like that musk he wore, so my entire way to and from the gym, i smelt somewhat nice (altho, combined with my sweat from an arduous work out, i doubt the flowery smell wouldve done me any good)....   that was my spiele for the day .. now i need to get back to my SQL querying on my Oracle9i database......   *sigh*

						   it never fails to amaze me how differently men and women think, act and respond to different situations. i was watching that 70's show today (and yes, yet another rerun and god knows how i managed to miss this part last time, or not give it that much thought) .. and it's the one where jackie's dad was sent to jail and she didn't get the right comfort from hyde - well eric told hyde to give jackie space whereas donna told hyde to console her and talk to her ... and then eric said "well, if jackie jumps out of the plane, he should go to her and jump out too?", to which donna said "at least they will be together!"  haha .. funny how true that is, and we don't really realize the mechanism that drives men's and women's instincts. while men are very territorial about their space and cave-like in their nature, women are very, obsessed with togetherness and peace-loving ideals.  mom used to tell me that if i ever find myself in a situation where an argument is taking place, the key thing to do is to not push the guy as he "retreats" into his cave. of course, i never ever listen to her and push the matter further until the poor guy wouldn't want to see or talk to me for a while .. (it's not like she practices what she preaches anyways, i think my mom is even worse than i am) sometimes, i wonder why god would make two very different types of people compatible for mating and life. it just makes no sense. i guess it keeps things interesting.  i used to get these bouts of .. weird states when i would see all men and women as one sex, or as no sex, as in, i am the same as the next man, who is the same as the next woman kinda spiele. as in, the key physical difference between men and women just don't exist and we are one of the same kind. kinda like mannequins in the "down there" part =) i duno why it comes and goes like that, these bouts, but whenever it happens, for a brief second, it feels nice to not feel inferior or intimidated or so aware of the gap that lies between men and women. i think one can sit and analyze the men and women in this world for an eternity and the so called pattern that they think they have uncovered to define them would not even begin to describe the tiniest bit of truth that lies herein the nature of these beasts. that pattern changes with time and with time, more complex behavioral patterns emerge and you are stuck analyzing a whole new set for a whole new generation.  oh, men and women ... what wouldn't i do to not be either one of you =)  in any case, brief update of this wonderful harlot in training:-  1. i have been invited to some celebration of excellent (apparently im receiving an award for either winning a scholarship/research competitions and for my service to the school as leaders of student organization) not sure which, im guessing the latter  2. my internship with the city ends end of this summer because i have used up all my CPT and am not allowed to continue with it unless i sign up with OPT and i really dont want to do that  3. there might be a possibility for a research internship for me in the fall (depending on the professor that i approach, i could get myself into some really awesome work!)  4. i was approached by some company in kansas city to work as a java developer (and i duno if i want it or not)  5. i realize that i really shouldnt be babbling on here any longer since i have a lot of work to do and a multitude of presentations to work on... so ciao for now

						   i am debating whether i should apply for another internship position because i am not quite getting the experience i want with the one i currently have. well, my boss said i will be exposed to more tech work this summer, so i suppose i should wait and be patient. but at the same time, god, i hate him sooo much! he is everything top management should not be: arrogant, despicable, and hopeless.  but whatever. i can deal. the money isnt too bad (although i could do much better but am just not sure how to go about asking for a raise). maybe i should just charge them more or something. stupid people.  bleh

						   i just got done reading Jennifer Government by Maxx Barry - I urge everyone to read that book. it's freakin' great. i also just got done reading the Confessor by Daniel Silva and have taken a liking to how he writes and the topic. without giving it away, it's about terrorism, the Holocaust, and the Vatican's secrets. pretty neat - two more in line by the same author are the Kill Artist and the English Assassin. same protagonist. i think one of them has something to do with Yaser Arafat. i think. hehe.

						   hmm...  i swear, sometimes, i am the most ungrateful person alive. it's this desire to want something to be perfect, the way i want it to be - it's the yearning to have what others want and always looking at what THEY have and wishing I had it. it's a terrible characteristic trait to possess and i wish that i didn't have it. and i don't know whether i should take it to mean that i need to work harder and make my life that much better so i will stop comparing and wishing .. or i should just wake up and realize that i have plenty and not bitch or yearn for something that i already have, but possess it so in a different way.  it's such a tough thing to do, to just read about somebody's life somewhere, and then not wish that i was living that life. i feel like i'm not living my potential here, maybe that is why i keep comparing and wishing i had more. i feel quite stagnated and quite obligated to bitch about it because it somehow keeps me going on and searching for something more. and to think about it, i don't think i have ever found a job that i was quite happy and content with. i have always had something to complain about.   - "it's too much work.." - "it's too much strategizing.." - "it's NOT enough work .." - "oh wait, i really am not working .." - "i'm not being paid for this work.." - "i am not being given the opportunity to work with others.." - "i have TOO much work with other incompetent people.."  ugh.  when will this neverending cycle of wishing for things other people have stop???!! and when will i find that one perfect job that will make me happy and not look elsewhere? i've realized today that i can be very loyal in a really long relationship - but i can't seem to translate that loyalty to my work place.   .. and yes, i am beginning to hate my boss and my work place. if only he would stop being such a dictator and a whiney bastard, and if only he would give me more technical work that relates to my particular needs to improve and populate this big brain of mine, then i am happy.  and to illustrate why my boss is whiney and bossy, here's an example how:  so i went to work, and he told me to email a few people for him, while he sits and dictates to me (yea, this is what my master's degree is for - being a freaking stenographer!) .. if you don't remember, my boss is quadriplegic and he uses this special headphone/microphone amplifier to make and receive phone calls. so apparently, this device isn't to his liking because people can't really hear him too well - he can hear them fine but they can barely hear him. so he asked some tech support people to help him out and order a new telephony device. fair enough - after all that is what tech support is supposed to do.  so the new device came in, and they hooked it up, had me test it and everything was fine. but when he tried it, people still couldn't hear him, and so he went and looked for his old friend who specializes in devices for disabled people, as a contact for the tech support. he emailed the tech support boss this contact person's info, and expects the entire department to drop everything to come and help him, because god forbid that people should disobey his request and put him on the back burner. so, what happened was this.  the tech support boss emailed him back, and politely said that they will put his request on a list of projects but it isn't of high priority right now because they have this PC deployment project to work on for the next couple of days. and that they will get back to him when they are done.  fair enough right?  well my almighty boss thinks that these people are discriminating him because he is disabled, and then he wrote them back an email stating that in a lot of words, beating around the bush, while not outrightly saying it. and he told me that if the boss of this tech support department won't oblige to his request, he will go directly to the CIO and complain.  OMG!!!   what is this - THIRD FUCKING GRADE??!!! jesus fucking christ!   i mean, seriously. i understand that he has a need but my gawd!!! i seriously, for an entire hour, want to punch the lights out of my boss - which would be terrible since he is already disabled, but i HATE top management so much - especially ones who think that they need to be treated differently and specially because they are disabled. you shouldn't get that kinda treatment so blatantly like that. yes, you should get a little bit more attention because you do need help with the things that other human beings take for granted, but this was just out of line. and i HATE how he calls his "beating around the bush", "strategizing" .. because it isn't. he is just so full of SHIT and it stinks ..  maybe i am just not well versed yet with the corporate/government world. maybe this is what people do - people bitch and complain and write emails like they were in third grade, fighting over who gets to play in the freaking sandbox or who gets first dibs on the candy box Missus Smith brought to class today.  now, do you understand the frustration? how i wish i was working alone in my own cubicle, and not at the foot of my stupid boss???

						   i noticed something uncanny about my relationship behavior today. when i was with sam, used to get told off for not listening to him during conversations, it doesnt have to be a real deep conversation, most of the times its silly daily talk, like what he wanted to eat for dinner or when i was supposed to meet up with him, or how i was supposed to do something. and what usually happened is:-  1. he would stand in front of me  2. he would then say something pertinent (but most of the time, its usually impertinent) 3. i would stare at him, nod and say i understand or i hear it, or i dont say anything 4. 10 seconds later, i would ask the same question he just answered based on some made up assumption i had in my head (and i swear, people, i DONT KNOW where they come from! perhaps from some other lifetime) and i would either receive:      a. a repetition of what he just said and nothing    b. a repetition of what he just said and a huge unbelievable stare    c. a repetition of what he just said and a scolding for not paying attention, or    d. no repetition and a LOT of scolding.  and what usually happened was that i would receive a lot of D's.  you would think that these kinds of habit and behavior would die off with one relationship but somehow it got translated to another relationship, in this case, the one now, current and present. the FUNNY part about this entire thing is that instead of the simulated situation above, what would happen is this:  1. he says something on the AIM chat screen 2. i would reply to that something, and ask him a question 3. he responds 4. 10 seconds later i would ask the same question or make up some answer that i somehow assumed to be true (same reasoning as above, no clue how this could possibly happen). i would receive:     a. a direct "read up 10 lines to what i said previously..."  thats it. hehe. this one is pretty direct. but its hilarious how the habit got translated over from a full hearing senses to a vision senses but yet still produce the same results in this cycle of habitual non-hearing, non-comprehending what i am seeing/listening to.   now mind you, this only happens with my boyfriends. i dont have this problem with other people and its really, really weird .. and kinda quirky, if you think about it. typical me.   pretty neat huh =)

						   someone told me the other day that i looked like i weighed 120lbs. to that person - thank you very much, and omg, are you BLIND?!! but nevertheless, that was such a great compliment, i don't care if it isn't 100% true (hehe)  needless to say, i got me a few more lbs to shed, but im hard at work. i actually went to the gym 4 out of 7 days this past weekend, which was very very good considering that i work and have class every day, so i should give myself a big pat on the back. i am not entirely sure if i should weigh myself yet any time soon because i know it doesn't just melt away like that, but man, how i wish it would .. *fantasizes*  but anyway, just wanted to drop a word or two regarding some weight issues and the hope of weight loss. i am sick and tired of thinking about it alone, silently, so i figured i should make it well known (altho, if you know me personally, you would know that i talk about being fat all the time, nobody wants to listen to me whine about it anymore..)  this week is going to be a heck lot busier than the last, i can feel it. i have two quizzes, and i think the homeworks are due some time soon, and this weekend i have a shootout thing to go to (plus some weekend bbq thing some time somewhere) .. better get my act together soon...

						   ooooo soo hungeeeeeee..... =(  this is why, when you live in an apartment, you cannot, absolutely not, leave grocery shopping to the very last minute .. i dont understand why im hungry though, i ate some lunch and been munching on cherries .. and cheese... i think i am missing real good food.. havent had that in a while. and by real good food, i am thinking malaysian food right now .. oh what i wouldnt do to taste that good old nasi lemak again, and the mee mamak and real good roti canai, and claypot chicken rice, and nasi dagang (mmmmm)... and all the keropok in the world, with the karipap and pisang goreng, and just, the good old normal daily food, like kangkung belacan, and those fish dishes, and the ayam percik and kurma chicken, like, REAL kurma, not the one I make coz that tastes really really bad ..   FOOOOOD!  I WANT FOOD!!

						   first off - congratulations, shaz, on getting a job, finally!! you deserved it especially after houding down pet for months on end, they finally realized the true star quality that you are :p let's hope you will like the job somehow... but you know, even if you don't, who cares! money is good in times like these, and you need money so you can save up and we can go down the good old memory lane in good old soggy, wet, and misty england =)  secondly ...   i would like to tell the world how lazy i am. i mean, i've always been somewhat lazy but this week, hands down, i have broken even my laziest of records (altho, i have erased those memories of laziness from years yonder, so it is possible that i have been lazier than this) .. but anyway as i was gonna say - this weekend, the first weekend that i have been unbusy *surprise, surprise*, all i have done all day today, besides showering and clamoring around the kitchen looking for food to eat(or lack thereof - haven't done groceries for over two months because of the combined sheer laziness of mike and i) is clean up the apartment from like, months ago.. the dishes in the sink needed to be done and the floor needed some mopping. so i did those. it wasn't that bad of a day out today, a little chilly, yes, but since i was overcome by such laziness, i didn't even do that. instead, what i have done was watch five movies in a row ... on cable... yes, five. i think i started the day with titan a.e at 11, to be followed by speed at about 1, then the red planet on sci fi at 3, followed by apollo 13, also on sci fi at 5, and now .. i am watching mission to mars ... i wonder what's playing after this one..   so yes, ladies and gentlemen, i am sitting on the couch with my mumu and an oversized sweatshirt, that doesn't even belong to me, staring blankly at the huge tv screen and relishing the bummingness that is me right now =) oh the greatness of not having anything to do .. i dont have homework, i dont have reading (well i do but i have done them, somehow), and i dont have to meet with projectmates....  *sigh*  wonderful! it is absolutely wonderful, and i am lovin it!

						   i finally caught up with one of my old mates from limehurst high in merry ole england and when asked if he remembered who i was, he said "... of course! you were that cool, popular girl!"  hehe  how dya figure? this guy, someone i haven't spoken to in like, over a decade, remembers me for being the "cool, popular girl" in our middle school! how freaking awesome is that .. talk about ego boosters. it made my day - totally! and made me remember who i am and what i used to be and it makes me want to shake myself off off this dirty, depressiveness that has clung onto me. no more, i say! no more men making me feel like a total wimp, no more loved ones telling me im not good enough or not cool enough or not this and that enough, no more people randomly saying that i can't make it in this world because im not of a certain "type". no more! i need to realize how lucky i am to be here, riding on free scholarship money and making the most of my life. i need to realize how difficult life is for other people who aren't presented with opportunities such as the one i am living.  i am living it everybody!  i was (and am) that cool and popular girl!!  on a somewhat upsetting note, the travesty of the american idol results tonight - just have one thing to say - no wonder the entire genre of "pop" has gone to shiat .. when you vote to let cute but untalented jasmine to stay on and cast off amazing singing latoya. i just dont get it, america, what the hell??!!?

						   wow .. i actually haven't updated this shiat in a lot more than couple of days, like everything else, the appeal has seemed to diminish, THAT and for the lack of dramatic stories to tell of, obviously. i don't particularly care for telling the world how i spent my last weekend holed up at school with my team mates, drawing diagrams and scrutinixing and analyzing this unbelievably crappy system .. but heck, i'm sure i coulda dramatized that if i wanted to - but i decided to spare y'all from it.  anyway, it seems like the bf won't know about this whole "job" thing until late summer and our landlord already wants to know if we want to secure this apartment or not, and will leave the rates at this current rent rate. i hope the landlord is swayable and flexible, maybe hopefully he can charm the landlord to giving us a special time to decide. or something. i dont really understand why we needed to decide now anyways, the lease doesn't end until end of august. that's months away!  i need new shoes for work. come summer time when it gets super hot and i get to go to work and then walk 2 miles to school, i will need to wear something that isn't boots. because it will be hot and sweaty and gross .. i didn't expect this internship to last this freaking long. it's almost like it's my normal job now, likened to those lab consultant jobs i had from yonder years. i'm going to be given "facetime" apparently, this summer with the top notch players, so they can fix me up with a job, i suppose. who knows. i hope someone can get me a nice job somewhere. it would be nice to make some money of my own and watch it grow. *dreams*  that's not for another year. will dream more later.

						   *bleh*  i don't get it. i go to the gym almost every day, i work out, i lift weights, and i am still NOT losing weight, in fact i swear i think i'm GAINING damn weight! it's so fucking annoying how that works, it makes me want to quit and be a vegetable and put on weight as much as it can go because there is no point in doing it anyways, coz i don't seem to lose any freaking thing.  this happened last time too, like, before sam and i broke up. junior year i went to the gym almost every day too, and i didn't lose weight. i'm telling you - the only time i really ever lost weight drastically was that summer onwards till mid senior year, during that whole "spanish inquisition" period. maybe i need to be super duper depressed, but i don't think it would work the same thing time, if it happens. i think it needs to go from super duper blissfully happy to like, random shock that will shake my world, drown in horrible, dank depression. certain elements are missing this time - but perhaps it can still produce the same results... hmmm....   but anyway, maybe the damned lifting weights are making me put on weight .. but i like lifting weights, it feels like i'm actually doing something to the muscles, like, my arms are still freaking sore from last friday when i did random shit to it. oh well, maybe i just gotta starve myself to death.

						   wanna hear something kinda funny?  my brother has gone from girl to girl to girl, and he has spanned the globe on this one. he has dated from the typical malay girl, to the more liberal-minded, modern malay girl, to the older-in-law-school chinese girl, and NOW, he is dating the hot-body-indian girl that he found while he was at national service camp (aka boot camp!) it's UNBELIEVABLE!! i am SO proud of him =) way to go little brother!! now all i gotta do is get my sister to span the globe too ... he has had a lot of chances, so many guys have wanted her, but she has always rejected them .. sister is very very picky - she is a LOT pickier than i am, and for that, i have been put to shame .. i love watching or rather, hearing about the growth of my siblings .. i wish i was there to see them sprout from youth to young adults. i have missed a pretty good chunk of time with them, and crave to be with them at this stage of life - the young adulthood. the choices they have to make, the things that i have already been through and would love to share with them, i almost wish that i was there for the entire cycle, but had i been there, i wouldn't be here, and that would have been somewhat uncool ..   my brother got accepted into the technology university of malaysia *UTM* for some architecture diploma/degree. i think he's waiting for the international islamic university *UIA* results too.. it's going to be interesting to see how he will fare in this whole entire being in the university thing .. it's just so unreal - my little brother, going to uni???? aahhh!!!!

						   i find that i am more certain about what it is that i want to get out of my career and that i am more confident in presenting myself to prospective employers. in the past year, since i have transitioned from an electrical engineer to an information technologist, found myself actually ENJOYING and LIKING what i learn. the fact that i also have experience to show for at this point in time also made it more possible for me to be more confident about what it is that i want to do. but i think the key to KNOWING what i want to do after this delightful journey would be the fact that i have such great mentors surrounding me and i have been blessed with wonderful experiences of meeting such high level people. so, hooray for me! finally .. about TIME i know what i want to do with my life.  ....  anyway, on my way back home from ditching my night class, i got to thinking about some things my mom told me about my aunt and uncle. the four of them sat around, catching up, chit chatting, and yakking on and on about another aunt, circling the subject over and over again, and my mom commented on how my uncle gossiped freely on the topic without regard, whereas had my father been in the picture, he would be the no-nonsense, no-gossipmongering kind of guy who wouldnt be interested in empty talks. in fact, what my father WOULD have done would have been to shake his head in shame (of uncle behaving somewhat femininistic and of worthless topics) and walk out. this is perhaps, why, my father doesnt quite like my aunt and uncle -- and i am sure the feelings are mutual. or perhaps not, but my father is quite the scary, authoritative figure. i remember as a child and even throughout teenhood, my friends have always been quite cautious whenever he was around, and a really noisy room would become quiet when he walks by or through the room. the fact of the matter is that it isnt that he is scary -- it is that he is very confident and stern looking. my father was raised to be very gentlemanly with very traditional views of how the world should work, each mannerism ought to be a machochistic (if not more) as the next. and the more i think about this, the more i realize how unbelievably similar my current boyfriend is to my father. now, whether this is a good thing or a bad thing, i cant quite decide yet.  there are some very disturbing things about dating the man who is quite like your father that i cannot seem to acquiesce to. while i traditionally hate men who are chauvinistic and i DONT think that all women should do a man's bidding (such as clearly displayed by most machochistic men), there is a certain attractive quality about the brazenness and barbarism that a macho-man have that could potentially attract strong women, such as yours truly, to these men, such as the one i am constantly surrounded by. which reminds me of a conversation i had tonight with my friend in iceland:  Bryn: vikings are barbaric Fasha: there is certainly quality that was portrayed in those [romance] novels i used to read as a growing teen, that attracted me to them tho ..  Bryn: isnt your boyfriend half-viking? Fasha: yes, he is  quite  barbaric.. if he could do what cavemen did to cavewomen, he would drag me by the hair and toss me into bed in a second..  it might be because i was raised in such an environment that promotes honest-to-goodness traditional values and roles, but i have my own reasons for liking 'barbarism', so to speak, in my men.  although, after tasting a certain metrosexuality that my ex-boyfriend displayed, i cant deny the fact that i rather like having a boyfriend who liked doing things that i liked (albeit, at times it scared me shitless, knowing that my boyfriend had better taste in clothing that i did!) and to draw out the striking analogy, while my current boyfriend could have been my father, my ex boyfriend could have been my uncle -- sensitive, vain, urban, chic, modern men, who believe that a good closet is as good a mannerism as you can get. if you have ever been so lucky as to experience both types of men, you will understand the dilemma i face in trying to decide which kind i like better =) not comparing or anything like that, i must say, both experiences have been unique.  enough rumbling for now. tonight was a night filled with networking. and networked i did, with top CIOs and COOs from the event last night. leave me a message or two about which kinds of men you would prefer dating: the macho or the  urlLink metrosexual .

						   *shrieks times two!*  i rode the elevator with the CIO of the City of Chicago and he said he would like to sit down with me to discuss networking opportunities and to help me with job hunting (of course i just briefly dropped the hint that i am graduating next year) ..   w00t!

						   *shrieks*  i went to this awesome Women in IT Panel Discussion last night at Egan Urban Center, and met with four really outstanding women who are leaders at what they do. the whole shannanigans of networking was not lost on me, as i am approaching that stage of where i want to go and know exactly what i want to do, which is a big huge step in the right direction to finding that perfect dream job (although, it will probably take more than that first one job offer to get me there since i cant really pick and choose the companies, it all is predetermined with which companies will sponsor me.. a little stifling in potential, but beggars cant be choosers, at least not for now)...  but in any case, one of the panelist was the most helpful person i have ever met, and she was pointing me in all sorts of directions, and making sure that i emailed her and forward my resume so i can be 'exposed' to the eyes of some of the AMEX people that she works with.. who knows, maybe this could lead somewhere.  still doesnt take away my anxiety and freaked-out-ness. but that just comes with the obsessive nature. i am sure things will somehow fall into place, but i cannot take it for granted that it will. gawd, its so hard to be all cool on the exterior when on the inside, all you want to do is freak out and die!  in any case, got lots of networking to do, people to catch up with, job boards to visit, and resumes to send out. not entirely sure how that would work out, but i hope it will catch on to something that will hook. probably should go to some cover letter workshop to come up with that ONE letter that will create waves.   list of things to do.. too bloody long. you get the picture.

						   hey hey! you would not believe who i bumped into in the CTI lobby last night .. so i was standing in front of the computer lab with my team mates, when lo and behold this tall hunky man came up to me and hugged me with a big huge grin on his face... it was sorta funny because i was like, erm .. who the heck are you ..turned out that the guy was my friend like northwestern, classmate, same major, same graduation year, the very same guy who told me off for not having a purpose in life and also that i wasnt using my free time to volunteer at places like the homeless shelter and the soup kitchen (yeah, he was a volunteer zealot/freak and thought he could convert me into one too ... lots of BS that did, but we are still friends, heheh .. coz he changed his tune a little after sophomore year)  so yeah, i bumped into matt hayden, and it was awesome just bumping into people you havent seen in ages! i totally LOVE it! i even think we are in the same class next fall, w00t!  in any case, my meeting this morning didnt quite happen. the address i was suppose to go to was in the 700+ block of west jackson boulevard. yours truly, not thinking that it would be a big deal to walk from state street, decided NOT to mapquest the journey and decided to just start from whichever el stop she gets off at. it would have been fine if i was like, an hour early, because by the time i got to the end of the federal reserves bank, which was the 200+ block on west jackson boulevard, i was already sweating in my teensy top and due to really big huge sandals, which were oh so uncomfortable to walk in ... so i looked far into the horizon, where the skies are high and the 700+ block buildings NOT visible to the naked eye..  thought id get there by waiting for a bus ..  WRONG!  there were a myriad of buses going EAST, which was in the OPPOSITE direction i needed to be heading towears, and so i was waiting for another half hour to forty five minutes... finally, i decided to give up because by the time i get there on the bus, if the bus ever comes, it would be 1130, and the meeting would have ended by then.  so watever.  walked back to the office and did some scheming and strategizing. i really am taking after my wonderful boss -- scheming and strategizing is never better when done against the master. mwahahaha!  so this weekend, mike and i are going to try and rally up some people to go with us to dave and busters .. it would be soooooooooooo awesome .. i cant wait, i used to play the house of the dead and if my fingers could have been ANY faster, with the killing and shootings of those dead zombies, it would have been miraculous.. because the speed they were going, i could have created a new record for light speed .. hehe =) cant wait!

						   *BOLLOCKS!!*  omfg, i totally failed myself, and all love-kind... i FORGOT my own monthliversary, sheesh-louisseeee!! hehe, i was too busy watching random shit and doing random things (and probably taking a whole lot of nappies) that i bypassed the day without a single thought.  shame of me .. *cowers in shame* terrible fashie, terrible .. tsk tsk tsk .. !  oh well, its not entirely my fault, my other half didnt remember it either so .. i suppose when you reach this late in the relationship, you forget and its not really that important to remember the date you first met/officially start the relationship anyways ... shame tho, i used to celebrate it every month for four years .. hehe, oh those were the young days .. when i actually have the energy to do it. (or rather, mental power to remember it)  i hate my new team. people dont seem to be doing much and i am getting a little antzy. will need to start the analysis up myself and have the boys edit it. gawd, i shoulda known better than working in a team with boys. boys dont do jackshit.

						   just rewatched love actually, and for a second, made me bawl at all the appropriate scenes. gawd, im such a leak and a mess. movies like these humble me and make me want to believe in an all around loving world. but alas, movies are always made to keep hopes afloat, without actual results.  one point tho, that was realized the second round i watched this movie: the "needing" and "wanting" part. there was this one scene where the secretary flirts with her boss, coyly asking him to buy her a christmas present. and he calls her back, asking "so what it is that you need then? something in the stationary section? a stapler perhaps .. (trying to be sarcastic-funny-flirtatious)".. and the secretary answered.. "I dont want something i need, i want something i  want "  for some reason, that part had the teensiest bit of electrical jolt effect on me, perhaps being really close to heart, and a personally favorite subject of mine: the quest on needing and wanting. see, i have always thought that when you are in love, in lust, infatuated etc etc with someone, it is always about needing, so much that you cant bear to be alive without that person. but the scene that keeps replaying in my head, was that one, where the analogous to needing, as a secretary, would be needing a stapler, and stapled to fill it up. analogously, that would convert to, oh, i dont know -- perhaps in the terms of husbands and wives, the husband would provide for the wife with, say, a house or money and what not. and in terms of bf/gf that could translate into bf performing obligated duties to the gf, in hope that he got the right dates properly marked down on his calendar.  but maybe i am going and thinking about it all wrong. perhaps, the term that i should coin this, love/lust/infatuation thing should be "wanting" and  not  needing. perhaps translated, wanting in lust and infatuation would symbolize the physical cravings and fantasies of living happily ever after, together, and wanting in long-termed, stable relationships could translated into, passion and intense love. wanting might not be too bad of a term to replace needing.  being the obsessive, compulsive, possessive person that i am, needing just made more sense. to need, for me, seem higher in urgency than to want. but maybe in another persons world, the not so obsessive, compulsive, possessive world -- wanting is probably more than likely makes more sense to beat needing on the priority list.  well, i suppose i should start opening up my eyes and seeing things how they really are, and not how they should be. and especially not in the terms i have set for myself because they are apparently too high to live by.   read my post on weltaanschaungen.spoken  urlLink here

						    torn  I thought I saw a man brought to life He was warm, he came around like he was dignified He showed me what it was to cry Well you couldn’t be that man I adored You don’t seem to know, don’t seem to care what your heart is for But I don’t know him anymore There’s nothing where he used to lie My conversation has run dry That’s what’s going on, nothing’s fine I’m torn  I’m all out of faith, this is how I feel I’m cold and I am shamed lying naked on the floor Illusion never changed into something real I’m wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn You’re a little late, I’m already torn  So I guess the fortune teller’s right Should have seen just what was there and not some holy light To crawl beneath my veins and now I don’t care, I have no luck, I don’t miss it all that much There’s just so many things that I can’t touch, I’m torn  I’m all out of faith, this is how I feel I’m cold and I am shamed lying naked on the floor Illusion never changed into something real I’m wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn You’re a little late, I’m already torn. torn.  There’s nothing where he used to lie My inspiration has run dry That’s what’s going on, nothings right, I’m torn  I’m all out of faith, this is how I feel I’m cold and I am shamed lying naked on the floor Illusion never changed into something real I’m wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn I’m all out of faith, this is how I feel I’m cold and I’m ashamed bound and broken on the floor You’re a little late, I’m already torn

						   you know, some people just dont know how to appreciate me. so to that person(s), i say:  :fuck you, im sorry i even bothered!:  if you are going to treat me like i dont exist, and then purposely make a comment about treating people properly when they are around you, then you obviously dont think im a person and dont deem me worthy of your time, so why dont i simplify it for you, and shut the fuck for the rest of forever, aight??!!! i am SICK and TIRED of trying.  before i forget, yours truly was featured in the career center newsletter. sent some home to loved ones. if you are loved, you will get to see it.

						    not of this world   You, the thought of you filling my mind, filling my thoughts Like an ancient secret that refuses to die. You, completing my memories, completing my soul Feeding me with the fire that you carry through the ages. You, a beautiful, singing lark Flying gracefully across an ocean of skies You, carrying the torch of familiarity Offering comfort and seeking approval. You, callously tossed me aside Only to forget and gather me back in your arms.  You, My rogue. My pirate. My prince. You, make me crave, make me obsess.

						   i think i am obsessed with my boyfriend's physical appearance. i have pictures of him taped to the insides of my diary and any physical picture i get of him, i frame, or i paste it in my diary or stick it in the insides of my wallet flap. i dont really know where the obsession orignated from or how it came to be, but i just came to the conclusion just now, as i stared boringly into the vastness of my cluttered cubicle.  i am not even sure if it's so much him or the fact that i still havent gotten over (and may never get over) the fact that he is such a beautiful specimen and that he is this hunk of a white male in his prime. the thing that really gets me is his smell: the tiniest whiff of it is enough to make my stomach turn into expert gymnasts. i know that i have always relied of smell as key to my attraction to men, but there is something about his smell that reminds of me of the comforting familiarity of the past,present, and future. its funny, how from the first moment i met him, that it has felt new and yet old at the same time. even now, up to this moment, months before we celebrate our second year anniversary, it still feels new, and yet ever so ancient, as if we have been together for so long that it feels very comforting and very familiar.  but back to my obsession. how do i begin. i think part of the reasoning of my obsession could be explained by how intrigued i am with his past life, how he went through all these girlfriends and what he was like back in the days where he was still searching for himself (so to speak) and encountered many a challenges (and came face to face with demons that he created) and yet, the thing that i am still trying to piece together is that his face doesnt reflect the stories that have been told. his face still remains innocent and beautiful, untarnished, and when you see him sleep, you can almost see a pseudo angel lying in bed, without a care for the world or how it began and will end.   there is something about the boyishness of his features, coupled with that scent, that drives me quite literally off my chair (even as we speak now, i find it hard to calm the knots in my stomach) if i were allowed, i would sit and stare at his face all day and smell him up every opportunity i get.   and hence the obsession. *swoons*

						   if there is an award for being the most cunning intern, i think i will win it. i have learned the nuts and bolts of manipulation, all part of a larger picture to fit in with the strategem deviced by yours truly to get out of administrative works laid down by the boss. and thanks to him, i learned a few tricks or two about lying without flinching, or perhaps, the lie is done so convincingly that even i believe its true (i only learn from the best)  so i decided that ive had enough and left work early. then he calls me and said that hed just received an email with an attachment in it, and needed HELP downloading it and EDITING it. what the hell? can he not do that himself? i dont understand how he gets to be a deputy CIO if he needs help with that. and today, he wanted me to double check this one word document because he didnt think it was a 12pt font roman (it really was in 12pt, he was just viewing it at 140%)!!!!  now, please, someone pull me out of this misery?  my art of wasting at work isnt quite the cubicle-staring that everybody else does. it actually consists of me completing my entity searching in my CASE*tools exercise, and disconnecting my phone line so that my hopeless boss wouldn't call me in to "help" him type up an email. life is good, for two seconds. because when he realizes he cant find me, he calls up my cubicle-neighbor, and have HER call me in. ugh.   i cant wait till august 20.

						   i have come to a juncture where i need to decide what to do with my housing situation come next leasing year. my heavy heart is saying and telling me to sign the lease with my friend, but i dont want to leave my domain here in evanston. i love this apartment and it feels like a true home to me. i feel comfortable living in this place and i am all settled down and i really really really dont want to move! but i cant stake my chances. who knows when i might get thrown out, knowing my bf, he would up and leave whenever he wants as soon as he finds that one dream job. i dont blame him, i would too if i hated my job as much as he does, but thats still another problem for me in terms of finding housing. i dont mind the whole moving around when it is clear what the variables are. but right now, there are too many unknowns playing the major part in this equation. and i hate it.  i suppose moving into a new place could be somewhat fun. i get to buy new stuff, sorta kinda. who knows. and it would be more appropriate, especially since my family may come down again to see me graduate next year, and it wouldnt bode well if they saw my bf hanging around my side every single waking and sleeping second. and living with gay men could be fun, i suppose. its just that that housing that was offered to me has 6 rooms. i will be getting FIVE roommates. i duno how im gonna handle that, i wont be in control of the entire house. and you all know how anal i can be about clean apartments. im not dianna bad, but i dont like to see dirty underwear all over the floor, and half eaten pizza molding under the couch. nor do i like dust and dirt. i clean so much because it bothers me to feel dust under my feet. i suppose i could wear socks.  but back to the matter at hand.  what to do? the rent will be aproximately $350 ish. cable tv and internet will be shared, so i wont have to pay the entire $200 load. which would be great. hmm. then id have to get a new bed because if mike stays here i sure as heck wont want to move the bed anywhere (i will probably end up staying over here more than there anyways).  so what to doooo, what to dooo... too many variables, too many unknowns. i need to hurry up and find a job and move out already. grow up.

						    I GOT A NEW CELLPHONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    w00T    urlLink My New T6376   It was somewhat of an impulse buy.. I mean, yea I looking for phones, then I was disappointed because of the whole frequency bandwidth thing, and then I was thinking of settling with either the Motorola V400 or V600, but hated the design (too fat and chubby for me) .. and i was gonna like, not care about getting a new phone..  until last night, when i looked on phonescoop.com (great site, yo) and found these two phones:  1.  urlLink My New T6376   2.  urlLink My "other" phone to be (release date: end of 3rd quarter this year)   so you see .. i may get two phones this year, depending on if ATTWS will be configured to id properly .. mwahhaahah  so, that was  good news number one    good news number two : DENTIST office called me.. there is a $600 check coming in the mail with my name on it and i am ECSTATIC! looks like i didnt have to part with it for too long, which is really nice =)  now, BAD NEWS:  the career center's IT dept need to hire that student intern right away, so i obviously cant do it because im interning with the city .. too bad, had to let it go with very heavy heart, and VERY reluctantly. BLEH!  but hey, two good news and one bad. not too shabby for the monday blues.

						   went to sakinah's graduation day today. great day, great speech and ive come to realize, that its much greater to be a spectator on the day of graduation than to actually take part in it. theres less pressure and you can scream and cheer and be as loud as you want without people thinking youre being weird. when you are down there, on the boardwalk, you cant really scream your heads off. you are "supposed" to be dignified, and you sure as hell cant scream for your self when you go up on the stage to get your diploma -- that would just look sad and pathetic. plus, i remembered when i graduated, i had this looming darkness in front of me; the fact that i was jobless and had no prospects lining up. it made graduation day so very unfunny for me.   today was much better. watching sakinah graduate makes ME feel better about MY graduation two years ago (not sure how the psychology works but it does) and its also great to cheer on a friend getting her degree. we were a company of four, but when her name got called up on the stage, we sure as heck gave a cheering performance worthwhile of the entire stadium =) hehehe... ok maybe a gross exaggeration but we were plenty loud, and lemme repeat myself -- its so much more fun being a spectator!! next time someone graduates, im bringing a honky tonk to blow when theyre being called up.  went to treat mikes dad for a fathers day dinner. reminds me .. i should call MY dad and wish him happy fathers day. i dont even know if they know its fathers day down there. these hallmark holidays arent quite as celebrated as they are here. for good sense too.  i was invited to sheraleens cousins birthday party tonight at zentra. i havent decided if i should go or not, but im already in my jammies and am refusing to think about having to wear skimpy outfit to go clubbing after i stuffed myself full of fiery flautas and a bowl of homemade chips and salsa from chevys... if i feel a little less bloated (which is highly unlikely since my time of the month is bound to knock on the door any moment now) i might go...  in other words .. not a chance am i leaving the domain tonight.. i think im gonna play mikes new gotham racing game instead to see if its any good. i hope jay will sell his gamecube and paraphernalias to me for $150. it will complete our already almost completed console gaming center.  did i ever recommend this read for you:  1. Jennifer Government by Maxx Barry 2. The Confessor by Daniel Silva 3. Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold 4. of course all of the books written by Dan Brown (I already have ALL of them, I like him that much)

						   turned out that there was SOME highlight to my friday work. boss had shiat to do in the morning and failed to tell me until the morning, and even so, did it so badly because he emailed me at my HOME email, which i couldnt access to for the first half of the morning due to crappy beta web interface. when i finally got a hold of it, it was around lunchtime and realized i had to meet with this knowledgable wireless dude at 1pm at OBM. so i did.  it turned out really well. i learned dirty little secrets happening within the city of chicago, and learned some legal terms regarding asset management and cashflow with a certain cable company filing for bankruptcy, and at the same time, figured out what could happen to the cable industry if this and that happened (i cant divulge dirty secrets on here, so i better not else i may actually get into trouble!)  its really interesting to see how the upper management people handle technology talk. i dont know if they actually know what it really means to say all those things they are saying, because when they start talking about fiber bandwidth and wavelengths and downstream/upstream, all I could think about, being the "natural" electrical engineer that i am, are the stupid darn equations that are tied to wavelength and frequency, and that long fiber equations with DWDM and such. the meeting certainly made the equations more interesting.....

						   omg, this is getting unbelievably ridiculous. i am here and my boss isnt. there is no word as to where he is, i could have sworn that we had a meeting with some high level person in some consulting firm at 10am and lo and behold -- nowhere in sight. i am very tempted to leave work without a trace too. i have NOTHING to do, and am wasting invaluable time. what a load of crap. this is a totally worthless day if you asked me. i should have brought my work out clothes.. at least then, i could have gone to work out and come back and nobody would know!  ok now what do i do??  *tap.tap.tap*

						   am currently taking a day off from bizarro workland. my entire body feel extremely achey for some reason, alikened to when i would go to the gym and work out like crazy and lift weights with no regard of how i HAVENT stretched. it was that bad, that i didnt even manage to wake up until close to noon today!  i am going to have to part with my wonderful $600 today. i really, really, REALLY dont want to go but i have to. =( mleh. such a terrible thing to do.  so, remember how i freaked out about ending this internship end of this summer because i wont know what will happen in the fall (eeks, without a job, means no MONEY!!) but my friend in the IT dept at depaul said they are looking for student(s) AND my career advisor told me that the career center's technology group is looking for technical people to commit to a one year internship! woooooo .... !! hopefully one (or even both!) of them will work out. *pleeeaaassseee****  ok i have to get ready to go to the dentist office. and then possibly luncheon at mt everest, and then get change to do my boyfriends laundry =) hahahaha..

						   i am  DONE  with the el.  on my way home today, the red line decided to stall at the jackson stop for five minutes for no reason. then at the thorndale stop, the el was turned off completely (and yes, we were sitting on the platform, in the dark, hot and humid carriage, AT NIGHT!) for ANOTHER ten minutes because there was damned debris on the tracks at the granville stop ahead of us!  man. i cant take the el anymore. it is the bane of my existence, number two. youve guessed the number one bane, youve heard about it for a few days nonstop now, i should give it a rest for the time being, until something new comes up.  just a little anecdote, however, on how crappy of a manager my boss is. he called a meeting today and not only were people LATE to the meeting (said they had to do this and that and this, and these people were lower level than he is, so its very rude of them to do so), one guy didnt even show up! i just dont think people respect him, and at the same time i feel joy that other people hate him too, i cant help but feel sorry for him. it is very humbling to be asking people to do things for you because you are physically incapable of achieving those daily-taken-for-granted tasks, but its another thing when people just outrightly disrecpect you for being a bad manager BECAUSE of that.  oh well. its not my time to feel extremely apologetic for him. i think he got my message though, and sometimes, my guilty conscience wont stop bugging me ...

						   if i got paid $90,000 to sit on my ass and shoot the shit politically with all sorts of lawyers and CIOs and CEOs and Chiefs of Staff, i suppose i would do it too. but the problem is -- i DONT!  i only get paid a measly intern wage. i dont WANT to sit around and BS my way into learning things i should be learning about. i fucking hate strategizing when i dont have a solid background in the things that im strategizing about. and my boss shouldnt be doing it either -- he is a fucking blank hole when it comes to technology. yeah, he knows buzzwords, and yeah he could be somewhat of a semi-expert on voice recognition technology and screen readers, because he use those tools, but my god, he doesnt know jack shit otherwise! and i think ive figured it out -- he is just plain lazy. the tools dont quite work as well as havin someone type up his emails and run his errands. its much easier to get someone to do it for him rather than him doing it for himself. that could be said for higher level people tho. the higher you climb up the ladder, the lazier you become.  i suppose i am being given face time. face time is good if you already know shit. but i know crap. i havent graduated to shit yet. i cant be given face time. but what the hey. who cares. who gives a damn, right?  it was kinda funny today. my subconscience must really hate that place over there, so it somehow telepathically unplugged my alarm clock, allowing me an extra hour of sleep, and waking up, realizing i was goin to be an extra hour late.   woops!   *sheepish grin   not that it mattered. my boss was TWO hours late to work, so fuck yeah! it didnt impact my day at all. in fact, nothing i did today impacted my day because i did NOTHING with that retard. except for the last hour and he just HAD to come crawling back to get me to email for him. the rest of the day, i used the time to network with people to get a job for the fall, fixed my supafly resume, and talked to some database administrator, who hooked me up with an Oracle 8 reporting form/tool to install on my PC at work. he was also kind enough to walk me through the structure of the database, the reporting tool, and forms, and how it all merges together from a database design and a data model. it was pretty neat. i didnt think you would need all that freakin software to create just one lousy report. i cant wait to learn PL/SQL and then learn how to merge all that i already know to form a report.  apart from that, i got hooked up with a job in the IT dept at depaul for the fall (hopefully), and perhaps i can get research done with one professor (we shall see), and then some.  tomorrow i will lose $600. my stupid insurance still hasnt managed to find its way to the dentist to pay them yet, so i will need to fork out my own money to get it done before they chase after me with a pitchfork.  mleh.

						    i ...  haaave...  haadddd ...   enOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   i am SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  sICk  of my stupid bigot-of-a- RETARD  boss!!!  the most recent episode that took place today was something that has sealed his fate in my most blackest of books, one where NOTHING one can do to climb back out of the dankest and dampest of such place. he is probably the ONLY one sitting in there right now. he deserves to be there, alone, with  NO  personal assistants to wipe off his snotty nose and scratch off the flakes off off his fat ugly face.  yes, readers, you are right. i utterly despise my stupid boss. and this is why.  as you all know, he is a deputy CIO. this means that all he does at work all day is play things politically and yak and talk bullshit until something happens. he know JACK SHIT about technology, CLAIMS he knows somethings, but he really doesnt. that is fine, i know a lot of people who dont know how to even use the mouse of a computer, so thats not a biggie. the PROBLEM is that HE thinks that I should be EXACTLY like him, be a strategist, and not bother about learning anything technical because thats not how the world works.   there has been talk in the department that new projects are cropping up and that i am itching to dip my brainy head into the projects and help out. the lady i spoke to on the elevator up was all happy to hook me up with a project manager to help me get started with the project work. so i thought, ok, before i do this i should run it by my stupid boss to let him know that i am taking initiatives.  so i go in his office, asked him if it was ok with him if i volunteered myself to help out and he said "NO, we dont need to be finding you more activities" and at the time, i had in my hand, his head rest that was taken off from his stupid wheelchair, and was standing behind him, and i had to CONCENTRATE  HARD  to not WHACK the headrest on the back of his fat bulgy head.    OMFG!   and THEN.... he was like, "you know, i am a strategist and you are a do-er" .. and i said i wouldnt mind if i was a strategist too so long i know and have experience in the technical part of things, and he was like, "well, I dont have technical background, and it doesnt bother me!" ...   that is WHY, you fucking fucker, you are such a TERRIBLE waste of money for the city! you suck! your managerial skill sucks, your motivational skills suck, and you sure as heck shouldnt be in this department if you dont have a technical background!! how you gonna manage a team of technical people when you dont know jack-fucking-shit!  WHY ... would .. ANYONE NOT want to let me work HARDER? i am TAKING initiatives to find MORE work, to help them out, and i was REFUSED???!!!!???!!!@#%$%@$%@%%$@%#$!!  i mean, its  NOT  like i am  DOING  anything. i am writing up his fucking emails like his stenographer, i am adjusting his fucking dead feet because he is not "comfortable", i have to lean him slightly to the left so he can move retardedly on his retard wheelchair, i help him blow his nose, i run errands for him ....   i wasnt HIRED to be his fucking personal assistant. i was hired to be a BUSINESS ANALYST intern, and  WHAT  am i doing??!!@#!!!  i cannot  WAIT  to get out of his fucking office. at this rate, i dont even care if he doesnt hook me up with a job after i graduate. because he knows JACK SHIT people in the tech area, and he would probably get me hired on to be his PA.  can SOMEONE KILL him for me!!!

						   hehe, you know what i just realized from my lazy sunday yesterday.. mike and i played the sims bustin out religiously on the ps2 from 330pm to 1210am!! thats over 8 hours of our day, it is more than the average working time for one day, and its really kinda funny! =) its such a cool game tho, you should all try it!  ok, it is that time guys -- where i need to decide what to do with my living situation. still dont know if my bf is going to move out to rockford, now my friend just put out in the open about his 6 bedroom house that will be up for rent, and then there might be a possibility to move to lombard/wheaton area?  seriously guys -- everything is so up in the air its making me pretty antzy and frumpy! i cant deal with this right now. not with full time work and full time school and full time work hunting for next year .. PLUS full time looking for a job for school next academic year. i am already bummed with the research leads ive gotten from the professors i met with -- they both dont have grant money to go around and i sure as hell need money.   ffffuuuuucccckkkk!!! ..

						   so, very very sad.  i researched into the whole GSM and ATTWS and the sim card, and found out that i cannot just get an unlocked GSM phone, i need to make sure that the phones run on 800/1900 since apparently ATTWS is focusing on the 850 right now. and of course, the phones that i like (the sony ericsson z200 and motorola v690) are NOT on the 850 one (they have 1900 but i dont think itd be enough) so i have been reduced to a motorola v400, which is not worth the price if bought without signing on to a new plan. the other option i have right now is the nokia 7200, which hasnt been tested in this country yet, so the price is over 400$ and the worthiness is in the dark. therefore, i have been reduced to not getting a cell phone until either i convince myself that it is worth paying $200+ for that v400, or just wait until the nokia 7200 has been tested on this side of the world. looks like i am stuck with my absolutely crappy siemens c56 (i hate this phone so much -- you have NO Idea!)  but watever. i suppose i can now save more money to buy that new computer that i need, which is another huge investment, but am unsure when i will be committing to that. at this moment in time, i need a new AC. its so HOT in the apartment, that one lousy inbuilt AC is not enough to cool down two very hot and horny mammals .. heheh =)

						   *stretches lazily in bed* ive been doing that all day - lie in bed, napping like the part-cat that i am, relishing the bummingness that is this weekend .. come monday, i am going to miss this bummingness, seeing that i will be working full time and going to school twice a week, three hours each day .. =( the life of a busy person with high ambitions ... tsk tsk..  anyhoo, did nothing today, which was sorta nice in of itself but the 'antziness of needing to do something' personality could not be qualmed, so i had to reinvent things to do around the house, which includes renting the sims bustin out. it takes time to play games and i am just too goddamn lazy to do even that. oii.. wonder whats going on tomorrow, perhaps i can be persuaded to DO Something, but we shall see... i wish there were things to do at home that would satiate this antziness. if mike actually talked to me, i wouldnt care too much but he does his own things and the lack of interaction makes me feel like im doing nothing. i need to find something else to keep me occupied. i suppose this would have to do for now, while i wait out the time to start yet another busy summer.  i am in the process of trying to figure out which phone to get to replace my crappy siemens (free) phone. i cant decide if i should get a camera phone or just go with something that looks nice (obviously gsm and colored) .. but which one? any suggestions anyone?

The Day After Tomorrow :: Fasha says: dude, you know the plot is going to suck, so it's your fault if you went there with high hopes it was going to win the friggin' oscars! i liked it because of the bad science and the great effects -- should definitely be downgraded to the Sci-Fi channel in the near future (to match the 10.5 on NBC) 4.

						   looking and feeling good today. got a few complimentary whistles as i walked down state street downtown chicago, which makes  me  feel very beautiful =) days like these are always good to remember and always good to encourage me to go further with my quest of losing everything i have on my body such that i too will fall through the cracks on the floor, just like fiona apple .. maybe then i can attract more hungry males' attentions, to boost my somewhat deflated ego.  in any case, i cant remember if i got jipped out of my paycheck or not. i coulda sworn i put in more than 67 hours but that was the only amount that showed up, hence the paycheck was a few hundred dollars short. maybe i was thinking about this coming paycheck, and maybe i really should stop thinking about money so much and let it come to me. being materialistic and money-driven has a downfall - you get too caught up with little things like these.  seeing that i am off today and i have gone on to do my errands, i am going to be a good girlfriend and clean up the apartment until it is somewhat spotless clean. my quest on bettering this apartment would probably not take off as well as i would like to, because i lack certain amenities and tools to do so, but hey, i suppose i can make do with what i have and do the basics of cleaning. i have my mom to thank for, for this cleaning skill that i possess, because she makes me clean her house when i was growing up. every day and every weekend, she would be screaming at me constantly, something about picking up a broom and sweeping off the dust from the floorings. oh, those good old days of servitude to your parents ...  alrite well, i am gonna take a break from yappering, at this rate you will probably see more of me today... or not, we shall see.

						     YES!! i am DONE!!!   oo0oo00oohhh-freakin'-yeahhhhhhh ....  i finished my wonderful database final, submitted it and can now breathe in relief ... however, my summer class starts immediately after this weekend, so i got three, four days to party hard before having to start cramming again, and it will be a terrible cram because the sessions are only five weeks long each.  went to the clinic to get checked out. i hate pap-smears. the probing and poking is very uncomfortable and the scraping and ph checking of your most private areas... im glad it only happens once a year. the doctor thought she was treating a 17 year old when she walked into the examination area and saw me sitting there, wrapped in a big napkin (yea, they are so cheap, instead of a robe, i get paper towels).. 17 is probably the youngest age i have received so far. usually, i get the 'you look young' look, but did i tell, this one time, on the el, some high, drunken guy thought i looked like my friend's mother (and my friend is like, 30 years old) .. hehe. that was kinda funny, too funny to be insulted. but whatever man. age is only a number, mwahahaha...  ten men i want to do:    1. hugh jackman   2. brad pitt   3. rodrigo santoro   4. collin farrel   5. i guess i would do orlando bloom, like, do his hair or something..   6. .....     do you know how SAD this is? i cant think of ANY famous men that i wanna do .. i bet you i can list ten times more famous WOMEN that id like to have a lesbian action with. what is WRONG with me??!!!

						    ... "fiona apple is  GORGEOUS! "   err ... i dont even KNOW how to comment to that! there used to be jokes made about her, how she is too freaking skinny, bordering anorexia, that if she turned sideways, she would literally fall through the cracks on the flooring ... and if she got voted to be in the top 100 sexiest artists (and thank GOD she was like in the bottom 90s), i suppose i am happy .. but to CLAIM she is  GORGEOUS ?!??!!   *shakes head*  i duno, i think the world is coming to an end.. before long now, we will be voting for girls that can barely hold up a tank top for the lack of flesh (oh wait! that's  ALREADY  happening!)... but hey, if you like skin and bones, thats your prerogative, not mine. now, if you said NATALIE IMBRUGLIA is gorgeous, i would pant WITH you ;) i have a thing for britney spears though, her body is to die for ... *drools* .. or, or, have you SEEN paulina rubio?! shes like, a better looking version of penelope cruz, like, HOLY MOTHER OF GOD HOT!! rarrrrr .....    holy shit, they nominated the lead singer from red hot chilli peppers to be one of the top 100 sexiest artists ... err?!?? *continues watching*   on another note, i am lazzyyy ... i was supposed to go down to the city to pick up my check, then go to the dentist office to pay off the stupid $600 that isn't even supposed to come out of my own bank account, and then go for a womanly annual check up.. but seeing how nice and dark it is out there, i have developed a 'i-wanna-stay-at-home' syndrome and watch VH1 .. well, i'm also working on my database take home final right now, so i can use that as a formal excuse to not go anywhere but to my womanly annual checkup.  it seems like the pop culture is beginning to fall for the geek/nerd imageries, and you know .... i have had crushes on geeks waaayyy long before the fad took place. they should have just talked to me to begin with - i would have set them straight!

".. yeah, how's about  I  put on a strap on, do YOU from behind ...." "haha, then   I   watch you guys and masturbate .. hehehehe!!!"   we were in penang, the restaurant with great roti canai's and chicken satays, having THESE kinds of conversations and i almost fell over, laughing with tears in my eyes .. it was too freakin' much! but oh-my-god, i needed that after a mind boggling final, that almost took my shoulders out from the bending over too much. we match so well, our chemistry and our interaction with each other, that it would be a shame to end it with the end of this class .. so i think we will keep in touch more after this quarter, with future roadtrips, hanging outs, and ski adventures in store! wooooo .... let's go guys!!! let's shake some bootays and fall off our snowboards some time this year!! =)

						   i was unceremoniously dumped in the middle of an application that i didnt know about, and was expected to fix a bug by the end of the day! and whats even worse, i was told about to fix it by the end of the day, and my stupid fucking ill communicating boss didnt tell me about it until 4pm! i had class at 530pm .. that left me one hour and about 20 mins to find out where the problem is, figure out where the application is, find the DBA so i can get access to the fucking database, and then export the data out so that i wont accidentally make changes without meaning to (i need to practise! i dont even know how to work the oracle forms properly!!!) ... my boss expected everybody to drop everything to fix this bug -- he shoulda told us about it earlier on today and instead he wasted three hours mulling over this stupid strategy with the consumer services department regarding some freaking move with the commissioner over there ...   i HATE this place ..!! the more i am there, the more cancerous it becomes! everybody is so slow .. and NOBODY knows how to communicate properly, and when asked one thing i was given ten different answers and pointed to in fifty different directions!  thank god i am cute and i can bat and wink my eyelashes to get someone to finish it for me by tomorrow (and yeah, i cant go to work tomorrow to finish it up because i have finals all freaking day long!!)  .. then i run all the way from work to school coz i was late for my DB class and when i get there, my stupid professor is soooo incompetent, that he cant answer simple DB questions his students posed for him! i mean, dude! what IS With people today! a sleuth of incompetencies .. i swear, one of these days i am going to bomb this entire damn city!  i am gonna move to nebraska.. or alabama ... there ..

						   what makes one a pathological liar? is it that something happens in ones lifetime that made one realize that life wouldnt be right without making up a tiny white lie to embellish the truth or make it seemingly right? we used to hate this one girlfriend of one of our good friend because she was seemingly pathologically lying about certain issues regarding their relationship .. we were convinced that she made those stories up to thumb him down under her evil, tiny little fingers so he wouldnt go sniffling around some other girl.. the whole concept of pathologically lying just seemed so wrong to serve such a normal purpose - survival of the fittest ... you say what you can to keep certain things and if you say it often with enough conviction, even you believe it.  now, i am not trying to say that i am a pathological liar, but i cant deny in saying that i have developed a rather alarming habit of thinking up stories to amend to certain situations when the reality doesnt seem fitting. it isnt a story that is too far from the truth - it just has embellishments to make it more attractive or more believable than a simple explanation. these days, i find myself making up stories to solve situations rather than fess up and acknowledge that they cant be solved that simply. it doesnt even have to be problems. sometimes, i just come up with answers or explanations or stories that seems more fitting and i dont even blink an eye to do it. it just comes out naturally. and sometimes, i forget what is reality and what is make believe. and i think it has come to a point where i need to stop this really bad habit forming story making before it hurts me.  sometimes, these lies come to make ME feel better, and since truthfully, i  feel  better when other people  acknowledge  the fact that made me feel better, i have to cascade the knowledge down to the people around me. i dont do it all the time, but it wont really be reality if its made up and if i was the only one who knew about it. after all, it would be pretty pointless to make it up in the first place. but see, the making up of these stories are quite effortless. its pretty damn scary.  what is it about this lifetime that makes me want to hide behind such an intricate embroidered carpet of lies? what is it about this reality that makes me want to surround myself with a wall, a buffer zone of comfort?   sometimes, i cant believe i am here. sometimes, i wonder if this was the path that was meant for me. sometimes, i want to escape and live another parallel life in another dimension. sometimes, i just wish that  THIS  lifetime wasnt so complicated.

						   there is something about nutella on bread that is extremely good that makes me wanna eat it more than i really should .. that creamy, chocolatey taste, blending hazelnuts with a hint of cocoa .. it's a whole new experience with each bite and each lick of the spoon. mmmmm ... makes you forget your troubles for a while ...   in any case, my little sister is soooo unbelievably cute. she started her own website and now, she started her own blog too!! haha, its really adorable .. its like, mini me..following her big sister's footsteps (well, she doesnt wanna be an engineer/IS professional, she wants to be a doctor.. so.. theres a  little  difference..)  i was talking to my dad last night about the three kids growing up .. it must be a pretty awful, harsh reality for him to now have his second born going to college and in less than two years time, the last one will follow suit too in the journey of biggening the brains .. but he has to be proud of us - he has one engineer/IS professional embarking on the working world and experiencing corporate America, one architect in the makings, and one aspiring doctor. i would be proud too if i were him.. and i am proud of my siblings .. they are great and intelligent kids and i cant wait to see them succeed and to hear stories about their college lives so i can chirp in and tell them how i experienced it ...   hurry up and grow up my little sister! so i can start showering you with random crap advice about how to fool your professor into ditching class coz you got a terrible stomach ache that result in diarrhea ... heheh!

						   i was bad .. bad bad bad bad BAD!! i was really upset about having to pay my stupid dentist $600 first coz my stupid insurance company hasn't sent a check yet to them and it has been four freaking months now ... so i had to suffer the wrath of having to fork $600 of my own, so i went on a shopping rampage!!! B-A-D! fasha, B-A-D!!  i couldnt help it, i was waiting for a friend to come with me to my celebration of excellence ceremony award (yes, i got a certificate for be absolutely great, thank you very much) and while waiting, i was walking from shop to shop, and lo and behold, of course i tried stuff on and of course i liked some of the things i tried on ... maaaannn ... there goes the whole resolution to not freaking spend for the next year or two... i am TERRIBLE!!  thats alrite, my next paycheck on june 10th will be $840 and then in two weeks, another $840, and another $840, but then the fucking IRS takes my money from me and i will only be left with $600+ .... boooo ... thats alrite, JPA will pay me again at the end of july, and i suppose i can wait until the end of july to receive more than a grand of money ... but then, oh man i hope that i dont have to move out of this apartment and have to pay like, $600 rent on my own .. that would totally blow =(  but anyhoo ...   i need to lose weight. i think ive lost a good 5lbs or so, and i need to lose another 5 or 10lbs ... *crosses fingers*  summer time coming up, gotta look good right .. =)

						   zzZzZZzz  stayed up till 5am and woke up at 730am (i said  woke  up, not  get  up). slept over at tia's last night after having dinner with jeff and her in  the  best persian restaurant eva! gawd, the lamb shanks dish that i had was scrumptious, the meat was falling off the bone. i was very satisfied. the dessert that got server was real nice too .. tia claimed to orgasm as the white chocolate mousse melted in her mouth.. hehe .. it was fun -- we discussed all the things that didnt get discussed and we talked about joining yoga and copeira, AND the african dance diaspora (for me and jeff at the community park later on) i am SO excited! i cant wait to do yoga, it will be tons of fun. and since it would be down the street from where i will be living, my days will be filled with a ton of wonderfulness that is me and working out  we rented the worst movies possible to watch last night. confessions of a teenage drama queen (dont  ever  watch this movie, it was so crappy i wanted to cry!) and jeepers creepers 2 (it was actually better than the first one) hung out a lot and did nothing of significance but talk and chitchat and yakk. the duo is back in biznez baby!  i have to create a creative cover memo for the upcoming week. my big huge networking events are happening in the next 10 days and i have to be as charming and as intelligent as possible. i am quite excited actuallY! the cio of mccormick place is going to pick me up from work and drive me to a restaurant herself! i feel pretty special.... wish me luck and GOD PLEASE GIMME A JOB!

						   to go or not to go .. to leave or not to leave. why do i always find myself in this same situation every thursday afternoon? i get back from lunch, i sit at my desk and i wonder for hours if i should skip my night class or if i should be good and brave the boring-three-hour-lecture on how to IT Operations and Management (which i dont give a damn about right now because i am not in management yet, and besides, those things are common sense, you shouldnt have to be  taught  things like that!)  so yet again, it is thursday afternoon and i am debating if i should skip or if i shouldnt skip. tuesday night's class was unbearable i thought i was going to pass out from boredom. i wish i had brough my gym clothes -- then&nbsp;i wouldve just up and leave and head on to the gym. perhaps what i could do is go buy me a cheapo pair of work out shoes, shorts, teeshirt and gym-bra from old navy and just go work out. i was going to buy new work out clothes anyways -- mine look ugly and tattered... hmm... now  that's  a thought..  *ponders*  ok lets weigh this out. i am done with the GIS map. i dont need to add anymore stuff on to it because the hubs arent necessary and the fiber runs are well captured. i named the streets and titled it and all. no more fine tuning on my behalf. well i  could &nbsp;fine tune it more but there is no need because the streets lined up fine. i think. well too late to be thinking stuff like that now. i am not touching the damned laptop anymore. as for class tonight -- pish posh. i can view the video later on. and i dont bother really viewing it because it sux and the prof is so boring i want to gorge my eyes out.&nbsp; what is left to do, but leave?! i mean .. seriously...   *taptap*

						   *yawn*  had a great two hours work out at the gym, came back home, felt fine and it wasnt until later when i did more exercises at home that put me in a very, very exhausted state .. but i feel great! wish i couldve swam though -- that wouldve been somewhat more fun.  in any case, i have big dates coming up with big executives. i am trying not to lose track as to whom i will be speaking to, and it's very hard because they are all happening within a day of each other. the worst part of it is that not all of the dates involve a 'one-on-one' meeting. most of them happen via phone calls and i cannot remember people if i dont see their faces! i think tomorrow is with an accenture PM, friday is with the VP of unisys ... i have yet to reschedule a meeting with chris, and i have one with the principal of SDI on monday (the company i am sorta targetting more because i love their take on technology). at some point i also need to squeeze in the director of the ASK website (where all these mentors come from) and then i have to find room for the CIO of the mccormick place. eeks! too many! too damned many .. and i already have TEN to take care of .... ooiiighh..  other than that, i finally got the conversion from autocad into GIS right .. it only took me all of three days .. well not really, half the time i was pissing away working on networking and freaked about it today because i was under the impression that dorsey will be coming back tomorrow. i still dont know if he is or not, i suppose i will find out when i get to work tomorrow. hope he wont be there though. i gotta call people for the next three weeks and most of them want the calls to happen during working hours. people need to realize that i dont have an office to be making calls; i have a damned cubicle and people can hear me!  life is good. mike and i are great. i am looking forward to buying new furniture for the new house and i cant wait for a myriad of events to take place. this next year promises a lot of things and i hope that something great will come out of it.

						   saturday was THE BEST DAY ever!  treated mike to his birthday dinner at Bob Chinn's Seafood downtown (beautiful restaurant on the river, serves the best seafood eva!) and i had the most scrumptious alaskan king crab (mmmmm ... ) and the both of us had food coma afterwards (i mean, of course we did -- complete dinner with appetizer and dessert at a seafood restaurant would do that to ANYONE) we went for a mini river walk afterwards so as not to pass out from eating too much (and two guys on a boat were video taping us from on the river and invited us to jump down into their boat for a ride =))   had to leave downtown as quickly as we arrived since we were throwing&nbsp;a party later on that night .. and my god -- did we have fun! the boys came then my friends came, and more of his friends and my friends arrived. ive noticed that mike's friends are mostly tall, fat men and two of them took up half of my living room! and there were probably a good ten of them like that! hehe .. it was really fun tho -- we got good booze, good food, great company, great games (halo, project racing gotham (i think) and DDR2, courtesy of a very drunken lisa!) tia came over along with phil, two of my oldest and dearest NU friends. got a picture of paul's very naked and very chubby ass on tape, sang at the top of our lungs for the birthday cake cutting, and got rowdy that neighbors called the cops on us (but the cop was nice enough to let us go with a warning). we had to shut our windows afterwards to stem loud music and people shouting at the top of their lungs from reverberating into the streets of evanston (ev IL land!) very fun night, and very great people. someone puked on the steps downstairs though, that was kinda funny ..   sunday i went to help tia assemble her furniture at the new apartment.&nbsp;i must say -- i am looking forward to living in the same town as her again. we went through a lot junior/senior year and especially during my break up period. shes a fun and interesting person and i love spending time with her! hopefully med school wont kill her and she will have some fun time to spend (especially when i move in with jeff -- man thats just gonna be lots of reminiscing!)  on a more professional note -- the CEO/principal of SDI Chicago called ME to set up a time to meet for lunch! the date is set for next monday and i look forward to speaking with him. if this one goes through, i would have TWO options to choose from .. hells fucking yea!

						   my life has suddenly taken on a very interesting, happy ending-ish kinda turn. i found out yesterday that i am indeed worthy of being kept in this country as a working 'citizen' and that there is hope for me after all =) the CIO of the BIS department that i work for now said that if i do decide to come back and work for them full time, i should let them know by february of next year so they can get started on the paperwork and such. he also told me that i should keep my options opened because he believes that other companies will give me the chance he has given me too (i think he was referring to the companies he referred me to, so thats a good sign). but nevertheless, i have a backup plan.  then i went home and in my inbox, there is an email that made my heart spin faster than a spinning top -- the COO that i spoke to early this week forwarded my resume on to one of the companies that he works closely with, and must have made a good recommendation, because the CEO of that company said that i sounded like a good fit (based on the recommendation) and that my resume looked stellar! and i should expect a call in the next few weeks or something! aahhh!!  and on top of all that, i have secured a graduate assistantship with the place i used to work for before i went internship crazy. this position requires me to become a project coordinator, programming for events that will be of interest to adult students. and as far as i can tell, adult students are mostly interested in career and networking events, so heck -- even I will benefit from that! there will be a stipend involved with this position (which means i will make more than i did last time), and apparently my tuition will get waivered! i duno how that will turn out, since i am on a scholarship and all .. maybe if im lucky, i will get a check cut out in my name and i will get, oh, i duno .... $10k or something per quarter ..hehehehe =)  but even without the tuition waiver, i will be fine, and man, i am relieved in some way that i at least HAVE something to fall back on..... *phew* i just gotta make sure that i dont get hired on to do things that will put me in the humiliating spot of being someones nose-wiper.  today will be a special day. mike will be pampered all day and later on tonight, there will be a house party thrown and i will get to 'entertain' people. not that i like doing that much -- entertaining people is such a motherly/fatherly kinda chore ... but i get to see my old friends, so im happy enough and we will soooo get trashed .. woo! see yall lata!

						   my current living situation is the weirdest one ever. and i think what i am about to complain and/or discuss transcends just problems encountered when you cohabitate with a loved one -- i think it could be generalized onto bigger things, such as the big and scary M-arriage counterpart.   when you live with someone who is as reclusive as my boyfriend, you will know that its very hard to interact with them. and as much as they love your companionship, there are times when they could be locked in a cellar in the basement and wont make a peep for another week or so because they relish the dark, dampened, lonesome encroaching space. there is something comforting to these creatures, about being alone and not having to worry about saying the wrong or doing the wrong thing. there is no need for social niceties (even between lovers) and there is no need for pretense. i understand this completely after living with someone like this -- but this is the thing, he  isnt  the only one like this. there must be other men who are as much of a recluse like he is, and who LIVE with a loved one. so its not that weird of a situation.   the weird part about it is this -- how on earth will anyone with this type of personality ever get involved with another human being, and want to cohabitate, or even worse, get married to that one person and having to DEAL with LIVING with another living, breathing, talking human being, who, by nature, is a very social creature (save the select few like himself)? i mean, understandably, when one couple gets married, they tend to live in a bigger space, ie not a one bedroomed apartment, condo or house. but what if you are strapped for cash, there is only one bedroom in the entire house, and no other living space but one that is opened to all? then what? do you just tolerate the other person? is that the key -- toleration? but what if you dont have the patience to tolerate? do you then move out and live elsewhere, and just see each other when you can handle each other's antiques? what kind of relationship is that? reminds me of my own parents. one parent lived in one state, while another lived in a state on the OPPOSITE end of the country. makes great families *smirks*   or perhaps&nbsp;it is good practise to heed old adages --&nbsp;dont date someone radically different. but i think if i&nbsp;had to date someone like myself, i would kill that other person, and then eventually kill me, because i cant stand&nbsp;the thought of going out with myself. i mean, i love me, mind you -- but dealing with TWO of me's simultaneously? eeks!   the dilemma is this really .. on a more personal basis now. do i set my heart on moving on after i move out this september ie. not think about moving back in with a boyfriend, any boyfriend, after this.. or do i find a bigger place to move in with him? and risk having him living out of his office, never to see him except during meal times (that is, IF he remembers to come out?)

						   1-800-FLOWERS screwed up the birthday bucket delivery for mike -- instead of delivering the package tomorrow on his birthday, they delivered it to him today. I dont understand why they bother taking down the 'delivery date' if they werent going to stick to it. oh well, at least it came BEFORE his birthday. it would have been pretty pointless if it came 'after' the birthday. the main thing is that he liked it so im happy. and it got him to eat during working hours, which is another main goal =) gotta feed my baby...  so i found out that the city of chicago will sponsor me if i choose to work with them come time to graduate. its nice to know that i have a back up plan i suppose but i dont want to work with the city if it means working anywhere near the proximity of my stupid old dorsey man. id rather go back home and work there rather than working with him (ok maybe not, but its close enough to the truth) i am sure i wont be doing work under dorsey though if i get hired on. i will make sure to be put into a database team. since i wont wanna be doing crap work with dorsey.  anyway, another networking event went stellar. another CIO and a few more names to call. i have a list of people that i need to touch base with and i hope to get to some of them by the end of this week. next week i will be meeting with another CIO and this time, it will be in a freaking restaurant. what the heck do i do then? i mean, whats the 'proper' code of conduct when networking in a restaurant? i suppose i will be eating salad.  ok, hopefully acxiom will hire me *please please*

						   hehehe ....&nbsp; so for the past week or so, mike and i have been planning a vacation to disneyworld. ive done the whole disneyworld thing before but this time, it would be different because:  &nbsp;    we are going to be staying IN one of the disney resorts, so i will get pampered and wont miss internet very much since they have wireless hotspots everywhere  the resort we choose will be facing a lake, and so we will get to do boat rides and cruises  we will be staying there for an entire freaking week -- we will get to go to all the best parts, take our own sweet time exploring   I CANT WAIT!! and its really cute watching mike plan this entire thing -- the extensive research he has already done (and we all know how he loves doing research on the internet) and how pumped he is with the different kinds of activities we could do while we are there ... awwww... *patpat*

						   there are a lot of things that have been said about america that have made little or no sense watsoever, but the one thing that i have noticed is the fact that they are big on opportunities. they like it when things exist in their lives and they have that opportunity to seize the moment to do something with those existing things. it doesnt matter that they never ever DO seize the moment ... its just the fact that the opportunities  exist  and they can  seize  it whenever they feel like it.  i dont know whether i am frustrated or annoyed or just .. indifferent about this issue. i would think that i am more annoyed and frustrated than indifferent, because otherwise i wouldnt be talking about it. its great and fine and dandy that these americans like to be surrounded by opportunities -- what humanity wouldnt. opportunities are great, they are wonderful. in fact, its better than wonderful. you work hard to ensure that those opportunities last and wont leave you in a moments notice. the not seizing the opportunities part is what gets me, because it feels like things are taken for granted. and i am very much annoyed with that, because i am so used to working my butt off just to be given a slight bit of opportunity and the moment that opportunity comes knocking on my door, i will seize it without a moments breath. i dont know whether its a culture thing, or an upbringing thing -- i HATE seeing opportunities come by without ever being taken advantage of or made full use of. it feels like the opportunity is being wasted. and taken for granted. and i guess i just dont like thinking that things can be taken for granted without us actually having appreciating it completely.  maybe im just worried and anxious about graduating next year. and this is why i get annoyed with people with opportunities who dont take advantage of them. i think i am just getting to the point where i am coming to realize that this journey will not be an easy one, and its only just begun. the rejection letters are going to come as soon as i commence my search, and i dont ever know if the opportunity will ever come my way.   maybe there is also a bit on envy in the ways americans live their lives. that they are so used to being pampered and so used to having nice things, things that make sense and things that make their lives so much easier to live, that every little thing needs to be in existant and needs to be perfect, because they havent lived otherwise. and i envy them because they have never had to live lives that dont come with opportunities, not necessarily. you have to work your butt off to get anywhere, and i guess i am just sick and tired of it all.  why cant just everything be handed to me on a silver platter?   in a way i suppose i am grateful. in a way, i am more aware of other people's lives and i can be more sensitive to what they have been through. in more ways than one, i know where i want to be later on in life, to be able to live an easy and almost-perfect life like these americans, but in so many ways, i just want to yell and scream ...     "appreciate, and dont take things for granted!!!"

						   *ugh*  i cant believe the reason why i cant sleep is because of my stupid retarded boss. i keep tossing and turning in my sleep because i am half afraid he will show up at my doorstep, yelling at me for not being at a 1pm meeting that he didnt tell me about (because he expects me to either know HIS schedule or be psychic), and half weary that he will demand a nose-wipe-a-down and lean-to-the-left.  i am sooooooooooooooo tired... and pretty much burnt-out.

						   my oracle professor gave us a cigar for being cool -- well actually, he asked people who smoked cigar to raise their hands and come up front to pick up some churchill cigars because hes in celebratory mode: wife gave birth to a beautiful 9lb baby girl. so he had to share his joy with the world.  been extremely busy the past couple of days. database design project due next week and we are still finalizing the conceptual and logical models. teammates are hopeless, they are either lazy or numskulls. but hey, im done next week and wont have to worry about this for a loong, loong time (well, until september) cant believe five weeks approaching. before long, fall quarter will start and i will be scrambling for on-campus jobs.  if i maintain my 4.0 till the end of winter quarter, i will be invited to join the honor society -- delta upsilon pi epsilon. well, the cut is 3.75 but i want to graduate with distinction too (3.9) getting an A- will not help. so i gotta keep the 4.0  networked my ass off the entire week and for it, i have appointments with three CIOs, one senior manager engineer, one software developer, and one international student who got himself a consultant job. pretty good for a week's worth of work. gotta up the networking next week. and start looking at job boards. still working on making the resume stellar. but at this point, i think being stellar isnt going to cut it -- i need nepotism.  not sure whats going on this weekend. all i know is i gotta get mike his bday present, and i need to complete my database creation. i need sleep. and dorsey is being a dick, again. what else is new.  i feel like im missing something, that i forgot to do something. i think it might be the job application. i should research more. bleh

						   happy fourth of july. spent the day/weekend lazying and hanging with people who strap army figurines to fireworks and blasting them off the fence of some patio (actually, the patio of our british-fathered friend) and for the first time in many years, i went swimming and was almost drowned by my own boyfriend -- since he was that nice =) it was fun, i forgot how fun swimming and fucking around was, i need to find that swimming pool in ray-meyers. what should happen is mike should get a house someplace with a swimming pool and i will come around often to swim in it...  back to crap tomorrow. being responsible.

						   satisfied my electronic buying cravings of the week -- replaced the broken JVC DVD player and bought a  urlLink new Toshiba DVD player . and now i have to start listing out the electronics that i want and crave, because i am sick that way and must make a list so i can daydream and fantasize about buying/owning them.  1.  urlLink Panasonic DVD-LS50 7">Portable DVD Player   mm... uber-licious. i want one and will benefit greatly from my boring el rides everyday.   2.  urlLink Fujifilm FinePix F410 3.14MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom   cute .. but i like the following better..    3.  urlLink Sony Cyber-shot 5.0-Megapixel Digital Camera   should see that commercial with this digicam .. it is BEYOOOOTIFUL!   4.  urlLink Canon PowerShot 4.0-Megapixel Digital Camera   this one would probably be a better bet ..    5.  urlLink Toshiba 27" Stereo TV with Flat Picture Tube - Silver   perhaps for the bedroom ...    i also have a HUMONGOUS list of DVDs to buy too ... i have waaayyyyyy too much things to want. but the newest one on my have-to-buy list is  urlLink Das Experiment  -- those who havent seen it, WILL have to see it. its fucking awesome.

						   i think i am hooked on books such as the one i am reading currently -- the rule of four. the premise isnt that great, its not a fast moving action and nobody is on the lookout to kill anybody else (well thats not entirely true, but you get what i mean). the thing that hooks me to books like this is the fact that the protagonists try to solve age-old books (the one this time round is called the hypnerotomachia poliphili by francesco colonna) and i just LOVE how that book actually exists and that renaissance scholars have spent centuries trying to decipher it and only have been able to recently, due to the complexity of the text and the nested cipherings that are included within.   cant wait to read more and figure out what crypt is buried with what secret tellings..

						   speaking of metrosexuality .. wohoo look at my cool cufflinks, i think they're way chic. i think i like this whole cufflink thing, I used to think cufflinks were for conservative old men with tweed jackets and snootish demeanors, but just like everything, the style and manner define the trend you follow.    oh and by the way, i'm now officially a "Technology Consultant". I think that's a chic, hip, trendy title, nothing to boring and mundane as "business consultant" or "management consultant", and yet nothing too geeky like "technical analyst" or "Technical consultant". shows my passion for technology and yet highlights that i'm not purely a technical geek with a mountain-dew-cum-pizza pot belly and and thick glasses and wild long dandruffy hair  yeah yeah fine, i'm vain. so what. i have pride in myself. something somewhat lacking in the local population nowadays. makes women here so unattractive

						   hola!  taking the day off work today because i feel "sick". have other things to do at home aka have to ponder next strategic move as to how am going to approach more top level people. have memo in version 2 -- all set to go! got me a few more top peeps to approach and since its now august again, can use ten more tokens to bug ten more people/mentors.  ellen barry is the coolest chick in IT ever! shes the CIO for the metropolitan pier and exposition authority (MPEA) and deals with the coolest new technologies you can possibly think of. she is working with internet2 in mccormick place trying to get the gaming community to blast off with tournaments, getting the medical community to do demos to their potential clients using radiological scans and watever else medicinal .. and i totally envy her! its good to have her on my side tho -- shes a really nice person and really passionate about what she is doing. lucky lucky. maybe she can hook me up with something or someone, and possibly lead me on to other good and wonderful things.  spoke to a few peeps in the city. some think that bobs company chows ass, others think theyre mediocre, and some thought they did a good job. what do i do if i was given an offer? do i accept it knowing that they are not perfect and might even have some bad reputation, or do i go with it because regardless of their bad reputation, the check is cut and they still make money? ethics versus paycheck .... tough call *smug grin*  havent spoken to parents and siblings for a while. wondering if they are surviving. had a series of dream about them meeting mike for the first time -- some turned out really well, but the one last night went awfully bad. apparently mike lost his legs and was in a really interesting looking wheel chair that was low to the ground, and was mildly rude when parents came to greet him (or was it the other way round, cant remember) either way, this will happen in june of next year, and i honestly am quite excited ... heheh ..  finally weather turnaround. from our wonderful hot and humid 92 to rainy and humid 68. cant complain, letting the AC go for today and am opening windows to let fresh air in. must get rid of stupid smoke smell.  gym calls me.

						   the meeting with Bob was really great. he was trying to get me to come and work at his company because he thinks i will be a great fit there. it was kinda funny to see someone trying to sell me a job. if he only knew how i busted my ass looking for something, it would have been easy work for him. no need to sell, no need to convince. i am already interested. as of now. but hey, if i keep at it like this, i will get a few more, who knows. *crosses fingers*
