      Saw 21Grams and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind this weekend. Both are very heavy movies and you leave the theatre feeling like you got something out of the experience. Eternal Sunshine has definitely made its way into my top five movies of all time. Check it out!

      "One is too small of a number to achieve greatness." -John Maxwell  Went to a team-building conference in the Woodlands hosted by John Maxwell yesterday.  The main focus was his new book, The 17 Indisputable Laws of Teamwork. Although the surface of the topics revolved around building a winning team, the core was based on spiritual ideas. One that struck me the most and in a way summarizes the conference, is for you to change your mental process and start focusing on the strengths in people rather than their weaknesses. Building on the strengths of people around you contributes greatly to your own strength and growth, which makes sense at work, at home, and anywhere else. It's great that people are starting to see that assembly-line mentalities aren't as efficient as they seem.

      Have you tried to really connect with someone important in your life to find out that they are on a totally different wave–length? One, that completely revolves around their world and the logic they create to fit their own needs. You start to ask yourself, why is this person behaving this way?  Sadly, you figure out that this person has been that way all along, and it is you who is actually starting to see things differently. Your discovery becomes quite comforting, but what is the remedy of all the scars you picked up along the way. Most importantly, where do you find the strength to believe in that person again and welcome them into our life again. Jesus died on the cross that we learn to forgive.   connect to disconnect the redial button is fading the static makes it hard to hear redialing again does anybody live here? this voice sounds familiar but the static is jumbling the words i keep trying to connect disconnecting the numbers are smearing from dripping sweat  the seven becomes a one time is passing— redialing. i connect to the wrong number once again. I pick up the handset and redial the number.

      Jammin to Bob Marley. My yorkie, Charlie hangin out on my lap while I'm finishing up some design work on my G4. My wisdom tooth has been coming in all weekend, so I'm working at home today. I really miss working at home—somehow you become more in touch with your creative self in t-shirt and socks rather than in an office building—the air you breathe tends to be a little drier in office buildings. I'm pretty lucky though, I'm surrounded with orange and lime green walls all day at work and a group of really good people. I finished most of my work for the day. I think I'm gonna have my low carb peach yogurt afternoon snack and read my daily walk bible for some soul nourishment. Turn your lights down low…let your love come shinin into our lives again…

      Dreaming of a white wedding. It's all so exciting.  I feel like a little girl in a huge playground with the confidence of a tiger.  Everything feels so right and I am ever grateful for every moment of it.   After work yesterday, I met up with a good friend at The Richmond Arms. Over some Absolute Mandarin, we talked about Chris working some illustration magic for the invitations. Yes! I want us as superheroes on the cover of our wedding invitations. We earned it darn it!  It's gonna be quite a challenge to make it colorful and keep it pure and tasteful, so Paul and I are gonna have to put in some of our own magic into this one…   Lesson of the day: Break those boundaries people—art can be classy and outrageous, even in a wedding!

      Do you ever get this feeling that you're carrying alot of weight?   And when you think about it, weight can be good for you if you consciously choose to carry it. The downfall of weight is when it is imposed on you and you start to sink into the source of it. Sinking deeper and deeper and deeper…wait… I have been here before and I can find my way back you tell yourself. You trace your steps to find your way home. Slowly with ease. Focus. Here you are again! How silly it is to lose yourself in imposed static weight when weightlessness can carry you on its wings and take your soul on journeys that lift you closer to God.  It's time to go out for a walk outside and enjoy a beautiful Saturday! You should too…

      I had lunch with my uncle yesterday in between the craziness of a hectic work day. He just got back from a four week trip to Greece and London. They arranged to be in Greece on Easter, which is the biggest cultural event in Geece. It's a three day marathon of tradition and spirituality. That stuff is much fun! Girls and boys exchanging looks across tables in cafes, anticipating the summer with it's warmth and it's beaches. Summer loves… London, the capital of all cosmopolitan cities. Not too different from New York City. A great experience in small dozes. The fight of everyday is really not worth it. Life is too short for that kind of life. I'd rather be in warm climate where the pace is slow and space is plentiful and one has room to dream and ponder.

      It's my baby's birthday this weekend! I have to watch not too spoil him too much… I made reservations at Bossa in downtown for 8:00pm tomorrow night (he loves their martinis) and I love to see him happy, so Bossa it is! I'm so excited! I can't share the rest of the night—it's private…

      It's one of those days…Sitting here at work going through the drills of designing—exporting from Illustrator to Photoshop, reading the news on CNN.com in Safari, stopping for a moment to print from Acrobat, getting up to get the print out from the printer, back to my computer and to Illustrator. Norah Jones in the backround to remind me of a slow pace. Resolve one deadline and attack the next. You always get back what you put in, I remind myself. All of these experiences are part of growth and part of being on a path that I choose for myself. I make my own decisions. I am learning and challenging myself everyday. Working towards a goal…growing…learning… I know I will feel better when I pick up a soothing tchai tea beverage. I will take my dog out to the park this afternoon when I get home and I'll find a bench to sit on and read a book. It'll be a reward well–earned.

      Easter Sunday. Calm. Wet. Grey. I'm hypnotized by the continuous rhythm of rain drops pouring down from the heavens. Still frames flash in fast forward in my mind—too many for me to stop and think about. Emotions are pouring through my body and I'm racing to catch time. The faster I run to catch it, the faster it runs ahead. Every moment is so precious.

      Memorial Day weekend…sitting at home watching TV. Still trying to process Michael Moore's, Capturing the Friedman's. Watched it last night and spent all day working out how I felt about it. Did he do it or did he not? Has culture completely gone mad in this country? Still trying to get the group leep frog visual out of my head. Gross! See the movie–the dude is such an incredible filmmaker.

      Been looking for scored blank invitations all day. Sometimes design is an awesome tool that can make a difference in people's lives,  and sometimes I feel like I'm just a tool for the corporate world to capitalize on. I guess it's part of being young and paying your dues.  I'm working on my personal website. it makes me feel good. I am able to document my life.  "You can't know your future if you don't know your past".  It's important to grab some of the pieces before they slip by.

      It's 6:30 PM at The Richmond Arms. The pub is slowly starting to fill with people anxious for time to slow down and their beer mugs refilled. Everyone around the table is hanging onto their beers for dear life. After a few sips, someone builds up the courage to start the meaningless chain of conversation. The same movie references circulate around the table—The Simpsons, Troy, South Park, Zoolander, Friday, Passion, The Chapelle Show. The person who knows the most movie references goes home a champion. If we run out of movie references, we move to music references, bouncing between solo artists, record labels, bands, and genres. We engross ourselves in entertainment to escape from what is real. Why reach out to humanity and feel what is real when you can simply press play from your couch and get instant numbness. We rush to the pub to exchange macho laughter and go back home to do more work so that we can buy more movies. Something seems to be missing.

      Kirby suggested that I start a corinneberberi.com for all the Corinne fans in the world. It's kinda wierd having a site named after yourself…I'll stick to culturekitchen.us for now…  He then continued to do a search on the web for his name…and several appear…he's happy… He's made it! He is here—Google acknowledges his existence! That is the American dream!

      I fall in love deeper and deeper as each day goes by. I feel whole when I'm with him. We watched movies all day Saturday and Sunday I worked on my website in the bedroom while he laid in bed with Charlie. Rest was much needed this weekend. We replenished what little was left of our resources from the week before.

      The new Apple Cinema Display is out!  urlLink www.apple.com      I'm totally pumped about the 30 inch being out! Can you imagine designing on a 30 inch flat panel and having all that room to play with. I would totally be glued to my computer all day all night!  Anyway—here's the description: Feast your eyes on more than four million pixels in the first high-resolution 30-inch flat panel display designed for the personal computer. The Apple Cinema Display line features a gorgeous new anodized aluminum enclosure to complement the Power Mac G5 or PowerBook G4 and includes PC-compatible 20-inch and 23-inch models. The state of the art starts at $1299.  It's so freakin cool! High tech gadgets really get me worked up, especially when my baby tells me about them!

      Have you read the news lately?  What in the world has been going on the past five years? It's like a downward spiral from hell. I can't even do my daily rituals of reading the news with my morning coffee without feeling nauseated. Want to know what my thought s are on war? These are my thoughts on war…ready? IT SUCKS!!!! I grew up during the eighties in Beirut, Lebanon and I was glad to see that things were starting to slow down a little. Sure enough, people start to think they're tough again! A shell landed in my best friend's dad in his sleep when I was eleven and I can tell you that things like that are better left alone. When people are abnoxious and loud about their support for Bush, well I just want to stick my thumb up their nose and tell them that they're morons!

Yeah—totally addicted to music…  I was getting very impatient with the rain chez-nous a tropical Houston (it's very exotic down here) and suddenly the right tune comes on and transports me to another place. THANK YOU Nina Simone and Tori—you always come through for me during the tuff times of bad music.

      Dodge Ball   http://www.dodgeballmovie.com/  I laughed out loud at the theater (it has to be really funny for me to do that, by the way). It was seriously funny—I can't wait for the DVD to come out! Watching Ben Stiller walking around in purple Spandex tights had me glued to the movie—the two teams training for a dodge ball tournament was just over the top funny. I had a lot of fun watching it.

      King Solomon built a temple for the Lord his savior with all the riches of his land. God asked Solomon what he wished in return. Solomon's wish was for God to give him the knowledge and wisdom to rule his kingdom in the name of God. Solomon didn't wish for money or eternal life. With the wisdom and knowledge that God gave him, Solomon made his kingdom the most prosperous of all the lands and all came to worship in his temple.

      It's been a long time since I've watched the clock ticking.  When I was sixteen I spent hours standing on the ledge of our balcony looking down at the winding road at the base of the steep hill. I counted time second by second for him to come and save me. I wished my hair was long enough to braid and throw down to him. I would have done anything for my prince charming with the green eyes and the silky biceps. Sometimes he came a few hours late, sometimes he never came but I kept on waiting.  I'm only twenty five now and I rarely have time to watch time. It seems that time is watching me and laughing.

      Bjork Voices "Medulla"  "Instruments are so over," says Bjork of her new, purely vocal album, Medulla, due out late August/early September.  "Every album I've done, the minute that it's done, I feel really lubricated and, like, 'Wow, now I can write an album in five minutes,'" she says. "And I just want to find out if that's just a fantasy or if it's true."  That's awesome! I'm totally pumped about that!  In other news…it's been insane on the "planning our wedding front". Paul and I go on daily rollercoaster rides with trying to figure out if we should just go through with the wedding and share our joy with evryone or just go to Jamaica and have a romantic exchange of vows—just the two of us…  Jamaica doesn't sound too bad, does it?

      Paul wanted me to make a note of this…"can I pop your browser open?"-my boss. I was there, he didn't mean it that way—the man is married and goes to church every Sunday. Anyway, things have been interesting for both of us at work…the great thing is that we're both alive in each others hearts—kinda keeps you on track! Charlie, our dog has been out of his kennel all week and we're maintaining  the off the bed policy. He' s growing up our little Chantini…he really is a great dog (when he's well-fed and not sleepy). Paul keeps telling me that all yorkies have attitude…he wants a boxer to wrestle with. I can already see them running in the grass and Charlie trying to catch up trailing in the back…

          Turkish coffee at Teta's   Paul woke me up at 5:00 a.m. screaming from a nightmare. I couldn't go back to sleep, so I made a pot of freshly ground Starbucks coffee and headed to the gym. Today is shoulders and legs day, which I really enjoy, but my workout wasn't quite the same without the cardio. I have to rest my ankle for a few days, or until the swelling goes down. When I was done it was 7:30 a.m. which is perfect time for Turkish coffee at grandma's (teta is what I call her in Lebanese).  Teta is in her late seventies, but we manage to talk about politics, fashion, love, health, life, and the strange thing is that we both understand each other as though we are the same age. I hear all about her physical ailments. She covers everything from the arthritis in her left wrist to high blood pressure and cholesterol. "The human body is like a machine", she tells me "you have to keep oiling it or else it rusts". I try to remember to oil it. I tell her about my Bikram yoga classes and she always encourages and praises me for pushing myself and trying new things.  Today was a different day though. I was on a mission when I went to Teta's. For years now, every time I visit, she tells me that she's getting old and can't keep up with all the house work, even though the house is spotless. There's a cleaning lady that comes next door every Friday, and I was on a mission to talk her into coming to clean on Fridays and to convince my grandpa (Jeddo) to accept and bust out with the checkbook (which would be the harder mission). I drank as mush coffee as I could and went for it…and got her to come next Friday at eleven and got grandpa to agree to it!   Teta is very excited about the arrangement, but I made her promise that she can't get picky about the cleaning and to just be glad that someone is helping out. She promised. It's more mental than anything else—she likes to get pampered and at her age I think she deserves it!

      I hate "that time of the month"–my head is pounding and my dog kept me up all night sneezing. On top of it all my ankle hurts from working out too hard and I have to "dazzle" my client with the right color studies for his logo. "Make it look medical, but fun". Right…I'm a designer, not a magician.  Thinking of Lance Armstrong and how much he kicked ass will get me through the day. Thanks Lance for reminding us what the human body and mind is capable of with the right attitude. You really rock!

          YEY! Here's a bit of the article (which is in the August issue of W). For more info, go to  urlLink bjork.com   "I just got really bored with instruments. I started doing everything with my voice. Then suddenly I didn't want to work with any musicians, which is a bit weird. I only wanted to work with vocalists." She was inspired, she says, by paganism, and the rather esoteric idea of returning to a universe that is entirely human -- without tools or religion or nationalities. "I wanted the record to be like muscle, blood, flesh," she says, pumping her fist. "We could be in a cave somewhere and one person would start singing, and another person would sing a beat and then the next person sing a melody, and you could just kind of be really happy in your cave. It's quite rootsy," she adds, rolling the "r" for emphasis in her native fashion."

      What is going on with fashion you guys? I keep seeing thirteen year old girls running around with their butts hanging out of their one inch frilly skirts. It's freaking me out! I'm at Target shopping the other day and I see two gorgeous bodies standing next to me practically half naked and I think to myself, "wow, I wonder if these girls are 'professionals' and suddenly they turn around and I instantly feel sick. They are barely thirteen…running around the store giggling and laughing about nothing and anything—they can't control their laughter—they're kids! I try to forget this experience, but a few days later Paul and I go to the mall and the frilly skirts and barely legal shorts are by the dozen! It makes me so furious that their parents are allowing them to leave the house dressed that way—and we wonder why there are so many perverts out there. Hollywood bimbo, Paris Hilton, is to blame and I hope this fad passes quickly before teen pregnancy sky rockets in the next few years. There are enough single mothers in this world. Bless their hearts that they try so hard to be everything for their kids to make up for their mistake, but it's just not enough! I object to teen nudity in public!

              Fifties Bellydancing pinups.    "Locked in this dance is a secret language that tells the story of women's  lives... their passions and their spirituality, their sacrifices, their joys, their  intuitions, their emotional life drama." ---Delilah         "The Gypsy Dancer appears to be free from the societal constraints. The Gypsy as  the Wild Woman archetype has magical powers, powers which make her dangerous. She is  out-of-control, or at least beyond the control of the patriarchy. She evokes fear,  especially in the subconscious where the Wild Woman lurks within us all. We are afraid to  let her out because we may loose control." ---Laurel Victoria Gray

      We made a huge purchase. Paul and I went to the mall to buy a cross and chain for him from urlLink  James Avery . His faith is growing stronger and he's finding peace with his relationship with God (which saves me alot of work). I'm so proud of him for taking this step and feel very hopeful for the future. After an hour or so of mixing and matching crosses and chains, we found the perfect combo that had all the elements he was looking for (which surprised me because he's very picky). As soon as we stepped out of the store we very quickly got lured to the gigantic Starbucks planted in the middle of the mall where we got wired on iced lattes and went outside to enjoy the sun.      The cross we both chose.       One of the faces he makes (he's a pro).       Chillin at Strabucks.       Taking pictures in the parking lot.       Paul, California dreamin.

          The movie is disappointing but Hallie Barry and Sharon Stone were worth watching the movie for me. Check out  urlLink catwoman.com  for more pics. Oh my God do these women have perfect bodies! Loved Catwoman's apartment and the artwork in it. Her shoulders, chest, waist, and hips are perfection! It really motivated me to wake up very early and hit the gym.

         "I'd rather not be liked for being me than be liked for not being me."    I was going through some words on  urlLink dictionary.com  and I found my both my first and last name.    \Co`rinne"\  (k?`r?n"), n. (Zo["o]l.) The common gazelle (Gazella dorcas). One of several small, swift, elegantly formed species of antelope, of the genus Gazella [Written also korin.]   Bar·ba·ry  (bärb-r, -br) A region of northern Africa on the Mediterranean coast between Egypt and the Atlantic Ocean. Settled by Berbers in the 2nd millennium B.C., it was conquered by Arabs in the 7th century A.D. From the 16th to the 19th century it was used as a base by pirates who raided ships in the Mediterranean Sea and extracted tribute from the European powers trading in the area.   So I was named after a swift antelope from North Africa…I wonder if my parents knew… Wow. I like it!

          Paul went to the Museum of Fine Arts yesterday and bought me a Madonna de Guadalupe mouse pad. It's been a while since he's done that—it's very sweet that he was thinking of me. Relationships are not easy. They're alot of work and you have to keep nurturing them during the ups and the downs.   The Roman Catholic church believes that the Virgin Mary is the path to Christ. Every encounter with her can only result in an encounter with Christ Himself.

      I recently noticed that I'm becoming magnetized to green. I feel the best when I see green, which is strange because in my late teens it was purple and my early twenties it was red. I'm not sure what all this means, but I've decided to trace the presence of green in my life. When we were young, everyone was busy building forts and playing hide and go seek, but I was more interested in hangin out with my own little gang. How could I have forgotten you guys!      Grasshoppers have fascinating eyes and they're legs make them easy to hold and explore.       Frogs (especially green ones) always look moist and fresh, and they give off alot of whymsical energy when they hop around.       Ladybugs remind me that I am a girl, it's easy to forget when you're a kid who grew in nature with total freedom.   I was born in the spring. Blooming nature everywhere you looked in combination with the month of the Virgin Mary and my birthday made May my favorite month of the year. I picked wild flowers for my mom and talked to grasshoppers from morning to night. I had long conversations with all the grasshoppers in the woods and sometimes they came home with me as candidates for adoption.  My mom never let me keep any of the grasshoppers, but she tolerated the green frogs from the water pond. Out of all the creatures, frogs seemed the cleanest to me because their skin was always moist and shiny. Their lime green color stimulated my senses and I couldn't get enough of looking at them. Butterflies looked magical, but they were frail and had no purpose but to flutter and within a few minutes lost my interest. I was much more fascinated with cocoons and silk worms. Ladybugs were also cool because they were subtle and when I least expected it flew away. They always surprised me and kept me interested.

      Paul and I went to my office last weekend to pack up my stuff for the last time and get going on a new journey. it was sad, but felt a little like Office Space sometimes. I did work with some awesome people—Sherron, Josh, Mitch, and Lawton—I'm gonna miss you guys!    Me and my desk at the studio.     My dual processor G5 and flat panel for the last time. I setup an archive drive and delete corinne as a user on 'The One's' computer. I wished it good luck, thanked it for all the good times, and hoped that it blesses its next user.     Hello new home office computer! Boy are you much cuter!       I'm totally pumped about the curtains, the lighting, and the dresscode freedom in the new office!      The living space, which will be a conference area.      The heart of the home, our little kitchen area.

      Been listening to internet radio the past few months,  urlLink 'Radio 365' —it's only five bucks a month and has tons of stations. I like to expose myself to different genres of music—as a designer, music influences my creativity, so iTunes is on all day on my computer. I've been listening to the  Sirens of Song  playlist on Radio 365, which plays only  female vocals—Bjork, Tori Amos, Massive Attack, Everything But The Girl, Poe, Zero 7, Natalie Imbruglia, Sara McLachlin, and lots more. Another good playlist is  Easytempo Latitudes —Cafe Del Mar, Air, Tosca—the good chilled out stuff!  Anyway, I painted our office Olive Green yesterday. It looks awesome in there now with burgandy eastern curtains and of course, lots of cool lights!

          I've recently been reading debates on gay marriage. Here's a quote that I came across about the subject that was kinda funny, "Forget the rice. (We're on Atkins.) No his-and-his towels. (Nothing matches in our house.) Just give us Viagra—and wish us well". It's pretty simple, gays want to be able to share their lives together in a legitmate legal way. I really don't understand what the big deal is if two people want a legal commitment—(of course heterosexual couples may advise against that). Marriage is not easy and if they're willing to fight for it and make it work, why not?! Wouldn't it be better if horny gay guys were married and in love instead of rebelling from rejection and spreading STDs? I would say gays are what they are and they can't change it, so why not let them be part of society. I'd rather a gay couple care for a child than alcoholic abusive straight parents, don't you? One can get into arguments of morality and society and debate for years, but in the end it's very simple, why not?  Here's some advice from Richard Goldstein:  Hello, queer lovers, wherever you are.  You can have your wedding cake and eat it, too.  Marriage is what you make of it,  Not what it makes of you.

          Freedom is what you do with what's been done to you. —Jean Paul Sartre    Yey…now I can be ME! Lemme explain…well…my job as a graphic designer at my design firm is no longer as of Friday (yeah…I got laid off.) The corporate machine has devoured yet another small business with giant dreams. Yep, "we're downsizing" (I'd rather not get into the details of my feelings about all that coprprate stuff…I might get carried away). It was very sad to hear the news, but I've realized that this is a great opportunnity for me to jump into the large list of things that I've been wanting to do for months. I'm very excited about getting back to working on my website and various other creative projects that have been on hold. I also want to read lots and lots of books and drink lots of coffee and walk my dog and and cook and breathe and laugh and be me!   Paul and I rented  The Butterfly Effect  on Friday. I don't understand the bad reviews, I thought it was pretty good—it had me interested from beginning to end…and it wasn't Ashton that did it for me either. I got upset at Blockbuster for another reason though. Underneath four shelves of  Master and Commander , were two copies of Monsieur Ibrahim, that were both out.

      I was browsing through  urlLink 'The Village Voice'  half asleep hoping that time will pass slightly faster when I came across this headline,   Cow brains banned from cosmetics, supplements  . Holy shit…they use cow brains in cosmetics. Excuse my ignorance, but I had no idea and I'm pretty grossed out about it!    WASHINGTON (AP) — Closing loopholes in protections against mad cow disease, the Food and Drug Administration on Friday banned brains and other cattle parts that could carry the disease's infectious agent from use in cosmetics and dietary supplements…The ban affects products made from animals 30 months of age and older, the age in which the government has said the brain-wasting disease can be found. The restrictions prohibit the use of the brain and spinal cord, where the misshapen proteins blamed for mad cow disease are considered most likely to be found. The banned parts from the older animals also include skulls, eyes, and nervous system tissue close to the spinal cord.

          Bill with some mean lookin shades.   Well finally someone is speaking up for a culture headed down the wrong path. I salute Bill Cosby for standing up to say that things aren't excatly going in the right direction for African Americans today. Read what he has to say on  urlLink cnn.com . Chris Rock briefly touches on the subject during his comedy tours, but the message gets lost between stripper jokes and obscene language. Dave Chapelle's message gets lost in between getting high and big titty jokes. And Oprah isn't as cool as Puff Daddy. Someone had to stand up and say Enough! The truth is that the new generation has no appreciation for all the sacrifice and hardships of their ancestors that fought for civil rights and liberties to give opportunities for the generations to come. Young African Americans have the opportunity to be equal and free and they should take that make it happen for themselves and for their children. Buy a book instead of a designer shirt—it will take you alot further.

      Yorkies need my help. They need a new marketing campaign! Have you seen the hideously designed sites online? They make these poor dogs look like they're bred for grooming. Tacky!  Yorkies are very animated and fun and chilled out, not fluffy and pink and floral. Check out  urlLink  'yorkies.com' .Yuk!      Yorkshire Terrier Country of Origin: Great Britain Maximum Height: 9 Inches Maximum Weight: 7 Pounds Coat Color: Black/Tan, Dark Steel-Blue Natural Instincts: Watchdog     Yorkies are the number 6 top bread in the world! That's why Charlie's so darn arrogant! I can't wait til his coat starts turning golden. He still thinks raw hide is the coolest thing on the planet. You can't get anywhere near him when he's chewing on his bone. I wish he had a little sister to play with. Wait…I have to stop myself right here. I can't even keep up with one of him. And by the way, he looks nothing like the yorkie in this picture…he's always on the lookout for dirty water puddles to jump into and run inside after an hour of tricking him and jumps right on the furniture. Yep…that's Charlie.    The Charlie.     Charlie giving the "look of steele" to the camera.    Charlie having his time with his bone.

             Ed Ruscha at the Whitney Museum    I so wish that I could see Ed Ruscha at the Whitney. He's one of Paul and I's favorite modern artists/designers. I found a review of his work in  urlLink 'The Village Voice'  that nailed his work.   It's a fine point. Ruscha's work has always had—in the East at least—an ambivalent, blunt, yet slippery edge. Not exactly Pop, sort of minimalistic, somewhat conceptual, slightly narrative, and rather illusionistic, it slips out of every possible pigeonhole, including that of photography—even though the serial photos have something in common with those of Bernd and Hilla Becher. Despite Ruscha's hovering words that function as objects in space, and his ribbony or folded lettering that levitates above smoggy grounds, indeterminate planes, shallow space, or its own shadow, his work always retains a flat, noirish opacity—not perspectivally but mentally.   A few weeks ago I started a recycled journal project where I was writing the first things that popped into my mind about my childhood memories of playing in nature as a little person. I found that it made things fresh for me again in the midst of working eleven hour days…paying bills…living in a capitalist country doing capitalist things…I found myself again through the words on the little pieces of paper for a few hours at least. As we're watching Cold Mountain this weekend, a line stood out in my mind, "how do I melt the ice around my heart that this war has brought?".

          The New York Times has a review of  urlLink 'Monsieur Ibrahim' .  It's out on DVD! I'm so exciteed—I didn't get a chance to see it at the theater—now I can enjoy it in the comfort of my bed. Omar Sharif has to be one of the greatest actors alive during my lifetime in my opinion. I remember as a little kid seeing him in Doctor Zivago which was pretty intense (he had those deep Arabic eyes that told stories in a glance). He's an amazing actor that really rocks the house and represents Middle Eastern culture as it really is—internally rich and beautiful.

      Greece won the Greece vs. Portugal in the European cup final yesterday which aired live in Houston at 2:00 PM. Paul metup with his dad at 12:30 at the Richmond Arms pub where they had four beers each. When the game ended, we headed out to Berry Hill in Montrose where we metup with Elie and Fotis (who is Greek) and had four marghartitas each, with a few extras for Paul and Fotis. We hung out and danced and got pretty drunk. We then headed over to The Social to watch the fireworks where we had four more margharitas and champagne we brought back from our drunken friend Edward who could no longer hold the champagne bottle and keep balance all at once. DJ Champa rocked the house and luckily we took pictures of the fireworks for us to see the next day. We then made a stop at Whataburger where we ordered a whataburger meal, thick n hearty meal (whatasized) and a strawberry shake for Paul.  Here we are at the start of the night…

      My baby brother turned 22 yesterday. Unlike the very emotional birthdays of the last few years, this one was fairly calm and peaceful. It was a new step in a new direction for him and for our little family. I saw it in everyone's eyes. By the end of the day we were well-fed and very euphoric. On the menu were quails, grilled red snapper, filet mignon, tabouli, hummos, and fries and to drink - carrot juice, johnny walker black label, and chardonnay. Yep…we all took a happy nap afterwards.

         I read a review in the New York Times about Charles Bukowski's new biography. Should be interesting just to find out about his life as a beat writer in the fifties. The documentary combines television interviews of him before he died in 1994 and reminiscences of former drinking buddies, fellow writers, and his second wife Linda, the keeper of his flame. Looking forward to it.  Here's one of his:  bluebird  there's a bluebird in my heart that wants to get out but I'm too tough for him, I say, stay in there, I'm not going to let anybody see you. there's a bluebird in my heart that wants to get out but I pur whiskey on him and inhale cigarette smoke and the whores and the bartenders and the grocery clerks never know that he's in there. there's a bluebird in my heart that wants to get out but I'm too tough for him, I say, stay down, do you want to mess me up? you want to screw up the works? you want to blow my book sales in Europe? there's a bluebird in my heart that wants to get out but I'm too clever, I only let him out at night sometimes when everybody's asleep. I say, I know that you're there, so don't be sad. then I put him back, but he's singing a little in there, I haven't quite let him die and we sleep together like that with our secret pact and it's nice enough to make a man weep, but I don't weep, do you?

      There are the good times and then there are the times when nothing goes right and all faith and hope are lost. In hip hop they call it "drama" and in rock it's being "crucified"…I call it "very sucky" when nothing goes right. So I just wait for it to pass…    Sometimes time at night is unbearable.    My partner in crime…Charlie. Also waiting.

      Cool stuff's been going on in the career end of things. Not only am I working with our old sales guy in the comfort of my own home, but yesterday my old boss contacted me for some freelance work, which is pretty flattering. I metup with him at Starbucks around 4:00 PM, but here is what happened as I was waiting…  A guy that looks like he works out too much, takes too many steriods, and looks at himself in the mirror every chance he gets sits next to me with his laptop. He has a huge bandaid on his neck—aparently it's a heat pad on the neck muscle he pulled at the gym. A few minutes later, a blond woman with a really bad tan and big plastic boobs in her forties walks up to his table and starts complaining about not enough light because she wants to read and she is gonna go sit in the comfortable lounge chair over there. He begs her to stay and sit with him. She does exactly that. Then the intellectul conversations begin. It's very obvious that their relationship is purely physical. She asks him to name as many brick uses as possible in two minutes to pass time. Listening to that conversation is torture… Anyway after about thirty minutes, a cute girl in her twenties walks up to his table as soon as the older lady goes to the bathroom and starts going off about what a jerk he is to be dating a woman as old as his mom and storms out with her latte. Busted by his exgirlfriend!  As if that's not enough, on the right side of me is a table of about fifteen Christian teenage girls, having bible time. I don't know if I can explain this, but the way they speak and the speed at which they speak is very bizarre to me and when there are fifteen of them doing it at the same time and giving their opinions on religion, it causes one to get up from their comfortable warm seat and move to a wooden stool at the bar far far away from bad tans, plastic boobs and teenage girls.  Just another "Starbucks Moment".

         The pimpest wooden blinds for a bargain price (I'm really excited about them). We installed them on Friday and celebrated with lots of Makers Mark.    Saturday morning, Charlie's eating the rest of mama's pear, which was followed by hours of stomach pains.    Paul is peaking …    I found this picture…I think we can guess what Paul is up to in the company of his digital friend.    I got cought again! I can't resist gumball machines.    Having an intimate moment with my hot and sour soup bowl.    Sometimes I have no life—doing design graphics.

      There is so much political energy going around—people everywhere are so tense! Paul said that he's been getting flicked off on the road for his Kerry/Edwards bumpersticker. It's so silly that people would do that! I've read blogs where people were aggressively criticized and judged for their political views, which is also very silly. People are treating this election like some sort of sports event—"my team is better than your team!". It's very obviously time for some change to happen, so why are people hanging on to their ignorance so tightly? Ugh! Politics are a constant struggle for me because I grew up in war. I know how destructive politics can be. I refuse to get involved but then I feel guilty for not being proactive about changing the world! I guess maybe changing the world shouldn't be that high on my priority list…maybe it should…

      It was a movie madness weekend! Saw  urlLink The Village  on opening night this weekend. Paul and I are huge Night Shyamalan fans…'Signs' kicks some serious butt—it's one of the top ten movies on my list! I guess it's hard to outdo your masterpiece, but the Village comes close. The ending is a big surprise and I really enjoy Night's experiment with a woman heroine, but there are some 'Blair Witch' elements that I can live without. The cast is pretty cool and the filming is awesome—I left the theater feeling good. I highly recommend it. If you're into old skool horror movies, check out  urlLink the blog of the rotting dead  for indepth reviews.   Also saw  urlLink Anchorman  finally. Hysterical! It's awesome to see Will Farrell do his thing. Doesn't nail the cheesy humor thing dead on quite like Zoolander, but comes pretty close!

      Here's the word of the day (more like word of the week) in a sentence:  The heat in Houston could at times be  abonimable , especially when your office space is not well insulated. I did find a solution to make it less  abonimable —by setting the air conditioner to 70 degrees.   It would be funny to hear someone talk that way in real life…made myself laugh out loud…
