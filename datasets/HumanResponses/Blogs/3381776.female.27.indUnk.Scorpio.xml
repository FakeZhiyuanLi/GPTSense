      After being sick off and on for about a month, I was itching to get out and play. I'm still on the mend, but I took advantage of the relatively clear night and perfect spring temperatures to go down to the pier in Old Town Alexandria and do a little  urlLink busking .  It was like a street fair down there tonight. I claimed a little "territory" and set up, and I found myself surrounded by a string trio, a man making balloon animals, a guy playing music on the rims of glasses of water, and a group showing off a bunch of fancy parrots and other birds. As always, there were many families and couples and a good number of people out on the pier with books and cameras and newspapers.  I met a little girl, about nine years old, who came up to me and said, "If I had a dollar, I would give it to you."  I met a boy of about eleven who said to me, "How long have you been playing guitar? I really want to play guitar." I asked him if he played any other instruments, and he said, "I used to play trombone." His little sister chimed in saying, "The reason he quit trombone was because he kept forgetting to bring it to band practice, and the band director said he had to be more responsible or quit. So Mom and Dad said he had to quit." The boy looked embarrassed. The little sister looked rather matter-of-fact.  I met a man who complimented me on my smile and another who kept asking me to "sing something in German."   It's a special weekend, though. This Memorial Day weekend, DC is hosting the Rolling Thunder rally and dedicating the World War II Memorial. There are thousands of visitors to the city. Many are veterans, veterans of WWII and other wars. Tonight, I also met a group of men who had come from south Florida on their bikes wearing leather jackets that said "Nam Riders." And these veterans, these motorcycle riding veterans, sat and listened... really listened... to me play. I wished I had something patriotic in my repertoire. I felt truly honored.  And it really hit me. I don't agree with so many of the politics going on right now. I don't like the fact that we have troops all over the Middle East for a war that seems to have little definition. I don't like the fact that we are losing soldiers... losing  people  every day. But as much as I don't like it all, I feel so strongly for the men and women who are out there, doing their best to defend us. These folks need our support whether or not we agree with the reason they are there. These soldiers are risking their lives... for us.  And so that's what I thought about on the walk from the pier back to my car.   Happy Memorial Day, everyone.

      Greetings everyone! I've got all sorts of great things going on and can't wait to tell you about them. But before we get there, I just want to mention that I'm going to try and get away from the Yahoo! group that I have been using to post my messages. I'm sick of the advertising, and I'm aware that some of the messages I've sent have been eaten by folks' spam filters. So I will give this a try. If you are on this list and don't mean to be, just send me an email and I'll remove you, no hard feelings!  And now... on with the show!  1 -  urlLink Exciting Upcoming Performances  2 -  urlLink Website Changes  3 -  urlLink Loving the Legend  4 -  urlLink Merchandise Corner  5 -  urlLink How Can I Help?      1 - Exciting Upcoming Performances ---------------------     Sunday, May 30  - Revolution Records - 4:00 pm - 4215 Connecticut Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20008 - 202-237-2480  Revolution Records ( urlLink http://www.revolutionrecords.net ) is Metro Accessible!

I've got a lyrics archive that's nearly complete up on my website,  urlLink http://www.libbywiebel.com . I'll be adding the rest of the lyrics as I have time.  Also, I'm happy to announce that I'm an official "blogger." Check out my periodic updates and ramblings at  urlLink http://www.libbywiebel.com/libbylog ... and syndicate me if you please. Plus, you can leave me comments and messages. Make sure you take a look!     3 - Loving the Legend ----------------------------------  I had the great pleasure the other evening of seeing Janis Ian at the Birchmere in Alexandria. It was such a treat to see someone who is such a renowned songwriter and performer. She gave a tremendous performance. I got chills hearing "Society's Child" live, and I fell in love with some of her newer pieces.  The thing that struck me the most, though, was the introduction she gave to "At Seventeen." She talked about how when she wrote it, she never imagined that it would be something she was performing thirty-some years later. She said that she was "honored" that it would be "touching its fourth generation." It really puts things in perspective. I can't even imagine where I'll be thirty years from now... with my life, my performing, my songwriting. And I have no idea if thirty years from now, I'll still be singing some of the same songs that I'm singing now. But it gives me such hope and inspiration to see someone who followed her dreams... and became a true folk icon.     4 - Merchandise Corner ---------------------------------  So where can you get my music?

The Fete will offer free concerts for the public, by musicians throughout the District."  Seems like a good enough reason to get out there, no?

I'll be hosting earlier in the afternoon, too. It's a showcase from noon till 6pm put on by  urlLink Songwriters Association of Washington , so you can bet you'll hear some great original music.
