      I miss my husband.   I know they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder, and in some part that is true, but it also makes the heart ache. It makes my arms ache too when I have to go for too long without hugging him. Distance between partners sucks.  Maybe I should explain why we are apart right now. We had a cute little apartment in Monrovia, California. An adorable little one bedroom place in one of the greatest towns I have ever seen. Only problems were that we are a family of four and paying what we were for such a small place was ludicrous. So when it came down to it, we decided to move rather then keep paying so much. We had been looking for somewhere bigger since I found out I was pregnant way back in September 2002. We just had no luck, so when it came time to move, we had to part ways. I took the kids and just about everything we had up here to Bakersfield with my parents, while 7 moved into a room with a couple of his friends down in Garden Grove so he could continue working. For anyone who doesn't know where either place is, it's about a 2 1/2 hour drive to get from one to the other.   That was back at the end of May. So here it is approaching the end of September and we're still apart. I'm getting to the point where I'm tired of putting on a brave face when people ask me how we do it. "It just had to be done" I say with a shrug and a wan smile. Yeah, it had to be done, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. 7 and I started out our relationship long distance, so I guess I'm more used to it maybe than other people. He was in Texas and I was here in California for 3 years. We got to see each other every few months, at one point it was 6 months between visits.  It gets to a point where you start to hate the distance like it is a person. You want to just kick and punch at it because it's keeping your love away from you. It takes a lot of dedication and love to even be able to consider a relationship like that, let alone maintain one.   I've also found that it takes a certain amount of forced detachment. I have to keep myself somewhat detached from the situation or it'll just make me crazy. If I let all the loneliness and longing be at the front of my brain for very long,  I turn into a weepy puddle and can't get anything done. If I let myself think about how long it's been since I got to wake up in the morning next to him, wrap my arms around him, or just do something as stupid and ordinary as hold his hand while watching tv without checking the clock to figure out how quickly my time with him is running out, I'd realize what a big chunk of my life was missing. And that is never a pleasant thought. It's a day ruining, energy sucking, happiness devouring thought. He's my best friend in the world in addition to being my husband and to not be able to be with him is torture. Therefore, I distance myself a little. Not that this works perfectly... I often feel kind of like a stranger for a bit when we do see each other. It's hard to let my emotions off the leash to run free again, knowing that I'll have to shut them up again real soon.     So I spend my days trying to keep busy and avoid thinking about it. I have two little ones to raise, so I guess I'm lucky I don't have much free time to myself. You don't get to mope much when you're too busy to remember to eat. I just pray that God smiles on us again soon and we can find a place big enough and cheap enough for us to move into and be a family in again.  I wanna to go home.

      Yeah, I'm afraid of the dark. You wanna make sumpin' of it??  I can't deny it. I'm 26 years old and still afraid of the dark. Well, not so much the dark itself, but the things hiding in it. Things that are ususally a figment of my imagination, but seem real enough to make me still run down the hall at night like the hounds from hell are nipping at my heels. I do indeed sleep with a nightlight, though I can say now that I can get up to take care of the babies without stubbing my toes. You know, in case anyone who thinks like a rational adult happens to see it and ask.   I suppose my problem started when I was very little. To begin with, I have a very active imagination. While it is a great help in my career as a teacher and as a mother, I have been the victim of it more times than I can count once night has fallen. When we moved to the house I am staying at now I was about four years old. It was after a neighbor kid burned down our house, so we had no furniture or anything to speak of. So to keep us entertained in this big empty house, my dad would turn off the lights and go hide. Our job was to then go find him. Talk about screaming! I'm surprised no one ever called the police to come find out who was being bludgeoned to death. I still can't walk down the hall in the dark. My mom used to babysit a little fella and my dad was playing the same lovely game with him. He asked me to help him find my dad, so I picked him up and started to walk down the dark hall. After about 3 seconds, my irrational mind kicked in and I bolted back the way I came. I also realized that should my dad happen to jump out at us, I would probably throw the kid at him and run to save myself. I know.... pathetic.  The reason I bring up this topic is that my folks are gone for about a week. They bought a big ass RV and are off on their maiden voyage to the central coast. After staying the past two nights down in LA with 7, the kids and I are here alone. I don't mind it so much during the day, but nights get to me. I realize I have to be brave since I am the adult now. I have to set a good example for Oliver, who has been having his own issues with scary things lately. I do believe his problem is also an overactive imagination. He was scared horses were going to come into a restaurant patio area and eat his food and him the other day. He actually worked himself up to tears.   So we're here alone and my folks will just have to deal with the electric bill being a little higher this month since I plan to leave every light in the place on all night!

        SEX ROCKS!!!!  I got to see my wonderful husband this past weekend. We left the kids with grandma and headed off to the local jacuzzi suite motel. On the way we picked up some of my new favorite aphrodesiac, rum and coke, and then, after a relaxing hot sudsy slippery dip in the jacuzzi tub, proceeded to be all kinds of naughty. I tell ya, after being together over 6 years he still can curl my toes like no ones business. That boy is gifted!!

      I wanna be a supermodel.  Yes, this is my latest goal. It all started on a day when I really felt like a mommy on the edge. I happened to look at the clock and realized it had gotten to be 3 o'clock in the afternoon and I hadn't gotten dressed yet. My hair was crazy looking since my almost 2 yr. old was nice enough to brush it for me as I sat on the toilet that morning. He always whacks me in the head with the brush and then brushes all my hair forward and to the right so it stands out in a strange point. I had also been playing with the baby and she had been giving me kisses. Big wet messy drooly baby kisses. I actually had spit running down the side of my face and dripping onto my neck. Sounds lovely no?   Anyways, I'm not a bad looking gal. I'm about 5'10", short dark hair, dark eyes, olive skin. I'm part Hungarian so I'm pretty sturdy. I like to say I've got an hourglass figure... with a little extra time on my ass. Now, it's taken a lot of work to get to the point where I can say I'm not bad looking. If you'd met me in high school I would have rather believed that Liberace was straight than to believe I was attractive. In fact I remember one conversation where I compared myself to a baboon. I actually asked my big high school crush "I'm not ugly, am I??" Yeah so, my self esteem needed a little work.   Eventually I met the fella I ended up marrying. My darling 7. At first I thought he had a few screws loose. I mean, this guy actually claimed to prefer chunky girls! What a riot right? I figured he probably liked them enough to get some, and then moved on, as had been my short and disappointing dating experience before he came along. So I went along with his exclamations of my beauty and charm, all the while thinking he was sweet, but obviously needed glasses. We've been together over 6 years now and the only change in his tune has been to declare me to be even more beautiful than before. They say that it takes hearing a good thing about yourself fifty times or so before you believe it, but it only takes once to believe a bad thing. I'd heard a lot of bad things growing up from the asses I went to school with here in Bakoville. The wall surrounding my inner self was really high and thick. It's amazing how well being put on a pedestal and ardently and unwaveringly admired works at tearing down that wall.   Back to my desire to strut my stuff on the catwalk. About a year and a half ago I was shopping with my sister in Fashion Bug (one of my very favorite stores in case you were wanting to get me something) when we saw a sign asking for models for the yearly community fashion show. I pointed it out and we both laughed a little at the thought of ourselves as models. By the time we were done shopping however, we had both thought about it enough to realize that we would probably have fun doing it and gathered up our courage to volunteer. I was so nervous the day of the event. I was  worried I wouldn't be able to walk down the "runway", let alone manage two twirls and a coy look over my shoulder. My turn came and I did great. The crowd was really nice and I felt like I was something.   A while later, 7 began bouncing a club that hosted a BBW group (big beautiful woman for those of you not in the know) on the weekends. I went and was amazed to see these women, many of whom were significantly larger than I, shakin their groove things in less than I usually wore to bed!      And they had men all over them!!   For the first time in my life I got asked to dance by a total stranger. After finding out more about these gals I learned that some were models, some had their own fan websites, some were porn stars, most were just there to have fun and enjoy life in the body God gave them. It really made me realize that being fat wasn't opposite of being considered pretty.   So after having my last baby about 4 1/2 months ago, I've been feeling a little down about how gooshy my tummy is, how much muscle tone I've lost, how I sometimes look like I was dragged behind a horse for a few miles after escaping a rehab clinic... stuff like that. A friend of ours has started her own website where fellas are willing to pay a nice sum each month for the privilege of seeing her naked. I had a look at her pics, and was stunned to see that she and I aren't too much different figure wise. Got me to thinking. I don't want to get naked for anyone, but I can put some clothes on and get paid for it, by gosh.   So my opportunity presented itself a few days ago. I'm getting head and body shots taken soon and will submit them for a modeling job I heard about from a friend. Even my husband was surprised that I wanted to do it. I'm going to give it my best and see what happens. Wish me luck!

      So I think I'm a stalker.   No really, I do. But I'm not sure if I truly qualify for the title. Maybe I should say I have a really annoying habit of "checking up" on people I used to know. I use Google to see if I can find any juicy tidbits of their online life that they carelessly left lying around cyberspace. Digging for dirt on their current situation to see if I had a profound effect upon their lives. So profound that they had to write a 20 page document and post it for all the world to see about how wonderful I am. Mostly I'm just bored and nosy.  Recently I have been finding myself a bit obsessed with looking up the only other guy besides my husband that I can say I really dated. We dated briefly way back in 1997 and he was a nice enough guy. He was really smart, had a nice car, great job, live in San Diego, one of my favorite cities, and was a lot of fun to be around. One of the things I found interesting about him was that he really identified with animals. More so than people really. And he never wanted to eat in any type of franchise restaurant. This was fun at first. We always had to find some cute little mom and pop place to go. After a while though, a girl gets to craving some Taco Bell, ya know?   So I was online the other night and decided to indulge in one of my little searches. I found many things right away about his ideas and projects regarding artificial intelligence and other such lofty subjects. Being an engineer, he likes that sort of stuff. Then I struck gold. I found an online journal he's been keeping for over a year. "Self," I said, "here we will find out if he still pines away for us. He will have to have posted his deepest thoughts about what a pit of despair his life has been since we quit dating." Ok, I exaggerate. I thought it'd be a good way for my nosy self to see what he'd been up to.  So I spent a few hours reading every single one of his entries, each and every juicy detail or his life. Some of the scintillating stuff I found out was he's living up north with friends and having a pretty good time. Work is decent. He really likes his local coffee shop. His mother knits. The kittens he had bought shortly before I met him are both still alive and doing well. He has a lot of odd dreams. And he sure has been getting it on with the ladies. He talked about at least at least 5 girls he's dated since me. All the glory of love and woe of loss were graphically covered. But not a damn word about me. How rude! Not that I really expected to find anything, but it's nice to know of people even remember you.  So now I don't know if I should email him that I found it or not. Maybe I should just keep on reading it day by day, like some weird personal soap opera. Or maybe I shouldn't and let him live his life privately... or as privately as one can with an online journal. I have no right really to read it, but it's just so interesting to me. I get to be a peeping tom without really doing anything wrong.  I'll probably keep reading it. It's been driving me nuts since he hasn't posted anything since the day I found it. Three whole days!!! Maybe I'll write him and say hi, then see if he mentions me. You know, I just realized something. I'm not a stalker after all. I'm just narcissistic.

      Man do I miss sleeping alone.   I don't mean like I did before I was married, because that type of sleeping alone really bites. I mean sleeping in a bed using all 4 of my pillows without sharing with Elmo, Baby Elmo, and Mickey Mouse and waking to someone sticking a finger up my nose while he chants "Boogie", and another small being frantically clawing at my shirt and drooling all over my boob. As far as I can remember, my hubby has never sat on my head and announced he was poopy.   Yes, I admit it. I'm a mommy. One of the legions of sleep deprived, spit soaked, stained shirted, kiddie show song singing ladies responsible for rearing the next generation of great Americans. I am one of those women who dance and make faces in the grocery store aisle to keep the baby from crying, nurse a secret crush on Joe from "Blue's Clues", and think that a really good day is one in which I actually get to go to the bathroom without an audience and remember to brush my teeth.  Back to the sleep thing. My son wakes up every hour on the hour after about 2 a.m. to ask in the most piteous voice ever if he can lay down on mommy's pillows. I tell him that it is still time for him to be sleeping and that he has to stay in his bed. He waits just long enough for me to start falling back asleep before he shrieks HELP! So as any good mommy does, I jump out of bed and run to his crib with the image of him dangling over the rail about to land on his head in my mind, only to find he needs to have his blanket smoothed out over him again. Fix and repeat till I get tired of it around 6 a.m. and let him into my bed.  The wiggly drooler is another matter all together. My daughter is 4 months old and seems to have the idea in her head that she is entitled to nurse everytime she wakes up in the night. I've had a hell of a time explaining to her that she can make it to morning without chowing down on mom all night. I think I'd probably do better if she actually understood anything I said. The whole time I'm talking to her she is doing her best imitation of a pig who knows there are some truffles hidden under my shirt. The best part is that while my brain is trying to logically ignore her whimpers and snuffles, my boobs have a mind of their own. I usually end up soaked regardless. So she comes to bed with us too. And so I spend the night with my boobs out for all to see, a sweaty little person kneeing me in the butt and trying to steal my last pillow, and an industrial strength shop vac stuck to my front.   God I love my kids..... but boy do i miss sleeping alone.

      Ok, Ok, so I've been busy.  I know it's been forever since I wrote anything, but I have good reason. I also have a sneaking suspicion no one but my husband reads this anyways. If anyone else does read it, feel free to email me at kaykaybates@yahoo.com to tell me to get my act together or whatever.  So, I've been busy. At first it was my son's 2nd birthday party that kept me away from the computer. It was September 25th and it took me the better part of two weeks to get it all set up and do all the crap I needed to do. I kind of decided to play Super Mommy and made a huge, multi-layer Humpty Dumpty cake, about 2 dozen little pompom and pipe cleaner sheep for a game I made up, and came up with a few other original games to go along with the Nursery Rhyme theme. The kids who came loved it. I think my favorite part was my sister-in-law cheating and peeking when she was hitting the baby turtle pinata. I'll have to explain the baby turtle part another time.  Then about 2 weeks ago, my husband calls to tell me he got laid off. So we quickly moved all his stuff up here to my folks' house for a while. I can't figure out why, but I seem to have even less time now that he is here. I thought I would get a break with the kids and have a little more free time to myself. Wishful thinking. Well, I must say I do get to shower alone more frequently. No toddler poking me in the butt as I shave my legs shrieking "NAKED MOMMA! NAKED BUTT!"   I am hurrying to write this as we are packing to go to Texas. We are taking off tonight for a week and a half of fun. Well, it may not be all fun, but we're going for a good reason. We haven't been to visit my in-laws in over a year and they have yet to meet our daughter. We are going to drive out there in my parent's new RV and then stay with 7's folks. This will be the first time my parents meet his parents. I'm really wondering how it's going to go.   Wish us luck!!

      Happy Birthday to me.....  So my birthday was Friday. I turned 27. I had my typical "I'm getting old, no one likes me, I have no friends" pre-birthday funk going for about 2 days and came up with a new name for myself. I'm boring old beige Kayla. Nothing exciting, nothing crazy, nothing new about me.  Well not anymore!! In the tiniest of baby steps towards becoming someone I would rather be, I changed my hair. I've always had a complex about my hair and change is a very hard thing for me in general. I had the same hair style from junior high up till shortly before my son was born 2 years ago. Long hair with bangs. I've changed the color some over the years... gone black and kind of a weird Sun - In induced orange color, but it mostly stayed a boring dull brown. The births of my children heralded the arrival of quite a bit of white throughout as well.   I've always been envious of girls like Kelly Osbourne who change their hair as often as their clothes. People who really don't give a shit about what other people think of it, and go for whatever tickles their fancy. I scared 7 when I mentioned that I wanted to get a "sort of a modified mohawky kinda cut" and color it.  First off, I don't describe things well, and secondly, one should never say one wants to get a mohawk to ones husband if he doesn't already have one.  After searching online for pics of hairstyles I liked, we found something that was very near the short cut I already had. The stylist at my salon said all I really needed was to learn how to use gel. So, we cut my hair, I learned the secrets of gel use..... always on mostly dry hair..... and then on the way home, we hit the hair color aisle of our local Walmart. I know, not really the place to get kick ass colors, but it was a start. We ended up buying a bleaching kit after several minutes of discussing what I really wanted to do to my head, and my quizzing 7 about his feelings on the matter. I wanted to make sure that I didn't end up looking like a freak to my hubby.   I screwed up enough nerve to bleach the crap outta my hair last night. I left the stuff on for the longest time they recommend leaving it and then washed it out. I was very surprised when I finally opened my eyes, looked in the mirror, and realized  "I have orange and yellow hair!!!"   7 and I had a good long look at it and I decided I like it. It's got some really light yellowy white sections, some darker yellow and some orangy parts. When the tips are wet they look reddish. Pretty much, I look like I have flames on my head and I love it. Only mistake we made was doing my eyebrows too. I look like an albino Jake Busey wannabe. So I'll color them in for a while so I don't look so odd.  If I can get this much satisfaction from just bleaching my hair.... who knows how much fun I'll have trying different colors. Red and pink are at the top of my list right now, with a possible Smurf sighting at some point in the future.  I shall never be beige again!!!

      Oh by the way, the trip was, for the most part, super. I'm so damn tired though and I don't think I will catch up on my sleep any time soon as the kids have adopted really odd sleep patterns. Oliver wants to go to bed around 7 p.m. and keeps getting out of his crib at 6 a.m. Luckily he has been wandering down the hall to Grandma's room instead of getting into trouble.   Charlie Girl, on the other hand, doesn't want to sleep at all. She wants to be held all day and night. She also started crawling while we were on our trip so I can't leave her alone in the bassinet for more than a few minutes at a time for fear that she's going to wake up and go over the side.   We're also trying to get the front room rearranged so that we can bring our king size bed over from storage. It is really frustrating to finally have my husband here but still be sleeping in separate rooms. I can hear him snoring through the wall, but get none of the benefits of his being close. He is the best heater a chronically frozen girl like me could find.   Aah guess what... Charlie Girl is awake yet again. Guess I'll have to try again later to tell more about the trip.

      Just kill me!!!  I've got the mother of all sore throats right now. It started about a week ago with just a little bit of an annoying soreness when my throat would get dry. Now I swear there are some demented sadistic little elves in my mouth jabbing me with spears every time I swallow or talk. I'm tempted to just let the drool flow down my chin to save myself the agony. I've gargled salt water (bleech) and Peroxyl and used about a gallon Chloroseptic. I even gargled the Chloroseptic in a futile attempt to get some relief. Nothing is working!!!  I'm begging you..... just one hard whack in the head with a blunt object  would do it.

        BARENAKED LADIES   I just want to say first and foremost that the Barenaked Ladies is my most favorite band ever. I know that statements such as that are usually uttered by preteen girls about someone like New Kids on the Block (Jon was my favorite!) and then change in about a minute. This is not one of those statements. This is a declaration of complete and utter worship and appreciation for all the wonderfulness that is BNL. I've tried several times to explain to people how I feel about this group and all I can ever seem to get out is that a tidal wave of complete joy wells up inside of me when I listen to their music and makes me feel like I am going to burst with happiness. I have an embarrassing habit of making these weird squeaky noises when something makes me happy. When it comes to BNL I overload on this impulse, can't make a sound, and end up grinning from ear to ear and quivering while making this high pitched humming noise. I know, I'm strange. I just can't help it. I have a couple of their CD's and one DVD. I haven't gone crazy and bought everything they have ever done. I just really enjoy them. I mean, have you ever had a tape that you listened to every morning and every evening on your way to work, plus listened to it at home for over a year and never got tired of it and were sad when it ended?? My tape was a compilation of Barenaked Ladies songs and it's still in my car in the tape deck now. I made the tape back in 1999.   The catalyst for this gushfest? I have a wedding anniversary coming up soon. My first in fact. "How can that be?" you ask. "Haven't you been married for almost four years now?" Yes I have, but it's still possible. We got married on Leap Year Day, February 29, 2000. 7 came to my school and told me that  the next day was Leap Year Day. Jokingly I said, "Hey ya wanna get married?" and the rest is history. It's actually kind of a funny story, but it's a bit off topic.  So, my anniversary is coming up and I happened to be looking around on eBay the other day and saw a bunch of tickets being sold for a Barenaked Ladies show in March in LA at the Universal Amphitheater. After I picked myself up off the floor, I told 7 that is what I wanted for my present. We decided that since we were only going to have an actual anniversary every four years, that we'd have to do something big. This would be the best present ever!! Wait... I take that back. The best present ever would be going to a Barenaked Ladies concert with my hot husband and George Clooney, and getting backstage passes too.  I'll settle for tickets though.  Hey if anyone who happens to read this has any sort of connections that could get me backstage passes... I'd love you forever. Really I would.

        Hair Update I've gone back to dark brown. I felt that right now I needed to be more sensible since I'll be looking for work again soon. I also needed another haircut and still hadn't bought more bleach and the do was lookin kind of weird. I had a box of dark color left over so I just threw that on my head.   Ok, ok.. I admit I had an ulterior motive. We were going to be going to a babyshower for the wife of a guy I had a crush on my whole childhood and into high school. Being the dork that I am, I panicked and made a rash decision based on the fact that I wanted to look good for someone I hadn't seen in over 10 years. Never mind the fact that David is married with a baby on the way... it was all about me. So anyways, me and my dark hair went to the shower and had a really great time. His wife is really cool and I'd even be friends with her if the chance arose. Not likely seeing as they live out at the country club and we live with my folks and beg for money... heehee. I also decided that my husband was way hotter than David turned out to be. When I told 7 that he looked at me as if I were nuts. "Yeah honey, I was really worried about that," he said with extreme sarcasm. Well, sorry I just happen to be sooo much better than all your ex girlfriends that there is just no comparison. Anyways!

        Lo and behold... A new post!!!  Ok, so stuff that's happened since I last blogged.... um, not much really. I've yet to bleach my hair again. It's about half dark now since it began growing at light speed for some reason after I bleached it the first time back in November. I kind of ran out of money in the hair reconstruction fund. I need to rebleach it and pick a color. I had the stylist put in some pink glue stuff last time I got it cut and I rather liked it. I think it'll look much better once I get it bleached all the way out.   Kids are doing well. Charlie had the stomach flu and puked on me several times in a row one night. She managed to hold it in till we had gotten her washed and redressed and I had put on a new shirt... then she let fly. It was pretty gross, but not as bad as I had imagined. I ended up sick enough to go to the urgent care the next day. I don't usually go to the doctor but I was to the point that I wanted someone to kill me rather than have another bout of dry heaves. I figured that they would maybe bump me up on the priority list in the waiting room since I kept running into the bathroom to puke, but I was there for almost 2 hours. The doctor ended up giving me two Tylenol and a saline IV. I was really embarrassed when I felt better almost immediately.   Living with my folks is a bit sketchy still. We're butting heads about all kinds of stupid things. My mom refuses to talk to 7 about things that bug her and has be deliver messages to him. That puts me in a weird position since everyone wants to kill the messenger these days. I hate being in the middle, but have no choice in the matter if I want my folks and husband to get along. We're working on getting out of there as soon as possible.   7 has his social security card and will soon have his ID card too. All his DMV crap is almost cleared up too. It's mostly a matter of getting the money together to pay all the assorted fees and for gas to get to LA and back. I have to keep getting on 7 to get this stuff done. Lately Pokemon have been taking up a lot of his time. I feel like smashing the stinking gameboy into about a thousand pieces.   My sister is leaving for Brazil tomorrow for about 3 weeks. I hope everything goes well there and she doesn't get mugged or eaten by piranhas. She's got about $2,300 worth of camera equipment on her. She's using the trip for her senior project for her broadcasting degree. 7 and my dad went a little nuts getting all this great equipment online for her. I'd find them in the computer room at night in ecstasy over some new digital camera they found for like $5 less than on the last site. It was pretty funny.   Ok, well I've got to get these babies in bed now. My folks are down south to see my sister off at the airport so I've got a chance at some alone time with my hubby... something that is extremely rare these days. I just hope he doesn't find some infomercial or something that catches his attention till 4 a.m. again. I'm going to start calling the tv his girlfriend. Till next time.....

      All things must come to an end...  So I changed the description of my blog. 7 thought it should be something else since I really don't talk exclusively about the kids, thus the spit soaked mommy line didn't make sense.... or something like that. I may begin a blog about the kids and their adventures pretty soon under some other name. I have yet to pick something snappy as the title. Watch for an update.  It's Valentine's Day... a day devoted to lovers everywhere. I used to hate the day, and am still somewhat resistant to the pink sugar coated lovey doveyness of it all. 7 loves it all. I've slowly started looking forward to it each year a little more because I have someone who suprises me each year with a totally unexpected gesture. A few years in a row he sent me flowers from Texas, one year he flew out to see me. This year as I woke up and shifted a groggy toddler off of me, a card fell off the headboard and stabbed me in the forehead. It woke me up, but apparently also turned my head on to the spirit of the day. I've been happy and for some reason my husband looks  really  good to me today. I can't wait till the kids are asleep and we get to be alone. I've already been groping him all day and he hasn't told me to quit it yet... which is always a good sign.  Things around here have been a little more tense than usual. We're looking for an apartment so the kids have been staying home with my folks for a few hours during the day. That always causes trouble as they get tired from chasing the kids, my mom is stressed by us living here and so far I've brought home no good news about when we will be out of her spare room.   Almost all of the rental places here want you to have lived here and had the same job for 3 months, make 3 times the amount of the rent, and have great credit. Ok, well, we just moved here, have no jobs and shit credit. Where the hell are we and people like us, of whom there are plenty in Bakersfield, supposed to live??? It's making me nuts. We saw a place today that made me ache I wanted to live there so bad. But of course, we'd never get it in a million years.  So I guess we'll have to search until we find someone who takes pity on us and lets us live in their shack until we get working again and get some money saved up for a better place.  THe kids are doing great. Charlie Girl has started going in little 3 step bursts. She can go like crazy if she has something to push in front of her. She really cruises through the house that way. Oliver has had an obsession with sticking his fingers in people's eyes, ears, noses... etc. lately. He's making everyone nutty. Especially Charlie. She crawls away from him as fast as she can go when he gets close. It's not all bad though. He can make her laugh like crazy and most of the time plays very nicely with her. He really keeps her entertained in the car and I can't say how much that helps me.   Ah well, I smell that dinner is almost ready and the noise level is rising out in the front room. I should go.  Oh, by the way. We are starting Atkins on Monday... I know, way over done, but my high school reunion is coming up at the end of July and I need to drop some weight fast. I think I should at least be at the same level of fatness I was when I left 10 years ago, if not slimmer. I'd like to be considerably slimmer so I'm going to make sure to get my exercise going too. Wish me luck!!

      I sang with the Barenaked Ladies!!!!!!  We did get to go to the concert after all. Our friend Tim volunteered to babysit for us. That is a story unto itself. Apparently the kids were awful. Oliver wouldn't eat and cried a lot. Charlie didn't want to go anywhere near Tim and cried too. His mom and our friend Holly had to help a lot. Oliver is truly his father's son... he only fell asleep after rooting around and getting comfy on Holly's ample bosom.   The concert was everything I could have ever hoped it could be. The only gripes I have are with the loud ass drunk a few rows behind us who kept yelling stupid shit throughout the show and the fact that our show isn't going to be one of the ones sold on the internet. I was really hoping that we would be able to have a copy of our first BNL experience to watch and share with others. It was a fantastic show. In fact, I was so damn happy I cried. Had I been down front I would have even danced... and for anyone who knows me that is a major thing. So we don't get to have anything other than our wonderful memories of it all.   We also went to a barbeque hosted by our friend Jarrod. It was pretty fun, crazy drunk molesters aside. Some people there had just a little too much chemical fun and ended up trying to screw everyone there. I had to dodge the fella when he decided that kissing me would be a good idea and asking his girlfriend to get off me when she plopped down in my lap and proceeded to grope me. 7 had to fight to keep her from pulling his pants off, Veronica defended herself and her boy from unwanted attacks, and Tim looked rather amused with the whole thing. It was funny after the fact. We managed to actually visit after they left and then ended up sleeping over. We all managed to get up and leave at around noon the next day.   We also tried to go to the beach, but were rather unsucessful. We ended up getting there at about 5 p.m. and it was already getting chilly so I had to change the kids into sweats from their swim stuff. We let them play in the sand a little and play wave tag until mommy started to turn purple. Then we had to go home to bakersfield. It took quite a while, but we made it. All in all it was a very long weekend and I'm still tired.

      So maybe I wasn't done yet. I had more to say, but didn't want to leave a huge long post. If you read my husband's blog (www.sevenbates.blogspot.com) you probably already know that we have put down a deposit on an apartment. If not, WE PUT DOWN A DEPOSIT ON AN APARTMENT!! My brother and his wife moved into some decent little townhomes near here and the rent is very reasonable. We went ahead and applied too and got approved. I guess today our friend Jared found out that he got approved as well. So now we can have our own little community parties and stuff. It should be fun.  The apartment is a little on the small side for 4 people, but bigger than our one bedroom we had before. The kids will have their own room finally, something I am very excited about. I haven't been alone with my husband in bed for a long time. I know I know, it's not like the kids will all of a sudden not be in bed with us, but at least I can pretend for a little while. And the chances of actually getting to sleep in something other than my granny jammies are much higher. My parents regularly either look in to see if we are awake or come in our room as it is now. Not such a good situation since 7 sleeps naked usually.   We'll have 2 bedrooms, 1 1/2 bathrooms, a nice kitchen with room for a small table and a workable living area. There is a great closet under the stairs where I can stash some random stuff and the kids' toys when we don't want it all out in the living room. We're going to have to reevaluate some of our furniture and definitely purchase some new stuff. I'm really just looking forward to having somewhere to call mine. It's been so long since I've had that. In fact it's just a couple months shy of a year since we moved out of our home in Monrovia. That was so hard to do. I still feel like crying when I think about it. It was our family's first home. 7 and I at first in the studio downstairs. Then we brought both of our babies home to the one bedroom upstairs. We had the street fair to go to on Friday nights, the park, the library, the movie theater, the coffee shop, the grocery store and various restaurants within walking distance. It was almost perfect and I will always miss it. We actually plan to move back there some day. Of course, we'd much rather have a house, but the location of our little pink apartments couldn't be beat.  Ok, enough misty watercolored memories. OOOH!! 7 got us the tickets to the Barenaked Ladies show after all!! We're going!!!!! and I'm just a little excited. Can ya tell? I love them so much. I told 7 we needed to get the albums we don't have already so I can learn the words to all the songs. I just want to be prepared. I have this weird thing about being prepared for things. I get so anal about it at times that I'll ask things like are there more than one door on the building I am going to so I can't possible walk into the wrong place. I like to have all my bases covered. I pretty much don't want to go to the concert and either not know the words or be singing the wrong words and have the other fans think I'm some sort of weenie. Not that any of them will even be remotely thinking about me at all. But still.   Ok, dad looks like he wants to go to bed, and the computer is in his room after all so I'll close. I really should find more people to really talk to instead of doing this... heehee.

          Wouldn't you like to be a pepper too?...  Ok, so I went to a job fair today for the Bakersfield City School District. Pretty much everyone shows up and then you get interviewed by some random person who works for the district. I am phenomenally bad when it comes to interviews. I usually get so nervous that I start this weird full body shivering and yawning, sweaty palms, elephants in my stomach... you know, the regular people-phobe type things.  I have trouble thinking of what to say too. Once in an interview to be an Area Coordinator at my college, I blurted out that I don't like people. I was serious, but they thought I was joking and hired me anyways.   We had to take a class as part of our public assistance thing. Kind of a "How to get your lazy no good ass off welfare by finding a job" type thing. They had us make a resume, practice dressing professionally, and do a mock interview. I did pretty well during it, but mostly because I pretended I wasn't me. I was amazed at how well that can work if you can make yourself really believe it. So today I tried the same thing. I pretended I was a confidant, outgoing person with interesting things to say and I did wonderfully in my interview. The woman actually said at one point that she could feel my sincerity. WooHoo!! I'm going to pretend I'm better at a lot of things if it's that easy.   Hopefully I will stick out in her mind and get a full time position with the district. I am trying to get all my paperwork done so that I can sub for the rest of the school year. I've only got a few months left, but a paycheck is a paycheck. 7's going to be making pretty good money, but we've got quite a few nasty things on our credit that I'd like to get cleaned up. I also am behind on my student loans and such and am tired of telling the people that I don't know when I'll have money.  Last night as I was getting ready for the job fair I pulled out the resume they had us make in our welfare class. I wrote it all down and then they sent it to their career help center to have it  typed up. I was glancing at it last night to see if there was anything I wanted to incorporate into my real resume that 7 was making for me when I found a typo. Being the punctuation and grammar Nazi I am, I began to read it looking for more errors. I about died laughing when under an entry marked Self Employed Homemaker it said that I had assisted with minor surgeries, taken vital signs, kept medical charts, and other such stuff. I must have had an illegal clinic set up in my apartment and not even known it. I swear, these people expect you to get a job, and then they go and screw up your resume like that. I'm really glad I didn't bother to give it to anyone. I think I'll send in a copy to our class instructor and show them the quality of work their people are putting out.   Now I'm just beginning to ramble. I'll shut up now.

          Here are your rose colored glasses dear...  It's always an interesting day when I read 7's blog and see how the world is for him. Most of the time I want to jump right over to my blog and do a rebuttal rant, but for the sake of his public and personal ego, I refrain. I know quite a few of his fans have an image of him in their minds that is far from my everyday reality and it just wouldn't be fair of me to ruin that, ya know? But today... today I have a bone to pick with Numerical Boy.  So he blogs about us moving into our apartment (our little house as Oliver calls it) and talks about how tired he. He says he loaded and unloaded the UHAUL. He credits me with changing diapers. HELLO?!?!?! I changed diapers? I didn't even have the kids that day because I was busy packing, loading, unloading, organizing, directing the other guys helping us, and keeping them all from either playing hackeysack or wrestling and body slamming each other on the ramp of the truck. I most certainly was not changing diapers. I don't know whose move he was helping with but it wasn't the same one I was working.   He also got to stop the moving process come Monday morning to go to work. I've been at it all week and I'm losing my mind. I had to look for 45 minutes today just to find the knife block after I dropped the knives on my foot. Luckily they are crap knives and pretty dull. Breakfast has been taking at least 30 minutes to get together for the kids each morning due to the constant reshuffling of boxes. I don't want to put anything in the cabinets there because the last people were pigs and I'm still cleaning the oh-so-hygienic particle board shelves. I've got a long list of unhappy things about this apartment, but it is somewhere we can call our own. I have a bedroom. I have a livingroom. I have my own kitchen again. YEAH.   I've left the kids with 7 for long enough. I hear screaming and wailing coming from the front room.

        Dr. Atkins is killing me from beyond the grave.... heehee    Ok, time for a diet update. I fell off the wagon. Well, actually, it was more like I was pushed. I was being my charming self and grumpily listing all the foods I was craving and wanting to binge on when 7 got up, grabbed the keys and walked out the door. He returned a short while later with McDonald's french fries, donuts and vanilla ice cream. I guess I complained one time too many. My parents came home shortly thereafter and gave me that disappointed look that only parents can give and made me feel about 2 inches tall. BUT I DIDN'T BUY THE STUFF!!!  I did eat it though. I mean geez, it was already in the house and you know that the fries get really gross if you let them get cold. But I took no joy in my forbidden fruit, and that really sucked. What is the point of cheating on your diet if you can't even do it without everything being flavored with guilt.  On a positive note though, I did lose like 10 lbs. before my stumble. I'm looking into the south beach diet as a possible alternative since you do get to eat some of the things I love on it, and still keep it relatively low carb. Sine 7 is still doing Atkins, I can work with the two diets for meal planning. I also found out that I'm 40 lbs. lighter than I was last year at this time. Of course, part of that was little Charlie in utero, but it's still lost weight all the same. :-)~   7 says I'm much nicer when I get to eat carbs. I guess I've been far less bitchy and mean. I suppose it wasn't just my food that was low in sugar.

      GRRR.... I'M GRUMPY!!  I've been in a bad mood today. Bad enough to make 7 actually ask me to like him. I guess I wasn't being too nice to him or something. I get in these funks every now and then and it pretty much gives me a perma scowl for a few days. Everything makes me crabby and mean spirited. A lot of it this time is worry about money, getting our taxes done, and getting moved.   Yesterday I drove down to LA for my bankruptcy hearing. I had to go by myself as 7 was working and my folks were watching the kids for me. I got lost as usual, but no biggie. So I met with the lawyer and the trustee and answered all the questions. Now I just wait to see if they grant my petition. Talk about feeling like a loser. I'm not even 30 yet and I've fucked up my credit so bad that I had to declare bankruptcy... a giant nasty black mark that will be on my credit for 10 years. I get really frustrated about it when I think about what I would have done differently had I known this was going to be my fate. But what could I have done so differently? We both had jobs when we bought the car. I was using birth control when I got pregnant, twice. I guess we just got a tough batch of cards dealt to us at first and hopefully things will be better in the future. Maybe we just weren't meant to live in LA. Maybe the universe was telling us that by sending all this crap our direction. Who knows. I sure don't. I have very few answers for anything at all. I have spent most of my life just floating in the current and getting pushed towards whatever was there.   About the only active move I've really made was dating 7 long distance. I could have easily just kept dating the fella I was already dating when I met 7. He was nice enough. But there was just something about 7 that made me change course. And now he drives me crazy! I swear, somedays I just wanna run screaming out of the house and not come back. He must be deaf, because I know he's not stupid. And even he has said he has perfected the art of laziness. This is a man who can't seem to carry his dirty clothes 5 feet to put them in a laundry basket. Instead he methodically builds the most disgusting mountain of fetid socks and oderific underwear right next to the bed. The worst part is that the fan blows right over it and bathes me in its lovely aroma all night. But he just can't seem to make it that 5 feet.  He also can ignore an obviously poopy diaper, a screaming child, or something like the garbage overflowing onto the floor for a week with impunity. It's only when I say something, quit doing the 18 things I was already doing, or yell at him, that he lifts his eyes from the hypnotic light of the tv screen and says, "Oh, I'll get that in a minute." This usually means one of two things; he'll get up and go hide in the bathroom till he is reasonably sure I've done it or forgotten about it, or that he'll go back to watching tv and then ignore my hostile stares and angry huffing in his direction until it's time for bed, then declare how very tired he is and pass out. Neither of which work for me.  Ok, so it's a rant about 7 kind of day. I told you I was in a bad mood. I'm hungry... I think this diet is making me grouchy because I'm always hungry. I don't like to cook and there just aren't any low carb convenience foods.  Urrrgh.

      7 just told me there is a blog out there called "A Girl Named Bob" (http://www.zweb-network.com/agirlnamedbob/) and for a split second I was annoyed. Then I looked at it and saw that she doesn't spell it like I do, so it's ok. I spell mine BoB. I sure have had a lot of weird nicknames. BoB Digum Desu, Luna the Moonchilde, Random Girl... but now I just answer to Mommy. Hmmm. Maybe I need a new nickname. Got any suggestions? Let me know. kaykaybates@yahoo.com

      My quest to find a new outfit got me all worked up. I went so far as to repierce my ears. They had finally closed up after all this time of not wearing earrings. I miss wearing them, especially since I got my hair all cut off. I feel rather unfeminine quite often, but I think this will help. I am going to need some new earrings though. All the ones I have are left overs from high school. I've got some that are snakes, some silver fish bones, a lot of shoulder duster ones with stars and moons from my Luna the Moonchilde phase,... I've even got some cows wearing hawaiian shirts. I suppose 7 will have start buying me some jewelry again. Maybe some lovely sparklies to match my engagement ring. oooh...

      "I was alone.... I was all by myself... no one was looking... I was thinking of you..."   Green Day  So 7 is down in LA all week for training. I'm going to go visit him tomorrow and we're going out for a friend's birthday. It'll be nice to have a kid free date night. I went out to find an outfit to wear since everything else I have to go out in has been worn to death and it's all getting rather baggy. I need bras desperately too. Shopping with two little ones is a bit trying. The double stroller doesn't fit in the trunk of my car very well so I took the single. That leaves Oliver to walk beside it. And to run off. And to hide in the clothes and play peek-a-boo and crawl under the dressing room doors and make mommy crazy. So the shopping trip was a doozy.   I hate it when 7 leaves. The saying "Absence makes the heart grow fonder" couldn't be truer in my case. I start to get really grumpy when we get close to him leaving because I know I'm going to miss him terribly. Then while he's gone, we call each other all the time, get all starry eyed and act goofy like we did when we were dating. Then when he comes home I love him like crazy again until he forgets to take out the trash or something stupid like that. I'm fickle I guess.   Don't get me wrong, I always love him dearly and he's my best friend in the world, but I let little things get under my skin and fester and make me not like him sometimes. I wish I weren't like that, but then again, he could just change the way he does things that bug me and we wouldn't have any problem. Heehee, like either of us are going to change like that. We're both very set in our ways.  I'm rather proud of myself this time. Last time 7 had to go out of town for a few days I was very paranoid and scared of people breaking in. I kept the kids in my bed with me and even locked the bedroom door. This time I'm feeling pretty comfortable in my home. I even left the bedroom door open last night. I can't do much about the kids sleeping with me since both of them are a sick right now. It's near impossible to get them out of there when they feel icky. Oh well, they keep me warm.   Ah, tomorrow night 7 can keep me warm with no little people to get between us... unless we pick up a few midgets at the bar!

      I'm back! I have been gone a while, I know. We don't have the computer set up in the apartment yet so I haven't really had a chance to blog. 7 brought home a laptop from work so I'm putting it to good use tonight.  I must make an apology to 7 for my last blog. I apparently misunderstood his meaning. So, sorry honey.  So we're all moved in, well, more so than we were in LA. I've got most of our stuff out of boxes and we're slowly buying the things we need to finish up the place. We got a kitchen table the other day. It really kicks butt. We bought it over at the resturant supply store and it's all stainless steel. Great for cooking prep since we are short on counterspace.  Overall I am happy about it. It's good to be on our own again. We've noticed that I am much easier to live with now. I'm not always worried about what Mom and Dad will think of anything we do or say, you know? We can be adults again!! Yeah!  So my reunion is coming up really soon. I'm begining to get a little nervous about it since I haven't lost enough weight yet. I've got a certain goal and I've come up a little short. I've been a bad bad girl lately about sticking to my diet. There is just so much stuff I wanna eat! I put myself back on the induction phase a few days ago and am trying to get some exercise each day. It's hard to be good when you're lazy.  Boy this is a boring blog. Sorry! I usually write when I have something to say.  Nothing good is coming to mind today.

      This blog is dedicated to all those people out there who had an unrequited high school crush. Here is the embarrassing and retarded account of mine.   &nbsp;  It was freshman year. I was sitting in my algebra class trying to be as much of a non-entity as possible, when my friend (let's call him Matt, since that is his name) came over to my desk began telling me really cheesy jokes. After about a minute one of the fellas sitting near me started to comment on it to his friend. "He's always over here at her desk talking to her and stuff. I think he likes her or something," he said, much to my chagrin. "Is this true Kayla? Does Matt like you?" queried his friend in a not-so-much-of-a-friendly-inquiring-kinda-way-so-much-as-a-looking-for-a-way-to-embarrass-you-type-of-way. "I don't know," I mumbled. "He's always over here&nbsp;acting dumb and stuff." At which point Matt clams up, gives me a look, and goes back to his desk.   And that was it... my magic moment. With&nbsp;the little seed&nbsp;planted by those weenie guys, I was head over heels in love.   So for the next&nbsp;4 years I was love sick and dopey. I wrote horrible poetry. I analyzed and reanalyzed every comment he made to me, every look, every sigh. I joined activities I never woud have if&nbsp;Matt &nbsp;hadn't been in them. I had it bad. We had two overnight meetings for an activity we were both involved in called Academic Decathlon. Both times we went, I stayed awake almost all night just to watch him sleep. One year we were there I wrote this terrible "stream of conciousness" type poem about how much I wanted to fix&nbsp;the holes in his socks and sew up his backpack. Oy!   Now that I've told you how braindead and loopy I was,&nbsp;I'm sure you can relate to the awfulness I went through when I had to sit through every conversation about the girls he liked, the girls who didn't understand him, the girls&nbsp;who did him wrong. All the time I was sitting there all I could think was "WHY NOT ME?!?"&nbsp;The worst it ever got was when we went&nbsp;to a birthday party for a mutual friend at our local park. Matt met a girl who struck his fancy. She had been throwing up shortly before he decided to go make out with her in the ball field. So I, being the ever mentally stable person I was then, decided&nbsp;to punish myself for being so awful that a perfect stranger&nbsp;who had been throwing up&nbsp;was a better choice than myself as a makeout buddy, by&nbsp;slashing the hell out of my wrist with a soda can. Worry not, it wasn't serious. Mostly just deepish scratches but it hurt like a mother.   Senior year came to a close. Matt signs my yearbook with something along the lines of "We've both&nbsp;meant more to each other than either of us will ever admit." What the hell?!&nbsp;Anyways, I went off to college and continued to write him letters and email all&nbsp;that first year with him replying and coming to visit me at home at Christmas. After that he dropped off the face of the earth and I didn't hear anything else about him for about&nbsp;4 years, by which time I had scoured the internet and found the man of my dreams and married him. I was pretty much over Matt by then... heehee.&nbsp; I spoke to him about a year ago and in my inebriated state told him about my crush on him. He claimed to have been oblivious. I don't know how... everyone else I knew was very aware of it.   So as you know if you bother to read my blog at all, my reunion is coming up at the end of this week. Hopefully Matt and is lovely wife Lori will be there. Also hopefully, he won't have read this and told his wife about it. I'd really have to die of embarassment. Oh well... I plan to drink before going, so maybe after a few cocktails there I just won't care even if it is brought up.   So there is my tale of love and woe. I hope yours is just as goofy and makes you feel as stupid as mine does. &nbsp;

      Ok... Friday night, kids are asleep, and what are we doing? We've each got a computer on our lap and are bored to tears. I'm reading other people's blogs and 7 is playing mp3's of Liberace and the disco version of the Star Wars Theme. We need serious help.   I think I broke my foot. A few weeks ago the kids kept falling on my foot while it was lying sideways on the floor. Each time it would make this awful cracking noise and I'd screech and boot the lead filled little one off. So now it is just sore all the time and occasionally makes me want to cry. 7 thinks I have a hairline fracture in my instep and that I should go to see the doctor. I feel like a schmuck because I just had an ultrasound on my left boob this week to check out a lump where Oliver fell on me with his elbow. I feel stupid going to the doctor saying that my children caused me major injuries. I can't help it that my 2 yr. old weighs 38 lbs. He's a big tall hefty boy. He's also very prone to tripping and falling on mommy. Charlie likes to headbutt me and has busted my lip more times than I can count. So I guess I'll wait and see if my foot gets any better or if it turns black and falls off. And hey, I can always drink to dull the pain.

      SHOP TILL YOU DROP&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  My high school&nbsp;reunion is less than 10 days away. I am shopping shopping shopping for THE outfit to wear. You know the one... it makes you look younger, thinner, more busty, less busty, more curvy, less hippy, hides those flaws and lumps, gives you oomph where you &nbsp;lack it. THE outfit makes you more knowledgeable of current events, political platforms and books currently on the New York Times Bestsellers list. THE outfit can erase all those stupid things you did in your past that people used to taunt you about in high school and make you into the person everyone wants to be seen with! That outfit. So far I haven't found it.  &nbsp;  Part of my problem is that I'm not quite sure what "semi-formal" includes. I was originally planning on wearing a cute little top and some jeans with nice shoes, but that is too casual. I don't want to be overdressed and come in something that looks like a bridesmaid rejected it.&nbsp;      &nbsp;   Mini-rant: Why do they make so many fat girl dresses with thousands of ruffles and weird asymmetrical hems and layers and layers of gauzy stuff? Like people are going to really think the dress is fluffy instead of your body. Fluff over fat just makes you look more enormous!! &nbsp;   I'm really just looking for something that I can be comfortable in and that at least looks pulled together. I would like it if my clothing didn't cause me extra cause for concern that night. I'm looking for a dress. Black is good. Red is good. Simple and comfy is fantastic. If I had time I would look into just making one. I did that for my brother's wedding when I was a bridesmaid. I was pregnant at the time and nothing at the stores seemed to fit right. So I just whipped up my own dress, and I'll be damned if it didn't turn out great. It was beautiful and so much more than I ever expected that I would be able to make.   I need to start going through the pictures I have of my kids and picking which ones to take with me. I know it's cheesy, but I'm so proud of these little boogers that I can't help but show them off. I can't take them with me, so pictures will have to do. I wish we were having like a picnic too so that those of us with children would have a chance to bring them along. As it stands now, I will pretty much be sitting and talking to people, hopefully, since I don't dance. At least with my kids there I would have something to keep me busy.   Ok, I told 7 I was going to get online for a few minutes once the kids were asleep and that was about 4 hours ago. I should go get some sleep and rest up for... you guessed it... more shopping!!

       Who's a girl gotta screw to get laid around here?   So I'm trying to get 7 to go upstairs and take advantage of me and he insists I blog. I guess he is really tired of reading the same sucky blog I left lying around the other day. I wanted to take a moment to apologize for that, by the way. I was trying to watch the Jimmy Kimmel show and write at the same time and it just didn't work. He does this thing on Fridays called Unnecessary Censorship that I just love. My poor overworked brain has too much going on to be able to formulate a witty blog and enjoy juvenile smutty humor.   I've decided to go ahead and post a picture on my profile for the school website I frequent. I won't bother putting the link because I doubt many people who read this went to high school with me. Anyways, I thought it would be a good idea to include a before and after pic. I used one of my cheesy model shoot pics as my after shot. I hope no one thinks I'm using it as a serious picture. I couldn't do my makeup like that to save my life, nor would I ever try to do something so "Glamour Shots" anyways. I'm lucky if I get a shower each day.  "Whiney bitch I hate you. Die c*nt snivel."- Random quote from 7 when he turned the TV to that retarded show "Starting Over."   I declared today that all I would eat for the rest of the month would be salad and slimfast. I broke my own resolution about an hour later when I smelled the stir fry I was making for 7 and the kids. I have no will power. Or maybe I just have gotten to the point where I realize that it doesn't really matter what I look like at the reunion, people will think whatever they want about me and I ought not care. Or maybe I just like good food. I think it's the last one. French fries and ice cream call to me. Right now a package of cheddar wurst are whispering to me from the fridge. I can feel the pop of the sausage skin and hot cheesy juice pouring into my mouth as I think about it. Sounds like the Paris Hilton video I just watched. Only she didn't swallow.  Oh crikey... The censor is on vacation tonight. I usually put quite a gag on myself when blogging because I know certain family members read this and I wouldn't want them to ever think I was some awful person who liked sex or had a naughty sense of humor, or who said things that were horrible or whatever. I have often thought about starting another blog where I can really just say whatever without having to worry about that. Only then I know for sure that no one would read it. A lot of my readers come from 7's site via the link he has there.   "Are you writing about my sexual prowess? ARE YOU PUTTING THAT IN?!?!?! YOU SUCK!!"- 7  Is Jeremy Piven gay? I sure hope not. Not that there's anything wrong with that. He's so cute. I wanna just keep him in my pocket and take him out to pet once in a while. You know, he was in one of the greatest movies ever. I speak of Grosse Point Blank, which was partially filmed in Monrovia, where I used to live. In one shot with John Cusack and Jeremy Piven, you can actually see the corner where my apartment was. Lots of stuff is filmed in Monrovia actually. Have you seen the cute Pepsi commercial with the hot dog girl and the Pepsi can boy falling in love? That was filmed there. I have stood on those corners many many times. I get homesick every time I see it.  Yeah, it is a big fucking random ass blog. Whatcha gonna do about it?!? Time for some schweet luvins.... get upstairs ya big weenie!

      Sitting at home of Friday night by myself...   Once again 7 is out of town. I don't mind the fact that he has to go out of town, I mind when something extends the trip unexpectedly. He was supposed to be coming home to me this afternoon but something came up and I won't see him till tomorrow sometime. We had planned to go over to storage again to get more stuff ready for the yard sale the 17th. We made a pretty good dent in it last week when we went. I'll just be happy to get the storage unit cleared out and get our stuff in a much smaller and cheaper unit.  So 7 thinks my blog would be more interesting if I did it like his and picked a topic and expressed my opinion. This came after a conversation where I said I think my blog is boring and can't figure out why anyone would want to read it. I thought about changing my format but then realized, I don't have any opinions worth expressing on any good topics. I have a lot to say about the public use of bad grammar, people who litter, typos, rowdy kids at the McDonald's indoor playground, snot, and my retarded body issues, but I don't know how much anyone would want to read. I mean, I could rant about the fact that I'm a college educated woman with no marketable skills. I went to an employment agency once and they laughed at me after they looked at my typing test results. I can type quickly but do tend to make a lot of mistakes as I have trouble not looking at the keyboard. I always go back and fix them, but the way the typing test is set up once you move past a word, you can't fix it. So whatever.

        The Sleeper has awakened....  The kids are taking their afternoon nap so I have a chance to blog. I was trying to blog the other night, but kept having problems. I think I figured out part of the problem. I was using the laptop on my lap and had it sitting on a pillow. I should have noticed something was up when my wrists began to burn where they were touching the keyboard. I attribute the freeze ups to the fact that I was overheating the poor thing. I'm sure 7 will love reading that.   So I've had no underwear for the past 2 days. Somehow in the course of doing the household laundry, I managed to forget to wash anything of my own. I try to make 7's work clothes and the kids' stuff first priority, followed by towels and bedding, with my own clothes bringing up the rear. Speaking of rears, I don't want anyone to think I was running around with no chonies on. I wore my swimsuit bottoms yesterday and this morning while I waited for my laundry to get done. I mean, if you really want to think of my naked butt, you can, I won't stop you. But you should get some professional help.   I took Charlie to the doctor yesterday. I really don't like her pediatrician very much. For one thing, she can't seem to remember that Charlie is a girl. She is sitting there reading the chart and keeps calling her "he" even though I keep saying "she". I'd finally had enough and said, "She is a girl. Just so you know." This woman is so annoying. She doesn't answer half of the questions I ask her and seems to be baffled by the simplest things. I asked about Charlie's belly button again (she has a pretty prominent outtie due to an umbilical hernia) and said it fills with liquid when she is particularly active. She looked very confused and says, "Fluid? Where?" Well, I thought we had covered that already when I said it the first time. She was similarly confounded by a little rough spot on the baby's back. She asked me if it itched, then looked at a red spot on Charlie's back where I had been holding her and decided the two were the same thing. When I insisted they weren't, she told me to lotion it. Great medical advice, no? So I'm thinking we're going to change doctors. The office is about a half an hour away too and I'm not fond of having to wake the kids up really early to make a 9:00 appointment out there.   7 is coming home tonight. I'm very happy about that. We've had to spend so much time apart lately  that it feels like it did when he was living down in LA and I was up in Bakoville with the kids. At least we get a 3 day weekend together thanks to the 4th of July. I know 7 is going to want to sit and relax but I'm going to make him work. We've got a few important home improvement projects to do. We've got to get the shelf up in the kitchen, the cabinets in the bathroom and the new faucet installed in the kitchen sink. I am going nuts trying to rinse the dishes when the space between the sink middle and the faucet are about 4 inches apart. I keep getting things squashed against the faucet and then spraying water all over myself and the kitchen. If you knew me really well, you'd know that I have a strange quirk about getting wet. I really hate the sensation of being squirted, splashed, or sprinkled on if I am not either in the shower or swimming. It just makes me crazy. So for me to have this happen on a regular basis just because I have a retarded faucet is too much. We also need to get over to our storage unit and get the stuff pulled out that we are going to sell. We need to get a much smaller unit for the things we are going to keep and paying $100 a month for a lot of empty space is silly.  Anyways, back to 7 coming home. He won't be getting back till later tonight so I'm not going to worry about making him a fancy dinner or anything. Oh hell, who am I kidding. Any time I cook it's a big event. I am going to give him a really great surprise though. Sleeping kids who aren't in our bed. He gets to come home and sleep in a bed not littered with kicking, wiggling, crying, headbutting toddlers. And who knows, I might even get to snuggle with him before one of them wake up!  Speaking of waking up... I hear the thump thump of Ollie's not so little feet upstairs. Time to go back to being Mommy.

        The fat lady sang...          Ok,   the reunion was this weekend and I will admit that I had fun. We had some drinks, talked a lot, laughed a lot, and I even danced with my husband. I rarely ever dance. In fact, 7 said there are only three things wrong with me; I don't dance, I don't like video games, ... and I forgot the third one. I felt bad about mostly talking to my friend Susan and not so much to my friend Jennie. Part of the problem was that she was sitting on the other side of 7 and that made it difficult to keep a conversation going. Regardless, I was really really happy to see her and it was very nice to meet her husband.     For those of you who read 7's blog as well, I have to speak up and correct a few things he said in his entry regarding the reunion. To start with, I'm not 28 yet... grrrr. And I wasn't feeling old because it's been 10 years since I graduated. I was never feeling old. I was feeling fat. There's a big difference. I was a fat kid, a fat teenager and now a fat adult. I've never really been very comfortable in my skin and since people have tended to randomly be mean to me about my weight, I tend to not be very comfortable in social situations. Not to mention that the ability to make small talk seems to have been handed out to everyone but me. It's like pulling teeth when I have to do it. So no, my apprehension wasn't based on age at all. It was all about facing a bunch of people who I didn't really feel so great about, to see the few people I loved being around.  I have come to a conclusion. I need a hobby. Problem is I would really rather just spend my free time with 7, but he needs a break from me every now and then. Besides, lately I've been acting rather grumpy towards him due to some unresolved household issues that are really just chapping my hide. So I think I'm going to try to find a group or something to join. I saw an ad for a book club, but I don't ever really have time to read. Besides, it was for English Literature, which is not my favorite subject. I'll keep looking.
