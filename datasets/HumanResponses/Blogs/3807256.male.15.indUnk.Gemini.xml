						   George W. Bush has ruined our country since the minute he entered the White House.  He brought us into a recession, and created an unnecessary war, among other things.  This blog will be completely devoted to getting Bush out of the White House and showing why.

						   There is a great quote from Nicholas Kristof on Al Franken's blog ( http://www.airamericaradio.com/bin/blogExcerpts.cfm?blogId=1&prg=3 ) this morning about Bush.  It is:         [Bush] has lied about his time in the National Guard, and lied about his criminal history. He lied about his relationship with Ken Lay, he lied about who would benefit from his tax cuts, and he lied about stem cells. He lied about his visit to Bob Jones University, he lied about why he wouldn't meet with Log Cabin Republicans, and he lied about reading the EPA report on global warming. He lied about blaming the Clinton administration for the second intifada, he lies constantly about how he pays no attention to polls, he lied about how he loves New York, and he lied about moving the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. He lied about finding WMD in Iraq, he lied about making his decision to go to war, he lied about the CIA's dismissal of the yellowcake rumors, and he lied about the IAEA's assessment of Iraq's nuclear program. He lied about funding the fight against AIDS in Africa, he lied about when the recession started, and he lied about seeing the first plane hit the WTC. He lied about supporting the Patient Protection Act, and he lied about his deficit spending, and now my wrist hurts.   I'm sure there are plenty more.

      I got home yesterday from staying with Loren since Saturday in Stamford, Connecticut, where she's training now.  We had an AWESOME time.  Mostly we just hung out.  We saw a movie, went to Greenwich, and watched "Friends".  The family she's staying with have 2 parrots that talk and are really funny.  We went to the parrot store in Stamford, and I'm posting pictures from there soon.

      Summer just started, and now everybody is off doing their own thing for the summer.  I made this blog so people can read about what I'm doing, and hopefully all of you will make comments here about whatever you want.  Tell me about your summer and what you're doing, or whatever you want.  Be sure to check out my other blogs:  New York Yankees: http://jakesingernyyankees.blogspot.com/  Getting George W. Bush Out of The White House: http://jakesingerbush.blogspot.com/  Loren & Skating: http://jakesingerlorenandskating.blogspot.com/

      I went out and did some shopping for clothes for JSA (I'm leaving on Saturday).  Then, I watched Coach K's press conference announcing he's staying at Duke!!!  For dinner, we went to Pizzeria Uno for my belated birthday dinner that we never went to...  At night, I watched Jay Leno interview Laura Bush.

      Happy Independence Day, everybody!  Today I went into the city with my mom to see the New York Philharmonic perform one of my favorite songs, "Rhapsody in Blue" by George Gershwin.  After, we walked around the city for a little while before coming home and watching the fireworks outside my house for a few minutes.

      Yesterday afternoon I watched the Yankee game, then baby-sat from 6:00 to 12:00.

      Once again, I didn't do much yesterday.  Last night my mom and I decided to go to Shea Stadium and see if we could scalp some tickets, and we did and saw the Yankees-Mets game.  The Yanks got pounded, but the Subway Series is always fun.  We sat next to a Japanese man who had just arrived from Tokyo.  He has a radio program that broadcasts all over Japan every morning and he was in New York to watch all 3 games between the Matsui's.

      I didn't really do that much during the day yesterday.  I hung out at home, watched some TV, read a little.  At night I went to go see "Fahrenheit 9/11", which I talk about in my Bush blog, and then I came home and watched the most incredible baseball game I've ever seen (besides Game 7 last year), which I talk about in my Yankees blog.  Today I think I'm going to go to Shea Stadium and try to buy some tickets for the Subway Series.

      This blog will discuss the Yankees and what's going on with them as the season progresses.  Hopefully I will able to put a summary of each game up every day, but we shall see...

      The Yankees bounced back yesterday with a 10-3 with over the Tigers.  A-Rod, Sheffield, Bernie, and Ruben Sierra homered, and Jason Giambi returned to the line-up after recovering from parasites.  The Red Sox were off, so the Yankees lead in the division is now 8 games.

      Tom Gordon gave up a home run to Ty Wiggonton in the 8th to lose it for the Yanks for the sweep.  Mets fans, keep in mind that you have NO bragging rights over us.  We swept you TWICE last year, we're the best team in baseball, and in first place.  The Mets, on the other hand, are struggling to stay at .500 and are in third place.  Red Sox got hammered by the Braves.  The Yanks should have an easy week this week though, home against Detroit and Tampa Bay.

      The Yankees lost in the bottom of the ninth yesterday on a ground ball that Tanyon Sturze couldn't handle.  Red Sox won, so they picked up a game.

      I went last night, and the Yanks were POUNDED last night.  Jeter had a decent game, as did A-Rod.  For the Mets, Kaz Matsui homered twice.  The Red Sox lost 6-3 in 12, so the Yanks still have an 8.5 game lead.

      The Yankees played the best game I have ever seen (besides Game 7 last year) against the Red Sox last night in 13.  Manny Ramirez homered in the top of the 13th to take a 3-2 lead, and even when the Yankees were down to their last strike, they scored 2 runs to win 5-4.  Derek Jeter made the greatest catch I have ever seen in the 12th.  The Yanks play this weekend at Shea Stadium against the Mets.  Tonight is Mike Mussina agaisnt Steve Trachsel.

      So far this season, the Yankees are 49-26, 7.5 games ahead of Boston (42-34).  Tonight, the Yanks play the Sox at Yankee Stadium.  Brad Halsey will pitch against Pedro Martinez, and this weekend the Yankees go to Shea Stadium to play the Mets for an easy series.

       Goodbye to Georgetown, the place that has been our home for the last 3 weeks.  Goodbye to uncomfortable shoes, uncomfortable clothers, and getting up obnoxiously early.  Goodbye to drama in the dorms and dirty communal bathrooms and to abnormal cafeteria food.  Goodbye to the bad times, the good times, and all the memories in between.  Goodbye to the summer romances, the heated debates, the Sundays off, and the makeshift birthday parties with cakes made of Twinkies and Nerds.  Goodbye to to sneaking into each others rooms after bed check and giggling until 2 in the morning.  Goodbye to dancing dressed in silly clothers, playing 10 fingers, and meeting scary people in the metro.  Goodbye to pajamas and bare feet as appropriate classroom attire.  Goodbye to sharing pints of ice cream and boxes of Chinese for every meal.  Goodbye to the most interesting, talented, diverse, motivated, and intelligent group of people I have ever known.  Goodbye to JSA Summer School.  by Erin Elbel
