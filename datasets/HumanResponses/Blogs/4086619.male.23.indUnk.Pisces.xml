       "Such a stellar monument to lonliness"  -  The Places You Have Come To Fear The Most, Dashboard Confessional      Hey, I gotta go to work in a few minutes so this won't be anywhere near as long (or as pseudo-profound) as yesterdays entry. I'm going to spend five hours serving little old ladies and people desperate for a big lotto scoop so I might as well put my brain on standby right now! Anyway, the thought for the day is what the hell causes us to change? I mean think about it, have I changed since you first met me? Probably.  Something causes us to constantly evolve and I'm not sure I'm really able to keep up.   Maybe it's just the way I feel today. Maybe working on an old song with Dave Tobin (forever after to be known here as Dave T) has got me thinking about the past. The song, "Make Up and Make Out" meant a hell of a lot to me when I wrote it over two years ago. And it still does mostly. And the person that I cared about enough to write the song is still somebody I care about. But it's not the same. The Dar of two years ago (who was still mostly Darragh then I suppose) was a very different guy. I figure he'd get on with the present day variant of himself but I don't know how much he'd really like him? Fortunately I like him.  And I like my boss. Even though his phone call earlier asking me to cover for somebody else who was sick means I'm gonna miss tonight's football match. Limerick Vs. Kilkenny City will progress without me. As will the lives of all the people I've touched upon (except for the few who happen to pop into the shop while I'm working tonight right?)  Sometimes I wish I was stupid! :-p T'would be ever so much simpler! Actually I don't...

           "All good things have endings" -  Forgive and Forget, The Get Up Kids       &nbsp;  This seems like a good place to start then, this is the beginning of my blogging. I don't know how it'll go, if it'll fall into disuse like a million other things or if it'll buck the trend and last. Whatever, for now it's gonna be a beginning right? That might change come tomorrow but let's try and stay in the present and not get suckered into worrying about the past or the future.   I am 23 years old. I've just finished a degree. I play bass and sing in a band called  "My Pet Giraffe"  and I play bass in another called  "The Dirge"  (who are on a bit of a hiatus at the minute). I'm bored. And a little lost. Looking for some kind of direction I suppose but not yet ready to commit to anything concrete and real that would involve folding up my dreams and finding my niche in the real world. For all the dreams that have been torn apart recently I'm still reasonably content in my little rut. A little variety might be nice though. Tedium makes fools of us all really, it makes things make sense when most of you knows that they shouldn't (try the sentence you've just read as an example).  You wanna know about my past? It's pretty boring. Parents divorced, oldest of three kids, school, college, a handful of part-time jobs, the usual stuff for the small town kid who got sick of the small town at about the same time as it got sick of him. Move to the city (Limerick, 80,000 people in this case) and discover that it's not really a whole lot better, just bigger. Which probably does make it a little better. There's more bored people for one thing. And more to do. So boredom can be countered to some degree.  My present? I'm a poor mans Peter Parker. Minus the powers. Minus the costume. Minus Kirsten Dunst. Growing up takes too long. And it's not a nice trip either! Maybe my life is a Counting Crows song. Back when Counting Crows songs really meant something and before they started covering songs about taxis and writing hits for animated blockbusters (albeit a very catchy hit). Back when Adam Duritz was as lost as the rest of us. Surely there's more to life than music, football, some movies, an 80's cartoon nostalgia trip and a futuristic wrestling card game? Then why the hell am I finding it so hard to figure out?   Which brings me rather nicely to the future. I haven't a clue. Come Christmas I wanna have a demo recorded and I'll probably haul ass. No idea how far I'll go. A different city I figure. Maybe an even bigger one this time! Amazing huh? Let's finish on a more positive note. I'm kinda looking forward to it to be honest. Sprawl about in an ungainly heap for another coupla years and then have another look at the future and see if I can make my mind up. Kermit the Frog summed it up quite well really  "Life is like a movie, write your own ending, we've done just what we set out to do."  As long as I don't get too ambitious, I figure I can manage that!

        "Been around the world and found that only stupid people are breeding"    - 'Flagpole Sitta' - Harvey Danger   No work today. Good. Decent weather for once. Also good. Plans in place for the evening. Good Thing number three. Overall, my mood is pretty excellent.  Even if the new issue of Ultimate X-Men was another one that was really just building towards something so nothing really happened. *sigh* Next time no doubt... And with Bob and Don gone home for various reasons (The Swede and work respectively) I've had the house to myself the last couple of nights. And though I never thought I'd say it it's getting a little bit fucking lonely up there! :-p I dunno that I'm in any real rush to get them back but overall it might not be a bad idea!  Joanne dropped down from Galway yesterday, she's leaving for London (well near London) on Monday so we had a few drinks, I brought Niall, she brought a couple she hangs with whose names I can't remember, she told me I was lazy, yadda yadda yadda. It was good to see her again though. Besides I already knew that I was lazy so it's no biggy.  And tonight I am gonna be hanging with Liz it seems. Before she also leaves the country again at the beginning of next month. And Niall is trying to head back to France for three weeks. And I'm meeting Kitt again next Tuesday so I presume that she'll wanna tell me that he's moving to Bolivia or something like that (Hey, it beats "It's not you, it's me!" Actually if somebody actually moved to Bolivia to get away from me I'd actually be pretty impressed).  Alright today is still young. I shall go and do something with it. Even if that something is as simple as getting back into the wrestling card game I mentioned way back at the beginning of the blog.  For the sheer hell of it I'm gonna quote Shakespeare (who I think is over-rated as it happens but this is a great quote!):  "Life is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing..." - MacBeth.

            "I would stop time to stay with you"   - 'Last Summer' - Lostprophets  Ok, I'm actually listening to Idlewild still but I listened to this last night (after A Beautiful Mistake) so for the sake of variety I figured I'd put this at the top. Anyway, what to tell you. Work was work, nothing to write home about but nothing bad either. Actually I just realised that I gave my boss's brother the URL for this and he might be reading this... I do appreciate my job Johnny, you know that right? ;-)  Actually it's due to John's good nature that I was able to go hang out with Kitt on Monday and it'll also be down to John's good nature that I can repeat the trick next Monday or Tuesday. Well obviously it's down to Kitt herself too but I figure that anybody with enough brains to follow my sometimes rather fractured style of writing will have had no trouble figuring that out for themselves. Especially as the two people mentioned, John/Johnny and Kitt probably comprise 20% of my readership and are smart enough to grasp what I'm trying to say, whatever about the rest of you! :-p  I'm feeling like talking a bit of pseudo-smart crap today anyway so yay for that! Basically after a few months in which I kinda thought I was turning into a bit of a cynical, bitter tosser the old lovable (well more lovable anyway), self-deprecating but fun Dar appears to be on his way back. I felt kinda like the dude in 'High Fidelty' there for a while but things are getting to the stage that I like the way things are going again. They're not going anywhere much overall but it's comfortable. And after a few months where I felt like I was sitting on something really fucking hard and uncomfortable (use your imagination!) it's a relief (in more ways than one). It would remiss of me not to offer a clap on the back to the good people who put up with my crap when I was at my most ignorant. Your names have been noted and you will be rewarded (albeit in small pointless ways. Like Love). And those people who kinda dropped off the radar while I was doing my butterfly turning into a caterpiller impression, your names have also been noted and you have made 'The List'. This is not a good thing and some day you'll get yours! Only joking. Or am I??? Mwah-hah-hah!  Ever wake up in the morning and realise "I haven't fucked up yet today! I've got a 100% record of doing the right thing so far!" Things aren't really as negative as people think. Sure, our planet is a bit of a mess but fuck it, it's only life right? And no matter how good it is at the moment, it's only the shitty parts that makes times like this worthwhile. I think that the last month or so has been pretty great overall, the people that have been contributing to my life are truly great people who actually care about me. Some of them I've known for a long time, others for hardly any time at all but damn it, you guys rock. You know who you are. Either your names are on that list a few entries back or you're Dan Mooney who I forgot about at the time but also deserves a mention (especially for the day of Championship Manager/Bloodbowl).  I am in a rut, my long-term goals are hazy as hell, my medium-term goals non-existent and in the short-term I'm just trying to figure out whether I have time to go home and get a camera before I meet Joanne who's coming down from Galway before she leaves the country on Sunday. But, here's the good part, I like my rut and aside from maybe my parents, there's nobody in my circle now who'll be too down on me if I just squat here for a while. Let's get comfortable people! :-)

        "They'll stay with me, until I can see, until I can see that I'm no one"   - 'When I Argue I See Shapes' - Idlewild  Well I've got the same lyric as yesterday up because I'm still listening to it and it's still fucking excellent. Bob is starting to develop a twitch from exposure to it. About the only time that I stopped listening to it yesterday was when myself, Niall and Bob tired of watching the Olympics and I played the same song over and over again for a coupla hours making up words about pretty much everybody that I know. It made the lads laugh anyway and made me take a few seconds out from texting. :-p And this morning Bob made me do it all over again. Not that I mind really. I understand now why my brother does it for hours and hours at a time, long after everybody else in the room has gotten bored of it...  What else is there, well I'm back to work today which blows but I'm in good spirits and feeling a bit argumentative so woe betide any of the crap customers who pay a visit tonight. Of course I could channel my agression in a more positive manner and just give the floor a really great mopping but meh...  Going through a collosal amount of credit at the moment actually but I suppose it's worth it Bunny! :-p And on an aside, bon voyage to Trev who's gone to America today. For a week or 8 days or something. Anyway even though this is by far and away the worst entry in my Blog to date I am gonna finish up because this is sorta proving to be the quiet day after the heady dizziness of the last coupla days.  Stay happY my flock.

        "They'll stay with me, until I can see, until I can see that I'm no one"   - 'When I Argue I See Shapes' - Idlewild  Welcome back after a days absence Dar, yesterday was actually worth writing about for once so here goes. In a nutshell it was a day of both good things and bad things. So I figure I'll separate them into those two categories in the name of all things both anal and dramatic. Naturally we'll start with bad things (I hate them sooooo much!)   The Weather:  Mental note to self, wet weather and hopelessly baggy pants are not a winning combination. And while I had been warned about the rain in advance, an unusual streak of optimism meant that I ignored the little voice in my head that said "Baggies Dar??? Dude screw the fuckin' aesthetics of the situation, put comfort first for cryin' out loud! It's me, your subconscious who'll have to listen to your bitching afterwards!" So yeah, my pants got very wet but that aside who cares right? There are far worse things than rain.   The Movie:  Matt Damon has never been my favourite actor. After 'The Bourne Supremacy' he's slid all the way down my ratings system into Chris O'Donnell territory. And that's about as low as it's possible to slide. 'The Bourne Supremacy' is plotless, pointless, overlong and aside from nice shots in the action sequences devoid of anything worthwhile. It blew. In a way that I haven't had to watch a movie blow in a very long time.  Anyway, let's leave the negatives aside for now shall we? The positives were as follows:   The Music:  Picked up two CDs in Virgin for starters, a Yellowcard EP that's not bad and an Idlewild album that's not bad either and is in fact brilliant in places, most obviously on the top class 'When I Argue I See Shapes' which I've listened to about 100 times since I got home. In fact I'm listening to it now. Yay. I mean, I've seen Idlewild a few times and enjoyed them but I never really noticed this. Next time. Speaking of music I can also confirm a title for the  My Pet Giraffe   demo/EP thingy. It's gonna be called 'Invisible Wounds'. Which brings me rather nicely to the second positive thing...    The Girl:  The girl then, who regular readers may recall answers to the name of Kitt, was of course the reason for the whole trip. And while I'm wary of saying too much because she'll be reading this and I don't really wanna embarrass either of us! (actually she just texted to basically just get me to hurry up and finish). Alright then, here goes... Kitt is great. She's fun, she's sweet, she's got a nice American accent that occasionally slips into an Irish one and though I may later regret admitting this on so public a forum she's really, really pretty too. I am really glad that I met her, though she's the first American I've met who's grasped sarcasm and man is she able to use it! We didn't do anything huge, just got some food (well ok, I ate), bought some CDs, hung about a bit in the park and went to that horrible film (I'm really glad I paid for her now because I'd feel guilty as hell now!). I had fun, I think she did (though she was knackered so it was hard to tell :-p) and we've agreed to do it again. And she's even texted me since so she means it too. I think. Right Kitt? :-p  Overall it was a good day. And when not even the Dark Prince of Celluloid himself Mr.Damon can ruin your day you know it has to have been a good one. I'm still smirking (though that's probably because I have 'When I argue I see shapes' on repeat). Whatever the cause I'm pleased.

        "Can you tell me one thing you will remember about me?"    - 'Round Here' (Live) - Counting Crows   I'm up absurdly early this morning before work, especially considering I was out for a while last night. It was actually pretty decent actually. Just myself, Niall and prodigal son Don taking it easy and talking football in The High Stool where, believe it or not, there was actually some talent last night. The three of us are too jaded and cynical to have tried anything though (and the football was on too so...) but it made a pleasant change. The rule of three makes a difference. This has nothing to do with American Pie, just a simple rule that appears to suggest that anytime Niall, Don and Bon are together something idiotic happens. When there's just two of them there's no fear of fights or spelling out rude messages in stones on people's doorsteps or similar rubbish. So basically I refuse to go out with the three of them together now. And Bob was gone home last night so it was ok. For everybody. including Bob. Who met a Swedish girl.  Actually speaking of Bob and Swedish girls, I'm meeting a certain somebody in Cork on Monday. :-) A girl as it happens. And hopefully a real one. If it goes fairly well I'll doubtless talk about it at great length here. If not I might just pretend it never happened. And for the sake of some background I'll just say that her name is Kitt, she's 23 and living in Cork but from California (where a number of my favourite bands emerged from). So it's all god, especially as I haven't been in Cork in months and I fancy blowing some cash in Virgin too.  Yesterday the football gods smiled on me. Limerick beat Bray Wanderers 1-0 to climb up to second bottom in the league (take that Monaghan United) and Aston Villa and Bolton Wanderers both started their English Premiership seasons with good wins (2-0 & 4-1) respectively.  Life at this moment in time is full of promise and hope. It feels like it's starting to work again. And I gotta go to work now. Which sucks. I was gonna try and finish with something profound but I'm drawing a blank. Anyway here's to tomorrow. And a movie (though it's a week too soon for 'The Village')

        "I was tired of being tired"    - 'I Did My Best' - Soul Asylum   I feel good. Despite the spectre of work hanging over me (lesss than three hours away...) I am in flying form. I'm in such good form that if I wasn't in a net cafe I would be sitting at this computer in the nip, with something noisy and high-spirited playing in the background (for arguments sake we'll say Lostprophets). And no, I have no idea why happiness and nudity go together for me, they just do...  Anyway, I went to see 'I, Robot' last night with Niall and we both enjoyed it more than we thought we would. It's actually decent and though my tongue may turn purple and burst for saying it Will Smith actually turns in a decent performance. Yes, I'm as surprised as you are.  Watched a bit of the Olympics this morning too, mostly because my DVD player threw another strop and kept on skipping throughout the Family Guy DVD that Niall loaned me. I remember when I was 15, really getting into the Olympics but for some reason this morning with it's mix of cycling, shooting and even one of my old favourites gymnastics left me cold. Only the swimming and naturally the football kept my interest.  Anyway, I'm just gonna post this. Be good people, be good and Stay happY

        "We live to regret it, and we're trying to forget it,"   - 'How Does It Feel?' - The Galactic Cowboys      Hello, people who actually read this. I am rather tired because I fell into bed at some absurd hour last night and then I went and got up early as well so I could check my mail and do the net thing before work (at 1). So if I appear cranky and even less focused than usual so be it. Anyway, a few things of note happened.  First of all routine deepened. This really means that myself, Niall and Bob played chess and a little Playstation 2 last night. It's getting to be a bit monotonous especially cos I decimated all in my path again. Go me! To break things up a little though myself and Niall are going to the cinema tonight. Probably to see 'King Arthur'. And we went out for a while last night. Firstly with my Dad and one of his mates where we didn't pay for anything. Then we went to a more youthful pub where we bumped into Liz and Isabel and the night proceeded along usual lines (* edit: somebody took offence at what I'd written here... *  and we all end up in a 'friendly' discussion/argument that's always only seconds away from kicking off).  Though in happier news there's now a good chance that 'Ok', the piano song could be back on the agenda for the My Pet Giraffe thing. And on a related note, I almost changed the bands name last week. To 'My Internet Romance' but I kinda like what I have.  And finally somebody totally thrashed my story. I think it's just because they're too old/grown-up/conformist/boring to deal with the fact that it's not totally linear but still! I was hopeful that they'd provide useful criticism but well... they didn't really...  Anyway, in the interests of not rabbiting on like a loon I'm gonna wave goodbye for now.

        "Don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head"    - 'I Miss You' - Blink 182   Today, I AM FRUSTRATED. I'm not sure why, I just wanna run up to something, kick it really hard and then hobble around swearing loudly after breaking a bone in my foot. However in the name of setting the mood I'll start with some good things shall I?  1. Shelbourne FC 0 - 0 Deportivo La Coruna. Not the most entertaining of games but putting Irish football on the map takes precedence over aesthetic issues. A scoreless draw against a side that reached the Semi-finals of the Champions League last summer is a great result. Hats off to Nutsy Fenlon and the boys. No matter what happens in the second leg, you've done us proud! Well, me and the handful of  eircom  League devotees that read this. The rest of you are probably a bit bemused.  2. Got my revenge on Niall on the chessboard last night (I'm aware that Chess is hardly the zenith of cutting edge entertainment but I'm good at it so bear with me). I stumbled out of the blocks and I thought he was going to demolish me again to be honest because he streaked into the lead. This would have been twice in a row and would have put my position as undisputed number 1 amongst our group of degenerates under serious threat. But I buckled down, played my way outta trouble and demolished him instead. Then after he'd gone home I had the bit between my teeth so I thrashed Bob 3 times (the second win took me 4 moves). So I'm back in the hotseat. there at least with my crazy new chess set (Marvel Heros and Villians theme).  3. I've been listening to the new Blink 182 album again in the past coupla days (listening to it now in fact) and it is absolutely amazing. I mean it's really top class. The days of fart jokes are long gone it seems for Mark, Tom and Travis and in their place are some of the most complex, emotive and unique songs this side of the millenium. Ah... "Stockholm Syndrome", what a tune...  4. Speaking of music, My Pet Giraffe continue along their merry way, another support gig in the pipline for anybody who wants to know, come and throw things (hopefully support) in our general direction. And I'm considering abandoning my earlier magnanimous idea of throwing 4-5 possible titles for the Demo/EP thing on the website and allowing people to vote. No, now instead I've got a pretty solid idea of what I wanna use but it'll have to wait because it's the name of somebodies website and I should probably ask their permission first? If they're happy enough, I even have a great idea for a cover (front and back). :-)  Hmmm, after listing those things I actually feel a bit better. It's the little things that count, according to many many people since people started saying stuff. I don't really have any plans as such, think my brother might be calling over later on to join in the noisemaking/jamming practice type thing and just hang out I suppose. We'll probably watch cartoons. Though he probably won't show because he has a habit of not showing! :-p I think my Dad wants to meet up tonight too. There's the potential there for a really lame family are like buses gag but I shall refrain from making it. Niall will doubtless call over too (routine is setting in) and we'll probably do the chess thing again. And the Playstation 2 thing. And I could be making a phonecall too. Ain't that right helium-bunny? :-p

      *Note* I'm on a piece of shit public PC that stubbornly refuses to let me change the font colour or style. This does not amuse me. I'm a sucker for structure and this is messing mine all up!  "There's things I remember, there's things I forget, I miss you, I guess that I should" - 'Raining In Baltimore' - Counting Crows  Today is another one of those days when I can't quite figure out what kinda mood I'm in. I blame the past. I mean, for the first time in ages I'm actually looking to the future with a degree of optimism when the past rears it's head to take a big, big shit on me. Let's forget trying to fix what's gone wrong and just leave it buried for cryin' out loud. Some things are irreparable, as much as we might wish otherwise. If you're scarred, cover it, deal with it, sort it out and start afresh. I think.  There's a whole lotta something out there to be explored and hopefully you'll find your spot. We can't all be Zidane (with or without hair), hell most of us can't even be Dom Foley. But we're all somebody anyway and if you throw enough at the wall something will stick. Eventually. And hopefully it's bearable.  I'm getting closer to the time that I gotta make some decisions again. I'm tempted to just throw all the options into my beanie hat on scraps of paper, pull one out and hope it's the one that says "Do nothing!"  Oh yeah I messed up with the stupid, never tell the right time clock on this thing and the two posts before this are in the wrong order.  I'm gonna finish up here. Gotta coupla things to do before I go watch the Shels-Deportivo game.   For no reason at all I'm gonna list a few people who have been of some value to me in the last coupla months. This is not in order. And if you're not listed I either forgot you or don't rate you or just haven't really seen you much.  Niall, Don, Dave, Bob, Rob, Brian, Trev, John  and the ladies  Denise, Cack, Joanne, Sueanne, Gwen and Katelyn  Damn it, I know I'm leaving somebody out... this is probably a bad idea... :-)

        "Tired and walked away, said it's far when you don't have a place to go,"    - 'Explode And Make Up' - Sugar   I am in flying form. I do not know why. I will not question it. Actually I have a few ideas as to where this upsurge of optimism may have come from but they're not huge things by any stretch and shouldn't really have such a massive impact on me. Either way it's all good.  Played football with a load of lovable stoners today so I was by far and away the most productive/fit/useful player on the pitch and bossed a game in a way that I've never ever done before. It was a rather amazing experience, kinda like being Zidane for an hour or so (albeit with more hair) and I think I shall have fond memories of it for ever and ever.  No work today which was nice and I have some strange hours for the rest of the week which could make for some interesting times ahead. Too many early starts though (if 1 in the afternoon can be considered an early start?)  I would imagine that tonight will be spent watching videos with my hetero lifemate Niall. Just like last night. And far too many nights of late for comfort!  And on that note I shall depart.

        "Out of all this hurt we have, beauty doth become"    - 'Mourning' - Tantric   Today was a strange day to date, a mixture of good and bad things. Feeling a bit numbed by it all to be honest. Last night was a bloody weird experience too, spent it in a tiny flat with a gangload of Bangladeshi guys who were playing me Bangladeshi rock music and insisted upon me singing before I left. They sat in a circle around me on the floor with their eyes closed. Totally surreal but a lot of fun. I think. Kalam rocks!  Today I started recording the My Pet Giraffe thing. Dave T, the producer and sometime guitarist and myself laid down some tracks on 'Make Up And Make Out'. That was fun.  On the other hand, Niall gave me the worst thrashing I've suffered on the chess board in years. It may not seem like much to many of you but I got my tail handed to me. As well as an e-mail that's kinda confused me a bit and opened up old wounds. Reminds me of another lyrics, this time by The Gin Blossoms, "The past is gone but something might be found to take its place". Let's try and hold to that.  Gotta run.

       " If I'd known it was the last night that we'd spend together, I'd have tried a little harder to make sure you came "   - New True Lie - My Pet Giraffe   Ok, I know that self promotion is no promotion at all really but it's the only kind open to me at the moment for starters and secondly and perhaps more significantly I think it's a good lyric (though I only wrote it this morning and may have a change of heart sooner rather than later). Song is basically directed at a metaphorical ex-girlfriend where after two verses of whining about missing her the narraot (me I suppose) owns up to falling for somebody else and finally getting over the first girl. Puerile and juvenile I know but what the hell, I've been listening to a lot of snotty punk the last few days. And also a Funeral for a Friend EP I picked up yesterday. Tis good. Though the version of Juneau is not as good as the album version in my less than humble opinion.  Ah the songs for the demo are coming along quite nicely though I may have to scrap the song with the piano for reasons beyond my control. Actually, that's not entirely true, an apology on my part would probably smooth things over but I don't really think I did anything wrong and besides the overall sound is getting woosy enough so it's probably no harm to scrap it.  My story is going well also, I've actually gotten seriously good feedback (and some of it from a person who normally takes great pleasure in degrading anything I do) and I might actually keep this going. For a bit anyway. Wow, there's loads more than I wanted to type today but I couldn't be arsed really which is probably a good thing because it means that things in the real world are looking decent. Yay for me. And Limerick FC who managed their second league win of the season over Cobh Ramblers last night. Come on boys, only three points behind Monaghan now and we got them at home next!  Hmmm... I wanna go to the cinema cos I haven't in a while. What should I go see???

        "If I seem distant that's because you shouldn't see me crying, Ice Cold Ice"    - Ice Cold Ice - Husker Du   Orwellian titles aside I do have a bit of a bee in my bonnet today anyway so settle back a bit and get comfy. I dunno why but it hit me last night/this morning/some time that I shoulda been asleep but wasn't that falling out of love with somebody is about the worst thing you can say about somebody. I mean, look at it reasonably here. You go from saying, not literally perhaps, but in essence "You're amazingly special and wonderful" to "Actually, scratch that, I was wrong". And people wonder why exes can't usually get on after serious relationships??? Hello? Has 'Sex & The City' really made morons of everybody? The more I think about it I'd sooner be told "Dar, I don't think you have a single redeeming feature about you. Not even your laid-back, self-deprecating charm and dry wit. Seriously. You in fact suck," than for somebody to say "I don't love you anymore." I can handle somebody not liking me (probably just as well too!) It just means that they're wrong right? But when somebody recognises my usually unrecognised good qualities and then still comes to that conclusion after being about as far from that conclusion as it's possible to be at one point I think I'm justified in being just a little bit aggrieved. But enough about that. For now. I may return to this topic at a future date.  Onto other news, I had to work extra hours in work today because Tipu was sick. Tipu, if you are reading this then let me tell you that you also suck! Not as  much as anybody who might fall out of love with me but at least a little. Actually I don't mean that at all. Tipu in fact rocks. As one of only two people (Trev being the other) who made the trip out to watch My Pet Giraffe supporting local band Battery a coupla weeks ago he scores highly on the Darometer.  As does Sorcha who I saw unexpectedly for the first time in what feels like millenia today. It was good. Sorcha buys crazy birthday gifts. Not always practical mind you but always good for a laugh.  Anyway, I shall make tracks now. Possibly in the direction of home. I didn't get paid today though. :-(  And congrats to Shelbourne. Everybody still hates ya but you done us proud boys! :-D

            "And you stood at your door with your hands on my waist and you kissed me like you meant it. And I knew that you meant it" -    Hands Down - Dashboard Confessional   Well I figure that the title will have piqued the interest of the casual reader though truth be told the prospect of me naked in any weather should be enough to send most people screaming in terror into their homes. :-) Anyway, I didn't actually get naked in the rain though it would probably have been in my best interests to really because my stoopid baggy pants got soaked and I got bloody wet in general. About all that kept my spirits up was knowing that somebody was worse off than I was (she knows who she is! ;-) )  There was also a delighful training exercise at work. Did you know that we should try not to contaminate the food we sell??? :-o No really I'm serious. It took two hours to get this point across to us mind. It's all a bit of a moot point for me because if anybody will be spared the indignity of that bizarre deli uniform it's me (who said dodgy facial hair had no use?)  After that I went home and played music. The My Pet Giraffe thingy is eerily taking shape... which is a bit of a surprise to be honest. But no, I pretty much have the songs all written now, they just need to be tightened up a little bit and then we're ready to rock. A bit. It's kinda emocore and mellowish to be honest.  And it turns out that my second poster here was neither Denise or Sorcha but it was in fact Cack. So apologies to all three of them. Today I have no work. I also apparently have a visitor coming from Galway (instead of me going to Galway) but their phone has died so I really don't know what I'm gonna do with my day now... :-s

              "Stars are out tonight and you're the brightest one shining in my sky" -   IOU One Valentine - The Ataris      I'm in better form again today. I dunno if it's just because other people are fucking up more than I am at the moment and making me feel less like a walking disaster area or if it has to do with more subtle good things that have been going down. Though I have a runny nose that came out of nowhere for some reason. I suspect work with its ludicrously high temperatures that make walking home like a trip to the South Pole.    Anyway, what news... well I'm going to Galway tomorrow or at least that's the current plan. And I'm off on Saturday and could be going to Cobh for a match but I don't really think I'm up to St.Colman's Park again just yet so will either just go as far as Cork or else not go at all. :-) Probably the latter. And when I went home on Sunday to play Championship Manager my Limerick team continued to punch above their weight which made me happy. And I bought the last Dashboard Confessional album in the last few days and it's mostly pretty good too. So overall I'm content as the proverbial pig. I can't think what else to write. I have vague memories of having a bit of a run in with a customer at work last night and that might be a bit entertaining right? Sadly though I'm rather blurry on actual details... never mind, I'd probably come across looking like the bad guy anyway so maybe it's just as well that we don't swell on that.  I think I shall go to the cinema again actually. Might go to see Spiderman 2 again with Niall cos he hasn't seen it yet... Thought I, Robot looked decent the first time I saw it but now I'm really not so sure. Blah, I'm getting a bit bored here... but still happy. Hurrah! :-p

       "I wanna be in the minority, I don't need your authority, down with the moral majority!"   - Minority, Green Day   Today I feel a bit less comfortable than I have done for the past coupla days. Dunno why. I suppose I kinda feel that I've sorta regressed a wee bit in a few areas of my life. However it's not all bad. For starters I've had my first two comments on my Blog. Yay for me! However sadly I'm not sure who they are... :-( I think that one of them is either Dave Graham or Rob and the other is either Sorcha or Denise. Own up God damn it! Don't keep me in suspense any longer please!!! :-)  The other positive thing is that I started writing a suicide again. It's called 'Jessica Suicide' and it's about a guy remembering and trying to deal with the suicide of a good friend. I nicked the title from a Bad Astronaut song that Armchair Martian covered and away I went. Feedback so far is good. Yay for me! Anybody who fancies test-reading e-mail me or whatever and we'll sort something out. Go on, you'd be doing me a favour and it's cheaper than actually buying a book!  Dragged another drummer on board for the My Pet Giraffe demo and am meeting my manager tomorrow to sort some stuff out (Ooh, my manager, it makes me sound like a real old pro doesn't it?) Will hopefully start recording that soon enough. Anyway, enough about that. If anybody does wanna go more, then go back to the website.  Also I'm getting my ass in gear as far as some proper movement goes. Hurrah for me. I'm off work this Wednesday. Originally I planned to go to Dublin to take in Shelbourne Vs. Croatia Zagreb in the UEFA Champions' League 2nd Round 2nd Leg (that's football for the uninitiated). Now instead I'm going to Galway. Primarily to hang with Joanne before she leaves the country. Though I will prolly text Rob and Sorcha too. Trips also being planned to Cork (for music & people), Dublin (music and/or football) and potentially London (for people and football) also all in the pipeline.  I realise that today's entry lacks the semi-deranged warblings of before. Rest assured they will be back. I just worry that if I head in that direction today I will slip right over the edge into full-blown dementia. And not turn up for work. And lose my job. And have no money. Which means no trip to Galway. Or Cork. I hate vicious cycles don't you? Anyway that's why I'm staying away from Soul Asylum territory today. And listened to Green Day earlier instead. Laters my flock.
