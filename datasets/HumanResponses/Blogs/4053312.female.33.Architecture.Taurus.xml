						   I want to thank everyone that has posted comments.  Thank you for your words of wisdom.  I have had a lot of questions about how long the surgery will last?  Who is going with me?  Who is watching Brandon and DeeDee?  What hospital?  How long I will be in the hospital?  Here are some answers:  I have been told by someone that has had the surgery that it takes about four hours.  In all of my excitement, I forgot to ask my doctor.  Duh!!!  I have to be at the hospital at 6:00 on the morning of Tuesday, August 3, 2004.  I am leaving from home on Monday night and stay in a hotel in Ocala to be close.  Anyone that knows me, knows that I am not a morning person and this is the best option.  ;-)   I will not be alone.  My very dear, supportive, and loving friend Carlos will be with me from the time I leave home until the time I return home.  He has been going to Ocala for doctor's visits up to this point.  He has been in this with me from almost the very beginning giving me informaiton to help me decide what procedure I wanted to pursue.  I feel that I am in capable hands.  With GOD's help he will take care of me.  So, don't worry.  My mother will be at home with Brandon and DeeDee.  I have not told them yet.  I am still not sure if I will, but knowing my very nurtring mother, she will think of something if I don't.  I just want them to know how very much I love them, and that they are my motiviation for doing this.  Here is the hospital informaiton: Ocala Regional Medical Center 1431 SW 1st Avenue P.O.Box 2200 OcalaFL  34478 Telephone: (352) 401-1000  I am suppose to be in the hospital for three days.  I am hoping to be back home by Friday or Saturday.  If you want to know how I am doing, you can call the hospital and talk to Carlos or me if I am up to it or call my mother at home.  I am excited.  I made contract with someone that had the surgery two years ago.  She was very helpful in answering my quesitons.  I feel a little better.  She is going to help me as much as she can.  I ask that you all continue to pray for me and my family.  I love you all.  Tina

						     I am 33 years old, I am 5’8” tall, and I weigh a whopping 300 pounds.&nbsp; For my friends I know that this may be a shock.&nbsp; It is a shock to me.&nbsp; I have been overweight for about 10 years, but never as heavy as I am now.&nbsp; I have always been what people call "big boned" (What ever that means).&nbsp; I can’t even blame my weight gain on child birth because my weight started to rise out of control when I stopped playing basketball and I graduated from college.&nbsp; About a year and a half ago my uncle (Ronnie) whom I love very much passed away about a year and a half ago.&nbsp; I decided that I had to do something drastic to make me lose weight.&nbsp; The hurt and pain that I went through at that time helped me to see how precious our time on this earth is, and I was wasting mine.&nbsp; My family has a history of diabetes and heart problems on both sides.&nbsp; On my mother’s side of the family I have had one uncle pass away with diabetes and cancer; two of my surviving four uncles have diabetes, as well as both of my grandparents.&nbsp; On my father’s side of the family I have had one aunt pass away from cancer, my one surviving aunt has diabetes, and so does my grandmother.&nbsp; I want to do what I can to make sure that I do not have these problems.&nbsp; I have a 6 year old and an 8 year old, and I want to be here to see them become adults and have their own families.&nbsp; Heck, I want to be here to see my grandkids start their families.&nbsp; My surgery date is scheduled for August 2, 2004 (exactly 7 days from today).&nbsp; I have just become very scared.&nbsp; Not because I am having second thoughts about the surgery, but because of the unknown.&nbsp; I know that  GOD  will bring me and my family through this.&nbsp; I will just continue to pray and ask the  LORD  to watch over me and my family.&nbsp; I know that he has a master plan for us all.
