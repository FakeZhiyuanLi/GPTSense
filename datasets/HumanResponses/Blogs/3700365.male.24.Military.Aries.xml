      HMP Leconfield as i like to call it was a little more chilled out from the first 2 places i'd been, however they do have the tendancy to lock the gates every now and then with no explanation as to why or for how long hence the name HMP Leconfield. I did all my driver training here and did very badly as usual but still passed my tests including hgv. There is only really one story i remember from this place and it goes as follows. As every young soldier does i got stung to do a guard duty on the gate, well vehicle check point really i like to call it the dunny for reasons i am about to tell. it was about 01:55 and i was just on my way out for a 2 hour stag when i all of a sudden needed a number 1 but i was going to be late if i didnt go out now so i thought i could hold it for 2 hours easy. about 1hr and 15 minutes into the guard i was in complete agony but i darnt leave my post because the provost sergeant was really scary so i thought well theres no cars gonna come in at this time in the morning might aswell do it here. So i sneaked around the back of the VCP and started to have a number 1 it was heaven i almost felt like crying with pleasure. But wait a minute whats this! I cant have a number 2 aswell can i. But i had no choice in the matter it just came out like it was supposed to be or something. When i'd finished disaster struck where was the toilet roll arghhhhh!!!! so in the end i ended up sneaking to the real toilet anyway looking like the hunchback of notre dam. Not a very nice experience.

      During my time at bassingbourne i had only 1 thing to look forward to, the only thing that kept peoples hopes up it was the royal school of signals blandford AKA The Promised Land. During my train journey there with about 5 massive backs full of army kit stacked on the shelves of the train i actually went for a number 3, thats a number 1 and a number 2. but whilst on the thunderbox the train actually came to a stop at peterborough train station where i wanted to get off i quickly finished what i was doing and grabbed my bags and jumped of the train. As the train began to depart i quickly realised that i left my little bag on the seat where i was sat. What was in the bag is another story that im not going to get into but there was 4 rifle magazines my id card and some food. As if by fate the queen was also travelling by train on the same day to visit a pub up north somewhere. You can imagine what happened then. The bag was found and caused a massive security scare which inturn caused the queen to cancel her trip. The moment i walked into the offices at blandford i heard "SIGNALLER BROWN GET YOURSELF INTO MY EFFING OFFICE NOW!!!". And that was the start of what was to become yet another nightmare in the training tiology. I left there fully trained as a combat driver lineman and fully aware of what the regimental policeman are all about.

      Well i started out actally as an apprentice electrician and sometimes wish id have stuck at it. I joined the army when i was 17 very young and nieve. I didnt know what i was going to do in the army i basicly got pushed into the job by the careers advisor. I went to Scotland to attemp the selection course and i just scraped through fitness test and even the medical. so there i was on the train to ATR Bassingbourne to start what was to become my worst nightmare it still has an effect on me 7 years on. 3 months of pure pain mentally and physically. I remember standing there on parade looking down at the pebbles thinking what the hell am i doing here i dont belong here, i was about 7 stone, very weak and i looked about 12 years old i didnt fit in at all. Allthough i had some very good friends then it was still very hard to blend in. After 3 months of abuse the big day finally came pass out day. It was the best day of my life i thought id never see it. there i was standing there infront of all my family with my highly polished boots on and crisply iron uniform i felt like a king. The troop sergeant was stood behind me when all of a sudden someone in the crown started laughing really loudly and pathetically "oh my god who the f**k is that" he whispered in my ear. Little did he know it was actually my mother how much of a prat did i feel thanks mum.
