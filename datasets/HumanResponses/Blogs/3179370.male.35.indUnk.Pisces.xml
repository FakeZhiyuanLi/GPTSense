      This past week was seasoned with the intermittent fear that I might be called to jury duty. For some reason or another, I have never been asked to jump in the pool and this was my first time to the courthouse downtown. At 7:45am, the courthouse hall was packed with potential jurors. They corral all of us into a room with a lectern and television monitors. A couple of sweet ladies and a retired judge explain the system and the procedure along with some industrial films extolling the virtues of our civic duty. My favorite was the talking head who stated proudly that he and his fellow jurors have stayed in touch through the ages and do fun things together socially. From the vibe I was getting in the room, I didn't quite think that I was going to be making life long friends. To be sure, every one had books, organizers, notepads, palm pilots, and cell phones - various and sundry things to while away the time. Noon comes around and we are released to our lunch break.  I discovered that you can get a lot done in one and a half hours down at the Civic Center. I visited the new cathedral, Olvera Street, and managed to wolf down some substandard Japanese food off some steam table. Around 1:35pm, one panel is called out and the room becomes alert and full of bristled hair and good pimples. Mercifully, my name is passed on. And back to my reading. If there is anything good about jury duty, I get to catch up on my summer reading like it's nobody's business and I continue to plow through this Bill Wilson autobiography I have been picking at since March. The PA system goes on again at 3:40pm. They are familiar words asking if every one that is out in the hall can please come back to the main room. Again, the room's energy spikes, but this time with an incredulous hue. I think, there's no way in hell that they are going to call a panel at 3:40, as we are to be released somewhere between four and five. The voice announces that we are indeed being let out early. The crowd hoots and howls and claps and hi-fives. It's as if the Laker's won the championship again. Which leads me to wonder. Jury of my peers. So, if I ever get sued for some reason or another (and this is not wishful thinking), does that mean that the jury selected would be composed of a group of people who don't want to be there at all? That would love nothing better than to be anywhere else?   "It is the spirit and not the form of law that keeps justice alive." - Earl Warren  Can I get a witness?

      So, my friend and I went to go see a documentary called "The Gift" last night. http://www.thegiftdocumentary.com/ At it's center, it chronicles the stories of two young men who consciously seek to get infected with HIV. One is completely regretful with his choice, while the other one appears to be glassy-eyed, if not somewhat satisfied that he reached his goal. The film encompassed so much more than these two tales though. They interviewed doctors, long term HIV survivors, and many others to give a pretty well rounded discourse about why we as a community are still finding the HIV rates going up. After the screening was over, there was a panel discussion with the director and a few other "experts". The one panelist who really impressed me was Mark Thompson. I've done some research and he was written a number of books such as "Gay Spirit", "Gay Soul", and "Gay Body" which I am going to ad to my ever increasing list of summer reading. The director stated that she feels that the problem at hand is two fold: first, the prevention campaigns are not effective. She used the analogy of that devastating television ad where a woman smokes a cigarette through a hole in her throat. On the flip side, we have HIV drugs and prevention ads with buffed-out mountain climbers, rich and healthy Magic Johnson, and a Hep-C campaign that lists all of the horrific symptoms that can transpire over a set of washboard abs. Even this new Crystal=HIV campaign that is all over NYC right now has the image of a circuit boy and a mirror ball. What none of the current campaigns seems to do effectively is associate HIV with illness and death. Point well taken. Secondly, she stated that she felt that we were in the midst of a "spiritual crisis". That view leads right into the masterful words that Mr. Thompson spoke of last night. He really feels that the root cause of the issue is the huge level of self-loathing that the gay community experiences and expresses today: that it comes from our larger society that does not accept or appreciate us and that we take that in and perpetuate it within our own. To take a more positive spin on this view, what we need is more self-love. He posed the question, "Why do we seem to have this need to erase ourselves?" He also alluded that before HIV, we were besieged with alcoholism. Mr. Thompson feels, however, that we are on the right track and that we are getting to the point where one day, when a gay child is born into a family, that child will be looked at as a special gift to be treasured rather than an anomaly or a defect.  The bottom line is that the film achieved it's goal: it opened up much needed dialog. And it now appears to me that the collective whole needs to be talking a whole lot more. It occurs to me that we are now charged with the greater duty to coalesce as brothers and find some spiritual common denominator.

      So once again, I fall asleep watching "Grey Gardens". I put the sleep timer on my TV to sixty minutes and peacefully doze off of the ramblings and musings of the two Edies. I cannot explain why these two ladies are such a comfort to me. It's like a cup of valerian root tea for me to hear Little Edie chime, "This is the best thing to wear for today, you understand. Because I don't like women in skirts and the best thing is to wear pantyhose or some pants under a short skirt, I think. Then you have the pants under the skirt and then you can pull the stockings up over the pants underneath the skirt. And you can always take off the skirt and use it as a cape. So I think this is the best costume for today. I have to think these things up. Mother wanted me to come out in a kimono so we had quite a fight." There's no accounting for this passion, but that I take comfort in knowing that I am not the only one.

      Tonight was class #5 in my eight week Lovingkindess meditation class in Santa Monica. Tonight, instead of offering metta to a benefactor or a dear friend, we were asked to offer lovingkindess to a neutral person - like a cashier, or someone in the building who you don't really speak with, or a shop clerk, or that same lady who sits at the same bus stop every day at the same time. It's a trip because in doing that, no one remains neutral much longer.  I've dropped the ball in my meditation practice over the last couple of weeks. I have become distracted and somewhat willful. It doesn't hurt that we didn't have class for two weeks. Well, WE didn't have class on Memorial Day, but I was gone the week prior to the opening Madonna show at the Forum. I half joked to myself that instead of doing Buddhist practice, I would be studying Kaballah with Madge that evening - ha! Om shanti, shanti, shanti-hi.... Well, after all is said and done, tonight's class has me charged up again, in a very subtle way. I look forward to offering metta tomorrow morning when I arise and begin my day anew.

      "You stand on the brink of greatness. The world will open to you like an oyster. No... not like an oyster. The world will open to you like a magnificent vagina." Helen Sinclair in "Bullets Over Broadway"  HI+fiVe was amazing once again. What an amazing crowd. House music heals the soul. It never fails to touch me deeply what sort of transformative properties that house music has on people. The most common question during the evening was "Where else to you spin"? Looks like I am going to have to find another place to hang my hat and do my thang for the people.

      OK, although I am paying the price right now (in terms of delirium!), going to the Prince after-show at the House of Blues was the best shot in the arm that I've had in a long time. I'm still getting palpitations when I think of the joint slamming up and down and he sang "All the Critics Love U in New York", which he changed to "L.A." I'd never heard such a thing - it was like this live funk-tech-ska thing going on and the whole place was bouncing up and down like crazed pogo sticks. Even the girl who poured her drink on me twice couldn't bring me down. Not to mention "DMSR", "Controversy", and "A Love Bizarre". Oh, and the covers of "Knock on Wood", "I Know You Got Soul", and some fierce Santana jams. And Sheila E. on timbales. Steen and I bonded closer than ever (ever expanding on the initial bond we made when I whipped out Malcolm McLaren's "Madame Butterfly" as my last song one night when I was spinning at Cherry ten years ago!). We really got to go back and feel like we were fifteen year old Prince freaks again, and that is an indescribable good feeling indeed. And we lasted until 3am - whew! I am truly blessed...Purple love and more...

      Have you ever spilled a package of dried capellini on the kitchen floor? You have no idea how difficult it is to pick it up. How on earth I found playing pick-up-sticks as a child is beyond me. Thoughts on Biology - what does knowing about glycolosis, the Kreb's cycle, and the electron transport system have anything to do with my life. I'm so grateful that my cells are respirating, but let's just leave it at that. Prince rocks. I'm still awed by his talent. How many years of being a fan and I'm still completely enraptured by his music. If I were to be on a desert island, I shall take with me for sure "When U Were Mine", "Joy in Repetition", "Anna Stesia", and "Sometimes it Snows in April". And thinking of these songs makes me miss Kenny Wilson even more so. I'm not going to have those deep conversations of His Royal Baddness' LoveSexy philosopy with him again - "Have U had Ur plus sign 2day?" So, I shall continue to funk in his honor, much the same way that I spin in honor of Billy Limbo. Peace, Q

      Well, here we go - Quinn C. joins the blog generation. I have no idea what musings I will be posting up here, but it seems fitting that I have a place on the info-superhighway to present my musings and ramblings and inspirations and creations. But now, it's time for bed. Namaste, Q

      I have had numerous folk this week comment on how ducky it is that I have this blog. However, I had one comment that there was no recent posting placed upon the site for anyone's perusal! So, I submit this in an ongoing quest to keep the ball rolling and try to put something up at least once a week if not more. This evening, I have been asked to spin at this party in the Valley where I have been asked to play a variety of RnB tunes before the guests are whisked away to the Al Green concert at the Greek Theater. The first level of joy in this process is in pulling records and CDs to play. Going through my tunes, just the mere sight of titles gets me all warm inside. Here's a list of some of the classics that I have glanced at that really lit me up: Lovely Day - Bill Withers Rock Steady - Aretha Franklin I Don't Want to Lose Your Love - The Emotions Running Away - Roy Ayers Was That All It Was - Jean Carne I Want You Back - Jackson Five Love's Theme - Love Unlimited Orchestra Oh Happy Day - Edwin Hawkins Singers (ok, this is gospel, but it makes me very happy!) Clouds - Chaka Khan You Are My Friend - Patti LaBelle Move On Up - Curtis Mayfield Ah...They just speak for themselves, better than I can try to put down in words. And especially in anticipation of their delivery on a warm Summer afternoon in Los Angeles.
