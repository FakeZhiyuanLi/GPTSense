       Laundry   I could not do it. I could not face the DMV, instead I did the stay at home mom thing-laundry. When my 11 yr old daughter was in preschool, she made a card for me for Mother's Day. Part of the card was about what Mom liked to do....my sweet little girls said-you guessed it-laundry.  I explained to her that I don't like doing laundry, but I have to do laundry so we can have clean clothes to wear. Is that what my kids think? That I like to clean and do laundry? I don't think any other mother's card said that mom liked to do laundry. I think I need to make the girls start doing their own laundry-they can reach the knobs.   Pizza   Take out pizza. I am very picky about take out pizza. I do not like most of it for some reason. So tonight was a huge debate about pizza. My oldest daughter and husband always suggest Pizza Hut. I said, "What Pizza Smut?"  Which lead to a discussion about a delivery pizza/porn place-you could have your pizza and porn delivered at the same time. I thought it was kind of amusing.  I know, I have strange thoughts, but I never said I didn't.   Vacation Planning   Tomorrow is vacation. Three days with my father, his friend, my sister and her husband, their three daughters, my husband and my two daughters. Part of me doesn't want to go. Somedays I can barely tolerate my kids and husband-trapped in a hotel room with them adjoined to my sister's room with their kids-is going to drive me crazy---yea for tranquilizer. I am kidding, I will just go downstairs and gamble to get free drinks.  Packing for vacation is a chore and getting ready to leave for vacation is a huge chore. We are totally cleaning the house, because we don't want to come back to a dirty house. Packing, I am never sure what to bring and what not to bring-so I always over pack. My over packing always leads to some type of drama in my house -do we really need to bring that?-what is that for?-why are you ironing that it will just get wrinkled in the suit case?-don't they have shampoo?-don't they have pillows?-  It seems everytime my husband and I have to go somewhere we always get into an argument. I don't know why. It is always about stupid stuff too. So I remind him, stay calm because we always argue before a trip. He doesn't, I react and we are off to a great start. I wonder what will happen tomorrow.   Soap Operas     Why do I watch them when I know they aggravate me? I started watching The Bold and The Beautiful years ago and quit watching it. Recently I started again, because my oldest daughter started watching it during her summer break. It totally pisses me off-I yell at the TV! What is wrong with these people and why doesn't that 17 yr old who is dating a 30 yr old close her mouth. I mean really close her mouth and lips together. She looks like a total mouth breather. Are her porcelain veneers too big for her to close her mouth? Her teeth are huge. That is grounds for malpractice in my book. She reminds me of a skeleton-you know how they look -all teeth and bones.  The dating issue-although they are not "doing it"- what the heck does a divorced older guy have in common with a high school student? Ick.  Can I just say, for anyone who watches this show-who died and made Ridge the God of the Show? Smug, arrogant, a-hole is what he is....my husband says that is because he is a good actor that he can make you believe that-I don't know, I would rather think that the actor is just a jerk-not really, but could you imagine someone like that? Actually, I have. Not a good time.  I think I need blood pressure meds everytime I watch that show. Maybe I should just quit watching....but I can't. It sucked me in and won't let me go.

        As I sit here waiting for my husband to come home from an 18 hour workday, I am confounded by my reasons to start a Blog.      Who cares what a 40 year old housewife with two daughters has to say? Why do I want to give the world access to my thoughts? What is within in me that makes me want to put my thoughts out there for everyone?      I don't know, yet. Hopefully, the longer I post I will learn the answers and I am certain that some will not be very pretty. Although, I do know that one of my hopes for this Blog is that someone out there will recognize themselves in this and realize that they are not alone.        Things I like:        my husband    my daughters    my pets    my house    my computer    how the outside smells after a rain    the seasons    sleeping on cold sheets    books    plants and flowers    all types of art    perfume    animals    blue skies with fluffy clouds    learning new things    cooking    recipes from around the world    laughing     music    comedy    soap operas    off beat television comedies     That is not a full list of everything I like, but it is a start.     Now things I don't like:     impatient people    rudeness    crime shows    sold out concerts    long lines    no money in my bank account    phone calls while in the bathroom    people who talk on the phone while using the bathroom    dirty bathrooms    heat    PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome/disease)    prescription meds I have to take everyday    pain    body images    loud talkers    gaining weight    seeing people vomit      That is a start for now.    My plans for tomorrow-I have to go to the DMV to renew my driver's license-ugh-long lines, impatient people and rudeness.    Friday, a mini-vacation with our extended family. Only one word can describe this-SCARY.    Random observation of the day:    When sitting in the doctor's office today, I realized that I could touch and manipulate everything in there and no one would know. Like, I could take all the tongue depressors out of the jar, drop them on the floor and put them back. No one would really notice. I would not do that, but it would be funny to see in a comedy skit.
