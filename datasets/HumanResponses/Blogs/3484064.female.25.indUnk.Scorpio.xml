      Since this is officially my first blog I guess I have to make it good. But if I make it too good would it appear that Im really a bloggerwhore and just lying about being a virgin? Maybe I should just go ahead and suck at blogging first that way expectations wont be so high. Hmmmm decisions.... decisions..... decisions.

      It's been 10 days since my last Blog. As usual I dont know what I wanna ramble on and on and on about. But im sure Ill think of something. I always do.   Ok Im going to summarize with REAL examples for you all exactly what crazy men are out there lurking and preying on single women.  Exhibit A  (From a yahoo instant message)  aiming2please (11:00:28 AM): are you going to let me suck some toes  **What in TARNATION! I dont even know this man he probably has athletes foot in his mouth! lol **  He also sent the following message later on....  as you know I am back from Jersey!! Thank goodness. So when am I going to be able to suck your toes?!!!    UGGHHHHHH Get a Clue! And some of that medicated Cream for ya mouth!Nasty ole man   Ok this next one is from a 35 year old....  Exhibit B  whats up baby when i saw your page i was like dam baby girl to cute and your kids as well hit me back i want to get with you    What the hell kinda Garbaaaageee is that? Is that how they are picking up women now days? I musta been out the loop longer than I first thought. Cause man O Man  And thats only two of the crazies out there on the Loose. Not to mention the PHYSCO I told yall about before Crazy Mr. Miagee Ninja gone Loco. Are all the people left to pick from crazy,pyscho,illiterate,goldtoothed no job having busters, fat albert or jaba da hut twins, gay or confused sexually, married and lurking??? Im begining to wonder......Im starting to even think being single might not be so bad if it means not running into anymore of the above listed weirdo's.   well anyways enough on that because it makes my head hurt just to think about it.  So i finished painting my upper hallway and it looks GREAT. If i do say so myself. Saturday night I went to the Meat Market aka 20 Grand East Club. As I suspected I still Dispise clubs! At least it wasnt filled with knuckleheads driving a car with rims that cost 2X the amount of the car. Instead it was filled with old farts trying to stay youthful dancing to Juvenile-Slow Motion and Petey Pablo Freak-A-Leak?? Lawdy talk about comedy! Laughter is good for the soul. So you know right now my soul is in darn good shape.  Ok I think the Lord is tryin to tell me something. What do you think? I turned on the television to get my Sunday praise on and one of my favorite tv pastor Joel Osteen was preaching on Not having a Judgemental Attitude. I get my Daily Mana and this is what it says.....   You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge the other, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things. Now we know that God's judgment against those who do such things is based on truth. So when you, a mere man, pass judgment on them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God's judgment? Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, tolerance and patience, not realizing that God's kindness leads you toward repentance? Romans 2:1-4 NIV  things that make you say Hmmmmmm..........  Ok I think thats about all I have to say right now. Its getting late and I promised this nice young gentleman Id call him back if I was up. So I gotta keep my word so Mr. B you need to stop what your downloading and pick up your phone...... right........ about...... NOW...... oh yeah Happy Birthday!!   1

      Ok my kids are back in town after a 208 dollar speeding ticket curtesy of TN State Trooper! Thanks guys you made my day! Didnt you know it takes more than that to hold me down? Im soooo happy to have my children back home. Although I enjoyed my relaxation,free time and time alone I truly did miss them. Ive said it before and Ill say it again.... Children are the cause of insanity and the medicine to regain your sanity. Gotta Love them! Much love to my son who was bought his FIRST stick of deordorant by his aunt. He is soooo proud of that deordorant. lol Its like a milestone into manhood for him i guess?? And to my daughter who thought the word "amused" meant you didnt have children. Thanks for the laughs and keep um (& me) rollin!  And to all you messy folks out there...... God dont like UGLY or Messy so take a bath and stop being so darn messy!! Stop the madness. And obey the most important commandment..... LOVE ONE ANOTHER!!  1

      Without wood a fire goes out; without gossip a quarrel dies down. As charcoal to embers and as wood to fire, so is a quarrelsome man for kindling strife. The words of a gossip are like choice morsels; they go down to a man's inmost parts. Like a coating of glaze over earthenware are fervent lips with an evil heart. A malicious man disguises himself with his lips, but in his heart he harbors deceit. Though his speech is charming, do not believe him, for seven abominations fill his heart. His malice may be concealed by deception, but his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly. If a man digs a pit, he will fall into it; if a man rolls a stone, it will roll back on him. A lying tongue hates those it hurts, and a flattering mouth works ruin. Proverbs 26:20-28 NIV

      Ok my kids are gone so Im starting to get into the dating scene a little deeper than usual. Almost a little too deep i think. One guy is super crazy. I dont even know where to begin. He cant hold a conversation at all. When we talk it consists nothing more of me making cracks at him. And somehow he enjoys it. Annoyin as all get out. I told him I had somewhere to be last night and probably wouldnt be home til after 10pm. So why in sams hell did he call before 10 and leave a message. Then called back after 10. Which i did not answer the call since I still had some business (non sexual) to take care of.Leaves another voicemail. So then around 11 he calls yet again for a 3rd time. And when I didnt answer he calls my cell and leaves yet ANOTHER voicemail. Men!!! what in tarnation is wrong with you! He aint my man hardly ever know him so why is he hounding my phone all late at night leaving me messages,especially when I dont answer his call. Why why why! Its not like I gave him any what's the deal? Someone tell me pleaseeeeeeeeeeee!! Actually I dont think its all men that do that matter fact I know. But you gotta wonder for the ones that do do that if they are mental or something. Just call once and leave a message when i get back to you i get back to you. OK  Now as for this power tripping whench that was at the meeting yesterday.She needs to get off her high horse and take that corn cobb out her Anus! I could of swore my mother was in Iowa right now so why in the heck is she trying to scold me for some BS she knows nothing about like im her child. Then want to get mad because I get loud with her anal behind. If you want respect you give it first woman! You respect no one but yourself and seeing how you represent yourself im starting to doubt your self respect too. You take that position of yours a little too far. I dont care if your the president of the US you dont come at me all crazy and derranged power tripping about something you have no earthly clue about! You need to check your communications with your higher up and check your attitude at the door next time. It aint my fault your name is MUDD around these parts. I have plenty of people to back me can you say the same? ahahaha Seriously doubt it. Treat people how you want them to treat you is all Im saying ya old hag. And your idle threats you can shove up ya nose! I know my rights and I know the rules and regulations of the organization. Maybe you need to reread them yourself. It might help so you dont make a complete donkey of yourself.    **sigh**  Other than that folks im Kosher! lol Just sifting through my dating pool. Trying to find the most worthy man.   To be Continued...........

      Ok I guess now is as good a time as any to add to my blog. I guess in this entry I'll tell a little about myself. I'm 25 years old and a single mother of two.I was born and raised in Sioux City Iowa, where contrary to many beliefs and jokes there are more than 10 black folks. I had my son at an early age of 16. And my daughter when I was 19. I moved to Atlanta Ga in April of 96. (Year of the Olympics) In Oct. of 2001 I graduated from DeVry University with an Associate in Electronics & Computer Technology. I currently work for a Large Telephone Company in the Southeast, who at this point will remain nameless because they SUCK!! But needless to say they pay my mortgage so I cant complain or say too many bad things about them.    I love many things about Life. Mainly God,my family,friends & myself of course. My favorite color is purple then pink. I love volunteering and helping others when I can. I am a good listener and very good at giving advice and different point of views. Although I dont follow my own advice half the time since I tend to be hard headed and stubborn. In my spare time I mainly spend time with my children & family. Did I tell you already I love my kids?? Well I dont think I can ever say that enough. My children truely help keep my sanity. Ironic enough they are the cause of most of my insanity. lol   Right now I have waaayyy more time on my hands than usual. Which is why Im able to actually take the time and type a long Blog. My children are visiting family in Iowa for a couple weeks. I'm so used to being with them and doing things with them So now its like what to do.... what to do? Im pretty sure I'll find SOMETHING to do while they are gone. It might take me a min or two to think of something but im sure I will.   Its almost 10 am so I think its about time to head to the gym. Yes I love going to the gym. Although I dont have as much time or opportunity to go as i would like. I used to go on my lunch break but thanks to that nameless phone company that moved me from my old work location its not as feasible as it once was. So I try to fit it in when I can.   Til next time........ Toodles!  **Now a word from our sponsor**  The Road to success is not straight There’s a curve called failure, a loop called confusion, speed bumps called friends, red lights called enemies, caution lights called family; you will have flats called jobs. But,.....if you are a spare called determination, an engine called perseverance, and steering wheel called faith, A drive called JESUS; you will make it to a place called SUCCESS!!!!

       Alright maaannnn Its been 5011 days umpteen hours since my last Blog. lol My bad got Usher on the brain and how could you even help it they play one of his singles on the radio like every 10 min. So pretty much you turn&nbsp;one of the many&nbsp;radio stations in Atlanta any time of the day and youll be certain to hear one of his songs.&nbsp; Not hating on Usher he knows he is the man but c'mon let us hear someone elses songs too! Dont be a radio play hog. lol     &nbsp;  Anyways I've been getting alot of grief from folks about the whole Mr. B thing. So let me just clarify what EXACTLY happened with him and my previous blogs. Mr. B is a hater of the wholeeeee "Go with the flow" concept. Me on the other hand I live by it when it comes to dating and life and anything inbetween. (for the most part anyhow) Well after our first&nbsp;outing (not date)&nbsp;Mr. B kept asking and asking and asking about whether or not I liked him, what did I think about our lil meet and greet at D&B and my first impressions of him. Well Im not the kinda woman to sit there and just go on and on and tell you how I think you are right off the bat because I know how impressions of people can change quickly. Soooo since he kept hounding me almost every other hour about it (even though I just kept on tellin his butt to go with the flow and not worry about it) I decided why not add a lil snippet to my blog. (BIGGGG mistake I came to find out after the fact, oh well live and learn. ) So thats where all the blogs come from. Its not like I was gonna be mean or anything I mean I just met the guy no expectations of much really so what was I supposed to write about? lol (Apparently NOT what I put in the blog) Which I have to say was a slight exaggeration.&nbsp; He was clean cut as far as being groomed and whatnot so its only natural to compliment him on that. Right? (apparently wrong lol) Well hell I didnt know! Excuse Moi! Wont happen again! Especially since I dont have to deal with him anymore. He was toooooo needy and whinny. And all that crapola with him constantly asking me what did I think about him every single day. Mannn thats why I decided to just blog it thought itd make him shuddup and stop asking. (Wrong boy was I wrong alot this past month lol Seeee yall I do admit when Im wrong ) Then he made the horrible mistake of trying to lock a sister down so quickly hell I dont know you Mr. B it had only been a couple weeks and his butt was tryin to take me off the market and hide me away from the rest the world. I DONT THINK SOOOO BUDDY! Not ready for that just yet...... or coulda been the fact that I really didnt think he was my type and I didnt trust his butt either. lol I knew there was some things he was hiding from me just couldnt put my finger on it. And sure enough he was. Ole lyin buster.&nbsp; I may blog on it another day but this one is getting kinda long so imma move on to my next topic at hand. But before I do I just want to say BUMP ALL YALL that say Im toooo darn picky and quick to cut folks off! Cause had I not been listenin to yall and listened to my instinct I wouldnt have had to blog about Mr. Miagee or Mr. B and their royal screw ups! lol So from now on Im back to my usual Im not giving benefits of the doubt or credit&nbsp;to folks with no prior credit established FIRST!     &nbsp;  Went to a nice lil BBQ over the weekend. Good Job to my Brothers of XL Neal #588! Turned out to be real nice.&nbsp; Even though it was BLAZZZZZzzzin hot that day and a sister was sweaty and sticky. It was fun throwing those cups of water on my buddy Doug. Doug= the old little kid. lol After I purchased batteries from the Dollar Store I was able to have a REAL water gun fight. (who ever invented them is a Blessing! lol)&nbsp; Did a couple "run bys" on folks got almost everyone wet. Which I dont think anyone minded since it was sooooo Hot. I know it helped to cool me off a lil. Til ummmm **BLEEP** showed up that is. lol Anyways Carrollton's Annual  &nbsp;Breakfast. Such a sweety you are! (among some other things.....)     &nbsp;  Sooooo I finally painted my living room! YEAHHHHHHHhhhh Yeahhhh YEahhhhhhh opppp my bad that was some more Usher. lol Got a lil excited.&nbsp; It looks real good though. The color goes real well with my hallway I painted a month or so ago. Now all I have to do is get the dining room painted and the family room. Which I will attempt to start in a couple weeks. Translation: In about a month and half&nbsp; maybe longer lol    School will be starting in about 2 weeks. Which I am soooooo happy about but then on the other hand that means that its going to be hell getting to and from work again. As if 50min isnt long enough! Grrrrr oh well hopefully it wont be too much longer before I get to be transferred back to MY SIDE of town and wont have to worry about it. Pending Mr. Powell (2nd level manager) can talk Mr. Mann (2nd level manager of my old district) to plot to swap me with the trick that started the whole mess. lol Im prayin on it and yall need to pray on it for me too.   pretty pleaaaseeeee God..........    &nbsp;  I have a dinner date tonight with this guy I met quite some time ago. He seems sane (not like Mr. Miagee) and not needy or whinny (like Mr. B) and I have known him for almost a year now so hopefully it will go well. Thats ALL im saying on that. That way i dont get anymore heat from yall BUSTERS! lol But I will say he is very attractive and nice. (as far as Ive seen)    &nbsp;   Ok now I MUST say this as a warning to ALL parents    If your child wants to be dropped off at the mall cool! BUT make sure you dont leave them there all damn night! like its a club or something. I mean if you see about 200 kids standing outside why would you drop your child off after 9pm? Cmon we all know what time the Malls close and lemme tell you they are NOT tryin to see any movies now days. Them fast A@@ kids are up in the movie theater having SEX! Nasty butts. Teach ya child and keep on them thats so nasty! In the back of the movie theater not even making out anymore geesh they skip that totally and go head on for straight fu$#ing! And the movie theater aint sayin jack or doing jack. Dont ask why but when I get through with the Owner of the one in StoneCrest Mall I bet they will be doing SOMETHING! Dont make me call the darn News Channels on ya butts Mr. StoneCrest Mall ! Ugghhhh Im sorry im just sooooo disgusted with that. Whats the world coming too? We all goin to hell! oppp correction they are cause I KNOW I aint.    Hush yo mouth! lol    &nbsp;  Anyways I woke up early today so I decided to go head and do a lil blogging before getting ready for work. And now its about that time to get going so i can my mortgage and whatnot.&nbsp;    Blog with ya later world!   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   1Luv1Architect

       First thing FIRST.   U LYIN MANIPULATIVE SKEEZER! I got something for you though Chickeepoo Just you wait and see. You failed to realize you playin with fire Mrs. Scarecrow! Debate and Rebuttals is my specialty! You arent ready for me but you aint hear me though.........    &nbsp;  I SAIDDDDD YOUR NOT READY FOR ME!    &nbsp;  okkkkkkk now that I got that out of the way. Now I got a question or rather some thoughts and I need yalls input on it. If you go on a date with someone a couple times and yall hanging out do guys automatically think your an exclusive item? How can you tell if he thinks that or not? I guess i could always ask but how do you bring up the subject and at the same time let him no that your not tryin to get into an exclusive relationship with anyone at that point in time with out hurtin his feelins or ego. Ive never been any good with that. I only know how to be blunt and to the point no sugar when it comes to&nbsp;that kinda stuff.   He's a nice guy and all but im not sure if he is really my type or if i even want to date anyone for that matter. I dont want to lead him or anyone else on so ummmm whats the best way to put it? S.O.S    S.O.S.    S.O.S.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone??    &nbsp;  &nbsp;   30319 ........&nbsp;30319.......... Calling all Duped men! lol   Yeahhhh thats right Im Bloggin about you!&nbsp; I heard you like it when the ladies take you for a ride..... and i dont mean the kind you give in the bedroom. Ahahahaha    To my newly aquainted buddy representing the 30319    You think you know old man BUT   YOU HAVE NOOOOOOOOoooooooo IDEA Douglas! Yup thats right I said it Douglassss Douglassss Douglasss ! lol I only protect the innocent and you PLAYA arent innocent. hehehe   Oh and guess what everyone Douglas picks his nose and flicks it when he thinks no one is looking. Uhhh hmmmm ladies he sure does. Mannn I hope you flick it on yourself one day and it dries up and cuts your nasty butt.     &nbsp;  Nawwww let me stop playin. Douglas is cool for a lazy duped man who wont paint his house like he needs too and a jive time turkey with a weight bench for a end table/dining table. Yeahhh I guess your alright.&nbsp;lol    But I just gotta say............ &nbsp;ahhhhh you got DUPED! She DUPED YOU MAN! lol ok thats not nice Imma stop    But between me and you    **whispering** I think he thinks he's a Ninja like Mr. Miagee. Either that or he is in love with him since he cant STOP talkin about Mr. Miagee and Ninja stuff. Leave Mr. Miagee outta it aight Turkey! Cause I may have psycho ninja miagee but    SHE DUPED YOU!   hehehehe oh yeah I said I would stop. My bad.    WOW   But she really really duped you man .............. hoodwinked.............. bamboozled even! lol    ok thats it im not saying no more on it tonight........ I promise............ pinky swear!   Jive Time Turkey    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Anywayssssss   I got my co-worker hooked on Blackplanet.com. She now checks for notes every day while at work. Anticipating what kind she got that day. All geeked out when she reads ummm lol ReRe Happy Birthday Girl!    Me I like looking at the pics on their and thinking "what were THEY thinking???" half the time I dont think they were thinking at all. lol cause man O man..... I think im gonna start to post some of their pics in my blogs just so yall can see what I have to sift through while on chat scene. Its scary sometimes.    Kids are home for the weekend. Just mine! Wooooooo Hoooooooo! I missed them. Was supposed to be girls night just me and my daughter. My son was "supposed" to be spending the night at his friends house. But he was only tryin to pull a fast one. Knowing he couldnt stay the night if the parents werent home he said theyd be home then when the dad left for work at around 11pm he calls me sayin he is ready to come home! What in tarnation did you wait til that late boy.&nbsp; lol But he knew if he stayed and there wasnt a parent there and i found out hed get his butt kicked. Ahhhh gotta love my son atleast he had enough brains to call home. Even if it was 11 o'clock at night.    My daughter is in love with yahoo messengers new audibles. She got a lil click happy earlier tonight. Aint that right Douglas? I think she clicked just about everyone they had. Although her favorite one was the flight attendant saying Buhhh Bye.... Buhh Bye now. I dont know why she likes that one the best guess cause she is silly like that.    It looks like its gonna be a nice weekend. Good thing cause I have some yard work that needs to be done. **hint hint**     &nbsp;  Gotta get school supplies for the kids since school will be starting in a couple weeks. They are all excited about going to get supplies...... dont ask why I have no earthly Idea. lol They just are.     &nbsp;  hmmmmm ok thats about it for now. I dont think I really have anything to say. Just wanted to blog on something to fill my page some more. Make it appear like I actually have something to say.    Hope it worked.    Til the next Blog. Toodles &amp; Goodnight!    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  1Luv1God    &nbsp;

Mr. B what was you thinking wearing what you wore?? Cmon now... thats all im gonna say on that subject since we already discussed it.  White chicks was a pretty funny movie.

Thursday night I went and picked up my two children plus my two nephews and my niece. So right now im house is FULLA kids. Good thing I have a big back yard to send them out to play in. Its been good having them here though. Ive missed all of them. I was laughing at my son yesterday because he wanted to check his email. Well he really doesnt get any email except spam but he gets one from the Bank about his savings account. Why did he try to reply to the message ? lol this is what he wrote:  I  got  your   message .  When  do  i get  my  stuf  like  my  sister . Email  when  you  know ok. I'll  be  here  for 3  days.your member Teshaun   I DIED laughing you hear me! lol ahahahah I thought that was soooo cute and funny at the same time.

      Alright Im going to back track just wee bit...  Thursday I took my children and nieces and nephews to see Garfield. Now if any of you havnt seen it and are thinking about seeing it.   DONT  It was cornier than a hooker's feet with too tight high heels on. Yeah sure the kids enjoyed it not sure exactly why but they did. But it really sucked and thats coming from someone who will watch just about anything.   Now back to my outing with Mr. B.....   ***ALL OF THE FOLLOWING YOU ARE ABOUT TO READ IS CONFIDENTIAL AND SHOULD NOT BE DISCLOSED TO ANYONE!***  Mr. B is a nice young man I met at Perimeter Mall (thats my story and Im sticking to it!) We were supposed to see the movie White Chicks. But since we didnt get there in time it was already sold out. Soooo we decided to go to Dave & Busters. For those of you who dont know what that is basically an adult Chuckee Cheese. Minus the cheap pizza. Anywhooo so we went there; played a bunch of games. Kicked his butt on a few of them even though he swore up and down he was gonna win. lol Go #7 Yeahhhhhh And I think he was tryin to show out with the virtual boxing game he played but between you and me.... he had me from the first time he smiled. Love a man with nice teeth and a smile to go with it.  I can honestly say I look forward to the next time we get together. Considering my luck with men these past couple months I was totally relieved and had a great time with Mr. B. And Thanks to a $25 dollar Barber shop visit earlier (thank U Mr. Barber) that day the brotha was clean shaven and hair all lined up. Lookin Good Mr. B..... Lookin G-O-O-D!   ;-)   Now if I had to Grade this man based on all our conversations up to today and our time spent together last night Id have give him a B  and say he is very datable. Now had he opened the door to D&B for me when we left and walked me to my vehicle instead of going to his first then driving me over one aisle of cars he would have been an A+!  (aaahheemm **mental note for YOU Mr. B**)  Dont worry Im not going to hold it against you. THIS TIME!  Overall he does appear to be alot more sane than all the others I still have my psycho meter on JUST IN CASE!   **END OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION***   Now as for today it was boring. ZzzZZZZZZZzzZzZZzzZZZzzzzzz Sat at work..... did a little work.....Sat at work some more..... played Minesweeper...... talked on the phone to this loser guy. Who had the nerveeeeee to ask me whether I was a spitter or swallower!!!   Can you say PERVERTED LLLLLLLLLLLLLooooooosserrrrr! C'mon men whats wrong with yall rejects! You dont ask someone you barely know if they spit or swallow! ugghhhh AS IF it matters since youll never know for sure.....   GET A CLUE and then some lotion because your gonna need it with those kinda strategies. lol  I think I'll pray for him......     1

      Ok after looking over my Blogs I noticed I neglected to update you on Mr. Miagee/Psycho boy! The Next day he calls me at work ohhhhhhh about 9 am. Immediately I tell him ....... "yeahhh I seen you called about 090343 million times and I got all of your messages. Just so you know I was busy taking care of some business and all that calling and leaving messages wasnt necessary."  You know what that lil pyscho said.... Ohhh so now I called 5039 million times huh. I thought I only called  ( i cut him off and say ...) "ummmm you called about 5 times leaving 3 messages all within an hour time span. Something aint right about that. You think thats normal? " He replies that he is sorry. Wont happen again now he knows blah blah blah   So anyhow I crack some more jokes on the pyscho and  then tell him I have work to do ill talk to him later. He calls me later that afternoon at work again. My co worker answers and she knows i instructed her to screen my calls. lol So she tells me its Mr. Miagee Ninja pyscho boy and we are arguing about if im going to pick up finally after a minute she picks up to tell him im busy (like i had told him earlier) only to find out he had hung up already.   Well to no surprise when I get home I have a Voicemail from the lil Almondhell Nut talking about he knows im dodging his calls and thats not cool. He thought I wasnt like that but he now sees my true colors blah blah blah (hearing the violin)  So you figure that will be the last I hear from him right??  WRONGGGGGG!!!!!! He calls again the night..... I dont answer I let the voicemail pick up. When I listen to the voicemail its clear by his tone that he is mighty vex. lol And he just starts to holler and curse in the phone calling me a BIAAaaaa (yall know the rest) saying i aint Sh## and this and that.  lol like WTH was that???? What was the point in all that? He just proved my point of how psychotic he was to begin with. I hope he has it out of his system.   I think Im gonna pray for him...... in the mean time someone Call 1-800-CHARTER on his crazy butt!   Women may be crazy but men are confused and PSYCHOOOOOOOO!!!!!    1
