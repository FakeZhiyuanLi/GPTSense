      I finished school on Tuesday, and it's me birthday tomorrow!! Kya! I'm so happy. I can't wait to see what my dad has planned for me, and what I'm getting. I'm really excited, I'll be turning sixteen. My brother played a birthday song he wrote for me tonight, it was really nice of him. He's a great guitarist and songwriter, by the way, I can tell he's gonna be a great and famous musician someday. Not much else to write about, except to let you all know that Miranda is getting her restricted driver's license tomorrow! Congratulations, Miranda! I'm still talking with God about leaving early for my dragon hunting journey, though I'm not sure if I told you guys about that. As is, I'll just prepare, get stronger, and live for the Lord as much as I can. Signing off...  ~Pabo

      I don't know...I think I may be leaving for my dragon hunting adventure very soon. A little bit after my birthday. I'm really not sure, though. It seems God has been kind of telling me that the time is coming soon. As I said though, I'm not sure...but, nontheless, I'm REALLY EXCITED!!! ^_^ If I do leave soon, then I hope I'm strong enough. Yeah, I think I will be. Anyway, on a sadder note...keep Miranda's grandmother in your prayers, everybody, she had a heart attack.   And speaking of Miranda, check out her blog, she's almost got her restricted driver's license (I think that's what it's called...)! Well, The Shinobi Games are coming up...I have my weapon selected, too! Captain Kuro's claws, from One Piece. Meter long double-edged blades on each finger on both hands! Pretty lethal. Don't worry, they're just cardboard with wood basing. We're not gonna kill anybody. Oh, yeah, and on the note of One Piece...I saw episodes 1 and 2 today!!! Woo!! Yeah, my friend finally got the program necessary to download them, and they freakin' RULE. Well...that's about it. Remember, pray for Miranda!  ~Pabo

      Finally, I finished my last assignments for my online courses!! All I have left to do is write the English exam and finish up my drama course at school. Then I am FREE!!! (angelic chorus strikes up on D#) For anybody who doesn't know for some reason, the person who commented just a little while ago is Miranda, the coolest person in the world. She is very likely coming with me on my journey! ^_^ Anyway, I got an idea for a game to organize outside with some friends of mine. It's called..."The Shinobi Games"!! It's gonna be like a big ninja tournament held around this huge area, where teams and individuals act as ninjas and compete with other teams and players, relying on their stealth, martial arts skills, and weaponry. But, it's not confirmed yet; I still have yet to actually talk to any of them about it. Well, that's about it, I'll keep you posted on the progress. Later!  ~Pabo

      Nothin' much today. Just excitement brewing within my soul for the dawn of summer vacation!!!!! Woot! I'm almost free for a good two months, and then I'll be able to...do stuff. Without being told to do it. So that means it'll be fun, no matter what. I have youth group tonight at my church, I believe, and then I have some Jackie Chan movies to watch. That should be fun. So, until next time, this is a person, telling you to be another person!!  ~Pabo

      A little one day break there. Yesterday I went to kickboxing and I read through my new Shonen Jump (especially the One Piece chapters) about a gazillion times. Kickboxing was fun, but it's not too much different from the karate classes. We just didn't do any of the traditional stances or anything...which meant no kiba dachi (horse stance)!! Woo!! I hope to be very strong someday, so that it will aid me in my dragon hunting. Anyway, I've been finishing up a lot of school lately, and the family has been having lots of barbecue. I think we're having some tonight, too...anyway, I'm gonna try to get a new layout for this page soon, and I'll keep you posted on progress. Signing off...  ~Pabo  EDIT: It's gonna be my birthday soon! ^_^ On June 18 I turn 16, and reach a new step (whatever that is...).

      That's how the Japanese start a game of Go. It literally means "I beg of you", but can also be a form of vague imploring or, like here, a way to "ask" the person to initiate the game, or see if they are ready! At least I think it is...anyway, I'm using it here as a greeting, even though I should probably be saying "konnichiwa". This is the first post on DHW, and...yeah. That's about it. I'm doing school right now, and there's a thunderstorm coming...nothing much else. I'll be going to karate tonight and getting the new Shonen Jump, so that'll be fun! Nothing else as of now. Ciao.  ~Pabo

       Whatever  that  means. I think it has to do with that motion being like home, which you miss sometimes...ah, forget it. At any rate, the planning for my dragon hunting adventure is coming along great. My dad gave me a sort of reality check on everything going on, and it got pretty emotional for me...but now I'm even more confident and taking on what I need to with all I've got! I even marked down a whole bunch of dinosaur locations on the big map, with reference sheets and commentary. Happy birthday to my mom, who turned 32, I believe...sometime this July...I've never been good with numbers. And happy birthday to my good friend Richard Kelly, an accomplished drummer and person all around, whose birthday was just last Saturday. My family and I are going to the zoo this coming Monday or Tuesday (Monday, I believe...) to revive some old memories. Hopefully it's as I remember it. Anybody else who reads this, pray for Miranda's mother, hoping that she finds work in their new home. And, Miranda, if you're reading this, do you know anything about sailing or navigating? 'Cause I sure don't. Anyway, that's about it. I'll be posting again soon, hopefully.    ~Pabo    P.S. I haven't posted in a while because our internet was down for about a freakin' week. So it goes...

      Sorry about not writing in a while. Been very busy. Okay, here's the scoop...I turned 16, got my pilot's goggles, went to Niagara-on-the-Lake, met the love of my life (a hat that is perfect for me, the kind of hat I have been searching for all my life that is perfect for me), went to Sarnia and London, walked around with my friend Nicole, and watched lots of movies...Sgt. Bilko is hilarious. I think that's it. I saw Spider-Man 2 as well, which was freakin' amazing. I've been studying for my dragon hunting a lot more, studying mainly about desert survival. One of my "friends" has been acting like a jerk lately, so I don't think I'm gonna hang around him anymore. Anyway, that's it. Ciao! We all like our Mushroom Kingdom!  ~Pabo (WAS that forty words?...keh, so it goes)
