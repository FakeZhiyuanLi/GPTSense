      The most hilarious movie I have seen this year.. a comedy movie with absolutely no trace of slapstick. (When was the last time Hollywood came up with a pure comedy?) The catch: the movie is in French, the subtitles can capture only so much of the essence of the dialogues.  It revolves around a tiny fishing village in Quebec, where the only job for men is to go and collect weekly welfare checks. A completely dull and dreary existence. Their lives takes a new turn when they come to know that a small industry is considering their village for a plant. That means employment for all the youth. But there is only one thing they lack: they need to find a permanent residing doctor for the village. They send out 'brochures' on their village to all doctors in Montreal. One urbane doctor bites and decides to check out the village to escape a traffic offense (didnt really understand that part). He loves cricket, and the villagers have no clue what 'cricket' is. With the help of internet and&nbsp; a Lagaan-type song, they end up creating costumes, a make-shift 'stadium' and bats from oars. Now the doctor comes to visit and he is shocked to see men clad in cricket costumes at a distance. He insists he wants to watch the match. Poor villagers have no clue how the game is played. Suddenly a wise man comes up with a brilliant idea and he starts jumping up and down saying he won the match. Everybody follows. The poor doctor is shocked that both sides seem to have won but leaves the game anyways, bedazzled.  Such hilarious sequences fill the movie. The game of seduction for a young doctor, by a whole village. The film sure deserves the box office success it enjoyed in Canada (the second highest-grosser of all time).  &nbsp;

      My childhood gang consisted of the three of us - Santhi (my cousin and a year older to me), Unni (my bestest friend and my age, studying in the village school) and of course Me. I was the most creatively mischeivous of the gang, but Unni and Me formed a deadly duo. Santhi was always tense and mostly a damper in our plans.   Santhi and me used to share a very closed relationship being in the city, and being surrounded by relatives all the time. I still remember our enthusiastic reaction when we first saw Aamir Khan's picture in some glossy magazine. And how we used to lech at a handsome hunk in the family, who would visit from Hong Kong. And how we would climb the walls of all the neighbours houses in search of 'Portuguese mangoes' and some weird medicinal herbs with which we would create concoctions and feed the pet dogs.   Unni and Me shared a really long, intense comraderie. We would meet when I go to the village, maybe once a month, and when she would visit me in town, during every school vacation. We had absolutely no secrets from each other. We would do long treks on the paddy fields, across the streams, and over hilltops.. I would go attend her class in the village school because I would not want to be away from her during the day. She would make  ola paambu, oonjal,  etc for me and her mother would make me the most delicious pickles and delicacies. She barely knew English, but still would sit and listen to me while I read the Britannica aloud to her.   When she visits me in town, my creativity forgets bounds. The amount of torture my neighbours have suffered under our antics.. sighh.. Stones, drums, Michael Jackson's music, jackfruits, all have been weapons of torture in our hands. Even Mohanlal, at that time young and new in movies, has suffered our pranks. It was interesting how our 'games' changed as we started growing.. through adolescence.. teenages.. and unfortunately when we kind of grew mature (still an oxymoron in my case) we lost touch with each other.   I met both Santhi and Unni last week. Santhi got married, divorced, did her graduation and MBA, remarried and is the mother of a 5-month old baby. Unni did a degree in Economics, Education, joined as a teacher in her school, got married, and is the mother of a 10-month old baby.   &nbsp;

      Kerala is apparently a state with a terrific quality of life index. Wonder how they measured it :-) Obviously they havent seen the TV news lately.  An engineering student commits suicide. Apparently an educational loan was refused by a branch of the IOB. Utter chaos. Left activists have so far burned at least 50 govt vehicles, pelted secretariat and all buildings in its vicinity, conducted innumerous protest marches, and of course demanded the resignation of the ministry. How can the govt be responsible for a student committing murder citing financial reasons? Especially since her entire college fees, mess fees and book fees were funded by them via scholarship. The activists forget to mention that she applied for the educational loan to meet her hostel fees, while she stuck to the working womens hostel instead of a cheaper students hostel. They also forget to mention that she hasnt been to class for close to 11 months. Kerala is a state which has traditionally been proud at its low educational expenses, high index of education and for providing opportunities for the neediest of the needy. It is hard to imagine that this suicide is an indication of a suddenly changing social climate, for the worse.  Well, at least the ruling parties should take some cues from the Opposition on how to blow up issues out of nothing and bring down a ministry in the process.

      There is a guy, Anil, who is quite famous in our family for his funniest escapades. Dont know why comedy seems to haunt him.  This is the latest such incident in his life. (He claims it is real - I have my apprehensions) So he has gone to Ernakulam and is staying at a local Yatri Nivas - on the ground floor.&nbsp; He is the disciple of Kumbhakarna in that it is virtually impossible to wake him up once he has decided to sleep. So here he is, in deep slumber, when he is miraculously woken up by some noises that seemed to be coming from his dream/nightmare. BAM BHAM BOOM WHOOM. CRRRRAASHHHH. He starts to wonder what kind of realistic nightmare is this.. He jumps up from his bed shocked and wondering what the hell. There it is - in front of his eyes, a flashing brightly-lit sign that says 'Ernakulam - Kozhikode'. What the hell. And then as his hearing registers, he hears the screaming of a 100 people all at once.   Yes, it is a fast passenger  bus  inside his room, just touching the other side of his&nbsp; bed, and passengers screaming and running around in his room. Fun of his life.  &nbsp;

      There was a screening of a brand new Mallu movie 'A Snowy Girl' in the Kinfra video park, and my parents, as usual,&nbsp; dont miss any movie screening, and I as usual accompany my parents wherever they go.&nbsp; Okay, I ended up watching this movie. Actually it was not bad at all. It has one of the finest English songs/music in any Indian movie I have seen.  Let us cut to the incident. This movie was shot in an apartment right above ours in Cochin. It is a relatively new apartment, and although we have furnished it we have never actually stayed there. We have left the keys with the building management there.  So while the movie progresses, mom tells me all about the building and the apartment and I rave about the view from the building and so on.. Suddenly she has a shocked expression on her face. Apparently the furniture in the movie has been flicked from our apartment downstairs! Brand new furniture used in a movie shooting without our consent!! Mom got thoroughly psyched. She got out of the movie hall, called up the building ppl and immediately started shouting at them for being so irresponsible. I wonder if they thought we would never come to know of this.. afterall the proof is in a movie!! The irony is the theme of the movie: 'Hiding trivial things leads into immense trouble'.  &nbsp;

      Back home finally. The house has been drastically re-modeled, my room even more drastically so. Not sure whether to feel sad or happy about it, hence cant find the appropriate smiley..   I used to have a beautiful airy, well-lit bedroom with my life's collections tucked away in one corner of the house. It no longer exists. The walls have been opened up and connected to a new master bedroom created on the far end of the house (on the second floor with just pillars to support it). So the new connector room (my ex-bedroom) has been converted into an&nbsp;'entertainment room' according to my parents. &nbsp;  The only thing that earned the room its new name is a new 53" plasma TV which sits on one side of the room. It is addictively sexy. What is even sexier is a seated hammock in the middle of the room where you can watch the TV from. Plus my old music system has been replaced with a surround sound sub woofer 10000w pmpo system. I have no issues in spending all my time in this new room :-)&nbsp; Just that I have to go and sleep in a claustrophobic bedroom in the&nbsp; middle of everywhere :-(&nbsp; Since the master bedroom is so tucked away I can do anything in the rest of the house and listen to music at full blast :-)&nbsp; But then I have to run to pick up telephone calls every few minutes :-(  All in all, I love the new room that has been carved out. I just have to get used to living with the wonderful memories I have of it.

      Today was filled with boring meetings and discussions at work.  The zilla Panchayat President was in office talking over the arrangements he had made for a programme of ours.  Now this man impressed me a lot - he has the uncanny ability to doze off in mid-sentence in an important meeting.  If this is not talent, then what is?  In one of his rare moments of wakefulness he gave a gem: Us: 'You should publicise this more. Your members dont even know about this programme.' Him: 'Not only do they NOT know about the programme, they actually spread bad words about the programme.'
