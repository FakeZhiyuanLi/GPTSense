      The Broken Wings  Kahlil Gibran   You know when I was a kid; my mother paid me five dollars for a book report. I used to bank! So I guess I never got over wanting to share my thoughts on a book with others. Mom won’t pay me for it anymore, but that doesn’t mean I can’t let others know what I’m reading, what I thought and what the story was about. This Blogger is where I’m going to do that.   At first I wanted to have a page directly on my site, but I realized how difficult it would be to update it every time I read a book. I would have gone lazy, the page never would have been updated and people would start to think I only read one book a year. The Blogger is going to work much like my Live Journal. I can update it whenever and I don’t have to work with HTML. Rockin’ good news.   What book was it that incited me to start this Blogger in the first place you ask? That book would be The Broken Wings by Kahlil Gibran. If any of you receive e-mail from me you know that I use a Gibran quote as a signature on my composed emails. “Faith is knowledge within the heart, beyond the reach of proof.”   He was an amazing man and a gifted author. My mother (as you might be able to tell by now, my mother is the inspiration for my literary mind.) used to read Gibran to me. When I was younger some of it was a little above me, but now I can’t help read and re-read everything I can get my hands on by Gibran. As of late that hasn’t been much. I have a hardbound copy of quotes and short stories that I keep close by my work area. I can take a break and read a quote. There is a lesson to be learned in everything Gibran has ever written.   I had never seen nor heard of The Broken Wings, even though my mother has a copy (which is next to me right now). A friend, Dustin Hamlin, was recently shocked and (dare I say impressed) that I read Gibran. He insisted that I read The Broken Wings. The next time he was at my house he went through my mother’s books and found a copy for me. Dusty then took me outside and read the forward of the book to me.   You have to understand that my mother would read out loud to me, and I loved closing my eyes and listening. No man that I can remember has read to me. I’m sure my father read me bedtime stories, but nothing memorable. Maybe it has something to do with how much I adore Dustin, and how awesome it was to have him read to me something so beautiful. I think a lot of it had to do with the way every work Gibran has written is paint on canvas. You can see, feel, and touch everything. It’s solid and it when it touches you it never leaves you.   I hate crying, and Dustin warned me I would cry for The Broken Wings. He was right and I’m not sure if I should punch him for making me read a book that makes me cry or hug him for telling me about the book and making it a touch more personal and special to me.   You want me to go on about the story now? Of course you do. It’s about love, go figure. There is no fantasy happily ever after. The only happiness about the love story in this book is that it existed. It was never shown to the public eye. The two people in love never married or had children. Gibran grew old with the love in his heart, but with nothing to hold. The woman he was in love with had to marry another man. She didn’t run away with him, he didn’t have an afraid with him. She just loved him until she died and took his heart with her.   It’s hard trying to explain everything without telling you everything. The entire book is wonderful because of the way Gibran writes. I can’t stress that enough. If you’re like me, you’ll cry, because it’s messed up and sad and bad things shouldn’t happen to good people. Then you’ll wipe your tears away and sigh and think about how that’s the way things work. Bad things DO happen to good people, because they’re not into screwing someone else just to be happy.   Not me. I’m not a good person. I’ll fuck you if it means my happiness. Too bad. So sad. When it’s me or you, watch out. I’ve had enough. That’s all on a more personal note. Look to the LJ to figure out what I’m talking about.

       Llewellyn's Witches' Datebook 2003  (published by Llewellyn featuring several of their regular authors and guests)     Technically I haven't read all of this book, because it's a day calander. Honey Kehoe (my best friend since freshman year of high school) gave it to me for Christmas. I asked her not to get me anything, because I was unable to get any treats for my friends or family. She got me this small gift that ended up being one of my biggest favorites of the holiday.   "But Naomi! It's Llewellyn! Don't you boycott all things pre-dominantly wiccan and new age?"   Technically yes. Llewellyn is on my Anti-Wiccan shit list. Many of their authors make the Wiccan path sound even more bogus than usual, most books are trite, and some even try to instill a set path (making Wicca more RELIGION the way Christianity is formed, rather than FAITH in self and the world around us). I don't take too kindly to what some Llewellyn authors have had to say.   This book is a hodge podge of articles that don't bother me so much. From what I've read it's very researched. The articles are more about touching bases with subject and leaving it up to the reader. They're helpful articles on pagan holidays and types of herbs and what pains they can ease. There are also poems and many recipes that I can't wait to try. Even if it means I have to take a trip down to the Silver City Food Co-Op to get all the raw materials and organic stuff. Pollo Vino Bianco looks particularly yummy. I want to try it a few times to get the hang of the reciepe and then make a nice dinner for Honey.   Each day is marked by the moons quarter and sign. The calander also indicatees when the moon is void of course and the exact time that it transitions into it's next phase. Planetary retorgrades are noted. To top it all of, a recomended color of the day is calculated and recomended. That might not make much sence to some of you, but it makes Witchie expeditions a lot easier for me.   Some days have insperational ideas to try. Adding rosemary to bridal bouquets can ensure that the couple will remain faithful to one another. Bergomon essencial oil is a good antidote for depression. Information like that could be really handy to some.   Important historial events are listed as well. On April 25, 1989, USA Today reportes that Patricia Hutchins is the first military Wiccan granted religious leave for the sabbats. I don't like Wiccans much, but that's important to anyone who still struggles for the right to follow, pratice and enjoy their faith of choice. Some stuff they list is really fun. March 24 is the birthday of Alyson Hannigan, who plays Willow (the witch, I wish she would stop calling herself a Wiccan) on the show Buffy the Vapire Slayer. The day after that, March 25 in 1199 Innocent III issued the bull to establish the Inquisition. Not so INNOCENT after all, eh?   These kinds of books are fun. Llewellyn also does a Witche's Almanac that used to be really good. I was so unimpressed with 2000 and 2001 that I didn't try for 2002. Perhaps I'll pick up 2003 when the year is half over and I can get it on sale. Until then I have more than enough to keep me busy with this day calandar. Tons of fun. I can't thank Honey enough.

       Wounds by Jemiah Jefferson   I picked this book up at Wal-Mart forever ago. There was already a review here on Bookshelf for the Masses, however it was lost when I was working with the edit option. Damn.   Ok, the few people I know who have read this book disliked it. Marg, my online muse shaped friend, reveiwed it on her page. It was less that kind.   Yes, I liked it. Yes, there is a bit too much gratutious...oh HECK...I mean to say PORNOGRAPHIC sex. I have to defend myself in saying....I needed a smut fix! I no longer date a man who has Penthouse Variations laying around. I need my favortie fantasy creatures, vampires, to live out yet another outlet of fantasy for me. That would be sex.   Wounds is the second book in the series. Voice of the Blood would be the book I SHOULD have read frist, but I was unable to find it and I wasn't going to look. The main character spends a lot of time dwelling on what occured in that first book and doesn't do a very good job and actually EXPLAINING what happened. That can throw the reader way off. I'm sure if I knew what our main character was whining about and feeling guilty over, I would have been able to give some sympahty.  It didn't matter to me. I'd just scan those parts until I found it to be funny again. Or more sex. (You don't have to go but three pages in the book without running into one or the other)  The book has it's moments. FUNNY moments, and I'm all for the ha ha when it comes to vampires. You should see what I come up with when I'm writing with Marg. Hmm...perhaps I should start another blog from memorable posts and stories by Marg and me? Sorry, side tracked.... so what was so funny?   "Owie luaghter." For one. Imagine a vampire, who just got SMASHED by the girl he was stalking. His ribs are cracked, he's curled up in the back of a cab, and trying not to laugh at what the cabbie has to say. When he does he gets the "Owie laughter." A vampire that would actually SAY "Owie". Snicker.   Two. Daniel, the main character, is queer. Most vampire tend to lean to the pansy side as far as the way they dress. Not our Danno! He's a queen. A vestie. He likes to suck little boys. Finally, a vampire that will admit his sexuality. He uses a cell phone, does camp shows in a drag queen bar, has a studio full of art fags who only leech off of his money and wears glitter and blue eye shadow.   Three. Daniels so called girlfriend Sybil. She's not really funny so much as CRAZY. And he takes it. She does the worst things to him, his friends and innocent bystandards and he puts up with it. None of this, "I'm the vampire, you're the human obey me stuff." He just lets her do her thing, as dangerous as that ends up being. Once he "dies" for the morning, like vampires do while Sybil is with him. He wakes up for the evening with one less toe. She decided to play dissection with her undead boyfriend while he was unaware. HA! And does he protest? NO.   "Sorry about your toe. It's around here somewhere- can you maybe just stick it back on?"   "I have to grow a new one. Sorry. But thanks."   "You grow new ones? Like a Lizzard?"   "Sort of like."   "SWEET! Can I cut off your head?!"   "I'm fairly sure that kills the patient."   She's crazy. Muy loca.   Anyway, Jefferson doesn't have much else going for her as a writer other than the fact that her characters get funny from time to time and she can write explicit, nasty sex. Parts of the story drag on. I don't really care what Daniel did on Tuesday if everything he did was uneventful to the story.   Stratch that. Where WAS the story? It was funny. There were good moments, but the ending really had NOTHING to do with the story. It just sort of drops on you. There's not any development. Vauge clues only make sence until you're on the last page and saying "Ohhhhhhhhhh. Right."   That can be a good thing. In the case of this book, it wasn't. Anyone who is serious about what they want to take away from reading a book wouldn't bother finishing this. People who need a monthly does of vampire nasty will be just fine.   If you have not noticed... I fall in the second department.

       I Swear to GOD, I'm going to get SOMETHING Done today.    Now that I have discovered the BEAUTY of the ten most recently updated Bloggers on the Blogger home page, I am unable to do little else but surf through other pages wishing mine were as nice, or laughing because as sad as mine are they are better than some. So I've torn myself away from the updated Bloggers in favor of doing a little updating of my own.  I wish I could be famous. All the dreams come true, the cash, the glamor... and I could start my own book club. Like Oprah's book of the month... only cooler with darker books. Oprah had a habit of reading the saddies. Emotional woman, has to be strong. The world is against her and she stuggles by. Somtimes overcoming. Sometimes barely gettting out. The tight squeeze of escape. The gritting teeth of betrayal. The stinging tears of love ruined by circumstance. The tangled ties of what daddy did to his little girl. Against the odds in that slow it'll take three chapters to find out what happens next kind of way.  I have read a few Oprah book of the Month books, by the way. I enjoyed the few that I did. I can not support her love for Tony Morrison. She redeemed herself with "Home Is where the Heart is" by I have no idea (and Natalie Portman is in the movie version. She's adorable in the movie.) and "Fall on your Knees" by so and so. I'll have to re-read them soon and post them here.  Ah, now how to get started. I haven't updated since October and there are quite a few books I've read. Just a warning, I've been reading some Self Help books, so you'll get a sneak peak at what you're not missing. I've also been keeping up with my regluar vampire smut addiction. I can't help it.  If you forgive me in advance I'll be ever so greatful.  And now on with the show.

      You little son of a bitch!   Prev posts have been lost due to a hyper active mouse setting on the Cyber Lounge computer.   I know I haven't kept this very updated. I have six or more books to report on. But today is computer day, after a very long and busy week. I want nothing more than to relax and play on the computer, update my sites and talk to Marg (who I miss!)   This is going to get started again. I promise.

       I KNOW  I can't tell if you really love me the way you say you do.   I never knew when you hated me the way that I hated you.   I know that I did love you.  You say you love me now.   But if this is so... Then I might still hate you just that much more.

       Our Love  Our love wilted away.  I struggled for it.  Sacrifice after sacrifice.  You tried for it.  Effort after effort.  In the end, I was too selfish,  And you too lazy.   Our love wilted away.  It vanished years ago.  I was too afraid to tell you.  You were too afraid to remind me.  So we stayed together.  Ignorant, and hurting.   Our love went away.  I never want it to come back to the way it was.    This I wrote a few weeks after breaking up with Sean. That was last month.      Stage (ode to the worst friend)   If the entire world is a stage, baby,     Then every one is acting.  Including you. (You know I hate you)  If the entire world is a play, honey,     Then every word is fake. Especially yours. (See right through yours)   The angel can give you his wings, but you can't fly away.  It's just not going to be written that way.   The devil can give you his crown, but you can't lie as well.  And the audience still wonders why you fell.  The entire world is a stage.      Then the spotlight is the sun.  It’s not always on you. Never was.   You’re not pure or safe.  You’re not good or kind.  You’re not anything.  You’re not anything I desire.   If this world was a stage, darling… I would burn it away before you became a star.    I would kill the world,    Before you got to far.   You’re not anything deserving.    For a friend that has broken my heart.      Your Name (For Aydyn Coatl Eli'czar Lazerus AKA Ace)   Smoke mirror is broken.  Tourist attraction temples.  Obsidian shattered.  Feathers plucked.   Coatl, my little brother, the fifth sun was shot out of the sky.  Love this land of flesh; we will never see Tlillan-Tlapallan.   I am leather clad.  I hold scorpion whip.  To strike the men,  that tainted my blood,  and made me pale and vulnerable.    Coatl, my little brother, I have named you.  Strike when you can, my little serpent.   Coatl never let them pronounce your name wrong.    This is a poem I wrote for my little brother. My mother, my step father, my sister and I all chose a name for him. Coatl is the name I gave him. I think he might hate me for it later, but it is a strong name that means something.      Air Born  This may be my last chance to get to be free.  How ironic. It is also my way I can be something so not like me.   Caged and commanded.  I could be rich and demanded.    While I was in Dallas I thought on joining the Air Force. Obviously I didn't do it. This poem was my thoughts on joining.      Prophecy  before the end after the end  the new century around the bend the anarchy and flames the death stench the life stench the filled with bodies trench the anti-christ, leader of the fallen the faith crushed the pope blushed at certain advances satanism trend rushed the explosions the war live in luxury  the cockroaches whore the innocent buried in debris not many left to cry for thee the maggots move in hollowed eyes lake of blood where the pulse dies the joke of god i nod the stomach turns with all the smoke throats blister burn devaluation of nutrition canned food, ruined meat  wasted dust collects at dead mans feet   2/17/97. Mr. Tudor asked something of us. I don't remember the assignment, but I remember being in a bad mood. Add those together and see above.      Valentine  Vandal of my heart, you are A candle left below my hand to burn me.  Lend me a kind word as a whisper.  End my day dreams, for a day (a year).  Name me yours.  Tame this hopeless passion to love.  Ice down my blistered hand.  Nice to see you care for the damage you've caused.  End my pain, or put an end to me.    2/14/97. Mr. Tudor again. He wanted a valentine poem. I didn't have a boyfriend. That class was great (hell).      Slave  Tangled tumbleweeds toss by her.  They dance.  Dead weeds dance at her blistered feet.  When her lords forced her pride to abort,  She fell to desert dry feelings of defeat.  She dreams of sabotaging her cruel lords.  Her pale small mouth ejaculates wild screams.  She made only smile in her sleep.  She sees blood in her dreams.  Their blood on her hands.  Running down her arms.  Pooling at her feet.  She dreams of the day she will look to heaven and rejoice.  When her enemies are dead,  as dead as they killed her soul. And then she will dance green life into her own.    Mr. T's class again.      Side Show Slavery  There is no sanity for humanity.  No sanctuary for the sins we carry.  This society is the perfect profanity.  This time Mama can't wash out our mouths with soap.  Our lives are the knives Thrown at the girl tied to a spinning wheel.  The chain is unbreakable.  Consider us lost.  Shackles hold wrists tight.  Sometimes we gnaw our arms off.  The few fallen bodies Lay rotting in artificial light.    Generally, I was unhappy and weird in that class.      (no title)   Angels laugh or angels cry,     Over little white Christmas lies.  Angels damn or angels save.     It's their decision at your grave.    That's an old one that I used to sing song to when I was bored. Really bored.      I, Almost dead, Spider Web  Never in my short life,  Have I ever seen That, which is so twisted,  Than Me, a twisted weave.  In my designs, a spiders art,  A child sees, and screams A sweet and innocent butterfly,  Falls to my creators ravenous schemes.  I envy that child.  Children have dreams.  I envy the child's life span.  The child can do more than I can.    Again, Mr. T's class. We were supposed to write about something that dind't have a personality. Then we had to read the poem, and try to get the class to figure out what we were talking about. It was weird.     Fake you for me  I'll take you on.  Love you like soda.  Fizzled out flavor.  You're getting flat.  It's routine. It was confusing,  But I've got it now.  We're fake for the sake of us.    Um...I was with a guy, he was with me, and we didn't like each other.      (no title)   When we were together I could write no poetry for you.  No that we're over,  It's a poets dream come true.    Ugh. Break ups are great.      Ryan  Regret does grasp my stone heart.  You looked at me today.  "Always together, never apart."  Now my hearts firmness fades.    There used to be more to this poem. Originally it spelled out Ryan Lucas Morris. I can not for the life of me find the rest. This was off the top of my head. God, I hope he doesn't read this and find out I lost the other half of his poem.     Catastrophe  Case of darkness is rising.  Another faithless age.  Terror silent, but not surprising.  Always with violent quick rage.  Sights of gore broadcasted daily.  Trials of crimes thought outdated.  Revenge takes so many innocent lives.  Oppression is greater than designed.  Patronizing doom perches over us.  Helpless hells lurch on the horizon.  Endless destinies are coming down to one.    Another class assignment. You would think Mr. T would have stopped asking me to do my work on my bad days.      G.D.B  Gashed my heart and took a fall.  Ashes. Ashes. My emotions were tall.  Venus wasn't in the right place for us.  I had the same questions about your trust.  Now, I'll never know.   Deaf I was to your wants.  And blind to any of your plots.  Love for you and me.  Ending your so called misery.   But, alas my lad, you could never wait.  Unlike many other, never got to participate.  Rather, you took others to your bliss.  I hate you for that, loving my sis.  So unsorry it ended this way.    Wow. I had forgotten all about that one.

       Graduation  Just when you think, It's time to lie down and die under enemy hands, People are as shallow as a last breath, You've driven a bulldozer through a glass house, Your love have been kidnapped by the government, Your poetry has written you a "dear John" letter, The last angel has fallen, You're mortal; and  The Boogie Man is real, You realize you are wrong.  You break away, look at them differently, hit reverse, finally get his letter, write and epic poem, grow wings, Find a fountain, and turn the light on all at the same time. You dance.   This poem was written my senior year. I went to a private school with only seven graduating seniors. We all did our own invitations. This was what was printed on my invitation. Below it I wrote something about inviting all my friends and family to witness me onstage receiving a paper certificate to represent four years of schooling. I thought it was funny. Most people thought it was sarcastic. Sean Rees was not present for my graduation, and a friend (Forest Raven) had to give me my graduation roses.      Celestial Break Through  I scream over and out,  To Celestial bodies (suns, moons and stars) A comet too. Your obsession to hold the future destroys. My after shock in the palm of your hand, Is you power. A storm of crushes  Can change the harmony of life. You want your way? There's a heart burst. My life's pulpy remains, below your boot. You laugh with your eyes. I laugh too. I am immortal in your head. I am the temple you burned. I was the Sun Goddess. You turned my immortality, With one kiss, On my burning lips. It felt so soothing....at the time. That was my fire going out. I was young then. You robbed me of my pain, But I had to hurt to get here. I thank you. I hate you. I curse you. ...But…I would kiss you again.   This poem was done my sophomore year when I was in creative writing with Mr. Tudor. We had to cut out so many words from magazines. Then we had to use one word for each line of a poem. I don’t recall what words I had cut out, but this was the end result.      Ca Va?  A poem dead on paper. A song with a forgettable tune. It's how you make me feel. My stability you've ruined. I feel so dumb and numb. I feel obsessive and sneaky. I feel like a secret, That everybody knew. I feel dirty and alone, Like the foxy little drudge, That the overseer pretends with. I was cold on that pile of hay. You make me feel like smoke. You blow smoke away. I could be what you want. I could be real.  How do you feel? I didn't think so.   This poem was about a man who said he liked me, but wouldn’t look at me when his friends were watching.      Medea  I'm your Medea. Your she-devil, cultist and daughter of power. So, hero, you want a princess? She's so sugar coated, psuedo lovely. All you want is an angel, To opposite your pain. I could be your anything. It would give me that much more power over you. You want your harem of variety.  The princess, the secret, the skeleton. No, I won't be your secret. I won't be what your princess was, To your past future wife. I won't be that pain in her eyes. I will, however, be that pain in yours. You like it because you asked for it. You want to love her, So I can burn in a Hell that can never touch me.   For Jaysin, who tried to convince me betraying my best friend was a good idea. He went ahead and pretended like he won the argument. Water under the bridge.      Return to Sender (You've been disowned)  Dear Daddy, You have no idea, I realize sadly, You have no idea who I am. I'm a sourpuss and growing bitter, Like a lemon and bakers chocolate shake. Disappointment drowns the sparkle In my personality. It kills the possibility Of prosperity. Darker, sadistic sins (new hobbies) Let heaven refuse me in (I'll wait in the purgatory lobby). I hope someone can buy me out. I'm an angel and a doll, Only fallen and lost. I love to lurk in laughing night, In dark clothes that are skintight. My rainbow brite wardrobe is gone. replaced by shadows clinging to my body of longing. The body boys dream about (And if I find out... It could be a dream come true). Daddy, I lose. I never win anymore. I just lay sleepily on any floor. No "hail Mary" or "father forgive". I'm not very sorry, daddy. This is how I live. Love Always, Your Naomi Ruth P.S....how have you been?   Another sophomore creative writing assignment. Mr. Tudor was very impressed with the “imagery”. My father has never read this poem.      Lilith  As a daughter of Lilith, I'll have my revenge. Sons of Eve you fall too fast,  For a girl who is your devil. I'll be perfectly angelic,  Until I have your trust. Then I'll have you in claws clutched  Around you so tightly, You call for your mommy. That homely, obedient bitch. She's the reason I was a surprise. SUPRISE! Your Eden is gone. I'm your paradise now. You little parasite, I'm your hell.   I wrote this a little after I moved to El Paso in 1999. There was a guy at work who crushed after me, but was surprised when I acted like myself rather than his idea of a girl.      Heartbreakers  Oh you heartbreakers! You use my heartstrings like a swing set.  Oh you Swingers! You cool cats with cocktails. You cocks, jerks, assholes. Mr. Jerk Off. Sir Jerk her around. Terrible tyrants. Your kind should be extinct. I'll hunt you. I need a new danger. I'll go on a safari.  Predators. In the tall grass of your lies, you surround me. I won't be hunted anymore. I shout the battle cries of a tormented result, Of you heartbreakers. I am what you have built.  Huntress. Spitfire. I spit on your fire. Hellcat. Pussycat. Jezebel. Rebel. Mademoiselle. Your hell. Goil with the boots, tiniest skirt, 36C. Man playing. Lovely Lady. Darling Devil. Beautiful Baby. Oh you heartachers!   El Paso. 1999. Around July. One of my favorites.      One Out of Three  Paper says no.  Rock says no. I'm not calling you. Scissors cut you. I want to cut you to pieces. You, repti-human sub-species.  Saint patty can't save you now. Snake, you age on his day. Detour to your future. Possibly fameless. Without me, flameless, And you don't care   About Dustin Hamlin. Written in the summer of 1999.      Best Color  Red like her dress. Red like her heart.  She sees red like a mess, Of blood coming in waves. He thinks he's the ocean.   Don’t ask. I must have been angry and violent.      Regular Picasso  One clock says life is an hour ahead.  The other an hour back. I'm stuck in the time between, Trying to figure out what my love lacks. I had a wine I liked. But I swigged it for a Shiraz. I lost the savor of the first, For the seconds popular black. The Sweet-tarts come in threes. And I'll tear each package open. I only eat the pinks. Who knew candy could get so deep.   Written after having a conversation with my friend Aaron Swatzel. This was when Sean came back form the Army and I became depressed about his lack of interest in our future.      Cold Coffee and Stale Cigarettes  It's always the October air. So much has happened in it. It's that shimmery cool creation of This crazy planet spinning and Persephone going down to Hell. At least she's warm year around. I sit with my breath freezing And my toes cracking because Demeter is a jealous mother. This is the place. October. This is where everything begins. At the Café du Coin I sit waiting, With my cold coffee and stale cigarettes. I'm waiting for something October-ish To begin.   I wrote this in the fall of 1999. I had just moved back to Silver City. The Corner Café had been a hang out for years. I was there at the time, thinking back on what had gone on there. I met a lot of people. Made and lost friends. At the time I felt alone, and wanted something to happen.      Cult  I want to dress in a poetic    White dress and a pair of clunky hi-heels. Then I want to wander the streets,     Under a full moon. It's going to snow. I'll cry myself lacy. I'll be a pure and individual thing. Unique and floating like my sister snowflakes. Dancing through the air and falling down. I want to hug my cold sisters     And make the nightglow. I'll be part of that crunching under feet sound. The kind of noise that makes a smile. I want the sun to melt me away.   2000. It was winter time and snowing in Silver City.      Ruined for me  She doesn't come to me as softly as she should. She's angry and loud and vicious. I have tried to control and calm her. Her anger is drowning what we are. I could stop loving her if she pushes us like this. I say the things I wish I wouldn't regret when she is in control. It looks so good, the things I say for her. It looks so terribly harsh and evil. It's so empowering. Dominatingly revengeful. When she gets like this it makes me tired. It makes me feel like I've wasted time. Her words push me like I have never known. The feverish chemistry throws us into each other. She's the most painful lover I will ever have. The best part is…. As long as I hurt She will never leave.   I don’t know when this was written. I was upset about writers block.      Sun Shock  It did it to me again. This hellish sun cooked me off, Like water in a forgotten kettle. So now I'm steaming and whistling. I thought I could do it this time And not run away. This gate to hell is disguised As a city. The pass to follow over the top, Will lead you to the sun. I am not the perfect Cookie cutter shape  For this town.   El Paso. The second time I moved there. I don’t even know when that was. I’ve done so much moving around.      Man Eater  Run away little boi. She'll get you. She'll catch you if she sees you. She'll eat you if she catches you. Run away little man. She eats men like popcorn. She'll toss you and catch you. She'll run her rough tongue over your butter flavor. Run away old man. She's worse than the brujas. She's crazier than the crying ones. She's angrier than a Bloody Mary. She has you little boi.  She loves the chase.  Heartbeat hungry, she loves the taste of your sugar. She's caught you little man.  She eats you like she loves it. There are plenty more where you came from. She's enslaved you old man. She's cast her spell. Making you regret it. Better than a virgin.    For Q. Who said I eat men like popcorn. He said he’d never fall for it. Then he kissed me. One of the most eventful kisses of my life. Not because I had won, but because I really liked him.      Razor Blade Comets  It's falling…. Falling……. Falling……. All to little pieces of shimmery sights.  It's turning into comets that kill. The tails are as sharp as razor blades. (the rust kind,. Used and trusted. Traditions faithful.) Boys and girls are licking all that left over sparkle away. The sparkle goes straight To make eyes glassy and bug out. The children bounce. It snows from a little envelope of secrets. And the children inhale so very deeply. Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Secrets drip, like bitter water down their throats. It mingles with the taste of the blood they swallowed From the tiny knicks on their tongues.   For Kathy Convery and the days I was so amped on Crank that everything was funny.

       (no title yet)   My mother told me to look for you.  And she warned me to look away from you As soon as I found you.   I saw you.  In your elegance.  I found you.  In your pain.  I met you,  Under the worst conditions.   My best friend told me to look for you.  And she told me to run from you as soon as our paths crossed.   I felt you.  In your element.  I kissed you.  In your night.  I gave in to you,  Under the worst conditions.   My heart told me to look for you.  It told me to never let go.  You are twisted fate.  You're my pleasant demise.  You're all I never wanted.   I fell for you.  In your eyes.  I hurt for you.  In your arms.  I love you.  Under the worst conditions.

      A Love Letter - I am writing this letter to share my feelings with you.  (This is some format I was told to follow. It comes from a book I'm reading for my sessions. I thought it was pretty hokey, but after writing the actual letter I felt a lot better. Very productive and all that. Oh…another note. I was listening to music while I was writing this. In the () after a section is the song that I was listening too.)   1. For Anger I don't like it... that I am angry with you. You have done nothing to deserve my anger or hate, yet I am struggling with the misplaced feelings. I don't like that I am unable to work that out on my own. It makes me very angry with myself, which can only make things harder. Unless I can keep in mind that it is misplaced anger. (“Crawlout” byDeathBoy)  I feel frustrated... that I am unable to keep the above thought in mind at all times. It is a difficult thing to do all the time. I am frustrated that I have driven you away. I am frustrated to know that I have not been myself for a very long time. I am frustrated that it will take another long time to be myself again. I am frustrated when I know that you smile at other people and not at me. (“Leather” by Tori Amos)  I am angry that... I have caused you pain. I am angry that I did this to us. I am angry that it came to this. I am angry that I can't run to you. I am angry about the endless list of my anger. I am angry that I can't remember how to stop being mad all the time.  I feel annoyed... with myself. I feel annoyed with you for saying "We'll see.", because I think you know. Then I get annoyed because I don't want to know that you know, because maybe you mean to say "No." and then I have nothing to hold on to. I am annoyed that I am being clingy. I am annoyed that I don't know your heart or mind when it comes to me. I am annoyed that as soon as I am ready to make things right, make myself better and be good to you it feels and looks like I am far too late. (“Should I Stay or Should I Go” By The Clash)  I want... to be able to let go of my anger instead of holding it against you when it's not always your fault. I want for you to be able to tell me when I'm being angry, and talk to me about why I am angry. I think if that were to happen I would realize a lot sooner that my anger is in the wrong place. I want for us to do that to make things between us better and so I can learn to be healthier with my thoughts.   2. For Sadness I feel disappointed... that we have grown so far apart. I am disappointed that there are things both of us could have done to prevent this. I am disappointed that six years of us might come down to the rest of our lives being you and me.  I am sad that... I hurt you. It was never my intention to hurt someone I love. I am sad that I feel like you won't look at me. I am sad too often. I cry too much. There is always a corner of my heart that is sad from the loss of you. (“Red paper Bag” By Sarah Fimm)  I feel hurt... that I am jealous. I am hurt because I feel quickly replaced. I am hurt that people tell me that I was never good for you. I am hurt that I let myself believe them when I am having a bad day. I feel hurt when people tell me that there are other fish in the sea, because you're the only one I want and the only one I need. I am hurt that I made the wrong decision. I am hurt that I didn't trust you enough to tell you the truth from the start. I am hurt that I put myself in this position by not speaking up every time I was in pain and waiting until it was too unbearable. I am hurting because I have hurt you. And I am also hurt that you don't seem to be bothered at all when I know better. I know you hurt too, but it is too easy for me to be angry with you again. (“Valentines” by DeathBoy)  I wanted... everything for us. I should have wanted everything that was possible instead of everything that I ever wanted when I wanted it. (“#1 Crush” by Garbage)  I want... time to wait for the good things we have to offer each other. I want to overcome this sadness and bring happiness back into my life. I want to be the person that makes you smile again. I want to be the one that holds you when you are sad instead of the one making you sad. I still want too much, but these are all things I can do now. I want to stop making you wait for me to get over this. (“You can’t always get what you want” by The Rolling Stones)   3. For Fear I feel worried... I have lost you forever.   I am afraid... of living my life knowing I lost the greatest man on earth. I am afraid that even if you are lost to my heart as my lover that we will never recover enough to be friends. I am afraid we will never be able to be happy for each other again. I am afraid to be happy for you if it means you are happy without me. (“Fear of Dying” by Jack off Jill) I feel scared... that I will never be better. I am scared you will never be proud of me again. I am scared that I will never hold you in my arms again. I am scared that you will never sing to me again. I am scared of never being able to make this up to you. I am so scared. I'm scared for having to live my life in so much fear. I am scared that I won't make it.  I do not want... to loose you. I do not want to loose you. I do not want to miss this lifetime. I do not want you to be angry with me forever. I do not want to hurt you ever again.  I need... to be not afraid. I need to face up to the monsters under my bed. I need to not be afraid of he monster I see when I look in the mirror. I need to be beautiful again. I need someone to watch me and be proud of me and refuse to hold my hand through my fear. I need to understand that I have to let go of you before I can even have a chance of ever getting you to love me again.  I want.... to stop being afraid. I want to be brave for myself. I want to be strong. I want to be admired for the strength that I have built. I want for you to not be afraid of me. (“Crushing” by Tapping the Vein)   4. For Regret I feel embarrassed... that I rely on you. I am embarrassed that I throw myself at you. I am embarrassed when you look at me.  I am sorry... that I ruined things. I am sorry that I didn't let you know when you were ruining things too. I am sorry that I hurt us. I am sorry that I hurt you. I am sorry that I tried to kill myself. I am sorry that I took a bullet from your gun to remind me. I am sorry that I tried to die after I killed what we had. I am sorry that I can't apologize enough. I am sorry that I apologize too much. I am sorry I was not honest. I am sorry that this happened. I am sorry that I learned so much too late. I am so sorry. (“Sorry I Am” by Ani DiFranco)  I feel ashamed... that I ran from you. I am ashamed that I was a coward. I feel ashamed that I was so reckless. I am ashamed that I didn't listen to you. I am ashamed that I ruined your birthday. I am ashamed that I do not always think before I leap. I am ashamed that I didn't touch you as often as I should have. I am ashamed that I threw things in your face. I am ashamed that I blamed things on you. I am ashamed that I held a grudge. I am ashamed that I would sometimes lie when I said you were forgiven. (“Happy” by Nocturne)  I don't want... to be like that anymore.  I want... to make things up to you. I want to make things better. I want to work on this. I want to never do this again, or at the very least I want to know how to stop myself before it gets out of hand.   5. For Love I love... you and all the things you are. I love what we had. I love the way you make me feel. I love the way you would smile at me from across the room. I love the way you make me feel when you make me feel good. I love the way you always tried to help me. I love the way you knew when I needed a hug or a pint of ice cream. I love the way you knew which tampons to get me and without asking you would buy me Midol too. I love the way we ate dinner on the couch and watched a movie. I loved the way we were a family in bed, you, me and four silly kitties. I love the way you gave me so many chances. I love cleaning your room for you to throw your clothes on the floor and smirk at me when I chew you out for it. I love the way you always tried to throw my clothes on the floor right next to yours. I love the way you took care of me. I love the way you let me take care of you. I love when you let me go off in my own world and tell stories. I love the way you thought I was good at everything I did. I love your warmth. I love your voice. I love your hair. I love you, Grumblebunnie. I love that I was your Snugglebunnie. I love the way you would let me channel surf radio stations when we were in the car. I love the way you would laugh at me when I was silly. I love the way you pick me up after I trip all the time. I can't tell you enough about all the things that I love. I love the way you let me cry. I love the way you always burn eggs when you cook them. I love knowing you’re home by the sound of your car coming down the street. I love believing in you. I love how you always believed in me. I love the way you tell me what's good for me. And even though watching you leave is sad, it's lots of fun to see...because I love the way you look in your jeans. (“You’re just too Good to be True” by Lauren Hill)  I want... for us to be able to talk. I want for us to be able to tell the truth. I want to be together again. I want to be myself again. (“1000 miles” by Vanessa Carlton)  I understand... that being together may not be possible. I understand that I might have to get over you for good. I understand that it might be better for you to never be with me again. I understand that I love you enough to go through loosing you forever if that is what you want. I understand that I make things harder than it should be. I understand that I hurt you. I understand that you are angry. I understand that we have lifetimes to be together, and this time it wasn't meant to be. I understand I might have to wait. I understand that this pain I feel can fade. I understand many of the things I did wrong. (“Angel” by Sarah M)  I forgive... you. I forgive you for not being ready for our baby in 1999. I really do. The baby wasn't meant to be then if this is us now. I forgive you for not knowing what was going on, because I didn't tell you. I forgive you for never doing the dishes because you always did the kitty litter. I forgive you for hurting me all the times you didn't know you were hurting me, because you didn't know you were hurting me. I forgive you for not understanding the reasons why I couldn't touch you, because I had told you long ago you were forgiven for those things and I lied. I forgive you for all the things I held against you for no reason at all other than I was cruel and wrong. (“Damaged” by Plumb)  I appreciate... all the love you gave me. I appreciate six years. I appreciate you, even though I haven't shown it in a very long time.  I thank you for... your love. Thank you for saying "We'll see." and thinking about it. Thank you for not kicking me when I'm down. I am so thankful that I had the chance to be with you at all. Thank you for loving me. Thank you for letting me love you. Thank you for giving me so many chances. Thank you for your kisses and your hugs. Thank you for every smile, every word, every tear, every night, every day, every extra press of the snooze button, every meal, every good laugh, every argument, every gift, every surprise, every vote of confidence, every cat, every letter, every song, every praise, every...everything. Thank you for everything. Thank you for giving me love. Thank you for teaching me what love is. Thank you for my dreams. Thank you for my inspiration. Thank you for the experience. Thank you for being alive. Thank you for a love that will never leave me. Thank you for giving me all you had to offer and promising more. Thank you for being you.  I know... that I love you. I know that we can work things out if we can sacrifice the time and sacrifice a little more of ourselves to a little more pain. I know that we can overcome anything. I know it might be too late. I know that I would do anything. I know that we deserve another chance. I know that this is not over, because you will always be my best friend. I know that even that will take time. I know that I can give all the time that is mine to making things better. I know that I love you always and nothing will ever change that, no matter how hard it tries. I know that you are afraid of what I'll do next. I know that I can show you there's nothing to be afraid of. I know that I love you, Sean Rees. I know that you love me too. I know what love is because of you, and I know that it is not something that can be destroyed forever. I know I love you, Sean Rees. I know I will love you forever.    As I said, Love forever and always, though and for everything.   Naomi   P.S. This is the response I would like from you. This is the part of the letter where I am supposed to tell you what I want to hear. I don't want to tell you to tell me what I want to hear. I want to know what you feel and what you think. I want to know you again. Please tell me. You were always so good at writing these letters. I still have that one from earlier this year. Your words were not only honest but they made me feel like a queen. You made me feel like a queen.   Please write back. If it helps follow the way I did my letter. It really helped me break things down instead of getting distracted. There wasn't a point to be made, just feelings to be shared. “We'll see”’ for the better or worse, I think this is a good place to start.   Je T'aime. Te Amo.  I love you, Sean Rees, with ever inch that’s left of who I used to be and every dream of who I want to become.    This isnt really a poem, it's just a letter that came out a little to raw in emotins to be JUST a letter. So I'm posting it here. Because it's what I think, what I feel and if that isn't poetry...then I've been doing things wrong for a long time.

       Open to Me.    I want to cut you down to size.  Split open your yellow belly.  I want to stab you in the chest.  I find nothing inside.   I want to taste your flesh.  One last time.   Now you have just one thing to  Hide from me.   Your hate from me.   Hide your hate for me.  If you'll just love me  For the rest of my life,  I'll kill myself tomorrow.   Make yourself open to me.  Give me this one thing....  And I'll go away for the rest of our lives.      (I was in a bad mood. Love can be nasty. Makes you say nasty things.)

       Good Fortune   There are two young women at a table in a Chinese restaurant having lunch. It is common to see friends chat over lunch. These women are different. This is not just a lunch to break up the all too long Friday. For one girl it is already the Sunday of her days off. This is not a meeting to get away from all that is going on in their lives. There are no confessions of trouble. This lunch is a ritual. This ritual will be part of their lives, most likely, until they are old women. You can see it written all over the distance of one side of the table to the other. Like witches over a caldron, they work a spell across the table.   It would not seem so amazing if you did not know them. For decades, if not centuries, it has been common for friends to meet and dine. Chat and smile. This is nothing out of the ordinary for the waitress to serve food to two talkative women. There is nothing abnormal for the other guests as their thoughts are interrupted by the soft chuckling of one woman and the chesty laughter of the other. Only this one page of their friendship is being shown in the book of their bond.   There are chapters before this filled with anger and love. A novel of events that started out with a dramatic novelette of their meeting. There will be more written in the days to come, chapters that will only be between them and epics that others will envy. The friendship is a journey, a battle, a mystery, a documentary. It has the flavor of every genre.   The brunette with blonde highlights is calm. She is the white tadpole of perfection on this symbolic yin-yang. Her laughter is like sun dried sheets being whispered over your forehead. Clean and simple. Warm and fresh. She laughs often at her friend's jokes and at her own.   Her name is sweetness. Honey, who collects honey pots, even though she rarely uses the sticky mess of bees. Her attire is soft and professional. The muted gray of her slacks and sweater (even her socks), does not cloud the shiny brightness of her attitude. Her freckles are visible across her nose, even though she does not take in too much sun. Her forehead is stabbed by a small widows peek, which always falls to one side and can never be split. Her bottom lip is full, which makes her playful. Her top lip does not make a heart shape, which makes her look like she is always in a contemplative thought.   Years ago she had a thin dancers body. Now she is a woman who does not need to flaunt her skin. It's all there, under her gray outfit. And, never you mind, trying to undress her with your eyes. She'll know immediately and she will turn to you. With one glare she will let you know she is a lover to one, and a fighter to everyone else. As if they had a chance. She has been involved with a good man for many years. They are happy.   Honey is a student. She works at the University in-between classes and then goes home to make dinner for her boyfriend, who is also a student. They have towers of books around and on the dinner table. At one point she wanted to be a veterinarian. Now she takes art classes that she is much more passionate about.   Although she goes home and cooks dinner, she is not homely. Only a few months ago she took her kitchen sink apart to fix the garbage disposal. Her boyfriend was tucked away in his study, only coming out to watch her victoriously pull out the knot of potato peels from the pipes. Honey can take care of herself, and everything that needs to be taken care of.   The other woman has her hair colored black, to hide the mousy brown she despises. She is the dark half. Her laugh is like a predator. It purrs on you, rubs it's cheek against you and then bites. Dirty and complex. Sometimes cold and misplaced. She laughs often at herself.   Her name means pleasant. Naomi, who collects cigarette cases when she is promising to quit smoking again. Her outfit is flirtatious for her weekend. Dark blue jeans stretch over her legs and bottom, which she wishes was bigger. On her last birthday she was complaining it was too big. A flowing poets blouse would be innocent, except for the plunged V-neck that threatens the secrecy of her bra. Her glasses are crooked because her little brother had crawled off with them one afternoon. Her hair has recently been cut into a chin length China doll bob. One side refuses to tuck in properly. Her lips are full and heart shaped. Several times while chatting and eating she applies vanilla flavored lip-gloss like an addict not noticing they already have the band around their arm for another hit. Sometimes, when she is alone she practices her "come hither, my dear" pout in the mirror.   Years ago she had a lean and narrow body. Since then her hips have widened for several uncompleted pregnancies. Her tummy is soft because she can not bring herself to sit up straight anymore. She flaunts her skin, hoping it will drawn in more attention. At least draw in a man who will take care of her and let her have a child. Go ahead and undress her with your eyes, she's already undressing you if you've shown any interest at all. She had been involved with a good man for many years and ruined it by giving the "come hither" pout to his friends.   Naomi is a student, but she is not going to classes. Right now she is studying herself to figure out what is wrong. She's trying to discover the secret to happiness, but at the same time she takes few actions towards the untouchable realm. She's wanted to be many things. Hair stylist. Police Officer. Sociology teacher. Massage therapist. Naomi hopes to go to school someday. For herself, and so she can be more like her friend Honey. She is passionate...no... She is desperate for the pieces of her life to come together and resemble something. Anything.   She has a tower of a bookshelf, and comes home to cook dinner for herself. Naomi is not homely, but she would like to be. And she's afraid of tearing up kitchen sinks. A habit of hers is not knowing how to put something back together after she's taken it apart. Naomi will take care of herself, but if you would like to relieve her of the job she'll gladly give it to you.   There they are, chatting. Yin meet Yang. Sweet honey meets bitter coffee. Aftermath meet calm before the storm. Sinner meet Saint. These two are friends?   Undoubtedly. While Naomi calls a few others friends her best, she does not feel as much respect for them as she does for Honey. She also likes to think, that while Honey calls others best friends, she does not have as much fun with them as she does with her.   Soul meet your sister, is more like it.   They finish their meal and look at the tray with two fortune cookies. It always happens that they hate their own fortune. They anticipate the taste of cookies and the delight of mass-produced words of wisdom. Like children they decide what cookie goes to whom, hoping that this time the correct cookie goes to the right owner the first time.   "This one."   "Are you sure?"   "Yes."   "What if I want that one?"   "Do you want that one?"   "No. I'll take this one."   "All right."   They both reach for the designated cookie and crack it open, grinning. And then the grin fades. Naomi rolls her eyes and huffs. Honey's nose twitches. They look up at each other.   "I got yours." They sigh and hold out the fortune. Trade. And read again.   Ahhhh...that is MUCH better.   "Are you sure we're allowed to do this."   "We're best friends. We can do anything we want. It totally counts." Naomi explains as she tucks the fortune in her purse with the other ones she has traded with Honey. "You have firm convictions; stand strong behind them." is a fortune Honey already knew, and Naomi needs to know that more than her. Today’s fortune joins "Beautiful things await you.", Naomi can not recall what she gave Honey to have that fortune. She cannot figure out why Honey would give it up. Maybe it's love. There is also "Accept that nothing is pure and you'll never be disappointed in this worlds imperfections." a lesson that Honey learned years ago when Naomi betrayed her. The friendship has been tainted once, but forgiveness was given and thanks will be given back every day that Naomi gets to call Honey friend.   After lunch, Honey drops Naomi off at her apartment. Naomi doesn't know how to drive. Honey would stop and visit longer, she's very encouraging of Naomi being out on her own and likes the way the house is starting to reflect that it is her friends home. The first time she's had a home to call her own. Yet, a visit is not in order, because Honey has to deliver lunch to her boyfriend who is at work.   "See you next week." Naomi shouts from her door.   "Thanks for the tea!" Honey says regarding the bag of Vanilla Hazelnut tea that Naomi insisted she try.   Naomi wants to thank Honey for friendship, but instead she walks into her house and looks around with a small smile. Honey already knows.     Ok, so it isn't poetry. I've just had too much to say lately for poetry. I went to lunch with Honey today, and I said I was going to write a story about our cookies. This isn't really about our cookies. It's about us, which is where the cookie story starts. Anyway... hope you enjoy.

       Thread   This is the tread that killed her. You can see where it cut her. At her wrists are the slivers of split flesh. Spiraling around her heart is the dark black and purple bruises of how tight it bonds became the more she struggled. Struggle was all she knew, and up until the moment she had never understood how much it would hurt her.   This is the thread that killed her. It is thin, and precious. The man who spun this thread is the only man she loved. He spun it out of his pain, and out of his love for her. He made it because he did not want to let her go, but he could not hold her. She was a terrible thing. Her words were poison. Her flesh was fire. Her anger was untamable. Her voice was loud, but her thoughts were timid.   This is the thread that killed her. It is thin and breakable. She never wanted to get away. Her struggling was not on her body. Her limbs did not twist. Her back did not bend. Her muscles did not move. It was with every thought that betrayed her. The thread, like a serpentine alien read her mind, and each time she begged, each time she smiled, each time a tear slipped down her cheek the thread tightened.  This is the thread that killed her. It is very long. It bound her intricately. The man was happy. The bondage was an art on her. She was a canvas of what he could do and of what she couldn’t. Knots so small that even you cannot see were made with this thread. This shining savior thread kept her away, and kept him from her.   This is the thread that killed her. She never saw it until it was too late to cut the bonds. Her teeth couldn’t reach. When she tried to use a knife she would only manage to cut herself. Her nails were bitten and small from her nervousness. She was like an animal in a trap. There was the understanding that she trapped. She knew what held her, but she could not get away.   This is the thread that killed her. Before she died she thanked the man that spun the thread. She said that she wanted to be buried with all the knots on her body. She asked that the wounds not be closed or hidden. She wanted the entire world to see his art, and her efforts.   This is the thread that killed her and it never would have hurt her if she had just stopped reaching for him. Like the Mona Lisa, you cannot tell if he is smiling or frowning. He may be happy that she is dead. He may mourn her passing. She will not know.   This is the thread that killed her and she loved it like a father, condemning and consoling.   This is the thread that killed her and she loved it like a mother, nurturing and stifling.   This is the thread that killed her and she loved it like a sister, bonding and bearing teeth.   This is the thread that killed her and she loved it like a brother, protecting and preventing.   This is the thread that killed her and she loved it like she loved him.   This is the thread that killed her and it name of this threat is called love.   This is the threat that killed her and she never stood up for it. She only asked for more.   This is the meal of starvation. Held away from love. Held by love.   This is the fast that killed her.   This is the thread that killed her faster.   This is the killer that made her.   What was she? She was sad, and happy. She was rapid, but slow to be honest. She was scared but brave enough to venture where she should not go. She was a woman.   Barely.   What is she now? Dead.   And this is the thread that killed her.     I wrote this today, after Sean left. He knows everything. With the exception of what to do. He's keen like that. Hardly.

       About Kittens   She was sad.  All she wanted was a kitten.  So she named one.  And loved him.   She would whisper.  "You're irreplaceable.  Irresistable.  Kitten Venable. You're just so edible."   Then he went away.  And she hated him.   So her ex-fiance went out,  got her a REAL kitten.   She was a lot happier after that.    Damn you, Nathan, where are you!?!

       The DJ's Girl   He's had his Lillia. The size zero Lilith in his life.  She's already gone from his bed,  but stuck in his head.   He has his Eve.  Tiny girl who he gave life.  A daughter to adore.  He couldn't ask for more.   So I must have been too much for him. Or maybe not enough.  Naomi the nameless.  I hold the heart he does not want.  He dreams of me faceless. I have the body he likes to taunt.   Naomi the fuck.  Third time no charm.  Naomi out of luck.  My love alarmed.   He says I need to be whole, before I fall in love.  My mistake in thinking he was what I was missing.

       This Terrible.... Love     What are you supposed to do when you are this in love?  I ask myself this, time and again, every since I met her. Every time  I see her (which is painful) . Every time I touch her (which is never  enough). Every time I think of her (which is every day). The every  every-ness of how I feel for her is a hole I can't escape, and I  wouldn't try. At the bottom of this well is something special, I can  tell. Like Alice, I can do nothing but keep falling, wondering if it  will end. Unlike Alice, this is pain not curiosity.   Nothing is curious about her. There are days I understand her to the  fullest, and those are the days my heart breaks. There are days I  wish I knew more, and those are the days I hate myself for not  knowing. There are days the satire of my love for her is painfully  obvious, and I don't understand why I can live like this.   And the second after my mind thinks that, I come back to why she  makes me soar. I am that in love with her. Indescribable. I could  try, but no one would understand.   There is a vortex of irony folding in on itself and creating more.  Ever moving, changing, shifting. I don't know where I am. I don't  want to know where I am as long as I am close to her. If she is far I  can't live, I can't smile, I can't. I won't. I will not. NO.  Pain and smiles. The thorn on the rose. The smell of rain when it is  sunny. Margaritas and a good mix. Coffee and cigarettes. A kiss with  a mean comment. A hug and tears. A torn down theater with the cobwebs  of drama. This is purity at it's worst.   Her tears are daggers. Her words are arrows. Her laugh is Ambrosia.  Her everything is my everything and no one sees why.   She hurts me more than loves me. Ignores me more than hates me.  Forgets me more than I remember her. There is no way to make her love  me as much as I love her. I cry for it. I pine for it. I want nothing  else, if only I can have her feel this way and understand me.   She looks at me, when I am taken by her. She does not understand the  darkness in my eyes. She does not understand it does not have to be  like this. She cannot grasp what she does to me.  And then...I think she does. I dread the thought of her knowing. If  she knows, then she continues only to keep this pain in me. She does  it to keep me. Why can't she see that I can be had in another way? I  want her. I'm not supposed to be like this. She was never meant to be  mine, but I wish for it.   She looks for things that cannot be. She wants the things more  impossible than what I want. It must be so scary. I want to take that  away. I want to show her. I want to be something to her. To be that  thing that makes her say, "It could be better like this."   But I am nothing. I am the last thought, the worn step on the ladder,  which she forgets. I am the boost that isn't needed, but relied on  for no apparent reason. She makes me feel worthless. If I were  anything... And what is sick is that I will remain restlessly  satisfied with being worthless.   Taken advantage of by your dreams. Manipulated by your salvation.  Black mailed by the creature you worship. And she doesn't mean to.  She can't mean to. Maybe she doesn't know. Please say she doesn't  know. My heart can't be broken any more than it already has.   Shatters like a glass under a hammer.   And I keep her from cutting herself. She doesn't even know I'm  broken. Everyone looks at me, like there is something wrong. I stay,  I live, I deal with it. I bitch and I moan. I scream and I say I hate  her. But they know I am going back for more.   I wait for her, knowing she will not come. I give to her, knowing she  will not be thankful. I love her, knowing she will not love me. I  hate her. I hate her. I hate her.   How can she not feel this? If I am this in love, why would the world  build us so apart? Why would fate keep her from this? Why does  destiny permit me to suffer alone? I don't' want to share my pain  with her. I want to end the pain by sharing her. I don't want her to  myself; I just want what is good.   Then they tell me I don't know what is good. If your heart hurts like  mine, if it is poisoned by love like mine, then you know the good. If  all you know if the darkness, you can define the light. It may never  be mine. Hurts so bad, hurts so good. Hurts and I come back for more. Evil. That is evil.   It's not her fault. Not her. Not her choice. I did this to myself. I  deserve this. I want this, because it is all of her that I have. It  could be better, it could be different, but this is what I have. I  will not loose this for nothing. I will not let this go. It is all I  have.   Why can't they see it? Can't they understand that I will fall apart  if I cannot hate her for not making me love her? I love her on my own  free will. It would be easier if it were because she is making me.  She never made me do a thing. I wish this were her fault.   I can't make up my mind. I hate her, love her. She will never be mine  and I'll always be hers. This is injustice at it's best. This is all  me, all for her.   So, again, what are you supposed to do when you are this in love?  Wait for the nothing. Look to the past. Live in the dream. Hurt. Cut  your heart from you, and throw it away. You cannot siphon this out,  once a love like this is tainted by your own delusions. There is no  way to purge this pain of blackness on your heart. Take it out! The  only way you'll be free. The only way left. Or you can wait for the  nothing. The never ending well. Keep on falling Alice. Keep on  screaming. This is not fun. This is terrifying. This is hell.  Cutting. Dark. Where am I? I do not care because I can close my eyes  and see her face. Falling.   Round and round. No resolution. The snake will eat itself until  nothing is left. Dizzy and sick of the taste. Swallow more, because  that's all you can do. Bitter. Bitter. So bitter you can make it  taste like anything in your memory. Today, it's bitter, but yesterday  you think it tasted like a cheesecake milk shake.  							 DO NOTHING! It will all pass away. She can't live forever. Neither  can you…at the rate you're falling. The heart will stop before you  tear it out.     This was written May 23rd, 2003. It’s about Nat, my best friend, best torture. Whatever she’s doing it, she does it well. That includes killing me. I pulled this out of a Yahoo Groups archive, because I thought it should be here instead.
