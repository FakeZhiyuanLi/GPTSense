       Today, The Blog would like to focus on one of two things that has been bothering it lately. The lack of support for out troops from Americans.     The Blog personally thinks that it is an insult to the memory of our brave men and women who have bravely and willingly died in service to constantly protest the war after it has started and blood has been shed. The time for protest is before the war before and the decision is made, but once it has been made we as Americans need to band together to support our troops.     The Blog also thinks it would be an insult to their memory to cease our occupation of Iraq before we are sure that conditions have been improved there because then they truly would have died in vain. The Blog fully realizes that we did not find any WMDs or terrorist links, but just because the invasion of Iraq did not directly benefit you today does not mean that it was a total waste.   It may not be important to you personally, but one more brutal dictator was removed from power. However, The Blog does not think that we need to start playing stop the dictator the way we played stop the communists (which most Americans were behind at the time) during the Cold War, but The Blog believes that deposing of Saddam was a great thing for Iraq no matter what he was or was not plotting.     Saddam was a man who committed genocide, ordered torture and unfair imprisonment for his own people, and owned multiple lavish palaces while most of his country lived in poverty. Saddam was an evil man with whom justice finally caught up. We have inadvertently given the Iraqi people the opportunity, should they take it, to become a free people.     So, The Blog urges you to remember all of this the next time that you say the lives lost were a waste; remember our brave soldiers who died heroically fighting for what they believed in, freedom.

       Sender: Christian Debt Advisors      Just what I needed! I just cannot get away from those calls from Lucifer telling me that my mortgage payment is behind. I cannot stand this worrying about whether or not my soul will be reposessed. Christian Debt Advisors, you are my light from above!       Subject: You Got lucky This Morning     Well, I am glad I got this e-mail because now I can explain the hangover, the disheveled state of my room, why I woke up naked, the various articles of women's clothing strewn about my room, and the large sum of money missing from my wallet. So, now that we have 3a.m. through 1p.m. filled in, back to 10p.m. through 3a.m.     urlLink

       In this post, The Blog will discuss it's stand on the issue of gay marriage. This Blog would also like to take this opportunity to state that it does not affiliate itself with any political party or organized religion or discourage others from said affiliation, but it does encourage you to take a look at every topic from all angles and put some serious thought into your opinion while you are forming it. I also urge everyone to take a look at many options when choosing the religion, political party, or group that is right for you. With the introduction out of the way lets dive right in to our discussion.     The Blog is firmly for gay marriage, and really does not see a strong argument against it. The only thing other than prejudice that the people opposed to gay marriage have been basing their argument on is a 1800 year old book of contradictions more commonly known to everyone as the Bible.     Now it is time to knock the spindly little legs out from underneath the anti-gay marriage argument. We do not even need to try to take prejudice down because we have been working to rid our country of prejudice since it was founded. The prejudices against homosexuals is just the next bump in the road toward a prejudice-free America. Then we get into the biggest argument against allowing homosexuals to marry.     The argument that it is morally wrong and against the Christian Bible is also not an argument that can not stand up against our constitution. In fact that argument goes against one of the basic liberties we have as Americans, freedom of religion. This argument would in effect force Christian morals upon everyone in our nation.     This brings me to what bothers me the most about the constitutional amendment. It adds contradictions to the Constitution. Not allowing homosexuals to marry brings discrimination into a document, which serves to prevent discrimination.     Now let us discuss some of the solutions proposed and their problems. The first solution was to grant same-sex couples civil unions, which would allow them some of the rights of married couples. This solution still shows discrimination in the way that it does not grant equal rights. Even if it did it would not be an acceptable solution because it would still show prejudice.     The last subject I would like to touch on, that I plan on taking a more in-depth look at in a later post, is whether gay marriage would do anything to destroy the institution of marriage. The answer is  absolutely not . Correct me if I'm wrong, but I have always believed that the whole idea behind marriage was love. Why should it make any difference who makes up the couple that is being married as long as they truly love each other. We all must remember that love is blind, and no one can choose who they fall in love with and truly call it love. Love just happens, and we as humans have no control over love. I believe that sexual orientation is just as uncontrollable as the weather.     In conclusion, I would just like to say that love is love, and that is all that marriage should be based on.

       This is going to be a regular post on The Blog. It is meant to be a   comical   piece, and only the smart ass remarks in blue reflect my own opinions. I will be scouring my bulk mail folder of my YaHoo! e-mail account (the address of which will never be posted on The Blog) periodically and posting the funniest subject lines or sender names along with my take on them.      From: Lewis Baker    Subject: There's a slut on your desk...     This was obviously sent by a psychic's website.      From: Expansive    Subject: For Larger and Firmer Breast     Why can I only enlarge one breast? What if I, like most other humans, have two breasts that are the same size? How would I choose just one breast? If I enlarged one breast would it make my other breast jealous? Would enlarging only one breast show favoritism toward one breast? Then there is the fact that enlarging only one of them would make me unbalanced which would eventually lead to back problems because of said unbalancedness (Yes, I made that word up, but only because it sounds good there.) of my breasts, but in this grand country, the good old US of A, I would be able to sue the person who enlarged just one of my breasts for millions of dollars in damages.      From: Unknown (Courtesy of my father)    Subject: Can you really increase your wee-wee size?     Now the penis enlargement industry has targeted boys ages 3-10. This once again proves that it is never too early to be insecure about your manhood.

       This should be fun. Now everyone who reads The Blog (I think everyone will find this blog to be the blog of all blogs, and soon everyone will be referring to it as "The Blog.") has to deal with me and my opinions.   For now we will allow anyone to post comments. However, if comments get out of control, I am afraid I will have to limit comment posting to members of the Blog only. Comments should only be posted if they contain useful information or an interesting perspective on the topic being discussed. Comments containing things such as "u r gay!!!," "u r a fag," "u r going to hell," "u r stupid," etc. should not be posted. Firstly, they are unfounded accusations. Secondly, they are not spelled correctly. Thirdly, they are not grammatically correct. Lastly, The Blog will do its best to use correct spelling and grammar so that you, the reader, will be able to read it hassle-free, and I would like to request that you show The Blog the same respect that it shows you.
