      i am at a loss with my life right now. school has taken over.  school is preventing me from having a life.  there is so much that i want to do, but i can't because of school.  when i'm not in work, i'm in school.  when i'm not in school, i'm doing homework.  i need to run away...  "linus, you're my son, and i love you very much.  but i think it's time you ran away from home."  is it wrong to covet your brother's best friend?  hehe.  everyone i know says no.  that's the easy part.  it's the execution that's difficult.  you have to be slick... you have to sneak around until it's done and there's nothing anyone can do about it.  what's even more difficult, is budgeting your time around it.    in a month and a half i will be going to the dominican republic.  my whole life i've wanted to travel, and i have a little bit.  i've been to the dominican republic, india, spain, florida, all over new england, las vegas, california (twice), and a road trip to tennessee (twice).  in the states, i've always gone with friends and had a great time.  but out of the country, i've either gone with family or gone to see family.  except for the country in the dr, i've always gotten homesick.  i've always wanted someone there.  for a few days every trip, i wouldn't leave the hotel.  i felt alone.  i felt like i wasn't gaining any experiences because i didn't have anyone to share them with, on my level.  so i'm currently taking applications.  only one person will meet the requirements.  yes, i will be profiling, hehe.  i know who i want.

      so my friend's boyfriend asked my friend how me and my ex-boyfriend were doing (not knowing that we had broken up).  and my friend told her boyfriend that we broke up.  and he said that it was my loss.  true my ex-boyfriend was a really nice guy, but he just wasn't for me.  so is it more beneficial to stay in a relationship and not be happy because it would be your loss to leave the other person, or take the loss and leave?  i think the latter of the two.  what's the point of being in a relationship if you're not happy?  is that really being fair to the other person?  and why is it my loss and not his?  is it anyone's loss for me?  who determines who's loss it is?  is it just the person who did the leaving?  i think i was someone's loss before, but that was more like a good riddance situation.  :o)  i think he was just being a dick.

      so greta's blog entry really got my wheels a turnin'.  so now i will compare my life to reality bites.  vicky minor - i have not slept with so many men that i could even think of keeping a journal with their names and the date i slept with them.  i've slept with 3.  maybe if i wrote a letter of their full names and the dates on every other page... hehe i do not work at the gap.  i worked at banana republic for 3 months, but i still have my full time job.  lelaina pierce - i do worry, but i don't think that i can control my life.  i'm not deciding between 2 men.  and at 22 i didn't fall in love with my friend.  so to me this movie is about how life tends to revolve around your relationships.  i don't have those.  now that i am these fictional charaters' elder, does that make me a spinster?    there must be something wrong with me.  unattainable?  shrew?  eccentric?  not attractive.  is it true that abbeys will not take you if you have tattoos?  i promise, pictures on friday.

      so this is what happened last friday. had a rough day at work and didn't get to leave the office until 6 or 630.  i had to get jose (aka dad) something for father's day.  so i said, "go to the mall today or on saturday?".  i chose today.  so i'm riding down route 7 in friday night traffic to the mall, where i happened to forget that they were having their annual carnival.  once i got through ridgefield, almost to the danbury border, a fire engine started coming down the road, so the cars began to pull over.  due to the traffic, i had to pull over by the wooden stake/metal rope guard rail in what could be the narrowest section of route 7.  i got as close to the edge as possible to allow room for the truck to pass, but i guess it was too close.  as the truck passed, my passenger side front tire slid off the road into a ditch.  i guess where i had stopped, the rain had eroded away the dirt by the road and taken it down-hill to places unknown.  the tire was suspended in mid-air with the frame of my car holding itself up on the pavement.    i have front wheel drive.  i couldn't go forward.  i couldn't back out.  i called triple a. they asked me where i was, i told them that i was almost in danbury.  i got out of the car once i was off the phone with them, looked across the road, and saw that the front half of my car was in danbury and the rear was in ridgefield.  hehe, i wanted to call them back to correct myself.  i digress.  after standing 10-15 minutes on the side of the road, talking to greta, a nice little mexican motorist coming from the carvel down the street stopped.  he walked over to me, licking his strawberry ice cream cone and said, "here's what we're gonna do.  you're gonna hop in your car and steer out while we push."  i said, "the car is suspended on it's frame.  we're not pushin' nuttin'.  triple a is on it's way, but thanks for stopping!"  to that he replied, "oh ok, take care of yourself." two minutes later, another motorist stopped.  this time a 50-something year old man in a red van.  when he saw the problem he said, "we could push you out!"  to this, i had no choice but to laugh.  and then i repeated the same thing i said to the mexican.  the helpful motorist went on his way. one minute later, a ridgefield cop stops behind my car with blinding lights flashing (there was still daylight).  as nice as possible he said, "could you move your car up just a  little  bit?"  as luck would have it, i was 5 feet away from a roadside clearing.  i just pointed at my tire, and then recounted the whole story for what seemed like the 73rd time in the last half hour.  he said, "well you know, this is a high volume area, so i'm gonna have to give you..."  i paniced!  he was going to give me a ticket!  "10 to 15 minutes for the tow truck to get here or..."  he's really going to ticket me!  "we'll have to call another tow that's closer by to get here quick."  PHEW!  i just smiled.  then he said, "i guess i could try to throw a few flares down to slow the on-comming traffic for the time being.  we can see if that helps."  he walks back to his suv grabs three flares and as he's walking past me again, he says, "i'm risking my life... to put down some flares."  hehehe  once he was 5 feet past he turns and starts walking backwards and says, "if i get hit, get on the radio and say 'officer hit by car'!"  i laughed and asked, "can i shout, 'officer down! officer down!'?"  he said, "sure, as long as you say 'hit by car' afterwards."  we both laughed and he walked about 30 feet up the road and waited for a break in the traffic, which took about 5 minutes.  he held up traffic coming from the left and walked out to the yellow line.  he popped two flares and the next vehicle in the on-comming traffic was the tow.  woo hoo.  the tow pulls a u-ey backs up to the car, and the driver hops out to assess the situation.  oh my god.  he was gorgeous. i was like, "uh, hi" in the squeekiest 12 year-old voice. he ties up the car, i steer it out and pull around.  there's no visible damage so he says, "you're all set with me hun."  i just stared at him blankly.  finally, i gave myself a spiritual slap, hopped in my car, and drove off to the mall.  as i passed the cop who was turning around, i honked and waved.  he waved back.  as for the tow truck driver... who was that masked man?!

      I am hanging on by a thread... so tired... must sleep.  So here are some things in my head.  Hessians and Nomads.  The words of the day.  Use it in a sentence.  "Sometimes Adrienne can act like a Hessian."  Hehehe.  We thought the "Hessian" died this morning.  No call no show... must be nice... walkin' 'round like a "Nomad" in NYC.  :o)  i'm sick of caps.  no more caps.  i miss rob.  move back home.  i hate my work ethic.  because of it and the lack in others around me, i was 15 minutes late to school last night.  the teacher threw a chair at me in class yesterday because i was late.  no really!  he did!  okay, well not exactly.  we have this row of chairs that are stacked 5 deep along the wall in the classroom, and i sit in the first chair.  the teacher (whom is most probably a biscuit older than i) usually paces back in forth in front of the class while lecturing, and oftentimes will stop and lean on the door-jam or the chairs.  (he probably weighs 125 soaking wet, so he probably never worries about the chairs' structural stability.)  well yesterday, they weren't so stable.  he's in mid-sentence when one of the chairs came crashing down an inch from my left leg.  i felt so bad... he was so embarrased.  I told him that it was okay.  :o)  i need a new life.  i need to find more time.  there's never enough time.

      Driving home from school today, I figured out that this song is my theme song. (excerpt by AM60 / Always Music 60 / www.am60.com)   Treble bass and midrange alcohol love and pain treble bass and midrange alcohol love and pain  i listen to my records to get me in the mood i drink red wine because it makes me feel good  treble bass and midrange alcohol love and pain treble bass and midrange alcohol love and pain   That about sums it up.  It's not good, it's not bad... it's perfect.   This leads me to think about entertainment as a whole.  It's there to make us happy, right?  We sit there and stare at the boob-tube, or strap on the head set and say, "WHY NOT ME?!"  (Watch Dane Cook.  I adore his stand-up.)  It alters our overall sense of reality.  Does it make us more nit-picky?  Or do we simply refuse to settle for mediocrity?  (See "Dream for an Insomniac")  It at least sets the standards... and that's a shame.  "That's my Grille over there.  It's closed on Sunday.  Whelp.  Whaddareya gonnado?"  And that brings me to the beautiful people.  I asked Greta yesterday to use her unfailing linguistic creativeness to throw me a definition of "beautiful people" for my borderline beautiful person friend who refused to believe that I was not insulting her.  So check out her blog dated June 17, 2004 called "The QED Report".  Be careful, you just may be one of the beautiful people.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  :o)   Tomorrow's commin round a hairpin curve in the road, she's got a run in her stocking and she's missing the heel of her shoe.  woke up this mornin rolled of bed walked up to my mother and said 'hi'.  what i meant to say was, 'why is you life a joke?'  and that day, in my life.  that day.  in my life.  i dreamt tomorrow had a prettier face.  i dreamt tomorrow would have better things to say than 'you look like shit, what's your problem bitch?  your legs look like sandpaper, you can't do anything right'.  and that day never should have taken place.  and this day in my life, still cannot explain why i listened in the first place to you. Oh, yeh.  One more thing... I hope one day you call up your father and have the guts to tell him how he hurt you and how he made you hurt another... cuz it makes me sad.   (hehe sorry slipping into some Poe)  I wanted to say that EVENTUALLY I will get some pics up here... I never have time... what happened to the water?

      Like I said before, my name is kimberley. I work full-time, I go to school part time.  I live at least 30 miles away from any of my friends, so I'm always in the car.  I'm single.  Looking for Mr. Right?  I don't know.  Just looking for something.  I had a boyfriend a week ago.  My first in I don't know how long.  And we just barely reached my quota.  Looking back at my track record with men, I've hardly ever passed the three month mark.  So as I'm breaking up with the last one, he says, "don't you think it's about time you gave someone a chance for longer than 3 months?"  He obviously didn't know me.  Prior to him all the guys I've been with/dated (and I use the term "all" loosely because there hasn't been many), the relationships ended either when there was nothing left or when something catastrophic happened.  So we obviously knew that it was over.  This guy, on the other hand, I wasn't comfortable with him.  I liked him.  He REALLY liked me.  But I wasn't comfortable with him.  I think he liked me too much.  I went from waiting forever for the first kiss to fending him off every night, just like that.  I started thinking about him last night because I realized that he was the first guy that I had to sit and talk with to break up with him.  It killed me.  He's such a nice guy, just not the one for me.  He said that he thought I was the one.  I felt like crap.  So here I am, single again... like always.  Wanting what I can't have.  Being too shy to ask for it.  Why are people always too shy to go and ask someone out?  Why are we always worried about offending someone?  Why are we afraid to live?  For the time being I live vicariously through Greta.  She gives me the lo-down on everything.  Since she started with her blog, I've been more up to date, and I don't feel like I'm bugging her all the time to see what's up.  Here's a link to her blog:   www.theevilfaerie.blogspot.com check her out, she's my hero.  I think that's enough babble for now. PEACE OUT!!

      today is the day dexter and greta first hooked up, and reading greta's blog today brought back that time for me... july 29, 2001.&nbsp; then i realized that i never fully explained that whole situation.   let's start with the beginning... greta = alicia; dexter = harry.&nbsp;  i met harry probably&nbsp;when i was in seventh or eighth grade.&nbsp; i was in my&nbsp;'goth' stage, and harry was stuck in the eighties with aviater glasses, a lambswool lined denim jacket, and complete with a mullet.&nbsp; we were equally&nbsp;scared of each other... literally.&nbsp; &nbsp; we didn't see each other for a couple of years.&nbsp; when i came back, his house had turned into a 'party' house and a bunch of my friends were staying there on and off, even though harry really only had one roommate.&nbsp; i lived there on and off for about four or five years.&nbsp; at the beginning, the first year or so,&nbsp;i never really met or hung out with harry because he worked nights, but after a while i would take him to work and go visit him at work.&nbsp; harry became like a brother to me.&nbsp; he still is, and i still love him very much.   i met alicia my freshman year of high school... when she was dating my brother, chris.&nbsp; she was a little, um, how shall i say... off, so we didn't interact that much.&nbsp; she was always around but we never hung out.&nbsp; alicia and chris got married shortly after i came back from india, but nothing had changed.&nbsp; once she and chris got divorced, her whole life changed... she became a new person, and that's when we became friends.&nbsp; but we weren't just friends... she was my sister.   for a couple years i was living at harry's and hanging out with alicia, all the time.&nbsp; but they never met.&nbsp; alicia and i would go to the diner for hours on end.&nbsp; i would tell her everything that was going on in 'my other world', but i could never imagine her hanging out with any of my other friends.&nbsp; finally, one day, harry and alicia met.&nbsp; my world fell apart.   you ever see that seinfeld episode, when george has two worlds and his fiancee wants to start hanging out with his friends... so his worlds were colliding?&nbsp; yeh, well, that was me.&nbsp; i didn't care that they were hanging out, that was kewl.&nbsp; but ultimately, it was like my brother was dating my sister.&nbsp; it just freaked me out, so i flaked for a couple of months.&nbsp; once i got over my stuff, my issues, i realized how good harry and alicia were, and are, together.&nbsp; so good in fact that they make me sick sometimes.&nbsp; especially in comparison to my life.&nbsp; but it couldn't have happened to two better people.&nbsp; so on their day, to them, i dedicate this song...    come to me, my love    let me do - whatever    to dance, so sweetly (oh yeh)    let me have some... ham...     &nbsp;   it's a pleasure to hold your ham,    darlin' don't you understand???    i'm crazy about yoooouuuu....     &nbsp;   darlin' .... oooohhhh....     &nbsp;   (that was sooo beautiful!)     &nbsp;  :o)

      i just realized today that i can complete one of my associates degrees next year.&nbsp; and that prompted, "what next?!"&nbsp; don't panic, don't panic.  what do i want to do? where do i want to go?&nbsp; what do i want to be when i grow up?  something tells me that i'm going to end up at pace university.&nbsp; and if i'm not studying law, i'll be studying international business.&nbsp; it's so much kewler to walk up to someone and say, "i'm a lawyer." than to say, "i'm an international business-person."&nbsp; does that even mean anything?&nbsp; i really want to go further into business law, but i don't know if i really want to be&nbsp;a lawyer.  if anyone has any ideas, please comment or shoot me an email.  oh yeh, and don't tell me that i should do whatever makes me happy, i've heard that enough. straight answers only please!  peace out.

      so last night i took my final.&nbsp; as the teacher handed me back my homework (handed in the day before) he said, "and you just completed&nbsp;eight weeks with me!"&nbsp; i replied, "yeh, it's a miracle."  now i have two weeks to myself.&nbsp; then two weeks in the dominican republic, which i am now dreading because of my obtuse family.&nbsp; then, the monday after i return (a day and a half later), i am back to work and back to school.&nbsp; it never ends.&nbsp; and i think i might actually have to take a saturday class in the fall semester.&nbsp; i still haven't taken science, i've been putting it off.&nbsp; so because of science class scheduling, the only way i could take another class would be on a saturday.&nbsp; it stinks.  today i have decided that my weirdness no longer astounds.&nbsp; therefore, i may have to begin wearing a fanny pack to work.&nbsp; :o)

      i lead a semi sheltered life.&nbsp; well, people want me to lead a sheltered life.&nbsp; for some reason, people i know try to protect me from ridiculous things.&nbsp; i'm talking out of my ass because i don't have any examples right now.&nbsp; just in general people tell me half the story or simply keep things from me.&nbsp; why?&nbsp; just to make me mad later when i find out?&nbsp; i'm very understanding.&nbsp; what i don't understand, i ask questions about.&nbsp; but why keep the truth from me?   cheaters...&nbsp; if you're cheating, why don't you just get out of the relationship and just be single?&nbsp; why hurt everyone?&nbsp; i just don't understand why a lot of guys will get in a relationship and just start cheating.&nbsp; if the girl you're with isn't all what you're looking for, why stay with her?&nbsp; you're wasting everyone's time.&nbsp; (girls aren't off the hook, this goes for you too.&nbsp; i just tend to speak from the girl's perspective.&nbsp; occupational hazzard.)   liars...&nbsp; if you tell me that you're never going to go someplace again, why do you go there and lie?&nbsp; if i meant that much to you, then you just wouldn't go.&nbsp; priorities.&nbsp; what's more important?&nbsp; the place or me?&nbsp; if you love that place so much, just dump me and go there.   agree-ers...&nbsp; don't agree with me to avoid an arguement.&nbsp; i'd like you better if you didn't.&nbsp; and basically, that's lying.&nbsp; everyone has an opinion, it's a fact.&nbsp;   why are we so afraid of other people?&nbsp; or&nbsp;why are&nbsp;we afraid of losing them?&nbsp; just control yourself.&nbsp; whoever said that you had to be psycho to be happy?&nbsp; just because you're under control doesn't mean that you're missing out on life.&nbsp; if you're controlling yourself for someone else, it has to be worth it.&nbsp; you have to be happy.&nbsp; you have to have someone who will do your crazy stuff with you.&nbsp;   &nbsp;  just don't hold back.  don't hold me back.  don't shelter me.  we all&nbsp;make mistakes.  let me breathe.   we&nbsp;live,&nbsp;we learn.  i will love you.  we can be true.  as long as you love me.  we can both be free.   we all&nbsp;can be happy.  we all&nbsp;can be free.  we all can be pretty.  we all can't be me.   &nbsp;

      as i was driving home from school this evening, i was thinking, "you can't always get what you want".&nbsp; i'd like to take a moment to analyze this and see how it relates to mwah.&nbsp; (in case you haven't noticed, i am highly overanalytical.)  i don't think that i have ever gotten what i wanted.&nbsp;  this does not count things you can buy.&nbsp; i was not spoiled as a child, but once i was old enough to work, i chose a profession that would yield a good salary.&nbsp; therefore, i spoil myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;i've actually worked two jobs at a time to keep up with my wants.&nbsp; i'm talking about all the things you can't control and&nbsp;that money can't buy.  money can't buy you happiness... money can't buy you love...  i don't think i've ever been happy.&nbsp; some of my friends can attest to this... well, the ones that realize.&nbsp; for the longest time, i didn't know what i wanted.&nbsp; but once i new how to identify my wants, i&nbsp;then realized that i was unable to attain them.&nbsp; i'm not just talking relationships, i'm talking everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;for example, the job situation i'm going through now is a good example.&nbsp;  if money could buy you love... um, that freaks me out.&nbsp; i probably wouldn't want the kind you  could  buy.   you can't always get what you want...    but then you find sometimes, you get what you need.    &nbsp; okaaay...&nbsp; nope, never happened.&nbsp; my inability to get what i want has never been coupled with a supply of needs.&nbsp; unless your need is to feel the rejection to "strengthen you character".&nbsp; i must have the strongest character of 100 women.&nbsp; nah nah nah, "it builds character," nah nah nah.&nbsp;  my&nbsp;uncle always told me that you're dealt the cards that you can&nbsp;handle.&nbsp; he says that it doesn't build character, it proves that&nbsp;you have&nbsp;character.&nbsp;   so i always wonder what it would be like to get what i want... just even once!&nbsp; i'm not asking to have the luck of a beautiful person... well maybe for a day.&nbsp;  i'd even&nbsp;risk the character.

        i just wanted to clarify somethings for somepeople out there.      no, i did not&nbsp;get a perm.&nbsp; my hair is naturally curly, and to straighten it, i blowdry it.    no, i did not get the job in energy, so i don't know where you heard the rumor from.&nbsp; someone from finance is&nbsp;not moving to energy.    no, my sister does not work in the risk department.&nbsp; jess and i are not related.&nbsp;   yes, my father works for this company.&nbsp; he looks just like me with a comb-over.  don't ask me stupid questions.   what does it mean when you've had a headache for 2 weeks straight?   so i didn't get the job.&nbsp; and when they posted another job, everyone thought it was my job because it said, treasury as the department.&nbsp; i thought the job was a new&nbsp;position for credit, but it turns out that it was my counterpart's position.&nbsp; he might be going to london.&nbsp; this is what the job requires:     bachellor's in finance or economics.    ability to travel 20% of the time.    ability to relocate nationally or internationally, if neccessary.    six months experience in finance.     so i thought... hey, i'm majoring in finance & banking and accounting for my associates... close enough for number one!&nbsp; i love to travel!&nbsp; i'll move down the street!&nbsp; six months?&nbsp; i've working in finance for six years!&nbsp; so basically, i applied.    okay, i'm being dramatic.&nbsp; i phoned paris and talked to gauthier who used to be in that position before rodrigo and whom the new employee would kind of be reporting to, and he told me to apply as a backup because i knew that i didn't meet the requirements.&nbsp; i spoke with bob and he said i know the job, i've just never done it.&nbsp; so i applied yesterday morning, knowing that i wouldn't get the job.&nbsp; they would like&nbsp;to get someone from one of our european offices over here, but they have to try here first.    later in the day, mark, the head of credit asked me to see him in his office.&nbsp; turns out, my buddy joann, got a promotion!&nbsp; well, it's not really a promotion yet until they get someone doing her old stuff, because it's only her and mark in credit.&nbsp; i digress, so mark says that they're trying to get a new position approved for a third person, with room for growth.&nbsp; he wanted to know if that would be something that i would be interested in.&nbsp; he said that they had been watching me, and they like the way i work and interact with other employees and bank&nbsp;reps.&nbsp; he&nbsp;had seen so much that i have done in the last two years, that i&nbsp;thought had gone unnoticed!&nbsp; he knew more about what i had done than my own boss did.&nbsp; so obviously, i said yes.&nbsp;     the job requires a lot of meetings, traveling (mostly domestic), and telephone conversations.&nbsp; all setting up credit with and for vendors.&nbsp; it's really interesting.&nbsp; in the last six months, joann has been to mexico, london, and houston (i think).&nbsp; so it's a great idea, but there's no guarantees that anything will happen.&nbsp; if they get approved for the job there's no guarantee that i would get it.&nbsp; so he could be getting my hopes up for nothing.    so here i go.&nbsp; waiting.&nbsp; again.&nbsp; like always.&nbsp; i'm always waiting.&nbsp; i hate waiting.    so what is a two week headache?     &nbsp;

      so there's this sign in front of a storage facility, down the street from my office.&nbsp; every once in a while, they put up inspirational phrases, or simply things that make you think.&nbsp; so i have decided, every time they change the sign, it will be a new post in my blog.&nbsp; i will disect/interpret it, and then relate it to my own life.&nbsp; so here it goes...  &nbsp;  "show others your light, not your shadow"  &nbsp;  'light' can mean: spiritual awareness; illumination; individual opinions, choices or standards.  'shadow' can mean: phantom; ghost; insignigicant portion.  &nbsp;  so basically they're saying, "let the&nbsp;people see all of you, not just what's on the surface."  isn't that beautiful?!&nbsp; hehe.&nbsp; it's hard to say if you, personally,&nbsp;do this or not.&nbsp; it's hard to see for yourself the image you project, and if people really 'get' you.&nbsp; i know greta gets me, but we've been friends for a very long time and we've been through a lot together.  i think people see what i want them to see.&nbsp; not because i think they won't approve of or like the rest, just because i don't like to have to explain myself to people that i don't really care about, and let's face it, don't really care about me.&nbsp; whatever you don't know, that you want to know, just ask me... i'm open.&nbsp; and if you don't ask, then i'll just know...&nbsp; i'll just know that it doesn't matter.  &nbsp;  i'm basically just saving everyone some time and energy.

      i feel like venting about how my family has brainwashed me for at least the last 12 years of my life. &nbsp; i'm 100% dominican.&nbsp; don't call us puerto rican, most dominican's won't stand for that, but i digress...&nbsp; stereotypically, hispanic families are huge.&nbsp; my family does not fall short of this preconceived notion in the least.&nbsp; so no matter where you live, if you're hispanic, the focus is on family.&nbsp; and your job, is to make the family BIGGER. &nbsp; ever since the age of 12, my family stopped saying, "hello" to me.&nbsp; instead of the normal greeting, they now ask, "do you have a boyfriend?!"&nbsp;&nbsp;they feel that i need to be with someone at all times.&nbsp; not just me, but all of my other cousins (which are mostly&nbsp;all younger than me) have all been in and out of relationships since the age of at least 15.&nbsp; only once was i able to answer yes.&nbsp; so the other 99% of the time, obviously, is no. &nbsp; my family, having started with the berating at such a young age, has warped my mind.&nbsp; i have never lowered my standards just to get a guy, i know what's acceptable.&nbsp; i have never slept around.&nbsp; but i have always felt that something was missing.&nbsp; it kinda makes you wonder what the hell is going on when your whole family (both sides), from cousin to grandparents to second cousins and beyond, are all asking you where your boyfriend is, just to find out that you don't have one.&nbsp; my whole life, i have tried to excel at everything i do.&nbsp; if i wanted to learn about something, i would go out and do it.&nbsp; i always taught myself.&nbsp; but with relationships, i could never "do".&nbsp; i always felt like i was failing my family every time i went to visit.&nbsp; so i stopped going to see them. &nbsp; about six years ago, i went down to the dominican republic to visit my mother's parents for a month.&nbsp; i was around 16 or 17, and it was my second trip down there.&nbsp; my grandparents were very happy that i was there, but worried at the same time.&nbsp; they were worried about the guys in the neighborhood.&nbsp; they wouldn't let me leave the house unescorted.&nbsp; after a couple of weeks of this i got fed up, and somehow, my younger cousin jeff figured out a way to start sneaking in guys to see me while everyone else was out of the house.&nbsp; here's the BIG mistake...&nbsp; i ended up messing around with one of these guys once... yeh, once.&nbsp; and there went the neighborhood.&nbsp; this guy swore that he fell in love with me, and that he wanted to marry me.&nbsp; he had tried to call me when i had gotten back to the states, several times.&nbsp; ( he helped my grandparents so he was able to get my number from the house.)&nbsp; later, i had found out that my grandparents actually got into a fight with him, telling him to leave me alone, and he said he just couldn't. &nbsp; now, i told you this story to tell you this.&nbsp; in one month, i am going back to the dr for the first time in six years.&nbsp; last week, my aunt's idiot of a husband (leandro) came down to visit my mother.&nbsp; i hadn't seen him in a few years, and he'll be down in the dr the same time we're all going.&nbsp; while talking, he brings up this guy.&nbsp;&nbsp;leandro tells me that&nbsp;this guy has been&nbsp;waiting for me, and that leandro has been telling him all about me over the years.&nbsp; what a nightmare! &nbsp; you ever have something you did six years ago come back and bite you in the ass?!&nbsp; this is so bad.&nbsp; two weeks in a small town where everyone knows everyone, and a guy stalking me. &nbsp; this is my curse.&nbsp; hispanic, black, and old men all love me.&nbsp; i don't know why, but that's the way it is.&nbsp; and there's my family on the side, instigating the whole thing. &nbsp; i just want to be happy.&nbsp; i just want to have something to be happy about.&nbsp; i just work... i just go to school... i just pay bills... i just do homework.&nbsp; right now, i'm the third wheel.&nbsp; it's not as bad as it could be because when we all go out, i make my own fun, and entertain the crowd.&nbsp; but when push comes to shove... i have no one to dance with. &nbsp; my family has brainwashed me.

      well, if you noticed a comment to my post entitled "who are they hurting?", you would have seen greta mention h.w.a.n. after discussing it further, we believe that it's time for the world to know who h.w.a.n. is.   like greta said, it all started late one night at the diner we had frequented all through high school and beyond. and after i don't know how many years, we kinda ran out of stuff to talk about that night, and this is what popped into our heads.   you see, the group that we took with us from high school were guys that were all into video games, comic books and sci-fi movies. they loved them so much that whenever we went to the diner with the whole group, we knew it was inevitable that an argument would break out over which comic book is the best, which star wars movie is the best, etc. each one of the guys would refuse to capitulate, so these arguments would go on, literally all night... i digress.   so this night, we had nothing else to talk about, and someone must have asked about the guys and where they were or something that got us talking about how stupid the arguments were about superheroes. and then it his us... we were all like superheroes! but not like the kewl popular superheroes... we were the rejects. thus, heroes without a name began.   everyone in the group has been privy to these tiring arguments, therefore, we have only been able to make one addition to the original crew. the one addition was harry, sorry harry but you're stuck with us!!   so here they are!!  (in no particular order)   1. kevin - aka   syndicate boy   - he has the power of remote control. he can stop, rewind, fast forward, and pause anything. his weapon of choice is a tool belt, in which he carries small tools for throwing anything to keep him from getting out of the laz-e-boy. he dresses like a telephone/cable repair man. his theme song is  born in the usa  by bruce springstein.   2. chris - aka   fan boy   - aka   the master debator   - he has the power of astral projection which is a psychic ability that allows him to project his psychi onto the astral plane. (this was described to me as when in the first x-men professor xavier used this to locate rouge just by touching his head, without using cerebro.) his weapon of choice is his manbag. if you get too close, he'll swing his manbag full of books and comics at you. he is commonly wearing a baseball cap and some sort of sports memorabilia. his theme song is  the blueshirt medley  (aka the new york rangers' theme song).   3. kimberley - aka   the inkblot   - she has the power of tattoo animation. covered in tattoos, she can make her tattoos come to life to fight on her behalf or to use as a weapon. her weapon of choice is bacitracin with which she can slime or drown you. she is commonly seen wearing ripped cover-alls in an attempt to control the tattoos when they are not needed. her theme song is  sabatoge  by the beastie boys.   4. alicia - aka   the freak   - she has the power of addiction. she can make you become addicted to anything to the point of insanity. her weapon of choice is her shit-kickin' boots which can flatten you or simply kick your ass. she is commonly seen wearing a tanktop with a faerie and big swooshie pants and obviously, she never leaves home without her shit-kickin' boots. her theme song is  shitlist  by l7.   5. mike - aka   white boy   - he has the power of bloody slander. he can make your ears bleed with his bloody slander. his weapon is mojo, with which he lures you in to then unleash his bloody slander. he is usually seen wearing a pinstripe suit and a fedora. his theme song is  i'm too sexxy  by right said fred.   6. tom - aka   monkey boy   - he has the power to put shit in your pants. basically, he makes you shit your pants with his weapon the brown note. he has a dark and sinister look about him and is usually wearing a dark trench coat, sunglasses, and ear muffs to protect himself. his theme song is  proudest monkey  by dave matthews band.   7. rob - aka   frat boy   - he has the power of seasoning. he can emit seasoning from his hands and blind or choke you. when all else fails, he throws his weapon, rice. he is usually dressed like a college boy with a chef's hat. his theme song is  blister in the sun  by the violent femmes.   8. jessica - aka   the divine miss j   - she has the power of being a verbal vixen. she spits slam poetry that brings you to your knees. her weapon of choice are tweezers, that she uses to pluck every hair from your body. she is usually mistaken for a new age beatnik with lots of eye makeup. her theme song is  l.a. woman  by the doors.   9. steve - aka   the village idiot   - he has the power of world domination. he has millions of plans to take over the world, which doesn't really help him fight crime, but what did you expect? he's the village idiot. his weapon is his highly unintentional dizzying intellect. usually seen wearing a towel as a cape and his underwear over his pants, with his finger up his nose. his theme song is  macho man  by the village people.   10. kaylee - aka   the potty mouth   - she has the power of knock knock jokes. her nonsensical knock knock jokes will make your brain explode. her weapon is her cuteness shield, not really a weapon at all, but effective in that no one can touch her. she's just too damn cute! she is usually seen in a ballerina barbie costume. her theme song is  shine on you crazy diamond  by pink floyd. (she must have been 3 or 4 when we made this up!)   11. harry - aka   normal boy   - he has the power of landscaping. he can even the land and anything in his way. he "trims the edges" or "loose ends" with his weedwacker; his weapon of choice. he is commonly see wearing sleeveless t-shirts and old dirty sneakers. his theme song is  more human, than human  by white zombie.   together we unite to make hwan!!!

      so below is a picture of my namesake, kimberley.  technically, she's my cousin; my mother's youngest brother's daughter.  i'm hardly around that part of the family because they're always moving due to work and financial strain, so i probably see them about once every three years.  for a little while i tried to keep in touch by phone, but then phone numbers were changed/cut off.    kimberley was born when i was seventeen or about to turn seventeen.  while i was in nyc visiting family for the first time in two years, my uncle happened to show up with his family in tow; needless to say, the new baby as well.  she was passed around for a little while and when things calmed down, she was handed back to her mother who had been sitting and talking with me in the kitchen.  my brow furrowed as i said, 'you know, no one ever told me her name!"  my aunt smiled at my uncle, and he answered, "she has the same name as you."    i was astonished!  so many thoughts rushed through my mind.  i didn't want anyone to have my name!  wait, i hated my name!  it's so plain... i've known so many people with the same name as me!  how could they do this?!  immediately, i started quizzing my aunt and uncle, "how do you spell her name?"  "the same way you do."  "wait, k-i-m-b-e-r-l-E-y?"  "yup."  "wait, did you give her a middle name?"  "nope."  i don't have a middle name either.  i was stuck.  they named her after me.  and then i realized... we have different last names.  i was saved.  finally, i agreed to hold my namesake.  she was beautiful.  three years later, my aunt and uncle do some more moving and i finally track them down in upstate new york.  i got their phone number from another aunt and gave them a call.  a little girl answers the phone.  "hello?"  "hi... um, is sonia home?"  (very excited now, "hi!"  "um, do you know who this is?"  "yes, you have the same name."  "what?"  "you have my name."  "oh yeh, and what is that?"  "kimberley."  she was four.  she knew who i was.  i never talked to her on the phone before.  i was struck dumb.  after talking for a couple more minutes, after she asks me when i'm coming to visit, her mother finally gets on the phone.  i asked how the hell she knew who i was!  she told me that they told her stories about me every day.  i didn't believe her.  my uncle gets on the phone.  he tells me the same thing.  he said that kimberley never wanted to hear any other stories.  she always wanted to hear about the girl with the same name.  she knew me better than i did.  three years later, my mother decides to take care of kimberley and her older brother mikey for a week in the summer.  she volunteered my services, but i was glad she did.  i spent a whole week with kimberley, and got to know her like she new me.  but it didn't take that long.  we were exactly the same.  the only differences were the ages and the environment we grew up in.  i was talking to myself at age seven.  she's about 5 years old in this picture.  i just found out that this summer, when i go to the dominican republic, kimberley's and my godmother (the same aunt) is paying for her and mikey to come with us.  mom says they want to go to the timeshare for 3 days while we're there.  to that i said, "i don't want to go.  i want to stay at mom's."  (i call her mother mom.)  her boyfriend said, "ha!  you're gonna git stuck baby sitting!"    to that i replied, "that's the point."  :o)

      through the years i have been a confidant to many guy friends.  they confide all of their relationship problems, and i witness a lot myself.  so to help the rest of the guys out there, i decided to make this list so you know if your girlfriend is psycho, and it's time to go.   1.  she doesn't like any of your friends.  it's okay if she doesn't like one or two of your friends, but if she doesn't like any of them, there's a problem.  if you are friends with these people that means that you like them and most probably you have stuff in common with them.  therefore if she doesn't like them, that's almost like telling you that she doesn't like you.   2.  she 'goes off' on you at a party (or in public).  there is a time and a place for everything.  there's no need to embarrass someone in front of all of their friends.  if she doesn't have enough common sense to keep your private life private... she's just plain crazy.  the only time this is acceptable is if she is trying to break up with you.  everyone enjoys seeing a good break up!   3.  she comes at you with a weapon or the intent to harm.  this includes anything hurled in your general direction.  attempting to harm someone never solves anything.  enough said.   4.  she messes with your stuff.  now this is usually coupled with another symptom of psychoness, to gauge severity.  there are two angles to this one.  while you're out of the house, she rearranges or hides all of your stuff from you.  OR she throws all of your stuff out the window.  be careful with the first one because she might just be cleaning.  if a girl willingly cleans for you on a whim... damn, she's a keeper.   5.  she calls you more than neccessary or leaves you 10 voice mail messages in a short span of time.  she's expempt from this one at the beginning of a relationship though; in the lovey-dovey stage.  it also does not count if you're playing telephone tag.  she will primarily use this tactic to keep tabs on you.  she has to know where you are, whom you're with, and what you're doing... NOW!  this also may include going through your phone to see who you have called and who has called you (which falls under number 6 as well).   6.  if you weren't dating, by her actions, she could be categorized as a stalker.  this happens when you tell her you're going out and she shows up wherever you are.  watch out, she may try to cover this one up with excuses of her friends or happenstance.  but some girls are just shameless, and when they find you they don't cover, but they hover and glue themselves to your hip... and you thought you were going to get some alone time!  ha!   7.  she accuses you of something you didn't do... repeatedly.  everyone is entitled to one 'get out of jail free' card on this one.  but if it's frequently, that's it.  she's way too insecure or she did something wrong herself that she's trying to cover up.  bad news.   8.  she randomly shows up at your job, unannounced.  big big big no no!  that is messing with your job my friend!  enough said.   9.  you are 'required' to go to her family functions, but you are basically not 'allowed' to go to your own family functions.  this is just wrong.  you know what this is?  she's brainwashing you.  the only way that brainwashing works is to keep the subject away from home and common sense.  this may be coupled with number one... no friends.  and finally, the ultimate....  10.  when she leaves the house, she unplugs the cable wire and takes it with her so you can't watch tv while she's gone and possible see a naked woman.  (sorry kenny)  that is simply absurd, and if it ever gets this far, you might as well stay with her because you must be touched in the head as well!  THE END!  so please feel free to carry this list in your pocket, just in case your girl does something funny and you want to make sure she's not going psycho.  and remember, no matter what anyone says, she can't be helped.  it's just better to leave.  just to be on the safe side, here's a short list of NORMAL things your girl might do that might make you worried, but don't worry, it's okay.  1.  clean your house. (this means that she likes you or loves you very very very very much.  let's face it, boys are messy.  and the stuff you find while cleaning... well, let's just say you're lucky she's still talking to you.) 2.  she does your laundry. (please see number one.) 3.  she calls you twice a day just to say hi. (this is normal.  women are emotional.  if they think of you and can't see you, they'll call.  and they hope you call too whenever you think of them.) 4.  she clings to you at a party. (this means that she is uncomfortable for some reason.  maybe she doesn't know anyone, maybe she doesn't want to get lost, but please take it easy on her.  if you need space in this situation, you have to find someone or someplace that she's comfortable.  then she'll be okay leaving you.) 5.  she talks about you to all her friends. (everyone needs a second opinion.  that or she wants to make everyone else jealous.  you're such a great guy!)  :o)  if any of these are your girl, please be nice.  don't take it the wrong way.  i probably missed a lot of other things, but i think i got the basics.  good luck guys!

      ade and i don't smoke together anymore.  she's got her boyfriend now. ade and i used to hang out too.  but she's got her boyfriend now. that is so sad.  i used to have long hair.  and then i cut it. it grew back again.  but then i cut it. that is so sad.  i am such in a weird mood today.  my boss' boss is in the hallway shouting "john???  sayeeeed" to fabrizzio whom they call johnny, who in turn is shouting "doug???? sayeeeeed" to rick my boss' boss, whom they call doug.  this is a strange company, but at least they make me laugh.  hmm, nice segway...  i didn't get the job.  i didn't even get an interview.  the other day a guy from hr saw me in the hallway and said, "oh hey kim, about the job... it seems as though they found someone to fill the position.  by the way, where does rick sit?"  after i pointed to rick's office i was struck dumb.  but i can't really complain.  that's how i got my job now.  they were interviewing for it, but i decided to take it as a promotion in my department.    i was just disappointed.  it was perfect.  the funny thing is that they just posted another job that is in this division and they mentioned some of the things that i deal with here, and if you're not familiar with this division, it could sound a lot like my job.  but really it's dealing with the other side of my job.  so i've been getting phone calls non-stop people asking me if that's my job posted and if i'm moving to energy... it's ridiculous.  like poparazzi (sp).  so it's back to the drawing board.  i must devise a new plan.  i may just have to leave here entirely.  the only thing holding me back is school.  they pay for school, not much, but it's something.  so my sudden 'happy-spark' is gone once again.  damn i need a cigarette.  i'm going to smoke... alone.

      the other day i was reading the new york post, and one of the cover stories was about george w. bush and his campaign to amend the constitution to ban same sex marriages. "to protect the sanctity of marriage." what bullshit. common sense no longer prevails, homophobia has taken over. yeh that's right... i said a bad word; homophobia.   everyone acts like they're not homophobic, but why else would you not want to let these people be legally united? are you scared that once a homosexual couple got married, they would immediately run out and try to get "converts"? instead of regular wedding invitations, they would have a pamphlet somewhat akin to a vacation brochure depicting preferred sexual positions, and all the perks of being gay.    CUM BE GAY WITH ME!  Tired of being 'straight'? Just want to be 'crooked'?!  Enjoy the freedom of being gay! Men, love thy brother! Women, love thy sister!  Spread the joy of living and HIV throughout the world!  Ever wanted the opportunity to be excommunicated from the catholic church?  How about to be discounted politically? Ever want to be stoned by the masses?   CURRENT EVENTS:  -Join our Annual Gay Parade!  -Cum to our monthly meetings on how to convert by way of adoption! (The "Git 'em while they're young" campaign.)  -Be a local public high school speaker! (The "Get them while they're sexually frustrated" campaign.)    come on people. have some brains. didn't the pc movement get rid of all stereotypes? because being homosexual is a sexual preference, people believe that homosexuals are ALWAYS thinking about sex. i'm heterosexual, that's a sexual preference, am i always thinking about sex? like, whom i could "attack" next? gay people aren't the only people with aids... look at africa... are they all gay?   why are politicians so afraid of same sex marriages? all i keep reading is, "it's not right. it's not the way god planned it." well, who made these people the way they are then? some mad scientist? the politicians never voice the "whys". i want to know why. i want some hard evidence, scientific evidence, statistics of tests in a controlled environment on how same sex marriages could shatter our country, reverse everything we know to be true. up to become down, left to become right, black to become white... all because two people, two humans, two citizens, that LOVE each other get married. are you telling me it's wrong to love? what if you couldn't marry the person you loved? what would that do to you? not even just that, what if the government didn't want you to get married so bad that they would AMEND THE CONSTITUTION to make sure that you didn't. effectively, banishing you from this country. a country that has served as a sanctuary from religious tyrants, from fascism, but for freedom. for some reason, our political leaders are trying to revoke these rights from homosexuals. why? because of religious beliefs? where's the separation of church and state? hmm, it does say, "in god we trust" on our legal tender... so is it all a lie?   what am i supposed to believe in?   kerry and edwards are going to oppose the motion, but they can't even stand by it. they DON'T approve of same sex marriages. they only want to protect the constitution. if this goes through and an amendment to the constitution is made, this would open the door to other constitutional amendments. if it passes, i propose that we issue another amendment stating, "all people that don't have an IQ of at least 110 will not be allowed to work, speak, or be seen. they must all live in caves." why? well, because god hates an idiot. he didn't make handicapped people! they should be shunned! remember the tv show 'life goes on'? that's right! corky's out!   remember when the biggest problem were the inter-racial relationships? why didn't they ever propose to amend the constitution for that? is it because in the slavery days the 'massa' couldn't keep his 'little friend' in his pants? so who has to come out of the closet to make this all okay? jeb bush, maybe?&nbsp;  there's actually an out-in-the-open lesbian&nbsp;working at my company.&nbsp; (not common in an office; people are always scared of other peoples' reaction and consequently their treatment.)&nbsp; not only is she the only person in her division with some brains, but her son is the smartest, cutest, most well rounded 7 year old i've ever met.&nbsp; her partner was artificially inseminated by a friend, and i'm glad they chose to have children, it was a good decision.&nbsp; their son is perfect.&nbsp; rebecca brought&nbsp;him in to work last valentine's day to hand out candies, and he was adorable, asking people to be his valentine.&nbsp; later in the day&nbsp;ade had a conversation with him in the woman's bathroom; he believed that the temerature of the sink water which is automatically set is way to hot and someone could get burned.&nbsp; what kind of kid thinks of this!&nbsp; he was actually worried about&nbsp;the women here burning their hands when they washed them! &nbsp; comparing children of homosexuals and heterosexuals, i always find that the children of homosexuals are better mannered, smarter, and more caring.&nbsp; is it because children are such a gift to a&nbsp;gay or lesbian&nbsp;couple?&nbsp; i don't know, but give me rebecca's son anyday!  &nbsp; well, i can't talk about this anymore. i become too overwrought, and emotional.  but what can i do? we'll never get a gay man in the office. shit, we may never get a woman in the office. until they give me someone to believe in, for everything, i can't show my support for someone i don't agree with. i don't want to be hanged for someone else's decision.   so i don't complain. i do my job. i pay my bills. i'm greatful for MY freedom. but i still hope for the best.

      for now you're just gonna have to check below for muh pic.  greta has to teach me how to get muh pic in muh blog profile.  yeh the pic is old, but i try to stay out of pics as much as possible.  (i have too many bad angles, hehe.)  but don't worry, i still look the same.  people from kinder-garden still recognize me, it's scary.  since i got my hair cut again, i think the only thing that's changed is my glasses.  anywho... also for your enjoyment, i have posted the few pics of some of my tattoos that i had ready to post.  it's kinda late tonight, but since i'm all hooked up now for pics, i'll post more soon when it's not so late.  hey mon! gotta go to work!  (not now, just in the mornin'.  but it's past my bed-time!)

      whatever happened to megadeath? anywho.  i think i'm doing a little bit better.  but still nothing changes.  huge event - i got to ride my lowrider (bicycle) this weekend, bad knee and all.  i didn't care about my knee.  i just really wanted to ride, and i had a great time.  my knee is a little swollen for it and i got a nasty cut on the back of one of my calves, but i'll live.  my father is in canada this week so i have the whole house to myself.  the added responsibility for the house and for myself gives me motivation.  i don't know why, it just does.  don't get me wrong, i still want to run away from home and i will as soon as i have a place to go for a bit.  today i have a midterm exam in my microeconomics class... woohoo.  which means i'll get out of school early today.  which means i'm going to be a normal person and go grocercy shopping, clip coupons, buy normal stuff at a grocery store.  cereal, juice, cold cuts, crackers, bread... it's gonna be fun!    robert is scaring me right now.  he is making weird gestures and faces mumbling, "can't get it riiiight."  i have applied for a new job.  same company, new people, different paycheck... i'm waiting for an interview.  called the girl (she's like my age) today just to let her know i applied.  she said, "i hope everything works out."  i didn't know how to take that, but anywho.  my boss led me to believe there might have to be a custody battle, but i highly doubt it.  to stay my opportunity cost would be too great.  i have to move on, live my life.

      i guess the last 24 hours can be categorized as a bad day.  i'll start off easy...  last night i had school.  not so bad, but i had one of those days where your reflexes get the better of you and you throw your pen clear across the room... twice.  then class was over, i get to my car and there's a voicemail waiting.  it's my brother chris.  mom's in the hospital.  she had an allergic reaction to something and her face swelled up like a balloon.  i got through to the hospital and she could barely talk or breathe.  they hooked her up to an adrenaline iv drip, and once she was stabalized, they sent her home.  so she's okay.  this morning i had a doctor's appointment with my rheumatologist, for my knee.  where i realized that i've been medicated for five months for the same problem.  so guess what i won?!  that's right!  a shot of cortizone to the knee, three days of pain, more powerful anti-inflammatories, and i get to walk with a cane!  i'll be okay.  then i get into work.  everything is status quo for a late friday morning, and then ade gets a visit from her mother's co-worker/close friend.  it turns out that her counterpart in canada, who has been a long time friend that she talks to everyday, hanged himself.  one of his co-workers was concerned that he was late to work this morning and went to his house.  she found him hanging.  i had just met this man a few weeks ago when he came down to the office.  such a great guy, handsome, easy-going.  i knew he was going through a divorce, with two young children... what went wrong?  what was so bad that he just couldn't deal anymore?  so a bad day.  what's the significance of a pregnant doe in your yard?  is it a bad omen?  i got ready this morning talking to a pregnant doe.  i woke up and she was laying down in the yard, her stomach large and beautiful.  after i took a shower and was back in my room, she slowly got up and started munching on the low branches of trees, making a giant circle around the yard.  we made eye contact a couple of times, and when i left i told her to have a good day and to take care.

      the president''s puzzle  dick cheney walks into the oval office and sees the president whooping and hollering. "what's the matter, mr. president?" the vice president inquired. "nothing at all, boss. i just done finished a jigsaw puzzle in record time!" the president beamed. "how long did it take you?" "well, the box said '3 to 5 years' but I did it in a month!"  hehee.  :o)  well, this is it... crunch time.  here are the random thoughts running through my head.  i wish i was taller so i could walk really fast and look like i'm moving in slow motion.  i have to do laundry as soon as i get home.  is it better to fold your clothes flat, or fold and then roll them?  my brother is weird.  how much water did i drink today?  does my father know my grandmother's phone number?  what's greta wearing on friday?  how's becky feeling?  how can i add to my desktop-bobble-head collection?  where are we eating out on friday?   is my dietician going to say that i'm doing well?  what is she going to have me do on vacation?  why haven't they posted my final grades yet?  when can i buy my books?  i hope harry wins some money at foxwoods.  i hope jess likes the show.  where is my pen?  how long will it take me to do my laundry?  will i be able to go bar hoppin' with chris?  ...and a million other things that i forgot already.  but i have my lists for what i need to bring so i should be fine there, and hopefully i won't forget anything.  peace out!

      "if i cried me a river of all my confessions, would i drown in my shallow regret?" - sarah mclachlan "uphill battle"  touch   here we are on "lazy day", counting down to the sarah mclachlan concert and my two week vacation. i'm at least excited about the concert. :o)  when i was 12, i went to my first concert with my best friend cate and her family. it was the spring of 1993... we made a day-trip up to upstate new york and our grand finale was sarah. i was scared, i was happy, i was everything all at once. my first concert. she was phenomenal. fans were throwing stuffed animals from the balcony, chanting, "we love you sarah!" it was great.  so here we are eleven and a half years later. greta heard that sarah was touring and found a venue in rhode island. perfect. i haven't been able to see her since then. a little while ago, greta introduced her oldest niece (jessica) to sarah, and it was love at first listen. maybe we are starting a tradition, but we are taking jessica to her first concert on friday... to see sarah mclachlan. just the girls... perfect.

      keeping a food diary is fun.  i think.  i wonder what the dietician will say when she sees what i ate for the week...  i go to see her thursday night before i leave on vacation.  ahhh, wacation hehehe.  i'm already feeling the stress.  i'm getting tense.  if my mother asks me one more time if i'm packed already....  i told her i'll pack the day before we go, no sooner.  there are 13 people going.   13!!!   wait, actually, maybe more... jeff might come.  and they want us all to go to a timeshare and some point in time, including people who live in the dr.  it's madness.  i refuse to go.  i told my mother that i'm sticking with my grandparents and that's it!  freaks... all of them.  oh yeh, and i was given permission to tell off my uncle whenever i feel like it.  i don't know... blah.

      go ahead, wiggle yer toes while you read.  so i had my first visit with my nutritionist/dietician.  to say the least, she was astounded at how i prepared my coffee... or better yet, how much sugar i put in it.  :o)  she said with the sugar in my coffee and the amount of coffee i drink alone, i get 2070 calories a day.  :o(  so i'm cutting back on the coffee.  i'm already on decaf with the acid-reflux, now i'm on whole milk instead of half and half.  tried the splenda stuff, didn't like it too much.  i felt myself catching cancer from it.  she's making me drink water.  she said that i could start with one glass a day, but i found that since i'm eating 5 times a day, it doesn't cramp my stomach as much.  i'm on my third bottle.  the only other thing i have to do is add one yogurt and one whole fruit a day as my snacks. so hopefully, this thing will work... damn, if i have to give up my coffee, light and sweet... it better.

      i haven't been writing in 'ye ole blog' lately because i've had nothing fantastic to write about.  i've been going to doctors, and that's pretty much it.  i went to my regular physician, and it turns out that i do have acid-reflux.  so i can't have any caffine!!!  decaf sucks.  but i have no choice.  i can't have garlic or spicey foods.  and i have to lose at least 10 pounds.  the doctor told me that i'm fat.   well, not exactly, but i have a flair for the dramatic.  so today, i go to see my nutritionist/dietician for the first time.  this sucks.  i don't know how it's going to work either if i'm leaving on vacation for two weeks, next week. ...gotta join a gym.  maybe this weekend... gotta talk to dad.  he's gotta come too... moral support.  so wish me well... i may not make it!

      like the title says... there's not much to report.   my life is doctors now.  friday, i went to my rheumatologist and he prescribed me two new medications for my knee. today i have an appointment at 1:15pm with my regular physician to see if i have acid-reflux and possibly an ulcer. then no more doctors (hopefully) until september 3rd.  tomorrow, i have to drop my car off at 8am to check the transmission, heater core, and brakes.  and i have to try to pick it up as soon as possible because at 6:30pm i have an appointment in white plains at berkeley college.  sigh... it never ends.  so maybe tomorrow i'll have more stuff to write.
