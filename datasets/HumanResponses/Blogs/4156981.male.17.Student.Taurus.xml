      Hey all we are in the process of writing some new stuff so we won't have a show until September 24th at the Blue Moon in Neenah.  We also are ordering more shirts so if you'de like to buy one drop us a line.  We will have black and white tees and both have differant designs on them.  So buy some tees and CD's so we can record our new stuff on it... so you can buy that too...

        Andy definately hit it on the head  thank you to everyone who came out to our show.  It was a grand old time.  Now I just gotta get my ass into updating the website with new stuff, but Im hoping by the end of today I can put some more show info up on there.  Here is my (hopeful) plan of action today:   Go with Andrew to Appleton to get his cabs all cool.   Schedule another show at the Blue Moon   See if we cant schedule a show in Appleton too   Update the website   Workout      Thats my rockstar plan, ha.  Its just hard as hell to book out shows when you have no demo to give to a club owner.  The conversation gets pretty goofy, like,     Me:   Hey, my name is Joel from this band infinity theory...we've played a lot of places, have a lot of experience and would like to book a show at your establishment."    Owner:   Ok, well, do you have a demo?    Me:   Um, well, okay I have this old one but it sounds nothing like what we sound like now and I dont have one with our new stuff to give you because we are broke off our asses and dont have the money to go record another one...unless you know of a studio that will like finance a recording?    Owner:   Get out of my coffeehouse.      So you can see from my hypothetical situation that I just spent too much time typing that the whole thing gets pretty hairy.  Long story short, send us as much money as you can so we can record, that way you will be able to hear us play live a lot more AND you will be able to have a CD to listen to us anytime!  I know this appeals to you, so in closing,  SEND INFINITY THEORY MONEY.

      Thanks to all the people who came out to our show tonight at Jefferson Park in Menasha.  You guys were great and we (infinity theory) had a damn good time.  Thanks to the Razor for the job they did organizing it and thank you to the Gwalls and Silik for putting on great performances as always.  Hopefully we will see you all at our next show.

        Tonight we have a show ..and I am excited.  Here is the shitty part, I cannot practice before that because I have to work at 2.  Fuckin a.  Well, Ill um practice at work, Im sure they wont mind, right?  Well, we just went over what to bring with Andrew, and on my bike ride this morning I was able to ponder my plan of attack for this show.  You know, outfits and stuff.  Tee hee.  Shut the fuck up.  I know you are thinking it.  Either way, I plan on enjoying myself, because the one of the only places I feel at home is up on that stage, playing my heart out.  Come see my soul tonight at Jefferson park, it will only cost 2 dollars.

       Today me and Andrew, well, Andrew and I, ran some T-shirts down to Fond Du Lac...and then we had band practice.  After that, nothing interesting happened.  Well, Andy pet a dolphin.  Thats it though.  So Im going to admit that Im pretty jacked up about this show still, and I found out today that I get off work an hour early (Lucky me) to go.  Im glad that the people at this job understand, unlike the wench whore at my old job.  Damn bitch.  Ok, now that Ive gotten that out of my system would you like to know our set list?  To bad!  Its a big naughty secret, like those dirty magazines you hide underneath your bed that you read and think nobody knows about but your dad looks at them too.  Its late right now, and I just wanted to keep this thing updated, you know, for the fans...And then many we will have soon.         WE ARE GOING TO TAKE OVER.

       so okay, Im gonna be honest and say that this blog shit is pretty new to me...we will see how well I go about pouring my thoughts into an online diary about the band.  Ill start with the show, I like shows.  And Im excited about this one.  The people at Youth Go say that a lot of people go to this thing.  That will be good, its gonna be nice to play in front of people we dont know, because its nice to play for your friends, but the name of the game is getting stuff out there.  Frankly, it would be nice to hike on out of Oshkosh for a while and play shows wherever, but you gotta build, and refine, build and refine before you can take the show out to take a shot...I just wish it didnt take so damn long.  I want that new corvette now.
