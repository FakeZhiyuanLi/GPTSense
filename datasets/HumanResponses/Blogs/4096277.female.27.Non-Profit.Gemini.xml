       urlLink Race Walking  is an official Olympic sport. I have to agree that it takes strength and endurance to walk 20 or 50 km. However, how do they determine if a competitor is "walking" or "running"?? I am sure, as in all great decisions, long ago, in a land far, far, far away, a committee was formed. This committee was made up of people who wanted power and influence over the rest of us. They came up with the rules for race walking. I have not been able to locate the official rules for race walking, so if anyone out there has access to this top secret document, I would be interested in seeing what race walking is, officially.

       urlLink Mom Jailed for Smoking  I am sure there are some people out there who think that it is lame that a court ordered a woman to stop smoking around her children. I have to agree that it is a violation of her rights. But, if the court ordered it and she  knew  she would lose her kids if she continued to smoke  in front of them , couldn't she hold the urge a bit instead of creating a plastic bubble in her suburban to enable her smoking habit? ABC created one of those great graphics (much like they do for really big news stories) that showed how this woman "sealed" off her car.  In addition to her children being turned over to her ex-husband. The woman was sentenced to ten days in jail. i wonder if she'll quit when she gets out or if she will continue to smoke to make a statement against the ruling she says violates her rights.  I guess it is what is important to you. Nicotine or your children.

       urlLink Power Nap Sleep 3 hours in 20 Minutes : Hmmmm....I wonder if this works. Listen to a CD and feel better? Sounds fishy to me. But, I am exhausted. I really need a power nap. It is only $9.99. I'll put it on my christmas list. My day began early. Too early. We are moving offices from one floor to another. I went to the store and picked up a rug doctor to be collectively shared by my department. Why did I have to pick it up, you ask. I always seem to volunteer myself for these sorts of things. I think my co-workers are becoming co-dependents. There is all kinds of suggestions that we should all "chip" in to get pizza for lunch tomorrow. I have resisted the urge to say, "I'll do it!" I always make the arrangements and there always seems to be a few people who DO NOT PAY ME. In fact, my co-worker who keeps hounding me about cleaning her carpet (and waiting her turn) is the one person who has not paid me her share of the cooperative carpet deal. And, for anyone out there worried that I am doing this blog on work time, I am on a federally mandated lunch break right now. I must blog or I will crawl into bed and go to sleeep. It has happened before when I have been home for lunch.  See? I need to get that Power Nap CD. 20 minutes I would be good to go.

       urlLink Bag Borrow or Steal   is a website I fell upon today. You basically get to rent designer bags for a monthly fee. Then, you also have an option to buy. I may do it in the future, but not right now. The low-end deal is $19.95 a month, but if you want the real designer labels you pay $49.95 per month. Not sure that I go enough places in Lincoln, Nebraska where a designer label packs a lot of punch. I'll just stick to Isacc Mizrahi creations at  urlLink Target. .

       urlLink ALIEN vs. PREDATOR  wasn't so bad. I have not seen any of the ALIEN or PREDATOR movies, but I was still able to enjoy the movie. Yes, it is gory...But, it's okay. And, it probably won't be up for an oscar. But, can't we all admit that if the only movies we saw were oscar nominees, we would be pretty bored?? Next week I am going to go see  urlLink Exorcist: The Beginning . I hope it scares me - the other Exorcist movies really freak me out even though I am a Lutheran!

       urlLink Ted Kooser of Nebraska Named Poet Laureate of United States  - How cool that a fellow Nebraskan received this honor! He is also a good suporter of the foundation that I work for. This is great news. On the flip side, I am going to see  urlLink Alien vs. Predator  this evening. It isn't a movie I really want to see, but sometimes you can be surprised. I am sure the script writing will not be comparable to the poetry of Ted Kooser.

      My office mates have been moaning that I don't work as hard as they do, so I decided to become the first person in the office each day to make a statement, which required me to get out of bed a half hour earlier this morning.  My miniature schnauzer trumped me and just stayed in bed. I would walk in the bedroom and she would look up at me with her cute puppy eyes and seem to say, "Ha, you foolish human. I am a dog and I get to be lazy."  It did pay off. It was 7:54 a.m. as I walked into the building. And, I was the first person here. For all they know, I could have been here at 7:30 a.m.! My plan is going to work perfectly. Background information: I work for a a large institution (not-for-profit) that is going through a series of lay offs so everyone acts as a watchdog for Human Resources so they can get your name to be next on the list instead of theirs, even though the process doesn't work that way...

       urlLink TRIO: pop, culture, tv.  recently re-broadcast  urlLink Reality Bites  and I am catching up on what my  urlLink TiVo  has been saving for me. Not everyone knows that reality television got its start back years ago by PBS. However, this movie reignited something and shortly after, we got the first installment of  urlLink The Real World  from MTV. I know that not everyone likes Reality TV, but for someone who lives by themselves with no one but a dog to converse with or a neighbor that wants to sell you drugs...you get the idea. The point is, I know it really isn't reality. Can reality really be captured when people know that a camera is watching?? You start from the beginning, the casting. How can you cast reality? I prefer not casting the people that I cross paths with on a daily basis. An exisential question for everyone to ponder while you lie awake at night staring at the ceiling wondering about the neighbor who asked you if you do drugs...I really should have asked HIM if he does drugs. On another note, the cops had the street closed off for hours due to a car accident.

      I get home from a girls night out with Nicole and there are cops everywhere!!  In other news....my neighbor, Jose, helped me attempt to open my kitchen window this evening. He has great conversation skills and asks me, "So, do you do drugs?" WHAT? It isn't like we are close. I am not sure if this was exercise in sales skills or if he thought that I did do drugs because the current state of my duplex does smell what meth labs are supposed to smell like (they are refinishing the wood floors next door).  Jose either a) talked to the IS folks at work and they told him they thought I was high b) wants to make a new friend and find a new location to do his own drugs because the wife won't let him at his house or c) he just thought it was a good idea.... If the smell in this place doesn't get better soon, I will be high.

       urlLink Esprit US eshop  is finally back!!! This used to be the first stop for me when I needed shopping therapy. They took it down for more than a year. I am so glad it is back. Better go there soon or there will be no handbags left.

       urlLink Google Me This : Article on Public Radio website about how great a tool Google is...I have a confession to make. In my spare time, I "google" people from my past, college, high school, old political contacts to see...where they are now. I have found quite a few people. Maybe someone will find me and someone will finally start reading my blog. Probably just wishful thinking.

      Not as bad as someone telling me, "You look tired..." But, what about those people who walk by and say, "Good Morning, How are you?" but never stop walking to hear the answer. Either there are strange habits being formed in the human race or there is a growing race of human psychics. I would really love for the psychic type to stop and tell me how I feel because I am not sure if "good" is actually my answer or my habit. Maybe a psychic will tell me that I feel tired.

      Don't you hate it when the first thing you hear at work in the morning is, "You look tired!" I do?? Gee, I was feeling pretty good this morning until you said that. What compliment can I give you in return for that bright ray of sunshine? However, if I choose to let this bother me, then I probaby AM tired. But, I am only hostile now because instead of staying up late and finishing a book I am reading, I put it down and went to bed....regrets - the spice of life.

       urlLink The Ashlee Simpson Show  - This show is great. My TiVo started recording it for me because I let it do what it wants...Anyhow, after a long day of work and after dealing with the reality of my own life. I like to turn on the television and see that there are people out there who get to have fun on a daily basis. Anybody else feel that way?

      Wow...okay since I am the only one who will probably read this for now. This is the first post of my new blog. I have wanted to do this for a while. The title is Duplex Living Made Easy.....Because I live in a duplex. I like it except for right now because the other side is having the woodfloors finished right now. So here I am watching Newlyweds: Nick &amp; Jessica and kind of getting high on the fumes. I will go to sleep at the 'rents house so that I am able to function for work tomorrow. But I cherish the day that I am able to return to my lovely little duplex and sleep in my own bed. Afterall, I am paying rent for this place.
