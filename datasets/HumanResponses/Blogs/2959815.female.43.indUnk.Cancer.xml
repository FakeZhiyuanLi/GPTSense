      March 21, 2003 ? cigs ? lbs  Barry initiated a "talk" last night, about our relationship.  He tried to deny that he used our marital problems as an excuse to his ex wife not to do something.I still don't he understood why i was so upset about that.  I feel stalemated.  And he comes home from work all happy and cheerful as if the discussion had never taken place.   Had a nice chat with Sue, my kid's former babysitter.  She wants to have another baby next summer.  Nice.   Been off all week from work-nice to have a break.  I needed it, if only for my mental health.

      March 27, 2004  Arrrrrrgh.  Just found out a couple of days ago Judy wants Kayla to move back in with us as she is out of control, her words.  Apparently she isn't around much, and was caught smoking pot in the house.  Can't see it happening-her job is in Brampton, her school, her boyfriend, her life.  Judy is the same woman who said that the same kid at the age of 13 who could make her own decisions. I am so up to here with this crap. On a more pleasant note-Alicia loved her birthday present-The Sims Double Deluxe.  Dyllion's birthday is today, and as usual she is holding her birthday party for him at her house, so we won't see him til later today. Also, got the WINNT cd, so I got the cdplayer working on Robin's computer. At least now she can listen to cd's on the headphones.

      March 23, 2004 Too many cigarettes Too much coffee 172lbs  Finished the last of the 3 spells.  hope it starts to work.  Spoke to Angie for 2 hours on the phone-sounds happy, 24 weeks pregnant now.  Julie wants Vicky to go to California so wants dates to plan air flights.  2 birthdays this week-Dyllion 10, Alicia 17.  Got Alicia the Sims Double Deluxe, Dyllion Age of Empires II.  Finished Robin's computer, just need to install soundcard and reinstall WINNT.  Also have to find a printer driver for the Panasonic KX-P2023 for WINNT.  Speakers, too. Easter is coming.  Which means DST;  longer days.  Got to decide on Easter dinner and gifts for the kids. Mood has slightly stabelized in the last 2 days-maybe things are going to get better, now.

      March 18, 2004 175lb 18 cigarettes too much coffee  Regrets, I have had a few.   First one ever had to be when I was 10 and had to decide whether to live with my mom or dad.  2-Staying with David so long. (3 years!) 3- marrying my first husband 4- marry my 2nd husband 5-not going into computer science 6- actually encouraging Julie to move to California 7- actually encouraging Dale to move to BC 8- almost every time I open my mouth Notice one thing though.  Even if things change my mood remains the same. Thanks to Murray for letting me work on the computers he rescued from the garbage at work.  Very interesting, and successful.  Bid on ebay for a soundcard and WINNT.  No money again this week, but still taking kids to Upper Canada Mall. Barry mocked me on weekend-I asked why he had done something a certain way-he said-I am so stupid, quite sarcastically.   Busy 2 days off, back to work tomorrow for 2-12's and a 8.  Days at least.

      March 9, 2004 Sat. cigs-15 Sun. cigs-16 Mon. cigs- a lot Coffee -way too much 1 single serving chocolate bar  Haven't written a lot since Thursday, though on Friday I wrote a little blurb, don't remember what-since it didn't upload.  Had Barry's kids, 2 of them with their boyfriends, for supper-it went well I have to admit.  Served chicken with stuffing, 2 vegetables, mashed potatoes, rolls, homemade white cake with cream cheese icing.  Interestingly, my girls didn't socialize much with them. I find Barry and his take up a lot of psychic room, edging me and mine out. Feeling kind of drained today.  Finances kind of low, $39 in the bank-payday on Thursday. Tired of being shy, too.  I thought I would outgrow this by this age, I guess not.

      March 5, 2004 16 cigarettes  Raining out. Suppose to rain all weekend.  Off to work today.  Workdays like this I don't have time to write as I work 12 hour shifts-all weekend.  Forgot to weigh myself.  Spoke with mom, Mike, and Julie.  2 of those 3 people backs are out. Gotta have a dinner party with Christina, Kayla, and their assorted menfriends Monday.  Menu so far is roast stuffed chicken.  Appropriate.

      March 4, 2004  12:30pm 5 coffees 2 loads laundry(sheets) TV-  Dead Like Me , Kingdom Hospital, Slings and Arrows  Ah, family.  Connotations of the Waltons, the Cosbies, Brady Bunch, Partridge Family.  Where families work together to solve crises.  The reality can be different, surreal.  Real families have crises most of the time, occasionally bringing out the best in each other.  Anyone who says differently is a Pollyannic fool. Then there are those of us who make their life more difficult by thinking how difficult can this be?  And looking at the problems square right on and still thinking that.  This is called Denial.   My middle name, apparently. I blame myself, first for denial of the problems I would face.  This is rooted in the family I grew up in, where male bad behaviour and obedience to the same ruled.  Women forgave much, expected little.  My parents divorced when I was 11, both remarrying within the year.  I was originally in my father's custody-but he could not handle being a single parent, so I was sent back to my mother, who really found the 3 of us an unpleasant reminder of the past.  We all left home around the age of 16-the atmosphere was emotionally abusive.  I put myself through high school and college by holding down part-time jobs and student loans through college.  I married for the first time at the age of 24. So I meet my 2nd husband in 1998, after being on my own sucessfully for 2 years, I own my townhouse, have savings, RRSP's, nice standard of living for me and 3 girls.  We fall in love, he proposes to me within 3 weeks-I accept-1st mistake.  We move in together after 10 weeks-2nd mistake.  I already know that 3 of 4 of children aren't biological his, and he supports them. History of his first marriage. Meets wife in 1986.  She already has 2 children, girl and boy, born 1982 and 1984.  Wife is 23 when they meet, he 34.  Father of 1st child is dead, she doesn't know who the father is of the 2nd child.  Never married, she lives with her parents.  My husband acts as father to these 2.  His biological child, a girl,is born in 1988.  Problems occur in the marriage, and he separates from her several times.  The second last time, she gets pregnant -4 men are possible fathers, none of which is my husband.  Child #4 is born in 1994, a boy, whom my husband raises as her own.  They split up for good in 1997. His exwife gets pregnant again with child #5, a girl.   Fortunately, at this point, he only pays support for his girl. At the point when we were living together-I notice things.  Like how he doesn't discipline his kids when he should be, like how the oldest stepfather only wants him when she wants money, how the sons are both afflicted with ADHD, how manipulative and cruel his biological daughter is to my daughters, and how they get privileges my kids don't get.  His oldest stepdaughter even calls us trailer trash behind our backs, while asking for money at the same time.  My oldest girl goes to live with her father when my husband's behavior ,favouritism, and antics of his "kids" get to be too much.  He decides his oldest stepson should live with us, ADHD, and all.  He threatens to kill his mother-so he comes to live us-i don't disagree because that would seem uncompassionate.  Denial again .  During all this we get married.  Went well, except when he let aforementioned stepson get drunk at the wedding party(he's just 15) causing embarrasment to me.  My husband's best friend is Leslie, a woman.  She is also best man at our wedding.  Would you believe she stayed at our house on our wedding night because he wouldn't find a way to send her home?  Our honeymoon consisted of a 3 week trip out west with 5 kids 5-12yrs of age.  my 3, 2 of his.  In an RV that sleeps 6.  The 5 yr old boy is a bedwetter, ruins all the beds.  the girls don't want to sleep with him, plus he is whiny and always asking for money.  The boy even accused one of my girls of hitting him when I was right there, and his "father" took his side.  Denial.  Ken the oldest lived with us for a year, worst year of my life.  First thing he did was refuse to take his Ritalin.  Then he started skipping school, staying til hours of the night disturbing everyone with his temper tantrums, hogging TV, phone, and computer, often all at the same time.  Then he faked being sick, alienating my family doctor who refused to treat him until he got some counselling.  He faked being delusional with the psychiatrist.  When he said he planned to kill my husband, he went back to his mother's.  Kayla, his daughter.  Created trouble by asking continually for things we couldn't afford, faking sick so she wouldn't have to go to school, special privileges lika a TV in her room so she would be one up on my kids, away most evenings with friends in her former community rather than making friends in her new one.  Not disciplined by her father as he was pathological afraid of losing her-so disciplining fell to me.  Went to live at her mother's 2 years ago, came back a month later, crying about how never sees her mother. We take her back, buy $200 back to school clothes and supplies, and she moves back with her mother 5 days later. Christina, wanted to live with us-but was involved in a live-in relationship with her boyfriend who saw her only as a friend, still saw other women, and didn't pay his end of things.  He would beat her when she objected to him seeing other women.  There was no way I wanted this man in our house around the children when things got violent.  My husband had the nerve to ask me in front of her if she could live with us-I told him in private to never do that to me again as it makes me look like the bad guy if I say NO. Dyllion.  ADHD again.  Here every other weekend, still wets the bed, plays computer games morning to night, violent ones.  Still whiny and acts much younger than he really is, like 6.  I have told my husband that this kid will never live with us, ever.  He is my husband's stepchild from another marriage; the biological ones take priority.  As my husband works half the weekend, I have to deal with him.  Something is not right with this picture,  and I am getting madder by the minute, feel it in my shoulders.

      March 4, 2004  9am EST Weight 172.5 Cigarettes 16 1 large Jersey Milk Almond Bar  Like Bridget Jones I plan to keep track of my vices in order to deal with them. So I start with some resolutions-obviously must get down to my ideal weight-150 lbs.  I am large-boned, and I would feel and look sick even at 140 lbs.   Must stop smoking-stupid, expensive habit, potentially lethal at some point. Trying to decide what diet to try-have done Weight Loss Clinic, Slimfast, Atkins, Blood Type in the past.  Slimfast worked the best, lost 25lbs in 3 months, but that was 10 years ago, after the birth of my third daughter. As for smoking, think I will try the patch again.  Zyban turns me into a maniac, so that is not an option.  I work as Registered Nurse in a Postpartum/Antepartum/Special Care Nursery unit in a small "suburban" hospital in a large city.  This place would be a good example of how not to run a hospital.   After 22 years as an RN I am still trying to find a style of working that does not put me at odds with co-workers, doctors, or managers.  At least my patients appreciate me-I guess that is the important thing. Have not had much luck with friends-lost my last friend, Laurel, whom have known since I was 12, last year finally to her worsening schizophrenia.  She  threatened to call the police on my husband's stepdaughter who was housesitting for us while we were on vacation-said nasty insulting things to her about her past relationships-some pretty accurate, though I didn't tell her those things because of her illness.  Anyway, when we got back I confronted  Laurel with this and asked her for an explanation about the phone call-she still didn't believe it was Christina she spoke to.  I told how much trouble I was in because of this phone call, and that she needed to be back on medication.  She hung up on me and I haven't spoken to her since.  So now I have no friends outside of work, or my husband's friends. Thank God I have a sister, Angie, 2 years younger than me who I talk to several times a week, but she lives on the other side of the country.  Julie, 1 year younger lives further south on the West Coast.  I have 2 younger half brothers, 11 and 21 years youngers respectively who also live out west, along with my mother and stepfather.  My dad and stepmother live 4 hours north of me and I don't have much contact with them. I am married for the second time and it is worse than my first marriage.  Talk about poor choices I make! Some background.  Married 1st husband as thought he was good husband and father material-fell out of love quickly once found out how miserly and was trying to remake me in to June Cleaver with a paycheck.  Had 3 daughters with him anyways.  He is remarried, and apparently hasn't tried the June Cleaver thing with his 2nd wife.  We divorced in 1996, after 11 years of marriage-girls are now 17, 15, 12.  The older one lives with him, the 2 younger with me.    2nd husband is 11 years older than me.  History of drug abuse, alcoholism in his 20's which he overcame.  Criminal record(I only knew of 1 charge when I married him) and debts of which he claimed he didn't have any. Exhibit 1.  Criminal record came to light when applied for a new trucking job (I saw the hard copy)  3 drug charges, 2 fraud in his twenties, plus the conviction and jail sentence about which I already knew.  Did not know about the $500,000 judgement against him until we went to buy a house together-he claims I told him-but I am sure I would have remembered that as I am paranoid about debt.  Turns out it was waived long ago but he just nevered bothered to find out until now.How can you not know whether or not you owe  someone that kind of money?  He didn't check it out until I had a separation agreement drawn up to protect my equity. Exhibit 2  I had no debts before I met him  in 1998.  I had $90,000 equity and RRSP's, and savings.  The savings are gone.    Within a week of our living together he had no money for car insurance-$1200 for 6 months for a clunker as a result of a traffic violation-paid by me.  Then he wanted his 16 year old stepdaughter on his insurance-and she doesn't even live with us-put my foot  down and said no.  His alcoholic sister and brother-in-law figures he has money now-owes them $2000-paid.  He figures he needs a new vehicle-we buy a van-$4000, which promptly needs a new tranny-$3900.  He needs this van so his stepdaughter can have the car-she doesn't like the car and it goes to the dump after a a couple of months.  1 year later, he decides he needs another vehicle-buys a pickup truck-hardly practical for our large family-$7500. City sends bill 2 old bills for hydro-$475 from 1994.  Wait!  Not finished yet. 1 year later gets rid of pickup-buys another van-$8000.  Last year, bought yet another van for $2500.  Last month, 2 traffic violations tickets from 1992 which he claims he paid for twice-$350.  I am so tired of this.  Next-Family Life. I got to take a break.

      April 20, 2004  Nothing much has happened.   I passed my BCLS, CPR to you, yesterday.  Now I have to corporate Mock Code to do, which I have to pass or else I will be suspended.  Things are going well with Angie, they are in BC looking at the PMQ they are going to live in, come August.  Using a new browser called MyIE2.  I like it, a lot.  Murray ended up taking Robin's computer, the one of the ones he resceued from the garbage.  So I got her a 733mH Pent 111 with 17" monitor from a ebay merchant named goodasnewcomputers.  I have dealt with them before, they are pretty good.  The computers runs WIN98SE perfectly, and it has a soundcard, CDROM, and 15g HD, 128 mg memory, nice speakers.  $300 CA.  I am off all week again, because I am taking lieu time on Wednesday and Thursday.

      Thursday, May 27, 2004 170lbs!  Been sick with some head cold/sinus/bronchitis thing since last Thursday.  Therefore, been off work since Tuesday morning-sent home, in fact.  Wondering if I should call in sick tomorrow.  Probably will.  Thinking of installing Linux again, this time Mandrake 10, ordered it from Ebay last night.  How in the world do you create a bootable CD?  Followed the instructions, (for burning it) and it doesn't work, even though the computer is set to boot from cd.  Wonder if a CDR would work better than a CDRW.  Or is it the XP Pro?  Damn Microserf anyways.  Even tried a bootable floppy but the file is too big for the floppy.  What is rawrite?  Too many questions-got to do some research.

      May 19, 2004 174lbs  Didn't go too bad yesterday.  Richard, Julie's husband was friendlier than usual, but still has to be bigger and better than everybody else.  Julie was kind of cool.  Jocelyn was fun.  The daughters were well behaved.  Work today and tomorrow, start of new schedule.

      Tuesday, May 18, 2004 172 lbs Still smoking  Been dieting the last week.  Lost 6 lbs, using South Beach on days off, and low calorie at work, less thinking that way, and effective.  Work sucks, no other word for it.  Big kerfluffle over cancelling staff, union is now involved, and I will probably look like a idiot by the time it is finished.   The kits are getting bigger, playfight with each other all the time.  Going to try to post a picture. California Julie was supposed to show up with her husband and my 4 yr old niece yesterday, but it was changed to today. Menu  Hamburgers Turkey Burgers Macaroni Salad Green Salad Nanaimo Bars(my homemade, best around) Cherry Cheesecake(also homemade)  Bought badminton set for kids, bubble soap and wand for the niece.  Was calm for a while about marital situation, but now starting to simmer.

      Wednesday, June 16, 2004 165lbs  Well, it is nice being at this weight again.  Another 10-15lbs to go. Next planned off-diet day is my birthday June 22.   Barry got quite upset Monday when he saw that it was 8 days I was going out west for.  I did tell him it would be for a few days subject to flight availability and cost.  Now he is mad that he won't have holidays with me, even though my vacation is subject to workplace seniority, of which I don't have enough of.  Also acuused ME of dishonesty regarding same.  Worse thing he could have done.  I suggested we should live apart for a while. Tuesday comes, and he is acting all affectionate as if nothing has happened.  He had this family reunion thing he wanted to go to in Nevada, which we couldn't have afforded too-that was the deal with putting the trailer on a site-one or the other-we chose the trailer.  He must think I am made of money.  Nevada-hmm-airfare- about $1000, hotel-$520, food-$200, family reunion activites $250, car rental $200.  For 4 days, for something i am sure I won't enjoy, and I don't know anyone.  For me, under $800, I hope.

      168lbs  Had to rewrite this, didn't publish 1st time.  Scheduled off-diet day came and went, up 2 pounds.   Julie might be moving to California of all places, seems she thinks California is too much "keeping up with the Jones's".  Expensive, I THINK she means, or dangerous.   Feeling better today, still mad at Dad, though.

      166lbs  Today I am greiving, no matter how pretentious that sounds.  My Aunt Helen died on Saturday, and my father didn't even tell me.  The funeral was yesterday in St. Catherine's, just a 2 hour drive. And I didn't find out until today.  Had my own little wake though- coffee, bagel and old time bluegrass and gospel-Carter family, which I know the family liked at one time-Church in the Wildwood, Will the Circle be Unbroken.  Had a good cry.  Still mad at Dad, though.  In honor of Aunt Helen I uploaded a photo which also has my dad in it along with the aunts.  Know how I found out?  Angie sent me an email.  And this is the anniversary of the Beth, her baby's death.       Oh, there were little clues this was going to happen-met someone from St Catharine's, my unexplained withdrawal(dissociation)  from life the past few days.  Don't believe in coincidence!   Oh, today is my scheduled day off my diet.  Hurray!  Mandarin or Tucker's Marketplace tonight!

      June 3, 2004 168lbs  Well, I crashed the main computer again, necessitating a visit to my local computer geek, another $125 lost to reformat and reinstall windows.  I like Linux, really do, but it sure screws up Windows with LILO.  Grub is only slightly better.  Used Mandrake 10.0, this time, and I have to say I like Suse 8.2 PRO better.  Knoppix 3.4 is actually pretty darn good, and it doesn't save anything to the hard drive, runs off the cd.  I'm typing this on the computer at work.   Slowly I am recovering from the head/cold/sinus thing I had last week.  Just a little chest congestion, a little cough. Angie is now 34 weeks pregnant, doing fine, just somewhat obsessive with little things. I was hoping that I would get the computer back today so I can work on it all day tomorrow.  Lokks like that might not happen, as they haven't called back to say that it is ready for pickup. Probably we will go to the trailer again this weekend, forcast says it will be nice weather for the weekend. I would like to get more pictures for the blog-but that is at the bottom of a long list of things I must do to get the computer useable again.  At least, this time, I made a backup to the 2nd hard drive, but I wish I had backed up to cd instead.

      Monday, July 5, 2004 165lbs!  OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.  Nice weekend in Ottawa-hotel room was small, but ok.  Had to pay $14 parking every night.  Saw Parliament Buildings, Sparks Street, Rideau Canal boat ride(some very rude people on that), Rideau Hall,  Changing of the Guard, Museum of Civilization.  Tried to see the RCMP Musical Ride but they were on tour.  Missed the Haunted Ottawa Walking Tour, for a good reason.  All the attractions were several blocks from the hotel, very tiring for anybody.  Unfortunately, I was very constipated and gaseous-made the strategic mistake of "forcing" things to happen-instead what happened was a thrombosed hemorrhoid-neglected for 2 days as I thought it was just an extremely painful hemorrhoid.  Should have been lanced the first day, was too late, today, other than to treat it according to symptoms.  As a result, I can't sleep, can't sit, can't ly down, can't walk for long. California Julie called-thinks I should be pro active about getting Alicia on birth control.  I disagreed-I have given her all the information she needs, and if she can't talk to me about she can talk to other people like her Aunt Julie. Angie is still pregnant, due on the 15th.  Having prelabor symptoms.

      July 1, 2004 160 lbs  Wow. Finally got down this far, and now I am going away for the weekend.  Going to Ottawa, me and Barry, without the kids.   2weeks ago he did the extraordinary thing of withdrawing $4000 from his RRSP and paying off the bulk of our debts.  Guess I will have to try to get along for a while.  Ottawa should be nice, though.  See the museums, the Rideau Canal, Aboriginal activities, Parliament Buildings, RCMP Horse Dance, etc.

      I had an idea while out west.  Found some citronella bug soap in a soap shop in Bragg Creek last week.  Decided I would make soap.  So I did.  8lbs of it, made of coconut oil, lard, olive oil, water and lye.  It seems to have actually turned out.  I used Gardenia fragrance, left some fragranceless, for Barry.  Alicia, Victoria, Victoria's friend Jessica, Robin, Dyllion have claimed pieces and carved their initials in it.  With the leftover pieces(and I had quite a bit) i plan to recraft it and colorize it. Turns out I can also make lipbalm,  solid handcream, shampoo, and conditioner.  Citronella Shampoo and Conditioner anyone?

      Well, so much to tell.  I went out west to visit and be with Angie and Greg when they gave birth. Mom and I managed to get to the mountains for a couple of days.  We drove to Canmore, via Banff.  I had an encounter with a decorative stone on Banff Avenue that left both shins scraped and bruised and the digital camera inoperative.  The camera gave its life to protect my wrists.  I am lucky no bones were broken.  Canmore is a nice town, I'd live there.  Stayed the night at Howard Johnsons-nice, clean room.  Went to Craig's Hideaway for supper-not good.  Charged $12.99 for a small piece chicken teriyaki, reheated frozen vegetables, and french fries.  Waitress looked like she was on a bender, or about to go on one.  Half a star out of five. Returned To Edmonton Saturday late in the afternoon only to find out Angie had been in the hospital, because the baby hadn't moved for several hours-baby moved as soon as the monitor was put on, but there were a couple of dips in her heartrate that were attributed to machine problems.  Rest of Saturday Angie had mild contractions sometimes close together, sometimes far apart.  All Sunday too until her water broke at 4pm.  Then the labour pains started up fast and furious.  Got her to the hospital and the nurses decided after one look at her she was a keeper.  Things went well until just after 6pm-but Angie was getting quite distressed with the pains.  Nurse checks her, and she is 4-5cmm dilated, with an accompanying dip in fetal heart rate The nurse turned to her right side, then her left, gave her oxygen, but baby wasn't recovering. About a minute after that the heart rate returned to normal.  Epidural put in, Angie much happier, but baby not.  At about 7:45pm decision is made for a c-section-so, on July 18, 2004, at 8:22pm 8.5 llbs, Emily Grace  is born screaming into the world, with Greg present, also HIS birthday.  Spent the rest of the week helping Angie to breastfeed, trying to explain to them how breastfeeding works, normal recovery process, etc.  She was so swollen from the waist down from extra water that she weighed the same as when she went into the hospital.  She has now lost 15lbs, so she is happier. Emily Grace, of course, is the most beautiful baby ever, next to my 3 girls.
