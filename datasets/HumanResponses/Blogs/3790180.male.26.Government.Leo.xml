      My beautiful fiancé was pregnant with our first child her hand in mine gripping tightly that which she would soon have to let go. We arrived at the airport in a kind of quite expectation of the heartache ahead. I smiled deepely at her and gave the biggest bear hug I could to my soon to step-daughter. I shook my brothers hand as he looked at me saying with his eyes the words that need not even be said;I hate to see you go. I have seen this look before but never as strong and piercing as it was multiplied by the new members of my family. I took one last look , one last smile goodbye , one last I will see you soon kiss and turned for the gate resolute not to look back because I would break down then and there if I did. As I faded from their sight I felt my heart ripping from within me and a solemn tear streamed slowly down my cheek. I half laughed at the realization that this was the first tear of many that no one was there to wipe away. Bording the DC 10 bound for war I shrunk into my seat and thouhgt of all that was left behind and all that lay ahead. I arrived on 18 July 2003 to 120 degree heat and war over the horizon. This was my first trip outside the United States and to my surprise life is not much different anywhere you go. There will be new languages, different skin tones and new customs and traditions. Although for the most part everything is the same. There are still worries, annoyances, challenges to take on and friends to be made. I thought that I would change or be different after these past 15 months and in some ways I am or have. Mostly I am just the same old me. I am married and have two children now as opposed to when I left; so that is a major change. Other than living for myself I now I live for my family. That is good for me because I never cared much for myself; at least not as much as I care for them. I will be returning home soon. I have been away from home for a while now and at times I forget how much I love it there. The familiarity of places and people always seem to make me feel welcome. I often times say that I miss home. I miss the things that I can remember. Many of the small joys that my home offers me are long forgotten somewhere between the lines. I try to at times imagine myself there. But like I said I am almost home. My imagination can fail me now because soon I will have the first hug from my daughter that I have ever felt. I will have the long awaited embrace of my wifes’ arms wrapped tightly around me. I will be dragging my step-daughter around the terminal because she will not "let go of my leg." I will get to drink a cold one with my brother while the steaks are steaming on the grill . I will get to go to church with my mother. I will get to sit in the shop with my dad and listen the old man ramble on. I will get to see my grandmother again. I will, I will , I will soon be home.

      Swiftly I turned the corner and entered to an obstructed view of the labor and delivery room. A doctor was gently removing the legs of my fiancé from the stirrups. Sweat was clinging to her brow as pain covered her expression.  I recalled our first hours in this room and the many contractions that were labored through here. I asked myself why there were many more people in here now as then. What had started out to be a quiet and peaceful place had turned to a frenzy of people, machines, and pale green gowns darting from here to there in the few minutes of my absence. People were everywhere; nurses grabbing at this, tucking at that while the doctors close by removed their surgical clothes. My mind raced at the realization of what actually was happening here.  I could somewhat here my fiancé’s mother telling me to come over and look at my daughter. Time stood still upon seeing her cradled in my fiances arms; tears streaming down her cheeks, a look of total exhilaration painted her face.  The silence in the room was deafening as I glanced down at the most beautiful creation ever made. I was instantly stunned. Words cannot express the amount of love welling inside of me for my daughter Taylor. She was as small a person as I’d ever seen, her forehead wrinkled and her tiny hands gripped my finger tightly. Deep dark eyes shot through my very being as they stared intently at me through the liquid applied to them at birth.  I knew she was the most beautiful baby I’d ever seen; and how could she not be? She was made in the image my fiancé and I; in that instance I knew what a wonderful life God had given to me. I looked upward into Jennifer’s eyes and could see the bond between her and Taylor already formed as it had been from the day of her conception. The utter joy of the moment was overwhelming and total body numbness had already started to set in as the nervous shaking of my hand brought my attention back to the moment. Never have I felt the exposure of my heart to another as it now was. Trying to explain this feeling is almost useless because words hold not the weight of meaning to wrap around these emotions.  My very soul has been changed. I now understand the love of a parent. What is it that makes one gladly lay down their life for another; the love of a parent. My selfishness washing away as I held her in my arms, the only thought I could render was how could this be, why was she given to me? It is not enough to say that I am blessed; I am captivated by the affection I have for her. I am in awe of her every breath, of her very being.

      Drive On Lyrics by Johnny Cash  I got a friend named Whiskey Sam  He was my boonierat buddy for a year in Nam  He said is my country just a little off track  Took 'em twenty-five years to welcome me back But, it's better than not coming back at all  Many a good man  I saw fall And even now,  every time I dream I hear the men  and the monkeys in the jungle scream  Drive on, don't mean nothin'  My children love me, but they don't understand  And I got a woman who knows her man  Drive on, don't mean nothin', drive on  I remember one night,  Tex and me Rappelled in on a hot L.Z.  We had our 16's on rock and roll  But, with all that fire,  was scared and cold  We were crazy, we were wild  And I have seen the tiger smile  I spit in a bamboo viper's face  And I'd be dead, but by God's grace  Drive on, don't mean nothin'  My children love me, but they don't understand  And I got a woman who knows her man  Drive on, don't mean nothin', drive on  It was a real slow walk in a real sad rain  And nobody tried to be John Wayne  I came home, but Tex did not  And I can't talk about the hit he got  I got a little limp now when  I walk Got a little tremolo when  I talk But my letter read from Whiskey Sam  You're a walkin' talkin' miracle from Vietnam  Drive on, don't mean nothin'  My children love me, but they don't understand  And I got a woman who knows her man  Drive on, don't mean nothin', drive on
