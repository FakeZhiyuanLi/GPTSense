           Yesterday was one of the best days with Steve! I drove to his house and then left my car there so we could drive to the Seattle Science Center for the Brazilian Festival. It was just this tiny thing with traditional crafts and foods and then there was a stage set up with a few chairs in front. He bought me this really yummy soda (i forget what it's called...a weird porteguese name) i guess he used to drink it in the phillipines. But anyways then there was this band singing on the stage with a dancer in the front in traditional clothing. It was actually really good music i liked it! It was so fun because everyone that was there was mostly Brazilian so they were dancing up a storm practically everyone there was shimming their hips and jumping up and down and clapping. It was so alive. So we ended up being there like 4 hours just dancing and having a blast. Then since we had some time to kill and he knows I love Broadway we drove there and went to a little book store and just went around reading the funny books (since it was a quirky, whole-in-the-wall bookstore) It was just nice ya know? Nice and simple but so fun. I met his parents too that night. I have to admit that I was very very scared! I mean they are missionaries so i thought they would not like me in my little jean miniskirt and that they didnt like anything superficial and that they would be uptight and ah! It was just intimidating but they turned out to be actually really comfortable to me. I know that isn't usually a word used to describe people but that's how they made me feel I guess. So it all ended well and they goodnight kiss could have been my favorite part.

          In Cosmo this month...very cliche I know but Britney Murphy was on the cover and she said something in her interview that I found to be very good advice and I know I will definatly apply it to my day to day clothing choices..."She is sporting a butterfly motif tank top and has rhinestone flowers decorating her toes and a white silk blossom tucked behind one ear. But despite the carefree look she admits it;s a carefully crafted disquise. 'If I'm having a crummy day, I pick out clothes that look like how I want to feel,' she says in her trademark breathy voice. 'The flowers, the butterfly, they're...happy'" Isn't that great? I just thought it was an optimistic remark and very true. Okay...so the best thing to happen to me since water bottles with sports top lids??? Well  urlLink http://www.indie1031.fm/main.html  is a radio station online with all of my fav music. Literally I love all of it. Now seriously I was having this thought today...what if you date the guy you are supposed to marry too early? What if God meant for you to not be together until you were actually ready to have a relationship in which would last a much longer time. Cause if someone starts dating in lets say high school but they were actually supposed to start after college then they may have met too early and gotten sick of eachother. Can that happen? Just a random thought...

            Okay so I'm going to go back to last week and write a short little summary of my time in Canada at my friend Bryan's cabin aka Family Fort. It was so gorgeous and relaxing. I had not a care in the world there. It was right on the ocean and everyday we would walk down and go swimming in the clear blue ocean. And it literally was clear! I could see straight to the bottem. We played lots of pickle ball and Mere and I were super good! We made offical Wimbleton noices whenever we hit the ball. Unfortunatly one day we decided to go off roading in the golf cart and...my camera flew out somewhere and we lost it! Boo hoo because all these great pics were on it from the beginning of the trip. Towards the end of the trip we all went camping on this small island we took boats out too with all out tents and sleepover stuff including lots of fruit snacks! We slept in one big tent we had set up and he was very cozy! The night I laughed the most was the last night in which a few of the guys agreed for us girls to dress them up in our clothes! The pictures are pretty disturbing and great blackmail hehe. It was amazing how many shooting stars there were during the night. Everynight AJ and I just layed on the hammock and I eventually became jaded because there was probably a shooting star every 30 seconds...or less!
