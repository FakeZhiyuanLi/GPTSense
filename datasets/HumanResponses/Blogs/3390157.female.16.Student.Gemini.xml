               I never knew words could tear my heart into peices. Especially coming from my mom. Tonight she basically told me I'm fat, and getting fatter. That i also don't care about my appearance. I'm thinking about trying to be anorexic maybe just for alittle bit. just so i lose some weight, and then ill eat again. If i did that, everything would be better. I have alot of feelings inside that have never come out before. but for some reason they are tonight. I wonder if i became a cutter. would it feel better? would it take the pain away? I need to figure out where the pain is comming from. I still think it goes back to my past with my father.      It's kind of odd, ive never had suicidal thoughts before this. Would people miss me? would they ever notice if im gone? I'm pretty good at hiding whats going on, by staying busy, and trying to be perky and not down. and throwing myself into my music. I am really scared. I just realized im depressed, but i don't want people to know.  I know on one hand i shouldn't be depressed because i have a wonderful boyfriend, im good at playing piano and singing. But on the other hand, im fat, and getting fatter, I have been really sick, and stressed because of all the schoolwork and stuff. I still think if i lost weight, by becomming anorexic, and being a cutter or something, it would make me feel better and erase the pain from all the years.  do I need help? or is this just thoughts running through my head? i don't know are these thoughts that will develop into something? or are they just thoughts and writing is a way to get them out of my head? all i know is that words hurt, and go straight to the heart. You need to be careful about what and how you say things to people. Because like what my mom said to me tonight. I got suicidal thoughts in my head, and she doesn't even realize she did that.    If I wrote what i felt through music would people know what i was going through? would it be to obvious? or not? i don't know but that would help. I have lots of thinking to do. Anorexia, Cutting, Suicide? is it worth it ? to get rid of the pain?

       urlLink    I Hate make-up homework!  As you can tell  I'm stressing so bad! I have so much to do before school gets out. This year i've missed 65 days of school, because of being so sick. Now I only have  4 days left of school and still tons of homework. Its so stressful. On top of that I'm going to be gone this weekend; to my boyfriend's Graduation in Audubon. Plus next Tuesday, I have my very first piano recital. I have been playing for like 2 years, but i've gone through 7 levels of piano in 1 year. I'm very nervous for that. PLUS I also have Semester Finals next week! ahhh I just want to scream!      I've realized in this short amount of time of Using Blog, it's allowed me to collect myself, and my thoughts. I'll write more later. I have to do my Geometry and Biology.

        Ok. Well, It's a long story, but I have really bad asthma called steroid dependent asthma, which means I can't breathe without a medication that opens up my bronchial and lungs. But on the other hand, It's wrecking my kidneys. I also have to be on oxygen, and I'm really pale,with the darkest circles under my eyes that you could imagine.    I Have a really hard time with some people in my grade. Some of them are very ignorant, and think this is all an act to get attention. ( they are obviously not very close friends.) While others, are wonderful, always kind, and wanting to know how I am feeling. I don't know how to explain it. It's just nice to know you have people that care about you. At times it feels like I have no one and wonder why I am even put on this planet, But I know God has a plan for me. I'll write More later. Thanks for listening!

         I get the same battles every single day. You would think that the battles would get easier.  The whole fight about should I eat , and if I eat, I eat too much. Then I have the stress of all the fights I have with my mom. Everything is just so hard. My goal is to lose 25 lbs by August 25th. and lost 10 more by september 11,(when i go school shopping) I am not going to put myself through the pain of getting clothes that are bigger than i want, or putting them on and nothing looks good. for once i would like to feel good about my appearance. The main reason I am trying so hard this time is i want the lead in the musical this year and I am not going to be FAT in front of hundreds of people. Just not going to happen. Done Deal!
