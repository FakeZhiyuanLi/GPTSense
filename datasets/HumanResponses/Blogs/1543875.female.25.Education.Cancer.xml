						   This last week as well as the current one have been hard on Neša in terms of daycare drop off. He's been clinging, cuddley, and screamy every day I've tried to drop him off the last week or so. I think all the changes around here combined with the week he was off sick have taken their toll on him. It's all too much for him to take at once. On top of home stuff, they're in the process of moving him down to the junior preschool room in the next two weeks. His scheduele at daycare is therefore changing as well. Maybe just too much for his little mind to take in all at once?  On a speech note: he said "yogourt raisin" today after I said it, he was eating yogourt covered raisins at the time. He also said "coconut" and "donkey heehaw". So I know the words and the ability to say them are in there. Just ... he doesn't seem to want to use them. Like for example he knows milk, water, and juice, but whenever he pulls on the door he says "juice" even if he wants milk. Strange. Habit? I'm trying to break it, by saying "do you want some milk" and he always says "ya". We'll see.

						     What a wonderful day outside! The weather is just perfect, not too hot, not too windy, not too humid. Wow. If every day was like this all year, punctuated by a few weeks of thundershowers here and there, that would be just wonderful.  We went out and watched some of the runners by Hog's Back, then headed over to Mooney's Bay and enjoyed the sun and sand. Nesa spent some time on the swings, some time doing the slide thing, and some time running around making me exercise. LOL. Not like I don't need that exercise.  Otherwise, need to get moving on dinner. Planning to bake some chicken, saute some asparagus, and make some fries to go with it. Just need to get off my ass and actually do it!  Tomorrow I start work. Should be interesting.

						   Friday morning.. end of the week. Starting on Monday I'll be working again and all I can say about that is HALLELUJA!!! I'm so sick of sitting around the house with nothing to do.  Today went Shopping with Amanda, headed out to Ikea (finally!! got my magazine boxes), Micheals (picked up 10 new patterned papers), and Loblaws (food!! without having to bus it!). It was a nice morning, and much preferred to sitting here and doing a whole lot of nothing.   Came home to find my house smelling like Chili, ate Chili, and discovered that I put too much cayenne into said Chili. Mmm, burning mouth, happy tummy. I dont think I'll even try giving this to Nesa. It's going to be one of those I eat this, you eat that nights ;)  Going to have a nap, still not feeling particularily well.

						   I think ... I'll have a nap.  It's 1, and my head is starting to pound again. I think the sensible solution is to take a tylenol, have a nap, and resume my cleaning spree in two hours time.  Have to figure out what I'd like for dinner tonight. Chili tomorrow because I didn't get my ass in gear in time for today. So we'll be overnight-crockpotting the chili for tomorrow. Yum. Also gives me a chance to make sure I have all the ingreds.  Going to pick up a binder tomorrow and hold punch and start printing out and cataloguing my recipes ... right now they're so disorganized. That's the plan.

						   I just heard from my lawyer. he wants to change my appt from today at 10am to next wednesday at 9am. in a way it's a good thing, because I feel horrible, but I really want to get this over with. I can't put in the application for Osap until i have the seperation aggreement done with. THAT annoys me.  In other news, I'm sick sick sick. LOL. Inner ear infectiong, and i'm not liking it. No antibiotics, but I'm constantly taking three things (one for nausea, one for dizzyness, and one for head pain). I really don't need anymore crap in my body, but it's for my own good. Since I can't stand or walk straight, I'm obviuosly not doing so good.  ...  They're moving Nesa to the bigger preschool room downstairs... sometime this month. He's down there for mornings now, and goes upstairs for nap and lunch. I'm glad, I think he's ready to be downstairs, he's the oldest in his room, and he likes it more down there. I like the women down there more as well, I'm not too keen on the two in the toddler room.

						     I'm still sick. Can you believe it. I can't get into see my doctor until tomorrow morning around 11:30. That means I'll be headed to a clinic today, and am going to waste hours of time - not really wasting I guess as I'd have to be doing something productive. productive my ass. I haven't done anything remotely productive since Saturday when i attempted to do dishes and vacuum. What a mess here, and what can I do? Nothing. I can hardly stand up without gripping something to keep from falling over.  On a positive note, Neša is in daycare today so I can get to the dr without the added hassle of bringing him alone. I would have went over the weekend, but I refused to bring him. I would have been completely unable to control him.  blech.

						     I'm not sure what I have. Last night was spent mostly in the washroom, until I could keep some tylenol down and get back to sleep. I feel rested this morning, but am still feeling nauseous and my eyes are so sore from the constant head pounding.  Hopefully it passes soon.  Otherwise, have been informed this morning that he'll be taking the twin bed, living room chair, and couch with him. Leaving me with a tv and nowhere to sit to watch it. I really shouldn't complain - but I am. I can't afford to buy a new couch (or even a used one!) at this point, so we'll be laying on the floor to watch tv!  Lots of room for Neša to play I guess. It will make the room look bigger?  *sigh* five more days.

						      So I'm sick. Ick ick ick.  I think it's strep throat, since Neša just got over Scarlet Fever last week. I have a lowgrade fever (~38.9) and my throat is swollen and sore. I've been drinking tea all morning, and am really in the mood to lay on the couch and relax.  But ... I'm going to meet my sister at 1pm. Hopefully by then some of this head fuzziness will have cleared. I've been up for three hours and I'm still a little out of it.  She's going to buy some sandals for Neša as his birthday present! I haven't bought him any yet, and it's getting much warmer out.  Anyways, weather doesn't look promising today - might rain, might not!!

						   I've just finished reading "Uther" - Book 7 of  A Dream of Eagles  by Jack Whyte.  All I can say is it was well worth the read. It's the first in the series I didn't buy, but borrowed from the library. Let me just say that I will be picking up my own copy of that when I have the spare change.  I couldn't put it down! Now on to "Clothar the Frank"

						   Leaky diapers : story of my life!  Last night I got up at 3:30 to give Nesa his abx as per usual and found a huge wet spot and soaked pajamas. Too bad, I'd just changed the bed sheets too! He's already wearing the biggest size diapers, and he's not quite ready to potty train yet (he  just  turned two for crying out loud!) so this is going to go on indefinitely it seems.  Hopefully things will get marginally better next week?

						   I just de-scummed the bathtub. That was fun!  And now I've fiddled around a little figuring out the templates on this blog, seeing which graphics I'd like to change (since I do particularily like this template) and which colours I'd like to use.  All kinds of fiddling. I guess for now, I'll tweak this until i like it, and when I've finished, I'll just put a link to the pre-existing website and leave it intact. That way if i decide to go back to it, it won't be a big stressful thing going back and forth!

						   Another poem. This is my favorite of all my poems. I like to think it turned out nicely. Funny thing though, I can't seem to find a dated version... I know it was written sometime in early 1998, because I remember the circumstances surrounding it. Just no exact date...    Heartstrings   you play me like a violin pulling gently on my heartstrings  fumbling to tune me will I play for your desire?  silent melodies resonate your fingers tug at my inner core  you play me like a violin pulling gently on my heartstrings

						            Today. Went to see Amanda this afternoon, hadn't been over yet to see Amy yet. Neša and I walked through the Horticulture Gardens at Algonquin on the way over - looked at the flowers, chased some birds, posed for some photos. We were lucky. Got caught in the rain half way there, but it didn't pick up until about twenty seconds after we got in the door. Were slightly wet, but enjoyed it.  Last night on the way to the store I let Neša jump in all the puddles from the rain earlier in the day. He was wet up to his waist, but enjoyed himself completely.

						          We headed out to Mooney's today to check out the Dragon Boat Festival Some cool stuff there - Neša (me too!) enjoyed the Armed Forces display, and touching the big tank :)  We watched some of the boats, looked at all the stuff there, then headed out to some greenspace to kick the ball around. Had a great time, and headed home when mr. sunshine decided to unpack his crankypants.  Listening to: U2 - The Hands that Built America.

						   Here is a poem originally written April 27, 1999. I've been thinking for a while how I haven't felt any desire to write poetry, haven't had any inspiration, so I went back and reread all of the poems I had saved on cd. This is one of my favorites, not specifically becuase I like how it is written, but because of the memories associated with it.    Second Cup   I chatting at a corner table eyes on the guys behind the counter minds wandering off the news thoughts more appealing dreams in her eyes.  II enticing smell hard black coffee pungent aromas filling the air awakening memories stillshots in my mind didn't we used to sit here once? together yet alone lost in our eyes.

						        So! Got roped into reading all five Spot books numerous times this morning. As much fun as it is to read ... I'm already getting sick of Spot. Reading one of them this morning resulted in a twenty minute lesson on how to say "crocodile." Apparently all my years of experience mean nothing because it's a "cock-o-phile." Wonderful. Just wonderful.  Good for a laugh at least.  Listening to: Our Lady Peace - Clumsy

						   What to say ~ poor little Booger again!!  I think it's teething now, but I'm not completely confident in that diagnosis. Neša came down with a faver Saturday night, and it persisted through to last night around midnight when it broke. He was super-mega-crazy cranky, and was very clingy all day, spent the better part of Sunday in my lap alternating between sleepy spells and screaming spells. I think it was teething becasue this is the first time in a year and a bit that he's shoved his fingers in his mouth and tried to gnaw on them. As well, he was producing  drool  like I've never seen before. Runny nose, but clear. All in all strange.  He seems to be in a little better mood this morning, no fever. We'll see how he is. I felt so bad because I went out for a bit on Saturday night and Barb babysat. She said he was in a great mood, but he must have felt miserable, coming down with a fever and no mommy :( As I said, poor little guy.  Listening to: Abba - The Winner Takes It All

						   Well, at four am I was awake, and I had a great post in my head. Now I've lost it. It's filed away with all that other useless unused info back there.  Onto the important things: Why was I awake at 4h?  For the first time ... EVER ... I left the bedroom door open when I went to bed. Not quite sure why, but it just didn't occur to me that keeping it shut would make a difference. Well, Neša woke up at 4h and decided he wanted some milk. I woke up to a little voice in the distance yelling "bottle aaarrrrrr bottttttllllllle". He was in the kitchen tugging on the fridge door, having gotten up, crawled over me, and brought his bottle into the kitchen.  The interesting thing is that in the morning, he's taken to laying in bed next to me for a period of time, then "asking" (by pointing to the door and saying "go") if he can get up. So as a matter of habit, I say "Do you want to get up now, are you ready to go to the living room?" And of course, he says "Ya".  That leads me to believe that he is associating the closed bedroom door with staying in bed. Just as when i put him in bed at night, the door is closed. Intersting. The door was open just one time, and he thought he could go out ... and get his own bottle. LOL.  -----------  And now for a completely different subject. He's not as upset when he runs into me at daycare anymore. Yesterday there were two instances where I ran into him in the hallway. The first time he said, and I quote, "uuuuuhh" and then happily went upstairs with everyone. The second time he was on his way outside, and I'll attribute his disinterest to the fact that he was going to have a fun time outside?  I felt rejected.

He's repeating so many things lately, and coming out with so many words I've never heard him use that I just can't keep track anymore. It's unbelievable how his vocabulary, or at least his attempt at using his existing vocabulary, has just exploded lately. He's going to be a talking machine in no time.

						   Okay. I posted a bunch of stuff lately, but nothing about us. Here's the lowdown:  I finally put in my application for OSAP. Based on the information I entered on the application form, they estimate I am eligible for $17,000 this year. That's wonderful. More than enough to pay tuition and live on for the eight monthes I'll be in school. So just to wait on the processing, plus I have some forms and documents to mail/fax in to them.  Got the first paycheck for the new job today. I find it strange how the pay is done - I was paid today for working June 1 - June 15. Yet it's only the tenth. I'm being paid for days I have yet to work. ... Not that you'll hear me complaining, I was afraid I'd have to wait until the end of the month to see the money!  Nesa has been speaking a lot more lately, trying out words I've never heard him use before:  heart / poopy / stick / chair / table / box / kleenex-(kee-nax) / bath / light / tv / crayon-(kay-on) .  He has also been doing well with bedtime. Tonight was night six of putting him to sleep and letting him fall asleep on his own, without Mommy there. It took only five minutes. That is a HUGE improvement over the first three nights which took over an hour each night. Tonight I made sure we played ourselves out and then delayed bedtime until 9. As well, I didn't let him have any milk until I brought him into bed. Gave him his bottle. Held him for a couple minutes, spoke with him, told him I loved him, kissed him, and left. Five minutes, he was asleep. I know. I opened the door.  Thank God!  ... on and on a completely unrelated note, I discovered that my MP3's have outgrown my F drive. I'll have to transfer them to D since there is about 26 gig's free there. I hate that everytime I load something from F the computer stalls becuase of the music.  Remind me to set that to transfer before I leave for work tomorrow, hmmm? I imagine it will take a while to transfer 1200 files.

But if you're going to play like that, you're not going to score.  But I'm not going to bitch about Calgary. I'm surprised they made it this far, and admittedly I was perched on the edge of the coffee table for most of the 3rd. They really picked up the pace and a couple times I nearly smacked the t.v. Come on. So many good shots. So many good saves. So many good moves.   Calgary might not have won, but they certainly made my night, played a good game, fought a good fight.  And on that note, there are some HOT guys on the Lightening.

						   I'm beat today. It seems that three days of staying up until 23h or 00h has done me in. I spent the better part of this morning laying on the couch of hiding under the covers while Neša tried to entice me to play with him. After three hours of that, i rolled out and up at 9:30. Did some dishes. Made some croissants.   I think that when he goes for nap in an hour, I will go for nap. I could use it. I'm still falling asleep here.  urlLink THIS  is me. Exactly.  urlLink THIS  brings to mind the microwave incident at work on Friday. Do you think I need to sleep some more? Hmmm.  ----------  Watched the game last night, very disappointed. For how tired I am because of it, they could have at least won!! Now Monday will be another late night to watch game 7. And don't tell me that I'm not being forced to watch the game. I realize this is a choice I'm making, but sue me for doing something that I enjoy instead of sitting around doing puzzles and building towers all day. Yet I watch one hockey game and am lethargic and cranky for two days becuase I'm too exhausted.   And on an even more stupid note : I don't start work until 10:30. I could (should!) be sleeping in, but someone still has to wake up at 5h30 or 6h every day. Is there any way to change a two year old's sleeping habits? It seems even if he goes to bed at 00h or later that he's up at 5h30.  *sigh*

						     I'm considering making this dessert today :  Root Beer Float Cheesecake . Don't think it sounds good? It's a swirled cheesecake, similar to a marble one, except instead of a chocolate swirl you have a root beer flavoured swirl.  I think it would go wonderfully with some vanilla ice cream and a glass of coke.  ...  Ok. So it's not very healthy sounding, and both my head and ass agree that it's probably not a good idea to make it. The problem is my stomach liked the idea.  ...  I guess, what it all boils down to, is if I make it to Zellers today to buy a springform pan. Mine got lost somewhere...

						   So!  This evening was frustrating.  For the first time in his short little life, I let Nesa cry himself to sleep. He's still sleeping now (about 1h45 later), and I've checked on him - after he terrorized the bedroom he crawled into bed, pulled the covers up and drank his bottle until he fell asleep. I pried the bottle out and he's stil sleeping.  He was being very rude and obnoxious all evening, refused to eat dinner, poured two cups of water all over the coffee table, didn't listen to a word I said, cried, acted up, kept stripping, taking his diaper off, etc. After an hour of trying to get him to bed, I gave up. I was furious and frustrated and there was no way I could so much as lay next to him to get him to sleep!  Now I think I'll do the same thing tomorrow, see how it goes. If I can get him used to it, the better for me. It's so hard to listen though.  Oh. The game is back on. Overtime.

						   Afterthought :   I forgot to buy milk on the way home, so after dinner we went out for a walk to pick some up. As we were walking through the parking lot, Nesa was pointing everything out and naming it: "caaaar" "peeeple" "tweeEee" "cookie (tim hortons! LOL). He tried to let go of my hand and run, so I told him no, he that it wasn't a park, but a parking lot, and it's dangerous to run across the parking lot. So I picked him up instead, and he said ... "pahking 'ot".   Yeah for my child who doesn't speak. I think it's starting, soon he'll be babbling away, won't he? Good God, what am I in for now?!

						        See that? We had McDonalds for dinner tonight. And you know what we got in our Happy Meals?!?! Neopets Plushies. Whoopee!  I am so excited. Nesa "in theory" got two new toys, but "in reality" Mom confiscated them to live on the printer ;)  I'll pick him up some new exciting MicroMachines next time I'm at Walmart.   MY NEOPETS. MINE. ALL MINE @@.  ... ... ...  Okay, enough acting like a child. I really love my new job, the people are wonderful, the job is good, the pay is good, the hours are good, the location is good.  So things are going great on that front. I need to ask what the pay scheduele is like, I think it's a once a monthly pay thing, but my income is low enough that I don't need income tax deducted. Making my pay cheques bigger. Thank goodness. Even so, I shouldn't have to pay next year, and I'd rather take that little bit more on every pay instead of one lump sum next March. I need it now.  As for the Osap, I'm going to work on that. Going to email OSAP tomorrow, see how things stand re: me applying before the seperation agreement is finalized. The lawyer is typing up the final draft right now, but it's not complete, and if it's not complete, I can't send it to Osap, and according to the Osap website, without all files, they can't process. So I want to know if there is some way I can send it along later...la di da... and not have my application held up!!  So, tomorrow at lunch : email Osap!

						   The computer is back up and running. It's so nice to have everything reinstalled again! I'm on the search for a couple Mp3's that I want, but otherwise nothing new.  I will edit the photos tonight or tomorrow then post them. I discovered that I hadn't configured Firefox right and it wasn't allowing any popup windows to load - including the window in Blogger to upload photos. Silly Me!  So it's working now, and I've fiddled around enough with Firefox now that I think it should be working right.

						    MP3's.   It turns out I had about 7 GB of MP3's on my computer before they were accidentaly deleted last weekend. After I recovered them all and burnt them, I used up the entire box of CD's I'd bought for saving all my files/photos/documents/music.  I hadn't realized I had that many. I have one entire cd of U2 music (actually, I ran out of room on the CD and had to burn the entire WAR album on another one), and another of basically Pink Floyd, The Hip, and REM. The problem now is that they're on CD and not all on the hard drive. Unless I copy them back onto the hard drive this weekend, I won't be able to load everything up at once.  Decisions.

						   I have a bunch new photos that I want to upload, but until Saturday when the harddrive is formatted and everything is reinstalled, I have no graphic software. No PSP, No Photoshop. The photos are much to big in the original form, so it will have to wait until then.  On Monday Neša was moved up to the Jr. Preschool room. It was up in the air when he would actually move; at one point I was told June, at another August. Apparently he was having a hard time napping in the Toddler room, and was bored with the younger kids (He was one of the oldest in the Toddler room). Now he's with two or three kids around his own age, plus about 15 older children (up to age 4) and he seems to be much happier. He is napping better, enjoying himself more, throwing less tantrums, etc.  I'm glad because it means he'll be exposed to new skills (esp. language related) by being around the older children. I think it will also help with the potty training in September since he'll be around other children actively doing the same. Yeah.  Otherwise, it's hot as hell here and I can't stand it. Where is the winter?! I can not take anymore days like today, and it's going to be another month of the same. This is the WORST time of the year. Thank God for the fan, or I don't think I'd be surviving. I came home at lunch today, washed my face, sat down in front of the fan, and ate a freezie. It seemed the only sensible solution. Thankfully we have a new fan at work too, so it's bearable in the kitchen now.  Listening to : Arthur in the background.

						    urlLink Concert Reviews / Discussion Board   Friday night we went to the Blue Rodeo concert at Bluesfest. It was amazing. Didn't arrive until ~8:15, and the concert started at 8:30, but we were still early enough to get fairly close to the stage. Progressively moved forward throughout the concert, but at least I had a clear view of the bigscreen throughout the entire show.

						          Some photos from today: Spent some time with Uncle Chris downtown and tossed the ball around. Had lunch out, strolled around Rideau, headed out to Major's Hill Park, then came home and crashed with Caillou. Neša was so tuckered out he passed out on my shoulder on the bus ride home. Left him in the stroller and spent some time outside enjoying the nice weather before bringing him inside and napping with him (:       And then a crappy photo of me to keep things fair. Yup. I shouldn't wear hats. I'm not a very photogenic person lately, and that bothers me. How come photos of me can't turn out nicely? I always have the worst expressions or look completely out of proportion. Strange.  Listening to : Blink 182 - All The Small Things.

						   I decided to pick up some new books for Neša and thought I'd take advantage of my ten dollar off coupon for  urlLink Chapters  in one fell swoop. I ordered  urlLink Two   urlLink Raffi  cd's,  urlLink Mud Puddle , and  urlLink Where the Sidewalk Ends . Keep in mind that I decided this late Saturday afternoon. They arrived today! I'd forgotten how much I love  urlLink Shel Silverstein , and forgotten many of the poems in the book. Here's one of my favorites, and I think one of the more well known ones:    Hug O' War  I will not play at tug o'war. I'd rather play at hug o'war, Where everyone hugs Instead of tugs, Where everyone giggles And rolls on the rug, Where everyone kisses, And everyone grins, And everyone cuddles, And everyone wins.   Tomorrow we'll listen to Raffi. And relive my childhood! Funny the things that I liked then are still entertaining now. We won't even get started on the subject of my  rediscovery of lego over the past two weeks. Wow. Talk about bringing out the child within ...

Go see it.  Listening to: Fiddler on the Roof - If I Were A Rich Man

						    Our Weekend?   Yesterday Neša woke up bright and early at 6:30 am (as per usual!) so we headed out for breakfast at McDonald's before 8h! Went from there for a walk along  urlLink Hog's Back , through the park, over to Vincent Massey Park, down along the Rideau River to  urlLink Billing's  and then into the mall. Shopped for a bit, and Kevin bought me something nice (:  From there we took the bus downtown and went to  urlLink Rideau  where I used up the rest of my gift certificate and got  urlLink two tops  that fit perfectly. From there we headed into the Market, down past Major Hill's and the  urlLink Art Gallery , and then along the Ottawa River to the Canal. We stopped to watch the boats pass through the locks into the Ottawa River, and Kevin took a couple photos of Neša and I (one of which I posted earlier). After the boats were through, we crossed over the locks and headed down the path along the Ottawa River. It was a beautiful walk and the weather was so nice!! Walked up by  urlLink Parliament Hill , stopped to listen to some cheery music, then headed back to Rideau for lunch!  In the afternooon we went blading along the Ottawa River Parkway from Lincoln Fields to down near Westboro. My legs couldn't take anymore, so I walked back while Neša had a well deserved nap in the stroller. It was great weather for being outside, and I'm glad it wasn't humid like the rest of the summer has been!  Listening to : U2 - One Love.

						        Another photo of me that Kevin took last Saturday (July 31). I think it's a pretty good photo, considering that I hate almost all photos of myself.

						        Neša with his friends at daycare. Simon was wearing a fascinating shirt today with all these wonderful drawings of bugs on it. Everyone wanted to poke and prod his tummy - this is Neša taking his turn.

						    This and That ...  Yesterday we went blading. I've been out two or three times since I borrowed the rollerblades from  urlLink Amanda , but each of those times I was wobbly and didn't last more than a few crazy minutes in the parking lot scaring the crap out of myself. Turns out I'm not as rusty as I thought. I had a few problems with the hills and with the unfamiliar skates, but I didn't fall, my ankles didn't give out, and I enjoyed myself. I really thought that I wouldn't be able to get back into it so easily after four years of no exercise!  Watched  urlLink The Ring  last night. Scared the crap out of me. I am not a scary movie fan - I had nightmares after watching  urlLink The Sixth Sense . You can only imagine the memories I have of being *allowed* to watch  urlLink The Silver Bullet  and Nightmare on Elm Street when I was 7 years old. I am still traumatized over that and really can't imagine why anyone would allow a child to watch movies like that? Ironically, I'm a big fan of the psychological thriller  book-wise , but I just can't tolerate having it shown to me; I will have nightmares or panic attacks after watching a psychological thriller, but can read book after book without any problem whatsoever. Which reminds me, I haven't read any in a while.  I picked up two Carol Shields books that I haven't read yet (Unless and The Orange Fish), plus two Jonathan Kellerman books, while at the library on Tuesday afternoon.    The last books that I enjoyed reading were The Eagle's Brood series by Jack Whyte. I'm still waiting to get Clothar the Frank from the library as I missed it last time my name came up on the request list. I'm not going to actually buy it for myself until it comes out in paperback.  That's about it?

						          These first two images were from our walk down by Hog's Back yesterday afternoon. We spent the afternoon at the beach with Barb then walked over the rapids. The weather was beautiful and we were lucky enough to catch a rainbow over the rapids!        This one is from this afternoon when Maryele and Casandra dropped by to visit. How cute.
