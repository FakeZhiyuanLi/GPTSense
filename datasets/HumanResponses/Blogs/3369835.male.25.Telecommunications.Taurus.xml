      Friday was a blast, but I must say that i had lots of fun cruisin around annapolis and hangin out by the water.. it was a nice and sunny day and chillin with the guys from the band was great..  I had Lunch with Dave over at Buddy's on main street and then met up with Darren and Tanner for some chill time on the waterfront at EGO alley.  This was all before we knew what would be in store for later that nite.. :-p  Even though it started out kinda slow about 30 minutes after the first set was going it was like a flash mob.  O'brians was packed solid with people who wanted to get their groove on with slipdisk.. Lots of pictures were taken from there as well.. BTW i have got to give a shout out to the hottie Bartenders Mia and Gretchen.. Thanks Ladies :)   for that matter shout outs to all of the hotties in annapolis.. YEAH YEAH... Man, I can only hope this summer rocks as much as these past few weekends have.. :)

      Whew - What a weekend.. it was quite nice i must say..  It all started out with a fabulous Thursday nite at what used to be the BARN in CARNEY.. It was Beach Party night.. and needless to say i supported the function with a wearing of a bright red obnoxious flowered shirt.. :)  The band was great and we did some dancing.. shouts to my new friends there - Lauren the tub girl, and Kelly the math teacher.  Now for actual Weekend events... Friday night, I headed down to brew river in salisbury to hang out with one of my favorite bands -slipdisk. There they hooked it up by playing outside on the water.. it was a great night.. being on the water, lots of people, palm trees.. it couldnt get much better..  See pictures in my photo gallery section.  After the gig, i stayed the nite in salisbury over at a friends house.. there one of her roommates was left to keep me company.. :-p Thanks a bunch hun for the easy mac for a drunk snack and then Cinnamon Rolls for breakfast they were excellent.. Heather, Jen and Julie- you guys are sooo nice to me.. thanks again..

      Well i just wanted to check in and say what up to all my followers.. ;-)    Well since the LaPalapa gig, i have been traveling with the boys from slipdisk tomost gigs and helping them out where ever i am able to...    Pics should be up soon and to recap -  The FunkBox show was great.. it was down in federal hill and i had a blast.. i took a whole clan with me and we hung out and heard Slipdisk do the opening up for Full Effect...  This was slipdisk's first all original gig and they also played a couple cover songs too..   Full effect was good too, but didnt impress me too much ..  A few privildged people were able to come back to the house for the afterparty and i hooked it up on the grill with Hamburgers, hotdogs and some kickin chicken skewers...   Lots of fun was had by all.. and some had a little too much fun.. ;-) lol.. can't wait to do it again..  The next night, the band was playin over at luna C grill... bottom line- i got ripped..hahah  i hope this place doesnt turn out like brew river... i kinda like luna c... oh well..  This past weekend i traveled down to clarendon in Arlington and watched the guys play a great show and it was packed! Afterwards we hit up the silver diner and then crashed out over dave's house.. thanks for letting me crash there man.. :)  This past sat night was slipdisk's big return to nottinghams... it was a charity event to benefit the lukemia and lymphoma society.. money was raised for the charity and i was glad to be able to give a few bucks as well... they had an auction with a cruise, mountain bikes, and also did a 50/50 raffle...  Good Luck kelly on your quest to $100k....  The band went on a little after 10 and jammed out.. they even managed to invite me up on stage to jam with them.. thanks guys.. i love you man! haha  check the pics out here..  well my sleep sched is all f-ed up so i know its early but it also means home from work early.. :)  Peace to my peeps  JNiCe
