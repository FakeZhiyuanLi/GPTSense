      I can't wait for the table tennis match this afternoon. Will Singapore's representative, Li Jiawei win? I really wonder. Anyway, I hope that she does because, it's going to be of great significant to us. But nevertheless, she has done a great job and has done all the Singaporeans proud of her. Way to go! I was looking at her on tv yesterday and I realised jing fang was right. She really is indeed wearing alot of accessories, the ear rings, the necklace and the ring. I suspect the ring is her engagement ring. Wow. And the TV like purposely zoomed in to her precious ring. I wonder how much it costs, with all the shining and all that. Actually, it's hard for a sportsman to be so feminine. Don't you think so? Look at the others. They don't wear all these fancy stuff on their body. And they look so boyish. Not like girls at all. So, I envy her for being so sporty yet still so feminine. Double-sided. That's cool. =) Anyway, I hope she will win a medal for Singapore. We'll always be behind you.

      I just want to add in something. I miss you alot. Time really flies. Our four years in Temasek is going to come to an end. It's so sad. I will miss the school alot. But most importantly, it's you who will bring back all the happy memories for me. The memories will always stay in my heart. Forever, ever.  P.S Good luck Li Jiawei! You can do it! Don't be too affected. Work hard for the next competition! Way to go.

      1. When girls say something, they usually mean another in their heart 2. Girls are very emotional and cries easily 3. Girls are very sensitive 4. Girls are aware of the surroundings and take note of very single little details 5. Girls want all the attention to be on them 6. Never ever comment that other girls are pretty in front of the girl who likes you 7. Always say i love you to the one you like. =)  Lesson learnt: Never tie your hair too tight or else.. it would be very ugly and very painful. Like what I am suffering now. Or else, your hair would also be like abigail's hair. It's just too tight.

      Why? Why? Why are you treating me like this? Do you know that you are affecting me every minute? You are hurting me too. So much. You know something? I see it as you would rather go make up with a good old friend than me. Is he more important? I know that I am being ridiculous here. With all these important stuff. But, do you ever know that it matters so much to me? I really don't get it. We are going home straight after school. Me and you. But, you always reject me for somebody else. Or simply, nobody. Why? I really don't understand. Do you really detest going back home with me? It's not as if I cant go home by myself. It's because of the minimum time that we have. And that's the reason more why I would love to cherish the time that we have. Don't you? Or have u gave up hope a long time ago? Some things just seem to make me ponder. What exactly is going on in your mind? Are we still the same? No. We are different. It has never ever been the same for the whole of this year. Things change. You change. You know something? You change but you seem to stop me from changing. It just seems natural for you to change. But when I do something different, it's always my fault. Why? I hate that. Am I still as important in your heart? Or has my standing dropped? I guess it has.  Friends Why? Why is it like this? I really want to treat you people as friends, as my good friends. But I just cant seem to be able to. It seems so hard. So terribly hard to accept both of you again. I believe, by now, both of you have became good friends. Since when, may I ask? I have absolutely no idea. Why is it so hard for me to accept you guys again? I force myself to, but I just cant. I just cant stand both of your bitchness. Maybe I am being oversensitive. But, is that the real you that I am seeing? Was I kept in the dark in the past of your true character?  And you! Stop bullying Yifang. If u dare bully her again, I will scold you till you cry. Do you know what a tyrant you are? I just cant stand your attitude. Especially to Yifang. So, I am warning you. Stop scolding her. Many people can't stand your behaviour. If you do not want to be a loner, I suggest that you better change or else you would be left with no friends. And I would be there. To laugh at you for you deserve it. Maybe much more than that. So much for being forever friends in the past.  Teamwork is the most important thing in a group. You can never ever just throw everything to someone in the group and expect the person to do. It doesn't ever work. When I joined your group, I experienced that. I was left to do everything and when the result was bad, you guys gave me that attitude. It sucks ok? It simply does. That's why you people only hang around your clicks. Serves you right.  Academic OMG. The people from MJC came over to have a talk with us. Well, it was more of the principal speaking and the MJC students.. erm living statues? Anyway, the o'levels seem so near. Right now, I know that it is time for me to start thinking my route for the future. I would want to go to a JC but which one? In the north or the east? Should I return to where I belong? Or should I continue with my route? Oh well.. it's so hard to decide. National JC? Temasek JC? I simply have no idea. Ever since what happened between us, I feel like I should go back to where I belong.  tree-lala

      Yes I am hurt. Yes I am affected. Do you know what special date is it today? It's so special yet nothing much had been done to such a day. I feel sad. Today's supposed to be a happy day for both you and I. Yet, it resulted in such misery for us. Maybe not for you but definitely for me. Do you know how I feel when you just refuse to acknowledge this day? I anticipated for such a day which some what seems like years. Who knows.. It's okay. I resign to fate. There's nothing much I can do too. Since I have already made a decision, the only thing I can do now is to stick to it. And not let myself down. I feel like saying something.. "I give up"

      have you ever wondered if you have hated anybody in this world? Frankly, I have. But, is it right of me to hate people? To hate people whom I once used to call friends? I really have no idea. The feeling of hatred just seems to come to me and refuses to bug off. Why is this so? I have no idea and I do not know how to solve it. Hating takes up time, makes me sad, makes me unhappy. It's definitely not a good feeling. But, can someone please help me remove the hatred in me? I do not want to hate them at all. But people change. How do you prevent someone from changing? I know, maybe to others, they must have feel that I have changed. However, just how true is this? I have no idea. I really do not wish to hate them at all. They were once after all, my so called friends.

      Today is the day where i cried the most. I am sad. I am depressed. I am upset. I am unhappy. I feel like crying, and I did. I just made a most touching speech of my life. But i still failed terribly. I didnt keep him back and it's gone. Everything seems different. Everything seems funny. What would it be like without him? Will my life still be as perfect without a pillar? Will I be able to survive well? He was right in something. Our character clashes. We shouldn't have got together in the first place at all. We are better off being friends, i guess. Whenever we get together, we quarrel. We just seem to have no peace. But I never regretted it. I cherished every moment we had together, up till now. I know, it's almost 2 years but.. we have to part at this time. I feel like crying again. I cried so much, so much for you. No matter how much I tell myself, be brave, don't cry, I have always failed. I failed in so many things and this time, I failed so terribly that I tremble at the thought of.. Surviving without you.

       I feel so sad. So hurt. You can never imagine how hurt I am. It just seems like my heart has broken into a thousand million pieces. It hurts to see the people around you change. It really hurts. From your close friends, to the person closest to you. Do you know how much it hurts to me? I treated you so well but i deserved all this? My heart hurts.. It really does..
