       As a game collector, we are rapidly approaching the time of year that I both love and hate: the Fall. The Fall is when all of the game companies traditionally launch their big titles leading up to the Holiday season. From September through Thanksgiving, it is a time of plenty for gamers everywhere. It is also a trial by fire for your wallet.      Without further adieu, I present the list of games coming for the rest of the year that will probably be bought (most anticipated titles highlighted):     August/September     ESPN NHL 2005 - Xbox   Star Ocean - PS2   Spy Fiction - PS2   Phantom Brave - PS2    Silent Hill 4 - Xbox   Sly 2 - PS2   Demon Stone - PS2   Def Jam 2 - Xbox   Final Fantasy XI: Chains of Promathia - PS2   Blood Will Tell - PS2   Monster Hunter - PS2   X-men Legends - Xbox   Shin Megami Tensei - PS2    Fable - Xbox    DoA Ultimate - Xbox   Pikmin 2 - GC   Donkey Konga - GC   Half Life 2 - PC   Kohan 2 - PC   Call of Duty:United Offensive - PC   Sims 2 - PC   Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War - PC   Rome: Total War - PC         October    ESPN NBA 2005 - Xbox    GTA: San Andreas - PS2    Death by Degrees - PS2   Otogi 2 - Xbox   Red Ninja - Xbox   Paper Mario 2 - GC   Close Combat - PC   Armies of Exigo - PC       November    Ratchet &amp; Clank - PS2   Lord of the Rings: The Third Age - PS2   Gran Turismo 4 - PS2   Metal Gear 3 - PS2   Jak 3 - PS2    Prince of Persia 2 - Xbox    Viewtiful Joe 2 - PS2    Halo 2 - Xbox    Baiten Kaitos - GC   Ghost Recon 2 - PC    Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle Earth - PC       Damn. Looking at that list makes me want to cry - both in anticipation of gaming goodness and how bad my wallet will hurt.

        Jobs are just like any other commodity in a free market. Sure, it's easy to point at someone that lost a job and say 'we have to do something', but that is exactly the wrong thing to happen. That is the reaction of being able to see a person suffer, but not being able to 'see' the benefits of letting a free market work.     The current study that people are in an uproar about says that the US will outsource 3.3M jobs by 2015. 500,000 of them will be in the IT sector. "Eek! Let's close our borders and hide our heads in the sand! What can we do to save ourselves from the evil corporations?" Is that about right?     Here's reality. Just like trade in goods, trade in services forces painful redistributions of employment. However, the truth is that outsourcing is less of a threat than US workers understand, and there are enormous benefits to the US economy.     There isn't a one-for-one relationship between jobs lost in the US and those gained overseas. For example, outsourcing of IT services typically leads to domestic job losses of less than 20 percent. To say that more clearly: for every 100 jobs sent overseas, only 20 US jobs are actually lost.     In addition, a recent report on offshoring from McKinsey estimates that every dollar of costs the United States moves offshore brings America a net benefit of $1.12 to $1.14 (the additional benefit to the country receiving the investment comes on top). Part of this arises because, as low value-added jobs go abroad, labor and investment can switch to jobs that generate more economic value. This is what has happened with manufacturing: employment has dwindled, but workers have moved into educational and health services where pay is higher (and conditions often more agreeable).     The increases in efficiency that corporations will be able to enjoy will also have ancilliary benefits. For example, the globalization of computer hardware manufacturing led to a 10 percent to 30 percent decline in prices. This made computer equipment more affordable and led to a far greater increase in jobs in the long run than were lost initially when production went abroad.     In another thread, someone mentioned the fear of shipping technical expertise overseas. I assume that reference was a fear that US innovation would suffer. Perhaps all those bright young Chinese and Indians will steal not just jobs but the rich world's most precious skills.     To such fears there are two answers. First, some innovation will undoubtedly move abroad: the relocation of research and design, and the enormous increase in the numbers of highly trained graduates, will ensure that happens. But the transfer may be slower and more modest than the isolationists fear. Innovation needs the right culture to flourish. Chinese and Indians in California generate more new ideas than they do in their homelands. I say with some confidence that America's long tradition of embracing new ideas and new ways of doing things, combined with a willingness to question authority, ensures that we will continue to foster innovation more effectively than most industrializing countries can do.     Second, innovation abroad makes everyone richer. Remember, the British once feared the rise of America's industrial might: today, both nations are vastly wealthier than they were. In services, as in goods, trade brings benefits too great to refuse.

       One of the things that is frequently dismissed by those to the left of center is whether any form of media bias exists.  I stand by my assertion that the media is exceedingly biased, and towards the left.  Why do I think that?      Well, to begin with, 90% of journalists in the US have voted Democrat in the last 4 or 5 presidential elections, which proves nothing, but sure adds context to the discussion. Also, 4 of the top 5 newspapers are decidedly liberal in their editorials. And, no, I don't think that the media lies to the public, as much as they filter all news through their ideology before giving it to the American people. The media provides the information that supports their world view, even if it means not providing context or ignoring things that contradict their ideology. A perfect example of this is the debate going on about 'Bush lying'. There is no reason to go into this, as I think it has been beaten to death in other threads. Or you can look at the way that the current deficit is portrayed in the media - largest in history, without context of what actually causes the deficit to be that large (social programs) or that it is not as large a percent of the total budget or GDP as deficits were under Jimmy Carter in the 1970's. Look at how the media portrays the tax cuts as benefitting only the 'rich'. They never point out that high income is very different than high wealth. Wealth is how you measure 'rich', not income. They also never mention that after every major tax cut, total tax receipts increased because of the benefits to the economy. They talk about how much less the 'rich' pay as a percentage of their income, but not the fact that the 'rich' pay an ever increasing percentage of the total tax receipts, even with a tax cut. Look at gun control. The media continually repeats that the United States has a much higher murder rate than some countries with more restrictive gun control laws. But the media remains silent about the fact that there are other countries, such as Russia, which have more restrictive gun control laws than ours but have far higher murder rates than the United States. Or that there are countries that have higher rates of gun ownership, such as Switzerland, and have a fraction of our murder rate. The members of the media have obviously made a decision that restrictive gun control laws are desirable, which they have every right to do. It is when they try to make up other people's minds by filtering out information to the public that their opinion become a bias in doing their job. Or, look at abortion. the pro-choice media prefers the term "fetus" to the more disturbing "unborn." Stories in the media are never told from a pro-life standpoint. The rights of a father in making an abortion decision are never discussed. In the early 90's, the liberal Los Angeles Times admitted abortion media bias:   "Most major newspapers support abortion rights on their editorial pages, and two major media studies have shown that 80 percent to 90 percent of U.S. journalists personally favor abortion rights. Moreover, some reporters participated in a big abortion rights march in Washington ... and the American Newspaper Guild, the union that represents news and editorial employees at many major papers, has officially endorsed 'freedom of choice in abortion decisions.'...        Responsible journalists do try to be fair, and many charges of bias in abortion coverage are not valid. But careful examination of stories published and broadcast reveals scores of examples, large and small, that can only be characterized as unfair to the opponents of abortion, either in content, tone, choice of language or prominence of play." What about homelessness? The Wall Street Journal's OpinionJournal.com, after George W. Bush's election, began publishing the "Homelessness Rediscovery Watch." Why? When Republicans assume power, the media seems to suddenly rediscover homelessness. The Media Research Center tracked interest in homelessness during the latter part of the Clinton administration. From a MRC report:       "Homelessness -- one of the media's favorite tools to portray the alleged downside of Ronald Reagan's '80s prosperity -- was a more serious national problem during Bill Clinton's 1990s. ... Patrick Markee of the Coalition for the Homeless admitted ... 'Definitely, we saw more homelessness in the 1990s than we did in the 1980s.' But we saw far less homelessness on TV sets during the Clinton years. "During the first Bush administration," according to the Media Research Center, "morning and evening newscasts on ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN ran an average of 53 stories on homelessness annually, compared to less than 17 per year during the Clinton administration. ... The expanding homeless population was out of sight during the Clinton years but just three short weeks after George W. Bush assumed office, ABC won the race to be the first network to rediscover the homeless. On Sunday, Feb. 11, 2001, "World News Tonight Sunday" anchor Carole Simpson intoned: 'Homelessness, which is estimated to affect from two and a half to three and a half million people, is again on the rise.'"   I assume that most people who become journalists do so to 'make a difference'. And 'making a difference' is what the liberal vision is all about. Both are groups of people that have a vision of an idealized society, which is both noble and impossibly unrealistic. You also encounter this mindset of an idealized world among the intelligentsia and acedemic elite, so these natural tendencies are reinforced along the way. Reporters try to encapsulate a 'problem' in the form of a single example that can be aired on the news. The difficulty with that approach is that sometimes the 'problem' doesn't exist in the manner portrayed or is so unbelievably complex it can't be solved. But that doesn't stop our intrepid do-gooders from trying to 'make a difference'. Now, I don't find fault in the majority of reporters. They are trying to do a job they believe in, and should be commended. However, when they cross a line and try to 'make a difference' by framing a story a certain way, or try to pass judgement on a situation they are singularly unqualified to discuss, it is a serious problem. Plus, they worry about making their stories 'accessible to the audience'. Which means dumbing down the subject matter and making it palatable. For example, when reading about homeless people in the media, they always seem to interview the nuclear family of father out of work, mother worried about her two kids that have fallen on hard times. They never seem to interview the junkies or mentally ill people, even though 90% of homeless people got there because of either mental illness or poor life choices. The reality is that people with the the 'noble vision' desire to change the world, based on the wisdom of the few. And they naturally drift towards those professions that allow them to do that, regardless of all of the evidence that contradicts the plausibility of that vision.

       This is a conversation about moral relativism. Before we can discuss it, let’s define what I am talking about. Relativism is the philosophy that denies any absolutes. Any absolutes. Everyone believes that some things are relative, but relativism claims that all things are inherently relative.       As far as I can find, there are four types of relativism: metaphysical, epistemological, moral and religious relativism. You can claim that there are no absolutes anywhere in reality – that’s metaphysical. You can say there are no absolutes in human knowledge – that’s epistemological. Anywhere in morality – that’s moral relativism, and the topic for discussion here. And finally you have no absolutes in religion – that’s religious.       Atheism is the same as metaphysical relativism – there is no Absolute being. Religion is about relationships with the Absolute, so religious relativism says there is no absolute best or truest method for communicating with God. Epistemological relativism is the same as agnosticism – it says that perhaps there is a God, but it can’t be known. There is no absolute in human knowledge. So, where a metaphysical relativist says there is no absolute in reality, and an epistemological relativist says that, “Perhaps there is an absolute in reality, but not in knowledge,” a moral relativist says that perhaps there are absolutes in non-moral knowledge, but not in moral knowledge, i.e. 2+2 does equal 4. But there is no moral absolute. Religious relativism says that there are moral absolutes, such as the Golden Rule, but no religion has it absolutely correct.       I think we all know what ‘moral’ means, so I’ll skip defining it unless specifically requested. ‘Relative’ is always relative to something else, contingent upon something else, or conditional on something else. ‘Absolute’ means ‘not relative’, not contingent but necessary, not conditioned but unconditioned. No ifs, ands, or buts. Absolutes are unchangeable, universal, and objective. There are no distinctions for time, place, or class/culture.       The reason I take such care in defining the terms we use is to properly frame the discussion.       Let me begin by saying that I am a believer in moral absolutes. I think that there is an absolute right and wrong. I believe in good and evil. I think that moral absolutism crosses all cultures and civilizations throughout history. I believe that right and wrong are objective. Right and wrong are taught by all cultures, showing that we are all born with a moral compass pointing the difference between right and wrong. And I think that empirical data proves that out. The first and foundational moral experience that we all have is always absolutistic. Only later in life do we discover relativism. That’s why little kids are always so ‘black and white’.       There is an absolute measure of right and wrong, one that stretches across humanity. It is only through knowing the absolute that we are able to raise ourselves and make progress. Morals and values cannot originate with man. When you are drowning in quicksand, you cannot lift yourself out by your bootstraps.       There has never been a successful society which repudiated moral absolutes. Not one. I think that this issue is important, because the modern West will either disprove one of the most universally established laws in history, give up relativism and survive, or persist in relativism and perish.       It is widely mentioned by those who believe in moral relativism that different cultures have different moral values. The premise of this argument is that moral rightness and wrongness are relative to culture because what is right in one culture is wrong in another. Because a culture’s values differ from one culture to another, moral rightness differs from one culture to another.       The hidden assumption to that argument is that moral rightness is a matter of obedience to your culture’s values, that it is always right to obey your culture’s values. That implied premise assumes cultural relativism. This is important because there can be a difference between what is believed to be right and wrong and what actually *is* right and wrong. Just because the Nazi thinks genocide is right, doesn’t make it so.       But upon investigation, the differences between cultural rights and wrongs are always rooted in a difference of interpretation of a deeper, underlying moral agreement. Different mores for the same morals. Sure, there are differences, but they are like fleas on an elephant – a lot of little disagreements circling around a big agreement. The moral relativist merely ignores the elephant.      To say it another way, the differences between cultures are usually differences in emphasis, not a whole new value system. For example, most pre-modern societies valued courage more than compassion, while most modern societies value compassion above courage. But neither society says that cowardice is good, and neither says cruelty is good. There has never been a wholesale relativism of opinions about values that the relativists portray.       Moral disagreements in history have been either matters of degree or disagreements about how to apply a more basic value that both agree upon. These disagreements share the same morals as a common premise. If you don’t have a common premise, you can’t have a disagreement about how to apply that premise. The fact that one culture values or interprets one moral differently than another culture only proves both cultures recognize that moral and that these morals are universal.       This truth can also be found in language: all cultures have words that represent the same moral tenets. That is what makes translation possible. A culture that has never seen an apple can have no word for it, but all cultures have words for love, honor, charity, courage, good and evil.       If you disagree with that, try to imagine a totally new morality. It is impossible. You can’t envision another morality any more than you can imagine a new set of numbers or colors. Try to imagine a society where honesty and justice and courage and self-control and faith and hope and charity are evil, and lying and cheating and stealing, and cowardice, and betrayal and despair and hate are all good. It can’t be done.

       For quite a while now, Democrats in general have accused the administration of being untrustworthy. No evidence has yet been presented that Bush lied or manipulated intelligence to falsely justify a war. This sort of behavior furthers my belief that the Democrats have no platform other than 'Get rid of Bush'.       The invasion of Afghanistan and the deposing of the Taliban was masterful – one of the finest military actions in history. While many on the Left completely (and perhaps suicidally) opposed taking action after 9/11, Bush inserted Special Forces into Afghanistan within the next couple of days. In a region that had never been conquered, he created an unstoppable combination of local support and US military might. His only real mistake was in the measured diplomacy so many lauded him for – the short time spent negotiating with the Taliban for a peaceful resolution gave OBL the time to slip away. This was perhaps inevitable, as OBL had moved often and secretly ever since Bill Clinton passed on both the offer to bring OBL to America and the many chances Clinton’s CIA had to kill the terrorist leader.       Those with no knowledge of geography or military experience place the blame for losing Bin Laden at Bush’s feet. Those on the ground will tell you differently. The mountains between Pakistan and Afghanistan cover enormous amounts of ground, made up of incredibly difficult terrain that our foes knew and we did not. OBL is an immensely popular figure in the region and has both a friendly populace to aid him and people around him with undying loyalty. But our men in the region tell you something else with the confidence of men with God and the US military on their side – whether tomorrow or a year from now, we will get Osama.       The focus was on Iraq well before 9/11. President Clinton had made regime change in Baghdad official US policy. For a decade, Saddam’s forces had fired almost daily on coalition aircraft. Saddam had tried to assassinate a former US president, and his intelligence services had been involved in planning attacks on US interests abroad, including the attempted bombing of Radio Free Europe in 1998. By 2003, the CIA had accumulated 78 reports from multiple sources documenting instances where the Iraqi regime had either trained operatives for attacks or dispatched them to carry out attacks. Contrary to Michael Moore’s ridiculous assertion that Saddam had never so much as threatened Americans, the CIA reported that Baghdad by the late 1990’s had trained over a thousand Iraqis in terrorist camps to conduct attacks on US and coalition targets. Attempted bombings by IIS agents occurred near a US facility in Manila, and another bomb planted by Iraqi agents was discovered in the US Ambassador’s residence in Jakarta.       From 1996 to 2003 the CIA summarized 50 intelligence reports from multiple sources where Iraqi agents planned for or attempted attacks against US or Israeli targets. During this time, Saddam also offered substantial financial support to Palestinian terror groups. As far as Al Qaeda is concerned, the CIA declared in 2003 that “We have reporting from reliable clandestine and press sources that direct meetings between senior Iraqi representatives and top Al Qaeda operatives took place from the early 1990’s to the present.” Additionally, there were a dozen or so reports of Iraq training Al Qaeda operatives in combat and the use of weapons – conventional, bomb-making, chemical, biological, and radiological. In 1998, a delegation from Saddam offered UBL safe haven in Iraq should he be expelled from Afghanistan.       One final bit of trivia: both the mastermind and one of those who carried out the first World Trade Center bombing were Iraqi. After the successful bombing, the Iraqi operative, Abdul Rahman Yasin, returned to Baghdad.       9/11 was thoughtfully planned and carefully executed. It was a massive attack that screamed of state sponsorship. One of the camps that the CIA had reported on was Salman Pak – which included with its facilities a mock-up 747 used in hijacking training.       On 9/11 with four planes down, the twin towers in rubble, and the Pentagon ablaze, only a fool wouldn’t have asked whether Iraq could be involved. The really shocking thing is the alacrity with which Richard Clarke discounted even the possibility that Iraq could be involved. The man who took months to determine that Al Qaeda had attacked the USS Cole knew within hours of the attacks that Iraq couldn’t have been involved.       Perhaps George Bush had the intent of invading Iraq all along. If so, it at least wasn’t his first priority – as no one has suggested that any steps were taken towards this goal before 9/11. It might be more fair to say that he would have been glad to take out Saddam should the opportunity and reason to do so arise. The Democrats agreed with this idea, and their president had signed this as policy into law almost 3 years before.       The idea that there was significant dissent about Iraq’s WMDs is a revisionist canard. There are dozens of quotes even from those most actively against the war acknowledging their basic acceptance of Iraq as having WMDs. In October 2002, Jay Rockefeller, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence committee – a person with direct access to the exact same, raw, unfiltered intelligence available to the administration – said:    "There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years. And that may happen sooner if he can obtain access to enriched uranium from foreign sources--something that is not that difficult in the current world. We should also remember that we have always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction . . . But this isn't just a future threat. Saddam's existing biological and chemical weapons capabilities pose a very real threat to America, now. Saddam has used chemical weapons before, both against Iraq's enemies and against his own people. He is working to develop delivery systems like missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles that could bring these deadly weapons against U.S. forces and U.S. facilities in the Middle East. . . ."        There are similar quotes available from John Kerry, Howard Dean, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Al Gore, John Edwards, Hans Blix, and even Jacques Chirac. There was dissent over some details of WMD reporting – the uses for those aluminum tubes, for example – but not one serious analyst or military expert went on the record stating significant doubts suggesting that Saddam had destroyed all of his unaccounted for weapons or stopped pursuing WMD programs.       It is easy look back in hindsight and say, “oh I knew all along” but those voices simply were not raised. The voices that were raised called for inspections instead of invasion, but the inspections process was one of the worst Keystone Kops farces in history. The only times the inspectors found anything was after defectors came forward – at which point huge secret programs would be uncovered. More recently, defectors would be the source for minor inaccurate reporting used (the mobile bioweapons labs being the only real snafu). But given Saddam’s history, no one serious thought that he had either disarmed nor that he would fully disclose this time around.       The choice was easy. The best intelligence available to the administration showed a clear pattern of hostility and planned aggression towards the US. The best estimates and analysis of Saddam’s past behavior and intentions indicated that both stockpiles of weapons and programs were, to paraphrase one Democrat, “a slam dunk.”       And there is no evidence the administration fudged, exaggerated, or manipulated any of this intelligence. The just-released Senate report on pre-war Iraq intelligence completely exonerates the administration of even the hint of impropriety. In addition to stating that the few dissents from the general consensus of the intelligence community never made it to policy makers (something laid wholly at the feet of the CIA), the report states clearly that there is no evidence whatsoever that anyone in the administration pressured anyone in the intelligence community in any way.       Additionally, the “Special Plans” office of the undersecretary of Defense that some characterized as “second guessing” conclusions by the intelligence community, did no such thing. All this office (which was never staffed by more than two consultants followed on by two experienced intelligence officers) did was put together a comprehensive list of the reporting of Iraq’s links to terrorism and present them back to…wait for it…the CIA. This office documented various reports that had been left out of more recent finished products. It was then up to the CIA to review the recommendations made by this office and then decide whether to update intelligence products.       None of this will blow the tinfoil hats off of any die-hard, Bush-hating, conspiracy theorist, but then it is hard to take seriously someone who thinks Cheney’s mere presence in a building indicates a conspiracy to secretly falsify justifications for war – especially when that same conspiracy nut sees dozens of contacts between Saddam and Al Qaeda as not amounting to much.       Taking the WMD claims now, the Senate report has been characterized as scathing, and rightly so, but it is important to note where it finds agreement with the administration.       Both the Senate report and recent reporting in the Financial Times have shown Joseph Wilson to be flat out lying about many things. One: his wife indeed did get him the job – not really something a secret agent would be doing, but then she had long before relegated to desk jockey duty. Joseph Wilson also never met with any current Nigerian official on his trip, but only met with limited contacts in the private industry and former officials. Mind-blowingly, when Wilson reported back to the CIA, he recounted that in 1999, the former Prime Minister of Niger (who told Wilson this directly) was approached to set up a meeting with a delegation from Iraq interested in “expanding commercial relations.” The Prime Minister at the time believed that this was an overture by Iraq to purchase uranium. Later, Wilson claimed to the Washington Post to have seen forged documents that he had never seen. So the author of the original “Bush lied” conspiracy, the one that started all the rest, is nothing but a liar himself.       The WMD findings are hit and miss. While the stockpile reporting tended to be based on analysis and estimates, these claims were about weapons and materials unaccounted for. Some of these materials are now being accounted for – samples of the very same sarin and mustard gas shells claimed by the administration have indeed been found. And unlike the overly optimistic predictions of so-called experts, the chemicals in these weapons are no less viable or deadly for their age. The combined chemical weapons found in Iraq could kill tens of thousands of people, used properly.       As far as programs, Saddam has hidden his biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons programs, not divested of them. These are not guesses, but confirmed finds. Saddam hid the components of his programs throughout Iraq, to be reconstituted after sanctions were lifted (something actively sought by France and Russia). Saddam could have been producing chemical and biological weapons in quantity within months, and had he obtained the nuclear materials he sought, could have had the bomb within a few years.       The collective big picture about Iraq is as strong and clear today as it was before the war. Saddam supported and consorted with terrorists, including Al Qaeda. Saddam had unaccounted for weapons of mass destruction. Saddam had hidden programs for weapons of mass destruction, which he had no intention of declaring. There is no denying any of these facts.       This is why the left cannot be allowed to regain power. The intelligence about Saddam may have been flawed, but it painted the same picture for Democrats as for Republicans. This is the one issue – our security and survival – on which we should be fully united. We were, before the war (or to be precise, before the election season began). Leading Democrats who castigate the administration now used the exact same language about Saddam as did the president and vice-president in the months before the war.       If Democrats had merely opposed the Iraq War, that would have been bad enough. To ignore intelligence describing a grave and gathering threat after 9/11 would have been so irresponsible that no liberal should have been allowed control of government for a decade or more. But they didn’t just oppose the war. In fact, they supported it – for selfish political purposes, thinking that in a time of war, this would get them reelected. They did the right thing, but for completely inexcusable reasons, shown clearly by their abandonment of principle as soon as their seats were safe.       And the current Democratic presidential ticket represents the worst of the worst. Rank and file Democrats may be ignorant dupes – and clearly are, shown by the frequency with which they repeat easily rebutted inaccuracies over and over - such as the lie that the administration has ever questioned anyone’s patriotism.       John Kerry cannot claim to be the same. He had the same access to intelligence as the president, and supported the war. Kerry made the same claims about Iraqi WMDs and terrorist ties as the president. The fact that he now uses words like “misled” should automatically disqualify this man from any office. 30 years ago he despicably slandered honorable people with unfounded charges for his own gain, and he does it again today.       The Democrats inability to recognize our common threats and goals proves that they are incapable of leading the country in a time of war. Their willingness to lie and mislead the public about their own positions and statements shows that they have only their own naked interest in gaining power on their agenda.       We have real decisions to make. In the face of apparent threats, how aggressively should the US act? Can we address terrorism without de-fanging the sponsors of terror? Should we assume that regimes that have dozens of friendly contacts with terrorist groups to be no threat? Can we defeat militant fundamentalism in the Middle East without fostering democracy there? If not, are we prepared for a hard road – since places like Iraq and Afghanistan (and Syria, Iran, and Lebanon) will never achieve democracy without the spilling of blood? Is it better to wait out the Middle East and hope things work out before Iran becomes a nuclear power, or should we intervene now?       These are incredibly tough questions. We are not done spilling blood in the Middle East – our blood and that of both enemies and innocents alike. It will take decades for successful democracy to take hold in Iraq and Afghanistan – and without outside intervention, the other countries in the region may never get there. Do we impose our will at the cost of blood, treasure, and the hatred of the world? If not, are we content to lose tens or hundreds of thousands of innocent American lives – surely the cost once the inevitable happens, and terrorist groups obtain WMD capability from tyrants we allowed to stay in power.       John Kerry defines the term 'silver spoon', never having to grow up and live for 5 minutes in the real world. His defining moment was Vietnam – an experience that turned him into a self-promoting liar, hungry for power at the expense of the good names of his comrades in arms. George Bush’s defining moment was 9/11 – an experience that made him unwilling to accept the threat of future mass murder by tyrants who had no business being alive, once they declared their enmity to the United States of America.       Nearly half of this country claims to be planning to vote for Kerry-Edwards. Do what you can to wake them up to the reality that 9/11 wasn’t a fluke. Or be prepared to face much worse days yourself in the future.

       I think it's time for a little history lesson, so kick back and relax - this is going to be long. The First Amendment states, and I quote, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof". The Founding Fathers never thought that religion was bad, or that religion shouldn't be a part of the lives of public officials. They made a prohibition against the establishment of a national religion (such as the Church of England), and said that Congress would make no laws to restrict religious freedom.       This is seen when you look at the other documents of the time for context. In James Madison's first draft of the First Amendment, his wording was:    "The civil rights of none shall be abridged on account of religious belief or worship, nor shall any national religion be established, nor shall the full and equal rights of conscience be in any manner, or on any pretext, infringed."         His context was that there would be no more Salem witch hunts, no Inquisitions, etc. - not questioning the importance of religion as the basis of morality in our government, nor the applicability in government of the laws of God.       After much discussion, the House Select Committee, on August 15, 1789, proposed this version:    "No religion shall be established by law, nor shall the equal rights of conscience be infringed."         Noting that the words are subject to being interpreted out of context, Peter Sylvester, Representative of New York, objected to this version, saying on the floor,    "It might be thought to have a tendency to abolish religion altogether."         James Madison then proposed the insertion of the word "national" before "religion" but this was not agreed upon, so Madison offered this version:    "That Congress shall not establish a religion, nor compel men to worship God in any manner contrary to his conscience." Note the implication that of course men would worship God according to their conscience."         Again, a Congressman arose in concern. Congressman Benjamin Huntington, son of the Governor of Connecticut, protested:    "The words may be taken in such latitude as to be extremely hurtful to the cause of religion."   (Little did he know.)       He then suggested that the Amendment be made in such a way as to secure the rights of religion, but not to patronize those who profess no religion at all.       Roger Sherman did not even want an amendment, realizing that the federal government was not to have any say in what was under the individual states jurisdiction.       James Madison realized that Congressman Huntington understood the meaning of the words to be that Congress should not establish a religion and enforce the legal observation of it by law, nor compel men to worship God in any manner contrary to their conscience.       Madison then responded agreeably to Congressman Huntington and Congressman Sylvester, that he (Madison) believed that the people feared one sect might obtain a pre-eminence, or two (Congregational and Anglican) combine and establish a religion to which they would compel others to conform.   (This is in context with what the letter from the Danbury Baptists to Jefferson was about, which we will discuss in a minute.)       On August 15, 1789, Samuel Livermore of New Hampshire, proposed the wording:    "Congress shall make no laws touching religion, or infringing the rights of conscience."         Other subsequent versions coming during Senate debate included the following:    "Congress shall make no law establishing religion, or to prevent the free exercise thereof, or to infringe the rights of conscience."      "Congress shall make no law infringing the rights of conscience, or establishing any religious sect or society."      "Congress shall make no law establishing any particular denomination of religion in preference to another, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, nor shall the rights of conscience be infringed."     "Congress shall make no law establishing one religious society in preference to others, or to infringe on the rights of conscience."        The final Senate version was,    "Congress shall make no law establishing articles of faith or a mode of worship, or prohibiting the free exercise of religion."         A joint committee of both the House and Senate then finalized the wording of this part of the First Amendment as follows:    "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."         On December 15, 1791, the Bill of Rights was finally ratified by the states. This was a declaration of what the Federal Government could not do, leaving the states free within the control of their own constitutions.       For further context, I refer you to the Northwest Ordinance. The Northwest Ordinance is ranked number four in importance relative to all Government documents, behind the Constitution, The Declaration of Independence, and the Articles of Confederation. Article III of the Northwest Ordinance reads as follows:    "Article III. Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary in good government, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged."         This statement presumes that public schools are proper and necessary to teach religion and morality which they did for over 200 years.       The Founding Fathers stressed the need for religion as the basis of morality. The first amendment is not about repressing religion. The first amendment is a footnote about what the federal government cannot do respecting religion, and insisting that the biggest thing government and society cannot due is inhibit the free practice of religion.       The Ten Commandments were taught for over two hundred years in our public schools. There were federal designations of publicly observed Days of Thanksgiving to God for special favors from God. Our national day of Thanksgiving was proclaimed and there were designations of National Prayer Days -- all routinely established down through our history.      The First Amendment, written in the same year as the Northwest Ordinance, could not possibly have meant anything like what today's judiciary say it means.       So where does the current confusion come from? Most of the current arguments for the separation between church and state are based around Thomas Jefferson's famous comment about a 'wall of separation between church and state'. However, that statement has been taken out of context in the pursuit of ridding the government of all references to God. The statement was made in a letter to the Danbury Baptists in response to a letter from them.       The Danbury Baptist Association, concerned about religious liberty in the new nation wrote to President Thomas Jefferson, Oct. 7, 1801. The original letter from the Danbury Baptists reads as follows:    "Sir, Among the many millions in America and Europe who rejoice in your Election to office; we embrace the first opportunity which we have enjoyed in our collective capacity, since your Inauguration, to express our great satisfaction, in your appointment to the chief Majestracy in the United States; And though our mode of expression may be less courtly and pompious than what many others clothe their addresses with, we beg you, Sir to believe, that none are more sincere.            Our Sentiments are uniformly on the side of Religious Liberty -- That Religion is at all times and places a matter between God and individuals -- That no man ought to suffer in name, person, or effects on account of his religious Opinions - That the legitimate Power of civil government extends no further than to punish the man who works ill to his neighbor: But Sir our constitution of government is not specific. Our ancient charter together with the Laws made coincident therewith, were adopted on the Basis of our government, at the time of our revolution; and such had been our Laws & usages, and such still are; that Religion is considered as the first object of Legislation; and therefore what religious privileges we enjoy (as a minor part of the State) we enjoy as favors granted, and not as inalienable rights: and these favors we receive at the expense of such degrading acknowledgments, as are inconsistent with the rights of freemen. It is not to be wondered at therefore; if those, who seek after power & gain under the pretense of government &amp; Religion should reproach their fellow men -- should reproach their chief Magistrate, as an enemy of religion Law & good order because he will not, dare not assume the prerogatives of Jehovah and make Laws to govern the Kingdom of Christ.           Sir, we are sensible that the President of the United States, is not the national legislator, and also sensible that the national government cannot destroy the Laws of each State; but our hopes are strong that the sentiments of our beloved President, which have had such genial affect already, like the radiant beams of the Sun, will shine and prevail through all these States and all the world till Hierarchy and Tyranny be destroyed from the Earth. Sir, when we reflect on your past services, and see a glow of philanthropy and good will shining forth in a course of more than thirty years we have reason to believe that America's God has raised you up to fill the chair of State out of that good will which he bears to the Millions which you preside over. May God strengthen you for the arduous task which providence & the voice of the people have cald you to sustain and support you in your Administration against all the predetermined opposition of those who wish to rise to wealth &amp; importance on the poverty and subjection of the people.           And may the Lord preserve you safe from every evil and bring you at last to his Heavenly Kingdom through Jesus Christ our Glorious Mediator.           Signed in behalf of the Association.          Nehh Dodge      Ephram Robbins The Committee      Stephen S. Nelson"        To which, Jefferson replied:    "To messers. Nehemiah Dodge, Ephraim Robbins, & Stephen S. Nelson, a committee of the Danbury Baptist association in the state of Connecticut.            Gentlemen           The affectionate sentiments of esteem and approbation which you are so good as to express towards me, on behalf of the Danbury Baptist association, give me the highest satisfaction. my duties dictate a faithful and zealous pursuit of the interests of my constituents, &amp; in proportion as they are persuaded of my fidelity to those duties, the discharge of them becomes more and more pleasing.           Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, &amp; not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should "make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," thus building a wall of separation between Church & State. Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties.           I reciprocate your kind prayers for the protection &amp; blessing of the common father and creator of man, and tender you for yourselves & your religious association, assurances of my high respect &amp; esteem."           Th Jefferson       Jan. 1. 1802         Inferring that Jefferson was saying that the state can have nothing to do with religion is proven false when the comments are looked at in their original context. All he was establishing is that the Congregationalists in the state of Connecticut cannot by virtue of being a majority church in that state infringe in any way upon the freedom of practice of their religion by the Baptists.       Thomas Jefferson also said:    "I am for Freedom of Religion, and against all maneuvers to bring about a legal ascendancy of one sect over another..."           "A more beautiful or precious morsel of ethics I have never seen; it is a document in proof that I am a real Christian; that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus."       "Of all the systems of morality, ancient or modern, which have come under my observation, none appears to me so pure as that of Jesus."       "Had the doctrines of Jesus been preached always as pure as they came from his lips, the whole civilized world would now have been Christians." "I have always said, I always will say, that the studious perusal of the sacred volume will make better citizens, better fathers, and better husbands.       1. The doctrines of Jesus are simple and tend to the happiness of man    2. There is only one God, and He is all perfect.    3. There is a future state of rewards and punishment.    4. To love God with all the heart and thy neighbor as thyself is the sum of all. These are the great points on which to reform the religion of the Jews."         Among many other things, Jefferson in establishing the University of Virginia, not only encouraged the teaching of religion, but set aside a place inside the Rotunda for Chapel services.       The issue of separation between church and state is a wholly modern creation. The Founders never intended to prohibit the practice of religion; in fact, they encouraged it, both publicly and privately.

       When I talk about left vs. right I am not talking about economic systems. The free market, when applied with the rule of law, is unbeatable as an economic system.       I am talking about the ideology for implementing social change. The 'left', as I am using the term (and as most conservatives do), profess a vision of social change, implemented by the wisdom of the few (i.e. them).       The left typically believes that what is lacking in the implentation of social change is will and power, not knowledge. The right typically believe that there is an inherent nature of things, which if it can be altered, humans don't have the knowledge or the wisdom to do so yet.       To touch on a few of the ideological differences:       The left believe that policies don't fail because of a faulty pretense for the policy, but instead because the plan was not implemented properly. You can see this when looking back over the failures of the war on poverty and the criminal justice reforms of the 1960's. The policies put in place failed miserably by any objective standard, and yet they are defended by saying that the measurements aren't fair because the policies weren't executed according to the vision. The right typically believe that common sense and systemic change are more effective for creating lasting social policy, and that the 'unfairness' that might result from those policies are unfortunate but unavoidable.       The left believe that there are 'solutions' to problems, such as crime, poverty, the environment, etc. These solutions are waiting to be put into place, and all that is lacking is the political power. The right recognizes that problems will never go to zero, and that any fix is inevitably a trade-off that might cause problems in another area. It boils down to which answer is the least distasteful.       The left believe that social correlations are proof of social causation; for example, loan rejection discrepencies for minorities are directly indicative of racism. The right believe that incentive structures within a system provide the basis / remedy for observed social phenomena. To use the previous example, if minority loan rejection is systemically occuring, there would be a lower level of profitability for banks who are rejecting otherwise qualified applicants. Similarly, this creates opportunities for banks to address this (underserved) niche because of the oppty for super-normal profits.       The left typically believe that economic costs in implementing policy is incidental. Ends justify the means especially when economic costs are concerned (e.g. "save the environment" = eliminate DDT, eliminate asbestos, etc.). The right believe those economic costs are crucial to the decision making process. The cost of "changing over" to a new system is critical in determining the value of the new system. (e.g. before DDT was eliminated, malaria had almost been eradicated. Within two years of the elimination of DDT, countries where malaria was endemic saw malaria cases rise back to or exceed previous levels. All of this when there was and is no conclusive proof that DDT was dangerous)       To paraphrase Thomas Sowell, the left vs. right discussion boils down to 'good intentions' vs. 'results, in the face of imperfect knowledge'
