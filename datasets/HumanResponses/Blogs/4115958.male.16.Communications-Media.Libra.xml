      Hooray! Hooray! Let there be party's in the streets, for Janapalooza is finally ready! It's been a long, arduous process getting Andrew to write his piece, but now we are ready to go! A temporary copy has been printed, and the format looks good. The cover graphic by Peter Sawatzky was an unexpected, but appreciated touch. There are individual pics to go along with the articles, but do to Cantins Security Systems unwillingness to print anymore pages then we had, the bare minimum was what we settled for. It lies out like this; cover graphic by pete, editors letter by moi, current events by Andrew, Haute Couture by whitey, Inside the mind of the fPete by the fPete, Music Reviews by moi et pete, movie review by Andrew, horoscopes by Owen, then the Haiku of the moment and advice with andrew. There you have it, the lay out is played out, now you should all get out and get this damn thing, so I don't look like an idiot who made many lazy people do minutes of work during their summer vacation, it would be a catastrophe! So email me, or at least get in contact if your in the least interested. My phone is 386-1917, email is  urlLink janshouse@hotmail.com . So go for it, get in on the ground floor, cause were gonna take this baby...TO THE MOON!
