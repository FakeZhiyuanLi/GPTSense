      Quote of the moment: "I couldn't be happier on my own, but I've got the slightest of a jealous bone and seein' her with him...tends to enlarge it." -Martina McBride  I saw my ex again today when I was taking my sister to the supermarket. That sucked. How can he still have such an affect on me? I talked to him online too tonight. He's still dating his bimbo. Terrific. Yet, if he asked me to, I'd date him  and  let him have his bimbo. How sad, ne? He told me how much fun they're having together, how much he likes her. I felt so shitty. Then he asked about my love life. I replied, "lol." Yah, that about sums it up.  Here's how it stands:  1) Seth, 22, pre-law student at the UofA. He's daringly handsome, and ridiculously rich, but. Yes, BUT, I don't like him. He's offered me everything, and I don't feel a thing. I even kissed him to check, not a single spark.  2) My ex, let's call him Lucifer, 19, Pima Community College student. I love him with every inch of my being. Heart, soul, body and mind. I'd die for him. BUT (that infamous 'but' again) he would rather date his 18-year-old whore.   I HATE MEN! THEY RUIN MY LIFE! I feel like such a bitch for not liking Seth, but I can't help it! And then, I'm still in love with my ex of several months who stole my spiritual virginity and my innocence and my heart and my sanity! Fuck him! Why can't I just take it all back! Damn him!  Well, aside from my love life, my best friend (my twin practically) is moving to Tejas in August and I'm dreading it. My entire family is pissed that I've signed up for the Air Guard because I'll be going to Iraq (most likely) and they don't want me to get raped (little do they know that it wouldn't be the first time) AND my grades haven't come in the mail yet. I have summer school starting Tuesday, damn. I start work on Monday, damn. I am sick of this. I just want to go to boot camp. Daily physical exhaustion sounds like bliss. I guess I'll start counting down the days...G'nite all.

       "A million words couldn't bring you back. I know because I've tried. And neither would a million tears. I know because I've cried."    Today has been terrible. So, I've decided to create this online journal because I have no one else I can tell this all to. I'm terrible. I talked to my ex-boyfriend recently on the phone. It was on wednesday night, it was torture. He told me that he and his girlfriend are on rocky ground. Instead of telling him how much I love him still and that I want him back, I slipped in to my 'best friend' mask and told him he'd be alright. I listened for two and a half hours. Then he said, "Good night Crystal, I'll always love you."    What the fuck?  We broke up about a month ago and I'm still not over it and here he is telling me he still loves me?! I am still head over fucking heels in love with him! He's clueless to the fact obviously and I am left to dream. Oh well. At least he feels better after talking to his 'best friend'. I can't get him out of my head! Everything reminds me of him. I can't be in my own room and not think of him! It's never going to end if he keeps calling me and telling me he loves me.     Now, what you all don't realize is that I love this man with all my heart and all my soul. I was certain we were going to get married and then all of a sudden he just up and left me for a stupid whore. He keeps telling me that he likes us both but if he likes us both, why isn't he with  me  since he was with  me  first. Oh well.     So I've got a couple weeks vacation before I have to start school again. I'm probably going to spend it going to parties and getting drunk so I can get him off my mind. Oh well. It's better than dreaming about him constantly like I do. I mean, right now, I'd take him back in an instant. How sad is that?     It hurts so much. I've cried myself to sleep a lot this week. The sad thing is, I was pretty much over him until last week or so. I don't know what happened, but it hurts so much. It's like the wound just opened again, I can't really say why. It's just ten times worse this time. Damn him. I'm going to go take some sleeping pills and go to sleep. Maybe that will help. Doubt it. I feel like I'm dying inside.

       Quote:   In my daughter's eyes I am a hero I am strong and wise and I know no fear But the truth is plain to see She was sent to rescue me I see who I wanna be In my daughter's eyes  In my daughter's eyes everyone is equal Darkness turns to light and the world is at peace This miracle God gave to me gives me strength when I am weak I find reason to believe In my daughter's eyes  And when she wraps her hand around my finger Oh it puts a smile in my heart Everything becomes a little clearer I realize what life is all about  It's hangin' on when your heart has had enough It's giving more when you feel like giving up I've seen the light It's in my daugter's eyes  In my daughter's eyes I can see the future A reflection of who I am and what will be Though she'll grow and someday leave Maybe raise a family When I'm gone I hope you see how happy she made me For I'll be there In my daughter's eyes ~"In My Daughter's Eyes" by Martina McBride     Entry:   Today is June 27th of 2004. Three years ago, I would've had my little girl. My Mariah would've been born. God, I just wish for one moment I could hold her. I saw a little toddler in Church on Saturday afternoon, she was about three. She had curly brown hair and big brown eyes and I wanted to just start crying. I watched the movie "Home Room" and two quotes hit me hard. One of them was, "When you're all alone and then you lose your baby" because that's exactly how I felt. I remember, having all these friends. Guy friends and girl friends, but when it came down to talking about it... I couldn't. I remember trying to talk to one of my friends, Kirby. The words literally wouldn't come out of the mouth. The other part was talking about when her baby died and she said something like "You know when you lose a newborn and you don't have anyone they give you a coffin. It's a styrofoam coffin, like a cooler for a picnic." I kept thinking how I didn't get anything but a phone call. It confirmed that the pregnancy was termintated. No, they didn't say that your father murdered your baby... They said "We're calling to inform you that your pregnancy was terminated." Sick bastards, don't even get me started.  I just want to hold her, if only once. My little girl... I never knew that maternal instinct could kick in this powerfully. I mean, I just want to take my baby girl in to my arms and hold her... I want it more than anything. Well, I guess I'll just comfort myself with that typical "God has a plan for everything" bullshit that I never believe and go on with life. Well, I really only have one thing left to say: If any of you who read this have kids, kiss them goodnight and tuck them in tonight. For me. Don't take them for granted, they're beautiful. A child is a beautiful blessing and I'd give the world to get mine back. Goodnight everyone, God bless.  Listening to: "In My Daughter's Eyes" By Martina McBride

       Quote:   "Its hard to answer the question 'What's wrong?' When nothing is right." -Anonymous    Entry:    Damn, I showed my dad the car on Saturday. (Someone hit my parked car in the school parking lot... Idiots.) He was less than pleased. Alright, he was furious. That did wonders for my self-esteem. My back is bruised pretty bad, and I've got a vibrant black eye. Oh well, make up works wonders sometimes. One of my best friends, Matt, almost ratted my dad out to the cops when he heard what happened. I'm afraid to tell him about my father anymore. The thing he doesn't understand is, my little sister thinks her father is a good man. From the point of view of growing up without a real father, I can say that I'd rather take his beatings and let my sister have a father than report him to the cops. Now, if he ever so much as yells at her, he's going to jail. I've got enough documented injuries at the doctor's office and I've started taking time-stamped photos for evidence. My family life isn't the only problem though.   My ex and I haven't talked in a while, and now I've started missing him all over again (oh brother!) but I should've seen that coming. I keep thinking about him, and I have no idea why! I can't even go a day without thinking of him. I've tried to stop, but I can't. I still pray for him every morning and night... He's still constantly on my mind during the day and he CONSUMES my dreams at night. He's everywhere. Oh well, it happens I guess, when you're in love.   Summer school is a total drag, the teacher's a friggin imbecile. She can't read and I could teach the damn class better than she does. I understand that the  students  in summer school are expected to be stupid, but the  teachers?  It's ridiculous. Oh well, only one more week and three days. Thank God.   Lastly, my nightmares came back. I had a terrible recurrance tonight... It was so vivid... Worse than I ever remember. I wanted to call my ex, he said he'd always be there for me. I didn't call him, I chickened out. Maybe I'll call him tonight, maybe not. Mariah's (my daughter's) birthday is coming up. June 27th. She'll be three... Or rather, she  would  be three. Damn him. Bastard, I hate my father.    Anyway, I have school in a few hours. Good night all! Sweet dreams (at least one of us should get some rest... I certainly won't.)

       Quote:  "People are to be loved; things are to be used."    Entry:  Wow. Talk about ruining someone's day. My mother turned a perfectly good Sunday afternoon in to hell for me in the course of one hour. That has to be some kind of record. We're getting new flooring in our hallway and living room and I saw a TV ad that said Lowes had some deal going on for flooring, so I told her. After church today, she decides to drag me (and my grandmother...don't get me started) with her. So, after forty-five minutes of telling her we couldn't afford the only thing she liked, she settled for  considering  another floor and we started to leave. Only, my crazy grandmother decided she needed to buy more rosebushes so my (very POed) mother and I sat in the car (in 100+ degree weather, mind you) and waited. Finally, ten minutes later, she comes out. I offer to help and my mom bitches at me for saying that I felt ill earlier. WHAT THE HECK WAS I SUPPOSED TO TELL HER? I'M GRIPPING MY STOMACH IN PAIN BECAUSE IT FUCKING TICKLES?! Oh my God. My family life is honestly the baine of my existance.  Here's a quick summary of my family:  Mom: Menopausal middle-aged woman with a permenant stick up her ass. She's impossible to please and even when I try as hard as I can to make sure that she knows both my sister and I love her, it's never good enough. She's over critical, over opinionated and basically isn't happy unless she's ruined your day.  Father: Abusive SOB. Enough said.  Oma (Grandmother who lives with us): A bit senial, but really rather intelligent and kind when you get to know her. Sweet, considerate and compassionate person. She's a democrat though, lol. She can play the senial old woman part very well though, and it drives me up a friggin wall.  Sister: Here's an enigma. Very mature for her age in some ways, yet totally immature in others. She's going through one of those 'phases' where her parents don't understand her and she wants to rebel against everything. Good for her, except Mother takes it out on me. All in all, not a bad relative at all, except when she's PMSing.  Well, I went to Victoria's Secret (shopping for lingerie always calms me down) and of course I bought all black (that's what you-know-who likes)AND my one escape from this hell, a girls' night at my best friend's house, was cancelled because her dad's sick. Now I'm really screwed. Anyway, I prayed for you-know-who again at mass this week. I have every week since it ended. I can't help it. I want him back, is that so wrong?

       Quote :  "No one is perfect until you fall in love with them."  and  "A true friend is one who overlooks your failures and tolerates your success!"    Entry:  Well, it's official. I'm in love again. Guess who with? HA! My ex. Curse it all! It just figures knowing me. I broke my toe. I jammed it bad at TEAM on Thursday, then I went home. My father was there, terrific. As if I wasn't sore enough. Well, he saw it and told me I was a baby and to hack it. When I told him to go to hell, he punched me in the stomach, knocking me down. He's one of those guys who's keen on holding his target down and torturing them. So, he held me down. Don't think I'll be wearing a bikini next time I go swimming, unless I find a large TUB of concealer. Then, he bent my toe over, breaking it. He told me I needed to grow up and learn how to deal with pain. My 'father' said that if I couldn't handle a broken toe, that I wouldn't do any good in the Air Guard. I called my ex, in tears. His father used to hit him too, so I told him everything. He's in EMT training and he told me what to do with my toe and he offered to come over. Of course, I told him not to. I probably would've slept with him again. God. Don't get me started with that one. So, yah, I'm pretty much in love with him again, it's official.  About quote two though. I have to tell you all that I have such great friends. I really do. I'm not sure I should use names but I will anyway. My best friend, Megan, she's been so great when I complain about my ex. We have so much fun together! It's great. She's like my twin sister. Everyone on TEAM (A church group I'm in) is great. Banjo, Shemp, Adam, Melissa...all of them are great. We played our game, Squid, yesterday for quite some time and it was so much fun. Playing that game with them all, I just noticed how much all of them mean to me. I really love them all. They've really helped me with everything. I love them all, I'd die for any one of them. And then there's Moe and DR who are like my second pair of parents. Or should I say, DR is the closest thing I've had to a Dad. Moe, she was there for me when my mom wasn't so I love her just as much as my mom. They're both so important to me. I'm so lucky. I love them all like family.  Oh, one last thing. I've decided to take a vow of chastity again. After I was raped, I pretty much didn't care what I looked like or what people thought of me. Recently, I've been considering it thouroughly and I've decided I will. I'm a VIP or VTM. (Virgin in Peace or Virgin until Marriage, both on Lifeteen.com) I guess it'll have to be a secondary virginity, but I've decided to be modest too. And I've given up swearing. I want to be as pure as I can for my husband. Right now, I think that may be my ex, but things change and while I know he'll accept me as I am, he also drives me to improve myself. So that's my newest mission. That, and mending my toe in time to hit the gym on Monday. Ha, oh well. G'nite all.  Song: "You're Not My God" by Keith Urban.

       Quote of the moment:  "Everyboday cries,everybody bleeds. No one ever said that life's an easy thing. That's the beauty of it, when you lose your way,close your eyes and go to sleep and wake up to another day." -'I Will Carry You' by Clay Aiken   Entry: Well, today I'm confused. I got kind of nervous about the whole Iraq thing, I guess it hit me when my friend from Colorado (he's in the Corp.) and he told me that he'd had to escort his best friend's body home from Iraq. That hit hard. I got pretty shaken up. Then, my ex gets online. Wow, great. So we start talking and I mentioned it. He tells me he knows I'm strong. That really meant so much to me because I may have a girly exterior, I work out and I ensure that I can protect myself. Well, I was basically in tears, but of course I won't admit it. So we talked about planes for a while. We covered all the good ones (F-16, Tomcats, Intruders, B-1, B-52, AC-130, DC-7) and that was fun. Turns out we'd talked for over an hour so he says he'll call me.  Shit. Why'd I have to say 'ok' to that? We talked for a long time, laughing and enjoying each other's company. Of course, I fall for him all over again. He laughs at my girlyness and how I love Victoria's Secret. We talked about school a bit. He sounded pretty tired, and I said I'd go because he sounded half-asleep. He responded "No. I'm not half-asleep. I'm all asleep." I could physically feel myself falling for him. Damn him. Finally, I told him since he was getting up at 5am that we should probably go to bed. (It's like 1:30) When I hung up, I was so close to saying "I love you." but I didn't. Thank God. I told him "sweet dreams" and when I hung up the phone I realized I'd called him dear, sweetheart and darling multiple times. I'm one of those girls who uses the word 'dear' a lot but darling? Never. Shit. Oh well. I guess that's the story of my life. He didn't mention his bimbo, lucky me. I would've started crying or something pathetic like that. Anyway, I think I should probably sleep some. I've got to get up around 6. (Of course I didn't tell him that when he asked if I had to get up early when he called.) Anyway, yah. G'nite all.

       Quote:   "...She used to think that love wasn't just a game/ Her feelings once came from the heart/ One day I gave her a wedding ring/ And one night I tore all those feelings apart/ With my alibis and lying eyes and all the best lies/ Lord, she heard them all/ She's been cheated on and pushed around and left alone/ Lord knows what I've put her through..." -A song that I knew the name to at one point     &nbsp;   Entry:   Well, I'm back from Vegas... Yay? Aw, hell, I don't know how I feel about that. I guess it was fun,  stressful , but fun. I went on roller coasters, flirted with life guards and got groped about eight times. Damn men. Oh well, I got to go to the Luxor. What a nerd, I went there for the soul purpose of exploring the architecture. Meh, I don't care anymore. I am a nerd I guess.   I read a particularly morbid Harry Potter Fanfic that put me in a rather damp mood. So I've started a Harry Potter story of my own. Maybe I'll post it here, maybe not. Regardless, you can see all my fanfiction at:  urlLink www.fanfiction.net/~taintedelf  It's not good, but it's not shit either. I got a major muse for my original, which is thrilling. I thought it nigh dead.&nbsp;   Back to Vegas, I got a cute necklace and some nice Steve Madden shoes. Yay. I loved the casinos. I hadn't seen the Aladdin since it was built, so that was a great surprise. The Mirage buffet was remodeled, it sucks now. Don't eat there. We stayed at the Excalibur (cute security guards!) and it was rather nice. Cold (in the casino), but nice.   I have to visit my dad on Saturday. I'm kinda' scared about it. He wants to teach me how to drive a manual, so maybe it won't be too&nbsp;bad. I hope. Aw, I don't care. He hits me, I'll hit him back.   I'll never complain about Tucson driving again, in Vegas... It's bloody insane! I got a migraine driving just four blocks. Bloody bastards. Half the city should have their licenses revoked. Permanently.   Well, I'm off to utilize my muse. She's been bouncing off the walls lately, it's bloody terrific. Off to write. Peace out.

       Quote:  "Aw, that lovely title, ex-president." -Eisenhower    AND    "Don't worry, because, in the end, everything tastes like chicken... And chiken... Tastes good." -Unknown     Entry:     Well, Government's over. I guess I'm happy about that. I got an A, thank God. We watched some good movies (i.e. The American President) and I enjoyed it. I'll miss the friends I made... Ah, c'est la vie. They were a nice change from the over-intelligent over-achieving, self-absorbed assholes I'm sick of from Decathlon though. I miss Casey alot, she was such a great decathlete but she graduated. She and Kirsten were really the only ones who weren't pompous. Now, I'm going to hate it. Kirsten Limon and Shanna Varcilo (spelling's terrible) are going to be on the team. I loathe them both with a passion. I've been working my ass off so I'll make the team though, I absolutely need that scholarship.    One thing that really pisses me off it Tye Bostick, okay, he's a person. The thing is, I hated him until we went on the Flagstaff trip. While we were there, I found out he's going to CatFoot next year instead of CDO. At first I was relieved, but then I started liking him and now I'm bummed about it. Stupid f***er. Oh well, that's life (and life sucks.)    Well, even though Megan couldn't go to Vegas with me, I think I'll have a good time. I'm looking forward to it. I'm going to meet some guys, I need that. I'm sick of being told that I'm pretty no matter what, that's so easy to see right through. I want to feel desirable. I need to feel like someone wants me... I'm not saying I'm going to go and get laid but I'll definitely be looking for some hot guys. The sun will be nice, and I am looking forward to the drive. Roadtrips are fun.    The Decathlon road trip was (more or less) very fun. It's only three hours to Flagstaff (and three hours back) but it was fun for the most part. The ride up was bumpy (literally and figuratively) but oh well. The ride home was a blast except for a few things. Our coach, Mr. Yetman, is so cool. Mrs. Yetman and I had a nice time watching her two sons while the rest of the class walked around the Meteor Crater. I miss her class, it makes me want to take Spanish I again, lol. She's such a sweet lady, and what I loved most is that she doesn't hold grudes (I was a bit of a cut-up in her class) and she doesn't judge people. When I mentioned certain things (i.e. alcohol) she didn't think any less of me at all. She gave me one of the most touching compliments. She told me that when she was talking with me at Meteor Crater that I was much more mature than I was sophomore year. She said that I have grown in to a beautiful, smart and brave young woman and that she'd be proud to have a daughter like me any day. Wow, that felt so good to hear. To be honest, I felt like crying.    I've been having a bit of a hard time with my self-esteem lately, and that really helped. Hell, just two days before she said that, I'd wanted to jump off a 35 foot cliff and never come up out of the water... I mean, people say that everyone should have self-confidence but I really don't think it does much good. I know I'm pretty and I know I'm smart (to an extent on both counts) but I don't feel any better for it. In reality, I feel worse. I feel like I'm failing to meet standards that should be no problem for someone who's smart and pretty. That compliment was so nice to hear, especially after constant insults to my intelligence on the trip.    I'll be honest, I act like a dork sometimes just for laughs but when people sit there and insult my intelligence when I do, it hurts. One girl, who I consider a good friend, really hurt me on that trip. I really felt insulted when she kept calling me a dork or making comments that I wasn't very smart. I read and I study and I love learning and that really hits a nerve. Mr. and Mrs. Yetman both see through the 'dumb blonde' facade (as does everyone else) so I  know  they aren't fooled but when this girl insults me... It hurts.    I'm not the type to be easily offended or to care very often but there's just something about the way she says it all the time that hits hard. I mean, I can usually take quite a beating. I only have two week points: religion and my morals (mainly modesty) and yet she never really attacks either. Yet, she still manages to irk me. OH well, I'll save that for future pondering.    To bring this to a sort of conclusion, I read another blog today that talked about emotional masochism... And as I read it, I realized that I might just be one in the same. An emotional masochist, I like it when people emotionally hurt me... Hmm... I'll get back to you on that one. Until later, peace out.    God bless,  Kirael

        Quote:      "Destiny is not a matter of chance, it is a matter of choice; it is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved." -William Jennings Byran      Entry:   Well, the Decathlon team went to Flagstaff. I missed my boy a ton, but it was fun. Studied, watched two of the cutest boys ever and got in to several heated debates. It was stressful though and I remember why I quit last year. It's the people, not the material. Oh well. I'll get over it, I need that scholarship. I've decided I'm going to NAU in Flagstaff. I can get a scholarship and get in the honors dorms, which is very good.   I'm taking government now, it's almost over. Thank God, I need a break. I mean, the class is fun (who ever would've thought you could earn credit for watching Law and Order?) but I need sleep. Bad. Eh, c'est la vie. Oh, that reminds me, I haven't decided on next years schedule yet.  I'm taking: Honors Spanish III, Academic Decathlon, Psychology and Biology/PE. I need one more class and i can't decide between choir or French I. I'm going to audition for regional choir and American Idol this year so I guess I should choose choir but in reality, I'm going to be a cop... Fuck singing, I need more languages to get in the to FBI. I'm so confused, shit. Oh well, screw it all.  I'll figure it out the day of classes, lol.  This Thursday I'm going to Vegas! YAY! I can't wait. I plan on getting terribly drunk, finding some random hot guys to make out with and shopping until my bank card is broken. That's the life. We're staying at the Excalibur, it'll be so much fun! I'm so excited! The shopping and tanning are what I most look forward to. I need a tan, but my thighs are getting a bit too big, I haven't been exercising enough. Eh, oh well.  All in all, I have a pretty okay few weeks. A few mom issues and I'm going to kill my dad but other than that, it's good. I'll leave you with the lyrics to my new favorite (extremely depressing) song.    Listening to:     Artist: Paisley Brad (Featuring Alison Krauss) Title:Whiskey Lullaby   She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette She broke his heart he spent his whole life tryin' to forget We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind Until the night  He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger And finally drank away her memory Life is short but this time it was bigger Than the strength he had to get up off his knees We found him with his face down in the pillow With a note that said I'll love her till I die And when we buried him beneath the willow The angels sang a whiskey lullaby  (Sing lullaby)  The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath She finally drank her pain away a little at a time  But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind Until the night  She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger And finally drank away his memory Life is short but this time it was bigger Than the strength she had to get up off her knees We found her with her face down in the pillow Clinging to his picture for dear life We laid her next to him beneath the willow While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby  (Sing lullaby)
