      So Guy sent me an email bitching about an encyclopedia entry that he has to edit for this comprehensive encyclopedia of folklore (from 20,000 words to 5000), and it reminded me of these two really cool websites, that bring being-an-authority-on-something to the masses:   1)  urlLink Wikipedia : This is an online encyclopedia that's free, and updatable. You can simply click on edit and fix any errors on the site in html. You can also see revision histories for all of the files, and links to articles that need to be written. Pretty interesting that no one person oversees it, but that it gets overseen and corrected by the network itself. Hypertexted, you can sit an follow links on this thing forever. "Wiki" incidentally is a Hawaiian word which means "super-fast" refering to the speed of editing (essentially in real time).  2)  urlLink H2G2 : The guide to life, the universe, and everything predates wikipedia by about a year, and some of the original boss-type guys jumped ship and came to wiki.  This site is more about community building, and includes opinion pieces and random stuff. Check out this story on  urlLink cargo cults .  Obviously I had several patient cancellations this morning....

      And you should too.  1)  urlLink This Modern World.  Tom Tommorrow's out, but Bob Harris writes some pretty topical stuff.  2)  urlLink die puny humans  "The filthy monkey, it plans." Warren Ellis is one of my all time favorite comics writers, mostly because he has an eye for balls-to-the-wall science fiction/sex/religion/politics mash-ups (see esp "Transmetropolitian" and "Two-Step."). Anyway he keeps me updated on NASA and the porn industry.  3)  urlLink Eschaton.  This Modern World has lots of links to stories here. Great portal into the Liberal Blogsphere.  4)  urlLink Search and Destroy.  If you were watching this, you would have seen the post in which Rall commented on Reagan being "all black and crispy right now," inflaming the right wing and ending with Rall on Hannity and Colmes defending himself. I'm reading his Gas War right now, which is about the oil pipeline in Afghanistan.

      "Access to the URL: http://www.mnftiu.cc/mnftiu.cc/home.html has been denied. This URL is presently categorized as Politics/Religion."  This is new. I just looked at this last month. At least it's not more Humor.

       urlLink A softer world   So simple, yet so cynical and funny. Honestly everyone check this out and click "Back". I especially love the zombie attacks, and  "Dear Mr. President, Your time is almost up. Love, Baby Doom. p.s. diaper prices are ridiculous" from August 1, 2003.

       urlLink "We are reviewing the issue to determine what steps need to be taken to secure the election," says Brian Roehrkasse, a Homeland spokesman.    Posted by Drudge.  This scares the hell out of me.

      ...has a very funny solicitation in Diamond Previews.  ""Vampires. What have they become? Effeminate fang-bearing prissy types wearing billowy shirts and velvet suits that would embarrass a gay pirate. Mostly the Goon just straps them to the hood of his car and sets them on fire."   I love this Eric Powell guy.

      At Guy's goading, here goes. Guy, I think was getting pretty sore at me for flooding his inbox with all types of internet links, etc. So instead i'll post here, if anybody actually gives a damn. Not exactly sure what my topics, etc. will be. But everyone's invited.   Kind of a milquetoast first post.   So much to learn.  Hinton
