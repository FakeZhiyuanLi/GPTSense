      In the past couple of weeks, the 6 announced their fall line-ups.  Now, word is starting to leak out... could it be that ABC has an artful, dramatic hit on it's hands?       Comparing a TV show to   urlLink Twin Peaks   is something I don't take lightly and I've now read 3 different sources that give that credit to    urlLink Desperate Housewives   .  Maybe it's because  Sheryl Lee (Laura Palmer from  Twin Peaks )shows up dead in the first episode, who knows... but it's a reason for me to tune out  L&O: Criminal Intent  for a night and hop over to ABC land.  The rest of cast isn't too shabby either, including  Teri Hatcher  and  Felicity Huffman .  And while possibly my York roots are to blame, but nothing gives me more satisfaction that watching the skeletons of small town come out and the neurotic lives of middle aged women unfold.  If   Stepford Wives   does well at all this summer, it's sure to give a boost to   Desperate  , even though, there is no real correlation.  For more details, check out   urlLink AICN's pilot review  .

      Whether Bush's numbers have dropped too low and he's trying to scare us, or our "intelligence" agencies really are that inept, be advised, it's coming.       5 months to go, and suddenly there is a solid and eminent threat against  America.  Do I believe this administration is "Wagging the Dog"?  Not at all.  But, I think this is proof that partisan politics, the patriot act, and vicious attacks at liberals and non christians don't make us any safer.  This week, Ashcroft announce that we should fear because 7 really really really really bad guys were here.  It could be this weekend, 4th of July, or Election Day, but beware, it's coming.  Aparently, it's so close and there is nothing that the FBI, CIA, Mr. Ridge, and the like can do... so instead, they now come to me and you.  Help us! Help yourself!  Save your country!  Kill all muslims! .. no, wait, they didn't say the last one outloud.  Ashcroft made the statement that, "After the March 11th attack in Madrid, Spain, an al Qaeda spokesman announced that  90 percent  of the arrangements for an attack in the United States were complete."  Chris Rock says that there are three kinds of people, the really smart people, the really dumb people, and most of the people in the middle, the b and c people, like our president.  An oligarchy is sounding pretty good now, huh?  It's those people, the B's and C's, that are going to bring this country down.  They champion putting "a boot up someone's ass" (Toby Keith just won entertainer of the year!), they buy gas guzzling cars then blame enviromentalists for the cost of gas increasing.  Now, I buy no means think that anyone should die, especially innocents.  I'm an American, but I do not support my government. I am most definately an elitist, but still and American.  That doesn't matter to the blindly angry.  I am an American, whether it's me or W, it's all the same to the "evil doers". I don't think terrorists understand Red States and Blue states... and certainly not purple.  They attacked New York as a symbol of America.  New York, the most liberal, diverse, and tolerant place in our whole country.  If they were concerned about who believed what, they would attack Alabama and California would be the safest place in the country.  Let's stop finger pointing. Stop living in denial.  Stop being a victim.  Stop crying.  Stop charging.  Stop hating.  Oust our leaders.  Use the 8-12% of the brain God gave you.  VOTE!

         This week, the  urlLink trailer for   Alexander   , my most anticipated film of 2004, was released online.  Directed by dark and turmoiltuous  Oliver Stone ,  Alexander  stars a toeheaded  Colin Ferrel  in the title role and  Angelina Jolie , both pictured above.  Stone is no stranger to bio pics, especially one's of political nature ("back and to the left").  While I'm sure  Alexander  will stray from historical accuracies to add more tragic controversial drama, I know Stone will avoid any glossy tones (unless it's glossy toned bodies).  No one get's down and dirty like Stone.

      The watchdog site  urlLink Congress.org  is reporting a reinstitution of the draft.  Not just rumours but an actuall bill declaring that anyone, male and female, 18-26, are considered.  College is no longer a refuge and neither is Canada due to an international agreement signed.  Looks like Mexico, brush up on your spanish and break out the shot guns, now it's our generation being asked to fight Bush's holy war.  If you don't vote, better start!

         Yes it's the end of an era Phish Phans!  After saying good-bye to some great TV and saddly listening to Madonna's latest record... I am happy to say that this is the best ending I can think of.  By September, Phish will be no more.  Done, over... and no there not more in the sea.  HAHAHA... quite possibly the most annoying band in the history of music fanatics is down... down with the jam and the breaking of the band!   P.S. There is no word yet from B & J as to the fate of the fabulous Phish Food Flavor.

      While the Mutant Enemy (Buffyverse) writing team is spreading out, the best bit of news is that Jane Epson is leaving Gilmore Girls to join  Tru Calling  next season.  While the stories may still suck, Jane will with no doubt ensure the writing will be witty and might even through in a little Buffy-speak... this news makes Tru "five by five."  The crew from Ain't It Cool News has also reported the many whereabouts of numerous Mutant Enemy alums including  Alias, Smallville, The O.C., The Sheild , and the unaired  Still Life  for fox created by the best and the brighest, Marti Noxon.  There is also the homeless  Wonderfalls  as well.  For a full list and details, visit the boys at  urlLink Ain't It Cool .     For actual sunnydale action, the WB is still reportedly going ahead with  Buffy: The Animated Series .  According to Alyson Hannigan's mom in an Atlanta newspaper, Hannigan will reprise the role of Willow doing voice recordings after she wraps up her London performances in the West End.  So long  Americana  and NBC. .

         Steven Saunders, this seasons big bad evil doer, is dead, Jack, the President, and Kim all made it through alive, and the world is still here.  At least, until Day 4 brings an all new threat.  Last night, 24's day 3 came to an end.  Jack contained the virus in a middle school teacher's lounge.  Granted he had to chop off Chase's hand to get it there.  Proving there is nothing this man won't do for "god and country."  Tony, on the other hand, proved there isn't anything he wouldn't do to protect his wife.  For that, he is being brought up on treason charges.  The Miliken scandle came to an end as President Palmer withdrew his bid for a second term.  In the last seconds, where Nina shot Terry in season 1, where Palmer was bio-attacked in season 2, Jack cried.  Yes, that was the privotal and anti-climactic closer to day 3... Jack cried.    6/10  So, what does day 4 have in store?  New president obviously.  Nina and Sherry are dead so no first season throwbacks anymore.  Ryan Chappell is dead so no snide order barking from division.  Tony is apparently going to jail for a long long time if not being executed for treason (Palmer needs to exonerate him... I love Tony!).  Kim got very little play this season, so, I'm looking for her to get lost in Afganastan or something of that nature next season.  Chase is a hottie mini-Jack, and without Tony, is destined to be the new candy coated side kick. ... or so that's what I thought!  PSH! According to Eonline, 24 pink slipped Carlos Bernard (Tony Almeda), his onscreen wife Reiko Aylesworth (Michelle Dessler), and James Badge Dale, Timberlake-esque Chase Edmunds.  Cuthbert (Kim) has been dropped down to an even more minor character so she can work on films.  (kill her off, please please kill her off!) Of everyone, Dennis Haysbert (Palmer) has not been fired.  Oh no, is this yet another 3rd season peak (Dawson's Creek, Buffy, Angel, ER, The Practice, etc.) Oh well, here's to January 2005...

       .   From teen titan, to scrapy vamp, ghetto fabulous, and gothic powerhouse, Christina Aguilera has donned many different looks since 1999, most of which were massive disasters.  But now, as the dirrty girl grows up, she's using her sex to seduce instead of repulse us.  She also bares a striking resemblence to Mira Sorvino, at least I think so.

       urlLink       Troy: 7/10 by Scarlett & 4/10 by D     Troy  , minus the wooden horse and arrow through the heel, bared little resemblance to  The Illiad , Homer's epic poem.  That with standing, Peterson, delivered an exciting epic in now standard obscene proportions (thank you  LOTR  and  Matrix Revolutions ).  Peterson's adaptation focuses more on the showdown between Achilles and Hector than Odysseus.  Troy also focuses on a battle of men verses a battle of the god's on the playing field of men.  In fact, the gods were constantly mocked. Priam's (Peter I don't get what all the hype is about O'Toole) devout belief is pin pointed as the tragic flaw and cause of the fall of Troy (Mr. Bush anyone?).  In fact, for many thousands of years, all but the Greeks believed this story a myth, only in the passed century was it proven to be history.  As with all history, the facts are simply decoration to grand stories of motivation, glory, and faith.  Yes there is war between Sparta (and the other Greek's) and the Trojans ignited by a woman... yes there is a large wooden horse... yes, there is also a showdown of heroes. And while the names remain the same, and actual plot points, the "why" is what is different.  When telling a story of war, the why makes all the difference.       The casting of this movie was quite odd.  While Eric Bana shines as Hector and Brad Pitt glistens (literally) as Achilles the rest of the cast is quite odd.  Orlando Bloom seems only cast as Paris because Peter Jackson had him superbly trained as an archer for his role of Legelos in the   Lord of the Rings  .  Paris's most important role in the story is to strike down Achilles with an arrow.  I see Peterson watching LOTR and thinking, "that actor really knows how to uses a bow... i shall make him Paris." Bloom must refrain from taking roles that involve him to use a bow and arrow for at least 5 years... preferably longer. (Fingers crossed in Kingdom of Heaven he weilds a sword) Paris should be more sleazy than pretty, more weak, greedy, and slimy than heroic (think Jude Law)... but this isn't  The Illiad .    The biggest casting flaw is that of Diane Kruger, who certainly is not a "face that launched a thousand ships" as Helen of Troy is historically known.  When casting for a woman known as the most beautiful woman in the history of the world, Miss Kruger is not who comes to mind. It's not that she isn't beautiful, it's that she is nothing on screen. In fact, throughout this film she seems to be channeling Lelei Sobieski more than Helen of Troy.  My number one pick for Helen, Charlize Theron.  The lady must look like a goddess, glow like an angel, and radiate lust.  Diane Kruger is not that lady, even her co-star, Saffron Burrows, would have made a much better bombshell than Miss Kruger.      With an epic story, ancient history, and glowing bodies, Troy lives somewhere between  Ben Hur  and  Caligula . While the story stucture has an odd flow, and there is no loyal tie to  The Illiad , Troy, overall, is worth the polyester celluloid it's printed on and the cost of a ticket.   7/10     Diane Kruger's lackluster Helen of Troy    As for Darren: 4/10    Even with an impressive cast and crew, this is a standard and energyless retelling of The Iliad. Featuring dull just-about-everything, from the cliched script to the "we're here for our paycheck" acting.  Though it boasts three fine specimens of man candy, all have looked better in other films: Pitt in everything else, Bana in Black Hawk Down and Bloom in Pirates of the Caribbean.  Credit either the makeup or cinematography.  Only one scene livens things up: the fight between Achilles and Hector.  Everything else lacks, ahem, muscle.  Aussie Bana is the hottest man in the cast, far outhotting the "woah dude" Achilles Pitt plays, and the "why am I here?" Bloom.  Diane Kruger is pretty, but nothing out of the ordinary. Shoulda gone with someone like Uma Thurman, Kate Winslet or Angelina Jolie.  I was really looking forward to this over Alexander but now I think that film will be far superior.  And was that the score from Jaws I heard in the one scene.  Jeez, so much for fresh storytelling.

      On Saturday night,  urlLink   Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911   , stole the show, and the Palm d'Or at the Cannes Film Fest.  I'm sure that Sean Hannity will now declare that this film and this prize is evidence of the fanatical French and the Hollywood liberals conspiring to down a decent president and hurt middle class American (you know, the kind that want to "put a boot in your ass").  Of course, on the other side, one can now point to this decent film award a prize by  Tarentino and jury, not just the French, is critically acclaimed and is lacking distribution for solely political concerns.  Welcome to Bush's America.  Don't worry, i'm not going to go on and on about how Bush is too irresponsible and un-edumacated to be a republican and too zealous and stubborn to be a democrat.  I just find it odd that in Bush's moral America,  The Real Cancun  can find distribution, and  The Swan  can find a home on tv, but when it comes to a powerful message through the media, you better be speaking at midnight, on cable, or overseas.  We need to get  Fahrenheit 911  to the people, the one place where Mr. Rove doesn't want it.

      With grace, beauty, and gothic pride, Angel came to an end tonight.  So, to give credit where credit is due, this was the most powerful and brilliant Angel season finale ever, yes, ever.  Fittingly, Joss saved the best for last.  Dare I say this is best Whedon finale since "The Gift" which also capped season 5 of BTVS and the end of that shows run on the WB.     .   (Spoiler Warning)  The wolf, the ram, and the hart (Wolfram & Hart)- the all encompassing evil that manifests itself on this realm through law firms - brought down the thunder (and Dragons) as Angel and crew took out evil's brightest and best.  As predicted, the non humans came through, Angel, Spike, Conner, and Illyria.  Gunn, kind of made it, at least until the closing credits, but his wound leads our mind down the inevitable path of death.  Wesley, in bravado that this rogue demon hunter rarely got to show, gave his life for the cause.  In fact, it was the only ending fitting for Wesley Wyndam Price.  Left with nothing to live for (a dead mother, and hateful father, and all loves now dead) Wesley goes head to head with the most powerful warlock this side of hell.  To quote, he "craps stronger magic" than what Wes can muster. Making his last stand and accompanied by a final skull shattering punch from Illyria, the AI team won out. Wes left this plane in the arms of Fred (or Illyria's illusion of her) and knowing his part in the apocolyse is done.    ***** (10/10)  Cliffhanger:  Yes "Not Fade Away" left our characters in uncertain peril, but look at the series.  Season 1 ended with Lidnsey's resurrection of Darla, Season 2 with the team returning from Pilea, a hell dimension with crazy Fred, Season 3 with Cordelia ascending to God status and Connor sinking Angel to the bottom of the Ocean, and Season 4 with the take over of W & H (Evil, Inc.)  So, why change a formula that has worked so well before?  And for the Shanshu?   Is it Spike or Angel.. Well, Angel signed off on the prophecy denouncing any role.  That lets the window open for Spike, but then again, contracts signed in blood have to have a loop hole too.    The world is saved once again, right?  Well, actually no.  Angel initiated the apocalypse, (he's had practice before in "The becoming, part II") the battle wasn't avoided and certainly not won.  That's in Joss's  Serenity  occupied hands now.       Amy had to let the Fred inside her die this year as she evolved into Illyria.    Future... after watching this season and saying good-bye to Buffy last year, the best course to keep the Buffyverse alive (really alive, not just fan fiction or plots I can imagine) is a feature film, Illyria.  Let SMG and David go on to other projects.  David especially has been working in this world longer than any of them, even SMG herself.  Let the next generation take over.  A brilliant story with Illyria, the leather clad super vixen, could exist successfully without needing years of TV backstory.  To those of us who know the origin, it would ad familiar ties.  Plus, look at the pre-existing fan base.  To Illyria (and beyond)!

      In a society dominated by litigious citizens, a lack of personal accountability, and the parental doctrine that we are all special, Paula "Hackneyed American Idol Feel-Good Judge" Abdul has popped up in two ridiculous stories today.  According to  urlLink  E!Online    Abdul is suing a nail salon over a "botched manicure that allegedly led to a severe infection."  She claims that near nearly lost her thumb from the incident.   .   If that weren't enough  urlLink E!Online  is also reporting that Miss Paula apparently stormed out of Tiffany's because she couldn't afford a pair of $10k earrings and expected to be given them for free because of her "celebrity" status.  When the manager firmly rejected her demands, she huffed and she puffed and in the long run, didn't get her way.  Awe, poor C list celebrity.

        urlLink City of Angel Synopsis for "Not Fade Away":   Angel & Company spend the day as if it were their last as they prepare to bring down the evil Circle of the Black Thorn. Putting their lives on the line, Spike confronts a demon cult, Lorne faces off with Lindsay (Guest star Christian Kane), Gunn takes on an evil senator and Angel battles Hamilton (Guest star Adam Baldwin), the henchman of the Senior Partners.    .    Okay, I'll be the first to admit this season, the fifth and final, of Angel is mondo weak.  With some stand out episodes, quite possibly the best the of series, "Thank You" and "Smile Time", the season as a whole lacked an overall driving arc that draws you in.  At 10 p.m., it will all be over.  I'm more angry at how this season was handled then the cancellation itself.  I mean as the Matrix so obviously tells us, "Everything that has a beginning, has an end."  I think and believe that had Joss and company known that this was the last, a little more care would have been tossed into each episode.  Just look at the 7th season of Buffy.  There was very little light and fluffy.  Everything, every breath and every moment drove home the fact that a battle of apocalyptic proportions was imminant.          Far more than a shadow of Buffy, Angel tackled a darker 20 something world in gritty L.A.  The evolution of the Brooding Buffy Beefcake, into a powerful compassionate and sometimes selfish vampire with a soul, issues, and sense of humor, was beautiful to watch.  Whether Angel was singing "Mandy", playing with his infant son Connor, or getting giddy around Cordelia, this series allowed for exquisite character development that would have been inhibited had the character remained in Sunnydale.  Cordelia undoubtedly evolved the most from shop til you drop uber bitch on Buffy, to the gorgeous warrior who was turned into a goddess.  Just as with Buffy, the peak of this show was the second and third seasons.  Both are now out on DVD, so buy 'em     James Marsters may make his final appearance as Spike tonight.   In fact, while debating whether it will be Spike or Angel that possibly shanshus (some old dialect for "to live, to die, to be reborn") tonight, the correlation between Cordelia and Buffy as the great love of Angel's seems all the more obvious as the great Spike/Angel issue loomed over the end of  Buffy .  Buffy and Angel both had there powers thrust upon them and fight for duty.  Both want to be normal people and would trade in there superpower in a second.  Buffy gets her wish in the series finale, to be like every other girl.  Will Angel get his tonight?  Throughout the seasons, Spike and Cordi both evolved from flat lesser characters into great warriors.  Spike searched for his soul (literally) enduring trial and tribulation not to mention giving his life to save the girl he loved and turn the tide of the fight.  Cordi, not gifted with slayer strength, wield an ax or sword like the best of them.  She endured long, hard, and sexual tension filled hours training with Angel.  In the end, she gave her life to help save Angel, the boy she loved.  Okay well there was that one time she had sex with Angel's adult son and gave birth to a hellgod, but hey, we've all done things we regret.  So, as I longed for Joey to choose Pacey over Dawson so few years ago, tonight, I hope that Spike gets just treatment and the respect of the Buffyverse.(He's already died, technically twice.  Hey, that has him tied with Buffy.)  And please, someone put Wesley out of his misery.   Amy Acker as Illyria:   .    SIDE NOTE: While not a feminist, I must say, in a Universe where women had all the power, Buffy, Willow, Anyaka (As a demon), Glory (Glorificas), Darla, Drucilla, Faith, Jasmine, and CORDELIA ( Angel  Cordi not  Buffy  Cordi) oh to mention a few, the show has turned into quite a boys club.  Even Eve was replaced with a more manly manifestation in Hamilton.  Lilla, the ultimate bitch, was hacked last season.  In fact, Illyria, the only remaining "female" a really old hell god bent on universal domination, was subjected to a laser to limit her powers.  Now, Hamilton can beat her up at will.  Is Joss having martial issues?  Evolving as a spin off of Buffy the Vampire Slayers, who's mantra was "this girl has power",   Angel   has dived into dark misogyny.  Maybe it is time to end, before it gets any worse at least.

      FOX has introduced numerous  urlLink schedules  to advertisers and the trades this week all of which has my head spinning.  I mean, I would like to watch some of these shows, if I could only figure out when they are on.  Okay, so,   The O.C.   could move from Wednesdays to Thursdays at 8 p.m. which would solve the thursday night dilema.  This would also force a move with WB's   The Mountain   to relocate to Wednesday at 9 p.m. (thus making Angel's demise slightly more just).  While we've all heard that   Family Guy   is likely to return thanks to hot ratings on the cartoon network and DVD sales, most likely, March is the soonest we could expect.  Good news is the FG creators also have   American Dad   slated to debut around the same time.    The worst news of all, is a delay in   24   til 2005.  It was a dumb move for ABC to pull this with   Alias   and even dumber for Fox to make this move with   24  ... not to mention shifting it's day and time to Mondays at 9 p.m. which would put it up again   Las Vegas   on NBC and Raymond on CBS, and some crap on ABC.  While the day move means I might have something of interest to watch on Monday nights, the January move is unfair.  I'm an American damit... don't tell me patience is a virtue!  And a scary "Arrested" development in scheduling also arises... where is   Arrested Development  ?  It's been given the go ahead, yet it has not scheduling position.  Fox, Fox, Fox... How I long for those simple summer seasons of 90210 at the beach where things were easy, simple, and predictable.

      No big surprises here.  Guess what, following in the footsteps of the Law & Order Team, CBS has introduced yet another CSI, and guess what, CSI NY is scheduled against the original Law & Order at 10 p.m. on Wednesday nights.  It's so hard to choose which New York Crime drama to watch, oh my!  Anyway, except for maybe tuning into CSI on Thursdays now that Will and Grace has been bumped up for The Donald, CBS still has nothing to offer me.  Go out for a martini or tune into cable, but Thursday has lost all the appointment t.v. hype it once held.  (Oh, just make sure you're home in time for E.R.)   urlLink Click here to enjoy the full schedule

          urlLink SHREK 2 -- 6/10   Splendid animation, wonderful voicework, the Mission: Impossible, E! and Cops parodies barely keep this sequel afloat.  After a solid first 20 minutes that continues the magic of the original, the sequel introduces convoluted plotlines that are only thinly covered up by clever fairy tale jabs.  It matches the irreverance of the first, but loses all of the charm.  It, however, is still an enjoyable and fast paced 93 minutes of fun, though entirely forgettable.  Also, I feel that while he wasn't annoying, the character of Puss-In-Boots really takes away for Donkey.  And a nice Justin Timberlake reference for Cammie.   The trailer for The Terminal was attached to this.  I think that movie will, ahem, fly high.  Something about this movie already has me hooked.  Shark Tale was also on, and while its not a very good trailer, the voice team (Will Smith, Angelina Jolie, Renee Zellweger, Jack Black, Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese) is almost more impressive than Shrek.   -D

For those of your who have been following the Disney dump of the film, there is good news on the  distribution  front.  According to the article, the brothers  urlLink Weinstein  are in the process of assembling the widest possible pre-election distribution.  YAY, Harvey and Bob!

      And then there was 1  Tonight Julia Milikan shot Sherry Palmer during the last few seconds of  urlLink 24 .  The second bitch of the season to bite it, Nina kicked it long ago, that leaves hope that Kim might finally get her up commin's - for being the stupidest character ever - during the season finale next week.  Although, that's highly unlikely seeing a majority of male viewers like the occasional eye candy.    Okay let's check in on the toll thus far:  Sherry Palmer Julia Milikan Alan Milikan Nina Myers Ryan Chapell Giel  Not to mention a whole list of evil doers and innocents in the Chandler Hotel.  Keep in mind, Tony, who is now on trial for treason, took a bullet to the neck. Chase was violently tortured south of the border.    Jack... JACK... is supposed still suffering withdraw symptoms from a nasty heroin addiction, although this hasn't been touched on for hours except for a slight mention of it tonight.  Regardless, tonight was an excellent episode setting up the heartpounding final hour of 24.

      As if the loss of  Buffy ,  Angel , and  Dawson  wasn't enough for the WB, it seams as if everything was in vain.  WB's Fall Schedule urlLink   is the weakest it's been since the before time, the long, long, ago, before the buffyverse was born (circa 1996).  WB is keeping their Monday and Tuesday night solid.  Wednesday, where the   Angel   gap is, where   Dark Shadows   was to emerge or maybe even   Wonderfalls  , is a show called Blue Collar TV.  OH... MY... GOD.... This is a show described as "a Hee-Haw-like sketch comedy show from Fax Bahr & Adam Small (Mad TV, The Jamie Kennedy Experiment) starring Jeff Foxworthy."  If ever the acronym WTF deserved to be used, it surely is now.  In fact, the only 2 shows which remotely provoke my interest,   Jack & Bobby  , based on the Kennedy family and   The Mountain   from the O.C. team.  Jack & Bobby is slated for Sunday night, which as you can tell from my earlier post, has no room for additional man candy.  The Mountain is scheduled for Thursdays at 8 and since I don't give a flying F*ck about the character Joey, maybe I'll tune in... or maybe I'll find something more constructive to do.  You know, like they did in the long, long ago, before the box.

      While there is pretty much nothing on ABC besides the Oscars that perks my interest.  As a former  Practice  watcher, I can't wait for  Fleet Street , the  James Spader  "The Practice"  spin off.  Mmmm... James Spader.     .   In a world dominated by carbon copy criminal drama and reality drabble, the casted headed by Mr. Spader and including Cap'n Shatner is the only must see new tv that has me drooling like a hound dog for September.  Fleet Street is keeping the Sunday 10 p.m. time slot, but unfortunately has lost any kind of Alias lead in because ABC is pushing it back to 2005. YO ABC... get a clue!  When you are last and lost in network tv land, you don't push back your cult hit Sunday night staple staring the  Jenny Garner , new darling of hollywood, for 6 nights of Extreme Makeover and a show called  Desperate Housewives  (aka a poor man's American Beauty).  If there is anything that needs an Extreme Makeover it's ABC (not to mention the whole Disney conglom).  That said, personally I won't miss Alias because I'll be too busy drooling over Mr.  D'Onfrio  over on NBC's L&O:CI.  Oh Sunday's will be divine filled with mancandy and actual  WRITING .

      Bill Mahr, formerly of Politically Incorrect, now of  urlLink HBO's Real Time , and my personal hero, today  urlLink emailed the employees of Columbia University .  He condemned the pretigious school: "Tossing millions of dollars of tax money out the window is one thing—think searching for ice on Mars—but wasting money to cause strokes in, disfigure, and terrorize animals puts Columbia in an ugly and embarrassing position."  Regardless of whether you eat steak and potatoes or soy and tofu, whether you wear leather or fur, and if you believe hunting is cruel or humane, the situation occuring at Columbia is beyond reasonable debate.  According to Mahr, "Poe in a morphine-induced nightmare couldn’t have dreamed up anything as scary as this." From in utero surgeries, to lodging metal rods through skulls, to enducing strokes by popping out eyes, these primates are enduring a tortuous hell that doesn't seem to benefit humanity in anyway besided giving us an outlet for violence.    These are not medical experiments to find cures for Cancer, AIDS, or an obesity gene.  These studies are not performed to find life saving drugs or even somthing as superficial as testing cosmetics.  They are done purely to satisfy the mind of a scientist with a question... Questions like, "Does stress effect a woman's mentral cycle?"  Well, Mr. Mad Scientist, I, and many other woman, can give you answers and opinions if you ask.  But you choose to run metal objects into skulls of ramdom primates instead.  While sometime I get a debilitating headache, I don't really see the corrilation.  How about giving the monkey 2 kids to feed, a deadbeat dad monkey, a run down apartment in the projects, and goverment system that believes everything is her fault, no job that could cover the cost of baby monkey care, and then measure the effects on her mentral cycle.    I guess assuming that we can love and respect animals is a little much, obviously we can't even love respect each other, yet.  I can always hope.

      I may not agree with what  urlLink Michael Moore  says, but I will defend to my death his right to say it.  Okay, well actually I do normally agree with Michael Moore, and I'm a republican.  I love this country, but as a society, we only want yes men, we want to point the finger all the time, and we don't like to here anything criticizing ourselves.  We are hyper emotional without having compassion.  We are the most powerful and wealthy country in the world, but many of us can't afford medicine.  We eat and then complain we are fat.  We go to war and cut taxes in the same year.  We call doctors murders, but consider capital punishment just.  We truly are a country that wants it's cake and eats it too, even if it takes 10 credit cards to buy the same cake everyone else on our block has.  We buy SUV's when we live in the suburbs then have the nerve to complain about gas prices.  We are a country with weakening math skills which is obviously linked to our lack of logic.  But who cares right, we're the greatest damn country in the world and everyone needs to "respect our authori-tay".  I do love this country, but I hate my government.  I believe that something always needs fixed and always needs approved upon.  Isn't that the basic of the American Dream, nothing is ever good enough?  What I find most abhorrent, it that we are fighting for freedom in the middle east and promoting "American Values" abroad.  At the same time, we are censoring our own artists.  Michael Moore ( Bowling for Columbine ) has distribution for his latest emotional and political critique,   Fahrenheit 911 ,  all over the world, except for here in the US.  Thank you Mickey Mouse!  Once again, Florida is trying to interfere in an election year.  Can we sell it back to Spain?  I mean, do we really need Florida?  I can live without Miami Vice, Mickey Mouse, and palmetto bugs, can you?  This seems eerily reminiscent of "The Passion of the Christ" debacle when it couldn't find distribution.  No matter your feelings on "Passion," it is now one of the highest grossing films of all time.  While Moore isn't Jesus, he's tackling and issue that the people in power don't want to be associated with, religion and politics.  I hope and pray everyday that someone who believes in freedom of speech and who has a strong sense of morality steps up and is willing to give this film to the masses, but I understand this is capitalist country.  There for, all opinion and morality aside, there must be someone willing to put up the money to get this film out there.  If it were a documentary praising Bush... What then?  Is this Rome? Do we kill our leaders, disperse our senators, and exile all thinker and portrayer of thought that would challenge the Emperor?  Rome fell fast from Republic to Empire all playing upon the fear of citizens for the security of Rome.  I would rather die than live in an empire under the house of Bush.  "911" opened in France this week... What's that say about our Freedom Fries?

      Since I'm in Buffyverse mode today (yes I know it's dead, let a girl mourn alright) I figured I'd give my shout out to Playboy for the cover and spread featuring Charisma Carpenter (Cordelia Chase of BTVS & Angel).       I thought the swan song episode "Thank You" featuring Cordelia's death showed more of Cordi (jiggling in low cut shirts) than I ever wanted to see... I was wrong thanks to Playboy.  I will admit that most of the pictures are great... but, the bear skin rug is a little to soft core looking for me.  I prefer the FHM Women of Buffy spread from last year featuring the whole cast (minus Sarah).  All in all, everyone I know has been oggling this Playboy issue, men and women, gay and straight.  So, thanks for getting it out and moving on.    Oh, and Hollywood, cast this lady in  Wonder Woman  already!    Charisma Carpenter as Cordelia Chase in "Thank You" Angel's 100th Episode.

      In an era of bugs, bachelors, business, and BULLSHIT, it is a welcome development that a brilliant scripted sit com with a the best ensemble network television could create has NOT been axed.  Bravo Fox... Bravo! This fall the neuroses come back with a whole new season of Arrested Development.

      In a surprising turn, Fox also picked up  Tru Calling  for a second season.  Now, myself being an Eliza Dushku fan (Faith from  Buffy the Vampire Slayer ), I couldn't wait for this show last fall.  That quickly changed.  After 3 episodes, I had no desire to ever watch it again.   Tru  is weak and contrived and never evolves past the original gimmick:  A girl is reluctantly forced into helping people with her unwanted super powers.    Although, in the hand of gifted writers, this gimmick can be used effectively... seen  Wonderfalls  anyone?  In fact, for the brief two weeks that the 2 shows were slated back to back, it emphasized the utter superiority of  Wonderfalls  (created by Tim Miner of the Joss camp)and the mediocrity of  Tru Calling .  So what was Fox thinking?  As my mother often said, it wasn't!  The only remaining hope for the potential cult and critical favorite,  Wonderfalls , is a WB pick up.  If you were thinking UPN, think again. The network has stated it doesn't want other networks left overs (aka Buffy).  If that wasn't enough, this all impacts the evolution of  Angel .   Angel  will end as we know it this Wednesday (tomorrow yo!) in an episode entitled "Not Fade Away."  The WB's reincarnation of  Dark Shadows  - remember the NBC early 90's failed attempt to revived this brilliant show from the 60's and 70's - led to the brass at the WB staking Angel in it's 5th season.  The WB should respect Vampires of the Buffyverse.  Buffy brought them fame and acclaim long before Dawson, the Gilmore Girls, and Smallville.  Respect your elders WB!  Anyway, WB felt they couldn't have more than one vampire show at a time.    But, knowing the following and fan backlash, the WB doesn't want to Angel completely dead, they are thinking more of a hell dimension known as MOVIE OF THE WEEK.  Angel is to end in a cliff hanger tomorrow night to lead the way for as many as 6 MOW's next season.  One main character is already dead (Fred) and I'm predicting most of the "humans" will probably follow suit in the dark carnage filled season finale.  Remaining would be the vamps - Angel and Spike - and the goddess Illyria to form the ultimate goth superhero team.  But wait, there's more... Faith was supposed to return as the rogue vampire slayer.  While the character Tru gets to relive days, Miss Eliza cannot... so with the renewal of  Tru , the only inevitable conclusion is that Faith will live on only in DVD's and video games.  Sadly we may never again to enjoy a box filled with Faith... so let's remember her the way we loved her - in leather pants with a bad ass quip.  So, how is all of this effecting the god of the Buffyverse, Joss, himself? He's to busy working on directing his first feature,  Serenity , to care.  I think I liked the old book Joss better.

      Today is Tuesday, the most wonderful day of the week because we are blessed with a new plethora of dvd's.  This weeks BUY ME pick is:   urlLink Sex in the City Season 6 (Part 1)  - The beginning of the end for our gang of girls and their tri-state boy toys.  But why release it in two parts?  Is it because HBO split the season into summer and winter episodes or is it simply to maximize profits (Kill Bill?).  Whatever the case, there is no better DVD buy this week.

      NBC has unveiled it's fall line-up.  With very little left on The Box that I actually watch (RIP Buffy, Wonderfalls, Angel, Friends, The Practice, and please hold on tight Arrested Development!) NBC isn't doing much to get me to tune in this September.  Curb your Ethusiam and Arrested Development (HBO & Fox) are the only shows left with any real laughs and are strikingly original to humor.  So all you comedy junkies, tune in these goods and let the Big 3 go!      (SIDENOTE:  Since my paycheck relies on Fox... I would like to say that Fox is great, Fox is wonderful, It is the best ever network.  I hold no hard feeling about the cancelling of Wonderfalls even though Tru Calling was given a whole season.  Go Fox!)   Back to NBC... so, Yawn... could this line up BE more boring:  MONDAY: 8 p.m., "Fear Factor"; 9 p.m., "Las Vegas"; 10 p.m., new drama "LAX"  TUESDAY: 8 p.m., "Average Joe" (with "The Contender" in midseason); 9 p.m., new CGI-animated comedy "Father of the Pride"; 9:30 p.m., "Scrubs"; 10 p.m., "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"  WEDNESDAY: 8 p.m., new drama "Hawaii"; 9 p.m., "The West Wing" (with "Revelations" in midseason); 10 p.m., "Law & Order"  THURSDAY: 8 p.m., new comedy "Joey"; 8:30 p.m., "Will & Grace"; 9 p.m., "The Apprentice 2"; 10 p.m., "ER"  FRIDAY: 8 p.m., "Dateline NBC"; 9 p.m., "Third Watch" (new time); 10 p.m., new drama "Medical Investigation"  SATURDAY: 8 p.m., "Apprentice 2" repeats; 9 p.m., "NBC Saturday Night Movie"  SUNDAY: 7 p.m., "Dateline NBC"; 8 p.m., "American Dreams"; 9 p.m., "Law & Order: Criminal Intent"; 10 p.m., "Crossing Jordan"

      So I haven't really posted anything this week, I'm guessing that's because I've been busy writing.  Yes, this week I broke out of work on Box pieces and have moved into the popcorn realm with my first screenplay attempt.  I will be blogging more as more becomes available.  Also, sadly, Kevin "the Krazy Tyger" no longer has a girlfriend.  Can we get a big community "Awe, sorry kev" going?

      First let my state that it took me 10 years to realize that there were 2 characters named Rachel Green on NBC's Thursday night line up.  Besides Friends, there is the less likable now teenage daughter of the late Dr. Green's (Anthony Edwards) on ER.  She was a wee lass when the series premiered making Mad about You, Friends, Seinfeld, and ER the powerhouse of Thursday night.  There have been many retro-spectives done about the show, but being from the generation of "Friends"... here is how show impacted my life and lessons all my "friends" learned.  1.  I cut all my hair off at 15 sparking the debate as to whether my shag more resembled Rachel's or Monica's hair.  Thus, 10 years of mimicking "Friends" hair began.... well there was that brief period of Clair Danes/Angela hair too.  2. It gave our high school clique something to talk about lunch when we all hated each other over petty and sometimes serious teenage crap.  3. It gave us easy ways to superficially classify people.  Such as, "Angie only like's Chandler types" or "My roomate drives me crazy.  She's such a Monica!"  4. When trying to get out a bad date, all you had to do was the Janice laugh.  5. Before we had the girls of "Sex", "Friends" gave girls confirmation that everyone is just as crazy and neurotic as you... unless you can identify with Phoebe.  Then you are just strange.  6. Tall thin blonde girls (Phoebe) don't always have a perfect life and be nice to the fat brunette!  7. It's okay to sleep with your ex-boyfriend whenever you need a pick me up.  It doesn't make you a slut.  In fact, it's normal behavior.  8. Women do not logically define a "break" the same way as men.  9. There should be no "cupping" by a tailor.  10. Family isn't always just your blood.  It's who you laugh, cry, sleep, eat, and drink coffee with.  It's who, no matter the dim or scathing wit, condescending or up lifting tone, drug problem or sobriety, that you can spend 10 years by each others' side with out a stack of bodies piled up in the celler.    The future:  In 1994, Friends was credited with ushering in a new era of the sitcom.  For every Murphy Brown, Cheers, and Seinfeld, it was the family that dominated this tv form.  Friends showed that family wasn't just mom, dad, kids, and a brownstone with a butler or housekeeper or something eles thrown in for comedy.  In 2004, Friends represents the end of the genre all together.  In fact, Will & Grace and Arrested Development are the only shows i'll be tuning in for.  That includes Joey.  He was my least liked character on the entire series.  While The Burbs, features Chandler and Monica would slightly peak my interest, Joey's exploits in L.A. leave no aching desire for more.  Lisa Kudrow is by far the most talented and I hope she has a long award winning career ahead of her in film and theater.  Jennifer Aniston has poplular appeal but aside from an excellent turn in the Good Girl has yet to show any acting chops.  I have a feeling she will become the poor man's Julia Roberts for sugar coated roles. She's set to be a powerhouse producer with husband Brad and their already establish shingle. David Schwimmer most likely will end up behind the camera directing t.v. and maybe crossing over into film.  Ms. Cox-Arquette continues to make millions off her real estate mogal status and really never needs to work again.  She'll probably to occasional guest appearances and hopefully tackle some gritty low budget roles.  As for Perry and LeBlanc, they have little success outside Friends making them extremely tied to their characters.  In fact, I love Chandler, but have very little interest in Perry.  Because of that, I see them falling below the radar and living merely in T.V. syndication.  That's all I really have to say.  The finale was happier than it was sad.  It was predictable to just the right extent.  We said hello to a new generation of Bings and Ducks good-bye to the standard and comfortable.

      THE BOX - D-DOG SAYS GOOD-BYE TO HIS FRIENDS...   Tis a sad day for me, but an oh-so-happy one.   So, finale review first or toasts and goodbyes???   I'll go with the finale then my retrospective   FINALE GRADE: A   (Eh, why not?)   It remained consistently funny till about the last 10 minutes, which didn't mean there wasn't a few tears to be had in the first 50.     First off, my complaints: I have 2.  Anna Faris and Paul Rudd.  "Hi! Here have your babies!" "Hi! Let's have some kids!" Thanks for our paychecks.  Bye.  Anywho, it was probably good that they kept it to just the six of them.   Now the good:   The best part of this episode was truly Phoebe.  My god, I think Lisa is the most talented cast member.  She was just so funny.  The whole phalange thing was great.  And constantly wanting to make life a musical.  Haha, now someone understands.   Second best was Rachel and Ross getting together.  I loved the fact that at first she got on the airplane telling him no.  But when she showed up at apartment.....   Anywho......yeah, Chandler and Joey hugging almost made me cry.  And the final show of the frame, was, "perfection."  I love the last line about going to get coffee.  Perfection.   Lalalalalalala...   So the clip show was like nothing but "I LOVE THAT EPISODE!" for me!   Pretty much all my favorites were in there...   So now, everything I'll miss about friends:   -Smelly Cat -Central Perk -Gunther, Janice, Frank, Alice, Mike, Ursala, the Gellars, and the other friends-in-laws -"I'll Be There For You" (you know you sing along and even clap at the right time, don't deny it) -Phoebe's secret weapon: her sexuality -all the weddings -the backlash..yes..the "they are all white!! how can they afford that stuff?? its just a fad"..and suck on that, assholes..it lasted 10 years -the cliffhanger season finales -the guest stars (Brad Pitt & Christina Applegate probably being the best) -the love interests  -Jon Lovitz saying Tartlets -Thanksgiving with Friends -the competitive nature of Ross and Monica    -such as against each other when they are playing football, or against others when they are dancing during New Years....haha..they played that during the clip show and i lost it -the girls and guys switching apartments -the hilarious game that led up to that -the "they don't know we know they know we know" ...probably best written episode of series -Phoebe's dollhouse -Mr. Heckles "I have to rejoin my dinner party" -Marcel  -Ross's leather pants -any of Phoebe's songs -the blackout -Chandler giving us a new way to sarcastically say things (Could that BE any clearer?) -Baywatch -the chick and the duck -Ugly Naked Guy (and the giant poking device!)/"Its naked ROSS" -any battle of the sexes discussion, or actual battles -Joey and Rachel's romance and its simple, yet realistic, outcome -Monica's hair in Barbados (Sorry you broke up with the Supremes) -the wedding dress episode -the episode where winona ryder and rachel kissed, then phoebe kissing rachel to see what all the fuss was about -Phoebe's pregnancy -Monica talking about Easy-Monica's bakery -Emily's rugby hunks (YUM!) -Monica and Richard -Monica proposing to Chandler (probably the all-time greatest FRIENDS kleenex moment) -Joey's agent, Estelle -the gang's mocking of Ross and his job -Carol and Susan's wedding (long before the days of ellen and just jack)  -the hermaphodite cheerleader from long island -the super bowl episode -Monica's cleanliness -Monica fainting when her wedding dishes break -"WE WERE ON A BREAK" -the one with the morning after - the episode i don't watch cause its so heartbreaking -Rachel's dessert, the one with beef that Joey likes that Ross says "tastes like feet" -Chandler fake-farting when Rachel hugs him on the 2nd to last episode -Joey's head in the chicken -Chandler in a box -"I take thee, Rachel!" -Emma & Ben were never major characters -"How you doin?" -Monica's picture of her grandmother with her friends at Java Joe's.... -and pretty much everything about the series....but...   Here are the 3 best things about Friends:   3.  Prom Videos, Fat Monicas, and other Flashbacks or What Might Have Been's (self explanatory)     2. Jennifer Aniston Has television produced a brighter, more popular star in the past 20 years?  I think not!  From offscreen with Brad Pitt to the Good Girl, to Rachel Green on-screen.  THE HAIR!!! The Rachel!! How many people can actually pull that off and look as great as her??? Not many, if any at all.  And look back at her wardrobe.  Jeez.  Everything she wore was fabulous.  But let's not forget Miss Aniston, the comedian.  Long before she won her respect (and the much deserved Emmy) for Season 8's pregnancy, go back to season 4 and watch The One With the Fake Party where Rachel throws a fake going away party for Emily just to get Josh's attention.  I love when she tries to play spin the bottle and dresses like the cheerleader.  Then, in the Wedding Dress episode, when she suggests to Joshua that they get married...omg..her hand gesture and face kill me!!! She's the most popular of the cast for a reason.  What a beauty!  What a star!         1. The Chemistry   There's this magic spark between everyone on the show. You can pair them off any way, and its comic gold.  That's it....   I think the show works best as a romantic comedy, like TV guide once said...it sparkles like no other show...     So I did Jennifer Aniston as Rachel Green....   Courteney Cox Arquette as Monica Gellar Bing...OMG.. how I love her!  FAT MONICA is so hilarious..  I think after CCA put on the suit, she found out the character, and I've loved Monica ever since.  The weird thing about her is that whenever I watch any Scream, I never think of Monica.  When I watch Friends, I don't think of Gale.  Most improved cast member of the years...   Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe Buffet....Her delivery is impeccable... I think the best cast cast member of the series (if that's even possible to label)...Season 4 & 5 are so great for her...when she gives birth and says goodbye to the triplets...well, she most deserved those Emmy's.   Matt Le Blanc as Joey Tribiani...his soap opera scenes crack me up..."Smell the fart acting." .his daffy nature make the most endearing character on the show....Good luck with Joey, Matt....Him holding Rachel as she watches Cujo...so great! And the one where he buys the V edition of the encyclopedia, and Monica starts talking about the Korean War...   Matthew Perry as Chandler Bing...BING!  Probably the funniest of the bunch, I love how neurotic he is in the first season to how he uses that to calm Monica down in the later years...these two are so perfectly cast....and Janice!  Love the Mr. Heckles dying one..shows a real soft side.     David Schwimmer as Ross Gellar....all the weddings!  I love when he jokes about how many times he's been married.  And all the lesbianism jokes at the beginning.  Ross is the perfect nerdy hunk, too!  I love the one where Marcel swallows the scrable letters and Ross rushes him to the hospitol. and Marcel holds Ross's finger and the song New York Minute plays...   So now, I have to say goodbye to all those people.  My favorite show is over.  Long live syndication!!!  Thinking about Thursday nights with all 6 of my friends makes me sad, but thinking about all the above things makes me so happy.     Lots of laughs, lots of tears....and they got the perfect ending.... I'm so glad they were there for me....sorta like friends...but actually, I think of those guys as my tv family.   BFF   -D

      BILL ZWECKER of the Chicago Sun Times reported last week that Larry is about to become "Linda".    According to the paper, Wachowski has been living and dressing as a woman for a while and is now ready to make his manhood a thing of the past. Currently, the Matrix maker is in the midst of a messy divorce from Thea Bloom, who is demanding a share of his "Matrix" millions.  Bloom claimed "Larry has been extremely dishonest with me in our personal life" and said the decision to split was "based on very intimate circumstances concerning which I do not elaborate at this time for the reasons of his personal privacy."  There is no comment from the Wachowski camp, which is hardly surprising given the fact the ultra-reclusive auteur is so media-shy he reportedly had a no-publicity clause added to his contract with Warner Bros.  For more information, including the nitty gritty on a S&M sex shop scandle, read the entire Sun-Times article 'Matrix' co-creator ready to be whole new woman

      Of the horrible things large conglomorates are responsible for, this is the most extreme infrigement of free speech in years and deserves a very prompt citizen response.  Letter writing to the press and to Disney, circulating information about the article or the article itself in an email to any and everyone who believes is free speech, anything to express outrage will help.   Disney has forbidden Miramax to distribute Fahrenheit 9/11, the newest documentry by Michael Moore, because it deals with the long standing relationship the Bush's have had with the Saudi royal family and Osama bin Ladin.  Disney is afraid of angering Jeb Bush, the governor of Florida, and in response losing the special treatment tax breaks that his administration affords the conglom.    Here is the full NY Times article "Disney Forbidding Distribution of Film That Criticizes Bush".  Moore's response can be found on www.michaelmoore.com.  To anyone who follows entertainment or business news, you most likely are aware of the debauchle Eisner, CEO, found himself in last quarter with the Disney Shareholders.  Roy Disney is still lobbying to oust Eisner.  Below is contact information for the governing board of directors for the Walt Disney Co.  In the end, they are the ones who have the ability to fire or veto Eisner.  This information has been provided by Roy Disney's site...  urlLink www.savedisney.com.

      POPCORN - MEAN GIRLS  Mean Girls, staring Lidsey Lohan, finally tackles the age old question:  "Which is more difficult, surviving the African Bush or making it through a suburban Chicago High School?"  (Attention Mark Burnett: Idea for the next season of Survivor!)  Cady (Lohan) grows up in Africa with eccentric and intellectual parents who superbly home schooled her in academics, but failed to socialize her to the ways of the suburbia.  Ill-prepared and naive, Cady finds herself longing for the animal kingdom while lost in the passive aggressive anxious mess that is High School.  After falling in with the neurotic angry artsy girl Janice and her hefty gay side kick, Cady is wrapped up in teen turmoil to bring down The Plastics... the clique of girls everyone hates yet still wants to be.  Soon, like a vice cop going undercover, the lines of place and purpose and truth and lies become blurred. Cady loses herself and her friends in the quest of Queen-Bee status in a manner that makes the African queen Cleopatra look timid.  Mean Girls is smart, stylish, and in it's own way, socially conscious.  Can a girl be gorgeous and good at calculus?  Can she honestly get a man by honestly being herself? The screenplay adaptation by Tina Fey garnered more laughs per minute than most comedies in recent memory.  Flanked my many SNL colleagues and alums, this cast is full of scene stealing comedians without too much of over the top gross out humor. Not to be over looked, no teen assemble is complete without some man candy.  Jonathan Bennett provides a dose so sweet some might find themselves asking how many licks does it take to get to the center of a...... OOPS!  Well, you get the picture.  As for the movie's star, last summer Miss Lohan proved she can hold her own against Jamie Lee Curtis in another Mark Walters helmed pic (Freaky Friday), and this spring is proving she can carry a film all her own.  Destined to be a super star performer, Mean Girls has crowned Lohan the reigning Teen Queen by being smart, funny, neurotic, sexy, classy, and most importantly a great actress.  In the current world of celebrity skin and child star peter pan syndromes, she sets an example not only for the girl next door, but her industry counter parts could learn a thing or too as well.  Whether you're a 20 or 30 something feeling you've grown up too fast, a 13 year old girl dreading the transition to high school in the fall, a 15 year old boy looking for some eye candy, or a mom or dad looking to understand the wacky ways of your 17 year old daughter, this film has something for everyone of every age.  Mean Girls breathes new breath into a sometimes played out genre.  As the heir apparent to Fast Times, The Breakfast Club, Heathers, and Clueless, Mean Girls is the queen of the Spring Fling.

      Hello Bloggers:  The Brain Drain has moved to a new blogging community. Don't worry, it's the same great entertainment, pulp culture, random thoughts, and political taste, just a different look. Everyone I know is rather opinionated, so don't hold back.  Feedback makes me feel loved.  I'm high maintenance so it takes a lot of love.  I will be transfering the old weblogs from May into the new home.  Be patient with my formatting also.  I'm kind a new and learning as I go.  Also, when it comes to the transfered posts, most of the links don't work... I already know this.  Welcome to the Brain Drain!

      So I haven't blogged in a while.  Mostly because, believe it or not, I have nothing to say really and I've been uber busy in the office.  This weekend though I took to domesticating myself one step further.  It's quite odd, the turn of of idealistic anarchist artsy grunge girl, to self medicated bisexual club kid, to elitist ambitious superbitch, and finally to 1950's house wife?  Okay, so in a very loose nutshell that my state of evolution over the past decade... oddly enough most can be determined by the men I surround myself with, darren, adam, dan, and now ben respectively.    Anyway, in my now housewifey phase... This past weekend, after becoming frustrated by clothing manufacturers designs that fail to fit my body, in well, all the right places... I remembered that most of the people my mothers generation and earlier made their own clothing.  And my mom made all my clothes until I was about 12.  Okay, maybe not all mothers and grandmother did this, but mine was a seamstress and I father managed garment operations, so I runs in the blood.  So, I trucked off to the store to find fabrics, buttons, bows, and zippers to fashion myself a party dress.  First of all came reading pattern notation for what all you need and what fabrics work for the designs and such... I didn't really understand it all.  I could have called my mom for domestic advice, but she was at the beach getting tank with her friends and more piercings.  At some point during the past decade, I think we switched places.    Regardless, how someone could spend all day sewing, baking, and cleaning house is mind numbing to me.  First of all, how did it not drive women mad... but I guess that's what part of The Hours was about.  After getting most of the way through my dress I decided to way for my mom to return for her advice.  She of course critiqued my stiching and quality, basically, if my mother was the orson wells of fashion, i was roger corman.    So why am i rambling on about this stuff.  I read an article this morning in the paper about how swimming and tennis clubs and country clubs are losing business and most are shutting down because people aren't interested in swimming anymore, because they have air conditioning.  It's just not like the 60's according to the article.  Okay, I love swimming.  I love swimming so much on my lunch hour i swim laps at the gym beside my office.  It's not because of the lack of interest in swimming, it's because of the lack of housewives.  Okay, so I wake up a 7:30, meet ben at the restaurant by 8:15, have breakfast and make it to the office by 9:30.  I then get home by 5:30 or 6:00 if there are no errands to run.  If there are I get home by 7:30 or 8:00.  I then eat dinner that Ben cooks, watch tv and sleep by midnight. I don't clean the bathroom, do laundry, or the dishes.  I do all that stuff on the weekend.  So when would I have time to go to the pool.  I don't even have children.  Factor them into the equation and there seams to be no time what so ever.  So, unless the pools are open at 10:30 at night, I don't see how anyone besides school teachers, seniors, and children have the time to spend by the pool.  My point, which probably got lost in this diatribe is, it has nothing to do with the love or apathy towards swimming.

      According to CNN Money:  urlLink Michael Moore's 'Fahrenheit 9/11' turns on box office heat - Jun. 24, 2004 : "Online ticket service Fandango.com reported Wednesday that 'Fahrenheit 9/11' was making up  48 percent of advance ticket sales  for the weekend ahead, compared to 11 percent for 'Dodgeball' and  9 percent for next week's 'Spider-Man 2 .'"  Well after researching all overy the internet, I finally came up with a source reporting the numbers for Wednesday's opening at Lincoln center and Loew's Village 7.  Granted, I would have opened up AMC 25, but that's just me.  Anyway, F911 earned $49,000 down in the village and $30,000 uptown.  Hopefully this means the local venues will realize the money they are potentially missing.  Nothing upsets REG more than money.  I mean, they still have Jesus's money!

         For the third time this week, I heard yet another person use the term  mockumentry  in referance to  F911 .  Theses Bush supporting columnists and comentators use this title siting that  Moore  simply used this film to further his own political agenda.  To those conservatives I would like to say...  WELL DUH!   Of course he did.  He isn't pretending to present a non bias interpretation of the facts.  Moore is sternly anti-Bush.  But, just because he uses his art form to further a message he strongly believes in doesn't make this a "mock-u-mentry".  Documentries use non fiction footage to tell a story.  The director or creator decides what story he wants to tell before he starts filming.  Hopefully his vision slightly changes or grows as he learns things along the way.  If there is no story, there is no film, there is no point.   Documentries are an artistic expression, they are NOT non bias journalistic video pieces .  Some directors might choose to attempt a non bias movie, but there will always be an opposing opinion.  I'm sure many revisionists consider the numerous holocoust documentries pure Zionist proganda.    A mockumentry is a fictional and often comedic film shot in the style of a documentry.  The definative genre piece is  Spinal Tap .  Christopher Guest has gone on to define this genre with brilliant improv skills of his friends including the films  Waiting for Guffman ,  Best in Show , and most recently,  A Mighty Wind .  A different take can be that of the  Blair Witch Project  which was marketed as "real" to amp up the fear factor when it was clearly false.  If F911 was a mockumentry, it wouldn't be using real footage of president Bush golfing.  This are real images.  It would most likely take a Bush-a-like (might i suggest Will Ferrel) and purposely put him in slapstick situations with befuddling improvised dialogue.   F911  is not that movie.  Before you bring out your "expert" perhaps someone in the news business to refute my defination, I studied and am degreed in film.  Documentries are film, not news.  The same rules, the same criticisms of bias, do not and should not apply.    Simply disagreeing with the subject matter of a documentry or even the validity of the point of view of a documentry does not make it a Mockumentry.

      Yes America, it's Fahreheit 911 week here on The Brain Drain.  Hopefully, at some point this week, I will get a chance to watch this film.  Yesturday, in a decision I honestly don't disagree with, F911 was given and R rating.  That means all the left wing parents of conservative children with be dragging them off to the movies this weekend.  Well, that is if they live in a metropolitan area.

      I've worked in enough movie theaters to know Monday is when the bookings come in.  Eagerly, I checked  urlLink Fandango  and  urlLink   Fahrenheit 911's    website to see if the  urlLink Regal Entertainment Group  dominated region I live in will get a copy of  F911 .     Sadly, my fears were confirmed.  I would like to catch a 7 p.m. showing at the 13 screen multiplex across the street from my office on Friday, but won't have that option.  I wouldn't mind the 20 minute drive to the next town over to a 16 screen multiplex.  Again, REG has eliminated that option as well.  I will spend an hours drive into downtown Baltimore to the Charles Theater or a drive north to Harrisburg's Midtown Cinemas.  If I want a theater with better seating and projection, I can drive a little over an hour east to Regal Oaks 24 where 1 screen was spared to display this film.  It's really quite sad that the small cities and large towns in middle America are not being offered a chance to see this film.  I don't know what the specifics stats are, but Pennsylvania has lost more troops in Iraq than any other state in the union.  Those boys and girls aren't just coming from Philadelphia.  They are coming from the "Red" counties in between Philly and Pittsburgh.  Shouldn't their families have a right to watch this.    Another issue I have with this distribution pattern (I hold REG's Booking system responsible not the films distributors) is that the arthouse's which dominate the platform distribution don't have automated ticket reservation systems.  While I'm willing to risk an hours drive for tickets, I'd rather know they were secured with an online Moviefone-like system.    Why is the establiment making it so hard to access this film.  After all, it's just a movie right?

      This morning, while perusing section A of the local newspaper, I happened upon two pages with headlines I couldn't for the life of me ignore. The first, "boatload of African migrants arrives at Spanish nudist beach" is pretty self explanatory.  The second,  Christian Group plans to secede from the U.S.,  got me thinking.    Since I was 16, idealistic, and a democrat sitting in my United State history class taught by the most brilliant teach to ever live, my political opinions have done a complete 180.  Well strike that, my ideals haven't changed as much as my education and understanding of the United States government and society have.  I used to be pro-life because I found abortion abhorrent.  Now, I'm pro choice because I do not assume to right to enforce my beliefs on others if offered the same accord.  I used to to be pro capital punishment.  Now, I understand the ultimate fallibility of our justice system and how many people have been executed by mistake.  I used to be a democrat because of the great good FDR encompassed.  It's for the same reason I supported higher taxes and a large "parental" central government.  Now, I'm a Republican because I believe the government is consists of ambitious men and it interferes more than it protects, it hurts more than it helps.  I now also believe in the strong rights of states to make the decisions that is right for a majority of its citizens.    We are big.  We are huge.  We are a nation run predominately by men, who, for their own insecurities, believe bigger is always better.  Whether it's a hummer, a rocket ship, or a tv... men like things big.  Women on the other hand seem more obsessed with small things.  Whether it's a desire to be petite, a cute black cocktail dress, an itsy bitsy bikini, a tiny convertible, or a perfect 5 carat rock over a television set... mothers often tell their daughters the best things come in small packages.  In a smaller setting, a more socialist approach to human welfare is possible... universal healthcare for example.  The groups of people are smaller and easier to accommodate.  I believe that if California wants to legalize gay marriage, and Oklahoma doesn't... that should be allowed.  If Pennsylvania wants freedom of firearms but Florida wants to ban them, that should be allowed.  Now, a group of Texan Christians plan to pilgrimage to South Carolina to secede from the Union, and in my humble opinion, that should be allowed.  I grew up a child of divorce, and unlike some, I never championed the "Parent Trap" fantasy.  My parents fought and emotionally hurt each other.  I loved them both but understood that separate is better in come cases.  We can't all get along.  The Israelis and Palestinians can't.  The Greeks and Turks can't.  After thousands of years, there is still violence.  So, if this group of Christians wants to secede, and take South Carolina with them... I fully support it.  Granted, this group at ChristianExodus.org is comparing itself to the Amish.  I live and was raised in Amish Country.  The Amish don't care what the "English" do.  They farm and live as they always have.  The problem, since Paul in the new testimate, is that Christians feel the need to alter everyone around them.  Collectively, they have the need to prove that they are "right".  Granted, they say they are saving the heathens.  I believe in, because I do it, following the teachings of Jesus without infringing on the freedom of others.... Sadly, this is not the popular consensus.    So, the first exodus is scheduled in a trek to the promise land in 2006.  My thought, why stop with South Carolina!  I, over my breakfast, have decided that we should establish a Christian run conservative country (Redland) and have a human rights and liberty oriented secular country (The Blue Person Group).    Here is what I propose:  The New Promiseland Red Country:  The Christians are more than welcome to Texas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri, Mississippi, Alabama, and Both Carolinas.  We can negotiate on South Dakota, Iowa, Georgia, and Kentucky.  Tennessee remains non-negotiable and belongs to the "blue". Florida would be divided just south of Orlando.  The Red country would get Disney World and all points north.  South Florida would belong to the secular country, including the Keys. New Orleans would become a principality separate from Louisiana.  LA will go to the Red and New Orleans to the Blue.   Really, wouldn't that simply make everyone happier?

           Wonderfalls  , most brilliant new show second to only  urlLink   Arrested Development   , was canceled by Fox after a mere 4 week run where the network managed to shift it's time slot neferiously.  The good news is that the boys at  urlLink AICN  have reported a December 7th release date for a box set of the complete series.  So, if you're wondering what to get me for Christmas this year, and you think it might be too predictable to buy my a  urlLink   24    or  urlLink   Lord of the Rings    box set... here's your answer.

      8/10     While not quite a rip roaring rampage, Saved! was overly adequate entertainment for a storm plagued Monday evening.  I must admit that my own propensity to fall for gay men and the absurb religious dogma of my own family had something to do with my enjoyment of this film.  Saved! has one of the best precipitating incidents in recent history:  Mary (Jena Malone), A devout popular girl from a christian academy, becomes pregnant after Jesus, in a vision, tells her to save her gay boyfriend by having sex.  Throw in some sexual tension between Mary's mom and Pastor Skip, some devient activity between a cripple and and the school's lone jew, and some uber bitchy  Mandy Moore ... and the result is a hour and a half of beautiful satire and entertainment.  Yes, it had the cliched teen movie climax at prom.  And granted, the payoff is kind of overly sappy, "Why would God makes us all so different if he wanted everyone to be the same?"  But, in the pro fundementalist movement of the day, anything with reason is welcomed.     Saved  has some great performances from  Jena Malone  and scene stealers from  Eva Amurri .  Saved also proved a much better "adult" performace from Mac than  Party Monster  which was kind of ick.  I'm sure this film will offend alot of people who are too uptight.  Most of them are probably sitting in the White House or on the Dover Area School Board.  Either way, if you haven't be subjected to bilical trivia pursuit after a penn state football game and lots of turkey on Thankgiving or attended more than 3 vacation bible schools during the course of one summer... it might not mean as much.  But in the words of that great american poet Homer, "it's funny cause it's true."

          Yes... that is Adam and Eve, (not Steve).  Forget about gay marriage, my former high school is deciding now if Evolution is appropriate.   This blog is pretty much used to share joy about entertainment and a venting outlet for the slippery slope George Bush has put us in.  Sometimes, as is the case with  The Passion of the Christ  and  Fahrenheit 911 , the two mingle.  Today though, I feel the need to vent about the complete absurdity that is my hometown.  Forget the segregation, anti-Semitic hate crimes, race riots, school shootings, and overall moral superiority that is flagrantly displayed by those proud Americans in my hometown.  The school board of my alma malter is  urlLink debating evolution ... yes, monkeys.   Now, I remember being called a whole host of names in certain classes.  The first reason being because I'm not "white", which at Dover meant German or Scotch Irish.  Granted, I am mostly German, but my Asian heritage made me standout amongst all the Millers, Schumakers, Rohrbaughs, and such.  Also remember, that my area of the county were Kaiser sympathizers during WWI.  They still hate Japan, the Japanese, and foreign cars because of WWII, but Hitler and Germany, not so bad in their opinion.  I was also ridiculed because I thought equal rights should be extended to everyone.  The card carrying members of the KKK in my government classes were not too fond of me.  Did I mention these boys would carry sawed off shotguns and confederate flags to school in their pick ups.  Yes, and I lived only a 1/2 hour from Gettysburg.  Okay, so there are a whole host of reasons why York, PA sucks.  The band Live even wrote a song about it, Shittown.  Regardless, maybe that's why I grew up so liberal, to offset the evil I felt I was surrounded with.  Okay, back to the monkeys.  Now, I'm not some feed-the-Christians-to-the-lions type of girl that Fox News would paint me to be.  In fact, I'm quit a big fan of Jesus.  To quote the t-shirt, Jesus is my homeboy.  I'm also a big fan of Martin Luther King and Ghandi because each of these men had the ability to change the world for the better without violence.  It's a sad irony everytime the Roman Catholic Church, George Bush, Mel Gibson, or people in my hometown use Jesus as justification for their personal violence.    At a school board meeting last week, a board member, William Buckingham, said as part of a search for a new biology book, he and others are looking for one that offers balance between the Christian views of creation and Darwin's Theory of Evolution.  After the meeting, he also said there needn't be any other considerations for the beliefs of Hindus, Buddhists, Muslims or other competing faiths and views.  "This country wasn't founded on Muslim beliefs or evolution," he said. "This country was founded on Christianity and our students should be taught as such."  Which is funny, because if you carefully study religion, most people would realize that Christianity, Judaism, and Islam while having vast differences, are more alike than not.  They are monotheistic religions that stem from the same place on the planet.  It's their followers, and governments of those followers, that are often different.  Is teaching creation a bad thing?  No.  In fact, every religion (mono and polytheist) has it's own creation myth.  The book of Genesis isn't the only one.  But, Buckingham doesn't want to hear any of that other bunk. I, unlike some liberals, do not feel that  freedom of religion  means  freedom from religion . In fact, I would whole heartedly support a discussion day in science class comparing all the different myths and their similarities as well as differences.  That's not what the school board wants though. I think this might be a better world if children where taught what other religions beliefs are and not just told to judge the people of those beliefs.  There are people I dislike of all religions, but I dislike no one because of their religion.  "What I am saying is that when you teach only one theory (evolution), that theory becomes a fact," Wenrich said. "I'm not saying that students must believe in creation, but I do believe they must consider the possibility."  That's funny.  I find it odd that Mr. Buckingham, a seemingly devout Christian, isn't aware of the "evolution" of Christianity's sanctioned beliefs.  For instance, it was heresy to teach the Copernican theory that that Earth revolved around the Sun and not vice versa. Should the students of Dover be given the option they choose? The other Earth-centered theory was determined by Ptolemy who was Egyptian (and not Christian).  The Roman Catholic church adopted that theory as their own. In fact, in 1992, the Pope apologized to  urlLink Galileo for his work on Copernican theory .  Galileo had been dead for over 350 years. Seeing that the  urlLink Monkey Scopes  trial took part in the early part of the last century, we have, I figure, about 250 or more years to go before my home town catches up with the rest of the progressive world.  I wonder if this man would support the teaching of the mass genocide committed by early "Americans" on the East Coast.  How about teachings of the Civil War Draft, and the draft riots of New York City?  Would he support the teaching of Japanese internment camps?  Would he support teaching of opium and marijuana cases used simply to drive out the Mexicans and Chinese from our borders?  There are many things I was and was not taught during my years at Dover Area High School, creation is just one of them.  But, then again, I could recite the book of Genesis by the age of 5. (Yes, how many Christians know who Seth was, huh?)  And guess what, I still believe in  urlLink Darwin .  In the end, all teachings are a choice.  I'm sure their are children who come home after studying WWII.  Their grandfather sits them down and tells the child that everything they learned in school regarding the holocaust was a lie perpetuated by the Jews. We don't stop teaching the horrors of the holocaust, do we?  Regardless of personal religious beliefs, this is a public school.  What children are taught outside the setting of the school regarding religious views is completely protected by the first amendment.  But, I will never allow my child to go to a school so dominated by such hypocrisy.  Final note, I really hope Mrs. Keagy chooses " urlLink Inherit the Wind " as the school play this fall.

       .  Apparently,  urlLink  Regal Entertainment Group   (Regal Cinemas, United Artist Theater Circuit, etc.) is being greedy with Jesus's money.  According to numerous sources, Mel Gibson's  Icon entertainment is suing the exhibitor for $40 million dollars of Passion money yet owed to Icon.  I see it now, during this weekends showing of  Harry Potter , Mel and his "disciples" run into theaters throughout the county knocking over registers, screaming sacrilege... he might even sing a little ditty from  JC Superstar  while he's at it. After all, it's  Blood Money ! If I were REG, I'd pay up.  The man has proven he's not afraid of using the press and manipulating religion to create hysteria.  I hope the CEO of REG isn't Jewish, Arab, Shinto, Buddhist, Hindu, or even a woman for that matter.  Break out the crosses, it's time for a good ol' corporate crucifixion.

       .  My good friend Darren, if you don't know him personally, has and idol, a goddess, a sexual fanstasy, a living doll of inspiration... and she is  Nicole Kidman .  I woke up this morning and flipped on the Today Show.  I'm guessing Darren taped it, but if not... there is big news.  She talked alot about retiring.  Maybe that's why she works so hard now, turning out 2 or 3 pics a year.  I have often critized her mothering skills.  I mean, how good of a mother can you be when you're always on set.  I've been on them, it's long hard work.  Then again, I realized she's the "talent".  So while the crew is struggling to the get the lighting just right, she can mother for hours on end.  Regardless of her mothering skills, she stated how she loves acting but she gives so much to every performance that she she loses a bit of herself each time.  In that retrospect, she wants to retire before she loses herself completely.  When's her 40th birthday, Darren?  You might want to start counting down the days.  Here are photos from what I consider Miss Kidman's greatest rolls.  Darren will surely disagree, if only because I don't mention   To Die For   .      This photo is from the train station scene from   The Hours.    This single scene is the most powerful, poignant, and personally impacting scene I have ever witnessed.  Her portrayal of Virgina Wolfe earned Kidman an Oscar.  From Frumpy to Fabulous...   Moulin Rouge   revived the musical genre in Golden Age Glitz and Glam not scene of film since My Fair Lady.

        Busch   Due to a water garden project gone array, I unfortunately missed the first episode of   The Jury  .  I did have a chance to catch the second though which aired at 9 p.m.  To my shock and awe, there was Adam Busch.  I yelled out "holy shit, baby, it's Warren... and he's HOT!".  To those of you who might be as much of a geek as myself, recognize  Adam Busch  as Warren, the sex-bot building sci-fi leader of the evil trio on   urlLink Buffy the Vampire Slayer   (5th & 6th seasons).  Busch's character met an untimely demise when, after shooting Willow's ( Alyson Hannigan ) lesbian lover Tara ( Amber Benson ), he was skinned alive by "black magic" Willow.  Eh, he kind of had it coming.  Anyway, most all of the press on  The Jury  has been about the creative team and  Billy Burke  and  Shalom Harlow ... which generated an "OOHH, Shalom Harlow.... mmmm" from my boy.  Also, my observant boy pointed out, "How can their really be a star of a show called The Jury, shouldn't the cast change every week?"  Yes, it does, but the legal teams and courthouse staff remain the same.  Speaking of Shalom, I think I saw her for a brief 2 seconds last night?  What's with that.  Like I said, I didn't see the first show.   Burke & Harlow    Anyway, is it worth tuning into?  Yes, if you're around, but it's not quite the appointment setting television of    urlLink 24   .  It has beat   Law & Order: Trial by Jury   to the punch which is always good.  The directing was great, the editing better than most tv shows, and the general story gimmick works.  Although, I wasn't too big on the actual actors in the Jury room, this isn't the drama of    urlLink 12 Angry Men   .  Who knows how the show will develop... if you're home on tuesdays it's worth a glance.  Might I say again, Adam Busch is HOT... he reminds me of someone I once knew too, I just can't remember who.

      So some have thought it odd that I as a Republican blogger have not yet commented on the untimely death of President Reagan.  Simply put, it's because my mother always told me that if you don't have anything nice to say, say nothing. But, hey, when did I ever listen to my mother. While the Gipper is credited with ending the Cold War and boosting the economy with "reaganomics", he single handedly skewed the Republican party away from small government longing for fiscal responsibility to a moral army of conservative Christians crusading for American souls.  Yes.... That's where Bush gets it from.  Anyway, I call myself a liberal republican and I'm engaged to a libertarian socialist, and yes, I'm aware of what an oxymoron all of it is.  Every party has it's good (FDR & Nixon) and it's bad (LBJ & Bush(s).  I guess that makes me an independent, but in PA you can't vote in the primaries if you're an independent.  So, like all things political, the Republican philosophy is great in theory, and bad in practice... but I had to register as something.

         Yes, it's going to be a long hard wait until day 4 of   24  .  So, what is left on Tuesday's between now and January 2005?  Check out  urlLink   The Jury   .  This new show from Fox promises to be a little more than the dominating L & O and CSI fad fare of television.  The Jury is from Barry Levinson and   Homicide   and   Oz   writer Tom Fontana.  Tuesday night, Fox is airing a double stuffing for the premier, 8 to 10 p.m.  Oh, and for you boys, the show stars Shalom Harlow, supermodel who in her day but the cat in catwalk. If you miss it, I'm sure Fox will rerun and rerun the eps.  I'll post a review on Wednesday.  Even though The Simple Life is coming back to haunt us, thank god Fox remembered scripted television.

      What once was lost is now found.  Last night,  urlLink Arrested Development's  "lost" episode made it to air, no thanks to constant prempting by Fox.  Quite possibly the best of the bunch the episode pulled no punches, from low carbs to the Iraq war.  The best plot turn this side of the first season of  24 , has Michael Bluth discovering that his family business was building Sadams palaces.  Now Papa Bear, is on the run to avoid "light" treason charges.  October, and season 2, can't come fast enough.  Sidenote:  The Arrested Development site on  urlLink TV Tome , has a funny anedote from David Cross, Tobias.   ...the scene in which the family gorges on high-carbohydrate foods (thereby abandoning their "Atkins" regimen). After each take, most of the actors spit the food into nearby buckets. The reason, of course, was that they wanted to avoid consuming the carbohydrates. David Cross noted the irony of the fact that the fictional characters eventually recognized the absurdity of obsessive fad dieting -- a revelation that somehow eluded the real people who portrayed them.

         Okay, so, I'm only really touching on this well, because it's going to be news that you just can't get away from everywhere else.  So, here, let's get it out there and move on.  This weekend  Jennifer Lopez  snagged her 3rd hubby,  Marc Anthony , 5 days after he got a quickie divorce from his wife and kids.  J. Lo., as she proclaimed herself, is starting to give husband stealing, diamond loving divas a bad name.  She's now on husband number 3 before hitting 35.  We all got to see a new side of the tablicious demanding diva over the past year... bitch rumours fly fast and furiously, including that Jenny from the block, being a more hip hop than Hollywood princess, demands to be treated extravagantly by everyone, even during brief "charity" appearances. Somewhere between Amelda Marcos, Joan Crawford, Suzanne Sommers, and Elizabeth Taylor, Miss Lopez-Noa-Judd-Anthony has definitely made a name for herself, but not through any artistic talent.  I really loved her in   Out of Sight   too.  Oh well, such potential devoured by ego.  Can't wait for the J. Lo. True Hollywood Story.

      What an election year it's shaping up to be.  Today, George Tenet resigned from the CIA for "person reasons".  Maybe, "I personnally hate the president" or "I feel personally responsible for the death of thousands".  Who knows, but the news is by the time I turn 25, he'll be gone.  Visit CNN for more on  urlLink details  on the current situation, W's (Karl Rove's) response, and the 911 hearings.

            Sherry Lansing, Jonathan Dolgen, Leslie Moonves, Tom Freston   There has been some shakin' going on.  This week  Mel Karmazin  resigned not so quietly from Viacom (CBS, MTV, Nickolodeon, Paramount, UPN, etc.) This cleared the way for the heads of the Networks ( Tom Freston ) and the Broadcast ( Les Moonves ) wings to share his duties moving up the corporate chain.  Les Moonves now has more power (the guy who wouldn't air  The Reagans  mini).  The next day  Jonathan Dolgan  (co chair of Paramount with  Sherry Lansing )resigned because he didn't feel reporting to Freston (MTV head guy) would benefit him and the studio.  Now, if that's not enough, some good might come of all of this.  Mr.  Eisner , the meniacal man managing Disney and former Pepsi Chair, might now have some very stiff competition.  Eisner most likely will lose the Disney partnership with the uber profitable Pixar (Headed by Mr. Mac himself,  Steve Jobs ).   Roy Disney  is already leading a crusade to oust Eisner who isn't quite sitting pretty with stockholders.  Eisner also was the major road block to the release of   Fahrenheit 911   and   The Passion of the Christ  .  ABC is declining and Disney's non Pixar animations aren't doing so well (Home on the Range).  Eisner might just get his upcommin's yet.  The sad part, WHAT THE F*CK do these people know about film... most of them anyway!  In a perfect world, films would be made by produces and executives that love film.  Sounds strange and radical, I know, but stay with me.  Long, long, ago in an orange grove far far away, a place called Hollywood was born.  Here, people like  Louis B. Mayer, Cecil B. DeMile, Mary Pickford  and  Charlie Chaplan, Jack Warner , and  Walt Disney  reigned.  These super-producers ran the film industry as a loving dictatorship.  There was no room to cross these lads, or your entertainment career was over.  But, on the up turn, these men and women loved films... they LOVED film.  The bargined for the best talent contracts in the business and everyone came to work, churned out a pic, and went home to there families.  This was called The Studio System.  The problem... the studio system left very few people in control and no room for artistic deviation.  In Europe and Japan, their was no studio system, there was simply an all powerful director or  autuer .  In France, it was called New Wave.  Men like  Goddard, Tati, Renior , and the like sprung up with cinematic experiments rooted in the countries rich history for fine art.  Film became a canvass for the next generation.  So, like always, the Hollywood directors-for-hire looked to Europe for culture guidelines.  Men like  Alfred Hitchcock  who had been scorn by the studio system (check out the backstory on  Rebecca  sometime) longed to have the creative freedom of the French, Italian, German, and Japanese autuers.  Actors and actresses no longer wished to be tied to one major studio and looked to compete for the best parts and the best scripts in town.  And so, with revolting talent, the Studio System began to crumble.  The 60's and the 70's seemed great while the industry was in anarchy.  Flms like  The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Midnight Cowboy, The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown, A Clockwork Orange, The Graduate, Dog Day Afternoon, One Flew Over the Coo Coo's Nest , and  Manhattan  came from this era of artistic freedom.  Men on the streets of New York were telling gritty stories as focus racked from a crumbling Hollywood.  Even big budget musicals like  West Side Story  had a more edgy New York setting.  The American Independent was born.  New York wasn't just for theater anymore.  and then... The studios, with their patriarchs gone, looked for saviors.  Saddly, their cries were answered.  Like weakened city states, they were each picked up by larger conglomerates (or empires) looking to make a quick buck by restoring the studios to their prior glory.  But, what do business men know about film?  Bring on the 80's.    Artists need businessmen yes, but this doesn't make businessmen artists.  In fact, the two seem quite contray to the other, yet can, sometimes form a symbiotic relationship.  The problem now more than ever, money rules.  If a western makes money... every company in the country starts making westerns... or disaster films... or kitchy romantic comedies.  The genre or gimmick then plays itself out.  Hollywood had become a land of fad cookie cutter projects.  Actors, looking for more of a challenge, started occassionly lending their talents to the NY scene which still hope for another 1970's type renaissance.  While films like  Pulp Fiction, Monster , and  Dazed and Confused  fight and claw their way out into mainstream consciousness, as a whole, the independent has never risen again to it's former power.     The modern era.. There has been some change.  Well, not necessarily change as much as labling.  Each studio now has it's "Independent" shingle to play to the arthouse crowd.  Don't forget, each of these shingles is still owned by only a couple people from the buy outs of the passed decades.  Columbia/Tri-Star is Sony, Warner Brothers and New Line/Fine Line is AOL Time Warner, Universal is General Electric, 20th Century Fox is owned by  Ruppert Murdoch  (global meglomaniac), Miramax and Buena Vista by Disney, and Paramount by Viacom.  No one cares about the films anymore, just the money.  So, considering all of this, what hope is there?  I see the film industry as very similar to the former soviet union.  Yes Stalin and Lenin weren't the greatest men in the world, but on the upside, there was bread.  When capitalism replaced socialism, the ring bells of freedom brought the walls down.  You are free now!  Be like us!  But Russians soon found capitalism to be the enemy.  Now they are starving and surround by gangsters and modern day pirates hording the money and the bread, blue jeans, and toilet paper.  Many now long for the days of lesser freedom and more stability... the days when Russia was great.  Now, I long for a studio system.  Most of the studios don't ever have "studio" lots anymore.  Universal City is more about theme parks then sets.  Studios use independent sound stages or work in Canada. A world where films are made by those who love films.    What's this historical tirade all about.  Well, I just wanted to say that I long for a world where Disney can finance great epics and use the procedes for Miramax to fund negative pick ups of independent gems.  A world where there is home and community in entertainment once more. Where studio heads don't fear losing their jobs for taking a chance with originality and truely valuing talent.  One day, I hope for a world where  drama overshines cliche, story supercedes FX's, and work is stable.  Hooray for Hollywood.

      Normally, I don't get that excited when old white men decide to sit down for a chat, but this is different, this is  President Clinton .   Dan Rather  has scored and interview with the former head honcho to promo his memoirs, My Life, on the June 20 edition of  60 Minutes . This is most likely the first time I will ever tune in 60 minutes without my grandpa doing the tuning.  Oh well, I'm getting old.

      Today I read a brilliant article, the national column by  Mike Harden  called "2004: Simple Choice, really."  I've tried to find a link to the article but failed.  Basically, Mr. Harden breaks down voting decisions to a majority answer of 12 questions.  Simplification for an age of too much propaganda and inflametory commentary, not to mention the politically ignorant.  Anyway, as a liberal republican, I decided to take the test.  Being an  urlLink  ABB   person, I was slightly suprised by some of my choices. My answers are in  bold.   Fellow Bloggers... take the test yourself and let your results in the comment window.  Here are Mr. Harden's 12 questions to determain your vote in 2004:  1. The golf couse is packed when you arrive to play a round.   The starter offers you a chance to join one of the two foursomes.  Would you choose Bush or Kerry?  Kerry.  He gives me the sense he plays to win.  In that case, my game would improve being pitted against a competitor.   2. Your job requires you to leave town on business for two weeks.  Which candidate would you trust to watch your dog?  Bush.  While not necesarily enviromentally friendly, I see him as an animal guy.  I picture Bush being entertained by the puppy and not ditching the dog for more "important" matters.   3. You and your police partner are poised on the porch of a crack house, guns drawn, and about to enter.  You yell "cover me".  Would would you rather have by your side?  Kerry.  No question, do you want the Texas ranger who's Vietnam experience involved campaign work in Alabama... or a man who came home with his life and was responsible for saving others?   4. Your sister is about to start dating again after a bad marriage and an ugly divorce.  Whom would you want showing up at the door with a bouquet?  Bush.  While not exactly charming, he seems weak willed when it comes to women and he comes from an oil family.  He's rich and has no backbone... the perfect lap dog for a scorned woman.   5. Fate has decreed that tomorrow you will be flattened by a runaway beer truck.  You must choose Kerry or Bush to finish the business of parenting your children.  Which one?  Kerry.  Although I would kind of fear him being an apsentee dad, I know he'd raise the children to be an intellectual with a broad view and not force different religious beliefs upon them.   6. Assume that George W. Bush and John F. Kerry are administrators of a pair of private nursing homes.  Not only beholden to ther patients, they are obligated to their investors too. Compelled to place your mother in one of the homes, who would you choose to balance profits against patient care?  Bush.  This is the hardest question to choose from the two.  Definately a choice of two evils.  I think Kerry would be much more money conscious and have the ability to run a nursing home efficiently.  Efficiently being the problem.  He'll have the balls to make the hard decisions.  Bush on the other hand will destroy the budget and get vastly confused by the numbers, but I think he would do what he thought was best for the people and lie to the stockholders about it.   7. You are going for the big prize on "Who wants to be a Millionaire." Will it be Bush or Kerry you want for your life line?  Kerry.  Is the question, did Sadam possess weapons of distruction?  Kidding asside, Bush gets injured by pretzels, and was a C student.  He's not the trivia wiz I want getting my back.  Look how hard of a time he has simply dealing with our intelligence agencies.   8. A friend has offerd you a week free at a beach front rental as long as you don't mind sharing the place with one of the two candidates... which one?  Bush.  If i'm going to spend the weekend with someone, of course I going to choose the rich playboy with the cocaine and alcohol issues.  I'm sure he throws a hell of a party, especially without Laura around.   9. Lost in the wood in a January blizzard, you have only one hope for deliverance: Bush or Kerry.  Kerry.  Again, Bush gets injured by pretzels.  Not trusting his survival skills.   10. Imagine yourself the first lady, about to descend from the White House living quarters to an important state dinner in the east room. Catching sight of yourself in the mirror, you feel dirven to ask, "does this dress make me look fat?" Who's answer do you trust the most?  Bush.  Kerry would tell me what I wanted to hear to keep me happy through dinner and insure some hot sex later that night.  Bush doesn't think before he speaks.  Therefor, I trust that he will reply with the first thing that pops into his head.   11. From you deathbed, you bid your kin to summon a priest that you might make your last confession.  Will it be Father Bush or Father Kerry?  Kerry.  I'm not Catholic, so this question doesn't weigh as heavy.  But, I'd probably have alot to confess and Bush doesn't seem to have much of an attention span.   12.  You and your spouse have tried without success to have a child.  Advised that a sperm bank might hold the only promise of concetption, you must select between donors... Bush or Kerry?  Kerry.  Okay, so my child will either have a long face or be stupid?  I choose intellect over vanity.  Also, addiction, not like arrogance, seems to be a genetic trait... one I'd like to by pass.   So, that's 7 for  Kerry  and 5 for W.  Now, I remember high school.  I'm 24... so it wasn't  that  long ago.  Anyway, Mr. Kerry, like in high school a 7/12 is a Failing grade... Once again, Damned if we do, Damned if we don't.   What do you think?

         It's on it's off and back on again.  Being the hottest musical to hit broadway in decades is one thing.  Transfering that to the screen in another entirely.     urlLink Rent    was a musical for a generation, like  Hair  or  Jesus Christ Superstar , and now it's back on track to ensnare all those Gen Xer's back into the theater... this time on the screen.     Moulin Rogue  and  Chicago  proved that musicals don't have to be for blue haired ladies dying to see Phantom, Les Mis, or Cats.   Chris Columbus  (Home Alone) is currently set to direct the rejuvinated piece with more promise of  reinvention. Jumping at the chance earlier in his career,  Justin Timberlake's  rising star might just earn him the pary he's been desiring for so long. Justine Timberlake went from boy band to Pop Prince in one foul swoop,  Justified .  His solo album, live performances, and stand out hosting duties on SNL this past season, has proved JT has grown up and is more than Britney's curly haired bitch.       Mr. Timberlake has made it known for sometime that he wants to take on the role that earned Adam Pascal a Tony... and why not?  His presence would bring a whole new generation to a story and production that charged the hearts and minds of so many less than a decade ago.  Now, if only  Taye Diggs   (Chicago) and  Jesse Martin  (Law & Order)could get their original groove back and on...  and maybe a little love for JT's rumoured bride , the Divine  Cammie D , we could step into a whole new Season of Love. Yeah, you know it!

       Mark Waters , director of this summers hit   Mean Girls   and the iconoclastic   House of Yes  , has treked back to Disney to helm  Ghosts of Girlfriends Past .  Saddly, after reading the basic plot, this movie way too much resembles my own screenplay in the works, only a male version.  Proving once again, if all my ideas are great.  Only I'm not getting paid for them.  Ironically, who was the director I most wanted to handle my screenplay in the works... yep, you guest it, W himself.  Oh the irony! Waters previously joined with Disney for the breakout Lohan starer and remake   Freaky Friday   last summer.

         In a deal secured between Lions Gate Films, IFC Films, and the brothers Weinstein's Fellowships Adventure Group (a temporary shingle established for the soul purposed of distributing F911), we have a release date!   June 25 , fireworks are gonna fly, the critics with critique, and the pompous self important commentators will release their opinions with headlines like "slanderous", "treason", "traitor", and "sleazan?" And we thought   The Passion of the Christ   was fun... In fact, I suspect, that many theaters will be filled with Bushites rallying ammunition for the impending debates.  No matter what you think, you won't be able to escape the battle of opinion. Get ready to feed the flames as this summer heats up with   Fahrenheit 911  .

       Harvey  and brother  Bob Weinstein  have paid  Disney  $6 million for all encompassing rights to the controversal  Michael Moore  doc,   Fahrenheit 911  .  Things are looking up for a July 2nd release date.  The only problem is that Moore message might get lost in the summer shuffle including   Spiderman  's web in a weekend he has staked his claim upon.  While offering effective counter programing, "911" isn't out of the water yet.  The Weinstien's have 1 month to find a distributor, open markets, and manufacture the prints... not to mention generate public awareness.  Surely, Fox news will generate enough heat to get the word out.  The right wingers are already starting to crucify Moore's film.  At this point,  Lions Gate  (the rescuers distributors of   Dogma  ) look key to take on the responsibilities... hopefully it's not too late.

      This is an exciting week indeed for potential powerhouse projects:      First,  Reese Witherspoon  is ditching the blonde ditz/period piece alternating routine of the past couple of years to produce and star in   The Reckoning  , a thriller about a female New York Times photojournalist who follows a team to Cambodia to recover the bones of lost soldiers.  Angkor Watt, he we come!   Speaking of blonde bombshells, a girl power pairing of  Charlize Theron  and   Boys Don't Cry   director  Kimberly Pierce  are going to conquer   The Ice at the Bottom of the World  , an independent in the American South focusing on rednecks.  No superfreeze special FX required.  Mad Max gets his girl power:  As if  Mel Gibson  hasn't made Rome look bad enough, no wait, that's right, the Jews killed  Jesus  in   The Passion of the Christ  , Mad Max is set to take on   Warrior  , a film about Boudicca, the Celtic/Irish queen who took down Rome... at least on her island.  I'm picturing Kiera Knightly's Guinevere.  Destined to be compared to   Braveheart  ,  Warrior  could be a great piece of mythical history.  But, will Mel include a back story for this Gothic queen or is this just a film for the Irish?  Get ready for blood.

         According to Eonline, the Today Show, People, and numerous tabloids America's Sweetheart,  Julia Roberts , is pregnant with twins.  Her PR camp has confirmed that the dynamic duo have a release date set early in 2005.  Some other sources have claimed Miss Sweetheart has been frequenting fertility clinics and that the twin are the result of In-Vitro fertilization.  After Reese, Catherine, Marcia, Kate, and most recently Gwyneth, Julia was feeling left out of the "it" circle.  I see many  Pea in the Pod  purchases for showing off her double stuffed bod for the next 9 months.

       urlLink The Day After Tomorrow 4/10      As far as special effect laden eye candy with splashes of over emotional dribble go, this summer box office blockbuster was worth the ride.  While it's certainly no   28 days Later   (Zombies are inherently more interesting than ice), director  Roland Emmerich  makes weather quite frightening to usher in the apocalypse.    Yes, it's true the Hollywood sign get swallowed by a twister and a giant wave engulfs Manhattan.  But is there more to the movie?  While not terribly much more, there is some.  The "plot" takes us on the trek that a paleo-climatologist (ancient weatherman),   urlLink Dennis Quaid  , makes to find his smarter, and hotter, than average son,   urlLink Jake Gyllenhaal  .  Of course, that develops after the screenwriters take an hour to tell us why we global warming is causing an ice age.     There was good:  Debating on burning Nietzsche for life saving heat in the NYC Public Library, or saving the published word for future civilizations to appreciate.  ... and bad:  Wolves escape from the Central Park Zoo and randomly attack people. A subplot that was completely pointless.  In fact, they aren't even killed for food... which is obviously what you would do with a wolves when you're living off Frito lay and hershey's.  While we do get the mass carnage that disaster films, and Roland Emmerich, are notorious for, it comes at a price.  No, not just the ticket, but having to endure the environmental preaching throughout the film.  Personally, I'm all for the environment, but this was not a film to further the cause.  It certainly was not the film to "wake up" western civilization.  The preaching was not in an effective eye opening way, but in a scolding parent kind of way.  Politicians and commuters get there upcommin's for scorning mother nature... and she's a bitch!  If you still didn't get the point, there are happy play by play commentators in the Mir space station that chime in throughout the film as well, "Have you ever seen the air so clean?".  So, with ice as the enemy, what could be a satisfying pay off.  Okay well actually, we, American's, Europeans, and Japanese, were the enemy, but let's pretend it was the ice.  So what could possibly be the pay off against ice?  Erupting volcanoes?  Giant Lasers?  It's not like taking down spaceships... it's ICE!  Well, I guess you'll have to watch the movie to find out. It's not cinematic greatness, nor does it have spellbinding FX that live up to the hype.  But, if you're a wait-to-renter, it's best to buy a ticket or skip the film altogether... TV viewing will kill this film.  The Day After Tomorrow  is an adequate treat for a two hour means to beat the summer heat.

      According to an Associated Press report posted on  urlLink MSNBC , the federal anti-trust regulators okay'd the merger between  urlLink Sony  and  urlLink BMG  (Bertelsmann Music Group).&nbsp; Last week, the EU also approved the merger of the German based BMG,&nbsp;"Despite concerns from independent music companies, European regulators determined there was insufficient evidence that the 50-50 joint venture would harm consumers."   With the merger occuring within the next couple weeks, Sony and BMG&nbsp;issued statements detailing their motivation for the merger,&nbsp;declining CD sales and the threat from illegal downloading on the Internet.   The obvious downfall for musicians and independent labels is the fear&nbsp;the merger will make it even harder for indie artists to breakthrough the mega conglomorates tight hold on the industry.&nbsp; In&nbsp;a post merger landscape, there would be 4 companies controling over&nbsp;80 percent of the world music market: Sony-BMG, Vivendi-Universal Music Group, AOLTW - Warner Music Group,&nbsp;and EMI Group.   Which once again brings me to the point that we need Studios that care about films, we need Music companies that care about music, we need News groups that care about delievering unbias news.&nbsp; And as far as the "harming consumer" arguement goes... who is willing to stand up and argue the detrimental effect of lack of plurality?&nbsp; Will consumers be harmed by price fixing, inflation, etc?&nbsp; The decided effect is no.&nbsp; The only harm the regulatories question is money.&nbsp; The $ is the only sign they see.&nbsp; Although to be historically accurate and blunt, the music industry has been known for price fixing since it's infancy.&nbsp; Do you really think $18 for a new cd was worth it?&nbsp; Probably,&nbsp;and you paid it, right?&nbsp;But, was that really&nbsp;a "fair market price"? &nbsp;At least now, prices have somewhat dropped to around the $12-$15 range on new releases unlike the pre-Napster days when I was in high school.&nbsp; The only seaming way to combat the congloms is to rally as a generation around quality and not what we're fed.&nbsp; If you looking for some great music that doesn't fit the cookie cutter sounds of today, it's out there and accessable through the internet (check out my friend  urlLink Jon's Blog ).&nbsp; Of course, once a following develops, bands and contract are bought up by the congloms, white washed, glossed over, and distributed to the masses.... (Liz Phair&nbsp;- In the end does it matter who brought you to where you are now, or are the legions of pre-teen girls plenty swell enough to maintain your chosen life style?)&nbsp;Remeber, Jimi Hendrix was a&nbsp;one hit wonder.&nbsp; What would the congloms have done with his&nbsp;contract?  &nbsp;The point... which I think I digressed to far from, is that we are "harmed" maybe not in our wallets, but in our souls.   We as a public and&nbsp;our goverment, have allowed, NewsCorp, AOLTimeWarner, General Electric, Viacom, and Sony to dominate all of our media be it music, film, tv, news, or even print.&nbsp; And what a dysfuntional family it all is when the news outlets criticize the music or film products... when everyone pretends to be objective.&nbsp; What chance does that give art anymore?&nbsp;   At least the  urlLink de'Medici  family cared.

      Returning from it's Spring/Summer hiatus,  urlLink Real Time with Bill Mahr  premiers Friday&nbsp;at 11 p.m. as  urlLink Bill &nbsp;welcomes filmmaker  Michael Moore ,  Ralph Nader ,  Rep. David Dreir , and former Canadian Prime Minister  Kim Campbell.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Campaign of 2004 heats up, Bill Maher and his guests analyze the Democratic convention; and the minds and motives of  George Bush  and  John Kerry .         If you've never caught an episode of Real Time... start.&nbsp; It's yet another reason to pay that minimal fee for quality   urlLink HBO   entertainment.&nbsp; Bill "Too Truthful for Disney" Mahr was booted from ABC's line up because his show,  Politically Incorrect ... was, well, too politically incorrect.&nbsp; A blend of Jon Stewart (comedy) and Bill O'Reilly (strong opinions), Mahr is an independent liberal who doesn't back down from issues.&nbsp; He's proud to drive a hybrid and is quite distainful of the Bush's.&nbsp; The show offers lively debate featuring guests such as  Ann Coulter, Howard Dean, Dennis Miller,&nbsp;Tommy Thompson, Russel Simmons , and more.&nbsp; Bill's guests include independents, conservatives, and liberals from all walks of society including pundits, politicians, entertainers, and more.&nbsp; No topic is to hot or off limits during the panel discussions.&nbsp; Earlier this year Bill tackeled the enrivonment, obesity, Iraq,  The Passion of the Christ , the FCC and more.   No matter what your opinion, watch a show where you're welcomed to share it.&nbsp; And never tune out with catching Bill's New Rules segmant.&nbsp; To celebrate Bill's return, I thought I'd share my favorite New Rules Closing.&nbsp; This segment is from  urlLink September 26, 2003 ... the finale of Season One and the lead in to the California Recall.     "..And finally, New Rule: Lay off California!&nbsp;  You know, the rest of America has been having quite a laugh at California’s expense lately. But let’s remember this: California has a lot of people.&nbsp; And the reason it does is lots of other people in other states saying, “Fuck this, I’m outta here!” And then those people come here to California, and people ask them, “Don’t you miss the winters?” No, strangely enough, I don’t. Much the same way I don’t miss slamming a car door on my hands.   Make fun of California, but if it weren’t for California, East Coast rappers would have to shoot musicians from Branson. If it weren’t for California, there’s be almost no TV, and you’d have to come home at night and actually talk to your family.   You know, the rest of America feels about California the way the rest of the world feels about America. They hate us because we do what we want. They think we’re too blessed and too free, and it makes them nuts in the dreary hovels of Kabul and Tikrit and Lubbock, Texas.&nbsp; They pray to their threadbare gods that we’ll get what we deserve. But it won’t happen. Because you never know what we’re going to do here next.   We elected Ronald Reagan and Jerry Brown. We’re home to Disney and Hustler, the Partridge Family and the Manson Family.&nbsp; We can drink a Mudslide and a Sex on the Beach during an actual mudslide while having sex on the beach! Our farms feed the world, and Calista Flockhart lives here. We have bears and great white sharks. And even our washed-up actors are allowed to kill one blonde chick. We invented surfing and cyber-porn and LSD and the boob job. And if we didn’t,&nbsp;who would have.   We have oranges, free oranges, everywhere. What grows on the trees in Scranton, fucker?! We have a real hockey team named after a hockey team in a movie! Our Indian casinos could kick your Indian casinos’ ass. We give our illegal aliens driver’s licenses. And we have a guy running for governor who digs group sex.   Would anywhere else in America trade places with L.A. or San Francisco in a piss-soaked New York minute? You bet they would. Because I don’t recall anyone ever writing a song called “I Wish They All Could Be Rhode Island Girls”! ."

      Okay, so with the lack of L & O reruns on Thursday nights, the boy and I have settled into watching  urlLink Celebrity Poker  at 9 p.m. Thursdays on Bravo.&nbsp;The main reason we&nbsp;kept watching was the&nbsp;host,&nbsp;Dave Foley ( Kids in the Hall, News Radio ) who makes whatever he touches even better or at least funnier.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Due to lack of internet access this week, I was unable to add a reminder post to check it out this week of all weeks.&nbsp; Lucky for you, there are still chances to catch this fantastic episode.&nbsp; Last night's game featured Will Arnett, Jason Bateman,&nbsp; David Cross, Peter Facineli, and Judy Greer...        &nbsp;  One of these things is not like the other... one of these things is not the same!  &nbsp;

      Darren can be or mean many things to me.&nbsp; Darren can be one of two stars of Bewitched (watch the film next summer!).&nbsp; Darren can be my tragic teenage love story.&nbsp;&nbsp;Darren can be the ruler of  urlLink The Darren Keeny Movie Experience  and one of my bestest friends in whole wide world.   But the Darren I Heart at this moment is Darren Arronofsky.&nbsp; The director that definitely earned his "film by" credits with  Pi  and  Requiem for a Dream , has been announced as the director of  The Watchmen , a DC Comics adaptation.&nbsp; Arronofsky's post Requiem projects of  Batman: Year One  and  The Fountain  have become trapped in "development hell" leaving&nbsp;us Darren-less. &nbsp;Although this past spring, it was announced that Hugh Jackman would be stepping into and reviving  The Fountain  after  Brad Pitt  drop out to pursue Troy, so there is hope for the post matrixy sci fi vision of colonial latin America and the fountain of youth project yet.&nbsp; Not being a comic connoisseur, I have no idea what  The Watchman  is about, but Arronofsky is one of the most visually powerful directors that owns and transforms the script to screen.&nbsp; Requiem didn't have powerful writing, it was the acting, cinematography, editing and directing that made it great.&nbsp; Here's to getting one of these films in the can!   Here's a tidbit from the  urlLink Joblo  Article:       Confirming the internet reports, it was confirmed today that Darren Aronofsky will direct and produce the live-action adaptation of Alan Moore's seminal graphic novel THE WATCHMEN. ...Moore promised after the abyssmal LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN that he would never again option one of his comics for the big screen but unfortunately for him, he agreed to the WATCHMEN movie before that.

       Picked up by Lions Gate at a film festival this year...   Saw   has been brought to my attention by word of mouth (Thanks, Chris).&nbsp; This horror film has been compared to  Se7en  for obvious reason after you watch the trailer.&nbsp;  Se7en  is the primary reason I went to film school.&nbsp;  Fight Club  is the reason I stayed.&nbsp;   &nbsp;  From the general buzz,   Saw   is aparently  balls to the wall  next generation home grown American horror.&nbsp; For you horror fanatics who have been looking to the far east for thrills and chills in leiu of any quality domestic product (are you listening Jessica Biel & Michael Bay),   Saw   is apparently your answer.

        urlLink       For those in need of Balls, check out   urlLink  Amazon   ... they sell everything!     Okay, so at some point out in CA the  Governator  called the Dems who are blocking his current whatevers " Girlie Men " in obvious reference to the Arnold deprecating skit on SNL in the early 90's.  &nbsp;  Was the Governor unprofessional and out of line?&nbsp; Perhaps, but he's not your normal governor... unless you live in Minnesota (Hi,  urlLink Jon !).&nbsp; But, what is more offensive is the whining display&nbsp;of pathetic weakness that the democrats sunk too by&nbsp;accusing the Governator of homo phobic remarks.  &nbsp;  Get the F*ck over it!&nbsp; By being so catty the Democrats in their sanctimonious defense of&nbsp;an inability to take a joke have solidified their "girliness".&nbsp; This whole situation reminds me of Dramatic and Visual writing classes in college.&nbsp; When boys (gay and straight boys mind you) faced harsh criticism they lashed out at the professor, student, or whoever it was that bruised their fragile tormented artist ego.&nbsp; When girls were criticized, they cried.&nbsp; (I don't think I ever did either, thank god.) Both responses are quite childish and unprofessional and wouldn't fly in a meeting outside of NYU undergrad workshops... Oh except in CA legislature.  &nbsp;  Arnold is just the boy lashing out at those who think he is inadequate and the democrats are just girls crying to whoever will boost their self esteem.&nbsp; Both are pathetic.&nbsp; I am thoroughly appalled at the lack of common sense, general professionalism, and all out balls that people seem to have lost.  &nbsp;  I don't have children yet, but how am I supposed to teach them to debate and attack the issues, not the person.&nbsp; How am I supposed to say name calling is wrong, work towards a beneficial compromise.&nbsp; I'm too young to be so disillusioned.&nbsp; Everyone in power is acting like kindergartners.&nbsp; I am issuing a time out for everyone in California.

      Sunday night the new series  urlLink Entourage  premiered on HBO.&nbsp; I don't know what I was watching, but I wasn't watching HBO.&nbsp; Monday, a normally bleak night of TV for yours truly, is often reserved for numerous L &amp; O reruns between USA and TNT.&nbsp; Last night, TNT premiered The Grid which I had absolutely no desire to watch.&nbsp; I get enough terrorism from Fox News and Jack Bauer.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Anyway, while flipping through the hundred of digital cable channels I have and still not finding much, HBO caught my attention with a hilarious new show... It was the pilot of  urlLink Entourage .&nbsp; Granted this HBO, home to the best comedies (besides  Arrested Development  &amp;&nbsp; The Simpsons )&nbsp;on TV with  Curb Your Enthusiasm  and  Sex and the City .&nbsp;  Entourage  seems to pick up where "Sex" left off, except in LA, and except with boys, and the boys are 20 somethings not 30 somethings... okay, so it's not really picking up at all except filling a vacant time slot.  &nbsp;       &nbsp;  If you aren't tuning in... START.&nbsp; I'm so happy I caught the pilot.&nbsp; After 3 1/2 years at  urlLink NYU , a summer in LA with an agent&nbsp;in training, and a best friend trying to put his acting skills to profitable use without selling out... this show hit much closer to home than  Sex  ever did.&nbsp; And I was a single (sometimes even desperate) professional lady in Manhattan... but $500 manolos... sorry, I went to NYU.&nbsp; I can't afford those.  &nbsp;  The most memorable performance and role in the Entourage pilot came from  Jeremy Piven  ("Old School," "The Larry Sanders Show").&nbsp; Piven&nbsp;plays Ari the cliched CAA/ICM/WMA agent trying desperately to manage the career of an up and comer played by  Adrian Grenier .&nbsp; (I affectionate referred to him as... hey isn't that the boy from that&nbsp;movie&nbsp;with Clarissa and the Britney video?).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Where a show goes from the pilot is always up in the air, but for at least a half hour Monday night, I felt like I was back in the dorms at NYU with my best boys and their roomates... Nostalgia, great and pathetic all at the same time.  &nbsp;      Entourage airs a new episode Sunday nights at 10 p.m. with repeats throughout the week.

      YAY!    I was just thinking the other day to myself, hmmm... I wonder when  urlLink Season 4 of Angel  is coming out.  As I logged onto  urlLink Amazon , there it was under "Your Recommendations".  Yes ladies and gents, mark your calendars for September 7th (Baby, that's just in time for our anniversary, hint hint)   urlLink         Okay... what's with the cover art for this season (the green one).   Boreanez  and  Carpenter  look like celeb impersonators of themselves.  And these two are on every season's cover as you can see.   urlLink Buffy's covers  rotate the back ground to reflect who the major characters of the season are... for instance the introduction of Dawn, Faith ( Eliza Dusku's  leather pants wearing slayer persona) and even Black Willow gets her cover due.  I want my  Karthiser /Conner please.       Okay, I digress.  I've only been embracing the Buffyverse for the past couple years.  Without a doubt, Season 3 of Angel is the strongest, tightest, saddest season of broadcast television, possibly ever.  It's just damn brilliant.  To follow that up with Season 4 which is plagued with dirty little rumors about a knocked up star vs bitchy creator bout that supposedly seriously altered the planned story arc... and don't forget just north of LA in Sunnydale the world was ending! So, it seams that Season 4 of Angel is destined to go no where but down... at least that's what I anticipate. All I really know is that Karthiser and Carpenter got it on and beget "The Beast".  See, only bad things happen when you bed the enchanted son of the vampire you're in love with. (Confused? Watch season 3) I only caught bits and pieces of 4, normally Faith-centric due to my man's overwhelming urge to see Eliza in leather pants... can you really blame him.       ON A FANTASTIC NOTE... Mr. James "I would do extremely naughty and down right dirty things to you if only given the chance"  Marsters  has commented that  Joss  approached him about doing 1 of a series of 4 Buffy TV movies (don't know if it would be WB or UPN).  Aparently it's a 4 part all or nothing deal each revolving about specific characters... assumingly, they would all intertwine.  Marsters, unlike Boreanez &  Geller , loves his cult fame and has declared he will milk his Spikedom for all it's worth.  Has anyone every thought of Spike and Dru: The Muscial or Blondy Bear and the Mad Vampire Nun?  We know James can sing and  Juliet Landau  is psychotically irresistable as his nutty sire and sex kitten: Check Em out... they did date for over 100 years.

      According to  urlLink Variety , Lohan is nearing $7 mil payday for the Petrie-helmed comedy "Lady Luck".     Lindsay Lohan isn't a mean girl anymore -- she's a rich girl. The star of pics including the Mouse House's 2003 sleeper 'Freaky Friday' and this year's Paramount pic 'Mean Girls' is in final negotiations for a payday north of $7 million to topline 'Lady Luck' at New Regency and 20th Century Fox....   urlLink vist Variety for more.      And since I brough LL up, might I add that I believe she has stolen the identity confusing temptress crown from Angelina Jolie.  LL is the new girl so hot that even straight (and sometimes Mean) girls can't help but be sexually attracted to her.  A well endowed, 18 year-old, naturally red headed millionaire... she the walking personification of a wet dream... at least all most of my Xs'dreams anyway.

       urlLink McDormand gets some 'Class':    Frances McDormand  is in negotiations to join  Charlize Theron  in the Warner Bros. Pictures drama  Class Action . The Oscar winners are currently teamed up on  Aeon Flux  for MTV/Paramount Pictures.    urlLink Affleck got squished while crossing the Road:   Ben Affleck has "fallen out" of  Glory Road  for the Walt Disney Co. and Jerry Bruckheimer. According to  urlLink HR Online :   Sources indicated that his departure had to do with his deal -- not the $5 million payday but the  backend points.  To be directed by James Gartner, 'Glory Road' follows the true story of college basketball coach Don Haskins, whose all-black Texas Western team won the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship in 1966. The filmmakers and studio have already started checking the availability of a replacement and may have zeroed in on an actor, which sources say is Josh Lucas, to take over the coaching duties.    Any day Affleck gets screwed is a good day for me.  He's nothing more than the asshole from a Kevin Smith movie that housewives went a little too gaga over back in 2001. Oh, and HE CAN'T ACT either!   THE DREAM GOES ON FOREVER....   Anyone who knows me also knows how much I hate reading.  I know alot about literature, and the stories, the authors. etc. - but I hate fiction.  I just don't have the attention span for it.. go ahead and blame it on the MTV generation.  But, I can also watch 8 straight hours of  The Stand  and not blink.  Anyway, there are 7 books that as a child, adolescent, teenager, and still as an adult that I take very seriously.  So seriously in fact that I dreamed of making them into films one day...  The Chronicles of Narnia . I in fact used to want to name my eventual daughter Narnia. When Harry Potter hit the screen with the Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone, I figured this is the perfect time for "Narnia" to make it to the screen.  The problem, the amount of money to finance the project in a worth while manner would not be given to a 21 year old girl fresh out of film school with not much under her belt as far as directing cred.  But, I pulled out my books and started writing, adapting, making notes from casting to costumes, to themes and camera angles.  And then, in one foul swoop, Walden Media and Walt Disney crushed my dreams.  My only wish is that the film tanks and turns out so horribly that no one will wince when I, as an established film maker, undertake the task of the film 30 years from now, no one accuses me of sacrilidge.  Well, the cast has been announced... and even a snap shot published.  According the the  urlLink New Zealand Herald :   The actors are: Georgie Henley, 9, from West Yorkshire, who plays the lead character Lucy; Skandar Keynes, 12, from London, who plays Edmund; Anna Popplewell, 15, also from London, who plays Susan; and William Moseley, 17, from Gloucestershire, who plays the eldest brother Peter.    They are joined by   James Cosmo , who played Campbell in Braveheart and Mr Renton in Trainspotting, has been confirmed for the role of Father Christmas. He will join the other cast members so far named:  Tilda Swinton  (the White Witch),  Dawn French  (the voice of Mrs Beaver),  James McAvoy  (Mr Tumnus) and  Rupert Everett  (the voice of The Fox).   It was also announced that  Jim Broadbent  would be The Professor.  How does this compare with my dreams... Nicole Kidman or Angelina Jolie for the Witch, Stanley Tucci for Mr. Tumnus, Sean Connery as the professor, and for the Beavers, I always pictured the Billy Crystal character from the  Princess Bride  dressed up like a beaver... the girls from the picture somewhat mesh with my mental images... but Peter is the warrior hero king of the movie (think a teenage Aragon).  What's with lumpy?

      Okay, so it is highly possible to go from a cute, sweet, blonde, hollywood child star and evolve into a talented actress and hollywood powerhouse... Example:       But,  Hillary Duff , you are not that person.  No, unlike  urlLink Fox News  I'm fully aware that I am not "Fair & Balanced".  A line was drawn about a year ago, you're either for Lindsay or for Lizzie.  I ask myself, who was I most like as a teenage girl... LL.  Who was my best friend most like?  Definately LL.  And, if given invitations to two different parties on the same night, who's would I be sure to attend... LL's. Duh!  Okay so I have established myself as anti Duff and seeing that her hit is entitled "So, Yesturday", the door is open for so many bad puns, but I'll refrain.    It seems Miss Duff wants people to pay attention to her and feels the need to comment on  Mary Kate Olsen .  I'm thinking all of this is misscommunitcation and no one told Mary Kate that skin is no longer in! (Buy a Vogue why don't you?) Regardless... this is what the self declared pop princess had to say:   "It's the pressures put on young celebrities. You open a magazine and it's all about someone being too skinny or too fat, no longer pretty, having the wrong hair color or not making it into the most recent popularity poll. (I don't) pretend to know what Mary Kate is going through, but I can understand a bit of it on a certain level. As a young celebrity, there are times when you feel your life is being controlled by so many other things that eating is the last thing you really do have some control over." Duff then comforted her worried fans saying about any personal anorexia: "I love food too much. I eat sensibly, but I do love to eat."  WOW that's a relief.  I can now sleep at night reassured that Lizzi isn't starving herself.  In fact, she's quite into stuffing food in her mouth and LL's ex into her... No wait. Nevermind, those were just evil rumors.  Duff's too good for that.     And as for a comment on Miss Mary Kate... Anorexia, Bulemia, and more commonlly derivatives of the two are very common, personal, and serious disorders.  A month in "rehab" doesn't help that.  It takes counseling, understanding, and making peace with your body and the food you put into it.  Now, if you have a cocain habit, a month in detox can do wonders.  It's not going to make you stop doing it or more importantly, stop wanting to do it, but it will clean your blood stream out and make facing every day "hardships" with a sober mind a little easier.  What does this prove?  That no matter if you grew up in a trailer park or one of the richest girls in the world, life can be hard... but it's hard for everyone.  That's what growing up is all about, Mary Kate.

      To my 3 or maybe 4 loyal readers and anyone else who randomly ended up here at the brain drain.  Because of my mini vacation the beginning of the week, the template and side bar will be updated to refect next week.  I know it's out of date, so don't tell me that :0)  And, now that I've seen f911, bush has hopped through my neighborhood, and I've relived my 3 day vacation for this year... the brain drain will get back to what it does best... opinionated, arrogant, often elitist, and sometime superficial babble.  Smootches,

      ...even though it's not my birthday.  No wait, hot damn - it  was  my birthday.  Okay, so instead of recounting the same tale again and again and again to each and all who ask... this is how I spend the big 25.   FRIDAY: Getting Hammered, Nailed, and Screwed after President Bush.   So a couple weeks ago I received VIP invites to both Fat Daddy's and to  urlLink The Hardware Bar  to celebrate my 25th birthday.  Obviously an advertising ploy to get women to show up to their respective establishments, I couldn't resist the promise of free stuff.  Yes, I am that person.  So I took Ben and Bob as my birthday dates to The Hardware Bar (also home to the Girls Gone Wild PA film crew) where I got an ugly t-shirt that declared "I got Hammered, Nailed, and Screwed at the Hardware Bar for my Birthday".  No amount of martinis in the world would get me to put that crappy t shirt on.  On the other hand, I sported my sparkling pink glittery birthday hat with pride... If just for a moment or two.  My other special packages were filled with a bottle of malt liquor with the brass balls to call itself champagne.  One gulp and I have declared this the worst "champagne" I've ever tasted.  So, I passed it to Bob for his judgment who conquered.  Ben then killed was was left of this liquid violation.  So through the bar and down the stairs and through the club into the back room onto a couch we went.  I tried a new martini, and for the first time in nearly two years, became quite intoxicated.  The bar sucks, the club really sucks, the lounge not so bad, and the French Martini... to die for.  After chatting for a minute or two, I stumbled up the stairs to play some skee ball when... there it was... the  mythical machine that Ben has told me about, but I had never seen... The South Park pin ball machine.  I had never attempted to play pinball while drunk, but I figured it couldn't be worse than when I was sober.... and actually I was pretty good.  A few games of skee ball later and Bob delivered Ben and I safely home where I quickly went to sleep all before midnight.  A sign that adult hood crept on me suddenly (kind of like a few boys I've known :0)   .   SATURDAY:  After waking up with a feeling I didn't quite recognize (a hangover) Ben and I were off to Berks or Bucks county PA.  I always get them confused... you know... the one where that M. Night fella shoots all his films.  Okay, well we drove through Reading which I am officially deeming the porn capital of PA and made it in one piece to my aunts country house.  The day was spent relaxing pool side with the fam.  Starting out with some fantastic cold cuts for lunch, blue crabs, roast beast, potatoes, sweet corn, melons and more followed at dinner.  By this time, at least half of the family was "hammered, nailed, and screwed" on their alcohol of choice which made for some interesting annotates.  I also was tossed around the pool by my uncle attempting have me dive from his shoulders.  The day ended up so fun and exhausting that we never made it to the strip club that evening as my uncle promised.  SUNDAY:  By this point I was one of the few people in the house not nursing a hangover.  I woke up in the hay loft of the barn house to a near empty home.  Everyone had gone shopping... So I went out to the pool... lofts and pools are a luxury not enjoyed in our downtown studio apartment.  Then came brunch... starting with my baby's now famous French crepes.  I then ate a red tamale, a green tamale, (I love tamales)a bowl of strawberries, a mimosa, and bourbon grilled pears.  This mini vacation/birthday was turning out to be the best I've eaten in way too long.  Pulling ourselves away from the party, we made the quick skip through Philly an onward to New Jersey... New Jersey, the only state that let's you in for free but charges you to leave.  After making and then checking in to our casino hotel in Atlantic City, we rushed down to the beach to catch the afternoon sun and tide.  Now, after floating in the Pacific... the Atlantic is like muck diving.  I remember trips to Wildwood/Cape May/Ocean City/Atlantic City shores before, often during the 80's and most recently on the way home from my college graduation.  I had NEVER, EVER, EVER seen a beach so dirty disgusting and nasty.  I tried to pretend the sea grime wasn't there... I'm pretty good at denial... and hey at least it wasn't medical waste. But the denial aspect soon failed and we briskly made it back to the room and into the casinos.    .   Granted, I'm not really one to review a casino seeing that  urlLink Bally's  is the first I've ever been too.  The Wild Wild West casino kicked some serious ass.  Granted, the first machine Ben popped a couple of quarters into he won $40.  Not a bad start.  We decided to walk around and check out the surroundings.  We ended up in Caeser's where Ben played a machine randomly and won $50.  Lucky Lucky Lucky.  I was not so.  So we had a nice dinner (batter grilled onions!) and nightcap with the monies that we (ok, Ben) won.  I love a good onion, not to mention chicken wings.  And alas, after our Russian waitress finally brought us a bill for our nightcap, we quickly retired to our room for some much needed sleep.  MONDAY:  And then there was rain.  Okay, so when one hears "scattered thunder showers" at least in reference to humid July mid Atlantic weather, one expects... Okay, so I thought that meant brief yet really intense rains throughout the area most likely in the later afternoon.  Why does it always, always, rain when we go anywhere.  After tanking the last of my gambling monies, we were on the road again headed back home.  By the time we reached suburban Philly, visibility was down to about 2 white dashes of the highway lane lines.  And we had to cross the Walt Whitman bridge.  For any who do not know Ben, he hates suspension bridges... Severely phobic.  But he survived the daunting crossing and so did I, only to find out the road in Philly were flooded from the rain.  Drop after drop pounded and pounded and pounded until finally we came to Valley Forge and I had had enough.  We sought refuge, and lunch, at King of Prussia (PA's version of the Mall of America).  I dragged poor Ben through  urlLink Pottery Barn  and the designer sections of Norstrom's to see the pretty things not available to me in my hometown.  About 2 hours later, we finally made it home... and back to work, reality, and York.  I have to rate this birthday a 10/10 and probably my best since my 21st back in 2000.  22 I worked a 16 hour day at the movie theater in the mall.  I don't remember 23 so that in itself says something.  24 was spend shark watching at Baltimore... where again Ben and I were victim's of torrential harbor storms.  So, I couldn't have had a better birthday... Okay, well if I would have hit the wheel of fortune slots for 1.7 mil that could have made it better... but all in all life is good.

          Besides My Fair Lady and anything by Bob Fosse, musicals have often left something to be desired in my opinion.  Normally, anything by Andrew Lloyd Webber I can live with out.  This week two high concept musical ideas have been announced, and one of which might actually get me up to 42nd street for a muscial for the first time since... since... Phantom I think?       While Most sources are reporting that Marvel wants to adapt a webslinging tuner, I find the following report much more appealing:   .    BUT WHO WILL PLAY THE KNIGHTS WHO SAY NI? David Hyde Pierce, Tim Curry and Hank Azaria tapped to star in Spamalot, the Mike Nichols-directed Broadway version of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The musical debuts in March 2005.      Now that a pairing of commedic genious if i've ever scene one.  Granted, I would love to see Anthony Stewart Head in one of the roles... One because he's British, Two because he makes my heartache and my knees go all squiggly when he sings, and third because I never had the chance to see him in the West End production of Rocky Horror.  Ironic that just this past weekend, we got a desire for the Holy Grail and watched all the riotous maddness for the first time in too long... To see it on broadway next season, I can't wait!

         I thought that I would add that I was shocked and proud to see the immense turnout for  Fahrenhiet 911  in my hometown of York, PA.  The theater was filled with the young and very old.  Young being 18-24, and old being 65-90.  There were a few, but not many, in between.  The woman beside me kept yelling "Shame on you, Mr. Bush" throughout the whole movie while the man behind me commented that "I didn't know there were this many democrats in York."  For the first time in my life, I started to have a little faith in my home town.  Known as THE republican strong hold and most conservative county in PA, I figured that there would be protesters or Republican party reps set up outside the theater (ala  The Passion ) to counter the views of film.  There was nothing.  As it turns out, they, with many of the baby boomers, were over at the republican headquarters standing in line to see W who's making his appearance here in York PA this Friday. I mean, if you're trying to convince the country that PA likes you, and you're Bush, you come to a town which is debating EVOLUTION right now! The party made it known that only Bush supporters would be allowed into the arena and that Ashcroft and the SS were doing thorough background checks.  Lucky for me I'm a card carrying Republican.  But, last time I checked, he was my president, too.  I didn't vote for him, but he represents me in the eyes of the rest of the world.  Shouldn't I have that right to see him... to listen to him?  Regardless, I don't have a chance to go heckle him on Friday due to work isses.  But, I at least would like to know I could if I wanted to.

         Okay, Okay... I know it's been over a week since I've posted, but I'm a girl with a life.  Anyway, this holiday weekend I experienced the Triple Crown of fire... Apartment Fire, Fireworks, and  urlLink  Fahrenheit 911  ... all with in 24 hours.  Well, the man, the cat, and myself ecsaped safely from our smoke filled apartment caused by an old range and smoldering oven mit.  The fireworks were bright and accompanied by too much traffic... and then there was F911.  So obviously, if you have read this blog you know my general political thoughts and that this was one of my most anticipated films of the year (after  Alexander ). So... what did I think?    The Film: Regardless of all the hype, I'm looking at this as a documentry, as film, and seperating it from it topic and target for a moment. To be direct, the structure was weak and voice over confusing.  urlLink Bowling for Columbine  and  urlLink Roger & Me  are both far superior documentries.  Fahrenhiet is a weak highly emotional essay. Like in a heated arguement, it's hard to get your point across cause words are just flying out. Good essays state a point, follow up that point with supporting details and facts, and again, reiterate the point.  Fahrenhiet was sometimes about W, sometimes about HW, sometimes about the BUSH's and the Saudi's, and sometime about the Iraq war.    So, add in a highly emotional, and for myself personal, topic to this delapidated structure and you have a film that deals with the alledged corporate coruption of the Bush administrations to the fall out of 911; this film was all over the map.  Moore was a prosecutor that wasn't sure what crime he was trying to proove.    The Politics:  Everyone finds it impossible to seperate this film from it's politics which shows the lack of logic our media and officials have.  Politically, if you criticize this film, you are criticizing our soldiers and the memory of 911.  You are also a Bush-lover.  If you applaud the film you're a liberal with a bleeding heart agenda seeking to profit from the death and distruction of many of our citizens.  Polarization, is not good folks... The world is simply a shade of gray... of good and bad intertwined.  Personally, I do not feel that Moore went far enough in taking Bush to task.  In fact, I think more should have been concentrated on the man in a coherant manner... hire the editors from  urlLink Criminal Intent .  They, in only 1 hour, can tell a complex story in a way that even my office cohorts to get it.  I only followed Moore's stream of consciousness plots because I've heard and read theses ideas, facts, and accusations better explained before.  Moore tried to stuff too much into 2 hours.     The Good: Believe it or not from what I've written so far, I did like the movie.  I actually felt a tear or two working up... granted I didn't bawl like a baby like in the train station scene from The Hours, but hey, I'm a tragic girl with tragic dreams.  The film was filled with brilliant bits, in fact the weakness is only in the merging of those bit that a better editor could have helped with.  The film was filled with the poingant - The Blackness over the sound design montage, the absurb - Ashcroft's musical moments, the heartbreaking - the mothers, Iraqi & American fearing for their son's lives, and the enraging - Bush doing NOTHING as the planes hit the towers. I know I left the theater angrier at Bush than when I walked in, but I wasn't sure quite why.  The most brilliant aspect of this film was Moore's use of music, from the opening riff of "Cocaine", to the music montages of Iraq, to the haunting background score.  This film was the best use of music... okay, well since Kill Bills... Anway, it was damn good!  Over all, the film is worth seeing.  Through the structural issues and jumbly plot a film comes through that is directly from the heart of one patriotic American that you can tell, still loves his country but hates his president... Can you blame him?

      Dear Loyal Bloger Readers: (Darren, Kevin, Ben, Jon, and whomever else randomly ends up here)  I'm temporarily taking a hiatus from the blog to start working on my book in my free time.  To those of you who I haven't talked to directly about the project, I'm writing a book on comparative religion including the similarities and differences of the major world religions.  It's always bothered me how much violence and persecution has always existed in the name of "god".  Between my friends and family and former roomates, I have been close to someone of every major world religion from the Abraham religions (Jews, Christians, Muslims) to eastern philosophical religions (Tao, Buddah, Hindu) to religions of nature (Wicca, Shinto, Shamanism).  It has always astounded me the ridiculous stereotypes that some people associate with each religion.  So in a probably futile attempt, I'm going to try and educate people one fallacy at a time.  And, if my friends and family have yet to kill anyone over religious differences (that even includes the fundementalists) why are so many people in world slaughtering each other, and why have they been since around 3000 b.c.?  From Gay marriage nationally, to the local debate over evolution, from deciding on the ceremony of my wedding, to thinking about what I want to teach my children about God, from the lady I work with who believes everyone in the office is condemned to hell besides her, to September 11th... something popped inside my head (it might even have been the voice of "God", or space aliens, or simple psychosis) and I decided to write the book. (It's not like I'm busy with my successful film career here in PA).  Anyway, I will probably post certain ideas or questions on the website from now on while writing and researching.  I might also throw a film review out there every now an then too. I'll try and post something once a week.  So, It was wonderful while it lasted... I hope it was as good for you as it was for me. :0P   Check back every now and then.

      Just like  urlLink VH1 , I'm quite fond of lists... maybe it's the aging female in me. Anyway, during my unending boredom at work this morning. I decided to make a list of the places I would like to travel to before I die.    Jerusalem (Israel, Middle East)   Stonehenge, Dover Castle, & the British Isles (Europe)   Serengeti National Park (Tanzania, Africa)   The Great Buddha &amp; Todaiji (Japan, Far East)   Rome & Florence (Italy, Europe/ Mediterranean)   The Giza Plateau (Egypt, Middle East)   Angkor Watt (Cambodia, Central Asia)   The Louvre &amp; Versailles (France, Europe)   Bhutan (Central Asia)   The Parthenon (Greece, Europe/ Mediterranean)   Petra (Jordan, Middle East)   Bran Castle (Romania, Eastern Europe)   Madagascar   Monteverde Cloud Forest (Costa Rica, Central America)   The Great Barrier Reef &amp; Outback (Australia)   Istanbul (Turkey, Eastern Europe/Middle East)   Galapagos Islands, (Ecuador, South America)   Victoria Falls (South Africa)   Montana   Tahiti, Bora Bora (French Polynesia)

      [SPOILERS] One of the 2 "twists" of  The Village  is the knowledge Ivy Walker (Howard) learns regarding "those we do not speak of." In fact they do not exist. As her father says, "it is a farce." The Elders of the village use bones, skins, and other natural materials to fashion boogeymen suits. Dressing up as the horrible creatures reinforces the myth of evil that lives in Covington Woods. The woods completely encircles the village. By using this fear through legend and eye witness reports, the elders ensure that no one will ever go exploring beyond the borders of the settlement. In turn, when those lacking fear have been so daring as to proceed beyond the boundaries, the boogeymen reek havoc (slaughtering the live stock), as retribution and reinforce the notion of fear.  In a tactic normally used by religion and often politico-religious positions, fear is used to acquire power and control of children, subjects, citizens, and worshipers. This tactic is completely antithetical to a "Free" society such as the one we have touted here in the United States (supposed separated from religion as well). Enter, the Texas Prince.    "Since it is difficult to join them together, it is safer to be feared than to be loved when one of the two must be lacking,"   Niccolo Machiavelli,  The Prince  (1532)

       Okay, first, I will try today to make a simple sweet and typical review of this film. Because, ocne you see The Village you'll understand it is simply not just a film (or maybe it will be just a film, in that case you will most likely hate it.) I would also like to preface this review by stating I'm am not, or I wasn't, the biggest Shyamalan fan out there. I liked The Sixth Sense, hated Unbreakable, and enjoyed signs. I always felt that his own ego detrimentally effected his art... and he reminded me of all the arrogant self important boys I went to college with... and I mean that in a bad way. Speaking of Tisch, If only I could watch this film with Richard "Tippi as a Bird" Allen. What I see most likely only scratches the surface of what Professor Allen could bring to light.
