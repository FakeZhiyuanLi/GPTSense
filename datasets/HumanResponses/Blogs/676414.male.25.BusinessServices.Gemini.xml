      Welcome To The Blogger!  I have created a blogger for no good reason... everybody else has em'. I have seen a lot of articles about them and thought I would create one of my own. Here I will discuss technology, politics, and art. Hope to see you soon!

      Well, I got most of my new site up, even though I have commited myself to a lot of maintenance along the way. Still, I enjoy working on this site and also getting back into writing again. The biggest plus was moving my journal entries over to eBook format and posting them on the literature section of the site. I really do enjoy looking back at how humanist and idealist I was back then. You know it often occurs to me that if we could go forward 5 years from any point in time... we'd be more disappointed than happy. I don't think we can ever align our wills with fate. Or I could just be sentimential

      I have been busy upgrading my website because:  1) It needs it 2) I wanted to give it more personal content (i.e. Blogger integration)  I really hope I can wrap the blog around my site template. However, I am uncertain if I can do that right now. I have just finished up the career section of the site and am waiting to begin work on the literature section. I am looking to  have the site complete by Wends. although that is a very hard goal to reach.

       I wrote an article in the Think Tank about the current consumer confidence problems Wall Street is just now getting a feel for. I was talking about the impending doom of those laid off after September 11th running out of their emergency extention benefits back in April. Still, it seems this downtick in Consumer Confidence we saw today took Wall Street by surprise yet again. Remember that even though those unemployed and drawing benefits are small, their impending defaults and word of mouth despair  is enough to bring down the last remaining strength of the American economy.  urlLink You can read the article here .

      I have gotten a bunch of phone calls today about jobs. I am very excited about this since I haven't heard anything for a good week or two. I also got information about a job at an incubator in Covington, KY. I would love to work for an incubator like in the 1990's, especially one so close. Wish me luck on getting an interview at this place.

      Hello All  I just  urlLink read  something really sad:  Le service de paiement �lectronique par e-mail MinutePay.fr est ferm� depuis plusieurs jours. Ouvert en septembre 2001, MinutePay propose un syst�me de paiement s�curis� par courrier �lectronique entre particuliers et en temps r�el, le compte �tant aliment� par l'envoi de ch�que par voie postale, par virement bancaire ou paiement par carte de cr�dit.  La soci�t� Minutepay, filiale de la holding n�erlandaise MinutePay BV (principalement d�tenue par le fonds de capital-risque Chrysalead) a suspendu son activit� dans l'attente d'un nouvel  apport de fonds qui semble difficile � trouver .  Son partenaire Banque Directe envisage de mettre en place une proc�dure de remboursement, qui consisterait � transf�rer �lectroniquement les sommes vers�es vers les comptes bancaires des clients. Selon le porte-parole de Banque Directe, entre "20 000 et 40 000 comptes" seraient concern�s.   I can't believe that this would happen considering that Minutepay could have been the PayPal of the Euro controlled european countries! I mean, who wouldn't fund this thing since it has a growth market of the whole of europe and a word-of-mouth and operational advantage over paypal which has yet to expand to the Euro countries. What's worse, now I have to remove all the links to minutepay on my website :-) I loved working in Paris building this thing's backend, and I know that France Telecom had problems bringing live a site with this much traffic but still... it was a great idea.  Either way, I do know that all the talented people that I know @ Minutepay will fiind good jobs. If any of you read this drop me a line, and remember Douna: "seulement les personnes laides obtiennent assises en haut" ;-)

      Good morning!  Well today I am going to work on my kidventus.com website again, and fix a lot of things that are wrong with my personal section, if anything because I didn't work on it over the weekend. I am also working on the Kindred website for Brad and Rillie who is yelling at me all the way from Scotland. Which reminds me, what happened to my friend in Britian? He hasn't logged on in a long time, I wonder if he is on "holiday".   Another thing I am looking forward too today is some call back from Corning about a job I applied for. The technical industry in Cincinnati sucks really bad right now, especially for someone who has worked in Paris building an e-commerce site for the Euro and stuff. All I see are lower level production support jobs. Of course, I don't want to move to Seattle or something, so I am hoping to take a job at Corning for a little while cutting lenses so that I can keep my car and stuff. Tough times. Besides after I get in I could shake up the production line by using my Six Sigma on them ;-)  Anyway, wish me luck and hope I get a call!

      Good Morning   Today it's all about Kindred. What is Kindred? I have no damn clue. As far as I can tell it's a bunch of nerds that get together to play some god aweful text based game that should have went out in 1990 with TradeWars. Still... as it is with all networks.. all you need is two, and this network has hundreds.. I think. So Brad and his brother are hooked on this because they didn't have many friends growing up and they talk to all these people around the world and they fight monsters and stuff.... usually at the same time I'm drinking tea and reading the Economist. Anyway they are organized into teams, and Brad and Brian (Brad's identical twin brother) are in the team... oops, sorry... "clan" called Kindred. This goes international by way of the leader of the clan, Rillrae, who resides in Scotland and is a manic perfectionist with obsessive compulsive disorder. Turns out she wants to make a website for Clan Kindred... Brad says he'll do it... asks me to help.... admits he has no idea how to build a site..... looks at kidventus.com.. blinks... asks me to do it all.. and then promptly takes off to holiday with his family in California a week before the site should be live.. leaving me with the obsessive compulsive Scotish girl who has 800 x 600 resolution and an eye for detail stressed if it's gonna be done on time and lookin' for someone to Instant Message about it... often.  Today it's all about Kindred. I have to get this site up and done before the week is up and with no collaborators but the before mentioned manic in Scotland. Luckly since the economy sucks wind like a smoker in a marathon I have the freetime. So I have a whole day full of taking apart photoshop files.... extracting thier layers.. doing the "cut / paste / resizie / cut / paste / resize / save / undo / save" loop and then putting them in a webpage for a girl who complains about 1 mm differences between tables... not that anyone knows how pissy tables in websites can be but those who use them.   It's too bad I'm not a web designer, then I could at least add this to my resume, although then I would become just as insane about perfection as manic girl.

      Well today I am up and as annoyed as ever at the job market in Cincinnati. I heard from a recruiter that the Atena job went to an old consultant, and I heard from another recruiter that if I didn't hear anything back from 5/3rd by yesterday he would assume they are not interested. So the optimism I wrote about on 6/13 is gone. I'm back at square one like the stock market. Either way I'm ok with it since I really would rather not go into a position other people are vacating right now. Think about it... there is no growth in businesses, so any new positions are from people abandoning theirs taking their chance on this sucky market instead of still working at the company. That has to give you pause.   I also am sick at what a small city Cincinnati is. I was at Newport On The Levy a few weeks back at night looking out on the river and the Cincy skyline and thinking how I can't drive down a Cincinnati street around 12:00pm lunch hour without seeing at least four people I use to work with. I remarked about it to Brad who was there sitting on the iron fence to my right. I don't think he believed me since he's still in college.. but he'll find out.   Oh, and on the topic of this impending doom of unemployment benefits running out which I wrote  urlLink  about in an article here, looks like the media is finally catching on. I imagine the fact that the citizens of New York are holding a 24 protest at the mayor's office is probably waking a few people up. I couldn't find a link to the protest but it was on NPR's morning edition today sometime.

      Right after the World Cup game against Mexico I wrote a very long Blog about how to improve viewership of the World Cup in America. It was mostly whimsical, but I thought I made some good points. Well after about 30 minutes of writing I click "Post and Publish" on Blogger.com and boom... 505 screens everywhere. No problem I thought... just push the back button. Nope, more 505 screens! I must have lost my servlet session or whatever the hell pyra is... all I know is blogger.com ruined my day. I wrote another version and posted it as an article but it just seems korny now. Or I could just be tired from being up at 2 am to watch the World Cup game. Oh, and we won.. it was a shut-out, first time we've gotten this far since 1930. I was excited at 4am, now I'm kinda in a daze.   Also I posted a follow up on the jobs I talked about on the 13th which have fallen silent after the initial contact as they usually do. I wish I saw some light at the end of the tunnel. Remember to read the Think Tank and tell me what you think!

      Tonight Brad returns home from SanFran with tons of souviners in tow. He is coming in with his family from St. Louis. Tyler has quit his job at Corning Percision Lens along side his Dad and my mother learned that one of her friends from work died in a car crash today, and people made a make-shift memorial by displaying the picture of her and her husband she had on her desk in a prominent position. So goes the world forward.....  Shocking that I remain in it. I think it dawns on everyone eventually that even with everything they see going on in the world and with their friends and family they are still here, still alive and in survivors guilt brought on by MSNBC. What a task to even live now a days, with constant pursuit by cancer, heart disease, alzheimers, obesity, car wrecks, and ofcourse... strokes. Now comes the reports that fried foods cause cancer, and the World Health Organization having emergency meetings to discuss the issue. In 1955 when they first released the fact that smoking causes lung cancer, the Surgeon General had the reporters go into the auditorum and then they bolted the doors shut so no one could walk out after hearing the news without first watching the evidence. I suspect the same with fried foods. I suspect the same thing with cellphones, negative thoughts, and wireless Wi-Fi. I can't imagine this thing on my desk can shoot out 2.5 Ghz worth of 10 MB / sec data without giving me a sunburn on my right side or making my teeth fillings able to login to Yahoo! without my knowledge. I joke about the risk of life only to ensure that it dosen't sink in too deep. The blinders we wear prevents us, like animals, from seeing our own demise. We posses knowledge of it, of course, but then we chose to purge it and bury it because life simply requires us to live forever and even though we don't it shouldn't interfere with our business or pleasure. Society requires routine, routine suggest wastefullness, and wastefullness is more tolerable when we have a lot to waste. Sudden death of a loved causes great grief, when it just a work friend or aquantence we feel something else. Because it relates to death, of which we wish to have no part, we dismiss it as well, and allow only sadness to hammer into us.  But what we don't allow ourselves to feel is the waste. The waste of a life. Media helps us not think about it with it's quick coverage. The above mentioned incident was reported thusly at  urlLink WLWT.com : " A passenger in Reynolds' car, Kimberly Reynolds, 33, was pulled from the car and taken to University Hospital, where she later died, WLWT reported. Anthony Reynolds was treated at University Hospital for minor injuries and released. A child who was riding in Reynolds' car, Christopher Starks, 11, was treated for minor injuries at Children's Hospital and released, WLWT reported.  "   Quick wasn't it? It even mentioned Kimberly Reynolds, 33, as a "passenger in Reynold's car".... so sterile.... even though they were both plainly married as they both have the same last name! However this is nothing more than something to re-inforce our blinders to dealth and wastefullness. Let me tell you what really happened:  Kim was a fun woman who had many friends. She worked in "files" filing away at a government job and having to talk to my mother often. She sat right behind my mother's best friend, who would talk with her often. She had an 11 year old son and a husband, the above mentioned driver who had also just recently lost his father. That day they were going to pick Kim up from work because they were going to classes on how to buy a house, and they wanted to be prepared. She usually took the bus from work, but this time her husband went to pick her up to make it to class. My mother told her goodnight as she made her rounds before going outside.   If someone would read her life, the fact that she filed all day and was working on buying a house for her family would certainly give another woman, 33, pause. If we heard the details of everyone's life so laid out for our understanding, "one day she was here and now she's gone", how would we change? We get an ear full of whoever the media chooses to focus on, one person usually, missing or dead.... and it gets drilled into us until we don't want to see anymore. But what about a steady stream of stories, from normal middle class people, dying, and the tragic fallout. The lives changed. Maybe we can't capture that, maybe we can only experience it ourselves.   My mother is experiencing that now. Again, not losing a mother or a son, but just an aquantance, just "never see her again", just "ended suddenly"... no grief to get in the way of the fact of death, just death, individual and alone... like ours will be to others who do not love us. We will be passed by, thought about, displayed, and then gone. You can't be upset, they have to forget about you, you have to fade into memory and be remanded into a "remember you know who" at parties years from now. They can't be bothered by contemplation, they are living forever... it was just unfortunate that you didn't.... that's all. You were pulled from the car and taken to University Hospital, where you later died, and WLWT reported it.

      Hello all     I've been busy interviewing, so sorry about the long time in writing. I have also been updating my site for the July edition, which even though it is indeed July already updates gradually as I find time to write the articles and read my magazines. I just finished  urlLink this week's Economist  and I'm beginning to get angry at how it is focusing so much on the United State's economy these last few issues. One of the main reasons I like the Economist is because of it's in-depth reporting on other cultures and economies. I admired all the Economist advertisements I saw when I was living in Paris. It reminded me of it's truely global reach and how out of touch the United States public is for not reading it more often. Of course Brazil melting down bothers me some, but I think it will pull through fine.     Another thing that has me steamed is this  urlLink ICC  (International Criminal Court).  The more I read about it, the more I understand America's concerns. Although long time readers will be shocked at me saying this, I did have the initial knee jerk reaction of calling it another Bushism. At the same time however it is absurd that anyone would prosecute the United States for warcrimes and the idea that  urlLink we are preventing peace keeping missions  because of our desire for special treatment is horrible.     However I am not certain if I disagree with it  urlLink on the same grounds  George W does. I would like to think that his objections are well thought out and not simply a knee jerk reaction of his own in regards to the idea of a World Court infringing on America's sovereign rights. We all know conservatives are very nervous about the fact they exist on the same planet as everyone else, and even though that fact might be tolerable the idea that we might have to be subject to the rest of the world makes them outright furious. Conservatives are old men who are afraid of human nature and the world, obviously, but unfortunately they are also smart.      Anyone with schooling in world history knows that when you go to unite a fractionous body of states or people you need to establish one thing before all else... a "supreme" court. The Supreme Court of the United States was the main body that pulled the states together into a nation. Whenever interstate battles would erupt over shipping rights, travel rights, or anything else it was the Supreme Court that decided the verdict. By making everyone subject to one court interpreting the law, they eventually became more united by having one law to rule all the states in the federation. The same thing is occuring in the Europrean Union, where one "supreme" court has been setup to negotiate and decide cases resulting from now intercountry disputes on trade, fishing rights of all things, and farming. This court was one of the first bodies established in the "One Europe" experiment.      So it goes that now the world has set out to make one and has indeed made one (they got to work July 1st). Of course the conservatives knowing the above argument (because they are smart) say that it is a dangerous threat to our sovereign rights, much like the big New York complained about the smaller states having judgements go their way in the late 1700's I imagine. However it is pitiful to use this excuse, because this court is not about interpreting international law (since such a task would be impossible given the state of internation law today). They are simply concerned with war crimes. This is mostly a permanent war crimes tribunal, operating out of the very aptly named "Hague". It is very sad and unfortunate that the Treaty of Rome setting up the criminal court decided to call it the "International Criminal Court" because that court part makes all the big ones, Russia and China included, nervous.       Why I object, which would be the smarter reason the conservatives should object, is that no one knows what a war crime is. Much like the cliche when describing pornography, the people in the Hague must "know it when they see it". Of course this leaves much to be desired. For instance it is very possible that the recent accidental attack on civilians in Afghanistan could be considered a war crime. You might think not.. but imagine if Serbia had done it during Slobodan Milosevic's reign. No doubt it would be added to the list against him at least. It is in no one's best interest to submit themselves to a court who has no law to enforce, and no real group of people or states on which to show influence. It is simply and sadly an entity created so that those involved in it could feel they've moved humanity forward. It is really something to get a puffed chest about.... a first step to world government, a first step to making the people of the world subject to the world.        Nothing can happen during this Bush administration that would delight the international community, Bush has proven that. I start every international phone and email conversation I have with the words "I apologize for George". They laugh, but know it's necessary. That being said, this is really an issue that the world will take back up in 2004 or 2008. The Hague will go on, America will kick at it with every turn, and things will go back to normal because no one will poke a stick at the giant. Still, I do hope that as the Hague progresses through the years it sets precidents much like the Supreme Court did during the birth of this nation.. and in doing so makes it easier for the big but paranoid powers (Russia, China, United States) to join and participate. I also hope that after the Bush presidency, we will explain to the American people what the ICC actually is, and what it really is meant to do. The most important thing to explain to the American people is the hope for humanity that made the world dream it up.         As for a court to judge international law... oh gesh, how long for before the libertarians bring up the "Black Apache" conspiracies again? Not before we go to Mars people, not before we go to Mars.

      We've seen  urlLink smart cards come , and we've seen them go just as quickly. The only one that seems to stick around is the  urlLink American Express Blue  card. It has a built in chip that so far is vestigial but is touted as having &quot;ever evolving capabilities&quot;. Yeah right. Still it appears that Britain is moving forward with a plan to create a national identity card which will contain much of the same information the American Express Blue card promises to carry in the future. According to the  urlLink  BBC , the aptly named &quot;entitlement cards&quot; would carry benefits like the following already proposed:                      &nbsp; urlLink Life Long Education Benefit Information  for people to get at least 6 years of education throughout their lifetime.             Protect against identity theft, a rising crime in Britain and the rest of the world             Allow for tracking of Welfare and NHS payments.              Store finger print and other identifiable data for banks and others to use             Act as a driver's license if that right was programmed into your identity card                     As in America the idea of an identity card is getting a lot of  urlLink protest and resistance  in Britain, Despite the fact that our Social Security numbers here in the states are used to identify us to such an extreme it would be productive to tattoo the number in barcode form on our wrist, America clings to the illusion of anonymity as part of the American dream. Normally I agree with efforts to resist tagging us like cattle in a herd. Still, in reading about this idea I couldn't get away from how incredible the possibilities were.           The issue which sticks out in my mind is that this card is not an ID card per se', but instead an  information aggregator . According  urlLink to the plans , you would have what would most likely be flash storage space on a  urlLink Java enabled chip  with password security. When you get this card it would have some rights &quot;pre-installed&quot; such as the before mentioned education in Scotland for six years. Then, you would go around and add stuff to it, for instance your bank information or your driver's license information. All of this would be not in large databases that could talk to each other and make decisions about you without your consent and send you junk mail, but in a little card where the &quot;primary key&quot; in RDBS terms is you.... or your card. Your bank only knows that you have a driver's license if they know what's on your card, The GAP would only know your preferences at The Limited because of your card. They could not, as they do in the states, simply figure out by your social security number on loan applications, bank accounts, education registration, and credit card applications where you shop and how much credit you're currently looking for.          This would be just short of utopia for the individual. Imagine instead of submitting your signature and social security number for some behind the scenes background check you could just swipe your card, give your finger print approval, and go over the information that is retrieved as the employer sees it. The First Bank of Main St. wouldn't be able to offer to take your mortgage away from Big Mortgage Co. by using your social security number on your bank application unless you released that information to the bank when you first swiped your card. Applying for Unemployment, Social Security, or Welfare would be as easy as swiping your card and approving information be delivered to the government. Because all the jobs you had wrote information to your card when you took the job and approved information released for your W-2, you wouldn't have to spend the day filling out forms and remembering obscure phone numbers from managers five years ago.          Of course there's one problem with this scenario: getting all the infrastructure built. Although many might read this and think it's impossible, think about this: what is the one common denominator in every information gathering / retrieving / applying / approving task you do? It's your signature. Everything requires your John Hancock, all the way down to buying a Coke with your Debit Card. The best place to start would be determining all the points in government processes in which you sign. From that point you could simply build a database of stuff you want gathered, and then bring them all together to determine standards. Then it would  be the matter of using code to parse the XML data in your card and gather that information, along with the signature stored in your card (i.e. your finger print) into one form. It wouldn't matter how different companies store this information on your card since it's XML, as long as the tags are standardized to a schema you'll always be guaranteed that the data written is reusable by any government or business agency you allow access to it.  If you think about it, your Debit card already does a lot of what Britain is proposing. Not only does it check Visa databases but also instantly credits and debits your checking account at any number of banks and serves as an ATM card on the side. Applying terminals and network infrastructure should be easy if we re-use these systems but gathering information from our own cards instead of calling a Visa or bank database.          It might be easy to argue only business is agile enough to build this infrastructure, and government is handicapped by the public from having the resources to build such an infrastructure in the United States (which is what the constitution intended). Britain may have a better chance. However this is also a way in which we will lose even more control. The government did not start using social security to identify people until businesses started using the unique number to record employment and financial data in their databases. If we sit back and allow businesses to build this second more powerful system we will get the government tying into it, but only after our ID card has the GAP logo printed on it and sending us ads on our mobile phones.

      Good Morning!  Today I am waiting for a call back from Fidelity about a possible position within their consulting firm. Although I have directed them to this site for code samples, I find no one in the employment world takes the time to look at my career tab. I am still happy I created it just in case someone might find it useful, and I like the interactive resume I created. I thought about doing a resume in Flash as well but figured that would just be annoying.   Speaking of job hunting gimmicks, it's amazing how unemployment can eat at you.  urlLink As you can tell from this site , I'm a perfectionist that can't leave anything alone even if it looks half way decent. Same thing holds true for  urlLink my resume  I found out. If I submit 20 resumes and no one responds, I think... " I wonder why? Maybe it's too long ". So I shorten it by a page and redeploy it everywhere. Then after two weeks I think " maybe it's because I bounced around so much the last few years.. I mean who would turn down working in Paris? But still... ." so then I write a header that explains why I bounced around so much. Still nothing, so I think... " maybe I cut too much out... maybe I haven't listed my skills correctly " and I edit my resume again. Still nothing. Then the worst happens, I find out a few of my friends got jobs already and I'm still out of work. This creates even more panic... something obviously IS wrong with me or my resume. I study it.... maybe I used the word "I" too much to describe my accomplishments. I replace I with "our team"... even when there wasn't a team.... that should nail it.   Two more weeks.... and 10 more resume variations. " Maybe I misspelled a word.. maybe they think I'm too technical... I managed people too.... but I don't say that... well what's the focus of the resume? " Then a worse thought goes across my mind... how many times have the same consulting firms read my different resumes? Maybe they think I'm making all this up since I change it so much?  It's around this time I begin feeling like a male Cathy comic.   ( Sidebar:  For a real unemployement cartoon  urlLink go here . The guy even got on the  urlLink Today show ... too bad the  urlLink  IRS found out about his tip jar .)  The truth is there are consulting firms out there that sprung up during the dot com 90's and are now seriously hurting. They have nothing to do but sit around and call the lastest resumes on Monter.com. They call, talk to you, ask about your background, and then hang up. They submit your resume to tons of companies, the same one's you applied to personally as well.   Real companies   usually just dump resumes that were submitted by a consulting firm  AND  personally. I know for a fact  urlLink Kroger  and  urlLink US Bank  do this. The fact that many consulting firms don't tell you who they are submitting you to makes matters worse. At the same time many businesses are nervous about hiring full time employees so they use consultants, which is a potential opportunity for me.   There is no constructive way you can manage who delivers what resume to whom... consulting firms want money and use resumes as the drill bit to go digging in companies for oil.     Considering this, I think I've made a mistake talking to everyone that's called in my job hunt. For instance I found out that one of the companies I was talking with.. Trasys... was not actually talking to companies directly but to other consulting firms! I got a call from her setting up a phone interview for a 5/3rd position not at 5/3rd, but with another consulting firm that has 5/3rd as the client. So.. now my salary is squashed by:  1. 5/3rd paying this consulting firm 2. Which takes a cut of my money for themselves   3. Which is paying Trasys either monthly or a finders fee which takes a cut of my money 4. Which gives me what's left.   I don't think so... I let that phone interview go. Like the song goes "One sun to many, to many able fires". So, I am really working on this Fidelity thing, and just letting my resume go.. I'm tired trying to psycho-analyze HR departments or chop shop consulting firms.   A more substantial blog like the one below about the ICC is coming soon, I promise :-)

      Hello all     I know that it has been a while since I have written anything on this blog, and the archive no matter how much I wish it will bear this out. The reason is simple: I've been busy running in circles, or more like playing chutes and ladders and ending up in the same place every time. I had a couple of interviews with Fidelity, and it netted little more than a good airing out of my business suit. I guess I will talk about that first.     I often have dreams where I go back in time to an interview that didn't work out, or to a boss of a job I end up quitting and knowing the history and that I end up in a safe place, let them have it instead of in the real life past when all I did was play it safe. These interviews will be dreamed about. I was up for two positions (three before scheduling conflicts caused one to be filled before I was allowed to interview). In the first interview the people I was interviewing with were late, but after a call to my contact at Fidelity Human Resources they came to the door. They were hostile, to put it bluntly. Not only was I asked simple Java questions a child could answer "What is a class' access modifier when it's not explicitly stated?", I was attacked about how I could both program and manage the technical aspects of the project at General Electric.       Obviously the person didn't understand what it is like at GE, or else he would understand that you work ten hour days and often stay the night to get things done, but he wouldn't believe it, asking me three times the same "percentage" question over and over again...   "How much was management, and how much as coding?"  "I would say 40% management and 60% programming"  "Portals are a big deal, there's no way"  "It was all integrated, we build modules to plug in, and the portal was already there"  "Besides code reviews.... what was the percentage?"  "Still 40% management / 60%  programming.�  �That�s hard to believe�     Then he frowned... biofeedback during an interview is as professional as coming to work in your underwear, which he didn't seem beyond doing.      I know many people have had to answer these questions, and a word to the clueless interviewers: You can't tell the difference! It's 100% / 100%. Everyone in that position knows the project deliverables and the code that plugs into what, you don't have to be a superman to read a UML diagram and figure out what�s next. Also, what is the separation between code reviews and writing code? It�s definitely the same part of the brain, using the same knowledge. They asked me to subtract X from X and were shocked when I came up with X again!      It was at this point that I felt like the Angry Coder, and knew that this interview was a washout. I even tried to turn the conversation to the good stuff, J2EE, XML. I talked about how I wrote parsing crap using JAXP, how I wrote a regular expression matching program to parse HL7 medical formats.   NOTE: Before 1.4 obviously.... which now has Perl like REGEXP matching.  Blah! Perl relied too much on "magic"... I would like to see a better REGEXP implementation, but there probably isn't one. Truth is this Java REGEXP thing might just put a nail in Python's coffin, which is nothing more than OO Perl.   No matter what I brought up, I they were lost..... Another question, "How do you catch exceptions in Java?" Good grief! Then started the connection URL string question....   "What is the URL to connect to an Oracle 8 database?"   Answer: LOOK IT UP!   Like programmers can actively state the platform dependent nonsense they write once and keep in a params class for platform independence. If you even have to write connection strings enough to remember them... you�re not programming right! I did point out the fact that if you are using a J2EE implementation it's all managed inside a container since that is much better than using bean managed persistence because you can move it between platforms.... "Explain what a container is" was their next question. This is the time when a techie knows he's teaching and not answering. (Sigh).     To make it worse, my iPaq pen fell out of my computer while I was outside calling the Fidelity HR person. So I was out a job and an iPaq pen, and given their performance I was more worried about the pen.   Of course there was interview two still! The second interview is always better!      Except this time. I am a Java programmer and a sometime technical project manager (read: I can explain geeky stuff to business people who pay for it). Why I was scheduled to talk to a Microsoft C++ programmer I have no clue. We basically talked about Paris.... and that was it. There were no questions, none could really be asked, and we parted ways.       Two weeks later I heard both were looking for other candidates.... big surprise! At least this was better than the first time I had a run in with Fidelity, when they left me outside waiting for an hour because the interview wasn't scheduled and the HR person and the manger were out. At least I got four solid interviews this time.... which was fun, if eventually disappointing.        And then there was silence..... no calls, no responses to postings, GDP at 1.6 % and falling.... looks like tech workers fell down the chute to October again after climbing the ladder in April - June. So be it.... life is nothing but chutes and ladders, as I learned during my liberal arts education.        Now for other stuff:        Since we're back in the decline of jobs, I have found myself actually going out and doing things instead of staying inside thinking that I should be actively looking for a job 24 hours a day to appear "non-bum" like. Last week Brad and I drove up to Columbus to see DC United play the Columbus Crew. It was a good game... and nice to go to a stadium NOT used for other sports (I hate thinking of player's positions in regard to yard lines). I bought a soccer ball and a foamy finger.... at this point being a soccer fan is like eating caviar, you flaunt it cause no one gets it.      I use to live in Columbus, OH six years ago when I went to Ohio State and lived in a frat house on 14th St. Unfortunately Columbus has went very much down hill since then... even my favorite coffee shop where all my memories reside, Basso Bean, closed and a Deli is quickly coming to take it's place. There was nothing to do downtown, so we went to the mall. I drove to OSU before the game... it was dead because it was summer... but the campus hasn't expanded that much... and slums still exist in the nether regions of High St. between downtown and OSU. In comparison, University of Cincinnati looks like an active post-modern art-deco science project gone haywire... with new odd shaped buildings in blue and green appearing everywhere every few months... even the navigation signs have metal blue trees on top of them.... why no one knows.... it's the essence of post-modern.. "weird for weird's sake".      That's the update so far, I'm now updating the site for August.... and I'm going to write about the directionless void of technology in August... remember when you knew where Java and Microsoft were going? Now Microsoft is doing Mobile Phones and Java has been stuck in the server farm being the bitch of IBM.... but adoption of .Net is slow and unproven.... what do we learn? I'll also take you back to 1996 with CNET webpages to show you how full of direction we were then.... which will highlight how we're so lost now.     Stay tuned!

      OK, I know this is my third post in ten minutes, but I just had to shout out about the fact that Bob Barr is now gone from the world!  ATLANTA Rep. Bob Barr loses to fellow GOP Rep. John Linder in Georgia's new 7th District. - Yahoo! News  Yippie! It is actually quite hillarious because this really makes it easier for the democrat to win Atlanta.  ATLANTA Rep. Cynthia McKinney loses Democratic primary to former state judge Denise Majette. - Yahoo! News  Cynthia McKinney is actually quite insane.. her stances on certain Muslium issues was just odd. She just seemed kind of the conspiracy  theorist in everything including September 11th. I swore I'd never write that date on this site... it's just so hyped and over-used and over-analysed it hurts to hear it anymore...

      Oh, something else I forgot to add. I got a comment about not having accessability built in to my site. I admit I am the worst web designer of all time because I use multiple tables to structure content. Tables are NOT meant to be used for anything but data... if you want to structure you should use style sheets instead. I promised in the next redesign I would do this but instead I just removed a lot of the custom image files and instead used tables even more so to quickly generate cells with titles to the articles I write. So... chances are my site isn't going be able to be read through a verbal text reader. Of course I could just write the whole thing in XHTML and then write a downloadable voice reader that would parse the XML tags using the .Net Beta of the Speech Engine.. but I ain't gonna :-) I'm so bad I even used style sheets in the Think Tank but embedded them into the individual HTML. I think I will parse that out into another file.   Jennifer: Would you run Netscape and Opera test on this thing because I'm to lazy to download them!

      Well I got most of my completely redone and much slimmer site done. However I made a major mistake! Anyone that runs a website knows that you play around with images and pages all the time and if you want to save it to see how it deploys and then ax it, you get an accumulation of images and files that don't link to anything and just clutter up your space. So I took to cleaning all these out with my new slimmer design and went into my Earthlink folder over the net to delete the old site and then upload the new one.   I blaim this on Windows XP actually, which groups all your Network Places together.. and on my coffee for not being strong enough to keep my brain functioning.. but somehow I managed to click on my local network website and began deleting all I could see in preparation to upload the brand new site I was deleting. I'm sure if someone wanted to come up with a recursion algorithm for this loop it would be impressive, but either way I caught what I was doing after having successfully deleted the Think Tank. Because I was deleting these files through my network interface to my site from Network Neighborhood... that's right.. no recycle bin! So, turns out I had visited a lot of the new Think Tank layout in my browser, so I painfully went through my Temporary Internet Files and grabbed the html and images out of the folder and recreated the directory structure. Some articles are gone forever in the Technology section. I'm not that hurt.  So far today I've been slurping down hot tea and working on my website. I remember having a lot to do on my TODO list and I guess now is the time to start on them.

      Hello again  Yes, the site is being changed and half of it's up and half of it isn't... I accidentally deployed and rewrote the old site... ick!  I hope I am getting better at writing in this thing, but that is the point of this article.  Today after exercising I was upstairs laying in my... well it's an empty room with nothing in it because I have more rooms than stuff, but I'll call it my den. What is in this room is a small couch and a bookcase where I store old books that I bought which at the time were irresistible and still intrigue me when I read their titles but will never read. In the midst of them was my old Franklin Day planner archives. In this stylish brown binder were my work and personal notes from 1996, 1997, 1998, & 1999. Feeling an odd sense of curiosity I grabbed it off the shelf and went downstairs. I opened them with the only intention of verifying that the dates I put on my resume were indeed correct since I am job hunting.  What I was unprepared for was the current of emotions that would pour over me when I opened up the book to the beginning year of 1996 when I was working at Convergys (which means I was working in Columbus in 1995, not 1996... oops). In front of me were scribbles of old financial calculations with embarrassingly small numbers, phone numbers and lunch dates of friends long gone and forgotten, and even a note that I had purchased a $600.00 CD at Huntington Banks which I don't remember doing but have now definitely made a note of looking into. I noticed the change in penmanship (I was only 18 in 1996) from one year to the next. The loops would get tighter, the strokes more sure as I gradually became use to the jobs I was doing. In the margins were old notes about things that friends had said to me in passing, locations of prized possessions in a house I no longer live in, and poems that I would write secretly at the bottom when there was space at the end of the day. The names of old business acquaintances sparked my memory; some with the agony of talking to them on the phone, others with the curiosity of what was happening to them now.   The person who wrote these entries are not me. They were from a boy over his head in a world he despised but secretly lusted after. Someone who was much more sure of himself, who believed he had achieved what others only hoped at... that while the people he left at his high school were in Calculus 101 in college he was traveling around the country on business trips with his very own American Express Corporate card with his name on it, and even his middle initial.. standing out proud in raised plastic across the green surface... a name that was going somewhere.. a name that shouldn't have been there for years but was.. by mere determination alone. This is the boy that while he worked at the tender age of 18 was stuck doing Saturday work.. but would sneak into the fancy corner pub with his badge to prove to anyone questioning it that he was much older than he looked, and for added effect he would buy a Financial Times newspaper and pretend to read it while he was at the bar. Whenever the bartender would spy him to gauge the need for another drink, this boy would grab the pink newspaper and pretend he was engrossed in the Saudi stock market. When the bartender would ask if he wanted another,  he  would barely lookup as if being intruded upon.. give a look as if it could go either way.. and then reluctantly agree to another.    All these memories flooded back to me as I flipped the pages, running my hands over the ink imagining a much younger hand writing the words, with hurried motions, waiting for the next fire to put out, the next meeting he could be a part of, the next dinner he could run to. How different from the man I am now, barely a man, so many months out of work, questioning his place in the world and his fitness to participate in it. I bring this up because I no longer use a Franklin Day planner. In late 1999 I adopted a Palm computer and decided that I should use that to write down my life. Needless to say that with the frequent changes in computers and palm computers most of those entries are gone. In fact, I find it tedious and boring to enter dates into Outlook or my palm computer. It seems like a chore.. even when scheduling something exciting like a soccer game or a dinner with friends. I no longer have to write down my contacts, no longer have to copy over every task to the next day's page. However, looking at these pages it occurred to me that I indeed enjoyed doing that. I enjoyed writing with care every friend I had... thinking of them as I formed the perfect T or the perfect B in their name... sometimes a joke they once said would occur to me, or I would suddenly get the urge to call them after a long absence. When I would write and categorize my tasks, they become more urgent in mind.. a daily reminder.. not an eye sore that my often red task list on my computer has become. More importantly, every day I would un-intentionally write my auto-biography.. my true journal and keepsake. It was not some puffed up grandiose diary entry that leans to heavily on sentimentality and introspection, but just simply a daily page of what I was tasked with, what my dreams were, was so urgent then that can now be laughed at, and what was left out that would become very important later.  I am a computer programmer, I know how we think usually, and it's not with human beings in mind. I'm sure when someone completes a task or deletes a file it seems perfectly natural to get rid of it quickly.. no fuss and no memory. However in these last few decades what we forgot was that we are not given to storage the way our computers would like. We are not given to writing the way computers would like either. I cannot look at my handwriting throughout the years on my palm computer... each written word is instantly translated into a perfect substitution. I cannot laugh at my spelling mistakes because they are instantly corrected and brought to my attention, which serves to annoy me in the present instead of humoring me in the future. I cannot recover the contact list I deleted when my palm computer's batteries ran out before I could synchronize, and I cannot recover the small notes I wrote after a date when I thought my heart would burst from love.   I video chat with Ben in Britain, but there are times when I would give anything to read a note he would write, in his handwriting.. in his character.. thought out and with care. There would be no awkward gaps in conversation, no skipping of the deeper issues in order to keep the momentum going, no bouncing from one topic to another in anticipation of the other's boredom. In my notes there are subjects you can tell I wrote with apprehension, the hesitation apparent in the darty movements of the ink and the constant scribbling over words and people I didn't want in my life anymore. All of this is lost in a world where all we see from our authors and friends are perfect letters, like this blog entry.. the perfect "w" every time.. you don't know when I've paused, or when I changed my mind. Our friend's email has been sanitized and white washed for grammar, spelling, punctuation, and even those "ya-know" slang words that any email program will bring to your attention with a smiling paper clip, as if to say:    "This is really unprofessional, and could be miss-interpreted.. You�ll look like a jackass actually... would you care to spell it right before you send this out to the world?"   It's hard to say no.  In this world we want everything to be digital. We want to use Palm computers because it seems like it should make sense for us to use it. No retyping contacts.. no making an appointment entry in three different machines... all together and tight and connected. However what we haven't learned yet is how not to use computers. We have been preached at and believe that if we have a choice between pen and paper.. and a computer... no matter what the task.. you always choose the computer. This is wrong. I predict that computers will become smaller and disappear. We will tell our radio to go louder in our car, and look up the closest McDonald's on our GPS. We will even view pictures and video chat with our friends at the speed of light without even needing to click a mouse. However, I also believe that we will learn that books are always best when you can turn the pages with your hand, that a rose from an old love cannot be pressed and preserved in the seams of a Pocket PC. That a post card is better than a wireless text message from the beach.. and that no matter how much I see Ben through a video camera and how much he sees me... light from his face to my eye is the best use of the speed of light, not to go from sea to shining sea.  In the future, may our hard drives be empty, and our old binders be full.  Thank You!

      Neat history of coffee to from MSNBC:  History  600 C.E. - Legendary discovery of coffee by Kaldi, an Ethiopian goat herder, who witnessed his excited goats after they ate berries from a coffee plant  1000 C.E. - Coffee crosses the Red Sea to Arabia, where it spreads everywhere that Islam reaches. During this period, the coffee house is born.  1650 C.E. � Indian pilgrim Bada Budan succeeds in smuggling some of the heavily controlled coffee seeds out of Arabia. This paves the way for the European coffee market and European production through their colonies.  1720 C.E. � Coffee sprouts �borrowed� from a coffee tree owned by Louis XIV make their way across the Atlantic and are planted in the French colony of Martinique. Fifty years later, Martinique would be home to over 18,000 coffee trees and precursor to Central and South Americas� coffee markets.  1727 C.E. � Colonel Palheta, a Brazilian diplomat, charms the French governor of Guiana�s wife into giving him some coffee shoots. Brazil would grow to be the world�s largest coffee empire.  1893 C.E. � Coffee seed from Brazil is brought to Kenya and modern-day Tanzania, ironically located a few hundred miles south of Ethiopia, coffee�s birthplace.

      In reponse to my last post about coffee growers problems, MSNBC has put out a great storyline and interactive discussion about Coffee growers and thier problems. I really am pissed off that although coffee is at a hundred year low on the whole sale side we still pay $3.00 a cup and Starbucks gets all the profit. No wonder their stock is so high. Another reason why free trade is only free trade in name only, take this tour and experience what these poor coffee growers.. the people who make what we could not live without.. these generations of good kind people, are going through because of the capitalist markets and supply side movers taking advantage of their lives and now hot product. so horribly sad... . urlLink go here

       I think my blog sucks    I mean, I sometimes go on blogger.com as I'm sure many do and browse the "Update List" and see what's out there. I never visit the "Recommended" list because I've always been against recommendations. Often the best books I've read and the best sites I've visited have been off the beaten path. In fact I think the majority of them are. Also what is recommended is usually based on something going on in the Current Events area.. as our 8th grade social studies teachers would word it. For instance on Blogger.com there is a reference to a  urlLink coffee blog . Not bad... except that it's about organic coffee.. something that has taken the world by storm lately and there is  urlLink even pending legislation at Berkeley  to ban non-organic coffee from EVERY coffee house. So, it's a Current Events thing.  I read a lot and I've already read about the coffee thing in the Economist, so I'm not interested in reading a blog about it. What interest me are the real bloggers, the people with ideas that link to each other in this great party.. usually hosted on blogspot.com. I think one of the biggest reasons I don't get invited into that group is because I have built my site around the blog.. so that it's not one of those quickly HTML loads like the vast majority of blogs are.. and infact I would assume without broadband the vast majority of this site would be un-navigational.  So be it.  When I was a kiddie playing on BBS's (Bulliten Board Systems, the first internet... kinda) we had capitalist market practices play out all the time. A "new" 28.8k modem would come out.. and the nicest boards would ban 14.4 and lower... when 33.6k came out, they banned the 28.8k modems.. leaving the hapless 2400 baud modem users in the dust to visit Compuserve bulliten boards that hadn't been updated since 1986. We learned that if we were going to keep up with content.. we had to buy the better modem. Of course, broadband is not as easy as walking to your local then Babbages and buying a new modem. Now it's more the service than the modem.. a 21st century model played out first in the cell phone area and doing quite well. Unfortunately services are usually competative against each other.. and thus many don't have broadband. However I don't feel like handicapping my site because I worry that a 56k modem will take a woppin' 76 seconds to load my Career tab. So, if that or just the general lack of quality of my post are what's causing me to be left out the great blog-a-thon.. I'm ok with that.... or at least I'll pretend to be.

      It is a constant struggle, really, to determine what the hearts desires, the soul needs, and the body requires to look fashionable and attractive. I could be at once excited about a new technology, no matter how ridiculous and perverse, and then watch Maya Angelou on CSPAN2 recite "and still I rise" and instantly feel as if all the time I have spent on the mechanical and mean exercise of my right sided mind was a waste, and that I would have been better served sipping tea in my bedroom reading Rainer Rilke or Alice Walker. It is these deep currents that make me question who I am, and realize that there is a peace that will forever allude me because I will never decide what I want to be.   In material possessions many people feel they have no rival, as if possessing them was enough and for many it is enough to get by. For those people it is an insult to suggest that their upright attitude and their remorseless pursuit of their own agenda is anything less than what they should be doing. Maybe they are of a single mind, and perhaps I should be envious of such a clear and detached purpose. However there are times when I enjoy being confused about what muse I shall surrender to. If it is better to pursue a complicated and all consuming career to better dress my body.. or to retire under some willow tree, damn capitalism, and sing out to the gods that my soul is available to the highest bidder because I wish no longer to possess it whole.   I spent all day working on this website, putting in all the fixings to ensure that my talents, diverse as they are, were represented. Even so, I feel the urge to do away with the Development and Personal tab and focus solely on poems and art. There is another side of me that enjoys the nice dinners and the plays I could attend when employed, and wish to work to seek those out as well. It is this constant pull of opposing forces which prevents me from delegating my time correctly or even responsibly. The worst part is I don't even know what I'm best at, since anyone can be good enough to get by at some things.. but talent.. but inspiration.. that is what makes all parts glad to participate.  I think if anything I enjoy problem solving, and I also very much enjoy computers and always have since I was a child. Now though it all seems like such a chore, such a horrible uncertain directionless sandbox in which there are too many crying children and not enough sand. An ego after all is a construct that our brains have developed in order to help us participate in achieving and preserving our possessions on this planet. To lose a possession to non-payment, to lose a loved one to another, to lose a position because of a deficit in our knowledge; these things are like dying to the living. We will maintain ourselves at any cost. It is said however that those things which must be got at any cost will be got at all cost.   Putting the pictures up of Paris and remembering all that we talked about there makes me depressed. It is very possible to never be alone and yet be lonely in that inner place where you only invite people in, and no matter how much people try to be a deep and profound part of your life it is only you who can give them that entrance. It is when we give them that entrance and they refuse it that we are genuinely hurt beyond what our ego or pride would normally allow. It is in that inner place of peace and reflection that I have found no one to invite in for years. I have people who feel they are close to me, who beg to be let inside, but as Emily Dickinson once said:  The Soul selects her own Society-- Then--shuts the Door-- To her divine Majority--Present no more--  Unmoved--she notes the Chariots--pausing-- At her low Gate-- Unmoved--an Emperor be kneeling Upon her Mat--  I've known her--from an ample nation-- Choose One-- Then--close the Valves of her attention-- Like Stone.  Are we no longer given to this type of reflection? Do our lives with so much pouring in, beckon us always forward, never towards reflection? Perhaps our chambers of the deepest love and loathing are not allowed even the recognition of a possible deeper world where friendship and companionship is deeper and transcends what television has taught us is the shape and limits of love.  Even writing that word invokes a sheepish grin, recognition of the clich� and sentimentality it evokes. A world known before we knew how to name the chemicals which press against the brain to make our cheeks red and our heart flutter at infatuation.   What is left of this world when we finally find out what all of the cogs in our machine do? When we can name each strand of our internal fabric and sow a body and mind to our liking. Will there no longer be any long talks over coffee or meaningful hugs between two people? Is our soul merely the combination of our cells, or is it a gift which will withdrawal from us the more we examine the dust around its chambers and pronounce that we can deconstruct it?

      Good Morning  Well today I've been busy working on the site some more. Not only have I added a few more tabs which you will see hopefully by the end of today, but I've also been working on putting a few pictures online as well.  I've created a personal tab (moving the blog to the /blog) directory... and also creating a Development tab where I will put all my Microsoft Beta and Vesuvius Framework information. Of course, things could be going smoother. I tried using Frontpage's photo gallery plug-in to build that part of the site. However, when I decided the pictures were too big and resized them using Windows XP's very convienient resize tool and then updating the site.. Frontpage got very confused and very bloated. I spent the better part of the morning entering in Captions and Descriptions in my images online.. so I figured if I resized the pictures Frontpage would simply apply those new (800x600) images into the photo gallery.. WRONG!  Turns out for some reason Frontpage encodes the picture size into the gallery. No problem.. just invoke the gallery engine and re-save right? Well, that brought a Pentium 4 1.5 Ghz machine with 256 MB memory to it's knees! I don't know what it was doing... but it constantly asked me to resave my pictures in the directory and then wouldn't save the photo gallery... when I tried testing the site.. the link would simply point to a "tmp" file which Frontpage was suppose to process but didn't.  So after a reboot here I am.. faced with the prospect of re-doing all my captions. Anyway, the additions should be up soon so everyone that wants to take a look at how Vesuvius is coming along can. I also will be opening up a Development blog for the project to track my progress for my benefit, but others can read it as well.  I will be accepting offers of help on the project after the site gets built up and I move it beyond the UML / framework stage.  Catch ya later!

      Hello   Today I am relieved that I have got the articles on the rise and fall of the web out in to the open. In reality, this was a project for myself to justify writing the Vesuvius project when I know that there are already several P2P and authentication P2P servers out there. The one that springs to mind immediately is the Limewire Server project. However I think that having a framework written in Microsoft .Net is important because it targets the retail space and we all know Windows rules the retail space. Still, getting publicity for my articles is impossible, as submittance to Slashdot and other choice blogs have netted 0 results. Still, it will sit on my servers in case someone wants to take a look.    As far as personal stuff goes, today is going to be hell week for me. Not only do I have finances and other things to do, but my father goes under the knife for a hip replacement and I am traveling to Nashville to visit some of Brad and Brian's (the twins) friends. I am stopping by my aunte's house and spending the nights there. I really enjoy the idea of doing this although the drive will be horrible. Still, I am slated to go so I have to make sure everything is done here before Thursday.    Enjoy the September release of the Think Tank!

      Hello.   I am reading a book called  "McWorld vs. Jihad"  by Benjamin R. Barber currently  (Amazon: Sales Rank 1,646; 42 reviews) . Those who have read the book will understand how eye opening it is. Although the title sounds boringly like all the other titles that have been vomited out from identical analyst with identical views after September 11th, this book was written in 1995.  The forward was updated after September 11th, 2001 for this publication, but the author has smartly left the book intact, resisting the urge to go through the book and update all the paragraphs with the ending "I told you so!". Instead you get to read about what he saw in 1995 when he wrote the book, and marvel at his genius.   This book is not about terrorism either. It's about the problems of capitalism.. for too long the only government the people of the world  trust completely ... and the sort of counter-cultural mystical arch-enemy of capitalism (as in they both created each other and thrive on each other, kind of like Batman and Joker "I made you.. you made me... it's kind of funny when you think about it"). Benjamin unfortunately calls this counter-cultural reaction "jihad". However it does not imply what you think. Instead it represents all of us who are fundamentalist, non-modern, and find our values threatened by the global post-nation world we find ourselves in. For instance, Rev. Faldwell saying that the Twin Towers were blown up because God was punishing us for homosexuals and the ACLU. That's jihad... and it's really apparent in fundamentalist Christian teachings. Anyone who had experiences in that world or friends who do know it's very much:    "it's us against them, the world is bad, Fox after 9pm is sinful, don't give in to the consumerism and sex filled shows.. Or associate with evil kids or anyone else unless their converted to our Lord Jesus Christ. All of those poor damned souls need to be enlightened by believing in our thoughts and beliefs, they'll be so much happier." .   Of course all intelligent people know that the difference between Protestants and Muslums are very slim when it comes to the dividing rhetoric of "war between good and evil". All fundamentalist, either Christian, Conservative Republican (international as well), Jewish, and Muslim have the same model: The world is getting worse, people are falling into a trap, don't trust global institutions like the UN, maintain national borders, no foreign labor, ect. So, jihad to Benjamin is not just what the media has told us in the 2001 - 2002 years, but something much deeper.. a universal rebellion to what capitalism and globalization running unchecked has done, and it comes from a premodern religious and conservative base. According to him, this is not just an Eastern thing (as evidenced in Seattle after book was written) but something that will continue to grow as time progresses. Paradoxically, as the world becomes nationless in trade and corporate reach, the more people fragment into ethnocentric regimens for a hope at maintaining the status quo. Both sides of course are wrong. So these two powers fight each other, and neither can win.   What I don't like is his idea that the solution is exporting not capitalism but democracy. That isn't really the solution, since even the Netherlands, Germany, and the USA are participating in jihad and they are democratic. This is evidenced by a bumper sticker I saw on some old pickup truck a few weeks back, "Get America Out Of the United Nations". I don't think democracy is the answer. What I do believe is the answer is wheeling in capitalism, which has expanded to far to fast and with little regulation. Like Benjamin says quite well "we are all consumers, but we are not citizens".   I'm saying all this because I really enjoy his chapters on the "McWorld" aspect of our lives. Don't get me wrong, I am an avid reader of the Economist, listener of the BBC, and enjoy Parisian coffee. I want trade to expand because self determination of a people who can control their own destiny and make and sell a widget on the open market is the ideal and the only way humanity can get rid of poverty and ignorance. Problem is, that is not longer the aim of Capitalism (this is where I move away from the book).  In my view, we need a new word. Capitalism is nothing more than the pursuit of... err... capital. The problem with this system is unlike democracy once you get capital you want more. This is because your needs expand as your power does... like my favorite quote "a luxury once sampled soon becomes necessity". The poor farmer who grows coffee beans in Columbia sells to his distributor at a very low price, the lowest in 100 years actually. However because the distributor loves capital, he then turns around and sells it at much higher prices (that's why Starbucks is still $3.00 a cup). This means he gets a great deal. However this doesn't trickle down to the grower. We all know capital in the system we've created called "Capitalism" has one horrible and disgusting trait... it tends to pool. It pools in the pockets of large post-national corporations, people, and even nations. We get screwed cause we still pay $3.00 a cup at Starbucks.. the farmer gets screwed because he doesn't see hardly a cent of that purchase. We would go insane in the morning without that farmer's hard work.. but he doesn't get the "thank you" that he deserves in the capitalist system. This is shameful, and must be stopped.   Capital must move constantly, and we shouldn't tolerate it staying in one place and ballooning post-national companies into a state of quasi-nationhood themselves. General Electric is a nation unto itself, anyone who has worked there knows this. So is Toshiba in Japan. They do not measure their borders in geographical terms but in market penetration, and their conquest is continuous, unlike the old nations that use democracy or socialism and have stopped conquering land long ago. We are subject to their battle. That's why television has become so nauseating and people have stopped watching in masses. There is nothing on but advertisements. There is no art in movies, no triumph in pop music, and we get them all combined under the Pepsi umbrella when they pay to put Britney Spears together with Austin Powers in a commercial. We get the feeling that the CD and the movie were all just pawns to entice our fancy to the final act... the follow up ads using the characters we enjoyed and felt comfortable with.     In this McWorld nothing is sacred, there is no commonwealth. Software, music, video, logos, Mickey Mouse, all of it is protected from our hands so that we cannot manipulate or share it, but it is crammed down our throats after our hands are tied by legal rulings.   I so didn't want to become one of those people. One of those people you think about when I say "one of those people". I think free trade and the exchange of goods on a global scale is wonderful and the future of our world. I believe that our cultures will be protected, but we will have entry points in our ethnic psyche where we will participate with the rest of the world in peace. We will not have to lose our identity when we gain a presence. However this is not possible with Capitalism. We cannot trust the corporations anymore than we trust government, and we should harshly chop down companies, particularly post-national ones, and make them accountable as a government is.. to the people for the people. We should get rid of front-weighted boards with yes men who hold all the votes. We should give each person who owns shares the same and equal voice in the decision making. That way, we can bring democracy to the new super-structures of the world... no longer nations, but corporations. We are trying for democracy on soil when the battle has moved to the ether. It has moved on to the offices, the airwaves, the television, the internet. It is using democracy to ensure that it does not have democracy imposed on itself. We make laws that free corporations from any responsibility to the citizens of the world, hoping only that they "do the right thing" themselves. However we do not give citizens this privilege and we should not give corporations the ability to only say in their corporate reports "working to be a good corporate citizen" in bold letters and have that be the end of their accountability.   Ugh.. I'll write more later :-)

      "As my first act, I will create a grand army of the Republic to counter the increasing threat of the seperatist" - Senator Palpatine, (the emperor) Star Wars Episode II  Now  urlLink read this little tid-bit from The New York Times  about the recent release of the Bush administration's document to Congress:   "The document, titled "The National Security Strategy of the United States," sketches out a far more muscular and sometimes aggressive approach to national security than any since the Reagan era.   It includes the discounting of most nonproliferation treaties in favor of a doctrine of "counterproliferation," a reference to everything from missile defense to forcibly dismantling weapons or their components. It declares that the strategies of containment and deterrence -- staples of American policy since the 1940s -- are all but dead.   There is no way in this changed world, the document states, to deter those who "hate the United States and everything for which it stands."   In the 33-page document, President Bush also seeks to answer the critics of growing American muscle-flexing by insisting that the United States will exploit its military and economic power to encourage "free and open societies, " rather than seek "unilateral advantage." The document calls this "a distinctly American internationalism."   -  David E. Sanger, New York Times, Friday, September 20, 2002.   I only bring up Star Wars as I have in these last new blogs not because I am a fan (I think the movies suck), but because Lucas' cinematic vision was to illustrate how Democracies turn into dictatorships in the newest films (TIME Magazine,  urlLink read article here .). Below is his quote about the subject:  " So where does Lucas stand in this political polemic? "I'm more on the liberal side of things," he says. "I grew up in San Francisco in the '60s, and my positions are sort of shaped by that ... If you look back 30 years ago, there were certain issues with the Kennedys, with Richard Nixon, that focused my interest." Lucas' own geopolitics can sound pretty bleak: "All democracies turn into dictatorships�but not by coup. The people give their democracy to a dictator, whether it's Julius Caesar or Napoleon or Adolf Hitler. Ultimately, the general population goes along with the idea ... What kinds of things push people and institutions into this direction?"   In Clones, Lucas goes a way toward answering that question. "That's the issue that I've been exploring: How did the Republic turn into the Empire? That's paralleled with: How did Anakin turn into Darth Vader? How does a good person go bad, and how does a democracy become a dictatorship? It isn't that the Empire conquered the Republic, it's that the Empire is the Republic." Lucas' comments clarify the connection between the Anakin trilogy and the Luke trilogy: that the Empire was created out of the corruption of the Republic, and that somebody had to fight it. "One day Princess Leia and her friends woke up and said, 'This isn't the Republic anymore, it's the Empire. We are the bad guys. Well, we don't agree with this. This democracy is a sham, it's all wrong.'"  " -  Time Magazine, Saturday, Apr. 20, 2002   I think if America continues in this direction, and indeed it seems impossible with America wanting to maintain it's number 1 position that we won't, future generations might find Lucas' boring and painful but ultimately timely series of movies as a reflection of the time. That we ourselves will march the "Imperial March" of the Empire... once a great Republic.   Either way, since people didn't understand my Death Star reference a few blogs ago... this is the explination behind my thinking... no I'm not a light-saber toting dork.. I have a method to my madness :-)

       SCREWED BY MSNBC AGAIN!  : So I see an ad on MSNBC about the  urlLink program called "Nachman",  who is apparently some extremely overweight man who has been in the news business way to long. Anyway, the ad stated that they would be showing us the Eastern television programs that are being broadcast with translations so that we can "see what they are saying". This might be interesting, I assumed. I missed the 7pm EST showing but caught the replay at 10:00pm because I happened to have pizza at the time and you  HAVE  to watch television while you're eating pizza.    Anyway, so Nachman comes on with two people from Eastern television who will sit there and discuss what we see. Fair enough.    What happens after that is horrible but very MSNBC. After Nachman would setup a clip, describing what we were to see, noting that it is dubbed in English in the Middle East, he sends us to the clip.... except he talks right over the whole broadcast! Assuming we cannot listen to the ENGLISH ourselves and form our own opinions on what is being said, his mike drowns out the broadcast, and also only shows us about 10 seconds per clip. Not exactly a "we report, you decide" mix to borrow from another equally laughable cable news channel. So after 10 seconds of arabic dubbed in English with English commentary by Nachman, he then goes on to ask the guest why they say what they do, and report what they do... without even letting us in on the content!     Then the worst happens... they go to commercial. Maybe it will be better when they come back, I think. Wrong! They move on to another topic entirely! An ad on MSNBC made us believe that this was going to be some kind of NPR like in-depth analysis and translation of the Eastern reporting of recent events. Instead, it was just a five minute garbage piece where Nachman selected footage purposely inflamatory.. of the first day of school in Bagdad where teachers fire riffles into the air at the beginning of the school year for instance.. and then asked the eastern news men what it meant to them. When they stated calmly that it was simply tradition dating before Saddam.... nevermind!, interrupted with Nachman's own thoughts on the issue, "I see it as showing this society is so militarized that..."... blah blah blah.       So, MSNBC is sworn off . I might still watch Imus In The Morning when I've been up all night and need to see some burn out flip out over a mis-played tape and insult his guest with ease. I mean Howard Stern insults, but his guest are just big busted women who take their clothing off and other sleezy individuals.. but when Imus states to a former and highly influencial Bush aid that he is "glad I didn't get those wedding pictures you sent me cause I don't care about your life that much"... that is just pure entertainment.      Screwed again . When will I learn that besides the  urlLink Economist , the  urlLink BBC  urlLink , and NPR  (PBS is NPR's bitch when it comes to quality news, there is a reason why Bill Moyer chose NPR as his commentary engine when he developed his new show  urlLink NOW for PBS ), there is absolutely no source you can trust. MSNBC and CNN aren't news, they are entertainment shows that use real-time events as their content, kind of a 24 hour COPS episode that never ends, with a dash of America's Most Wanted.     I just wish the people they put on the air would understand this. Anyone from the Middle East or Asian countries look like they've just been run over by a train at the end of their interview. Often, they open their mouths as if trying to speak a final, desperate word of sanity right when the talking head says "Thank You very much for your time... next on..."    They must think we are as arrogant as Chris Matthews and.. "Nachman", and unfortunately for many Americans this is their only source of news. They don't read the New Republic, or Foreign Affaris, or The Economist, or listen to NPR or BBc World. Worse, they may get use to having any situation summed up in 5 minutes with quick shot questions and sidebar commentary that the guests aren't allowed to reply to because the host moves on too fast to the next topic he's already made his mind up on.     As a project, watch Chris Matthews if you can stand it. Count how many times he frames a questions as "Is this situation just A, or is it actually B?".... A & B being Chris' interpretation. C & D be damned. For instance, "Is Saddam trying to trick the United Nations or is he just readying his weapons of mass destruction?". Umm.... could he be really just letting in weapon inspectors because the Arab world, through the UN, is now pressuring him? Never! This is A or B.... and you must answer in that frame.  Try it out... then you too will become a mass media hater.

       Showdown with Saddam...  momentarily      By now most people know that 40 minutes ago Iraq agreed to allow weapons inspectors back into their country, although this is only in writing and we have not tested this out presently. Regardless, as usual I find the fun in between the lines. Here in the USA the state of our news media is horrible. We don't have a BBC anymore, CNN has got swallowed up by AOL and is competing for the glitz and fiz that MSNBC offers. A case in point is what just happened on TV. When Iraq said they would allow in weapon inspectors at 7:00pm, MSNBC had a program on called... wait for it... "showdown with Saddam". From my brief stay on the channel I saw someone reflecting on the gulf war and the problems they faced. War is all but impossible now, and perhaps Bush will put down his war machine and go about looking at home... not that one would blaim him for trying to distract us by facing us always abroad, he sucks when it comes to his own country.  However I find it funny first that the US news media was so quick to embrace this idea of war to such an extent as to make a TV special about it, but second that they were basically outdone, like George Bush was, by the swift change in foreign affairs. They essentially were caught looking shameful, as usual.   What is more frustrating is that while BBC World & CNN were faithfully doing interviews and flashing news alerts about it... MSNBC... well... the people who break into to programming to announce a traffic accident in Idaho... they were still showing "Showdown with Saddam". No commentary, no breaking news, nothing. Poor guys.. I'm sure they are crying in their control rooms over the lost ratings. Maybe they just can't let the dream of Ashley Banfeld in a flack jacket once again fade away.   We need a PBS World in this country, and get rid of this commercial crap.

        Good Morning    Today is going to be awesome on  urlLink C-SPAN ! (tons of bloggers instantly dismiss me and click another link after that comment, which is fine). They will be broadcasting the World Bank and IMF protest as well as have officials and protestors on their program. Of course you can watch this online in broadband. I have very mixed feelings on this, since I do believe that the privatization of everything, including water, is a cancer that is growing on this world; but I also think that people do need to allow for the free flow of capital. It's just that not everything needs to be dependent on capital. There is too much to write in a short blog, but I am working on an article on it and the "common wealth" for the think tank. Still, check out C-SPAN today as their coverage is always even handed and beyond fair.     Also Brad is going sky-diving today. If there are any pictures I will post them online.

       I QUIT TECHNOLOGY FOR GOOD     I figured I would post an update even though nothing is really going on right now I wish to comment on. I am in the process of making changes in my life that will help me out in the long run. It is apparent that at least in the Cincinnati area my career is very limited. There just isn't anyone doing any Java or enterprise development that doesn't already have 300 resumes from people with Master Degrees. I figured working in Paris with France Telecom would count for something in the long run, but all I am getting are Dear John letters and no leads for jobs.     So, I give up. I've been trying for a year to find a job and after tons of horrible experiences I'm hanging up my resume. The Career tab will be disappearing soon, as will anything related to a job search. The economy isn't getting better and technology is in depression without any signs of getting out. I'm going to take a low job at a factory where my father is an industrial engineer working nights making... lenses. Sure six years of information technology will go to waste, but I don't feel like losing my car and other things on the basis of pride. I saw my father go through this during the last Bush recession in the early 90's and I know what he had to do after getting laid off at General Electric as an engineer to survive.     I also am going to go back to college and study something else entirely. I will always love technology and work on it in my spare time, but I think that after all my experiences of working for an industry 70% vapor it's time I find my voice elsewhere. It's going to be hard, but people have decisions much harder than mine to make, and simply lingering on bad decisions and lost opportunities nets nothing but resentment.     Maybe in a few years I'll return to it, but it will never be as much fun or exciting as it was the last four years I worked in the field, from 1999 on. I will certainly enjoy using toys like Pocket PCs and online music services and game consoles, along with all the .Net stuff. However, a boy has to do what a boy has to do.    Back when I was being educated in the classic liberal arts fashion at my catholic high school, my philosophy teacher told us that life was a game of chutes and ladders, and that you have to be prepared for both. In case you're wondering where private education fractions off from public to add value, there is your entry point. Well, I as well as many people have fallen through a chute and there is no ladder to be seen. The things I thought I needed I found out I don't... the things I left three levels above this one before I fell down the chute will be there when I eventually make it back up there... or maybe I'll put the game away all together. It's up to me.     I am not, nor will I ever, whine about how my world has changed and how disoriented I feel in it. I feel comfort in the fact that I have to get back to my education for guidance.. to those words that I learned when I was young from reading Emerson with jealousy as if I was the sole possessor of his knowledge, and the poetry of Rainer Rilke and Maya Angelou, and the righteous indignation that such knowledge will breed in a soul. I have so often ignored what people are now just discovering, and have the genius to act shocked and innocent at: the horrible state of business in this country. The insults, politics, and personal agendas, and creative interpretations of rules to scatter their own wills. We want immortality and managers and those above them like planting their seed in our conscience with the old abuse cycle of "don't tell or I won't love you anymore and fire you". I was always fired. I liked being fired for putting my feet up on my desk or saying what I feel. I was booted out of General Electric and Firstar with my free speech and principles in tact. Still when the bills came due I realized how compromising I could be.. and they knew that... they counted on it.. because they all do.     As the righteous babe Ani DiFranco said in her song Garden of Simple:   "and, you know they never really owned you   you just carried them around you   and then one day you put 'em down   and found your hands were free"      It was a fun few years, but the game is over. Anyone who thinks otherwise is just holding on to the same hope I had up to a few months ago. However think really hard at your career... do you really love it? Or did it grow on you because you were living a life to fast moving to trim it?      Well, I'm not that stupid. In truth, we were promised dress down liberal thought and re-inventing the world. We got nothing but grief. Be honest, look again, and get back to me.      I'll be elsewhere.

      Good Morning   I expect the DOW to close -100+ points once again. Merril also downgraded General Electric so that is going to pressure things. I'm happy about that, because General Electric is one of the most evil entities on the face of the planet. When I worked for their Aircraft Engine division I had to deal with 50 underpaid foreign nationals stuck in one room sharing one "table" per computer because their labour was so cheap. Meanwhile the white people were outside that small room in their huge new-age building with digital televisions and big offices. It was a sweat shop for code. I'm not upset at seeing them and their money at any cost asses fry, along with the slutty managers I had to work with having blatant affairs with women in front of everyone. It's amazing that the company is still functioning. Their estimates were so off about their revenue too, and cost savings. I worked in their technology division, and I know for a fact that by storing a Word document in a webpage on an intranet you can't save a billion dollars a year. That's where my comment about technology being 70% vapor comes from. I've seen so many estimates about how much money could be saved / made with technology that were grossly off the mark.   Although I have also been hit by the downturn in technology and business, I am OK with it since I know that purification is occuring in our system. I am very happy to be unemployed if it also means that when I finally get a job along with millions of other IT workers we will come in to a much more sane, humane, and ethical place. I think that's worth the cost. I saw so much chrun, drama, and illegal activity in Cincinnati alone that I know a good washing is desperately in need.

      I love the fall I have my windows open... I love the air  And then I have Radiohead playing as well... �Lucky�... it's so mellow and kind of Nirvana sounding... and it always puts me in a mood I can't explain... it's so like... depressed electricity running through me... like when you slip in socked feet and the sensation runs up your body.... kind of a modulated version of that... constant... dark.. it's wonderful.. smoke from houses burning wood....  It reminds you of football nights in high school.. when the biggest competition was in the stands. Who you would stand with, who you were next to, who you wanted to go to the party with you when the game was over. Hot Chocolate. The biggest fights happen in this weather, love falls to the ground to grow in weather like this. You buy books and make soup and do things at home without feeling like your missing something more important. You put on that sweater that you have been thinking about all summer.. the one you wish you could wear when it's ninety out because of how it snugs you on your skin. You can wear it now, and you take it out of your chest and smell the cedar on it.  And then when it's the next day you run out to get a pumpkin on a road called River Road that you can actually see the river on. You go to an old farmer's market where they have tons of pumpkins.. and if you don't look across the river to Cincinnati and it's ugliness and you pretend it's gone you almost feel free from the trains, airplanes, and drudgery that can mark an ugly fall. Instead you argue with your significant other or mother or father about what pumpkin to pick.. and argue about impossibly insane things we argue about when we are at peace, like the right shape and how much guts we are going to have to pull out... and we like to talk in terms of gutting.. as if we're butchers grading cattle... and you marvel at how you use to head to the biggest pumpkin when you were young.. instinctively you would wrap your cold hands around the biggest one and try to lift it.. and drop to the ground with a thud. They would never let you get the largest pumpkin.. you got a medium one... a practical one.. like the one you're going to get now... and then go home with it. Candles.. you always need candles... and then home with it.  I love fall.

       So Pissed Off At Wall Street   I'm so impressed that people are willing to let things crash and burn so readily. Consumer confidence released today shows that it's at it's lowest level since 1993. This is only the latest in economic indicators that are 5 and 6 years back in readings. Yet, the stock market did nothing today. Now, everyone knows I'm not in the market so this is not a short seller cry.. but it is defintely a cry to visibility. What exactly is the stock market moving to? The DOW was down to 5 year lows a few weeks ago, when earnings were good. Now earnings season is over, and we are getting fresh news that the worst is yet to come. Manufacturing is down to contraction levels (below 50) and the above mentioned consumer confidence report is also extrememly negative. Yet, the stock market is not reacting to the news. It may be possible that the market was reacting to this weeks ago when it went to five year lows and this is just a lagging indicator, but lets not fool ourselves, the DOW isn't that good at knowing the future. Chances are we are in a recession now, as the majority of Americans indicate in polls (63% feel they are in a recession). The only problem is Americans don't pay attention to the economic data, only the DOW. If it's up above the lows, most people aren't concerned. Or at least... the media doesn't tell people to be concerned.   I think that it has something to do with the mid-term elections. I believe that all the republicans on Wall Street, thankful that they have been bailed out from under their illegal trades and deeds are going to try and keep this stock market up at any cost so that voters don't glance on CNBC real quick and see DOW 7,500 before they go to polls. What's really miserable is that both sides really aren't paying much attention to the economic state, either because Democrats know Republicans will crush any social relief like unemployment extention and then use the new economic debate to pitch lower taxes again, or that they will be stone walled by Republicans who don't want the economy to come up during the elections and who don't want it to appear their tax cuts were ineffective. The Republican line is that the economy is growing.. just slowly.. so shut up about it.  Looks like life is going to suck a little longer. That's ok, I got my can goods and my huntin' riffle!

       Why The Economy Doesn't Suck    When working on my business plan I've had to rummage through tons of data on financial statistics and business revenue models for my business now and in the future. During this process I am running to the same problem I imagine everyone in the "what-if" and "how come?" field have been dealing with for some time... the data is dirty.   What do I mean? Take a look at any chart of something general... say the DOW, NASDAQ, and S&P over a 5 year period. What you will see is a DOW and S&P hanging flat to lower to the tune of 20% while the NASDAQ rockets off to 150% around 1999 and then plummets to 60% lower right now. Although this sounds pretty bad, the overall average for all three indexes factoring out the NASDAQ bubble is about 30%.. very bad but not as bad as it feels in the market place right now. In fact, this great creation and destruction of wealth has in many ways cancelled itself out in the sense that you can see from the end of 1998 to the end of 2000 on the NASDAQ that it almost seems like the average entered a "black box" and then came out on the other side at the exact same level.   At least.. that's what the data says. The problem is that the world has changed substantially from 1997 to 2002. Business and our daily lives have changed substantially because of information technology, and business processes and management has indeed changed. The problem is, you can't tell from the data how exactly the world has changed because the data was trapped in an irrational jump. No one can use growth data  from 1999 and 2000.. which just happens to be the only real data out right now from the Federal Government (read: Commerce Department and Census Department) because good data usually lags about two years behind the current date. Therefore, when people dive into growth, productivity, and specific business revenue for the past few years to try and predict what the future holds... you can't trust the numbers!  This has more affects than just on my business plan.. it creates the entire lack of visibility that is affecting the stock market and the economy at this time. Something definitely happened in that "black box" period of late 1998 to late 2000, but we don't have any accurate data to tell us what it was. Many companies that were part of a business area and making money in 1999 are gone now... and it doesn't seem proper to use that data to predict your own business will succeed since they were gone in two years. If I put in my business plan that business sector X grew by 30% from 1997 to 1999 that means nothing about the present of the future. Can I still expect rapid growth because of productivity enhancements from computers? Can I still expect good profits from the business sectors that were huge in 2000? No one, me or the banks and venture vultures, would believe this from this data.  The data for 2001 is even tainted because remember we still had Enron and WorldCom back then.. and both energy and telecom have crashed hard. So we are left with 2002.. even though by any measure this is the most pessimistic of time periods and not great to predict business success on.   So basically I am left with 7 years of nothing in the data market. However everyone that studies Economics knows that the economy grows and evolves DESPITE the cost of money... or the influence, to extend it. This means that money is simply the mediator of trade and growth.. the circulatory system to transfer goods that would have balanced themselves to equilibrium given some other open system anyway. Wood would have crossed over to the US to build houses for the baby boomers despite whatever stock market or money supply existed because the supply / demand was there. So it doesn't matter if a wood chopper's stock went up or down %50 during this time because the goods was moving despite the flow of money into a company. It is important therefore to rely more on concrete "self-evident" facts instead of the data we commonly use in business projections, and from this standpoint... subtracting the stock market completely.. the economy has grown, changed, and advanced.  The NASDAQ might have went down 60%, but that doesn't mean our information infrastructure dropped 60% as well.. in fact it has only increased!  The technology and products we have now could only be dreamt of during the boom years of 1999 and 2000. In two short years, fraught with shocks and shakes in our lives.. we have still managed to deliver in our economy more services and products than ever dreamt of before. We have digital cable with 400+ channels, interactive television where you can watch HBO shows and movies on demand, high-speed internet is available in all cities and suburbs that want it, and we even have wireless hubs that flow internet access to PCs, Laptops, and Pocket PCs anywhere in our home or work environment at 11 MB / second. We have color cell phones with email, internet, and... Monkey Ball. We have MSN 8 and AOL 8, and Bluetooth which allows us to add an appointment in our MSN calendar online and have that sync to our Outlook XP, MSN 8 client, Pocket PC, and cell phone all with one button click and wave of the cell phone across our computer before we walk out the door. We can buy groceries online in many areas again.. and have them delivered, and we can legally access the wealth of music and movies online for less than $10.00 a month in subscription fees combined! Houses are being built faster than people can move in to them (this is a little troubling, but overall about half of the bubble demand is indeed there) and cars are flying out the showroom because dealers figured out that since people can't afford cars outright anyway.. charging a premium of interest for the privilege of buying something you can't afford anyway disgruntles would-be customers.. and have dropped the requirement (0% financing).   In short, money does not dictate growth... people do. Money has fallen into a "low-pressure" area in the world, where people make less money, companies make less money, and things cost less money, but that also means life requires less money overall. Even though programmers were making $120,000 / year in 1999 on average.. going to Europe cost $4,000 a passenger for a package. Now programmers are lucky to get $50,000 a year, but going to Europe cost about $200.00 a passenger. A company doesn't grow 10% every six months, but R&D cost don't increase 10% every six months either, and the beat goes on.  It's best to think of the 1999 - 2001 period as an engine shifting into another gear... the RPMs shot up... but after you shift you go just as fast without the same RPMs... and in fact you increase slower.. this analogy does work if you replace RPMs with money supply and profits.  This has still to be figured out by an entire society that believes money is the root of all economic judgment, not concrete growth of products and services. We see a NASDAQ at 60% loss over a 5 year period and we assume we've lost 60% of our wealth.. but we haven't.. our wealth measured in real terms... comfort, efficiency, and productivity, has continued to grow.  I feel good about this business not because of the money I can take, but because of the growth I can make, and that is why you should be in business anyway... and not to play in the shell game of watching the price of money, and how much I have.

       The Business And The Bandwidth   Developing this business is a lot of work. Of course this statement is obvious, but I never imagined even with all the other technology that I had it would still be so difficult. I have made signifigant strides in developing the business plan and of course the needed powerpoint presentation, and we have some clients already lined up. Still since I am so use to having the resources available at any time I find the slow pace of progress annoying. I do marvel at some of the things Microsoft Word can do though, especially when it comes to tracking changes and adding comments when more than one person is working on a document at any given time. We have opened a SharePoint server to help with the collaboration, but my business partner has been distracted by several responsiblities as well.   However I can't help but find this process liberating. In using all of my resources in developing not just a technical but financial and management framework, I feel like I am finally using all my talents towards one goal, with one direction that cannot be changed within a matter of hours by someone above or below me. It makes even the most horrific work fun because it is my choice, my decisions, and my ideas. I don't think I could ever go back to working for someone else.  Another thing is that Brad's friends have moved in down the street, and not only do I have to put up with that but they also have a cable modem as well so they are hogging my bandwidth! Losers! As much as I love more people moving in to our fair town that is improving every minute of the day (we just put in a sitting park for people in a block that was once vacant) I can't help but think about all the craziness that will result from people living so close together. Still, maybe it will work out for the best since I am very busy and don't like people being over here as much anymore... they can all go down there instead :-D

       The Lack Of Ideas: Gore's Healthcare and the Capitalism vs. Socialism Fiasco   Diversity, any biologist will tell you, is important in any system. Although we feel ourselves superior to evolution by outpacing it substantially in the areas of genetic manipulation, immunization, and earth design, we still need to heed some lessons from the former management as we go about making better food, more evolved babies, and better infrastructure for passing through mountains. Diversity is not just the often quoted safe-guard against complete wipe-out of a species because of uniform characteristics, but also insurance that for every animal that feels it should stay in the ocean for food, there is an equally wise animal that wants to use its fins to walk on the sand.   In politics and economics, this appreciation for diversity seems to be lacking substantially. We have for several decades been stuck with the same old ideas brought up and discussed at length time and time again with the same commentary and apprehension. For many people the old debate of universal healthcare vs. private insurance is as annoying as hearing a record skip every two years. It will come as no surprise to those people that the tune is being played again, this time by the likes of Al Gore. Sensing the desire of the left to "re-define" themselves as the socialist party to cure your weary capitalist ills, he has come out in favor of a healthcare system like Canada's... a system that has caused the wealthiest among them to run to the southern border for healthcare in the United States and as a more noticeable effect caused that shocking price difference between US prices and Canadian prices when we check the back of merchandise.   What makes this situation difficult is that the problem is very much real, unlike invented problems both parties devise to sell a policy to the American people like the conservative's statement that the stock market is weak because the Capital Gains tax is too high. Healthcare in this country is an administrative nightmare, a pricey proposition, and at worst managed not by the common good or Hippocratic oath but by money... insurance money. This country has a problem with admitting the most concrete of facts because it prevents you from the possibility of "spinning" the same facts later, but the horrific concrete fact of America's healthcare system is simple: it's the best in the world because only some can get it. Our waiting lines at the doctor's office are small because the poor and out of work can't make appointments, and our pharmacies can fill prescriptions in an hour because the same people can't afford to buy their pills to lower the stock. As with any system that depends and uses the private allocation of resources for its management, it's those who can't participate in the system to the level that the private system demands who get left behind.  Many liberals feel themselves pushed into the socialist camp dictating that all but the most luxurious items should be centrally allocated to others to ensure that everyone gets the same resources and opportunity to build something from those resources. Despite the failure of Communism and the reformation of socialist welfare states in the seventies and eighties into free market economies of today, they don't have any other answer than those things that had been written about a hundred years before by Smith and Marx when the winner of the private vs. public debate had not yet been decided.   Both sides are wonderful to debate in coffee houses and universities but become devilishly in-effective when faced with an eight year old African American boy who constantly rubs his ear because he has an ear infection that no one can afford to cure, as I did when I was volunteering to read to inner city youth a few years back in Cincinnati.  It is not as if getting healthcare is a joyful experience either. You will of course get scanned, poked, analyzed, and debated about when you come in with so much as a cough at the local doctor's office, but be prepared to face the insurance companies, the health organizations, and the doctors while suffering. When managed care became a reality in the eighties, doctors were caught of guard by the demands of this beast. They began to find their administrative staff swamped with forms, their judgments called into question, and in many cases they were denied payment. To defend against this they did what any private system is expected to do: consolidate and fight back. They did just that, and now your doctor's office that you've went to for years is now under some umbrella called "The Medical Group" or "Healthcare Providers Of Some City". You don't get a bill from your doctor's office but from some billing center in another town, and your disputes are handled in another state. Doctors have set procedures and treatment regimes that must be adhered to, and are often based on the lowest common denominator that insurance companies are willing to pay for. The escalation of the arms race between these two private camps are only increasing as health care cost once again rise because of the doctor's combined pricing power against the insurance companies. If an insurance company drops one doctor's office over a billing dispute, as often was done in the past, they lose all the offices under the umbrella of the group the doctor's office is a member of. If that means twenty doctor's offices in the region, companies will drop the insurance company for one that is accepted by the health care group that resides in the same city as their employees work. The insurance companies can only respond with higher premiums, which go back to the companies, which are passed on to the employee in a small way, but mostly affect the business's ability to grow by limiting the capital it has to expand and hire more employees. For those doctor's offices that do play nice with the insurance companies, they get the added patient load from those offices dropped by the insurance companies the patient belongs to.  So, we have a problem. How do we fix it?  Canada and Britain, who have socialized healthcare, have many problems as well. This is demonstrated by an article that appeared in the National Review in response to Al Gore's proposition that America change to the Canadian system of managed healthcare. The statistics stated by Canada�s leading free-market think-tank, the Fraser Institute, are startling (italics added):   "Median waiting time for radiation treatment for breast cancer in province of Ontario: 8 weeks  Median waiting time for angioplasty in the province of British Columbia: 12 weeks  Median waiting time for radiation treatment for prostate cancer in province of Quebec: 12 weeks  Median waiting time for cataract removal in the province of Ontario: 20 weeks.  Median waiting time for cataract removal in the province of Saskatchewan: 52 weeks.  Median waiting time for a tonsillectomy in the province of Saskatchewan: 80 weeks."  - The National Review, NOV. 15, 2002: AL'S BRAINWAVE  Even more astonishing is this fact, also from The National Review (italics and boldface added):   "For the patient waiting for cancer treatment, waits mean the difference between life and death. Canada�s Cancer Advocacy Coalition reports that in Canada�s Atlantic provinces,  two cancer patients die of colon cancer for every one patient in Utah, Idaho, or Colorado, three states with ethnic makeups similar to those of eastern Canada.  Again comparing like with like, while only 6.8 of every 100,000 men in the U.S. wheat belt die of prostate cancer, 9.8 of every 100,000 men die of that disease in Canadian Saskatchewan. "  - The National Review, NOV. 15, 2002: AL'S BRAINWAVE   It is apparent that the Canadian healthcare system cannot handle the load of insuring all it's citizens, and of course because there is no private device to provide return on investment or incentive to improve efficiency for better profits by the doctors, there is very little new equipment or staff added. This is obviously not what we want to model our healthcare system after.  How do Republicans counter the socialism of the Democratic Party with something that will keep the benefits we all enjoy from a private competitive health system while solving the health management war affecting American citizens? As with all Republican solutions, we should smile broadly and increase competition further! What do I mean?   Here is the roadmap:   1) Actually acknowledge the "Healthcare Umbrella Groups" as a industry group and give them tax incentives to modernize their industry, reduce paper and become more efficient.   By reducing the cost of doing business, the industry can more easily reduce expenses passed on to the patient. This will also have the effect of allowing for quicker and better communication between the insurance companies and the healthcare industries.   2) Divorce health insurance from companies completely.. they don't pay for car insurance don't make them pay for health insurance. This will give the economy a shot in the arm that no tax cut could dream. Small businesses would flourish and businesses could get back to.. well.. doing business.   This is common sense, but requires legislation because companies couldn't make this move themselves. It would make them less competitive to other employers who would continue offering health care to employees. Companies fell into this horrible proposition of managing their employee's healthcare when HMOs came to them in the first place touting how managed care can benefit their employees with fewer sick days and preservation of their employee's income. It opened up a can of worms that has to be shut again.   3)  Force HMOs and other insurers to market to individuals.   This is going to be painful. Consolidation is necessary after this move. However the benefits are remarkable because insurers would have to create more customized products as automobile insurance companies do. This means that people could elect to only have hospital visits covered, major illnesses, or other variants of coverage depending on what a patient is willing to pay. Also, competition would increase incredibly because individuals can switch healthcare much faster than a company can insuring that prices would remain low to remain competitive. Just like someone can elect not to have an automobile insurance company pay off their lease or have higher deductibles in exchange for lower premiums, so would a healthy 20 year old elect not to have cancer coverage or elect to pay higher premiums at the doctor's office since they rarely get sick. The benefits of this are obvious. Also, CORBA could be scrapped because people's coverage would follow them from job to job, and they could calculate paying for healthcare as part of the risk of starting a new business or moving to another company, instead of this risk being a mysterious unknown to consumers.    4) Cut back coverage for individuals and make them pay for some expenses out of pocket    This goes with point 3) above, and will also cause pain initially to patients. If no healthcare insurance company covers office visits because they have become so expensive, it would force consumers to flip the bill. They would see that doctor's visits are $60.00 now instead of the $5.00 they normally pay for an office visit. They would of course, being American consumers, shop around now for a better deal. By not making the cost of healthcare "invisible" to consumers, they would understand how much healthcare cost, and would act in a more responsible measure in visiting doctors and getting services. This would force doctor's offices to actually join the private system they act like they are participating in now, and they would also become competitive vs. other doctor's offices. This would level the playing field and make consumers the same benefactors of competition as they are with shoes and computers in the open market. On other words... instead of raising prices on insurance companies and winking at us with a smile, they would raise prices on us directly, and we would not smile back.    5) Make Medicare and Child Healthcare Services state run and funded, and advertised    Believe it or not, the solution to un-insured Americans is already there. Many states have free health services to children and adults in low income brackets. Kentucky has recently started a project to increase enrollment for their children's healthcare services and have found that many people who are eligible simply do not sign their children up. As far as low to moderate income people are concerned, they could respond the way they respond when their income changes to automobile companies... they just change their services to lower their premiums. Although this will leave them without full coverage, the consumer can weigh the risks of having this coverage and seek ways of improving their earning power and receive more services as their income increases. This is much better than the "all or none" health insurance system we have now.  The private insurance industry now is small and expensive for individuals. Getting insurance away from companies involves many health tests, exams, and paper work hassles. By implementing this new idea and making the healthcare industry more competitive, we can finally back out of the current mess and use the tried and true private model for healthcare, as well as ensure that cost are low for those whom the state must provide care for. Simple, elegant, and not the same resistant ideas we get from both the Republican and Democratic sides.  What do you think?

        A Rose By Any Other Name Is As Sweet, But Not The Recollection Of it    I re-open my blog after many months of starting a business with something heavy on my heart.  My grandfather. Or more to the point, his name. My grandfather was a hard working humble man who began his career after WWII in a partnership he created with a friend called W&E welding, although by all accounts it was he who was the mantle. Throughout the area where I live his name was known, from politicians to judges to everyone in the city where I grew up. He was respected, admired, and through his wife's enterprising spurs owned most of the Kentucky side of the riverbank from the 1960's to the 1970's. He was a businessman who wished to die with his work cloths on, which he did in 1989. In all of this the name Werner took on meaning. My father enjoyed it with bank loans and recognition wherever he went in his young life. I was vaguely aware of it when I was a kid, up until my grandfather's death.  My grandmother did not take it well, and infact sold all the property they owned, raced horses for a long time, kept horses on a farm, and retreated to the traveling life living in Florida and Ohio until her stroke, and now she lives in Ohio fighting back from complete right side paralysis to being able to walk, drive, and have a regular life. No one expected less.  Over the years the Werner name has disappeared with my grandfather. My own father did not take over the business but instead went to work for other people. My uncle took over the company for awhile but it went bankrupt and was sold to various holding companies over the years. And so it was.  Understandably, most can't relate to being related to someone well known but dead. How it haunts you and works for you or against you in a million ways you'll never see. In many ways it is as if he is a ghost who works behind the scenes like a Catholic saint, interceding on my behalf, on my father's behalf, and my brother's.. of which this story relates.  Last night my brother got in trouble with the law, as young men often do for various reasons, and had to appear before a judge. My parents, caring and concerned to the end, were there with him with checkbook in hand, heart in throat, not knowing what to expect. The judge, after reviewing the information, mentioned out of the blue that he knew my brother's grandfather, and because of that gave my brother a very reduced sentence. My grandfather once again... the ghost... interceded on our behalf.. chucking in the corner of the court room, unobserved but known.  I write about this because I just started a business of my own because I want to emulate my grandfather. He understood that the simple task of working for yourself, building your own thing, no matter how small or how successful, was the only way to work. It could be an independent streak in our genes, I never had any success working for other people, or even doing school work for that matter. During math class I would be in the bathroom reading Emerson's Oversoul as if I was the sole possessor of it's wisdom. In 8th grade I was reading Steven Hawking's A Brief History of Time and drawing time expansion cylinders on the back of my biology tests. In 10th grade I wrote a poem about my Spanish teacher's son, who had recently been arrested, on all the blank lines meant for translations.   I'm sure he laughs at all of this. I'm sure he tucks me in at night. I'm sure he advises me when I pace the room not knowing what to do. He's there, he's here, and his help never fails to reach us. It is as if his name was stored capital, which he never used but passed on to us, who use it often.  A name still means so much. Don't fall for the fact that we are in a large world where the only way we can remember our cousin's name is through our PDA or our mother's through our cellphone. It still matters, what you do still matters, who you are... still matters.  I want to buy my grandfather's business back. I want it to be back in the family.. as a tribute to him, to what he built... a huge factory of re-inforced concrete with tasteful brick and green bushes... what we all refer to fondly as "the shop". Sometimes, before it was sold, my Dad would go in there and sit down in the old broken in chair by the old beat up desk and think of his Dad. He'd smell that stale metallic smell of steel chips and burned iron that hung in the air. The old machines that laid dorment, the single light in the far corner.. humming with electricity. My Dad would sit there.. and in the complete silence feel him. Sometimes he cried, and we all knew why. After he'd get done with the smells and the stillness and the dark... he'd get up, leave the chair in a cascade of squeeks, take the single bolt from the door and lock it in place... and walk away in silence.   What he didn't know was that my grandfather always followed him out. It was not the business that he loved, and today, like everyday... proves that.

        Excited About Hostway    If you have a website, and you don't use  urlLink Hostway ... you don't really have a website. We started using Hostway as a reseller for  urlLink The Planning Studio  when we had to have a Windows 2000 server with ASP.net to deploy our server side webservices for clients. Needless to say I have been blown away... so much so that I have decided to buy their product personally, for myself. So as of right now kidventus.com is being hosted on Hostway, with full ASP.net, SQL Server, and even Sharepoint services. Which means that since I can actually execute ASP.net on this website, I can now do some freakin amazing things, and I can't wait to get to it. This website had been hosted on the horrible Earthlink servers, which even though it's only HTML... they did offer Urchin for free. However they had lost my account in 2001 and I've been simply posting and publishing to their servers for a good two years now bill free. However at this point time is moving on and I need more than HTML served up dryly. Imagine a host provider so good you go from free services to a pay service just for the love of a product! But it is so...So you should be seeing some changes on the way... like there hasn't been enough already! Check out the waybackmachine to see how  urlLink crappy this site use to look all the way back from 2001 forward . I like the changes I made, and the blue is much nicer than that god aweful blue & red neon thing I was doing.. what's up with that?  Over on my development blog I have begun talking about the process of developing Fatima and the TPS.net webSuite, the latter already developed the former still being written. Although I do plan on publishing a lot of the code I write for Fatima to inspire duplicators and dreamers, I will in no way be allowing unrestricted access to the code that I am using to fund a company, so that is that. Also, Vesuvius, the P2P .Net code many of you know from this site... has been folded into Fatima and will be used for P2P file transfer and conversations within the business software.  So, that's the update for today. It's great to have a good provider.

      Really most people get depressed thinking it's all chemicals.. I do... we want everything to mean more... we invent something we can't understand so we can grasp at it and look longingly at the mystery of it.. ofcourse our attitude would change if we found out god was a chemical instead of a spirit.. maybe to the pickle the pickle juice is the universe.. and the pickle thinks it's holy.

        The End Of Capitalism At The Hands of Fools, And Our Parents Are To Blame    I'm getting pretty sick of the socialist tendencies in the youth of my age. The technocratic youth. The same face appeared in the 60s of course, but there was no real way to practice what was preached on the hill tops back then. No matter how hard the children of love might have fought, in any town they still had to shell out their money for the pack of Zig-Zag's regardless of their ideals. There was never any debate on the merits of their case, and the strength and weakness of capitalism was never really discussed, just whined about repeatedly. Because they had no choice but to participate in the system in which their country was made subject, they later could grow up and out of their haze of utopia and maybe even learn of the real merits and detriments of the system of capitalism.  So here we are in the 21st century, the confines of knowledge to paper and ink are broken, and for the first time people are reacting in shock that the book publisher and the music publisher charges not just what it cost to make the medium, but actually make profits, good profits, and that the vast majority of the CD you paid $19.99 for goes into the pockets of the record company who pay only 10 cents or less to make it. Perhaps it was the way the companies tried to market themselves over the years.. as selfless lovers of art and media who paid tons of money for our benefit, and can stay afloat only barely by their efforts. They were many little Gutenbergs who were printing the bible merely for religious purposes, and whatever was left over was good for society because they could print more for the common good. Now the words and the music has separated from the page and moved to the ether.. but they still want to get paid... as much as if it had never evaporated out of their copyrighted hands.  Now the battle really occurs. Now those poor souls whom parent's allowances forgot don't have to yearn for a world where their favorite movies, music, and videos they so lusted after would be free... it is... and will continue to be.. and the only thing that still cost anything are the Zig Zags. Unfortunately for the companies, who feel their customers should be dealt with the same way a bad corporate actor should, they've taken out a large charge on their future profits by suing those whom in their late 20's and 30's will actually provide those profits. Meanwhile those who felt even the smallest sense of guilt by their actions are emboldened...and the only ones who actually pay for music anymore are those who do not have a broadband connection, or for some ethical reason choose to shell out the money.  Add to this the technocratic youth's love of Linux and all things free on the software side as well. Although it is true that a few hardened computer lovers in their 30s and 40s are the backbone of the current effort in this area, they serve merely as the foundation to the large amount of work being done by the younger generation who grew up with Microsoft Windows. They write programs which actually adds the functionality and productivity to what would otherwise be, and was for most of the older generation's time, an empty shell prompt. If you enjoy software from Microsoft, you can steal that as well. 1 out of every 3 households has an unpaid for version of Office 97 or 2000 on their laptops or desktops. Again, for broadband connections, and the extension of P2P networks to share not only music but software and videos, this is a simple task.  Many in the world cheer this effort. Carelessly unconcerned about the outcome, they are inspired by the mere upset it causes in the system which relied on money flowing out of the their pockets. In this they can most certainly be smug.. they slammed the window on many a company's fingers. Some companies have been shaken out of their world view, and choose to compete on the scale of "you pay what you get for" and offer higher quality music or more reliable services. This however proves to be a chasing after the wind.. if the technocratic youth don't invent a better way without you (i.e. ogg format replacing MP3, although WMP is superior) eventually the quality of all video and audio will approach the point where continual improvement will yield little upgrade value (i.e. SVGA's 1.4 million colors on a video card in the 90's was more colors than the human eye could distinguish, hence that stopped being an upgrade factor). Also, even if the playback functionality is enhanced (greater storage, better video player) the content itself will not need to be remastered, and if it does, the same problems noted above apply.  This seems rather ominous for those of us who write and those of "them" that publish it. However this free society is already extending to software, games, movies, and videos and will most likely extend to any non-manufactured or agricultural good. What are the consequences of this? Don't care? Don't worry, it's not your fault, it's your education.  For too long we've been of the mindset that if we can get something for free... we should, because the next thing will still cost money.  It's been the lesson we've gotten from our grandparents and they've gotten from their grandparents... there is no such thing as a free lunch... not that there shouldn't be a free lunch... only that there isn't. Most of our lessons about money preach to the avoidance or minimizing of the sale. Even the latest Sam Adams ad states "There's never a bad time for a Sam Adams.. especially if it's on someone else's tab"  There is a feeling in this country that money is evil, that the effects of money are cruel, and that the whole system of capitalism is corrupt and corrupting. It is hard to dispute this if you take the most visible and lauded example of capitalism, the stock market or more to the point capital markets. In the grand scheme of capitalism, the market in which people are permitted to give capital to businesses on an open market is a small example. However when people see the money made and lost in the capital markets, they form their opinions on the whole system based on a bad stepchild. The capital markets are indeed a very seedy and probably done for environment for capitalism, particularly now a days when the money in the market is corporate or institutional money that just bounces around the market to up sectors and out of down sectors. The 8500 limit will never again be broken if new money does not flow in.  However none of this is representative of capitalism, and we have never been educated as to why America uses capitalism to ensure democracy. No one in high school or college except for business majors.. if then.. are educated as to why we've picked this system, why Adam Smith wrote what he did, and the rebuttal by Karl Marx that relied too heavily on the idea of a manufacturing economy with a constant slum working lower class. No one ever educates the citizen about the freedom money provides, how each dollar is a vote you cast towards the companies and services of your choice.. and that through your vote casting you determine the fate of the area and the country in which you live. No one is educated as to the errors throughout history of central planning or the wisdom of the free enterprise operating outside government control and distribution limits. We believe capitalism to be a burden placed on us, not a wise system which places power in the hands of the individuals and through freedom of choice and comparison in an open market always pushes the wealth of all upwards. There are abuses. Like any resource... where money pools it erodes what is around it.. including character and wisdom.   However we must realize the merits of capitalism, and be educated in classes as early as eigth grade not just how to do accounting.. but why we do accounting... why we use money at all. We are finally approaching a point where we must each willfully decide to participate in the system, because it raises all boats. Your job at the butcher shop can be threatened if you download all your music for free and your best customer, the record company executive, loses his job and no longer shows up every Sunday. The butcher shop could close, no one goes to that street anymore... and the flower shop down the street closes. It's that easy to tip the dominos, that easy to crash the system. Of course many companies are destroyed by "Creative destruction".. Adam Smith's house keeping term for those whose businesses are outpaced and un-used (i.e. typewriter maker Brother), if they don't get a federal bail-out or trade tariffs in their favor like the steel makers got recently from the Bush administration. However in this case the products in question are still in demand, quite high demand, that's why the P2P networks were created in the first place. There isn't a great market for sharing typewriters. That is why the tired argument of "creative destruction" as it pertains to content providers and any and all copyright holders is wrong.  People make fun of me repeatedly for paying $9.95 / month for  urlLink Pressplay  to download unlimited music and even burn and transfer to my pocket pc for about $1.00 a song (for only the songs I choose are good enough to put down to that format). They also make fun of me purchasing ebooks on  urlLink PeanutPress  for my Pocket PC, and actually keeping a paper trail about my software licenses. I even paid for Adobe Photoshop and Norton Anti-Virus, two of the most downloaded programs on the P2P network. The reason is simple... running a business I cannot ask that someone pay me to do something or to create software when I don't bestow the same courtesy to them or their peers. The same is true of any employees who take money from their employer for services done, or any student who is using their parent's money to go to college.   The idea of the abstraction of money from the quality of life Americans enjoy must stop. It will not be the promised utopia to eliminate paying for services in the future, it will be our undoing.

       Interesting Data (Sidebar)   I have always been a fan of the raw. There is nothing more democratic than raw. In this age when everyone in the "pop" newsmedia thinks they need to   interperate   the news for you, having the actual raw data in front of you is the only way you can be sure they aren't rolling the ball to the left or right gutter. Sadly it is hard to find raw footage of war.. raw footage of conversations diplomats have, and raw data about trends that aren't cut up and digested before hand by the media and then vomited out in 30 second segments for us to feed on.. and be damn glad we have it too....  However the   New York Times   posted all their New York Times, CBS News Poll data from 1998 and something 1990- on in an interactive area that is very revealing. If you want a truly "brain wrinkling" insightful experience,  urlLink you should check it out here .  What I want to talk about is the data on the economy as reproduced without permission here:  7. How would you rate the condition of the national economy these days? Is it very good, fairly good, fairly bad or very bad?   * note: this is a pre-XML world... I can't copy / paste the data... sowwy.... visit the link to get to it.  As you can tell... the most interesting comparison is between the Bush boys!  Go to the site and compare... we are very optimistic through this downturn un-like Bush Sr's term. Is the Dem's "It's the economy stupid" mantra not gonna work?  - Brandon

      OK, it would appear that we have a blog ring forming here... so I will make with the links to the other sites. Although I am often more an essay blogger every week or so for two pages at a time, I still enjoy everyone visiting! Have fun, and make sure you check out Josh's new blog at  urlLink Cricketboy , and also if you want to read some of my published literature visit the literature section above!

      Terrorism, Tobacco, and me.   I have efforted a blog entry despite my busy schedule because I have been watching urlLink  Josh's blog  with envy. It is about Josh, much to his surprise, which I wish to speak about. It is not so much him as it is his very admirable internationalism. He is as I was, a staunch believer in one world with all countries having an equal say in how the earth is governed and ruled. A fulfillment of the charter of the United Nations; a return to the understanding after WWII that no more world wars were to begin, or for that matter no wars at all. However so often in humanity's history the reasons and ethics that brought about the organization are forgotten, like a sharp wind that took the boat out to sea, and now everyone wonders how it got here and why it's stationary. No more vision, no more reason, no more momentum. So the institution sits on the surface, void and without meaning. The League of Nations revisited.   When I was over his apartment recently I saw on his bed a huge banner with the logo of the United Nations on it, and in front of it the dove of peace. I didn't remark on it since it was late and I didn't want to get in to a fight, but my reaction as much as a year ago would have been respect and hope. Now it is just sadness. We have a UN that has Iran heading it's nuclear disarmament commission, and Syria the head of the human rights commission. We have an institution that while  urlLink Zimbabwe grandmothers are being raped  by the barrels of the guns of rebels and Africans dying of AIDS at the blind eye of their governments is sitting back arguing semantics with the super power, as if it's sole charter is to contain us. How much more would this institution be respected if it spent it's time focusing on real issues in the world, fulfilling it's charter regardless of the super power, and thus showing us the asses we are by pointing to the world and crying out "terrorism is the dragons hatched from the womb of this, and you go cutting off their heads while leaving the earth in labor pains!".   Such is the reality, and such is it being ignored.   The United Nations cannot do this because it has rotted inside and out. It is stung with corruption all the way up to Mr. Koffi Annan with the oil for food programme, with tons of money being diverted into the coffers of Russia, France, and the UN. Just like the old Andrew Lloyd Webber song from Evita "when the money keeps rolling in you don't keep books, you can tell success from their happy grateful looks." It has also become as obsessed with the United States as Canada has been, choosing to respond to ever whim of our fancy instead of pressing on without it's super power enforcer. Also,  urlLink the massacres that have followed the peace keepers  in Bosnia and other places have cast doubt on it's ability to manage even the most common evils of the world, and it being kept out of Iraq and Afghanistan is no surprise.    So, with this in mind Josh would be better served hanging up a poster of the Power Puff Girls. Sadly the war on terrorism has been the undoing and exposing of an organization that has been in the throws of death ever since the cold war ended, such as NATO has. Although it is easy to see NATO becoming the military of the European Union, the United Nations has no such future savior. With nothing to limit America's power, and it's feverent nationalism hawking at any restrictions on it's "sovereign" rights, and the Arab world self-destructing itself just to spite America, and the continued American support for Israeli occupation of Palestine... there is no hope for the League of Nations but to sit around and debate about laws that will have no action, ideals that will find no expression.   What should be clear is that the "war on terror" is not some fantasy created by America as many suggest. It is infact a real threat as evidenced in the recent bombings in Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Israel. When we look over the world and the infection is hiding in the pours of civil society it is easy to cast doubt on the harsh cure needed and being administered, but when it comes up and reveals itself the need for the cure becomes paramount. This is indeed truly a war against extremism. Yes, it is being handled poorly, yes we are not restricting fossil fuels or changing behavior, yes we are trying to cure the disease without changing our diet, and yes it's because of the Republican administration currently in power. However that does not change the reality of threat.   What has happened is simple. In all of history there has been those whom refuse to move forward with the rest of humanity, the "conservatives".. whether here or in other countries.. continue to feel disconnected and rely on old world mythology such as Christianity or Judaism  or Hindu, anything to justify not only their beliefs in a non-changing world where the past is kept alive, but where it can be revived lest the mythological creatures be angry. They use these mythological creatures to justify their hate, and invoke these Gods as bad actors and speak through their mouths. The Catholic church did it, and now the mosques are doing it. Anyone that has seen anti-abortionist rant and rave, or the Faldwell's cry out about homosexuality and pre-marital sex and how God will come to establish a new Jerusalem with his own rules.. can appreciate how fundamentalism is closer to home than we realize.    However we have not realized that this is a fight both at home and abroad.. against religion and the idea of Gods from the first century telling us how to run our lives. In reality, this is exactly what the fight is about. It's a fight against secularism and conservatives. Against the world moving forward and it moving backward. Or to put it in the rhythmical stance of  urlLink Jeanette Winterson in  Art & Lies   "How Shall I Live?".  It's not surprising that the world has fallen apart over this issue, and that surprisingly the WASPs (White Anglo-Saxton Protestants) of the United States are not the best suited to deal with this fight even though they have the biggest guns. Better a more secular Britain, who has been the empire America is and learned how to deal with the world. However one thing is certain: While the war rages, there will be no peace, and there will be no identifiable UN.   There are the useful sub-heads of the UN though, namely the World Health Organization. They have put out a global statement and fight on Tobacco products which includes large taxes, bans of advertising, and other issues related to tobacco use. What is more shocking is that the fiercely pro-tobacco administration in America  urlLink has decided to sign on to the treaty ! This puts me as a tobacco user in an even sorrier bunch. Now not only am I ignoring the research, the doctors, and the pictures of black lungs, now the entire planet earth is telling me to stop. I have pledged that being a good international citizen of what I hope to be a good world, I will stop smoking. It is probably just the fact that I would like to tell my kids that I followed the first completely health related treaty ever issued on the planet from all the governments of the planet, and that I listened to the call of the UN and did my part by living to be 120 years old.  Oh, for a better understanding and statement of the problems with the UN beyond my poor ability, check out the INCREDIBLE Letters To America segment on the BBC,  urlLink and particularly this archived one.   Cheers!

       Good Morning.   A few things to take care of:   1) Why would you put a Java logo on your website if you think "Java is dead"      Microsoft is playing dirty by not including Java in their downloads, even an unmodified version. I understand they don't include Macromedia or any other third party tool, but they started with Java from the start. The only reason is to focus customers on their .Net framework. Fine, but I at least want to draw attention to the language that is running on 100 million cell phones and smart cards. I might even have to take back the "Java is dead" comment and instead say "Java is .clone()ing" because their recent shows on JavaOne show them basically ripping off the Web Forms in Microsoft .Net with Java Server Faces and a new IDE that allows you to "drag and drop" database connections to a "web form" to create server side dynamic content... sound familar?  ...and it even has partial page refresh.... what a complete rip off. Any Java people who complained C# was a rip-off of Java (and it is) should have had their mouths shut when they saw the "Rave" demo at JavaOne. To see these demonstrations,  urlLink go here  and click on the video for "Rich Green".   Also, check our Java's  urlLink new customer focused site .   2) Your company's website changed from planningstudio.com to theplanningstudio.com and now someone else is using planningstudio.com?   Yes, and I really couldn't help that. Sean and the company have split ways and he took the domain name back and made some non-profit called "the planning studio" which would be difficult to incorporate since we are a foreign corp in Ohio and have the name. Regardless I'm sure there is enough room in America for two Planning Studio's and I wish him luck in his urban planning focused website. Ofcourse the quality shows the fact he is a one man show, and he did not put a link to the new domain for his old job, but all our clients have been updated on the change so I doubt someone will visit the old domain and think it's the company instead of an amature site. Ahhh... you got to love the inevitable sifting of people so you know you got the right people on the bus. Some people go along the way, as they have, but the business is always stronger.   3) Is Morgan Tsvangirai going to die by Mugabe's hands?   Not unless he wants this white boy in Zimbabwe. I had high hopes for the rebellion that was planned, but it went poorly out of fear. No one in the world is making a peep as usual. * sigh *

      Talk about neat  that espresso machine has a lot of pressure    I goofed on it  I opened up the canister handle thingy when I accedentially left the power on  I heard a swosh that reminded me of something that happened I never told you  When I was at Cov Cath, a freshman, the librarian gave me the job of changing the laser printer cartridge in the library.... so I said I knew how to do it being smug and saw it said "remove film here".. so I did... and there was this wonderful peaceful swooosh sound like snow if it fell all at once... within one second the whole room was black as night.. you could only make me out because of the white teeth of my sheepish grin  It was like that... I heard the powder "swooosh" and the coffee inside was gone... it took me 5 minutes to find the pile of it on the corner of the kitchen.. it shot so far so fast I didn't see it.. just "swooosh" "poof".. and gone  Alley McBeal is kewl on FX, the old episodes before Kelley ran out of ideas. It's kind of a reminder of how peaceful and liberal and nice things were in the late 90's. So much worry free money making economic engine running nuffin to worry about except your own narcassistic life because you have money, job, cell phone, and life world.  I miss it.  Has anyone thought about group conseling for the United States? We're acting out like we need therapy... we're killing people, lying, cheating, disagreeing with each other, becoming more extreme and dillusional and paranoid of the rest of the world.  We need help, like Alley did. I don't recommend Tracey Ulman as the psychologist though.  We all want better times, but we don't blaim Bush because that's just transferance and we learned not to do that in the 80's.  Things are getting better. Try to feel as hip and hopeful as you were circa 1999. That's all it'll take. Drink coffee, buy the latest cell phone, take a ride on that old silver scooter you paid too much for and submit resumes....

      I know, the looks have changed but the content is mostly the same. What would you have me do? Have you even checked out my company's website? We've been VERY busy and I've been doing mostly work related stuff. Yes, I know that it's a shame since I enjoyed writing in my blog so much.   However you have to do what you can to make the daily bread. Besides, with all my great literature already sitting out there on the web I think you can stand a few months without me around can't you? ;-)  And there are better things to read than me too. For instance, there is a great blog from a  urlLink guy in the army over in Iraq . He tells it like it is, and how he gets away with it despite the Pentigon PR machine is beyond me. He has gotten a lot of hits lately because the Bagdad blogger himself,  urlLink Pax , has linked to it and said he also is an avid reader.  To be fair, the soldier blogging is young and therefore disillusioned and liberal, not believing the US should be there. Any hawks that have been spoiled by the Dixie Chicks incident in to thinking that they can simply bash in and make disappear any protesting of their evil empire taking over the planet shouldn't read this... it proves what everyone knows when seeing the UN bombing and the bombing of Muslim clerics all over the world.  Your desire for a holy empire of America has fallen to ashes, you killed young American lives in your own selfish interest of Americanizing the world.. to turn them with the guns that your cronies in Congress has been lobbing so hard for these last few years.  Nothing is adiquate in the condemnation of the right wing of this country, except to say that the blood of those 103 Iraqis in the cleric bombing, the casualities of the UN bodies, and all those young americans are on your hands.  You may be able to silence the cries on this planet with your press briefings and your Fox News, but God has no such weakness of attention span, and I pray you will be punished.  On a lighter note I got a new picture cell phone! Go capitalism!

        The Arab, the CIA, and the future    Yes, when you see a title like that you know that it's going to be a long blog session, but I doubt it will come to that.  I was chatting with one of my friends from Lebanon when his bad english and my bad english started annoying me. Finally, having decided to put forth some effort in to the situation, I went to Google, the oracle of planet earth, and typed in "Arabic translation". First search result was a winner, because it was Google, (p.s. if you type in Bruce Werner in Google I'm number 1, so there you go) and I was brought to an  urlLink Arabic to English and vice-versa online site .  This was a little shocking because I thought the limit of our on-the-fly translation on the web were spanish, french, and german. However I found out that technology has indeed progressed to the point where I can type english, and he can read Arabic. From his conversation, I could tell what I typed was exactly what I got... and he instantly opened up whole paragraphs of conversation in Arabic as if the tower of Babel had never been destroyed and we were all one happy human family.  Which got me thinking...  1) How long will it take writing arabic in an MSN chat window before Aschcroft pays me a visit? 2) How stupid is it to learn a foreign language in 10 years if all our PDAs and phones will be able to instantly translate voice and text? (IBM, good ol' IBM) 3) What type of planet will it be when the language barrier is broken indefintely? 4) Will God, or gods, or various religious wackos who believe in God, fear that with the tower of Babel rebuilt as it were, we are gonna be punished?  Really, to be flip about the incredible experience I had with my Lebanon friend is under-selling the incredible earth changing effect this will have on humanity. It truly is the rebuilding of the Babel tower, in defiance of God's will in myth, and the creation of a human family that will have the barriers broken and open dialogue truly open.   As  urlLink Lambert Dolphin puts it in  his great but ultimately confusing piece on the Tower of Babel:   However, the heart of the matter is made clear in these words, "let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth." Already a haunting fear had set in. They were conscious already of a disruptive influence in their midst, of a centrifugal force that was pushing them apart so they could not live too closely together and which would ultimately, they feared, scatter them abroad and leave them unknown, unhonored, and unsung, living in isolated communities where they would be exposed to great danger. The fear of this caused them to build a tower and a city. The ultimate motive is expressed in these words, "let us make a name for ourselves."   Are we now to "make a name for ourselves" as a human culture?  Don't think "we've had that at the UN and in government for hundreds of years". Because as we all know, the world doesn't change at those places, it is only reflected in those places. The world changes here.. with us.. with millions of people talking and sharing their lives, and wanting to be a part of other lives. It's a remarkable thing what the future will hold for us. If we can talk to and understand Arabs, Indians, and Chinease without the need of them or us to have several years of language education, what would that do? Maybe the Indian who got the telemarketing job that moved from US will tell us on a small chat room how happy he is he can feed his family well... maybe the Arab will discuss how horrible it is to have to be afraid to step out their door or having their hosues demolished in Palastine in an instant messaging window. All of this will reach out where experience is personal and not just some image flashing across the screen of BBC World News.  I know there are unreasonable and warped people in the world, whom you can live just down the street from and whom will always be defensive, combative, and mean. I know there are people who take pleasure in being witty to one's detrement, sharp to increase one's wound, and who will retire with their social group to congradulate themselves. We need not witness or reflect on the mis-understandings and cycle of violence in Isreal and elsewhere to understand how weak un-educated humanity can be, we need only look to our neighbors at times.  However by breaking down one more barrier in our lives, we can more easily hope that shows of amature and childish behavior, of unthoughtful action based mearly on the idea of inflicting wounds, and the tendency to re-inforce positions with un-yeilding hard-headedness and ignorance will be eliminated.  We may still dis-like some of our neighbor's behavior, but at least we can count more of them as such.

       Slate's awesome Post 9-11 commentary    You should read this article in Slate (posted on MSNBC) about how Bush squandered the sentiment after 9/11. I don't know how far the Arabs would have went in squashing terrorism, but I do know one thing... I wish we could go back to that time and create a world of peace instead of one of confrontation.   Generation Y, which I am a member (began 1979... all computers, all cell phone all the time), has grown up with a reset button and a "back button" not to mention an auto-restore feature in our software, redial, you name it. Almost everything we do or don't do can be fixed, forgiven, opportunity re-taken, re-trimmed, whatever.   We don't think there is any path we can't do a U-turn and take. Unfortunately, this world and this country under the love and brotherhood of Europe and Asia fighting a common enemy with care and dedication after 9/11, a more unified world in tragity coming together in new ways.. the nation coming together in new ways, not so polerized in the 50/50 split of the 2000 election, that world we will never know.    When will people learn this is the world neo-conservatives want? You want Republican meca? No jobs, tax cuts for the wealthy, war mongering go-it-alone country.. no UN, no international diplomacy, we are AMERICA.. we are the super-power. We are the power at which the rest of these poor socialist and communist countries who don't let their poor fend for themsleves can't hope to compare. We are the ones that spend more on defense than education.. (ensuring our dumb future generation will have to spend more on defense than education)... this is our Republican hope.. we don't need no international troops, we don't need no UN consensus, we'll do what we want... Sean Hannidy and Rush Limbaugh on ALL the radio stations telling us what the truth is.. NPR will just do programs on African quilts... no left voice.. your a traitor if you disagree... Rush will beat you down. Oh, don't get Rush on your radio? We'll roll back the media ownership rules so Rupert Murdock can own more radio stations... push the voice far and wide.. FOX news on your cell phone, PDA, computer screen, TV, molars... with their American Flag lepal pin. It's all ok.. America is a victorious Christian theocracy... we are the Empire... it is our destiny.  I think this has ended the conservativism for a while, Al Frankin is all over the TV.. that's always a good sign. Iraq and the budget and the economy has reminded people of last time Republicans were in office. I think after this second time in Republican hell, people will never do this again.. no matter how many Rush Limbaughs try to bring us lies.

       When You're Finally Working   One of the weird things you are not prepared for when you start a business is the quasi-working state. In a regular business the preparation for work means getting coffee and looking at your task list for the day. When you start your own business preparation for work takes a year. Routine is hard to come by, and the idea of a stable work routine in which you have a set group of people to talk to, a set group of tasks to accomplish, and a set group of things you should do to impress people is gone.  You get in to such a dizzing array of accounting issues, filing, paperwork, organizing, digitizing, sales, marketing, registering, joining, networking, developing, thinking, planning, typing, planning, typing, planning, typing, backspacing.. ect. that you forget what it was to have a boss and a set thing you do.  "Hi, I am a banker".... "Hi, I am a developer"... "Hi, I'm a business owner.. how do you get away with only doing that one thing all the time?"  It gets to the point where you forget what work is like.  A few days ago I was answering my phone, delivering things to other people to do, talking with clients and discussing their issues, working on those issues with people, calling them back.. when it dawned on me all of a sudden:   I think... I think I'm working...  I.. I am working... I'm doing regular stuff now...  Well.. I guess... I guess I'll keep doing this then...  Only another small business owner will understand the graduation that occurs, but it is a graduation beyond that of high school or college. On your mere efforts alone... you planned, built, and launched (by running and pushing it for miles to get it going) a ship.   You have taxes setup, incorporation articles filed and humming, foreign corporations in states filed, by-laws written and signed, bank accounts setup and funded, Dun & Bradstreet registered, professional associations funded, automated accounting systems, automated payroll systems, business plan done and forgotten, marketing out the door, telephone system setup, first projects done, website done, client aquisition and customer relationship management software and practices installed and established, clients and business contacts putting wind in your sales (you'd be amazed how people really want to help you, the idea of a cut throat business world is just not true except maybe in the top pages of the Wall Street Journal), and even a BusinessWire account for releasing your news.  Now you're finally on the seas and you get to steer it and do boat type stuff.. with your own boat..  It's launched, you're on your way.. you could wreck... but you'd be wrecking your boat.. you have a boat.. that you built... no one can take that away.  Now it's all staffing. I have a few senior officers in Boston, and a few ship mates, but the boat is pretty empty all the same. Some people hop on board, check the ropes, suggest a few things, and then hop back on their own boats and leave...  Too many chiefs and not enough indians.   SIDEBAR: There are foreign nationals at GE that use to say that to me with more than a smug look on their face. It really is funny when an Indian says it, because it's a commentary on the current global work environment, corporate overseas staffing and American managerial desire all rolled up in to one small sentence, under-stated. Priceless.)  Well, back to work... finally.

         Back in 1998 when I worked for Convergys the secretary Heather Russel once said that when I was a baby I must have been Stewey. I always took that as a compliment. My brother got this for me at "Hot Topic" yesterday. I put it on my work desk just to show I haven't lost touch with my roots. LOL!  Sanyo 8100 picture phone, quality sucks but what do you expect?

      Ahh the joys of the approaching Spring, the corporate tax month, and the end of the 1st quarter.  All in all, although it doesn't feel like it, this has been the most successful 1st quarter to date for the company. Still, with so much work, staffing issues, and personal turmoil I can't be as excited as I should be.  Also I am a little concerned about the business sentiment out there. According to the Wall Street Journal, it's falling again. Amazing how when I was just a cog in the works I would read those numbers with no real point of reference. However now that I am in the thick of most of the Cincinnati, Nashville, and Memphis business areas (Sean runs the North) I can tell you I really do feel it. We're in Neutral again. Back in January when business confidence was surging, I felt that too. It's like some kind of current that moves in and then goes back out. One month you can't print the contracts fast enough, the next month it all evaporates.  It's hard to say why. Starting this company in the end of 2001, I really can't say I've ever experienced a "good" economy. Sometimes I fantasize about what it will be like. Will I have to work so hard for sales? Will I have to spend so much on advertising? Will I be able to expand even farther south? Will life not be so seemingly hard and nail biting and hectic? Will it be like January, but all the time?  These thoughts make me smile, until I quickly remember how un-likely it is. We're probably going to be a good three or four years before there is a definite "trend" pointing up... the winds are blowing all directions any given day... no one knows when it will decide which way to blow. Reading the Wall Street Journal is a lesson in watching the weather vane too closely during this time. "Consumer Confidence Down", "Manufacturing Up", "Job Loss Continues", "Businesses Optimistic", "2nd Quarter Growth Will Be Slower", "Hiring will take off in 3rd quarter"... ect...  For me, I know now what is bull and what isn't. Jobs? No one knows. No one can say. Well, I can say "Yes, I expect to hire 10 people in September.... just as long as I get all the deals I expect, nothing goes wrong, the economy improves, and we have two weeks of fair weather in July". In other words, I don't know. No one does.  However the confidence you feel. I don't know how, but you do. When you meet with other CEOs, when you talk about potential projects, even when you look in on how clients are talking to your project managers.. the urgency, or lack of it, the demeanor... it all goes in to the emotional processor in the back of your mind.. the constantly on, constantly calculating "this is the universe at this moment" calculation we all do.   There is a neat theory about depression I heard. It seems that this calculator is constantly assessing your situation. Imagine you're a sheep. You are in green fields... you are happy, you reproduce, run around, and stay healthy. It turns in to desert. Your brain makes you depressed, so you don't feel like reproducing (no shelter for offspring), you don't feel like frolicking around and wasting energy (no grass) and because you feel so bad you feel the urgency to move on. You walk miles. Now it's still desert and no water in sight. Your brain makes the calculation "am I better off now than I was before?". The answer is no. You keep walking.. the terrain gets worse. You don't feel like reproducing, frolicking to waste energy, or doing daring things... your situation is bad.. your brain makes you feel miserable to push you to keep walking for those greener pastures... none show up... your brain decides you are in a famine, there is no hope.. you just sit in the desert, so miserable you don't feel like moving.. you die. Nature is happy. If you found greener pastures, you'd make the calculation, know your doing progressively better, and stay put, or reproduce, or start a sweater business. Your depression would leave, because your ok. Plain and simple. Biology.  This has evolved in us. We constantly evaluate. That's also why when we get laid off, or a loved one is sick, or we are sick... we can't stay still... we have to do   something  . We have to get to those greener pastures, solve the problem. After months and no job... we get depressed, our situation is worse.. the need for urgent action grows stronger by the deepening of our depression, ect.  I think it's that sense we have that makes the "consumer confidence" and "business confidence" the most important and interesting survey. It is our most developed organ, our most essential survival skill. "Will things get better?" "How are things now?" affect so much in the future, because that is our primary decision making instrument. Our evaluation of current and future circumstances. That's why we feel it, I feel it, especially the changes.  What do I feel right now? Neutral.. and we're rolling down hill.... it's wait a see with a bias towards "not right now". For consumers, for business, for clients. What is gonna hit the gas? Maybe Spring.. late April - May timeframe... summer will be mildly ok... but no one will want to commit anything during a fall election time. Not that there are any consquences immediately, but still, all the same. If President Kerry, being new, does something drastic in January, the fact he' new and doing something might revive us. However if Bush is elected, it's more of the same. His tax cuts luster is gone.. they are in the system, so to speak. In people's minds, even though they have yet to take effect in large force, that was sooo last year.... and our un-evolved brain still associates immediate decision with immediate action.   Tax cuts and their effect happen at the same time... right? Must have failed... right?  This is not a political statement, just a psychological one. Just like the sentiment reports... psychological.. and the most important.

      As a person interested in software development, particularly on a UI level, I am amazed at the prevalence of one of the most useless and meaningless combinations in software.  The menu bar of: File    Edit    View  This appears on all versions of Windows, Mac OS X, Mac OS 9, Linux (KDE), and others.  It is unfortunate that this menu bar has moved it's way on to other software packages to the point that even Apple, whose UI people are use to thinking "how should we do this" not "how would everyone else do it" has fallen in to the trap of putting this awkward combination everywhere in their software.  To point: Safari  Web browsers are by definition not a file browsing, file opening, file editing application. Most people would agree that you do need to cut and paste data in to forms or out of text, but anyone that does not use the mouse to do this would probably not go to "edit" either believing that is simply for "editing" the page. Remember, power users use the mouse and know how to do this, novices would take menus at face value.  Also, view is interesting in that almost all web browses are used to view something. The idea of a "view" menu item to "view" full screen or change the text size doesn't occur to novices. This was also awkwardly assigned.  Adding insult to injury is that Apple is smart enough to add a default menu item right next to the  Blue Apple , namely the application name itself. This makes complete sense, as most people would understand that this is indeed the application they are using and would go there first to find any and all information about how to use the application. Apple has taken great care in setting an example that this is where preferences, updates, and the "about" goes, freeing Mac users from at least one more menu item.. "Preferences" or "options" or "tools" or whatever else Windows or Linux developers wish to call it.  In reality the menu items after those three are usually the useful ones: History, Bookmarks... oh wait, here we go again... the final two menu items are the "book ends" of every app  Window & Help  Window is about as useless as they come. Even those who may debate the need for a File or Edit would agree that unless you happen to be without a mouse and arrow keys, the Window menu item is useless beyond measure. In most applications, it gives you the "move, minimize, bring all to front" options.  This effectively splits the options that so appropriately go on the window itself. For instance, in all OSes the close, minimize, and maximize buttons are together. However in the menu bar this is split between File and Window. Most novice users would expect these to be together somewhere. They are not.  In Windows it was useful to select other "windows" that belong to the application.. But with the folding of windows on top of each other in the menu bar area of Windows XP, and the Mac Expose innovation, this funtionality is vestigial at best.  This isn't nearly as bad as some software applications. The odd names and lingo they choose is almost as deceitful as reading "The Meaning of Truth" in the original German. The words are hard only so that the words are hard.. hence lending credence to the "professionalism" of the application. Case in point: The small boxes on the right that most high end apps (Macromedia, Adobe, ect.) use. This trend is duplicated everywhere but Microsoft. These boxes hold useful information such as layer info, css linfo, history, files, you name it. Everything you would want at your finger tips. "Windlets" lets call them. Great name! Maybe a tool tip "The small windows". Easy. They pop up when you load the application the first time... you know what they are. What do the applications call them? "Panels"... Where are these panels loaded? Under the menu item "Windows".  If a user oops and closes a panel... is there a panel menu item the panicking user can go to? Nope... it's under "Windows".  A bucket for any liquid, File Edit View Window Help are unfortunate hindrances to good UI design, and should be eliminated and replaced with real descriptive terms. If you can't figure out a good one word description for your menu, it shouldn't be in your menu or you shouldn't be making UIs.  My suggestion for Safari:  Safari = Safari File = Sites Edit = Text (or Select)  View = Display History = History  Bookmarks = Bookmarks (although in Safari it's just Add or Show, this could be done away with too) Window = (delete it, redundant x 4) Help = Help  See how this makes sense? Anyone who has a mother or father who ask you "How do I make it full screen?" or "How do I copy this text" would easily find an easier answer using these menu items. Even "How do I open a site" would make sense.  Even these menu items aren't necessary, but as much as I would love to do away with menu items that aren't essential, that isn't possible, yet.  So why are we in this File, Edit, View world? Microsoft Word, and WordPerfect. It made perfect sense that since so many people are use to the menu at the top of these apps, making the same menu for Excel, Powerpoint, Internet Explorer, Outlook, Outlook Express, and the rest would add to comfort.   It does not. It's just lazy. Like wearing a tie just because it looks like your boss's tie, it is assumed the application must be good and functional if it has "File, Edit, View" in the menu... even if in Visual Basic it puts these menu items in the application automatically.  At The Planning Studio we focus on some UI design in dealing with web based applications. Something like the iPod and it's task based UI inspires us. We always strive to customize the view of the user to the credentials of the user... (i.e. no one not in Human Resources has a payroll update menu item in their application). This increases productivity drastically, and also allows the user to feel more at home knowing that their "guess" at what a menu items means is probably right since it's there profession or task the application is built for. We purposely use the paradigm of "active workflow adaption" to know exactly where a user is in a workflow, what they need, and only what they need. Lest you think this is like being trapped in a wizard with no back button, I can assure you the adaption is of a much higher level than that.   Even now, the most requested funtion in Outlook, Pocket PCs, Palms, and others is "active adaption"... people want to switch between their "personal" notes, calendar, tasks, and their "work" items. In innovative UI thinking, this makes sense, but is a long way off from larger software companies thought processes.  One of our selling points is demoing the software and the workflow process showing how the application changes depending on what they are doing, anticipating the UI necessary for their work. People are amazed.  When they need to create a new form.. they never think "File, New, Forms, HR Form"... instead they go to "HR", "Forms", and then they expect to create a form there, or look one up, or edit one, or delete one. If they only work or approve forms, they don't want to see or expect to see a "create form" anywhere.   They don't.  Changing the way users interact with their computers will be the biggest change in the coming years, from Longhorn's rumored 3D browsing of files based on relationships to OSX's Finder and metadata enhancements. Voice commands are still way off and silly anyway except for Google like reference searching. "What time does this movie start?" is possible, but "Open new broswer, go to w w w dot b r u c e.." is not even remotely productive or useful.  Somehow though, I imagine even when we're zooming through relational files in 3D, omnipresent at the top will be "File, Edit, View, Window".  What a shame.

      From the  won't be the last time  department:    Bruce Werner writes: I'm one of those laptop PowerBook G4 using "my cellphone is my home phone" yuppies who read the Economist and drink burnt orange tea, so maybe I am one of those freaks [you write about], but many more of my 20-something friends are also going without TV when they move in to their own apartments, much like they aren't calling Ma Bell for a landline either. With my Wall Street Journal, CNN news, and even CNBC on my cellphone and laptop, I don't feel like I'm missing a thing. And yes, I do go on more walks, with my iPod in tow.

      Before I order my second lunch pizza this week I figured I would write a quick note about life, the universe, and everything.   Work is busy, life is uncertain, things are changing, and who knows what things will look like on the other end. Could be great. Hard work will make it such.  Oh, I just got those iPod In-Ear Headphones that have been in short supply. Grabbed the second to last box. The Apple store was crazy, the iPod minis are flying off the shelf. Even during a late lunch of 2:00pm there were thirteen people in the Apple store... 13 people at 2pm, in a mall, in a computer store.   Saturday you bumped in to people and you couldn't get where you needed.  Is something really really good happening to our brand? The early 00's were pretty colors with a crappy OS. Could it be now that we have an awesome industry leading full featured unix based operating system coupled with toned down but still slick as hell and fast hardware, 64 bit G5s and broad media content, and a great new visibility with a product that Windows owners can hold (owning an apple logoed device is a powerful advertisement) that we are experiencing a huge surge in Apple demand? I think so.. I think the market will expand to 10% by end of year.. why? Same way Dell got to be number one... it's how many times you hear the brand, see the brand, see the quality. I think people are tired of seperate hardware / software... in cell phones, PDAs, and music players they are use to getting them both in one package, updated on their own. I think the idea of another incompatible DVD-R burner or an error message on a clunky interface will make people look at their iPod, blink, and go to store.apple.com. I did. My company has never been the same. Seamless integration with our UNIX environments alone is a huge productivity increase. I can't imagine corporate environments not using OSX 3.3+. All the workgroup apps plus a deep backend connection to the high-end enterprise networks.  It's coming, trust me. 10% marketshare, up from 5% now. I bet you.

      This morning was great, it was hot, the sun was warming, and golf was on TV. The Spring makes me think it might be time to start going to the driving range again. My lower back doesn't hurt anymore, so it's time to go back and mess it all up again.   Oh, and to those that think it's funny I talk about my new cable box after appearing in the Wall Street Journal talking about the end of television for my Generation-Y group, I only have one thing to say.. shutup.

         First off, it sucks! Here's why:  1) You can NOT record Interactive TV 2) You can NOT record one channel while watching another 3) You MUST watch the channel you are recording while you are recording it, or watch other recorded TV. 4) You MUST put up with tons of crappy ass banner ads all over your guide, and even the channel viewer!  This IS NOT A GOOD UPGRADE. I think we pay WAY TOO MUCH for cable already for ads even while surfing channels. What's worse.. the addition of the ads squishes the menu browser to less than half the size of the screen! The menu sucks, especially being an Apple user.. seeing ugly blue boxes that take up half the screen just to browse channels is horrible. Especially when I've seen TimeWarner's digital cable boxes across the creek in Cincinnati. They actually have sliding menus and customizeable menu skins!   Seriously, can you abuse customers like this? Do customers put up with this much abuse just for a feature like recording 40 hours of TV? Cause if so, I'm being way to nice to my customers. Perhaps I should put in the contract agreement that my clients have to put a billboard in all their offices to display my ads everytime they go to the bathroom.  Geez.  As soon as wel put it all together, we changed plans and moved the DVR box to the bad ugly old TV to just be a "dumb terminal" to record the TV we want to keep while we watch regular TV. Since the power cord is detachable from the back, they are almost hot swappable. When we want to watch something on the nice TV's, we'll lug it around like a early 90's llaptop. They only give you one for now because of the (unknowing) demand. The fact we did so points to how disappointing this thing is.   Oh wait, I have a digital camera phone with me, some pics are in order! Remember, this is the old TV so the screen is round, not flat circa. 1987. Also, this is a camera phone. With that said:  See how it cuts the screen?     Look below! You can't even look at what your watching without getting an ugly square ad taking up half the screen -->                ^             This is an ad for a mortgage company, ugh.  Now, the facts for the box that  seemed  cool at first:  MPEG-2 main-level, main-profile video processor Musicam™ and Dolby® (AC-3 5.1) output ITU Standard 64/256 QAM/FEC/Adaptive Equalizer 54 – 860 MHz tuner Out-of-band data receiver (85 – 140 MHz; 195 – 250 MHz QPSK) -2.048 Mbps Graphics – 16-bit graphics – 2-D graphics support – Digital video scaling (Picture-in-Graphics) Standard memory profile – 4 MB FLASH (Factory expandable to 16 MB) – 8 MB system/MPEG DRAM (Factory expandable to 32 MB) MediaCipher® conditional access Smart Card interface connector for e-commerce (ISO-7816) GI/Seijin IR protocol RF input/output ports (F-female/IEC-male connectors) Digital diagnostics  Macrovision copy protection  -  Oh great  Power supply cable Minimal functional panel Messaging capabilities Renewable security interface Wide-screen (16:9) support  Blah

      I love Spring. I hate the expectations of Spring, but I love Spring. You feel like you have to get out there, run around, climb trees, hang out at parks, improve yourself, do something to sweat.  However Spring also makes you feel like there are opportunities, like there are things to do that have yet to be done, and that increases sales for companies like mine, because they want someone to do something with. Spring makes you think big, makes you want to grow.  I love Spring.  Also, I am addicted to Jet's "Look What You've Done". What 70's retro band that is capable of awesome jam songs like "Are You Gonna Be My Girl" can also croon like a late 90's alt. rock band doing a Cruel Intentions like teen soundtrack? They are amazing. Check out the Are You Gonna Be My Girl video in the iTunes music store... talk about retro... they even use pencil drawn wings like a ninth grader would draw in their notebook... nothing but guitars and amps, very nice.  Also get the iTunes exclusive track "Sgt. Major".. a very nice early 70's Beatles sounding tune about their ex-manager. Great stuff. Awesome iPod fodder.

      Apple has changed my life. iTunes has changed my life. iPod has changed my life. Jet rocks. White Stripes rock. Combine, mix, lay on your couch and enjoy what is so slickly the future.   No, idiot, our lives will not be flashy "Start" buttons with constantly blinking LCDs and alerts and squares and boxes and confinement and clicks and mean people and humming machines and black smoke and red guns and blue back buttons you must click, reclick, reclick. It will not be a clock, everything's a clock, nothing will be a clock, it will not remind you of things you don't want to know, remind you of what they want, remind you they can remind you of what they want.   Our lives will be a body... laying on the floor... with nothing but one small device confirming to their body, it will be silk, it will be white, and it will wear a smile. The rest will be open, the rest will be air, the rest will be trees... and the walls you will not be able to discern by looking.

      Three Apple engineers and three Microsoft engineers are traveling by train to a conference. At the station, the three Microsoft engineers each buy tickets and watch as the three Apple engineers buy only a single ticket.   "How are three people going to travel on only one ticket?" asks a Microsoft engineer. "Watch and you'll see," answers the Apple engineer.   They all board the train. The Microsoft engineers take their respective seats but all three Apple engineers cram into a rest room and close the door behind them.   Shortly after the train has departed, the conductor comes around collecting tickets. He knocks on the rest room door and says, "Ticket, please."   The door opens just a crack and a single arm emerges with a ticket in hand. The conductor takes it and moves on. The Microsoft engineers saw this and agreed it was quite a clever idea.   So after the conference, the Microsoft engineers decide to copy the Apple engineers (as they always do) on the return trip and save some money.   When they get to the station, they buy a single ticket for the return trip. To their astonishment, the Apple engineers don't buy a ticket at all.   "How are you going to travel without a ticket?" asks one perplexed Microsoft engineer.   "Watch and you'll see," answers an Apple engineer.   When they board the train the three Microsoft engineers cram into a rest room and the three Apple engineers cram into another one nearby. The train departs. Shortly afterward, one of the Apple engineers leaves his rest room and walks over to the rest room where the Microsoft employees are hiding. He knocks on the door and says, "Ticket, please..."

      From the   Apple, pull out the midrange... testing one,two,three  department.     What a painful thing to come to, after spending $40.00 at the Apple Store on something that is almost always out of stock. I am more than willing to believe it's me. Apple, as usual, has delivered a great looking product, complete with 3 different silicon ear pieces in case you don't like the medium size. The response is fine, and they sound good, to other people. To me, it makes all my music sound like it's being broadcast from a tin can... even in Rock synthesizer mode on my iPod. In fact I'm almost willing to say Apple screwed us. Why? Walk through best buy and  try  to find earphones that don't have the kHz - Mhz rating on the side or back... even the cheapest Sonys have something. Apple's package? Notta. The instructions? Notta. The only thing even remotely technical on the whole box is the side of the container stating that it fits any 3.5-mm jack.     Anyone that has an iPod, and that is like 60% of everyone my age (driving down University of Cincinnati everyone has white wires protuding from their ears), knows that the standard white headphones are like inserting a desktop speaker in your ear. They are painfully large and sleeping with them in your ears is ensuring the morning and afternoon your inner ear is gonna ache.   For me though the pain is worth having a reproduced mid-range from a real coil, something the tweeter of the ear buds don't give. I'm keeping them since silicon in the ear is a great way to sleep with you iPod and have  no morning pain. But dancing around the room with the volume at 80%? It's the regular iPod earphones for me.

      Why I am such an Apple fan, having just converted my company and my personal life completely to Xservers and Powerbooks and whatnot. Everyone that buys and uses Apple feels the same way, and no one that runs Windows understands why.   I invite you to read an article about Microsoft  urlLink here  that will help you understand the perspective from a 15 year Microsoft veteran who just switched to a G5 Mac (I am still waiting for IBM to deliver the next huge chip upgrade to lay out 6K for a desktop computer, if ever. Desktops just aren't necessary anymore when you have technology like Powerbooks). He states a lot of interesting and obvious things wrong with Microsoft, but his discussion of Mac OSX is right on the money. You can't get a better OS than Mac OSX.  I am asked, after the rise of the Spyware issue which I think will kill Windows more quickly than security issues will, to troubleshoot a lot of nice Windows laptops for friends and family. I have an HP on my piano awaiting my freetime now. Everytime I grab a huge laptop with a Pentium 4 and feel my arm give under the weight I feel sorry for them... the ugly back with all the connectors, the non-backlit keyboard, the neon-purple crap lighting, the ugly non-widescreen LCD display, and the operating system... it's gross.  My Powerbook G4 1.3 Ghz is faster than any Pentium 4 beyond 3 Ghz, has a DVD burner, and all the whistles including the widescreen 15 incher and the backlit keyboard. My bluetooth mouse is an island unto itself.. no trasmitter base, no extra wires.. you just click it and the Powerbook goes "I'll use this now" without any help. I don't even show it to my Windows friends and family anymore because it makes them too sad that they just bought a Windows XP laptop. I am too. And Mac OSX has increased my productivity in ways I only can realize using Windows again. Mac OSX upgrades every month with tons of new features for free, puts everything two clicks away with the finder, and  urlLink Expose'  is invaluable when developing applications and you need your database app, webpages, and Photoshop images all laid out before you so you can quickly click on which one you need at that second. It is even more useful since you can set it so that when you go to the right-lower corner of your screen with the mouse, it automatically aligns your windows, and there is   no waiting   no matter how many apps you have open. No waiting at all.  It really makes you smile every time you use it. And  urlLink iSight   revolutionizes video conferencing, with it's small light firewire camera that makes even the $2,000 business conference systems look like grainy 50's television. Ask any friend who's video conferenced with me, even on Windows machines the picture is awesome with a broadband connection. The iPod needs no introduction, and I just recently replaced my wireless router (they are all buddy from Linksys and Netgear) with the Apple Airport Extreme base station, and it works faster and much better than any other 801.11g 54MB wireless connector.  I feel so bad I didn't do this before. I know many of you don't have the money I do to buy all this nice stuff, but it really is the way to go when you do go to upgrade your system.   urlLink Anyway, the article is here.

      Pessimist: Things can't get any worse Optimist: Oh yes it can!  Despite the quote above I love to use, I think I can say I have kicked cigarettes. Now, I still have a nicotine addiction as evidenced by my patch on my left arm, but the habit, the constant craving, is gone.    If you smoke, then the one hardest thing to do is to deal with the reward scenario  In this, every time you finish a hard task at work, or finish a hard test, or just step outside after an hour of working hard; smoking becomes for your brain a reward. The problem with this is that for the first few days to a week you can't do anything. You just sit there looking at your computer with this agitation like you need to do something, you can't work because you are fidgeting so much. You're not use to just working for hours without a break, every hour you get this craving... this desire to go outside and smoke. It gets stronger and stronger until you can't work because of it.   Second, is the "I am a different person" scenario.  In this, you feel you aren't going to be as creative, energetic, or focused without cigarettes. This, unfortunately, is true. Nicotine is if anything a doper.. it keeps you focused and chained to a task in deep concentration. Without it you have to learn to dig your talents out from under the newly oxygenated mess that is your brain. Only ex-smokers will know what I am talking about. Distractions are also more noticeable and you'll experience ADD for a while. Me writing in this blog in the middle of work which I never use to do, is a prime example of this. :-)   Your behavior will change, mostly from the new energy. If you're smoking and you think you have energy.. you only have 25% the energy you actually can have. This isn't just bouncing around energy, this is "feeling like doing stuff" energy. You find that again, to the annoyance of other co-workers often.   Third, is the "I'm just happier smoking, I'm going to be a smoker" scenario.  This is you deciding that life wasn't that bad smoking and really you could just quit later.  Actually, cigarettes work in your favor here.  When you don't smoke, you feel so much better you think you can go back to smoking to manage the cravings and still feel this good. You can't, and after three days if you're self-aware you'll notice that. You don't want to do that dinner out you planned last week, you don't really feel like going to the gym, you decide not to take that shower on Saturday and go to the movies. You feel short of breath sometimes again... it goes on and on.  You will turn back in to the old you, and you'll have to make a choice.  In the end, all of these are phases you go through, but sometimes they overlap. Really, in the end it's going to be about you. I  urlLink kept pictures of diseased lungs  in my pocket computer and cell phone to look at, joined the  urlLink American Lung Association's  mailing list of current news, and think about how smoking is banned in Ireland, Iceland, and New York among other places, and how happy I'd be not being in that group. In the end, it was these thing that made me feel better about not smoking after every successful day, but during those times of impulses to smoke it was just me and me.   Oh, the most important thing: Your cravings only last a few minutes.  When one hits you ever hour, the only thing you need to think about is how no matter how much you want to smoke, in 2 minutes you won't even remember you felt this way unless you think back on it. That is the key... to know that you WILL MOVE ON to the task you are in the middle of in just a few minutes and later a few second's time. This is the key to success.  I failed sometimes. I smoked at nights the first week, but then killed that as the side-effects I mentioned above came back.   What really did it was beating my body to soo much bloody hell that it's too tired and broken to smoke. Exercising 60 minutes on a treadmill EVERYDAY straight.. no stopping, no breaks, just sweating.... at 4.0 or so speed, 720 calories a day has disillusioned my body. No smoking, small trickle of nicotine and leg killing jogging every day. It probably thinks we're  in the middle of a god-awful war  and just surviving is fine, screw smoking. This is the most excellent way.  Just like never going back to Windows after buying a  urlLink Powerbook G4  with  urlLink Mac OSX (dear God you people in your square blue boxes need to give it up, XP  slaves) to quote  urlLink my friend Jeremiah  in his  urlLink adolescent commercial , "I'll never go back" to smoking. Those scenarios are over, I can work through the day looking forward to my Gatorade and sweating, and know that I can be as driven and successful without smoking as I was with... in fact, the same as with Apple, more so.  As usual, I should have done it sooner. But I think 6 years smoking means not much damage was done,  I hope.

      My week as follows will entail the following:  I will go to bed with a dull thud, and turn on BBC World News to catch the round-up before the automatic 15 minute turn-off delay with expire and switch off with me pleasantly asleep.  In the morning I will wake up in nothing but my blue and black pants, go to the shower, groom in a way to feel clean to practically antiseptic, go down stairs, begin coffee, take pills, apply nicotine patch and begin work.  Clients, insults, stress, money, worry, and wait.  In the afternoon I will take off to drive to the gym after picking up my workout buddy, exercise for 60 minutes while watching TV, switch shirts since one will be soaked through, lift weights, eat out, and then go home.   At 9pm the cravings for a cigarette will begin. I may or may not give in.  I will go to bed with a dull thud.  Such is the modern life that does, in it's own way, ensure not only survival but improvement, if I could but be left to these steps. However there is another more sinister world that does not lend itself to routine. The ambition of things are often in hopes of success, but no one reflects on the amount of worry and trouble that come with it.  Business taxes, is this personal or business, withdrawing money from business accounts for office supplies (and supper? Is that permissible?)  My health insurance, company paid. My health club membership, company paid, my Gatorade bottles, personal paid.  My business insurance, company paid. My higher workman's comp insurance due to traveling in car on business, company paid. My personal car insurance, personal paid.  The line is often fuzzy and badly drawn, and after two years in business the complexity that increases... from foreign corporation in multiple states, sales taxes, billable hours, county taxes, federal unemployment, state unemployment, state employment tax, withholding, ect. can weigh on you.  One finds it hard to believe that everything at the end of the day is taken care of, and feeling confident in one's personal and business affairs is harder and harder. Yet these things demand my time, yet so does my client, so does my own personal life.  At the end of the day, I need to feel that everything is tiddy in it's right place, room swept and cleaned, the remains of a day of hard work. However in today's environment one comes to understand that the complexity of government and business means that you cannot have the clean feeling, that mis-understandings and personal relationships between people will ensure customer satisfaction is never at 100%. The goal of a larger enterprise simply entails more complexity, and keeping everything straight in your head and in your files becomes more and more impractical if not impossible.  Then I get afraid. The horror stories. One client sues... or one IRS finds something you forgot, or one billable hour put to one account instead of another. One foreign corp annual fee not paid, one state's workman's comp not paid, one form mis-filed. My breath gets panicked, I feel the urge to go through all my records... parse it all out... make it all make sense... it does... for a day... go to ohio.state.gov, ky.state.gov, tennesee.state.gov, all the websites, all the listings, tons of portals, 90 passwords, 90 payment areas, 90 account statements, all there... but just for today.... the heart palpitates.  Meanwhile the clients want results, you manage people, to tell people what to do, you meet with them, you think about advertising, you think about new business.  Running a business at this point has few rewards. The state's portals are in dis-array and their communications are both mean and swift. No one loves you, it's all about the mechanics.   I feel a lack of soul, and no amount of sweating can purge it.  Blah

      It always happens after someone has went for the first time to a casino  They walk out to the parking lot with a look one would have after witnessing a train wreck or after a particularly violent movie, like a deer in headlights... and they were hit.  It goes in this order:  1) I should have quit when I was ahead 2) I feel so bad blowing all that money 3) I guess if I was ahead I just would have bet more 4) I wouldn't have left until I lost it all anyway 5) If I would have stuck with xxxxxxx game I would have killed 6) God this place makes so much money 7) I'm never coming back 8) Next time I come back I'll know when to quit  I tell them when they are first overwhelmed and afraid to bet, "whatever money you have you might as well consider it already spent on a nice dinner or something, because it's gone. Just because it's in your pocket doesn't mean anything."  They want me to stay for the first walk-through... then they settle on a game... this time it was Roulette.  * whosshhh * up $75 dollars *whooshhh * up $150 dollars  -- pauses to play slots... but the wheel calls....  * whoosh * down $40 dollars * whoosh * up $20 dollars *whoosh * down $70 dollars  *whoosh * busted  To me gambling isn't fun... it doesn't give you the feeling of money well spent..   If you want to know what it's like to go gambling at Argosy, imagine having a seizure in the middle of a  burning tobacco field crowded with old people while someone robs you. It is an experience for "them".. whoever "they" are... friends, family, ect.   The ride home is the experience for me... it allows me to feel good about humanity, even after the beheading in Saudi Arabia and the mean people in business and whatnot. That rational people understand something happened to them not beneficial and they think about it. It's the human process.   You realize something driving away. You realize something on the ride home.. talking about it. You realize what number 9 is, and it is this:  9) I survived it, I'm exhausted, but I survived it, and I'm glad to be going home.  Because surviving it is all you can hope for, and the experience, though not pleasurable, was an experience all the same. It is one of the only places where leaving it is as fun and relaxing as arriving. Your real world awaits.. your real, predictable, manageable risks await... you're back.. you're back in control... you choose, not the wheel.

      I am a guy  I am a cynical guy  The most sappy love story or cheap I-got-cancer-and-my-single-daughter-died ploy for emotion gets a smirk  Some friends think I'm cold.. that I never cry. I tell them that I just can't do it, I can't feel it.. I say I am not inhuman, I'm just a thinker.. but provided the real situation, the real emotion, I would feel it.  This movie had me crying like a teething baby who had their pacifier ripped away by an older brother.  I was in the middle honestly.. and when he started with Bush and his "gee golly"ishness I thought the movie would be a typical liberal poltico statement.. simple does not mean dumb.  I cannot explain what happened next... or the rest of the movie.. except to say even a block away from the theatre I felt like I had to sneeze.. but couldn't.. I didn't understand.. then boom.. crying again... right in the car..  I was mad at myself.. mad how I when the bombing started I hurdled with friends around the big screen TV.. even though I didn't want the war.. seeing us bomb was a thrill.. our troops.. best in the world.. the pride.... we'd get him.. Saddam.. like a video game... shock & awe Tom... shock & awe indeed.  I disgusted myself, I was as bad as those I didn't like.. now hate.. now loathe.. we aren't permitted to see our troops, the amputees, we aren't permitted to see the Iraqi grandmother screaming as if to our Christian Jesus..  "My children are dead! My son is dead... his kids.. I can't do anything! Oh God, I can't do anything.. I can only pray to God.. I hope God tears down their houses! Oh God what can I do? I can't do anything! I can only rely on God! I can only rely on him to make things right, because I'm so powerless.. oh I hope God does something.. please God help us!"  I am who she was talking about.. we all are... we all are deserved of God's wrath.. you don't understand this now.. you can't.. you can't.... you have to see this movie.. it will change you. No movie will ever change you like this movie.   If anyone needs tickets, I will buy you and your friend tickets, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE ALONE. if anyone needs any help to see this movie, I will provide it. Just text my cell phone in LJ. I am serious.. from Republican to Democrat.. from left to right... I want anyone who wants to see this movie PLEASE PLEASE let me know.. I will make it happen. You don't have to change your mind, you don't have to even talk with me about it again, or talk to me ever again. Just see it.. I'll hand you the tickets, wave, and walk away...   It's that important... it is the most important thing you can do... we have to make it right... our country might not ever be as great as it once was... our debt to humanity says so. God, if he exists, would not be just or merciful, if he does not revenge to us this horrible horrible act.  Disagree me, be angry with me, say I'm an American hater, curse my name... but do while you see this movie..

       Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer opened today's conference call with analysts with a recap of the points of Apple's Wednesday quarterly results press release: The company reported a US$61 million profit or $0.16 per diluted share for the quarter, compared to $19 million profit or $0.05 per diluted share for the same quarter a year ago. Revenue for the quarter was $2.014 billion, up 30 percent from the same quarter a year ago. Oppenheimer also confirmed that Apple's next-generation iMac, due in September, will be based around the G5 processor. [ urlLink MacCentral ]   How can they just let this slip? I mean, wouldn't that be half the applause at Macworld Paris? Also, this means that the i* line will be going G5, so for the first time the iMac line will be more powerful than the Powerbook line.  Either way notebook sales are rocketing.. and after a few long years Apple is once again a serious and powerful contender.

      Quoting  urlLink from this site :   Directory" gives only five James Sharps or Jim Sharps. It appears that the one Lay hired is%A0James E. Sharp%A0of "Sharp and Associates" in Washington, D.C. A March 6, 2004 article%A0by K%E9llia Ramares in Online Journal noted that the "James Sharp" in Washington,  D.C.%A0had previously worked for Lay.  Dubya also hired%A0the same James Sharp as his personal attorney after the investigation into who%A0"outed" Valerie Plame as a CIA operative heated up. As John Dean of Watergate fame noted, it was necessary for Bush to hire an outside attorney to ensure that their%A0conversations%A0were protected by attorney-client  privilege. If Bush had talked to White House counsel Alberto Gonzales instead, the prosecutor might have been able to subpoena Gonzales and compel him to testify about his conversations with Bush.   And to think I dismissed the conspiracy ramblings of Michael Moore. The network of Republicans does seem to curve inward a lot.  The Grid lit up over delaying the election in case of terrorist attack. Remember in 2000 when the right-wing media was talking about Bill Clinton using the Y2K bug to  urlLink declare Marshal Law  and continue on as president? Amazing how most people who hear this real news about his administration actively seeking a plan is met with a yawn. This does not mean Bush is getting a free ride on this issue, but simply that Americans now get the scare game and ignore it en masee. That is ultimately bad for Bush.   urlLink Josh Marshall finally covers the Niger issue I talked about a few days ago.   This gay marriage thing is so convoluted I have no real comment. Mass. is not sinking in to hell because of same sex marriage, and America will notice. To Republicans: Like the civil rights movement of the 60's... you lost, humanity wins. But the South will still feel justified in their ignorance & love you... and stay poor because no one will invest & grow businesses in backward conservative towns.  urlLink Sorry for the facts . Even most urlLink  businesses understand this fact . It doesn't matter, really, since the Republicans can't even bring to a vote the constitutional amendment, which would fail anyway, because they urlLink  can't agree on which version to put forth . Bush has put the conservatives in a divisive corner reminiscent of the one Democrats fell in before they became fragmented and lost the House, Senate, and their minds.  It's all good, because Rush Limbaugh can continue to tell them it's taxes and liberals making the south poor.

      While following the financial news of the day, the talk of a buy-out of a Euro Zone company by a billionaire investor has passed my eyes and been dismissed. However, after having today acquired a 52 inch television there is nothing to test the resolution of a screen more than turning on Bloomberg. Bloomberg does not take the horrible and dis-honorable position of broadcasting infomercial during the wee hours of the morning like CNBC, but instead broadcasts European affiliate content through their trading day. In fairness, CNBC  urlLink also has a foreign affiliate , but has chosen not to make NBC a more powerful financial brand by taking the money from Norditrack and the Insta-Juicer and broadcasting their 30 minute ads instead.   Regardless, my 52 inch television performs very well, and on Bloomberg was an interview with both at once the M & S CEO and Green himself regarding the rejection of the 4 pound a share offer for their stock. I really enjoyed this, since in America we don't get a cross-fire like interview style where billionare investors and CEO's of a company square off. It made the whole dry and boring ordeal interesting. M & S apparently is really interested in the 30 - 55 year old female market which they have not pursued. The analyst at Bloomberg are not confident that M & S can do a very good job at growing the business, but being an innocent passer-by I can not offer any analysis other than European economics are more boring than American politics, if possible.  The grid has lit up over night about one thing: Wilson is a lair.  There was a harsh drilling of Republican leader Pat Roberts on Meet the Press from the eminent and insightful Tim Russert about CIA intelligence failures and if (more like when) the Bush administration hyped the evidence beyond the bad intelligence data to the "mushroom cloud" talk that happened about 1 mile away from me at the Union Terminal in Cincinnati, OH. I have a permanent view of it from my river location.. lit up like a dome of light at night. The railroad bridge that use to carry rail passengers to the Union Terminal back in the art-deco thirties runs right above my street. Needless to say in 2002, right after September 11th, having him so close making an invasion speech toward an Arab country had me wondering I should watch the address in my Grandfather's 50's bomb shelter. Alas, signals do not travel well through reinforced concrete.  The thing that occurred to me watching Tim in top form pulling references and quotes like a post-modern Socrates nitting a web of factual statements to come up with the big and damning THEREFORE as he always does, was how the Republicans would counter this huge issue during an election year. This was obvious, and a great chapter from the distraction playbook that businesses and politicians on both sides all use: Confuse and sideline the large and complex epic by focusing on a simple episode in that epic that is easier to understand and can be seen as throwing the whole debate in doubt even if if relates in no way to the rest of the epic. Their great and intelligent pick:  Wilson lied, Iraq did seek large quantities of Uranium from Niger.   This is pretty impressive, and according the article that set  The Grid  afire,  urlLink from the Chicago-Sun Times , we can thank Britain for this revelation. In what was a pretty even handed and much friendlier review of intelligence than Bush got in America, they were right about the uranium from Niger.. even if Wilson never found any evidence of it.  This does not end the serious issue of the neocons destroying his wife's CIA cover,  urlLink although even that has seemed to be exploited by Wilson himself  so much as to appear in Vanity Fair with said "secret" wife, and is most certainly treasonous, but it does diminish to a large extent his credibility.  What is hilarious to this fair and balanced blog, is that the conservative bloggers are forgetting the defense they use to defend Bush on WMD in Iraq is the same defense that Wilson also has  Just because he didn't find anything doesn't mean he lied . He could have just not found the Iraqi deal-makers, or was perhaps mis-lead by the same damn intelligence agency that had it's ass just handed to itself by The People of the United States.  Still, to see the shrill shouts of glee from the right shows they are close to ignoring and violating this defense, and I offer the following:   urlLink Tom Maguire goes absolutely insane in vindication , and  urlLink Andrew Sullivan is practically flaming like a gay man should . You can see instapundit for the whole layout of how The Grid has lit up.  Will this be enough to side-line Bush talking about a smoking gun the shape of a mushroom cloud? Hell no. But it might just carry through past America's attention span.  Wilson has hugged the media to the point of reflecting on who could play his wife in the movie, but this explosion of "told you so" just shows how desperate the right has gotten for good news. Of course, that's better than the Democrats who have went months with no news at all. Seriously, do they even show up for work in the House or Senate? Besides Barbara Boxer's rants from the extreme left, I don't hear from anyone over on the hill. What about Tom Daschale? After his cameo on HBO's short lived "K Street" I haven't so much as seen him on camera. Odd.   urlLink  Trackback
