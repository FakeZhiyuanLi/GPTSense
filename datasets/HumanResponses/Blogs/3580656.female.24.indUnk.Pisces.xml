      I'm not hugely in to Hip Hop or Rap, but one artist that has caught my eye has been Kanye West. I quite enjoy the stuff of his I have heard and was surprised and pleased when I saw one of his videos on TV the other day... called "Jesus Walks". The video definitely gives you something to think about, and I think that the video and the lyrics will be seen as controversial. So check it out.

      Not much has really happened the last couple of days, as you can tell from the lack of blogs. But we did have fun yesterday, lunch with Dawn & Derek, went for a walk to get ice cream cones with Janelle, Steve & baby Isabelle and then on to Darrens for a housewarming BBQ, man that is a NICE house. So it was a fun day.  I had my first temping job on Friday afternoon, which went well, I was just answering the phone. But I have to admit that I had been feeling a tad nervous.

      Well my excitement with the footy was short lived, and they really should have won todays match. What a bummer.

      Decided that I needed to get on and get some work, so today I went to a temping agency and signed up. So hopefully I'll have some work come my way in the next couple of days...YAY to the money, BOO to the hard work. BUT looking forward to meeting some new people, it'll be a good opportunity to make some new friends.

      We beat Croatia 4-2.....this means we go through to the quarter finals.   It's funny how, now that I don't actually live around people who watch it constantly I am actually beginning to watch it more, and really enjoy it. Not sure the neighbours liked all the yelling tho ;-)

      I was just chatting to a good friend from home on MSN (Kaz it was great catching up!!!) And she asked me how I was feeling about living in Canada now... and it's funny, cos I had been thinking about the very same issue 1/2 hr earlier while I had been out walking.    I have to admit to still having very mixed feelings. I still miss England very much, I miss my family, friends and church hugely.   Here are some lyrics from a song that I really relate to: 'Where am I now, I'm looking but can't see ahead, Lost in this space, there's a voice calling out in my head..... I'm falling away, I am lost in the wilderness, I'm pulling away on the wings of a prayer, I'm travelling thru riding high in to paradise, and all I can see is wilderness.' It reminds me so much that God promises to refine us, that he may lead us through the desert in that process, but it is so that we can pass on to the greater things He has planned for us. I believe in His promises, and every day He shows me more and more things to be thankful for: we have people here who care and love us, He has provided  a roof over our head and food to eat, we have a good life in a great country.  He has also taught me to remember that really what He cares about is me, not what I wear or eat, where we live or what we drive. But about me spiritually, not the external me. Maybe He will bless us with somewhere nice to live, or give us an amazing sports car, but that won't be what matters, what matters will be where I am going with Him, where His place is in our lives, how we are fulfilling the purpose He has designed us for. Maybe that will mean living in a tiny house in the worst area of the city, but maybe that is so we will be Jesus to our neighbours, which would be far more rewarding than a nice house or sports car.   I have 2 prayer requests: That you would pray that we would hear Gods voice clearly, and that we would know & act on His truth fully.  But I know that I/we can only do this because 'I can do all things THROUGH Him who strengthens me' Phil 4 v 13, praise God that He strengthens us, protects us, LOVES us and carries us.  God bless all.

      As in I have some, so here's the test, if anyone actually checks my blog and wants one, please leave a comment with your full e-mail address, and I'll give you an invite (if there are any left that is). Remember, gmail means never having to delete a message ever again (unless you really want to).

      I couldn't watch the game even if I'd wanted to, couldn't find any channels airing the match. But I have it from good sources we won 3-0, that's something at least, now we need to win the next match to stay in with a chance.  I have to admit to feeling a bit out of it being here, I miss going round to one of the guys houses (usually Belmonts) to have munchies and cider (beer for the men). Oh well, I hear loads about it on Radio 1, and L keeps me company while I yell at the TV, hopefully we'll get to watch the next match on Monday against Croatia.  Keep it up boys!

      It's great, a friend has given me an invite for gmail, which I've accepted. And I know of at least one person who has already begged me for an invite, unfortunately Google hasn't given me any invites to hand out, but I am hoping, watch this space.   If you have no idea what I'm talking about here's how a friend described it  'Like hotmail only instead of 2MB, you get 1000MB.' It's great, don't really have to delete anything.

      Not done too much today, but me and Mum did cook a roast lamb dinner for us & L's parents. It was wonderful, haven't had lamb since I left England, it's too expensive here.   And the sun is finally showing it's face again, but I have to admit we did need the rain, I just wish it had been at a time when Mum wasn't visiting, most of my plans had been for outdoors, ahh well.   But everything looks wonderfully green, it's great, hope it lasts a while. And hopefully the farms have gotten enough moisture, I've been told the last couple of years have been too dry, and the farmers have not had the best of times.  I guess the excitement for the rest of the week will be Mum going home, it certainly won't be the England match Thursday, don't know if I can even watch it, Sunday was too depressing, got my hopes way too high, should have known it wouldn't last!

      As all the Canadian readers know, it's the big election here in a couple of weeks. I'm bringing this up to ask you, my friends (can't imagine any strangers reading this) to pray about this election. The main issues are government spending, schooling, health care and Gay rights. Please could you just pray that Gods will is done, that the right people are elected to govern this country, that Gods truth is respected and not slandered as 'old fashioned' and 'irrelevant'.  Thanks

      We drove up to Candle Lake, where Lindsays parents have their motorhome, on Friday evening as soon as Lindsay had finished work, and grabbed some dinner on the way. Me, Lindsay & Mum stayed in what they call a 5th wheel, which is like a large caravan (don't know how else to explain it), at the same RV park as L's parents.  It pretty much rained the entire weekend, but we still went over to Waskasui on Saturday, to look around the shops and see the resort, which is in the middle of Prince Albert National Park. In the evening we went to visit some friends who have a cabin at the lake (it's a beautiful cabin that they built themselves!). Then this morning got up and played games, we taught the 'olds' how to play Uno Extreme, which they all found very funny, especially when I got loads of cards fired at me.  We got to see a lot of wild deer, all just wandering next to the road, Mum loved it.  I have to admit that today was weird, I guess partly cos we were with L's parents and my Mum, not quite how I had imagined our first anniversary. But we left L's parents up at the lake and drove back with Mum this afternoon, then dumped Mum at L's parents house so we could go out and celebrate for the evening. But both of us felt pretty tired, so just had a small bite to eat at Boston Pizza, then came home for a quiet night in. I think we'll probably go out for a 'posh' dinner next weekend, when we have more time.

      How typical is this, Mum arrives on the Friday, (which was a scorcher) has one wonderful sunny day on the Saturday, and it's been grey and rainy ever since! It SUCKS!!!! Saskatoon is meant to be one of the sunniest city's in Canada, and believe me, it usually is. Must be Mum, she brought all the pants weather with her.  And to add to my misery, we're going to Candle lake today, and I was hoping the weather would improve, but it doesn't look like it... GUTTED!

      So mum arrived on Friday, and already she's seen 2 hockey games (not quite what I had planned) as she arrived in time for the 2 remaining games in the Stanley Cup, and there is NO WAY Lindsay would miss those!  Other than that we haven't done loads, just spent time with family and friends. But today we're going shopping... let the madness begin...

      Welcome, welcome.   A new way to keep up to date with friends and family, this makes me very excited, I hope you enjoy the ride.  Please feel free to check out my blog, and send me witty comments.  My mum is here visiting right now so will have to be short and sweet, but I promise to try and make this entertaining viewing.  God Bless all!

      Marlene & Peter (L's parents) have traded in their old 1996 33' motorhome, for a luxury 2002 36' motorhome (well, I think it is a luxury motorhome). This thing is NICE!!! It has 2 slideouts (you push a button and part of the wall slides out further, only when stationary tho). It really is a moving house: nice kitchen with all the mod cons, kitchen table &amp; chairs,&nbsp;a 2 seater leather love seat, a 3 seater sofa bed, nice bathroom, queen size bed, 2 TV's, VCR, satellite&nbsp;and LOADS of storage. And we're going away with them next weekend...CLASS IN A GLASS! You could NOT drive this thing on British roads my friends, this thing is a monster.

      This weekend is gonna be pants as Lindsay has to work today, so really our weekend has to be crammed in to tomorrow. But the weather has been good today, so I have been sunbathing while he isn't here.  However, next weekend is a long weekend&nbsp;as Monday 2nd August is a bank holiday here, and we both have Friday off, so 4 day weekend...CRACKIN'!

      I LOVED yesterday, it was a GREAT Sunday. Sunday is my favourite day of the week anyway, but yesterday was just CLASS. We had a great preacher from Canada Food For The Hungry, who talked about the missionary work they do, but who also preached an awesome sermon. Then we went downtown to the river bank to watch the speed racing and eat yummy food, although it was a bit hot 30+oC. Then we went over to Dawn &amp; Dereks for a BBQ, to hang out with a group of friends&nbsp;and to watch Calender Girls (and bask in their air conditioning), the boys weren't too keen at first on the film, but all agreed at the end how good it was. I did feel a little homesick seeing the beautiful Yorkshire countryside though. It really was a wonderful day.

      Well I got my wish, looks like today will be a scorcher, but maybe just a bit too hot, it's forecast as getting as high as 35oC. I am so pleased that the church has air conditioning, at least we'll be cool during the wedding and reception.

      I started a new temping job yesterday afternoon and had my first full normal working day today. It was a really good day, but I feel pretty tired now, although it feels good to actually have done a decent days work, and know that there will be some money coming in. I seem to get on well with the other women in the office, and have been invited to go out for lunch with them tomorrow for someone's B'day. It's a relief to have some work.  I'm hoping the good weather lasts for the weekend, it would be nice as we have a friends wedding on Saturday, then we were hoping to go to 'A Taste Of Saskatchewan' on Sunday. It is a food festival based down on the river bank, it's great, good food, good weather and the 'River Roar', which is speed boat racing.

      It looks like more work is coming through for me, which is great, and will do my purse a lot of good.  My problem now is that I am worried about when I will get the opportunity to listen to Radio 1's Chris Moyles show. It is a problem cos 'the boy' doesn't like listening to it, so I usually listen to it once he's gone to work, but now I'm gonna be working when he is! I know that it isn't exactly crucial to listen to it, but it lessens my homesickness listening to it... oh well, I'll think of something.

      Last Thursday (1st July) was Canada Day, which is a bank holiday for everyone over here. So Lindsay got Friday off so that we could go up to Candle Lake for the weekend. Wednesday (30th June) was Daniels 4th B'day, so had B'day cake and pressies with him Wednesday night, then travelled up north to the lake on Thursday morning, watched Linds and Pa in law play Slow Pitch ball (like baseball), then Wes & Diane & Boys arrived so had more pressies and B'day cake again....IT WAS GREAT...love B'day cake! Later that evening Me, Linds & Peter went down to the lake shore to watch the Canada Day fireworks display, and got half eaten to death by mosquitoes. The rest of the weekend was taken up with golf for the boys (including Daniel...he even has his own golf bag & clubs), eating, walks, eating, games, eating, and crazy golf...loads of fun. Plus got to have lots of cuddles with Steven who is only 3 months old, loved it, he is very cute.

      Well, we're dog sitting this weekend. My friend has gone away with her hubby for their wedding anniversary, so we're looking after their dog. He's a cute little thing but a bit weird.We went over this evening and for the first 10 minutes he wouldn't come out of his kennel and just growled at us, then all of a sudden he comes out, eats, and comes looking for affection with his tail wagging.  So this should be fun, he loves playing with his rubber toy bone, and seems to just want Lindsay to wrestle with him for it constantly. It's like being at home, playing with Millie, except he doesn't shed as much and hasn't got the same high pitch yowl as her.

      I have had a great afternoon with a lady from work who is also a christian. We arranged to meet up at a coffee shop to have a natter, and we had a great time. We discussed differences in beliefs, how God has worked in our lives, how as a united world wide church are we 'spreading/showing' the Good News. It has just been a refreshing, encouraging and inspiring afternoon. I love how God leads us to people , and how that meeting can be such a blessing in so many ways.  I AM IN AWE AT HOW GOD WORKS...HE IS SO GREAT AND AMAZING! LET EVERYTHING THAT HAS BREATH PRAISE THE LORD!

      Yes, yes, for the 3rd time in 6 months I have again got a sinus infection, I am NOT a happy bunny.  We went to Rosthern for the weekend, and stayed with Marlene & Peter in their lovely big motorhome. Friday night, we drove to Hague to Uncle Henry & Aunt Linda's farm for a BBQ in honour of Noreen (L's cousin) who was home from Hong Kong. We had a really good time, and I loved getting to know Noreen, unfortunately we probably won't see her again until next summer.  Needless to say, golfing was a big part of the weekend, Linds really enjoyed it. Wes and Daniel came for a night, we had a great time with them, Daniel played 9 holes of golf the afternoon they arrived, then played 4 rounds of crazy golf the next day, that boy is obsessed!  This summer hasn't been as hot and sunny as last year, but compared the the english summers, I think it's been pretty good, and there is still all of August to come.....loads of time.
