						   well i officially miss snowboarding. i am such a loser i miss snowboarding so much that i slept with my snowboard last night. but i had a cool dream, i was in this awesome house with all of my closest friends and then we saw a crack in the ceiling and we looked in it and we saw people in the attic and then we heard loud music start to play so i went up there and one of my favorite bands was playing up there (strike anywhere). it was sweet.

						   by the way i totally love music i think it is incredible and you might think i am crazy but i think that music could be a tool to bring this world to peace because who doesnt like music if there is something that everyone can agree on then there should be hope for world peace but anyway thats my farfetched idea about music. my favorite bands right now are Thursday, Thrice, Cursive, Fairweather, Transplants, Coheed&Cambria, The Faint, Modest Mouse, Mates of State, Saves the Day, At the Drive In, Every Time I Die, Stretch Arm Strong, Give Up the Ghost, Rise Against, Bright Eyes, Death Cab for Cutie, Boy Sets Fire, Strike Anywhere, Q & Not U, The Blood Brothers, Desaparacedos, Atmosphere, Eyedea & Abilities, Outkast, The Rise, The Bronx, Funeral For a Friend, Paint it Black, A Billion Ernies, and Rx Bandits.

						   ok so here is the situation; I really really like this one girl but i am pretty sure she doesnt like me the way i like her. well i really want a girlfriend but i am sort of waiting to find out if this girl likes me cause i dont want to ruin anything we might possibly have if she does end up liking me but i also want a girlfriend really really badly. so any helpful suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Blah Blah Blah shut up spencer oh and by the way farenheit 9/11 was most excellent and everyone should see it and everyone who can vote needs to to get that creep out of office.
