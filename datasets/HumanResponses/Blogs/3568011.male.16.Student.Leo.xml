      I finally have found some time to go to my computer, and better yet, I've found a great program to create websites(it is polish so I wont talk much about it, the school is over and I have plenty of free time (after one year of paternal opression I deserve a bit relax), and I'm going to try create a website, specially about anime and my book. That's all for now.

      Just yesterday my dad gave me a detention for two more weeks. And why?   Just because I installed a new program on the computer and it stopped the computer for a while! And my dad won't even listen to me that it could be something else, because that program was completely safe (by the way, it was the Delphi 6). Well, it seems that I won't see my computer for those two weeks and i won't be able to continue with my blog for that time >( or i'll just have to go to a internet club and pay 1 Euro for hour. I just hope I wont become a mad man trying to suicide himself (the chanses are weak but they still exist), ever since my mom is dead my father is turning my life into a hell.

      Hi my name is Mikolaj (make fun of it if you want I can't hear it), this is the first thing that I do in the net besides searching for Saber Marionette J episode downloads (if anyone knows anything about where I can find it please send me a mail for Steriodas@hotmail.com)I don't know how to start with a blog so I'll just tell something about myself.  I was born in Poland, and now I'm 15 years old, my life was going just find until I came to Portugal with my family in for holiday. The first couple of days I did nothing but sitting in the apartment my dad had rented and fighting with my brother or sister. After few days my dad took us to the ocean. I thought Portugal had a wonderful view from the coast, with a splendid sunset far away in the middle of the ocean... But I was wrong. The beach was dirty with hundreds of broken clams, the sand was dirty and smelled like few thousands of rotten fish swimming in sewer instead of ocean. This was the first four days from our "trip". Few days later I went to the beach once more, I was nine years by then, this time we went without my dad. My mom allowed me to go take a bath because a friend of my dad was there with us and she though he would help if something would happen to us, she was wrong... It didn't took long before the ocean "sucked" me into a much distant area, the man who was supposed take care of me had the same problem (I think) and swimmed to the beach. After few whiles I saw my mom swimming towards me, but the waves increased and turned things much worst. After few whiles I reached my mother and we tried to come back to beach, unluckily something seemed to be pushing her down under the water, I tried to reach her for few seconds but I hadn't a good pulmonary capacity, so I had to go back to the surface. When I submerged once more I did'n saw my mom.  When I understood I wasn't strong enough to help her I swam few meters near the quay, I grabbed two rocks and waited a while looking for a path to swim to the quay. Finally I got out of the water and I realized I was all in slashes made by clams and stones. Finally on the beach I saw my mom lying on the sand, surrounded by medics.  Later that day my father called me, my brother and my sister into his room. He told us that our mom was dead during the transport to the hospital. I think this were the saddest days of my life :(

      It's hard to find ideas for new post because there is nothing so interesting abut my life, beside being all wreced up, so this isn't soo easy to talk about only My problems, it would help a lot if There were somebody reading My blog! Anyway, this is all I had to say right now.

      I've survived the two weeks without computer, but unluckily Ihave another two weeks without it, because Iturned the internet off for few minutes and my dad was downloading a movie by Kazaa, luckilly my own computer isn't the only resourceof the internet I know. Back to my blog, I decided to add some images as soon as I find some. By the way I'm developing my first web page, so I'll put a link to it when I publish it on the net. I'm also creating a new game,kind of short and basic but it's great! It's called "Poyo's first adventure", the main character is the Poyo, looking a kind of pink bubblegum, with cute black eyes and an eversmiling mouth, that can ransform into many poyo species. That's all for now, I'll try to post more in future.
