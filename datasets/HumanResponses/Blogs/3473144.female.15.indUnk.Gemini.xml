           It struck me as odd a few years ago getting up at the crack of dawn to go to classes then falling asleep during class only to realize, hey wait I need to know some of this crap. But I couldn't retain anything I was reading and I was hardly hearing anything the teacher was saying. The problem? It was to early! I am most definitely not a morning person. So getting up at the crack of dawn to learn stuff some of which I may actual need for the rest of my life just doesn't mesh.         With a few scientific studies saying teens learn best when they are awake (gee that was news to me!) one wonders why junior highs(middle schools) and high schools demand that their students get up at the crack of dawn to attend classes, the teachers complain that we don't learn because we are not awake, and we complain because they have banned coffee and pop before noon for students, to break this rule is punishable by detention, at least at my school.         One wonders what they think children learn, it makes us learn to hate the mornings because we are always in a rush one also may wonders if the extra 15min of sleep is worth missing breakfast?  The answer my fellow prisoners and I have come up with is a "yes!" I\we can easily grab a cookie(oh so healthy) at the coffee house before class, should I catch the 7:30 bus, to get to school near an hour before class, I have plenty of time for homework (done messily) and a quick rather unhealthy breakfast.        Between classes starting at 9:00 the public transport system not running busses on a regular basis or at the time me and my fellow prisoners need it leaves us with no choice but to struggle through our AM classes, and hope we retain maybe one tenth of what we should have learned.         At the end of the term, come finals it leaves some of us struggling to remember what we should. A good number of us scrambling for tutors at 33+$ and hour. If the school bored say what we learn in JH and high school is important I'm inclined to believe them, a bit at least, but they must also know that teens just like everyone else need sleep to function properly and the teen age body needs more than most.          so with that I leave you to wonder. Why do they even try to teach us when we should be at home asleep?

      3rd term. 21 days left of school. Then im free for the summer. I'm sick of school its exactly like the title claims its prison. Up with the sun in class for hours and we are pretty much done learning but they still make us come anyways. Exams are the last full week of june and as usual i havent started studying. Sounds like me doesnt it? hey wait. Do you even know me? probably not meh not like it matters.  So tangencies, whats that all about right? well im sitting here in computer class not working on my flash video which is probably due sometime next week and i said to myself... a blog thats what I need. anyways back to the point. A tangent is math... or, a sudden digression or change of course. Yup that sounds like me, but of course I didnt have the brains to acctualy remember the word I had to get behleh(5$ to person who knows her real name) to come up with the name.  Sounds about average doesnt it? Just another brain-dead day in the life of moi.
