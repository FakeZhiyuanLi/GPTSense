      It's amazing.  I have 222 viewers of my blog website.  Just earlier today I was at 199.  Either I'm pretty popular or I've reached 221 stragglers, since I really only have 1 reader---ME.  In anycase, more news on me.   So I started my Objective Personality Assessment class on Monday.  First day of class I get assigned 9 chapters to read.  Amazingly, it's 3:17 and I've read 8 out of 9 chapters for class tonight.  Normally I probably wouldn't read, but since we have quizzes now over what we've read, I have to.  I'm in graduate school--- what's up with the quizzes? To add even more pressure, if anyone in the class has an average below an 83 on the quizzes, we will have a final!  83 or a "B"-, is also the lowest grade you can earn and not be on academic probation.  Sometimes I forget I'm in graduate school.  Well, not really being in graduate school, but the fact I'm working on my Doctorate.  When my professor explained that in order to get an "A" in the class we needed to demonstrate Doctoral level work, a red flag shot up.  I'm thinking, I don't have a Doctorate, so how can I show Doctoral level work?  This is quite sad actually my thinking process at that moment, in fact, I probably shouldn't be sharing this with all my 222 viewers.  Oh well!  I've also been told by my friends that I need to work on my vocabulary.  I tend to say deers instead of deer or fishes instead of fish.  I also wonder about beer or is it beers? Ben and I were discussing this last night.  Which is it?  In anycase my friend Chelsea told me, "Rebecca when you get your Doctorate, make sure you say deer instead of deers".  I really do know it's deer and not deers, but it's confusing when I see a couple of deer walking by.  This doesn't happen very much, in fact never, now that I've moved to Dallas.  There are not any deers.

      For men: 1).  English:  What does it mean when you say, "I'll call you?" 2).  Math:  How many women can you have sex with and still be monogamous? 3).  Psychology:  Other than abject fear, what are some possible reactions to the words, "I love you?" 4).  Economics:  Who pays for dinner if your date makes more money than you, and how long before you resent her for it? 5).  Physics:  Find a way to arrange your bathroom items on your half of the sink, knowing full well your girlfriend needs the whole sink for her items.  For women: 1).  English:  When you say, "I'm not in a rush to get married," define the word "rush". 2).  Math:  Is the amount of minutes it takes you to evaluate a date as a potential husband more than or equal to the amount of minutes it takes you to identify and ignore the red flags? 3).  Psychology:  Other than abject fear, what are some possible reactions to the words, "I need space?" 4).  Economics:  How much should you pay for an apartment you never visit in order to keep a boyfriend from freaking out that you live in his? 5).  Physics:  Find a way to arrange your bathroom items on your half of the sink while still maintaining the illusion that you wake up looking this good.  Pencils down.  Break up or marry accordingly.

      I found these funny horoscopes and wanted to share them with you.  I'm just going to do a few months, but if I didn't choose your month let me know and I'll include it.  Enjoy!   Libra  (MY horoscope) Your planets turn fickle this month.  Pluto can't decide if you should live happily ever after or die alone.  This thought might keep you up at night.  You will be troubled by that whole "bird in the hand" thing and wonder if you should have stuck it out, but you did the right thing.  Your ex was not The One.  Or was he? End-of-the-month news of his engagement might set you back a bit.  Gemini  Take some risks this month.  Although not risks like you took last month.  You should  always  use a condom.  But you know, some small risks, like asking out that guy you always see at the gym.  He will turn out to be gay, but at least you put yourself out there.  The Twenty-first is a good time to make changes, like switching to a different gym, or city.  Aquarius  The planets are shifting in your favor, and you're in the power seat...for about a day.  The Twenty-first.  So don't sleep through it.  The rest of the month you have no control over your love life whatsoever.  You will fall for a string of men who just want to be friends, lose ten pounds, gain twelve, and contemplate lesbianism.  Hang on though.  By the end of the month, a relationship you have questions about will become even less clear.  Pisces  This month is going to be a roller coaster, Pisces, so keep your hands in the car! You will meet an exciting new man on the Third, but find out he has a girlfriend.  Another sexy stranger will come into your life on the Tenth (not as sexy as the first guy, but this one is at least available) and you will share an incredible night of passion, then he won't ever call you again. Sorry.  Taurus  Get ready! Your job is about to get much more demanding, especially near the full moon of the Twenty-first, which is good, because it will take your mind off the Breakup. Be aware that your superiors are under a lot of pressure, so they might be less tolerant of sobbing during work hours.  Likewise, the phone sessions with your therapist might no longer be considered a valid reason to miss a meeting.  Venus in Scorpio means all eyes are on you- so this is a good time to stop stealing office supplies.  (Yes, kleenex boxes are considered office supplies.)

      So I decided my dateless nights in Dallas idea was not a good one.  Really who  truly  wants to be single anyway? I mean if I could choose to be happy in love or be single, I'd choose to be happy in love.  Wouldn't you? It's easy to say you want to be single when you are.  I mean what's the point to dig yourself into a hole or deep depression rather and tell yourself you hate being single, which you are? I don't know.    Plus I had a date Friday night so that put an end to my dateless nights.  I didn't last very long.  I don't know if it was really a date since he's been my friend for a long time, but my dad would classify it as a date.  It's a guy, we're going out, and he's paying for me.  This qualifies as a date to my dad.  And to me really.  Although he didn't just pay for three rounds of my drinks, he also paid for my two friend's three rounds of drinks as well.  Nice guy, huh?  Although he's a little too forward for me and well, I'm just not really attracted to him.  Neither were my friends.  Plus I should know you can't bring a guy to a bar unless it's your significant other and you like the guy.  Today I went out on the boat with my sister, her boyrfriend,  urlLink Chelsea , Perry, and Robert.  I had a great time and somehow we avoided the rain.  Chelsea and I also avoided serious injury or death while being dragged in an inner tube on the lake.  It's a little bit scary to be hanging on for my life and read Caution: This float could cause serious injury or death!  It turned out to be a lot of fun!  It's also great to make friends with people who own boats!  Mission accomplished!

      Well I went to work today, but after 3 hours I decided I was bored and wanted to take a nap, so I left.  I got up to 11.5 hours this week.  Last week was not so good, with only a total of 7 hours.  I really should work my 14 hours.  I'll probably go shopping instead.  I want a shirt like  urlLink this .  Except I want it a little shorter and brown to go with the pink capri pants I bought yesterday from Express.  I saw a girl wearing this outfit and I want it.    On another topic, I found a practicum site for the Fall! Thanks to good ole' dad.  I'll be volunteering at Positive Pain Management in Garland.  And yes I did say volunteering.  The kids from UNT doctoral psychology program get a paid practicum.  Hopefully they'll realize the absurdity of this and pay me as well.  I'm really excited about it even if I don't get paid!  Even more exciting is I'll get to learn about hypnosis!   So far my dateless day number 1 has been good.  Tonight I've been offered to go out to Sherlocks with Chelsea and Sofia to dance and have wicked, good fun!  Sofia and her boyfriend of 6 or 7 months just broke up so she needs a night of summer lovin!  I still haven't decided if I will go or not.  I'm actually thinking about staying in tonight and watching my Friday night line up and ordering a pizza.  I haven't been able to stay at home on a Friday night and watch my shows in a long, long time so I'm actually sort of looking forward to that.  But it is fun to go out dancing with my girls!  But I don't think I have anything to wear.    I've also been looking for apartments for when my lease is up in October.  I've been trying to convince Ben, my future roommate, to move in with me to Estancia Townhomes.  My mom is trying to convince me to move back home.  Now this is not going to happen.  I would definitely be dateless many, many more days.  When Travis and I decided to go to Cozumel together after we had been dating over a year, my dad thought it would be appropriate to book us in a room with double beds.  First mistake-- don't let your dad book your trip.  So I'm pretty positive it would not be conducive to live at home and have a relationship.  So Ben, I'm not joking.

      I met this girl awhile back who said she hadn't been on a date in 7 or 8 months.  She said she really got to know herself during that time.  I think this is so cool and today marks the day of my dating hiatus.  Now I haven't been dateless for more than a month so we'll see.  Just last Thursday I was into the whole experimenting idea.  Date all that I can, see what all is out there. Next Thursday who knows what I'll come up with. I tend to vacillate at times, but that's just me.  Just ask my friends.    I think my friends find my dating stories amusing.  Maybe they're laughing at me, maybe they're laughing with me--- who knows?  But the two questions I always get without fail are: (1) You wreaking havoc on any poor new boys? and (2) Have you talked to Travis?  It makes it a little more interesting these days when I can say, which Travis?

      Last night I went to the Blue Mesa off of Northwest Highway with Ben and Christina for happy hour.  I would definitely recommend going to a Blue Mesa for happy hour as they have free quesadillas and chips.  Very tasty.  Their beer is 2.00, but their mixed drinks are 5.95 and I had 3.  Not too excited when I had to pay 20.00 in drinks.    So here's the real story about my night.  Christina and I were walking up to the door to Blue Mesa and I see this guy standing out there talking on the phone.  Now from afar and not having my contacts in, I think he looks pretty cute.  He's dressed cute anyway.  Anyway we get closer and I think he see's us looking at him so I look away and never get a good look at him.  Well he comes into Blue Mesa too.  Christina and I get our table and wait on Ben.  I notice that guy keeps looking at me so I smile back at him a few times.  What am I supposed to do?  Well I go in line and get quesadillas for us and he comes up behind me to also order some.  I make small talk and without really thinking about it say, "Are you hanging out here alone"? He says, "No, I'm waiting on some friends to get here".  That's the end of the conversation because my food was ready.  So I go sit back down.  I guess it sounded like a pick up line, but really I was just trying to be nice.  He kept looking at me and I felt sorry he was standing there alone so I was going to invite him to sit with us.  Plus, upon closer attention to him, I realized he didn't really have a chin and his teeth were bad.  I really need to wear my contacts.  Damn beer goggles and I wasn't even drunk yet!

      My profile has been viewed 137 times.  By who? I don't think I even know 137 people.  That's kind of scary to think all these people are reading my blog, but then again, hey the more the merrier.  My theory is this, one person viewed my account 137 times.  Hey maybe they were bored?

       urlLink Bush plans  to screen the whole U.S. for mental illness.   So with Bush's idea ... what's next -- forced psychoactive medications for children, adults, and elders ... how about forced lobotomies ... or better yet let's just put those poor bastards out of their misery.   It seems that this whole screening program is almost exclusively targeted to drug-treatments, so it comes as no surprise that it is endorsed by members of the American Psychiatric Association. In addition, it is also good to know that the big drug companies are contributing three times as much to Bush's campaign than to Kerry's. If this plan is ever implemented, the drug manufacturers will be the ones who will profit the most, especially since the newer and more expensive drugs will be used in this program's "state-of-the-art" treatment.

      Somehow I managed to get an "A" in my person-centered therapy class.  I figured I'd be bringing in tapes all summer long to prove I really do know how to empathsize with another and I really do know how to differentiate between point and story.  This is all thanks to Amy.  My last tape with her, my professor says, is my best yet.  Maybe it's because I know her so well or maybe it's because we discussed her points beforehand.  Or maybe I am just "that good".  We'll stick with that.    And to further remember this class and my experiences with that, I will forever be on video at the library for others to watch.  Unbeknownst to me, when I volunteered to do a counseling session that was video taped in front of my class, I didn't realize my session was going to be on display for others to watch.  And I wasn't the counselor, I was counseled.  So now everyone will be privy to my drama for years to come.  How nice.  At least I didn't cry.  Feel free to check it out.  Eat some popcorn.

      This week will be my fist week of training for my half marathon.  I went out and bought some new pink nike shoes and some pink soffe shorts.  At least I've got the attire for my new challenge.  And at least I'll look cute!    So I'm currently able to run two miles, okay almost two miles, and I've got to get up to 13 for the half marathon.  Now, I guess I could've prepared and started getting back into running last week, but did I? No, I spent the last week working on finishing a cake that I bought.  I did pretty good, I might add.  I ate it all.  It was tough, I had to eat two pieces of cake everday.  Now that's a challenge!

      Okay so I'm in the elevator going up to my apartment and I accidently get off on the 5th floor thinking it was my floor.  I'm walking to my apartment and I think to myself, hmmm they put up some signs while I was at work.  I get to my door, and I try to unlock it.  I don't realize I'm on the wrong floor til the people that live there open the door wondering whose trying to get in.  You can imagine how shocked I was to think these people were in my apartment! It was so embarrassing! Next time I'll be more observant and notice the big 5 on the wall.

      I saw the cutest guy today in my apartment complex.  I was in the parking garage going inside when I saw this guy in front of me carrying a handful of groceries.  So being the nice girl I am, I told him I'd get the door for him, but some other guy was going out as we were going in so I didn't have to.  Anyway as we were waiting for the elevator we talked and he asked me if I was a student.  Now this question wasn't out of the ballpark as I was carrying my backpack.  I said yes, but what I should've said is I'm a GRADUATE student, like it would make a difference! Anyway so here I am thinking wow, what a hot guy and he's talking to me. If only his name was Dr. Andrew Christensen.  But then like a blow to the face, I see it as he gets in the elevator, the little gold ring on his left hand.

      I don't quite understand.  How come in many instances, when something hurts us, we test it out to see if it'll keep on hurting us?  Maybe this happens more so with girls and less with guys, I don't really know.  When something is bothering me I'll keep ruminating over it, rehashing it, think about different scenarios, basically analyzing it to death.  Why?  What's the point, right? If I know by doing something I will feel sad or mad, why would I keep doing that thing, keep subjecting myself to that?  It's the same thought process of pinching yourself, thinking that hurts, and then pinching yourself again to see if the same feeling of pain will recur or if you will have different levels of severity.  Go for a drink and test this question out.  You know drinking in excess will hurt you, make you sick, but still you keep drinking and changing your intake to see how much or how little it'll hurt you.    I relate more so to listening to my friend's stories or thinking about my own personal experiences, than to drinking.  So many times I will hear from a friend, "why did I do that? I knew it would hurt me or make me sad."  We know our actions will sometimes hurt us, maybe from past experiences or maybe from our intuitions, but yet we still go down that path, time after time again.  Why can't we just realize that for the most part, in similiar situations, the results will be the same?  I read a quote somewhere that said something like insanity is taking the same actions and expecting different results.

      After hearing from a friend about  urlLink Team in Training , I've decided to join.  It's a charity organization that helps raise money for leukemia and lymphoma.  As a volunteer you agree to train and participate in a marathon or triatholon and raise a fundraising mininmum.  You get to train and participate in the marathon in the name of an honored patient that either you choose or is selected for you.  I'm actually extremely excited to get started on this.  Not only will it allow me to make some new friends, get in shape, but I will also be raising money for such a good cause.  Being a member will also allow me to go to a marathon in really awesome locations.  In the Fall you have a choice of participating in Maui, San Franciso, or Dallas.  Of course you have to raise more money to participate in Maui than San Francisco or Dallas.  It would be so gratifying to have raised the money on behalf of a patient to be able to run in Maui.  Wish me luck!

      Why is it that we want what we cannot have? Is it the fact we can't have it that makes us want it or do we really want that thing we can't have?  I was thinking about this as I was leaving class today.  Why can't we want things we  can  have?  Wouldn't it be nice to think, it sure would be nice to have a yellow shirt today to wear and then think, oh I have a yellow shirt?  Why is it that everyone searches for the things in their life that they don't or can't have and want them?  It's crazy.  No one goes to therapy because they are unhappy that they have all the things they wanted.  Most of the times, it's because something is missing that they can't or don't have.  For me, the thing that I want I can't have is to be married and have a dog and our own place.  Now, it's not really so much that I can't have that, I'm just not ready for that.  I'm not at that place in my life, it just sounds nice.  Really I also just want a dog and know I need someone else around to help me with it.  Would I be happy if I were no longer single? I don't know, I'd probably want a bigger house, a nicer husband, a baby, more money, etc.  So why can't I rejoice in my singlehood and live it fully?  I mean what could be better to be young, hot, and single? I'll never be all these three things again.  I know I'll always be hot :) What other point in my life can I have passionate sex with different guys every night?  Okay well maybe it would be passion less , but still.  I guess then I'd be a whore.  So why is it that we focus so much of our attention on the things we do not have?  Anyone know? It's like a car.  I get a new car, I've been wanting a new car, now I have this new car and it's dirty, it's losing it's new car smell, and now I'm ready for a new one.  I have an odd feeling I've heard this analogy before, but anyway I'm transgressing.  Why can't we all just be happy with all that we have in our lives at any given moment?  Okay well I degress.

      What a relief! I just finished my final counseling session tape assignment.  Final, hopefully being the keyword, that is, if the professor likes my efforts.  Which I think were good.  So to celebrate my efforts, I plan on going out drinking tonight with my old buddy Ryan who is back in town after graduating from Law School.  We both concur I need a drink or maybe two or three.  Also exciting on the agenda for this week is shopping.  Amy and I have made plans to go to the Galleria.  Shopping always makes me feel better.  Well, anyway Amy and I are really terrible influences on each other when it comes to shopping so it will be interesting to see how the dynamics have changed now that she is married and her husband won't allow her to buy anything.

      The state says (maybe) you must give your kids psychotropic drugs or go to jail!  June 7, 2004 — When Chad Taylor noticed his son was apparently experiencing serious side effects from Ritalin prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, he decided to take the boy off the medication. Now, he says he may be accused of child abuse.   This is absolutely absurd I think! Clearly some children do better taking psychotropic drugs such as Ritalin and because of the medicine, maintain a more controlled life style.  However, not all children are lucky enough to be side effect free and while they may be able to concentrate more and be more controllable, their phsyical health could be deteriorating.  So basically what is most important is the manageable child, not the healthy child.  And it's even more ridiculous to fine or send the parents to jail for not medicating their children.    Here is the  urlLink article  if you want to check it out.

      My sister and I went and looked at a puppy yesterday.  For all those that know me well, you know of my puppy phases.  Well, I had one yesterday.  I try to keep these impulses to myself because everytime I mention getting a puppy I'm never met with positive feedback.  Well, rarely I should say because the idea of getting a puppy sounded very good to my sister.  I doubt she knew she'd have to take care of it though.  She wants to be a vet anyway, so I figure she needs some practice.  Okay well we went to see this puppy in a real shady part of Dallas.  It was so bad, I really didn't want to get out of car and wished I had one of those clubs on my steering wheel.  We did get out though.  So we get to door and on this person's door is a sign that says, we live in a pacific environment, please come in, remove your shoes and stay awhile.  I never took my shoes off nor did my sister.  To go on with the story, we see the puppy, it's a chihuahua (however you spell it) that has the same markings of a rotweiller.  It was the cutest puppy, very unlike the owner.  The owner as well as the neighborhood, was also pretty shady.  So shady that we got kind of scared when he went back around the corner somewhere in his house, came back and shut the door and his shades in the room we were sitting in.  Now we should've got up and left, but being naive I guess we stayed and played with the puppy.  It just kept getting stranger though.  The owner said he was a retired federal police officer which is maybe why I stayed although he could've been lying.  I figured he wouldn't kill us anyway.  Well he goes on and talks about the dog, how they are so easy to train and while he is saying this, his older grown-up dog pees on the carpet.  How ironic! My sister and I just watched this other dog peeing, but the owner did not say anything about it.  On top of that, he kept putting the dogs paws in his mouth and it was not a pretty sight.  Needless to say, we did not end up getting the dog as I felt something just wasn't right with the whole scenario.  I also realized, maybe I shouldn't get a dog afterall.  Maybe a cat!

      So I went to the Angelika and saw  Saved  today.  The movie was actually really good I thought, very funny.  I would definitely recommend seeing it.  I would also definitely recommend seeing it at the Angelika.  How perfect is it to have a meal prepared to take into the theater with you?  On the downside, I wasn't able to eat their popcorn, but I did have a very good cheeseburger!  I would also recommend going to the Angelika as I just found out today, on a Tuesday.  Tuesdays are great if you have your student ID because for 5.50 you get a ticket and a free popcorn!  Had I known this sooner I would've been there every Tuesday!  Check out what's  urlLink playing , they have a lot of good films.

      So I was laying out with my friend today when we spotted two young girl friends that had matching bathing suits on.  I was asked if I ever did such things with my friends when I was younger and immediately responded no, thinking I was never that un-cool.  But then I got to thinking and realized I must be un-cool because not only did I have matching bathing suits with my friend, I also had matching watches, shoes, and clothes that we routinely wore on the same day. Now this doesn't sound bad, but this all did not occur when I was younger, it occurred last summer when I was working at the  urlLink Austin Nature and Science Center  with my friend  urlLink Amy  (she is the one in the middle).  Everyone thought we were crazy that summer!  You'd think it would be a perfect summer job.  All we had to do was walk a group of 7-8 year olds to  urlLink Deep Eddy  (a pool in Austin), swim with them, and walk them back all during the hours of 1-5.  It was actually the summer from hell.  If you like kids stepping on your feet, running into you, getting you dirty, splashing you, getting sweaty, and daily submersing yourself in freezing water you should call the Austin Nature and Science Center as I'm sure they are hiring.  Everyone else loved camp, but Amy and I, I think, loved to complain.  Oh and I also forgot Ben, the lovely boy we put up with that goes to T-State (as he calls it).  So Amy, this post is for you.  Hope you are having fun in Hawaii! I miss you!

      Okay so I went to Six Flags today, Friday, with my friend  urlLink Christina .  I was really looking forward to it as I hadn't been to Six Flags since Fall of 98 when I went with my boyfriend at the time to Holiday in the Park.  I really have great memories of this place, but none are just quite like the ones I have made today.  It was hot, I felt sick, I got all shaken up, I got a headache, I was sweaty, and the list continues.  Not only that, but did the seats get smaller or did I get bigger?  Christina and I are not big people, but let me just say on some of those rides I felt like sardines being packed in a can.  I also felt all my organs being rattled around.  Experiencing this, I realized why "grown-ups" never were too interested in riding the rides.  Who would want to subject themselves to this torture?  Okay maybe I'm being dramatic, but my memories of my past times at Six Flags did not hold up.  Maybe it was the corn dog we ate?  I will say this, if you do endeavour out and want to try Six Flags, you must ride the Titan and you must ride it BEFORE any food enters your stomach cavity.   urlLink The Titan , by far, is the best ride in the park.  Here is the link, you should check it out.  I would avoid Flash back, the Judge Roy Scream, the Texas Giant, and the Mine Train if you want to avoid back pain or getting jerked around.  I would also avoid the Superman ride unless you enjoy being twirled around like a cork screw.  I actually liked Superman despite blacking out for a moment.  Just kidding, it's not that bad.    Anyway my message is this:  Memories of fond times at an amusement park might not hold up presently.  Unless you like to sweat.

      So I did another counseling session today after work.  I was actually the client.  Of course I had drama to talk about.  Do I ever not? In anycase the counselor (my classmate) had absolutely no idea what I was saying. He was missing the points to what I was saying and when he did talk, as I didn't allow for him to talk much, he kept repeating, "sounds like this is a struggle for you....".  At the end of the session he told me I was very confusing and he had a hard time identifying my points.  He  also said he had a hard time not being directive with me and that he felt I had a lot of conflict inside about the subject so it was hard for him to comment.  Thanks!  The life of Rebecca Holtzman.  In anycase I'm meeting with this guy again on Saturday so I can be the counselor for him.  I'm a little nervous as he is from Spain and has an accent. This guy was actually on 99.5 The Wolf as Bachelor of the Year.  He said he was still on their website, but I've looked it up and can't seem to find him or I would've posted a pic.  He also brought up a point about those reality shows like the "Bachelor".  He claimed that they are just all actors and just acting because if they weren't there is no way they could've got that involved with each of the girls and really felt something for them.  My classmate said that he ended up having to quit when he started dating the 7th girl because it was just too hard and he was having way too much anxiety about it.  He felt as if it were a big game and they were all just players in it.  Some of the girls were in it for the wrong reasons and he just had trouble dating all these girls at once and emotionally he couldn't handle it.  Apparantly it was pretty bad for him as he had anxiety attacks for a little while after.  The Wolf 99.5 almost didn't let him quit.  They stated that's the price you pay for getting 3,000 dollars from us.  Craziness.

      How fun it is that a bunch of us have blogger sites! Now I can spend my time at work constantly checking to see if anyone updated or posted a new comment.  Hey I need stuff to fill my time at the realty place.  All I do is file, file, and then file some more.  I'm actually running out of things to file.  This is not good as I need to get my 14 hours of work in a week.  Now do I work all 14 hours? Not really.  Not so much.  Rarely do I even get in 14 hours, but I probably only actually do filing for about an hour and a half the whole 4-5 hours I'm there.  I'm gonna get fired I just know it.  Alicia can comment on my work ethic as she spoke to a previous boss of mine on one ocassion who totally bitched her out about me.  Oh well.  Sorry Alicia!

      I'm ready to either shoot myself or shoot my professor or maybe both.  How can giving empathic checking responses to a client be so difficult?  Apparantly it is.  I either probe too much or concentrate on the story too much.  I never would've thought person-centered therapy would be so difficult.  For all of us who had Van Wyatt as a professor, well apparantly he taught us wrong.  It's really hard staying totally with the client, not giving advice, not probing, and being able to understand them completely.  Just summing up the client, elaborating, or saying you feel scared is just not enough. Hopefully I'll figure this all out in the next few days as I'd like to pass the class.  Becoming a psychologist is not that easy! Wish me luck.

      Satellite television makes me crazy.  Whenever there is bad weather my television watching time is over.  Not that I watch t.v. much, but with the Dallas weather I'd like to know if I'm going to die because a tornado is coming my way.  I've actually really thought about this.   I'm on the 6th floor, what would I do?  Go down into the foyer on the 1st floor? I figure this place is all concrete, maybe I'll be okay.  I'm paying enough, it better protect me from a tornado.  I'm also apparantly paying for them to shoot an independent film here to be played at Sundance or something like that.  I was going down the elevator today and I got lucky enough to ride down with one of the actors.  Not that it was anyone famous.  The movie is called Hit something or actually it might not be called that at all.  I really don't remember now.  Oh well.

      Okay so now I have my own web page.  Pretty crazy, huh? The last web page I had was in my computer class at Southwest.  In fact, do some searching and you may be able to find it.  Don't look too hard, it's not that great.  Basically I created this page so everyone can know what's going on in my life because I know you all want to know.  Plus, you know I just didn't feel as special not having my own site.  So here it is.  Hope you enjoy!

      It's really nice living close to my family again.&nbsp; It's especially nice on nights like tonight when my mom is making ribs, augratin potatoes, other stuff, and ice cream pie.&nbsp; I'm very excited.&nbsp; However, paired with excitement is a little bit of negativity as my mom's sister will be in town.&nbsp; She's kind of odd so I tend to stay away from her.&nbsp; If it wasn't for the ribs,&nbsp;having to administer a&nbsp;test&nbsp;or my sister's beckoning to be there with her, I wouldn't be going home.  Although it's not like I have much else to do since as you all know, I'm broke.&nbsp; At least I know that my plans of studying, writing, and reading for class haven't been affected by my financial status.&nbsp; That sucks!  Well, I'm off to go home.&nbsp;

      I looked online at my bank account balance today.&nbsp; Waiting for that page to load is almost like waiting to see what you scored on an exam.&nbsp; It's not fun.&nbsp; So anyway thinking my account was still in the positive range, you can imagine my surpise to see I was in the hole by a -$290.&nbsp; I got charged 7 overdraft fees of 33 dollars each.&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; And all using my checkcard which I thought wouldn't let you charge something if you did not have any money in it.  So I go to my bank.&nbsp; I talk to the manager and tell him I thought I had overdraft protection and I didn't understand how I could be -290 dollars.&nbsp; He says I don't have overdraft protection and that he can only take off 3 of the charges, which is only 100 dollars.&nbsp; Anything is better.&nbsp; He's telling me this and I can feel the tears coming.&nbsp; I try my hardest not to cry, but here I am crying in his office, in the bank, in the grocery store.&nbsp; I was just so flustered and stressed from class that I guess I was in need of a good cry.&nbsp; I was so upset that I didn't even think to be embarrassed.&nbsp; Well I guess he felt sorry for me and told me to call him back in 3 weeks and he would take off the other 3, which would leave me with one overdraft fee.&nbsp; He explained that he didn't normally do this, but he would for only a few people and I would be one of them.  I still had to put my paycheck in the bank, but seeing as I was still crying I decided to put my sunglasses on and exit the store.&nbsp; I'm so thankful for this guy and I hope he remembers me in three weeks.&nbsp; It is just so frustrating when they charge me overdraft fees when I have money sitting in my savings account.&nbsp; Luckily this is the first time in the past year this has happened or I'd still be -290.&nbsp; It's my once a year ritual to get an overdraft fee.&nbsp; Only this year, it was way more than ever.  So now I'm off to class.&nbsp; What a wonderful day!

      So it's Monday, my day off, and I had to get up early.&nbsp; Never good.&nbsp; Well I didn't get up too terribly early, but since my body is now accustomed to sleeping in til 1030 or 11, getting up at 9 was hard work!&nbsp; And all for nothing! My sister spent the night last night and we had planned on getting up and going to IHOP for breakfast as we both had to get up early.&nbsp; She had a massage and I had an interview.&nbsp; So I get all dressed up and we go eat at IHOP.&nbsp; After IHOP, on my way to my interview I call my home number to see if I have any messages.&nbsp; I'm glad I did as it turned out my interview got cancelled and is rescheduled for tomorrow.&nbsp; Not bad.&nbsp; It means another work free day for Rebecca.&nbsp; I am really the worst employee.&nbsp; I'm surprised I still have a job.&nbsp;   Anyway on to other things.&nbsp; I ate out like 5 times since Friday for lunch.&nbsp; It's a lot of eating out, but out of all those 5 times, I only got decent service at one place I ate at.&nbsp; And I think that was at an ice cream place.&nbsp; Terrible!&nbsp; Waitstaff really makes me crazy sometimes!&nbsp; My sister says I get annoyed too easily.&nbsp; This may be true, but if the people didn't annoy me for some reason, I probably wouldn't be annoyed.&nbsp; We did get a free meal though at On the Border.&nbsp;   I also had the joy of meeting my sister's new dating partner last night as he lives close to me.&nbsp; And the kid really annoyed me.&nbsp; He would not shut up the whole time he was here.&nbsp; AND we were watching a movie.&nbsp; Maybe he was nervous, I don't know, but he got annoying after awhile.&nbsp; He's a nice kid though and my sister seems to like him.&nbsp; So I kept my mouth shut and I also had a beer.&nbsp; I felt better after the beer!  I should probably work on being nicer to people.&nbsp; I am a nice girl.&nbsp; I just get annoyed at stupid people.&nbsp; I really got to work on this as I'm positive I'll be talking to lots of stupid, crazy people in my field.

      I also learned a lot about geography tonight as both the girls I was with&nbsp; have traveled extensively.&nbsp; I'm really naive or ignorant about geography.&nbsp; I'm very much culturally ego-centric.&nbsp; As my friends said, I must not have paid much attention in my 9th grade geography class.&nbsp; But you know, I don't think I even took geography.&nbsp; I took it in 4th grade I know.&nbsp; But I doubt I did too well.&nbsp; On a question asking how big the Nile River was, I&nbsp;wrote "big".&nbsp; The preceding question asked about the size of another, smaller river and I wrote, "not so big".&nbsp; Obviously I doubt these were the answers my teacher was looking for.  In 1st grade my teacher was trying to teach the class about money and counting it.&nbsp; I,&nbsp; however, did not want any part in this.&nbsp; I told my teacher that I didn't want to count money.&nbsp; That my mom didn't use money, she used her credit card.&nbsp; Needless to say, a teacher-parent conference was scheduled.&nbsp; I still apparantly don't know how to count money as I spend way more than I have.&nbsp;   I don't really think I made a good impression with my friend's friend tonight.&nbsp; With the money, the geography, and the sharks.&nbsp; Yes, the sharks.&nbsp; She was telling me her stories of diving and I told her she was crazy and asked her if she saw any sharks? I told her and was adamant in doing so that sharks do eat people!&nbsp; And that I'd probably pass out and drown of fear if I ever dove.&nbsp; But I did try snorkerling once in 100 ft of water.&nbsp; I was very proud of myself.&nbsp; I didn't last long as the flippers started to hurt so my boyfriend had to swim and carry me back to the boat in 100 ft of water.&nbsp; Luckily we didn't drown.&nbsp; I also swam with stingrays in Grand Caymans.&nbsp; Don't ever do it.&nbsp; I went last summer and I literally cried I was so scared.&nbsp; My mom had to hold my sister and I and swim us back to the boat while my dad was laughing and feeding the stingrays right by us.&nbsp; It was, without a doubt, one of the scariest things I have ever done in my life.

      I went to South Lake today.&nbsp; Well really I drove through South Lake on my way to Keller.&nbsp; I'm expanding my awareness of the DFW metroplex.&nbsp; Anyway I'm glad to finally know what South Lake is.&nbsp; A few months back when I was dating Travis he mentioned going to South Lake with some of his friends.&nbsp; Not knowing what this was, I kept to myself, but assumed it was a restaurant.&nbsp; I imagined it to be like, for those of you familiar with Austin, Oasis or Hula Hut.&nbsp; Glad to know it's a city.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a nice place I will say.  I also went to Red Robin.&nbsp; For those of you familiar with my favorite show, Newlyweds, Jessica Simpson ate there.&nbsp; So when I found out that my friend lived near one, I just had to go.&nbsp; It was good.  On another note, it's a good thing I darkened my hair today as I so was a dumb blonde.&nbsp; Everyone says it's not good to talk about money, politics, and something else, but I can't remember now the other one.&nbsp; But I figure, whatever comes to my mind is good to talk about.&nbsp; So I did.&nbsp; So when this girl I was with started talking about money, I chimed in.&nbsp; Apparantly her uncle is this guy that ran for president a few years ago.&nbsp; John McCain.&nbsp; I don't remember him.&nbsp; The name sounds familiar though.&nbsp; Anyway she told us that she has a trust fund that she can't touch yet, but has a good amount of money in it.&nbsp; Of course, I'm curious so I ask how much?&nbsp; She wouldn't answer,&nbsp; but said it was enough.&nbsp; This girl is so trashy.&nbsp; That's not the point though.&nbsp; The point is this.....I have no qualms discussing my broke ass financial status, so why should anyone else?&nbsp;   Okay so maybe money talk is not good.&nbsp; So lets talk about me.&nbsp; Again it's good I'm a brunette.&nbsp; I was looking at this German calendar and was looking at the wording for the days of the week.&nbsp; Well the first two, Sunday and Monday I saw in German.&nbsp; But when I read the other days, I read them in English and said, "Wow, Tuesday-Saturday are the same in English as they are in German".&nbsp; My friend just kind of looked at me funny and said, "Rebecca that's in English, that's not German".&nbsp; It's time like these when I say, "yeah I'm getting a doctorate".

      I'm exhausted.&nbsp; I am so worn down.&nbsp; I am really getting tired of all this reading and projects I have to do for class.&nbsp; Last night we tried to get the professor to bag the quizzes, but he said, "I know this sounds parental, but I don't want to require any less of you.&nbsp; I want you to still put your "A" game face on and even though you may hate all this reading and 14 pages of note taking, I hope you'll thank me for making you put this much effort into this class.&nbsp; At least when you go off to practicum and internship you'll remember more than the person who didn't take 14 pages of notes on each chapter".&nbsp; Blah, Blah, Blah.&nbsp; Yeah I thank him.&nbsp; He did give us an option, well not really, it was more so an illusion of an option.&nbsp; He said that if we don't like our quiz grades we can take a final.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; My average on the quizzes thus far is a 90, but after yesterdays quiz, which I'm sure I got a 4, it's gonna go down.&nbsp;   So this weekend I've got probably 12 hours of work to put in.&nbsp; I'm not kidding.&nbsp; I wish I was.&nbsp; Great way to spend the weekend, but I know in the end all this hard work will pay off.&nbsp; I also won't have friends anymore as my social life is disappearing.&nbsp;&nbsp;   To prepare myself, tonight I'm gonna get drunk.&nbsp; So drunk I pass out.&nbsp; No, not really.&nbsp; But I am gonna go to Blue Mesa for happy hour for free quesadillas and then I'm going to Dukes Roadhouse for Texas State happy hour.&nbsp; I've only been once and I feel bad because I've been trying to hang out with my friend Matt who I met there, but it just never works.&nbsp; I forgot about our plans once already and stood him up.&nbsp; I know, it's terrible.&nbsp; Anyway I already know dating a Matt is not good as he is Matt number 14, so I don't feel too bad about it.&nbsp; Plus he's like thirty something.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shouldn't he be married and not galavanting around with a 24 yr old? I think so.&nbsp;  Okay well as I said, I'm exhausted, so I'm gonna go take a nap.&nbsp; Yesterday I tried to take a nap til I got interrupted by a phone call! Aargh!

      Is it nap time yet?&nbsp; I'm thinking about taking a nap.&nbsp; It's 130, I don't have class til 6, and all I have to do is make notes on my reading.&nbsp; I think I will take a nap.&nbsp;   I'm probably tired because I just got back from working out.&nbsp; I went to the JCC earlier today to work out and I was the youngest one there.&nbsp; In fact, my dad would've been the youngest one there.&nbsp; I think I'll avoid going during the high elder traffic time.&nbsp; Plus one of them pissed me off! I was going to the elipitical machine and this guy on the other one says I need to go sign up for it.&nbsp; I was like okay, whatever and I did it.&nbsp; I come back and he's like it just really makes it easier on everyone.&nbsp; Like someone can't see I'm on it and decide to go to another machine? Okay I'm over that.  So I'm on the eliptical machine and this girl, Erica, who works there comes up and talks to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would've been just fine listening to my tunes and working out.&nbsp; Actually she's a nice girl, but rather annoying at times.&nbsp; Anyway she proceeds to tell me about her boobs and her bathing suit drama.&nbsp; How her boobs got bigger, well not bigger she says, wider and so they hang out of her suit.&nbsp; I personally&nbsp;couldn't see a difference in her boobs, but I&nbsp;didn't want&nbsp;to stare.&nbsp; And honestly I don't care about her boobs.&nbsp; I'm thinking, however, maybe I need to do the stuff she's doing.&nbsp; I want bigger boobs!&nbsp; So she keeps talking, I give her my best blank stare, throw in a few head nods, uh-huhs, I understands, and keep working out.&nbsp; She even invites me to help her with her bathing suit hunt.&nbsp; How I would've loved to go!&nbsp; So over the course of the next 10 minutes, she's still talking, and I'm not listening.&nbsp; After talking she feels better.&nbsp; I'll make a good psychologist, huh?  Anyway on my way out I run into this girl that works at the front desk that I talk to every now and again.&nbsp; I don't know her name.&nbsp; I walk up to her and notice she's staring at my legs.&nbsp; Odd.&nbsp; I ask her if she's coming up here to work out and she says yes.&nbsp; She said she needs to get in shape and I said I understand.&nbsp; Not really, I said me too.&nbsp; Anyway she's still staring, not blatantly, and says at least you have cute legs.&nbsp; I'm like okay thanks.&nbsp; Was I supposed to say you have cute legs too? Anyway I feel odd since she's still staring at my legs so I say well I've got to go.&nbsp; As I was walking off I saw her turn around and look at my legs.&nbsp; Now I have a complex about my legs.&nbsp; Thanks.  Okay I think I will go take a nap now.

      I'm at work this morning; I've been here for about an hour and a half and I think I'm done working.&nbsp; The papers that need to be filed are dissipating so I think I'm gonna take a break.&nbsp; Why overwork myself anyway? Although who am I kidding--- this job is not overworking by any means. &nbsp; I was thinking I need to be nicer.&nbsp; On Sunday three guys, two in a period of twenty minutes, told me I had on a cute skirt.&nbsp; That it was the perfect skirt to wear on a summer day.&nbsp; My reply was something like, okay thanks.&nbsp; No conversation from me.&nbsp; It's not that they were unattractive.&nbsp; They were attractive.&nbsp; I just didn't think about it.&nbsp; Really I think they must be gay.&nbsp; I mean really, what straight guy is gonna come up to you and tell you, you are wearing a cute skirt?&nbsp; I guess maybe a straight guy that thinks you're cute.&nbsp; And I am, so that doesn't surprise me :) &nbsp; I think there is something wrong with me.&nbsp; I went to a party on Saturday at a friend's house and didn't even ask if there were going to be cute guys there.&nbsp; Needless to say, there were not any.&nbsp; But still.&nbsp; Normally I ask these things.&nbsp; Either I'm a lesbian or I'm okay with being single.&nbsp; Well wait....I didn't ask if there were any cute girls there either so I guess I'm okay. &nbsp; I did run into a cute guy in the elevator today.&nbsp; He'd be cuter if he was shorter and a little fatter.&nbsp; Okay maybe he wasn't all that cute.&nbsp; And of course, I looked trashy.&nbsp; I don't know why I can't keep this dressing up thing going.&nbsp; I always notice more people looking at me when I dress up.&nbsp; Okay maybe it's only Mexicans, and those big fat guys, but still.&nbsp; But who wouldn't want them looking at you? They're hot!

       So I found out tonight that I don't have a practicum site afterall.&nbsp; Apparantly the psychologist got fired and possibly the clinic is closing down.&nbsp; Of course it would be my luck that I pick a place like this.&nbsp; I wouldn't have even known until my dad called me and told me the psychologist called him and told my dad the news.&nbsp; My dad approves/denies procedures for this clinic and several others so luckily the psychologist was able to get ahold of him to let me know.&nbsp; I don't know the whole story as I just heard that part from my dad.  This is great.&nbsp; Fortunately it is still early and I have some time to look.&nbsp; I wasn't dead set on going to this clinic as I still had some other options and I still do.&nbsp; I'm just waiting for my professor to contact&nbsp; them.&nbsp; You can bet that my professor will be getting an email of urgency to do so.&nbsp; Hopefully my dad has some other connections and I've also found some other places outside of the pain and rehabilitation field.&nbsp;   At least I got a new dress and the classy look for my interviews.&nbsp; I plan on checking out the Denton MHMR this week and maybe something will come out of that.&nbsp; Although I wouldn't be too thrilled to have to drive on I-35 three days a week.&nbsp; I guess it wouldn't be so bad if I decided to take some extra classes at UNT.  Speaking of, I've decided I'm going to be in school my whole life.&nbsp; I didn't realize, but after internship, residency or a post doc fellowship is an option.&nbsp; After or maybe simultaneously is another post doc in psychopharmacology so I can prescribe psychotropic medicine.&nbsp; Provided that Texas passes and implements the law, but I can't say for sure I'll even be living in Texas.&nbsp; That post doc is two years.&nbsp; I also have been thinking of getting my J.D.&nbsp; I know you think I'm crazy, but it would allow me to be an expert in forensics or other things.&nbsp; My dad is an expert witness and let me tell you, the pay is not too shabby.&nbsp; Who know's if I'll actually do this.&nbsp; It's a minimum of&nbsp;three years away.&nbsp; I doubt my parents would be too happy to know they'll be supporting and paying for my education for many more years.&nbsp; Although my father wasn't self sufficient until he was in his lower thirties with all the schooling he did.&nbsp; Everyone says I'm young and now is the time to be in school so I might as well.&nbsp; I'm not very competitive though so I don't know about law school.&nbsp; A few of us are thinking of doing it and from what I've heard, U of H is very diversified and would be a good place.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; We'll see.&nbsp; It's fun throwing out my options and seeing all the paths I could take.  Okay now for some ice cream.

      I can't remember as I'm too old, but dating in High School didn't seem so bad.&nbsp; My sister disagrees.&nbsp; Her and her boyfriend, Trevor, of three years broke up a few weeks ago.&nbsp; I have a lot of respect for her because she handles it so incredibly well!&nbsp; If it were me, I'd probably cry myself to sleep every night.&nbsp; My sister is the stong emotioned one.&nbsp; I am not.&nbsp; I can muster up some tears anytime, any place, anywhere.&nbsp; It's what I do!  &nbsp;  Anyway now she's on the prowl looking for others.&nbsp; She joined this internet dating site called the dilly that her friend joined.&nbsp; This scares me.&nbsp; Her first guy she met&nbsp;is 21.&nbsp; His name&nbsp;is Nate.&nbsp; Why a 21 year old would have any desire to be with a High School Senior is beyond me.&nbsp; It brings me back to a memory of mine though.&nbsp; After Travis and I broke up he immediately, well 3 months later, started dating a college freshman named Tara.&nbsp; Why else would a senior date a freshman? Anyway Ashley and I spent many conversations figuring out how we'd check this girl out.&nbsp; Our final idea was to go to the dorms and sell girl scout cookies in hopes she'd answer the door.&nbsp; Don't worry, we didn't really do this.&nbsp; I did end up seeing her.&nbsp; In a picture he kept by his bed.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  Back on the topic.&nbsp; So this Nate guy lives in Fort Worth and they've gone out to some live music places in Deep Ellum together.&nbsp; The next guy she met is named Ben.&nbsp; She took me with her to meet him.&nbsp; He works at Pluckers so yesterday we went and checked him out.&nbsp; He's actually cute.&nbsp; If he were 5 years older, I'd date him.&nbsp; He goes to UNT though.&nbsp; My poor sister can't meet anyone that lives semi-close to her.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Luckily she'll be 18 soon so I plan on taking her out.&nbsp; Although there aren't too many places that are 18 and up.&nbsp; Anyway if you feel like checking her out, this is her  urlLink profile  on the dilly.

      Bye, bye blonde, hello brunette!&nbsp; I decided to darken my hair today and I really love it!&nbsp; It's really dark, darker than my natural hair color I think.&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; The depth of color is definitely a lot richer than my normal dark brown hair color.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I guess I'm the odd ball.&nbsp; Normally people go darker in the winter and lighter in the summer.&nbsp; But, you know, who cares really?&nbsp; I think I look like a totally different person and it's a lot of fun!&nbsp; I've finally gone from trashy to classy!&nbsp; I've got the pearl earrings, the bleached white teeth, the trendy clothes (okay well some), and the runner's body (okay well I'm still working on that one).&nbsp; I'm just waiting for my pearl necklace.&nbsp; Mom? &nbsp; If only I can keep this image up.&nbsp; I guess it means&nbsp;goodbye to my old, faded blue Baby-G watch.&nbsp; This is definitely not classy.&nbsp; And I guess it means goodbye to my carlos n charlies shirt I wear every other day.&nbsp; My mom and my sister will breathe a sigh of relief on those two.&nbsp; Maybe she can take me shopping? Or maybe I could just go shopping on her credit card? Doubtful.&nbsp; Or maybe I'm just full of crap.&nbsp; It's hard to be classy....it takes a lot of work.&nbsp; At least I have classy hair.&nbsp; That'll do for now.&nbsp; I'll just raid my friend Amy's closet.&nbsp; She always dresses classy.&nbsp; Where do you think I get my sense of style from?!

      I said in&nbsp;a previous post that I tried on a Harry Winston ring that was $175,000.&nbsp; The ring was $165,000 and that particular ring was not a Harry Winston.&nbsp; Just wanted to clarify that.&nbsp; Who really cares what kind of ring it is at $165,000 a pop though.&nbsp; I should've kept it on longer, but I was afraid I would break it and my mom looked nervous!

      The apartment hunt is finally over.&nbsp; My mom and I decided I would just stay here and re-new my lease for two more years.&nbsp; This is nice as I was not too excited about having to pack up all my crap.&nbsp; I really love the area and I know without a doubt I wasn't going to find anything comparable to where I'm living, especially for the amount I wanted to pay.&nbsp; For some reason, my overly gracious mother rationalized she would rather help me out with the difference, since I will be unemployed, than have me move.&nbsp; I won't complain.&nbsp; I'd be sad to move.&nbsp; Plus I've noticed a plethora of hot babes in the building lately.&nbsp; Particularly the one that lives on my floor.&nbsp; But.....I don't think living in the same place is the best idea.&nbsp; What happens if you break up? That would suck to see the ****** everyday.&nbsp; :)  &nbsp;  I'm not  just  seeing the babes at my complex.&nbsp; I'm seeing them at the JCC too.&nbsp; I guess I forgot about them since I haven't been in awhile.&nbsp; It made me feel especially good when I was approached by some&nbsp;guys at the gym and asked why I hadn't been in awhile.&nbsp; What could be better than for a guy to be hot, wealthy, and Jewish?&nbsp; My dad sure wouldn't complain.&nbsp; Not that I care about the Jewish part.&nbsp; But hot  and  wealthy is always an added benefit!&nbsp; I've got those two qualities down between the JCC and my complex.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So  of course  I notice all these potentials when I have no desire to be involved with anyone.&nbsp; That's how life works though, right?&nbsp; I'm in a good spot; not yearning for anything in my past and not worrying about what I want in the future.&nbsp; I'm happy.&nbsp; It's good to be Rebecca Holtzman!&nbsp; I feel like I have everything I need and everything I want.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For today anyway.&nbsp; Ask again tomorrow.&nbsp; There is this skirt I want.&nbsp;

      Have you ever been so excited to get a new CD that when you get home you just want to turn the music on real loud and sing to it?&nbsp; Well, that's how I felt about the new Seether CD.&nbsp; The song is old, but I really love the song "Broken".&nbsp; As soon as I got home, I blasted it on my stereo and sang it over and over again.&nbsp; Okay, I know you're thinkin' that's a little OCD and you're probably right!  &nbsp;  Here are the words so you can join my fun and sing along too.....  I wanted you to know I love the way you laugh  I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away  I keep your photograph and I know it serves me well  I wanna hold you high and steal your pain  &nbsp;  Chorus:&nbsp; Because I'm broken when I'm open and I don't feel like I'm strong enough  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I'm broken when I'm lonesome and I don't feel right when you've gone away  &nbsp;  The worst is over now and we can breathe again  I wanna hold you high- you steal my pain away  There's so much left to learn and no one left to fight  I wanna hold you high and steal your pain.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      This past weekend my mom and I went and had our jewelry appraised.  Not that I have much jewelry and not that my jewelry is that expensive, but for some reason my mom wanted it all appraised.  I didn't mind.  Any chance I have to go to the jewelers and try on rings is good with me.  So anyway of course when I'm there, I try on some pretty gems.  My first choice started at a little over 1000 and gradually made its way to 6000.  As my mom says, I have a good eye for expensive jewelry! She taught me well!  Anyway after I tried on the rings I liked, the jeweler showed me one more.  This ring wasn't any old ring.  It had to be kept in a safe because it was 175,000.  Now why he offered to show us the ring and why he offered to let me try it on, god only knows.  But I will say, that is the first and the last time that finger will ever have 175,000 dollars on it! The ring wasn't very attractive though. As my mom said, it looked like one you'd pick up at a garage sale and pay 50 cents for.  It was one of those huge rings that Jennifer Lopez would wear.  I think it was a Harry Winston ring, but I don't remember now.  All I could think about at the time was the amount of money I had on my finger.  The moral of this story is that you should check out those garage sales and look for those huge, ugly rings.  You never know what you might be paying 50 cents for!

      Mental note.  Remember to wear deoderant when you go running.   You know, running makes me feel really good.  It's hard and I have to push myself to keep on going. I enjoy this challenge.  It's like class.  It's hard, it's kicking my butt, but I'm taking the challenge and succeeding.  It's a great feeling to know that I'm putting in all this effort into so many aspects of my life.    I really don't have a choice though.  In two years I'll be competing with all the doctoral level students across the board going into internship.  This is scary!  I'm not about competition, but I guess I have to be.  Especially competing with those from Ivey league Universities.  My Dad has got the referrals for the DFW area.  My half brother,  urlLink Kevin , is a psychologist practicing at Yale so maybe that'll help.  And then I have a cousin on my dad's side, Dr. Sheldon Brown, who is a child psychologist in Chicago.  Luckily I have some connections.  I just need to get my name out there and hopefully this will happen when I get involved in research in the Fall.  Now, if only I could put this effort into dressing a little bit better!  I've decided I'm going to change my hair color again.  I don't like my hair color now and haven't really since the day I got it done.  I was hoping it would fade, but no.  I think I'm going to go back to my natural hair color and be dark again.  I really like that look anyway.  I think it's classy.  And I need to be classy.  And a little less trashy!

      Mental note.  Do not go running in a tube top bathing suit top.  (Is that redundant?) I thought I had a good idea to wear my bathing suit top under my shirt when I went and worked out so when I finished I could just go right out to the pool.  Bad idea.  I had to hold my bathing suit top up the whole time I was running for support.  I don't have big boobs or anything, but man just remember for future reference not to run in a tube top.  It's great for tan lines, bad for running.  Mental note.  Do not turn in graduate level work that is not typed.  Normally I wouldn't, but I was coerced.  Not really, but my classmate said she was going to turn her's in handwritten so being the follower I am, I decided to as well.  Also, watch out for pronouns.  I don't even know what those are, but watch out for them!  When you are typing about a "she" make sure you type out "she" and not "their" and "has" instead of "have".  And also instead of typing "may be faking good".  Type "may have underreported psychopathology". Where's an editor when I need one? :)  Mental note.  Stop dressing like ass.  For the past almost two months I have dressed like ass.  It's more fun to dress up when you have someone to dress up for.  Although I think I'm going about this all wrong.  For the second time I've run into this guy that lives on my floor looking like ass.  Well, the first time I think I looked decent, which is good because I met his friends.  Okay, well I happened to be in the elevator at the same time as them and we talked.  I didn't really meet them.  Then today, looking like ass again, I see the guy again.  Today I really looked hot.  I had on an old Southwest Texas t-shirt, blue work out shorts, a hat, and flip flops.  I had on no make-up and I'm sure still had the remnats of black mascara under my eyes as I was too lazy to get it all off.  But what did I care, I was going to campus.  No hot guys there.  We actually did talk on the elevator.  He's pretty cute.  Kind of nerdy, but I like those types.  It's best for the guy to be hot, but not know he's hot.  So anyway, I should probably stop dressing like ass.  Mental note.  Take better notes on what I've read.  I had class yesterday and I probably scored a 2 out of 10.  Not so good.  Especially since I already got a 5 on the first quiz, which I planned to drop.  My friend and I were joking in class that if we answered "yes" to the question that asked if it was possible for a client to present an inaccurate self-description on the MMPI and if so, why, would we get 1 point?  I would hope.  I gave an explanation, but it was wrong.  I did, however, say yes.  I felt pretty good about the quiz we got back yesterday though.  I got a 9 out of 10 and the class mean was only a 6.5.  Good job, Rebecca!    No more mental notes.

      I picked up the lasted Cosmo magazine (the girl's bible) and came across a section entitled, "cosmo for your guy", that I thought I'd share.  The information I am going to divulge in is VERY important, so guys, especially sexually active guys, READ ON!  "No doubt your sex life with your girlfriend is already pretty rockin'.  But even so, to really blow her mind, there are some things you should pay close attention to.  See, while you're getting it on, she's probably taking mental notes of what you're doing.  IF she can give you a big gold star in certain areas, you'll secure your sex god status.  Just ask yourself the following questions.....  Do you initiate nooky equally?  Sure it's great when a woman jumps on top of you.  But you  both need to have an equal role.  "When you make the first move, she feels sexier and more desirable".-----I agree!  Does she have an O more often that not?  "Many women have a conflict about putting their own needs first.  The result:  She'll tell you to just go ahead without her.  But do you really think she doesn't want an orgasm? By trying your best to make it happen for her, it shows that you care about her sexual needs.  Do you shake things up in the sack?  If it ain't broke, don't fix it, right? Wrong! She's going to get bored if the sex is too predictable,  even  if it's pleasureable.  Do you kiss during sex?  In the heat of passion, you might be so caught up that you completely forget to kiss your girl.  But you'll earn points if you make it a priority to plant a few on her".  Okay well now you have it.  I hope you can be her best (ever!) in bed!

      As I was laying in bed the other night I was trying to picture in my mind how it would be when I was older and married and had kids.  I tried to picture myself driving to work and all that kind of stuff.  I couldn't though.  Sure I pictured a car driving to a building.  Of course I was driving a Range Rover.  Then I tried to picture my home.  If any of you have seen Unfaithful, I pictured their home as my home.  As for my husband and I in bed.  I pictured a scene from the movie, Family Man.  I couldn't actually see myself, my husband, or my kids.  I wasn't able to imagine a scenario in my mind.  I could imagine my life right now in my head, but as for years down the road I use other images.  I'm excited though for the day I have these things although I'm not in that much hurry. I like to torture my boyfriends with the idea of a little Rebecca running around.  For some reason I get a lot of cringes.  I don't know why really.  I'm a great girl!  We'd each have matching Louis Vuitton purses! Wouldn't that be so cute?!  I think so.  And if I had a boy I'd dress him up all cute too.  His name would be Andrew.  He'd be a ballerina.  Just kidding.

      I decided to be a follower.  We all know I am though.  After reading  urlLink Travis'  blog and  urlLink Ashley's  blog I decided to post this evil quiz on mine as well so all my viewers could test their evilness.  Plus I just didn't know what else to post.  Anyway I scored a 33, not so bad.  Ashley scored a 43, which I already knew she was evil so it didn't surprise me and then her boyfriend  urlLink Jason  scored a 61.  Birds of a feather flock together! Just kidding.  No, I'm not.  Travis scored a 45 and Christina scored a 32.  Everyone should take the quiz and leave me a comment so I can assess your evil doings!  Check it out! Just click this  urlLink link .

      I went to work today.  In fact, 4 hours later, I'm still at work.  This is pretty amazing! I'm actually working 7 hours today.  Anyway as most of you know or will now, I don't dress up to go to work.  Most of the times it's jeans, a t-shirt, and flip flops, but sometimes even worse than that it's work out pants and a t-shirt.  So, when I came to work today, I got a lot of stares.  The reason being, I decided to wear a skirt today.    Now I have a complex thanks to those I work with.  This one guy asked me why I chose to wear a skirt today and said I looked really nice.  Why  did I  choose to wear a skirt? All my other clothes were dirty and my "dress clothes" I rarely wear, were clean.  So now I'm all conscious about my dress.  Do I wear a skirt again on Tuesday when I come in or do I go back to my normal "white trash" get-up?

      I guess I figured out how to read mass quantities accurately as I scored a 10 out of 10 possible points on quiz #2.  Hopefully quiz #3 last night will result in that again.  I need all the points I can get since I only scored a 5 out of 10 points on the first quiz.  Luckily we can drop our lowest quiz grade.  I'm actually really enjoying my educational endeavours this summer term.  The class is so interesting despite the work load that I have to put into it.  And it's a lot.  It took three hours just to interpret, by hand, the validity of the MMPI for just one protocol.  Don't be confused, I'm not complaining.  I'm actually enjoying the tasks and while I appreciate the educational value of hand scoring the protocols, it will be nice when computer scoring is used in the real world. It's so interesting putting together all the pieces of the puzzle and coming up with a distinct picture of the person.  Maybe I'm becoming a nerd, but I accept it.    I called about another practicum site yesterday.  Apparantly all I needed to say was that my father referred me, thinking it would be a good practicum site.  It also probably helps that my father approves medical/psychological procedures for this site.  I called them a few weeks ago asking if they had any opportunities to host a practicum student and they responded no.  So this time around I mentioned good old dad and the Doctor called me back within 15 minutes.  Thanks dad!  I think I'm doing pretty good as most of my classmates are still trying to find a practicum site for the Fall.  I'm also opening doors for other practicum students for later semesters.  How altruistic of me! Well...

      I took the MMPI a year ago in one of my classes, but didn't really analyze my results much as the class wasn't too indepth.  Having more knowledge and being in a class that strictly looks at the MMPI, I'm able to analyze my results more.  There's nothing more exciting for me than to take an indepth look and analyze myself!   My score resulted in a high scale 4, which is psychopathic deviate, and pretty much a normal range of scores for the other 9 scales. Apparantly others that also score high on scale 4 are criminals, psychologists, and pastors.  It's great being in the same category as criminals.  Basically the three groups all utilize their empathy to connect with others, but the reasoning is different.  Criminals do so to manipulate others while psychologists do so to help others.  Yeah, yeah whatever I can say to make myself sound better.  I know what you're thinking!  My scores also depicted a person that was gregarious, outgoing, and needed to be around others.  Also a person that does not tolerate boredom well, does not feel the need to be precise or double check things, is trusting.  It even made a hypothesis about my relationships.  I can't remember all it said as I don't have my book, but when I get home I'll post an entry all about myself!  I plan to take the test again as it's been over a year. I just wish I could take a test to depict what my cognitive abilities are.   I suppose I could, but I doubt they'd be accurate as I've given the tests before and know the answers.

      I went to class last night and found out I only got 5 out of 10 possible points on the quiz.  It was my first quiz.  Not so good.  I wasn't too happy.  But I do know I didn't score the lowest.  I figure I'm right in the middle since he said our grades were all over the distribution scale and he wasn't too pleased.  He's going to let us use notes now.  It's always nice to know I'm failing my doctoral level class after just one class.   We did take a quiz last night and I think I did pretty good on that one.  Let's hope anyway.  I think I figured out how to read such mass quantities.  I asked my dad how he does it.  How he reads stuff he has no baseline knowledge for.  He said he looks up the stuff he doesn't know, does research on it, and then reads.  This is entirely too much work.  Although maybe I need to put more effort into my studies.  It's difficult though since all my friends are out of school and I want to do things with them.  I've noticed that my classmates seem to be doing a lot more than I.  I'm what you call an achiever.  I do all that I have to and not more.  They are what you call over achievers.  Maybe I need to be one.  I should be one.  I was so scared I wouldn't get accepted into my program and now that I'm in it, I'm not putting in much effort.  I do well in class, but I've never had to put much effort in it.  I figure I should probably put more time and effort into this educational process.  Besides who would want to see a psychologist that only half-ass got what they should've out of their education?

      I must be crazy! Especially since I thought I was going to die the previous weekend tubing.  I tried wake boarding yesterday.  I was pretty proud of myself when I was the first of the girls to volunteer to try it.  I figured if my sister can do it, maybe I can.  She made it look easy, but uh, it's not so much.  Somehow I was able to get up the first time, but my next attempts I was not able to get up at all.  I think I could've, but really the thought of being pulled by a boat on a wake board going fast kind of scares me.  It's not a nice thought to think I'm gonna hit the water, if I fall, at the same speed the boat is going.  Basically I'm afraid of getting hurt.  I'm just a big baby.  I did try though and I'm really happy I can say that.  I think I'll stick to dance, tennis, and swimming as competitive sports.  Not that I'm competitive at any of these things or good for that matter.  Anyway all the fun in the sun left me with soreness and sun burn, but it was definitley worth it!  Hope everyone had a safe and fun Fourth of July! Unfortunately, today is another day back to class for me leaving me with lots of reading.  The joys of getting an education!

      I know I said earlier that I got a practicum site at Positive Pain Management in Garland.  I still have it, but I also have some other options.  Another practicum site is at a place called Pride in Arlington.  It's the same type of work-- pain management and rehabiliation.  However, the woman who I spoke to sounds scary!  And yet another one at the Denton MHMR clinic.  I'm not sure exactly of the type of work at the MHMR, but it would probably just be testing and counseling.    Anyway I decided it would be best to tour some sites instead of picking just one and sticking with that since I'll be stuck there for a full school year.  This could be bad if I hated it and I hated who I worked with.  And I would know this as I hated my practicum site before I transfered out of my last program at Texas State.  I also know I need to jump on these options as I'm competing with many universities and few positions.    So this leads me to my next question--- Where to live?  I know I don't want to live in Garland, Denton, or Arlington.  Garland is trashy, Arlington has too much crime from what I've heard, and Denton, well, Denton is just not as exciting as Dallas.  My prime choice is Addison.  And further North, I think it's North, would be Lewisville, and that's as far as I'd want to go I think.  I did look at some places to live in Lewisville 2 years ago and they have some nice places.  I'm not sure of the areas around Arlington, but uh I just don't think I want to live there.  Either way I guess I should prepare myself for a drive whereever I do decide to live.  Preferably I'll live close to my practicum as I'd be driving there more than I would to class.  Plans for next week include tour three practicum sites.

      I was driving home tonight and decided to take the Tollway to Mockingbird instead of Northwest Highway to Mockingbird.  As I was driving down Mockingbird it amazed me as to how many people leave their shades open and have the lights on in their house.  Do they want people looking in at all their goods?  I could even see one guy sitting in his chair watching television!    This isn't so bad.  When I get to my building,  urlLink Mockingbird Station , you might as well stand outside and look into all the apartments to see all their goods.  It's a good thing I'm on such a high floor on the other side of the building!  I'm sure everyone still gets a peep show, but it's a nice false sense of security to think that I really do have privacy!  You should check out the site, you can actually view each of the floor plans.

      It looks like we're gonna have to take a final.  Off the bat, my first quiz is below an 83.  There were only 5 questions to get a total of 10 points and I missed the first one.  I probably missed more.  I know I got the question about reliability and validity.  I also know I got the question about clinicians and psychometricians and the one about how the MMPI was formed.  Well, I might have got the question about how the MMPI was formed.  And I might have got the question about a T-score.  I, uh, said that to be clinically significant on the MMPI you had to have a T-score of 65.  Well, this is wrong.  In general though I think I got the idea of it.  We'll see.  At least you can drop your lowest quiz grade. And at least I'm not the only one who didn't know the first question.  I made up some answer so maybe I'll get 1 point out of 2.    I've really got to start paying attention in class more.  The girl sitting next to me asked me if I was in love after seeing a colorful page of hearts.  It's difficult though to pay attention for a whole 3 hour class.

      1. My last day of work is August 27th! 2. I'm OCD, but it's good. My professor said everyone in graduate school has to be obsessive-compulsive or they wouldn't make it through. 3. I have 40+ apartments written down to call closer to my move date. (OCD, huh?) 4. What's up with the Dallas hair? 5. Affect or effect? 6. Open Water or Little Black Book? 7. Should I tell my mom I bought two skirts on her credit card for a total of 112 dollars now or should I wait til after she gets the bill? They're nice skirts. My first purchases ever from Ann Taylor 8. I won't be getting a stipend at my practicum. The Dr. said, "You probably think you know a lot of things, but you don't." (Where in the hell does the stupid (.) go?) "If you had a masters degree I would consider giving you a stipend. I came through as well straight from undergrad and I didn't get paid practicums." That's nice, but if I were his supervisor, I would've given him a stipend so I should get one too. 9. Is it hot in here? I've got the air on. Am I going through early menopause? Hot flashes! 10. How is it that my electric bill for an 800sq ft apartment is 90 dollars? 11. Do obese people look in the mirror on certain days and think, man I look good today? This would only explain why some "heavy" people choose to wear clothes tighter than I would. 12. My sister is dating another boy in Denton. Who is 21. She is 17. 13. What's up with guys these days? 14. What's up with this post?

      I'm not going to look at any apartments today.  There's no point, really.  It is too early.  And it just makes me crazy.  I mean who knows what kind of specials they'll be offering for my October move date.  It's still a ways away.  I'm a planner.  I like to know things in advance.  I get so stressed when I can't do so.  You know it's pretty bad when the last two nights I haven't been able to fall asleep without either (1) an alcoholic beverage or (2) half of a sleeping pill.  I'm dramatizing.  I'm making myself crazy.  I'm good at this.  I'll find an apartment.  On the brighter side.  Only 3 more classes! And I booked a trip with my friend, the tramp, to go to San Antonio in November for the Texas Psychological Association annual convention.  Sounds dull? I'm just exited to be taking a trip AND I get to stay in a hotel room for 3 nights.  AND I get to miss class.  The convention actually seems like it'll be interesting.  Lots of different seminars/workshops to go too.  One is how to survive graduate school and another one is about relationships.  I need help on both.  Apparantly.   I'm also going out to happy hour tonight with my friend, who I'll call Candie.  I need a drink.  She needs a drink.  I'm sure others need a drink and are welcome to come.  And I have money.  What a logical and coherent thought process!  Okay back to filing.  I've been here an hour and a half.  How much longer will I stay?  Speaking of.  I'm pretty sure end of this month I am going to be unemployed as I plan on quitting.  Should I put in a notice at 2 wks or now? Or should I try to work a little, like 2 hours each week and keep this job? Nah.  If I want to work extra I can always babysit or work at a church.  Good idea.

      I'm finally sitting down and posting. Mostly because I felt inspired by my  urlLink friend  who just started her very own blog. It gives me such warmth to know that others, similiar to myself, are suffering from the daily rigors of life. Seriously. And I'm suffering. I went and talked to the leasing office here yesterday and almost started crying. It was very unsettling to hear that they will probably not keep my rent the same, but will raise it 100 dollars. This may or may not be the case as I am not up for re-newal yet. September 1st. I managed not to cry in the office and tried my hardest in the elevator as I had company, but as soon as I got to floor 6, the tears came. And came. And came. And went. Provided that my rent stays the same, I could stay here. But I won't. So why I got upset and still get upset, I don't know. I don't want to work once practicum begins and I'd have to to live here. So I've been looking, but as the apartment locator guy says, I'm too early. So I'm gonna wait. Try to wait til mid September. I'll probably look tomorrow.  Finally the professor decided to cut the quizzes. When we only had 2 left. Nice. He also gave us our reports back and stated his displeausre of how the class is doing. I'm displeased. He took off 5 points for grammar errors. Too many "that's", incorrect punctuation, and misplacements of (.) before citations. How did I know that APA has their own unique way of punctuation? I should have had my report edited. So I got 52 out of 60 points or an 85. My friend, who I call the tramp now, scored a 59.5 out of 60. Must be nice. I still have an "A", barely, but I do. Although I heard my professor rambling that grades don't matter once out of school. They stress me out.
