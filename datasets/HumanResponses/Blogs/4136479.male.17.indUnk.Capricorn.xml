          The Naked Singularity                            One of the most unusual characteristics of a Kerr black hole is the possibility that it could evolve into a naked singularity. Due to the law of conservation of angular momentum, a rotating black hole should rotate ever faster as its radius decreased. Once the object's angular momentum increased beyond it's mass, the event horizon of the hole would be moving in excess of the speed of light. At this point, the event horizon would simply vanish from the universe, exposing the singularity. The absence of the event horizon means that we could travel freely into and out of the singularity. While no one has yet to prove that naked singularities cannot exist, most physicists are strongly inclined to believe that such is the case. Safely within the event horizon, a singularity is effectively shut out of the universe. When it is naked, this region of utter disregard for the known laws of nature is free to interact with the rest of the universe. To illustrate just how disruptive such an object might be, the simple act of going into orbit around a naked singularity would enable one to travel to any point in the past (9).       Parallel Universes                             Of all a black hole's bizarre characteristics, none seems stranger than the fact that the solutions to Einstein's equations tell us that these holes in space-time can serve as bridges into other universes. As fans of science fiction are well aware, a parallel universe is a universe entirely separate from our own. Among the many speculations as to the nature of these universes, is the idea that there could be parallel versions of ourselves inhabiting these universes; each living out a slightly different version of our lives. This idea doesn't seem so irrational when viewed in relation to the equally strange world of quantum mechanics (10). It is important to note, however, that the existence of these other universes is, at present, a purely theoretical construction.

         Black holes are my biggest fascination , so here goes !!!:        The Schwartzschild Black Hole    Dr. Schwartzschild found that if a mass is compressed into a sufficiently small radius, space-time becomes so severely distorted that even light can't escape from the gravity well. While it may seem improbable that such compression could ever truly occur in nature, it has been found that stars containing, minimally, between two and three times the mass of our sun should collapse in just such a manner. The theory being that once these stars exhaust their supply of fuel, they begin to collapse inward with such tremendous force that even the powerful internuclear forces within the atoms of the star aren't sufficient to prevent it from continuing to fall in on itself until the entire mass of the star is concentrated at a point called a singularity. Within the singularity, matter is infinitely compressed into a region of infinite density.  At the singularity, gravity is infinite . Space-time has become infinitely curved (3). At the present time, science has no tools to describe conditions within the singularity.     All laws of physics lose meaning in such a region.   Schwarzschild's work, however, does shed some light on conditions in the immediate vicinity of this cosmic forbidden zone. As the star begins to contract, it's mass becomes increasingly concentrated into an ever smaller region of space. The effects of gravity become increasingly pronounced. Soon, the gravity becomes so intense that a beam of light directed out into space will fall back to the ground, following the same parabolic path as an earthly projectile. At a point very near the end of the body's existence as a star, light must be directed perpendicular to the ground in order for it to escape. When the collapsing star passes its Schwartzschild radius, it vanishes from view because its escape velocity has exceeded the speed of light. Since, according to Einstein's work, nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, nothing, not even light itself, can escape from the star. It has become a black hole. The outer edge of the hole is called the event horizon, because no knowledge of events beyond it can ever be passed to the outside world. At a distance of about 1.5 times the radius of the event horizon, lies a region called the photon-sphere, in which the black hole's gravitational pull isn't strong enough to pull light into the event horizon, yet strong enough to prevent it from escaping. Photons of light are forever trapped inside this region, destined to orbit the black hole forever.       What's a rotating black hole?         Angular velocity   is one of the only three properties of a black hole, according to those-who-know. Rotating black holes are also known as Kerr black holes. It's also called a Kerr black hole for the same reason charged black holes are called Reissner-Nordstrøm black holes: Reissner-Nordstrøm geometry describes the charged black hole. The Kerr solution for the metric for spacetime describes the geometry of the rotating black hole. Since the static and charged black holes are spherically symmetric, the Schwarschild and   Reissner-Nordstrøm   geometries are ideally suited to polar coordinates in two dimensions and spherical coordinates in three dimensions. What're those? Well, instead of a grid of lines, things are described by a length and some angles. For the polar coords, lines of constant distance are circles; for the spherical coords, lines of constant distance are spheres. Lines of constant angle are radial lines for both systems. Kerr geometry uses something called   oblate spheroidal coordinate system  . It's similar to polar coordinates, except lines of constant distance are ellipses, and lines of constant angle are hyperbolas. Now, take that two dimensional grid-type-graph and rotate it about the vertical axis---that's oblate spheroidal! Why is it called a rotating black hole? The event horizon doesn't rotate---it's just a boundary-line. I suppose it's more descriptive (and unfortunately more confusing) to say that everything else revolves around the black hole. Since most stars rotate, when they become black holes, they also rotate. As those stars are becoming black holes, they shrink---and as a rotating something gets smaller, it rotates faster. Realistically, I suppose many black holes rotate very quickly. According to the calculations done by Kip Thorne, most black holes would rotate with a speed that is 99.8% their mass.      Two Photon Spheres?What's with the doubling?! Charged black holes have two event horizons instead of one, and now rotating black holes have not only two event horizons but two photon spheres. It has to do with the fact that the black hole rotates, and, when it rotates, it "drags" the space around it into rotating with it. It's like jumping into a whirlpool. If you jump in the direction of the current and start swimming, you get propelled along and go much faster than your normal speed. If you jump in and swim against the current, you get dragged back and go much slower than your normal speed. It is the same principle for photons as they try to orbit. Instead of just having one radius where photon can orbit unstably like the other two black holes, a rotating black hole has two radii where photons can orbit: one in the direction of rotating and one against. So there are two photon spheres. How do you tell which one goes where? Well, orbiting against the rotation of the black hole is more difficult. It's easier for me to use the example of satellites around the earth. Take two satellites, one further from the earth and one closer to the earth. The one closer to the earth must go much faster in order to stay in orbit and not go crashing down to the planet below. The satellite further away can go slower and still stay in orbit. O-K. Now, back to the black hole. Say you've got two light rays, one going in the direction of rotation and one going against it. You can draw a not-entirely-scientific parallel between the two situations (not-entirely-scientific because the speed of light is a constant). The light ray going in the direction of rotation can kinda "go faster," so it can orbit closer to the black hole. The light ray going against the rotation kinda "goes slower," so it must orbit further away from the black hole. Oh, did I say it had two photon spheres? Heehee. That's not quite accurate. See, since the black hole rotates, it's got an axis of rotation. It's no longer spherically symmetric like the other two. Its structure depends on what angle at which you approach the black hole. If you approach in the direction of the equator, then what I told you stands true: two photon spheres. If, however, you approach at an angle to the equator (you know, just like lines of latitude on the earth), there is only one photon sphere. Why? Well, if you come in from the top, there isn't really a choice of whether you should go with or against the rotation.       Do Black Holes Really Exist?    If a black hole, by its very nature, absorbs all matter and radiation that comes near it, then how would it ever be possible to detect one, short of falling into one? Astronomers have detected convincing evidence for the existence of several of these objects during the last 15 years thanks to the advent of x-ray telescopes. A black hole with another star in orbit near to it should be rapidly drawing matter from the star into it. The matter would circle the black hole in much the same manner as water going down a bathtub drain. This vortex of infalling matter is known to astronomers as an accretion disk. As the infalling stellar matter came closer to it's final destination at the event horizon, it would accelerate at ever increasing rates. The matter would begin to heat up, releasing photons of electromagnetic energy. Very close to the end of it's journey into oblivion, the stellar gasses would emit x-rays of intense energy. Astronomers search the sky for powerful x-ray sources that don't have a visual counter-part. Once an x-ray source has been located, the scientists try to determine if this source is a part of a binary star system (15). If the x-ray source is found to be part of a binary star system, astronomers can then calculate the mass of the unseen companion. This is done from spectral and visual analysis of the visual component of the binary system. Once it can be determined how long it takes the star to orbit the x-ray source, the mass of the source can be determined. If the x-ray source is found to contain, at a minimum, three times the mass of our sun, then astronomers are reasonably confident that a black hole has been discovered. To date, three objects that meet the above criteria have been discovered: Cygnus X-1, LMC X-3, and an x-ray emitter that has been recently discovered, known only by the designator A0620-00. Astronomers continue the search.
