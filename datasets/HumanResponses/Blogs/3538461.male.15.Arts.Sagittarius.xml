      I havn't updated in awhile, to much bad stuff has happened.  I'll talk about some of it later, I'll be right back, I'm gunna go take a shower... [Takes Shower] Ok, now that I'm done with my shower...I'm energetic...I'm gunna see if my household is quiet enough to play DDR...Be Back in alittle while :p [Plays DDR] I didn't get to play long, my dad was yelling down the hall about the noise, how can he hear that?!  The deaf basterd.  Anyways, I got in trouble with the police for tresspassing after hours and its a long story, so I'm not gunna tell you about it.  Something I didn't really wanna tell my friends about because it would worry them found its way out.  Still more things I want to talk to someone about, but no one knows what I feel like.  My mom got drunk and was mad at me about things I didn't do, which partially relates to all the problems my family are facing, and more still to come and she broke down crying when I was just trying to guide her through a simple task on the only working computer in my house and hung up.  When I called back she refused to talk to me for something I don't want to talk about, and I'm never going to talk to anyone about it, fuck the phychiatrist who already knows, because my mom was being a jerk a told him so he'd be able to "fully understand" me, and no one will ever.  So I was talking to my brother and he started telling me about all the things that was wrong with me and I almost broke down crying myself, but I kept myself, my friends were around me.  More crap when I got home, and now I just feel like killing myself, but why would I do that?  My pills are somewhere around here, they'll shut me up.  I'll wander off in search of them now...

Thought:  If I didn't need to go to summer school so I could be in the same school with my best friend, I'd be out on a street somewhere.

      Crappy day.  I woke up early cause of summer school, and had another extremely boring day.  I got coffee outta it though ^^  Then my mom came late to pick me up cause her lunch break schedule was messed up or something, I never pay attention.  Then my mom was late coming back cause of traffic and dropped me off to get groceries and walk home, so I just went over to Katrina's pool, cause she said something like she was gunna be there and then to her house.  I returned her rollerblade which I had for a while, then walked onto reidel and called Chris.  The only thing that I could think of to do was go to Randy's RP thing, which didn't seem like a bad idea at the time.   We didn't get to do much cause we didn't really have characters, and we were really annoying.  BANISHED.  We were sent to his basement...-_- but his kitty was down there, and hes such a cute kitty!  I kept trying to take things, cause I was wearing all very large clothes, but Sean seemed to be alittle goody two shoes ish (that should have been one word, too late now) and the only real prank I got to pull of was me wearing his clothes and going upstairs, hehe.  I can only imagine what it was like for Chris and Sean downstairs to hear that. "WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU WEARING" "Weren't you wereing black clothes...." "Dude...you look like a wigger..." "DIE!!!!" I escaped and his punishment was non-existant...thank god...he threatened to rape me...*shiver*  I kept being annoying while they RPed on the ground, since I didn't have a chair, and I was wearing a loosefitting shirt that fell over my shoulder a few times...bad idea...  Randy looked over at a bad times and screamed "YOUR A BISHIE" and proceeded to approach me, I'm not finishing that story, but lets just say I escaped, lived to tell about it, but am emotionally scarred.  My mom somehow got Sean and Chris' numbers and found me eventually.  She was very angery when she picked me up, but its easy to calm her down, just talk about George Bush and she'll start ranting about something else.  After I got home, I was in my room the rest of the night.  Shouldn't have walked so much today, mah spine hurts...  Music: Thrice: The Artist In The Ambulance Mood: Hateful and Scared

      I thought I was gunna have the greatest day after summer school.  So many friends at the pool, and yet more!  I got to meet Millie, whom I've heard so much about, and she was really cool.  I got there really late cause of summer school, I hate it so much.  I wanted to be with my friends the whole time.  Then I finally got out and my mom dropped me off back at home, and procceded to work.  I went to the pool and had a ball.  The only bad part was when Drew and I were waiting with Sam and Jess for their ride I went alittle ways away and for some reason started watching the clouds, I don't know why, but I did and Jess was said something like come over here and quit mopping, so I did O.o imagine that.  And when I walked over Drew said something about my birdiness again, so I stood on the bike rack and was birdy like.  Then, I have no idea, something happened to me and I fell right off it onto the bottom bar.  My spine feels completely broken...when I fell I lost my hearing, sight, scent, and I felt like I couldn't breath.  I can't remember like anything during it, except finding a way to stand up and say goodbye to Jess and Sam, which I partially don't remember.  Then I wandered with Drew back towards my house and my senses were slowly coming back, but they are still going in and out and my whole back hurts so much, I'm so scared, I think I'm gunna die if I fall asleep.  I'm in so much pain, I want to tell everyone everything I've never told them and tell everyone I love them...;_;  Music: Hoobastank: From the Heart Mood: I'm gunna die! I LOVE YOU ALL ;_; Will:  I'll tell you if you get something, cause I know you only care about my stuff!  You jerks!

      Today I woke up at 1, which was a dissappointment for me, since my best friend and some other people were singing at a church for a mass at 12:30.  Oh well, then I got a call from Jess at around 2 asking if I wanted to go to the pool with her, Sam, Steven and Drew.  So I went and got there before them, except Ehn who I talked to for a few, then Jess and Sam got there and they went in with Steven for his two guests, while I waited for Drew.  I waited a long time, I don't know how long, but it felt long.  Then when he finally got there I was very pleased, as I most definatly got sunburn already.  Then we just did random crap the rest of the time, I finally did a flip of the high dive, even though I fucked it up cause I thought I was gunna over do it, and I kinda under did it, and I did this wierd squirrelly thing when I hit the water and ow, Jess and Steven were getting really close, they'd make a good couple, and might be, but no one tells me anything, ever.  Then everyone kinda left before me and Drew, and we thought Ehn was gunna walk with us, and we wouldv'e changed our walking path to accomidate everyone, but he just like went without us, and I yelled at him up the street, but he didn't even look back at me, what was up with that O.o  I showed Drew my awesome alarm clock before he went home, and I was in a really good mood, had a good day.  I felt good about everything and all that.  Then I walked through my front door, and my parents started yelling at me about everything, meh.  My mood went down like 79.735% Exactly >.>  and I spent the rest of my afternoon with my room door locked laying against it so that they couldn't get in if they unlocked it somehow.  And even though I did that for quite some time, I was kinda asleep and I didn't really think of how much time went by.  So I'm gunna remember this day for its poolings.  Oh yes, I got all of the DDR songs, ever made Xb...and there was much rejoicing, alone.  Current Music: Whatevers on my playlist, I don't know what the hell this song is. Current Mood: Wheeee Oh yeah....summer schools tomarrow...FUCK...TT

      Last night was Jesshika's party (as me and Drew now spell her name).  It was fun.  I had to get kicked outta my house to do it, but I felt bad doing it, cause my mom has been being so nice latly, and caring, like a real mom O.o  Well nothing can be said for my father, but thats beside the point.  I got there alittle early, people were playing DDR and I was happy to be with my friends.  We did pretty much nothing until we went and saw Harry Potter, a few funny things happened during the movie, but they were quickly forgotten when Stevens dad came and took him from us all mean like, everyone was about ready to kill him, and wouldv'e if we had any form of weapon.  He came in the movie theater once looking for him, and I don't know how, but I was just like, "Holy shit, thats Stevens dad!  I can see why he hates him..."  But I didn't see him after that.  It was sad, I need to comfort Steven greatly when he returns.  We got back to the party and just kinda did nothing again, and it seemed to go by really quickly.  Drew and Ashley were with each other on the couch, and people kept trying to seperate them, but why, I don't know.  They aren't going to do anything in public obviously, and they don't get to see each other that often, I can't see why they can't just have their time together.  Jess liked all her gifts, and she got a ton of money, w00t, lucky her.  Me and Drew left feeling like time had gone by too quickly and were determined to come back in the night.  After just kind of lying around/talking to them on the phone, we were told that we couldn't come cause Jess' sister was there or something, I didn't really hear, but early in the morning when I was just about to fall asleep I got a call/IM can't remember which, saying that Ashley left during their veiwing of "Teh Ring" dun dun dunnnn, and had come over to Drews or something, but I never knew!  Wish she had a cell phone or something, Drew was out cold though, so it didn't matter.  I got to help him with his paper route, and his dad was all pissed at him for saying "it piss' me off" or something like that, and I know its horrible, but it felt good that someone was treated similar to me in their household, speaking of which, I was treated the same way when I got several hours later, after no sleep, and requiring of caffine.  Also, recently, I was happy to see my arms are getting slightly more muscular, and even though I have a long way to go, its nice to know I'm getting stronger by just veiw, almost...refreshing ^^  Current Music: Metal Gear Solid 2: Teh Sons of Liberty Theme Song XD Current Mood:  Tired, yet energetic, w00t Current Thought:  Being depressed is a bitch, and even though thats how I feel almost 99% of my life, I realize its a waste if I go through it sad like and angry.  I vow to always be happy, or at least try, I'm not perfect ^^

      I woke up today.  The roof was filled with light.  The hour was late.  It was exactly noon.  I took a shower.  And headed out to the library.  I started toward Chris', as he wasn't there yet.  I saw him.  He did not see me.  SPLITER CELL!  He was vonurable.  It was fun.  We were going to write song lyrics, instead we went to the pool.  Steven called and told us too.  We went in our shorts instead of bathing suits.  We rejoiced.  By dunking Drew.  ^^  Katrina the wounded, Drew the wounder, and Steven the ... were also there.  Me and Chris couldn't get in cause Drew was only allowed two guests.  We waited.  Ashley came and let us in.  There was more rejoicing.  Drew had hit Katrina somehow in the face, thats why I called him the wounder, and her the wounded.  Me feeling out of place.

      Yesterday I woke up early because I had to get x-rays on my intestines.  They were horrible.  You have to drink this liquid thats techniqually chalk and acid.  It tastes so horrible the doctor has to tell you to do your best to swallow it.  Then after that I came home and called Ehn to go see the Day After Tomarrow.  Mike and Sullivan wanted to go see that movie later though, so me and Ehn went to go see Garfield around 1, then we walked around the mall and waited.  Sullivan couldn't come to my great pleasure, and we saw the movie.  Afterwards Mike went and played DDR for a long time.  I got bored and bought ice cream for dinner...yum ^^  Me and Ehn are gunna take a Martial Arts class together too!  w00t and I'm gunna ask around and see if anyone wants to join us this summer.  Unfortunatlly it'll probably be the same class as my brother, but I don't care.

      I havn't updated in three days, so I'll make it short and sweet.  Friday I woke up around the time Drew was going to the pool with Katrina and Steven, so I went too.  Funny stories, etc.  Then later in the night Jami (one of my best friends) called me up and invited me over to his grandfathers for a sleepover.  It was nice, his grandpa is a great guy, except he forced so much food on me for breakfast, which I didn't really mind, I was hungry!  But he didn't really know when to stop and I left feeling sick.  When I got home my dad was the only one home and I was going to go to the pool again.  He yelled at me about my hair, because I techniqually just had awoken and my hair doesn't like humans when I wake up.  So I took a shower and went to the pool.  I thought I was late, but I was actually early compared to everyone elses times.  I had to lie and say I lived on Reidel to get into the pool because of the stupid rules.  But I had a fun time with Drew, Sam, Katrina, Ashley and Jess.  Me and Drew had a contest to see who could jump in and out of the water like a salmon after almost everyone left and I think I won, but we just kinda stopped after 10 minutes.  I got slight sunburn, but thats ok, nothing serious.    I came home to two family relatives I had never met before, but were really nice and cool, and seemed to know me.  The first one was like a distant aunt from Maohri or however you spell it, and the other was the same thing from a reservation in Montana.  They didn't seem to like eachother too much, but also not hate eachother.  The one thing that brought us together was our hate for my father.  They didn't like what kind of "blood" he introduced into me and my brothers blood.  I never caught their names, but the one from Moahri brought this movie about a girl who was the decendant of a chieftan and was to become the next one or something.  But it was really good.   So today I woke up at my normal 11 time...or was it 12...oh well, Drew told me that we were going to see the day after tomarrow today, so I was happy, but he canceled and I got to go see Harry Potter with Sam.  Me and Sam broke up today, for many reasons, but I don't want to bring down the happy mood of this blog.  So after the movie Sam went home with her mom and I got to go see my brother who said was going to give me a ride home becuase he was applying for a job at the book store.  I was obviously not thinking when I agreed to this.  He doesn't have his lisence, and I believe he never will.  So when I got there he was being interveiwed and told me to fuck off.  I bought Jess' birthday gift and some green hair stuff w00t and came back.  Then I got a ride of my mom coming home from something who scolded my brother for telling me I could get a ride.  My relatives left earlier that day, which made me sad, but I'm ok with it.  I'm downloading the bootleg of Harry Potter lol cause I can't get enough of it and tomarrow I'm going to Spalding to help Mrs. Tobin to help clean up the art room from 10-2 and getting service hours for it ^^  Fun Times Indeed.

      XP  I'm not in the greatest mood right now, but I was the whole day.  Most of it anyway ^^  I had the last of my exams today, History, uber easy, and Religion *tear*, everyone was exempt and my medicine doesn't seem to be working very well recently.  So when they were rubbing it in my face I had to go somewhere else for awhile cause I was literally about to break down into tears.  So anyway, the religion exam was a bitch, 200 multiple choice and 3 essay >  Then when I got home I said to myself "I want to do something...what to do...*thinks*  I'm hungry!  Well I didn't think about my Acid Reflux, which sucks, cause I ate like pure sugar and thats the worst thing I could do and I threw up, yuk.

      [refer to the fucking title] I know I shouldn't be all up and angry about everything, but my life is to fucking messed up, its bullshit.  I know I was born with emotional problems and I take medication for those, but since I was getting in the rythm of the acid reflux medicine I forgot to take the others.  The slightest thing will depress me to no end or piss me off.  I hate my god damned life.  I'm actually crying while typing this cause I was talking to my best frienda and just because I forgot what I was thinking two minutes before she got anger and left or just left, but I can't tell over the internet, so I'm taking it as hate, because I can't stop crying.  My hair is fucking soaked.  I love everyone so much and all I ever get back is hate and negitive feelings, why god put me on this earth I will never know, I'm living by myself on a boat, I'm going to be away from all those mother fuckers who hate me so much and then I can starve or drown to death.  Even now as I'm cursing people, I'm worried about them, I hate being so fucking emotional.  I hate my life, I hate everything, but I can't, because I care to much for others I can have one thought for myself, I can't live like this, GAHD DAMMIT MOTHER FUCKING SON OF A CRACK HEADED BITCH....screw it....screw it....I just need a week away from my family and I'd be cured, I bet, I would be.  Then I closed a pair of scissors on my wrist, but I couldn't bear it and I only got a small wound.  I love all my friends, so dearly.

      I missed a day of blogging, so I'll have yesterday in here too...^^;;  Yesterday I got go to my phycotic doctor for a meeting.  He mostly talked about my acid reflux, which was pretty boring.  Until he started talking about how it can lead to cancer, and he said it like I had cancer, which scared me. ^^;;  But quickly afterward said, "but its a very rare chance that you'll get it."  He also was talking about my skin, how it was really stretchy and weird, as well as my cracked rib.  He quickly began to say that I should get surgery for my rib, my skin, and the acid reflux.  I was like "WTF!?!?" and what really worried me was that 2 seconds after he said that, he corrected himself by saying "oh yeah, there is no cure for acid reflux...we''l just put you on this medication!"  So now I'm worried I might have to get surgery and the new medicine I got is making me feel tired and depressed. TT  Today I had finals in English and Biology.  I really hated them.  I felt fine all morning, since my mom was feeling bad for me cause of what the doctor said, she gave me breakfast, even though I did feel bloated all day.  During the start of my english final I had these sharp pains in my chest and lower stomach, I didn't think anything of it until I got to the essay, at that point I had a really bad cough and was coughing up blood.  I went to the bathroom and spit it all out, which was an awful lot, and then returned to my class in which I was worried about dieing during a final the whole 5 paragraph essay.  Then I went down to the Bio exam, which was pretty annoying.  It was 200 multiple choice and 2 essay.  And given the time that we had, I worked as hard and as fast as I could ^^  I finished first XP but that was a bad idea, cause my wrist hurt for like half an hour after that.  Then on the bus, my bus driver forced all of us to sit next to eachother in the front... I was confused, and when I asked she said she wanted to bring us all together for the last 3 days, which is total bull, and I wanna know why she did, even though I really don't care where I sit or next to who, I just always act like I do because I desire attention >.>  Anyway, when I got home I was home alone for a very long time, as usual, which I actually prefer and did nothing of real importance for hours on end.  I did find a site where I could download whole albums though, which I was pleased with, and I played a game for a few minutes.  I still need to talk to Sam seriously....  Current Music:  Linkin Park: Carousel  Current Mood:  Mellow, not really sad, not really happy.

      I'm just saying this, my weekend sucked.  So this is going to sound negitive *note the disclaimer*  I had another horrible day today, and its all because I'm forced to be around my family.  They insist I study in front of one of them, fucking retards.  So the one time I got to be alone and come up to my room, I get a call from Katrina and Sam on my cell.  My relationship with Sam is not good, bespite the fact I love her dearly, we are so fucking different in our personalities and opinions.  I can barly have a conversation with her nowadays, they usually go something like this... Sam: "Yeah and that new diet, it looks like it'll really work!" Me: "Mannnn, I havn't had pizza in ages..." But I don't want to talk about that very much, I need to work it out, one way or another O.o  Anyway, while they were talking to me, I was kinda highish and not talking back, my Dad kicked open my door, which probably wasn't that hard for him since hes such a fucking fat basterd and I had to hang up really quickly.  Of course my friends all went to the pool or did something fun today.  I was at home being yelled at and studying the whole day.   I felt like swimming so badly today, I fucking hate my family.  Some of my friends say that I wouldn't be happier if my dad wasn't at home.  He goes on buissiness trips alot and while hes gone, I'm happier then anything, and alot of times my dad and mom have to leave, and thats when I'm the happiest.  Drew came by this afternoon asking for his glasses, and of course he had to bring up that he was at the pool today and after I told him I was home all day studying and that what he said probably will later drive me to kill myself, he stated the water was cold and it was the worst possible thing that could ever happen in a day.  After he left I went to my room and stared at my walls, bored, then I spotted my electric guitar.  It brought back many memories of all my old friends and I broke down into tears, and even though I could hear my dad pounding on the wall downstairs while he was screaming, "Shut the hell up!!!" I kept the tears flowing steady for a good 10 minutes.  I tried playing it, but I'm completely lost, I forgot everything...I'm pretty sure it wasn't even tuned...>_>  But I'll get it to work.  Also, I've decided that thursday after finals, I'm leaving my house for awhile.  I know that alot of my friends are exempt from the religion final, which is the last one on thursday and I hope someone will take me in that night, then the next night I can find a larger veriety of people, since its a friday and no schools have school saturday.  The thing I'm still stuck on is if I'm going to tell my parents and piss them off, or don't and see how long it is until they notice.  Current Mood: I want to kill someone. Current Music: Saiyuki:  For Real Current Standing: Those who commit suicide are selfish.

      This is the rest of my day after my last post >.>  Which I should have kept to myself... I needed to study for subjects that my books were missing.  So I called Steven, he never studies for anything I thought.  I was right.  So I ran over to his house and got them, and his grandma offered me a ride home cause I was drenched hehe.  After I got home I studied the rest of the day.  Then I started playing Hitman 2 again.  My memory card got deleted so I wanted to get alittle ways into the game.  I'm still playing it now.  I keep thinking about redecorating my room more, but I need to keep the few dollars I have for anime and for otakon XD  Current Music: In Flames:  F(R)Iend Current Mood:  Hungry, Happy, and...did I forget Hungry?

      Today was possibally one of the worst days in many years for me.  I was woken up at 11 by my friend asking if I wanted to go to a movie, I said no, cause I was grounded.  My parents heard me talking and made me go study at the kitchen table for finals.  I resent that they make me study in front of them, but I did it to please them.  I study for 3 hours till 2, when they began to scream at me for no reason.  My dad hit me several times, which doesn't bother me since hes a weak mother fucker, but I threatened to call the police on them.  This just pissed them off more.  My dad took out a knife, which scared to fucking hell out of me, but he handed it to me and through me out the front door screaming, go fucking kill yourself.  I was so god damn mad at them, I needed to talk to someone, but I knew I couldn't go to anyones house unannounced, and I didn't have my cell phone.  Thats when I saw 2 guys dressed in all black walking to peoples houses.  I thought they were mormans, and I also thought they might listen to my story.  They were Jews!  And they listened to my story and were soooo nice!  Thats when a cop pulled up and arrested me for having a knife.  The Jews came with me to the station and told them it wasn't my fault, and my parents came down.  They acted like it was all my fault, and the police let me off because the Jews (Brian and Greg) told them I wasn't attacking them.  My parents aren't as dumb as I thought, they knew I could tell the police about the abuse, but I didn't.  On the way home it was realllly quiet.  When we got home my dad said he was sorry, and it wasn't his fault I was such a mistake.  That really hurt, but coming from my parents, thats a good thing.  My dad also promised never to hurt me again (I've heard that before) and he'd find some way to apoligize.  I don't ever want to bring this up agian, but I needed to let it out.  I'll have it if I ever want to have a case against my dad, and I probably will.  My moms still pissed at me though and she knows she can yell without getting arrested TT  Current Music:  Nine In Nails:....There are soo not enough songs by them...and I have 7 of their cds.... Current Mood:  Extremely depressed and wanting to avoid my house. Current Standing:  I love the Jewish people and I'll never do anything to insult them ever agian.

      Yo.  I'll put more then just a journal in here, and I actually will, cause livejournal was being diffucult.    I havn't been having many good days latly, but they'll get better!  They will....  Anyway, today was kinda normal, but all in its own, entirly messed up.  Yesterday my mom went on Parentconnect (a site that tells those basterds my grades)and saw that I had a "F" in History.  Even though I know that was completly and obviously wrong, my mom didn't believe me... like usual.  Sadly the first thing she did was get drunk.  When my dad got home, he noticed she was drunk, and he decided he should too, for some reason.  After they were both almost wasted my mom, in her current state told my Dad about my grade and he rampaged my room and did several other things.  I just finished redecorating it too TT   Today I went through my normal school day, cept their were class elections or something like that, and of course the idiot got predecency, but VP went to a cool guy.  Also today I talked to my History teacher, surprise surprise, I'm passing it!  *rolls eyes*  But I also saw my counsuler, he complained about my class record, beh, but also my Latin grade.  I'm probably gunna have to go to summer school, as in almost 100% chance.  Sorry to all my friends that I'm such an idiot and I don't deserve to live, but the good news is that summer school is like from 8 in the morning to 10, so I'll practically have about the same amount of time I normally would!  Cept it might go to 12, but still not that much of a difference.  My mom was really pissed at me about almost anything she could think of when I got home, and tomarrow I have to stay after to talk to someone about something TT and I can't ride the bus home.  And I have to study all weekend for finals >   One last thing.  In the past 10 hours 5 people have told me I look sad all the time or I'm staring off into space every second of my life.  I got really upset when they said this.  I'm going to try to be happier now, I might more food for it, but I can always go to someone elses if I really need it. ^^  Current Music:  System of a Down: Mind  Eifel 65:  Move Your Body (NOT GET LOW!

      I havn't updated in along time.  I really feel messed up right now.  My family is really low on money, I'm talking to a friend and shes calling me a sexist because she was ranting about men in general and I took offense, I can't think straight, I want to be with someone, or doing something that'll take my mind off life.  I know that everything will be over soon and I will be able to move on and be happy for the rest of my existance.  I want everyone to be happy, even if it involves me getting hurt or being sad, I don't care, as long as everyone else is happy, thats what makes me happy.  I went to the pool today, and rolled down this hill really violently and hurt my back, but it was fun.  Then on my way home it started raining really badly and for some reason I reached in my pocket and found my glasses 0.o  so I wore them for awhile and I could see again!  Then I was going down the parkway really fast, I lifted my arms up in the air and stood up on my bike.  It felt like I was flying, I closed my eyes and it was like walking in heaven, then some horrible driver swerved right in front of me, came inches from my front tire and my bike flipped over into this giant, massive puddle.  My glasses broke in like every possible way.  Through them in the gutter.  Now my family is all stressed out about paying bills and stuff, but my dads leaving tomarrow for a long while, so I'll feel less stressed for a few months.
