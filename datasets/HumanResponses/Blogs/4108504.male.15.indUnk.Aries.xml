      Well, I was typing a response to Stephanie's LJ post mentioning Sonic Youth and Mudhoney, and I ended up ranting about songwriting, but it was too long, so I'll just post it here. :D   Sonic Youth is  awesome !  They influence me a lot. I love the progressive style arrangements mixed with the more conventional poppish hooks. I'm really fond of the mellow, yet errie tones along with the experimental noise aspects. And it isn't experimental for the novelty of being experimental, it complements the song and takes it to another level.  I even like the apathy driven college rock, "I'm bored, tired, I rock, and I don't give a fuck" vibe, Thurston's shaggy hair, and you gotta love his crazy Jaguars. :P  I want to take it a bit further. I love writing prog, without being  prog . The songs have long arrangements, but they still structure themselves around each other. Unlike shit like Dream Theater, where it's about 5 song ideas into one, with maybe a return to the original basis theme at the end to support that it's the same song. :P  It's a conventional structure, perhaps with different extensions to make it more interesting, without going overboard. Along the lines of:  Intro   --Melody 1   --Melody with increase of presence (perhaps harmonizing guitars, bass/drums come in. Something that builds upon the previous without being different on the whole.)  Verse   (I like when the verse isn't a typical even number of measures. Instead of repeating 4 measure phrases, maybe it's more interesting with a 4 meas. phrase, then 3 measures leading into the next section, perhaps with an incomplete lyric to leave you hanging as the song moves on)   Pre Chorus  ( Can still be interesting if skipped, especially if the verse has notable variations. Sometimes a different section is needed to ascend into the chorus so the song doesn't 'cut to the chase'. But it's not always needed.)   Chorus   (Generally the most rememberable, hook-worthy section, of course. A lot of times, a drastic dynamic shift will really set the chorus apart, or maybe even a key change. Loud verses and quiet choruses or vice versa will set the song apart from the conventional ways of structuring.)  -- Pre-Verse. (Not always needed, but sometimes helps. The song may become seem generic fast if it just goes straight back into the verse. A short interlude of some sort usually helps to move the song along.   Verse 2   I find it important to have something previously absent come into the second verse to 'lift' the song up. Perhaps a new corresponding melody, or vocal harmonies. It just needs something to separate it from the first. It doesn't need to be a carbon copy of the first with different lyrics.   Interlude   I think going straight into the chorus again from the verse is a bit too conventional at times. It helps to have a brand new section to move the song along and give it more personality. Just make sure it isn't too long. Its function is basically to extend the verse and introduce a new aspect to keep the listener entertained.)   Chorus   (The second chorus, like the second verse, often needs a new aspect introduced to a familiar part. The interlude is lifting the song up so that the second chorus can stand out but still flow. It's very anticlimatic to have an interlude leading into a carbon copy of a previous chorus. This is often the most chaotic section of the song, in dynamic terms, with the following section being a dynamic reset, which can open a whole new soundscape of possibilities once more. Once you get to a certain point, you can't really build up anymore. Going back to 'level 1' kind of gives the song a chance to rebuild, and will keep the song flowing. Trying to get more chaotic will only seem tedious. If you want the song to get even more 'extreme', building into it later from a calmer standpoint will capture the intent much better.)  Bridge   (The next few sections are where the song really gets a chance to shine. Personally, I don't think any more choruses are really needed from this point on, but it depends on the song. Perhaps a unique outro chorus is an exception. As mentioned before, it's a good idea to have a dynamic reset here. If the previous sections were quiet, this is a good place to pack punch and allow the song to 'evolve'. If the previous sections were building up, this is a good place to 'breakdown' and allow itself to build to a climax. The rest of the song really depends on the specific intent. You may want to keep whatever dynamic you have reached for the rest of the song, and finish off the song with the outro. The most 'epic' thing you can do is buildup to a chaotic climax (more chaotic than the second chorus), perhaps a guitar solo or verse built upon a previously unheard basis. This is the place to be as creative as you can. Anything can be put to good use here, and being experimental can pay off very well for the song. The bridge can be nearly any length, but really needs to be notably longer than any previous sections.)   Climax   (Once again, nearly anything will fit well here if used efficiently. A dynamic shift is definitely needed if you want to avoid a lulling vibe. This section can be compromised of many parts, but keep in mind not to overdo it. A key change may work well here if used properly. The importance of good writing is far above being particularly innovative or experimental, but those can be used to help. Efficiency is key. Whatever works isn't bad. If the bridge is particularly long, it may be a good idea to have the outro directly following the climax, or perhaps having the climax being the outro itself.  Instead of having a climax, you may want to build up back into a verse (being that the dynamic is different). I find that this will work the most efficiently if you want to have an outro chorus.)   Outro   (The outro is once again a chance to be as creative as you can. A completely new part may be introduced, key changes and dynamic shifts welcome. If the previous sections are noticably different, you might want to return to a familiar variation of a beginning section. Outro choruses work, but I find them boring, unless preceded by a dynamic-shifting verse. There are really only 3 main options on how to end; a fade out, a stop, or seguing into another song.)     Of course, all of this depends on the writer and the song. Diversity is key, there's nothing wrong with conventional arranged songs, but it helps to have a lot of both.  Here's an example of the structure of the song Geek U.S.A. by Smashing Pumpkins, one of my favorite songs of all-time. I really like the way it's structured.     Intro   --Drums, then Guitar  --Bass and Guitar overdubs enter, increasing the 'excitement'    Verse   Chorus   Pre Verse   (The guitars revise back to their original intro riff, as lead guitar lines lead into the next verse.)   Verse   Interlude   (Like I mentioned earlier, going back into the chorus would be boring. Brand new parts are introduced with interesting overdubbed double lead guitar parts. They lead into the next chorus, making it more chaotic, complete with the exaggerated last word of the interlude seeking into the beginning of the chorus.)   Chorus     Bridge   --The song has a dynamic reset, with a half-tempo feel and a very quiet, peaceful vibe, with quiet singing, but it still flows. The key changes as well. The double lead guitars ascend with eerie feedback as they fade out.  --The key changes once again as the song then immediately bursts back into heavy crushing distorted guitars, as the double lead guitars return playing very melodic harmonies. There is no previous warning (crescendos, etc.) of the dynamic shift, except perhaps the slight exaggeration of the last two words being sung. Despite the immediate dynamic shift, the song still remains relaxed, particularly because there is still a slower half-tempo feel. The objective is to keep the listener entertained, and the dynamic shift does a good job of keeping attention. The last chord is held for two measures as a drum fill hints that change is going to ensue.    Climax   --The song immediately picks up again as the tempo doubles and an eerie, fast, adrenaline rush of a guitar solo lifts the song up to a previously unfamiliar high, which is exactly what a guitar solo should be used for. Not for showing off, but for lifting the song to a new point. The guitar solo definitely does its job very well here.  --The song is now back to its original fast, exciting pace, as a new verse is introduced with the chord progression of the solo. The previous lead guitar and an overdubbed lead guitar proceed to come out of the solo with experimental chaotic feedback, harmonics, and random weird noise. The focus is of course on the singing, since it's a verse, but the eerie noises keep the pace and make sure that the song does not revert to a previous level since more is in store. (A lot of the balance in dynamics has to do with the way the guitars are mixed and produced on the album. The rhythm guitars are a thick, heavy, presence of heavy fuzz, while the lead guitars are slightly hollow with a lot of midrange. When they drop out, a lot of presence is lost.)  --The verse ends with the double lead guitars playing an octave melody that corresponds to the progression a few times, and the exaggerated, accented hits of the drums in synch with the guitar hints another change ensuing as the last chord is repeated in the progression.  --The previous chord progression repeats once again, as a small double guitar solo proceeds to keep the song flowing in the climax of the climax, heh.  --The song breaks down without really breaking down. Yes, I know it doesn't make sense. The guitars all end on one note, with loads of eerie feedback, but the bass plays a new half-tempo melody undearneath it all, hinting change once again. The guitars descend with a presence-giving pick scrape as an accented drum fill leads into the outro.    Outro   The guitars double the previous bass melody, and the song is now back to a slower pace for the outro verse. There are lead guitar lines in corresponding places and variations in the riff. The instruments all end in unison, and the song fades out with more feedback.   The song clocks in at 5:13, which is suprisingly short when you take into consideration how much stuff goes on. This song is one of the primary reasons I wanted to play guitar, and I know it inside out. :P     I really have NO CLUE why I just typed out all of that stuff. Sorry. I guess you can add it to your "How To Be A Rockstar!" kit. :P  The alternate theory to everything above? Write stuff that sounds cool. :P   When I first bought my Big Muff (*resists urge to giggle insanely*) Fuzz Pedal, everybody was like "OMG! MUDHONEY USES THOSE!", but I've never really heard them. I guess I'll have to check them out.      Wow. This is really long. :P

      Yesterday was the best day ever. Just being with Brittany makes me so happy. :) I never wanted it to end.   I already miss her  so  much. I probably won't be able to see her again until school starts on the 16th. :(  I can't wait until I can drive and have a vehicle.

       Soundgarden - The Day I Tried To Live    I woke the same as any other day Except a voice was in my head It said seize the day, pull the trigger Drop the blade, and watch the rolling heads  The day I tried to live I stole a thousand beggar's change And gave it to the rich  The day I tried to win I dangled from the power lines And let the martyrs stretch Singing  One more time around might do it One more time around might make it One more time around might do it One more time around The day I tried to live  Words you say never seem To live up to the ones inside your head The lives we make never seem To ever get us anywhere but dead  The day I tried to live I wallowed in the blood and mud with All the other pigs  I woke the same as any other day you know I should have stayed in bed  The day I tried to win I wallowed in the blood and mud with All the other pigs  And I learned that I was a liar Just like you

      I had a dream about Brittany last night. It was kinda weird.  I was at her apartment, but for some reason I remember looking outside and seeing all these mountains and stuff. Wtf?   Pretty much all I remember was a lot of hugging and stuff and playing Mario with Kristopher.  The former made me happy (until I realized it was a dream, of course), and the latter just confused me. Damn you, Mario. Stop invading my thoughts.  My dreams rarely make this much sense, though. They usually have many more random occurences. It was a bit refreshing.  I love her.  And I miss her.  I can't wait to see her.

      Mad TV is quite possibly the dumbest sketch comedy show I've ever seen. 90% of it is not remotely funny at all. I miss Saturday Night Live repeats. Those skits weren't written by an 11 year-old.  Thank God for Conan O'Brien, though. Conan is  the man !      Not just any man can exercise his hair.  Max reminds me of my eighth grade History teacher, Mr. Akers.   He was awesome, too. He played with my band at the end of school. 'Twas fun. I wish I could find a picture of him. He does have a weird resemblance to Max. I thought there used to be a picture of him on the RJH Staff Site.    Edit:   Saving Silverman  is now on. This is a great movie. Maybe Comedy Central sensed my complaint. Plus, Jack Black is in it, and Jack Black is  the other man!    JD (disguised): "Oh, yeah....I went to college." Judith (casually): "Oh really, Standford, Harvard, what?" JD: "Uh....SU." Judith: "Ooh, Stanford Unversity?" JD: "Actually.....uh, Subway University." Judith: "I know someone who went there. Do you know JD?" JD (uptight): "No way. I have never heard that name in my entire life. I have to leave." (begins walking out door) Judith: "Alright, see you later, JD." JD (casually): "Take it easy, Judith." (pauses to think) "DAMNIT!"   That's got to be my favorite part in the movie.
