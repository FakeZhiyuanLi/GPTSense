      The title for this entry just came to mind because I'm listening to a song called Little Things by Bush, which I might add is a very good song.   Somehow I managed to sleep till 2:15pm today which is a mystery to me as I wasnt particularly tired the night before. So as I am writing this at 3:45pm, I am still under the "just woken up" condition where you just feel really....bleh. I'm sure you know what I mean.  Once again I have no idea what to do with myself, I must bring myself to do 3 things; write a letter to emma, write a letter to phil and get together with Ricky. Hmm. It's funny really, you get all excited about a hugely long holiday off school, but then you realise theres actually nothing to do to pass the time. Apart from just sit here saying to whoever is on msn that I'm bored. Then going back to being bored of course.  At least peter will be back from holiday soon so I can terrorize his house. And of course next weekend theres Twiggies to go round and go to church, that'll be good I really need to go to church.   I hate staring around my room. It's just mess in the most annoying places, but I've tried tidying it up. Within a day, sometimes even mere minutes, things get put back into the empty spaces again, and the mess has returned. It's a never ending pointless cycle and so I now just don't bother to tidy up the mess in the first place. Makes sense don't you think? Well probably not coming from me.  Now I shall go back to boredom and waiting for emma to call.......

      After being away from my home for about a week and a half and then enjoying a 9 hour coach journey home you can imagine the first thing I really felt like doing was sleeping. Its what I do best so I got right to it. Although perhaps sleeping until 2pm today was a little excessive maybe?  Anyway don't ask me why I felt like creating a place on the net for all my thoughts and rantings, but I have to put them somewhere, save moaning about them to everyone else, which I'm sure they don't appreciate as much as they say they do. So here seemed like a good place. I realise a lot of people like to keep a secret diary, but that is very, well, secretive and how can I be expected to rant and rave and reminisce about things to people in a private diary? So here is where I shall empty my many thoughts.   I suppose I should apologize now to the Blogger people for filling their servers with a load of anarchistic nonsense but perhaps, in parts, a few gold nuggets of truth and wisdom may escape into my typing fingers.  Good Afternoon.
