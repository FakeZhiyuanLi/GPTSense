       im so happy right now. i cant wait for tomorrow night. everything seems to be working out heaps good. im really happy with chips, an even david has come to accept that im going to be with him. all he wants  now is that im happy. chips was worried about david being angry, an i dont want them to ever meet, but i think if i get hurt now, david would be so pissed off. i dont think i will get hurt though. but im really scared of hurting someone with all of this. it just feels too good to be true, so i'll make the most of it while its here. i dyed my hair, an it looks retarded. its too red, lisa i dont like it. :( oh well i guess ill get used to it.  mum didnt buy me alcohol :( i think i'll just have to take something out of the cupboard lol they wont even notice but i'll tell them, just in case.  any hoo im going to bed, got a big night tomorrow ;)  bye

       things are still heaps confusing i cant spell tonight an i cant be bothered fixing everything i fuck up. millie, i cannot belive that you didnt tell us you an daniel were going out.... how rude!! david an i are finally finished i think, i know i say that all the time, but i really think me might leave me alone now. just in case you were interested millie, the main reason i havent said yes to chips is coz david an i still kinda have things to sort out. well, i dont think we do, but he does. i want to say yes, i think, but i dont want to ruin anything. mum thinks theres going to be no guys there at the party at all. she thinks megans mum is heaps cool. she said when i talked to her that i owe her a favour. lol im heaps tired but i had to come on just to write in this so everyone knows whats going on inside my twisted little brain nighty night

       david an i are still not fully apart. he wont let me have a break now that he thinks he knows about me an chips. now i dont think i like chips anymore. i think that how i felt about him was more about what i was missing with david. he made me feel special an gave me attention that i wasnt getting with david. i dont want to be with david, but i dont really want to be with chips either. right now, guys are a waste of time. im sick of them.  next day.... david wanted to read this so i stopped writing he is being a prick again an wont give me space. he doesnt get it. by trying to hold onto me an not letting me have a break, hes pushing me away. theres something my dad told me that i remember... that is something is meant to be it will happen... if you let something go an it comes back, it was meant to be. i want to tell david that but he wont listen. right now, the way he is acting, i really dont want to be with him. chips is the one i think of most of the time... when i think of david im angry with him, like when he falls asleep on the phone to me, thats why i fall alseep thinking of him, not chips. im really confused about everything. i dont want to bring anyone into the mess david an i have, but chips is there anyway. i dont know who i want to be with anymore

       david and i are taking a break. its what my parents wanted all along, but they weren't going to wait to let us sort things out first. thats all i wanted, an im not game enough to tell them that. now david is coming over tonight to tell them that, and mum is cutting sick coz hes said some things he shouldn't have. so mum pissed me off an now ive told her i dont want to be here at home with them anymore. i shouldnt have told her that but i was really angry, an now im scared theyre going to kick me out. if they do, david has always told me i can stay at his place, but i do really want to have a break from him, an if im staying there, it wont happen. everyone says that me an chips like each other, an i do kinda like him. it surprised him today when turtle told him i had a bf, which i dont really... he just thought i was still with david. i dont like him as much as i like david, but when david an i were talking last night, when i said that chips was fun to be with an all, he kinda took it the wrong way. i like most things about chips, but that doesnt mean i want to be with him. hes just a friend right now, even though i think we both like each other. there is no way id bring another guy into the mess that david an i have got going. it isnt fair to anyone. i want to leave home, but now isnt the right time. i need to get my license, an a job, an a car. if i left now, everything would be really fucked up. my parents need to get a life, and let me have mine back. they told me that i could make my own choices, an that i would learn from them, but theyre not letting me do anything. i dont get to make my own choices, an i dont get the freedom i want to do what i want. grrrrrrrrrrrr if everything was good with me an david, i would go to his place for a while, so we got some time together an to make mum an dad realise that i was serious about leaving. i really dont want to be at home. anyone want me!!!! lol anyways better go, david will be here soon an i think i need to go an get ready for a mass fight cant wait, this is going to be so much fun NOT :( bye
