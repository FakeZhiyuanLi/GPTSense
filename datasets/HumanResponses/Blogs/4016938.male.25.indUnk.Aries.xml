       Hey guys,    Well i being doing some testing and checking this thing out. But for now, I kno I told u guys i would give you an indepth review of the convention. Well, this is an edit of a testimonial I left for on of my boys, J-10's friendster thing. Check it out, and for those of you that were there, u just might agree.        "Gad Damn that was a bomb ass conv. I had a wonderful time. It was indescribeable. It was jus like the Orlando one, cept this one was like on fire going down the autobahn at 150 MPH, being chased by helicopters shooting scuds, and flying ninjas, while Neo's doing his superman thing, and a 100 agent Smith's saying "it's inevitable" cause he was gettin shot by Michael Corleone in the italian restaurant, after Hyman Roth goes "but this is the life we've chosen" to Maximus, talkin about how he is "a father of a murdered child, husband of a murdered wife" and you that bad muther fucker is gona get his revenage in this life or the next, then like outa the blue, Dave Chappelle comes out and is like "Gad Damn them niggar's crazy". then he goes up to Cartmen, and is like your mom at the convention was a big fat bitch, so Cartmen calls on Jesus and was like damn there some fine hoes here and he starts break dance fighting wit Hansel, cause that Hansel's is so hot rite now, cause he saved the prime minister of propecia. To bad Hansel told Derek to deralict his balls, cause that muther fucker Derek Zoolander woulda kicked his ass only if he coulda pulled his underwear off while his pants were on, but its aight cause Joey's identical hand twin was keeping the party going, and got Pussy Galore and Ivana Humpalot, to start stripping, then it really got going when the last samurai Tom Cruise walked in and starting cuttin up some chicken breasts on whole wheat and cheeze wit his sword, cause everyone had the munchies.    .....Gad Damn it was a blast............................................................  ...........................................Oh ya, and them damn ninjas were on fire to, I told you shit was crazy. Well see you guys on the flip side...till the next episode."  Well that was my review and it was pretty fun, but them damn ninjas still gettin to me, they was burning hot. And i dont think I have ever had a better chicken breast on whole wheat and cheeze sandwich, it hit the spot. But well guys this is it for now.    urlLink  Pe@ce   ,  urlLink .kizom       Quote of the Day:      "We're rich, but they're niggar rich"   ...................................some white dude on Chappelle's Show

      Life sucks and Iam in a very bad mood. I hate everybody. And to top it all off, I can't even express how much of a bad mood Iam cause i quit cussing. When it rains, it's Noaha's flood.     I'll finish this up later after i count to 10 and go to my happy place.   Sam   Quote of the Day:  "One of the illusions of life is that the present hour is not the critical, decisive hour.

         You know, I dont hate many people in this world. But Michael Moore sure as hell is one of them. Can you beilve that this bastard made money of the tragic Columnbine shootings and now he has that one sided biased as hell movie Farenheit 911.  I guess one of the things thats so annoying  about being on the liberal left is that we got this fat, stupid trader represeting our ideals  to the public. Not all of us onthe left has the views that he does. I have always said that i would never watch one of his movies because he makes money off American tragedies. And i still havnt seen Farenhiet 911. But in discussions wit people who have seen it i kno that it is a very very biased opionon of the current administation. Just so i dont look foolish, I will watch the movie. But i sure as hell wont pay for it so that fat bastard can make money off of me. I will pirate it off the internet.   Iam in no way in support of Bush, but I  do think that a Hussain needed to be taken out. Maybe Bush did make a mistake, but his mistake was made on false intelligence.  It was partly the fault of the intelligence community that cuased 911. The intelligence agenies have been mismanaged and underfunded for years. Not just during republican administrations but mostly in democratic administrations. People have been  bitchin for years about cuttin spending and paying off the national detb, well this is wut happens when u cut spending.   Gettin back to my hatered of Michael Moore.  The reason for this post is iam gona post a link of the Bill O'rielly interview from the other day. Michael Moore enters the No Spin Zone! And wut does he do, spins it all around. I highly urge you to read the transcript and better yet, if possible, watch the video.  In the interview O'rielly really backs him at some points, and all Moore can respond with is "will you sacrafice your child".  Only reason Moore is where he is because no movie reviewer and media can dispute his claims. They do not kno the matrial and are not willing to get into a discussion with him fearing they will look foolish and/or alienate viewers. But put him against a person who knows wut he is talkin about and Moore can be discredited jus like any misguided, intellectually voided loonatic.  Maybe Iam the one thats misguided and dont kno wut Iam talking about. That sure does logically make sense. But then again I maybe right, even on my some what limited knowledge.  I do admit i dont have all the facts, and I possibly dont have enuff information to talk bad about the guy. But just for the fact that he tries to make money of tragedies is reason enuff for me to hate him. For now watch this interview and/or read the transcript if you are still on 56k. Then after I watch  Farenheit 911 i will do another post.   urlLink http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,127236,00.html   Quote of the Day:  "But one name stands out more than any other, and his web of lies is weaving its way slowing through the fabric of our society.

       &nbsp; &nbsp;   Hey guys, my bad about not posting yesterday.&nbsp; I was busy being elated about winning the lottery again.&nbsp; Yes i wont again,&nbsp; I took the $14 lucky seven and got 5 Jumbo Bucks tikits ($2 ea.).&nbsp; They way it works is u got 2 serial numbers up top and then u got 10 areas u gota scratch off.&nbsp; The 10 areas will have a corresponding serial number (they may match yours on top or not), with a dollar amount.&nbsp; Now my lucky ass got 5 outa the 10 match the winning serial number.&nbsp; That is soem crazy lucky. Just ran into one problem tho, each scratch was for $1 ea. But just knowledge in knowing that i had a pretty good chance, is winning all in it self.&nbsp; Ahhhh horse shit who am i kidding, my luck sucks.&nbsp;The most i ever won on one ticket was like 32 bucks or sumthing.&nbsp; But i guess i cant complain, most of the time i play i always win $2 or a free ticket, I hardly ever not win.&nbsp;   So, moving on with my life.&nbsp; Again I appologise bout missing a post yesterday, I kno I said i would do one everyday. But, hell, I just got lazy and didnt wanna&nbsp;do it.&nbsp; Once i get started&nbsp;writing about sumpting i usualy cant stop and it takes up a bit of my time.&nbsp; But, from now on&nbsp;I will try and not miss one.   So how has everyone's day been.&nbsp; Mine?&nbsp;Well,&nbsp;I jus&nbsp;woke up and its like 8:30 pm.&nbsp; I didnt go to bed till like noon today, had to do&nbsp;some bank stuff and mail some shit off. You now how it is.&nbsp; But hell iam still kinda tired, thinking about takin a power nap after i get done&nbsp;riting this.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmmm,&nbsp;Iam hungry too, stead of a power nap i might go eat some kichri.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yes, i think thats wut'll do.&nbsp; UUUUMMMM kichri!!&nbsp; &nbsp;All the kichri fans in the house say YEAAAAHHH!!&nbsp; Ok lol sorry about the kichri rant, but when u hungry u hungry.   Well guys, I guess this is it for now.&nbsp; I might post back later when Iam not so hungry.&nbsp;  Ohh and remember guys, please leave comments, how am i supposed to know if your laughin at me&nbsp; or actually enjoying.... the comment button is gona be on the bottom right of the post... its says  comments.

      Thank God Its Monday!!  For most of you, you dread Mondays.  Well for me Mondays are a welcome. Usually on Sundays i have to do a double shift. Can u belive no one wants to work on Sundays??  Sundays are the absolute worst day to work double shifts.  I mean it jus sucks.   First of all there is nottin on tv and all the customers are old.  Iam not saying old ppl are bad, but u kno.  Old customers are bad. Man they bitch and complain about every little thing.  Sometime they make me wanna grab my celly and hit up the old Grim Reaper on speed dial.  Or, be like calgone take them away!!  But i guess i shouldnt complain, old are not those customers are my livlihood. But i wish they were a bit nicer.  Well, gettin back to Mondays, Mondays are the best. I just sit at home and relax all day and  aint got shit to do.  Well i guess enuough on mondays.   How are all of you doing. I hope u guys enjoy reading this stuff. I have really noticed a jump in traffic since adding it, so i guess so.  I will try and keep it from gettin boring. But i dont see how that can happen, considering the exciting guy iam.   Oh, and guess what, Iam so excited. I bought some lottery tickets the other day, and I WON.  Yep Lucky 7's are the best, can u beileve i won the lottery.  It was 14 whole dollars, LOL had u goings for a while didnt I...suckers.  But hell, a 13 dollar profit isnt a bad day's work. I was just about to go and cash it in. What do u think i should do, get 10 bucks back and use 4 for more tickets or use it all for tickets.  Hmmm its a tough decision.  Well iam sure i can figure something out.     well, as I have mentioned, its Monday. Only 4 more days till Harold and Kumar. The commercials are really gettin me pumped up.  I was just about to go ahead and order my tickets on Fandango just in case it sold out. LOL.  Just kidding, i doutb it gona be sold out.  But u never kno, remember spiderman 1.  Damn now im gettin hungry, thinking about going to white castle my self.  But to bad all the white castle's around here are pretty nasty.  Maybe i still got some left over kichri from last night. uuuuuummmmm, kichri.  Ok thats it bye guys, Iam gona have myself a kichri party. I will post back later.

      Hello World,  Well it is yet another day in our great big wonderful world. Lol man I feel like Im on LSD. Naaaa, I think it jus lack of sleep. Oh well, on to greener pastures. I hope everyone had good week. Mine was pretty much uneventful, I had to go pick up some relatives, and this Chamber of Commerce thing. All in all it was cool. Oh and I went car shopping yesterday. Well more like window shopping. Lol That bastard didn't even give me a toaster for test driving a car, and listening to him speaking about shit (for 2 hours) I already knew. But it's cool, the car was off the chains. Maybe I might get it maybe not, Im pretty happy wit my car, well its really my mom's, and my sister's old car. It's like 10 years old and got 125k miles on it. But shit it still flies (120 easy) not that I drive that fast. But I think its time to trade-in the mighty max, for a younger sexier ride.  Well enuff car talk. Im not gona devoulge just yet wut I might get. Hey, have any of you seen "The Girls Next Door"? I saw it last night, to my amazment i actually liked it. Not really liked but jus liked it. I thought at a lota points, they tried to make it too much like Risky Business. But it was a good way to pass time so its coo. But, I tell ya, after watchin it I feel like filming a porn. Maybe even be the star. Well on to other movie news. I never did get a chance to go see Harold and Kumar, so I was like fuck it. I jus pirated it and watched it at home. Had a pretty good quality too. It was pretty funny, I can't wait till Harold and Kumar go to Amsterdam. I was just about to watch Shrek 2, but I thought let me update my readers about wut's been going on. And as u see, not hell of a whole lot. So I guess I just might go watch Shrek 2. I hope its good. I loved the first one, at first I didnt think it would be funny, but it was after I got into it ("do you want pina~ coladas").    Well guys I guess this is it for today. I will be back later tonight and do some posting. There probably won't be anythign exciting this weekend. My pops gone to texas for some gaam convention, so I'm gona be working some overtime. It's been a while since I been out but I might plan to go down to the Titans and Falcons scrimmage on Sat. Man it would kick ass to see Mike Vick play. If anybody wants to come just hit me up. It's gona be at the Nashville Colesium, I forgot the time but you can to Titansonline.com and I'm sure they will post it on there.

          John Elway after his first Super Bowl victory    As I was thinking of a topic this Mornin I was reading the espn website and watchin Sports Center. (side note: told you Kobe didn't rape that girl, she was a ho bag). Getting back to my topic, as I was reading and listening, I thought why don't I rite about what excites me the most during this time of the year. The Denver Bronocs. Its going to be a very interesting season I think, we got rid of Portis and got the Champ. I believe our running game will suffer a bit, but we have 3 good backs to take Portis's place. We also have veteran Garrison Hearst, so no need to jump off deep end on that. But our defense, oooohhhh man our defense, is gona be off the chains. We got Champ Bailey, the best corner back in the league, we also got John Lynch, Raylee Johnson, and Luther Ellis. On a sad note, we did loose Ian Gold. I thought we had a good chance to resign him, but when we drafted DJ Williams, he was gone. I thought he was one of the best young Will linebackers in the league. If it wasn't for his ACL he would have a breakout season last year. We also lost John Mobley due to a spinal cord bruise. I think this one hurts most of all, we still dont have his replacement. But considering how Gold and Mobley got hurt early last season, we still ended up like top 5 defense. The two replacements Keith Burns and Jashon Sykes were phenomenal. We will just have to wait and see if they can repeat that as replacements for Mobley and DJ Williams, if he cant get it done (he is a rookie so it will take some adjustment time). On the offense side, Jake Plummer is in his 2nd season as our starter and considering how good a year he had last year, its going to be amazing this year. Last year he started like 11 games and only ended up loosing one. Our running back situation is a wait and see kinda of thing. If Quinten Griffen can get it done then we will be alright, if not got lota other guys to take over. The receiver situation is more of a toss up. Ed McCaffrey and Shannon Sharpe retired, so Ahsley Lelie is gona have to step it up big time. He is in his 3rd year and has been inconsistent pas two years. We also got 2 decent rookies comin in who have really looked good in camp, Darrius Watts and Triandos Luke. We also got BJ Johnson from Texas as an undrafted free agent, but I haven't really heard much from him in camp. This guy was a back up to Roy Williams, at Texas. I thought he was good enough to be drafted in the 4th or 5th round, but he was undrafted. Shows how much I know. And as for our bread and butter, the O-line, this is also gona be a ? mark. We lost the legendary coach Alex Gibbs to the Falcons. This guys could coach anybody to be a badass offensive lineman, he was the master mind behind why our running game was always so badass. But I guess he wanted to open holes for Mike Vick. Most of all of our lineman are back, and we even signed All-American line man Shannon Snell from the Florida Gators. This guy was damn good in college, but I guess he was to under sized to be drafted. Well thats about it, we have a few question marks but I still think its gona be a great season for us. So look out everybody. Ohh and guess wut I get to go watch my first Broncos game in person this year. They are comin to play the Titans on Christmas Day. I just cant wait. Some of you may be wondering, "how the hell this fool become a Broncos fan when he lives like 1500 miles away, and has never been to Colorado?". Well to answer your question, I have been a die hard fan since '88 or '89, wow been like 15 years or so now. It all started with John Elway. He was the Man. I saw a Nestle Crunch commercial one day and I was like damn who is this guy throwing around the ball wit a hot chick. And became a fan. I didn't start becoming a die hard fan till they got their asses blown out by Montana in the Super Bowl. After I saw how Elway kept gettin knocked down, he would get right back up and play like he still had a chance to win. Even when they were down by 40 points he would jus sling the ball around. I was jus amazed, thinking hell if I was gettin my ass beat, I'd bench my self. But after that horrible game he gave me years of exciting football. Since his retirement I started becomin more of a team fan, and even with the Titans in town now I don't think I can ever switch allegiances. I go watch 2 or 3 Titans games a year, so I guess I can say they are my 2nd fav team.  Well guys this was a big or a run on, but its coo. Remember to root for the Broncos this season, they won't disappoint.  Later, Sam  Quote of the Day: " Mike Shanahanisn't going to settle for anything less than a Super Bowl.

      Hey wuts up folks, Well its a start of a new week. As have stated in earlier posts, Sucks to be you working 9-5 people. For me Monday is a day of celebration. My one day-a-week double shift day is over. Let the laziness begin.  I hope everyone had a good weekend. Personally I didn't do anything. I was real busy at the hotel this weekend and I couldn't go out. I even missed a friends b-day. Oh well he pretty old he's had plenty of them (LOL, sorry Bobby). I don't think I'll be as lazy as I wan be this week, we got a celebrity golf tournament in town. Vince Gill holds a tournament to raise money every year, so its gona be busy busy. Personally I hate golf. I have nothing against the game it self, but its a hate by association kinda thing. Long story really but some of you know it.  You know, I was makin such a big deal about Harold and Kumar all week, low and behold I was the only person I that didn't get a chance to watch it. I did have plans to watch it today (Monday), but a certain friend had canceled on me, shame on her. But I prolly watch it some this week. Everyone should go watch it, the reviews were really good, specially for a stoner movie.  Well, there really isn't anything else going on. I hope everybody out there in web land are having a more interesting life. Its been pretty dull here. I need to go jump out of an airplane, or jump off a bridge with a rubber band tied around my legs. Maybe I can get some excitement that way. Oh well, that's the way life is I guess.  On another note, I hope everyone watched the Democratic National Convention. It was really nothing interesting if you knew the canidates. If you were not familiar with Kerry and Edwards, then it was something you should have checked out. I tell ya, John Edwards is a real gifted speaker. He knows how to get the attention of the audience and keep it during the entire speech. Kerry on the other hand, was so caught up in trying to keep his speech from going to long, that he seemed he was all over the place. The whole "I'm John Kerry and I'm reporting for duty", was a bit overboard. But I guess he really wants to push that he served in Vietnam to the American public. Bush didn't serve so I guess it is a good strategy. Personally, I like the fact that a president who actually served is running the military, specially if he's got his finger on the football ( that's the briefcase that has all the nuclear launch codes and fire button). I really like Kerry, not just because he is a Democrat, but he is not over the top liberal. I usually like the moderate liberals. But make sure to pay attention to Republican Convention at the end of the month. I am sure Bush has got some more excuses of how the CIA screwed up. I think since the canidates are so close in the polls that a good debate is gona be wut decides this. Most of America don't vote for Democrat or Republican, they look at the canidate and his agenda for the country. After this whole Bush Administration I'm voting Democrat, Republicans always make me loose money. The last time I remember people complaining about business being so bad was when the first Bush was in office.  Well I guess thats enough for now about politics. I hope everyone has a good week and remember to go see Harold and Kumar, if you havnt already.  Later, Sam  Quote of the Day:  "I walked along the avenue.

      Hey guys,  Well its a sad day, the Bronocs lost on Monday. It came down to the end but since it was preseason, it doesnt really matter. It was actually a pretty boring game. Penalties every play, kinda sucked. Oh well time to move on.  So i hope is having good week so far. Mine seems to be falling apart. I guess I did end up jynxing my self. Well maybe I didnt do it to my self, maybe I'm just jynxed period. Oh well as i said that's life time to move on. I jus remembered this weekend is really gona suck beach balls. I gota work double shifts from Thursday to Monday. Desk clerk is going to Chicago so Iam stuck. It sucks Iam gona miss Sne's and Cheech's party this weekend. I might try to make it, but if I do i prob will only able to stay for like 10 mins, LOL. But I hope all of you are going, if your able that is. The last party that Sammy and all them threw was pretty fun, this one is gona be at the same place. U guys betta kick back a few for me, do the "I miss my homies" Tupac spill your drink thing, that karias do. Lol I swear ppl come up with the wierdest things.  Well guys I guess this is it for today, Iam kinda in a depressed mood so Iam gona cut this short.

      Well guys its finally NFL time. The Hall of Fame Game is on tonight on Monday Night Football. The Broncos play the Redskins. I'm sure we will win thoough, it was a very exciting weekend to be a Broncos fan. John Elway was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame yesterday. I just cant wait, I had to work last night, and I still cant sleep. But Iam sure I will get in a couple hours before the game starts.  So how was everyone's weekend. Mine was pretty busy. Lorretta Lynn had some kinda race at her ranch, hmmm and I didnt even kno she was still alive. Ohh well, long as she brought me bizness. Other than renting rooms I really didnt get a chance to do much. It was actually kinda boring. But I think this is gona be a very exciting next couple of weeks for me, NFL preseason starts today, College Football starts in a few weeks and I got something else I'm workin on. I dont wanna jynx it so I will jus leave it at that. But, knowing my luck it will all get screwed up. All the offensive starters on the Bronocs prob be out the whole season wit injuries, all the defensive starters on the VOLS will get injured, and the special teams on my lil project will all go to hell. Wel i guess thas life. But i guess u just gota reload and hope u dont miss fire again.  Well enuff of all that negative talk, its time to stay positive. Iam positive my luck suxx,( lol jus kiddin). Well anyways, I gota go run some errands I will post back later. Sorry bout no posts this past weekend, as I stated earlier I was busy.
