      Hey everyone, Craving the Word is playing at starved rock lounge today, and lightwalker is playing at daniel's den at 7:oopm.  Other than that i have nothing else going on.    The location    There is a "haunted" barn outside of mendota, and when I say haunted i really mean demon inhabbited.  there has been many sitings of strange and unusual things.  Also, when your there you can feel the evil dwelling there.  The history of this barn is that it use to house slaves and farm equipment.  The slaves, however, were often beatten to death and mutilated beyond recognition.  Hint, hint, the reason they think it's haunted.    The question    I have no expirience in casting of demons but i do know how to.(was taught by Richard Laribee)  Now my question for anyone who can read this, is it pointless to cast them out if they're in a deserted barn not bothering anyone?  Or is that irrelivent and i should bring some one to cast them out?  don't worry, I am aware that when casting demons it can be very dangerous which is why i would bring Richard or some other expirience person to that place.  So with that aside, please give me your opinion.

       Hey everyone.&nbsp; I hope all of you are doing well and getting good quiet times.&nbsp; And if not, read one chapter a day out of the Purpose-Driven Life by Rick Warren and it will give you everything you need except prayer time.&nbsp; I posted my notes on Dee ann's bible study, so&nbsp;check it out. &nbsp;    The situation      One day in class, a boy was being persecuted for his faith.&nbsp; The boy sat there and took the verbal abuse.&nbsp; This happened every day for weeks.&nbsp; Until, one day the boy didn't come to school.&nbsp; The other kids were happy that he was gone and sad that he wasn't there to be persecuted.&nbsp; The boy wasn't there because he was home praying with his father the help him overcome this abuse.&nbsp;      The stand up      &nbsp;The next day, his peers were shocked to see him walk into class with nothing other than his bible.&nbsp; Using this as a fuel for there demonic attack, they furiously persecuted him with all they had.&nbsp; The boy stopped, opened his bible and quoted, "Give to them according their work and according to the evil&nbsp;of their deeds; give to them according to the work of their hands; render them their due reward.&nbsp; Because they do not regard the works of the Lord or the work of his hands, he will tear them down and build them up no more." (Psalm 28:4-5)&nbsp; Then the boy turned and sat down at his desk.      The benefit      &nbsp; After hearing this, his peers were shook up at fear of what God will might do to them.&nbsp; They started asking him questions about where they're going when they die, and how can they get to heaven.&nbsp; The next day, seven of the eight peers persecuting him asked Jesus Christ into there heart during recess.&nbsp;       -----------------------       I have experienced persecution from friends, family, peers, and others of the body.&nbsp; If your in that place where your stuck between the persecuting rocks of demonic attacks and society, your not alone.&nbsp; In fact, your better off than you think. " Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven."&nbsp;&nbsp;  (Matthew 5:10)&nbsp; If Satan is going through the trouble of having you persecuted, it's because he has a reason.&nbsp; He does it because your doing something he doesn't want you to do, and he will attack you as often as it takes to make you stumble.&nbsp; But Satan doesn't have the weapon that we do.&nbsp; We have God! We have the Alpha and the Omega! We have the creator of the universe on our side!&nbsp; And he ha equipped you with everything you need to overcome any and all the thing Satan can through at you!&nbsp; The only time you can stumble, is when you cut off that life line.&nbsp; That's why God wants you to in contact with him daily.&nbsp; Not just because he loves you or cares about you or because he died for you, which is reason enough, but because you  need  the life line of Christ.&nbsp; If you take things into you own hands you cut the vine of Christ right off , and that's when you stumble!&nbsp; God will not abandon you completely though.&nbsp; For you are still his child, you just tried to walk before you could crawl, that's all.&nbsp; If you need more information on this, or just more scripture references, check out Psalms 120 and 121.

      Today i helped with VBS and had a great time too.&nbsp; Just waiting on bible study tonight which will be held at 7:00pm and given by Dee ann Worrel.&nbsp; I will take notes on the study and post them for you all to view.   The random moment   Two peers where at a party, each of the opposite sex.&nbsp; The punch in which they were drinking was spiked.&nbsp; The two got drunk and committed the act of pre-marrital sex.&nbsp; Eight months later, a baby boy was born and given up for adoption.&nbsp; He grew up in a secular home in which God was mocked often and even use as a person to blame there poverty on.&nbsp;    The mystery that saves   The&nbsp;boy, who is now 17,&nbsp;was walking home from the police department after watching his foster-father confess to fraud, theft, and murder,&nbsp;when he came upon a black book, lying in the road.&nbsp; He picked it up and begain to read the page that was marked with a flower bookmark.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the page, he read  ," For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, so those who believe in him shall not perish but have everlasting life.  "&nbsp;&nbsp; The young man was truely touched.&nbsp; He went home and shared it with his foster-mother who was too stoned to understand him.&nbsp; So he left and went down the street to a church that he had never been to.&nbsp; There, a young pastor witnessed him ask Jesus Christ into his heart.&nbsp;     The random event has meaning   The young man had been attending church regularly, as well as youth group when his father went on trial.&nbsp; His mother hung herself after hearing her husband sentenced to 57 years.&nbsp; The young pastor adopts him.&nbsp; After times of trial and suffering, he developed a program that has saved over a million people and is still saving!   The moral   Somethings seem to happen at random, but the truth is that all those random events like seeing someone you haven't seen in a while, or even the meaningless sex you had a a party one night have all happened for a purpose.&nbsp; Gods purpose!

       Hey everyone. I trust your all ok and serving. Todays blog is an effort to explain how i writ these blogs. so if you are or were curious, read below.   "in the spirit"   When someone says "in the spirit" they mean they were being used by God directly. For example, when i write these blogs, I do it in the spirit. God is writing these, not me. My blogs are fiction, but based on real events. So basicly i'm saying that God puts event into my head, turn on my creativity, and while I'm writing he works in the morals of the stories.    ...in the spirit   When i write a song, the only songs i keep are the ones i wroter in the spirit. The spirit bring out the truth as well as the great. For insistance, people offer up there most meaningful prayers and most honest confessions when they are broken. God brakes you of your stubborness, pride, envy, falsehood, and even some sins, and then he send his spirit upon you. Not meaning you didn'  t have it before but that you didn't feel it or listen to it or talk to it.

      Hey everyone! After a good nights sleep and a nice breakfast, I feel filled with energy and not tired because of the Sweet Corn Festival. I hope for the same with all of you who helped and especially the leaders.  I have also updated weekly scripture.   In a world of followers,...   In society today, we often try to follow false idols. We commit idolatry over and over again with meaningless things. Some may follow the stock market or money. Other may follow something more pointless like brand clothing. There are literally millions of people worshiping and following things like candy, the color black, music, TV, movies, Magic, video games, war, and even fecal matter. Even Christians commit idolatry as often as the next man. We all are so caught up with our precious little things that we don't realize what our role model was like. Jesus didn't need the newest Nike sandal. He didn't need the boot-cut undergarments. He didn't need the newest Craftsmen wood working tool to work. He didn't need a Serta mattress to get sleep at night. No, all Jesus need was his faith. He humbled himself from God to poor carpenter from Nazareth. (which was the wrong side of the tracks)   So why can't humble myself from sophisticated musician to poor follower of Christ who is guaranteed a bumpy road ahead and persecution. Since he didn't need brand name why should I? Here is an analogy for you. If your shopping at Old Navy, start shopping at salvation army. If your Going out to eat at Red Lobster, start going out to eat at your neighbors garbage can. If your a high level executive, your now a garbage man.   ...Dare to be a leader!   Now today people in ministry take years to save twenty people and get them involved with church. I'm talking about people who have money to finance their ministry and people to help. This carpentry from the wrong side of the tracks had only 12 helpers, didn't even know when his next meal would be, and was only in the ministry for three years. Now a days, the majority of people who attend these outreach programs are saved and there is usually only 50 people. When Jesus had an outreach program there were endless crowds of unbelievers, and guess what? They wanted to know how to believe and what to believe!   ??????????   Dare to be a leader! If you are a leader I challenge you to be bold.    When was the last time you had endless crowds of unbelievers asking you how to get saved and what they should believe?

      Hey everyone. I hope your all doing well. I updated the weekly scripture so check it out. Tonight I'm going to go see THE VILLAGE with Todd.   All systems go   School is drawing ever so close and I can't help but notice the changes going on pre, during, and post school year. For instance, I'm more organized and more active in my scripture reading when I'm in school. I think it's because I'm more disciplined during the school year than when I'm not. My brain is constantly at work during the school year. So now that I'm going to be going to be in school again I'm changing back into that organization mode that I'm lacking at the moment. So, in the words of Lane Mauch, I'm turning on and "all systems are go." I like being organized and hope to be disciplined enough to stay on track this year.   The scripture back-up   Being disciplined is good. Do not despise discipline, because the Lord is also discipline.    "Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but he who hates reproof is stupid."   -Proverbs 12:1   "For the Lord reproves him whom he loves, as a father the in whom he delights."   -Proverbs 3:12

        Can't find your way?      If your are one of the many people who are lost in the darkness and need a light unto your path, there's only one thing bright enough to illuminate the darkness for you. That my friend is the Word. When I say the "Word", I mean many things. So let me tell you plainly what I mean. The word is truth. The word is the way. The word is in us. The word created the heavens and the earth. "the grass will wither and the flowers will fade, but the word will last forever." The word is immortal. The word is love. The word is kindness. The word is patience. The word is gentle. The word is fruitful. The word faithful. The word is the alpha and omega. The way, truth, and life. The word died for our sins. The word rose from the died. The word brings us to life daily.   The word is Jesus Christ, son of man,messiah. The word is God.       How to obtain the light     If you want a light unto your path, if you want to brought to eternal life, if you want to go to heaven when you die, then there is only one way. Jesus said  "the only way to my father is through me."   So if you want salvation, confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus came, died for you on the cross, rose again, and he is God.       Please post your faith      If you are already saved, please post it in   Red   text. If you are not saved, please post it in   Blue   text.     If you saved now because you have just accepted the blood of the lamb (salvation) please post it in   Green   text.

       Hey everyone, today I got up at 9:30 am, and procrastinated until five minutes ago. Given that, I am in a bit of a hurry.       The Sit-Rep     When ever I'm with Matt, Todd, or Sarah, we end up talking about dating. They ask who I want to date, which is irrelevant at this point, and what determines that I want to date them. So I say that I am looking for courtship and I have not found my future wife yet. Then they ask what am I looking for to determine my future wife, and I say that she has to be like Colleen. Before I can finish, the poke fun at the first part of my sentence. So then, after they had their laugh, I tell them what I mean.     The trait     The trait I'm looking for that Colleen has is what the bible terms,"Fear of God." Which I must not fully understand that phrase. Because what I mean is a women who seeks worship like I do. A women who desires something like SQT over watching a movie, and a women that can change me in my faith. Not just a saved women but a women who is worshipful. I'm not saying that I don't know anyone who has these traits, but that I have not found one who has the quantity of these traits that I'm looking for.
