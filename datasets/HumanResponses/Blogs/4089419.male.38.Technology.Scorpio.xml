       I know..It almost sounds like an old Maury Povich show topic. Throw in "and are also in love with your brother" and  then  it would be Maury Povich material. You've all seen them. The women dressed in the fashionable crop top and tight jeans with a wide leather belt with some sort of metal adornment on it. Sexy? Some say Yes! Is it still sexy when the tight jeans squeeze a big roll of fat over the top of the belt and the crop top rides up over the roll so that you can see the belly jiggle with every step? This incautious observer says NO!  I know, I know, It seems that I'm buying into the stereotype that the perfect female body doesn't have an ounce of fat on it and belongs in a lingerie magazine, but that is far from the case. My father told me when I was a young boy that  there is no such thing as an ugly woman . I can remember pointing one out when he told me that, but he said that I'd understand one day. That day came and I believe that he was right. But I also understand that they make bigger clothes for bigger people. Fat people can't fit into skinny people clothes and if they try the fat just follows the path of least resistance. Rules to Follow: If you look down and can see bottom hem of your shirt and your belly, but not your belt buckle...Change clothes! When you're dressed to go out in public, try sticking your thumb underneath your belt from the top. If you have to lift a roll out of the way to do it...Change clothes!  People aren't looking at you because you look good, they're looking at you and going "What the hell is wrong with you!?"

       What is it about a lot of parents these days that seems to make them feel that if they just proceed to wherever the hell it is that they're going, their kids will just follow them? I'm not talking about 9 and 10 year old kids, but kids that look to be between 3 and 6. Guess what! A 4 year old kid has no sense of direction, no thoughts of avoiding collisions with the sea of legs around him or her, and definitely not enough speed to keep up with your normal gait. Yet I see parents all the time walking 15 feet ahead of their kids, not paying attention to them, and every once in a while turn around and scold the kid for not keeping up or causing a traffic jam in front of him because no-one wants to run the kid over! Come on parents, What the hell is wrong with you?!

       I wanted to call this Blog the Madcap, but that was already taken.  A quick look at Rogets Thesaurus revealed the word Incautious.  I like that word and the connotations that you receive upon hearing or saying it.  I see things on a daily basis that just make me shake my head and say ..hmmmm..  or more often "What the hell is wrong with you!".  This is my Blog.  And so this is the place for my rants and or raves, take them as you will for they may be "Incautious" from time to time.

       Why is rap music so popular today? To be more specific, why has the unintelligible english put forth by such talents as 50Cent, Snoop Dog, 2 Dimes and a Nickel, or the Notorious MushMouth so pervasive in today's society? Okay, 2 Dimes and a Nickel and the Notorious MushMouth aren't real rappers, but are the names so far-fetched? Maybe the allure is cultural, or a sign of the times. Maybe it reflects the life experiences of a poor, inner city youth who has struggled to leave that harsh existence behind. But the latter can't always be true, because you never hear about the drive by shooting performed by a rival from the seat of a riding lawnmower in a nice middle class neighborhood, where many rap performers  actually  came from.  Now we throw into the mix the non-African American kids who walk, talk, act and dress like gang bangers, or what is now referred to as "urban" style. We can no longer understand what they are saying. We want to tell them nothing more than to pull up their pants, but we are afraid that they wouldn't understand us. No longer is their language peppered with a new slang term here and there. Now their whole pattern of speaking is slang. It has invaded their writing and spelling, and alienates them from anyone who doesn't understand them. Say for instance their English teacher, perhaps? People for whom english is a second language sound particularly ridiculous when that english is speckled with 'dis and 'dat and 'yo. But then again does any of that really matter, because after all, they will all be huge rap stars one day, 'yo?  White kids in their bid for acceptance in the black community have come to be known in that community by such endearing terms as "Wigger". There are surely other terms equally as flattering. Kids in general seem to have no regard or understanding for "acceptable" speech and behavior. Maybe one day "acceptable" will change to relect today's rap mentality standards. If that were to happen, then the next time that you go into a job interview and the question, "How would you deal with a rude customer?" is asked of you, the answer could very well be, "I'd bus a cap in dat ass, yo, ain't nobody gon disrespekt me like dat!" (make sure to move your hand in abrupt up and down gestures and tilt your head to the side to further imply your sincerity when giving this answer. the interviewer will be mightily impressed)  Americans as a society see these things happen. They are a part of our freedoms. We influence the world with our actions. This can be observed in that rappers are pervasive in many foreign countries now. Americans are also driven to excess and that is reflected in the urban mentality today. A form of entertainment that should have found a small niche at best, has taken over the society of America's young people, and is shaping the mentality of its small children. Cultural icons such as Bill Cosby see it happening and condemn it. African Americans saw this and said, wait a minute. Bill Cosby is one of us, how can he say those things? He can say those things because this is America, and he just calls it like he sees it. White people aren't going to use his comments as weapons against African American society, because the problems are just as pervasive in white society.  What the hell is wrong with  us?!
