      Suntanned Sublime Sunrise, horizon line Some days I can’t find Way in way out Of mind  At dawn Clouds curl like cotton swab in ear They poke Rise (leave) as smoke  Thoughts fall out of my  Head  I rise Pure In the shine of God’s yawn  ____________________________________   [Somebody's awfully minimalist today, eh?]

      To DC.  Yes, to DC.   All roads lead there, it seems.  Always.   I leave in the morning. Next step in the new job search. Sort of. Heading down to see a friend who's dancing off to London shortly for study.   Secondarily, to meet people who might help lead me to a job on Capitol Hill. (Her recommendation.  I typically don't like networking; it seems unfair. Of course, I'm not exactly being held to gunpoint on this trip.)  Yes, I must be crazy.   I haven't really shared the (sub)story that landed me on this blog. So, here it is, the short-short version. (If you've heard this, skip. Last time I share it.)   I quit newspaper job. Why? It  urlLink sucked   . I travel. Brazil. Joy.  Grandfather (de facto dad) dies. I mourn. (Family falls apart.) I spend $1000 to do so (plane/hotel/car last minute).  Stepbrother steals $1000 from me. (I loaned it; he never paid back. Has disappeared. On trial for agg assault; was attempted murder. He said needed for lawyer. Truth? Gambling. He shafted everyone. Knew I shouldn't trust; but shouldn't have to investigate family.) Apply for jobs.  Get (3) job offers.  Pass on 2.  Take 1. A press secretary position for US Senate campaign in NH.  Candidate abruptly drops out. Campaign manager  (Ethical Zero)  disappeared(!). Up to $400,000 missing. Forgery, fraud, & now FBI.  Investigation proceeding.   Job gone.  Gone.  Gone.  Start all over again.  Near broke. Joy.   Which brings me to DC.  One of my favorite cities, once you exclude most people working there.  DC.  All roads.   [Filled w/ potholes.]   Nothing like hardship to forge a great writer.

      Unexpected generosity.   I don't know what to do with it.  Besides say thank you. And accept it.   I used to deny it. Turn away from it. Politely say thank you & reject. I wonder if that was pride.   I've never been good accepting gifts.   But here it is. People offering help when I have no right to it. Friends -- even aquaintances -- stepping forth.   It's humbling. Perhaps that's good.   I've always been the one to show the unexpected generosity. I wonder now if that's prideful. Some people don't care.   Well, it's 1:46 a.m. & I'm way too tired to be eloquent. So I'll stop now. No details.

      So...  I've been trying to make each post to this blog mean something. Or be about something. Part of that whole "worth writing" thing.   Whether that's right or wrong I don't know. It just happened. [And now it's over.] Like most things in life.   The whole blog phenomenon passed me by. There were the pioneers, the second wave, the followers, & the stragglers. I like to think I'm joining the blog world long after it's trendy (maybe it can even be passe), so this blog can just be what it is -- judged on its own merits, have some intrinsic value, be an  interesting  collection of writings or whatever -- rather than be just another collection of crap on the Web.   I've always been sort of the anti-trend type.  No, check that. Not anti-trend. But never quite with the trends.  I wear ripped jeans that got torn because I wore them too much, not because of the style. Grew my hair long just because I didn't feel like cutting it (someone at my last job said to someone else that it was quite the "fashion statement"; you know, because it's not possible it's no statement at all). Etc.  For example, I loved the band Blues Traveler for years after my cousin introduced me to them back in 1994 (when the Dave Matthews Band was the unknown opening act of the HORDE festival). Then they released their first album intended to be mass-marketed, complete w/ singles, MTV videos & everything.   It sucked, of course.  Naturally, everyone else loved it.   It took a good blues album from Traveler to get me back following the band. By then, they were yesterday's news. But they were playing good music again. That's what mattered. Not the trend. Nor the newness.   So back to the blogosphere. And this blog. This entry.  My first rambling, meandering entry.   I really do write & think in the ways that I wrote these other entries. But I think this way too.   In tangents. Webs.  I drive down the Interstate highway & don't know my exit until I see it.  That's how I tell stories, that's how I think. My mind's always open to distractions.   I love distractions.   Which brings me back to only writing something if it's "worth writing".   Tangents are worth writing. Focus too closely on a point & you might miss all the unexpected color surrounding you.   You never know when an epiphany will happen.

      Big government, big blustering, & Big Brother:   Yes, the Bush administration.   But you already knew that. So let’s skip to what people either don’t realize or seldom say:     A true conservative should hate these guys.    They’ve grown the American bureaucracy (& even tagged it with a name – Dept. of Homeland Defense – that sounds like it was coined in the Fatherland, circa 1940), increased government monitoring of (& intrusion into) private lives, & --  [Do I really need an 'and' here?]   This is not the party of Roosevelt & Lincoln.   It’s not even the party of Reagan.  Teddy Roosevelt would chew the Cheney(!) boys up & eat them for breakfast.  Then he’d puke.   Whatever happened to Roosevelt’s “Speak softly & carrying a big stick”?   This government brags & blusters yet wields an impotent one. Army Chief of Staff General Eric Shinseki said we’d need more soldiers to handle Iraq; Rumsfeld proved him right by ignoring him.   What happened to Lincoln’s “If given the truth, they can be depended upon to meet any national crisis”?   Going into Iraq was the right thing to do because of who & what America is. They didn’t need to lie to us to justify it. Those lies make us question everything.   What about Reagan’s “Concentrated power has always been the enemy of liberty”?  Today the state grows stronger; the individual grows weaker.  I never thought I’d have to vote Democrat to cut the government’s strength. Apparently, I was wrong.

      The rules of this blog are as follows:  1) No lies.  2) No lies. 3) No lies.  4) If it's not worth writing, don't write it.  5) No self-censoring; except when you feel like self-censoring.  6) Must be stream-of-consciousness. No deliberate, hour-long sessions to write one entry. If the words don't fly out, then you're not writing True. Edit all you want afterwards, but get out the honest thought & explore the path you lay out for yourself. The voice doesn't even need to be your own. Just write True.  7) Show pure, innate  Possibility . 8) Break any rule when necessary.

      I always loved the potheads.   Oh yeah. Growing up, had to love all those rich kids with too much cash on their hands & nothing to do with it. The cool kids, with their nice cars, tickets to all the concerts, and weed in the pockets.   Loved them.  Shrooms, Ecstasy, Angel Dust – whatever.  Cash. These kids were money.  Wonder how they’re doing today.   Cause you see, I know.  I know where they go in 20 to 30 years.  Where their dreams go to die, when they want memory to fade & life to swallow them up so they can just  forget .  I know, dammit. I know.   Cause the chemicals, they never go away, you see. Nuh uh.   There was always weed, the drug for the whole family, then heroin in the 70s, coke in the 80s. Heroin made a nice little comeback recently, but that’s ok, because it never affected us. Nah. We were busy elsewhere.   Today’s drug-pushers drive BMWs & wear white coats.   See, most docs know full well it’s quicker to medicate someone than to fix them. Get them in & out of the office so we can get to more patients, get out in time to get to the golf course, & make enough cash for a nice little shore house. With the drug companies stuffing the docs’ pockets, there’s never a shortage of drugs. And with the pharmaceutical companies floating all that money on advertising costs, people have ‘drugsdrugsdrugs’ pummeled into their head.   Ridalin Nation. That’s us.  Percoset, oh blessed Percoset, how we adore thee.  And then our old fave, morphine. Oh, did you think morphine had gone away? That it wasn’t coming back?   Yeah, so did I.   But I was wrong. You were wrong. We were all wrong.   People don’t get better. They just get medicated. Fooled into believing their problem is gone just because they can’t feel the pain. Conditioned into thinking this is OK by decades of drug use. Meet the hippies, 30 years later. I know them well.   But I am not them.  I want the pain.  I want to feel the knife slice through my sides, tear muscles from bone, destroy ligaments.  I want the pain. No drugs for me.  You will not have me, you greedy, betraying doctors, who will without a second thought hand me four different drugs (including a steroid) to treat my common cold.    I am pure.   Stay away from my family.

      I got darkness here.  I got a lack of stars,  Missing planets --  I got lightless night.  I got a feeling that distorts.  A tearing that won’t stop.        Closeness.   A suntan in a bottle.  A singsong sound in my sighs. A sadness that isn’t there anymore.        Because it’s gone.       That darkness is gone.   I have lightness in my footsteps,  Tightness in my triceps,  A frightening, widening concept:             Joy.       I’ve got joy.       I’ve got a boy.  Cause Peter Pan wasn’t the only one To learn That children's souls needn't lose  Buoyancy.

      There always had to be a day after, They said.   They said lots of things, you know, They, Them & Those. I hear they’re still saying them. All sorts of wisdom, popping out of Their mouths. Never ends.  But there ain’t much of it that matters. See, you got to figure out early on who’s spouting wisdom and who’s spouting pride masquerading as wisdom. The BS-lobby’s got all sorts of contributors.   Ralph Wiley wasn’t one of them.    Here was guy with something to say and plenty to hear. You can tell the good ones by how much they listen. They’ve figured out you learn a lot more by listening than you do by talking. That’s how guys become wise men. Wiley was both.    Wiley the Wise Man  urlLink died Sunday  of heart failure. Fifty-two years old. The end snuck up like an R-Dub stealth epiphany.  There was no Day After for Ralph Wiley. Happens to everyone once. Ralph Wiley just got his.   Damn shame.   Wiley was the best sportswriter around. No one working the trade today was even in his league. Oh yeah, you got some contenders – Whitlock from the KC Star, Pasquarelli & Alan Grant of ESPN.com -- but mostly you got pretenders, guys who never stopped worshipping or knocking the athletes they wished they were; hacks who figured out a way to get paid to watch sports; cranks who should’ve cashed in their chips 20 years ago.   Then there was Ralph Wiley.   Wiley had a mind, a clue, & a set of brass cymbals that he clanged a few times a week.  Here was a guy who called it like he saw it & saw it more clearly than most.  Here was a guy who didn’t need someone else to do his thinking for him. Like all the great ones, he had his best moment when we were having our worst. He proved once again he was far more than just a sportswriter. 9/11. Didn’t mouth the same old “This reminds us that sports aren’t so important after all.” No. Not this one.  Instead,  urlLink Wiley said  exactly what half of us were thinking (hoping) after 9/11: that he suspected some athletes we’d never known had taken down Flight 93 in a Pennsylvania field. That  this  was what being an athlete was about: The ex-baller from the Harbor slipping on down the aisle like AI bringing it home, right behind his lead blocker, a high school fullback now taking out a terrorist.   Just like all us ex-jocks hoped we'd do.   Damn.   Ralph Wiley’s dead today. What the hell does that mean?    urlLink Archive of Wiley's ESPN columns

      In the beginning, there was white, and black laid on white. Thoughts became concrete & tangible entities, saved for eternity(?). There was writing, & it was good.  Or was it?   How the hell should I know?   That's about all the pretentiousness you'll get from me in this blog.  This is my first journal entry here. I've put off the urge for months (years?) to start a blog & enter the scattered universe of scattered bloggers. More mist in the miasma, babbling among the blabbers, nonsense among nonsequiturs (a word I refuse to spell correctly) -- that's all I'd be.  So:  1) Why now? 2) What changed today?  Answers:  1) Because I feel like it at this moment, and Now is all that matters.   2) Oh, don't get me started.  So: 3) Who am I?  Answer: 3) Just some dude.  And more, of course, but I'm tired of resumes. You have to sell yourself in resumes. Market yourself. The antithesis of humility. I'm a humble guy. Or at least I like to think I am, or wish I was.  Nice & simple: I'm a 27-year-old ex-reporter/columnist who won enough newspapers awards to realize they don't mean a damn thing & helped enough people to realize that's  all  that mattered. I'm also an ex-poet, ex-actor, ex-jock, ex-boyfriend, ex-son, ex-politicalcampaignmanager, ex-automechanic, ex-librariantype, ex-cook -- no wait, I still cook like a bandit.  I quit my last newspaper six months ago after concluding that the roguish, independent, free-spirited, hard-working, save-the-world-a-little-piece-at-a-time idealistic journalist was now being replaced by Dilbertesque drones inside cubicles who lived by telephones, never got dirty, & long ago gave up on their dreams in exchange for the financial security provided by the corporate monstrosities that now masquerade as media companies.  (Deep breath.)  These people weren't making a difference in people's lives. It didn't take long, once I moved to this paper, to see this, and I soon realized if I didn't leave, I'd turn into them. So I quietly left this job -- without theatrics, and with two weeks notice. They weren't bad people; in fact, most were quite nice. They just weren't what I aspired to be.  I refuse to sacrifice my aspirations. I refuse to accept lower expectations. I refuse to compromise myself.  I am the stubborn actor who, in theater class, must fall straight backward into the awaiting arms of a classmate who's supposed to catch me. Whether Fate catches me or just lets me bounce off the floor like a basketball, I will continue to drop like this. Whether I am caught or crack my head on the floor doesn't matter.  I'll get right back up & do it again every time.  & I'll grin a bandit's crooked grin & know full well that I am one of The Honest Ones.

      So what happened? Where did I go? All that writing in a flourish and then  BOOM!  Nothing?   Well, no. Not quite.   I've been writing. Writing like a bandit on fire.  Just not here. Elsewhere.  I mean, yeah, from this same computer.  And in this same room.  But not on this blog.  Because it's not ready to publish yet.  No, I haven't fallen into the "I'm going to edit posts to death" trap.  No sir.  A novel. Yes, a novel.  It has begun.   Three years in the making.  Three years ago is when the idea first popped in my head. A question, a simple question, that's all it was. But it led to other questions, and other questions, and still more questions.   Questions that finally have answers. I'd put it down because I didn't think I was capable of writing it yet. And I was right; I wasn't.   So I tried to think of other ideas. Other books I could write. I started a few. Less ambitious ones. But they never went anywhere. Probably because I didn't want them to.  I've never been one to settle. For anything.   Not jobs, not women, not fates, and surely not novels.   It came to me in May.  Then I put it down. Circumstances. Was supposed to relocate.   Then didn't. Aforementioned (past post) crooked dirtbag politician wannabe.   I went back to the novel on the bus trip back from DC. I was reading Asimov's Foundation. (Re-reading, actually. Read it first when I was 11 or 12; amazingly, forgot EVERYTHING.) Finished the 1st book, then it turned out I'd brought the 3rd instead of the 2nd book. Well, that sucked.   But, of course, I had a notebook w/ me. Don't even know what prompted me to write. Just did.  I just about filled the book.  And I kept writing when I got home.   Right now I have 40-50 pages of written notes. About 100-150 notes on my comp, mostly (but not all) C&Ped research from online.   Started writing this week.  I'm 2 chapters in. 25 pages. Not much. Got broken up because I headed back down to DC for a job interview.   But I think it's good.  No. I know it's good.  If I can do what I'm hoping I can, this will be good. Real good.  This could be great.   Let's see what I got.
