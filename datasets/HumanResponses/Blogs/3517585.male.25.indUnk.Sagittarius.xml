      Ouija Board destroyed the field in todays Oaks.  The race was run at a slow early pace but she still clocked a time 0.55 seconds faster than Warrsan in the Coronation Cup earlier in the day.  Running out a six length winner from the Duke's tip All Too Beautiful, Ouija Board looked impressive to say the least.  Godolphin's pair were slightly disappointing, Sundrop ruining her chance by pulling early on and Punctilious predictably failing to find sufficient speed to go with them 2 1/2 furlongs out.  All Too Beautiful is a filly to follow, losing little in defeat - she looks to still have improvement when she matures through the Summer.  Ouija Board, though, looks one to take on the colts this season. Result: 1 Ouija Board 2 All Too Beautiful 3 Punctilious

      Much of the media coverage of today's Vodaphone Oaks has surrounded Godolphin's market leaders Sundrop and Punctilious and Frankie Dettori's choice between the two.  Both have obvious claims and command the utmost respect, but I am going to oppose them both with Aidan O'Brien's impeccably bred filly All Too Beautiful.  A full sister to 2002 Derby winner Gallileo, she will relish the step up in trip, and impressive in her two starts (both won) she must have plenty of improvement to come.  With the British punters sure to be keen on Frankie, All Too Beautiful may well go off at a tasty price.  Recommended bet: 2 points win All Too Beautiful Predicted 1-2-3: All Too Beautiful Sundrop Punctilious

      Snow ridge must be backed to give Frankie Dettori a first Derby win on Saturday.  The son of Indian Ridge was impressive enough in the Guineas, apparently at his minimum trip from this point onwards, to hold the best form claims in the lineup.  A postmark rating of 122 for the Newmarket race leaves him five pounds clear of his rivals.  In what looks like a substandard renewal, he will take the beating.    The Stoute trained North Light looked like he had imminent improvement in him when taking the Dante a shade cleverly, and rates the biggest danger.  Of the rest, American Post is possibly good enough but should find the ground too hard.  Salford City looked like he would stay further when a running on sixth in the 2000 Guineas, but if he again fails to start well from the stalls, he could have too much to do late on.  One for a small outside bet may be Meath.  O'Brien's new first string following the disappointing withdrawal of former favourite Yeats, Meath has gained valuable experience in Ireland, looks to be consistently improving and it would be no surprise to see him run in to a place if some of the market leaders fail to fulfill their promise.  Recommended bet: 4 points win Snow Ridge Predicted 1-2-3: Snow Ridge                  North Light                  Meath

      As the opening salvo is fired in the Dragao Stadium Porto, this Saturday at 5pm, Europe's finest will begin battle to be crowned European Champions. It looks a stiff test for all involved, indeed there's a strong case for placing this as the most difficult of the international honours to grasp.  We'll all enjoy watching the worlds best referee, Pierluigi Collina, afixing his thousand yard stare and blowing his whistle to kick things off this weekend but for those punters looking for some value over the first few days of action this commentator reckons you can do alot worse than betting the draw over all eight of the opening matches.  Team psychology will play a major factor here, with everyone anxious to get off to a good start many teams will collectively feel they would settle for a draw. With the best six or seven teams very much evenly matched and the European power clubs providing a host of the top performers there should be few surprise packages in store.  Allied with the slightly better odds to be taken for draws in general these factors combine to make this the bet to go for. If'd you'd placed the same bet to a tenner per match last time around you'd have won Â£99.50.  Recommended Bet: One point draw each opening game.  Yours, guest pundit,  Jack Panter

      There are plenty of interesting races to get your teeth into today, and the 3.05 at Sandown is certainly one of them.  Sir Michael Stoute sends out Faayej just eleven days after a C&D win on similar going to that which he faces today.  That was his first outing this year, and while his breeding suggests the ground may be a little firm, he has stepped up well on last season's form and its worth chancing he can progress again.  The THIRD bet of the day comes in the 3.15 at York.  Likely favourite Forever Phoenix will not be happy to see the knicker elastic making another appearance after last week's fiasco at Epsom.  On that occasion Eddie Ahern had to walk her down the hill after she was left faing the wrong way at the start and this punter's cash was left behind the Ladbrokes counter. (Well played Paddy Power who refunded all bets on the filly)  Eddie will be more wary today, and crucially so will the starter, and if she jumps off sharply, could look a very big price a furlong or two out.  Recommended bets:  3.05 Sandown - 1 point win Faayej 3.15 York - 0.5 points win Forever Phoenix

      Daryll Holland rides Oasis Star in the SBJ Group Classified Stakes at 2.35 at Sandown today.  Fifth of eighteen in a well contested Class B handicap ( won other three starts), she need only repeat her effort to lead this small field past the post.  The mile trip last time out took the sting out of her, and the drop back to 7f should seal fate.  Hatch has been consistent, but hasn't enjoyed watching others make the running, and we could well see a small battle up front between this colt and King of Cashel.  This should set the race up for Oasis Star and Mister Saif, who will enjoy the ground but hasn't got the progressive profile of the selection.  Expect Daryll to send Oasis Star to the front a couple of furlongs from the post and run out a comfortable victory.  Any improvement from the rest need not be a worry as the filly has been game in the past and can fight the boys off.  My only reservation would be a possible miserly quote from the bookie, but anything odds against would be worth hammering.  Recommended bet: 3 points win Oasis Star Predicted 1-2-3: 1 Oasis Star 2 Mister Saif 3 Hatch

      Today's 2.40 at Market Rasen can go to On Y Va.  He finally got it together last time out when fitted with a tongue tie, and with the same apparatus installed today is worthy of a small bet.  On form this is a four horse race, with Football Crazy, Fantastic Champion and Global Challenge making up the quartet.    The last named of these three won the first leg of a Newton Abbot maiden in a time 5 seconds slower than the selection when taking the second leg.  While improving next time at Fontwell, both times has not looked to be enjoying his racing, and although Tony McCoy is on board is easily passed over.  Football Crazy acts on Good to Firm and Good to Soft, but possibly this may be a little far for him, and couldn't be a confident choice.  The main challenge should come from in form and consistent top weight Fantastic Champion.  He will be there or thereabouts at the end, but this trip and track is plenty sharp enough, and On Y Va can make the weight difference count in the run in.  On Y Va will enjoy the ground, get the trip, and with the aforementioned tongue tie in place, we will all be breathing easily!  Recommended bet: 1 point win On Y Va Predicted 1-2-3: 1 On Y Va 2 Fantastic Champion 3 Football Crazy

      Pango is just odds against for tonight's 1m1/2f Classified Stakes at Windsor.  His best form is 8f - 9f on good to firm ground, and with all the right conditions in place tonight can chalk up a rare win.  He was unlucky when a fast finishing second in an eighteen runner handicap on his final start (his first of the season).  A repeat performance may well be enough in this lower grade.  Katiypour is another who needs fast conditions and is looking for a second successive victory.  His form has been less consistent over the years, but ignoring his penultimate run on ground too soft, has been in terrific form this year.  Of the rest, Johannian is more than capable if recapturing some of his old form, but a mile is too sharp.  Chasing the Dream only has form on an artificial surface, and Baker of Oz should be watched for the time being.  Recommended bet: 1 point win Pango Predicted 1-2-3: 1 Pango 2 Katiypour 3 Johannian

      Keiran Fallon completed an Epsom Classic double when he rode North Light to victory in the Vodaphone Derby on Saturday. As soon as the gates opened the champion jockey was showing his rivals how it should be done, taking a perfect position near the head of the pack.  He got the colt in to a nice rhythm and sat poised a couple of lengths off the pace set by Meath.  Straightening for home Fallon urged the colt into the lead, and from a couple of furlongs out he never looked like being headed.  The form of the Dante was given a further boost when Rule of Law and Let the Lion Roar confirmed placings in second and third respectively.  Both were slightly unlucky in the race, Let the Lion Roar having a lot to do in the straight and Rule of Law looking still a little immature when being asked to move in to top gear.  North Light looked to again have a little in reserve though, and a postmark rating of 124 may even be a little small.  Percussionist lost second place close home, and was the only horse to really mount a serious challenge to the winner.  He may get further.  Joint favourite Snow Ridge had to be shoved along once or twice, and although he was brought wide and looked briefly to be ready to pounce, he ultimately didn't get the trip, and connections are likely to campaign him over 8f- 10f.  North Light has been installed as the even money favourite for the Irish Derby at the Curragh, and looks the obvious choice.  He is a strong horse that should be able to take on a busy season should his trainer Sir Michael Stoute choose to provide him one.  He may get farther than 12 furlongs, but whether he is asked that particular question is doubtful.   Result: 1 North Light 2 Rule of Law 3 Let the Lion Roar

      At 3.45 today we are priviledged to see a beautiful filly line up for the Coronation stakes.  Once they talked of her spindly legs which now seem positively elegant.  They said she couldn't stay a mile, they said she couldn't do it twice, now they say she can't do it a third time.  She is Attraction - and she can.  Not only is she a special filly, but the rest of the 3yo fillies are nothing to write home about.  She stands head and shoulders above the rest.  I don't think she really does get the mile trip, I never did, but she has been my pick every time quite simply because she has too much class.  Her yard is going well, she runs an honest race, and the round mile could make her even harder to peg back.  She has the tactical speed to make sure she gets in a good early position, and she is tough as teak.  The only opponent that could improve is Red Bloom.  If the Guineas wasn't quite her running and she is as good as her connections believe then she could give her a run, remember she won over C&D last Autumn, so she is a proper filly.  My advice is to go in big on Attraction with a small saver on Red Bloom.  Before that, we have Masa in the 2.30.  The once raced-once won 2yo from Godolphin can give Frankie another winner to kick things off.  The boys in blue are flying, and this lad looked to have plenty more to offer when already impressive in his maiden, the form of which has worked out well.  John Oxx gets his string right about this time of the year, and he looks to have a very interesting runner in Barati in the King Edward VII Stakes.  Lightly raced, but seemingly improving, he can take a disappointingly weak renewal after the defection of Rule of Law and now African Dream as well.  Recommended bets: 2.30 2 points win Masa 3.05 1 point win Barati 3.45 6 points win Attraction, 0.5 points forecast Red Bloom - Attraction  Royal Ascot Selections 2.30 Masa 3.05 Barati 3.45 Attraction (Nap) 4.20 Promotion 4.55 Two Miles West 5.30 New Seeker

      What a race we are in for.  Mr Dinos bids to repeat last year's victory in the race when he cruised to a 6 length win.  He hasn't won since, but hten he is pretty much opposable in all his other races.  He needs this trip, but more importantly he relishes this trip.  He showed what good form he is in when being snatched up in the closing stages of the Sandown clash with Papineau, and with a 7 lb swing in his favour he should reverse the form.  That has been clear in my mind for some time, but there has been one niggling doubt over this selection for a while now...Vinnie Roe.  I rated the Irish challenger a massive danger at a better price, but with his withdrfawal I fail to see who can beat the favourite provided he turns up in the same form as last year.  Not that the others do not deserve their chance, Royal Rebel and Westerner are proven stayers, and Brian Boru may be some peoples idea of a dark horse.  Ingrandire comes from Japan, presumably not to visit Madame Tussauds.  But we want a winner, a 2m4f fast ground winner - Mr Dinos.  A short price I know but Hills were offering 15/8 this morning, that would be worth getting if it is still about.  Recommended bet: 4 points win Mr Dinos  Predicted 1-2-3: 1 Mr Dinos 2 Westerner 3 Royal Rebel

      Blue Dakota is the colt everyone will be clambouring to see in the Norfolk Stakes opener at 2.30.  Jeremy Noseda has brought him here unbeaten in three and all of them won with remarkable ease.  It would be absolutley no surprise to see him continue that sequence, but the price will be terribly short, and this kind of event is open to several who could improve past him.  Skywards and Cougar Cat represent Godolphin and Ballydoyle respectively, and both command attention, in particular Skywards, who improved beyond recognition on his second start to win in a fast time at Newmarket.  I am going to oppose them all with the Richard Hannon filly Spree.  He has won this race a couple of times in recent years, and Hannon jnr said they expect her to finish first or second, presumably giving respect to the favourite.  Her final start couldn't have been more impressive, and she looks a nice price for an each way punt.  The Group 2 Ribblesdale Stakes at 3.05 could turn in to a cracker of a race.  The form horse is obviously Punctilious.  Bin Suroor and Dettori reckon only the course at Epsom was against her, but she looked totally outclassed by the winner and thoroughly outstayed by the runner-up.  More progressive look to be Hidden Hope and Rave Reviews, who I expect to give a reasonable account of themselves, but in recent years this race has been throwing up a different kind of winner.  The last three winners have come off the back of maiden wins, and that profile fits two Sadler's Wells fillies in Quiff(Stoute-Fallon) and New Morning(Jarvis-Robinson).  Michael Jarvis rated this filly his best chance at this year's festival, and in the light of Rakti's performance yesterday which he must have foreseen, this girl could be a real stunner.  I could expect both these fillies to serve it up to their more experienced rivals today, but at another nice price we have got to be trusting New Morning can provide us with new wealth.  Take it each way again.  Recommended bets: 2.30 0.5 points each way Spree 3.05 1 point each way New Morning  Royal Ascot Selections 2.30 Spree (e/w) 3.05 New Morning (e/w) 3.45 Mr Dinos (Nap) 4.20 Odiham 4.55 Mutafanen

      In the next round of matches the pressure really starts to mount with anyone having lost their first game desperate to pick up all three points. Here's the sweet and lowdown on the next few fixtures:   Greece v Spain - 1pt Spain 8-11   Spain should come through here in a tournament in which they are starting to gather momentum.   Russia v Portugal - 2pts Portugal 4-7   The Ruskies are in disarray after sending Mostovoi home for bleating to the press. Portugal must surely introduce Ronaldo and Deco to bring home the Kevin.   England v Switzerland - 1pt Switzerland +1 13-8   A tougher assignment for the English than many observers believe, the Swiss qualified well from Group 10. With England short priced the neutrality boys are worth a pop with a one goal start.   Croatia v France - 1pt France 1-2   The French juggernaut looks in good shape after their turn-around against England, should be too much for the Croats.   Bulgaria v Denmark - 1pt Draw 23-10   The Bulgars were perhaps a little unfortunate to go down 5-0 to Sweden in their opening fixture and will be keen to prove they are not the tournaments whipping boys. Denmark took three draws in qualifying against comparable teams.   Italy v Sweden - 1pt Draw 21-10   The Italians are off to their traditional slow start and it would be just like them to require a victory in the last group game to progress. Sweden have talismanic striker Henrik Larrson in top form looking for a contract from Barcelona - a draw looks a likely result.   Latvia v Germany - 1pt Draw  Germany did not look impressive in drawing with the equally poor Dutch and Latvia gave what looks to be the best team in the group a real fright. Good chance of a draw in this one.   Holland v Czech Rep - 1pt Czech   The Czechs seem well positioned here, and beat the Dutch 3-1 at home in qualifying to go with a 1-1 draw in Holland. With unrest in the camp, particularly amongst the strike force, a good team performance from the Czechs should be enough to clinch it.

      The Prince of Wales Stakes heralds the start of the Summer long battle between the middle distance specialists.  The big guns have been wheeled out for this one as well, with Rakti and Sulamani heading the charge.  Now I am a self confessed Sulamani fan, and if this was over a mile and a half, I would be going in hard on the Godolphin grey...but its not.  He is always vulnerable over 10 furlongs, and in a straight contest between the two market leaders, I would be forced to side with Rakti.  His second to Nayef here last year, and more so his second to Falbrav in the Hong Kong cup when looking the only one even contemplating challenging the super colt, is form of the highest order.  He goes well fresh, has the canny Philip Robinson on board in the unlikely event of a tactical race, and this is HIS trip.  Aidan O'Brien has been quiet so far, but Powerscourt could surprise a few.  Dropped back to 1m2 1/2f on his latest start he could not have been more impressive, but the opposition that day would have been destroyed by a couple of these as well.  He can't be ruled out, but place claims are more realistic.  Another former St Leger runner who has thrived at this shorter trip is Bandari.  He has been a revelation on his last three runs at today's distance, and I fail to see where Richard Hills will find improvement on his stablemate Iktiyar to turn the tables on their latest running, but they both will need to improve to beat Rakti.  Anything outside these five winning would be a major surprise, and Rakti is a confident choice.  Expect him to pull away from Sulamani and let the comparisons to Falbrav begin.  Recommended bet: 3 points win Rakti Predicted 1-2-3: 1 Rakti 2 Bandari 3 Sulamani

      The first race on the royal card today is the Group 3 Jersey Stakes for 3yo over 7f.  Topping the bill, and in my opinion the best horse in the race, Leitrim House.  Back over the trip he was so impressive at when winning at the Curragh at the start of May, he is almost guaranteed to go well.  He does carry a group penalty however, and that could leave him vulnerable to a coule of improving sorts.  The suggestion is Fallon's mount Auditorium.  The Chevely Park colt impressed last year when notching up an easy double before narrowly failing to beat Lucky Story in the Champagne Stakes (Haafhd back in third) when he still looked green.  A satisfactory return behind Fokine at Newmarket will have brought him on, and no doubt Sir Michael Stoute will have him in perfect condition for this.  Looks a solid each way shout.  The fillies and mares event at 3.05 must surely fall to Frankie on board Crimson Palace.  The trip may be a shade on the sharp side, but this mare ran to within a length of Poalini and Right Approach in Nad Al Sheba, and that represents the best form on show by some way.  She should win.  The Royal Hunt Cup at 4.20 is a nice 32 runner Handicap over the straight mile.  Keep your money in your pocket.  If you absolutely have to bet, Victor Chandler are allowing betting on the high and low draw races, with each way bets 1/4 the odds 1-2-3.  Uhoomagoo has run out of his skin the last twice, and granted he gets the message in time (has needed rousting before picking up) could be the one.  He is due a 7 lb rise in the future.  At 4.55 we are treated to the Queen Mary.  Difficult to assess, and questionable whether there is another Attraction in the ranks.  Damson comes across from Ireland with a big reputation, but some have said she may need a little further at this level.  Keiran Fallon has elected to ride James Given's Gloved Hand, passing up Soar who looked useful enough, and that is a good enough recommendation for me.  Recommended bets: 2.30 0.5 points each way Auditorium 3.05 1 point win Crimson Palace 4.55 1 point win Gloved Hand  Royal Ascot Selections 2.30 Auditorium (e/w) 3.05 Crimson Palace 3.45 Rakti (Nap) 4.20 Uhoomagoo (e/w) 4.55 Gloved Hand

       Imploding Dutch take point against efficient Germans  An appropriate finish to the first round of matches at Euro 2004 as two teams decide to emulate perfectly their national stereotypes.   The Dutch looked like a team at odds with itself, the Little General Advocaat apparently seeking the advice of four senior players on the decision to go with the lone striker. Patrick Kluivert looked his usual sullen self (he's killed before, he'll kill again) after lambasting his teammates yesterday and Seedorf was threatening to boycott the tournament unless he got to play in his favoured central role before a hamstring injusry ruled him out of the opener.  In turn Germany were organised, made the most of any Dutch challenges and were generally uninspired - if reasonably effective, taking a deserved lead after a series of set pieces from the left. Seconds before kick-off Gary Lineker quipped,   "People say never rule out the Germans, this time I'm going to rule out the Germans."  At half time his opening gambit,  "Never rule out the Germans."  Just becuase it's a cliche doesn't mean it's not true (a cliche in itself, ooh the levels). Oh, and the draw took the reccomended first round bet into positive equity (profit).  Jack Panter  "never rule out the Germans, the Spanish are perrenial underachievers, the Dutch argue amonst themselves, England can't do penalties, the Czechs are everyones dark horses, Portugal should be there or there abouts with home advantage, Italy have a great defence, France will win if they play to their potential, Russia want to walk the ball into the net..."

      The opening race of the day can go to the Seattle Slew colt Council Member.  The Godolphin 2yo looked relatively mature when winning his debut at Newcastle at the start of the month, and that can count for alot at this meeting.  In the King Stand Stakes at 3.05 a horse I have been following this year Boogie Street would have been my selection if drawn lower, but instead I go for Cape of Good Hope, whose experience in running against the brilliant Silent Witness can tell here.  The Queen Anne at 4.20 will be a cracker as usual, and Six Perfections is the obvious choice.  She has never been out of the first two, and most of her defeats had their fair share of bad luck attached, but at such a short price, a small each way bet on Tillerman is the way to go.  He loves Ascot, goes well fresh, and this race should be run to suit.  Expect him to pick off one or two in the run to the line and finish n the frame at a nice price. Recommended bets: 2.30 1 point win Council Member 3.05 1 point win Cape of Good Hope 4.20 0.5 points each way Tillerman  Royal Ascot Selections 2.30 Council Member 3.05 Cape of Good Hope 3.45 Azamour (nap) 4.20 Tillerman (e/w) 4.55 Land N Stars 5.30 Dark Cheetah

      Royal Ascot is here again.  Championship rivalries, future stars and women in silly hats - its got it all.  The big race of the day is the Group 1 St. James' Palace Stakes over a mile, featuring three Guineas winners in Haafhd, Bachelor Duke and Brunel.    The best form on paper is held by the Newmarket winner, Haafhd.  He was impressive that day, never looking like giving up his lead in the last three furlongs to take a high class Guineas.  He loves firm ground as we saw when he set a new 2yo 7f record last year, and if on top form must be hard to beat.  There have been reports of lazy work, however, and with his short price and the poor record of Guineas winners in the race, its worth looking for value elsewhere.  Bachelor Duke improved markedly to take the Irish 2000 at the Curragh from Azamour (who didn't find as much improvement as expected) and both line up again today.  There is a suspicion that a fast run race will find him out as it did at Newmarket, a mile possibly being this colt's upper limit, but it was hard not to be taken with his burst of speed at the finish to pick off his rivals at the Curragh.  I could see the finish being again contested by these two colts if Haafhd disappoints (which he did twice last year), and the choice between them is tough.  I am going to side with John Oxx's Azamour though, in the hope that a truer race today will bring out the improvement we expected in Ireland.  Recommended bet: 2 points win Azamour Predicted 1-2-3: 1 Azamour 2 Bachelor Duke 3 Haafhd

      After one of the best football games ever between the Czech Republic and Holland last night it's hard to focus on the first of today's two matches - Russia vs. Greece. However, if you can for a second stop telling your mates that there were over 35 shots in the game and that Nedved looks like a cross between Christian Slater and Sir Patrick of Swayze (circa Point Break) you might not miss the real value bet of the tournament so far.  Fair's fair, the Russians have been unimpressive, however they have played against two of the pre-tournament favourites in Spain and Portugal, suffering a narrow defeat to the Spanish and going down two nil to the Portuguese. In contrast the Greeks sucker punched a nervy Portugal in the opener and held the Spaniards to a lucky draw. Greece's best attacking player in both fixtures was Giorgos Karagounis, who is suspended today for picking up two yellow cards.  These teams have met 18 times in the past, with Russia winning 11, Greece 3 and 4 draws. The Russians may be out, but let's not forget they hammered Cameroon 6-1 while already eliminated from the 1994 World Cup.   Recommended Bet: 1pt Russia 4-1, you know it makes sense.

      Just 17 days after he did us a favour in the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot, Rakti bids to follow up in today's Coral Eclipse at Sandown.  He looks set for a big season, and is without a doubt the one they all have to beat.  The manner in which he pulled away from the pack at Ascot with a terrifying burst of speed (after playing up at the start and pulling hard early on) proved the undoubted class he posesses.  For me he is still going to be the middle distance horse for this season.  However, at a best priced 11/8, is he worth our hard earned pennies?  Favourites and winners of the Prince of Wales's Stakes have a dismal record in this race, and much has been made of 'the bounce factor' and the softer going.  I don't see any evidence to prove that he will not be fresh and ready for this, but the ground is good to soft, and that will severly inconvenience him.  He may well still win, but he is too short a price to have so many ifs and buts about him.  So who wins it?  Refuse to Bend came back well at Ascot, reminding us of his Classic credentials, but soft going over 10 furlongs? I think not.  Salford City remains unexposed.  He simply didn't stay in the Derby after moving well, and perhaps wasn't quite ready for the Guineas when it came about, and in any case certainly wasn't disgraced.  This could be his trip, and I wouldn't advise against an each-way wager.  The bet though has to be Powerscourt.  An impressive winner in Ireland in a weaker race, he then ran second to Rakti at Ascot, soundly beaten in fairness, but he kept on well and still had plenty of top class horses in behind.  Aidan O'Brien has won this race twice in the last four years, and this may be his star for this year.  The cut in the ground will not be a problem being a son of Sadler's Wells, and he looks really solid for an each way bet.  Ikhtiyar, third at Ascot, warrants respect also, showing a liking for this track in the past, but I still feel he is that bit short of top class.  He has place claims.  Recommended bet: 1.5 points each way Powerscourt Predicted 1-2-3: 1 Powerscourt 2 Rakti 3 Salford City
