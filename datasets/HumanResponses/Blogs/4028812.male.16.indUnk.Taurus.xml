it your desire can it all stab and destroy you before itbecomes you was this wish meant for you are you already dead now cant find itordinary constructed by the psychological sickness infested within you cant fitthe answer with the question leads to another question how can you believe init when you try but will end up become insane secertly sick and reinvested inwhat seemed so practical but ended up edgestratically insane oh where is thereal feelings that hide within you cant get up and say whats for today cause itmay end up another way like yesterday such more of this and i wonder how long istand up to this same old thing that haunts me i feel as it infests and delaysmy mind all for once again such a wasted chance of memorys expanded to displaymore vulgar past of unattended ways of life can be cruel when it comes up toyou can you feel all this the way you betray your own life lieing to yourselfcause of the past make it last and try and figure the expansion to your desireyou left on compiling everything i believed flew away like crows and controlthe hate that lurks deep inside but the stress and pain that i felt inside ofme what is there to say without writing down all this time but it will fade atanytime but can i make a change in a life i never got to see will it all run tothis pointless empty space in time or will it be accepted inside this time willi die or become and try to see whats left of me fight back and win what i neverknew i had feel the feelings that always hide in my mind when it will show tobecome whats left of me cant it all just become what i needed to be nothing toshow up for me whats been erased from me take a chance to look on whats downthe lines can i give you something that you never really cared about but is itthe feelings that make you feel pointless inside or are you really nothing inthere we been massacared for so long such a perfect insulated suicide left inmy tv but is this what i thought of all this time like the morning fog thatleaks through my window such a secert powerful lie when the crys of the suntake all the sound out of me can you see the mary that lurks in your mirror itappears that it maybe a mystery cause the key of unlocking it what can lifetake away what i want but sometimes you find away out sometimes you can fightit off to find the way of life meant for you cause nothing is really good tillyou use your final days when your not truely alone to this pressure that welive eachday the death is a hidden thing but will they ever accept it is thiswhat you really reap cause it all seems to be unfair blame it all on the liesand all this things that have been said everytime i have to believe in the hatethat i will always find why do they always blame cause finally my knife willtake its toll when will it be sorry i dont know when maybe when you will acceptthe fact that i will never be sorry for what you deserved but the angels couldfind the answer to the answers why these things happen will god be happy or isalready the suffering cause if i died tomorrow noone really would remember ofme nothing will change for this way of life nothing will become of this lifebut emptiness filled with sorrow cannot follow if you die infront of them theywill never remember your name or still think of your name like a forgotten songthey sing they light a candle like its made for another empty night but is thattruely true cause they killed our friends but will you just be like them andfight it and become and betray everything thats meant for you will you everfind the truth cause its just there to be used like a tool you find the answershidden inside the lies that are spoken what you will find out you will know theanswers to take and create them to a solution can you feel it as it soils yourmind the thing that follows will choose to reach out to you cause it finds youand destroys you will you beg for the same thing and find away out of this wayis it all just one big puzzle unsolved and misplaced pieces to find or recreatecan you remember everything this time the pain that sliced the seeds and theyplanted one inside your mind it grew and changed you like a bush of wrestledflowers cant make everything ok it has been taken away all has been lost cantfind the true thoughts of life it is hidden like the seeds planted erased away
