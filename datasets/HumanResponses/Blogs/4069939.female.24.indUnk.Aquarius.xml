						   I looked into getting a new car. It's not going to happen. They want "thousands" down to cover the negative equity in the car. We'll just have to wait until tax time like we had planned. Kind of a bummer. They just raised our insurance 52 dollars a month. That sucks, but its just one more thing. I just love that it is right after we move when we are getting screwed with set up fees and back balances and so much other crap. I so HOPE that Don gets his raise in September. We need it. Everytime we start to get ahead, it seems like we get smacked back down. It's rather exhausting. We also need to go and purchase yet another new car seat for D. She is growing soooo fast. They both are. I love my kids. I want better for them. I know we will get through this rough patch, we always do, just wish we didn't have to keep "getting through" things. We are drving up to Snowflake tomorrow. Should be interesting. Don has to go get a bid on a job and wants us to tag along. It's going to be a long and not so fun day. I don't imagine the kids are going to take to well to 5 hours in the car. But it's important to Don, so I guess we'll have to give it a go. I am so sick of these hours he is working, and all for nothing. Oh well. Enough bitchin from me for now.

						   Going non stop all day, typical stuff.  Today I had a Creative Memories consultant come over and teach me how to do some scrapbooking stuff.  Of course it was a sales pitch, but I didn't buy anything. I have an album for each of the kids already and several supplies that I need to use up first before I purchase anything else.  Still, I am a scrapbooking mood now. Just waiting for everyone to go to bed so that I can play. T has been loving on his sister all day.  He is having a super affectionate day.  Not big on eating or napping today.  I have a feeling that we are going to be having some sleep issues again very soon.  D is in her jumper.  She LOVES that thing. She also took a 2 hour nap today all by herself.  This was a major milestone. Hopefully it continues.  Off to take D to the grocery store.

						   I spend way too much time on the computer, so hopefully I can use this to do something beneficial, like the journaling I should be doing for my kids. Also, a place to put my meandering thoughts.  My name is Karli, I am a 24 year old stay at home mom. I am married to Don (27) and mother to T (1.5 years) and D (5 months). To try to catch up on all I have missed in the last year and half would only put me further behind, so, from here on, I will just jump in and see if I can remember to do this on a semi regular basis.

						   As always, things are hectic.  Don and I are still a bit rocky but seeking outside help very shorty.  If we could get one area of life handled maybe it all wouldn't be so overwhelming.  The job thing is going to happen one way or another pretty quick here.  Anyhow. T is such a little boy, no longer my baby.  He is doing this whole refusing to sleep in bed thing.  He naps on the floor in front of his bedroom door.  At night, he starts out there and then when he is almost out I go in and help him get back into bed.  Last night, I lost him, I knew he was in there, but could not find him.  As it turned out, he had climbed all the way in the back, underneath the crib to sleep.  Weird child.  Not that I should be shocked, this kid is always under the table.  He's going to be all about forts.  He is also a major climber (nevre should have taken him to Jungle Jim's).  He is climbing into the baby swing, up and into the high chair, through the exersaucer.  Aye... And today, my little man locked me out.  I went outside for a brief moment and he hit the deadbolt on me, I had to run upstairs to use the phone to call the office to get them to let me in.  He is going to give me an anurisim. D is still rolling.  She likes to push herself all the way up on her arms and move herself backwards (rather be going forward).  She get's so frustrated about it.  She is a total paper eater (just like her brother).  She is getting to the point where she wants to start putting herself to sleep but isn't quite there.  So I am just kinda following her cues. I have assignments due starting Tuesday.  Spanish 202 is going to kill me.  I have to get organized.  I am trying so hard to get the house organzied and clean so school will be easier. HA! I should just give up and start doing my homework.  Having a clean house will never happen unless the 3 of them move out.

						   On Sunday we had a bit of an adventure.  We were getting ready to go to Jungle Jim's.  I noticed T's hand was bleeding.  It looked like he had something sticking out of his finger. I screamed for Don and told him to just get it out.  It turns out it was skin, a wart or a skin tag.  It wouldn't stop bleeding, we were close to going to the ER to get it cauterized.  Finally it stopped and we headed out.  I climbed all through the tunnels and play areas with T as did Don.  My knees were so sore.  T has no fear. That kit has never been in one of those and was still just on his way, maneuvering through the tunnels and ropes and climb like they were nothing.  We got a wrist badn for rides and I figured he would go on a few but no, he did them ALL. They had a jeep track that he just loved.  Then we went on the Monkey Barrels (kind of like and enclosed tea cups) he loved it.  So i figured what the heck, we went on the roller coaster (it just goes fast ina circle with a few hills- forward and back) again, he Loved it.  Last one was the rockets (like Dumbo) well, we ended up in one that went up and stayed up, no way to get it back down, he was fine, I was sick for 2 hours after.  I am getting too old for this, I don't know how I am going to manage Disneyland.  He had so much fun.  Don and I had a blas watching him.  I loved watching him figure everything out as he was going through the tunnels, he is so smart. Today I had to go pick up my books.  What a pain and what a fortune.  It's insane.  I still can't believe I go back to school next week, I am actually nervous. I had the seat part out of the exersaucer today, so T climbed under it and stood up in there and was jumping around and being goofy and D was hysterical, she thought he was just hilarious.  The more she laughed the more he did, they played off each other so well.  I love it.  I love them.  I cleaned my room today, still an accomplishment at 24.  I wanted to have a sort of reasonable work space for school.  It looks good and it's so much more relaxing.  I am sure Don and T will have remedied that before the end of tomorrow.  Well, off to change the litter box and take a shower and go to bed.  I am so tired lately.  Too much stress.

						   Well, today (yesterday) was my anniversary, 3 years from the day we met.  Don left for work at 6:30 am and got home at 8:45pm.  Then he left again at 9:45 to go get his sister and got home at 10:15.  I being the good little wife grinned and bared it.  I hope this is all worth it.  I am so lonely and miserable.  My heart can only take so much more.  T is acting out bc of how infrequently he gets to see his dad.  He has had to go to bed before Don got home more times than not this past week.  Poor kid, his world is just upside down. He did such a great job helping me clean up tonight.  He also comforted his sister when she was upset.  He had her cracking up.  D is still rolling everywhere.  She fell asllep in her swing tonight, first time ever.  I have the 2 best kids in the world.  They are my everything.  If it weren't for them I honestly don't think I would be here right now.  I start school a week from Monday.  I have to take the kids to school wiht me on Monday to get my books.  I sooo hope Don will be home in time for Thursday night class.  I can not afford to miss even 1.  I really hope things get better here.  I hate working so hard only to get criticized at every turn.  I am tired and I am so lonely.  I know I have said that a lot but I am not used to this.  I have never felt this way.  I am married, I shouldn't be lonely.  Oh well, just gotta hang in there and focus on the positive.  I just wish there was more to focus on.

						   Today is our 3 year anniversary from the day we met.  Don left at 6:30 this monring and got home at 8:45 tonight and at 9:45, left again to go get his sister.  She lives with 2 guys and has a million friends that she is constantly out with, but apparently Don was the only one who could go and get her.  Oh well.  Happy Anniversary to me.  I am trying to sooo hard to be the supportive wife.  I am keeping my mouth closed as much as possible about these hours and how often he is gone.  I am going to explode soon.  Especially when I can't gte my school work done.  I just hope and pray that it's all worth it.  I really do.  I want this all to work out so much and I am seriously putting everything I have into it and I am hurting sooo much.  If it all works out it will be worth it though. T is acting out because of all the hours Don is working.  He has gone to bed before Don has gotten home more times than not this week.  He did do an awesome job helping me clean up tonight.  HE picked up all his toys and put them in his toybox.  When his sister started crying he ran to comfort her and had her cracking up. D is rolling everywhere, I can't keep up with her.  She fell asleep in her swing tonight, first time ever. T used to do it all the time.  She is so darn cute.  I absolutely LOVE my children.  They are my everything, I wouldn't be here if it weren't for them. I start school a week from Monday.  I have to drag the kids down to school on Monday to get my book and I need to clean the computer and get my work area all ready.  This should be interesting.  I just hope and pray Don makes it home for my class on Thursday nights.  I have no idea how I am going to pass Spanish.  I haven't taken it in 6 years.  Oh well, I just need a C. Well, kids are slepeing for the moment, so I guess that means time to go do my chores.

						   I was getting antsy.  These long hours Don is working are taking thier toll. SO I put the kids in the car and took them for a drive.  We ended up visting Don quickly at a job site.  T saw his dad and was thrilled until 2 minutes later when we had to leave. T was hysterical.  Cried the entire way home, nothing would comfort him.  Don has only seen T about 40 mins total since Sunday morning.  I am so totally heartbroken.  These kids are my world and I hate to see them like this.  This isn't the family plan we had layed out.  I am going to keep bting my tongue until Sept.  We'll see.  D is rolling around like a mad woman lately.  I leave the room for two minutes and when I come back, she is never where I left her.  She is all about plaving in the venetian blinds.  She will roll across the entire room to get to them.  She is so determined.  Still very easily frustrated. T demonstrated his signing abilities for his dad tonight.  He has signs for yummy and hungry and night night.  There his own signs he made up and they work.  He is such a little genius.  I am so blessed to have these two amazing little people in my life and not a moment goes by that I don't remember that.  Everything I want in life is for them.

						   Physically, mentally, and emotionally, I am just beat down. I am so exhausted and so overwhelmingly sad and lonely. My husband left at 5:30 this morning and at 9, still no sign of him. The classes I wanted were all full. Nothing is coming together and dragging the kids everywhere is soooo hard. I want to cry, I wish I could, I would feel so much better to have some sort of release. I have $18 in my checking account.  Lots of money seems to get spent when Don and I are fighting.  Oh well, nothing can be done about it at this point.   On a positive note I guess, I am registered for 13 credit hours, crappy classes, but classes none the less.  My kids are amazingly wonderful and all things considered they were so very well behaved while I dragged them around registering today.  Once my financial aid is settled and I go get my books (another outing with the kids) I will be happy.  I wish I had a sitter to watch the kids so I could take more classes on campus, just so I can be around adults.  I know my kids love me, but I so desperatly need someone to take care of me for a little while.  I wish I could cry.   Oh well, I must go tend to my kids and clean my house and make lunch for my husband and get laundry done and.....

						   Things have been crappy. Don and I have been having marital technical difficulties.  It all seems to be worked out for now though.  My grandmother got out of the hopsital last night. SO that's good news.  D cut tooth number 2 last night also.  I ventured out and took the kids to the mall today.  They seemed to have fun and it got us all out of the house.  T is apparently no longer taking naps. I am still putting him down for quiet time though.  Well, off to do chores.

						   I forgot to mention last night, that when we got home from the grocery store, T helped. I was putting groceries in the fridge and Don was putting away stuff in the pantry. T got the groceries out of the bags and brought them to Don to put away. He was so proud of himself when we were "all done". He is growing up too fast. D slept through the night! Little miracales. She slept in her own bed for 8 hours. Both Don and I were terrified when we realized she was still in her own bed, repeatedly making sure she was breathing. Hopefully it's a trend and not a one time thing. Don got screwed over at work, yet again. So he will be there all day it looks like and at some point I need to go to the hospital. One more month to find out if all this crap at his job is going to be worth it.

						   T was having a needy day. That's ok though. I can't even begin to complain about not getting housework done when instead I got to play with my son. We colored on the arcadia door and danced around. Fridays are always a busy day for us, lots of errands and bill paying and its our weekly grocery shopping night. We stocked up tonight, lots of new recipes to try this week. Don has to work in the morning, so I don't know when I will be heading to the hospital, just know that I will be. I am tired and need to jump in the shower before I head off to bed. Just trying to keep the habit of writing every day.

						   My grandmother (bio) went to the ER on Tuesday, on Wednesday they went to put a stint in her artery and it collapsed. They flew her down her for a quadruple bypass. It's been hectic to say the least. I was down there yesterday and today. She seems to be doing great now. Don has been a big help, staying with the kids while I trek down there and coming home early from work. My bio mom was supposed to be coming down, but isn't. I am kinda relieved. Too much going on right now as it is. On Tuesday my mom's mil died, so that's putting strain on them to say the least. When it rains it pours. At least I have an excuse for not writing. I so desperately need to catch up on housework and time with my kids. I am not going to go to the hospital tomorrow (tonight). I have too much to do here and Fridays are big family errand day, sooo... I will be back down there on Saturday. D is starting to stir, so I best say good night.

						   We wasted an entire weekend fighting. I hate that. We'll see how the week goes. We really got NOTHING accomplished. I have a ton of housework and laundry to do. We did watch movies though, we watched Miracle, Butterfly Effect, Duplex, and Don watched Hellboy. D is try so desperatly to crawl now. I love her scooting and rolling. She just gets so frustrated. T is in rare form today, so I better go and see what he is tearing apart.
