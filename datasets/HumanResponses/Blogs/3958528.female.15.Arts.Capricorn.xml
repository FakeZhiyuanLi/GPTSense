          Ok yeah im feeling(in case you couldnt tell) lonely at the moment... I really am.. I mean its a Friday night and I should be out having fun... But im not... and its not cuz im like a loser or nothin but I just feel like something is missing.. Ever felt like that? Like Im usually pretty independant and I can get along just fine by my self.. But now I feel vulnerable like a child... I feel like I need someone to hold me.. But being who I am of COURSE there is no one to do that..... I just need some cheering up thats all..

          Ok... I dont know what made me think of this but have you ever had a weird experince..?? Like have you ever seen or heard something that just made you go hmmm....ok... Well I have had plenty of those in my life but only one REALLY affected me....    I loved the snow... I always had... And one night I  prayed that it would snow it was a Saturday night so it wasnt to get out of school I just loved waking up and seeing the white glistening snow everywhere... Well the next morning... It snowed and Im talking for Kennett it was like a Blizzard.. Now obviously this was some time ago i think i was around 11... so anyways that day I was just so happy it snowed but my mom wouldnt let me go out in it because it was so bad..yeah I was mad at her for that anyways... so I was walking past my window in my dining room and something appeared out of the corner of my eye.. So naturally I turned to look and there was a man in the middle of the street...it was snowing like crazy and there was this man walking down the street in a white suit and he had a white bible in his hand.. now if you think this is unbelievable you havent heard this next part... when i turned around to tell my mom about the man in the street he dissapeared... SERIOUSLY... he was no where to be found.... my sister saw him to and he didnt scare me when i saw him he had a caring look to him that made you calm... so anyways I never forgot that man or his face...  and I know it sounds weird and stuff but that is a moment im glad to have experienced.... well thats all for now... later

          Well this week all I did pretty much was shop... Me and Shannon shopped for 4 hours at Battelfield and then not even thirty minutes later we went with my mom to Branson shopping... And so back to my story...... I was walking through the mall and I had already spent most of my money and I was going to just go grab something to eat and I saw this stand with all these Christian shirts... and I was just gonna ya know.. Look around at them...I didnt plan on getting one because I was almost broke but I saw this one in a box.. It had just got in.. and it said this...   Break Away    From the Crowd                "Seperate yourselves from them, don't tough their filthy things, and I will welcome you and be a father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters."       2 Cor 6:17-18       Im not sure why but I absolutley loved it so I bummed 15 dollars off of Shanni and got it...    At first I was only getting that shirt because it was a way of Showing my faith to people and it was really cute... But that little scripture has taken on a new meaning for me... Its funny how something as simple as a tshirt can change the way you look at things:)

          haha... There is only one word that describes my moods sometimes... MOUNTAINS... haha.. I mean one minute I can be the happiest person on the planet it seems like....Ya know REALLY hyper... and the next Im like feeling sad for no reason... and then Im mad....haha thats how it hits me when something happens... Say for instance a guy leads me on... First Im happy because I think he likes me... Then when i find out he doesnt im sad for a while... Then i am TICKED OFF... hahaha... And usually the sad part only lasts for i little while thirty minutes at the most unless it was someone REALLY important to me... One day I cried for almost 6 hours straight... because of a guy... everyone saw me cry and I didnt care... it took me a long time to over come it... and only my CLOSE friends knew how tore up I was... and if that happens to me again I dont know what Im going to do with myself... I mean if it happened right now... theres no telling how long Id cry... I hate how I open up my heart to someone who barley opens up theres to me... and then it takes FOREVER to close it after they are gone..... Do you think its possible for you heart to actually hurt when its not like a HEALTH problem? I do... Because I have felt that horrible pain... Its not pretty... great.... now im sad...anyone out there who can cheer me up? doubt it... oh well...

        Just when I thought my life was coming to&nbsp;a point where I didnt care I STARTED CARING and then I quit caring again... Its amazing how crazy and paranoid I can be sometimes... I mean I get SOOO worried over things... Like im scared of EVERYTHING.... I always want someone to be with but I cant imagine ANY guy wanting to waste their time with me.. I mean for goodness sake I am scared OF THE DARK!! haha... I go to bed EVERY single night with my TV on SLEEP timer or I just leave it on depending on how scared im feeling lol... Im scared to death of flying.... Like if anyone ever forced me onto a plane I would have a HEART ATTACK...haha.. and Im scared of most hights except for I love Roller Coasters... I dunno I just get such a rush.. Im like the only person not screaming because Im cracking up the whole time... weird huh? I dunno but yeah back to my point... I have always liked guys and then didnt like them and then liked them and ... well you get the point... and I am was always waiting for another one to come around and when one didnt I went after them...and there were times when I felt like giving up on love....  there were times that I felt like no one would ever want to love me but something and I dont recall what... Changed the way I looked at things... and here is something that I really cherish and I want to share it with those who havent seen it before... and even those who have but just forgotten it.............   "Love is patient, Love is kind. It does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self seeking, it is not easily angered, and it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, it always trusts, and always preserves. Love NEVER fails."   1 Corinthians&nbsp; 13:4-8  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       Can I ask ANYONE and EVERYONE out there who is reading this..... if there IS anyone... How do you tell a person how you feel about them? Im asking this for a friend of mine....NO NAMES but.. She REALLY likes this guy... and she feels something toward him that she has NEVER felt towards a guy before... She has a feelin he likes her... and he knows that she kinda likes him... but he doesnt know ALL of her feelings toward him.... should she tell him how she really feels because she will feel WAY better if she does but what if he doesnt feel ANYWHERE near as much towards her?? What does she do if she finds this out AFTER she has told him EVERYTHING that he doesnt like her that much... Or isnt ready to commit and be in a relationship.... OR is ready to be in a relationship just not a serious one.... WHAT IS SHE SUPPOSE TO DO IN THAT SITUATION?? How will she be able to handle the fact that a guy she really likes who is SO sweet to her and shes never met anyone like him doesnt like her back? I know it will break her heart in hundreds of pieces..... I know how she feels IVE been in HER shoes....and its not pretty.... So please ANYONE give me a comment I really could use the advice and so could she;) THANKS!

       Im in a little bit better mood since the last post... I dont really know what was wrong with me.... I guess I&nbsp; just miss alot of things...&nbsp;But lets not get into all of tha...haha... But yeah I did release some tension by goin swimmin' and listenin to my Big And Rich CD... I dunno there is somethin about my pool that when I get into and I swim I feel so exhilerated... haha WEIRD I know but ya know... Its me and Ive spent all my life trying to hide who&nbsp;I really was... When I was around certain people*cough* guys *cough* lol.. I would totally not be myself I would act like I thought they wanted me to act, I would try to figure out what they were and pretend like I have all the same values and stuff but up until recently I have figured out that I DONT CARE! I really dont care what a guy thinks of me ... and so WHAT if we dont have the same opinions on things... you ever heard the saying "Opposites Attract"

        Well this is the FIRST time I have been on the computer ALL day long! Thats amazing! I mean really I usually get on the computer 5-6 times a day and today I have a feeling it will only be 4 times...haha... Im not as hyper as I was last night! ... and Im no where near as happy as I was last night... I have a feeling these next few days will be LONGER than any days I have experienced in my life... I cant really explain why I just have this abnormal feeling that things wont exactly be happy go lucky for me.... Im not exactly sad.... Or mad... I just feel REALLY lonely for some reason I feel like I need someone to talk to... ok I KNOW I need someone to talk to but... I mean I have always let a little of my feelings show but I have always been to scared to show them all... I mean I am just so scared to say some of the things I really want to say because im afraid If I do... The person I tell will take off running because they dont feel the same way or im afraid i will be laughed at... I dunno maybe I can tell someone....

        Hey yall! Im not as hyper anymore but Im still really happy... And I dont have a CLUE why... But its good though dont get me wrong I like bein happy even if i dont know the real reason for it.....You ever feel like that? Your just so happy and you feel like nothing can bring you down and there is no apparant cause for it? Well anywho... I need some sleep because I barley got any sleep last night and I need to clean my room and I gotta do this and i gotta do that... and Im so unbelievably bored.... but oh well.. Night Yall! Oh yeah.... There is a flame that is calling my name... And even though there is a possibility of it burning me I cant stay away.... What do i do if I am engulfed in the flame? How will I ever get out?

       haha... Can you believe it!! Not even 10 minutes later IM BACK AGAIN to fill you with useless information about anything and everything RANDOM or not goin on in my life!! Well im still hyper as heck and happy! I dont know what made me do it but suddenly im so LOOSE!!&nbsp; I mean im very open minded right now I think thats probably why Im writing so much because its just pouring out of me..... whether or not it acutally makes since... right now I feel like my life might actually have SOME meaning to it!! Im not quite sure what it is&nbsp;but... I WILL FIGURE IT OUT!! I have also learned that being mad at people and holding grudges against people is just SILLY... Learn to forgive but not forget..... this is my philosophy because well I have had people mad at me in the past and i have been mad at people and when someone is mad at me I want them to forgive me right away but how can I possibly expect them to do that when I dont even return the favor to everyone else? lol... that was insightful BACK TO BEING CRAZY!!! IM BORED WITH NOTHING TO DO I NEED SOMETHING TO DO!! WHAT DO I DO!?!?!?!

SERIOUSLY they would I mean Im listening to "Save A Horse Ride A Cowboy" OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER!!!! And its just making me crazier but If i turn it off its like all the power shuts off in my brain and I feel REALLY weird So ON it goes again! haha.... Does anyone know a good mental institution... like the one in FARMINGTON! haha... Naaa im not REALLY mentally disturbed Im just happy!!! And I have no reason to be....

        Well im back...yay... and I dont like it much...haha... I mean I just got done watching Kate &amp; Leopold...cuz it was on TV... and yeah I ABSOLUTLEY LOVE THAT MOVIE! But for like an hour   after I watch the movie I always feel so happy because I felt like I was IN th movie..Crazy Huh? I mean but like after I snap back into reality I realize well holy freakin crap I wasnt there... There was no awesomely romantic guy being sweet to me for the past two hours or whatever.. IT WAS FAKE... Thats why I have come to dislike romantic movies...haha... Because no matter how happy you are while your watching the movie you still go back to being yourself and having to face the fact that, THAT didnt happen to&nbsp; you.... I dont think that will EVER happen to me... I mean yeah I have had boyfriends but they were just that&nbsp; BOY friends.... None of them were ever mature enough to be like that! haha.. But do ya get what Im saying ? Here is what I want in a guy: As far as looks go.... As long as hes taller than me and has two eyes , two ears, a nose, and a mouth(with all the stuff inside it lol) Im happy in that department......And I would atleast like him to be sweet to me!! I mean is that TOOO much to ask for?haha...Maybe it is because I havent had a guy be like that to me YET.... and he has to have a soft side... I CANT STAND guys who are all TOUGH and junk ALL THE TIME..... I mean yeah I dont want a sissy boy who cant protect me but I do want a guy who isnt afraid to tell me how he feels about me and isnt afraid to show it IN PUBLIC... ever heard of PDA's? yeah i like those.... haha... Now I probably sound really picky and stuff but im REALLY not... Im really loose about guys... in general.... I know this WHOLE blog is raving on and on about guys and how I wish theyd be... But maybe there is a guy somewhere who will treat me right and who isnt afraid of commitment... heck knowing me he could be right in front of me and I wouldnt know the difference.... But back to the subject of how you feel after you watch a movie like that am I the ONLY one who feels like that? haha Probably.... Please Give Comments!

       Ok... It has been FOREVER since I have posted... lol... I havent really been busy.. I just got out of the groove.. But im back... And im still happy! And I got a cell phone.. Which is SEMI exciting... and school starts back August Nineteenth which REALLY sucks.... lol... and tennis practice starts the 16th:( But im making Breah do Tennis with me this year so its all good:) Except for the running.... anywho I wrote a new poem.. I dont have it with me now so ill have to post it later:) check back! Let me just end with this little insight of mine......    My view on something:   It hurts me when people turn to me and say "If your GOD is so wonderful then why does he let bad things happen?"    Well in my view of things.. God doesnt just LET stuff happen... I mean this is ONLY MY opinion so Im not meaning to offend anyone... But I dont think God can interfere with us.... I mean atleast he wont.. Its like when he created the heavens and the earth he made it a goal to make something and let it grow by its self....ya know? I think he put man on this earth to make his own way...Everything we do now is what we choose to do...We have chosen the path of our lives from the very beginning... We chose to invent the automobile: therefore AUTOMOBLE ACCIDENTS are caused by us... Not God.... and I could go on and on about how we are involved with why things happen more than we know but that would just take too long...lol... And thats exactly a problem now days... People dont realize how much we affect our lives ... and how there isnt much God can do to stop the way we are... BUT because he cant act on it himself he acts on it through people on this earth.. ever heard of NOAH? and his ARC? Yeah that guy... Do you remember why he built the boat and saved all the species and his family? Well its simply because things were going so badly and sin was so abundant that God had to end it some how... and since he cant affect FREE WILL... he sent Noah to do it for him:) Yes that right FREE WILL.... or a personal gain of sorts.... I could ramble on about this for days... But this is all for now... Please if you find i am incorrect about something... PLEASE tell me:) Ill be waiting......

Then.. about 30 minutes later Stephen called( Earlier before I went and played by myself I tried to call him to go play but he wasnt home) so anyways he asked me if I still wanted to go so at about 9:00 we went and played and I actually played fairly decent:) and I got home at about 10:50... the only bad thing were them darn skeeters man.. they were all over me like white on rice haha..
