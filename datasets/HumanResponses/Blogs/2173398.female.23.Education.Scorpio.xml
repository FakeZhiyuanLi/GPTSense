       Link to story    BENSALEM, Pa. - In the heady aftermath of the Kentucky Derby, hours after guiding Smarty Jones to the winner's circle, Stewart Elliott spotted an acquaintance at a party.  Weaving his way through well-wishers, Elliott grasped Ralph Riviezzo's hand and shook it. The trainer began congratulating him on a brilliant ride, but Elliott changed the subject:  "I just wanted to thank you," the 39-year-old jockey told the longtime Philadelphia Park trainer.  For what? Riviezzo asked.  Nearly 20 years ago, Riviezzo slipped Elliott a $100 tip after the rider brought home one of his horses. Elliott never forgot.  "I couldn't believe it," Riviezzo recalled last week at Philly Park. "He's just won the Kentucky Derby, and he says to me: 'I was going through a little bit of a bad time, things were going slow, and I won a race for you. You handed me a hundred and told me to take out my girlfriend. That was real nice of you.'"  That, says Riviezzo, is all you need to know about Elliott: "A class act all the way. What a mind-set."  Ask people about Elliott, and the same words keep coming up repeatedly: dedicated, loyal, modest, reserved. And, of course, talented.  "This is what I do, I ride horses," Elliott said last week at a favorite restaurant near his home in Washington Crossing, Pa. "I work hard at it. It's all I know. I gave up my education for this. I've been through a lot, but I've been very fortunate."  The ultimate journeyman jockey, Elliott is now part of this season's most riveting racing story.  Smarty Jones is the first undefeated Derby winner since 1977 Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew, and with Elliott and trainer John Servis along for the ride of their lives, the speedy chestnut colt looks to be in top form for Saturday's Preakness Stakes.  Should Smarty party home first in the second leg of the Triple Crown, it would set the stage for the sixth Triple try in eight years at the Belmont Stakes on June 5. The last Triple Crown winner was Affirmed in 1978.

          WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Uceba Babson used to trudge through flooded plains for more than a mile to reach her one-room schoolhouse, her lunch pail full of syrup-covered biscuits.  That was before buses and roads came to rural Pahokee, and the swampy land made getting to school an adventure. But in 1931, Babson gave up her daily commute through Florida swamps to marry a vegetable farmer.  She now has 81 grandchildren and great-grandchildren to hear her schoolgirl tales, but the end of the story always troubled her. So after outliving three husbands and letting seven decades pass since her last high school class, Babson decided it was time to go back to school.   After two years of heard work — never missing a day of class — she took part in a graduation ceremony Tuesday night, a few months after her 90th birthday. She received a rousing standing ovation, a bouquet of red roses and a congratulatory letter from Gov. Jeb Bush.   Babson — born before World War I broke out, before Charles Lindbergh flew across the Atlantic Ocean, before women won the right to vote — now has new stories of getting to school.   "I studied and studied, and then I learned I actually passed," Babson said. "A lot of it was memorizing. You had to remember the rules and at 90, it's hard."   She tells of days that begin at 4 a.m. with a hot shower and water bottles to get her knees working. She drove herself in a 1997 Mercury on roads that didn't exist in her childhood.   Inspired by a book about a man who was in his 90s when he started high school, Babson dove into her math, English, science and social studies courses.   "I thought, 'If he can do it, there's no reason why I shouldn't,'" Babson said. "It gave me a purpose and I said, 'If it takes me five years, I'm going to do it.'"   She spent many hours a day studying, learning in social studies about the wars that she had lived through and in science about the photosynthesis that helped her family's cornstalks grow.   "I couldn't even pick up a magazine because I felt guilty because I thought I should pick up my books for school," Babson said.   On her first day at the Adult Education Center, her classroom was nearly unrecognizable from the one-room schoolhouse in Pahokee she had left behind. The desks had computers and the seats were filled with people from Jamaica, Haiti and Latin America.   "We all just blended together. It was wonderful," Babson said.   The center helps students as young as 16 study for their high school equivalency diploma and helps others take exams and brush up on their English or writing skills.   For Babson, whose quick gait and proud posture make her appear decades younger than she is, putting on her blue cap and gown and picking up her diploma is the culmination of a dream.   "This is something I promised myself a long time ago," Babson said. "It's been a challenge, but a wonderful challenge."

       urlLink Link to story    Blue Springs Police Sgt. Mike Kruger says there are a few good people left. 'There are more honest people out there,' Kruger said. 'Sometimes we are pessimistic.' Krueger's faith was renewed about 10 a.m. yesterday when a Blue Springs man, about 37, turned in a bagful of money to the Blue Springs Police Department. The man asked to police not to release his name. 'He just wanted to do the right thing,' Kruger said. 'That's was just they way he wanted to handle it.' The bag, which Kruger said contained about $200,000, fell out of a PSI armored truck around 7:30 a.m. Tuesday on Interstate 70. Police counted the money and returned it to PSI. 'It's unusual,' Kruger said. 'It's not something that happens every day. I think that this was an honest person.'

       This morning, a forlorn graduate student at Brown posted to the grad students listserv that her cat was stuck in a stree and had been there for about five days. Apparently, the fire and police departments claimed they didn't have the right equipment or couldn't perform such a rescue. So, grad students to the rescue, folks posted with numerous suggestions of other people and places to call. One student even volunteered to climb the tree himself. I'll update as soon as I know more ... but I imagine this cat will be out of the tree by dinnertime.    Update : Cat has been rescued; no ropes, daredevil students or trampolines (all suggested solutions) were needed. A local tree service volunteered to help out.

        COLLEGE STATION, Texas -- Wouldn't be prudent. So, former President George Bush canceled his solo parachute jump Sunday because of risky winds and instead leaped from 13,000 feet in tandem with a member of the U.S. Army parachute team.   The result was just as exhilarating, said Bush, who landed and slid a ways on his rear as he came to rest near his presidential library.   "This was a day of joy and a day of wonder for the Bush family, certainly for the old guy," said Bush, who made the jump to celebrate his 80th birthday.   About 4,000 people watched from the ground, including Bush's wife Barbara, his son Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.   The solo jump was canceled because of winds and cloud cover. Bush took a practice jump in tandem with Army parachutists earlier Sunday before the crowd gathered.   He said he would like to try a solo jump again but gave no timetable other than "soon." Bush was a Navy pilot in World War II. He parachuted to safety when his plane was shot down. He also leaped out of a plane to celebrate his 75th birthday.   Gorbachev brought birthday gifts: flowers and a bottle of vodka.

       urlLink Because soccer isn't crazy enough...    AYUTHAYA (Thailand) - It sounds like a soccer player's worst nightmare: an opposing team whose players each have four legs, weigh no less than 900kg and can block a score simply by lying motionless in front of the goal.  But it was all part of the fun on Sunday as prison officials held an elephant match to discourage inmates from gambling on the Euro Cup in Portugal.  'We expect that people will support the idea that we can get fun from playing football, not gambling on football,' said director-general Nathee Chitsawang of the Thai Corrections Department in Ayuthaya, north of Bangkok.  The prisoners took on the animals, ridden by elephant drivers, from the Ayuthaya Elephant Palace and Royal Kraal. But the result was unclear: either a 5-5 draw or a creditable 7-6 win for the elephants, the BBC reported.  After the game, one of the most prolific elephant scorers, Kocharaa, celebrated by kicking its front legs in the air.  'We train the elephants every day to play soccer, kick the ball, and to keep from stepping on the other people,' said Mr Pattarapon Meepan of the Elephant Palace. 'They try their best. These elephants can do everything.'

       urlLink Heard on the BBC World Service last night ...      A weaver on a remote Scottish island is celebrating after one of the world's biggest sportswear firms incorporated his tweed design into its trainers.  Donald John MacKay's design, produced on a loom in a shed behind his house on Harris will soon feature on thousands of pairs of Nike women's training shoes.   Unable to cope on his own, Mr MacKay has enlisted the help of a nearby mill to meet the firm's massive order.   Experts described it as a massive boost to the ailing cottage industry.   Mr MacKay was first contacted by Nike last September and was asked to send several pieces of his hand-woven yarn.   Just a few weeks later the firm came back to request more small samples, then in March this year they contacted him with an order - the size of which left both he and his wife Maureen stunned.   " It doesn't just have to be grandpa's sports jacket or suit that is made with tweed - it is a very versatile material "  Donald John MacKay   He said: "I was in the weaving shed when Maureen came in to say Nike had placed an order for 950m to be done by the end of May.   "I thought that was a large order for us, then she came back in and said she had got it wrong - they actually wanted 9,500m."   Mrs MacKay said that after he and his wife had got over the "sheer panic" which initially struck them, they contacted the Kenneth Macleod mill on Lewis, which agreed to help them with the order.   Those in the industry believe the new product will take tweed to the height of fashion.   'Younger market'   Mr MacKay said: "It was a fantastic order and we have had more, larger, orders come in since then.   "I was very surprised when they first suggested the idea but it's a good thing for the industry and will hopefully capture a younger market.   "It is a good way to introduce younger people to the quality product that is Harris Tweed and show that it doesn't just have to be grandpa's sports jacket or suit that is made with tweed - it is a very versatile material.   "It will also carry the name around the world - not only will the trainers carry the Nike logo they will also bear the Harris Tweed label," he said.   It is understood the yarn will be used on several styles of women's training shoe which will go on sale later this year.
