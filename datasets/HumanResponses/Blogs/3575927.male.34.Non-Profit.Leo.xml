       1.0	 What is The Women’s Manifesto for Ghana? The Women’s Manifesto for Ghana is a document that outlines broad national issues of concern to women that needs to be addressed by the government and other relevant agencies within set time frames. It is an advocacy and lobbying document for the promotion of gender issues and women’s active participation in public decision-making processes.    2.0	 Why Does Ghana Need A Women’s Manifesto? The UN has given recognition to concerns of women and gender equality as a means of consciously acknowledging women’s contributions and placing values on them. The many UN conferences held since 1975 have strongly articulated issues about women’s inequality with men in society. Generally such meetings have noted that while women contribute substantially to all processes of socio-economic and political development, their involvement in the decisions that affect them is woefully limited. Thus in the Forward Looking Strategies (1985) and the Platform for Action (1995) specific measures have been proposed to ensure that there are progressive attempts to address gender imbalances. National governments who have endorsed these documents and other international conventions and agreements are expected to put in place institutional mechanisms that would serve as a basis for policy formulation and promote concerted action for addressing issues of gender on a regular and effective manner. In Ghana the establishment of a National Council on Women and Development (NCWD) enabled government to support many initiatives, especially income-generating activities to improve women’s economic well-being. Even though the NCWD succeeded in promoting certain laws such as the Interstate Succession law to address aspects of women’s concerns, it could not lay a strong foundation for women to be empowered enough to participate more effectively in decision-making processes beyond their involvement in survivalist initiatives. Currently the Ministry of Women’s and Children’s Affairs (MOWAC) is responsible for initiating an opportunity to initiate concrete policy measures that would lay the foundation for greater responsiveness to gender equality principles in the country. But the strategy for addressing such issues seem to be hinged on a priority interest in livelihood questions rather than linking those to the development of policies on gender to address inequalities.  Thus the Women’s Manifesto has been produced out of a concern about the insufficient attention to gender issues, the limited presence of women in public life and their poor participation in politics and policy making. It is a document that recognizes that women in spite of their differences, can work together and build a platform that would enable them to agree on a common set of demands, which need to be addressed for the achievement of gender equality and equity and national development.    3.0	 How Can the Manifesto be Used? Specifically, the Women’s Manifesto would allow women to articulate their concerns in Ghana’s 2004 Elections and beyond. Secondly, it will provide information for those who wish to become conscious of what is needed to achieve gender equity and become equipped to make demands for its realisation. Thirdly, it would also allow progressive women and men to use their votes as a bargaining tool and recruit others to do the same. Fourthly, it would allow women and men who are seeking political office to have something to work with once they are elected to Parliament and the District Assemblies.  Finally, it would promote accountability of political parties because it would be possible to assess them on where they stand in relation to issues that concern women as outlined in the Women’s Manifesto. In other words, the Women’s Manifesto could be used as a monitoring document to make political parties more sensitive to the problems that women face.   4.0	 Is the Women’s Manifesto idea new? The Women’s Manifesto idea is not new. Indeed Ghana’s process of developing and promoting the Women’s Manifesto has built upon the experiences of other countries in Africa that have embarked upon similar processes. These include Uganda, Botswana, Tanzania, South Africa, Zambia and Nigeria. Lessons drawn from those efforts pointed to the need to ensure that the Manifesto is one of several interconnected efforts; is owned by a broad constituency of women; is non-partisan but takes positions on broad national issues, policies and the political system as a whole. In some of these countries, Women’s Manifesto initiatives have led to the inclusion of women’s issues in political manifestos for the first time. In some situations, the use of Women’s Manifestoes have led to the increase of women’s representation in political decision-making processes. More generally in many of those countries, issues of women have remained on the political agenda.   5.0	 Who is Involved in the Development of the Manifesto?  ABANTU for Development initiated the Women Manifesto development and promotion process. ABANTU is an African and gender oriented NGO, which works on gender and policy advocacy issues. It initiates and strengthens the capacity of NGOs to be effective in influencing policies from a gender perspective.   The organisation is working in collaboration with civil society groups, District Assemblies, all Political Parties, NGOs working for gender equality, the media, and committed individual women and men. Among the groups that are active in the Manifesto production and dissemination process are the following: The Trades Union Congress (TUC), Ghana National Association of Teachers (GNAT), Women in Law and Development (WILDAF), Ghana Registered Nurses Association (GRNA), Network of Women’s Rights (NETRIGHT), Women in Broadcasting (WIB), African Women Lawyers Association (AWLA), The Ark Foundation, Ghana Society for the Blind, National Council for Women and Development (NCWD), Christian Council of Ghana and the Institute of Local Government Studies (ILGS).         6.0	How Much Work has been done so far? To ensure that a broad constituency participated in the Manifesto process, a series of consultations with different groups were organised to seek their mandate, ideas and views on critical issues of concern to women. This took place from June 2003-May 2004. Among these were consultations with women’s groups, NGOs and other civil society organisations from across the country; District Assemblywomen (180 in number) from the 110 constituencies in the country; Media women and men and representatives of political parties.  After these consultations, Drafting and Steering Committees, made up of progressive women and men, were set up to draft and make decisions on the process of developing and promoting the Manifesto.   Information generated through the various consultations served the basis for the production of a pre-draft Manifesto. From February 2004 to April 2004 three (3) meetings were held to draft the manifesto document. A final draft Manifesto was produced which was later used in April-May 2004 to organise broader regional consultations throughout the country for additional comments and suggestions. The processes involved in the production and dissemination of the Women’s Manifesto has culminated in the formation of a broad coalition of NGOs, working collaboratively for its acceptance and use by NGOs themselves, the government and its Ministries Departments and Agencies (MDAs), political parties and constitutional bodies. The Manifesto is expected to be circulated throughout the country.    7.0.	 What is Contained in the Manifesto? The Women’s Manifesto is made up of a preface, a preamble and ten (10) sections on the following themes: •	Women’s Economic Empowerment •	Women and Land •	Women, Social Development and Social Policy •	Women in Politics and Decision-making •	Women and the Law •	Discriminatory Practices Justified in the Name of Culture •	Women and Media •	Women, Conflict and Peace •	Women with Special Needs •	Institutions mandated to promote Women’s Rights   Each section begins with a gender analysis of the nature of the problem and follows up with concrete demands on the government, political parties and MDAs to address the situation within specific time-lines. Given the broad consultations, the advocacy and lobbying strategy being adopted and the sheer commitment of individual men and women, women’s NGOs and civil society organisations who have participated in the process of producing the Manifesto, there is a lot of optimism about its ability to contribute to the process of enhancing women’s participation in public affairs in the country.   8.0	 When will the Manifesto be ready? The final manifesto document will be ready by early July 2004.    9.0	Who is Supporting the Women’s Manifesto? It is important to acknowledge the role of the convenors and all members of the Drafting and Steering Committees of the Women’s Manifesto Project. Their insights and hard work have enabled women of Ghana produce a historical document that has the potential of laying the foundation for moving the political landscape towards greater gender equity.  The support provided by a number of organisations for this initiative has also been invaluable. They are: Ford Foundation, Actionaid-Ghana, Friedrich Ebert Foundation (FES), IBIS-Ghana, TWN-Africa, Media Foundation for West Africa (MFWA), Africa Women’s Development Fund (AWDF), The Global Fund for Women, Canadian Development Agency (CIDA). We are most grateful to them. Finally, we wish to thank the many women and men of Ghana whose views, experiences and insights provided the ingredients for producing and promoting this document.        10.0	 How can I become involved? There are a number of ways to become involved in making the Manifesto idea a reality. Organisation, institutions and all who are interested in gender issues are welcome to contribute to the process of drafting. You can also help in promoting it among different constituencies. Another way is to use it to inform your own work at specific levels. If you are a policy maker, you can use it to inform policy-making. For political party activists the document can be used to influence political party Manifestoes and enhance their interest in promoting women into political office.
