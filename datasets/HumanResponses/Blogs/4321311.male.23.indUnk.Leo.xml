Think about it . .  All I have to say is, when will they do somethingabout MY RIGHTS? I celebrate Christmas, but because it isn't celebrated by everyone, we can no longer say Merry Christmas. Now it has to be Season's Greetings. It's not Christmas vacation, it's Winter Break. Isn't it amazing how this winter break ALWAYS occurs over the Christmas holiday? We've gone so far the other way, bent over backwards to not offend anyone, that I am now being offended. But it seems that no one has a problem with that. This says it all!  > > This is an editorial written by American citizen, published in a Tampa newspaper He did quite a job; didn't he? Read on, please! IMMIGRANTS, NOT AMERICANS, MUST ADAPT.  I am tired of this nation worrying about whether we are offending some individual or their culture. Since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11,we have experienced a surge in patriotism by the majorityof Americans. However, the dust from the attacks had barely settled when the "politically correct! " crowd began complaining about the possibility that our patriotism was offending others.  I am not against immigration, nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who is seeking a better life by coming to America. Our population is almost entirely made up of descendants of immigrants. However, there are a few things that those who have recently come to our country, and apparently some born here, need to understand. This idea of America being a multicultural community has served only to dilute our sovereignty and ournational identity. As Americans, we have our own culture, ourown society, our own language and our own lifestyle.This culture has been developed over centuries of struggles, trials, andvictories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom.  We speak ENGLISH, not Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Ch! inese, Japanese, Russian, or any other language.Therefore, if you wish to become part of our society, learn the language!  "In God We Trust" is our national motto. This is notsome Christian, right wing, political slogan.. We adopted this motto because Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded this nation, and this is clearly documented.  It is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools. If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home, because God is part of our culture. If Stars and Stripes offend you, or you don't like Uncle Sam, then you should seriously consider a move to another part of this planet. We are happy with our culture and have no desire to change, and we really don't care how you did things where you came from. This is  OUR COUNTRY, our land, and our lifestyle. Our First Amendment gives every citizen the right to express his opi! nion and we will allow you every opportunity to do so. But once you are done complaining, whining, and griping about our flag our pledge, our national motto, or our way of life, I highly encourage you take advantage of one other great American freedom,  THE RIGHT TO LEAVE.  If you agree -- pass this along; if you don't agree -- delete it! AMEN    And my response:  I disagree strongly that one of the issues about this particular piece isn't "Is it a newspaper." Because, quite frankly, everyone who's ever read a newspaper knows it isn't. You can look at it and see that it was never in an editorial page. By saying "Newspaper story" you're attempting to give the opinion false credibility. It's no different than saying "From the Bible" or "From a speech in the State Senate." That's the first thing that really caught my eye. Everyone knows it's not a newspaper, but people will still pretend it is and that if has no effect on the validity of the arguments if it's not. If you start off with a lie, generally speaking, not going to continue on with logic and truth.  The second thing is the deffinition of the word sovreign. Maybe some of you who read it, and agreed, don't know what sovreign means. It means, more or less, "Supreme Authority within a sphere." Which is to say an entity that has self power. Should this wave of politically correct immigrants, who are typically quite poor and not all that involved in democracy on a lobby/radifying level, somehow convince Alaksa to declare it's independance THAT would challenge the sovereign state of America. Short of that, these saves of deep pocketed, lawyer hiring, bill changing immigrants are mearly changing things in a way that the author dosen't like. But maybe they didn't know what the word meant, so I won't hold it against them. The author has a very good point about Christmas and Political correctness. You can tell this because he speaks in Caps, and only intelligent things are said in caps. > > IMMIGRANTS,> > NOT AMERICANS,> > MUST ADAPT.  Indeed. And, in fact, should an Immigrant not want to learn English, they will not get most jobs. If an Immigrant breaks a civil oridence, you are free to call the police on them and have them fined or jailed, which will be done. If an Immigrant dosen't want to celebrate Christmas, say, they have their own stupid beliefs at the time like, say, something to do with candles and the faith of their people that's been around for 5,000 years, well sucks to them! Actually I did once have the good fortune to say "Merry Christmas!" to an Orthodox Jew in Kansas City. He smiled back and said "And Hapy Chanuanka to you!" That freaking immigrant. Practicing his own beliefs and equating them to mine. How dare he.  I would just like to ask the author two questions about the bits about Patriotism and the flag. One, what does it have to do with immigrants? Short of saying "Please stop rounding up, interning and spying on Arabs" I haven't heard a thing about the politically correct people attempting to defend the unwashed hordes that stem like a tide from other countries. The other rant that I'm confused about is the flag. Have you ever heard anyone, anyone at all, ever complain about anyone's nationial flag? Short of people pointing and laughing, or even admiring other's flags duing the Olympics, have you ever heard anyone talk about a flag? Ever? I haven't, besides maybe Eddie Izzard, and even that's sketchy. So then I assume the author is talking about the confederate flag that's still a symbol for some. Unfortunatly you have to get through the heads of a few people on this one. The Confederate flag is a symbol. It's not inheriently evil, it dosen't make you want to go out and hunt down black people. It does not contain the spirit of pissed off plantation owners. Should it be hurled back in time to, say, the battle of Hastings, the Vikings groups there would not look at it and say "You know what I'd like right about now? Some slaves." It's a Symbol. It means one thing to some people, they call it "Pride in heritage." It means another thing to others people, they call it "We just had a black man lynched here last year, and that there flag reminds us that it happened more often." But these DAMN IMMIGRANTS are ruining this flag. Somehow. I couldn't quite make the leap.  The "In God we Trust" bit. Melody, wisely, cut off an end part of the E-mail that states, so very well, what this E-mail is all about:> > If you agree -- pass this along;> > if you don't agree -- delete it!> > > > AMEN  Interesting final bit, yeah? Agree or shut it, and by the way, God is on our side. A message that has never been used by religion before. Ever. At all. A "Conspiracy" is a "Meeting of minds." In our terms, as modern Americans its "People who have more power than we like, doing things with said power that we don't agree with." "In God we Trust" is a Christian Slogan, and it hasn't been around since 1776. It wasn't around in the Civil War, it wasn't around in WWI or WWII. It was added in the 1950's. It is 30 years younger than the amendment that gives women the right to vote. If you REALLY think the founding fathers wanted "In God we Trust" on our coins, or our schools, you think they would have asked for it. I mean, most of them could read, and it's not like they were shy about asking for what they wanted. I find it very difficult to believe that Geroge Washington, a devote Christian, whom killed so many people for so many years in new and exciting ways would somehow forget to mention that he wanted God on the currency, in the schools and that he forgot the amendment "The Seperation of Church and State {unless the secular people act like a bunch of wankers and get on the religious people's nerves, in which case it's time to go to plan B}"  My favorite part about this rant about...immigrants and all the harm they are doing....is how he ends the Christian argument with "This is clearly founded." Which it's not, and as someone who's paid FAR too much for the knowledge of colonial American literature I can tell you that EVERYONE hated the Puritans. That Washington, devote as he was, would not allow Puritans into his command. Also, he loved the word "Zealot." But maybe he hasn't had six hours of mind numbingly boring Colonial literature, which makes him smarter to me, and he didn't know this. That's fair, no one in America is expected to know their own history besides the bits where people blew up. But ending a religious argument with "This is clearly stated" is like me saying "Because that's the way it was." or "So there!" or "Because you do!" Not terribly reasoned.  The Author then seems to forget what he was talking about and goes into the Stars and Stripes bit. Appearantly Immigrants hate stars and stripes. It boils their blood. They just sit around in whatever country they come from saying "I'd go to American, if it wern't for those freaking Stripes. And stars! 50? Who the hell do they think they are?" The author then makes the point that these "Immigrants" should get used to our culture. Which confuses the hell out of me. Didn't he just complain about how they've changed our culture? Maybe I misread. I thought the point of this was that "Immigrants" have changed our society. Maybe he should be the one who should have to accept the change, since they've appearntly won the battles.  I've also, for a matter of record, never heard of America's "Nationial Motto." We have a Nationial Motto? I know that people like to use the phrases "With Liberty and Justice for All" and "Out of many, one." Are people complaining about this? News to me. Maybe someone here can tell me any occurence of someone stating that our flag and our motto are bad. The Pledge certainly stirs up controversy every couple of...minutes with this kind person. The Pledge didn't, I repeat, did not contain the words "Under God" when it was first composed. That was also added in the 1950's. People, who don't quite like being under God, or over God, or inside God, or various descriptions of where they are in relation to God, don't think that they should have their secular state fused with God. But they don't really get all that militant about it, and until we are no longer facing a faceless enemy, it won't change, so he can rest easy on that one.  In conclusion: Not a newspaper story, but if you like it, that lie won't matter to you.  This isn't about Immigrants, but pretending it is helps the author make their points across without meeting any thought patterns of resistance from those that agree. Clever tactic, might want to re-evaluate your reading habbits if you didn't pick up on this as not being about immigrants.  You are free to celebrate Christmas, but if you are in a group situation, like a pagent, you may have to compromise. This isn't a infringement on your freedom, it's called the social contract.  Of the sparse amount of Immigrants I have met, attended class with, shaken their hand and talked to from the very few countries of Cuba, Chad, England, Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Canada, Niger and Peru none of them, not one, has ever made any claim about "Out of Many, One" or the flag or Christmas. Even if they had, unless they got a state to claim it's indepndence, didn't weaken or sovereign nature. Their opinions, the opinions of people who don't care about the difference between "I want to wish you a Merry Christmas" and "I want to wish you Happy Holidays" dosen't dilute the spirit, potency or unity of a nation. It just chaff's people who think their way is right.  The poster of this board lied twice, in two very clever ways. One claming that it was a Nespaper, and the other but omitting the real guts of this piece at the end. If you got as bored reading this as I imagine you would it was, simply: If you agree -- pass this along; if you don't agree -- delete it! AMEN. Sort of ruins the flow once you realize that it's a God Nut who isn't actually saying anything about immigrants and is just trying to either get you to agree or shut up, dosen't it?  Also, as a side note, Americans don't like the French. That's okay, they are used to it. But anyway, France is overwhelmingly Catholic, upwards of 90%. Their divorce and marriage laws are inaccordence with the Church. They are forcing religion on their schools and banning religious freedom in their country via the taking of religious symbols, namely Islamic clothing, away from people. They may, very soon, add God as a part of their daily School service. So my question is, do you want to be a REAL American, or do you want to be lke ths author and MOVE TO FRANCE!!!!! See what I did there? I made it so it's my way or you agree to be French and used capital letters and over puncuation.  PPS. Damn you Immigrants! You're diluting our sovereign nation! Why don't you go back to Puerto Rico! What? We own Puerto Rico. Oh that's so weird because we just played them in the Olympics. Yeah. Yeah we lost. What? Common wealth? What? Viginia is too? Interesting.
