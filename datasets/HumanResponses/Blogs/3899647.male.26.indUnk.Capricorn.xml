      The consumer epoch(ie the modern age) is the time period(which we are currently in) where ever increasing consumption is the hallmark of progress.  It doesnt matter what is consumer just so long as resources are turned into products to be purchased and then discard and still more purchased.  It is where things arent made to last, whether it be cars designed to fail after a while, to where tv shows are only 21 minutes long(with 9 minutes advertising), where the top news story becomes discarded after a few days, etc etc etc.  While Im sure a marxist would have a great time saying I told you so, I think theres more to it.  I think a fundamental shift is going to occur where the new political correctness is about conservation, and sustainablity.  And this isnt going to happen because people are going to realize the earth cant support indefinite increases in consumption, but because the indefinite consumption is going to stop because resources are going to become more scarce.  Sure this has been a common theme since the oil crisis in the early 70's, but now its really going to happen.  http://www.asponews.org/ http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/RRiraqWar.html   And its the Iraq war thats heralding the new age.  And its as simple as this - China and India and other third world countries are developing and are reaching out to grab the resources they need.  And the US is reaching out to block them.(ie reaching out and grabbing Iraq - the world's 2nd largest and most profitable oil fields).  Europe is helping as well.  Not directly for domestic political reasons and because they have a finer sense of timing.  (Personally I think the US has jumped the gun here, and for the wrong reasons, which any antiwar person could spell out in detail http://www.antiwar.com)  The consumer epoch was and is recongnized as unsustainable.  Its winding down now, and the Iraq war is speeding up the process.  It has resulted in higher energy prices and will result in financial adjustments down the road.  (the burden of which is going to fall on the indebted consumers and third world people struggling for a better future.)

      Mostly this blog is going to be an online vanity journal where I can publicly express my opinions but unlike most forums I cant be ignored ;).  Kidding aside though, I want a forum where I can set the topic and moderate to my liking.  So here goes, and I'll start off big here.  The war in Iraq.  I know it seems like a dead horse being beaten mercilessly, but I feel it is a truly a watershed moment in history.  And the biggest things are too come.  This will be another war that America loses, but unlike the war of 1812 and Vietnam it cant be ignored.  And its only starting to get ramped up.  It will certainly extend to neighbouring countries, because as long as America remains in Iraq, Iraq's neighbours are obligated to use Iraqi resistance to occupy the Americans(Funny that word).  For if Iraq settles into some sort of loose federation depending on America to protect and maintain the balance between Iraq's factions, then the pressure goes outwards - towards Iran and Saudia Arabia, with every other country feeling the pinch.  But thats not going to happen, more foreign intervention is incoming, and its not coming to help America battle Iraqi guerrilas, its coming to help the countries intervening.  Iran is already completely immeshed in it.  Turkey is ready to come(on the surface to help America, but really to seize northern Iraq and attack America's only true allies in the region)  So this is the theme, the future with a focus on the American expansion.
