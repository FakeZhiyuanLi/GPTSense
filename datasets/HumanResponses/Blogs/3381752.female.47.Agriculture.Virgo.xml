						   That's his job, that's what they pay him for Hauling rock back and forth in that big John Deere Fucking big, orange thing but..... I bring him Little Debbie snacks and he just, just  loves those little peanut butter chocolate-raspberry-coated-icy-treats w/me in the truck  With the cleavage in the truck He definately likes to fill my truck w/rock-ROCK She's back, ooh-wow, ooh-yeah, she's back, for some rock, she's back,for another load of rock And she's got those snacks in her car And she keeps bringing me treats, ooh,  I wonder, and I wonder, if she likes me?  But maybe she just likes my ROCK-just the ROCKS Or maybe my crushed gravel Don't go groveling on your gravel, never grovel on your gravel, Especially with the gravel pit man  Who does it for a living, But you know he likes it because it's what he does and There's nothing else for him to do,  Because there are no jobs in vermont except for................  Shoveling shit...gravel...whatever the fuck you're  talking about, You know you can shovel it, Compost...trash...garbage...who knows? Who the fuck knows?  I got a sticker on my truck but its expired, But they never look at it, cuz i got the cleavage going, And they never even ask me, It's been years since i got a new sticker, I just don't give a shit because it's only ten dollars  I mean, So hey, I give 'em presents, I give 'em bread,  I give 'em cardboard,I give 'em lead, i give 'em mercury, and all different sorts of things i bring down there all the time, And my simple presence should be enough, really, because i sing to the dumpman every wednesday, oh yeah, i do,  That's what i do, I'm a dumpster girl

						   Best Friends for Life Kisses on the Rocks Sexual temptation Living in a box  Why, oh why, can't I say goodbye Why can't I seem to let go  Singing together Reading out aloud Video game playing Keeping out of crowds  Why, oh why, can't I say goodbye Why can't I seem to let go  Cuddling on the sofa Watching old TV Ask me why I stay Cuz it's where I wanna be  Why, oh why, can't I say goodbye Why can't I seem to let go  No-no-no, I can't let go No-no-no, I can't let go Don't ask me, I just don't know I can't let go
