       "There is a point where you feel so small and helpless in an enormous, insane nightmare of a world that you cease to give a hoot and start laughing"    This is an edited version of an article first published in Collier's Weekly in August 1944, from The Guardian, Friday May 28, 2004: Refused official permission to join the forces invading France, Martha Gellhorn, who had covered nearly every theatre of the second world war, tricked an official into letting her board a hospital ship. She then locked herself in the vessel's toilet until it set off for Normandy. Unlike her husband, Ernest Hemingway, who was an accredited reporter writing for the same American magazine, Collier's Weekly, she made it to France to produce this dispatch. On her return to England she was arrested by the military police and sent to a nurses' training camp.   There was nothing to do now but wait. The big ship felt empty and strange. There were 422 beds covered with new blankets; and a bright, clean, well-equipped operating room, never before used; great cans marked "Whole Blood" stood on the decks; plasma bottles and supplies of drugs and bales of bandages were stored in handy places. Everything was ready, and any moment we would be leaving for France.   The endless varied ships in this invasion port were grey or camouflaged, and they seemed to have the right idea. We, on the other hand, were all fixed up like a sitting pigeon. Our ship was snowy white, with a green line running along the sides below the deck rail, and with many bright new red crosses painted on the hull and painted flat on the boat deck.   We were to travel alone. There was not so much as a pistol on board in the way of armament, and neither the English crew nor the American medical personnel had any notion of what happened to large, conspicuous white ships when they appeared in war, though everyone knew the Geneva agreement concerning such ships, and everyone hoped the Germans would take the said agreement seriously.   There were six nurses aboard, and they were fine girls. They came from Texas and Michigan and California and Wisconsin, and three weeks ago they were in the USA completing their training for this overseas assignment. They had been prepared to work on a hospital train, which would mean caring for wounded in sensible, steady railway carriages. Now they found themselves on a ship, about to move across the dark water of the Channel.   The nurses had worked day and night for two weeks to get this ship ready to receive wounded. They had scrubbed floors and walls, made beds, prepared supplies, and now their work was finished. They went on working, inventing odd jobs to keep busy during these final empty hours before the real work began. But two tired, brave, tough girls sat on a bench inside the hall of the ship, and painted their fingernails with bright red varnish and talked about wanting their mail and worried about their missing footlockers, their valuable footlockers which had in them the vital comfortable shoes and the unvital, probably never-to-be-worn evening dresses.   One of the ship's British officers, who had been in the Merchant Marine since the beginning of the war but had never yet set forth in a white ship, came to talk with the girls. He looked tired, and he was vastly amused by their nail polish. "It would be nice," he said, "if we could take that nail polish to London tonight, instead of where we're going."   The tall, pretty nurse held her hands out to see whether the job was well done. "No," she said. She was from Texas and spoke in a soft, slow voice. "'No. I'm glad to be going just where I'm going. Don't you know how happy those little old boys are going to be when they see us coming?"   Pulling out of the harbour that night, we passed a Liberty ship going the same way. The ship was grey against the grey water and the grey sky, and standing on her decks, packed solidly together, khaki, silent and unmoving, were American troops. No one waved and no one called. The crowded grey ship and the empty white ship sailed slowly out of the harbour towards France.   We crossed by daylight, and the morning seemed longer than other mornings. The captain never left the bridge and, all alone and beautifully white, we made our way through the mine-swept channel.   Then we saw the coast of France. As we closed in, there was one LCT [landing craft, tank] near us, with washing hung up on a line, and between the loud explosions of mines being detonated on the beach, one could hear dance music coming from its radio. There were barrage balloons, looking like comic toy elephants, bouncing in the high wind above the massed ships, and you could hear invisible planes flying behind the grey ceiling of cloud. Troops were unloading from big ships to heavy barges or to light craft, and on the shore, moving up brown roads that scarred the hillside, our tanks clanked slowly and steadily forward.   Then we stopped noticing the invasion, the ships, the ominous beach, because the first wounded had arrived. An LCT drew alongside our ship, pitching in the waves. A boy in a steel helmet shouted up to the crew at the aft rail, and a wooden box looking like a lidless coffin was lowered on a pulley, and with the greatest difficulty, bracing themselves against the movement of their boat, the men on the LCT laid a stretcher inside the box. The box was raised to our deck, and out of it was lifted someone who was closer to being a child than a man, dead-white and seemingly dying. The first wounded man to be brought to that ship for safety and care was a German prisoner.   Everything happened at once. We had six water ambulances - light motor launches that swung down from the ship's side and could be raised the same way when full of wounded. They carried six litter cases apiece, or as many walking wounded as could be crowded into them. Now they were being lowered, with shouted orders: "That beach over there where they've got streamers up."   "Take her in slow ... Those double round things that look like flat spools are mines ... You won't clear any submerged tanks, so look sharp ... Ready? ... Lower her!"   The stretcher-bearers, who were part of the American medical personnel, now started on their long, back-breaking job. By the end of that trip, their hands were padded with blisters and they were practically hospital cases themselves. For the wounded had to be got from the shore into our own water ambulances or into other craft, raised over the side, and then transported down the winding stairs of this converted pleasure ship to the wards. The ship's crew became volunteer stretcher-bearers instantly.   Below stairs, for three decks, the inside of the ship was a vast ward with double tiers of bunks. The routine of the ship ran marvellously, though four doctors, six nurses and about 14 medical orderlies had to be great people to care for 400 wounded men. From two o'clock one afternoon, until the ship docked in England again the next evening at seven, none of the medical personnel stopped work. And besides plasma and blood transfusions, re-dressing of wounds, examinations, administering of sedatives or opiates or oxygen and all the rest, operations were performed all night long. Only one soldier died on that ship, and he had come aboard a hopeless case.   It will be hard to tell you of the wounded, there were so many of them. There was no time to talk; there was too much else to do. They had to be fed as most of them had not eaten for two days; their shoes had to be cut off; they needed help to get out of their jackets; they wanted water; the nurses and orderlies, working like demons, had to be found and called quickly to a bunk where a man suddenly and desperately needed attention; plasma bottles had to be watched; cigarettes had to be lighted and held for those who could not use their hands; it seemed to take hours to pour hot coffee from the spout of a teapot into a mouth that just showed through bandages.   But the wounded talked among themselves, and as time went on you got to know them, by their faces and their wounds, not by their names. They were a magnificent, enduring bunch of men. Men smiled who were in such pain that all they really can have wanted to do was turn their heads away and cry, and men made jokes when they needed their strength just to survive.   All of them looked after one another, saying, "Give that boy a drink of water," or "Miss, see that ranger over there; he's in bad shape. Could you go to him?" All through the ship, men were asking after other men by name, anxiously, wondering if they were on board and how they were doing.   On a deck, in a bunk by the wall, lay a very young lieutenant. He had a bad chest wound, his face was white, and he lay too still. Suddenly he raised himself on his elbow and looked straight ahead of him, as if he did not know where he was. He had a gentle oval face and wide blue eyes and his eyes were full of horror and he did not speak. He had been wounded the first day, had lain out in a field for two days and then crawled back to our lines, sniped at by the Germans. He realised now that a German, badly wounded also in the chest, shoulder and legs, lay in the bunk behind him. The gentle-faced boy said very softly, because it was hard to speak, "I'd kill him if I could move." After that he did not speak for a long time; he was given oxygen and later operated on so that he could breathe.   The man behind him was a 19-year-old Austrian. He had fought for a year in Russia and half a year in France; he had been home for six days during this time. I thought he would die when he first came on board, but he got better. In the early morning hours he asked whether wounded prisoners were exchanged; would he ever get home again? I told him that I did not know about these arrangements, but that he had nothing to fear. I was not trying to be kind, but only trying to be as decent as the nurses and doctors were. The Austrian said, "Yes, yes." Then he added, "So many men, all wounded, want to get home. Why have we ever fought one another?" Perhaps because he came from a gentler race, his eyes filled up with tears. He was the only wounded prisoner on board who was grateful or polite, who said "Please" or "Thank you", or showed any normal human reaction.   There was an American soldier on that same deck with a head wound so horrible that he was not moved. Nothing could be done for him, and anything, any touch, would have made him worse. The next morning he was drinking coffee. His eyes looked very dark and strange, as if he had been a long way away, so far away that he almost could not get back. His face was set in lines of weariness and pain, but when asked how he felt, he said he was OK. He was never to say anything more; he asked for nothing and made no complaint.   On the next deck, there were many odd and wonderful men, who were less badly wounded and talked more. They talked even when they could not see one another's faces. It was all professional talk: Where they had landed, at what time, what opposition they had met, how they had got out, when they were wounded.   They spoke of the snipers, and there was endless talk about the women snipers, none of the talk very clear, but everyone believed it. There had been no French officers with these boys, who could have interpreted, and the Americans never knew what the villagers were saying.   Two men who thought they were being invited into an old woman's house to eat dinner were actually being warned of snipers in the attic; they somehow caught on to this fact in time. They were all baffled by the French and surprised by how much food there was in Normandy, forgetting that Normandy is one of the great food-producing areas of France. They thought the girls in the villages were amazingly well dressed. Everything was confused and astounding: first, there were the deadly bleak beaches, and then the villages where they were greeted with flowers and cookies - and often by snipers and booby traps.   A French boy of 17 lay in one of the bunks; he had been wounded in the back by a shell fragment. He lived and worked on his father's land, but he said the Germans had burned their chateau as they left. Two of the American boys in bunks alongside were worried about him. They were afraid he would be scared, a civilian kid all alone and in pain and not knowing any English and going to a strange country. But the French boy was very much a man and very tight-lipped. He kept his anxiety inside himself, though it showed in his eyes. His family was still there in the battle zone, and he did not know what had happened to them or how he would ever get back. The American soldiers said, "You tell that kid he's a better soldier than that Boche in the bunk next to him."   We did not like this Boche, who was 18 and blond and the most demanding of the "master" race aboard. Finally there was a crisp little scene when he told the orderly to move him, as he was uncomfortable, and the orderly said no, he would bleed if moved.   When I explained, the German said angrily, "How long, then, am I to lie here in pain in this miserable position?"   I asked the orderly what to say, and the orderly answered, "Tell him there are a lot of fine boys on this ship lying in worse pain in worse positions."   The American soldiers in the bunks around said, "What a Heinie!" wearily, and then they began wondering how they would find their old units again and how soon they would get mail.   When night came, the water ambulances were still churning in to the beach looking for wounded. Someone on an LCT had shouted out that there were maybe a hundred scattered along there somewhere. It was essential to try to get them aboard before the nightly air raid and before the dangerous dark cold could get into their hurt bodies.   Going in to shore, unable to see, and not knowing this tricky strip of water, was slow work. Two of the launch crew, armed with boathooks, hung over the side of the boat and stared at the black water, looking for obstacles, sunken vehicles or mines, and they kept the hooks ready to push us off the sand as we came closer in. For the tides were a nasty business, too. Part of the time, wounded had to be ferried out to the water ambulances on men's shoulders, and part of the time the water ambulances grounded and stuck on the beach together with other craft, stranded by the fast-moving sea.   We finally got on to a barge near the beach. The motor ambulance could not come inshore near enough to be of any use at this point, so we looked for a likelier anchorage farther down. We waded ashore, in water to our waists, having agreed that we would assemble the wounded from this area on board a beach LCT and wait until the tide allowed the motor ambulance to come back and call for us. It was almost dark by now, and one had a terrible feeling of working against time.   Everyone was violently busy on that crowded, dangerous shore. The pebbles were the size of apples and several feet deep, and we stumbled up a road that a huge road shovel was scooping out. We walked with the utmost care between the narrowly placed white tape lines that marked the mine-cleared path, and headed for a tent marked with a red cross.   Ducks and tanks and trucks were moving down this narrow rocky road, and one stepped just a little out of their way, but not beyond the tapes. The dust that rose in the grey night light seemed like the fog of war itself. Then we got off on to the grass, and it was perhaps the most surprising of all the day's surprises to smell the sweet smell of summer grass, a smell of cattle and peace and the sun that had warmed the earth some other time, when summer was real.   Inside the Red Cross tent there were two tired, unshaven, dirty, polite young men who said that the trucks were coming in here with the wounded, and where did we want to have them unloaded. We explained the problem of the tides and said the best thing was to run the trucks down to that LCT there and carry the wounded aboard, under the canvas roof covering, and we would get them off as soon as anything floated.   The Red Cross men said they didn't know whether wounded would be coming in all night or not; it was tough to transport them by road in the dark; anyway, they would send everything down to our agreed meeting place, and everyone said, "Well, good luck, fella," and we left. No one wasted time talking around here. You had a feeling of fierce and driven activity.   We returned to our small, unattractive piece of the beach and directed the unloading of a truck. The tide was coming in, and there was a narrow strip of water between the landing ramp of the LCT and the shore. The wounded were carried carefully and laid on the deck inside the great whale's-mouth cavern of the LCT. After that, there was a pause, with nothing to do.   Some American soldiers came up and began to talk. This had been an ugly piece of beach from the beginning, and they were still here, living in foxholes and supervising the uploading of supplies. They spoke of snipers in the hills a hundred yards or so behind the beach, and no one lighted a cigarette. They spoke of not having slept at all, but they seemed curiously pleased by the discovery that you could go without sleep and food and still function all right. Everyone agreed that the beach was a stinker, and that it would be a great pleasure to get the hell out of here some time.   Then there was our favourite American conversation: "Where're you from?" An American always has time to look for someone who knows his home town. We talked about Pittsburgh and Rosemont, Pennsylvania, Chicago and Cheyenne, not saying much except that they were swell places and had this beach licked every way for Sunday. Then one of the soldiers remarked that they had a nice foxhole about 50 yards inland and we were very welcome there, when the air raid started, if we didn't mind eating sand.   My companion, one of the stretcher-bearers from the ship, thanked them for their kind invitation and said that, on the other hand, we had guests aboard the LCT and we would have to stay home this evening. I wish I had known his name, because I would like to write it down here. He was one of the best and jolliest boys I've met any place, any time. He joked, no matter what happened, and toward the end of that night, we really began to enjoy ourselves. There is a point where you feel yourself so small and helpless in such an enormous, insane nightmare of a world, that you cease to give a hoot about anything and you renounce care and start laughing. He was lovely company, that boy was, and he was brave and competent, and I wish I had known his name.   He went off to search for the water ambulances and returned to say that there wasn't a sign of them, which meant that they couldn't get inshore yet and we would just have to wait and hope they could find this spot when it was black night. If they never found this place, the LCT would float later, and the British captain said he would run our wounded out to the hospital ship, though it would not be for hours.   Suddenly our flak started going up at the far end of the beach, and it was very beautiful, twinkling as it burst in the sky, and the tracers were as lovely as they always are; and no one took pleasure from the beauty of the scene. "We've had it now," said the stretcher-bearer. "There isn't any place we can put those wounded." I asked one of the soldiers, just for interest's sake, what they did in case of air raids, and he said well, you could go to a foxhole if you had time, but on the other hand, there really wasn't much to do. So we stood and watched, and there was altogether too much flak for comfort. We could not hear the planes or any bomb explosions, but, as everyone knows, flak is a bad thing to have fall on your head.   The soldiers now drifted off on their own business, and we boarded the LCT to keep the wounded company. The stretcher-bearer and I said to each other gloomily that, as an air-raid shelter, far better things than the hold of an LCT had been devised, and we went inside, not liking any of it, and feeling miserably worried about our wounded.   The wounded looked pretty bad and lay very still. In the light of one bare bulb, which hung from a girder, one could not see them well. Then one of them began to moan, and he said something. He was evidently conscious enough to notice this ghastly racket that was going on above us. The Oerlikons of our LCT now opened fire, and the noise inside the steel hold was as if they were driving rivets into your eardrums. The wounded man called out again, and I realised that he was speaking German.   We checked up, then, and found that we had an LCT full of wounded Germans, and the stretcher-bearer said, "Well, that's just dandy! By golly, if that isn't the pay-off!" Then he said, "If anything hits this ship, dammit, they deserve it." However, there were still the English crew and ourselves aboard and it seemed a rather expensive poetic justice.   The ack-ack lifted a bit, and the stretcher-bearer climbed up to the upper deck, like Sister Anne on the tower, to see where those water ambulances were. I clambered like a very awkward monkey up a ladder to the galley to get some coffee and so missed the spectacle of two German planes falling like fiery comets from the sky. They hit the beach to the right and left of us and burned in huge bonfires which lighted up the shore.   The beach, in this light, looked empty of human life, cluttered with dark square shapes of tanks and trucks and jeeps and ammunition boxes and all the motley equipment of war. It looked like a vast, uncanny black-and-red-flaring salvage dump.   Our LCT crew was delighted because they believed they had brought down one of the German planes, and everyone felt cheerful about the success of the ack-ack. A soldier shouted from shore that we had shot down four planes in all and it was nice work. The wounded were very silent, and those few who had their eyes open had very frightened eyes. They seemed to be listening with their eyes, and fearing what they could hear.   The night, too, went on longer than other nights. Our water ambulances found us, and there was a lot of incomprehensible cockney talk among the boatmen while the wounded were loaded from the now floating LCT to the small, bucking launch. We set out, happy because we were off the beach and because the wounded would be taken where they belonged.   The trip across that obstacle-studded piece of water was a chatty affair, due to the boat crew. "Crikey, mate, wot yer trying ter do? Ram a destroyer?" And, "By God, man, keep an eye in yer head! That's a tank radio pole." To which another answered, "Ye expect me to see a bloody piece of grass in this dark?" So, full of conversation, we zigzagged back to the ship and were at last swung aboard.   The American medical personnel, most of whom had never been in an air raid, tranquilly continued their work, asked no questions, showed no sign of even interest in this uproar, and handed out confidence as if it were a solid thing like bread. If I seem to insist too much in my admiration for these people, understand that one cannot insist too much. There is a kind of devotion, coupled with competence, which is almost too admirable to talk about; and they had all of it that can be had.   If anyone had come fresh to that ship in the night, someone unwounded, not attached to the ship, he would probably have been appalled. It began to look very Black Hole of Calcutta, because it was airless and ill-lit. Piles of bloody clothing had been cut off and dumped out of the way in corners; coffee cups and cigarette stubs littered the decks, plasma bottles hung from cords, and all the fearful surgical apparatus for holding broken bones made shadows on the walls.   There were wounded who groaned in their sleep or called out, and there was the soft, steady hum of conversation among the wounded who could not sleep. That is the way it would have looked to anyone seeing it fresh; a ship carrying a load of pain, with everyone waiting for daylight, everyone longing for England.   It was that, but it was something else, too; it was a safe ship, no matter what happened to it. We were together and we counted on one another. We knew that from the British captain to the pink-cheeked London messboy, every one of the ship's company did his job tirelessly and well. The wounded knew that the doctors and nurses and orderlies belonged to them utterly and would not fail them. And all of us knew that our wounded men were good men, and with their amazing help, their selflessness and self-control, we would get through all right.   There is very little more to write. The wounded looked much better in the morning. The human machine is the most delicate and rare of all, and it is obviously built to survive, if given half the chance. The ship moved steadily across the Channel, and we could feel England coming nearer. Then the coast came into sight, and the green of England looked quite different from how it had looked only two days ago: it looked cooler and clearer and wonderfully safe. The air of England flowed down through the wards, and the wounded seemed to feel it. The sound of their voices brightened and sharpened, and they began making dates with one another for when they would be on convalescent leave in London. The captain shouted down from the bridge, "Look at it! Just look at it!" He was too proud of the navy - his navy and ours - to say more. But he had spoken, in his pride, for all of us.   American ambulance companies were waiting on the pier, the same efficient, swift troops I had seen on the piers and landing ramps before we left. There were conferences on the quay between important shore personages and our captain and chief medical officer; and a few of us, old-timers by now, leaned over the rail and joked about being back in the paperwork department again. Everyone felt very happy and fine, and you could see it in their faces. The head nurse, smiling though grey with weariness, said, "We'll do it better next time," which seemed to me to be a very elegant thing to say.   As the first wounded were carried from the ship, the chief medical officer watching them said, "Made it." That was the great thing. Now they would restock their supplies, clean the ship, cover the beds with fresh blankets, sleep whatever hours they could, and then they would go back to France. But this trip was done; this much was to the good; they had made it.   · This is an edited version of an article first published in Collier's Weekly in August 1944. © estate of Martha Gellhorn.

      Mary Phillips-Sandy  The downtown 1 train at four forty-five in the morning is almost as crowded as it is at noon, but quieter. I am lucky to find a seat. There is a feeling of camaraderie amongst those of us who are up and about at this hour and I find myself feeling sorry when the scrappy-looking young man across from me disembarks at Columbus Circle. You’re leaving? Already? An older man with a black wool hat takes his place, sips coffee from a blue and white paper cup. Someone snores. The darkness of the tunnels is soothing; the station lights, too sudden.  Penn Station is never called Pennsylvania Station, although the walls in the subway say PENNSYLVANIA in capital letters.  In the waiting area a woman stumbles over to the pay phones, unzips her pants, and urinates all over the floor. Everyone watches. Ten minutes later there is an announcement. “Mop needed in east waiting room. Mop needed, repeat.” Everyone laughs.  An elderly man asleep. Two children, about six or seven, mock wrestling on the floor. A babyfaced Marine making a telephone call. “Hi, how are you? Yeah. Yeah. I didn’t sleep at all. Yeah, I just ate.”  More announcements come over the loudspeaker. All ahbawuhd. Lascall. Trenninphilladelphya. Washinnondeesy. Alllll ahbawuhd. My train is called. Bawstunsprinfield. I pick up my bags. It’s time to go.   As the sun sets in Waterville, Maine, the trees stand sentry against the sky, which is colored in shades the city knows only from shop windows and certain women’s eyelids. There is a palpable energy not in the streets or on the sidewalks but in the wind – a whiff of the Canadian tundra, hints of a cold fierce enough to kill. It buffets the chain stores that have sprung up around the interstate exits, but it cannot, nothing can, knock them loose. They are as much a part of the landscape as the river and the bridges and the smokeless smokestack of the empty mill.  On Main Street everyone I meet has one thing to ask. How is New York exclamation point question mark. Quick, think fast. Sum up the unsummable in a pithy phrase or two. Well, I say, fumbling. It’s an adjustment. They nod, expectant, wanting more. Well. There was the time the man leapt onto the train at 125th Street with a handkerchief pressed over his face. He inhaled deeply and fell down, laughing, hooting and screaming and huffing all the way to Times Square, where he crawled out the doors. There was the man in the fedora who said bless you honey as I took out the garbage one bright fall morning. Bless you and kept walking. What would you like? Would you like more? There was the time outside the Met when a cab turned right on red and had to come to a sudden stop to avoid hitting a pedestrian in the crosswalk. The man, who had a plastic child’s sled under his arm, wheeled about-face and began walloping the hood of the cab with the sled. “I know I shouldn’t laugh, but knowing that makes me laugh harder,” remarked a well-heeled blonde beside me. More, they clamor with their hands, insatiable, more.  There is more. There is a twenty-four hour deli where you can buy not one, not two, but ten different kinds of soy milk at any hour of the night or day. There is a grinning man who plays an acoustic guitar in the 14th Street tunnel, grinning and singing and bouncing on the balls of his feet for the people striding from the 1 2 3 9 to the F V L. There is a loneliness so sharp and pointed it takes your breath away, an ache like a hypodermic. There are sudden empty hours in which you wander the streets, wondering whatever shall I do with myself now? There is the warmth of a kitchen in Brooklyn, all white linoleum and deep red chairs, brown cigarettes and whiskey in coffee mugs. There are roasted peanuts for a dollar.   Do you like it? they ask.   The train slides south toward the city in the pitch-black night. I can see the lit streets leading straight into its heart, slabs of buildings on either side. I recognize the Triboro Bridge by the History Channel billboard below it; I remember fixing my eyes on that red and gold H as I drove across the bridge in a Ryder truck full of my possessions. The other bridges I do not know, not yet. I realize I am nervous, panicky, and not even the sight of the Chrysler Building can soothe me.   Life in central Maine is many things – cold, sedate – but at least it is rational. I can feel the ground under my feet, I can grasp my days and make sense of them. Here my grip slips. Where, after all, is the reason in ten different kinds of soy milk at three a.m.? Where is the reason in the man who fell to his knees on the subway and screamed for the love of God please help me it’s cold and I don’t even got no socks? Where is the reason in looking away (as everyone looked away)? Where is the reason in forty-foot billboards looming over the streets as though these particular blue jeans held the secret to world peace?  The train ducks into a tunnel and roars beneath the river, wheels thrumming. People around me begin to stir, stretching their cramped limbs and reaching for their luggage overhead. The blackness gives way to white tile walls, and the platform is in sight. I will make my way up the stairs and down the long hallways to the subway which will whisk me eighty-two blocks uptown, an express train if I’m lucky, although that means changing at 96th Street (and it occurs to me I know this now, as I know my middle name) – and this is Penn Station, says the conductor, this is New York City.

      Nick Johnstone From the Guardian, Jan 27, 2004  Blue notes: When are people going to get it through their thick heads that depression is an illness, not a hobby?  Depression is not a lifestyle choice. It chooses you, you don't choose it. Amazingly, the majority of people still seem to think that depression is an indulgence that one chooses, the way one chooses to splurge out on that Marc Jacobs scarf with the pretty stripes or a second helping of tiramisu. "People!" as Carson is wont to say on Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. "Enough already!" When are people in this country going to wake up and realise that depression is a serious illness?   When are we going to stop treating people suffering from depression like whiny, red-eyed couch-potato defeatists who could snap out of it if they only turned the temperature up on their stiff upper lip? Depression is as painful and debilitating as any severe physical illness. And yet there seems to be a national mental block that makes it impossible for people to comprehend that, whether physical or mental, illness is illness. Just because you can't see it, it doesn't mean it's not there. To write depression off as an indulgence is to buy lazily into a skewed hierarchy of illness. The same people who are quick to snap, "Cheer up", "Pull yourself together", "Chin up, old boy" or, my personal favourite, "Life could be worse", are the exact same people who would bend over backwards to help if you turned up to the office on crutches nursing a broken leg.   Depression is embarrassing for the stiff-upper-lip brigade. Look at the way the royal family still use Princess Diana's "mental state" as a get-out clause for any awkward news story they need to get rid of. It's so easy! Cite her mental problems and it's all over. "Oh yes," say the masses, "we forgot, she was unstable!" It's incredible how depression and mental illness are used to invalidate a person. Look at the way the Sun dealt with Frank Bruno being sectioned. "Bonkers Bruno!" I'd love to see Sun editorial staff responsible for that headline thrown into a Freaky Friday scenario in which they trade places with Bruno on the day he was sectioned. It could be screened as a reality-TV show. Oh, the fun we'd have!   Aside from causing the stiff-upper-lip brigade to break out in a cold sweat, depression also frightens the living daylights out of middle England, a demographic that thrives on scare stories. In their paranoid minds, the leap from mildly depressed person to psychopathic axe murderer is but a copy of the Daily Mail away. And this is where there's much work to do. The taboos and stereotypes surrounding mental illnesses such as depression are stoked by a lack of information.   Why is it not common knowledge that there are many different types of depression? Probably because people don't want to talk about mental illness. It's depressing, they say. As someone who has been on and off antidepressants for 15 years, I find it infuriating to hear the word "depressed" misused so infectiously in everyday life. Depression is not groaning at the bombed-out state of your current account, moping for a few weeks after a break-up or hating your job.   Depression is an agonising illness that takes over your life, screws up your brain chemistry, makes you cry over the silliest little things, kills your sex drive, shatters all interest in the things you usually love doing, isolates you from friends, partners and family, makes you sleep all day and lie awake all night, either exaggerates or assassinates your appetite, takes you to a point where you think it's quite normal to hurt yourself and lastly, when the alarm bells are screeching, makes a compelling case that you'd be better off dead. That is depression. It can affect anyone. It does not discriminate. It doesn't care what class you're from, what your sexual preference is, what ethnic group you belong to, what job you do, how old you are.   So throw out the cliche that depression is a class indulgence, a luxury that only the middle and upper classes can afford. This trite generalisation, while it may go down well with the Julie Burchill fan club, is laughably inaccurate. The point is this: people going through depression need compassion and understanding. It's an illness that leaves sufferers feeling cut off and voiceless. Telling someone who is depressed to pull themselves together is like telling an amputee to put his leg back on. Depression is not something that you choose to suffer from. Having lost one of my closest friends to suicide, I can vouch for that.    urlLink Nick Johnstone

      yesterday was a lost day at work... talked to ed, he'd split up from jenny the night before, he not good, spoke to mum, she off sick and just talked to him, he crying. neither boss or t in so i didn't do an inch of work just festered and waited to go see ed..spent so much time on this page but it was all template stuff and ended up scrapping it this morning....kinda fun though. then i was just getting towards going when t rang and then came in, even though it her day off - cos her marriage on the rocks. shit. she so brave though. what the hell's going on here with everyone splitting up like a plague?! had quite a nice night with ed in the end (such a contrast to looking after k), he feeling so so bad, and i feel horribly emotional for him. but we sat in his room and chatted and smoked; went to the social for food and beer and chatted and smoked some more. along came sophie and brodie, always like sophie but liked brodie too yesterday. and back to the kitchen, bells whiskey, went down too well, more chatting with lee also, all about our fucked-upness in the past, nmadness generally, stuff we only know from growing up together, and then naomi and jude....so i felt ok to leave him...  just walked in on boss and ian looking so so suspicious, and red, and strange....thats not cool....  this from steve yesterday after my work trauma of having to have "the looper" in my room the previous day: "Your life seems to have gone down hill since I left. Try throwing things at Katy, heavy objects. Be a strong and brave monkey". always cheers me up the weird bastard...  my soppy ansaphone msg for tim the other nite didnt go quite to plan cos he answered the phone : "Ola!"...."oh you answered...meh..." had been at summers house all night with wife and kate, it was nice, took a bottle of vodka, we were all looking at photos, she got such nice ones of him, oh yeah, her room looks lush, really good.  so anyway was a tiny bit tipsy but it was actualy a really cool conversation, and i kinda believe him over kate with a certain emma story so thats cool...i got teary and apologised for always being sarcastic at end bla bla 'i do really like you' bleh and he was like 'i know...i know...its all cool'. he was sweet, and we told eachother we were worth it, whatever other people say... of course since yesterday i'm convinced i'm next in line for a dumping...i've warned him "i'll kill ya" though...  mum got on her first plane flight for like 5 years today, finally. guess there'll be there by now, only to france...as long as it did't crash..having same phobia not good. hope it was cool..  there was the  urlLink smallest horse in the world  on gmtv this morning, called peanut. he was sweet.

      i can dream of all that yet i have a horrible suspicion that i don't give a fuck where i live as long as its full of cats, dogs, plants, a baby or so, cosy and messy as hell and him. thats awful but i think very true! boss has been at tracy's desk all day - why have i not been sacked yet? a week tomorrow i will have worked an entire year here, at this little desk. and if everything goes to plan (everything has to be prefaced with that at the moment cos there's a lot of if's with everything that means stuff and i'm waiting for at the moment...) i will only have a month and a half left....good or bad? good to change...will miss here though, i mean living here. the end of FIVE years and so many stories and friends! but london and nursing, baby, here i come....if everything goes to plan (!) spoke to tim on phone, he all moody at the start, he's paying for college stuff and contacts before he can buy plane ticket...got the impression he may be leading up to a sorry i can't come but he said he wasn't. hope bloody not! he cheered up and it was pretty much normal by the end...he's loving his rugby. told him andrew had split up with kate: "Unnnlucky"....how sympathetic and feeling he is!  realised i am mostly just sarcastic to him cos he's so useless at being touchy-feely...may have to leave a tipsy lovey ansafone msg soon just to scare him off all over again...he loves it really.... round to lauras tonight, kate gona be there too. thank goodness wife coming too, we can be paragons of normalcy - ha! or nr paragons of relative happiness perhaps....

      my friend kate's boyfriend split up with her yesterday afternoon. more than distraught. i was the 'counsellor' all last night. my housemate can't deal with that stuff so it's all down to me.  sympathetic, thoughtful, good advice bla bla. but it all bores me and i'm too selfish for all that, it's all fake that i'm that understanding and good. in reality i'm dreading next few days and weeks of having to 'be there' all the time. what a bitch i am.  so i'm exhausted and grumpy in work today.  i've decided i can't get to sleep with a girl in my bed unless i'm drunk, otherwise i get insomniac, need to stretch out...with a guy i'm not so bad cos cuddling makes me secure... storms and thunder though here in the hills today, so seldom we get it here, cheered me up. missing tim bad today since all that stuff last night, wanna hear his voice and have him cheer me up, tease me, whatever. i did actual work today between 10 and 11.30, other than that i've been pretty shit. no change there then. i jus wanna go home and lie on the sofa, watch neighbours...  weekend: moloko both nights, both me and L much drunker sat with anwen and fletch, cool nite but they had to leave early. fight with the barmaid over three mandarin mojitos..oh dear. i won with the manager. gravy and chips on way home, jonathon ross on telly even better when hammered. sunday up to bont to see ed, he ok, some troubles he talkin about, maybe drinking a lil too much...existential angst..him and jenny, guitar comes first...then down to town to meet up with sophie & lee and to the gatekeeper..then wife, then michael, then the other 18 yr old females....at 9 to see  urlLink eternal sunshine of the spotless mind . good, depressing. kate winslet lovely, as was the iced up Charles and the snowy beaches...

      yep well pub tues was: ed (new toni and guy haircut = cool as!) sophie lee = good.  k = arrgh.  only maternal protectiveness though and he says he was alright with the interrogation....pub quiz - team gay whiskey - lost horribly through sitting outside. i got very very cold = grumpy as hell with everyone other than ed. fit chris there, sophie making herself known to him. i love knowing sophie, she's got all my mad parts that naomi ain't. she gets obsessed, she babbles, and she tells everyone/anyone anything/everything.  pete had given her the brush off full on don't want a relationship with you shit. sophie text = "well thats all fine but i was hoping we could have a lot more of the sex together...". told her various embarassing sexual and otherwise texts i've sent which other people have cringed at me for and instead of lambasting me for my idiocy or blushing as everyone else does she proceeded to note them down in her head for future (that night) use with pete.... sophie voice at everyone telling her off for doing all the running: "but the sex is really  really  good. he's really.......i finished off the sentence for her successfully whilst grinning, to k and wife's non-surprise and everyone elses groaning. sunny and warm days since saturday, mmmmmm. horses seem well, will miss them. think M wants to marry me. rather worrying. got it all planned. trouble is he wants his dog as the ringbearer whereas i would prefer a a big fat cat, with a little bell on the ribbon as well as the rings, who just plodded along down the aisle in a dignified fat manner. anyway..... he sent me a  urlLink jungian personality test  to assess our marriageablility...good lord. anyway, i came out as  urlLink ENFP . yes well, ahem, certain aspects struck a chord....see 'relp. weaknesses'. ooops. so today i have been discovering  urlLink my bloody valentine  and  urlLink T.I.  excellent. should probly do some bloody work.

      weird weird weekend...wasn't gonna go out friday, but wife persuaded me to go for a quick drink. which turned into many vodka's for the three witches before we left the house. then to isit, budvar, aftershock, asked for iio's rapture dj promised but didn't fulfil. good music though (in isit??!)...and then to moloko's, didn't dream of going home as had promised self. for first time in literally years hadn't taken phone. the importance of this will become clearer later. drunk. very drunk. saw jamie - oh my god saw jamie where's laura bla bla. too drunk to care enough. she was good though. G and johnny upstairs spent most time talking to them, that was good, really nice. k being a bit of a bitch and asking me and G lots of unnecessarily mean things about break-up. if had been less drunk would have argued with her but only realised morning after the out of order-ness. more beer not a good idea. musta been pmt cos i was so over drunk.  home with laura and G, that nice - more bitchy looks from K just cos G walking us home...so good to be home. couldn't see the telly mind. checked my phone. ed ringing me all night. shit. had texted him that afternoon and he so good: "got some wicked jeans" etc., so i didn't worry. i NEVER leave my phone when i go out. mum and dad never go out the country. ed never loses his mind. all happened on same night. such a scary upsetting horrifying phonecall. sick when i got off phone. went to sleep sitting up cos so sure gonna be sick....slept a bit.   woke up feeling like death. sure ed felt worse. had to get ready to go for thai meal with zoe etc. at 2pm. last thing i felt like but i always pull out, haven't seen 'em for so long. started to get ready, but ed rang, wanted to pop round. phoned zoe - had a valid excuse of course, arranged to meet them after. ed looked like i felt. then jude came round. house a mess. hangover like a dog, worst endo pains in months. walked to meet naomi from central stn. hot gorgeous day, but the atmosphere so weird. deserted because the match had started (rugby league final), but rubbish everywhere, hot empty dirty city, felt like something bad had happened.  walked to the park stopping for chips and cheese at market, bacon bun for ed. atmosphere making us both feel weirder...park better, almost slept. usual spot.   but by half 4 figured should ring zoe, they sitting outside in brewery quarter. said goodbye to ed, since then he's been better touch wood. chose the worst time to ring then walk to meet them, from park to yard, as in past the stadim, as in past the stadium spewing red and white rugby fans in a tidal wave towards me, kids with horns so loud you see the soundwaves, men men men northern men, me heading the other way in my little top from japan my little turquoise shoes ha ha! they sitting outside that cool. i so not in the mood with my pain and hangover and shattered tiredness, and the belief that i didn't have any tablets and hadn't taken any since thursday and couldnt get to a dr til monday (i found some when got home that night so staved off withdrawal) yet i held on good. stayed from half 4 to 11, oh yeh.  it was a bit of a struggle but im pleased i didn't pull out, so lovely to see them all. zoe still wonderful! su horribly drunk, talked to rach and carina more than usual. wife came to join me when she got off train from bristol about 9, that was good. neil turned up for half an hour! apologised for being 'rude' to me last time he saw me (naomi's birthday)...no just horrendous drunk flirting from both sides i think..yep.  so good to go to sleep that night. not until tv and talkin for a good while though, jonathon ross again! ronnie o'sullivan...nice nice. morrissey = weird. thats a pretty obvious statement though.  sunday was better. woke late. mum and dad back in country. that a relief. got up and breakfasted then straight to park (lush day again), usual spot, ed, naomi, emma(?), jude...ed good, i better, all together so much nicer. relaxing. and then a normal sunday generally ... thank goodness.  til kate txted me to ring her at midnight and even though i off to bed i had to. on the phone til half 1, she told me something she's only ever told one other person in her life. i don't want to have been told what she told me its too upsetting. i'm carrying round this all encompassing secret too now. i don't know if i can help. too much. seeing her for first time since that conversation in pub tonight.  monday tracy came in, her marriage over. her marriage over for God's sake. bad. the massivest thing in the world yet she so brave and so good.   don't think tims gonna come over. had worst conversation mon night. he not there for me. wish i didn't love him. don't want to have THAT conversation but can feel it coming. fuck. just, unfair.

Just because I've been there :)  Awful painting mind! This is cool about our favourite grumpy buddha: "But that which I did more admire than all the rest was a mighty idoll of bras[s], called by them Daibutsu, and standeth in a vallie betwixt 2 mountaynes, the howse being quite rotten away... This idoll is made sitting cros legged (telor lyke)... I was within the hollownes of it and it is as large as a greate howse. I doe esteem it to be bigger then that at Roads, which was taken for 1 of the 7 wonders of the world... It is thought 3000 horses would nothing neare carry away the copper of this. In fine, it is a wonderfull thinge." Richard Cocks, October 18, 1616, quoted in They Came to Japan, by Michael Cooper. I wish i had the time and energy to write all about Oz and Japan, Japan especially, God its less than 5 weeks since we got back but already feels like another world. Suffice to say that whole day around kamakura was one of the best if not the best. our trek to the daibutsu was so so good, even if it nearly did end in hysterics and us setting up camp there and never making it back to tokyo let alone the uk! i miss tokyo. Read  urlLink this   for a nice description of being an american gaijin in japan in the 60s.

      I just found out who won  urlLink  american idol  by accident whilst browsing through random blogs this afternoon. thats not funny. sunday night, when the final manages to make its way over to this backwards country on itv2, was gonna be a highlight of my tv-watching week and now i know the bloody result. and the highlight of my tv month was gonna be the friends finale friday, yeh we only get that here in the country of Luddism tomorrow night. well i stumbled across the ending of that too didn't i. Meh. Everyone's been telling me i'm really grumpy at the moment and upon reading the above i'm inclined to agree. not surprising really. i'm not gonna make a list but yeh, not surprising. still no word from the american. am slowly coming to terms with that situation. half anger half denial and a striking conviction that k has or will have some major part in this crapness. I did the 'Which founding father are you quiz?'.  Apparently I'm Alexander Hamilton:  "You have very little faith in humanity. But you still care a great deal about the stupid little dolts, despite your best efforts not to. You adhere to social convention when required, but have no patience with the machinations that it sometimes involves. Watch out for feelings of fatalism; they can get you in hot water."  Yep, sounds about right. Dunno what the bloke's like other than that but oddly enough he's about to make his first appearance on the next page of my current read the  urlLink penguin history of the usa  by hugh brogan(187 pages of ridiculously small print down, 550 to go baby). went to welsh club last night, likely to be the last time (ever?) that i go on our once obligatory weekly wednesday outing. of course its not the same any more, we feel old and don't recognise all the songs or even more worryingly, most of the people. summers went in to the main room yesterday and came out saying "ooh its such a weird atmosphere in there, pretentious and cliquey and i don't recognise anyone". G burst out laughing and told us that us 3 (gnomes as well of course) WERE that atmosphere in the 1st and 2nd years! we were principle proponents of that which scared other less 'cool' (ha!) people such as he, off. nice to know.... but last night me wife and M (who came round after his footie training and showered and ate at ours) met eveyone else at gaykeeper (everyone being groups held together conclusively unsuccessfully by me and to a lesser extent wife - 1. ed, soph, brodie, the other 2 eds and various females; 2. summers, k, lucy, pete dj and other lucy housemates; plus 3. the wildcards of G and M), and then about 11 waltzed past the queue due to previous stampage (always satisfying). we made our own little space on the top floor (well just us oldies the eds etcetera all disappeared inc. my ed who went home miserable:()and due to us giving pete a verbal request list in the pub proceeded to sweatily dance the night away to such greats as (amongst others): caught by the fuzz ( urlLink supergrass ), do you remember the first time ( urlLink pulp ), northern lites ( urlLink super furries ), blister in the sun ( urlLink violent femmes ), monkey gone to heaven ( urlLink pixies ), beat it ( urlLink michael ), hey ya ( urlLink outkast ) and as a finale with all the lights on, to all of our, especially the wifes, delight, take on me ( urlLink a-ha ). oh we did well with our dancing we did.

And then  urlLink When Harry Met Sally , which i have  never  seen before, which is odd considering my penchant for romantic comedies and for meg ryan. yes i admit i'm one of those weird people who loves, i mean loves,  urlLink sleepless in seattle . and also  urlLink french kiss .  but she doesn't come above sandra bullock, of course - i mean  urlLink while you were sleeping  and  urlLink miss congeniality , you can't get much better than that :)... Oh but yes, i did, as expected, like when harry met sally a lot. it made me cry, and it was funny. so this coming weekend a certain  urlLink man of perfection   is going to be in our humble town, due to the chrystal palace playoff on saturday. oh joy. oh if i could see him i really would be very happy indeed! unlikely it may be, but that day i will be wearing full make-up and some excellent outfit  just in case . he on the other hand, would probably be a little scared... oh and while we talk of perfection my love of  urlLink cary grant  has been growing. i need to see some more of his films, i do. oh yes, i also watched  urlLink pushing tin , a bad film which i've seen before - why would you watch a bad film that you've seen before again i hear you ask. well it has got  urlLink john cusack , billy bob thornton, angelina jolie and cate blanchett in you see. and its about air traffic controllers, which i like, a lot. oh, and it has john cusack in. did i already say that?

Now the hippogriff - well the hippogriff was pretty much the best thing ever.  2nd was the snowy hogsmead scenes.  ooh yes.  3rd was hagrid.  Oh how i wish i was magic! I've browsed through a  lot  of blogs today.  I need to start doing some of the endless stuff that i  need  to do instead.  Motivation needed motivation needed.

      I'm at work. I'm quite happily bored but bored nevertheless. At least we're both in today. I have whiled away the time emailing but no-one has been good enough to reply yet. I am only getting emails from someone whose name begins with an M. Someone who, along with Ga and Gr, ruined me and the wifes little attempt at a friday night in. It involved great drunkenness (NOT from us); vomiting; sad puppy dog look; forcible cuddles bla bla. and that was just the M. Ah well, I'll get to see the friends finale some day. Got champagne on Sat so shouldnt really complain. Trouble is now i feel indebted. My room is now half bare, many of my worldly possessions having been carted off in a van sunday lunchtime. That was weird. Didn't like the feeling of all 3 just driving off without me. Saturday night was lovely though, the chinese as good as ever, seeing ma and pa great. didnt get to see mr harman though, great disappointment. fell asleep in the park for a little while sun afternoon halfway from walking back from the bont (where we said g-bye), then home to a (quite) bear (or even bare!) flat. L not there either this weekend .met k and summers at pub for evening, summers with dan and daz traumas! Bank holiday mon. slept forever. then afternoon shopping with k an summers, havent been shopping in an age. its great... they didnt stay the whole evening, and wife was back. then got to watch OC finale on my own. that made up for a lot. it was good good good. I'm not as much of a solitary person as this blog makes out. just that the solitary time i do have is so rare i really really enjoy it! tim has turned *more* attentive since i spent $552 on him. thats more attentive than non-attentive. pa says thats obviously the way to go! there is nothing to be said about work. nothing. other than it was the loopers birthday today and without warning she didnt turn up. so the nice pink roses we'd bought her especially are dying...hmph-u-ty-pmph.   Ed rang me yesterday afternoon "what do you do if someones taken 10 paracetamol. do they die?" "Nah but best get 'em to see a dr. possibiity of liver problems in next few days." "ok bye". she's ok now. silly girl. and poor ed.  i might shut up now... might even go home....

      So nothing of majorness to report. but went to the big smoke on wednesday for my selection day.  sunny and hot as seems to be the way.  bombardment of information.  gonna be so so skint.  gonna have to work very hard indeed.  probly gonna be three years with a lot of struggle.  didn't change my mind that its what i want to do though.  or that it's the city to do it in.  i'm so different to how i was when i was doing same thing at 18.  so so many questions this time, no taking of any shit from anyone, not caring what everyone else thought of me.  so assertive.  so annoying!  18 year old would have hated all my questions, lengthening the day....even 23 yr old me kind of does!  reasonably happy.  lots to look forward to.  except for k pretty much making me feel like shit every time she sees me with her obsession with my t.  just feel like its stopping me even looking forward to him being here because i'm so worried about the ensuing stress and repeated barbed comments that are gonna come my way, which he of course bless him, probably won't be aware of.  and the general feeling of apprehension if we ever DO get any time together that i'm offending her/ he's not happy bla bla. thus tension all the way and him thinking that i'm acting really weird. yet thats cos i've had it for 6 months now, just building up building up.  if this is a plan then she's doing very very well and i applaud her talent for fucking things up.  by last night (her and summers just came round to watch telly, was lovely to see one of them) i was feeling like she's trying to break me.  i'd pretty much given up smoking at home.  until last night.  she has started on G now as well.  there's gonna be some kind of reaction from me soon. i need to be careful.  That's the rant out of the way.  Not in my head mind.  Its sunny outside and its Friday and tomorrow I will hopefully see N and I can't wait for that.  Really can't wait, don't care how upset she is, just want to see her.  Have missed her so bad.  And Euro2004 starts this weekend, wimbledon soon, and BB is actually good this year.  Bro coming to see me next week.  I hopefully have an amazon parcel waiting for me at home including two steinbecks -    Zese are ze zings I sould be zinking of. Yes.

      I'm just gonna include some of the emailage there's been over the last few days. that'll say most of what there is to say and feel of the last few days. except for this - t.r. split up with my best friend in the world - bosom friend! - by email, 5 days before she was due to come back off her travels to live with him.  Its such a ridiculously awful situation there's nothing more to say of it..... plus m found out tim coming to stay and started slagging him off big style and getting overly depressed - so i've finally had to defend him and since that there's been nothing from the m. thats really sad. but i couldnt do anything else. I watched D-day 60th anniversary stuff all sunday afternoon. cried and cried. humbling not even the word.  Back to the non-comparable everday idiocy of my life: Emailage to ex-roomie of weirdness: Hi Peter, My last day is on the 25th of June. woow wwooooo! me and tracy just set up an "I resign" countdown clock. as of right now as i am writing this part of this email we both have 17 days 0 hours 53 mins and 20 secs left. and counting.  you thought your leaving do was bad? well we have both been here over a year, and are having a joint leaving do, on a friday. and so far NO-ONE is coming. its me tracy and katy. thats pretty sad isn't it? You look like a fucking clown anyway, don't worry about it.  I can't believe you're moving in with a girl!! more specifically with sharon! how weird!! Ok, does she still have a boyfriend?  If yes, then 1. what does he think about this? and 2. why ain't she moving in with him?   If no, then 1. you're in there! 2. is she a little stalky? 3. you're in there! I thought Irlam was spelt Earlham. I am very confused. That dr pull chart spreadsheet would be great ta. i'd appreciate you sending it to me. My plans for the next few months are:-  tomorrow - go to kings selection day in london and make sure that yes indeed i am clever enough to do their course, then go to oxford circus topshop before i get the train back;  from tomorrow until fri 25th june - try to finish working here without being sacked;  on the 25th - have a crap leaving do, cry drunkenly at tracy and tell her how great she is;  for the next week after that (28th june to 5th july - my final week here) - re-seduce tim using all my powers whilst he is here visiting plus try and stop m from descending deeper into "i love you" depression;  the week after that - drive back home with my shorn brother and the rest of my stuff;  then for the next two and a half months - get lonely, read a lot, start talking to tabby more than usual, find a dead-end summer job, sunbathe as much as possible, smoke less than usual, and wait to go to london;  then from mid september - hopefully go to london, start doing a lot of gory things and pull some drs (those two things preferably not in the same moment). Is that detailed enough? That was fun! What are you doing for the next few months peter? Same detail please. cathxxx PS. I went back into wxm mode at the weekend. We went to Cuba Saturday night and i beat up a man, whilst swearing at him at the top of my voice.  I hit him hard enough that he left. He was a twat -I only hit him because he hit me. Anyway, I'm sure it was a pleasant sight for all. Wife was a little shocked i feel.   Emailage to/from me darlin: It's not really an email about nigel, who is me and the wife's pet tiger and my surrogate son, and who you shall be meeting very soon. I just couldn't think of anything to put in the 'subject' box.  I hope you have recovered from your hangover now, how was the gym and have you recruited anyone else to your and kyle's newly designed bouncy-rugby or whatever it is called?:)   In fact there is no reason whatsoever for this email generally, I just wanted to say I can't wait to see you and can't believe how soon it is!! Very very excited! We're gonna have so much fun, don't worry about people being miserable - me, summers and j are all v. happy (touch wood) and n will be so chuffed to see you it'll cheer her up.  And k, well, she is a law unto herself. Would you rather stay at mine or hers? Please say mine... I'm hoping it will be lush and sunny as well cos it might be only time I'm off work during the summer as well. I know this is really sappy but I'm really happy we've stuck with being together so far even though its such long distance. Alright you can stop making throwing-up noises, Love cathxxxxx  i can't wait to meet nigel.  i'm sure he's lovely feline.  as a matter of fact kyle and i have added a few more rules and when we've perfected the game a few kids have showed interest so when all is said and done we'll have a 10 team league in the Rug-a-buff Ball League.  that's what we've decided to name it.  Rug-a-buff Ball.  i can't wait to get over there as well.  and obviously i'll be staying with you.  not only b/c i've been waiting to see you but i'm not sure i want to be thrown directly into the pit of dispair at k's house.  i'm sure i'll get an earfull when i get over there but i'd rather keep it to a minimum.  well deary i got work to do.   love, tim  ah bless he's a sweetie at heart.....

       urlLink    The Sick Child - Edvard Munch.  1885-6.  The National Gallery, Oslo.  Had my hospital appointment on Tuesday.  That was a bad day.  I have to have a scan then the operation.  I wanted to be told I was just a hypochondriac, that it was nothing.   Got on the bus going the wrong way after cos was in a state...ended up in the island of barry.  very hot sunny windy, decrepit (i would like to say victoriana but) 60's amusements, fat-soaked chips, dirty but soft silky sandy beach, beautiful cliff which blew the cobwebs out of my numb mind and body, helicopter.  home on late hot train trying not to cry.  told wife summers and N that evening. Constantly having horribly disturbing dreams with k and g in.  she always being bad, like a warning.  yet exactly same as she is in real life just slightly more extreme. making me uneasy and sick about everything. had an awful and quite cruel conversation on phone last night with the american.  a 6 minute conversation (because he was off to get drunk at the cottage as usual) in which, after i'd offered to meet him at the airport and he'd dismissed it completely as "i don't care" i answered his question about the hospital that my appointment had been pretty horrible and that yes i was going to have to have an operation to which his answer was "is it life-threatening?"....i said "um, no, i guess not life-threatning...", him: "oh well thats fine then!"; my answer of "um there is danger though, its actually prety bad - but i don't want to explain too much because i'll cry" might have concerned anyone else in the world.  not him.  "bye then!" - so that was great.  at least i got all the tears out last night.  thanks for that tim. I'm sorry for that rant.  trying to not to get depressed again and figure ranting might help.  so much bad stuff going on in my head.  i need to go home.

      Ok so the reason i haven't put anything up here, for, like,  over a week  (sharp intake of breath), is cos it has been (is) my last week in work, last week of normality in the diff in fact, cos after today its one day of madly getting all my stuff together, tidying, sending off many degree forms etc etc before going to london for sunday then monday meeting the american - and a last very abnormal week in the diff.  how exciting/bizarre/unsettling! said goodbye to the g weds night, that was very upsetting, but done now at least.  cos he's off to tokyo (wow) and won't be back until after i've gone.  oh dear.... but saw jen on tuesday, for first time since she's been back from travels, that was lovely, such cool photos.  she so healthy and happy. watched the england-portugal game last night (after working like a pack-horse all day) - so so so bloody exciting!! and obviously i don't have the massive depression afterwards that all the english have got (fair do's bloody bloody unlucky, already got a rant from steve!) but i did (eek) actually want them to win.. why do i get this with football never with any other sport.....? awful

      So the american did come over.  For 10 and a half days.  And it was wonderful.  And he was wonderful.  Damn it.  Damn it.  And now I’m in love damn it.  For sure.  And he says he loves me too.  And has talked of future farmland cats dogs horses cows maine.  Oh dear.  Did he  know  to say that?  Even the religion conversation went well.  Even him and ed got on.  He makes me really happy.  Even though it was one of the most stressful weeks ever for me in terms of outside practicalities (eg. leaving the city that has been my home for five years and moving me and my stuff across the country a few days after my ex’s parents had moved all my ex’s stuff into my old room, my ex’s new room) he was great about everything and still managed to make me glow with happiness a lot of the time.  Oh damn it.  Not really the best situation in the world to get into with someone on the other side of the world.  I don’t want to be in this boring town looking for a dead-end job for a few months.  I want to be with him.  I want to be over there.  No, I just want to be with him.  Oh dear.  This is all very unhealthily upsetting.  Especially more so as I doubt he’s got all these wild fantasies about not being able to be without me.  I have to not do this!  I have to remember that he won’t feel like this about me.  That side of stuff is so difficult I don’t know where to start.  So I’m not going to.  But man I want to do something romantic and foolish and stupid and wild and I want him to want to to and I want it to work!  But he only left yesterday so maybe this madness will fade. Week and a half of drinking dancing, lazing around wimbledon, kissing cuddling more, cooking a lot, happy.  Saturday recovered from coming home very sick from work leaving do.  Sunday to London, to barking, to jens, on a delayed national express cos missed the megabus.  Jens house nice, jonny there too, her mum great too.  Hardly slept of course then Monday morning tube from barking to heathrow set off 7.45, had to get off at Victoria cos sick with nervousness! Made it to arrivals in time.  Waited for half an hour terrified I’d missed him but then he was there.  So normal so soon.  He’d kissed me before we even got on megabus so anxiety dreams of past week were shot to tatters thank goodness.  Megabus an experience.  Not exactly the right environment for cuddles or sleep but it was only 3 hours and then we could cuddle and sleep to hearts desire, which we did, well actually I didn’t sleep, just wandered round the flat in a daze that he was actually here, while he slept and I stopped myself from waking him up.  K phoned then turned up, had to wake him up then.  We got the full gauntlet of her comments but survived together which was very satisfactory.  Later to p&wig to meet summers and N.  that was cool, relaxed and lovely.  And then I had my man to share my bed with and that was great every single night.  Tuesday afternoon to N’s new room (she in katies house now) and to Ks.  Then evening to thai restaurant all of us, nice place.  Weds night the best of all, to clwb.  So much dancing grinning laughing wonderful – me tim summers N katie and ryan, and the phrase “I don’t think we’ll get pregnant before 25” :)  Thursday to Bristol us 2 and N to meet B and B.  I was not wanting to go but it was fine.  Very hungover, café for lunch, shopping, back to their lush flat (couple’s domestic bliss) for goonies reading and a home-made Chinese meal before back on train to be home for half 9.  got some strongbow, won some money on scratchcards and watched American pie the wedding.  Funny! Friday stayed in bed most of the day it was great, evening to city arms and moloko, cool night, I had my first flounce but it all went good.  Drunk and happy.  Saturday day to george for lunch and then to summers’ house to sit til J and J arrived, then some more sitting.  That evening the cocktail party, the leaving cocktail party.  Was so on edge at the start but it all got good.  Some awkwardness with M of course but at least he came.  Tim wasted, I nearly sick, but such a good night mostly and we said I love you to eachother.  Dancing in wifes room was pretty cool too!  And tim was lovely, and we said I love you to eachother :) Sunday ed arrived lunchtime had already picked Nay up from station.  the boys were very quiet with eachother.  I was a little worried. Then ed and nay went off to hers. Me and tim carried on recovering, N arrived when she finished work, then us 3 wife katie j and j went to see shrek 2.  it was great , I loved puss in boots, and it made me laugh loads.  Then to bush pig to watch 2nd half of euro 2004 final, only ones interested me tim j and j but we wanted Greece to win and they did so that was good.  Then to p&wig for hour or so to meet up with ed and nay.  The men got on great this time which I was very relieved about.  Monday ed and nay came to pick us up early afternoon I made sandwiches and the 4 of us squished into the car to southerndown.  Sunny windy and chilly, lovely on the beach.  Rock pools anenomes barnacles tiny little crabs paddling climbing windswept.  Got back for tea and then it was off for my final night in diff.  got crying and foul mood and general awfulness in feeling and actions out of the way in the second hour, so by the time everyone else was upset as we all said goodbye, I was fine.  Ah well.  Tuesday got up so early to pack tim still in bed looking all cosy I had to be strong and do the boring stuff and not wake him up/go back to sleep!  In the end him and ed were both such a help it was just unbelievable don’t know what I’d do without them.  They helped that evening as well once everything back to home along with the 3 of us in the squishdest little polo ever.  tim got on with the folks fine, although didn’t see them for that long.  After tea we strolled to pub on river, had a pint each, finally had the religion conversation which was actually great and I think a relief for both of us.  And decided that we were in a ridiculous situation but what could we do except carry on cos we just wanted to be with eachother.  Rainman in bed til we fell asleep.  Wednesday – watched the end of rainman , lush omelette for breakfast (as usual this week) and then I showed him camb.  We only got as a nice walk on the river, trinity and clares (thanks to the magic little red card)  cos clares fellows garden was lovely and we sat/lay by the cam watching the punting for ages and ages which was great.  Bumped into ed outside kings (we were just too late) so went for a lush hot chocolate at indigo and then the 3 of us traipsed home in the rain.  Me and tim had a cuddle and watched start of goodfellas til ma and pa got back from work.  Sat with them for a while then went out for our only ever ‘date’/’romantic’ thing so far, for a meal at greek restaurant, varsity. But of course, because it is us, it poured with rain all the way, I mean  poured .  And we didn’t take a brolly.  Or order a cab.  Or take proper coats.  And I took us a very long way round.  Um, we got a taxi home!  But it was really nice, the food was good and it was just good.  Cos everything was. Ah fuckity.  Yesterday (thurs) was pretty bloody painful.  Very painful.  Took all day really to get to the airport, goodbye, waited til plane gone, back on tube and bus too.  Missed him like hell within an hour and still miss him like hell now.  Doesn’t feel right.

      to go or not to go? to go for cheaper on sat 11th sept or not to? to wait for my £500 bond to be back in my account before i buy or not? oh well....maine probably awaits mid-september for a few weeks. nursing probably doesnt await mid-september. due to financial issues regarding the lovely nhs grants dept. so i have a year free, to do something else. veering between feeling pretty good and excited about it and pretty damn pissed off that i can't just do what i'd decided. do wish everything could be as simple and good as california girls by the beach boys.  so i have been unemployed since i got back, went to sign on for first time today but should have been gettin dole since 15th at least and nothing yet. but have a job for a week starting next monday, as a receptionist out in fulbourne...thats something, even if it does take 50 minutes by bus to get there...  highlight since been here is goin into london a few fridays ago with ma to see the hopper exhibition at the tate. so so good. not much more to say than that, i'll just put on of the pieces they had on here to show how good it was cos my words won't do really.   was ill with virus thing for nearly two weeks from the last time wrote this, was almost like a sleeping sickness...  as you can tell from the uninterestingness of this blog there is nothing that is not boring to tell. of course i am loving pottering along, reading telly garden town sun chatting don't want to work next week. and don't miss cardiff at all. person i'm missing most is jenny and she's the one person who is not going to summers party this weekend. fair-do's being in hospital with a kidney infection (bless her) is a pretty good excuse but i'm still gutted we can't go together and that i myself haven't an excuse. the train fare makes me feel a little sick when thinking of it. oh there i go thinking about it again now i'm getting unpleasant feeling in my chest...the guilt of not going would destroy i think though! talking of cardiff it's all hell breaking loose there since i've gone: witness this paragraph stolen from an email to my love/my dolt of a bush-supporting tw*t of a boyfriend (depending on the day):   "summers is pulling ricky and also being a bitch (no-one knows why) to wife...who's very upset and confused by the whole thing...N has nearly fallen out with summers too cos she's being really weird about her birthday party and has invited the whole band except the obvious j but is refusing to invite our best friends from uni, jo anna steph etc. which has understandably upset N-cos ths is when we were supposed to be having a reunion with them this weekend anyway. weird and pretty bothersome. plus my turd of an ex seems to have taken a shine to N again and spending every minute possible with her which is making me a little sick cos you just do not DO THAT. plus tim r is clinically depressed, still in love with N and wants her back. but she's spending a lot of time with a certain A....K's being her normal self and stirring everything up plus has taken to telling me over and over again that from seeing me and you together its clear to her that i'm shit at relationships. ta for that. talking of which she's been acting very weird with me about her coming to see you in november......"  so all in all i'm kinda glad to be outta that.  pottering/receptioning will do for a while i think.....
