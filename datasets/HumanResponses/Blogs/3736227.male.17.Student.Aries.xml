      A Special World  A special world for you and me A special bond one cannot see It wraps us up in its cocoon And holds us fiercely in its womb  Its fingers spread like fine-spun gold Gently nestling us to the fold Like silken thread it holds us fast Bonds like this are meant to last  And though at times a thread may break A new one forms in its wake To bind us closer and keep us strong In a special world, where we belong.  -Kristen Godfrey  This poem was sent to me from Krissy and I just loved it so much, I felt everyone should share the smile it brought to my face:) thank you Krissy

         Ok, so I forgot to add this on to the last post. Oh well...           &nbsp;     I am hoping I don't forget this while I'm typing, that would just suck.        So, me, my sister Nicole, my dad, and my little sister Katie are walking in this old mansion, why? I have no clue. So we're walking and this old scrawny guy steps in front of us and tells us to come with him. So like dumbasses, we go with him, not knowing where we're going. So he takes us to this dried up underground stream that goes around this island, and tells us to stand in the middle of the island. Yup, you guessed it, we stood there. So he pulls this lever and tells us this one thing (forgot it's name) was really deadly and there was only one way from getting eaten. He wasn't going to tell us, just like the bad guy he is.&nbsp; So when this lever is completely down, this water looking stuff start pouring from this valve and with it, pops out this ugly green thing. It has a humungous head that seems to be made up of only it's teeth. From that spring this itty bitty tail. It's prolly about 8 foot long and is a sickly green color. So I'm worrying about that when this fat little thing jumps out of the tube and into the water. Suddenly, the water stops and these things start swimming around the island The guy tells us that, to escape, we must kill these things. I look at him like he's crazy, but of course, Nikki suddely jumps in the water. Now, the things start swimming faster and she's avoiding them with te grace of a figure skater. But the fat thing hits her side and the water start to turn murky red. MAN DOWN!!! So I jump in after her before the long skinny thing can get to her, but am almost too late. So I get her out of the water, and there is a fish caught in the pants. So i throw the fish back in the water towards the long thing, and it eats it! Of all the nerve to eat my insult. Thats not the worst of it...it turned around and pootered at me!!! I couldn't believe it. So anyway, Katie and I came up ith a great scheme to catch all the fish we could without getting eaten. The only problem...the fat thing didn't like fish. So it really was an insult to him. So we start climbing around like idiots looking for fish, when Katies shoe falls in the water. The little fat thing swam after it like it was pure gold. When it&nbsp; ate the shoe, it turned around and pootered at us.&nbsp; So we started collecting clothes. So we finally got everything and mananged to kill the fa thing...it rlly choked on the smell from Nikki's shoes. Now dad hasnt done anything except fiddle witha a stick this whole time. Finally, he walks to the edge and starts fishing! &nbsp;He caugfht the skinny thing tho. When it was out of the water, it's head started leaking ad then finaly it stopped moving. No the next part is basically like the first part, except imagine it all noen green. and we're in a boat, and there are fans around the corner. Yeah, kinda stupid. Then, there was a part of a dream that had nothing to do with green monsters and old guys. All I remember is stting in the bathtub with a laptop looking for something important. Don't think I ever found it.           &nbsp;     Well, thats all for now...ttyl           &nbsp;     *Hugs kisses and a little extra*

      Ok You know how when most people ask you how you are you say, ok? or fine? For me, it's usually 'eh'. The last two days have been hell...really. But you wanna know the fucked up part??? I get back from the hospital and I get a call from Ponderosa saying they want me to come in for a interview. Now how fucked up is that. Oh well Terry says I can call and we'll reschedule when Ifeel better, so I'm doing that today. I mean, my throat still hurts and I have a slight headache, but nothing is perfect, and I really need the job. I told Bri that if&nbsp; didn't feel any better than yesterday, I wouodn't go, but everyone is getting sick, and he can't afford it. At least if I have a job,&nbsp;I can back up what he loses. I" already giving him $36 for the money he lost when he came to the hospital in the middle of his shift. I'm just hoping Ponderosa pays well:) Gotta go shopping...anyway, my eyes are starting to bug out from looking at this stupid screen, so I'll see ya'll later:) *hugs kisses and a little extra*  V

      Ok, first, Jayna, you made a good comment, and point. I do need to get closer to my friends and live a little, but if you had my history, you'd stay away enough to not get hurt. I really do love all my friends, but sometimes I worry that they will turn on me, or i them. I don't want this to happen.   Anyway, Brian and I cuddled for like a half hour, and it was gret...it was naked...lol. I loved it...  Joel has agreed to pay me $50 for cleaning the floors of the other house. I am so happy. And tommorow, I am going to start on the other one. I might stop and do the rest on thursdya, just to make him think it's harder, that way, I can get more money:) j/k.&nbsp; Joel is smart and knows how much something is worth. Thats one reason why I like him. He is good for my mom.   Sara and I have been talking lately, and no matter how many times I tell her Nick is good for her, she still is amazed, because I never liked nick before. It's not that I didn't like hiim, but I am very protective of sara. I don't want her to end up with the wrong guy, and get burt. I did that before to her, and I was wrong.  But, I am going to go to bed...ttyl  &nbsp;

       Ok, so I haven't written in like forever. So sue me. I have had a lot going on, besides I lost my password:) lol...i am such a dork. Anyway, with Annie now out of y life forever, I guess, things have changed. I no longer spend time looking for her, and very rarely think about her. I trynot o cause it hurts so much. I have been spending a lot of time with Brian as usual, but someone new has come into my life. A new friend: Alan. He is a nice guy, and I find it hard to completely connect with him, for fear that he will one day be taken from me. I guess it is the same with all my friends...I get close enough to them where I know them, but stay far away enough to know that if we ever fight, they die, or move away, or we just drift apart, I know that I will not get completely bent out of shape. Sorry guys, but that's reality. Alan, Brian, and I are spending a lot of time together, adn it's great. Last night, we stayed at his house and watched Tank Girl. One of Brian's favorites. I remember the first time we watched it, we laid on the couch, and he held me almost the entire time:) That was great. So now, I am sitting on the computer, searching for the right words. It is hard to put into words how I feel right now. My mind is all jumbled and I can't find the path I need to stay on. Hopefully, mom won't go to Kent on Saturday and Brian and I can spend some time at the lake or something before we go see Alan at work. Arabica has become like a second home to me. It's quiet, there are friends, and I can spend time with Brian and Alan. Those two have become almost my whole life. Brian more than Alan, but even though I haven't known Alan quite as long, I feel a certain kinship to him. However, we couldn't be more different. Anyone who knows me, knows that I am a little preppy. Alan is not. But it's nice to talk to him, and we connect on a lot of different levels. Our time will be cut short though, when his bf -to-be comes back from Michigan. There will be a drastic change, because I don't know how Calvin will take to Alan hanging out with me and Bri so much. Go figure, however I have told many people this..."I am not going to do what he wants e to do. If I want to hang out with you, then I will. The only way I'll back off, is if you tell me to." Sara, you know this. Anyway, let's hope that Alan feels the same way on that, or our friendship is doomed to end at an early stage. Well, everything is going alright with me and Brian. I have decided to start taking my lexapro again, just because I am getting progressivly snappier, and don't want to hurt Bri one of these times. I guess I am going to go for now...    &nbsp;  Brian I love you so much    &nbsp;  Valandil
