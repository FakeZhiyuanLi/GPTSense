       Song Currently Playing: Drive (Incubus)      How fucking ironic is that?  Not planned at all, but so so appropriate because that is exactly what I get to do freely now and forever!!      Song Currently Playing: Gettin Jiggy Wit It (Will Smith)      Again ironic cause that is exactly what I am doing right now...havent been this happy in awhile.  Never in my life have I been a fan of or had any respect for the judicial system or the law enforcement community of this country until today.  Today I received a letter in the mail stating that i had won my appeal to having my drivers licsence suspended.  I was supposed to have it suspened for 3 months and then be on probation for a year.  Well, all charges have been dropped with the condition that I take a driver improvement course. Now they are sending me the info on that, so I dont know the details, but hell anything is better than what I was facing.      I am so greatful for this I almost started crying, fuck I did cry when I got the notice of suspension.  This whole experience has definately changed my attitude when it comes to driving.  I used to think I was so invincible, like no matter how many times I got caught nothing ever happened besides shelling out a larger amount of cash each time. Well, just the thought of a year and a half of restricted driving privilages caused me to never wanna leave the right lane ever again.        How appropriate the music has been today cause I was praying write before I opened the letter and then sang praises after I read it...and now I leave you listening to Lifehouse's "Everything".      OUT

       Song Currently Playing: Open Arms (Journey)      I dont care what any guy says, they like this song.  Steve Perry has got the voice to get any guy laid if he decidicates this shit to his girl.      Song Currently Playing: Now and Forever (Ricahrd Marx)      Holy shit, that's another amazing one...best love song ever...my dream is to sing it at my wedding one day.  Why I am listening to the "love songs" station at 7 in the morning I dont know...maybe its cause I am rediculously in love with my girlfriend and she is all I can think about at the moment...I dunno....      So even though school has started for me already, it starts for the rest of GU on the 30th and people will start coming back in town monday and all next week.  From what I heard tarwater is already here and the nuge should be here monday or tuesday.  Cant wait to get some music going again.  We've got 2 shows to get ready for.  I am actually excited for launius, quincy, rollie, and grant to get back cause they are all guys that used to party with lyd and the solah girls and they will shit when they find out that me and lyd are together.  I really wanna see what kind of freshman recruits we have repin' closson this year.  There is a fuckin lot of them.  With like 10 guys graduating and like 10 more moving off the hall, the hall is now like 2/3 freshman so we will have to train them well.  Closson forever, orion sucks dick, cheville likes to watch while fingering their asses.....      AND i am OUT!!

       Song Currently Playing: Sweet Child O' Mine (Guns N' Roses)  My all-time favorite rock band. So much so that I have a tribute to Slash tattooed on my left shoulder and a video/cd collection that would put any collector to shame. Never did get to see them live in person, but back in june was blessed to see the 4th ever Velvet Revolver show from the front row. For those of you living in a cave, VR has slash, duff, and matt from GNR scott weiland from STP and some guy named dave. Most amazing rock show ever...I still dont believe it actually happened, but boy howdy do I have pictures to prove it.  So...as I look into the eyes of my girlfriend and hold her in my arms, I can not believe that her last boyfriend could have possibly beat her on a regular basis. I would probably never beleive it if it hadnt in fact happened earlier this week. I felt so fucking helpless when she showed up at my door in hysteria. I could have killed that fucker I was so enraged. But the reality sets in that I am a 6 foot 140 pound musician and he is a steriod-laced athlete...so the outcome would be obvious...so therefore we did nothing, but god dammit to hell did I want to.  I just can not understand what can drive a man to physically and mentally tear apart something so precious an innocent. Its fuckers like that that should be owtlawed from having children. The fact that they hate themselves so much and can not seem to figure out what the fuck is wrong with them, so they take it out on their girlfriend, or mom, or daughter and just expect them to forgive and forget...well fuck that jack. Some of them fight back...thats my girl buddy. You've forced her to be a non-trusting insecure as shit person when it comes to dating and now I have to prove to her that you are the fucked up one and she is the normal one. But, I will do everything in my power to do that, because unlike you, she is more than just a fuck to me you fucking asshole...she is my world, my one source of happiness and inspiration, and I swear to god if I even see you looking her way I am likely to go apeshit on you...no matter how broken and bruised I end up in the end.  Song Currently Playing: Push (Matchbox Twenty)  Hmmmm.......how fucking ironic.       I'm out...............   KEvin

       So...Maybe I am just totally freaking out and reading into things too much. Or maybe in a way it is wishful thinking. But, for the past 2 months I dont think I have ever seen this girl pee and now she is going every hour on the hour and complains of swollen ankles and headaches. Now...she has been pulling double shifts all week so that could be a huge part of it. But, to be quite honest, we have done the deed at least 4-5 times a week for the past 2 months with no form of protection what so ever. But we talked about it, and although it wouldnt be the best timing, it is definately something that we have both wanted forever and would definately feel blessed and honored to have this new being in the world. This new being created by God from our best and worst traits...a little lyd/kevin person....damn that would be so awesome. But, on the other hand, I would feel like such a jerk if it went down before this time next year. But, oh well, its in Gods Hands.  Leavin you to think about this while listen to the religious bad boys from Virgina...DC Talk (Jesus Freak)  Later

       Song Currently Playing: Alright (Hootie &amp; The Blowfish)      Hidden Track on their cd HBF...kinda pisses me off that its a hidden track cause its probably the 2nd best song on the cd and alot of people don't even know about it.      Anyway...I had emailed a friend some thoughts on love today and I thought I would share them with the world. For in my 27 years of life I think there are some things that I have finally learned and find valuable enough to share with the world....      I think it really comes down to this...no one is perfect. We all have faults. We all have little quirks that drive our girlfriend or boyfriend crazy after awhile. And you are gonna disagree and you are gonna have fights and its not always gonna be flowers and candy. But when it comes down to it, the person that you end up with forever is going to be a person that you desire to argue with. I know that sounds stupid, but hear me out. It just means that you would rather fight with this person from time to time and butt heads than not be with them at all. Its not about the guy you can live with happily ever after, its about the guy you cant live another minute without. So he was selfish and couldnt put his own thing aside long enough to get strawberries. Do you have the right to be upset? Yes. Do you have justification to be upset? Maybe. But, what if during that argument, he walked out the door and never came back? Could you go on and find a new guy or would your life truley be over. THAT is how you know. When you find the guy that will kill you forever if he walked out the door without you to never returned....that is when you know that is the one for you for all times.      OuT,   Kevin      ps...go on kazza or your favorite music download site and download "Haven't Seen For A While" by the Pat McGee Band. THAT is a song of true love.

       Song Currently Playing: Lose Yourself (Eminem)      Love Em...every word of every song of every album, whether solo or with D12, is so freaking open and real, no matter how embarresing...I dig that so much.  Dude lays his life on the line with every new song...thats balls man.      Why is it that freak boy Mike Phillips can have 4 fucking jobs in this town and I can't find ONE in Des Moines?  Maybe its because I expect a little more....no wait...ALOT more than $5.15 an hour....what a fucking joke.      Song currently Playing: Echo (Trapt)      WOOOOOO!!!  Great band...seen them twice, once at a festival, once from the front row opening for Nickleback.  Tell you what, jump in the pit during Headstrong and you wont have to work out for about another week.  Sweaty rock is fun rock!!      Well...I'm off to hunt down some more jobs people....I shall leave you with the 5 genious's of rock known as Aerosmith (Crazy)..."you turn it on, then you're gone.  You drive me...."      LaTeR Ya'Ll

       My Current Playlist:      Back Home-Yellowcard   Fade Into You(Live)-Flickerstick   Amber-311   Mrs. Jackson(Live)-Soapbox   Passenger Seat-Death Cab For Cutie   Smile(Live)-Flickerstick   Summer is Over-7Mary3   Only One-Yellowcard   Radio Tokyo-Marvelous 3      These are my current favorites.  You should check them all out.  You probably wont be able to find the soapbox song unless you know one of the guys in the band.  I wonder how you could find one......hmmmm?  Anyway...I am a sucker for a good rock jam with a slow flow and just spine chilling vocals...these all possess that indeed.  Just noticed that there are quite a few bands with the number 3 in their name.      Anyway, enjoy the music...find something you like pass it along.  Music is the universal language....use it wisely.      im OUT!!

       Its been too long since me and beer hung out.  Tonight seems like as good a time as any.      Song Currently Playing: Round Here (Counting Crows)      Ya'll know my feelings about Mr. Duritz of CC...fucking genious...the most hauntingly beautiful voice you will ever hear.      Why is it that money is the root of all evil and yet is so desired, so craved by some for the nessessities of life?      I've been bored out of my scull this weekend.  Lyd went out of town with her family to a fair in sydney Iowa for the weekend.  Its a family tradition to go this weekend every year.  They all wanted me to go, and I wanted to go very much so.  But, I could not get off work.  There is always next year.  So, I sit and drink with justice (our kitten) and wait...wait for my new source of all that is positive and good to come home.      Song Currently Playing: Lets Get It Started (Black Eyed Peas)      Such a fucking cool song to cruise to.  Put the windows down and crank that sucka to 11 and just jam!        So...never in my life have I ever had the desire to live with another person until now.  I mean that year I lived with Nuge was awesome.  He was the best roomate I ever had.  But I still would have rather lived by myself.  But now I crave it...I fiend for it...I am busting my ass to try and get back in the 9-5 job world for quite a few reasons...and one of them is so that I can pursue the posibility of getting a house with Lyd.  I know my parents would rather we be married before we live together, but its gonna be sometime in mid-late 2005 before I will even be able to afford the type of ring she deserves.  I've asked her like 10 times to just hit the courthouse with me.  But she wants the real deal and she definately deserves it, so she shall have it.      Song Currently Playing: Just Like You (Three Days Grace)      Saw them live...opening for Nickelback and Trapt.  They are fun live...only 2 or 3 good songs on the disc though...dont expect another.      Life is crazy ya know...never stop pursuing your dreams, but dont be afraid to take a chance at some extreemly left field opportunities that God may throw your way.  I mean sure...the dream had always been to move to nashville and pursue my music hardcore after graduating.      Song Currently Playing: Trouble (Coldplay)      The only Coldplay song I like...but what a fucking great song...that piano lick just kills me everytime.      ok...so back to the pursuit of dreams...if I get to nashville at all, it will be years later than predicted.  But that is ok beacause Nashville will always be there.  How often is it that I am with a girl that is freaking crazy go nuts about me and my music and my family and wants to get her masters and have kids and live on the water?!?  Its been a long long long time since I have a girl with a nicer car, a nicer apartment, and more class and confidence than me.  And her ass in those cheerleader shorts....good golly miss molly!!  I thought I had lost my chance at that type of woman...I am not about to let this one go....      I leave you tonight with the genious lyrics of one of my absolute favorite song writers...Mr. Stephen Jenkins of the very underated Third Eye Blind (Crystal Baller).  Listen...listen hard...you may just hear the meaning of your life.....      AnD Im OuT!

       Song Currently Playing: Never Say Goodbye (Bon Jovi)      Jon Bon Jovi &amp; Richie Sambora...would life be the same without these Jersey cohorts? Not a chance. I Love anything by JBJ and the boys...especially a sappy ass ballad such as this.      I finished a song today that I have been working on for months. That is always a refreshing feeling. Its nice to feel like the issues that inspired it can now be put to rest. I shall take it to the studio tomorrow and start working out the kinks. It's called "Together Forever" but it does not have a happy ending. Its not nessessarily a sad ending either. Its just a truthful ending. Thats always the best way to go I think....      Still dealing with the fucker that hacked into my checking acount. If I ever find him, I will hack my fist up his pee-hole. Ouch is right buddy!!      Song Currently Playing: My Hope Is You (Third Day)      Amazing Christian rock band from Georgia lead by a left handed bearded fella that everyone says tries to sound like Darius Rucker. I can kinda hear it, but he aint trying hard enough cause he dont even come close. Great band though.      ok...so now I feel like a cock and must appologize to mr (or mrs) hacker. We all make mistakes. Just stop please cause its mean. Thank you.      Well, I guess there is not much to say today, so I will leave you while listening to the genious that is Aerosmith (Love in an Elevator).      Going Down!!!

       Song Currently Playing:  Crutch (Matchbox Twenty)      For those who didn't think it was possible for matchbox to play pissed off music, listen to crutch...exactly my feelings at the  moment!!      Song Currently Playing: This Love (Maroon 5)      GRRRRRRRR!!!!  Ok, I was gonna bitch about something else first, but this song has got me going Full throttle now.  SO, how is that one day you are dating the hottest, coolest girl in the existance of all girls, and the next day she is living in england dating a fake ass abusive piece of shit? And the only reason you know about the guy is because you are going to visit her and she tells you not to, and then proceeds to tell you why.  And why is it in the years that follow she goes on a fullfledged fucking european vacation with her family and my family, including my brother but I am not invited?  And then, in some fucked up twist of fate, the best friend of my drummer ends up at her place for 2 weeks cause of some church reunion thing.  How amazingly fucked up is all this?!?!?  I just want to see this girl again before I die.  Is that too much to ask?  Why is everyone else so privilged to see her?  Or maybe I should ask, why am I being punished?      Song Currently Playing: Smile (Flickerstick)      How was there life before Flickerstick?  I do not know...everytime I hear that voice backed by such a fucking powerhouse of texas rock I get chills...long live the weirdness that is flickerstick...      ok...so back to the other thing I was gonna bitch about...if you break up with a girl after dating for 2 years of course it is gonna take time to heal, but there is no need for the mother of the girl to go around talking shit about you and your entire family for months afterwords simply because she was banking on a normal fucking civilized family to take her daughter away from the shithole life that she tries (and fails) to provide for her daughter.  Its over lady...get over it...if you are so bored that you have nothing better to do than talk shit about shit that is completely over and dead, than pick up a hobby....like fucking exercising...stupid ass fucking jerk.  Sorry for that kids....that lady has just got to learn when to fucking let shit alone...or I might be forced to show her myself.      Song currently Playing: Mrs. Jackson (Soapbox)      What a cool fucking band soapbox is...did anyone hear how much harder they rocked at spec over unbound?  Who plays 6 songs and then asks kids to buy a 12 disc cd?  If you can't pull a 3 hour set, hootie or soapbox style, then dont try to step on our turf....nuff said.      Anyway, on a very exciting note, in 14 hours I will be pulling the suit out of the mothballs and trecking to downtown des moines to a job agency to see about getting myself back in the 9-5 workforce.  I have officially decided to finish out the rest of my BA at night classes and I should still be done by august of next year, if I go year round and start next week.  Very excited!!!  Now I just gotta pray about the drivers liscence situation....and ya'll can too.      So to anyone that actually takes the time to read my daily tirades....I love all ya'll and would love to hear what is going on with you.      I will close this while listening to the genious that is yellowcard (Cigarette)...props for making the fiddle cool again boys!!!      OUT & ABOUT!!!

       Song Currently Playing: Bent (Matchbox Twenty)      Gotta love the matchbox...Rob Thomas writes songs in mere minutes that I have been trying to write my whole life.      Thought the money issue was resolved...never start cheering too soon...will leave you looking like the jerk.  So....does anyone know how long it will take silver permanant marker to come off my chest?  Just a random thought.      Song Currently Playing: Mr. Jones (Counting Crows)      Adam Duritz...another F'ing amazing song writer...catch them live if you can.  You will see a true artist living out his emotions to the fullest on stage.      Song Currently Playing: Take Me Away (Lifehouse)      Honestly, I only like about 3 or 4 of their songs, but this is one that still gives me chills everytime.  And to see them live on my home turf at GU with all my GU buddies...what a night back in Aug of 2003.  I looked in a girls eyes that night and new for a fact I would kiss her one day.  Mission accomplished.  I fear I have broken her heart and trust beyond repair.  Sorry Varv...you know we are still both learning and growing...maybe one day.......      These next 4 weeks are gonna be pretty shaky, pretty up in the air, but they have a huge impact on where I go and what I do for the next 1,5,10,50 years.  For real yo, this aint no chump change shit...this is some serious decision making going down.  Time to get on my knees everynight and pray.  You can do it too if you'd like.      Song Currently Playing: Let It Be (The Beatles)      Man I really need to get back to working on my CD.  I did some work for music project, singing and playing a little percusion, that my parents were working on and then I just got in this funk where I didnt feel like doing my stuff.  But also it might have something to do with the fact that I am no longer on a deadline since I am no longer going to Nashville for winter term.  More on that as I know more I guess...      So here is a random question for discussion...what do you do if weekly you are having dreams about a girl you know and think is hot but anyone you tell about these dreams gets this look on their face like they are gonna barf?  Plus you are in a serious relationship.....hmmmm...the perils of life arise again....    I guess that's enough babling for now....leaving you while listening to the genious that is Sister Hazel (your mistake)........      I'm OUT.....

       Song on at the moment: My Sacrafice (Creed)      Speeking of Creed...Don't bother with Alter Bridge, ya know creed without stap?  The new guy sounds like a bad ripoff of the guy from lifehouse...not a good sound.    So...Why is it that people have nothing better to do with their time than to hack into your computers and bank acounts and steal thousands of dollars from you that you dont even have?  Why is it that the government is so lazy that it takes them 6 months to even begin the paper trail of punishing you for something you did 6 months ago?  Why are people in the midwest so deathly afraid of same-sex marriage?  Why is it that people waste their time buying all your shit off ebay if they are never going to pay for it?      Song on at the moment: Lightning Crashes (LiVe)      Why is it that each live cd gets weirder and weirder?  They are amazing song writers and Ed's got a hauntingly beautiful voice, but...that last cd was just a waste of their time.  Their 2nd release Throwing Copper is still their best and one of the best cd's ever.      Anyway...gotta hit the showers and start a predicted to be shitty day...but things will get better...they cant get much worse.      I'm Out....
