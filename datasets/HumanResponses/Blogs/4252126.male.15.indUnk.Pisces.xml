      I've decided i'm just going to write the dates for the titles on each entry now. today was ordinary at work.. my sexy muffin carrie ; - ) and me are going to home coming.. most likley with a group of friends but still. Look at all this!!! i got bored and found em.      My inner child is ten years old!   The adult world is pretty irrelevant to me. Whether I'm off on my bicycle (or pony) exploring, lost in a good book, or giggling with my best friend, I live in a world apart, one full of adventure and wonder and other stuff adults don't understand.   urlLink  How Old is Your Inner Child?    brought to you by Quizilla   ok i'm done with that.. that was fun. haha... so i went to one of the station casinos today with ceci.. we just kinda walked around and talked about stupid stuff.. ok a lot about how her ex is a wangster and a wigger.. hes like.. white.. hahaha. ah good times good times.. i really hate him at the moment.. we had a joke for like a week where he'd call me gay and i'd call him a irish whore..( he has a bad backround.. i'll give u a hint.. hes a whore) ya well he took it like way too far.. i seriously think hes means it now cauz all i hear out of him when he talks to me is gay.  " hi"  "hi frank  "sup"  (blah blah blah)  " ya well i dont go in hot topic frank.."  "well i do and i dont belong there.."  "well thats cauz ur gay..."   oh well.. but ya.. thats all that really happened 2 night.. i might post a little more later.. but thats it for now.. no.. wait.. oh ya theres nothing else... bye!!

      today was great! i went to work like usual.. thats nothing new, but after was great. I relaxed for a hr or 2 the kristin came to pick me up.. her sister was driving us and sense none of us have been out of the house in the past week, we decided that we'll just drive around. so we're driving and once we realized what we were doing, we were in north town... i tell u.. that place is scary.. but its funny to see who stares at you when you blasting work it and pass that dutch from missy elliot. haha good times good times. so we had to rush back to her house for numerous reasons.. they go as followed.. i realized i was still grounded.. hell i dont even know if i should be keeping a journal cauz i might get in trouble.. but n e ways.. i was still grounded.. we were missing south park and a awesomely new episode of reno 911 ( it was hilarious) and we wanted cookies.. mmmmmm cookies... so i come home after those were done and i sit and watch bourne identity cause it was the only thing on. when my sister gets home she had a huge bag of taco bell.. i was like .. ur god.. but then 3 of her friends walked in after her so i was like u a$$clown. but the best part of the day.. my brother was actually in a good mood (that usually never happens and for those people who actually know how i am with my family, u no me and him r always at eachothers throught.) and we were just going at it (wrestling) it was fun until i tripped while going at him and slammed my face into the tile.. it was soooo funny.  And now some kristin phrases-- Butt-lick A$$clown motard guido greasy guid lesbo uncle f*cker etc. .... god those r good.. hehe  i just realized they change words in my entrys to links to different sites... those jerks... LEAVE MY THING ALONE!!! hmmm i'm bored.... lets count sheep.. 1..2..3..4..5..6... ZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZz......

      and frank wins the pot of 1 million yen! wait.. if i'm not mistaken.. thats like 5 dollars or something... lol.. n e ways.. tonight, all i did was play texas hold'em with my sister, her boyfriend, and her best friend. it was bad because right in the middle of it, i realized i shouldn't of had this one type of ice cream at work today.. its non-fat and non-sugar, so its sweetened with splenda.. was surprisingly good.. n e ways! but it gave umm the runs.. ya... so i had to run to my room.. and i'm serious that i'm about to explode.. so i run into my bathroom and it happens that someone was just in my bathroom and they clogged it so i had to run across the house to my parents room and i just make it.. crap brb.. its comming again. dang.. that didnt not feel good.. but n e ways back to the story.. i let out this huge fart and i swear that like people on jupiter could hear it.. it was funny. I just saw the resident evil commercial.. the apocolypce one.. it looks sooo good.. i will be going to the midnight showing for that. ok well i have to go have something for dinner.. late!

      last night was one very confusing night. i take it every one reading this has seen kill bill volumes 1 and 2? ya well i saw them both last night. besides Chiaki Kuriyama( sooooo awesome!)( aka Gogo who is Lucy Liu's bodyguard in this movie series), every thing about this movie series was kind of boring. i seriously don't know what people see in these movies to say they are so good. just a fyi... chiaki also played in a movie called "Battle Royal." Its banned in the US but i've seen it and its awesome. AnYhOw! today was a ordinary day at work.. except for the fact of two guys were in the lobby sitting area place making out... i found it hilarious. this girl named alyssa at work today was telling us about her ex boyfriend.. they broke up and they were friends.. then she found out he dumped her for another girl from work. but what made it worst of all is that when that girl said no.. he tried to go back to alyssa. i couldnt stop laughing cauz not only did she tell him she doesn't like sloppy seconds (haha), but she also cursed him out. haha good times good times. I'm kinda sad. my friend kristin is mad at me.. i believe its because i dont call back when i say i will and that i laugh at half the stuff she says.. its kinda of bad.. i should check my email to see what she says because shes going to tell me whats going on through a email.. i dont even no if she'll answer my calls.*tear* I'm sorry kristin.. i love you.. wait.. u dont even no about this journal yet.. i'll give it to you right now!! ok .. until later! bye!

       whats up every one. my name is frank. this is my first online journal so stick with me. if you know me in real life you should be able to realize what i am talking about and be able to follow me along. and hopefully it will be funny. and for those of you who i dont knho.. i'll try to explain along the way. Anyways! nothing really happened today. it was kinda boring. the only really interesti ng things were this blog and my friend g.... ok she'd kill me if i said her name... i'll refer to her as .. boonifa! n e ways.. she was on the phone with me and she made me msg her boyfriend type figure.. so i msged him. it was funny because he wouldnt answer me until i told him to call her cauz she wanted phone s*x... if was funny... so i get off and i start talking to my friend ceci.. whe're talking and boonifa calls in. so i thought they just talked. next thing i knew.. she was telling me how she was walking around her house and she felt good.. so of course i'm like why.. and she trys to explain how she had done the phone thing with him. ok not really that funny but it works. at least i had a story unlike a lot of people who just write hi or something like that.  will fill in for the rest of the day later.. bye
