      From my understanding, a Ratigator is a genetic mistake on the part of man-made Scientists.  The creature (I thought) first appeared as a cute, furry-like pet on the original Mario Brothers television show that'd aired back in the late 80's/early 90's.  That's where I'd generally gotten the idea!  However, APE Games then released their renderred version of the Ratigator in it's popular video game, Dark Horizon (which I'd never played or even heard of 'til recently!).  It's during a search on the Ratigator that I'd found this info out, & located what I thought was the proper illustration for such a creature!  Being half sewer Rat/half Alligator could give such a creature great power & abilities, no doubt!  It just so happens, unfortunately, that the Ratigator's merely an icon of entertainment.  But that hasn't stopped me from taking interest in it!    I took interest in the Ratigator not because of it's nature, but because of the idea behind it.  Everyone knows the reputation behind both the Rat & the Alligator, it wouldn't be hard to strike someone's awe with a nick-name like Ratigator.  lol, some say it sounds like "refrigerator", which is true!  But the Rat & the Alligator, as I've said, are known for their reputation &amp; their startling differences.  This is why I'd given myself such a name.  Being different isn't always easy, as I could simply tell you in any conversation.  But being different is an idea that sits in the backs of people's minds for the rest of their lives.  You could know someone so different than yourself yet not even think of them until something reminds you, it's that impact on people I look to make.  This is my reasoning behind calling myself The Ratigator...

      Since it's nearly 2am Central Standard Time, I'll try to make this short.  I've been skimming over Blogger.com for awhile now, trying to figure out it's features & whatnot.  I think I've finally figured the basics, here, so I'm finally down to making my first blog post.  This blog thing's different for me, it's not like your typical webpage where you'd simply tell people alittle about yourself.  In fact it might be kinda hard for me to get used to having a blog (lol, I've never even kept a journal!).  But as I've said, it's nearly 2am here & I need some sleep...so I'll get more serious with my blogging at a later date.  Until then, just try to enjoy my profile efforts & maybe post a comment or two to give me something to blog about, okay?  Thanks &amp; welcome to my blog!
