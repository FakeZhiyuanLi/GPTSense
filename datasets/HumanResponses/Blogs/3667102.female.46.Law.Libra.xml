      Well, yesterday was a bust as far as the points go.  I didn't even keep track of them, and I am sure I was a little over.  However, I did not snack at all.  Went to the pool with Liz after work and actually mananged to do 6 laps.  Not one right after the other mind you, but, I did 6.  :)   I will stick with the 6 laps for now, and try to decrease the amount of time between them.  Once I have done that I will add two more laps.

      Well, here we are, it is Fathers Day.  A little depressing for me, but, the nice thing is that Liz gave me a little cash to take Gary out to dinner for celebrating both Father's and Mother's day.  Tomorrow I am beginning WWatchers again.  I think I have plenty of wise choices on hand, and I hope to get our pool passes tomorrow during lunch.  I have also started de-cluttering the house.  I decided that just because DH doesn't care about living in a pig stye, does not mean that I have to.  I will de-clutter and clean MY HALF of the rooms as I do them.  Lets see if that gets him moving.

      Hopefully this will be a restfull weekend.  So far, so good.  Found out today that Michael made All-stars, so, he and Gary will have practice everyday this week.  This will actually make it a little easier for me to regulate food etc.  On the food issue.  WWatchers will start on Monday, and I will be off to the store in a little bit to stock up on some things.  Although, I must say, that is the beauty of WWatchers, NOTHING is out of bounds as long as it fits into the points range.  I will however be limiting refined carbs, so, I will need to be sure to get plenty of whole grain bread options for lunches etc. I will be posting my previous days food log each morning.  I am hoping that this will help a little with the accountablility.

      Well, I was going to start this out as a log for my weight loss journey.  I guess that will still be my focus, but, I do plan to use this for other events in my life as well.  Daniel, my older son, just Graduated High School on Tuesday, what a tough time it is going to be, letting him go.  I NEVER thought watching one of my kids leave home to go to school would be so difficult. Oh well, life will go on, without as much humor as before, since Dan is our resident comedian.   Weight Watchers is the name of the game from this point on.  I am really not a fan of flex points, but, I REALLY need to get off this medication I am on.  The only way I will be able to accomplish this is to loose, loose, loose.  I plan on going to get our pool passes tomorrow, so no more excuses about exercise either.
