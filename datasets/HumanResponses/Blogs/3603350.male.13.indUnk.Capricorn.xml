       ::Sigh::  Aspire for a dream one at a time, Patrick. So, yeah...let's see...we could meet on that chat.armkids.com place. Or AIM. I prefer AIM because a lot of times the armchat will freeze. So... How about tomorrow (June 22) at 4:00?   And have you talked to Alex about his element? There're now 5 elements he can choose from: 1)Water 2)Lightning 3)Space 4)Metal 5) Earth  Muahaha... but you probably wouldn't want me to tell you other things about the elements...at least...yet... ::Evil cackle:: You can't paint the red door black...  Uh? Alter egos? Hehe. That was mine.   Have you heard of an Operating system (OS) that has an acronym that spells LAME? It's quite funny. My sister was online searching for stuff on Google and found that interesting tidbit. ...Sorry if I inconvenienced anyone with that information. I'll just sit in my corner and draw some more pretty pictures...

      i dunno just call me or something and we'll have a meeting. we can do it on aim or that one place... umm... what is is, like arm chat or something? i dunno just tell me the name of the site and yeah.... damnit nick and theron were right, those girls stole our pop. and they were beezatches [me and theron's word]. and they weren't really that hot. the tennis camp girls were much better... we were allowed to party with them in the lounge. *wink wink* umm... i think that there should just be wind cuz i was really bored and i just watched some enviromental shit show that was animated and there was some blue guy. there's no air. there's only wind. so i'm gonna stand by that reasoning. post me back .

      Wee. Now I may as well be considered bald. lol. New haircut.  Patrick, when do you guys go to the computers? What hours? I want to organize a meeting, if you guys can take time from your busy schedule to do so. And trying to party with the girls by offering them Mountain Dew.

       At least it sounds like you and Alex are having fun. Me? Mom's gonna sign me up for a drama camp. Sucks ass. But at least I don't have to go to the church camp *shudders*   That water looks pretty holy to me...*screams*  Metal, earth, or wood? your choice. Of course, the other five have been registered already in my one group. ...Making another group...?  Metal, earth, wood, air, water, lightning, or space. I'm keeping my flame.  Muahaha.  And, also, how the hell are you posting? Do you have a computer in your dorm or something? That would be sweet if you did...

      alrighty, i'm at peaks and takin all my classes now. there's this one girl who likes alex. i opened her panti droor (sp?)for alex to look in. her room mate shut it really fast and told the girl (katt [annamarie]). and i'm proud to tell you that she tried to kick me in the balls (avoided by a swift move of the legs) and then i recieved a slap in the face. it's so funny how when if you really piss a girl off,they slap you and expect it to hurt. but katie will shinkick you... btw katie, where were you last night?

       ::Sigh:: I think we're all going through that stage right now. And hot damn, how I'd love to kill it. Too bad it can't be shot in the face with a .45. Gibbies!  Much fun at camp. Heh heh. Fun. Right. Yech. It was based around the 50s, and so was our ending performance. The only thing that was fun was stealing from--wait, that reminds me. The only thing that was fun was taking a sip of the wine that the counselors supposedly "hid" on top of the fridge. And yes, Pinio Grigio is kinda nasty.  Argh. I can't seem to get into Elfwood...you have to pass a test to get in... Elfwood is where you can post stories (like fanfiction, only more formal) and pictures alike. It WOULD be fun...the bastards.
