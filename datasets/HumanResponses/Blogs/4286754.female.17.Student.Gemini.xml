         We ordered Chinese food tonight and I got that lovely message you see above. Could it be that my love life will suddenly improve? Or will the cookie prove to be a gimmick and nothing more? Only time will tell... >.>  ~Virginia

      I went to Jareds tonight. Hoping to sit and have a good time kickin' it with him and Scot. Turns out Allison was there. o.O  Allison and Scot...they are hard to explain. I was there when Scot first met Allison...sparks didn't fly, they didn't really talk  ALL  that much...but apparently it was enough for Allison to say to Jared that she wanted Scot.  I didn't like the sound of that because I know men. Most of them won't refuse a girl who just throws herself at them. Anyways, apparently thats what she did cause a while back she and him made out one night. And now Allison, I guess, is really taken with Scot and wants to hang with him, so she showed up there and started watching a movie.  It doesn't really make me mad or jealous...why should it? but it just sort of disappointed me. I thought that I had finally found a decent guy who was smart enough not to want to do shit like that. But at the same time, I would do something like that with him if given the chance. But the difference is that I've known Scot for a week and a half (yes, I know thats not very long), and in the spand of time I've had a lot of time to talk with him. Like for example, the first night I met him he came over with Jared at about 1:00 am to watch Hidalgo at my place. Jared promptly fell asleep, which left Scot and I to talk and watch the movie. I ended up taking them home at 5, much to Scots disappointment because he really wanted to pull an all-nighter. Thinking back, I really should have done that with him but I didn't because he had to work at 8 and I thought it was going to be hard enough for him to get up as it was. Scot was extremely friendly that night, saying things such as "I never thought I would meet someone here that I completely connect with." I know thats not saying anything, specially nothing in the love department...but when he said that and other things I could just tell that  yes, I do connect with you.     Scot is a great guy, let me describe him for you. He's about 5'11, short short blonde hair and has a little soul patch. I believe he is 22, but I'm not completely sure about that. He's fairly easy going and likes to please. He also loves to drive, and he once told me that he is never comfortable unless he is complete control of the situation, vehicle included. He's really adventurous; your typical "I'll try anything once" kind of guy, which is probably why I like him so much. He also shows signs of a complete gentlemen, like holding open doors and stuff like that. He shys away from talking about dirty or racist things. He's a ruggid guy, and someone who is very adaptive to his surroundings. He can sit in the restaurant and shoot the shit with the old fogies at coffee row, then I see him hanging with the 40-something working guys at 9, then he can come out with us -the seventeen + year olds- and fit in just like that. ...I know a lot more about him than that. I could probably tell a good chunk of his life story.  Its not very often that I find someone that I like, I'm very picky in that department. But I have never met anyone that I have liked more than him.  Conclusion: If Allison and him want to be a couple, all the power to them. But I just hope that I can still hang out with him, because even if it never grows past it, I still consider him a really really good friend.  ~Virginia    This is me...my friend does photo manipulation and doctored up the picture.

      ...but you I can't live without ~U2  Well, I'm gonna respond to a comment that I received about how I handled Justin.  First I'll give you a little background check on Justin.   How I met him:  He's a friend of my cousin Pam. He's been chasing  her  for the past year now, up until he saw me at a party. When I say saw, I mean  SAW.  He didn't talk to me or anything. Anyways, a few days after that he added me to MSN. More about the Pam thing: She's been telling me how awful he is and how much unwanted attention she gets from him for the last year. Then as soon as I told her about Justin liking me, she starts encouraging me to go after him! Like jeeze, why would I want someone that she said was horrible?   What happened after:  After talking to me twice, he asked if I wanted to go to the movie with him on Saturday in a neighboring town. I panicked >. One-on-one interactions with anyone, excluding my closest friends, scare the bejesus out of me. Its something I really need to work on, but for the time being I'm sort of stuck. So as the week progressed, I began to dread the weekend. I couldn't imagine driving with a guy I hardly knew for an hour each way to go to a movie. I even have trouble making conversation with some of my friends for that long! So on Thursday, when I was talkin to Justin, I sorta hinted that I was seeing someone else. He caught on and never mentioned the movie again.  I know I should've been honest and told him the truth: that I wasn't interested. But I couldn't, cause y'see, I've lost a lot of good friends like that. Like take for example my friend Colin. Colin and I have been friends our whole lives. One day, he shows up at my door and says he has to talk to me about something. Next thing I know, he's confessed that he loves me! I told him right then and there that I didn't like him like that. ...that was pretty much the last full conversation I had with Colin.  I respect guys for taking a chance and going for it...but I'd wish that they'd at least check with one of my friends or something to see if the feeling was mutual. Or stop and think for a second, cause in no way did I give Colin reason to believe that I liked him.  I guess I thought that if I don't give Justin a straight answer then he won't give up. I'd like to have him as a friend, just not necessarily a boyfriend. As a rule of thumb, I MUST be friends with someone before anything else can happen, otherwise it will be an unhealthy relationship.  Comments are welcomed. Criticism too, as long as its fair.  ~Virginia  PS...   Left: Robert, Right: Scot This picture was taken right after they crawled out of the trout pond...late night swimming is fun!!! lol.

      Heyo  Work is very boring. No word yet on how much fun I missed last night. But I'm excited because there is a party planned for Wednesday, invite-only, and I just so happen to have an invite! Woo!  I feel sort of bad tho, cause I am cancelling out of another party that I have been invited to on the same night. That party won't be as much fun tho, only a few people are coming and we're going to some lake that I've never been to before. One of the guys that would be at the lake party (his name is Justin) really likes me and wants to take me out...but I have cleverly made up lies to get out of that. One of those such lies is that I am going out with Jared...which is quite the whopper considering that #1. Jared is one of my  best friends , not my  boyfriend  and #2. Jared is gay. So obviously, I am not romantically involved with Jared, but since Justin doesn't live here and he only knows me, he has no idea. I do feel bad about lying, but I figure that its better on him to think that he can't have me cause I'm with someone else, than to not get me cause I'm not interested. I'm not  that  mean, am I? >.  Anyways...I hope I get to see Scot tonight. I'd post a picture of him but I'm not at home.  BYE! :D

      Wow. I actually have a BLOG. I feel special.   My name is Virginia. Yes, like the state. Very good.   I'm a sixteen... no wait, that was last year...  I'm a  seventeen  year old girl from a small town in Saskatchewan, Canada. People think I am odd because I love my hometown, which I honestly do. Sure, there isn't much to do. Sure, it takes 2 hours to get anywhere to buy clothes. But hey! its peaceful and I know everyone and I don't have to be home before dark because of rabid homeless people! Which, in my opinion, is a major plus, don'tcha think?  Both of my parents are farmers, which means some of the elite farmer knowledge has worn of on me, along with the fascination and contemplation of weather. My brother is going to be 21 soon, which is legal drinking age in the United States, where he works. Yay for him! Americans are funny people. The government will let them join the army before they are 21 and go off and fight and die for their country, but they can't sit in a bar and have a beer. COME ON PEOPLE, THATS JUST NOT RIGHT!   I have a dog named Sandy, who is my best friend pretty much. (Don't get me wrong, I have lots of friends! But I love my dog a lot. Her current nickname is Sugar, don't ask why.) I also have a big tankful of African Convict Cichlids, which I find utterly fascinating. They fight, they build nests, they have babies...its like a frickin soap opera in a box! Or an aquarium....whatever.  Someone said something to me once which I found rather amusing, and I have thought about it a lot to this day. It was, and I quote:  Your personality is exactly like that of a seasoned pot-smoker.  You sure don't hear that one everyday. I wasn't really sure what to make of it...is that a good thing? The person followed up the comment with an explanation.  The movies you like, the ideas you have, and the way you act...all of it points to pot.    Another thing that I have been told about myself which I find interesting: Two people have told me this, TWO PEOPLE. One of them is 24, the other 22. They have never met.  You were born in the wrong decade. Your personality and maturity level are that of a 21 year old.  Hmmm....so people are trying to tell me that I appear to be a 21-year-old pot smoker? Is that the way people see me?? Jesus, I gotta work with my agent.  Well, the hour grows late and the candle burns low. I should tottle along off to bed. And if anyone actually does sit down and read this, please leave a message.  PS. Pictures to come! (Just as soon as I figure out how to add them! >.  PSS. OMG! Only 10 more days before I have to go back to hell! I mean school...no I mean hell! :(
