      Well I haven't typed in here for a couple days, so there's gonna be a lot.  Today I skipped my firehall meeting to go shopping, and the bitch ass cashier forgot to ring up one of my skirts that I bought, so I'm mad. I just found out that my big sister is getting me outta school early on Friday to take me to the ocean for memorial day weekend, and we gonna be sooo fucked up the whole time! yay! Tomorrow I plan on going to my bestest friend Liz's house and partying, cause her mom is working till 1 a.m. it will be great. Me n Johnny officially haven't spoken to each other for 24 hours, we got in a hell of an argument last night, so I need to apologize severely. But I will eventually. Me and that girl Justine that I bad mouthed a few days ago in here are getting along and good friends again. My birthday is in 18 days, and we have 10.5 days left of school, that's only like 72 more hours! yay!! I am gonna take my moms advice on Johnny, and just be his best friend, cause he's scared of a relationship, and everytime we start to get close he backs off. So yea.  Well that's about it for now. I will try to write again tomorrow!  Much love!! ~~Kirsten~~

      Ok well. I went up to Johnny's, and everyone was their normal asshole self. I didn't get to be alone with him AT ALL. It is SOO hot outside, All of his brothers are jerks and never ever ever leave him alone, so all I did was watch him play Baseball. It was soo fucking gay. AND he has to fucking work tomorrow so I cant see him outside of school. This whole being in love thing sucks. I think maybe Justine is getting through to him. IDK but I hate her soo soo soo soo much. I just wanna kill her! err!! fuck idk. Maybe he will get online, and we can actually talk about stuff, just him and I. And plus it is easier to talk when you don't have to actually face him. Well. I'm out for now. Peace    I LOVE JOHN

      Okay, so we have 12.5 more days of school. Not too much. But for the rest of the stupid week we have high school assesments. I mean, I only have to take 2 of them, but they make asses outta our schedules and I have to spend almost 2 freakin hours a day in french class! Ahhh I like the english language thank you very much. Thats just too much freakin francais!  Well this morning on the 50 minute bus ride to school, I sat in the back with Johnny, and Justine (my ex-best friend who has had a boyfriend for like 2 years but is suddenly jealous that Johnny likes me and she cant do anything about it) started bitchin like mad. I just wanted to punch her in her fucking face. So natuarally we started bitchin and cussin up a storm at each other. It wuz crazyness. But then Johnny told her that we are going out and well she got even more pissed off, and at that point it wuz just halarious and I still wanted to punch her, but this time just cause shes a bitch, not because we were fighting anymore.   OH NO! I HAVE TO GO... I WILL FINISH THIS TONIGHT SOMETIME. IM GOING TO SEE JOHNNY!!!!!   ***LOVES YAS ME!!***

      OK... well. Im Kirsten, I live in northern Maryland, and for now I am 14, But my birthday is soon, so yay! I am a freshmen in high school, have blonde hair, blue eyes, im 5'7" and weigh 111 lbs.  Today I went to my friend Billy's graduation party, its so freakin hot outside and humid. I coulda swore I was gonna die of heat exaustion. Well anyway, I convinced my dad to bring me home to my moms house, I told him it was too hot outside, but really I just wanted to go next door to see Johnny (who by the way I have been totally in love with for the past 2 anda half years). So i came home, got a shower and then went next door. but he had a double hitter in baseball, so he wasnt home yet. Then I remembered that it is my friend Aimee's birthday, so I came home called her, when I got off the phone with her I went back up to johnnys, he was home. so we just hung out. it was so gay cause his stupid freakin family wouldnt leave us alone. like normally we actually have fun (if you kno what I mean ;-D) but today we didnt do anything at all. I was mad. then I went to go home at around 10 because it was my curfew, and his parents wouldnt let him walk me outside, so I didnt even get a kiss goodnight. I was soooo sad because I have been looking forward to seeing him all weekend when I was at my dads house, and then we dont even have fun. It was such a waste of time. But oh well, at least I got to be with him for a few hours. Well its getting late. I have to go to school tomorrow, walk around with johnny in the morning, be my normal self, sit with johnny at lunch, he prolly wont even talk to me. err. then come home, eat, cuz i wont eat at school, school food is so nasty, and hell i will take all the lunch money mom gives me and pocket it. then tomorrow go to johnnys, as usual, and maybe even get some action like normal. im gonna knock his brother out if he bothers us all night again. well. goodnight!

      OK, its like 11:30 in the morning and I am still in bed. Thats really not even cool. What a waste of my day! lol. Last night after I wrote that long entry, I was really bored so I went into a chatroom, and there was like ten 15 year old guys so i talked to a lotta people it was really neat talking to people that I dont know. Like when you dont know someone, you can be anyone you wanna be. But its sorta rude to lie, so i just act different. Very preppy i think. Its all cool though. Then at like 3 when i finally decided to go to bed, I put in a movie. "confessions of a dangerous mind" its a netflix movie. I didnt watch it all cause i think mom woke up, and i have this kinda rule that when mom wakes up, i go to bed. so yea. I am thinking that I will put a song or something in here in a little while. I dont know why. But I just sorta feel like it. I do know one thing though. I need to get a shower, re color my hair, and go chill with sara today. I am so bored. umm. i guess thats it! well ttfn!  I love johnny...........

      Wow. It has been such a long time since i wrote in here! like the last time that I wrote it was june 17th... and now its July 21st!! I just went back and read all of the entries from before... I am such a drama queen! I was all like "i just wanna die!"&nbsp; well boo hoo. life goes on. sometimes.   Well, me and johnny had a really good week.... then a really big arguement.... then another really good week then we didnt talk for 2 cause of an arguement. like he tells me to come up there, and that he should have never treated me bad, and that he really really likes me and he tells me how great I am... then stuff typically happens... and 2 days later, he wont even talk to me, and he tells me that he had made a mistake, and that he doesnt even care at all that he hurts me. But anyway. so we didnt talk for 2 weeks until last night, when this girl Kate Marr spent the night, and her and I were out side walking, and Ralph topper went to put the trash outfront. so I stopped him and talked to him for a while, then Johnny came down, and well it was really aukward... and we didnt say anything to eachother for like 15 mins. but then finally i broke the "rules" as my brother says, and i spoke to Johnny. so we talked for like 2 hours. It was really nice to talk to him, like not about us, and not be trying to talk to him while hes shoving his tounge down my throat or anything of the sort. I really really do love him though. and i know we will end up together eventually, But for now we both need to be just friends until we are both ready for a real relationship.  Last night when I was standing outside talking to Johnny, Liz and Sara came down the road, with book bags, and they are like "you need to call our mom and tell her that we are spending the night at your house tonight!" because they were planning to meet Robert and Andrew (two boys from Littlestown, PA that they know thru youth group). So I called their Momma on the cell, and Confirmed everything. It was cool i guess. So after I went home, they went to their house and snuck in so that they could change clothes. Then they came back, and snuck into seans bedroom window. and we all chilled in seans room (in the basement) for like 2 hours. and like it was about 2 am. Liz was upstairs asleep in kyles bed. mom had no clue that they were here, Kate was asleep in my bed. and i was taking a 13 min nap in seans bed, with sara in the computer chair next to me keeping track of time and not falling asleep. well next thing i kno, i have 3 mins left to nap. I hear movement in the room, and the basement light is on. I am all looking around for sara, saying "dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, where are you" and my mom walks in. But i was still sorta asleep. so I was like "whoa. mom. I think i fell asleep" and i looked around and i go "where is kate?!" then mom tells me that she is in my bed (which i knew already...) so mom didnt findout about sara and liz, and she thought that kate and I were in seans room, but when i fell asleep, that kate went to bed in my room. in all reality, i cant believe we got away with everything. but we did. it was cool as shit!  well last night, at midnight was the exact middle of summer, so its all down here from here. Next week i have to go to Nana's all week. and dont get me wrong. I love nana dearly, but i dont like staying with her for a whole week! and duh me. I have to go to the firehall next thursday, so i guess thats when i come home. well that makes me a little happier! Sometime in august, i have Training at the fire traning place. Not sure what saturday yet though. And then another weekend in august, i am going to Deleware with my little bro for like 5 days.&nbsp; and i have to go school shopping still, and then I am debating on dying my hair strawberry blonde. but it would be awesome! I am covered In poison ivy. and im all itchy!! ahh. LoL!&nbsp;   Well Now that i have written an entry longer then the bible... I think I am gonna go. ok? ok!  Well for now. I Really LOVE John Joesph Topper. And I do accept that everything happens for a reason, and that I wont be with him right now, but we will work out in the long run... so Goodbye for Now. I will get back on sometime soon I think.   Luv 2 ya! Mwuah!  Kirsten Alyce
