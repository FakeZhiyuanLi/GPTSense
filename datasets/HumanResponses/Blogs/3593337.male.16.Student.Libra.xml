          Again, Not a lot happened to me today. It started off regularly, showered,got dressed, ate and so forth. Then I decided to play MSN before I went to school. I saw that Kendra was on so we talked about the hot gossip in town... it was mainly about the Jarret and Sarah and their new found love. I got to school abit on the late side, but I just had Bio so I didn't give a damn. Then we skip ahead to 3:15, because school is gay and I don't want to talk about it. I really felt like doing something after school just because I didn't want to go home. But everyone was preoccupied so I had no other choice but to go home. I then decided I would go for a drive to kill some time. So I'm driving down main when I see a group of hutterites trying to cross the street. They were already almost half way across when I started slowing down. When they saw me, it was as if I was the Anti-Christ. All 4 of them just start scrambling around. They looked like fucking retards out there. So 2 head back for safety and infront of the Co-op and the other 2 bravely take the risk and proceed to the other side. I was so close to rolling down my window and start yelling at the the retards...Fuckers   That was the most exciting thing that happened to me today.   Then I went over to the school to see what Big K was up to. He was doing some stupid accounting shit with Connie. He asked me to go get his pictures from the Parasave for him. So I did that, then I went over to Radio Shack to see what was new there. Mitch was there but he was TOO BUSY TO TAlk...So I once again left. After about other 5 minutes of driving I got bored and went home. The rest of my night was then followed by, eating, MSN, then homework.   That pretty much sums it all up. I am tired now and ready for bed. Later

        My first blog! I know its kinda cheesy after other people have already had one but...what the hell. It gives me something to do other then gay msn. Anyway, It was Colour Night tonight. It was...Colour Night. Nothing Special. Tyson won for the SRC President and I brought home Top Male Jr. in track,and not a single academic award...as usual. After that, Mitch, Scott, Kendra and Me went cruisin around for abit and went to the FT. It was fun. It was better then doing homework at an old ladies house... Anyway, Time for bed...Later
