      The diffcult part is staying away.  He invited me out to talk.  We talked.  He keeps giving that sexy look of his.  It leaves me speechless. There's just something about how his eyes look, and that soft voice that makes me feel like floating.  Where is his wife?  I sure as hell didn't want to ask.  My heart and body betrays my logic and reason.  "Get in the car", he said.  I really should have agreed on meeting him somewhere.  In the car, he put his hand on mine.  I didn't notice a ring or a tanline on his ring finger.  I casually glanced over at the hand that was on the steering wheel.  There was nothing in the car that showed evidence of another woman, though he may have hid all that away before picking me up.  I wasn't even sure where we were going.  I could have asked him to just come in, but somehow having him in the privacy of my home might lead into something else.  Believe me when I say that I've imagined hundreds of scenarios while I soaked in my tub.  I noticed there was a cooler in the backseat.  I asked about it.  He said it was part of the surprise.  SURPRISE?  I thought we were going to talk over coffee or something.  I didn't argue it.  I was quite content just having his hand on mine.  It was making me tingle just having him touch my skin.  Damn even his hands were sexy.  They were big soft and warm.  I loved how they covered mine protectively.    He sang along to songs that were playing in the CD player.  He's got a great singing voice.  The man was almost perfect, except for the unavailability part of him.  I had to ask him about it.  I had to ask him about her, if there was a her.  I couldn't find the right timing for it.  He joked about things and told me about how some of the things he and his friends did.  His laugh just warms me inside.  I've fallen for this man hard.    He drove to this field about 20 minutes past the freeway.  There was a mowed section with a picnic table.  He said that his family owned this section of land.  It was very secluded.  The first thing that paced through my mind was that no one would be able to hear me if I screamed and if he planned on murdering me no one could help.  He noticed that I was thinking about something and asked if I was ok.  I told him that I was afraid of snakes.  What a stupid thing to say.  It was a lovely picnic.  I felt like I was living something out of a romance novel.  We talked about things in general, what I wanted to do, if I was planning on remodelling or decorating the house.  I was sitting hugging my knees.  He sat with his legs out and resting on his one arm right up next to me.  He pushed the hair out of my face.  I was feeling extacy from having him that close but with an ache in my heart.    We started in each other's eyes for a long time.  I was getting so lost in those hazel eyes of his.  I caught myself looking at his lips far too often.  He sat up closer to me and I could feel his breath on my cheek.  I wanted so badly to kiss him but I sat still just looking at the grass.  He made the first move and turned my head with his hand and kissed my lips lightly.  I wanted to melt.  His kissing became deeper and more intense.  Just this one thing, I thought to myself.  That's it.  I pulled away and he just looked into my eyes.  He told me I had the most beautiful eyes and that there was something about them that made him want to stare at them forever.  My heart ached so.  I had to say something.  I couldn't do this.  It wasn't fair.  I simply said 'I know about her.  We can just be friends.  Would it be ok if you just took me home?'  There was a look of pain in his eyes and he nodded packed up and we rode in silence back to my house.  I sat on my back porch and cried.

      There had to be a reason for my chickening out.  I'm not the type to be nervous about anything.  After much questioning and talking to people, he's married, I found out.  I'm glad now that I didn't go.   I'm disappointed, yes but I couldn't date a married man.  It's wrong.  If I were married and my husband were dating other women, I would be devastated.  This is a downer.  He has such strong magnetism.  It's that smile.  He's very attractive.  I was and am very attracted.  That removes one person from my thoughts.  Now there's just the guy at work.  I know for a fact that he's single.  So this is where I have to stop thinking about him.  Him the exciting one with the fabulous smile.  Stop.

      My feelings are muddled.  I'm thinking about different people.  I don't know how to deal with it.  I feel that I should be picking only one person.  But what if the person I choose doesn't return the feelings?  I have to look into it further.  I couldn't go through with a date that was planned. He went out with his friends instead.  I chickened out!  Nervousness got the best of me.  I hope he isn't mad.  I'm certain that he's disappointed.  I'll deal with him tomorrow.  I'll ask to go for lunch.  He's not too far from downtown.  Might be faster to walk than take the train.  I did chat online with the guy from work today.  He added me to his yahoo account.  I was stoked!  I guess that's a good sign.  He's more open on chat than in person.  Chat is probably more comfortable since you don't have to look at the person you're chatting with.  I wonder if conversation will change tomorrow when I see him.

      My mother came by today and commented on how empty my house is.  I haven't any furniture to fill up this house yet.  I kind of like it the way it is.  I have the necessities and that's about it.    She told me that I shouldn't have bought such a large house.  "It's for a family of 6", she says.  I tell her that I'm well aware of that and was thinking of maybe getting some roomies.  She tells me I'm crazy, and should really think about getting a husband and some kids to fill the house and not roommates.  I don't know if I'm ready for that right now.

      I have a coworker that I've not thought too much about before.  He was-and is, the quiet guy.  I pretty much ignored him all these years.  Lately I've been talking to him more often.  I always saw him as this geek kind of person.  He always wore cargo pants and never jeans, and either game, anime or rock tshirts.    Anyway, we've been talking and joking around about things and he's a nice guy.  He actually has a sense of humor.  From first glance he looks very serious.  One shouldn't judge by looks alone, but everyone says he appears to be that type. Upon getting a better look at the guy, he's not bad looking at all.  In fact clean him up a little and he'd be hot!  In the past 3 days I've been thinking about him a lot.  A lot more than one should; him being someone that I have just become friends with.

      I have checked out a few other online journals and I just wanted to try this one out.  So far it seems ok.
