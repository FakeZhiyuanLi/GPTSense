      WAHOOO!!!! Today was a phenomally great day.  I found out late this afternoon that I have an extra 30 mg of protein, not including the stuff in the cold room that I haven't purified yet.  For all you non-biochemists, this roughly equals 3 days worth of 11 hr days, plus another 4-5 days for purification.  So, basically, I have a week's worth of free protein that I wasn't counting on!  WAHOOO!!!! My day gets better...all the protein looks good on the gel, no degradation or anything.   My day gets even better, as I begin to plan the Kyrsten festivities next week. I"m inviting 8 of my girlfriends/work mates over to my place for a massive potluck dinner.  I can fit 8 comfortably around the table, and one or two people are not sure if they can come yet.  I'm looking forward to wine flowing on my birthday.  Sure beats hanging out alone at my place getting all mopey.  So far, it looks like I'll have garlic bread from Jessmi, molten lava cakes for dessert from Roberta, guacamole and chips for appys from Shauna, moroccan cous cous salad (stacy the cook is not sure yet if she wants to make taht), some FANTASTIC Thai dish from Benchamas (I have yet to dislike any of her cooking, and she knows that I only eat chicken), vegetables of some sort from Rebecca, something spicy from Kim, and i'm making chicken skewers and lemon rosemary potatos.  The chicken skewers i'm going to make with a choice of four marinades:  Lemon-Miso (one of my favorites, i may make this with tofu instead, or have that the night before), Teriyaki, Curry and Peanut sauce. MMMMM.  I am also going to try and make my dad's special oven-roasted potatos with lemon juice and rosemary.  So very good. Just to throw another international dish in there, I may steam some chinese chicken dumplings to serve too.  They are good, but the ones I have right now are a little salty anyways, so I don't mind making them :).    so do you still want to hear about Shit week? Monday -  Tuesday - Found out James is going to UVic.  Can deal with this easily, but it was just another added thing.  Worked 11 hrs Wednesday - got back from golf tournament at work (sunburned) to find out my dad was going to have surgery to remove 20% of lung. Jury still out on whether this will actually happen. He's going for the fine-needle biopsy on Friday to try and determine whatever the hell this is BEFORE they remove the lung Thursday - Shitty day at work, still dealing with shock of dad surgery. Try and negotiate a way to get home in the event that the surgery is happening soon, get shafted by EVERYONE except Westjet. Friday - get an early morning phone call from my best friend saying her dad shot himself.  While talking/crying about life to friends, drop an $800 UV light transmitting cuvette on the ground, where it shatters.  Fuck. Supervisor finds out our major source of funding is cancelled.  Told that I have to finish my vaccine prep in two weeks (A HELL OF A LOT OF WORK) because my horses are arriving then whether i'm ready or not.  He wants data for the conference in Singapore.  We now have to apply for more grants, something he was not planning because this grant was supposed to last until 2008.  They will give us compensatory money, but it'll only be about 2 yrs worth.      Saturday - go to work early to get stuff done before wedding in afternoon.  FInd out the piece of equipment I need to use to tell me whether I need to do more protein purification is not working.  Go to wedding.  Come back from wedding at 9 p.m., go into work for an hour Sunday - work 11 hrs.  Cells take forever to grow, am exhausted at end of evening. Monday, Tuesday - work 11 hrs.  Take no breaks, except 15 min to eat and 40 minutes to vote on Monday.   Wednesday - well, see above.  IT GOT SO MUCH BETTER!!! IT"S MAYBE OVER!  plus i just finished a yummy dinner.  Must go watch Trailer Park boyz now.

      Going to bed early, because my social life is SO happening ;)  What can I say, today was the third day in a row of 11 hrs per day in the lab. I'm exhausted, and I have a good book to read, Timothy Findley's "Last of the Crazy People".  Which reminds me, I'd better hop on down to the used bookstore this weekend, I have nothing more to read!  I got three books at the end of May (one of which was 1000+ pages), and I've almost finished all three! Yes, reading is very important to me.    Now's the time to read until the book falls on my face.

      Hmm.  So my NDP candidate got 7.01% of the vote in my riding.  He was actually beat out by the Green Candidate.  Which makes me laugh, because the NDPer Tim Patterson actually has some experience, and has some fine credentials, whereas the Green candidate is still in her 2nd year of Earth Science at U of C.  Huh?  I guess most of the "smart" people voted for Justin Thompson, Liberal.   But Rob Anders won 55% of the vote.  Less than before, but still enough to be elected.  Fucking prick.  Here's some of the things he stands for, and this is why I don't like him (taken from www.cbc.ca)   "Career Background: He spent two months as a professional heckler for a Republican in the 1994 Oklahoma senatorial race and was labelled a "foreign political saboteur" by CNN. From 1995-1996, he was director of Canadians Against Forced Unionism, a project of the National Citizens' Coalition in Calgary, and in 1997 was director of International Commodities Trading, an Alberta-based commodity trading company.".  PROFESSIONAL HECKLER?  do they actually have those? He's a damn Republican supporter too!  Probably loves Bush.    "He is spokesperson for the Calgary Chamber of Commerce Speaker's Bureau. He has been supportive of a number of groups, including the Royal Alberta United Services Institute, the Fraser Institute, the Alberta Taxpayers' Association, the Progressive Group for Independent Business, the Canadian Property Rights Research Institute, the National Firearms Association, Responsible Firearms Owners of Alberta, National Right to Work Committee, Focus on the Family, and the Canada Family Action Coalition."  Hey, he stands for all the issues I hate!!  Imagine that.  Fraser Institute?  Right wing place where they apparently "think" and release news reports on right wing issues every now and then.    I just love that he supports firearms issues.  So fucking Albertan.    Focus on the Family?  He doesn't even have a family.  Nice that he chooses to support right wing groups (Canada Family Action Coalition) that believe that "Heterosexual attraction between males and females is the only natural and normal sexual orientation"  (see http://www.familyaction.org/Articles/issues/freedoms/bill-c250/22-possible.htm)  This site made me want to retch. Check it out, but take Gravol first. Is it possible that I live in a province where this is acceptable thinking?  Uh oh, Toto, we're not in BC anymore.

      This is about the ONLY time that I actually miss not having television.    The CBC, far from the promise of providing election coverage, is sending some new-agey story shit over the airwaves.  I WANNA KNOW WHO'S WINNING!  Seat by seat!!  Well, thanks to the great interweb, I do.  Canada.com actually has a decent federal election results javascript thingy that is pretty AND tells me which parties are winning where, and what the breakdowns are like.    So far, the Liberals are up 45 seats, next to Conservatives' 13 seats.  Of course, they've only gone through the Maritimes. I have this horrible, horrible feeling that the Liberals are going to get trashed Ontario through Alberta, and BC might actually be the deciding vote FOR ONCE!  I should have voted by mail in BC, but I chose to vote in calgary, where you must vote for the Conservatives or be looked at REALLY FUNNY.  Not that I give a shit what anyone thinks.  I voted NDP.  Not that they even have the slightest chance in my riding.  Guess who my Conservative MP is?  Rob Anders.  Remember him?  The ONLY MAN IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS TO NOT VOTE TO GIVE NELSON MANDELA honarary Canadian Citizenship, that's who.  Why?  Well, according to Rob Anders, Nelson Mandela is a TERROIST and A Communist.  WTF?  Has Rob Anders had his alien-looking head stuck in the proverbial sand for the 12 years or so that Nelson Mandela spent in prison for doing what he believed in?  That's more than Rob Anders has done and ever will do.  Rob Anders is also the man who voted AGAINST giving $500,000 for student summer job funding (like work study) because he said it would ruin the free market economy.  Well, maybe, but if you consider that minimum wage here in Alberta is FUCKING LOW, then you can consider that you could help a LOT OF STUDENTS get the JOBS THEY WANT as opposed to working at Timmy's.    ARGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!    Anyways, will keep my eyes glued on the comp, as apparently the CBC sucks ass.

      I feel like i've been run over by a truck, emotionally speaking.  I have gone through so much shit in the past two days, it's amazing that I am still sitting here and not huddling under my covers in bed.  My best friend's dad committed suicide yesterday, while surrounded by a SWAT team from the RCMP.  This is now the second successful suicide amongst parents of friends, and the third attempt at suicide amoungst my friend's parents. My first boyfriend's dad had attempted suicide 3 or 4 times, and I saw how the family was torn apart by that.  Last year, the mother of a friend of ours robbed a bank, then basically committed suicide (she worked for the local district attorney and she turned the gun onto the police and they shot her)   I just don't understand it.  I was thinking this morning...who the hell is phoning me at 8:30 just before I leave, and OH SHIT it's not something good if they are phoning now.  Sure enough, I hear my best friend weeping on the line. First, I actually thought it was my mom crying about something that happened to my dad, and then I realized it was my best friend.  She went on to tell me that her dad had gone to her grandma's place to take care of the farm, and that he was actually missing for a few days.  Her mom had gone to the farm to find her dad (it is her grandma's farm), because they had finally talked to him, and he was apparently hearing voices, was very delusional, and was convinced that "they were trying to take the farm away from him".  In a sense, very messed up. He was very paranoid that someone was out to get him.  So of course, the SWAT team showing up did not help at all. He took a gun and locked himself in either the house or barn (couldn't hear between sobs).  There, surrounded by the SWAT team, he killed himself.  Her mom appeared on the scene, only to see the house and whole road blocked off, not knowing what was going on.  She's obviously inconsolable right now.  I talked to her for about 15 minutes this morning before she left to go meet her mom.  I hope she phones tonight, as she promised, but I'd completely understand if she doesn't.  I sent her an email as I told her I would, giving her my lab phone #, my office #, my two email addresses (she only remembers my house #), and told her that if she wants me at the funeral, I'd be happy to attend.  Not because I knew him (I had only met her mom), but becuase she may need someone to hold her up.    It just makes me so sad because she is an only child, and her dad was so special to her.  He had no history of depression or schizophrenia, and apparently he had only begun to talk like this for the past week that he was at the farm.  I don't know if it was an unrecognized problem or whether it was triggered by something...hallucinogenic ergot (we all saw X-files where that rye gave them all delusions and hallucinations).  I have no idea.  Either way, her mom is completely floored...they were high-school sweethearts that loved each other so much.    What sort of trend is this?  Parents should die of natural causes, not like this.  It just makes it harder when they choose to end their own life...makes the people left behind blame themselves.

      ARGH! I spent an hour today trying to find a way to get home in the event that my dad's surgery takes place in the next two weeks or so.  I phoned a car rental company that I have rented from 4 times in the past, Hertz.  I chose them because they do not have a daily surcharge for drivers under 25.  Oops, DID NOT have a daily surcharge.  Fucking bastards now enforce a $15 per day surcharge on the rental fee (at least $35 a day for a cheap car).  Apparently, according to the grumpy lady on the reservation line, it is a new thing and "all the other companies are doing it"  No fucking way?  Do you think I like renting Fords?  I'd rather get a Toyota from Budget but I can't afford the $35 DAILY SURCHARGE FOR DRIVERS UNDER 25!!!!!!!!!!!  I Was going to rent a car for the week, but the car rental alone from Hertz is $309 (which I can afford), but with the daily fucking surcharge, it's now $445 (which I cannot afford, as I can fly home AT THE LAST MINUTE for $60 cheaper!!!!)  Oh, and Budget wants $575 for the weekly rental + surcharges.  Would you like my first born, or would you like to suck out my blood and sell it on the black market?    All the other car rental companies are the same.  So, I thought, well Greyhound has student rates, and they are known for cheap travel.  HAHAHAHA! If I had bet on Greyhound, I would have lost major money.  For a 20.5 hr trip from Calgary to Victoria (I can drive it in 12 hrs including ferry ride), with the student discount, it comes to $296!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Do they actually think I am willing to sit on a cramped bus seat for 20 HOURS next to smelly people just to say $70?  When I can fly home in AN HOUR AND 15 MINUTES with Westjet and not waste an entire day/night?  Westjet it is.  I already have a flight home booked to leave Calgary on the 24th of July, flying back on the 2nd of Aug, but I may just fly out a little earlier, and pay Westjet the difference in prices.  That's only if my dad's surgery is around the 15th or so.  He has a consultation with the doctor on the 8th of july, so at least that buys me a little time.  They will probably do the surgery a few days after that AT THE EARLIEST.  I have no idea what sort of waiting list we are looking at here.    Besides which, Westjet rocks.  A friend of mine accidently booked a flight a week earlier than he meant to, showed up at the time he thought he booked, and they let him off with only charging him a $25 fee (the fee they charge you if you missed that days' flight, not LAST WEEK's). They've done this twice for him (he missed it by two days the last time).  Honestly, I have no idea how he screws up his flight times...I'm so excited that i'm flying that it is permanantly etched in my brain for the month beforehand.  Another option, a friend of mine might be travelling out to the coast around the middle of the month. so I may end up getting a ride with him, we'll see.  He doesn't know yet.  Hell, I don't even know if the surgery decision is in fact final.

      So I just found out that my dad will be scheduled for surgery sometime soon. About a month or two ago, when he finally got a new doctor, they did a whole battery of tests on him.  He's always had problems with pneumonia (gets it every other year), and was a smoker for 30 years (has quite for 14 yrs now).  They found a shadow on his lung, and were not able to culture it.  It's not lung cancer apparently, but they thought it might be Cryptococcus neoformans (that fungus that was at Rathtrevor beach on the trees that several people got sick from).  They are now going to insert a needle into his lungs and take another sample to try and culture it.  That's a fairly routine procedure.  However, they have decided that they should remove the shadowed area regardless.    He's going to lose 20% of his lung (which most of it is dead air space that is not used, if you know anything about anatomy, you can lose the bottom portion of your lung and still be fine).  And it's going to require a stay of 5-7 days in the hospital, with 3-5 weeks of downtime.    This comes at a bad time for him, as he JUST started a new job that requires a lot of work on his behalf managing a site.     He doesn't know when the surgery will be scheduled, but i'm going to do my best to fly/bus home to be with him.  As well, it may give me a few more days at home.  I need a vacation (will be taking one at end of july but still!), and I know that he would love it if I was there.  He would be fine if I wasn't, but I think I will try and get the time off.    soooooo not good to get news like this when i'm already feeling PMS-sy and emotionally fragile.

      So my presentation went well.  Other than talking faster than Speedy Gonzales on Crack, it went fairly smoothly.  Many people told me that it went well, but I'm still waiting for the harsh criticisms (my boss only said that I talked too fast, and commented that my use of formal language is improving) For example, the last time I rehearsed the talk for him, I said "those guys from the NRC in Ottawa did this"  D'OH!  Not formal language, that's for sure!  Afterwards Roberta (one of the other grad students) took me for a celebratory slurpee.  We have now decided that we are bad influences on each other.  I hadn't had a slurpee in about 2 years until I met Roberta, and she's complaining that this one was her third in as many days.  We are both pretty "romanesque" (not quite "zaftig" in figure yet) and therefore could probably use to lose a few pounds.  Oh well, I'd need to lose at least 10 pounds to really look good in my two-piece.  It's probably not going to happen, as I have not gone to the gym in about a month or two.  But I am trying to keep somewhat active on weekends, with the exception of last weekend that was all about the food.  To reward myself for a finished presentation, I got two DVDs:  Monty Python's the Meaning of Life, and Reservoir Dogs.  What to watch?  I feel like silly comedy...so Monty Python here I come.  And maybe i'll even finish that sweater I'm knitting for my mom tonight!  So many options!!  Maybe i'll work on some new jewelry...it's a free night for once, where I actually do not feel guilty for not doing school/work related things.  Yahoo!

      blurg...too full of food!  After yesterday's debauch of food at the bridal shower potluck, it happened again!  Another potluck, but with even yummier food this time!  Yesterday was a mix of things like veggies and dip, bean salad, dumplings, lasagna, nanaimo bars, homous and pita, cheese toasts, apple pie, and many more yummy food.  A mix of rather ordinary food.    But tonight, well I've decided that Benchamas (a post-doc from Thailand) is the best cook EVER.  She was amazing.  Her and her friend Tuta (also from Thailand) cooked up a storm, although it was mostly Benchamas.  She made this amazing chicken chow mein-type dish with this creamy sauce (have NO IDEA what it was made of).  Then she made one of teh most amazing green curries, but DAMN was it hot.  I was loving it because I'm slowly starting to appreciate curries in my relative old age (I think my taste buds are finally starting to become normal), complete with coconut rice.  And to top it off, she made tempera.  From scratch.  All the veggies you can think of, including salmon tempera (James you would have loved it). Other people brought salads, I brought my inadequate homous (next to this spread of food it was)....SO GOOD.  What made it even better was that it was all girls from various labs, and no guys were there.  I know that sounds sexist, but sometimes it's really nice to just get together with people you dont' know that well and get to know them better because there are no restrictions on discussions.  At least in the sense that the discussions can get raunchy and there's no apologizing for it.   We have all agreed that Benchamas has to teach us how to cook Thai food (for instance I'd love to know how to make a stirfry without drowning it, and I"m sure James would love me for it too), and we're going to try and do it more often.  As well, i'm trying to plan a wine and cheese one weekend, as many people seem interested.  Maybe even a "tea party" with my varied selections of tea (I have 10+ versions of different loose leaf teas)  Well, I'm putting off the inevitable. Must go practise my presentation once more.

      ok so very full now!  Made a real breakfast for myself this morning, as opposed to the two pieces of toast I have every morning.  Cranberry juice, strawberries, two hard-boiled eggs, and fried potatos.  Yummy!  Wish I had a digital camera to take a picture of perfection, but, I will get one eventually.  Still haven't even developed my pictures from my new orleans trip at the end of May.  Anyhooo....off to work I go.  Too bad I dont' have the seven dwarves to escort me there...it's so windy out I might blow away!

      This is an interesting trend:  http://money.cnn.com/2004/06/18/news/fortune500/mcdonalds.reut/index.htm?cnn=yes One of the McDonald's franchises now has one traditional ordering station, and three computer kiosks that you can order your food at.  They are streamlining the system so much, they have gotten rid of 2 of the front people.  What are all the kids who work at McDonalds' gonna do instead?  I dont' think cutting down on the labour aspect is a good thing in the long run.  Personally, I'd love for a virus (or several) viruses to infect those computers and shut them down for a while.  Then they'll see why they have real people to interact with at McD's.  On a similar streamlining note, Wendy's has now opened 5 drive-through ONLY Wendy's in the states.  They are getting rid of the restaurant entirely, allowing them to cut down from 20 staff to 12 staff.  Apparently they will have walkup windows, but honestly, who is going to walk through a line of cars spewing gases to get their meal?  Just another step toward the American dependance on the car.

      I had the strangest urge today to make cupcakes. Normally I stay away from the premixed stuff, due to the preservatives and the fact I can't really be sure what's in it, but I was just craving it.    So I made 24 (!) cupcakes, and proceeded to eat 3, along with Breyers natural vanilla ice cream.  So good, but I'm very full of sugar now and probably won't be able to get to bed for a while.    Maybe i'll bring the rest to the bridal shower to get rid of them so I dont' eat them.  I've already gained 10 pounds since stopping riding my bike every day, and I dont' need anymore!

      I must say that I am trying, as I get older, to be less fixated on material things for my birthday.  I am given so much during the year by my parents, and I have no need for anything that I cannot get myself.  I am trying to put less emphasis on my birthday, mainly because it's not that big a deal. It happens once a year.  Theoretically I get older.  I don't feel it, although I sure don't feel like I'm 20 anymore.  Which is a good thing.  I like to think that I have the maturity that has started to come with an extra 3.8 years or so of experience.  I only expect it'll get better.    I benefit greatly from the things people do for me all year round, little touches to make my day easier, or to make me smile when it's obvious I'm having a bad day.  A present from someone will never give you that.  It may brighten your day momentarily, but as it is somethiing that costs money (which is important to many of my friends as we are all poor), it is not something that happens often enough to really make that big a difference in the large scheme of things.  That being said, I still love the dishes that James has gotten me for the last few birthdays, but the set is nearly complete.    As I said, all I want are the mementos.  They are things like letters that I can pull out when I've had a really shitty day and remember about home with.  They will allow me to transport myself home, possibly to a happier time, and make my day brighter.  All that being said, I'm still coveting a grey hoodie at Aritzia that I'm going to treat myself to on my birthday (it's $70, it's just like my black one for those who know).  It'll be my gift to myself.

      Well, there are times that I don't understand my parents completely, or at least I don't think they fully understand me.    My mom is talking about possibly buying me a Nissan X-terra if they end up selling the lower 1/3 of their property.    Huh?  I love my parents dearly, and I appreciate the thought, truely. However, I have no intention of owning an SUV (although it would be handy in winter here...hmmmm) due to the impending increase in the already-expensive gas prices, and the fact that WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH OIL TO SUPPORT OUR LIFESTYLE AS IT STANDS.  In a way, she had a point...I could fit both bikes in the back and still have room. However, I could also fit those bikes on the back of a fuel-conserving Toyota Echo (which is damn cute too!!).  And I know that I could convince James to ride in a Toyota Echo, where I would NEVER be able to convince him to willingly ride in an SUV all the time.  I don't blame him.  Besides, even if it just ends up me in Calgayr, do I need that big of a car? I don't have children, and if the weather ever gets so bad I need a big car with Four wheel drive...maybe I shouldn't be driving in it :):)  I've survived a winter in Calgary quite easy with just the bus system. I am getting pissed off though about not being able to get places I need to which aren't on the regular bus system (i.e. buses every 5-10 min).  For instance, there are a few farmer's markets that require cars to get to, I have a bridal shower tomorrow, etc. Most of the time I can get a ride.  But I do like going places by myself.  I can always rent a car....I just hate having to return it the next day...cuts into my time because I have to go all the way downtown.    I still do think an X-terra would be cool...I can imagine myself driving it with the music cranked..looking cool.  However, I think my trance/trip-hop is more of a fit with a Toyota Echo.  An X-terra would require some hip-hop or drum and bass...something not so flighty :)  Besides which, my parents regularly come up with these crazy-ass ideas that never go to fruition.  But with my parents, you better watch out.  Sometimes they do come true, and it's just when you don't expect.  My dad just bought a new Honda Element...he went from talking about it to buying it in two days flat.  It wasn't supposed to be delivered until the end of the month, but he has it already.  And here I thought it was just more blunder.  Guess I was wrong this time.    And can I really accept a car from my parents?  I can't afford one myself (grad student salary barely covers rent and food), especially not the insurance (which my mom said they'd cover, all i'd have would be gas) but I feel like a BIG HUGE MOOCH.  I'm 24, should I accept this offer (IF IT EVER TURNS OUT TO BE TRUE?!?)?   I love my parents dearly, but I don't want to take away from their life at all...my mom seems to think that they will have more than enough money for themselves.  Still, I have pangs of "do I deserve this".    My parents are the coolest ever, even if this never comes to fruition (which I fully expect it will not).  They love me dearly and I do them.  I can't believe the sort of sacrifices they have made just for me over the years.  They are the sort of sacrifices you can't thank by giving a card on Mother's or Father's day.  In fact, I have no way to repay the sort of things they have done for me, and the opportunities they have given me.  Other than loving them for who they are.

      Well, as james asked, what else do I want for my birthday?  1)  Hugs from my man and my parents when I get back home on the 24th 2)  Pictures of beautiful Victoria (I rarely get to see home it seems) 3)  a certain picture of a certain redhead in his wetsuit at Tofino (love that picture, would love a copy for my office) 4)  A nice card....filled with genuine sentiments 5)  Promises of at least 2 nights blissfully camping in Strathcona or Tofino or Saltspring at the end of July  I really don't want much.  Really, this year, I want lots of things that remind me of home, but that dont' cost anything...mementos.  I know it sounds corny, but I would love nothing more than to get a card, pictures of home, a handwritten letter, and a nice small stone or seashell from the beach.  Something to remind me of the sea and home.

      It's always interesting to read Drudge Report, which somehow always manages to give a slight conservative/Republican skew to most of the stories it reports.  They like to show the point of view of conservatives whenever possible.  Although this is not the best example:  .......................................... Interview with Michael Moore by Matt Lauer:  LAUER: There's a disturbing sequence in the film that shows-- US soldiers, casualties. It has interviews with US soldiers in battles. How did you get that footage?  MOORE: From a variety of sources...   Lauer: ...Do you think that the soldiers thought they were talking to a film crew that was working with Michael Moore?   Moore: Some of them did and some of them didn't...   Lauer: ...Do you think that's fair?   Moore: Well, I think it's fair that the American people know what's going on. These soldiers are certainly presented in the film with the deepest respect...  ............................  "Do you think that's fair?" Well, yes, because people's responses should be the same whether they are talking to George Bush or to Michael Moore, if they truely have conviction.  Whether or not they knew they were talking to Michael Moore should not change anything.  They were asked for THEIR opinion, not one that should be affected by the audience.     My main point:  the conservative Matt Lauer tries to make Michael Moore sound like a vote-hungry politician, a man who does clandestine filming of soldiers, etc.   Michael Moore according to the conservative movement is the Big Bad Wolf.    For the rest of the excerpt from the interview:   http://www.drudgereport.com/flash.htm

      I LOVE THIS SCENT!  it's $16.00 at Shoppers drug mart for the handcream but I really want the bath and shower gel which is a little more expensive:    http://store.yahoo.com/shopcrabtree/ros36930.html    (US prices)  I also love the freesia scent too, but I think I may get that for my mom one of these days...

      well, after a VERY long day in the lab (10+ hrs), I was invited out for some impromptu sushi with a few friends.    This was the coolest restaurant idea ever:  Sushi Boat.    Your sushi arrives on coloured plates, according to price, delivered by these boats that go around and around on a little waterway built in front of the sushi bar that circles around the room.  The sushi chefs stand in the middle and make continuous amounts of good sushi.  SO MUCH GOOD STUFF.  James, I HAVE to take you here, you'd absolutely love it.  Good sushi like Sushi Plus, but nicer atmosphere and almost as cheap.    I tended to stick with the veggie sushi (although I had barbequed salmon skin roll by accident, but it actually was quite good), which was $1.60 for 1-4 rolls, depending on their complexity.  I had like 6 plates of that, and one red plate (which was more expensive, at $2.60 for four small rolls of Korroke (tempera battered potato!), as well as tempera ($5 for veggie tempera, which was easily the best tempera I've had in Calgary).  All told, I spent $18.50.  And I'm completely stuffed, considering that also included as much green tea as I could drink, and dessert.   The other girls I was with are known for their sushi eating capabilities.  Two girls shared $57 worth of sushi!  Granted, most of it was expensive things like unagi (eel) ($3.10 for two elaborate rolls) and salmon roe, but they still had quite the sizable stack of plates in front of them at the end.    All in all, a very good meal. Too bad it's in a strip mall that may or may not be very accessible by much.  Oh wait...doesn't that Define Calgary as a city?  Not much accessible by much?  I'm having to resort to renting a car this saturday so I can get to a bridal shower i've been invited to the southwest.  Apparently, this house is in a black hole area for buses.  Either way, i'm sure there is a bus, but I can't be bothered to figure out where.  Besides which, I'm hankering to go for a drive.  We'll see though, I may be able to finagle a ride with someone else.   Stupid bridal shower.  Only got the invite today BY EMAIL for saturday.  Not only did I plan a full day of productive experiments for saturday, but it's also a potluck.  Where the hell am I supposed to get the time to cook something?  I can barely cook anything interesting for myself!  Enough rant.  Must go practice talk for my professor tomorrow. I think it's gonna be a gong show.

      Well, this little girl sure came into a lot of money:   http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/15/fashion/15DRES.html  She's not planning on managing the business right away, but let's face it, versace can pretty much manage itself as it's an established (and expensive) brand.  Besides, her mother Donatella is an absolute ditz, and she's made even more money than Gianni Versace, who actually designed good clothes.  Is it just me, or does donatella versace look like a drag queen?

      Honestly, at times I do not understand our society:   http://www.cnn.com/2004/HEALTH/diet.fitness/06/14/baby.fat.ap/index.html  The sentence "...parents are flocking to baby exercise classes where tots as young as one day old can start getting fit" is one of the most screwed up I have read in a long time.  It's stories like this that remind me of one of the ladies I work with.  She has a 21 month year old son, and she has been feeding him Coke twice or three times a week for the past few months.  Basically, whenever she drinks, she gives him some because he demands it.  Yes, she doesn't give him a lot (no more than 1/8 of a can or so) but still, he's less than 1/8 her size!!!!  And she wonders why sometimes he doesn't want to go to bed.    I personally believe that kids should never be fed junk food under the age of 6, and if parents complain that their kids want it (as this lady does), perhaps they should set the example and not drink it themselves.  Of course, as I say this, I'm drinking a Coke.  Hypocrite?  Well, I'm also capable of making the decision to drink it despite the fact I know it's not good for my body.  A 2 year is not capable of that decision.

      After many hours/days/weeks of reading other people's blogs, I'm now attempting to start my own.  As the name of the blog implies, I am attempting to get my PhD., and honestly, am quite tentative about success.  Do I want a PhD? Well yes, because then I will be able to work in academia, teaching and doing MY research.  Do I want to be one of the thousands of PhDs who have gone onto successful post-doctoral jobs (kinda like a badly paid internship), then found that there is no place/room in academia for them?  And that they are now over-qualified for the amount of money they will be offered at a government job or in private industry?  Well, no, but we'll see where i'll be destined to end up.  For all the government's talk about the brain drain, it is a reality.  Very few things kept me in school in Canada, the main factor being that I did not want to live in a country ruled by George Bush for the next five years.  However, I like to think that I am one of the few that has faith in the Canadian university system. Who knows, that optimism may fade rapidly.    As for my PhD., it's in microbiology, which many people believe is a money making area (what with anthrax scares and E. coli O157:H7).  It's not.  I know one girl who was thrilled to death that she got a job as a postdoc at Health Canada in Winnipeg because it paid $40,000 a year.  And she had to move to Winnipeg.  Ugh.   Anyways, I have to give a gigantic talk in a few days before my entire department.  Must go and rehearse so I dont' look like an idiot.

      I often forget just how much work Victorians put into their gardens.  The flowers here are beautiful and WAAYY ahead of the Calgary flowers. The delphiniums just came out a few weeks ago in Calgary.  In Victoria, they are already gone.    Luminara last night, in the garden of our city, Beacon Hill Park, was pretty amazing.  James and I went, and had a nice stroll around Beacon Hill Park looking at people and lanterns.  The capoiera dancers were amazing (what we could see of them, with people butting in front of us just because they couldn't see either), and some of the lanterns were awesome.  One of these years I would LOVE to get dressed up in a costume and go to Luminara...seems like so much fun.  We ran across the "Balkan Babes"  singing beautiful songs in other languages, next to a really neat fire lantern.  I wanted to stay longer, but their set ended, and we had been all over the park.      We didnt' run into anyone we knew were going, like Davin, Monika or Jen, but I wasn't surprised...it was a huge crowd.  Despite this, I ran into a girl I did my undergrad with, Theresa.  She's an awesome go-getter incredibly intelligent girl, who climbs in her spare time, and just got accepted to med school.  She had thought I was going to U of A in Edmonton, so she was so surprised to find out that I was at U of C in calgary, in the SAME building as the med school.  I'm in the faculty of medicine too, just in a thesis based program instead. We were lab partners in third year, and man, if people think I'm anal about experiments...well she takes the cake.  I'm really psyched that she's coming to Calgary, as she doesn't know anyone, and I can set her up with a few climbers that I know there, med students and PhD students with too much time on their hands. :)  I think if she wants, we'll take her out hiking a few times too.  Calgary may suck because It's Not Victoria, but the hiking is AMAZING and SO CLOSE.  It's one of the things I LOVE about Calgary---its close proximity to the mountains.    So now i'm all psyched, because one of my friends is finally moving to calgary. Very cool.  She's one of those crazy very social girls so she won't need me at all, but it would be cool to have someone else to go out with.      The one thing I can never get used to about coming back to stay with James...he sleeps WAY longer than me.  I put in a load of laundry, updated my blog, and probably will have more than enough time to read all my other blogs before he even contemplates opening his eyes :):)

      after an hour and a half (ack!) bath, complete with honey and oatmeal facial, massive shaving, plucking of eyebrows, and trimming of bangs, I am feeling much better.&nbsp;  The bangs really needed to be trimmed, as I was too busy to go for the COMPLIMENTARY bang trim at my hairdresser (how lazy can I be?).&nbsp; They were getting so long, I could be going for the 70's bob look with the long bangs...ACK!&nbsp; They are much more Cleopatra/Amelie/punk rock shorter. I keep trying to get the hairdressers to always cut them short, but they either don't, or they grow so fast they begin to look like *normal* bangs.&nbsp; I think it's because normally i'm a pretty serious person, and by the time I get to the hairdresser, I'm generally not dressed all that flashy because I'm pissed at my hair, and so the hairdressers think i'm all conservative.&nbsp; Of course, once I get my hair cut, that's when I go home and actually Dress.&nbsp; Anyone who knows me well know that my wardrobe, while generally on the conservative side, does have a fair amount of colourful/flashy clothes that I do pull out once or twice weekly.&nbsp; (well not lately, when I work long hours at the lab, I do the fake ninja look...black top and black baggy cargo pants).&nbsp; Really, the only place I can get crazy all the time is my hair.&nbsp; No, I'm not the type to get purple hair (actually did have blackberry for a while).&nbsp; I would go all crazy all the time and have red/blonde streaks permanently, but I can't afford the upkeep.&nbsp; One of my recent favs in the winter was a few shades darker with red highlights.&nbsp; Very cool, with longish bob and shorter bangs, apparently it was very uma thurman circa pulp fiction.&nbsp; Will post picture in next post.&nbsp; Going to go dark again next winter...seems suicide to do it right now in the Calgary heat.&nbsp;

Already read the TC, Herald, Globe and Mail, CNN, CBC.ca, NY Times, any and all blogs I could find, drudge report, IMDB news.......  And with being sick the past week, I've watch Sex and the City season 1 and 4, with 3 already watched SO MANY TIMES.&nbsp; No movies to watch that I haven't watched already many times.  I think i'm going to have to do a facial or find hair to pluck or something...nothing left to do but primp

      There is very very bad backstreet boys and early 90s techno being played upstairs.&nbsp; And the kids upstairs are jumping UP AND DOWN REPEATEDLY ON THE CEILING causing my plates to jump and the ceiling to boom.&nbsp; Best birthcontrol ever is to listen to other people's kids. I have a mind to go upstairs and kindly ask them to turn it down because I was attempting a nap (i'm still not that well), but they dont' speak English.&nbsp;   I'm retaliating with Fiona Apple played loudly, and the subwoofer ON.&nbsp; But all I can hear is doot doot doot do-do doot doot doot....ARGH!!!!!!!!

      Strangest thing ever happened yesterday.  Getting ready for bed, I got a phone call at 10 p.m.&nbsp; I was thinking, who the hell phones this late?&nbsp; (I make it a point of never phoning anyone after 10 p.m. or before 10 a.m.)&nbsp; It was my friend Amelia from Vancouver.&nbsp; I haven't talked to her in a while, but we keep up with email every few months or so.&nbsp; We were roomates when I was working in Vancouver the summer of my second year.&nbsp; She asked me about school, and how life in Calgary was. I told her about some of the nice people I had met, and she mentioned that a friend of hers went to U of C.&nbsp; "You probably don't know him, he's finishing his masters in Giardia research".&nbsp; "WHAT?!?!?&nbsp; No FUCKING way!?!?" was my response.&nbsp; Turns out, she was describing my friend Cam, who's also from the Island (Amelia is from Nanaimo).&nbsp; She knew Cam when they were going to Malaspina together, 8 years ago!&nbsp; How crazy is that?&nbsp; That I move to a completely different city and find the one friend we have in common, completely by accident and introduction to each other by completely different friends?&nbsp; How weird.&nbsp; It turns out that Cam had sent her pictures of our big group hike at the beginning of June to Aylmer lookout.&nbsp; She had been admiring the purple flower picture, WHICH I TOOK WITH CAM' STOLEN CAMERA.&nbsp; Turns out that she must have seen the group picture but just not realized it was me, or something.&nbsp;  As well, Cam had stayed with Amelia and her boyfriend Daniel when he was interviewing in Vancouver for his various jobs.&nbsp; He had talked about visiting friends in Van but never mentioned their names.  The weirdest thing ever?&nbsp; Apparently, Cam had visited the crack house Amelia and I lived in in Kits, on West 11th Ave several times, WHILE I WAS LIVING THERE.&nbsp; The two of them had even gone on a hike to Cape Scott together while I was living there, and I remember seeing pictures of the hike. But do I remember Cam? Hell no.&nbsp; It would explain the weird deja-vu feeling that I have had though.  Weirder?&nbsp; Cam just phoned.&nbsp; Talk about the devil and he appears.&nbsp;

      Feel so much better today. Not quite 100%, but able enough that I went into the lab this morning, spent 6 hrs, and got the work done that I needed to do.&nbsp; Afterwards, I stopped off at the movie rental place, went and got chocolate chip cookies from the bakery (been craving them since yesterday, unfortunately they are not as good as mine), and got some bananas.  I still don't have my normal appetite, which is probably a good thing, considering I tend to eat a lot anyways.&nbsp; I can't even bear the thought of eggs, chicken or dairy products, any of which may have been the thing that made me sick.&nbsp;   3 sleeps until I'm home!&nbsp; I'm coming back to Vic from the 24th July to Aug 2nd, not nearly enough time, but about all I can spare right now. Time is tough for me as I have data to prepare for the conference in Singapore in September, and it doesn't look like it's going to happen soon enough.&nbsp; Oh well, my supervisor will be on my back about it soon enough.&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      I have the WORST CASE of the 24 hr bug.&nbsp; Felt like I was going to die last night, what with vomiting and diarrhea every 1/2 hr to hr.&nbsp; Didn't get any sleep, and seriously contemplated going to emerg. last night, except for the fact that I was so weak that I wouldn't have made the 10 min walk without vomiting or collapsing.&nbsp; Needless to say, I took today off, as I still did not feel well, and begged Stacy to bring me drugs.&nbsp; The sweetheart brought me some Kaopectate, which made my life bearable, and Gravol, which put me straight to sleep while quelling my stomach. I learned that Gravol is actually an antihistamine today, and that would explain why it knocks me out cold easily.&nbsp; It started yesterday in the lab at about 4 o'clock.&nbsp; I thought I was just getting an upset stomach due to my experiments going wrong at the last minute, but it got worse.&nbsp; Finished everything&nbsp;by 6:15 p.m, and left the lab.&nbsp; At that point,&nbsp;I got home and the vomiting started. No dinner for me.&nbsp; I couldn't even keep down water. After a while, the&nbsp;vomiting turned dark green due to bile (which happens after you've empitied your stomach and&nbsp;your intestines are blocked for some reason so the bile goes up into the stomach).&nbsp; I kept looking online&nbsp;to see if anyone recommended going to the doctor at this point.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your child vomits green vomit, you are supposed to&nbsp;go immediately (according to any child&nbsp;pediatrician).&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;nothing was said about adults. So I figured I'd just hold on and see how I felt.&nbsp;  Two&nbsp;Gravols later, I started to&nbsp;feel a little better. Havent' needed to take a Gravol&nbsp;since 4 pm., although&nbsp;my stomach still feels a little unsettled.&nbsp; But i'm finally starting to think of food, mainly in the form of chewy chocolate chip cookies.&nbsp; It's almost good that I'm so weak that I have no way of&nbsp;getting them from the store. I think&nbsp;the symptoms are consistent with Campylobacter infection, which is normally self-limiting in&nbsp;adults, and&nbsp;involves lots of vomiting and diarrhea.&nbsp; I think it was from the chicken soulvaki&nbsp;I had at stampede Saturday night at 1&nbsp;a.m.&nbsp; The chicken had already been cooked and was just&nbsp;sitting on a warm grill (perfect incubator for bacteria), and the tsatziki&nbsp;came from a tub, which I'm pretty sure was not packed in ice.&nbsp; Given that it was 32 deg that day, I wouldn't be surprised if that was what did it. I think i'm going to stick to food that is cooked right in front of me at stampede, like fries. None&nbsp;of these $7 campylobacter-loaded chicken soulvakis for me!&nbsp; &nbsp;

      This is to my gorgeous babe:&nbsp;Happy 6 years (tomorrow technically) *raises Coke to celebrate* !&nbsp; I can't believe we weathered this long, but I must say, all my shared moments with you are never dull and always interesting.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without you, I would have never had the support to follow my dreams, the intelligent and intuitive person&nbsp;to talk to when experiments&nbsp;go awry,&nbsp;and the shoulder to cry on when I can't deal with it alone.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would have never gone to amazing events where&nbsp;you hear the music first, then see the lights through the forest...drawing you in.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have never had heated discussions&nbsp;about physics, formulas, and chaos theory.&nbsp; I would have never discussed&nbsp;Darwinism,&nbsp;psychological theories, World War II, and hologram&nbsp;computers with the same person within weeks.&nbsp; I would have never had gone most of the way up the hellish 1300 m climb in Strathcona, I would have turned back far sooner if it wasn't for you helping me along.&nbsp; I would have never had such a fantastic dinner and movie companion, someone who&nbsp;never gripes&nbsp;about the dinner or the movie, and raves about it if it was&nbsp;great.&nbsp; I would have never&nbsp;had someone bring me a glass of wine in the bathtub when he knew I had a really bad day.&nbsp; I would have never had someone&nbsp;write me beautiful poems,&nbsp;or paint me pictures.&nbsp; I would have never&nbsp;had someone who understands my compulsion with cleanliness, and go out of&nbsp;his way to adhere to my crazy rules about where things go and how clean the house needs to be, despite the fact he would happily live much differently.&nbsp; I would have never had&nbsp;someone who never has a bad word to say about anything I cook (or burn, unless it's cookies).&nbsp; I would have never had someone to make me realize and work on my own faults.&nbsp; I would have never had someone who has the best taste in music, and plays me the records he loves.&nbsp; I would have never had someone willing to be dragged all over city and country on hikes and walks. I would have never had someone to appreciate the sound of the waves in Jordan River.&nbsp; I would have never had someone who stands for what he believes in, and is one of the most honest people I know.&nbsp; I would have never had someone who is&nbsp;wonderful to listen to when he laughs.&nbsp; I would&nbsp;have never had someone whose caress is the softest in the world.&nbsp;  &nbsp; You are a beautiful person, inside and out, and I am blessed to know you.&nbsp; &nbsp; These pictures are for you, some to make you remember, some to make you smile.&nbsp;

      ok this sux.&nbsp; Being at work when it's 31 deg outside, gorgeous, sunny without a cloud.&nbsp; But there is one very important reason beside the need to do science so I can leave for home next week that I am here.&nbsp; Air conditioning.&nbsp; My apartment doesn't have it, and work does.&nbsp; So I am basking here in the air conditioning, thinking I'd rather be outside, but knowing that I'd be fainting with the heat there.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I'm trying to make plans again to go to Shauna's lake, but I havent' been able to get a hold of her.&nbsp; It is just so friggin hot, i'm considering going swimming in the Bow River, which is glacial fed and NEVER warms up.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Stampede last night was lots of fun.&nbsp; I went with Rebecca, and we met up with her med student boyfriend, and his other med student friend and his fiance.&nbsp; All of these people rocked last night, it's finally nice to hang out with irreverent non-Calgarians my OWN age for once.&nbsp; People at work are all older than me, and a few have families and other ties that dont' allow them to go out.&nbsp; The "other med student friend" is named Huey, and his fiance is Emme, and she's supa cool.&nbsp; Younger than me by a year, but both her and Rebecca are a TON of FUN.&nbsp; We were all dancing to Nelly Furtado, going all crazy, and we got on the NEWS!!&nbsp; CFCN news (local station) caught us on camera.&nbsp; Although I'm not sure if it ended up on the cutting room floor or not.&nbsp; I had a glow stick from the conference in New Orleans that I cracked open, and I think that's what caught their attention.&nbsp; (one of the companies there makes fluorescent markers for proteins, and one of their give-aways was the coolest blue glow stick ever).&nbsp; Anyways, Rebecca, Emme and I have decided to go out dancing when I get back from Victoria in the beginning of August.&nbsp; I haven't been out to any clubs here, because frankly, I'm scared of the hoochie mamas, and the music is not reportably very good.&nbsp; But, unlike some people I know, I can enjoy&nbsp;a little top -40 music some times.&nbsp; Either way, I think it would be fun.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I have to get going as my acrylamide gel has polymerized, and I must go load it if I don't intend on spending all evening here. &nbsp;

      Here is a bunch of photos I just got developed.&nbsp; I have obviously not gotten the hang of inserting them into a single post, so there are 20 odd posts here.&nbsp; Sorry!&nbsp; Will figure it out eventually. I have many many more photos of the swamp tour we went on, and of the beautiful houses in the Garden District along the St. Charles Ave streetcar. Can post them if people want to see.

      The title says it all. Usually I don't get headaches that easily, but today was incredibly hot (28 deg C), and I think I got dehydrated carrying my groceries in the hot sun the 10 minutes from the train station.&nbsp;My head hurts every time i move, therefore it may be an early night. &nbsp; My night was pretty fantastic, as I shunned all work in favour of reading&nbsp;the latest Instyle, renting&nbsp;"Secret Window" and venturing outside my cool apartment to get Haagen Daz.&nbsp; I got the carmel brownie-vanilla&nbsp;ice cream flavour, hoping that it would be as good as my&nbsp;all-time favorite, vanilla swiss almond, but it's not.&nbsp; Too much caramel, not enough&nbsp;real vanilla ice cream.&nbsp; Yes, this is all an attempt to forget that fact that I am very very alone in Calgary.&nbsp; It&nbsp;worked for most of the evening.&nbsp; I should have gone out to a potluck I was invited to, but I didn't know most of the people, although that's never stopped me before.&nbsp; It was mainly that it is&nbsp;literally across town (a 20-25 minute&nbsp;drive from here,&nbsp;if I&nbsp;had a car).&nbsp; That&nbsp;and I have work early tomorrow (my choice to get there early, so I can leave at about 2 or 3 to go to Stampede with Rebecca, another student.&nbsp; We're going to see Nelly Furtado, which should be good.&nbsp; Not&nbsp;only do I like her music, but she's from Victoria,&nbsp;I knew a guy that dated her, and my best friend's parents rented a house from her uncle (and my best friend dated her cousin).&nbsp; Small world.&nbsp; Or am I just trying to figure out the 6 degrees of separation?&nbsp;  &nbsp; With any luck, I plan on being at Shauna's lake on Sunday.&nbsp; We were going to go today at 2, but she pisssed&nbsp;around work talking to people and didn't finish her work until 3:30.&nbsp; Then the boss showed up and wanted to talk to her. By 4 p.m., I was tired&nbsp;of waiting, and expected&nbsp;it to start hailing soon (they had forecast an evening thundershower which hasn't appeared&nbsp;yet,&nbsp;maybe that's why I have a headache).&nbsp; So I gave up all hopes of going to the lake, and made myself yummy vegetarian tacos instead.&nbsp; Shauna was leaving at 4 too, to go home, because we decided our tans wouldn't get that much work before dinner time.&nbsp; Dr. Woods was sitting outside the lab when I left. He joked that "no one seemed to be putting in a honest day's work", and quickly added that he didn't arrive at work until 3 p.m. himself due to a morning/afternoon golf game :). I gave him a black look and informed him that I was planning to work Saturday and Sunday anyways.&nbsp; He gave me a sheepish look in return.&nbsp; I know he wasn't accusing me of not working, he was totally joking.&nbsp; It's just funny the sort of repartee that we are able to have.&nbsp; According to Stacy, I'm far too friendly with him sometimes, and should have more fear and respect for him.&nbsp; I've worked for so many assholes that there isn't a whole lot that scares me anymore.&nbsp; That's not to say that i'm not scared shitless when it's obvious he's in a bad mood and he's coming straight towards me.&nbsp; But for the most part, he leaves me alone.&nbsp; As I'm sure James would tell me, there is no reason for anyone to be scared of any profs, because then they aren't doing their job. Actually, I've met a few that feel it is their job to scare undergrads, Dr. Woods&nbsp;and Dr. Buckley included.&nbsp;  &nbsp; The headache is taking over my head. Must go lay down.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      A man in a cowboy hat just walked past my apartment. May I say that Stampede is an endless source of amusement for me?&nbsp; I saw the most god-awful hat the other day, kinda modern cowgirl hat wtih a big huge fake flower below the brim at the back , to cover the hair, spray painted SILVER.&nbsp; Not just dull silver, but the glittery halloween silver.&nbsp; I have seen more cowboy boots and hats than I have ever seen in my life.&nbsp; Actually, I had never seen a real Stetson until this year.&nbsp;  &nbsp; In other news, I intend on going into work a little early tomorrow, so I can be done by 2 or 3 o'clock, so I can go to the lake with Stacy and Shauna.&nbsp; Calgary has NO REAL LAKES that aren't either glacial (and 1.5 hrs away by drive into the Rockies) or not mosquito infested kid-traps.&nbsp; Shauna lives in a subdivision, with a fake lake, which is decent.&nbsp; Not perfect, but it beats trying to get a tan in the common area in front of the 6 apartment buildings, waving to the people staring at me from teh basement suites.&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;

I love this "This person exposed themself in a public area, a clear violation of the law, and we needed to take some action on that, otherwise everybody would be dropping their pants."  I can only hope...the plane ride might get a whole helluva a lot funnier.

      Take the quiz:  urlLink "What Is Your Kink?"     Domination  You are most comfortable when in control. Having someone at your beck and call makes you hot. You can be very demanding, and expect perfection! In the bedroom, you take charge. Your motto is It's My way or the highway!  I don't really think this reflects me, but I'm not surprised when I see that the quiz only has 6 questions

      My bank accounts are slowly being siphoned away.  After a few days of letting the bills pile up on my desk, I decided to get the blood-letting over with and finally pay them. After paying telus, shaw internet, visa, and my rental insurance, I'm down about $500.  Not much for your average person, but when you considering that it is ONE-THIRD of what I earn monthly as a grad student, it kinda sucks.  Fortunately I have my savings, thanks to a kindly grandfather who gave me money, but I know many many many people who aren't nearly as lucky as me. As well, I'm still supported somewhat by my parents.  We have a joint account that I take money out of for plane tickets home.  That's all I use it for usually, however my mom still never lets me forget that without them....  well they're right.  I still haven't gotten it into my head that I'm a grad student who is now effectively working for less than Alberta minimum wage (what with all the hours I put in), and I really dont' have the money to do the things I do.  I have additional money from the government which covers my ass sometimes, because i'm a child of a disabled person (although if you met my mom, she doesn't act very disabled).  Usually I stay within what I get for teh month.  I usually spend either $40 above or below what I take in for the month.  However....that is including the gov money.  I really have to cut down on my spending and actually save some money for a change (or at least stop dipping into my savings).  I have been fortunate to be the only child of doting parents, and one of these days, I will wake up and realize that parental money is not always around.   I'm just not ready to wake up from the dream yet.

      This weekend has been one of the busier ones in a while.  After getting to bed at 3 a.m. sat night, I received a phone call at 9:30 a.m. Sunday from Stacy, asking if I wanted to go hiking.  Despite the hangover, and the fact that I only had 6 hrs sleep, I decided that it would be in my best interest to get out of Dodge and go hiking.  I figured the sweating would get the toxins out of my system deposited by the excess amount of alcohol the night before.  We went to Lillian Lake via Galatea Creek Trail, in Kananaskis.  These are not my pictures, as I didn't have my camera, but they give you an idea...         We had planned an easy hike, although it didn't turn out that way.  The first 4 km or so wasn't bad. However, teh last 1.5 km to the lake was not easy, mainly as it was straight up for some parts.  Multiply the fun by adding in the fact it was raining the entire time, and you have mud.  Actually, I really didn't mind the rain.  It kept me cool, and kept the heat away.  I wasn't planning on the mud, but it really did feel like a westcoast hike.  The only things missing?  The lack of ferns and no slugs on the trail.  Other than that, I could have easily been hiking in Strathcona. The hike was great, and we had brought fishing rods so we could fish at Lillian Lake.  I am one of those people who cool down really fast after outdoors exertion, so I froze at the lake watching Stacy and Jan fish.  Afterwards, we hiked down, involving a lot of mud and many more bridge crossings (this particular trail goes over Galatea creek on some very well built bridges 9 times).  In total, it was 12 km round trip, with 475 m elevation gain.  Not the highest or the longest trail I've done (that would be Aylmer Pass, which was 24 km round trip with 700 m elevation gain, or Flower Ridge in Strathcona with 5 km and 1100 m elevation gain), but one of the most beautiful. It was less typical of what you'd see in the Rockies, with less rock and more trees, but with all the rain I felt like I was almost home.

      ok, so I have had a leeeeetle too much vodka with my coke at the party tonight.  After 7.5 hrs of Stampede, I had enough, and Roberta, Greg and I went home.  I had exactly five min to get ready for Aaron's bbq/poker night, and I had enough time to lend them Shrek 2 before grabbing new shoes and getting them to drop me off at Aarons (a 15 min walk from here, but I had been walking all day anyways).  Unfortunately, despite inviting them in, they refused my invitations.  Their loss.  I walked around back and was confronted with 20+ people, some drinking, some playing hacky sack. Although this was a vicious version of hacky sack I've never seen before.  Once the sack has been hacked 7 times (no more than 3 hacks per person), the last person can wail it at another person of their choosing at full speed.  The only thing that is off limits is the head.  After several minutes of watching men wail small bean bags at each other, I soon struck up conversation with some of the other grad students/techs/various friends of Aaron. Thus started the drinking, which ended roughly 1/2 hr ago.  I had plans to hike 3 hrs to a lake tomorrow, fish with Stacy, hike back, but this may not happen as I'm so awake right now I may not get to bed until 3 a.m. at the earliest.  Finished 3/4 of my 750 ml bottle of vodka, which for those who know me, is a fair amount of alcohol for me (I'm generally a light weight).  This time, I stopped drinking when I was mildly soused, as opposed to New Orleans, where the drinks kept coming and coming. For those who dont' know that story, I had 3 Hurricanes at Pat o-briens.  These basically consist of 4 shots of rum plus red Kool-aid (better quality kool-aid, better tasting) per drink.  3 drinks over 4 hrs = Kyrsten passed out as soon as bed was touched.  THAT was a fucked up night. I'm still seeing pictures I dont' remember being taken, and this was in May.  Anyways, Aarons' was lots of fun, and I dont' think i have west nile yet from all the mosquitos that bit while I spent the evening outside.  A serological test is the only way to know....

      This is a supa-quick post to say that yes I'm still alive.  Last night was tons of fun, as a bunch of girls from work went out to celebrate a wedding of one of my fellow grad students.  It was very low key, but fantastic. Basically, we avoided all things Stampede, and went the high class route.  We went to Divino Wine and Cheese Bar downtown for a very expensive dinner, followed by dessert on 17th ave, then ended up at Kilkenny's in the NW for drinks and more talking.  A fantastic night which did not involve cowboy hats, but did involve more catcalls that I've ever got in one time period. Walking down 17th was an experience last night.  We were dressed up, and walking to the dessert bar, like 5 blocks.  EVERY car that passed had guys leaning out the windows, catcalling, or otherwise being unsubtle about it all.  I can't believe Stampede.  I think tonights going to be a gong show.    Today I'm actually willingly going to Stampede.  Fun, but I have a feeling that I will somehow end up in a cowboy hat.  Another person in the lab has offered a free breakfast to Roberta (the other grad student) if she can get photographic evidence of me in a cowboy hat and boots.  I'm not supposed to know this, but i'll do all I can help.  Still scares the living daylights outa me, because I KNOW this will be a picture shamefully displayed in the lab for all to see.    The best thing I saw last night?  Outside a bar, four waitresses walking down the sidewalk.  Wearing tight white baby t's, black hotpants, and PLEATHER CHAPS.  So classy.  Welcome to Calgary, home of the 18-year male version of sex!  I literally have no problems with sex on display, actually I think it's healthy.  But in this city, it's all about the young guys fantasy, nothing for women.    I had this really interesting talk last night with the four women I was out with.  Most are my age and one was 41.  They are all from Calgary or small town Alberta or Sasketchewan.  We were talking about nudity, and how they aren't comfortable with it.  I know it has a lot with how I was raised, but i'm often happiest when naked (with the blinds shut, or streaking past if they're not) at night. Main reason I don't want a roomate.  This one girl is getting married in Sept, and she was saying how she's never naked unless she's in the shower or just stepping out of it. And the other lady was saying that she was uncomfortable in anything less than a towel.  It got started because we were talking about how the men in our lives love to show off and run around buck naked most of the time.  I just found it so repressive and odd, that they were not comfortable enough to just go without the towel.  It makes me wonder what their sex life is like, if they are that repressed about even the nakedness.  I know the one girl getting married in Sept is apparently a virgin (she's very religious, a fact I didn't know until she left for the night), and I can't imagine how her first night is gonna be.  Her husband will be so repressed!  I just don't understand this mentality, coming from my flaming liberal hippie background, but I have been running into all this repression a lot in Calgary, especially with people from small towns.  I just think it isn't healthy, but that's just my take on it  Must go, as I have an appointment with a cowboy hat.

      The feast yesterday to celebrate my birthday went over incredibly well.  Not only did we have tons of food, not one dish was just "so-so", and everyone enjoyed themselves.  Now I am glad I got a table that can extend to fit 10 people around it, as it easily fit the eight people I invited.  Much good wine flowed freely, and the girls just ended up talking for three hours or so about careers, kids, science in general. So much talking that we never even got to the movies I have.  It went so well I'm considering doing this on a monthly basis.  I love entertaining.  People often think i'm a little nuts because I often start cleaning up during the party, and do it while I talk to people.  I guess it makes them a little uncomfortable, but my kitchen is not big enough for more than two people anyways.  The fact is, I'm happiest when I can sit cleaning in the kitchen, talking to some people, and listening to the fun that people are having around me.  I love holding parties and making people happy.    So many people commented that my place looks like an IKEA showroom, and I guess it does just a little.  I love bright colour, and often despair that I am not able to paint the walls in my apartment.  Instead, I have splashes of colour everywhere..a red and gold carpet, red pillows, brightly coloured pictures on the wall...etc.  As well, many people commented on how beautiful my china is. I have a set of dishes/tea set that James started for me.  I just told them all that my boyfriend has exquisite taste when it comes to housewares for me :)  And he does.  Well, this exhausted girl must go to bed. I have been incredibly busy and moving around/cleaning for teh past two days, and now i'm paying for it.  Thank god tomorrow is Friday. I"m actually planning on taking the weekend off this weekend.  A full weekend. I shouldn't, but damnit I need it.

      Take this quiz! http://hokev.brinkster.net/quiz/default.asp?quiz=Better+Personality&page=1  This is what I got: Wackiness: 28/100 Rationality: 50/100 Constructiveness: 34/100 Leadership: 44/100    You are an SEDF--Sober Emotional Destructive Follower.  This makes you an evil genius . You are extremely focused and difficult to distract from your tasks. With luck, you have learned to channel your energies into improving your intellect, rather than destroying the weak and unsuspecting.  Your friends may find you remote and a hard nut to crack. Few of your peers know you very well--even those you have known a long time--because you have expert control of the face you put forth to the world. You prefer to observe, calculate, discern and decide. Your decisions are final, and  your desire to be right is impenetrable.  You are not to be messed with. You may explode.   (italics and bold added by me)  muhahahaha!!!! I will take over the world!  One experiment at a time....

      So I finally broke down and bought a new TV and DVD player.  I've been relying on my computer as my complete entertainment centre for about a year now, and on and off for the past five years (i.e. only when I dont' live with james and the surround sound).  Lately my computer has been screwing up and not recognizing there IS a sound card installed.  Roughly 2 out of 5 times I start my computer, it says there is no audio device installed.  The only way to fix it? To turn off teh computer completely, and to turn it on again. This has to be done until it works again, usually 1-2 times.  I am waiting for the day that I will have no sound ever again.  After renting movies last night and having this happen to me yet again, I decided to get a new TV and dvd player.  I talked to my mom about it, and she offered to lend me the money!  YAY!!    Cam, another grad student, and I went to IKEA, where I bought a tv stand.  Then we stopped at Future Shop (he made himself leave his wallet in the car otherwise HE WOULD have bought something) where I picked out the TV I was stalking on the internet since last night (looked at it like 5 times last night trying to make up my mind).  We got them to take one out of the back for us.  Then we realized that the box was the LARGEST box we'd ever seen, and there was no way in hell that we'd fit it into the back of a Dodge Spirit, much less the backseat.  The box was large enough to fit 3 illegal migrants, or 4 small children, comfortably.  I have NEVER seen a box this large.  And the TV wasn't that big!  My parents' 32 inch tv came in a smaller box!  To finish off the shopping trip, with me all dejected, we went to Costco where I bought tons of vegetables, and more chicken than I've ever bought in one shopping trip (for Wednesday).    This large box required some thinking.  Then Cam remembered that Aaron, a postdoc friend, had a Tracker that should have enough room to fit the box from hell. We just show up at Aaron's, where he was just sending a friend off who had stayed the weekend.  Aaron was totally cool, and came with me to pick up the TV from a closer Future Shop.  It took us 15 minutes to fit it into the Tracker, with the sales guy, Aaron, and myself tugging and pulling.  But it finally fit.  We phoned up Cam once we were back here, and the guys moved it in for me.  Cam set it all up while I made dinner for both of them, because they were so cool to help me out.  I felt like such a helpless princess today.  I literally did nothing but carry my purse and look beautiful.  The heaviest thing I carried was the TV stand, and that was only to the front door from the car. So spoiled.  I did make an awesome dinner to make up for it.  After dinner, we decided to get some use of it, and watched "catch me if you can".  I kinda wanted to watch Cold Mountain that Cam just burned for me, but apparently he just watched it last week and didn't want to watch it again.  Spoilsport :)  Anyways, a busy day of shopping was had by me.  I'm pretty tired now, and I think the Grapes of Wrath are calling me (the book!).

      Watched two very different movies. Mystic River was amazing, although I was not surprised given the actors in the film (Kevin Bacon, Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Lawrence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden).  All of the performances were excellent, especially those by Sean Penn and Tim Robbins.  It is a very moving picture at times, and has some interesting twists.  City of God was awesome as well.  Very gory, but it showed the life of street gangs in a Rio de Janiero slum known as the City of God.  A very bleak place, this movie traces the main character during his childhood in the City of God in the sixties, until the 1970s.  The huge usage of guns in the movies, especially by what North Americans term children, is mind-blowing.  Movies like this reimind me just how lucky I was to be born into a relatively well-off family in North America, in a country where violence like this is not seen every day, where child gangs do not kill off all their rivals to become the "bosses" of the city.    It makes me wonder what choices I would have to make if I had been born in such an area, and not had the good fortune in landing in the particular family I did.  Of all the places in the world I could have been born, to all the families I could have been born to, I am so fortunate to be where I am.  Guess I did some good stuff in a past life :)

      Did I mention just HOW MUCH IT HAS BEEN RAINING here lately?  It's fantastic!  The air smells great, the salt and crap has been washed off the road, everything is beautifully green, and the humidity is mercifully high (yay no moisturizer!).  Except for the fact that the rain comes with the thunderstorms, which means that it is hot out.  Hot and humid, not fun when you have to wear a lab coat in a building where the A/C is temporarily non-functioning.  My mom still doesn't understand why I don't just wear nothing underneath the lab coat, but that would defeat its purpose.  It's meant as another layer that I can get wet with a whole lot of water (seemed to keep getting myself wet today)  But it has cooled down for a while with the rain, and it sounds wonderful with the windows open. Going to sleep well tonight.

      Hmmm...well I feel like I missed out or something. I saw people wearing red and white yesterday and it didn't do anything to twinge my memory, until I saw a guy wearing a Canadian flag as a cape.  There were fireworks last night too apparently, but I was too exhausted to go see them.  I heard some "pop, pop, pop" last night but just chalked it up to the crazy neighbours.  Until I heard the car horns honking.  Calgarians seem to have this affinity for honking their horns for any sort of event.  When the Flames were in the playoffs, it was friggin' loud for about a 1/2 hr after each game.  Last night it was pretty loud too.  It doesn't help that I live next to the TransCan, but I never usually hear anything car related unless there's some event.  I bet there'll be car honking for the next lameass Stampeders game too.    Went to see Spidey 2, that was very good.  Cam and Aaron were supposed to go with me tonight, but they both ditched me in favor of the lobsters that Cam brought back from PEI yesterday.  I've been officially ditched in favor of food.  I must be losing my looks.  Benchamas was also ditched, so we decided to screw both Cam and Aaron by going to see Spidey 2 ourselves, then proceed to tell them all about it ;)It was really refreshing to leave work at 3 p.m.  I haven't done that in months.  Yesterday I left at 4:15 too; I'm getting downright brash with the time off!  Had finished all my books, so I went to get more at the used bookstore. Picked up "The God of Small Things" by Arundhati Roy, and "Grapes of Wrath" by Steinbeck.  Novels are so much more enjoyable when they are not assigned in class.  I read East of Eden in english one year, and enjoyed Steinbeck's writing.  Rare for an English class book.    Oh, and with all this time off, I also intend on taking Sunday off.  It'll be my first day off (usually I go into the lab for a minimum of 4 hrs per weekend day) since I got back from New Orleans, in mid-May.  I need at least one day to sleep in. I haven't slept in until noon since I went home in mid-April.  I need it.  I also need to go to Ikea to pick up cool napkins and placemats for the dinner party on my birthday.    time off is a great healing thing.  I love the lab, but damn I need to get out sometimes, as I'm becoming a mole.

        Ever since I was a young child, I have always loved driving at night.  I think it has something to do with my parents using car rides to settle me to sleep as a child, but I absolutely love driving at night to somewhere else. Sometimes I like to drive, other times I like to be driven.  There is something so beautiful about a city at night, especially Calgary downtown...the mist surrounding the buildings was breathtaking tonight. Of course, it doesn't even begin to compare with the mist on the west coast, rolling in off the ocean, after a long drive to jordan river.  Driving at night was also the way we started most, if not all, of the trips with the family. Getting up at 5 in the morning to get on the first ferry, or to drive up island to tofino. Leaving later in the day doesn't just seem as magical to me. There is something about watching the sun rise as I am driving to a far off destination that captivates me and makes me feel alive.  Watching the sun rise slowly during the night at an outdoor rave is also one of the most spectacular things I will ever witness during my lifetime. How many people really watch it rise, with the person they love, listening to music that surrounds them with feeling?  The sun rise is the reason I will always be a morning person./a

      well, I don't fully understand how it can go from a maximum of 14 deg two days ago to 24 deg today, from fog and rain to beautiful sunshine.  It's supposed to hit 29 deg for the next four days, including the weekend, with all hope.  I have plans to take the kitty for her free vet exam on saturday, do a little work in the lab, then take off on sunday to go hiking.  Course that was the plan last weekend too, and that didn't pan out so well.  My mom's coming to visit in exactly 12 days, and i'm supa excited.  I enjoy spending time with her, and so I think it'll be a few days of visits to IKEA and guaranteed good food.  maybe i'll actually get to drive to the mountains for once!

      Well, there's a new bundle of fur around the house, and so far, she hasn't wrecked anything :).  Her name was originally Missy, which I hated, so I changed to something similar sounding, Mystaia. She's been a little sneezy lately, and I hope it's only a mild cold and not feline upper respiratory virus, which can get worse.  She doesn't have a huge appetite, despite the fact they told me she should lose a few pounds.  I'm taking her for her free vet exam in the next ten days, if I can get an appointment, and will talk it over then. She's the sweetest cat ever...starts purring the minute you pet her, and she's good around people.  I'll post pictures when I have them.

      In an attempt to keep myself from gaining many many pounds by making myself large portions of risotto, I invited 3 friends over for dinner.  Last night I had an awesome dinner at Greg and Roberta's, where we began to plan our trip after the conference in Singapore in September.  To return the favour, I invited them over to my house for MY cooking.  I made a grape, honey roasted pecan, goat cheese salad with spring greens with a honey lemon vinagrette (with a touch of curry powder) to start, which was amazing, if I do say so myself.  I bought my first ever cook book today, one that actually has good receipes.  I normally never buy cook books because I refuse to buy a book with receipes that only have three ingredients.  I use receipes to make the difficult things, with 10 or more ingredients such as stews, or to learn new techniques like how to make a great risotto, not to figure out a new way to steam green beans with a slightly different vinagrette.  Chapters had a huge sale on today, and I found this amazing cook book that was only $6.99!  urlLink http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/1552853357/qid=1091943325/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/702-6377050-7694460  This is the best cool receipe book I've found in a while, other than the insanely expensive Williams-Sonoma series.  It has receipes like "Arugula Pecan Pesto Dip with Crispy Won Ton Wrappers", "Black Bean and Roasted Banana Dip", "Cashew-Crusted Scallops with Asian Vegetable Salad", "Leek, Corn and Stilton Chowder", "Spicy Braised Plums and Cabbage", "Vegetable Strudel on an Oyster Mushroom Sauce", "Three point Cambozola Cheese Tartlet with Port Wine-Spiked Figs".  It also includes receipes for making your own ravioli, crispy flat breads, stocks, vinagrettes, etc.  These are just some of the receipes, a lot of them are for meat (most of which I wouldn't eat, but some can be adapted for chicken).  I'm very impressed, because normally I cannot find a cookbook in which I like more than 2 receipes. Tonight, as a main course, I made my mom's cumin-rubbed grilled chicken (so damn good), and made a mushroom risotto from the cookbook. The only risotto I've ever made was from a box, one of those freeze-dried versions.  This was the easiest to make!  It tasted fantastic too.  I think i'll make it for company more often, because it only takes 1/2 hr, and people love it.  There are so many versions I can make. As a dessert, we had french vanilla ice cream and fresh blueberries.  Overall, it was a fantastic dinner, and good conversation was had.  I can't believe it's already midnight.  Time for me to go to bed, as I have plans to go hiking tomorrow.  Must work off the cream and butter in the risotto!

      Check out this quiz (on  urlLink www.okcupid.com )  urlLink http://www.okcupid.com/personality?type=RGLD&amp;g=2&o=1&amp;h=180   Bold  is my response.  The Window Shopper  Random   Gentle   Love   Dreamer  (RGLDf)     Loving, hopeful, open. Likely to carry on an romance from afar. You are The Window Shopper.     You take love as opportunities come, which can lead to a high-anxiety, but high-flying romantic life. You're a genuinely sweet person, not saccharine at all, so it's  likely that the relationships you have had and will have will be happy ones.   Yup they've all been happy for the most part, mainly the last one.    You've had a fair amount of love experience for your age , and there'll be much more to come.  6 years of it so far!   Your exact opposite:The Stiletto   Deliberate   Brutal   Sex   Master     Hmmm...that sounds like my friend Trudi !  Part of why we know this is that, of all female types, you are the most prone to sudden, ferocious crushes. Your results indicate that you're especially capable of obsessing over a guy you just met.  Yup, that's totally me.  I obsess over everything, not just guys.   Obviously, passion like this makes for an intense existence. It can also make for soul-destroying letdowns.      Your ideal match is someone who'll love you back with equal fire, and someone you've grown to love slowly.  I lusted after James' brain from the start, but it definitely grew into love when I realized what a kind and compassionate person he was.   A self-involved or pessimistic man is especially bad. Though you're drawn to them, avoid artists at all costs. BEWARE: The Hornivore CONSIDER: The Gentleman, The Loverboy   Holy shit!  I know this sounds weird, but this totally sounds like me.  Hmmm... I think James is a total artist...should I avoid him?  Can't...too... drawn!  It's like an undercurrent!

      I am on my way to owning my first cat (or it owning me...I don't know)!  I have had cats before, when I still lived with my parents, and have been catless for 4 years now.  I miss the companionship, and having the friendship of another animal (who I contend is just as smart as humans, although without the capacity for human speech).  James and I wanted to get cats when we lived together, but we were moving so much, and i didn't feel like I was in a place that I would be staying for long enough, to be fair to the cat.  I'm stuck here for another 4 years, and as I love my apartment and they are cool with cats, I've decided to get one.  I was going to get one after Singapore in September, but I have about 3 friends lined up to take care of the cat while I'm gone.   Still have to get the food, carrier and cat.  But I have all the rest!

      Surprisingly, Calgary is still WAY more green than Victoria was.  There are no beautiful flowers like Victoria has, or any REAL gardens, but it is overall more green.  I just got home an hour ago, and haven't even unpacked my bags.  But I have ordered my groceries online from Sunterra market for dinner.  I got in the order just under the wire, and thus should get delivery tonight.  If not, well then I may just starve.  I have nothing real to eat other than dry pasta and classico sauce, which, after not having had any lunch or a very large breakfast, is starting to sound fantastic.  Oh, and I have a few mini-Babel cheeses and stale crackers.  I should really have forethought and leave tortellini in the fridge.  But I do have a lot of Coke.   A quick summary of my heavenly week with James in Vic: Saturday:  Got into town at 1 p.m., hung out watching tv until luminara at 11 p.m., wandered around luminara, went home, went to sleep on the comfiest foam mattress anywhere (I should have taken it instead of the futon that requires the beating of two sumo wrestlers to pump it up so I don't feel my hips on the wood below).   Sunday:  Got up late with James, went to Munro's to get bargain books (King Leopold's Ghost, a history of the Congo, and Devil in the White City, about an architect and a serial killer in Detroit in the 1900s), accidently wandered into the Northwest Deuce Days...only the COOLEST collection of cars from the 30s and 40s (a lot of roadsters).  Went to James' parents for dinner, where they forgot I don't usually eat seafood (but the shrimp was small and not too fishy) (beggars can't be choosers).  Monday:  James was at work until 2.  I spent the day with my mom, got home at 4:30 after a day of visiting my dad's new construction site in Sooke, seeing the show homes, shopping for clothes for mom, sitting in their new tub built out on a deck that overlooks the forest and the valley below and generally exhausting my mom.  Made an awesome pizza with tomatos, spinach, yellow pepper and goat cheese.  Went to my first ever Kundalini Yoga class with Kerry, Monika and James, which was very rewarding.  It was the perfect setting...with the sun setting through the windows while the class was being held, symbolizing the increasing relaxation and loosening of muscles and brain.  James is now officially The WestCoast Guy.  I mean, the guy does Yoga willingly!  He looked like such a yummy yoga guy...I'm not sure if he should be allowed to go again alone, as the girls certainly check him out there! jk :):):)  Tea afterwards at Serious Coffee on Yates, then a nice walk home.  Tuesday:  Hung out with my mom again.  James was to have karate, so I stayed for dinner.  Karate was cancelled at the last moment, so I ate dinner and my parents gave me a ride home (they live way the HELL out in langford, 4 km from the nearest bus).  Monika had phoned and invited us out to the beach earlier, but she didnt' end up coming until later.  Charles came by, drove us to the liquor store where I bought copious amounts of wine.  Several glasses later, I stumbled/danced my way down the dallas road cliffs to the beach, where we sat for a while.  Monika and Charles wanted to go to Jen's, as she had just broken up with Bakar, but I was exhausted, and happy that James didnt' feel like going out either.  Wednesday: we woke up late, about noon, and just hung out in the house for the day.  I went to get some more beads for the necklaces I had planned with my mom on the tuesday.  I did a fair amount of suntanning, reading, watching tv.   Thursday:  James was at work again, and I decided to just hang around the house. I attempted to go for a walk with my camera, and got a few pictures, but my shoes were hurting me, and it was the saddest shortest walk I've done in a while.  I suntanned in the afternoon, attempting to banish most of my tanlines (except the "bottom" lines, I have neighbours with windows, for goodness sakes!)  James' parents took us and my parents out to dinner at a fantastic restaurant in Brentwood Bay, Carden St. West.  If you have not been there, run, don't walk!  Amazing food.  My mom and I shared a salad with this amazing lemon-mint vinagrette, real bacon bits and smoked chicken.  For my entree, they had spicy thai green curry with prawns and scallops.  I gave the prawns to James in trade for some scallops...I can eat Digby scallops as they dont' taste like the sea, but prawns are still a stretch for me.   Friday:  Went and visited my dad's job site again, hung out with my mom, enjoyed the sun, drove the back roads from Sooke.  My mom lent me the car for the weekend, which was awesome.  I drove home from her place only to realize that she had left her only pair of sunglasses in the car.  After seeing James off to karate, I drove back home, hung out with my dad who had just gotten home, and then after an hour or so drove back to the city.  From the time I received the car, till the time I returned it today, I drove 800+ kms.  Most of it was Saturday. Received a phone call from my best friend Amber, who just happened to invite us out of the blue to a party she was having at her new rental house out in the country off West Burnside.  It was late, and it looked like plans to eat at the Mint were going to fall through, due the fact that james worked ALL day and then did 1.5 hrs of karate and was generally exhausted.  I asked her out for a late dinner (9 p.m) and drove out there to pick her up.  We had a fantastic time, and went for a drive afterwards to appreciate the sea breeze, good conversation, and the stereo.  I drove a sleeping Amber back to her house at 1 a.m., and made a pact to go out with her again when I am back in town for Thanksgiving.  She's one of those fantastic friends who I can call after not talking for 6 months or a year, and it can be like NO TIME PASSED AT ALL.  We almost can finish the same conversation we were having, it seems like.  There is no weirdness about not phoning or emailing, there is just good times.  I have known her so long (20 years now) that we act like sisters...having not had any siblings, it's kinda nice to have one that will ALWAYS be there for me, and will never fight with me like some siblings do.  Saturday:  woke up at 9 a.m., was on the road to Long Beach by 9:30.  Drove the 5 hrs to Long Beach, and dallied on the Beach with James for 3 hrs before we decided to drive home.  We had planned camping for that weekend, but I didn't want to pay $40 for a campsite, or reserve one for 3 nights when we wanted only one.  It was the most magical experience ever, spending quiet time with the man I love, on the beach.  Poor James managed to get a sunburn despite the cloud cover.  I fell asleep several times to the sounds of the waves, with my feet encased in warm sand, being warmed by the sun.  James showed me some of the  kata  from Karate that he has been doing, and I managed to get a few shots with my camera.  Hopefully they turn out.  I'm still waiting for the pictures from the last time james was at long beach, in the role of surfer boy.  Where are those pictures?  Monika?  :)  Sunday:  attempted to get up early to drive the car back to the parents...failed miserably and got up at 11.  cuddled in bed for what felt like blissful hours.  Got up, suntanned, read, watched james play a new game (star wars galaxies....his avatar looks disturbingly like him), watched Red Dragon, went to bed at midnight.  Monday:  Up at 9 (like most days on my vacation), showered, crawled back into bed and tried to forget that I was going to be 1000 kms away in mere hrs.  Flight over the Rockies was spectacular as per normal.  The only snag was when the airporter wanted to charge me $25 to get me to the university.  I have done this trip by the airporter 5+ times for $17, and I can get a PRIVATE taxi to do it for $24.  They were nice enough to give it to me for the old rate, but they made me wait 35 min for the bus to fill up.  Oh well, all for the saving of 7 dollars.  My groceries should be arriving soon..my order is being filled as I write this.  WAHOOO!!!!!!!!!
