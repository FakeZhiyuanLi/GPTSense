      hello everyone-long time no post, eh?let me see-i don't think i've posted since monday night, so let me think about what has happened since then- tuesday-we had a game against lakeland, yes it was away. Although they are a really good team, i thought we played really well against them, but we lost 10-6. Congratulations Kristen Brenner, who had her first goal, she was really excited. I had 2 right handed goals (im a lefty) and sar had a fricken awesome assist to one of them. Seriously-it was beautiful..she drew 2 defenders, while faking a crease roll, and one of the defenders she drew, which was mine, when to cover her, n i went to goal-it was awesome, and im glad she gave me the nod to go cuz i didn't even notice it-lol. today-it was a pretty good day, and it was soo nice out!I came in late..yes it was maybe my 32 time doing that, no exaggeration either. SO yeah like i was saying, today wasn't a bad day at all. It actually went by pretty quick. After school, i had to make up a math test, and then i was off to practice, just kinda late. My coach was bitching at me though cuz i'm always late to school, n he told me that hes having my first period teacher write down whenever i'm late n give it to him. He's such a homo when he does that shit, i'm passing math easily so i dont understand why its such a big deal if i'm late once or maybe twice a week. But whatever-after practice Jamie and I went to the mall to challll n get some stuff.We sat on the thru-way for maybe a half hour--badddd traffice..but neways  We literally went on a sandal shopping spree at old navy which was pretty fun, n went to hot topic, where we saw joe n agovino, i bought a shirt there, n then made her return it 10 minutes later..good times..good times. Then on the way home, she let me practice for my road test, which is friday, n i did some parallel parking, i actually wasn't that bad. But whatever-tomorrow is the YELLOWCARD and SOMETHING CORPORATE concert..i cannot wait!!!My friends and I are taking a 30 person stretch excursion limo there and back. It's gonna be sooooo much fun-basically all of north rockland is going lol. But i'll let you all know how that goes-i'm going to bed..goodnight!!  "..tell all my friends i'm dead, it won't be long before you forget my name.."  P.S-tomorrow's Amanda's birthday!!!!!!

      whatsss reallllllly good?haha-its raining, yes pouring, and i hate it. Although, it did get our lacrosse team out of practice at 345 instead of 515, which was awesome. All we did was do wall ball, quick sticks, and then run a mile and a half as a team, which wasn't bad at all.School wasn't bad, pretty boring though..ahh i almost forgot-  HAPPY BIRTHDAY JOE! i made him such a hott card, seriously, it was all pink, ahh too cute!-i was definitely proud, n he probably didn't even read it yet lol. Well back to my school day-gym was pretty fun, but i was kinda beastly when i played 3 pointer knock out with some seinor boys. I was a little embarassed cuz i was winning,so basically i looked like a man. Umm after that, nothing really important went on during the day. Welllllllll..right now i'm gonna finish helping chris make macaroni and cheese..(yes he's 17 and still doesn't know how) and then eat dinner, n babysit..i will keep ya posted with everything that goes on tomorrow!  p.s- thursday  is the yc and soco concert!!can't wait!!     -and  friday  is my road test!!  "..i'm so deceptive.."

      oh god-where do i even start..how about right here..this weekend seriously SUCKED. i always do this to myself-saying "this" i mean..getting my hopes up so high, and then everything falls through.ahh what can i do..    Friday-coach guccione let us out of practice at 3:45..which was awesome, n i seriously couldn't have asked for anything better at that time to be honest with you. All we did was run a timed mile, n then do quick sticks (which me n dams did horrible at..the freshmen beat us everytime lol)After practice, i went to gavs to see her before prom, and then i went to dom's with gavs family to see everyone. Everyone looked gorgeous, especially danielle. When i got home from Dom's..my brother, my mom, and I were watching homevideos..(yes this was a friday night) n then dams came over before we went out. We didn't go out until maybe 945 when Perry and Brittany picked us up, n we just went to wendys, n then to a&p. Ugh-that really sucked cuz it was pouring, so basically me dams n britt stayed in perrys car the whole time. Dams came back to my house n slept over n then we went to practice the next morning.    I left practice early saturday cuz it was my little brothers confirmation, and i was his sponsor..how cute, right? I could not find nething to wear, cuz none of my skirts "should be worn in church" according to joanne martin-so my mom made me wear this black n white express dress..it was cute but not exactly what i wanted to wear.The funny thing is, is that as i was getting up to go up to the bishop with my brother, sven lonergan tells me i have white shit on my ass, which is highly noticeable in a black dress. When danielle notices, she starts slapping my ass in front of everyone in the church..i was definitely almost crying with laughter. What good times we always make, even in church. But the confirmation wasn't that boring, i got to chill next to my brother, tj, n danielle..my bro n danielles bro were actually being really funny when they kept saying mrs.doherty was going up for seconds for the host-lol but neways..Joanne n Leo decided to give kevin a family party, so ofcourse the fam n some neighbors came over to celebrate, even though i was sleeping almost the whole time..(my mom never wakes me up).      At like 7:30, Caitlins dad came n picked me up cuz we were going to Jill's sweet 16 at the Comfort Inn. She looked beautiful!and it was a lot of fun. When my mom picked me cait dams n matt up, n we got home, caitlin n i soon came to find out that there was also a hotel party goin on there, eric n mike tell us that after we leave, which sucked cuz the rest of the night me n cait just ate all the leftover food from my bros party, n then went to sleep. It was a fun night.     Now i'm getting ready for my driving lesson with Mr.Vann and sar, and then drivers ed with all my pals. I can't wait til Thursday, and Friday! Thursday is the yellowcard and soco concert and we're taking a 30 person excursion stretch limo, its gonna be sooooo phat, and friday is my road test!ahh i can't wait, i hope i pass but i dunno lol-i shouldnt have told as many people as i did when it actually was, cuz then if i fail, everyone will know-lol well i'm gonna go get ready..cyaaaa  "let your waves crash down on me, and  take me away .."

We won i think 13-4 n i had 3 goals..holla acha gurl!after our game i just babysat n i actually just got in..which is absolutely horrible news. I'm gonna go to bed though cuz i'm so extremely tired-goodnight

      heyyyy everyone-haven't posted in a couple of days, but dont worry, nothing too exciting happened. Lets see.. yesterday  was pretty good. School was alright, at practice though, we did a timed mile (6:33) yeah man not bad, but after it i felt so sick.But whatever, after practice my mom picked me n dams up and she took me to get my nails and toes done..which was awesome cuz i REALLY  needed  that- Today ..hmm-it was alright..I was kinda in an ambitious mood, but that didn't last til practice. I had a bball meeting after school before practice, which went pretty well. We were all just figuring out what camp we were gonna go to, ehh can't wait for that..right. Well, i just finished eating, im gonna get some homework done, and then go babysit. Tomorrow i have a lacrosse game at 6pm at the highschool..u fans better be there!   "this awkward silence makes me crazy.."

      sup?today was such a beautiful day!i'm so excited its getting warmer so soon i'll be sooo tan!lol-well whatever, school was alright today. I woke up kinda late n had to take a shower this morning so i just jumped out n didnt even do my hair that good, but many people complimented it so i think i might do that more often. There's not really much to say about today besides we ended having a lacrosse scrimmage against Nanuet at the last minute. Although we weren't much prepared, we won 12-4 im pretty sure, and i had 3 goals! After my scrimmage my bro, ralph, and i went to wendys n taco bell which was really funny when my brother almost cursed off the man there. Then, i had to babysit at 730 n i ended up baking brownies for kaylas bake sale tomorrow, which wasn't bad at all. I felt so sick when i got home now, and now im about to go to bed cuz i just finished my homework-seeee yaaaaaa  "..this is what living like  this  does.."

      omg wow-this weekend was sooo much fun! sorry i havent posted in a couple of days but i've been really busy-Hmm let me see..friday after practice and jill's pasta party Jamie, Amanda, and Gavin came to pick me up so we could all chall..we went to wendys til like 1130 n then went to cheety's house(is that how u spell his name?)well whatever..although cheety's party was a chip&dip party it was still soooo much fun!Everyone was dancing, so ofcourse, my friends n i went out there too. I even got seth and perry to dance, it was a little weird considering the people surrounding us, but it was definitely a fun experience, although they were both drunk. Saturday morning we had a lacrosse game against scarsdale-ehh it was a hike to get there but we won 8-3 and i had 2 goals..it was a really good game. Our team is getting better i think, but then sometimes when i trip over sarahs stick in the middle of the game, i dont know what to think lol- but dams and i had the HOTTEST double team..the other team probably thought we were dykes cuz after the whistle blew she kept slapping my ass saying.."yeah kel you know how we do!" and so on and so forth. After my game i came home n challed, got some lunch with my bro, and then my mom took me to get a new cell phone-its seriously such a hott phone, but the bitch at the store forgot to activate it, so now i have a new phone but i cant make outgoing or receive calls-it sucks but my dad will go fix that problem tomorrow. Last night was Jessica's sweet 16 at the hilton inn. It was sooo much fun, especially when the fire alarm went off cuz of the smoke machine the DJ had-everyone in the hotel had to evacuate, n the firemen came lol-good times, good times. After Jess', some people went back to Brett's house to all chall. It was soooo much fricken fun! I took a couple of shots, 1 with seth, another by myself lol, n then everyone baked brett's room. I wasn't smoking, but everyone swears i was high-there were maybe like 5 blunts going around in his room lol. So ofcourse, like always, i fell asleep and woke up at 430 in the morning to danielle telling me we have to go to her sisters lol..so we all walked up to deli central (it was actually open) and then gav n i took a cab to her sisters n just passed out when we got there. I seriously had SOOO much fun lol-Now i'm home, just got in from mcdonalds n the shoprite parking lot(like old times) with gav n her mom n all the girls r about to go chall at the park cuz its such a nice day out, then i'm off to drivers ed which is always boring as fuck. But i'm gonna get going, i will keep ya posted with everything!  "..this all was only wishful thinking.."

      today wasnt a bad day at all.-i actually stayed awake in all my classes and didnt even come close to dozing off once, which is probably a first.Umm..let me see-i slammed my nail in my locker today which hurt really bad so now i need to get them done sooner than i was expecting to..but what can you do. Human development was fun when kristina, erica, and i were telling mrs.newborn that oprah and the olsen twins were either anorexic or bulimic..she believes almost everything we say to her lol-she even thinks kristina saw a bald eagle on her deck one morning..which is hard to believe considering the fact they are extinct..but neways..after school mike agovino drove me home cuz i didn't wanna stay til 4 doing nothing so i went home n challed for a little then went back to the school for my game..(thanks to everyone who came!)..we won 10-0 but i just played so bad. 3 goals of mine didn't count cuz i was in the crease after and i was soooo pissed -but i finally scored a goal that counted which made me happier but i dunno i was just in such a bad mood and i felt like i was gonna cry if something else went wrong. WHen i got home, i went straight to the callanans to babysit til 10pm..yeah it was a late night there tonight for some reason, and now i'm just online talking to joe alimo..its always fun chatting with him. I think im gonna go to bed though in a bit, mom said she'd drive me in late on account of my insomnia..Ehh tomorrow's friday-i'm happy but im upset cuz i know nothing is gonna go on cuz nothing ever does...hopefully i'm wrong. Oh yeah-i heard about chittys..remember that in the beginning of the year?haha..well i'll keep you all posted.. p.s-can't wait for jess' sweet 16 sat!!!  "..i heard about your regrets..i heard that you were feeling sorry..i heard from someone that you wished you could set things right between us-i guess i should've heard of them from you.."

      i can honestly say that i never remembering ever being this tired. Every period today i felt like just falling asleep, but it's kinda hard for me to do that in school. Today seriously just sucked. We didn't play yorktown cause of the rain but we still had to do a time mile which i did pretty well..6:47-not as good as last time, but not bad. But seriously-i think my day got so much worse at practice when i got pegged in the boob n then in the chin-i wanted to murder someone..you have no idea how much that hurts-Now i'm just like hanging out here waiting for my dad to bring me home pizza..then im off to babysit..hopefully when i get home i'll be able to go to sleep, which hasnt been happening lately-well wish me luck on that-i'll keep ya posted!  "you'll be sorry..isn't that what they'll say? don't follow your heart 'cause it just seems to get in your way.."

      will it ever stop raining? It's april, and I can't even wear cute spring outfits becuz of this weather. Ugh-it's so depressing. Well anyways, I think i'm becoming a bad student. Dont get me wrong, I go to class every period, but now I just don't do anything. First period i have math, and all i do is eat my mini muffins n drink my yoohoo. I pretend im listening, but all i really do is just think of what i'm gonna do the upcoming weekend. But today actually became exciting towards the end. Fifth period, Kristina, Erica, and I took a little trip to the bathroom to read the shit which is written on the wall about Kristina. Which is seriously soo gay. Let's see-nothing on the wall was actually true, and why would someone waste their time writing on a wall about someone, just say it to her face. That just goes to show how the girls in North Rockland High School are-but we all do it. Obviously Kristina got pissed and said something to the girl and they ended up getting into a fight. It sucked cuz i didn't get to see, but its kinda good cuz i'm so convinced i would've jumped in-but she didn't need me to neway. So the boxer Kristina actually got away without a suspension, which my parents do not believe me about ( i have no idea why ) but i am serously MAD proud of her..( yes i did say "mad" )cuz i can say that now since i make hott remixes. But overall, Danny saw it, n told me it was a good fight, and how he was so proud of Kristina. I could seriously picture him just standing there, cheering, n like saying.. "ahh nice move" or "wow matt, did you see that?" haha you all know he would say that. Our game against yorktown got cancelled, so tomorrow it should be happening-but its away. Thursday our game is home against Brewster High School, and you all better be there. Alright, i'm gonna go eat dinner, then watch gilmore girls, then one tree hill-you all should be doing the same.

      I think i can speak for most people when I say that today was maybe the worst day. Oh yeah, let me clue you all in now, I will have bad luck for 7 years becuz i through my mirror at my closet door last nite-so that might be why i had such a bad day. When i woke up, it was just so gloomy. And yes, I hardly could wake up becuz i didn't fall asleep until 2am becuz of my insomnia that i'm convinced i have. I did nothing in each class-just sat that, drew in my agenda n daydreamed. I got caught in global maybe 4 times too, which wasn't good. After lacrosse practice today, Sarah had a pasta party for our team becuz tomorrow we are playing yorktown (away..sorry!) It was a fun time i would say, we made our shirts, well actually Dams basically made mine, but they all came out good. But i'm gonna go do my homework, and then talk to Eric, n then go to bed. Gotta get a decent amount of sleep for the big game tomorrow! I'll let you all know how that goes!

      Happy Easter!I just got back from church a little while ago, and now i'm just like challen eating my chocolate. Today's gonna be a boring Easter cause my mom is cooking, although after dinner i'll be up at Kristina's house to hang out there. I am so upset to say that this spring break sucked so much. Even last night, all i did was just hang out with matt, danny, brian, kyle, and heather at heaths. But before that,  me, matt, danny, n brian went to kfc n we played the name game which i did AWESOME in, and as i said last nite, just being there eating, n playing that game with them was such good news. Tomorrow is school, which sucks so bad, but what can ya do. I was one of the people praying for snow days everyday, and this is my punishment. Well im gonna go, i hope all of you enjoy your easter day.   "i called my mom last night-she said, "Sweetie, you don't need someone, who's more fleeting than fall""

      hey everyone-i havent posted in awhile..or maybe like a day n a half, it just seems like awhile. My parents went away thursday to Maryland so grandma peg has been here but she actually just left-Thursday night, we all went to Toms, and we dont really need to recap all of that. Yesterday, I was off from lacrosse which was seriously a treat cuz i'm so sick of waking up early when there really is no need to. Last night, Danielle and Kim came over and hung out for a little before we went to the bonfire( or the valley..whichever u prefer). When we got there, we came to find that Damiani, Britt, Jill, Meagan, Danny, Joe, and Georgie were all maybe drunk off their asses. I normally don't like being around drunk people when i'm not, but it was really funny watching them do stupid shit that they didn't even notice they were doing. We finally left there at around 11:45 and walked up to Stonys to get a cab but ended up talking to these weird old guys about accents, and how we're the future of america. The cab finally came, and i feel bad cuz Jill and Meagan were late, but what can ya do. Danielle, Kim, and I went to Jenn's to just chall and kim was mad pissed we wouldn't walk her home, but whatever kim u do it to me all the time. When kim left, me danielle n jenn just took a shot n talked til 4am with Jenns bro and i dont think ive laughed that hard in so long. So basically it was a fun night, besides the fact we squished 3 people in Jenns bed, which wasn't that fun. When we woke up, mrs.nicks brought us to bagel world so we could torture kim while she was working, and we just had breakfast there at 12:30..although it should've been lunch. Well right now i think i'm gonna lay down for a little and then take a shower and figure out what to do tonite..i'll keep ya posted!

      heyyyyyy guys-i just got in from lacrosse, and i'm so happy to say that it might've been the easiest practice i've ever been to- But whatever-last nite was fun, i was with Jamie, Amanda and Britt. First, we went to like this bonfire thing and Britt loved it so Jamie and I left for a little and went to Ross' to hang out with some people then. Then, after staying there for a little bit, we went back to the bonfire to pick up amanda and britt, but we dropped britt off at joes cuz she had to pee really bad. I hate being around drunk people when im not drunk- especially when brittany is screaming..lol i love her-But whatever, then Jamie, Amanda and I went to Pat's for maybe 15 mins but i think it was better than staying at that bonfire. Then i just went home talked on the phone for a little bit and then finally fell asleep at like 230am..i can swear i have insomnia. Fortunately, my parents went to maryland today(it's my dads birthday!) so they'll be gone for 2 nights so i should have fun-even though Peg is coming over. We will see what happens. Even though its the afternoon, i'm gonna go wake up my brother and see if he wants to go to deli central..see yas!

      im sorry to say this, but spring break officially sucks-it's already tuesday n i haven't done nething great besides james' party friday which was awesome. Today after lacrosse, my dad n i went to the mall and ate lunch at TGIF's..it was great cuz i love when me and him just hang out. Well whatever after lunch we went to abercrombie and i got a skirt and a shirt, n then to modell's to get lax gloves (which i really needed). I guess he was feeling brave cuz he let me drive home from the mall..on the palisades parkway, which always makes me nervous, so i can only imagine how nervous he was. Surprisingly, i did really well, so he told me to stop at Hoyers on the way home so we could get some icecream..it was a fun day. When i got home, I took my nap, and woke up finding out that there was absolutely nothing to do tonite. We all got our hopes up thinking Tom was gonna have people over but that didnt work out. But whatever, Dams, Sar, and I went to Saints house and ordered Planet Wings, which was a treat, and then we just talked. I just got in a little while ago and I think i'm gonna go to bed cause its late..soo goodnight!

      this spring break better start getting better..  After lacrosse i slept until 6:00pm which was sooo gross..but it was definitely a great nap. I soon found out that i had to babysit til 9 but it wasnt bad cuz Colin was being extremely funny when he was acting like the HULK-hes 2 cute. After babysitting Kristina came over and we watched the Passion of Christ..or we at least tried to-somehow we kept getting interrupted..My dad brought us home some finnerty french fries and was being sooo funny when he kept leaving the room and coming back after he said he wasnt lol-you kinda had to be there..well anyway there was like mad tugboats here tonite, i have lax in the morning, and im really tired so i'm gonna go to bed..hopefully tomorrow will be a better day..nite

      heyyyyy everyone- saturday night i think i totally jignxed myself by saying hopefully something will go on, becuz i think im safe to say that kristina, dams, and i definitely did nothing- although we did have so much fun watching damiani's and mine confirmation tape from the 8th grade. but whatever we slept over dams' house and had fun-Yesterday:it was my parents 25th anniversary party at the fireside..so basically you know the deal with that-family, friends, everyone getting drunk (especially my parents) which is always fun to watch. Damiani came over before they got home n witnessed the whole thing- good times, good times.Last Night:we went to Ross' house which whenever we r there i always manage to have so much fun. Even though it was snowing earlier, John and I still went in the hot tub, which was an insane thing to do, because when we got out it was freezing. It sucked taking a cab home with damiani, especially because i left my wet tanktop in it, yeah im pissed. This morning we had lax from 9-1130 n i think i literally almost killed myself. Not meaning to complain, but my toes were almost falling off, especially when a girl on my team stepped on them. Well whatever,i'm gonna go lay down and hopefully something fun goes on tonite!

      ehh let me start off by saying that i am EVER so tired. It's almost 2 in the morning, and me being the huge loser that i am, is sitting posting in my journal. Hey, well i have to. Friday was so much fun. After school Cogar brought Amanda, Danielle n I tanning, and yes believe it or not, i actually did get tan. My little brother just asked me if that heart on my hip was a  tatoo  lol cute huh? Neways..after tanning, Danielle n I went to get our nails done, but first we stopped in at Sal's pizza to get some pizza and visit Joe. So whatever we got our nails done, n toes, and then i went home to shower n shit. Cait, Dams, n Danielle came back over n my mom brought us to that kid justin odells house, so we stayed there for a little bit, and thank god i had something to drink. Cogar picked me n danielle up after n we went to some college kids party, i dont know his name, but he was darins neighbor lol. Yeah a lot of people were there, including my husband James Sanjarourity.  He wanted it sooo bad lol . As we were leaving this party, we were walkin to cogars car, and austin was passed out in the front seat. It was maybe one of the funniest things i have ever seen in my life. But anyways, we went to DUNKIN DUNKIN (my favorite place EVER) lol with some people, and that was fun. We went back to cogars for a bit n then me n dan slept over sars house, it was definitely a fun night i would say. I was a little pissed though, but all in all, it wasn't bad.    This morning, Danielle and I went tanning again. As you all will probably to tell Monday, i actually am getting color lol. After tanning i went home to take a little nap before Amanda's Sweet 16. OMG-it was so much fun, and the cruise was soo beautiful. Amanda seriously looked gorgeous, i think she knows that cuz maybe everyone told her lol. So yeah that was really fun, especially when we were all screwing around and dancing, and making fun of the hott couples on the dance floor. It was definitely a fun time. We got back to Amandas at like 11:15 and some people just stayed there, and that was fun also. JohnnyO just actually dropped me off a little while ago, and i'm very grateful he did, considering the fact i'm really out of the way. Well i'm gonna go to bed, i'm extremely tired..laterrrrr   "..do you even remember..?"

      hi everyone. I'm so glad that tomorrow is Friday, you have no idea. Today was a fun thursday though. School was alright, i guess i really can't complain. I didn't swim in gym today, which made it even better. Katie drove me home after school so i actually got home early, compared to getting home like 20 mins later when taking the bus. My bro drove me to amandas after i got home because i was really bored, so me gav n amanda just challed there for a bit.  I WAS SO HAPPY  when joanne gavin picked me n dan up n brought us to mcdonalds. Seriously, i was definitely  having the time of my life  being with them two, eating mcdonalds, and listening to sublime at the same time. Oh my god it was definitely amazing. So yeah, me n dan went back to her house n then saint came down. I can definitely say we were having funny times on the computer. A little bit later Eric picked me n danielle up n brought us to hoyers. He's such an awesome friend, even though he wouldnt treat lol. When i got home i went to babysit, and it was seriously like nothing. I just sat there n did my homework n watched american idol when the kids were sleeping. It was an easy night at the callanan house, surprisingly.      I really hope something fun goes on tomorrow night! Saturday is Amanda's Sweet 16 on the World Yacht boat. I serously cannot wait,  its gonna be so much fun . I'll keep ya posted!  --Meaghan Jean Rogers..i miss you so much, and i can't wait for next weekend boo!   "..but i know you want me back now.."

But yeah so in the mean time i'm listening to "Lullaby" by Taking Back Sunday, everyone should download it, its amazing. Oh yeah, the new Dashboard Confessional song "Vindicated" is on the spiderman 2 soundtrack, download it-its one of his best songs ever!oh yeah, thanks sean for letting me know about that.I'm gonna go to bed, Gooodnight!   "..and we can talk all night.."

      heyyyy everyone-i just got in from the mall w/ jamie, and damn did we have an awesome time or what!!We needed to get dresses for amandas sweet 16, and yes we were successful. I, with my compulsive shopping problem, ended up buying more things then i actually needed. OMG-we saw the hottttest guy  EVER  at kids abercrombie, i think he was maybe one of the most gorgeous people i have ever seen in my life, just like that guy from the assembly today lol. SO yeahh school was ehhh today. I was in such a bad mood, becuz danny was giving me a huge attitude today, and then someone else just put me in a bad mood. Ugh, i really hate when people do that to me, and then im in a bad mood for the rest of the day, and then people begin to think im mad at them or something, just like katie kinda did at lunch. But besides all that bad stuff, the assembly my class went to today was awesome. The guy who was a drug addict was so fuckin  hott , and i know this may sound weird, but the fact that he was once a drug addict made him so much more attractive lol. So yeah, at the end of the assembly, my gay friends n i went up to him to get like information about the drug programs just so we could get a good look at him, lol we're so gay. After school i stayed after with my lax team to hand in our uniforms and stuff, it was ever so sad, and then me amanda n britt hung out with mr.krogslund til jamie came. Seriously, i really think he likes me, but amanda also thinks he likes her, but whatever. After we dropped manders n britt off, me n jamie went to the mall n did all that stuff which i already said, it was fun. I  love  whenever i'm in her car cuz we always blast the taking back sunday cd and it NEVER gets old..ahh good times, good times.    I'm sooo bored, but i'm gonna go babysit soon, that should be fun. Laterrrr   "..don't let me down.."

      ahh tuesdays seriously suck, especially because i had gym today, and yes i am still swimming, which even sucks more. School went by so incredibly slow and i wanted to go home early the whole day but i couldnt because i had basketball after school..yes, lacrosse ended yesterday, and basketball (which is a winter sport) started today..crazzzy stuff huh? So yeah after school n bball, my mom picked me up n surprised me telling me we were goin to fiesta!i seriously love fiesta even though i hate mexican food n i get chicken fingers and fries there..lol. After dinner with my parents, my mom let me drive to amandas, and no i didnt crash. We were supposed to go to the wooden bat game but then we ended up not going, and i was just watching amanda drink-ha what an alcoholic. Jamie came to amandas after her practice n we were all just  challen  n screwing around with amandas clothes, like always. Jamie just dropped me off n im about to study for a little and then go to bed..sorry today wasnt very excitinggg...laterrrrr   "..i wanna hate you so bad, but i cant..stop this any more than you can.."

      lets be honest here, i haven't posted in awhile because my computer has kinda been a little messed up. I just got home from my lacrosse game against yorktown who is the best team in our   league.We held them really well and only lost 15-14..i had 6 goals!It was crazy but everyone played really well, and i was so proud of our team.This girl on the other team stick checked me in the lip, so yeah, now i have a fat lip. Let me go back to the weekend though-friday night mi madre n i went to mall and she bought me some things for my report card...she bought me this awesome purse and such hott thongs from aber..& some other things, but i was most grateful for those 2 gifts. After the mall i went to gavs n challed there with her for the night. Sat..i had practice early, then went to ciceros with meg, sar, n saint, n then they dyed my hair!!(which only some people are actually noticing)..Caitlin had a party that night at her grandmas, which is always  fun .-i was seriously drunk off of my ass and it was awesomeee. A lot of people started showing up, n you know pic got jumped, n then he went to fight at wendys so i went with a bunch of guys there..After that, I went back to austins with him, joe, n cogar..i think?? and then some people starting coming there. That was a good time also lol..aha..Austin fell asleep after awhile so it was just me danielle n joe chillin, and  danielle was definitely doing tripods for us ..it was soo funny. We finally got austin to wake up at 415am so he could bring us home..Gavin n I weren't allowed in my house at that time because my dad was up for work, so we went up to saints n chilled with these 2 disturbing cats in her basement..n then went to my house at 530am..umm yeah we kinda got a little caught in the morning by my mom also..ehh..but newaysssss..Sunday was my pasta party for my lacrosse team..but with my luck, my mom ending up bring my brother to the emergency room becuz his ankle like broke the night before..i was soo pissed and i was like flipping out. Dams and Sar came over early to help, n thank god for my neighbor Nancy(yes ill wills mom) for cooking the pasta and everything..she was seriously a huge help. So yeah the whole team came over, including my coach, and it was a good time, even though i felt a little hung over. So yeahh that was my weekend, it was so much fricken fun you have no idea!!!laterrrrr  "listen trick, i've had all i can handle..we won't stand for hazy eyes anymore"

      what a disgustingly hott day..i was actually glad that i had to swim during gym cuz it cooled me off, and my hair didn't come out that bad..other than all of that, i really can't complain. Today, my mom came into the 4th and 5th(my class) period human development classes as a guest speaker to talk about her occupation. I was a little embarassed, but i guess i got over it-also, i felt a little bad when she asked me why i was being so mean to her, but i dont really think i was-i think she just heard george saying that i was a mean daughter..but newayssss...we were supposed to have a lax game today at nyack, so i came home from school n went back, n guccione told us an hour after the bus was supposed to come that the game was cancelled-i was a little pissed about that..tomorrow we're playing north though, that should be a good? game..hmm we'll see lol..i'm actually about to go babysit soon, i hope the kids dont give me a hard time, ehh but they probably will- laterrrrrrr  ".. make it hurt ..."

      let me first off say that i have to swim tomorrow and its goin to suck so bad..i'm so not looking forward to it-but anyways..i am so tan right now, like you have no idea..thanks to practice in 90 degrees, it at least helped in some ways.today was an alright day..i was pretty pissed about my hair cuz i didnt really take a lot of time to do it so it was just kinda wavey all over, but what can ya do. My thumb is still kinda broke or whatever it is, and im kinda pissed cuz now i have this thing that i am told by carol i have to wear, but its not even on now so i bet that doesnt work for awhile. Practice was sooo boring today. But in the beginning, i must say, sarah pleasured me by stretching my leg awesome- omg it felt so good , not trying to be gross or anything lol. After practice me n sar went back to britts n jumped in the hot tub before the team came over for the pasta party. It was sooo much fun, especially when Baron kept putting his ears behind my head..that was soo hott!lol but yeah the pasta party was fun, and i just really got home. Gilmore Girls and One Tree Hill are on tonight, i cannotttt wait..god jess and lucas are soo fricken hott!im gonna go jump in the shower..chao!  "..i begged you not to go, i begged you, i pleaded..claimed you as my only hope"

      what can i say about today..let me see-it actually went by pretty quick, n it was so nice out. It sucked becuz i didn't realize that i had bad sunburn until i got to school and many people told me i did lol.Also..many people..including danny told me that i shouldve worn a pushup bra today which i was reallly pissed about!lol but u guys were right- but anywaysss you do not understand how happy i was when i got to bio n we were doing a lab the whole period, like seriously i think that made my day especially cuz jeff is my partner. Ehh..nothin really too special happened..but let me think-lunch was pretty fun i guess..Austin came to chat with me towards the end of the period, and hes gonna LOVE the fact that his name is in my journal..but anywayssss-i came home after school before my game n eric drove me back to the hs just in time..im so fortunate to have such a great friend like him! We played pearl river highschool and we fortunately won 11-5, i had 2 goals! and one of my goals my coach was pissed about..but whateverr what can ya do. Sadly, i think my thumb is either broke or dislocated, and mrs.coughlin agrees also. I got checked extremely hard, i almost started to cry but i held it in. I'm gonna get going..i'm looking forward to tomorrow, its gonna be really nice out, and britt is having a pasta party for our team..can't wait!!!

      yesterday morning was our class of 2006 carwash.I'm sad to say that we weren't as successful as we were in the beginning of the year..maybe because hardly anyone was there. But anyways, i had a lax game vs new rochelle..they're horrible..we won i think maybe 14-0..i had 2 goals, but then in the second half we let our defense score goals, so that was fun. After the game we had a barbeque,. which was very nice of galati. I was looking forward to going to john gribbens after the game, but ofcourse his party was cancelled so i just went home n slept. That kid richie was supposed to have another biiiiigggg party too. don't you hate when you think a night is gonna be so much fun, and then it ends up not being all that you made it up to be?well that was last night, although i shouldnt complain cause i did have fun with jamie, katie, and michelle. we went to that kid richie's, but there were maybe 20 people there n it was pretty gay, so we left to go to the moontower.I seriously had to pee so bad, so i went in the woods, but by accident i stepped in quicksand n lost my flipflops..i was seriously sinking, n katie thought it was so funny so she went n took a picture while i was like crying. Thank god for alex, he got me out after like 10 minutes of me just standing there, n katie telling me to just walk out of it barefoot..she didnt wanna get her white shoes dirty lol. We went back to that party, it was kinda gay, but it was better than doing nothing. Jamie brought me home, n then i just went to bed..i was soo tired, i woke up with 4 missed calls n i didnt wake up at all when my phone rang.. this morning my mom n i went to get our nails done since it was mothers day lol. i lether pick my color out for me, i didnt think it was gonna be bad, but now i have a purple french manicure that kinda looks disgusting, but i shouldnt complain. We went to shoprite after, n my mom decided to be generous and let me drive home. Well so much for that, as i was pulling out of the parking spot, i crashed into the car next to me.. ehh it was really bad..the other car was all crashed n shit so my mom made me get out of the drivers seat so she could drive. i feel really bad lol but whatever..can you believe that i'm supposed to have my license right now?im a little scared..alright well im gonna go spend mothers day with my fam..it should be fun---laterrr   "..hey thanks, thanks for that summer.."

      i haven't posted in FOREVER-seriously..well since sunday...and yeah ross i hope you're not reading this, that goes for him and anyone else who thinks my journal is boring-you dont have to read it. Monday we had a game against some team far away-i can't quite remember. We lost-i'm really pissed cause me n jackie couldn't play since that was the game we were suspended for because of the concert. What can you do, my coach didn't HAVE to suspend us. Tuesday we went all the way down to Mahopac, and we were only able to play a 30 minute game, if u even wanna call that a game. Anyways, we lost 5-4..im so pissed cause we should've won. I had 2 dingers, but i didn't really play my best, my allergies were killing me. On the way home, i unfortunately repeated a ride home just like soccer season. I had to go to the bathroom, like always, so the bus stopped at bear mountain-just like soccer season..(haha!2 everyone who knows im talkin about!) but i seriously felt bad, but i had to pee. Today was such an ehh day. Once again my allergies were acting up, it was horrible. My school day was followed by practice, which wasn't bad, and then actually coming home to my dad being pissed about my cell phone bill. Whatever, he can deal with it. I'm about to go babysit..it's kiera's birthday so it should be fun over there. Sorry my entries haven't been really exciting lately..hopefully they soon will be   "..i'll sing whatever song you want, for whatever mood you're in..isn't that what you expect?i can sing you to sleep.."

      i'd like to say that tonight was enjoyable. I slept til maybe 830, caitlin came over, n then my cousin brought us to get icecream, n then to the bonfire where sar, dams, saint, britt, megan, joe, and danny were. It was a fun time, although i was only there for maybe an hour. Dams, Saint, Sar, and I then went to tara coughs where her, heath, kaity, danny, matt, ross, mike, john, greg, and joe were. We had fun playing charades, although taras sister was the best. We all just hung out there for awhile, and then sars sis picked me, sar, saint, dams, danny, matt n mike up n went to wendys.It was a fun time-i think im gonna possibly go to sleep now, im reallllly tired-cya laterrrr     "my heart is on the floor, why don't you step on it?"

      omg-the yellowcard and something corporate concert was AMAZING-thats maybe not even the only word i can describe the experience with either.Like always, i was late getting to amandas, but fortunately the limo hadn't arrived yet. The limo, was awesome...except everyone was arguing about what song to put on, n who was gonna stick their head out the sunroof. When we arrived to the roseland ballroom, joe, kevin, jon, and i made our way to the pizza place and got a slice before they let us in. They planned on taking a bong or bowl (not sure which it was) in, so they have me put half of it in my bra, and the other half was down joe's pants, but the security guards found his n took it lol. When we got in, we made it so close to the stage, but then once the swaying started after the first band that opened, i felt like i was gonna faint. Steve threw me up, and i crowd surfed when there wasnt even a band on stage, lol-i felt like such a loser but i needed to get out of there. After i did it once, i couldnt stop doing it lol- I did it 7 more times, but fell twice, including one time my head got stepped on..it was really scary. Something Corporate, and Yellowcard both were incredible. The way home from the concert was kinda a little irritating. People wanted to sleep, and other people wanted to like sing n shit. so ofcourse, there were arguments. but all in all-it was a really awesome time. friday:my road test was cancelled..i was SOO pissed-ugh but whatever, it will be soon im hoping. School wasn't bad at all cuz i went in late, just like maybe everyone did who went to the concert..which was possibly 80 people from our school. Coach was pissed that we missed a game, so we thought practice was gonna be hard, but it really wasnt. We scrimmaged varsity the whole time-it was a good time too. After practice, i went home, showered, n then went to my friends house for a little bit-maybe til like 10. When i got home, eric picked me up, then we went to pick up gavin n then we went with him to get his brother(my future husband) from the train station..(he looked MAD good). Danielle and I got to my house at around 1215..and then Austin came to pick us up, and we hung out with him, stigel, joe, and brian..It was such a funny time, they thought we were high or drunk but we realllllly werent, thats why it was even funnier. We got home at like 230, and then saint came to sleepover too.  today-i had a lacrosse game..we played south and won 15-5? thats what i'm guessing. I played pretty good, i had 4 goals, but i was sooooo tired, cuz it was soo incredibly hott outside. Sarah played really well too, i don't think she got as tired as me though lol. Now i'm just sitting home, trying to find out something to do tonight-i'll let you know how that goes..  "..oh should i tell you everything?i'm feeling out of luck.."

       last night was a girls night at gavs. Gav, saint, sar, dams and i were there for a bit, then drove sar home, n then watched confessions of a teenage drama queen. Going into the movie i was so excited cause i love lindsay lohan, but as the movie went on, it was maybe the strangest thing i've ever seen. So yeah it wasn't that bad though. After the movie saint n i walked home, and then i just kinda went to bed. Tonight though should be amazing.  Amanda, Gavin and I are going to the city to see a show at the Knitting Factory . It should be sooooo much fun!I can't wait,  i'm afraid of the city kinda, but i still like going there.  Maybe we can see my husband James while we're there..hmm..thats a good idea. Well im gonna go run to the bank in a bit, then start getting ready for tonight. I'll keep you all posted!     "..to come around.."

      ahh what a fun night!i just got in from 7/11, and prior to there, we were at stony point elementary school.  Yes it was so much fun , although i wasn't smoking. I was there with britt, and then like a bunch of guys from my grade, matt dillon and some of his friends, and then mike. I love hanging out with them cause they are seriously so much fun. Except i didn't have much fun when greg speared me on the grass, but he knows why he really did that. Anyways, today i just babysat for a bit, and i brought colin to danielles to swim cause she was watching her neice and nephew, and basically all 3 of them are friends (well we actually made them become friends).But yeah it wasn't bad. I'm gonna go watch boy meets world. Laterrr...   "..now who you gonna call tonight?"

      so yeah its pretty late, or maybe i should say its pretty early in the morning. I'm happy to say that we won our basketball game tonight against old tappan, which means we're competing for 2nd place i think. After my game, erin came over to pick me up and then me, erin, gav, n christine went to georges for a bit, literally maybe 10 mins if that. Erin dropped me n gav off at bretts which was fun cause  those guys are soo funny, like all the time.  That was really it for my night. I was actually home by midnight, it was kinda weird. But yeah, another day of babysitting tomorrow. I doubt it will be bad. Laterrr..  &nbsp;  "..and wish the worst of what i was.."

      i just got in from babysitting, it was kinda a funny day there. I put palmolive in the dishwashed instead of the stuff you're supposed to, and bubbles starting coming out of it all over the callanans floor. Pretty funny, but i cleaned it up, thanks to kristinas help. Yesterday i babysat once again, and then went to joes house to burn the new taking back sunday cd since my mom wouldnt let me drive to the mall. She let me drive to garnerville though so i dont understand the big difference. Then i went to pick up katie n we went to wendys where the employees thought she was an actress because of the get up she was wearing. We proceeded to danielles for a bit and then i went home to shower and stuff. Ehh last night wasn't all that fun. I have a basketball game soon though. I think i might take a nap before erin picks me up. Hopefully tonight will be fun, but i highly doubt it. Laterrrrr!  &nbsp;  "..like it's where you wanna be.."

      heyyyyy...i feel like i haven't posted in a bit. And i'm actually in such a better mood then i was the last time i posted, which was maybe 2 days ago. Let me think..yesterday me saint gav n dams went to the mall for maybe 5 hours. As we all realized, we could've went to maryland in that time lol. My bro and the zaps picked us up and we had a really fun car ride home squishing in chris' backseat. After i got home n showered n everything, danielle, amanda and i went to coursens. Haha was that fun or what. Thank god taylor was there or i would've left right when i got there. Ofcourse girls were trying to start shit, let's not get into that though, i might get some more rude comments in this thing. Today i babysat for a bit. Then, like the idiots that me saint sar n gav are, we decided to go to nanuet after we got our nails done. I bet they will all agree with me when i say that  we made some bad decisions . On our way to nanuet, there was a huge accident on the palisades so i just kept shutting my car off in the middle of traffic cuz i was wasting gas. It was maybe really funny. So yeah we found the tanning salon in nanuet, and then went to the nanuet hotel for some pizza. We finally got home to stony point at like 8oclock after 3 hours of being in the car. And surprisingly i wasn't in a bad mood when i was driving this time. So yeah we went to matt's all star game, and they did win, which is awesome! Me, sar, dams, n britt went to gynos...lol but me n britt didn't really stay there,  we walked to Annie's instead  to eat. Let me tell you, it was some awesome food. After some begging, katie turner gave in to picking us up,  which definitely saved our asses cause it was getting a little creepy there . Thanks to katie we got home safe. Katie Russo picked me up for a bit and i actually just got in a little while ago from that. We just really like drove around to catch up and stuff, although it seems like we catch up everyday lol. But i'm really tired. I think i might go clean my room a little bit and then go to sleep. I'm babysitting tomorrow, just like every other day. You'll probably see colin johnny and i at bowline. Until tomorrow!GOodnight everyone.  &nbsp;  "..all i know it was the best conversation i've ever had.."   &nbsp;

      hehehe, just got in, kinda a late night, huh? I'm hear with Danielle and we're just eating some chips and salsa. Today was such a shitty day. Although i did finish babysitting 2 hours then planned. I came home, took a little nap, then picked up dams n gav. We didn't do much, but then Danielle and I went to babysit for a little more, and then went to Matts,  where we played with Microsoft Sam  on the computer. And ofcourse we played "asshole" with him and his sisters friends. I would say it was definitely a fun time. Cogar and Jimmy picked us up for a bit n we went to this boys house, when he wasnt even home, just so they could smoke out of a bong in his basement. It was a little strange, but danielle and i stayed entertained with his camera phone. We then picked up my brother, and he was a little pissed that i was in the car wit his friends, but was still acting incredibly funny. He'll get over it soon i bet. We're gonna finish eating this shit and then go up to bed. Can't wait for sparkys in the morning!!!!!!!  &nbsp;   "..i hear you.."   &nbsp; p.s-hope you like the ashlee quote..haha a little different, but still cool  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       once again i don't wanna post, i just haven't done it in awhile.Tonight seriously sucked. Although i was with jamie n amanda, we were having fun when it was just us. Ugh i don't even wanna talk about the rest. But anyways.. i've just been babysitting during the day, and thats never fun. Jamie and I brought Colin to the pool, and were trying to teach him to swim. It was funn. But whatever, i'm gonna have my nightly devil dog, and then go to sleep. Hopefully tomorrow will be better?..i doubt it though    &nbsp;   "..is pointed straight at your heart.."

      heyyy everyone. It's really late, i just finished watching Trapped. I must say it wasn't a bad movie at all. I've seen it a couple of times before, but i figured i'd watch it again for some reason. Last night was kinda a boring night. I babysat for a bit, n caitlin came with me, n then after we went out with gillman, keri, and balones for a bit to this boys house. I would've had a better time just babysitting all night i would say. Today i babysat again. It seems as if thats all i ever talk about in this journal, but hey it's my&nbsp; summer job. I actually had a basketball game this evening also, so erin picked me up for that n it was a pretty good time,  even though we lost by 25 points.  After our game, erin n i went on a little stalking trip, and then on a date to ciceros. I can't complain about that though.&nbsp;I went to damianis for a bit with saint n gav, n then we hung out with gillman n went to wendys. It wasn't bad i would say. But i'm about to go to bed. Maybe tomorrow night will be a little more interesting to write about. So long. &nbsp;  "..when you're down on the floor bleeding.."

      sup!Last night was Meaghan's surprise sweet 16 party. I haven't talked about it in this thing obviously because of the fact that she would read it.  It was seriously soooo much fun, and she had no idea at all.  I think everyone would agree with me if i said james, john, and mo were being hilarious. Better yet, i think hilarious might be an understatement. With them continuously on the mic, i think meaghan's family was a little terrified, more so james n mo on the mic lol. So yeah that was so much fun. After meg's party, i went to britts for a bit, and then we all went to Ross' for a going away party for James. He's moving to Atlanta tomorrow, i'm gonna miss him soo much! I don't know why, i was just in a really bad mood when i was there. Everyone was kinda pissing me off, but i still had fun because it's impossible not to have fun when you're at Ross' house. Gavin and I went to Danny's after we left Ross'. We seriously maybe made ourselves die of laughter. Or maybe i was being funnier, so i was making ourselves die of laughter. This might sound a little weird,  but us 3 were actually playing Full House , you know the tv show. Although Danny was telling me how gay i was the whole time, deep down he knew that im just too cool to make up an awesome game like that. So yeah i went out for a bit after danny's, and saint was so kind to let me sleep over. I was very thankful for that. I just got in from her house now. I had a really bad sleep cause i shared the bed with dams n meg, need i say more? I'm gonna probably go to sleep now for a bit after i get something to eat. Laterr everyone! &nbsp;  "..you're not so happy, you're not secure.."

      heyyy everyone. These past 2 days have been sooo much fun! Let me start off by saying that Brittany's sweet 16 was soooooo incredible. She looked beautiful, and it was just such an awesome time. It was maybe one of the best sweet 16s i've ever been to. Although yesterday wasn't really that good of a day. First of all, i got my haircut, and yes, its ever so short. Then, when i was picking saint up from work, i crashed into the car in front of me at the red light. And, with the luck i have, brianna and riff were behind me  when i crashed  n they were maybe dying of laughter. Thank god i cried to the man so he said it was okay n didn't take down any info. I was extremely relieved. After britts brianna, katie, and riff picked up me n gav n we went to seths. It was pretty cool. A lot of ppl were there that i didnt really expect to be there. Danielle slept over afterwards, and ofcourse we didnt get home til maybe 4 in the morning. I can definitely say that it was an  extremely fun night . When we woke up, when it was maybe noon, danielle n i went to pick up megs n we went to sparkys for breakfast, well they had lunch, n then we went to gregs for a bit. I'm about to get dressed n do my hair n stuff like that.. TONIGHT IS GONNA BE SOOOOO MUCH FUN..hmm don't you all wonder? &nbsp;  "..they shine.."

      sup dudes. It's really late, but i'm not tired at all. I had a lot of fun tonight. But let's see-i babysat this evening, and it was kinda total chaos. Colin decided to go to bathroom on the callanan's new rug, n then after him shitting all over it, kiera decides to throw up because its so incredibly disgusting. I think i maybe almost cried because of this. Whatever, i got over it soon though. After babysitting me, dams, gav, britt, sar, danny, n joe went to the bonfire for a bit. After being bored for a bit, me, gav, n britt went to SPE to swing on the swings, even though we didnt do that. Matt Dillon was actually there, which was a real treat cuz i love seeing him, i just miss him so much. Gav, Britt, and I just hung out n did kuma n shit like that. Jamie n Amanda picked us up n then we went to fiesta cancun, which was maybe one of the funniest experiences ever.  Basically the mexicans were tryin to hook up with us , n they kept taking those pictures of us.&nbsp; Haha it was weird, but definitely fun. I'm gonna go watch some tv with kevin now. I'm EVER SO excited for britts sweet 16 tomorrow night, it should be tons of fun. I will let u all know how that goes...laterrrr &nbsp;  "..what do you take me for?some kind of easy mark?.."

      I can honestly say that this summer is so far, extremely fun. I think i maybe stayed home one night so far, thats it. Although, yesterday was just another boring day of babysitting. After that, i picked britt up n we went to the mall so i can get a dress for her sweet sixteen. I was successful. When we were eating, we saw ross, joe, kevin, james, and john, so we hung out with them for a little bit. They were being extremely funny, like always. Umm yeah so i dropped britt off at her cheerleading meeting n then hung out with dams for awhile.It was a fun time. Last night i hung out with George for a bit, then i went to brians, n then to my friends house.  All in all, it was a really fun night i would say.  Hopefully the people that had my company are able to say the same. It's kinda disgusting but i like just woke up. I have to babysit this evening for a bit, and then i have a basketball game which im debating on going to. We will see what happens. Laterr   "..and i pray for you high health.."

      i dont even know why im posting right now cuz i really don't feel like it. Maybe because i'm bored and i dont wanna update the past couples of days tomorrow. Nothing really exciting has happened the past 2 nights. Although tonite i did see Anchorman with saint gav dams n sar. It was a pretty funny movie, just a little weird. But i'm probably gonna go to bed soon, i have another thrilling day of babysitting tomorrow..Goodnight-    "..or maybe..we will, i'm dying to know.."

      i can honestly not complain about yesterday. First off, it was brittany's birthday n i hope she had tons of fun. During the day though, it was a little boring. Although i did bring danielle kristina n lauren to coinstar, and then me n danny went to wendys for a bit. Let's see..for brittanys birthday me britt cait danielle kristina sarah dams and meg went out to ciceros, followed by hitting the carnival up. It was wristband night, so we made sure we went on the pirate ship as many times as we wished. George picked me britt sar n meg up n we went to Tim Keenans. We all got tanked, maybe sarah a little too tanked, but all in all it was a fun time. I think so at least.I didn't get home til 2:15, but thank god my dad was sleeping on the couch so he didn't even notice. But yeah that was last nite, i hope tonight is just as fun. I'm gonna go try to get my moms keys so i can go to the mall. Laterr    "..i'm trying to get this right, yeah, cause i'm ridiculous like that.."

      hey everyonee..lax camp is finally over-and i'm happy to say that i won one of the wormburner awards. It was a little fannie pack but still it was cute lol. Yeah so last night was pegs 80th surprise party. It was kinda weak, but gavin came with me so we made it fun. There was a weird witch there, and her daughter helen was like doing spells on me, danielle, and my cousins. Um yeah so after we went to that boy drews house but we werent able to stay there long. George dropped me off at home n then saint came down n my mom actually let me take out the car even though it was 1045, that was extremely nice of her. So Kristina and I just drove around for a bit screaming stuff at people out the windows. We actually went to dunkin and the alarms were going off in there n then soon there were a million cops and a fire truck there. It was crazy-so we just left n went to mickeyds, which was even funnier.  The girl at the window told us we should be on mtv  cuz we were just acting so funny, like singing ashlee simpson into the drive thru speaker, and hitting every curb on the drive thru. Good times, good times. Yeah so after that we just came to my house n watched a little boy meets world, and then kristina left. I actually had a fun night, believe it or not. But whatever, i'm gonna go. I think possibly tonight i might go to the carnival since its wristband night again. We will see. Laterr   "..but i'm still trying.."

      hey everyone-i just got in from lax n it actually wasn't that bad today. We worked really hard before lunch, and then after lunch we watched a dvd n then had a tournament. Pete and these two little boys were on my team and we won our game-ofcourse since i was the only girl i didn't touch the ball much, but i'm happy we won. After lax i picked up matt n danielle n we went to bank n then to ciceros n mr.softees-i needed pizza and matt needed icecream, although i did end up eating both.  ...lets see-last night..i went to the carnival for a bit with some friends. It was kinda gay but i got one ride out of it-i definitely didn't bring any money so i just scapped tickets off of people. After the carnival i went to jamies cuz she had some ppl over for a little. I hope the carnival is fun tonight though. I cannot wait-it's wristband night lol. But yeah i'm gonna go take a nap..i'm so incredibly tired. Laterrr   "..and when did your eyes begin to look fake?i hope you're as happy as you're pretending.."

      although its getting late, i figured i would post before i went to bed. Tonight, Joe had ppl over to swim and stuff, which i found out when i got there. All the guys were swimming, so peluso n i decided to swim with them. With joe's shorts and shirts we constructed 2 kool bathingsuits i would say. So all was well while we were swimming, and when peluso n i felt the need to get out we put our jeans back on n borrowed some sweatshirts from joe. I definitely wouldnt have put nice warm clothes on if i wouldve known that john quevedo was gonna throw me in the pool. UGH i was soo pissed, although i did laugh at first. He's such a little fag but i can't stay mad at him. Because of him though,  i definitely think i have pneumonia .I was sitting outside soaking wet for maybe an hour-it wasnt a good feeling, trust me. But yeah it's really late n i have lax camp in the morning-i really wish someone could maybe call a bomb scare to it, then maybe it would be cancelled for a day. lol im so gay..laterrrrr   "..think of all the times this jerk has fucked you up and let you down.."

      i don't mean to complain, and it seems like its all i've been doing these past couple of days, but i HATE lacrosse camp. I even think that the adjective hate might be an understatement.      lets see-last night, me britt gav saint n dams went to caits for a barbeque since today is her birthday.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY CAITLIN!  It was fun, i had a lot to eat, and the cake her mom made was awesome. After cait's, danielle n i went to austin's graduation party for a little bit, and then to timmys. I guess it was an alright night, it could've been better though. I had some really bad sunburn, and it was a little noticeable.       well as for today, lax camp sucked-like i said 20 times already. But yeah, i have a basketball game at 630 at pearl river highschool, and everyone who said that they're were going to come, better come.  "..and i'm not so sure, if i'm sure of anything, anymore.."

      heyyyy everyone-omg i just got in from lacrosse camp a little while ago, and let me tell you all,  it was complete hell . I cannot honestly believe that i have 4 more days doing this. Our counselor/coach for the week is a huge bitch also. In the morning, we were all screwing around, and not catching like any passes, it was seriously hysterical and she was getting so pissed. AH but whatever-enough about lacrosse. Last night was a pretty good time. I hope everyone had a fun 4th of July, i know i did.  Joe's fireworks were awesome , although i was hiding for quite a bit when they were going all over the place. After a little bit, i walked down to Evan's even though hes in Ireland. His brother was having a party, so cait, amanda, and i went with my pretend boyfriend george. But yeah, all night i was back n forth from joes and evans. I would say all in all it was a fun night, now that i look back at it.     It's almost 4 oclock and i think im gonna go take a nap. I'm so extremely tired from this camp, you have no idea. I'm kinda excited for tonight, i think it will be fun. I might stop by austins graduation party, but i will have to see about that, it might be a little dangerous.Laterrr everyone   "..let this mistake bring a vivid crystal to his* eyes.."

      HaPpY 4th of JuLy!I hope everyone had fun last night, cause i did-lol. Well me gav saint kim danny n joe went to the bonfire for a bit so they could smoke, n me n kim just challed. Although i wasn't under the influence joe was being extremely funny with his car noises-we were alll dying. Cogar and them picked us up after a bit n we went to the O'Connors- i had soooo much fun .My brother was a little pissed i was there i think, and i think he was more pissed that his friends brought me there lol-but whatever he obviously dealt with it by just pushing me whenever he saw me. But besides that, it was a good time. After the O'Connors, we went to Johns to hang out with him, timmy, anthony, and kyle. I was really tired, thats y i didn't have much fun there-plus i think timmy was making fun of me the whole time. But anyways-i can't wait til the day gets started..i love the 4th of july, and i hope something good goes on. I'm outta here though-laterrr    "..i feel like shit, this isn't the way to treat old friends.."

      heyyyy everyoneee last night was kinda ehh lets see.. well i went to coursens with britt and george but they decided to leave so i just stayed there, it was fun when everyone was there, but then i dunno i was just getting in a mad mood cuz of some homos that i hate. But besides that, i was chillin with my boyfriend george n then finally at maybe 2 in the morning reza drove me home, and i was  very thankful  for that. I didn't even go inside cuz danielle, jenn, timmy, n anthony were there to pick me up, and we all just hung out n i had fun with them. I got home soo late, i think maybe like 330, it was crazy. So yeah today me n saint went to the mall to go shopping n then on our way home we picked up gav n then went to amandas-but yeah im gonna go jump in the shower so im actually ready when my friends wanna go out tonight-i hope something fun goes on, i'll crosss my fingers-laterrrr   "..enjoy this lonely sky with me, it will swallow us whole if we only let it.."

      OMG-it has been forever since i posted, due to the fact my computer hasn't really been working-but great news..it's fixed, finally. SOrry i haven't been able to keep everyone updated with my extremely exciting life, and i'm not gonna even try to go back n tell u what has happened since. I just got home from Wildwood like literally a half hour ago. Caitlin, Brittany, Gavin and I went for Caitlins birthday and  we had soooooooo much fun!!! When we first got there, we went to the beach and met these losers, and ofcourse-my asshole friends gave him my cell phone number so they were calling us all night to go to their party of "7" yes, 3 of them and 4 of us..some party huh?that night we went to the boardwalk though- I think we met maybe 100 guys, including some really weird ones. We actually met these workers ( no not carnies) at this store Fantasy, and became like bff with them. They're names were Canada and Simon, and simon and I really  hit it off . Canada wanted to show us his "balls" lol and Simon was just asking me some sexual questions. Everyone in the store thought danielle was an annoying fuck and wanted to kick her out cuz she was being extremely funny. But whatever, they gave us some free tatoos and wanted to pierce our bodies, which was a little weird. We also met this kid Antonio, omg he was the definition of gorgeous. He called caitlin later on that night and wanted us to go "clubbin" with him lol. Weird huh? Today, we went to the beach for a little n then went to the pool and were doing hott moves off the diving board and then went to the boardwalk to go on rides. We flirted our way onto the slingshot and ended up getting $15 off the price lol, and then the tilt-a-whirl was awesome cuz we stayed on for basically a half hour until some girl ralphed all over-funnnny shit.Then, we went out to dinner at this boathouse and we were singing along with the guy that was performing, it was amazing lol. But yeah i don't feel like getting into much more detail cuz im tired and i think i wanna go out for a little bit-but i had soooooooo much fun, and i hope caitlin did too!!! K well jenni and dan r gonna come over and challll ttyl!!!   "..i am seeing in myself the things you swore you saw yourself.."

      i feel as if everyday i repeat myself over and over. Possibly when summer is over this feeling might go away. Hopefully it does.  I babysat til 6pm today. I think  i'll just add also that it wasn't fun at all . It really sucks talking to a 2 yr old, and only a 2 yr old for 6 hours. I can't use my cell phone much anymore, and no1 ever wants to come over there and hang out with me. What can i do about that? Obviously nothing. I think even if i had a boyfriend, he wouldn't even want to come over there. It sucks, really sucks. So right now im being dead serious, if any of you that are reading this, and aren't busy tomorrow(Friday) please feel free to call my cell phone, you probably have the number, and invite urself over if i don't already do so.  So anyways, after babysitting danielle and i drove around for a bit. Well i drove, she just sat in the front seat and controlled the radio. It was fun, although we always have the same routes, i wouldn't be surprised if some people got worried that we're always near their houses. But yeah i saw klein n doug while klein was driving so i sped up quick and  we ended up having a race after talking for a bit.  No matter what they say,  the truth is that i won . The quest is a beast, just making sure everyone knows that. So yeah after going home, showering, visiting the stpierres before they leave, i finally went down to gavins around like 10. Danny and Greg were also there, and Joann let me take her car to get some movies. Sometimes i feel as if she trusts me more than my own mom. But whatever, the movie store was closed so we were all just fucking around and i let danielle drive, and i'll add that she did well. We went back to gavs and watched  Now and Then . The fact that danny n greg didn't see that movie ever before amazed me. Whenever those 2 are together they always find a way to make fun of me, and tonight they were saying i have red hair, which i obviously dont. But i'm over it now. Greg left and it was just danny danielle n i. And ofcourse danny was pulling some funny business, but it was incredibly funny  just because i'm so funny(not you ashlee, or danielle-whichever you prefer).  Danielle was getting so pissed at danny and i for not leaving but it was her fault for inviting us over. Shit, Okay before i forget, someone was  robbing her neighbors house , and we saw the whole thing. It was crazy, like honestly. Danielle could've sworn it was the old lady, but it looked like a huge man, but i hope im wrong. So danny and i finally left at like 115 and i made him walk me home cause it was so late. I felt bad, considering the fact its totally out of the way, but he had to walk me home cause  there are bears on my block,  i know it. He told me he wasn't pissed, but i know he was, hes just tryin to be a good friend. Thanks danny. All and all it was a hilarious night. Just because my friends are awesome!!!lol im such a dork..   quote of the  night :    "If you tell anyone about this, especially your brothers, i'm gonna beat the shit out of you"- Devin Sawa..  "Wow, that's definitely Danielle.." -Danny   that was maybe hilarious. Thanks ofcourse to now and then, and ashlee and mike. hahahahaha! so yeah im gonna find some food and then go to bed.  Please  take me up on that offer on visiting me while babysitting tomorrow. Goodnight everyone!         "..i'm already torn.."

      once again, another boring day of babysitting..when i got home though i just went to sleep for a little bit and i woke up to my cell phone ringing, and it was my dad. I went downstairs and waited for him to come home cause he said he needed to talk to me, and he told me that i went $184 over my cell phone bill.  I felt extremely bad , cause last month i went $72 over. He warned me, next month if i go 5 bucks over, then my phone is terminated, so please don't call me too much everyone..Umm, after my talk with my dad, i got ready to go out, n right when i was about to leave, i got a call from carmita asking me if i can go to the callanans because the other babysitter didn't show up. I was extremely mad, especially because i spend most of the day there, n then i had to go back that night. Ugh whatever, i had to do her a favor though cause she always does me favors. So when i got home, my mom drove me to cjs, but i just ended up goin to wilsons with gav laur n jenn. I think i maybe broke kyles leg in the front seat cause we were all soooo squished, and ofcourse i ended up in the front-::sighs:: ever so dangerous ..but what can you do. On the way home it was a little more comfortable. Danielle, Timmy and I were all in the back holding hands. Like honestly,  i'm so funny sometimes i can't take it lol . Yeah but i'm gonna go get some milk and cookies. Tomorrow should be sooooo much fun though, i'm babysitting until 6oclock, i think i might kill myself. By the way, feel free to stop by.     quote of the day:  "Yo Kel, wanna take your 5 hr with me tomorrow?"-Kim Jordan..      Shes maybe a little retarded.And no kim, my mom is never hiding in the back of the car when i pick you up, the license i have is real.

      last night was soo much fun. Jamie, Gavin and I ended up seeing The Village at like midnight. We were being hysterical in the movie theatre, and every guy near us was like dying laughing at us. After that i just came home and went to sleep, and surprisingly i woke up at 130 in the afternoon because i didn't have to babysit.  How disgusting is that?  I never sleep that late, i guess i was just catching up on the sleep that i haven't been getting lately, but im sure i'll be having more now.  Haha, i'm too funny.  I bet none of you get that anyway. But whatever..when i finally woke up, i went down to gavs, and me, her, jenn, and kim watched the butterfly effect. It was pretty good, although i did miss half the movie. I went home to run some errands, and then drive around with jenn kim n gav.  Gavin and I ditched them  so we could go get a card for jenn's surprise birthday dinner tonight at fiesta cancun. It was soooo much fun, and she was ever so surprised!!We went to coursens for a tiny bit, and then cjs, and then right to James Hickeys. We stayed there for awhile, and i personally had a lot of fun. I'm talking to kim right now online and i don't think shes drunk, but shes being incredibly funny.   Check this out:     kim 23054:    BORIQUA     kim 23054:    DOMINICANA     kim 23054:    thats u     kim 23054:    :-[ but ur not tan...ur burnt     who says it?apparently kim jordan--even when she is sober.       "..why can't you just be happy?and i don't think i'll come back down.."                            "...CAN'T YOU LIVE WITHOUT THE ATTENTION?.."

      so yeah yesterday me, dams, danny, n greg went to the mall for a bit, they saw a movie, n dams n i just left after seeing if old navy had any more white flipflops. No they didn't so don't waste a trip to the mall like we did. Sar, meg, dams, n i went to ciceros for dinner, and then i picked them up after we all showered, went to hoyers, then to my house, then to james hickeys. It was alright. Not really my kind of people, but i wasn't complaining. Umm gillman picked me up from there, which was incredibly nice of him because i really wanted to leave. Danny and I were supposed to hang out cause i was a little upset, but he was a fag n went to steven lonergans instead, so basically he ditched me, even though he swears i was going to bed. I just got in from babysitting and i'll probably take a nap,  and then hang out with my friends . Jamies home from vacation, so it will be fun seeing her tonight. I'm outta here..laterr       "..i'm lying just to keep you here.."

      okay yesterday was such a busy day. Gavin and I were driving around for a bit, went tanning, and then kidnapped Austin cause we wanted him to buy liquor for us for last night. He was a little mad when we wouldn't bring him home, but it was maybe hilarious listening to him yelling. But whatever, he knows he loved every minute of it. lol..So yeah amanda, gavin, and i went to the city to see  a show at the knitting factory. Let me just tell you, we made friends with everyone in each band. It was definitely so much fun. I think i definitely have a crush on Zach from Life Before This. He was such a hottttttie. When we first got there, they wouldnt let us bring our "water bottles" in so danielle  stuck the liquor in between her legs under her skirt  n we walked in..it was very interesting how she did that. But whatever, every like 10 minutes we went to the bathroom to drink, them a lot more than me, cause i hate the taste of that shit. But i think we can agree with eachother saying that we were basically trashed. After the show, we went out to dinner in the village at Arturos. This was maybe at 1 am, and u know when im drunk i fall asleep, i was sleeping on the way there. It was horrible. We ate soooo much, like honestly there was an incredible amount of food. Gav decided to go to the bathroom at this restaurant, and screamed to everyone how there was a bathtub in it, which was a little weird, and then started  tagging up the chalkboard in there with all our names . She was tanked. We finished eating around 2am and then walked around the village. Let me just tell you.. true fact: THE CITY NEVER SLEEPS.  I was petrified walking around, i seriously thought we were gonna get shot. I think i need to get over that stuff soon. Ahh i almost forgot.. i talked to my husband James , thank god for john amoroso giving me his number, but he called me and told me how he was in the hamptons so i didnt get to see him. Definitely next time though..!Me and danielle got back to my house around 345 to find we were locked out, but we finally got in through the garage. But anyways, saint, pel, jenn, kim, danielle, and i just went to fiesta. That was fun, especially pel just got back from mexico, it was awesome to finally see her after sooo long. But i'm gonna go lay around, hopefully something fun goes on tonight. I feel as if i say that in every one of my posts?hmm.. Later!    "...i could go all night.."
