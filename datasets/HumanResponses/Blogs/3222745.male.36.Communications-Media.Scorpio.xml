      In trying to figure out what to write for a first entry in a new journal I thought about metaphors relating to such ideas as "an empty book waiting to be filled", "a blank page ready to be laden with words," and so forth.   Years ago I kept a daily journal -- you know, the good old pen and paper kind. The kind with no "backspace" key, except for the pink rubber kind that came standard on most No. 2 pencils -- I always used a medium point ball pen -- and no "undo" function, aside from being able to just rip the page out of the book -- something that I refused to do. I figured if I wrote it, then it belongs there so I never erased and as far as I can remember never ripped out a page.   When starting a new journal I usually bought a spiral notebook with just about 250 pages in it. I preferred the ones with yellow paper as I usually found them easier on the eyes especially late at night sitting, talking and writing with my friends at Ike's Great American. I also found the 250-page size easy to handle and carry as it went practically anywhere I did ready to capture the thought of the moment.   This digital journal is certainly quite different in so many respects. I cannot doodle in it like I could my old pen and paper journal. I suppose if I must doodle I could do that on a separate piece of paper, scan it then upload it to an entry. But that certainly takes away from the function and the very art of the doodle I think. It's also somewhat different in that my mood would often affect my handwriting. Even today I can look at an old journal and imagine my mood at the time just by the pressure and size of my writing and even by whether or not I wrote cursive or printed. I know that the Livejournal allows you to use different typestyles, sizes and weight which is good, but writing with a pen is a much more emotional and organic process than adding an html bold tag to the beginning and ending of a particularly strong word. I accept that as a challenge, however, not as a pitfall.   I suppose the biggest difference is that my pen and paper journal existed mostly for myself to read. Yes, at times I allowed certain people to read bits and pieces for different reasons, but Livejournal, though it has a "private journal" function, is by design and by its very presence on the World Wide Web something meant for the whole world to see. That is not necessarily a bad thing -- it's just a difference between the old way and this way.   My journal entries then ranged from random thoughts to childhood anectodes to poems and musings. An entry ranged from a single word if I felt so inclined to pages. I never edited anything in my journal. Usually I would just start writing until I said everything I felt like saying. I used good grammar. I used bad grammar. I used full sentences with thoughtful transitions and I used fragments. Whatever I thought -- I wrote. If I wrote something that I thought merited revision I would usually copy it as a separate story or essay, but always left the original form intact in my journal.   I will certainly use this journal the same way. And I will try to never edit anything, though the mouse and backspace key are certainly easy to use when I'm so inclined to change a thought. But generally I'll just type what I think and feel.   Perhaps I'll even go back to some of my old pen and paper journals and reprint some of my old entries for all the world to enjoy.   Hopefully someone out there will find this and start reading along. Maybe I'll make some new friends doing it. Maybe no one but me will ever lay eyes on what I have to say. But at least I'll say it and I hope that doing so will be as therapeutic and inspiring for me now as it was back in the pen and paper days of the 80s.

      The second season of  Dead Like Me  started tonight. This show has joined  Roseanne  and  All in the Family  as one of my very favorite series on television.   The characters are fabulous and like my other two favorite shows I cannot pinpoint a favorite or least favorite character since they are all so well thought out by their creators and so well developed by the actors. Each one is so special and unique, and anyone can easily identify themselves in one or more of these very real characters.   The photography is outstanding. Sometimes we are taken into a scene at high speed which not only has the effect of moving the action along quickly, but actually grabbing us and placing us within the scene. Sometimes the photography and effects are almost magical, like the time a $20 bill flew in front of George's face and into her bicycle spokes or when the pink lilies found their way into her hands after the disaster in the farmer's market. These magical moments cause us to focus on the more subliminal statements in each episode and, like the high speed transitions, are somewhat 3D in effect and bring us almost physically into the reapers' world.   Speaking of the reapers' world, that is certainly the most fascinating aspect of the show. Their world is a complete fantasy co-existing with the everyday world we're all a part of. Somehow by stepping into the reapers' world every week we are able to have a completely new view of our own world. And looking at our lives from death's viewpoint allows us to have a completely objective view of our otherwise completely subjective lives.   I hope this show lasts a long time.   -------------------------   Just for the record:    Top Ten Favorite TV Shows   In no particular order, because it's difficult to put one above the rest.    Roseanne  All in the Family  Dead Like Me  Queer as Folk  Columbo  Star Trek: TOS  Star Trek: Voyager  I Love Lucy  Gilligan's Island  Bewitched

      The bike I've been riding the past two years is pretty much falling apart. Hey, it was a $90 Wal-mart special. I bought it rather than a more expensive bike from a bike shop since I didn't know whether I would even like riding or not. I got hooked and have put far more miles on this thing than what I'm sure was intended.   I'm getting a new one sometime this week and it can't get here soon enough. I just broke another spoke on this one and don't have the proper tools to replace it. But my new bike probably won't be here and assembled until Wednesday or Thursday, so I'm kind of stuck with nothing but my car right now.   Ok, I might as well admit right now, I'm not getting just a new bike. I'm getting two. I've wanted something that I could commute to work on as well as run errands and do some light shopping. But I also wanted it to be pretty quick since I have friends who ride fast road bikes and would like for me to come along -- I would get left in the dust on my Wally World mountain bike. I also want to start taking some long distance tours. With all I like doing on my bike just one could not fit the bill. So, I'm getting two.   I've shopped at a number of bike shops and settled on a local shop whose owner I like and trust. He deals mainly in Fuji bikes, so that's what I'm getting. For commuting and general "around town" use I'm getting the Fuji Touring. It has places to attach racks and fenders, the frame is steel, and has wider tires than a road bike for a more comfortable ride and to handle heavier loads.   I'm also getting a Fuji Newest, a fairly light-weight road bike with fast, skinny tires. That will be for fun riding and being able to keep up with my friends. I really wanted to get the Fuji Roubaix for my road bike, but it was about $330 more, and since most of my time will be spent on the touring bike I decided to save the money. And, hey, it will give me something to look forward to a few year from now when I'm ready to upgrade.   Even saving money with the Newest instead of the Roubaix, it's still a lot of money to spend. But I've been saving for some time and I'm really hooked. I ride EVERYWHERE. I've also lost over 30 lbs. so far doing it and it's a pretty healthy thing to be hooked on.   Here are the bikes I'm getting:   urlLink Fuji Touring ,  urlLink Fuji Newest
