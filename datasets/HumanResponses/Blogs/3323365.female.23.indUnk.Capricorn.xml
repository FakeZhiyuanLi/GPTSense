      I love my roomate.  Don't think for one second I don't.  But sometimes it's hard living with yourself.  You see all the shit thats bad about you in them. Like we constantly steal each others clothes and stuff and then get mad at each other for it.  But how can I get mad at her for taking my belt when I stole her headband? I also wish I was a better poet.  I also wish I could get with a certain barista.  I also wish I could get with a lot of people I'm not getting with right now.  I wonder if anyone is going to read this.  I wonder if I'll be better at keeping a blog then I am a real journal.  Probably not.   love renee

      I don't understand myself sometimes. One minute I'm cool with just being friends, the next i'm some sappy girl drooling over the "boy" with desperation written all over my face.  One minute I'm the pimp the next I'm the ho.  Well maybe not but thats how I felt last night.  I never felt so misunderstood.  I also have never felt like I was one of those girls that played mind games. I spent the night last night with someone I care about very much, and then he and I started groping, but we NEVER kissed.  When I left in the morning and he rolled over on his side(away from me) I felt more used than I ever have.  Granted it's probably because I care alot about this guy as a friend, but still it sucks.  I don't understand why when two people who are good friends can't seem to relate to each other on a sexual level.  Isn't that supposed to be the perfect relationship? One with your best friend? And yet girls who are considered one of the guys are never considered "girlfriend material" Likewise guys who are sensitive and caring get stuck in a friend zone that is worse than death.  I don't understand why both sexes seem to reject the notion of friends with benefits.  I also don't understand why seeminingly normal women go for the asshole, and men go for the psycho bitch.  I fell for it.  Me, Renee, a smart creative individual who has life figured out.  I fell for a guy who became my really good friend, and then right when I thought I could trust him(aka be intimate with him) he broke my ego and made me feel like a hoochie.  Do guys have an extra gene that they just know how to make girls feel insecure and weak? Granted girls have that extra gene that can overanalyze any situation till it's beat into the ground.  So I guess I'll stop overanalyzing and thinking he's an asshole when he was probably just tired, and maybe I'll stop playing head games.  It's just so hard when you want something so bad to not get it! Damn self-control...
