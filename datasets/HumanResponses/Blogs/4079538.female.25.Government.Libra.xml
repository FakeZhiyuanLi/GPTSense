      hmmm, defintiely did not start any diet. I did however order pilates machine and eat and entire ice cream cake on my own. One week from today is the anniversary of my best friends death. What is appropriate to do on this day? I want to go be with her, to wear her clothes, to sleep in her bed, but none of this is possible. I dont understand how I lived a whole year with out her in my life. This past year has sucked incredibly. I often think that killing myself is the only answer. That way the people in my life wont have to put up with me (even though there are not that many, and I never see or talk to them), and I could possibly end up in Heaven with her.  The fact that I have made progress in dealing with this is depressing me. I dont want to deal. I dont want to go on with my life. I want to be sad and cry and sleep all day. I want to die. I cannot live like this. I want to go to her grave and lay on the ground, so I can be close to her. I dont like her not being here and I dont want to do anything because it would just be a reminder that she is not here. I cant even remember what it was like to be with her. Sometimes I hear her voice and it startles me.  I am starting to forget the little things she would say. I will never forget her hugs, or her beautiful face. My life will never be normal or good again. I think that suicide is the only answer. I set a time limit the January before the accident. I said that if life didnt get better by Jan. 26th, 2004 I would kill myself. When the time rolled around, the trust fund for Damien hadnt been set up so I couldnt do it. I extended it for a year.  Maybe I will go and get the tattoo that I have been wanting. It is an angel weeping on Karlie's name and the words, Without my wings, I feel so small. I hope that is appropriate. It is a line from a Britney Spears song, but I really like it. Or I will put, noone will ever replace you. We used to say that to each other.  I love her so much and I miss her life is unfair. People say there is a reason for everything, but I can not see any reason behind this.  Weight 17.5 Waist 27 hips 28 bust -1,000,000
