      Learning HTML is hard as hell.  However, my ego demands that my blog have at least a few cool things.  I could bug Josh or John to program everything I wanna do for me, but my ego will also not allow me to want to know something and not master it.  So I will learn HTML at least the shit I need to know to do what I want.  It's hard it doesn't make any sense and I'd wager that this could be made a lot simpler.  I'd also wager that the simplifier could stand to make a lot of loot.

      My upstairs neighbor is a little off.&nbsp; I have no idea what the problem is, but there is definitely a problem.&nbsp; So all day long she follows my next door neighbor around who treats her like ten year olds treat their younger siblings, bossy, but loving.&nbsp; I recently found myself engaged by neighbor in a 'kids today' ( yes maybe I am getting old), during which I informed that I think it's&nbsp;mostly the parents fault and that often the kids do well in spite of the parents not because of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; She asked me why I felt this way and I told her that when I was young I had an awful childhood and what surprised me more than the incredible disfunction in my family was that no one did anything about it.&nbsp; Child protective services became involved on a few occasions, and they never really investigated.&nbsp; My friends parents got impassioned, and when they spoke to my family and realized what they were up against they backed down.&nbsp; She asked me how do I balance the anger with parents who work against me in mentoring the kids.&nbsp; She said she's upset with the upstairs neighbor because she always has a lot of men around and when they around she yells and curses at her son, sends him to stay in his room for the duration of the visit, and gives him baby portions of dinner so the boyfriend could eat his fill.&nbsp; Today my next door neighbor brought said kid to my door in tears.&nbsp; He articulated in beyond ten year old capacity, that he informed her that he felt alone and&nbsp;unloved because she put her many boyfriends before him , but she just yelled and cursed and called her boyfriend.&nbsp;He said&nbsp;hated living there, but as his grandmother was in the hospital and he had no other relatives he didn't know what to do.&nbsp; I held him told him it wasn't his fault, he didn't deserve that, and some parents just don't know how much what they're doing hurts, and that when I feel bad I smack Joey around and playfully hit him.&nbsp; Joey offered to be the boy's punching bag too, but he declined.&nbsp; I asked him if he liked to read he said he did.&nbsp; I was caught somewhere between feeling like I was going to be sick and wanting to punch a wall because I am just as powerless to save him now as I was to save myself then.&nbsp; He told me he liked the first Harry Potter I told him I had them all and he could borrow them.&nbsp; His face actually kind of lit up.&nbsp; When he left I felt a little better, maybe there was a little good from this.&nbsp; I'll have a new friend to talk about the books with and the next time somebody starts in on how Harry Potter is evil and they'd never let their kid read a book about witchcraft it won't even bother me.&nbsp; I'll think of it as me not having to lend out my quickly wearing copy so it'll be there for the kid who needs to know that somewhere across the ocean there's a kid who's family is just as bad or worse, and no one is saving him either, but somehow he's making it and maybe they can too.

      I do a lot of ranting.&nbsp; I know it and I'm not ashamed of it, but every now and again I try to stop and think about the things that I am pleased about.&nbsp; I thought I'd mention it here.&nbsp; I went to the beach on Saturday with Ana and Joey.&nbsp; Had a great time.&nbsp; It was in the 70's but Joey felt like swimming anyway, so he splashed and discovered the remains of horseshoe crabs and seashells for hours until his lips turned purple and I forced him out of the water and into dry towels, at which point he tells me that the water was dirty and I never should have let him go in.&nbsp; As soon as he was dry he asked to go back in again.&nbsp; Some poor father waited too late to leave the beach and was left with a screaming monster of a daughter who hated everything he did and was illogical as sleepy kids are, she wanted to go home but didn't want to leave, wanted to be dry, but didn't want to take her wet things off.&nbsp; He got really frustrated and kept grabbing her elbow and whisper yelling 'you better stop it'.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ana stared at this guy for ten minutes, forget if looks could kill, it looked like if she'd had a weapon she would've.&nbsp; They both sang loudly all the way home.&nbsp; I'm having another email affair (for lack of a better word),&nbsp; I've known Erica from my church for a while, but when she goes away we decide to develop a relationship, this is how it went with Joanna.&nbsp; It's really weird cause I'm more of a talker, but I like it, it's personal, there are no interruptions, no sideways glances, and you say what you think and aren't so busy trying to gauge reactions.&nbsp; She has a great blog&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink http://www.ilovewords.blogspot.com/ &nbsp;check it out. Anthony's been getting up with the kids when he's home to let me sleep in, he even closes the door and says go back to sleep.&nbsp; Lolade sent me her old camera, it's the best free camera ever.&nbsp; Everyone loves Chicago, Erica's there, Deron just went said the trip was life changing, Tameaka went and said she can't wait to go back.&nbsp; Josh and James called me drunk last night.&nbsp; I find myself on the phone with someone when James is in the background not too infrequently, he never makes a point to talk to me and neither do I to him.&nbsp; Our love is a more in person thing, but every now and again after a few beers or some shots James or someone he's with calls and he makes a point of talking to me.&nbsp; It brightened up my night.&nbsp; He told me Josh couldn't let me on their blog cause it's only for boys voices.&nbsp;  urlLink http://www.sunsgonnarise.com &nbsp; Penis power is okay by me and it turned out good, though I don't really get why they have four writers when it's only really Josh that posts.

      In the previous post I mentioned a parallel in the wording of Genesis 3:16 and Genesis 4:7.  I am now including, what I thought to be an interesting expounder on the subject.  Let's look at Genesis 3:16. Adam and Eve have both sinned against God. They have distrusted his goodness and turned away from him to depend on their own wisdom for how to be happy. So they rejected His word and they ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God calls them to account and now describes to them what the curse will be on human life because of sin. In Genesis 3:16 God says to the woman, "I will greatly multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children, and your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you."   This is a description of the curse. It is a description of misery, not a model for marriage. This is the way it's going to be in history where sin has the upper hand. But what is really being said here? What is the nature of this ruined relationship after sin?   The key comes from recognizing the connection between the last words of this verse (3:16b) and the last words of Genesis 4:7. Here God is warning Cain about his resentment and anger against Abel. God tells him that sin is about to get the upper hand in his life. Notice at the end of the verse 7: "Sin is crouching at the door; its desire is for you, but you must master it (literally: you shall rule over it)."   The parallel here between 3:16 and 4:7 is amazingly close. The words are virtually the same in Hebrew, but you can see this in the English as well. In 3:16 God says to the woman, "Your desire is for your husband, and he shall rule over you." In 4:7 God says to Cain, "Sin's desire is for you, and you shall rule over it."   Now the reason this is important to see is that it shows us more clearly what is meant by "desire." When 4:7 says that sin is crouching at the door of Cain's heart (like a lion, Genesis 49:9) and that it's desire is for him, it means that sin wants to overpower him. It wants to defeat him and subdue him and make him the slave of sin.   Now when we go back to 3:16 we should probably see the same meaning in the sinful desire of woman. When it says, "Your desire shall be for your husband," it means that when sin has the upper hand in woman she will desire to overpower or subdue or exploit man. And when sin has the upper hand in man he will respond in like manner and with his strength subdue her, or rule over her.   So what is really described in the curse of 3:16 is the ugly conflict between the male and female that has marked so much of human history. Maleness as God created it has been depraved and corrupted by sin. Femaleness as God created it has been depraved and corrupted by sin. The essence of sin is self-reliance and self-exaltation. First in rebellion against God, and then in exploitation of each other.   So the essence of corrupted maleness is the self-aggrandizing effort to subdue and control and exploit women for its own private desires. And the essence of corrupted femaleness is the self-aggrandizing effort to subdue and control and exploit men for its own private desires. And the difference is found mainly in the different weaknesses that we can exploit in one another.   As a rule men have more brute strength than women and so they can rape and abuse and threaten and sit around and snap their finger. It's fashionable to say those sorts of things today. But it's just as true that women are sinners. We are in God's image male and female; and we are depraved, male and female. Women may not have as much brute strength as men but she knows ways to subdue him. She can very often run circles around him with her words and where her words fail she knows the weakness of his lust.   If you have any doubts about the power of sinful woman to control sinful man just reflect for a moment on the number one marketing force in the world — the female body. She can sell anything because she knows the universal weakness of man and how to control him with it. The exploitation of women by sinful men is conspicuous because it is often harsh and violent. But a moment's reflection will show you that the exploitation of men by sinful women is just as pervasive in our society. The difference is that our sinful society sanctions the one perversity and not the other. (There are societies that do just the opposite.)

      Make sure you read Josh's comment to Mary Magdalene.  I gotta say I had to read it like five times to understand what he was saying because I was just so blown away that Josh was quoting the bible.  I felt it necessary to respond as I felt there was a misunderstanding and I just love to talk about all things relating to God.  I must warn the readers that I have herein written things that are different and some contradictory to Josh's comments.  One should not attempt to do so without fully realizing that Josh loves to argue, moreso than I, if you can believe it, he is also damn good (get this he's been writing and doing mock trials for years) at it and usually wins.  In light of that fact consider me reckless for posting this or consider me wanting to be verbally spanked, but since I do so love the sport I often find myself voicing a differing or opposing viewpoint.  I would like to clarify that I don't now nor did I at the time of the posting of the Mary Magdalene piece believe the idea of Mary Magdalene being Jesus' wife would be a strike against women or her credibility.  To make clear my belief on the matter is that you cannot prove either she was or was not as there just isn't much written about her.  It is greatly controversial, as it is a commonly held belief that Jesus had no need to gratify himself sexually so he would not have married.  In my opinion it is neither here nor there, because his marriage would not have been a sin and according to Hebrews 4:15 (For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who was tempted in every way, just as we are yet was without sin.) he was made in the flesh so that he could understand our weaknesses.  I wouldn't say that the desire for marital sex is a weakness, but even if you assume it to be so, it makes sense for Jesus to have experienced it.  On the other hand, he was a very busy traveling man who may not have had time for a wife.  I was trying to make a point of the irony in saying that the assumptions made on the means of her wealth are presuming and not based on much evidence and then presuming that she was Jesus' wife.  Mary is assumed to be a prostitute primarily because it is believed that she was unmarried and Magdala was a city destroyed for its fornication and because seven demons were cast out of her.  She is assumed to be the wife of Jesus primarily because of the gospel of Philip which says:  And the companion of the [...] Mary Magdalene. [...] loved her more than all the disciples, and used to kiss her often on her [...]. The rest of the disciples [...]. They said to him "Why do you love her more than all of us?" The Savior answered and said to them, "Why do I not love you like her? When a blind man and one who sees are both together in darkness, they are no different from one another. When the light comes, then he who sees will see the light, and he who is blind will remain in darkness."  [...] are holes in the text made by ants.  The kiss could be the kind a husband and wife shares or the kind the kind shared in the churches (Paul says greet each other with a holy kiss in Romans and Corinthians 1 and 2. As for Jesus loving her more than the rest, I think the blindness and the light could be a reference to Mary proving that she truly believed in all Jesus said and maybe how she proved that by being witness to his resurrection and telling the other disciples (according to the gospel of Mary they didn't believe her at first.). I thought it defeatist to such feminist scholars to imply that the assumed prostitution was wrong and created by masogynists as an assasination on her character, and in an effort to combat that theory and give her character credibility and assumption must be made that she was the wife of Jesus.  I see them as equally presuming and thusly counterproductive to an argument against such presumptions.  I also think that it would be underimining her role to stress her importance lying in her marriage to Jesus rather than what she did and was. I would rather stand out for my own beliefs and words and works than to stand out for being Anthony's wife.  On the other hand Ant ain't Jesus. I also thought it better to argue what is more clear, that she was really important, possibly most important of all people, to Jesus, as opposed to making the leap to marriage, as again I'll say you could argue either point with no end in sight.  As to the piece on the tenses in the original Hebrew, Hebrew tense is largely unlike English.  In Hebrew you have the perfect (completed) and the imperfect (incomplete) tenses.  You desire is for your husband and he does rule over you and your desire will be for your husband and he will rule over you would have the same tense.  As a Christian I believe that the Bible is the best tangible guide to discipleship of Christ.  I also recall that in Genesis the serpent twisted God's words to fit his purpose, and I think that this is still a common practice.  I think you must interpret the message of the Bible for yourself through prayer, in doing such I do not believe that I have cause to acknowledge that the Bible gives women a position subordinate to women as I do not believe that is God's word.  I think it is in the interpretation and the context that it is percieved that way.  The Hebrew word for spirit is ruach, which is a feminine noun.  In the beginning of Creation we know that God and the Ruach HaQodesh (Holy Spirit) existed.  You cannot seperate Elohim (the Hebrew word for God) from the Ruach HaQodesh, in fact Elohim is a plural noun, as it ecompasses the also the Holy Spirit or the trinity. I believe that is the way it is intended to be on earth male and female to be necessary to each other to help each other and not for one to be subordinate to the other.

      There are some really interesting theories floating around amongst Christian feminist scholars.  They are saying that some of things in the Bible regarding women were either misinterpreted or  purposely misleading to strengthen male roles.  Genesis 3:16 NIV says ...Your desire will be for your husband and he will rule over you.  These scholars believe that it was actually your desire is for your husband and he rules over you.  One is a prescription for how things will be and the other is a statement of how things are.  Then there's issues over Mary Magdalene, the scholars say that there is no evidence whatsoever that she was a prostitute.  They assume it was assumed that she was because it is known that she financially supported Jesus and the disciples to some extent, however she was unmarried and seemingly independently wealthy. It is known that she was very important to Jesus some say that she was the 13th disciple others say Jesus' wife.  Now here's the part that seems a bit defeatist she doesn't have to be a prostitute because she had money, but she has to be Jesus' wife to have been important to what he was doing?  In one of the books that didn't make the cut into the bible, Peter asks Mary what Jesus revealed to her personally and what she reveals deals more with the metaphysical or Gnostic principles. Apparently Jesus had not gotten into that sort of teaching with the twelve disciples.  This angered Peter and he asked her why would Jesus reveal something like that to you a woman, but not us.  One of the other disciples stepped in and said something to the effect of if she was important to Jesus who are we to question it. But it was Mary who was there when he crucified and there when he rose.  The weird thing is nearly 2000 year later Christianity is not that vastly different.  Women can teach, but the men must lead. Women can be leaders, but not the chiefs.  I am aware that the bible has men as the leaders of the church and home, but isn't that contextual.  Did Jesus in all his time spent on children and women and the poor the nobodies of that society ever say that men were to be the leaders.  I have thought and thought and though I can think of examples in which a man would be better for the job I can think of just as many where a woman would be better for the job.  I shudder to think that the most important role a woman can play in advancing God's kingdom would be pastor's wife, and I shudder to think that in order for Mary Magdalene to have been valuable to Christ's mission at the time she had to be his wife as opposed to his friend, follower, and confidant.

      So plenty of my vegan and vegetarian friends have petitioned me to give up meat because of the awful steroids.  I admit steroids probably suck but, it's an issue of cost and convenience for me so I never really gave it much thought until recently.  Now anyone who's ever been around for long knows that my darling seventeen months old daughter is evil.  She furrows her eyebrows if you say anything to her without smiling, if you tell her to stop doing something she cries and asks to be held and seemingly lovingly buries her face into your shoulder, then she bites or digs her nails into your arm, or pinches.  She often confuses hello Ana for an attack and will smack the one who offered it hard across the face.  Unfortunately this offender is usually her four year old brother Joey and four year old sense of hope won't allow him to heed six year old wisdom, when Josh says stay away from her.  If you leave the computer for the bathroom she's sitting in from of it clicking and clacking away and furrows her eyebrows when you return  She drinks an exorbant amount, nearly a half gallon of milk every day.  So I blame the milk or the steroids in the milk for giving my baby a form of mad cow disease. I blame milk for making my baby evil and for the resulting hole she just made in my arm.

      So it seems you gotta do a whole intro blog and this is it.  I was more than happy reading the blogs of my friends from time to time, but the site wouldn't let me post a comment without registering for a blog, so I set one up but never used it. Until Josh wouldn't let me be the voice of reason and ignorance in keepin it real on his blog, so now I must stand on my own soapbox.  I'd much rather do it with other likeminded people so there wouldn't be so much pressure, but as much trash as I talk I should be able to rant forever.  Oh yeah do me a favor and comment.  It's really weird to just say stuff and no one responds.  Tell me I'm right, tell me I'm crazy, tell me you feel me, or that I'm wrong just tell me something.

      I watched a whole show about reality television the other day.  I felt a little bad cause they painted reality TV viewers as depraved. According to people who actually work for TV they're only about sex, drunkenness, and humiliation.  I get that it's probably just that to the producers, but I think people are always curious about other people's lives perhaps more so in the aforementioned areas.  'See if that was me' is a common phrase, I think people want more situations to say I would've done it this way.  For me it's a great deal of curiosity, how do people live what do they do, why do they do it.  I also like to talk trash from time to time and reality shows fuel that.  As for the humiliation piece maybe for some, but not for me.  I think the situations that humiliate people are funny not the actual humiliation.  Case in point, punk'd, most of the reactions are darn funny, not as much as Ashton talking trash, but close.  However when the person is actually humiliated i.e when Justin Timberlake called his mom in near tears that was sad.  I think identity is also a part of it. It's great to see yourself or people you know on TV.  So when I watched the real world reunion and Frankie's all it's not your problem but I just made it your problem and you misunderstood what I was saying when I said I hate you all and when I was pouting and being sullen and saying I don't wanna be here with these people I was actually having a good time and even though you're all sitting here with arms outstretched saying you'd like to be my friend I don't understand why you all hate me. I thought I knew the only Frankie in the world and have often considered myself incredibly stupid for leaving that hand outstretched. Because every now and again my hand turns into a visit or phone call and a resulting psychotic episode.  Now I know my friend isn't the only Frankie and I'm not the only dummy who, after hearing it's my fault but you did this and that and this wrong, still says lemmie get your number and I'll call you sometime.

      I just saw the commercial for G Unit shoes.  If you haven't seen it three little boys are peeking through a hole in a wharehouse window.  They aren't watching the usual image of Fifty with the Bling chain throwin money around.  They're watchin a shirtless, sweaty Fifty Cent work out.  The shots feature his back and chest.  The kind of shots that would make sense if teenage girls were peering through the window, but no it's three little boys.  Then he takes a drink of water and flashes the camera a come hither glance, and the three little boys run from the window.  Homo eroticism has never really been a hood thing, certainly not pedophilia.                                G-G-G-G- Gay Unit?
