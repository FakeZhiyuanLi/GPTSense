      I just got out of my first final exam (Intermediate Algebra). How did I do? I didn't have a snowballs chance in hell. Flashback to 6 weeks ago today.   It's the first day of the summer terms up at Pensacola Junior College. I know I'm in for one hell of a bumpy ride, as the summer terms are the equivalent of an entire semester packed into six weeks and I'm taking one of the most evil courses known to man: Algebra.   Well, I make it to the college and begin looking for my classroom. I wander around going deeper into the catacombs of the stripmall style buildings and eventually I find it. The door number had been stolen somewhere along the way and somebody wrote the room number with a black permanent marker in its place. "Alright, hopefully the inside isn't as ghetto as the outside" I thought. I opened the door to find a classroom that looks more like the city outskirts elementary school class back from third grade. Water dripping from the ceiling had made a large dark spot in the middle of the room where the carpet was starting to get moldy, the at least two lights had burned out and it had apparently been used for storage earlier in the year.   I made it into class on time and the professor comes rolling in about ten minutes late. She then sits on her desk and greets us with three simple, fate sealing words: "I hate math". We all looked at each other and realized that it was all over before it started. We were gonna fail because of a lousy teacher.  She then went into a twenty minute story of how much she hated math her whole life and that she graduated from high school with a 1.3 average and how she had to retake her math courses several times. Oh yes, we were screwed.  My last hope was that she would make up for it by being good at teaching. Wrong again, she couldn't teach someone how to boil water, let alone teach us something she hates and that we suck at in the first place.  Flashforward to present time, and surprise, I failed. Big shock there.   My second course was just a basic computer science course that I ended up teaching some of it ;) The final on it took me about ten minutes and I passed with 91%

      I just finished the entire powerpoint book for my computer course in like, 2 hours. These 6-week summer terms are intense. The only somewhat hard one for this class though was Excel. I will post a pic of the stack of books I went through in such a short time.   Anyway, I'm just chillin till the end of class since I don't have my drivers license until either later tonight or payday and am stuck waiting for my ride. Since my mom broke her arm 2 days ago (she's alright, and it will heal after a while good as new) we have to wait for my brother to get off work so he can drive up here. So I'm gonna be waiting at least 3 hours.   Believe it or not, I don't have anything really to rage about at the moment. Since I'm hungry and broke I'm going to walk over to the mall and beg for samples and such. Getting across the street is like playing a first person version of Frogger.  Wish me luck so I don't get a game over.  -Stryyp    Links   Heres a Picture of  urlLink My Desktop . The wallpaper pwns, and if anyone has any more anti-RIAA wallpaper, post me a link.

      Alright, I decided to start this blog when I saw a friends (edRoach) blog and thought "Hey, this is kinda cool". Now that I have it up 1 of 2 things are probably going to happen:  1. I will never post anything useful except information related to whatever im currently ranting about or  2. I will never post anything at all.  But I may end up putting this thing to good use. Who knows? I may use it to post links to pictures of myself (and my new puppies I promised to show pictures of) and just daily life stuff. Anyway, I'm bored with the intro post already so I'm outta here for now.  -Stryyp
