       Mood - Nuetral    Music&nbsp;- 'Definately Maybe' by FM Static   &nbsp;&nbsp;  Well I made it to Texas and I survived the endless Spanish, Fountain Of Relatives, and the horrible Tejuano music. I have to admit that I did have some fun along the way. With 31 cousins in the same house at one time and a barbeque going (accompanied by alcohol) you can't get too bored. These daym mexican's are half the population of the world(!), I'm tellin' ya! We multiply like rabbits! I got to know my family a lot better and found that half of them have been in jail. Now if thats not cool I dont know what is (In a scary kinda way). And they all ended up in jail for stab'n, shoot'n, or killing&nbsp;someone&nbsp;(Cough Uncle Benny Cough). Imagine my surprise when he is telling me all these stories and I am sitting 2 inches from him. No matter half the torture I did benefit from this trip. I walked away with a new found appreciation for the english language, a cell phone bill higher then the Empire State Building (not exactly a benefit.), I learned that I hate small confined spaces (Because I flew there on a pencil with wings!!!), and 2000 dollars worth of clothes and other apparel all curtisey of my fathers credit card.   Ya know what, I actually missed this gawd forsaken little town and all of its contents. More so the familiarity of the area and the people that are associated with it. Yes... shock... I got home-sick. Half the time my father left me with my relatives while he went out with his friend Jeff till 2:00 in the AM. But I walked away with half of his life saveings so I guess I shouldn't complain, lol.   Ya know what... screw the small talk. I'm leave'n I'm grumpy and horny and I jes' UGH! TTYL! Lol

      Mood - Bitter sweet. Music - 'Gifts And Curses' by Yellowcard.        No matter how many times you tell people or post it on the WORLD WIDE WEB that you don't wake up until 3-4:00 in the AM you still get those lingering calls at 9:00 in the dern' morning! Thats exactly how I woke up today and what made it worse was that it was the wrong number. How pleasant =|! So I started my day at 9:00 in the AM. That lasted till about 9:02 at which I fell face first back into my pillow and continued my day like that until 3:00 in the PM. So when I finally woke up I talked to a few people on the phone, watched a little TV, got something to eat, and headed to the ole' computer. Seems to be a daily occurance of events, huh?     I found out that I'm not the only person getting pranked, yay! Billi Sue, Danielle, Lindsay, Sylvia, and Chris are all victims. At this rate those bastards with have an unruly mob after them. And yes... I did get prank called again today. It was some computer soundboard about doing push-ups with your boner. I played along because hell, its not every day that you get to hear about that! It was funni until that daym thang asked me if I would screw, then it was annoying. So I might just call the police office. I usually handle shyt myself but seeing these people caught and in much more trouble then I can administer in pain... well thats just flat out amuzing. We have a few ideas on who these people are, and I already know who's prank'n Lindsay. If they are the same people prank'n the rest of us I will shoot them and then run over them with a stolen car... TWICE! With many many angry people. =O and a bulletin just arrived. Someone told Emily that I (of all fucking people in this entire town) am the one prank calling people. That burns my daym biscuits! Yes, I have nothing better to do then prank people and then be pissed about it. Uh huh. Whoever said that needs to get their gawd daym facts straight before I run over them with a car too!    Nothing too eventful even happened today other then the uplift in the prank calling case and the rumor that I am culprit. I felt like Shirlock trying to make a list of possible people with access to all these numbers. After all that excitement (Psh! Riiiight...) I went on a run through my neighborhood. I came back feeling a whole mile worth of 90 degree weather, holy shyt. From that point on it has purty much been conversations with friends and listen'n to music. I made a bunch of new friends this summer by the way! Tyler Stuart (He wants me, lol), James Shrieves (I have no idea who this crazii fuck is but he thinks I'm hott), some guys named Kyle and Anton that I supposedly order'd pencil shaveings from, Makon Schmidt, Kevin, & Josh Daniels (Backwoods hicks from Dixon), Cody Nelson and some other nasty little boy (bleh!), etc. Interesting individuals at that, lemme' tell ya! Lol. Its been crazii    Well the count down is come'n to a close on my trip to Texas. 3 Days left! I'm kind of glad to get out of this place for a while. I'll miss some people while I'm gone though. Watch, just my luck, when I leave something spectacular will happen and I will be the only one not there for it! Hrm... shopping and travel'n around my beloved Texas with family and old friends or waiting for something 'spectacular' to happen in Waynesville? Okay, nothing all that extravagent could ever happen around here, so I think I'm safe. I would be highly pissed if they caught the prankers before my friends and I though. That would mean no bloodshed before hand... and thats never any fun!   OMG! I found out the most shocking horrible thing about myself in my entire life. I like country music! I mean holy fuck! See thats what I get for make'n friends with Dixon people on Post during that July 3rd fireworks show and concert. I sat through that ENTIRE concert... and ya know what... IT WAS COUNTRY! It dirty'd my rock infested mind! I actually sat here and listened to a few country songs today, and then I relized it all progressed with that Gretchen Wilson song 'Redneck Woman'. *Shudder* Billi Sue called and I told her what I was doing and she laughed at me! But that also is no suprise because its done often, thanx BS, lol. I told her not to go and tell the whole world and what does she do? Changes her gawd daym MSN name to "What Lisa? You like what? I think it starts with COUNTRY." Don't I have great friends? Thats okay because I retaliated. Hers a hint... shes terrified of 'small' things ;). BUT ANYWAYZ... lol. I'm sure I'm going to get a load of crap about all this later from everyone so I might as well roll with the punches.    Ya know who didn't get online today? Starts with a 'Jon' and ends with a 'FAKE MEXICAN LIE'N ASS'! Well shyt, I gave it away. He usually gets on every day, I wonder whats going on? *Bright shiney haylo* Oh dern'! That was also another highlight of the day. That, and I also learned a whole bunch of stuff about him from anonymous people, all happenin' to be girls.. ones that he has pissed off and lied to no doubt. How horrible. Lol!    Well I guess I'm gonna go. Not much to post today. Still I ended up with another half of the bible. Hopefully Bo will be back tommorrow, I miss his goofy ass :). Have a nice night!  A look at 2morrow's happenings...  - Volleyball.  - Trip to the pool.  - Phone and computer as usual.  - Need'n to call muh' dad.  - In desperate need of something fun!  Lates and happi reading - Lisa

      Mood - Royaly pissed! Music - 'The Melting Point Of Wax' by Thrice    Well today was definately not what I expected. Not at all what I would consider a good alternative to my plans. Everything that I had on that little list fell through. All except for me being at Carol's at the crack of dawn. Yes indeedy, 11:00 in the AM is what I consider early. Daym early! And to wake up that early to a phone ringing in your ear and Carol's voice on the other end isn't exactly pleasant. I usually don't wake up till 1-3:00 in the PM. I suppose my insomnia has something to do with it, huh? So I dragged my ass out of bed and got dressed... kinda... and made a dash for her house. At this point I am debateing on turning around and climbin' back in my nice warm bed where the sun isn't blinding me and I don't have to worry about anyone seeing my bed hair!    Needless to say I made it up her driveway and tromped into her house looking a mess. I don't get a 'Thanx for comeing Lisa!' or 'Goodmorning!'... I get laughed at for the squinty half asleep look I am sporting. Gee, thanx. So Makon finally calls and I'm still not looking or sounding any better by then. Something got mixed up in conversation and everything we had planned hit ground zero. Not too bad, there will always be another time right? So we decide to have some fun anyway. We run around the house listen'n to music and what not the entire day and I head home around 3:30. On the ride home I'm thinking 'Well wasn't that a great start to a shitty day?'. I thought too soon when it crossed my mind that my day could possibly get better. Not by a long shot.    Yay, I'm finally home. Back in the safety of my dull lit room and a phone and computer by my side! Music of my choice just a click away and a comfy pair of Sofee! Okay so... maybe things were looking up. Neh! The plans with the Skate crew also fell through somehow as well. But okay, when all else fails... sleep. Nope, not happening either. Phones ringing off the hook, dogs wanting outside, rents and their consistant nagging. Jezuz christ! So I decide to get on the net and talk to my trusty friends! One big mistake after another.    Ya know it has never really dawned on me how much I hate guys! Not exactly all of them but a good 90%. Stupid little boys that think that since you have things in common or you look good they know you and want you! But your special right(?), because they have never liked anyone like they have liked you within the 2.5 minutes in which they have seen your picture and said hi. Right *rolling eyes*. Okay so I could deal with that for a while, until some dumb fuck messes with my friends. Not only does he mess with my friends emotions but I JUST stuck up for him the night before when he told me how much he likes this one girls and blah blah blah. So that little sunama' bitch got his nuts ripped off and shoved down his throat along with a few choice expressions. If he doesn't like the truth thats just too damn bad(!), Suck it up and chew on that Jon Morten. I mean... *Cough cough*. Fucking washed up player with no daym game and even worse self respect.    But on a much happier note Bo is comeing back soon! I'm so happi! After all this shyt I know hes the one person that can make me smile without a second thought. And I thank him so much for being... well... him. Atleast theres one reminder out there that not ALL guys are like that fuck up in the paragraph above.    But anywho...   Well its now 4 days till I am Texas bound, and I am daym happi to be out of this crazy place for atleast 2 weeks. Okay, some scary fuck just called me and whispered 'Hello, is this Kim? Why aren't you Kim? YOUR SUPPOSED TO BE KIM!'. Thats like something from the Ring! Kinda gave me the chills... bleh'! I hate prank callers. Caller ID is worthless these days, people finally wised up and decided to block their numbers when they do it. I swear I get one of these calls like EVERY night. Start'n to get a little irritate'n. If you can tell me who it is I will give you 10 dollars and let you watch me beat the shyt out of them! *Offer subject to change depending on money situation*. Haha.    Well I guess I'm going to drag myself off to bed. Next time someone calls I'm putting out a daym report or something. You guys are part of the reason my site is called 'Mental Daym Fuckation... that and its just a cool lookin' expression, lol. I can't believe I made it through this day unmedicated!  Tomorrow's Agenda  - Start packing.  - Talk to a few people on the phone and online.  - Threat'n anyone who calls at a suspicious time.  - Maybe take Caleb's movie back to him. *Thanx Caleb!*  Lates! _-Lisa-_

      Mood - Missing Bo. Music - 'President Of What?' by Death Cab For Cutie  Hey everyone!   Well its summer alright. Sweltering hot outside (as hot as Waynesville Missouri can get, lol) which is a nice change from lack of feeling in your ass from frost bite, the pool is open, summer school is out (THANK GAWD!), and kids are still sitting at home with nothing to do in the afternoon except watch the next Reality TV series premiering on every other channel. In all honesty I am about ready to go back to school. Not for the work, hell no, but the social interaction. After about 2 days straight in the house cabin fever sets in and I contemplate digging an escape hole in my bedroom floor with my guitar pick or playing with the little Christian kids down the street. Either way I'm damned.   Haha, now summer hasn't been all as bad as I make it sound. But all I have heard from people so far are complaints. Not that they aren't legitimate. Personally I'm not trying to let something like a breakup or fight try to stop me from enjoying my summer. But everywhere I turn its drama and mayhem. And all the luck to ya my friends, jes' keep me out of it. Ah, the perks to finally being single... none of that what so ever. I think even if I did claim a cutie tomorrow I would be too daym busy to argue... let alone acknowledge him. I could pencil in eye contact for the beginning of August though, so if you are into no social, physical, or mental contact with the girl of your dreams you jes' give me a holler alright ;)?   Man when I say I'm busy I mean I'm busy. First of all I have my nights and days mixed up. I am such an insomniac! I wake up at 3:00PM and go to sleep at the crack of dawn in the AM. Its 2:05 AM right now, see what I mean? I have volleyball open gym's to attend to, a car wash to organize, publicity stunts for the Pulaski County Humane society, parties to go to, parties to have, cleaning to do, instruments to practice, friends to talk to, a Freshmen Orientation to conduct, and then at the end of the day I shuck the corn and milk the cows. Just kiddin' with the farm shyt. Other then that I am booked with all this mess. And on top of this I am being shipped off to Texas for 2 weeks to visit my father and help job hunt and house hunt for our place in California. *shudder*... I am such a southern girl, California just isn't on my vocab list.    Huh? What? California!? Yea, I know... California. I have lived in the po-dunk little town of Waynesville Missouri (We like to refer to as 'The Ville') for nearly my entire existence. I love this place but I am also complaining at the same time. There is little to do here but there is always someone to do 'nothing' with... because lets face it... in a place where the population is about as big as the number of times Michael Jackson has lost his nose your bound to know jes' about everybody and their brother. Its nice, yet annoying. Countless times my friends have been there for me. I just can't picture life without these people! And to go to a place inhabited by thousands of unfamiliar fast lane people as opposed to the horribly slow country life of this place... well its hard to imagine. Now if I could pick where I'm going... it would be Texas. New Bronfolds Texas!    If you can't tell by now you have to know me to be interested in this because I am just venting. I have to admit though, my rants and raves are pretty entertaining when I go back and read them. But enough about all that. On a much happier note... what has happened to me that's relatively good? Well keeping busy is kinda fun and I have met a lot of new people this summer. Forth of July weekend was crazy, a mad dash to Cabool in a stolen car that travels at a earth shattering speed of 85 MPH (and without a license *GASP*), guys, guys, Cabool guys, Dixon guys, more guys, parties, drinking, sneaking out, new experiences... most of this has been fun. Yes... I said guys.     I met a great guy recently! A Cabool boy in fact. No, no, no, not Adam. Bo! His real name is Johnny, but we call him Bo. (Don't Ask! Don't wanna' know.) Wow, did I ever fall for him. Beneath his tough exterior he is a huge teddybear. Oh shyt, but I didn't tell you that.*Tee Hee.* I am not big on long distance relationships at all, but this guy would be worth it in so many ways... lemme' tell ya! He is the complete opposite of everyone I have ever dated. Hes blonde, religious, he works on a farm, and of all things... I used to hate him! But that's a whole different long ass story. And if you are really that interested (bless your bored heart if you are) then ask me about it and I wont spare a single 3 hour detail. Anywayz... even though he is kind of everything I never looked for I just can't tell you enough about him. I have found the best qualities in him, some I have never seen before, and every time I talk to him he just amazes me more and more. I happen to miss him a whole hell of a lot at this moment because hes in IL for 5 days, dern!   I know Carol is gonna smack me later because she has to hear me talk about him all the time but hey... I can't help it ;). Wow, this has become a very long and exhausting first entry. I think I'll leave you with that!  Preview of tomorrow's events... - Carol's at 10:00 in the AM (if I don't throw the alarm clock) - 'The Ville' Park with Makon, Josh, and friends. - Back home to hang with Tyler, Darren, and the skater crew. - Another sleepless night and another entry in this lovely blog.  Lates and happi reading! Lisa

      Well... another loss of a perfectly rainy day. I remember when I was little I would run around with an umbrella and jump in the mudd puddles. Where did those days end? I have a feeling this post is going to be a lot more somber then most. I mean what is there to write about when the house is humid and cold and the rest of the world is rainy and in shades of gray. I hate rain and the mood it sets. School starts on the 12th, yay! 8 days away and then back to work. Its always about this time that I talk about how happi I am school is about to start and what not and then as soon as it does and I get assigned my first report I am count'n down the days till summer. I'm wondering who my locker partner is gonna be first of all. I know that should be the least of my worries but its kind of a major thing to me. If its someone that I don't like they are just gonna have to deal with it when I drop my books on there head. Learn to to piss me off! If its someone I like then they will find our locker neatly organized and decorated with spirit grams that include that they exist in that locker too. Thats the perks of not have'n my foot up your ass =D! Last year my locker partner and I didn't get to see much of eachother because I rarely ever used my locker and I didn't do much decorate'n for that matter but I'm gonna be use'n my locker a lot more now that it will be on the 2nd floor. Its beyond me why we have a multi-million dollar penitentury lookin school and we still have to share lockers. I guess I don't mind. As of now I haven't taken many steps to get back into the swing of things for the school year. I still have my nights and days mixed up, I do have all my school clothes... but nothing picked out for the first day (I'll throw it together that morning),  I'm trying to put my binder together as we speak, I need to buy a shoulder bag for my books and shyt, and I still need to go to Journeys and buy those shoes. I have a million and one flip flops... every color of the rainbow and ever design imaginable... but I usually only wear my white, black, or brown ones. Flip flops are get'n a lil' old, dontcha' think. The only thing thats lasted as long as the fad of Flipper Floppers is flared jeans, and that I don't mind. What is it with people and make'n bands here in Waynesville? I know of about 5 bands right now and I have maybe heard 3 of them. Fiddlehead, David Churches old band, and then Will's band. Now all of a sudden here comes Jon Aviles and Stephanie Fowler ('Critical Issues' *Raised Eyebrow* ) and their bands. Oh, and muh' best friend has a band (Yay! Go Nickster!). Good luck to yall I guess. Hope no one sucks too bad. Personally I could never be in a band or even start one for that matter. I hate playing with people, I hate havein' to have structure, I know daym well we aren't gonna go anywhere, and I don't committ well to anything. I have better things to do with my time... but good luck anyway. If you are talented and driven' enough to do it, more power to ya. I guess I'll try to go get more of my binder and what not done. I'll talk atcha' later. Thanx for stop'n by.  Lates, Lisa.
