       Finally, I decided to start writing a blog. But the problem is, what should i really write abt? Myself? Yesterday ended beautifully, for I meet out with my secondary sch classmates... Really missed them,esp the times when we all worked hard to prepare for the 'o' levels and everything else which happened in class. Wonder if they think that way too... Had been thinking about the many things which happened to me last year... Left the sch which i had studied in for 4 long years, spend lotz of time with my choir mates, having the SYF 2003 thingy whereby everyone cried so hard... Is it so impt that it will be in our memories forever, or is it just part of our life whereby we willl forget about it one fine day? I really wish to know the answer...

       Having mixed feelings now...  Just finished&nbsp;the bcs presentation, was okay lar... But&nbsp;we are in the first group to present, then was like everything was fast, and i didn't even elaborate page by page for the website... luckily, the tutor made a copy to take a look at that himself...   Wasn't feeling very good b4 the presentation, someone said somethings which makes me know what real friends are for... Might be a joke, but it ain't that funny anyway...( *note: I'm angry with that someone!) Then you all will think that I'm petty, but those who know me well should know that I not a person who can take these as a joke.   But after reading those comments from my friends for my previous blog entry, I'm glad that I still have them with me... You all brightens my day. Anyway, who's annoymous who wrote a comment? please tell me who you are... It's nice knowing that the&nbsp;people you cared for, cares for you! Take care, my friends!   Also, to those from Jyss 4E3, sorry that the bbq on 7th August is cancelled... Ms Teo's not free lah... Maybe,we can meet for dinner or lunch some other time?

Finally, i realised that it ain't that easy to be studying in poly... Just something for you all out there:  It's always a good to receive a msg, a call, a letter, an email from you all... For i know that you are healthy and safe out there... Take care, no matter where you are,for yourself and for others who cares for you!

       A terrible day for me a year ago! When Junyuan Choir fails to get a silver for SYF 2003...  Yesterday was rather okay,met huileng over lunch and had a short chat. went to the lab after sch to rush for the BCS project, met Weiping there( for the first time in TP)... Had this great feeling whenever i get to meet my sec. sch friends, guess I really miss them much...  Will be having my first online test of TP in abt 30 mins...so i should be reading my notes instead of writing but whatever...  Anyway, it's Ms Michelle Tay and Ms ong Peiwen's birthday today...

       I really miss my secondary school friends badly, but we are drifting further and further apart as the days passed...  Before graduating, everyone was like 'please take care' and 'do remember me', 'meet whenever possible, k?' But now? We will still tell each other to take care, but meeting each other seemed impossible... Why is this so? Are we really that busy that we couldn't meet, sit down and chat? Why is it always a 'hi' and 'bye' conversations between us...?  I miss my choir pals too... We were so bonded together during that SYF period, and now, it's like everyone is busy with thier own stuff... leaving only ZZ in choir now... Our instructor left... Haiz~ A year had passed after SYF 2003... Sad~ I wonder how my juniors are doing now... Know that they will be performing for the National Day Parade 2004... Getting excited to see them on TV... Haiz~ What extremely mixed feelings I have now! That's all

       Well, I  have been rather busy packing these days... The more I pack, the more I throw things away, especially those which I have kept for N years...  Will be rather busy these week, to be packing and unpacking things, doing projects, and stuff...  All of a sudden, I miss choral music... Wonder what my brain consist, giving me such a complex life!

       I have just counted...  In 10 days time, I will be leaving the place where i lived for 11 years... My beloved HDB flat in some part of Tampines, my favourite place in the world... and soon, i will be leaving to another... I just loved this 5- room flat...  It went through with me the many big things which happened in my life...And it's really sad to know that it will be an empty space very soon and a new family will be moving it...renovating it differently from the way it used to look like... I told my sis that I will return one day, buy the flat over, and renovate it the way it's like now... But it's rather stupid for me... to be writing such a long entry just because i'm moving soon... SAD!

       Well, after many tries of invalid password and username... i got in!  Wonder what i should write abt... Get to know many new friends in poly, they are fun-loving and friendly... but i still missed my ex-classmates...whatever!  Had a wonderful sleep last night,guessed that i'm too stress over things recently...  Dunno why, but it's like life kinda weird to me nowadays... guess i'm still under the stage of adapting to things...  That's all for now!

       Hey ppl, sorry that i have not been blogging for quite a long time...  The past few days was okay, I went for a field trip in Grand Corpthone hotel, it was okay la... then i went to Orchard with my friend and the both of us are feeling very pain lor, cause we are wearing heels and walking along Orchard road...  Been watching quite a number of tv programmes these days and typing my work... Will be rushing for projects soon... I'm just a last- minute person...lolx...  Heard from my friends in sec sch that they have got their 'O' level chinese results le... Some did well, some did not... Well, for those who have done well, a good job done. For those who have not, continue to work hard... I, nyself retook my 'O' levels chinese, it ain't that bad though!  Just something to add on... If you met a person who's very much a like to another in terms of behaviour, would you mistook the first for the latter???  Answer?

       I know that I have not been blogging for long, so sorry about it. It's not that I have got nothing to write about, it's just that I dun know how to describe the feelings I have in mind.  I have just received a message from an ex- schoolmate, we may not talk a lot in school, just some "Hi" and "Bye"... But she let me know that I was there to help her when she needs me. I like this side of mine, for being able to help someone I consider a friend. On the other hand, I'm als glad that I met this kind of friends, who were there to talk to me and give me advice whenever I need them.  Sometimes life's unpredictable, we do not know what will happen to us in the next minute, so do cherish things before you...
