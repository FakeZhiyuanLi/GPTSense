      I suppose that one ought to keep one's reading carefully segregated, but quite often bizarre juxtapositions of ideas and people jump out of the pages. Today I am wondering how Prince Myshkin, the protagonist of  urlLink Dostoevsky's   urlLink  The Idiot   would feel about the colonisation of  urlLink Mars . Isn't that a strange notion?  In the book, Myshkin is portrayed as the only consistently good man among a babbling throng of partygoers and intriguing scions. Though he is subject to strange and sudden pangs of love (like the rest of us), he soberly and silently acts with generosity and kindness, even when those around him try to take advantage of him. I think of Myshkin as admirable, and would do well to live my life as simply and honestly as he. But that quiet sensitivity is part of a quiet life, a life of gatherings and visiting cards and concerts in the park.   Going to Mars, on the other hand, is wild, unpredictable, risky, and supremely technical. Vast scientific endeavors are both bigger and smaller than the everyday decisions that we make as good human beings; they require insight and knowledge and hunger for exploration. Doing good science requires an impassivity, perhaps an indifference to the more domestic virtues, or at least a sense of the pure good of advancing progress.  Perhaps my thought is simply one of incongruity, and indeed it is hard to imagine a culture of unchecked scientific and technical progress amidst the dark and felt-panelled drawing rooms of 19th century Russia. But it does seem to me that these two philosophies of the world are at odds. Myshkin's philosophy is essentially conservative, with the preservation of culture and family and friends and even property given great weight. The ingenuity and wild imagination that I admire so much in artists and scientists, though, is anything but conservative. The very progressive push to want more, to evolve, to be more than we are now, is a tendency that would hardly fit in such a conservative philosophy.   Of course, it is hardly original to notice that one can hold contradictory ideas simultaneously. Still, this is a point that could justify some further thought. Are the conservative concepts of preservation and justice and stewardship at odds with a creative and progressive technocracy?

      The expression, "Beyond the pale" was originally a reference to Irish land, at least according to  urlLink dictionary.com :  Pale: &nbsp; The limits or territory within which alone the English conquerors of Ireland held dominion for a long period after their invasion of the country in 1172.  --Spencer

      At the risk of inanity, I feel that I just have to include two of today's quotes. The first comes to us by way of a conservative ad  urlLink campaign  targeting Howard Dean in Iowa. Purporting to be a pair of average Iowans, an elderly couple plaintively but resolutely informs the camera, I think Howard Dean should take his tax-hiking, government-expanding, latte-drinking, sushi-eating, Volvo-driving, New York Times-reading, body-piercing, Hollywood-loving, left-wing freak show back to Vermont - where it belongs. In many ways this is quite typical of the sort of rhetoric we've been seeing in the 2004 campaign. What I thought was so funny, though, was that I am an example of every attribute quoted here, with the exception of the body-piercing. Moreover, practically everyone that I know would agree that each of these attributes is, in fact, laudable rather than shameful. But enough of that.  The second, much more simply, from the  urlLink  Times  , [T]he linked journals also form a community, an intriguing, unchecked experiment in silent group therapy -- a hive mind in which everyone commiserates about how it feels to be an outsider, in perfect choral unison.  Of course, the danger of conforming to a fixed idea of nonconformity is a tired subject indeed. I doubt that I've ever had a conversation about the nature of popular culture without it being noted that those who rebel tend to do so in the exact same way, and are therefore creating an alternative culture as regimented as the one so firmly rejected. The argument is specious to some extent, in that one's values can be positioned firmly in opposition to a conservative  status quo  while one willingly embraces signifiers of an alternate cultural group, and one can do so while remaining an individual. Telling, nonetheless, that those who break out of one mold find themselves so easily poured into another. The grey felt fedora that I wear so proudly around Dublin is hardly the counter-cultural symbol that it might be.

      I begin with places, things and people to which I have been introduced recently.    urlLink Steve Bryant , a local techie and musician, who is looking for a keyboard player for his band, the  Trans Am Supernova  .   urlLink Democrats Abroad , an organization of expatriates (like me), living in Ireland (like me), who wish to become politically involved (like me) and are politically liberal (like me). Hmm. I think that I could get to like these people.    urlLink SAGE , an organization of SysAdmins in Ireland. I met Donal on the train this morning, and he would appear to be fairly involved. I wonder if Irish techies are as crazed as American ones?   We'll call that good for the moment.

      Since as of yet I am not known in the community, I will begin with a reasonably high level of self-descriptive text. Personal foibles, odd eccentricities, whatever I find interesting.  However,  this exercise in self-publishing will quickly range from the useless to the outright hedonistic if the overall tone does not rapidly improve.

      Voiceless, but shouting to the void .... they say that everyone is now a publisher, and that every voice can be heard. That may be so, but with untold exabytes of information pumped relentlessly by every imaginable engine, my voice has been silent. There's no excuse.

      From the reference site  urlLink Web Design References :  When working on a web site, we embark on the integration of language and science, art and technology, and concept and practice the moment we create a link...hypertext...on a web page. Instead of just reading the page, our site visitors are now motivated to make a decision whether to follow that link or not. Links move us away from a static media element that encourages passivity to one that encourages activity.  - Molly Holzschlag   This is really what the web is all about - we are expanding the universe of perception for our readers by increasing the cross-references between discreet units of information. Art and science comingle as information and creativity overlap, allowing us to apply our own filters of perception as we simultaneously create new ones.   I am convinced that the digital technology of information presentation has created a fundamentally different 'mode' in which people process and understand the world. At times when I've watched an information professional (such as a newspaper editor) make rapid-fire decisons, interacting with digital information quickly and efficiently, it seems that this is indeed some new attribute of our brains that we have trained into ourselves without even full knowledge of the result. This  is  the Information Revolution. And I want to be as close to it as I can.

      The  urlLink Human Rights Watch  has  urlLink reported  that: The United Nations cannot be expected to lend its legitimacy and expertise to the fundamentally flawed Iraqi Special Tribunal for Crimes Against Humanity.  They object to some of the bylaws of the new tribunal, noting specifically that the new tribunal would not outlaw the torturing of suspects and does not prohibit the death penalty, both of which are legal under existing Iraqi law. If our stated goal in Iraq is to create a democratic and western-inspired political system, what would be the consequences of allowing existing bad laws and structures to remain in effect? This item gives me further reason to disbelieve the leaders from both parties who claim primarily humanitarian justification for pre-emptive regime change.

      In the true blogging tradition, I must take a moment to mention a fascinating person and fellow-blogger whom I had the pleasure of meeting yesterday.  urlLink Molly  is a fellow expatriate in Dublin, though hailing from Portland rather than New York. Despite a very short aquaintance, I can thus far say the following: she makes me smile. Here's to Molly.

      Random note on living in Ireland: Despite an overwhelmingly chilly and damp climate, it is nonetheless more temperate (I think) than eastern seaboard cities such as  urlLink New York , which has a low today of -15C. Consider that there was low of 4C in  urlLink Dublin  today, and my co-workers still complained bitterly. So, for anyone planning to move to Ireland for the climate, go right ahead!

      Lately it seems that the 'blogosphere' is simply everywhere, and might even take precedence over the more one-sided web publishers. One company estimates 3 million active blogs, which is really quite staggering. Of course, the  urlLink programming  of these systems has gotten a lot easier - it takes literally only seconds to register and configure a new blog these days. Here are a few that I read with some regularity:     urlLink  BoingBoing   is written by Cory Doctorow, a very interesting science fiction writer and cultural commentator. Though geek-oriented, you will always find things here to surprise you.    urlLink  Lessig   is one of the smartest and most insightful lawyers and social theorists that I can think of. I was pleased to see him argue before the Supreme Court in  urlLink  Eldred  , and would recommend his  urlLink books.     urlLink  Zeldman   presents a very good look at web design techniques, and often has some very funny things to say, as well. He is also the publisher of an excellent web-design resource,  urlLink  A List Apart.      urlLink  Kausfiles   at  urlLink  Slate   contains the political ramblings of Mickey Kaus, a very conservative columnist. Though I wouldn't even pretend to believe more than about one word in ten, his links and rants give an excellent overview of what a reasonably thoughtful right-winger sounds like (besides  urlLink Safire , of course.)    urlLink  Dean   probably gets a special mention for "Most Influential Blog." I really don't think that politics will ever be quite the same. I've been convinced for a while that the cultural and intellectual elites of the US (not the economic elites) have checked out of the political process in disgust. If they ever decided to really put their minds to it, we could become again a version of what we started as -- a country run by a bunch of intellectuals. Wouldn't that be a nice change from  urlLink Bush ?   I'm sure that there are many other fine ones out there, but unless you count  urlLink Slashdot , I don't read them. The day is busy enough ... now, as soon as someone finds me a blog for Irish Music in Dublin, I'll be happy.

      In the movie  urlLink  Velvet Goldmine  , the glam-rock impressario Jerry Devine says something like the following: "Over the centuries, the art universally recognized as the most lasting, the most pure, was the product of the most self-conscious effort." Much contemporary art does seem to be rather self-conscious; the processed sounds of popular music, for example, are created with specific reference to the sounds of other popular hits. Much modern sculpture and painting explores the nature of the frame itself, deliberately blurring the line between viewer and viewed, making the space for the presentation of art a part of the work itself. Novelists are sometimes ultra-aware of themselves as writers and as narrators, such as in the very popular novel,  urlLink  A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius  . Does self-consciousness indeed result in great art, or is this art merely one by-product of an age already in love with self-examination?  Self-consciousness in art may or may not reflect the self-consciousness of the artist. One could even argue that the most 'flowing' creative state of the artist is not a product of self-examination so much as a complete immersion in the moment of creation with respect to audience communication. (I state this as an artist, and can not, of course, directly speak for the experiences of others.) If true, though, a case could be made that self-examination, though perhaps necessary to improve one's own work, is not the impetus or inspiration for the creative act. So what, then, would explain the near-universal self-conscious recognition of existing art in today's works?  To answer this question first requires a few tricky definitions. Firstly, I will consider only those art forms which are essentially performative, even if the actual performances are recorded and transmitted mechanically. Performative art exists in time, and therefore can interact with an audience, which I feel is important in understanding the nature of the artist-audience relationship. Secondly, there is an important distinction between awareness of existing work and the categorization of a piece as an example of a style. It is perhaps impossible to create a truly 'original' piece, though perhaps the better term would be 'nondependent' in the sense of not depending to any degree on the cultural tradition that encloses it or to the cultural biases of the artist. I wish to emphasize that I am not speaking of 'self-consciousness' in art with respect to that artistic work conforming to stylistic guidelines common to others in the genre.  With that out of the way, let me state my essential thesis: Art has become increasingly self-conscious as a result of two trends. First, that audiences have themselves developed richer artistic lives, and therefore are more attuned to art which breaks through the procenium arch. Secondly, art is now created in such a blindingly diverse and prolific quantity that it is the more self-conscious art which is noticed against a background of more traditional work.  I speak first to the claim that audiences themselves live more artistic lives and are therefore more attuned to self-conscious art. It seems hard to dispute that the lives of the everyday, in the West at least, have become richer artistically, though the art woven into everyday life may not have been created with the same dialectic purpose as in the past. Industrial design, for one, has improved greatly, and consumers buy products as much for aesthetic as for functional reasons. Reasonably-priced interior decorative materials have become widely available, off-the-rack clothes bear the imprimatures of famous designers, and even the PowerBook on which I now type has all the titanium sleekness of an art object. Art screams at us from every towering billboard, musicians play in the subways and sculpture adorns our building lobbies. This art, passively waiting as it is, would have had a former home in a museum rather than in such public spaces. Architecture, perhaps, has always blended aesthetic principles with utilitarian ones in such a manner, but it was not until the rise of mass communication and advertising that so many intentionally-designed aesthetic objects became a part of the cultural consciousness.  Perhaps as a result of the ubiquity of this 'functional' art, similar pieces presented on the stage or within the museum will fail to catch the eye, whereas the art that involves the audience will seem suddenly fascinating. This process of "drawing in" might be a function of breaking the barrier between subject and frame, thus bringing the art into the viewer's everyday experience in a novel way. Alternately, something could be required from the viewer or listener besides passive apprehension, such as when an author's voice breaks through a narrative and invites the viewer to consider the artist as a fellow member of humanity, rather than as an unseen channel for a creative energy.   The second part of the equation involves sheer volume and complexity. With billions of people on the planet and nearly instantaneous communication at last giving rise to a semblance of global culture, art can be created by almost anyone at any time. Musicians track and mix albums in their basements, graphic artists get by with a Mac and a light tablet, sculptors share studio space in Williamsburg with a large number of others. Art can be created part-time or full-time, for audiences or for oneself, performed or recorded, published or hoarded. A museum-goer chooses from more galleries than ever, rich collectors continue to proliferate and performance spaces open every day, from the miniscule to the gargantuan. In every advertising agency and in most restaurants lurk swarms of frustrated artists possessing intelligence, creativity and perseverence, just not yet that most elusive quality of luck.  Amidst such a maelstrom of creative endeavor, artists must shout ever louder, figuratively or even literally. It is well known that controversy creates sales, and neither Roger Maplethorpe nor the Brooklyn Museum of Art would have nearly as many fans today were it not for some impassioned ideological shouting. An audience remembers the self-conscious and the controversial because the frame of the work forces them to think of the artist as an individual, and not simply as another anonymous creator of billboards. The self-conscious is noticed when a record producer hears another assembly-line album coming out of the house studio and decides to feed the maw of the public appetite with a series of tracks identical in sonic content to last weeks's hit single.

      Incidentally, here are some very interesting collections worth reading:   Firstly, what proves to be a fascinating discussion over at  urlLink Slate  in which the "Liberal Hawks" discuss whether the United States was justified in going to war with Iraq.  urlLink Friedman  of the  urlLink  Times   makes the strongest argument so far, though (as always) his optimism is a bit beyond mine.   On the slightly obscure side,  urlLink  Novell   has published a list of their  urlLink letters  back and forth with  urlLink  SCO   quibbling over the intellectual rights to UNIX. As most of the tech community knows by now, there are some very interesting arguments to be made on both sides, but most disturbing to me is the idea that companies like SCO can make a good living simply by bullying other companies.   Thirdly, I didn't realize that there are actually quite a few very different versions of  urlLink The Ten Commandments . One group is very diet-specific, including many of the Hebrew kosher requirements. Another emphasizes the false idols, whereas the Catholic list appears to be roughly the list that everyone knows. Apparently Moses broke the first bunch of tablets in a rage and God was kind enough to remake them -- but couldn't remember what He had written on the first set. Gosh, those who consider the Bible to be literally true in the strictest and most legalistic sense would seem to have a lot of work to do, if basic doctrines like the Commandments are in dispute. While I'm generally not one to cackle over slight inaccuracies in scripture, it does seem odd that the gospels remain the literal guidance for millions.

      On the random coincidence side, I just saw two films supposedly set in England using locations that I recognize from Dublin. The excellent film  urlLink  In The Name Of The Father   uses the Kilmainham Gaol (less than a mile from my house) as a setting for the incarceration of the "Guilford Four." The Michael Caine comedy,  urlLink  Educating Rita   uses the campus of Trinity College (where my sister goes to school) to represent Oxford. Both very good films - perhaps later today I shall compare and contrast them.

      Originally intended as a comment, this thought grew longer than the permitted 1000 characters.  It appears here in its entirety.   Myshkin on Mars: A Response   You suggest that science requires impassivity, and that science & conservatism are at odds.  I would argue that doing good science and living a good life both require only passion.  Myshkin's passion is directed inward, toward family and friends, thus labeling him conservative.  A scientist's passion is directed at the larger world, ever searching for more clues about the mysteries around us.  The dichotomy in my view is not between conservativism and technological progress, but rather between selfishness and a view to the greater good of mankind.  The conservative family man can focus on friends and family because it is too painful to be burdened with the obligations that come with a greater understanding of the universe, or he can be thus oriented because he cares deeply and passionately for the people closest to him.  The scientist can choose to apply his findings to profit, or to helping leave the world a better place than he found it.  Perservation, justice, stwardship, creativity, technological progress: these are all passionate pursuits.  Squandering resources, turning a blind eye, passing blame, sacrificing anything to turn a profit: these are the products of selfishness.

      Someone said once that a man's stature is determined not by his friends, but by his enemies. I've thought a great deal about the nature of friends, and I think that there must be things that I still don't 'get.' I'm a reasonably intelligent person, but my life has not thus far lent itself to the development of closely-knit groups of 'mates,' as they say on this side of the pond. I have aquaintances galore. Colleagues, former co-workers, people with whom to chat online or off. Being the internet age, I measure my social contacts largely through my emails and instant messages, but nonetheless a small but lively web of discussion swirls around me. I visualize, right at this moment, little electrons scurrying hither and thither, a chat window open to a friend in Baltimore, an email open to a friend in Dublin, a browser window accepting these words, my mobile phone showing an incoming text message from my sister. A web of activity and communication, people who care that I'm alive (not something I've always experienced), but -- friends?   Friends:  The  urlLink dictionary  definitions range from  "A person whom one knows, likes, and trusts"  to  "A comrade."  And, most tellingly, a lover. The old word for  "friend"  contributed to the name of the German deity Frigga, the goddess of love. I can think of one former lover who I would now call a friend. But why is it so difficult to find other comrades? I thought at one time that it was simply a question of shared experience, and certainly for most aquaintances from school or work are lumped into the 'friends' category. But there is more to it than that - a giving and taking, a sharing that goes beyond the professional or scholastic.  Nor do I have enemies. I suppose that this is a good thing, but I doubt that I have made enough of an impression on anyone to be actively disliked. Nor do I have an enemies list of my own - those who harm me I generally forgive. But this disconnection is really the heart of the problem. The times are more interconnected than ever, but one is alone ....

       urlLink Salon.com Life  includes an interesting take on the properties of introverts vs. extroverts:   "The contents of the collective unconscious are represented in consciousness in the form of pronounced preferences and definite ways of looking at things. These subjective tendencies and views are generally regarded by the individual as being determined by the object -- incorrectly, since they have their source in the unconscious structure of the psyche and are merely released by the effect of the object. They are stronger than the object's influence, their psychic value is higher, so that they superimpose themselves on all impressions. Thus, just as it seems incomprehensible to the introvert that the object should always be the decisive factor, it remains an enigma to the extravert how a subjective standpoint can be superior to the objective situation. He inevitably comes to the conclusion that the introvert is either a conceited egoist or crack-brained bigot. Today he would be suspected of harbouring an unconscious power-complex. The introvert certainly lays himself open to these suspicions, for his positive, highly generalizing manner of expression, which appears to rule out every other opinion from the start, lends countenance to all the extravert's prejudices. Moreover, the inflexibility of his subjective judgment, setting itself above all objective data, is sufficient in itself to create the impression of marked egocentricity. Faced with this prejudice the introvert is usually at a loss for the right argument, for he is quite unaware of the unconscious but generally quite valid assumptions on which his subjective judgment and his subjective perceptions are based. In the fashion of the times he looks outside for an answer, instead of seeking it behind his own consciousness."   From Jung's  urlLink  General Description of the Types  .

      At the  urlLink Democrats Abroad  caucus over the weekend, I met some fascinating fellow activists and warriors in the good fight. One of them sent me an editorial concerning the role of corporate media organs which prompted a reply. If you are interested, please read the original  urlLink editorial from Black Commentator . Here is my reply:   I definitely have some issues with the article [linked] -- perhaps because of my involvement with news organizations in the past, I am generally distrustful of 'media conspiracy' as a reason for the current political corruption eating away at our country. Yes, it cannot be denied that many entertainment and broadcast companies have been consolidating, and several of them under the direction of acknowledged conservatives. I would argue, however, that the primary cause of the political volatility referenced in the article is not savage and cynical manipulation in the board-rooms of TimeWarner but rather the increasingly effective spin of trained political operatives, amplified by an Internet-fueled news cycle that has shortened precipitously.  My experience of good news professionals is that they tend to distrust their own corporate masters as much as they strive to question the motives of any other corporation. They may require a paycheck every month, but the self-imposed standards of shame within news organizations serve to roughly ensure that pandering and censorship will result in the ending rather than the advancement of a career. However, one factor that complicates the picture is the conflation of television broadcasters with news organizations. I would say that these groups are fundamentally distinct, in that television success is measured directly and minutely on the entertainment value, while news organizations pride themselves on professional reputation and honesty.  The entertainment culture of television tends to distort facts simply because of the bias toward the sensational (in the literal sense), but can also be easily manipulated by political hacks and others who wish to have a story spun one way or another. This is partly a function of news cycles: a large metropolitan daily paper operates on a news cycle of 24 hours; though there is opportunity for revision in the various editions, the essential stories as reported remain fixed for the day. Television, I believe, has much shorter timelines for story development and research. When you factor in the additional technical requirements of videotaping, editing, sound, effects, on-screen chyrons and so forth, the time available to a television reporter to get the gist of a story is measured in minutes. The shrewd political operative or corporate flack who has the press release ready to go will be at a huge advantage in this arena. Political teams will have sound- and video-bytes at the ready, a press release nicely formatted, interviewees lit and mic'ed, backgrounds selected and access passes cleared before the television reporter comes on the scene. The reporter arrives, is handed a story and breathes a sigh of relief that she will squeak through another impossible deadline for the evening news.  The minority opinion in this scenario, of course, will not be nearly as orchestrated.  This bias will then be amplified enormously throughout the lifespan of the story. News anchors faced with these tight deadlines would much rather replay an entertaining video clip than take the additional time to go find another set of sources. Also, the perceived problem of relevance causes television (on the air 24 hours a day) to effectively 'invent' timely hooks that will create the visceral excitement of a 'breaking story.'  With internet news and discussion sites providing a truly global and round-the-clock publishing of ideas, television networks probably feel that they must compete somehow by making their stories seem even more 'up to the minute.' The net result is a rapid recycling of the spun story under slightly different guises, perhaps with off-the-cuff commentary or expert opinion, perhaps just a restatement of the facts. The 600+ repetitions of Howard Dean's famous "scream" is a classic example of this.  Newspapers and magazines are not subject to many of these constraints, and (as a result) tend to do a much better job of reporting the news. There are several natural advantages: First, the longer news cycle results in a longer period of time for reporting, and thus a more balanced (or at least thorough) picture. Secondly, the decreased overhead in reporting allows more time for interviews, phone calls and reading, and less time for setting up tripods and developing catchy computer graphics. Thirdly, the comparatively large space available for a story allows more than the sound-bite slogan to make it into the final cut. Think about the number of words in an average newspaper story as compared to the number of words that can be read on-screen by an anchor in a period of a minute.  The real answer, I fear, is simply not as straightforward as the image of evil corporate special interests huddled in board-rooms and directing the coverage of national politics. It seems to me, rather, that the insatiable american appetite for televised entertainment has led to some profoundly unfair and distorted ways of telling stories.  Until those public tastes change (and as long as so-called "reality television" holds sway, this is unlikely) I regret that we are unlikely to be offered fair and balanced reporting.

      What motivates our moral choices? Is it reason? Emotion? Biological instinct? Social norms? Is the moral satisfaction of doing right enough to tempt us away from the material rewards of doing wrong?  Discuss.  (Full article  urlLink here )

      Salon reports on the troubling  urlLink infiltration and spying  on anti-war activists by the law enforcement community. As I saw quite a bit of this at last year's  urlLink Feb 15 protest , I'm perhaps more sensitive than many on this topic. It is disturbing, none the less, to see that one activist center opens meetings with  "We welcome all the law enforcement that is here. If you have any questions you can ask us now, and if you'd like to talk to us discreetly, we understand." This fits with what I saw at last year's demonstration. A  urlLink previous article  in Salon goes more into depth about the infiltration of a particular meeting.  I suppose this is a word of warning to activists: If the clean-cut 30-ish silent guy in the corner gives you a bad vibe, there may well be a reason.

      We have now entered the traditional Christian season of  urlLink Lent.  For most people, and even most Christians, this is hardly an occasion for more than a nagging feeling that one really ought to give up chocolate. I'll actually be curious to see whether the consumption of alcohol here in supposedly  urlLink Catholic Dublin  decreases over the next 40 days, though given the lack of religiosity of most young people (and Dublin is an extremely young city) I don't expect to see much change. But the idea of accruing some useful benefit through self-denial is a compelling one for me, and I'm interested in participating.  A few reasons for fasting spring to mind:   Disruption of usual life patterns leading to increased self-awareness  Feeling of solidarity with those who do not have our western overabundance available at all times  Increased chance for meditation, based on lack of distraction from the body  A pure exercise of willpower, increasing confidence  A closer understanding of the  urlLink prophets  and  urlLink leaders  whom I have come to respect and who practised fasting   Still. I have decided to undertake a limited fast during Lent for various reasons only peripherally religious. As the whole subject seems a bit arbitrary, I've decided to start with the  urlLink Ramadan  idea of fasting during the day, that is, between sunrise and sunset. After that time, anything will be permitted except for alcohol. I honestly don't understand the large distinction between eating mammals and eathing other animals that  urlLink Christians  tend to make -- but then, I don't eat many mammals as it is. For the first week, I will continue to drink juice or other beverages during the day, as I'm pretty sure my body isn't yet ready for a true Islamic denial of all food and drink, including water. I don't expect this to be a terribly arduous penance physically; I'm interested mostly in whether the disruption of my usual eating habits will lead to any greater reflection or discipline in other areas.

      Unfortunately, the following content is not original, but I found the topic so compelling that I wanted to share the content here.  The post originally appeared on  urlLink World Changing .  Italicized text indicates quoted text within the original article.   Original article from World Changing:  Timothy Prickett Morgan's Lean, Mean Green Machines is the best thing I've ever read about the energy crisis computerization is causing, and how we could use more efficient technologies, open source software, grid computing and virtualization to correct it. It's frankly slightly above my geek fluency level, which means I could be getting duped, but the parts I do understand seem solid, well-reasoned and backed by fact. Whattya'll think?   "In the simplest terms, a computer takes energy, in the form of electricity, uses it to store and manipulate information, and releases the vast majority of the energy as heat, noise, and light. The computers we love so dearly are burning far too much electricity and creating far too much heat. They are among the most inefficient devices ever invented, and the industry has had very little incentive to make them more efficient. The Information Age has not yet learned from the mistakes of the Industrial Age.   ...  "Based on data in the United States, Huber and Mills reckoned that it took a pound of coal to create, package, store, and move 2 MB of data. ...the world's PCs and servers together consume 2.5 trillion kilowatt-hours of energy (for themselves and for related environmentals) in a year, or $250 billion in hard, cold cash a year. Assuming that a server or PC is only used to do real work about 15 percent of the time, that means about $213 billion of that was absolutely wasted. If you were fair and added in the cost of coal mining, nuclear power plant maintenance and disposal of nuclear wastes, and pollution caused by electricity generation, these numbers would explode further."

         Do you make time, in private retirement, for meditation, prayer and thanksgiving, and do you take opportunities for reading and understanding the $HOLYBOOK and other writings which reveal the ways of $DEITY?  Is your way of life in keeping with the teaching of $PROPHET? Do you watch against conformity to commonly-accepted standards, and against the love of ease and self-indulgence whichhinders your spiritual growth and service?  Are you honest in your daily work and in all your personal relationships? Do you maintain integrity in your dealings with government authorities and other outward concerns? Do you guard against covetousness, remembering that the quality of life does not depend on the abundance of possessions? Do you seek to discern how much of your time, talents and resources you should devote to the service of others?  Do you cherish an understanding and forgiving spirit? Do you avoid unkind gossip and the spreading of rumour? Do you avoid damaging the reputation of others? Do you cultivate an appreciation of each individual's worth?  Do you live in that life and power which takes away the occasion of violent conflict, and with $DEITY's help work for reconciliation between individuals, groups and nations? Do you faithfully maintain our witness that all war, or preparation for it, is inconsistent with the spirit and teaching of $PROPHET?  -- From "Queries for Serious Consideration," Religious Society of Friends in Ireland  I've meant to post some of those questions for a while - how many of us can truly say that we consider them regularly? I've redacted the religious references slightly, to make it clear that I don't consider this a Christian-only thing.

       urlLink The Onion | America's Finest News Source™ :   "Bush Calls Incumbency Key Issue Of Campaign  WASHINGTON, DC—At a campaign dinner Monday, President Bush identified incumbency as the key issue in the upcoming presidential election. 'Look at my opponent's record on incumbency,' Bush said. 'John Kerry is not the president at this time. That's an indisputable matter of public record.' Bush added that the American public should seriously consider whether it wants to risk electing a president who has no experience heading a nation, has never resided in the White House, and does not have even one State Of The Union address under his belt."

       urlLink Salon.com Life | I'm sick of soul mates :  "I don't know that anyone really knows what a soul mate is. Aristophanes says one thing, Thomas Moore another. One person says a soul mate is a lover from a past life. Another thinks a soul mate is the perfect husband. Others think the soul mate is more like a perfect one-night stand with a cowboy. What I usually mean by 'soul mate' is someone with whom there is a feeling of understanding and passion that exceeds rational understanding. It might last, or it might not, but because it so exceeds understanding, it inspires thoughts of the supernatural or the divine. If you have never experienced a powerful yet bafflingly clear connection so seemingly telepathic that it defied your rational understanding, then the idea of a soul mate would, understandably, have little meaning. But many people have experienced such a thing, and find it helpful to have a word for it, and an explanation, however unprovable."

      Though I've attempted to avoid the personal drivel that's so prevalent among bloggers worldwide, there are a few new things which I might as well mention.   urlLink  This blog   looks a bit different. I believe that I may have to start the comment system over again -- sorry.  I have a  new  urlLink job  . Much as I support the work of my  urlLink last company,  the time has come to move on to different, if not better, things.  I have a  urlLink  new goal   for the next few months. As I did decently at the Dublin Fleadh Ceol (traditional music festival and competition), the next few months will be spent in preparing for adjudication at the  urlLink Leinster Fleadh , and hopefully for the All-Ireland.   I have a  new  urlLink pet   living in my house.  urlLink Spartacus   urlLink Maximus  the hamster. He's black and white, for what it's worth. No imperial ambitions that we've seen.  I'm working on a  new project  for the  urlLink Comhaltas Ceoliori Eireann  people: recording a 2-CD set of standard  urlLink session tunes  out of the  urlLink  Foinn Seisiún  books. We should be releasing the box set in August. That's it for the moment - I'll do my best to get back into the regular publishing thing.
