      Anil Ambani once commented that after Jamnagar Infocomm project is like next pill of Viagra for their project implementation team. Any guesses after Infocomm and Reliance Energy, what will be the next pill of Viagra????   Well my guess is MEGA KNOWLEDGE CITY. Whatever Reliance does is Mega and hence we need not stress here that this also will be mega. Just to give an idea, last township they build was Jamnagar...and the total size of Reliance Jamnagar is half that of Mumbai!!!! This knowledge city will be much bigger.   So what will be the knowledge city like?   It will be city where the Ambanis will invite the Stanfords, Whartons, Harvards, IIMs, IITs of the world to open their branches. This city will also house research centers for all major technology companies of the world. Hyderabad, Bangalore will be passé.... Major IT, Biotech. Pharma giants will queue up to have their research centre here. Apart from that the city will house lot of Infotech companies (Infosys, Wipro, TCS etc.) and BPOs. The city will also have all major schools and graduation colleges. And some time later many corporate houses will shift their headquarters to this city.   The next question is why all major companies will line up to establish their office in this city?   The answer is infrastructure and talented manpower. India has the advantage of large pool of talented manpower but suffer from lack of proper infrastructure. Reliance will be leveraging this talent pool and at the same time fill the infrastructure gap. The city will have the advantage of Reliance optic fiber for communication, uninterrupted power supply from Reliance energy. Apart from that the city will have state-of-art infrastructure in the form of Mass rapid transport system, great roads, International airport, rail and road connectivity etc.   And how do they plan to finance the project?   All state government will be fighting with each other for getting this city established in their own state. The government will offer land at a throw away price in hope of attracting huge investments and creating lot of jobs. They will also offer lot of tax sops etc. Reliance will create a master plan of the city and start offering land on lease to these institutions to open their branch. Reliance will not only offer to do the construction work but will also provide them with cheap finance. These institutions will be given liberty to design their building as per their requirements but it should fit the master plan. Participating companies, institutions will make their own investments while Reliance’s major investment would be in the city infrastructure, which would be run on commercial basis. As the city is being built from scratch the construction cost of city infrastructure would be relatively very less and part of the capital cost will be financed from lease deposits received from these institutions. You may also see builder like Sahara group building small townships within the city and selling out flats. The economics of the city is based on two basic principles:  1. Buying unoccupied land at wholesale (concession) rates and selling it at retail rates.  2. Investment in infrastructure and attracting of major international players at one place will increase the value of land many times over. (Cluster Advantage)    According to our calculations the investment required by Reliance group alone in the project would be more than 50000 crores i.e. higher than any other project undertaken by Reliance so far. Apart from that participating companies and institutions will be investments in their own infrastructure.   So, are you able to dream how the city would look like? Would you like to be a part of the dream? Would you like to live in this city? Don’t forget to post your opinion. Its on first come first serve basis. Those who post their opinion will get preference in bookings.

      It is generally believed that corporate races like quality, efficiency, growth etc. have no finishing line. But it is also true that it’s very difficult to motivate people to run in a race that will never come to an end. Reliance is running same race for growth. Their corporate ambition is obvious from their punch line “Growth is Life”. To motivate their employees run this unending race what they have done is they have decorated each milestone with a finishing tape. Apart from that they have strategically separated monotonous less crucial parts or the racetrack into separate race to be run by separate runners.   According to Hindu Mythology the job of creation, maintenance and destruction has been divided among three gods Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh respectively. In the similar fashion Reliance had separated the job of creation and maintenance. Job of creation is given prime importance at Reliance and had been traditionally headed by Dhirubhai Ambani and now is being headed by Mukesh Ambani. Maintenance job is given a step motherly treatment at Reliance and is generally headed by professional managers while member of the Ambani family get involved in only exceptional cases. This separation of task help them to saturate resources for achieving the critical goals at the same time managing to stretch the resources.   As stated earlier Reliance group prime focus is on creation job. Creating new projects bigger than any previous project handled by them is what drives them. The strategic intent is to build grassroot Greenfield projects that are of global standards. And this challenge of creating something globally benchmarked is what drives the team emotional and intellectual energy for the journey.   For the creation business they are ready to commit most of their resources that make the resource not only ‘fit’ with the emerging opportunities but also at times ‘saturate’ it. On the other hand they stretch the resources to the maximum possible in the maintenance business. They have created a team of their best people into a project implementation team who run the growth race with the imported shoes and equipment. For this team organization’s best resources are committed. For them each project is like a milestone which is celebrated when reached and a new race to the next milestone starts immediately afterwards. It is best brought out by Anil Ambani’s words when he was explaining the critics why they took up Infocomm project after the Jamnagar project. His explanation was “ After Jamnagar Infocomm is like Viagra for our project implementation team.”   To explain how it operates we take an example. Initially when Dhirubhai Ambani turned bullish on Polyester, polyester market in India was almost non-existent. Apart from setting global scale polyester capacity he needed to create demand for his products. He committed all his resources. He went to the wholesalers and retailers with most lucrative offer. He offered them 90 day credit period for selling polyester and at the same time offered to bear all losses in case wholesalers has to face one but let them keep all profit. As a result traders started promoting polyester and soon polyester gained the confidence of the market. Once the market creation job was over he soaked away all his resources and diverted it to other creation business. Now Reliance was offering his goods only against cash upfront but as the market has been created there were enough takers. The control was now in the hand of maintenance guys.   Another way to look at their saturate-soak-stretch strategy is to look at their debt equity ratio. Reliance group due to its founder philosophy has been a conservative player when it comes to debt-equity ratio. When the group is in process of creation of a global scale project the group debt ratio stretches to the maximum tolerable level because they stretch its financial powers to saturate the project. But as soon the project is over the resources are soaked away and again debt- equity level is brought down to the acceptable level.   They operate on the general military philosophy that no matter how strong you are you never open too many fronts for war. And when at war your best people are out there fighting the war while home affairs can be looked into by lesser mortals. Building global project always suffer from natural stretch like lack or experience and expert manpower, lack of technical skills, uncertain environmental factors etc. which are more or less beyond the control of most players. They make it up by saturating resources, creating redundancies to keep a tab on uncertainty. The best people who may have done a better job in the maintenance business are called to fight the war i.e. to work on creating the global scale projects. While people who are left, are made to look into the home affairs i.e. do the maintenance job or look after the regular running of established business.   This is how Reliance manages to achieve what appears to be impossible given the resources on hand. It’s the resourcefulness of the management, ability and technique of allocation/deployment of resources that help them stretch their resources into achieving the group’s growth intent.   It is well known that Growth as an objective cannot be a motivator in itself as employees can’t see the finishing line. Growth has to be defined into milestones that are challenging enough and can channelize the emotional and intellectual energy of the employees to achieve the organization goals. Hence projects like cracker at Hazira, integrated grassroot refinery at Jamnagar, state of art optic fiber infrastructure for Infocomm, deep sea Oil exploration or biggest gas based power plant act as goals which motivate the whole team to stretch beyond what is considered realistic to achieve the impossible. For the team it becomes the ultimate goal, till they achieve it, while for the organization its just another milestone, which motivate it to dream even bigger.   On the other hand the maintenance team has to run the monotonous race. Neither milestones are as clearly defined nor they are celebrated in the similar fashion. Apart from that, the work is also not that challenging. What motivate the employees more than the financial or productivity target here is individual target of graduating to the celebrated team of creators. This is the reason while performance of Reliance creation team (project implementation team) is way above industry standard the performance of the maintenance team is just around average.    Although Reliance practices resource leverage both in creation business and maintenance business it is more evident and more rewarding in the creation business. In maintenance business method of resource leverage is more or less similar to what other business houses practices. They hire experienced people at the least cost possible, expedite the cash flow cycle, try to operate the plant and machinery at more than the capacity, recycle the skill and expertise gained by an employee in one job for another. They pay the employees less and make them work longer hours. This is complimented by advanced plant created by the project implementation team to produce above average operational results.   For Reliance the real leverage benefit come from the creation business or from project implementation job. Aspects of their resource leverage in project implementation is discussed as follows:   The first step to resource leverage involves targeting, focusing, and converging. Separation of the project implementation team is the result of consensus building on strategic goal. Achievement of Convergence is not difficult at Reliance as such decisions are taken at the top by the Ambanis. At the project creation stage itself they create capacities more than the market can absorb. Hence subsequent investment in the current business is not a high value addition investment and they know that. Hence they Target new business that can give them super or more than normal growth. While their project implementation team is working on ‘the’ project, management is strategically conducting a pilot study in other business opportunity by investing a small sum. Till the current project is not completed the Focus stays on that project and as soon the project is completed the focus sifts to the next project.   The learning at Reliance is high because turnover in Reliance project implementation team is very low and the same team or project implementers work on all new projects using learning of previous project in the new project. At the same time, as they create the project and shift to the next project (don’t do the maintenance job), unlearning is not a problem. Reliance had been able to implement project in high technology area like Telecom with a team with experience only in petro-chemical area because of this reason. Unlike the common belief the team developed expertise not in petrochemicals but in project implementation that was leveraged for other project implementation in completely different fields. For this they borrowed the best technology available from the Bechtels and Duponts of the world. They rather then taking them as partners purchased these technologies from them adopted the technology to Indian condition and innovated using these technologies to get better results. It was the competence of their project implementation team to learn the expertise of these international giants fast and internalize it. This helped them lower the costs in the long run at the same time it help the organization accumulate expertise in project implementation. This was also made possible as top management had faith in their team and had the confidence to give them liberty to innovate. They recycled the project implementation expertise developed by the team for creation of many mega projects leveraging on the skills learnt on the last job. Reliance paid the members of the project implementation team better than industry standards, which helped them in protecting the project implementation (skill as a resource) from their competitor. Apart from this ability to come up with new challenging projects on a regular interval also helped the company in retaining its talented manpower. This is in contrast with the treatment the members of the maintenance team get.  In their whole strategy of resource leverage the most important chain is the strategy of expediting things even at the cost of other resource. When it comes to project implementation they consider time to be the most important factor and don’t believe in optimization of other resources at the cost of time. In fact at times they are ready to accept certain amount of ‘slack’ in order to make sure the project is expedited. By expediting they are not only able to run resources like cash flow few extra mile they are also able to leverage their most critical resource – the project implementation team by making them working on more projects. The focus on time and targeting of completing the project in the shortest possible time also provide other advantages like first mover advantage, product to market time saving etc.   The above-described ability of Reliance to stretch and leverage its resources is the reason why Reliance had managed to become the biggest private sector company in a short period of 27 years.

       &nbsp;  This article describes how Reliance will be leveraging the 60000 Kms of Ducts it had laid for Infocomm venture for Power distribution. This master strategy will help Reliance save thousands of crores apart from saving lot of time.    When was the last time Reliance group invested substantially in a sector, which is not related to its core business? What made Reliance invest 25000 crores in a sector which is totally different from its existing business? It’s surprising considering group’s reputation for backward and forward integration. Or is it that we are missing out on the relation?   FLASHBACK: Mumbai, 13th June 2000, Reliance 26th Annual General Meeting: Mr. Ambani lays down before the shareholders group’s plan to invest 25000 crores in Infocom sector and also in the group vision statement mentions the plan to become numero uno in Power sector. To achieve this he mentions the group plans to reach 10000MW of power generation, but admitted that power distribution would be the thrust area.   BACK TO PRESENT: In the meanwhile Reliance group had managed to acquire controlling stake in BSES Ltd through the open offer and creeping acquisition route. It has invested in power plants at Hirma in Orrisa, Patalganga in Maharastra, Jamnagar and Ghogha in Gujrat, Jakamkondam in Tamil Nadu and Goa. The group is also eying the Dhabol power plant in Maharashtra.   BSES is a great investment considering the group’s power ambition. It is putting up power projects in Andhra Pradesh and Kerala. It also has exclusive right for electricity distribution in north Mumbai and has also taken over three distribution companies in Orrisa. Not to forget two new distribution company in joint venture with Delhi government for distributing electricity in two-third of Delhi.   But have we seen the group thinking smaller than the length and width of the country ever. BSES is too small considering RIL ambition. It has to be something Pan-India. Secondly, Ambanis take pride in its complex project building capabilities and prefers to "build" rather than "buy". From what we have seen of the Ambanis buying existing capacities/businesses can be part of its strategy but nothing more than that.   Power is the next destination for any Petrochemical, Oil and Gas giant like the Reliance group. But nothing substantial is happening on ground in electricity distribution even when Mr. Anil Ambani had admitted it is the thrust area. Is something happening below the ground?   RIL is building 60000 kms network of optic fibre for its infocom venture. For it, it is laying 12 ducts of different colors and sizes through the length and breadth of the nation at the speed of Reliance. (Ducts are hollow PVC pipes, which you can see being dug into the ground by groups like Reliance. Optic fibre is new generation telecommunication wires which are capable of carrying much more data than the traditional copper wire and is pumped into these ducts later by the suction mechanism)   But why is it laying 12 ducts when others are like MTNL, BSNL, Bharti etc are laying only 2 or 3 ducts?  Reliance group says that it will pump in optic fibre in only half of those as of now and will be keeping the rest for future demand. Does it make sense when experts are already talking about glut of bandwidth? Secondly in such a high technology changing area where people are already coming up with wireless technologies does it make sense to lay ducts keeping in mind the demand 10 years down the line?   Now think of a possibility: -  Reliance group is laying half of these ducts for its infocom initiative and the rest for electricity distribution. In half of these ducts optic fibre would be 'blasted in' by suction mechanism and the other half would be used for electricity distribution by putting electricity distribution cables in the ducts.   Now the question arises is it technically possible? Let us take up the major stumbling blocks:   1. Magnetic Field: High tension electricity distribution cables develop magnetic field around the area from where the cable passes and disturb the transmission of information etc through traditional telephone (read copper) cables. But optic fibre cables works on the technology in which light travels through cables carrying information or data. Secondly, walls of PVC ducts, which take care of magnetic field problem, separate electric cables and optic fiber cables.  2. Insulation: Insulation should not be a big issue. Scientists have developed many insulating materials like rubber, fibre etc which can be quoted around the electricity cables to take care of insulation. In fact PVC ducts itself should take care of insulation.  3. Inserting these electricity cables in the ducts: Optic fibre cables can be inserted in these ducts by the suction mechanism but how do we insert the electricity cables? I am sure technicians can provide us with better way but if nothing else work we can always use what I call "pajama" technology- When we have to insert string in a pajama we first insert a clip which can be easily inserted (in our case optic fibre) and then pull the cloth string (in our case the electricity cables) by tying it to the clip. Same can be done for the electricity cables too.   I believe the major problem is not technical but political. Getting permission for inserting electricity cables in ducts that were originally permitted only for laying optic fibre cables will be hard to come by. All politicians, state electricity board employees, human right organizations will be on road screaming the potential dangers of high-tension wires. Politicians would like the companies to again purchase "right of way" by bribing them. State electricity board and its employees would like to enjoy their monopoly for some more time. And the human rights organizations will get an issue to scream about and watch themselves on television.  Next important question will be; what forced Reliance to keep it a secret rather than boasting it in front of the shareholders? It can be any of the following:   1. Reliance knew it would be difficult getting “right of way’ if it discloses it intention to use it for electricity distribution. It would need lot of clearances from many government departments. Which will eat up valuable time.  2. It is waiting for the government to announce private participation in electricity distribution before which, such plan is of no value.  3. It want to catch it competitors like TATA POWER on the wrong foot and take an early lead.  4. And above all Ambanis don’t want BSES share prices to shoot through the roof as they are planning to increase the stake to 51%   Okay I admit Mr. Mukesh Ambani had not whispered anything like that in my ears. Its possible that they are not planning anything like that. But the question is if it’s technologically possible and Reliance has similar ambitions WHY NOT? Remember after Reliance Declared its Infocomm plans &amp; started laying the ducts BELL LABS OF USA came up with an innovation which makes it possible to carry 20 times data through the same optic fiber cable, by just changing the input and output point. Which means Reliance has bandwidth 20 times then it really wanted.   Imagine what if it comes true. We would experience in the power sector what we are currently experiencing in the telecom sector:  Prices will fall, Monopoly and blackmailing of the state monopolies will be over, quality of services will improve, uninterrupted power supply and no destruction of electricity appliances due to voltage fluctuations. In one word Competition.   If it comes true India will be able to bridge a gap of atleast 10 years in its infrastructure development. The indirect effect of it will have on the efficiency and working of industries etc cannot be imagined. But all this will be possible only when the State governments end the monopolies of the SEBs which will require a strong political will.

      In India it pays to deal in cash (or cheque) rather than going in for trade credit facility. If you have a habit of making your purchases on credit you are not only paying bank interest, risk premium and margins for these banks (which are relatively very high in India) but you are also incurring additional tax burden!!!   Taxes like excise duty, sales tax etc. are determined on the basis of selling price of the goods. If you are making regular purchase on cash the supplier would be willing deduct these costs from the price of the goods. Although costs like interest cost is normal and there is opportunity cost for the fund you use, costs like extra tax liability etc. are additional and can be saved. Added to that paying in cash upfront wins you tremendous negotiation power and market credibility which help you attract the best suppliers.   Same is true when you are selling goods; try selling for cash you will be able to give a better deal to your customers in comparison to one who offers credit facility. This is the strategy being followed by Reliance group and that’s why they not only get best offer for the purchases but are also able to give one of the best offers to the customers.

      No its not about Stephen Hawkins or any other science fiction book. It’s about management. It is generally seen that for any purchase decision in business the three important aspects people look into is cost, quality and reliability. With cost getting the highest attention. The major aspect people generally forget to consider is TIME. You must have seen people wasting lot of effort and time to gather information about things which donot deserve the time spent. The best example in this case is government organizations where rules insist on tender and atleast three quotations. The amount of time they waste to confer to this silly rule (which have become necessary due to rampant corruption) that they become uncompetitive in comparison to private players. One single reason of Reliance faring better in all public corporation dominated sector is their focus on time. And this is sustainable competitive advantage as considering the Indian mindset and the rampant corruption they can’t do away with this rule.

       &nbsp; I had invested in 250 shares of L& T of Rs. 10 each. Due to recent decision of de-merger they have sent me in replacement 100 shares of UltraTech CemCo Limited of Rs. 10 each and 125 shares of Larsen &amp; Toubro Limited of Rs. 2 each.  Before de-merger face value of my investment was Rs. 2500 (250*10) now the face value has reduced to Rs. 1250 (100*10 + 125*2). As far as I know, a company cannot reduce its paid up capital until unless it need to write off its losses. And L &amp; T is a very profitable company that does not have any loss on its balance sheet to write off.  What accounting entry they are making for the above. Are they converting paid up capital into capital reserve? Can anybody tell me whether it’s legally correct?  Even if its legally correct does it make sense to de-merge the company when it leads to 50% reduction in capital? What assets they are writing off that has lead to 50% erosion of capital. Is it in the interest of the shareholders or is it something to do with professional management trying to retain control? 20% shares are being transferred to employees fund...at whose cost??

       My commitment is to the consumer, to growth and to do justice; I simply follow these three goals in that order.   - Mr. Pradip Baijal  BusinessWorld 10 November 2003.    We agree with Mr. Baijal that Indias telecom policy should have these three goals and in that order. But we would like to bring to notice few government policies and regulations that are working against the goal of consumer interest and growth. We request the government to look into it and if found fit make required changes.   1.Call carrying charges:   Call carrying charges are charges charged by a telecom player from another telecom player for carrying calls from one place to another. According to which suppose a company like Bharti, which has operation both in Delhi and Punjab, to carry a call of an Airtel customer residing in Delhi to Punjab will have to pay national long distance operator (BSNL) call carrying charges just to cross the state border(note that Delhi and Punjab share the same border). It leads to increase in complications and hence cost. The only rationale in doing so is to give unjustified advantage to the government owned telecom company - BSNL.  If government does away with call carrying and call terminating charges, at the same time making it necessary for each player to provide interconnectivity, bill and keep system of settlement of accounts among the telecom players will automatically follow. This will save a lot of cost and effort for the telecom players in billing, settlement of accounts among themselves etc. It will also provide a lot of flexibility to telecom players to design tariff structure as per the needs of its clients. It will help the small players to survive who will cater to the niche market with customized services.   Deficit User charges (DUC)   This is yet another innovation from the stable of the Indian telecom regulatory authorities. Its motive is to increase telecom density in rural areas  a social cause. For this the government has introduced an additional 80 paisa per minute charge on STD calls to be paid by telecom players to BSNL. This is to compensate BSNL for losses it has to suffer in setting up phone lines in rural areas.  In fact, with the latest optic fibre infrastructure in place, the cost of carrying a call whether local or STD is the same. It doesnt matter whether the call is from your house to a house on the other side of the road or to a place 3000 km away from your house until unless its in India2. This artificial differentiation of Local & STD is therefore not required. If DUC charges are done away with telecom players will be in a position to provide one charge for the whole country, something that many mobile players had started before the introduction of this new DUC charges of 80 paisa. I need not mention the major gainer will be the customer.  Another benefit of doing away of DUC charges which will in effect lead to all India one charge will be that telecom players would be able to provide one number for whole country. Words like roaming, SDCA, STD would become obsolete.   Technologically with optic fibre infrastructure in place there is no barrier to Growth (spectrum utilization rate in India is too low in comparison to other countries; hence its not a limitation.) 3. A parallel can be drawn between cable television industry and telecom industry. As in cable television industry once the cable is in place it does not matter how many hour the customers actually watches the television, similarly in the telecom industry it should not matter the number of hours a customer actually talks over phone. We pay around Rs. 200p.m for cable television and receive/consume much more bandwidth than we consume while talking over phone. Once these artificial barriers are removed we can expect telecom players to provide unlimited talk time to anywhere in India at a price as low as Rs. 200p.m. Like in cable television where pay channel like Discovery Television charge premium for niche content, extra charges will be there for value added services like internet on telephone etc. We have witnessed how not only cable television industry grew exponentially but also many related industry like private channels, non-film music industry, etc. took off. Same can be expected if these artificial barriers are removed and telecom industry start following the billing system similar to the cable television industry. Industries like movie on demand, two-way television, net on cable, Internet on mobile etc. will come up. Hence these artificial barriers are not only barriers to growth of telecom industry but to the growth of many other new age industries.   Suggestion: The first reaction to the above by a typical babu in government will be -then from where will government get its revenue to meets its social obligations, blah, blah? The best way government can do so without harming the customer interest and growth much is by charging all kind of taxes, fees, charges etc. as a percentage of revenue4. For example if a telecom player is charging say Rs. X for unlimited talk time anywhere in India Government can charge:   10% of the revenue as sales tax.  10% as license fees  10% as Deficit user charges  20% as other charges   Total 50% of the revenue will be collected by the government as various taxes, fees, charges which is quite close to the share government currently has in the revenue of telecom players. If a telecom player requires minimum say Rs. 2005 per month it will bill the customers Rs. 400 p.m. This way government will be able to collect Rs. 200 per customer.    The benefit of the above will be    1. There would be lower entry cost in the industry that would increase competition and help small players survive  2. Lot of billing, regulatory cost and effort would be saved  3. Government will automatically get share in revenue arising out of industries that are yet to develop without coming out with new legislations  4. Government revenues will grow with the telecom industry  5. Regular disputes arising out of policy implications would be avoided  6. Telecom players will be able to take long-term decisions without fearing change in policies  7. Assured revenue for the government and the telecom players  8. Customers are better informed and served    Explanatory Notes:   1. Initially few players might not have agreed to bill and keep system as this system make entry of new player easier. But now with increased competition in telecom entry barriers are no longer relevant.  2. In fact it does not make much difference even if the called place is located outside the country. The costs are the same just like in the case of internet where it does not matter whether you are sending email to your friend in the same town or to a friend in U.S.A. But again in international calls artificial barriers like regulatory laws of that county, carrier charges etc. come into play.  3. Spectrum utilization rate in China is twice than that in India. Considering the growth estimates available spectrum scarcity is nowhere in the horizon. Secondly new technologies are coming up which are increasing spectrum utilization every day.  4. There would be fixed fee for spectrum as its availability is limited and if its availability is made free there wont be efficient utilization.  5. Continuing with the previous conjecture that revenue of Rs. 200 per customer will be satisfactory for the telecom players. They will try to increase this by providing value added services.    Bibliography:   1.Spectrum: Its the control over airwaves that are required to provide wireless services.  2. All India one charge: Charging similar charge for local and STD calls. Not discriminating between a local call and an STD call.  3. Bill and Keep method: Under this method the telecom player whose client is originating/making the call bills his client. If the call is terminated on network of another telecom player he does not charge anything to the first telecom player as termination charges. In return when the call originates on the network of second telecom player the first telecom player do not charges call termination charges.  4. Call termination charge: Charge paid by one telecom player to another for connecting to a telephone in its network.

      This is an open letter to 35 lakh Indians who have entrusted Ambanies with their hard earned money and who trust them more then anybody. Those with whom Dhirubhai Ambani had been sharing prosperity for 25 years and those who trust him like God.   If you are a loyal shareholder of Reliance and a fan of Dhirubhai Ambani (which most shareholders are) we advise you to take all medical precautions before reading this article. As all your loyalty and trust may be challenged. You may feel cheated. All the while you thought Reliance cheats only with the government, competitors etc but never with its own shareholders - it’s true no more. Till early nineties they needed you because they regularly needed funds for their new projects. Not any more. Now Reliance internal cash generation is enough for investing in its new projects and now they don’t want to share the profits with you. They want to corner all the profits themselves leaving you with leftovers. Don’t believe me? Just read on.   If you are a shareholder of Reliance you must have received Reliance Petroleum Limited annual report for the year 2000 - 2001. Did you ever spared some time to go through it or you trust them blindly? Open page no. 38. At the top you find SCHEDULE 'O' (cont.). Item 22. Contingent liabilities - part d) - SALES TAX DEFERRAL LIABILITY ASIGNED.For 2000 - 2001 it’s Rs. 1370.46 crores. Ever cared to find out what it is? 1370 crores is not a small amount to ignore isn’t it?   Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) defines Contingent Liability as liability that does not exist at present but depends on future happening. In plain words this is not a liability but in future if something bad happens (which normally is not expected), this may become a liability. Now lets go into its background. Gujrat government as an incentive to invest in the state had given Reliance group facility to pay all sales tax liability for the first 14 years of operation at the end of 14 years (. i.e. deferred payment). In the meanwhile each year liability is treated as interest free loan from the government to the company.   In other words, it is a liability that is not dependent on any future occurrence. Now the question arises then why it is mentioned as contingent liability. I asked the same question to secretive Reliance group and to my surprise they replied (copy of the reply attached). As per the reply   "... The sales tax liability has since been discharged by Reliance Petroleum Limited by assigning the same in favour of a third party after making the payment of due consideration calculated based on the net present value of the future liability. The said liability is required to be discharged by the assignee on the due dates of the payment of deferred sales tax amount.  As clarified above, since Reliance Petroleum Limited has already discharged its liability, it is no more a liability of the company; however, it is contingently liable and therefore we have included the same as part of contingent liabilities in the notes of accounts..."    In the right of shareholder of the company I had been requesting the group to disclose the identity of the third party and the present value factor for almost two years now, without any success. The only reply I got is "its a company internal matter" and that also not in writing.   What I apprehend is - Reliance group had assigned this amount to one of its group companies (my guess is RCL - Reliance Capital Limited) in which the Ambanies hold almost 100% share at very low net present value factor. Now you would like to know how does it affect you?    Reliance Ltd.’s internal rate of return is approximately 22%. Now as people other than Ambanies hold almost 45% of the shares, the Ambanies have to share it with them. Now if they instead of investing this thousand of crores lying with RIL directly in project like Infocomm, transfer this sum at lower rate say 10% to a wholly owned company and then invest it, they can rob the shareholders of 12% return annually (22% - 10%) and put it in their personal pockets. It means you are getting less than 50% of what you really deserve.   And if you think that you are better off taking safe return of 10% rather than risking your money to project like INFOCOMM do not be fooled (this is where contingent liability comes in). Because in case the Infocomm project fails the privately held company of Ambanies will default in paying Gujrat govt. 14 years hence. And as the primary liability is on RIL they will have to pay it. It’s like taking the risk of an equity shareholder and getting return of a debenture holder.   Ever wondered why Reliance industries Ltd. is investing only 45% in Reliance infocomm. They state that another 45% is being invested by Ambanies from their personal account and through privately held companies. Infocomm project is said to cost Rs. 25000 crores. 45% of which comes out to be 11,250 crores. Okay we admit that Ambanies are one of the richest but that is because they own RIL. Do you expect Rs.11, 250 crores of hard cash is lying in Ambanies personal accounts?   Now you must be thinking exact sum by which you have been cheated. Well as we don’t have the exact detail of the present value factor, sales tax liability for the next 14 years and the company to which it has been assigned we can’t give you an exact amount. But I will try to make a conservative estimate based on the above figures.   In 2001-2002 the sales tax liability assigned had been 1370 crores. As it was only the first year of operation after which oil prices have raised and Reliance is contemplating an output hike we can realistically estimate this sum to go up to Rs. 2000. Crores, but for conservative sake I stick to 1370 crores.   Now internal rate of return of Reliance group had been estimated by Business Today magazine as 22% I will stick to it. And in absence of information about net present value rate at which it had been assigned we take it as 10% (don’t be surprised if in reality its not even 8%).   Calculating it for 14 years (n)    1370 [n(n+1) / 2 ] x 12% = Rs.17262 crores.    It means you have been robbed of Rs. 17,262 crores over a period of 14 years on a conservative basis. On real basis I assure you it would be much more than the total cost of Infocomm project. i.e. Rs 25000.   Now lets check out with the Auditor Mr. D. Chaturvedi partner of CHATURVEDI &amp; SHAH. His report says (point 8 page 23) “ The company has granted secured loans to companies, firms or other parties listed in the register maintained under Section 301 of the companies Act, 1956 or to the companies under the same management within he meaning of sub-section (IB) of Section 370 of the companies Act, 1956. In our opinion the rate of interest and other terms and conditions of such loan are not prima facie prejudicial to the intrest of the company.”   The above is the only part that may be relevant, here also they have not mentioned the rate. The report is the usual auditors report with no reference to the above matter. I wrote to them also for information about present value rate and third party without success.   So what do we do now? Reliance group will not disclose anything until unless they are forced to. (When they don’t even care to inform their Reliance India Mobile subscribers at what rate they are exactly charging, what do you expect). And it’s very difficult to force something out of this group. I am sure they will pull strings somewhere and this story will never see daylight. Solution?? Its for you to decide, anyway its your money.   Disclaimer: All the above calculations and apprehensions are based on the limited information available with us. Facts and refusal of Reliance group to part with information about third party identity and present value rate forced us to reach at this conclusion. If Reliance group has a better explanation to it nobody will be more happier then we the loyal shareholders of the company and die-hard fan of Dhirubhai Ambani.

        Start billing customers fixed sum per month with no per minute billing .  With the new TRAI recommendation on ADC this is now possible. Other telecom players may not be willing to shift to "Bill and Keep system" but once Reliance is out with this scheme - sooner or later they will have to.  Start charging Rs. 1000 per month (or higher if Reliance network is not prepared to handle sudden surge in number of connections) and bring it down to around Rs. 500 once "bill and keep system"&nbsp;is accepted and network is prepared. Offer one time amnestry scheme to defaulters by giving them oppurtunity to shift to this scheme. At the same time offer customers option of shifting to better scheme if offered in future.  This will help Reliance avoid BILLING which has become a major headache. It will also help in eliminating bad debts, and reduce customer complaints substantially.

      Reliance is manning all it retail outlets like web world, Gas stations, etc. with its own staff. These employees will either be on the rolls of Reliance industries/ Reliance Infocomm/ Reliance Energy itself or smaller little known group companies.  I believe Reliance is stretching its strategy of SELF - RELIANCE too far. First it would be a major Human Resource excersise and secondly it may look like a Public Sector Enterprise.&nbsp;Soon time will come when&nbsp;excess labour force (or unproductive labour force) would become a heavy baggage for the Reliance growth machine.  It would also lead to diluation of brand value of Reliance as a recruiter. Similar problem is being faced by IBMs and Morgan Stanleys of the world who are recruiting people for call centers under the flagship company Brand name in India.  Its time Reliance starts the unlearning process. SELF-RELIANCE has worked for them in past and is one of the major reason for their success. But retail business is a different ball game. Its time to learn the virtues of OUT-SOURCING

      TRAI has decided to charge Deficit Access Charges as percentage of total bill rather than 80 paise per minute of STD call as in the past. This will have a&nbsp;far&nbsp;reaching effect  1. Fixed rental (per month basis) and no pulse rate for calls within India  2. All India one number  3. Free roaming anywhere in India  4. Bill and Keep method of settlement among telcos  &nbsp;  All the above is not far off. Consumers are in for treat and telecom density in India is about to shoot up.
