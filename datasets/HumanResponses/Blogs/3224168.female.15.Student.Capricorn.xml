      Ever since the day  Laura  came on my course...I knew there was something that I didn't like about her. She just walked in that room thinking she was so cool, like she was above everyone else. She thinks getting drunk is the only worth while thing to do on earth. I take it she's never experienced much in life...and she hates me for some reason.  The thing about Laura is she's violated just about every rule in the "rules" book. Yet she still is on this course. She turns up at course stoned...does the teacher not notice? It's very obvious to me, I can smell marijuana from a mile away. One thing I really hate about Laura is how she picks on this one particular girl in my class. This girl has done nothing to her! Also...Laura's always slutting up to the guys. She does the stupidest(is that even a word?) things, like pretends to hump Gary (a dude in my class) from behind. She already has a boyfriend but of course she doesn't care. Oh and...Laura is the worst distraction ever! I have ADD(Attention Deficit Disorder) and believe me, Laura does not help it at all, she's worse than my 10 year old brother.  You know what? I hope Laura gets kicked out of course (if you're under the influence of drugs, that's instant dismissal), and I hope my  friend  (supposedly) Tara gets kicked out too. Tara's just not a nice person anymore, now that she's been hanging out with Laura. She's been leaving me out majorly! I really want to get back into contact with my friends, I haven't talked to them in ages! I used to talk to Rose and Raph all the time...but now I've just lost contact. It really sucks. They're WAY better people than Laura and Tara.

      I found a good description for Laura "obnoxiously loud".   We were trying to watch a video last week that we rented for course. Through the whole movie she TALKED really loud, started stupid conversations with people and kept walking around the room. She can't sit still for one hour, even someone with ADHD is more behaved during a movie. I can barely concentrate in class with her around. Sometimes she randomly gets up and dances to stupid songs on the radio, she flirts with boys during class time (although she already has a boyfriend), passes notes with her "friend" (well she was my friend...but now she ditched me for Laura) and says really nasty things about my new friends.  She is so horrible. She makes everyone feel like crap about themselves. I really hope she gets  kicked out of course. I heard she has 2 warnings already (once you get three you get kicked out for good). Actually, I hope alot of people in my class get kicked out. Yesterday only four people in class weren't stoned (including me), oh and the teacher wasn't stoned. The other five, were all stoned (not a very big class).  I wish my teacher would notice already! These stupid stoners are nothing but a distraction and they aren't following the rules! Marijuana is ILLEGAL and it's against the course laws. If you come to course under the influence of drugs/alcohol, you get instant dissmissal.  So why haven't these juvenile obnoxious posers been extradited!!??
