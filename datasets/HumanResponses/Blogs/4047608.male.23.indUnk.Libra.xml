      After this_letter By o.b. roxas  It’s been quit a while, Since we last see each other 3 months or more? Have your face change? Have your opinion change? Do I still look the same? Its funny cause I don’t remember, Its funny cause I missed you! I haven’t felt this way since the last first week you left for Australia could it be my fault? You even think so?! I don’t think so…. You don’t even send me letters You don’t even greet me hello on the phone  Maybe I shouldn’t tell you I love you Cause you know this I love you’s always ends with goodbyes This I love you’s always end with heartache and pains And these things I always ask why  But no one answers…. Except with this frustrations inside… Kiss the rain goodbye, Cause you’ll always cry.. Will I still remember you? After this letter Will I feel the same again if I tell you not to lie? Would it be our fault if we say no more? Cause Im so sober to this love And I can’t stop myself if I stop loving.. Cause its too much cold reality inside my heart, And there’s no more respect left for myself Cause I want it this time I wont cry…. This time… If I tell you goodbye.

      Depression while waiting for the record by: o.b. roxas9:28pm 20/04/04 krusada office with em  I always had wonderful days with you guys, But I guest, things changes in seconds, I haven’t felt like this before with my other peers, And its crazy!  I always thought that I found a new diamonds in my life, New friends that will be with me in pains and joy, But I think Im wrong… And now I felt so tired, I’m tired of happily ever after ending stories, I’m tired of make believe heroes, I’m tired of wanting somebody who does'nt want me, And its sucks!  I thought I'm staying with people, who want me, But it feels like Im thrown into pieces, And now Im back with daydreaming and wondering, What could it be if I just stay at home with my family? What could it be if I spend more time with my former peers? Will I be happier? I guest this question will linger long into my mind, And I will never know the answers, Cause time never waited anyone, Those times I've lost I will never regret all of these things But I will never forget what things have said and done, Time can heal.. But I guest not too soon..

      I need to talk with you again, Why did you go away? All our time together still feels like yesterday I never thought I'd see A single day without you, The things we take for granted, We can sometimes lose And if I promise not to feel this pain, Will I see you again? Will I see you again? 'Cause time will pass me by, Maybe I'll never learn to smile, But I know I'll make it through, If you wait for me... And all the tears I cry, No matter how I try, They'll never bring you home to me Won't you wait for me in heaven? Do you remember how it was? When we never seemed to care, The days went by so quickly, 'Cause I thought you'd always be there... And it's hard to let you go, Though I know that I must try, I feel like I've been cheated, 'Cause we never said goodbye... And if I promise not to feel this pain, Will I see you again? Will I see you again? 'Cause time will pass me by, Maybe I'll never learn to smile, But I know I'll make it through, If you wait for me... And all the tears I cry, No matter how I try, They'll never bring you home to me Won't you wait for me in heaven?  'Cause I miss you so, and I need to know... Will you wait for me?  'Cause time will pass me by, Maybe I'll never learn to smile, But I know I'll make it through, If you wait for me... And all the tears I cry, No matter how I try, They'll never bring you home to me Won't you wait for me in heaven? And time will pass me by, Maybe I'll never learn to smile, But I know I'll make it through If you wait for me...
