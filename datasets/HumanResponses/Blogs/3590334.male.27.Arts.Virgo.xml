      I can’t really explain this well enough to pass along appropriate understanding. But I will try.  My girlfriend’s cousin, Alex, spent Friday night with us. He’s fifteen, from Boston, big into Japanese Animae, science fiction series novels,  urlLink the macabre , and painting little figurines. It just so happened that the Games Workshop, an organization that promotes a table top fantasy game of strategy, war, and little painted figurines, had its annual convention in Rosemont. So we went.  My camera battery was charged, but it failed to capture any great pictures of this event. Or maybe I was just too overwhelmed to do so myself. This huge convention hall was filled with mostly men in jean shorts and dark colored t-shirts. Alex headed right for the table where he could buy a very specific set of figurines – the only reason he bought the $30.00 tickets. We walked around some more until I heard this muffled voice followed by a lot of people yelling.  There was this man, 30ish, standing on a tank (made out of wood and cardboard) with a  urlLink megaphone . Surrounding him was a group of convention attendees and several costumed men with large rifles (also made of wood and cardboard). They were stationed at tables with several little painted figurines and a set of dice. On the middle of the table was a large-scale castle wall, surrounding three sides of the tank. On the other side of the tables were more convention attendees with their little painted figurines and dice. So this was a live action game between one set of little painted figurines, inside the castle and protected by this huge tank and a man with a megaphone, and another set of little painted figurines, played out by all these men and boys. The megaphone man would count to three and the people inside the castle would scream for a good thirty seconds. Then he would challenge the people outside the castle to yell. The loudest group won that battle advance and moved their little painted figurines appropriately. This continued until Alex was bored and wanted to leave. “These people are dorks and have no lives!” he proclaimed.  I beg to differ. I was one of these dorks. I used to role-play Dungeons &amp; Dragons in  urlLink Junior High and High School . I had never gone to a convention, much less met anyone outside my small group of friends who also role-played. This, to me, was my first convention, fifteen years too late. Had I known there were thousands of like minds – minds hungry for strategy, luck, fantasy and little painted figurines – I might have lived another life. I might have moved into my mother’s basement, commandeered the pool table and created my own little war in one-twelfth scale.

       So we finally bought a new mattress last night. After months of going back and forth my girlfriend and I became adults and bought our first mattress together. Firm, but comfortable, stylish, but practical.   We visited the same store a month ago when Miss Charlene was buying a new mattress. We didn't like the salesman then, and we still don't. He was that  urlLink slimy used car sales man pressure  type.   We actually left the store, went home, parked the car, then called the salesman back and went back to the store. By the time we got there he was vacuuming the store (which was covered with  urlLink gnats  anyway). After a few poor taste jokes and 'See, I told you you'd be back' comments, we were set. It gets here on Saturday morning.   The timing could not be any better. Saturday is looking to be the busiest day known to man. We might have just added queen sized stress to our day, but at least a good night's sleep lies at the end.

          I had a great ride into work. I managed to ride mostly in another biker's draft until a bit of congestion at  urlLink North Avenue Beach .     Then came to problem.  urlLink A white delivery truck.      Sure I am aggressive in the streets - but the guy had several tons on me. I went to his driver side to go around him when he decided to changes lanes. His front bumper hit my rear wheel. I checked my back tire and it all seemed fine.     When I got out of work, I found my rear wheel flat. Could be that the ride out to the suburbs last weekend wore down the tire and I needed to put air in it before riding to work. Could be the delivery guy came back to finish the job.  &nbsp;

        My girlfriend bought me an amazing coffee maker for my birthday last year.   You put the beans on top, pour in the water, tell it what time you want the coffee made, and push a button. It also knows when to turn off the heat plate so as not to burn your house down. Everything you need in&nbsp; a busy life. The next Sunday, the  urlLink New York Times &nbsp;listed it as the hip new coffee maker.   I keep a copy of that article in my wallet.  But, here I am a year later, and I go through so many steps just to keep it clean. The parts that have to be cleaned don't fit back quite right and grounds and coffee oil gets stuck everywhere.  urlLink Can you soak a coffee maker in the sink?    I end up skipping the coffee more often than not and waiting to get to work to get a cup. A nice flavorless cup of industrial strength coffee.

      I made a choice this morning.   I choose not to ride my bike to work (the usual). While gathering my things to leave for the train, I grabbed the recent issue of  urlLink Chicago Magazine  (The Best Of issue) instead of  urlLink Budget Living .   That set my day off to be a series of reminders of how I am not where I want to be. The phone was ringing before I could set down my bag at the Cube. Another request to do something for someone who simply won't do it for themselves. This was followed by a host of emails demanding the same. My job description states that my job is a reactionary one. I wait until I am told what to do, then I go do it. I decided that today begins my new job of finding a place where I feel more active. For the betterment of myself and those around me, I should be choosing myself over others.

      Dateline - Sebastian Joe's  Just a quick note. In MPLS with Sarah at Emily & Dave's Wedding. Last night was the Bachelorette party that Sarah designed. Jacob was the anti-stripper - he came in with little and added more clothes until he could hardly walk... best time ever.  We are now heading to the hotel for the rehersal, but I am gonna swim and explore St. Paul.   It is going to be a great weekend - it has been wonderful so far. I love this town and I hope Sarah gets into UofM so we can live here. But then again it is August and nice. Ask me again in January.  Cheers!

      My good friend Katherine Muns is leaving.  She is heading to law school out east and while this would normally be a celebration of good things, I am quite saddened. I've only known her for a little over a year, but I feel very close to her. It is going to be hard to see her go, but that will make the visits all the better.  A few notes: she made me walk home from my job on several occasions. I work in downtown Chicago and she lives a few steps from Wrigley Field. I live a good two miles north of her. So this isn't a simple walk. She's a slave driver. To her credit - she did ride her bike to work with me. And that was to a bike riding rally at Daley Plaza - where she had Krispe Kreme Donuts.  I've been to more sporting events in Chicago with her than anyone else. That's not saying much as we go just to go and are not that into sports, but then again, she yells a lot.  Midnight ate the Cantaloupe.  I ruined her only copy of  Love in the Time of Cholera  which is her favorite book. And I never even finished the damn book. I confess, it dragged on too long for my taste, but that didn't give me the right to spill coffee on the book.  I scared her so much once that she sobbed for 20 minutes.  We spent the 4th of July in 2003 on a kayak on Lake Michigan. It was beautiful.  I wish her and Tim and Ben the best.

      My reason for driving back to Nebraska was to witness my good friend Stacia's wedding. About a year ago, two friends of mine got married and I did not go because I have this strange dislike of weddings. I regret not going, but I did get to see them this last weekend, and I feel good to have seen them as a married couple. My dislike of weddings comes from a long stint as a mobile disc jockey. Every weekend for four years I would pack up my truck with lights, speakers, bubble machines and a tuxedo and head out to small towns in Nebraska. Most likely the receptions and dances were held in some public building, like the V.F.W. or a barn. I used to really like that life - being the M.C. for the fun part of weddings - the celebration. But after I started to witness some strange traditions, I began to dread the gigs. Basicly all wedding tradition symbolizes two persons become joined and starting a new. Add beer and a small town where everyone knows all the dirt and you have such cherished traditions as bride snatching. I am sure that taking the bride away from  her groom just after being married and before the consummation is rooted in some sort of 'sensible' tradition. But the way it was manifested in the weddings I attended was thus: the groomsmen get together after dinner and before the first dance and take the bride away and get her drunk. Now in a small rural community, the next place for alcohol might be the next town over since a) everyone from town was at the wedding, or b) the wedding was at the only place that served alcohol in town. Not to be outdone, the bridesmaids would take the groom away and do the same. But they would go to another town, bar, country road. Eventually the whole wedding party comes back, absolutely useless, and the DJ has to get them all to dance for grandma and grandpa. In a few instances, this time between the dinner and actual dancing was several hours. And in that time no one would dance because the bride and groom had not had their first dance. But I digress. This wedding was not even close. Everyone was respectful, happy, and genuinely celebrating the union. It was so nice to be at a wedding with people I loved. I could not have wished for a better time. And next weekend I am off to Minnesota to another one...

      We left town on Friday afternoon to head west. I had driven this path once before, but in reverse, nearly three years ago. That is when I moved to Chicago from Lincoln, Nebraska in an attempt to create a life I was never going to live without drastic change. The short of it: I lived all of my life in Nebraska and Kansas. Moved around a lot as a child, had a lot of family within a short drive. Ever since visiting several cities in the United States and Europe, both as a child and an adult, I felt compelled to leave Nebraska and create my own life. A chance came up in 2001 (or at least a chance bit me on the ass and I was not afraid to take it). I moved without a plan or money or job or anything. Just ideas and some stuff in the back of a U-Haul.  Three years later and I feel as if I have created a lot of what I wanted, but have a lot yet to do. So there I was, driving back to witness a great friend's wedding, bringing my girlfriend, and hopefully accomplishing something in the way of feeling good about my big move. For the last three years I have visited several times. Each time I felt like I was noticing negative reasons that supported my move. If you have ever been in downtown Lincoln during a Husker home game, and have no fondness for football, you know what I mean. Or visiting with relatives and feeling not quite comfortable. At least some of that was from telling myself to feel awkward, but there was still some indefinable aspect that I hoped (and still do) to understand. But overall, those reasons seem petty. There are plenty of people who live in Nebraska who think like me, feel like me, and still live there and are happy. I feel that there must be some larger reason - purpose? - to my leaving. As we got closer I became more nervous. Night had fallen by the time we made it to Nebraska and I felt as if I was sneaking into the city - undetected. On the way to my parents' home, I pointed a lot and told a few stories about this house or a person I knew from that house. It all seemed very new and changed. Subtle changes. A new building looked as if it had been there for a long time, but I could not remember it being there three years ago. Names of places had changed. The people looked familiar, but strange. As the weekend went on, I still felt out of sorts. My time with my family was fine, great actually, but the environment was just odd. I got back and started to notice that while I do feel wonderfully comfortable in and around my Chicago surroundings, I also know that there are the exact criticisms I have of Nebraska in Chicago. But I can't help but wonder what exactly is different.

      Germans have topped the list of strange news makers for reasons like the following:  MADRID (Reuters) - A German prisoner in Madrid and his girlfriend glued their hands together during a jail visit in an attempt to fight the man's possible extradition to Germany, judicial sources said on Thursday.  The pair were taken to hospital, where doctors were considering whether to operate or use a powerful solvent to separate the man's left hand from the woman's right.  The glue is a type normally used in car repairs.  Spanish police arrested the 39-year-old man in the southern city of Cadiz in April on request from Germany, where he faces accusations of smuggling women from Eastern Europe to force them into prostitution, the judicial sources said.  The Madrid court studying the extradition request will not make a decision for several months, they added. The man has a separate judicial case pending in Spain and authorities want it resolved before any handover to Germany.    I am eternally proud of the Germans for their innovative method of avoiding fate.

      I am all for people being creative in expressing themselves. But with that freedom comes the responsibility of criticism. Take Wesley Bono as an example. The following is from the Associated Press, written by James Jefferson - Dateline Conway, Arkansas.  A cattle farmer who spread manure along city streets to protest a gay pride march called the misdemeanor charge against him a bunch of you know what. Wesley Bono, 35, of Greenbrier pleaded innocent in Conway District Court on Monday after admitting outside court that he dumped 3 tons of manure in front of a gay couple's home June 27 and spread it along two city streets that were part of the gay rights parade route.  You gotta give Bono credit for using an appropriate  urlLink medium  for his expression. He felt the parade was a bunch of shit, so....but his follow up is just pathetic.  Bono said he was exercising his right of free speech when he spread the manure. "I live on a farm. Everything I do has to do with production -- male and female," Bono said. " urlLink By all the laws of nature , is it right? The animals don't make these mistakes. "This is just a bunch of crap. I didn't hurt anybody. I didn't hurt any of their property," he said. Bono said he was upset the parade was even planned and felt offended even more so by plans to start it while Sunday church services were going on. "I don't care what they do in their own homes. Just don't put it out on the streets where the little kids can see it," Bono said. "I'm not a bigot. Just keep it to yourselves. Just don't push it off on us."  It was a bunch of crap, sir. But you did hurt property. And you put it out on the streets where the little kids could see it. You didn't keep it to yourself and you pushed your beliefs onto the city and its citizens. You are a bigot, a hypocrite, and have a bit of a  urlLink feces fetish .

      So they grounded a plane on Sunday because a Japanese business man wrote the words  urlLink 'bomb'  and  urlLink 'suicide'  on a sheet of paper. He wrote them down because an article he was reading contained those words and he wanted to look them up later.  Paranoia is the condition by which people connect unrelated events.  urlLink SH  used to tell me in college that paranoia was the center of Liberal Arts Education and that marijuana intensified the learning process.   I think the present calls for an updated definition. I now think that when the  urlLink uneducated  try to connect events, we get irrational paranoia, but when educated (being people who have learned the value of research and  urlLink where to find reliable facts ) connect seemingly unrelated events we get a little closer to the truth.

      I have now seen the play known as 500 Clown Macbeth a total of seven times. Which is more than I have seen my favorite movie  urlLink Croupier . Basically in 500 Clown Macbeth, three clowns fail at everything they try. Through an amazing series of stunts, tricks, pyrotechnics, humor, improvisation and gymnastics the clowns manage to embody every human emotion. In fact, the only thing they do not fail at is to make the audience engaged.   Point: Shank seeks  urlLink admonishment  from an audience member after shooting his fellow clown, Bruce. He managed to get it from an elder man of eighty plus years in a beautiful white suit with grey pin stripes. The man even had the broad brimmed hat to match.  "Stupid Shank!" yelled the old man. I was just taken with the comfort of that moment.  Later, the third clown Kevin, played with some fake blood the three have stumbled upon. The first two clowns acted as if they shot each other and spat out the blood. The audience cheers. Kevin, a female clown, splashed blood under her dress and acts out  urlLink menstruation . The audience boos. Kevin then questioned the audience's enjoyment in gun violence, but disgust in a natural life cycle. The audience cheered her point.  It is just such a great play. I went with Miss Charlene and we had Thai afterwards at a place that had over a thousand Pez© dispensers on the bathroom walls. Kudos to Cozy's.  I guess the moral today, if there is to be one, is about using the absurd to point out the obvious. Why are we such creatures of ignorance that we fail to laugh at our own absurdity?  urlLink Much is to be learned from clowns who learn everything from us .
