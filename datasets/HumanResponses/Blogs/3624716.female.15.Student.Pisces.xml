                   ok, so here's the deal. i am really tired and sick alot lately and that's unusual b/c i don't get sick alot... but that's not the point w/this post.. ha. the point/subject, whatever is people are stupid. period, end of sentence. (ha.) -but thats not the case either, the case is that you are stupid.- my cousin michelle, so true so true. haha. anyway, my friend tiffani, ya you, thinks that if i don't answer her when she calls the first time that she has to call 5 more times and leave 5 messages and they all say, are you mad at me? why aren't you answering me? i guess you're mad at me.. call me later or i'll call you. and then she does, at least 2 more times. ok, i may be exaggerating a little bit but seriously, come on! i was on the internet last night and i signed on and i was helping my dad get a light bulb and when i came back she/you imed me and when i did answer she said," hey, are you there? are you mad at me? well i guess you are. bye" i was like.... what?! but it's not just her, everyone is just stupid. people are fighting and they don't even know why. and i'm just easily annoyed lately. but mainly just by a few people. like you... ha. jk, well for some of you.... ;) well, yea.. that's it. (this is going to be something i'll do in all of my blogs)     *~*bellybutton*~* if you want to know i'll tell you the story later but you won't think it's that funny. :/ -doublepants-

      Okay so this is Elisa's blog but since she is way dumb she hasen't written in it yet so I thought I would! I think Ill give all you other dumb people some rules of advice!

1. Never call Jessica JESS or JESSIE, big NO NO!!!
2. Never smoke anything with out a crowd of people!
3. Never let one of your friends tell the another one of your friends how they feel.........Jessica   *cough cough*
4. Get a life and stop asking people about making out with other people cause we don't care!!!!
5. Never let Eli get high.......ALONE!!!! she might hurt herself.
6. Tiff...(aka me) needs to get high!!!! WOO!!!
7. When you don't have anything to say ..... SHUT UP!!! stop making mindless comments that mean absolutely nothing  ....lol!
8. Always tell people how you feel do not bottle it up inside...and I repeat don't bottle it up inside!...(courtesey of Eli herself!)
9. Always say fuck you when you're having a good day! ;-)
10. Don't put people in the middle of your problems!

okay I have nothing left to say and I'm going to take my own advice and shut up! -Lucky- ;-)

      ok, so i thought i was starting to get over...let's call him jack... i've known him for about a year or so now and i've liked him for a while though he's never liked me "like that". so i got my heart crushed and i tried to talk myself out this whole situation but it didn't work b/c i fell so hard for him.. anyway, i finally started to get over him, or so i thought. and now all the feelings just became.. stronger, which i didn't think was possible. now every time i see him i just long to be with him and tell him how i feel without it being weird and though i know he doesn't feel the same it always seems that there's something inside him that wants the same thing i do. i know it sounds crazy and everyone's thinking i'm to young to be feeling this or whatnot but this is true. and when i'm near him i almost just come out and ask, why don't you like me? what is it that's holding you back? i mean i see all the other people you like i don't see why you like them and not me...  but i never do b/c i'm afraid to hear him say once more that he just doesn't feel the same, even though i know he doesn't it hurts worse to hear him say it. i was trying to think of finding someone else but now there's no hope of it until i can start to get over him again...  which now i think will never happen. i don't know why i thought it would happen that fast anyway. i mean i love everything about him.. all that he says and does, even when he sleeps i can just sit there and watch him.. he's so peaceful.. not to be creepy or anything, (ha) and he makes me laugh all the time. everytime i look in his eyes i go crazy, if he'd just give me the chance i could show him how great we would be together. don't get me wrong, i'm not going to not be with anyone else just b/c i want this more than anything, but i know at some point i have to get over him. but, i guess i realize now that this dream can never come true b/c if something would happen i would lose him as a friend and i don't think i could bear that. so since i have to choose between friend or boyfriend i would always choose friend b/c it means so much more. if only this was a perfect world where we could have both.. love always, -doublepants-
