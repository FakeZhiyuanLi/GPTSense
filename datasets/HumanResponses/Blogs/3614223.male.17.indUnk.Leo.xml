      MIRROR, MIRROR  My post this time would be about: 1)	…what happened to me today 2)	…what I forgot to put during the weekend                                             ¤¤¤  I went straight to Colayco to check out the orgs along with Anne and Synd. I first signed up for AMA… yung Blue Rep kasi, pinag-isipan ko pa. Mahgod, may P100 reg fee pa ha. Grabehan na ‘to sa expenses. Haha “hidden costs” ng ADMU, ika nga ng dearest mom ko. Then Physics na kagad. As usual, boring na naman. Late pa si Anjie, as in mga 10-15 minutes ata. Discussion lang so mejo mas umingay pa kami this time around. Finally, break na.  Caf Up ulit with Q. Natuwa naman ako sa Q1 kasi nandun sila sa dating spot ng Q. hehe It means they are starting to bond. Kaso, confused pa rin ako sa aking status right now. I said I’ll give myself 2 months to adjust… Nice blocks. I’m so fortunate and grateful for both of them. During lunch, kinumusta ko lang ang mga Math ng Q. Mejo expected ko na walang basic no, pero yung iba nadown ng konti sa scores. Okay lang yan guys. I’m a pessimist I know pero for the sake of consolation, “okay lang yan.” Tom afternoon pa ang judgement namin sa Math. So prolong my agony muna.  Sa English, nabobo na naman ako as usual. We had this objective quiz, and if I just didn’t forget to study during lunch, I would have remembered the 2 items I forgot sa quiz. Minus 2 tuloy ako. Pero okay lang. At least pasa. Pero nakakadown lang, knowing me. Sa Lit, mas lalo akong nawindang. 2-essay-question quiz na 20 points each. For the whole period. Yung first essay okay lang. Yung second, super nabobo ako. Di kasi ako nakaresearch about it so basically I had nothing substantial to write about it. Haynako. Bagsak na yan for sure. Out of 40 points ba naman, suerte na ang 30 sakin. Goodluck. Naddown na naman ako dahil sa mga ganyan. Bobo talaga ako in the midst of smart people…  Before going home, I signed up for AJMA along with Candice. Kasama ko rin sina Jerms and Mamera. So right now, I’m (kind of) choosing between AJMA and AMA. Then, Blue Rep or TA sana. Basta one performing arts org. Bahala na. I’m so confused and down. So I can’t think straight. Tom, I’ll just “follow my ha-heart. My intu-weehee-tion.”                                           ¤¤¤  I really have to write this. Hindi ako yung tipo ng tao who writes out of rage or anger. Mild pako sa lagay na ‘to. Pero I just have to be honest with myself and with the people around me. So here I go, I’ll start off with a couple of scenarios.   Okay lang sa’kin kung tawagin mo akong tanga, kasi alam kong hindi naman iyon totoo. Okay lang sa’kin kung tawagin mo akong pangit, kasi hindi naman talaga kagandahan ang hitsura ko. Okay lang sa’kin kung tawagin mo akong bakla, kasi mahal naman ako ng tao sa kung sino ako. Pero once you give me the “finger,” goodluck, kasi super bastos mo.   I have taken a lot of “punches” since grade school. Since immature pa ang mga tao, normal na sa’kin yung tuksuin akong “bakla” because of the way I act. Okay lang yun. Hell, I’m proud of it. There have been times naman na nasabihan na akong “tanga” because of both minor and major mistakes. Pero okay lang rin yun, kasi I know I’m not stupid naman eh. And okay lang if some people don’t see me aesthetically pleasing to the eye, kasi wala naman sa mukha/hitsura ng tao ang katauhan niya.  Pero once sabihan mo ako ng “fuck you” or you show to my face the “finger,” sobrang bastos mo na talaga. As in, gaya ng lagi kong sinasabi, to the highest level na ang kabastusan mo. I mean, sa’kin lang. I’m just speaking what I feel. Sige. I can understand pa kung hindi ka talaga maka-letgo sa pang-aasar mo at pang-aalaska sa iba, kasi I have to admit, mahirit din naman ako to a certain extent. Yun yung keyword eh, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. Pero sa isang clean at good fun na usapan, kapag feel mo na talaga, all of a sudden you’d give me the finger. And my goodness, you’ve done that to me several times in the short period we know each other. FC. Gusto pa naman kita as a friend. I mean, natutuwa ako sayo kasi mabait ka naman at nakakatuwa ka rin naman talaga. Pero puwede mabura lahat yun sa kabastusang nakikita ko sayo right now eh. And don’t tell me na “joke lang naman.” You’re mature enough to know na puwede mo insultuhin ang isang tao kahit “joke lang naman.” And I don’t have to tell you na nakakabastos ka na because if you are sensitive to other people’s feelings, you’ll know. Well I guess right now you don’t.  Hindi ako hypocrite. I just know I never give the finger to other people. Ang mga hirit ko, yung alam kong makakayang tanggapin nung hiniritan ko. I just never give the finger to other people.  And don’t think this is an isolated case. No wonder, may history na pala ang attitude mo with other people. So I’m glad I’m not alone. If ever kasi sabihin mong OA ako or sensitive or feeling…  Don’t get me wrong. I still want to be friends with you kasi nga alam kong you don’t mean it at mabait ka talaga. Pero sa kaibuturan ng isip ko, respeto naman. Even if you don’t mean it at joke lang para sayo, konting respeto lang. We are educated people. And I think when it comes down to it, we have our brains to express ourselves rather than a finger. Let’s both not stoop down to that level.  Yun lang. I just want to let it all out. ‘Cos there is no other way I could have done so, I believe.  P.S. NINA, I didn’t see you ulit today. Nakakasad. Pero okay lang. I love you pa rin girl. hahaha                                              ¤¤¤

       THE ALARM WOKE ME UP  around 9am pero sa sobrang sarap ng beauty sleep ko mga 10a nako bumangon. Haha ayun watched TV muna, went online for a while, ate lunch, and watched TV again. Dapat mga 1p ako sa school para sa group study thing pero tinamad na rin ako sa mga 2p nako umalis sa bahay and arrived mga 3p sa school.   I WENT DIRECTLY  to the SEC benches. Lo and behold, andun na ang mga people, nag-aaral. Well gusto ko na rin sana makiaral pero masama mag-aral hours before exams so I decided not to. Nakipagchikahan nalang ako kay NINA, my favorite girl. I saw other Atenistas din sa hallway so chika rito chika jan. (Ay, btw, nakakainis na talaga si Public Syndrome, Anne. Super yabang.. Irita.. sige siya. Baka mawalan siya ng friends..) Ayun. So malapit na mag4p so naghiwalay na kami ng mga people. Got to go sa room namin, CTC 105. On my way, nakita ko si Claude, my dear blockmate. Halos di na niya ako napansin sa kakaaral. Pero I’m proud of her kasi she’s super studious! Go CLAUDE! Andun din sina Mr. Allen Mangilit and Mr. Fidel Mercado. Haynako, Allen. Okay. Guy ka nga, pero I must say isa kang malandi na guy. Haha… daig mo pa ko sa mga introductory ways mo. Handshake ka jan. Aysus. Segway.   THE TEST WAS FAIRLY  easy but tricky nonetheless. Aircon ang room! YAHOO! Mas comfy naman infairness. 20 multiple choice items na 4 pts each and 2 problem solving na 10 pts each. I left the room nung 35 minutes left. Nagreview pa kasi ako ng mga sagot. But still, nadale ata ko sa first number. I mean, of all numbers, first number pa eh marami nakakuha nun. Owell, we’ll see on Tuesday kung what really happened. Sana naman sure pass na yan. Yun naman ang ultimate goal eh, although graded yung exam if ever. Hay. Najinx ata ako nung prof. Haha jokes.   WE ATE DINNER  at Chicken Bacolod after. Yummy ng food ha. Pati yung Choc-Nut Ice Cream, new discovery ko. Haha worth the price naman. After nun sa sobrang pagod, uwi na kagad. Haay what a day.  ¤ I’ve always admired the optimistic people. The kind who at all odds still have this positive outlook. However, the less usual side has always been working for me since HS days. I am a bonafide pessimist. Tulad kanina, after the exam, windang na windang ako. Nasa lowest lows talaga ko ‘cos of possible mistakes I already have. Pero okay lang din. Can’t get over easily lang pero itulog ko lang ‘to, okay na. Ayun. How ironic 'no?  Pessimism can be at its best pala.  Well, for me and for the select few who think the same. Basta. I tend to look at the dim side of things and that’s where I get my best attitude. Odd but true. ¤

       Was it all worth it?    MY DAY TODAY STARTED LATE.  I arrived in ADMU around 10:30am. Naabutan ko ang Q people who were about to ride a van on their way to Terrell’s house. 130 pa kasi next class nila. I’ll be honest. For a moment there, siyempre na-sad naman ako kasi not everyone, including myself, could go since Anne, Kim, Allan, France, Gio, and I had 1130-1230 classes. Siyempre drama for a while, pero okay lang rin. Ayun. So buhbye kagad sa kanila and hello library naman. Anne told me kasi Kim and Allan (!) were studying Math daw there. ~ HAYNAKO. I searched all three floors, wala sila. Buti nalang I found sina KimChua, Brian, and Patrick sa 1st floor. Since walang magawa, I wrote on four birthday cards for my Q1 blockmates… hehe dabest ka Kim… how nice a gesture to get those cards… joke lang about the hierarchy thing. Then dumating na si Anne finally. Si JM (I-BIO) din finally nakumusta ko na. Jerms was there too with Karina and friend. ATLAST, Kim and Allan replied na. Nasa caf up pala sila. But then time na, so kami ni Jerms, hinatid muna si Anne sa SEC A for Math tapos Faura na kami for Phi6.  ~ I’m sorry, nakagawa na kami ni Anne ng second single ng Akameras. The famous HAYNAKO expression ay kanta na rin. Meron pang “to the highest level” move involved. Wait for it to be released.   ENJOY ANG PHYSICS.  We had a quiz and thank God naperfect ko naman. Mejo challenging buti nalang open notes since hindi naman on memory, computation lang talaga. So tarayan-acting na naman kami ni Jerms since hindi kami masyado nakikinig (pero nagnonotes pa rin haha). After that, lunch time na. Btw, si Jan, naka-HS uniform. Nagtaka ako pero naamazed. Even Jerms said, hindi mukhang uniform. Oha taray! Then Jerms and I suddenly craved for a bibimbap.   TARA NA, KAIN TAYO.  Aside from being Akameras’ first music single (Akameras = Anne and I), bibimbap is a meal sa may Gui sa caf up and looked delicious kasi. So I had lunch with sina Anne, Kim, Gio, and Allan. Anne and I bought the bibimbap pero nadisappoint kami kasi masmasarap pa yung ibang food. Not worth P70 na ‘to guys. Bumili rin ng cake si Anne. Yummy in fairness. Parang CT (ang makaintindi, matalino).  ~ Super sorry kay Allan kung nahurt siya… Kala ko pa naman may deep understanding na tayo Allan… JOKES! Mukha ka kasing affected kanina eh. Sorry talaga. From Mamera and I and our suwail na anak ~   ENG AND LIT CLASS… AGAIN.  Feeling ko maaantok na naman ako. Pero hindi naman pala. Late sina TG, Za, Raf, and Jaime kasi traffic. Hehe next time agahan na guys. Discussion lang sa ENG. Naalive ako kasi I was finally recognized as valage by the prof! wahaha Pawin sa prof = points! Kawindang ang hw ever. Ang kapal just for 1 quiz. Feeling ko bagsak ako sa Monday. ~ Sa LIT naman, natatawa ako kasi our prof calls Zaza “ROBERN.” Feeling ko tuloy siya yung nurse na hindi marunong magspell ng name ni Pajamas. Ayun. Kawindang din ang mga critiques na kailangan on two books. Gudlak sakin at sa Final 2.   OH FABILIOH.  Eto na cheer rally na. Pinauwi ko muna bag ko para no hassle. Tapos Blue Eagle’s Gym na ‘to kasamang maglakad sina Anne & Sybil. Nagmerienda din kami nila Anne, Kim, and Allan. (Allan, nagpaparamdam ka na talaga… supporive ako no matter what!) I saw DIO na rin, may CLOSE HS FRIEND! AS IN! Natuwa ako. Ang haba ng hair mo… literally. Namiss kita infairness. Haynako stressful ever na guys. The usual cheer rally: CADS danced (I really wanna join CADS pero my blockmates say I don’t have what it takes.. how sad), Blue Babble people, Alma Mater song, tapos game na. Mahgod nato. Chris Tiu forever!!! DIZIZIT guys girls and everything in between. Perfect package na to. Pero mas maganda ako kay Cla. Gudlak sa kanila wahaha. Haynako. Nakakamelt si Chris at si Wes. Pero mahgod. Tama na ang paglalaway! Magpapastamp pa pala ako.  ~ Sorry Anjo, hindi ako nakapunta ng KFC. Kasi naman, umalis kagad kayo nila Aldrich at Oliver. Napaisip tuloy ako. Parang ang super sandali mo lang sa ADMU… less then 2 hours pa ata yun, tas umuwi na agad kayo. Ang haba ng pila eh kaya di ako nakasunod kagad. Till next time. Sana soon. I’ll bring Norah next time. SHOUTOUT to Rocky and Petz! Glad I saw you both today… ~   PAKSHET.  Pamatay na guys. Paglabas palang ang hirap na. I saw Pussies sa line. BUT NO, si Ayl at Lance ay gumawa ng sariling linya. So nakilinya na kami ni Mamera at Grace. Saw Pam and Myreign and Jaime too. After eternity and a minute, nakapagpastamp na rin kami. SHETAS yan. As in, pamatay. Super napagod ako at wala nakong powers so call driver at uwi na kagad. (Haynako Ayl. Burgis ka talaga… mapakotse, cellphone, or real estate.. waahhah) Okay fine. Nagdrive-thru ako sa McDo. Di na kaya ng stomach ko.  ~ Sorry to Dotz, Ervin, Bobby, and Eunice and the rest of Q1 ‘cos I wasn’t able to go to their respective bday salu-salo. Super pagod na talaga ako after the stamp thing. Di ko na nga makausap yung mga tao sa parking lot eh. Just wanted to go hom badly. I know it’s sayand. It could’ve been an opportunity to get to know you more pero I know I will in time. Haha mejo struggle lang kasi no Orsem to help me out. But I’ll try my best haha. Cool naman pala ang Q1 eh. No point of comparing with Q cos diff ang people sa both blocks. And we’ll eventually and hopefully we’ll all be classmates soon. Haha sorry talaga. Gustuhin ko man, my body won’t allow me to. Baka maging lame at corny lang akong kasama. Till next time na lang. And we have INTAC soon. Pasensya na ha, Q1. ~  ¤ Was it worth it to be pushed around in heat and sweat and cramped people just to get a free cut in PE for Tuesday? Was it worth to attend the Cheer Rally and sit with my friends when I could be relaxing at home? Was it worth it to get into BMH and struggle to just survive the curriculum? Was it worth to go through one hell of a day in the company of your friends and blockmates? ¤   Was it all worth it?   For me, it was. More than you could ever think so.

      Good day today. Not so stressful naman. Kaya madaldal ako ngayon.  I woke up early for my 7:00-8:00a PE 101. Ayun, I met Tantan and Erick sa may Manang’s since hindi pa naman 7am. Tantan borrowed my tennis racket since yun yung PE niya… it’s been gradeschool since I really last played tennis.. Sa HS kasi, it’s not really one of the sports offered. Okay naman ang PE. Group discussion lang and before I knew it, time na pala.  Super antok ako so I went home na kagad. Pero when I got home, nawala bigla antok ko. So I just rewrote my Math notes. OC talaga ako pagdating sa notes. Nakaseparate yung solutions ko sa principles/concepts. At take note, color-coded pa! Ay basta. Para maganda at mas organized. ~ Nakausap ko rin si Peter (Belmi), my dearest friend and mentor sa kalandian. Miss ko na talaga siya!!! Kelangan na talaga kami magbonding one of these days…  On the way to school, sa car nako nakatulog… haha. Got back to school just in time for FIL. Heck, I thought the DT results were to be announced na, para maalis na ang kaba sa lahat. Hindi pa pala. We just discussed Panitikang Tradisyunal in what seemed like forever… Boring talaga… Mas naantok ako. After FIL, straving-to-the-hungriest-level nako. So tumakbo ako sa Rizal Lib para sunduin si Anne who was working on her ENG essay. (Hello pala kay Chrissy, ang image model ng Citibank Mini-Card! Wahahaha) ~ Si Idol, nawala yung cellphone for the 2nd time, nawala rin yung red bag. Who knows baka his friends played a prank on him… ABA! Kami pa ni Anne ang suspects! Wahaha Idol ha.  Sa Step(s), we met Step(h) --- our great TNT! She was supposed to write sa Lib… but she needed a break daw so sumama nalang siya samin for lunch! Touched kami siyempre… si Steph talaga, nadevelop na raw siya sa mga libro niya. Haynako. Pero I told Steph na proud dapat siya sa Q ‘cos it’s super bonded as in to the max. Ayun. So kuwentuhan at update dito chika jan all the time… Until may makita kaming certain sa next table. MAHGOD! Then nagsidatingan sina France, Ryan, and AJ. I dared them to know the guy’s name, year, and course. Ayaw nila. Si AJ gusto ng ice cream, si France P100 pero ituturo daw ako… Then Terrell and his friend Matthew joined us din sa table. Ayaw din ni Terrell. Culture shock pa ata yung friend niya. But NO! Kasama ni France si Erickson Torio… our AHS salu!! I knew him by name and the fact that he’s Mr. Salutatorian. Siya rin yung nasa harap ko during graduation honors. Kinamayan pa niya ko nun. Ang bait no? Anyway. Siyempre I dared him then and after much convincing, MAHGOD! DIZIZIT! ERICK DID IT! WAAAH!!! Super nashock ako and the rest (si Terrell, hindi pa nakakarecover..) James Gregorio, 2nd year Computer Science… HAAY! Thank you thank you Torio! Dabest ka! Visit us again para fun! You’re nice and kalog haha!!! You’re a guy’s guy.  Then Math na finally. As usual, maaantok na naman ako. Sobrang like ko pa naman ang Math. But the teacher, in my opinion, does not approach Math the way my past teachers have done (Mrs. Ong, especially, even though she’s super strict and terror teacher talaga). Basta. I feel bored. So kami ni Marga (my good blockmate friend!) kept on talking and sharing small laughters during the class.. pero we were listening too! I met then her friend, and my ENG blockmate pala, JOHN! He came from UST and transferred to ADMU so freshie siya ulit. He seemed nice… Uy I sense. JOKES!  After Math, derecho Xavier nako. Dinaanan ko si Mamera dun and some of my ENG blockmates tapos uwi na kagad. Super pagod.  ¤ A while ago, in our PE 101 class, we discussed some facts and fallacies regarding fitness/exercise/health. One group came up said that it is fallacious to say that “with no pain, there is no gain.” Ofcourse, they were referring to muscle training, saying that people think when you don’t feel pain, you don’t build up your muscles well. For this, I agree. But for other things, I still believe in it:  NO PAIN, NO GAIN.  Okay fine. You can gain something by taking the easy way. Pero diba, mas masarap yung pakiramdam pag nagsucceed ka sa isang bagay at alam mong pinaghirapan at pinagtuunan mo ng oras, dugo, at pawis ang bagay na iyon? ~ I hope I survive this first year. I hope all of us freshmen do.  NO PAIN, NO GAIN.  We can do this. (And have lots of fun along the way) ¤

      BEFORE I START: I’d like to say hi to my pretty pretty girl, NINA!! Cos it’s a record, I see her everyday in school. In fact, almost every break. Now how’s that?!!! I really love this girl. Super favorite. Sweet, nice, and beautiful. Even more so than me, I must admit. Haha  HI NINA! Lovelots! MWAH!!!   I haven’t updated the whole weekend because my family and I stayed overnight from Friday night until Sunday noon kanina sa Makati Shang. It was my sister’s graduation from DLSU Taft kasi last night, so we had to stay in Makati para malapit sa school niya.   FRIDAY  I went home to pack my things and then my younger bro (Justin) and my lil sis (Kim) went straight to Makati to meet mom. Sa sobrang gutom, kain agad kami sa Food Choices, G4. Tapos we went to buy my sister’s grad gift (TechnoMarine). Nagshop din yung mom ko for my Lolo’s gift for Fathers’ Day. Ako naman, nag-ikot-ikot sa Tower Records and Powerbooks. Voila!!! I finally found the Siddharta book. Wala kasi sa mga National branches na pinuntahan ko. So atleast, I have a copy na for my LIT class. Zaza found copies din of the book sa may Megamall. So good for us I guess.   SATURDAY  I woke up around 10am to type in my mom’s laptop. I had to finish this group presentation needed for ENG. Kim and my nephew Timmy went swimming. My younger bro went to Galleria with his friends. Ako, type lang ng type. I finished mga 2pm na. So I went to G4 to have them printed and after that, to National, to have them photocopied on acetate for tom’s presentation on OHP. Kapagod. Then that night, the whole SIY Dynasty ate dinner at Shang Palace (2nd floor, Makati Shang). SIY Dynasty kasi relatives sa mother’s side, eh pure Chinese si Mommy. So ayun. Sarap ng food. It also means lumobo na naman ako ng ilang inches. Hehe atleast honest ako. Wahahaha (“,)   SUNDAY  Woke up rather late. Nagcheck-out kami and then late lunch sa Rustan’s. Bumili rin ng konting stuff sa National. Suki na talaga kami. Exag ang pila. Anyway, grocery lasted until 4pm. Ang mahal na talaga ng mga bilihin. Kahit ako, feel ko na ang effects nito. Got home around 5pm. Ayos muna ng mga papers/school things bago mag-online. And here I am now.  ¤ Most people do and don’t watch Showbiz Talk Shows like The Buzz. I do watch them, not religiously, but I find it fun to watch these shows. Interesting personalities call for interested viewers. But I never knew that one can actually pick something so true and great from a show like this. I was watching an interview of Maricel Soriano and her son, Maron. Maron is around 19 years old. Maricel has another son, Tien, who is around 8 years old I presume. The difference between these two boys of Maricel is that Tien is her real son and Maron was adopted. The interviewer (Cristy Fermin) asked Maricel: “So pano mo sinabi kay Maron yung totoong identity niya?” Maron was just 8 years old at the time Maricel explained to his kids about Maron’s identity. But she couldn’t have put it in any better way than she did.   “Ikaw Tien, galing ka sa tiyan ni Mommy. Pero si Kuya Maron, galing naman sa heart ni Mommy.”   Sabihin niyo na ang lahat, na mababaw ang luha ko at loob ko, pero halos naiyak nako when I heard that. How true and sincere. Iba talaga ang mga nanay pagdating sa pagiging parents. Iba rin talaga ang puwede mo mapulot from a show like The Buzz. You’ll never know when another personality speaks so honest and sincere about things. Iba talaga ang nanay. And I know it’s June 20 today, and although most of the world would be celebrating differently (at kahit mayroon akong pinaghuhugutan sa history ko at ng family ko),  HAPPY MOTHERS’ DAY  to all the moms out there. A shout-out to you all. I love you, ma. Iba ka kasi talaga. ¤

      [Hindi ako nakapost yesterday. I finished kasi a journal entry due Friday for English. Napiga utak ko. Di na kinaya ng powers kong magsulat for this.]  Today ang pinakanakakapagod na araw so far.  I was supposed to have a 7-8a PE 101 class but our prof is so nice, she scheduled a free cut today so I woke up rather late around 9am. I got to school mga 10am. I was supposed to meet Teegee at Rizal Lib to research for LIT but she was done na pala. So after dropping by the Q people sa caf up, Enzo and I accompanied Raf to DSWS for his locker. After that, Raf and I went to the library where we saw Grace. Tapos, they left din kagad for their 10:30 Fil class.  Nagresearch ako on my own. And mahgod, nahilo ako at first. Thanks to TG, she texted me where I could find the references for fiction--- 3rd floor pa pala! So umakyat ako. Super quiet infairness. And I found 5 useful books naman kagad. And then mga 11:00a I line up for the xerox machine. SHET. Ang bagal at ang tagal. I stood there mga 1 hour and that’s no exag. Tinext ko pa nga si Anne to tell her na naiinip nako sa kakapila. Eh mga 11:50a na, may 12n Fil pako. So after na hour lining up, I had to leave the books tapos babalikan ko nalang yung xerox copies. HAAAY. What a waste of time.  In FIL class, Diagnostic lang ulit. I sat with sina Angie and the Q1 people. Hirap nung test as usual. At naghula-hoops ako in most of the items. Hirap icomprehend eh.  And then 1.5 hour break. After eating sa caf up with Q, punta kami ni lovely Madel sa National. She needed to buy a book and I needed to buy some stuff din. Ayun. Bumalik naman kami kagad. Tapos Rizal Lib na ulit. We did some school stuff, quietly yun ah. Haha. Moments later, nafeel ko na ang presence ni Mamera. So NAWINDANG nako talaga haha. Parang nabreak ang silence ng Rizal Lib. In fairness, maraming natutulog!! At hindi naman sila nahuhuli so I guess I should try it sometime.  Math class na ulit. BORING ulit. Longest 1 ½ hours ko talaga. As in, sabi nga namin nila Chris and Marga, yung area of interest, umaabot lang sa 2nd row. Nasa 4th row kasi kami. Parang patay yung mga nasa likuran including us habang sabayang pagbigkas naman ang effect ng mga girls sa harap kapag nagrerecite/nagbabasa. Haha.  After Math, super pagod na. I just met Mamera lang kasi sasabay ulit siya sakin. Pero hindi ganun kahyper ang trip namin ngayon. Napapikit ngako most of the ride.  ¤ May dilemma ngako ngayon eh. Kasi apparently, Q has this badminton thing set up for tomorrow. At di kinaya ng body ko ang time: 7:30am. To think na 11:30 pa first class ko. Windang na naman ako ever. So dilemma siya. I don’t know if I should wake up or just miss the Q thing nalang. Si Mamera daw pupunta. Ako, di ko pa talaga alam. Is it worth the bonding time with Q? The hell it is. Q pa. Laging masaya sa Q kasi masayahin ang mga tao rito… (maliban nalang siguro kay Karen… na hindi ko na ata nakita ever after orsem… Kung sinuman ang nakakita sa kanya, ipagbigay alam lang sa DSWS sa Colayco…)  But my heart does not dictate what my body can do.  Sobrang gustuhin ko man, it could be na pagod na pagod talaga ako at hindi ako magising. If I wake up early tomorrow, then, see you guys. ¤

      Day 2 palang, nakakapagod na talaga. Here’s what I had for today.  07:00a GOOD MORNING. Ang aga ko talaga gumising for this class… mga 6:30am, nasa school nako. Nakipagtawanan muna ako sa mga kakosa natin from Pussy sa Manang’s while waiting for the bell. PE101 was great, great because Ms. Vinarao is so nice. Four scheduled free cuts, atleast an 80% for exemption, and regular attendance all lead to an easy A. Haaay. I’m glad I took it right away. Maraming sophomores sa class. Six lang kaming freshmen, and I only know Henson from Comm.  08:30a GOOD MORNING AGAIN. I went back home cos my next class is 12noon pa. So glad walang traffic. For the first time, super relaxed ako. I have something like 3 hours to just relax at home or snooze for a while. But no. Siyempre hindi ako natulog. Pinapak ko ang napakasarap na Gonuts Donuts. Naaddict na naman ako as usual.  10:30a GOOD MORNING PA RIN. I dropped by InterMatrix first kasi nagpalaminate ako. And then sa Kodak naman for my 1x1 pictures. Naubusan na kasi ako eh mahgod. Then it’s lunch time na for Block Q!  Sinundo ko pa talaga sila from their FIL class. Anything for Block Q.  Anything.   12:00n GOOD AFTERNOON. It’s FIL. Valaj yung prof namin for sure. May pagkamataray eh. With some Q1 people again. Atleast mejo nakakausap ko na talaga sila better than before. They’re nice naman. I’ve to get to know them more lang talaga. The Diagnostic Test in my opinion was hard & long (yung mga bastos jan! get hold of yourselves!) Pero I hope I pass naman. Ayoko mabasic. Hindi naman nakakahiya pero bawal kasi magDL. Sayang naman diba.  01:00p GOOD AFTERNOON. Maaga kami nadismiss sa FIL, 30 mins earlier. So shopping na agad kami ni Mamera Anne sa National. Ang kulit namin dun sobra! I check pa with my skin kung smooth yung paper nung pad/notebook haha! Then we stopped by Jollibee for some snacks and headed back to school na just in time for my math and Anne’s modern jazz.  03:00p GOOD LORD. I think we got a bad teacher, a terror teacher at that. Super naman. Kami nila Claude at Val from Q1, parang sabi namin exag yung teacher. Imagine. Pantay dapat yung equal signs. AT ITO ANG DI KINAYA NG POWERS KO: The negative sign should be somewhere aligned with the middle of the equal sign! KAMON! Lokohan na to. Vanity is vanity to a certain extent. Ang arte naman niya. Math is concerned with the problem-solution-answer and not how they are written. Owell. Strict talaga siya. It’s gonna be one difficult sem for Math for us. GOOD LAK.  04:30p GOOD DAY. Generally a good day. Uwian time na eh. Anne and I will be going home together. Pero kinuha ko muna yung Math book ko. First I saw the pila and I was left aghast kasi ang haba. Pero Thank God for such nice guyz from Q1!!! Salamat guyz even if we barely know each other… especially si BRIAN, yung naghandle nung book thing. Tosha.  05:00 GOOD TRIP. Mahgod! Somewhere sa Imelda Ave. bumaba kami ni Anne to commute on the way home. Pinauna ko na kasi yung driver to my lil bro. Naawa naman ako kung late siya masusundo eh may Chinese tutor pa siya. Traffic kasi eh so nagFX nalang kami ni Anne. Tawa na naman kami ng tawa. Grabe. Pero masaya pa rin. Dabest talaga si Mamera ever. No doubt.  ¤ GOOD. However stressful my day got, nasa sakin pa rin if I wanna feel good about it or not eh. Sometimes “good” things just come your way, but when they don’t, there are other things to feel good about.  Friends. Classes. Even yourself.  I know we don’t have control over any situation; but neither does it have total control over us. Think about it. Feel good about yourself and the things around you. Always  have a nice day . GOOD NIGHT. ¤

      Can I say  “stressed?”  Yes, I still can.  My day started out okay ‘cos I got out of bed around 9:30am only to leave an hour later. When I got to school, lo and behold, the ever united Block Q was there in Xavier Hall. I got my ID first (the Ateneo HS’ ID looked better for some reason) and joined the group for more chit-chat as usual.  People kept comparing their schedules that morning. Apparently, Allan-Kim-Gio-Anne had the same Math sections which is different from the other Q people. (This made the block sectioning quite odd actually… I mean, you don’t really have that many classes with your block pala). They're in section MM --- mas mahirap, mas madali… whatever the meaning is or if any at all.  Siyempre, OP naman ako ‘cos I really can’t have common classes with the Q people aside from PE and NatSci ‘cos remember, I’m from Q1 na. The first bell rang and the foursome had to leave me with my class na. I prepared for another hour of quiet me since it’s highly possible I don’t know anyone from the class.  Hindi pala. Carlo Mendoza from AHS-B2004 (ME) was there as well as Charmaine (good friend of Candice, both from LM). The Q1 people at the back looked familiar so I went on and seated with them. I formally met Jeremy (he’s nice) and Ajie (not sure about the spelling yet --- sounds like) and they’re both from Chang Kai Shek. I had a good friend from Chang Kai, so we had common friends, fortunately. I also met Jan (O Boy daw sa AHS, pero di ko naman kilala…). I remember Chris from SOM night, nice guy. Also met PJ from LaSalle. And I remembered Aris from the guidance test. So there, those are my initial blockmates.  Physics was okay. Got screwed up with the room assignment along with a Sophomore class and a Math 18 class. Sa Faura pala kami. So ayun. Aral kagad. Andami ko nang naabsorb. The class is easy. I’m glad I chose Physics. Optional ang Final Exam when you reach D and above sa pre-final mark mo. Pasa na agad. Pero of course, I suddenly remembered BMH people can only have B as their lowest mark. Shocks. Hassle naman bigla.  Lunch was FUN! As in, let’s volt in na naman ang effect ng Block Q. I’m so happy with this block no matter what, ‘cos  OHANA  talaga.  Nobody gets left behind.  I was in the same table as sina Allan, Lance, Anne, Gio, Idol Cris, and France. Super fun. Kalog talaga yang si France in fairness sa kanya. Hindi siya yung type na hinihiritan ako and then maiinis ako. Matatawa pako in fact. Owell. Iba talaga Block Q.  English is okay din. Fun yung teachers ng ENG and LIT. Pero mejo naantok lang ako kasi parang naglecture na rin yung teacher. And it looked difficult. 97 to get an A. Basta, parang mataas yung standards nung teacher. “Dr” kasi. Taas ng degree. TAKE NOTE: Dami agad homework for LIT. Nawindang ako sa dami. All due on Friday pa. Haaaaay. This is EET na talaga, no joke.  ¤ Today has its ups and downs. A friend of mine got irritated with me during lunch. It’s cos ang landi-landi ko and I couldn’t get my mouth shut. Pero sa totoo lang, affected talaga ako nung nainis siya sakin. Napaisip tuloy ako the next 2 hours. Often times, people tell me how I’m so open and that “ I wear my heart on my sleeves .” Well, word of advice. Don’t. At least, not always. Don’t OPEN too much, I told myself. You’ll never know how one of your treasured friends might CLOSE on you. Save some for tomorrow. ¤

      O well. School  officially  starts tomorrow. Puro orsem chuva lang yung past few days so baka misled ang ibang freshman na all fun lang ang college… As for me, todo na ‘to --- to the highest level… Medyo nilulumot na ang brain ko so I need to refresh it again with a bit of studying in the next few weeks!  Normal Sunday pa rin today. I woke up mga 10:30a na naman (I’m getting kind of irritated na kasi parang nahahalata kong ang aga ko gumising lately… napapabreakfast tuloy ako, ergo, lumolobo na naman ako!) So ayun. Eh I got kinda bored and decided to tag along with my sister (Kristine) and my mom to G4. Naiitch ata ang sister ko for some shopping. Napasama na rin yung youngest (Kim) and my nephew (Timmy).  We got there around noontime. Pero we decided to drop by National first to buy a few things na kailangan ni Kim. Tapos, I had some stuff laminated na rin. Super dami ng tao. I told Anne nga, buong Philippines ata nasa G4. Sabi naman ni Anne (through text), buong Asia naman daw nasa Megamall… haha!!! (“,) Sabi ko, she got one part wrong. Wala yung Cambodians sa Megamall. Nasa Alimall sila ngayon, kasi sale. Hehe… Gagu talaga kaming dalawa… Owell.  Ayun. My sister has long wanted a new TechnoMarine watch… mga 30 mins ata kaming nasa store kasi she kept on checking out different watches. Mahgod naman! Yung natipuan pa niya yung P88,000 worth!!!! Siyempre, from my point of view, cellphone nalang. May pocket money pa! At may clock feature na yun! Wahahah (well, one of my known luxuries kasi are cellphones… Madali kasi ako magpalit kaya nabbankrupt ako at nagiging sobrang poor minsan… I have to change… Hehe)  Well. Since nagkanya-kanya na kami ng sister ko at ng mom ko, I was left walking from one store to the other, thinking what I should buy. Mom went to buy the usual grocery, and my sister went on her shopping spree… Hours after, around 6pm, we met at Rustan’s. I bought this book, “Eragon” (a cross between Harry Potter & LOTR) written by 19 year old English college student Christopher Paolini.  TAKE NOTE: Eragon is Book 1 of the Inheritance Trilogy… This Eragon outsold Harry Potter Five in Britain. Hmmmmmmmm So expect a film franchise in a few years.   Anyway, maganda siya. Recommended by my Tita from the States. Ayan. At palabasa talaga ako ngayon after The DaVinci Code. And para magising na rin ulit ang aking English skills! Hehe pasukan na eh. I also got the new Corrs album, “Borrowed Heaven,” and Ben Jelen’s debut album, “Give It All Away.” Ayun… kasi mga 3 weeks na rin ata akong hindi nakakabili ng CD so todo bawi talaga ito!  On our way home, we dropped by Ice Monster sa Fort. Super obsessed kasi ako sa Ice Monster, especially Mango Ice. And I wanna indulge in it while okay pa, kasi feel ko mawawala yan pag rainy season na talaga. Hindi na akma..  Ayun lang. Got home around 8pm. Pero okay lang kahit late ako matulog tonight, cos 11:30am pa 1st class ko tom. YEHEY! I’d rather have afternoon classes than morning classes so that I won’t have to wake up ever so early in the morning. Batugan pa naman ako sa umaga. I’ll be meeting Mamera/Anne tomorrow around 10:30am. Huling bonding before we separate ways… haha yuck ang drama. Pero seriously.  ¤ Whatever we do, hindi natin mararating ang “day after tomorrow.” Naisip ko lang. It will always be “today, tomorrow’s yesterday, or yesterday’s tomorrow.” Well, what I’m trying to say is  carpe diem . Let’s  seize the day . Seize every opportunity that comes our way this day. I welcome all the freshmen including myself to college. Let’s make the most out of it. ¤

      It's June 12, and mahgod, it feels like any normal weekend.  Woke up rather early around 10:30am... at nainis ako siyempre cos i usually wake up around 12noon to 1pm (and that's "normal" by my standards).  Well, as usual, boring na naman. I just read The DaVinci Code from 11am till around 2pm. Tapos napuruhan na ata ako sa reading. Madali ma-strain ang eyes ko cos i have a 550/500 eyesight (near-sighted). Grabe no? I'm waiting till my debut/18th birthday so i can have them lasered.. haha goodbye astigmatism.  Grabe. Walang food sa bahay, so i just ordered pizza from Lil' Caesar's (no choice.. siya yung nearest!). Tapos i called Anne na and KaB[oo]M!!! Nabuhayan ako bigla! ang daldal kasi naming dalawa.. haynako.. she's really the best. i'm so glad i got to meet her, along with the others in Block Q.  Mejo nakapagreflect na rin ako sa status ko sa Block Q1. Perhaps i really should give myself a chance to get to know them. 2 weeks, sabi nga ni Anne. 'Pag hindi pa rin okay ang aura nila, hindi na siguro talaga kami ever magcclick. Pero all the same, I'm happy i'm in both blocks. Frustrating lang siguro to be so damn fun in one block and be so utterly quiet in the latter one. 2 weeks..  Mejo Anne and I just don't like the first impression na block Q1 isn't as united as Q. Kasi last Friday, during the long break of the Guidance Testing, i saw four girls huddled together. ABA. Naaoutcast pala sila from the larger bulk of Q1. How sad naman, i thought. Cos it doesn't happen in Q. O well. Different blocks. Different people.  Mahgoodnes. Anne and I talked din from 4:30pm until around 6:30p. That's 2 hours ha!! tagal din.. at naudlot lang yun cos i was starving na talaga. We could've gone on for anotehr 2 hours if we continued our conversation. Hindi kami nauubusan ng mapag-uusapan at mapagtatawanan! Hehe (",)  ¤ Well, today I celebrated independence my old fashion way--- just by being myself. Speaking my mind. Talking on the phone for as long as i want. Talking and laughing just about everything. Freedom. Independence. Long before college, feel na feel ko nang free ako. Celebrate yours, too. You'll see: Ang sarap ng 'filling' mo... ¤

      It's my " first time ."  Sorry to everyone if this blog seems plain and somewhat boring. I just got inspired by my blockmate and dear friend Anne a.k.a Mamera... It gets so boring and stale at home and thought this could save me from boredom at times ¤  I'm not really a techie but i'll try to get help from my friends who are. Para gumanda naman 'to tulad ko.. Haha c",)  And besides, it's not the "look" of the blog that would make everything interesting. The blogs themselves would.. haha ¤  And since it is Independence Day today, this blog is sort of an expression of the freedom I have as a college freshman.   Enjoy reading. (",)

      Grabe. Hindi na ngako nag-uupdate. Mejo nassad din ako kasi this is sort of my outlet na rin amidst all the heavy school stuff I’ve been trying to accomplish. God Bless Me for this.  First of all, goodness, I didn’t know there was this Discernment Talk for the Sanggu thing. Sayang. I would’ve attended if I knew, eh nabasa ko lang sa Q groups. But of course, I’m not sure pa rin about that Batch Pres thing. I just hope may boboto sakin if ever (yuck fishing… hello mga friends… remember me wahahaha).  I went to school very early, as in mga 8am nasa school nako for the simple reason na kailangan ko maabutan sina Erick at Peter to give their gifts. (12 July – BELATED HAPPY BIRTHDAY! And Kim Ong na rin!) So I saw Erick at the caf along with his blockmates. Pati ang mga SMOKING blockmates. How disappointing. Eew. Never. Baga Verde na ‘to guys. Sabi ni Erick, vow daw niya since 17 na siya ay lalayuan na niya si Smoker. Ehdi akin na siya! Thanks Erick! Para tuloy ako yung may bday! Wahaha another calendar boy!  After that, bonding naman with ME people (Carlo, Carla, Riva, E. John, Paula-want-a-craker) and Pam (I Bio). GRABEHAN na. Naloka ako kay Carlo. Another Bboy debate na naman kanina which was actually fun. As usual, anti-Carlo ako. Haha Si Pam naman, love ko na forever. As in babaeng bading na ‘to. Super love ko talaga ‘to! As in! Dinare ko siya to ask the name of one of my tipcies (kahit kilala ko na talaga) and to tell him “I like you shirt. Where’d you get it?” GRABE! Ginawa ng gaga. Dabest. Si Justin Panteleon yun, which Pam presumed, ay may pagkavalage pala. GOOD NEWS!! Haha Anyway, I treated her to NY french fries for a great feat. And then tawa na kami ng tawa forever.  Tapos I went to LIB with PE101 groupmates Henson and Fids, both from Comm. We planned our presentation this Thursday na. Malaking bulk din ng grade eh. Sa 3rd floor kami para puede mag-ingay (thanks kay Kim for referring this place to me last time).  Then Physics na. As usual, boring. Nagnnotes naman kami at nakikinig pero may OTHER activity kami palagi. Last week, nagtelenovela-themesong-marathon kami ni Jerms. So kanta lang kami ng kanta ni Jeremy (infairview, maganda ang tone niya). This week, pagalingan naman magdrawing inspired by “Hiram.” Parang mga pictorials wahaha! Kaloka! Chaka pa naman ng drawing ko.  Lunch time with Q again. Sina Zaza at Jaime, first gumagawa ng English report. The next thing you know, baraha na naman. Ang Q talaga, breeding ground ng mga sugarol. NagBMH sila para magsugal wahahah jokes! Math Nerdox ang effect ng lahat kanina kasi super hirap ng quiz nila Anne, France, Allan and company. As in, kung ako yun, olats na ‘to guys. Highest level ang hirap, parang long exam… Owell goodluck to me on Thursday.  Pinakita rin ang ever print-out ng Sino Ang Para Kanino poster! Grabehan na. Voting na ‘to guys. Gumawa na si France ng poll sa groups so vote na! GO! (Si Allan, awaw bumoto. Boto na. Si Kim bumoto na o. Pahuhuli ka pa ba?!) Haha bumoto na ko. And I think it’s a good vote (wink wink)  Grabe. Para kaming naglongexam sa English. Mga 7 pages yung “quiz.” Andami pang mga babasahin before answering. Buti nga kinancel yung paragraph writing or else. Dizizit na naman. Sa LIT, as usual, dabest si Ms. Batin. Masyado siyang masaya at madaldal (ahem ahem). As in, nakaisang report lang ulit today. Laging naddelay. Andami niyang dinadagdag. Gravice. Lost na. May long essay quiz na naman on Wednesday.  After ENG/LIT, I went to Anne’s room. Kita ko na naman si ValaGio (I PolSci)… grabe. I still doubt his masculinity. Pero magaling siya sumayaw infairness. (Shoutout to NINA! Glad I saw you sa English class mo kanina.. we have the same teacher pala! Fun! Gluck sa CADS! You’ll make it.) Going back, ayun nga. Malaki ang potential maging valage ni Gio pero nonetheless super bait siya. Grabe. Let’s see in the next few weeks. Hahaha  Siyempre, bonding na naman with Mamera and Candice and Carla from LM. Punta muna kaming LIB to settle that xerox thing ni Candong. Tapos uwi na rin after. Sumabay si Mamera… at siyempre kelangan namin dumaas sa McDo cos that’s the way home… and VOILA! GOOD LORD! GOD FORBID…  ¤ … MAHGOD! Iba na ‘to. Nagkakaron nako ng kakaibang infatuation, as in ibang level ng obsession guys. Kanina feel na feel ko ang pagkaBarbie dahil we saw K. Mahgoodness. Dizizit. Talo ni Sola. Talo na si Berto. Talo na si Benedicto. Talo na si Pantaleon. NAPATUMBA SILANG LAHAT ni… kiRK! WHOA! Greatest victory ko pag na-cozy ko siya. Whaha si Candice kasi, walang kuwentang bridge - she’s falling down. Wahhaha love yah Candong. As in kakaiba na ‘to guys. I expect tataas na ang population ng Katips at ng customers ng McDo dahil sa innovative billboard na ito. Wahhaha Mamayang madaling araw, tatapyasin ko yun mula sa kinalalagyan niya. Grabe na. “Thisisit, oh, I finally found someone.” Whaha chaka ang fez kasi parang moon na rocky road na rough. Pero mahgod nagccompensate ang kanyang physique! THISISIT! I love to hang around ten times a day na talaga! Grabe.  Nahalata ko na in my first month sa college, there are far too many fish in the sea. As in, yung dala kong lambat, hindi pa magkasya lahat ng tipcies. I need to get a new one na. Yung iba malalansa na fish (tulad ni Justin kasi I smell valage). Meron namang mga Blue Marlin ang effect… at may mga fish na may rock-hard abs. Imagine guys! Isdang may abs! Wahahaha sayang pandak si kiRk. Pero o well, you know what they say about small people having big… hearts. HOI! Wholesome pa rin ako no! wahhaha  Haynako pero kahit gaano kadami ang fish sa sea, walang kuwenta naman lahat ng connections. Ryan, Allan, Kim, Candice, Karen, JigJig, Pam, Marga. AS in sariling battle/struggle na ‘to guys. Parang fightfightfight na naman ito. Full powers na ang kailangan. Basta. GAME NA GUYS!!!!!!!!!! This will be my sweetest victory wehehe Tama na nga. Exag na eh. Napapagod na ko sa mga loaded words na ito.  Andami lang talagang isda. Ang sarap magpawin. Ang sarap maging pawikan. Hilig ko nang lumangoy… Konti nalang, mamamaster ko na ang art of swimming wahaha! Grabe! 1st month palang yan ha. I love I love I love mah calendar… Humanda ka Blue Marlin ka. Manginig ka na. Magiiba na ang pananaw mo wahahah Hindi ka na magiging homophobe… in 30 days. Wahahahaha Yay skeri. FEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSH TAYOOOOOOOOO. ¤

      Guys, sorry if I just updated now. I barely survived this week of college life. Nakakawindang as I aptly put it.  I arrived in school rather early around 10:30am cos I was supposed to have this interview pero napostpone so I stayed at the caf with my good buddy Oliver [1 AB Philo] and his blockmate Andrea.  In FIL class, discussion as usual. In all fairness, nagrecite ako this time around. Usually kasi inaaantok ako during FIL. Haha babaw. After FIL came the interview by Elaine. She’s this sophomore classmate of mine in Physics and she asked me several questions about The Da Vinci Code for 15 minutes. Basically I told her my faith wasn’t moved or changed otherwise. Sorry Dan Brown haha  Mamera went to Katips with her friends then sa College Lane where she did her HW. So I went to caf up and ate lunch with both Q people and Q1 people. Zaza, Cris, Earl, and Jaime played cards as usual. WILD GAME I must say. As in hinahangin na yung mga cards and all. Caught a glimpse of Myreign but she had to go home na agad.  I’m glad I bonded with Q1 today. Si Jeremy talaga. Grabe makiride sa mga tarayan namin. Para na talaga kaming magkaaway sa batuhan namin ng lines. Pero jokes lang Jerms. Hehe Final One ka pa rin para sakin kasi super super smart mo! Si Mark (Dee) naman, panay ang chinese lessons kay Bobby! Grabehan na! Si Van naman, reminisce mode kina Benita, Grutas, etc. (Mga teachers namin during grade school. Van and I were schoolmates/batchmates until Grade 6).  So after all the tawanan during break, Math time na. Our teacher wasn’t so bad after all. I mean, she’s good naman. Mas naenjoy namin nila Jan and Marga yung class. Masaya naman. We can chitchat and slouch all we can unlike our previous Math class. One more thing. Our classmates think that we were just promoted from Basic Math, so medyo inuunderestimate nila kami. Okay lang. I love being an underdog! Haha  After Math, GA na kagad ng BlueRep (musical theatre org) sa Gonzaga Exhibit Hall. Pero sinamahan ko rin muna si Karen and JigJig (1 BS Bio) since may mineet din akong friend sa Colayco. And then takbo na sa Gonzaga for BlueRep! Grabehan na. Hindi bumebenta ang jokes ng mga coño sakin. Owell. Hectic ng sched ah. I think I am leaning towards dropping BlueRep as an org kasi parang di ko kaya ang 630-830 for the next two weeks araw-araw! GRABEHAN to the highest level ha. I’ll think about it. Tantan (1 BS Bio) said he’ll try it for the first workshop day. So I might try it too, who knows. I’m praying naman for Mamera. Sana maenlighten na siya kasi medyo may dilemma siya ngayon. She really wants this, but it seems ayaw niya marisk ang studies niya. She cares about her BMH course right now. I think, so much nga eh. Anne: You want this BlueRep thing. Try it. Yun lang.  As for me, after knowing BlueRep’s demanding commitment, I might replace it with a socio-civic org like ACIL. I still have until Monday to decide. Pero right now, it’s AMA, AJMA, and BlueRep (w/c I said I might drop).  SUPER FRUSTRATED AKO GUYS! A week ago, bigla kong nafeel ang urge na parang gusto kong magSanggu, and be the batch president sana. And when I ask my friends naman, sabi nila, go fo it daw. Ako naman, I have my fears lang. I’ll be honest natatakot akong matalo. Haha! Tao lang. Baka super hirap makakuha ng guy votes. Alam mo naman, when they encounter a candidate like me, there are those who become close-minded and easily votes for the other candidate. As long as it ain’t me. How sad. Haha pero ayun. Nakakafrustrate lang. Parang it’s so hard to take the risk. Pero feeling ko naman if I do get the spot, I’ll devote myself into it eh.. Owell let’s see how things turn out. Nagguilty ngako eh. If ever I don’t run, I can always tell Erick that. Sayang naman. He might have a bigger chance for the position. HAY! Dizizit! Super thanks lang to ALL my friends. As in todo support kahit wala pa nga haha. Don’t worry. If ever I run, and don’t win, MASAYA NAKO AS LONG AS I GET YOUR VOTES. KAHIT NGA KAYO LANG ANG BUMOTO SAKIN, feeling ko winner nako. Ewan ko. For me, that matters most.  ¤ I remember a song that we use to sing in Jubilee Christian Academy, my gradeschool. It goes something like…  This is the day / This is the day that the Lord has made / that the Lord has made / We will rejoice / We will rejoice / And be glad in it / and be glad in it / ‘Cos this is the day that the Lord has made / We will rejoice and be glad in it / This is the day / This is the day that the Lord / has / maaaaaaaaaaaaaade.  …with matching actions pa yan ha guys. Haha! Wala lang. Napaisip lang ako kasi I spoke with my good old friend Nicole Young (DLSU-CSB Multimedia Arts) sa YM. And it always feels good to chat with her. Kasi parang after more than four years, feeling ko close pa rin kami. And it dawned on me na iba talaga pag naginvest ang isang tao sa friendships. Yan ang maganda capital mo: the RELATIONSHIPS you have with your friends most especially. Kasi after all these years, I still have Nicole and some JCA friends and my AHS friends… grabehan na. I really love the company of my friends, whether old or newfound friends man. Mahal ko kayo sobra. Kayo ang nagpapatotoo na  this really is the day that the Lord has made. Well to be honest, araw-araw naman eh.  ¤
