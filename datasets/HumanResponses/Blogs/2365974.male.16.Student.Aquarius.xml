       it was a bit dim and empty inside the bar during that evening. i sat by the barkeep's counter as he pours me another round of whiskey.  "another of those nights, eh?" he asked nonchalantly as he pours the liquor to my glass. i nodded as a sign of confirmation to his suspects. yes, it was indeed one of those nights. work had been a mess, my beloved has once more ran off with another love. it always seemed to be the doom of all for me in the beginning. i always found myself wasting away in this same bar each and everytime i came from a tussle.  "aye, three years it has been, young lad. still down with that dryspell of yours, i see," he picks up his stool and places it near me. pats me on the back as i took in the water of my salvation. the drink that was the temporary remedy to my melancholy. my folly. and my pain.  "pain walks hand in hand with pleasure, young man. you have to accept pain as if it never hurt you. take it from me. been there, done that."  time and time again, that bartender put up against my rants. as well as the whines of all the other drunkards that would care to share their tale. yet, i realized, if everyone has their story, what was the story of the barkeep? does he wear a mask to block out all his pain? what happened to him that he has all these knowledge?  surely, not all knew the enigma that sorrounded the bartender. not all knew his tale.   moreover..  maybe no one knew at all..    i just pictured that thing in my head as i was typing.. gahh, i'm not as motivated as before to write. i know im near to another alternative source of motivation. but i'm scared to use it as my inspiration. well, its a risk.

      Must of been mid afternoon I could tell by how far the child's shadow stretched out and He walked with a purpose In his sneakers, down the street He had, many questions Like children often do He said, Tell me all your thoughts on God? Tell me am I very far?  Must of been late afternoon On our way the sun broke free of the clouds We count only blue cars Skip the cracks, in the street And ask many questions Like children often do We said, Tell me all your thoughts on God? 'Cause I would really like to meet her. And ask her why we're who we are. Tell me all your thoughts on God, Cause I am on my way to see her. So tell me am I very far  Am I very far now?  Its getting cold picked up the pace How our shoes make hard noises in this place Our clothes are stained We pass many, cross eyed people And ask many questions Like children often do  Tell me all your thoughts on God? 'Cause I would really like to meet her. And ask her why we're who we are. Tell me all your thoughts on God? 'Cause I am on my way to see her. So tell me am I very far? Am I very far now?  -counting blue cars, dishwalla

      love.   why do people have to mind it so much?  they say it's the only word that can make the world spin a different direction. or can turn the tides of the winds differently.  well, as merc likes to say,  love is overrated.  overrated? yes. overused? perhaps.   but still, i keep asking myself? do i know what love is?  i don't know.  love comes in different forms i guess. like a gummy bear comming in with different colors. each color represents a different taste, but its still yummy and sweet all the same. like so, love comes in many forms, and they are intended differently, but they all make you feel...  "loved"

(mio!)   must have.

      i really can't understand why people tend to get intimidated when they're being looked in the eye while conversing. its better that way actually. after all, eyes are the windows to one's soul. right.  but still.  i for one, like eyes. i like to look at peoples eyes when i talk to them. you get more sucked-in to them while staring at them. driving you crazy not to break your gaze. like a pair of black pearls shining genuinely. asn if you stare good enough, you'll manage to make up figures from one's eyes.   i'm obviously babbling incoherent stuff right now. *the frustration*  headaches.  puevagreveni.

      sometimes, i hate being at home. i can't think straight. a lot of things had been clogged in my head for staying inside the four wall of our abode too long. its really chaotic once you've thought about it. and its a bit disturbing as well.   i feel alone when i'm at home. maybe its because of the age gap between my brothers. its hard being the youngest. but i don't have any qualms about it. its fun being the youngest as well. its just that, they seem so distant. and i can't reach them sometimes. its like they're in a different plane- a different state of mind. they're way more mature than i am. they have problems to worry, jobs to attend and salaries to earn. on the other hand, i have time to slack, homeworks to study, school to attend, and friends to hang-out with.  most of the time, i'm by myself here alone. and my companion would be the trusty pc, bogart and bryanne. the two dogs we have. nice huh? there isn't much to read here in the house since its mostly in my sister's room. which is off-limits for me.  for once, i really want to spend more time with people the same as my age. all my life i've been sorrounded by people older than me. i'm the youngest for crying out loud! and i was a house-boy before. well, until i was 5 though, when i would go out every afternoon to play with the neighbors. haha those were the days, alright.   i wish life could that be care-free.  but now, the principle of action-reaction really eats you alive. and it can really drive you nuts. the older you get, the more you worry about things. the more you get consious on how you look. the more you get aware on how you socialize with people. why, for once, can't we just forget all those stuff? i mean, some people tend to become other people just to try and please other people. truthfully though, you can't please the whole world.   its just simply impossible.  ack. there i am again with those things relating to possibilty and impossibility.

      today was really fun. i would like to quote mio's line when i asked him "i spent the day with real people." yep. thats the right way to put it.   i actually cut classes and i was happy i did. haha it was worth the trouble, anyway. even running along katipunan ave. while raining hard was a totally new experience now. -yes i've done that before, but this time it was more fun.   my head throbs and my mind is in chaos. i dont know what to think though. maybe hanging-out in cloud 9 too long isn't too good for you. haha oh well

      wow. i can't believe that i woke up. hahaha (it's a miracle!)  i'll be leaving in an hour and a half's time for katipunan. yep. i'm going to ateneo early. for some reason, it's the first time i've woken up without wanting to sleep back again... -it must be the side-effect of joe satriani's song. mann, i'm very addicted to that one. (thanks mio!!!)  i'll be back in a while. i'll just cook myself breakfast. hmmm. i wonder what's in the kitchen... lemme see.... GHOSTS!!! @_@ wahahaha  later.

      shit. mio just gave me a song that really rocked! my dico (erwin) had a cassette of this song and i got to listen to it years back. its called  always with you, always with me - joe satriani .  that song is the first instrumental rock song i've heard. and it's really nice to listen to. its not too dramatic, not too romantic. its just right. shiet. it can make you sigh if you feel for the song. wheeeeeeee. like cloud 9. wahahaha  oh well...  i'll add something later... i can't put the words correctly right now..

      sometimes, it pains me to be back in ateneo during summer... it reminds me of the thing that used to mean a lot to me before. something that i used to give tremendous importance before. yes. after 3 years, i can now say it was really my fault to begin with that i'm not in ateneo anymore.  back then, i still didn't have my priorities straight. i was so carefree. i lived life without rules. without restraint. i followed my fun-loving heart too much. i'm not implying that its wrong to follow what your heart beats. but following it too much might blind you to logic. and that's important in this world.  so i passed-out after 6th grade. i was on waver status when i entered it. i never did my assignments. i never studied for my tests. i started raising my voice to my parents. clearly, that wasn't what my heart wanted. like i said, people tend to get carried away with their feelings.  yeah. i fucked up. i thrashed my ultimate dream when i was young. i'd be terrified if i ever met my 6-year old self. somehow, i think i know what more or less our conversation will be.  he'd certainly ask me where i'm studying. and would probably send me crashing into shame.  oh life..  this sucks. now i out to put my head down and work. i dont want to screw up this time. i know that time and time again i've reiterated it that i'm going to do better the next year. but now i'm going to bleed every ounce of work i do. i want a better future. i don't want to lead a fucked up life.  its always never too late for anything..

      today was the sportsfest.even before we were to play 5 on 5 with the other sep classes, i twisted my ankle while playing basketball with ben, miggy, and jovick. haha stupid me. anyway, it wasn't that bad so i walked it off and played the games. we won the basketball games by the way. we are the champions! haha hell yeah! haha  after the sportsfest, i got to hang-out with ben and sabs. ben talked a lot about stuff, which was really entertaining. haha he left at around 6:10 when his ride came. sabs joined her friends as well, and so, i went for a stroll around ateneo.  first i walked with no place in mind to stop. i wasn't ready to go home just then. i reached the college covered courts then stopped. turned back. and walked again.  for some reason, i ended up standing infront of christ's statue; the entrance of the church of gesu. nobody was around except for the guard sitting in one of the chairs inside the church, so i went in. i really don't know what got into me, or what brought me there. the next thing i know, i was already sitting on one of the benches inside the church. funny, i felt quite guilty since i haven't attended a single mass for ages.  after a few minutes there, i strolled a bit more, and found my feet firmly planted on the grasses of the bellarmine field. (i don't know if it's double L or what) it felt wierd- being in there, its like im in a plane of some sort and all the other things orbiting around it move real fast. the cars that passed by seemed to blur before my eyes. i've been itching to do this since bell field has a really nice view when you look up. i think i ought to do this again.  haha. what a day.

      man! i've been missing out a lot! i haven't been able to blog in ages! and there's a lot to say! but i don't know where to start, though. oh well.  hmm..  elections was quite hectic. i managed to have a conversation with a friend about this topic. what would happen if there were no governments? no leaders to guide our so called "thriving nation"? hah, here's a better one: what would happen if the sanctimonious political thieves never existed? confusing isn't it?  man can never live without something guiding its path. man is somehow walking a path that is too dim to see with bare eyes. they need a torch; a guiding light to lead them on. they need a leader.  but, man is known to be not content with what they have, and in the process, wanting more, even at the cost of destroying their own dignity and integrity. -that's where corruption takes place.  before we talk about the leaders, we should talk about the one's that elect leaders to their positions. -the masses.  speaking of the masses, there is one certain profession that we all tend to leave out. the farmers.   you get my bearing?  get a hold of this:  people that live in the province, supposedly farmers, leave their simple-living lifestyle in the rural community in search of a better job in he city. once more, one of man's sickness is at work- the thirst for something better- something they don't have.  then, these farmers reach manila, only to find out that they're only qualified for jobs that are even lower than farming. which, sends their future on a crash course.  maybe all these people really wanted was more attention. more attention from the government to be exact. farmers are very vital to a nation's survival. therefore, they have to be treated with an apt amount of attention and importance.  now, lets work our way up.  presidents are leaders. leaders elected by the public to serve the public. the greates misconception about this is that, the people tend to take the president as some sort of  "miracle man" . -wake up, folks. time to go back to reality. the president is ONLY HUMAN. like all of us.  one individual cannot shoulder the burden of a million people. -yes a president is elected to serve the country, but he cannot do it alone. cooperation of the mass is needed to attain success. which means, the masses should work for prosperity as well.  ironic when i think of this, but- robert jaworski was right.  "ang bayan ay parang isang basketball team" . team work is needed if we want this country of ours to rise from the ashes.  no one can do it alone. but with the joined efforts of all the citizens, there will be no such thing as impossible.

      i feel like i can go on and on about summer mornings. i really like it. its so nice. its not like other mornings especially during school days. its so stressful during those times. you've got tons of schoolwork to worry about and lots of friends to bicker with. in a summer morning at home, you can sit on your comfy couch while wolfing down a bowl of cereals.  the atmosphere feels great during summer morning. its not too hot. its not too cold. its quite nice.  if i  still  lived in a village, i would've gone for a little run through the village with my dog or even just by myself. but sad to say, i now reside on a very cenjested area.

      this is going to be my temporary blog since my other one's still down. oh well.  as always, i've been allowed to think a lot due to the lack of extra-curricular activities. i really don't know what got into me, but suddenly, being under house-arrest suited me. something's wrong with me.  hmmm, time has passed. things have changed. tasted have been altered from bitter to sweet, and from sweet to sour. some other things don't appeal people anymore. for a certain reason, that is. im sorry if i'm not making sense. this is just my way of letting out how i feel and stuff. somehow, i'm afraid to live in my thoughts- they're quite disturbing if you'd ask me. and most probably, i'll die out of depression in there. haha.  sep was pleasant today. once more, i screwed up during the recitation. there's just something about math that doesn't make me feel at ease. i hate it. i want to lead a care-free life. yet, i keep on worrying about a lot of things. maybe i think too much. but sometimes it can't be helped. thinking is really important for me.  anyway.  i've stopped writing my "what if" story. the drive isn't there anymore. somehow, my so called "prowess" is really deteriorating by the moment. and i just had to call it quits. for now maybe. i need to fix myself first.  so, here i am, blogging my life away once more. trying to clear the uncertainties before me by writing down all my thoughts. well, not all of them.   well...  i think that's the reason. -but it's a bit shallow. god. i hope not.  will i last this time in third year? i do hope so. my work load will somehow increase. im really going to put my head down and work. as much as i don't want to, i'd have to act like a workaholic or something like that. i know obsessing myself with studying isnt' good. but, a year doesn't sound too much, right? i really want a nice school in college so i have to pull a trick out of my sleeve this year. chem, geom, and trig all at the same year. ack. good thing there's world history.   thank goodness.

EVER. damn. i seriously do not know how am i to deal with it since it is my responsibility as an officer.   stress, migrane, pressure all at the same time.  oh how lucky can you get in life.

      i wonder... if you could choose your own dream. what dream would you want?  i see myself standing in the middle of a very small room. it's a small 4-sided room with black and white tiles. there's no door. no window. i move towards one side of the wall, touches it, and notices the wall rippling as if you touched water. then the wall was no more. instead, you see people- walking down the street.  there are cars passing by. people walking, going about with their daily lives as they continue to walk and talk with their companions. sitting by the bus stop, reading the newspaper while taking a sip of their favorite coffee.  as i start to walk, it starts to rain. i stepped out of the room, everything stopped.  everything.  the rain paused in mid air. the people froze. the sounds comming from everywhere was gone.  i look around, wondering. what had caused all this? i stare in to the end of the street, and i see something so magnificent. something so resplendant in form.  it overwhelms me. taking over every inch of me. sorrounding me with warmth. my mind overflows with many images. images of my past. my childhood. my adventures. my toils. my happiness.  happiness  then you wake up. wanting to go back to sleep and dream some more.

      a lot of people are freaking out. hahaha palitan ang mood. eto, pero parang olats eh. anyway...   you, the great confidant. the robin to every batman, the satellite to every planet. you're a bright star shining behind the shadow of another. a great spectacle of magnificence dying to be discovered. a pandora's box of many great splendor. an outburst of life's beauty and infinite euphoria. a perfect replica of heaven down on earth. your eyes that invites one to peer through your windows and into your soul of innocence and purity. your voice as enticing as the song of nightingales. lips that leave a tease to it's beholder for a chance to kiss. a kiss that would kill; relieving one from all the bonds and burdens. a great enigma it is that no one cares to notice. that none dared to see through and beyond the lines and your flaws. a brilliant dancer waltzing away alone with little people who dared to watch. dancing the night away with every move your body makes that takes one's breath away. a pleasurable torment for a thief who would steal your heart. you can never be second to anyone. you're in a league of your own; dominating every aspect; a diva of many things.

      insanity  madness  the carnage a madman feels. all the hate in the world piling up. morethan what the heart could muster.  the craving.  the longing for blood to be spilled. for make rasputin tremble before the manic tortures he's never encountered before even after death.  death in the darkest way  death in the most wicked way  you who has broken the balance  you who has changed the push to a shove, shall feel what the ninth level of hell is all about. shall experience of torturing beyond death's bounderies.  an eternity of torment  an eternity of pain and suffering  as your maker rips the flesh of your mortal body  as he stips whatever's left on your spirit  you will bleed a river of blood  and the halls of heaven and hell will echo your screems  you will suffer.

      a knife.  an assassin.  a snake.  a filthy, guiltless creature that hides in the covers as a friend while you watch him with both your eyes.   a great preteder that blinds you from the pressing truth.  silent as the calm air. smooth as the flow of placid water. he makes his move among the sea of turned backs.  a traitor he is. leading you on and on.  beware.  i shall have my revenge.  you crossed the line.

        this is one of the most magnificent poems i've ever read... anyway, enjoy    Auguries of Innocence -William Blake  To see a world in a grain of sand, And a heaven in a wild flower, Hold infinity in the palm of your hand, And eternity in an hour.  A robin redbreast in a cage Puts all heaven in a rage.  A dove-house fill'd with doves and pigeons Shudders hell thro' all its regions. A dog starv'd at his master's gate Predicts the ruin of the state.  A horse misused upon the road Calls to heaven for human blood. Each outcry of the hunted hare A fibre from the brain does tear.  A skylark wounded in the wing, A cherubim does cease to sing. The game-cock clipt and arm'd for fight Does the rising sun affright.  Every wolf's and lion's howl Raises from hell a human soul.  The wild deer, wand'ring here and there, Keeps the human soul from care. The lamb misus'd breeds public strife, And yet forgives the butcher's knife.  The bat that flits at close of eve Has left the brain that won't believe. The owl that calls upon the night Speaks the unbeliever's fright.  He who shall hurt the little wren Shall never be belov'd by men. He who the ox to wrath has mov'd Shall never be by woman lov'd.  The wanton boy that kills the fly Shall feel the spider's enmity. He who torments the chafer's sprite Weaves a bower in endless night.  The caterpillar on the leaf Repeats to thee thy mother's grief. Kill not the moth nor butterfly, For the last judgement draweth nigh.  He who shall train the horse to war Shall never pass the polar bar. The beggar's dog and widow's cat, Feed them and thou wilt grow fat.  The gnat that sings his summer's song Poison gets from slander's tongue. The poison of the snake and newt Is the sweat of envy's foot.  The poison of the honey bee Is the artist's jealousy.  The prince's robes and beggar's rags Are toadstools on the miser's bags. A truth that's told with bad intent Beats all the lies you can invent.  It is right it should be so; Man was made for joy and woe; And when this we rightly know, Thro' the world we safely go.  Joy and woe are woven fine, A clothing for the soul divine. Under every grief and pine Runs a joy with silken twine.  The babe is more than swaddling bands; Every farmer understands. Every tear from every eye Becomes a babe in eternity;  This is caught by females bright, And return'd to its own delight. The bleat, the bark, bellow, and roar, Are waves that beat on heaven's shore.  The babe that weeps the rod beneath Writes revenge in realms of death. The beggar's rags, fluttering in air, Does to rags the heavens tear.  The soldier, arm'd with sword and gun, Palsied strikes the summer's sun. The poor man's farthing is worth more Than all the gold on Afric's shore.  One mite wrung from the lab'rer's hands Shall buy and sell the miser's lands; Or, if protected from on high, Does that whole nation sell and buy.  He who mocks the infant's faith Shall be mock'd in age and death. He who shall teach the child to doubt The rotting grave shall ne'er get out.  He who respects the infant's faith Triumphs over hell and death. The child's toys and the old man's reasons Are the fruits of the two seasons.  The questioner, who sits so sly, Shall never know how to reply. He who replies to words of doubt Doth put the light of knowledge out.  The strongest poison ever known Came from Caesar's laurel crown. Nought can deform the human race Like to the armour's iron brace.  When gold and gems adorn the plow, To peaceful arts shall envy bow. A riddle, or the cricket's cry, Is to doubt a fit reply.  The emmet's inch and eagle's mile Make lame philosophy to smile. He who doubts from what he sees Will ne'er believe, do what you please.  If the sun and moon should doubt, They'd immediately go out. To be in a passion you good may do, But no good if a passion is in you.  The whore and gambler, by the state Licensed, build that nation's fate. The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old England's winding-sheet.  The winner's shout, the loser's curse, Dance before dead England's hearse.  Every night and every morn Some to misery are born, Every morn and every night Some are born to sweet delight.  Some are born to sweet delight, Some are born to endless night.  We are led to believe a lie When we see not thro' the eye, Which was born in a night to perish in a night, When the soul slept in beams of light.  God appears, and God is light, To those poor souls who dwell in night; But does a human form display To those who dwell in realms of day.

      sometimes its too exhausting to write more entries. even if you wanted to, even if you force yourself, you just couldn't pull one good one out of your sleeves.  what a shame.

      wow, summer ended faster than i wanted it to end. much more, sep ended faster than i expected it. yes, i had fun this summer. it turned out pretty great. yeah, i met and got to know more a lot of great people this summer, there's merc, marla, ben, jovic, yeni, ralf, paul, and  ISSA!  (i'm so sorry i missed out!!!) grabe. i just wish everyday could be spent like those days. that's what makes summer so likeable maybe. life would be dull without friends.  lessons have been taught and learned this summer. not just inside the classroom, but on the outside as well. yes, there are important things that you'll can learn outside the classroom. there are some things that will be of more importance to those of the things you'll learn inside a classroom.  all those escapades, parties, hang-outs were some of the things that made summer very much enjoyable. yes, classes are out, but the things that made it better was the times spent with the people that means much to you- friends, to be exact. you don't really get to spend as much time as you want with them during the schoolyear.   aaaaaaaaaaaack. so much for that. school starts tomorrow! hahaha
