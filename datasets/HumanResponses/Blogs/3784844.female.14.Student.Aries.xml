      Music - Your So Last Summer ~ Taking Back Sunday  Hey I'm *bLeSs* and this is my new online journal.. I love these because when you can't rely on anyone, they're always here to listen to you and your typing.. just depends on how shitty you feel though.. being a teenager is tough shit.. I miss being a little kid... I'ma cry now..    OK heres what happened today... today was Caleb's birthday and i had ordered him balloons, you know like $40 dollars worth of balloons, but it didnt make me feel good like it should have.. it only made me miserable knowing I can't have him anymore. He's going out with JuLee, but I cstill can't accept it.. its so hard for me to.. I'm just tired of missing him, I want to be his girlfriend, not JuLee. He and I are perfect for eachother.. but thats the story of my life..     I really don't know anymore.. I have 3 friends.. including Caleb.. but he seems to not want to be my friend.. after all he and I have been through.. he makes me so mad!!!

        gawd... my mom won't let my boyfriend come and visit here... she thinks that he is too old and all he wants to do is rape me... if that was so, then WHY THE HELL would he tell me something like the time that his grandfather died... i love him so much, but i just cannot understand why my mom won't let him come here! i just want to lay down and cry for a long time... wow, i am depressed again... i thank god for the 26th to com sooner    music ~ Name - Goo Goo Dolls
