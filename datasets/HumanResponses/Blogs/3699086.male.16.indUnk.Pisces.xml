      I've got a really bum deal with two of my friends. I haven't seen one for awhile,  and we're really close. A "thing", I guess you could say. Well, there's this other person here who I'm into also. They both are into me, so...........HELP! Advice would be appreciated.

      Alot of people around here have been bugging me to hear this thing that I wrote. I don't know if it's supposed to be a song or what, but it's kinda cool, i guess. If you want to, go ahead and tell me what you think:  I need one thing to make this right,  To stop this never ending fight,   Between what I feel here in my heart,   And what my mind wants to impart.  I only need on little thing, but a wall stands in my way,  What I need I cannot have, not now or any day. I've tried so long to grasp it, but it still exceeds my reach,  If only it were closer, then they wouldn't have to preach,  That "It's not worth it, you'll never win,  All that's left is to quit. Give in." But I won't stop until it's mine,  This one last thing I have to find,  Because just one more thing remains,  To rid myself of depression's stains.  But they do not see that I need them now,  More than I ever have. And how? How could I ever make them see,  Make them once again believe,  That what I feel is true, no doubt, but then, why bother to try? Would it not be easier to hide my face, to turn away and cry? Why do I try, why do I strain,   For what I know I can't obtain? Why must I sacrifice myself this way,  When what I need just runs away? Perhaps it's true, what they all said, That all that's left is to turn my head Away from this foolhardy quest? To just take the whole thing off my chest? And now I see, they're right of course, and have been all along,  I don't need this grief, this torture,  or to write this unsung song.  I'll stop this foolish journey now, because what I finally see,   Is I don't need this childish feeling to be who I am to be.  I do not need this uncatchable dream,  Although my heart wanted to fool me, it seems,  Into believing that if I did not win, that I would lose a part That still has not been touched in me, deep inside my heart.      Well there you have it. There's another four lines at the end, but I have them all scratched out so I can't read them. But anyway......ya, hope you enjoyed it.

      I am a moron. I just admitted my feelings to her. Every time I do this, it always changes things. Even if they say it won't, it will. So maybe it's me. Maybe I'm the one who changes. You know, sometimes I just think, 'Is anything ever going to come easy for me? Is anything meant to be for me?' But apparently not. It looks like I'm just gonna have to figure everything out and work for everything I get on my own. Not that it hasn't always been this way. But with everything that's going on right now, I really notice it alot more. And it seems alot worse. I wish I could change my circumstances. I wish I could have my life laid out before, and all I'd have to do is just follow the directions. Unfortunately, things don't come so easy. But maybe it's a good thing. I'll probably value whatever I gain or lose a lot more because I'm working so hard for it. If I didn't,  I'd probably feel almost cheated when I reached the end. But that still doesn't make it any easier.

      Well, my  life sucks right now. I'm thinking of quitting the football team. I can easily be replaced, as I was shown at camp. It would actually work out pretty well, because then I could focus on cross country. Someone I thought I could get into a relationship with is now a no-go. A girl has a huuge crush on me, and I can't let her know that I know or that I return those feelings. My parents are really riding me, I just had a poem published, I'm getting academic acheivment letters from all over the place, and if I make choices and change things, people get hurt. Not including myself. That's the worst part. Is I'm sacrificing everyone else's feelings, and not mine. Whether I make choices or not, someone get's the short end of the straw. But never me. I never get shafted. I can only shaft other people. Which sucks. I should just quit it all. Everything. Just screw the world.
