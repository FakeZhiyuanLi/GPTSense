       american labor day blues   As part of being an employee of one of the pillars of amerihypocricy in the philippines, i am now forced to not work today because of the american holiday, one of the rarest holidays that i experienced since i worked for this company im in. So what did i do for my much needed vacation? I slept ate and farted all day long went here to type my story.

       COME ON RAIN IN MY PARADE  inde, joke lang!    i transfered house already! Finished the company website! ...but     i just spoke to a friend of mine wilbert and we discussed things about my virtual hand project. this is a project na virtual assistance start up company and as olay (he-bitch) as he is i took the chance to ask his honest opinion in the whole concept of things and we kinda had a heated debate on the matter. It was good that i asked him of all poeple dahil nagkaroon ng pagtatalunan ang utak ko. I know he hates me for being stupid as he stresses his points but again im not stupid, i shouldnt be stupid kasi galit ako sa mga stupid na tao diba pero kasi nachachallenge lang ako sa nangyaring to. But then again indi lang to ang rely ko sa buhay kaya kebs.   Just transfered to a house here in u.p. with my friend noel and it just struck me that in those times that i have lived independently away from my parents, its just now that i am scared. It's weird i never felt so scared and alone all my life. oh well. But then again i will get by as always.   Anyway im here on the internet shack because my housemate has something going on back there in the house and i dont want to listen to their thing and sink deeper into the feeling of being alone.

       one week wonder    One week wonder? nah my blog entry has got nothing to do with that. Just cant think of a title.   One week , one week one week of pure fickin shit from the office, a couple of gossip hungry folks, leeches and dirt accumulated mind spirit and body. Me and noel and went off to some shack to buy us some aromatheraphy kit for our house and later on we re heading off to st lukes for a check up coz i think we had our lungs chunked up with toxins due to the smell of fresh paint in the place were sleeping in. We have nio choice but to be absent again we cant force our selves to work in our condition. Noel had nose bleeding and i.....i just felt enundated with work that i had to rest .   And why wouldnt you feel enundated? employees like me in my company seem to loose what i feel naging reason ko in sticking despite of my so underpaid status, the fact that it was an open door policy in the office before and that we can stretch our earnings with commisions na ngayon ang hirap na ma achieve and take note they are slowly taking that away from us. i feel as though i am in a sweat shop. Consider this underpaid ka na, di ka na nga makakacommision, andami pang rules na nakakasakal whats next? i have to wear semi formal in the office????? take away the commision privelege???????? you have to smile even though u dont feel like it or else would be sanctioned??????? oh well fuck those strict floor rules the fuck with *BLEEP*. the fuck with em all. I started to send my applications to diff companies already. GlobalStride is draining me.   Oh well i have to gets my self henergayzd. I have to gather my strength monday. i have an interview in sykes asia at 2pm. And then i go straight ahead to libis for some hypocracy in action.

       PRESENTING THE LIBIDO RUSH SUPREME   i have created like a list of poeple (men in particular of course and some women ) that turned me on recently. i just want to share of course yung taste ko sa mga lalaki. Oh well...     Vaness Wu   Like his gigolo style. Sexiest chinese guy i have seen so far. I had local version crushes particularly one in our office who looks almost the same as this vaness wu. I liked him not because of f4, sorry. Well if it werent for f4 tho i didnt have sana the chance to see him. oh well.     Sean Paul    This Jamaican reggae sensation is the sexiest in his genre. Super cute stud. Sarap.      BRITNEY SPEARS AND BEYONCE KNOWLES   Its not that they both sport blonde hair its because of the fact that they are beautiful and graceful. If id be full pledged lesbian for a day i'd......  Im a fan of beyonce tho coz shes got that singin style. Britney only got the moves and the cheeky songs. No offense i also love britney but i hate her voice.

       OCTOBER FEST  San Miguel held its annual october fest happenin in wherever place in the -phils na masikip mainit at malupit. Kick off is eastwood, soooo traffic to the office was haggard. It has been a happening day as observed by a lot of my friends and i do not even know why on earth would i enjoy such event when it isnt christmas and new year and there are a lot of sweaty bodies bouncing around. suffice to say, eastwood became one big stinking overcrowded pit. Sabi nga ni urlLink  Vera    "World youth day revisited"       Its so stupid for san miguel to hold this event in a place where the road is like 5 meters wide and a place that is not even a big 2 hectare (well its not as big as the fort) considering that there are a lot of poeple who wanted to take part of the action.  And so i also took the oppurtunity to meet my long lost friends in the event since im sure they wouldnt miss a peice of the action,( but hello, the only action that i am aware of is that theres a roll back in beer prices that night.) And I thank god that they werent in diff places in eastwood or ill die in suffocation, thank god they were all in dencios in diff groups.  Took my one hour to drink with them and catch up with whatever. My one hour break didnt go to waste for I had the opportunity to be introduced with my and noels crush, Jose, from I-touch.   And how long did it take me to reach the office? 1 hour with all that 8 lane traffic. I even saw Derrick H beside my taxi but decided not to show my face to him dahil baka di na ako makapasok ng opisina. Gino was also there but he was at grilla and im not gonna walk that far duh. The office was a desserted ground partly bec. of the traffic and partly because they partied instead.    And after 3 days of calling i finally had a 300 peso commission.   Today I have a doctors appointment at 3:30, A meeting with Ginger for her photoshoots and a beer binge for sure in carlo's place what better time will it be but 9pm. I hope that the Acropolis Residents won't mind us partying like hell today.

It aint easy giving a lengthy survey with millions of picklist (exxag)Who the fuck isnt excited about Network World, they promised money. Ehehheheheh.

       AHOY NETWORK WORLD   We were briefed by The Lit Onrubia yesterday in preparation for this promises of good commisions. This will kick off wednesday.  Wish  Hope  from 8=11  lemme just share a good one from The Rodney Lim taken from the Friendster testimonial of global stride:   "Requiem for a friend. --Once upon a time, there was a dream --two jabronis wanting to give quality service, --despite of prospects that are slim --the two continued with no one to please. --they started a company called Webservasia -- young people believed in that dream --from every nook and cranny, it started a mania --a place to belong, to be part of a team. -- It was truly a rough beginning --they have to start from scratch -- bad phone lines, few clients, no data base is not the only thing, --nobody gave them diddly squat. --Yet they persevere and won't take defeat --together they made the company grow --despite all odds, they achieve their feat -- as one of the call centers on the go --Despite payroll problems, people sacrificed. --Inspiration, grit, and dedication --it is a wonder to the wise, --underpaid and all, they still go on. --From Webservasia, it became Globalstride --where everyone is an asset, a treasure --where environment is a source of pride, --our grit and a swagger our true measure. But alas Change is inevitable, Came from the CFO, that is verifiable Everybody want a piece of the action It started a web of deception Now there is a new regimen Gone are my friends, honorable men, Here are people of change and they disclose, That Globalstride, my Disneyland is Close.  "   ----------------------------  Today I am here in sm megamall waiting for my cell. Mainit sa bahay kaya andito ako no. Hindi ako makahinga sa init. Shet malapit na mag all souls day. Went to the laundromat for some wishy washing, so glad to find out they have delivery. All sikatuna folks, presenting GAME LAUNDRY! hahanapin talaga nila ang address mo. Eh goodluck sa bahay namin ni noel, sa sulok sya ng mundo. har har har.  -----------------------------  How i just love my locker at the office. i have put a lot of stuff for emergency purposes, emergencies such as this. May wardrobe na ko sa office saya. all i have to do is go straight to that mudapaking opis. Kebs ako sa mga tao dun.  -------------------------------  Hindi na pala ako mag reresign. Sayang. raraket na lang ako outside.

      Today absent TL ko. Tapos syempre as usual panget yung account. Yung pagkain pininyahang manok na may pagka curry. 4 na lang di pa ko kumota. Nag plano kami ni ginpao ng inuman sa sabado, sa aming humble shack, im sure larry and paul are gonna be there. Harsh eh yung mga kaibigan naming pupunta, puro lalaki walang babae, ako lang. Mukhang masaya to. Mukhang susuko nanaman ako ke paul pag dating sa inuman. Mukhang sira nanaman diet ko. Mukhang mula hanggang gabi nanaman ito hanggang umaga. Maaya nga si vera.  Nakakatawa...hahahaha...wala lang. Gusto ko namang tumawa, kasi inaantok na ako. 7:39 am na, gising pa ako.  Nagbasa ako ng  urlLink Bulgar  at me nagpakamatay pala sa sm manila. Taga mapua.Hard. Dahil siguro ito sa pressure ng magulang. Basta ako nung na pressure ako ng magulang ko, lumayas ako. Suwail, pero dun ako mabubuhay eh. Ayokong mamatay. I Love life, i want to live. i exist to live and give life. Though there are a lot of instances that i thought of ending my life, but realized that its not worth it. I am the child of the universe, sabi nga naman ni max ehrmann, (to quote from his obra, The Disederata") and i deserve to be happy. I may not find the happiness that i am looking for from my family members, i'll look for it someplace else first in order to continue to live and live my dream. And what is my dream? To be happy and contented with myself regardless of what i become in the years to come. To be able to smile and say that i am truly a survivor and that I can give love to other poeple because I have loved myself enough to spread it. Labo, antok na ko.  Nag asses kami ni noel kanina before going to the office tungkol sa pag titiwala sa tao, and i remembered a certain individual who became one of the factors kung bakit ako nagkatrauma in terms of pagtitiwala. Ang nasabi ko na lang sa dami ba naman ng tumarantado sa akin di ba naman ako matututo. And after that was a good and honest laugh, that i have indeed learned from the things ive been lacking before.   Ngayong oras na to, nag iisip na ko kung ano ang susuotin ko mamaya sa office. Goodluck sa lalagyan ko ng damit, makalat nanaman ito mamaya.  Syempre at ang picture of the day, kakalimutan ko ba? mamaya na lang tamad ako maghanap

      So nagkita na kami ulit ng mga pinsan ko. Masaya naman, makulit sila happy poeple. We talked about stuff like our demented family members. Had lunch in makati strolled around. Before that i bought shirts in ghills. and after that i went to sm city to buy me some cosmetics.  Tired, weary dead hungry here.  Work ulit bukas, sucks.        Price: 13,800 DOLLARS      PUTANGENANG RELOS YAN

       Thank God Its Friday!   Thank gawd its friday, the most precious day of every working mans life. I succumbed the hardships of midshift, the breakouts, the hard days night and such, it w as oktoberfest again yesterday. Drank a couple of beers and im not drunk.   ____________________________________________________________  Today is the day that i play  the Lets Pretend  Game. And we'll see how it works. The Rules are I rule you follow, I tell you what to do you will listen. Well I hope it doesnt work like that.   This is exciting marie. Its adventure. Call an ambulance for trouble. If theres an emergency call 116. ehehehhe. ____________________________________________________________  I cant believe how strong I am in the drinking arena, all of my drinkmates are down (and all of them men) and I am still the last girl standing. Its like dextrose ko na sya, araw araw akong umiinom ng grabe nung nagmid shift kami. Pero ayos lang me natutunan nanaman ako....Kung pano mawala ang hangover kahit galon galon nang beer ang nainom mo, ke matapang yan o ano...  KOWLOON WANTON NOODLES

       MID SHIFT BLUES   I hate this midshift thing. Breakouts alert. And plus I cant sleep a whole fucken lot. Busy tones ringin in my ears and i wanted to stab those americans for imposing so much without improving the lines. Change as the ceo put it in the bulletin board isnt the change that that he should start on first. Change should be in the muda fukin phone lines. Better the phone lines first before you impose more stressfull fuckenshits. Dont you know that Fast Busy Lines for one whole hour can be mentally damaging. Good thing kinakabit ko yung plantronics sa discman para nde ako ma siraan ng bait.   Oh well.

       Back to Malate: The night of the balls   Went to malate last saturday, have a date with my cousins so i tagged noel along. It was Teaz night at bargo courtesy of Addict mobile and Deepa was one of the teaz patrol. It was all fun fun and then there were mini contests, a girl won for herself a brandnew erricson fone by just "picking the mannequins balls"(har har har). I shouldve came up there and gave my self a chance to pick balls, bwehehehe ( like alvin's balls for example, one of deepas friends there.)  It was suppose to be a getaway sans office entities but i saw Freaky Ricky wandering around the Gay'ol Nakpil Orosa sts. Me and geeta talked about boys, how insane they are, what they want and how to read their minds. And soon got tired of it , we just gurgled our san migs away till 3 am. Deepa never returned so geeta went home and me and noel stayed in the streets..ehehehhe.. I met some of his gay friends and ate squid fuckin expensive balls.   Geeta set me up with this gerald. He just texted last night but i was mighty tired and my body aches so i apologized for the delay of the answers and told him i would gladly text him back tomorrow. i hope he's nice and not an asshole. I have a lengthy list of assholes in my book, i dont want to add more names on it. oh well.  Its 5 am . We slept yesterday 4pm and woke up 1pm. Now I have a mid shift which is 2pm later to think about. Now How Am I gonna survive? ........................     PEABERRY COFFEE

       ROW 4  It is the most favored area in the floor, the row four, there you can sleep without thinking about meeting quotas, sit around listen to your cd playa, dicuss everything music with wonderboy from carlitas way (forgot the name though, he's Mr. Cool). Its good to add him in my drinking buddy list, every single conversation ends up with a good discussion plus he's a very well rounded fella when it comes to music. I also like his style he wears that old grandpa slick black and white shoes (kinda shoes that a black chuchman with wear) And a cool No Doubt Shirt that caught my eye, actually thats how we first met, I saw him wear that neat shirt and introduced my self, ever since, he started to give me sample cd's that I appreciate. rarely do i see somebody who knows my language.  As usual, lunch time is Cable Car time. As usual with my drinking buddy jet, now with noel kay and mj. Shet 3 San Mig Super Dry in 30 minutes. The best talaga yung tokwat baboy nila dun. Hinain pa lang sa table, wala pang 1.5 minutes ubos na. As they say in tokwat baboy, its all in the suka. this time i used the visa electron and na realize ko na ansarap nya palang gamitin, kinda plastic money but better.  I went home early slept early and had a 2 hour cellphone chatting with gerald. the guys so neat, a multitasker, he was talking to me whilst driving his car.   Got to get myself ready, i have a meeting with eggie at 7. i wonder how that guy is now.

       DAZED AND CONFUSED...not?   I was amazed how friendster can connect me with my friends from long ago. Even connected me with some of my busmates and schoolmates back in prep and grade school. I was happy to see faces of poeple whom i known for such a long period of time na, almost forgotten now back again in friendster. It was so cool that SHS (School of the Holy Spirit has a friendster that could connect me to a lot of my shsian classmates and friends.   I went to the office with a very low mood. The office seemed annoying, with all those holloween decorations and those illusions of hunted houses from shake rattle and roll movies and pumpkins allover...nakaklito tapos may christmas tree...ano ba talaga kuya???  ehehehhe. the funniest was the billboard with the jujitsu karatedo thingie on it. (MAN WHAT RELEVANCE, U SHOULD SEE IT, its mighty funny)   It was hard for me to decide on something work related. But later in the morning I have come up with the decision of trying till next year. Im going to still stay in my company. Only now I know that there are a lot of opportunities where i could go wherever and  i can just give them a call, straight up, just ready when they I am. I drank lunch time, after which worked drunk thereafter and still with my drinking partner, Jet.  Na sad naman ako, bakit naman ganun na lang ang relevance ng buhay ko these days... inom inom abuso ng katawan. Nakakalungkot isipin na di ako makagalaw ng ayos pag sober ako. Am I an alcoholic? Well I hope Im not. Am I running away from something that i am so mighty scared of? Oh Well.  When can I find a friend or if anybody who will be strong enough to understand me. Seems like nobody was ever born yet to tame the beast in me?Feeling ko my life is an everyday struggle, I have to think of living as my sole purpose in life even if i feel as though as im dead. I felt I died years ago...I am just a walking matter. I have been numbed i swear, so numb..i cry with no apparent reason to feel human. I mean my future is clear, I see success, but i dont see happiness.   Daming tanong...its one of em limbo patrum days. Millions of years ng di nasasagot.  Malapit ng mag christmas...gawd ano yun? thats not even my favorite time of year.  Gusto ko yung summer....beach fatale. Oh well.

       Hey hey hey Monday  Ftresh start, new day. My head aches from over sleep. I indulged my body with rest the whole sunday till monday morning. I woke up from a palabok craving and ran forth the nearest palabok store. ( oh yes they serve palabok here in the mornings). Prepped my self up for another endeavor. Finished business up and stayed in starbucks where i saw the training manager Mr. Nayona, then window shoped for shoes. I saw this cool nine west pumps for sale 3, +++ php 30 % off and was a great deal. I am now contemplating into rewarding my self with thy pumps... but noooo, i have no money, i am a pauper i could only dream about it for now.    o eto kaya?      I am so inluuuuuuuuuuuv with it lord.

      yesterday i drank alone and i was so fuckin drunk that i went straight to bed and slept until 4 am. woke up and ate and then slept again until 6pm. I was supposed to go to the oktoberfest but decided to go to the office instead.   Lunch break we went to jacks loft for some drinks and went over break again in the condition that we give our Team lead six completes.   Back here in our stations we were listening like mad on the online radio stations available. There are only 8 poeple left in our team from the original 13 poeple.

I think i want to be absent tommorrow and rest the whole day. I am sick my head aches terribly and i have a nasal problem so bad that it affects my brain. I have been sneezing terribly also.

      Today is monday, suppossedly me class ako, i had a nasty hangover and a dysmenoreah so bad i couldnt get up. I decided to just go in tomorrow. Thats business math and english 101b that i am missing. But heck i dont fickin care.  Anyway i had a very good discussion with gerald, a friend of mine over the phone about silly girls and boys. Why silly girls drop their silly guys like a hot potato, the concept of love and all. Honestly for me i am not taking these seriously, love and how other poeple percieve it. Basta ako I have so much love to give to everybody. I am ms. friendly. Noel and I thought of it as the safest thing towards the opposite sex. And that is the way that i am most comfortable with.  I have been so very single for 3 years already and enjoying it. And yeah siguro im a scared fart that i wanted to keep every guy a friend. Pero masaya naman ako eh. Tama nga naman si gerald you can get sex by charm and paying for it pero hindi sya human. Nacocompensate nya lang yung times na feeling mo nagiisa ka at kelangan mo ng pisikalan. Its so nice to hear from a lot of guys tungkol sa honest opinions nila about women and their feelings. Yun nga lang nahihirapan ako mag guage ng lalaki para sakin dahil na ooverwhelm ako sa mga information na binibigay sakin mismo ng  mga opposite sex. Lagi na lang ako natatakot dahil babae ako. Would it be easier for me if i was one of them? ehehhehe. If i was indeed gay?   Hay nay, excited na ako later.

      So much happened in a week. Andaming nagtatanong. A lot of things happened, the team calibrated for the enth time with still the same reasons and same shit. there were allegations and there were admittance and there are a lot of thingsthat all boiled down to greed, selfishness and self worth but sadly di dapat ganun coz and to all those unanswered questions, this is the truth.   we are a team  we couldve been the best team  but there was avarice  and a lot of deep seeded hate  and stupid lies  and a deliberate display of bad human politics    And now i feel relieved, im going to be transferred to another team.

Twas nice to meet other poeple again. Best of the best, marty's supa cheap! we were drinking up our guts and eating at the same time and man the bill was ultra cheap.  best place for manic depression, go to marty's thats in paranaque, read it QC folks, drink cheap go to marty's paranaque!

      And so we went to mega mall, wala pa palang palabas na  urlLink star runner . larry arrived late and the guys had no money so they cant go. And we went to powerbooks in our geek mode checked out some books and read the guiness 2004, sat in the childrens corner and read some childrens books. There are a lot of crap now in filipino childrens shit..geez.  And then i tagged him around for some window shopping until i finally bought another toy for my kiddie bro. After that tho we went to UP , sarahs in particular and had our night cap  (5 bottles of beer eh? night cap?)  we bought this cool  iskul bukul soundtrack  to work us up while drinking and what pretty damn good cd it was. VST and co. har har har.  Shifting topics you know how i feel about a particular guy? I feel very angry..u know why? I decided to make him a letter here lang of course.

      Came from the mall watched scary movie 3, bought a big truck rc for my kid bro (it is so god damn fuckin big for that foo i tell ya drained my wallet down there.) then went off to buy my outfit for the xmas party got this neat cashmere backless blouse from tan gan ill post pics of me on it, damn it was beautiful and i can say im proud to be a fat kid wearing some backles shit on saturday... merry christmas and enjoy your new year for my new year will be great fro i vowed not to drink and smoke anymore stay healthy, exercise......(HOPE),  its a few years before i turn 30 and hell i dont want to be like the other folks suffering from after effects of their party days back then. i can feel my back aching due to cold weather and i am scared of arthritis(tama ba? boiinnnk).....aargh darn too much worry of the future..   i had a bad dream a while ago...theres this certain guy, i saw him and my skin, as in the totality of it started cracking and binabalatan ko daw yung sarili ko. scariest dream so far. It was like an event tapos we were both i the same place. and then the feeling habang napapanigipan ko sya was weird. So weird na di ko maexpress, pati yung dream di ko ma palaiwanag dahil it was too serious and intense..nakkks. lol  I have been currently making testimonials for my friendsters. i hope they like what i write about them...thats the nicest thing i can ever do to them friends of mine see, making testimonials. ehehehhehe.  Testimonials in my friendster are funny, a lot of them post about my stupidity, how i drink laugh and some of them arent even the closest friends that i got but its quite nice for your dimples tho, hearing somethings said as to how they see me or so...ehehhehe.  haaay.

      yesterday after a mild hangover, i went off to ghills for some window shopping and some small shopping of course. from 11 am to 6:30 ive been walking around ghills like crazy, i texted larry to accompany me. and when he went we walked to city center sizzling ztop and of course drank again, ehehhe, whats new? thats how we bond eh..ehehhe. Tangina nag iinarte pa si elton kung di nga lang namin niloko na kunwari bday ko hindi sya pupunta. so we were complete attendance again. now in sizzling stop ghills. me larry elton gino and paul together with geeta and chona. I decided to leave early because i was so so tired.   I have always wondered why sizzling stop decided to name trheir place sizzling stop, is it because they wanted to mock whistlestop or something, ehehehhe...corny. The fucken place is so 24 hrs, 20 pesos lang ang beer tapos okay pa yung lugar.  wala lang yun lang. I roamed around for some tungsten w sighting, and shet wala po akong nakita.

      Viewing you in an eye level with a rush o blood to posses Have a taste of your blood without giving in to your sex In just a painful bite in the groin I come undone and thus this poem of sweet rendezvous and unlightened rooms Confined in a box of hate rejection and  gloom We are forbidden to touch each others necks For in this game in that way we should be surviving  I have long protected my spirit  To succumb in your inviting And as you remind me of empty  I will be that quick defensive me A peculiar predator, with an interesting ploy In an elevator rush the safest thing to enjoy

      have been days again since i last blogd. been quite busy the past few days. We already bought a tv and a vcd player and have been quite inside the house lang but heck twas fun. I already bought li'l xmas gifts.   And i already saw gerald , we met up like several days ago, and found him to be neat and cool. I still have a vague memory of his face but all i remember is that he had a mole in the middle of his lower lip. weird.  anyway i succeeded in wearing the backless shit they said it was nice. I just need to see the pictures. and ima post if its nice to look at of course.   Im in a mood for sheer poetry...this is scary. I ve written 2 poems in a day.

      I am in a daze. I was forcing my self not to listen to my heart but now its screaming and cant play numb about it. Again i am realizing that I am in deep shit over the love feeling which i shouldnt be having. its so hard to realize that your logic is no longer governing you that you want to scream and eat a lot sheesh. here I am again, one way love, so hooked to the feling that wil lead you to rejection..hahhah.  it happened in a lot of circumstances, i scream love and then one way or another it leads to rejection. Is it because im a looser or they are the loosers? But ,man what the fuck it happened a couple of times  and the hard hit mamal was me. Dang. Coz see i have this penchant for pushing my self  to the poeple that I LOVE and hating the poeple who love me. Its funny when i get it on with the guy, i am no lady about it and in that end i am so looser, but something in me cant help it. So here i am thinking of withdrawing going away again.   I am so thinking of not talking to him again and not making an effort to try and get to talk to him. Its not that i want him to miss me, its just that i want to forget this ish.Maybe I will talk to him as soon as I get over it. YEAH! ILL GET OVER IT, AS ALWAYS.  Im so sorry i have to do this everything is good now but here i am making an effort in ruining it for our friendship. He doesnt like me, i can tell, i think he s just forced to like me because im nice and im cute and im funny but not what he wanted, pretty, simple  small boobies and reserved, doesnt go out drinking like me i mean if you are a guy, would you like a girl like me, a lesbian in denial thing , who drinks a whole fuckin lot, fat, bitch, smokes a lot, has no girl friends, whos with boys a lot of times goes out as she pleases, but i dont want to change that just to get somebody for me, damn thats pathetic. I may look like i dont take shit from everybody but man i am the most vulnerable, gullible person in the whole wide world, and i have so much love to give, its so funny that nobody wanted it. sheesh.

      I made a testimonial for one of the high schools that ive been in:  Now this is the most totally rockin school in the planet. i miss those bad ass days of mine here in gentle, miss my batch mates way back 96. I only been here like 3 years but man that was the raddest 3 years of my life. Even though its a bad ass school I am very thankful that they maximized my potentials. Poeple convinced me here that i am smart and that i shouldnt take shit from everybody (even my goddang teachers i swear) I miss those days when mr aguirre would lash us with meter sticks, get us locked up in the cat room (that looked like prison sh*t) and my totally rockin high school life. The battle of the bands, the quiz bee, the debates, the sampaloc tree, the singing contest, the cmli sh*ts, my first broken heart, the classroom smoking, the cutting classes (me jumping over the gate, hows that?)the cat fights everything about gentle that would make me want to come back to high school again. the high school life just like in some crappy movie, the gentle shepherd life! Cheers to us who succumbed to the wrath of palasigue, corpuz, reyes, napal, gabao and most especially the basa's, This school is the best school i was at and youve been at. looking forward to an alumni homecoming. ehehhehe.

      when you say its okay how come the other  party thinks that i am angry.   when its perfectly fine. thats your prerog and i cant do anything about it. to each its own, i am not like them who wouldnt understand the bits in peices of your flaws, i have come to like you for that. You arent ashamed of admitting your flaws and you are real. Real as any man can be. And that makes you so very beautiful and i can see through. so dont make a fuss its no biggie. Thats okay. Good nite and have a good sleep. :D

Partey to the max man, and damn i lost interest sa mga lalaki sa paligid, even the neatest looking guys kagabi, all i see are walking dicks but, still i didnt resist calling the man, im addicted to dial the phone and call and talk...and every after conversation makes me crazy.

      i never shouted this out loud before but...... MANNNNN I LOVE GIRL POWER!!!!!!!!!  you know i made this silly poem over some silly feeling that i had in those very silly days that u dont want to see my pimple infested face man..ahahhaha   DODEMODE-IS-OVER  My world is now going round- a- circle  and it spins a fast jupiter rotation with one sly shy smile of your round eyes  and a tiny full moon on your luscious corn and it so worries me so about one thing that I know That  its too preposterous to loose this bag of vice that I have Yeah youre dueces are wild,  but ive got other things on my mind Its not an easy task to undergo For I spent so many years focusing on lucidity That I dont want to loose control And The steady hand that rocks my heart  is nt music to whom they call free Say I need to cast a doubt about saying I  belong to just me, me me me Yes its true, that my worlds sets on crumbling without you And you see, now is too never late for what i feel So Ill let you slip away.   :D

      Fade Into You - By Mazzy Star From the album "So Tonight That I Might See"  I want to hold the hand inside you I want to take a breath that's true I look to you and I see nothing I look to you to see the truth You live your life  You go in shadows You'll come apart and you'll go black  Some kind of night into your darkness  Colors your eyes with what's not there.   Fade into you Strange you never knew Fade into you I think it's strange you never knew  A stranger's light comes on slowly A stranger's heart without a home You put your hands into your head And then smiles cover your heart  Fade into you Strange you never knew Fade into you I think it's strange you never knew  Fade into you Strange you never knew Fade into you I think it's strange you never knew I think it's strange you never knew

      the year that was..2003  man so much happened. First up, this year marked my professional maturitymeaning i happened to be luckily stuck in a company for a year or so working the same shit without getting bored. And a year of a love hate relationship between my parents and the realization of full independence, meaning i learned to shut down my heart for a while and make do of whats existent and what would make me live. It was also the year of  urlLink friendster  where i saw a couple of long lost friends and foes and ex loves ahahahaha.   well this year again, i had no love life. But what the heck, it saved me from head ache actually

      weekend get away  I went to Lucban Quezon for some weekend getaway and went to the mountains and saw imelda falls and man the view was so friggin awesome. I travelled with janjie and sang wildly every song we can think of as we cruised south of the philippines and beared witness to the wonders of nature, ate our hearts out at Palaisdaan somewhere in tayabas quezon and partied in "yuppies" a local bar in lucban. The weather was so friggin cold, same coldness as baguio s and i have learned so much about philippine geography janjie being the mi ultimo tour guide he is (except for being a finicky chef of course). Well, over all, it was a very relaxing exhaliating trip so far, away from the hustle and bustle and worries of city life.

      And so yeah im sick, despite of the fever and the difficulty and all i went to the gym to sweat it out, thinking maybe a little body movement would work, so with the abdominal exercises and a little cardiovascular stuff would work, so yeah it helped a little but as soon as i finished the fever comes back and i am feeling uber weak again. Then right after my gym bout, we went to wilbert, my gay friend's party, pigged out on fatty stuff and split went to the office and then my boss goes, hey , you seem to have monday sickness and i go yeah, i was really sick boss. Well cant blame him, my absences became so predictable its either on a monday or a friday (for longer weekends? but nah) Now for real, i have to go to a doctor coz im having trouble breathing already but the stubborn chainsmoker in me keeps on puffing man. Its like when your so fuckin full, and you need to do something abt it its either you puke some of it outta ur system or smoke or drink coke. Problem is, i cant drink coke, first up, i cut carbonated drinks out of my diet program (yeah as if there is a diet program) and that its acid in a way. I have trouble with acid dude, coz i was diagnosed last year as to laymans terms; having a thin layer left on my throat before it gives up due to too much acid and ey, my years of bulimia, so see i cant even puke some stuff out or im gna suffer an operation of the throat or a heart problem and im not ready for that, 1st, my throat is my bread and butter, i talk endlessly as a customer service rep and 2nd my heart still needs some real complication before it gets unusely complicated (get what i mean, it needs loveee first duh, bwehehehehe.). Im so full of issues today, issues that cant be discussed over coffee but can only be discussed with a doctor. so double pay or not i have to go to the doc tom. than suffer for the rest of my life. :)

      its been a long time since i last posted in my bloggy.  Noel doesnt like the color, i say i like it its so flashy. i like blue in this shade so what..hahahahaha.  well so much had happened, i have lost like 15 pounds in 1 and a half month i have closely een fighting with the wild animals out there making sure that i dont go near them and get killed you know..ehehehehhe. i have been so mistaken as a lesbo for quite sometime now and i say fuck you guys...i wish i was but nah. I am not a lesbian , i may come strong but i am not, i am just protecting myself over wild beasts see. So is it like if i dont succumb to your inviting means im a lesbian huh. Fine. wtf. Its so cool to be left alone, so safe and so calm, but sometimes sad. SDad because you are alone, no hugs no kisses no love and care eh. I dont want to play around too, eh pucha galit nga ako sa ganun tapos pati ako sasawsaw sa ganun diba. Sometimes the saying "if u cant beat them , join them" doesnt apply. your just giving in to more trouble, more shit, more cause for overeating, thus an empty pocket and a rigorous diet. daym. what am i thinking? LOL  anyway workwise, i tried applying for the ADT acct and i was like sheyt, rejected. Why the fuck man? And the goddamn excuse/ they dont want to let me go out of pubklishing. boink.....baket? so ill rot my ass in publishing, work hard toil hard and go crazy over those fucked up T1 lines, Rude Onaks and all that QA shit.  And yesterday, after work me, carlo, coke, james of d1, odie and The minger went to foodcourt and drank pale from 8am to 1:30 pm and shit, the lakas toma minger is, she wanted pa more. Sometimes i wonder where the hell she stacks those beer that she chugs.. bionic girl.

      hmmm...whats up? i havent been going to the gym lately.  I got whappacked into depressive mode beause of this far out book,  She's Come Undone   I got bowled over by how this girl, Dolores Price narrated her not so sad and angry life of nervous breakdown, self pity and guilt. I wouldnt say its a good book but its intention of putting me into tumbling back to my odd past was successful.   Usage of the internet were banned in the floor, i couldnt even take a peek beacuse of those IT goddamn poeple roaming around the premises. Plus, the rick L sightings are driving us nuts in the production floor.   He made a speech 2 days ago about not being afraid of changes. im not afraid, nor convinced by his speil corporate promises of new beginning isnt surprising but i am impressed by his marketing strategy to us midgets. I loved the overflowing pizza shit. lets just wait and see.  My sister is working with me now in webserv, along with my childhood friend migz. Soon Sheryl and Maan will join us as well. If you are not happy with the workplace anymore fucker, u might as well make it a happy place for u by getting your real friends.  Well its time to pay tribute to a drinking buddy, Jets who resigned and left me drinking extra joss during breaktime. Jet has been a very good buddy to me, he was always there when i wanted a fix may it be in cable car to wherever ther is beer. though his jokes are corny, i will never forget how he made my life easy just by laughing at him.

      Not a very good week. Feelings of boredom are on the rise, boredom and sickness all because of the constant shit im into work terms i mean. Im in total burnoutville, i need a change of enviroment.   Now what do i do in global besides work? i fucken drink to stupor after work, drink slurpee every breaktime, hang out with poeple from global like i dont have a social life? my friends outside of work are complaining that im out of time for them well, when you are in a funk you drown yourself till you feel its over right. im just making the most out of whats making me dizzy to the point of puking and walking out.   Daym still no love life. I feel i am not capable of having such. im such a nutcase and a dream believer to even maintain a life of real love. I scared my self to death and numbness and for now i declare my feelings as numb dead and most of all impotent! ahahahha.. oh well oh well.

      i am such a desperate fart, last ditch in making my life a meaningful one each in every minute here in this goddang company that i made it into a crush cow. I have been developing interests in each and every potential newbie that i encounter in my sudden walks and rounds in the production floor. As ricky said, u need to like somebody real bad as a drive to work.  Noel said once that i have a very disturbing way of getting to my prospect, my "hello pare " approach i mean. But hell, if "hello pare" could get me real up close and personal with my eye candy then why not diba? any which way and god knows what diba?

      what a day. I learned that one of my teammates, mommy cat just had her contract ended.   Lunch time i tripped on the gutter on my way to seven eleven damn the pair of clogs im wearing boolshit. Its 5 inches high.  A lot of poeple leaving actually. It hurts. Migs is considering australia he might resign next next week.   I learned that during the party the guy i liked had a sexual bout in the comfort room with a katulong looking bitch ass. Oh sorry i shant call the fucker bitch, bitch is such a sublime and sacred word that i wont dare use for wannabees such as that cheap slutty fucknut. Now I dont like him anymore. I feel a tinge of annoyance remembering him. Sabi ng mga bakla, im so choosy, sabi ko naman i dont wanna end up crying over stupid circumstances. Might as well protect myself from harm. I have invested so much time and effort to regain my self esteem after my last encounter with the beasts of the other sex that makes it hard for me to EVER jump in to the world of boy-meets-girl-and-falls-in-love saga again. FUck the dating world man.

       ass kissing was never my game and never will be.period.  ____________________________________________________________  Quite an interesting week. First, in the very heart of katipunan, where the usual traffic is, we saw 2 very cute guys in their not so cute and OA car last thursday ( a baby blue "over shocked" civic esi with that pathetic www.blahblah.com/his name sticker shit, to make it look like a racing car) one in the passenger seat is married (reez saw the ring) and the free one was the driver named jmariano. 3 girls at the back, thats moi, gen my friend and reez my sisters friend got a little bit infatuated so we were turning our heads in the car's direction. Migs on the other hand felt empathy and started to make us write down our names in a paper...the only brave soul to have her number written there was gen, not because she wanted to fool with the guy but to help us, mga friends nya na scared shit to give out our numbers. And so it happened, migs gave gen s number to the guy in the baby blue pathetic car and we started texting... tonight is when were finally going to meet the man.  Anyway after the flirting-with-the-other-car thing I decided to have a decent night out with my girlfriends way back UST soccer days, had a ball drank beer to death until 2:30 with them then made senti with carlo in whistlestop until 5 am. My crew (naks crew!) went to a different party where i was supposed to go as well but opted not to for the simple reason that i dont want to see the arrogant whore that made a fool out of my 2 friends for i was in the verge of giving her yung sampal na makakaitsa sa kanya hanggang mars you know. So there, temper was in a a real high nung gabi ba yun kaya i decided to take a break and unglobal myself for the weekend (UNGLOBAL HUH).  Sunday I recieved a text message from Ivan for some strange reason. Got pissed coz theres a possibility na me nag trip sakin. Its either gary or some guy who knew i liked him. If I get to see who that is Ima tear him to peices i swear. To text him back for that instance is an embarrasing thing for me, since ima be breaking my code. The responsible guys gonna pay who ever that is i swear.  So yun lang

        tis the forced leave season...and what do we do?          team building here and there       beer binges in the food court           We just had a blast last friday, me and some of my vellpeppers teammates drinking to death at my house. As usual, Russel took the centerstage with his crying bouts over his mom, who now we learn has cancer and annabel, an ex gf from high school he is yakking about. Russel is not like that in his normal self, bibo yan eh, makulit, autistic. It seems that drinking is a form of release for him, sakin ayos lang yon.  Some girls can be strange as in psycho strange...isa lang masasabi ko. Ang tahimik ang pinaka mabangis. Kawawa naman si eric.   On a lighter note, I seem to have developed this little crush over a guy who looks like Mr. Robb of Hoobastank. And its funny coz he sings as well and i cant help but admire his singing one time when we were in the food court on our very light and cheap moments. Cheap fun is enjoyable, i cant help but be mused by other poeple s drunken ways. I have the weirdest fellers in the food court one guy there lasts a whole drinking session by singing "its my life " by Bon Jovi all through. One guys singing to death as if it was one of his concert series (me kasama pa yong welcome to blah blah blah this is blah yada yada) And us, we laugh at no end and shout.  Me and condrad once asked our selves over beer,   "bakit di natin maiwan ang globalstride"   sabi ko kasi parang college at high school eto pinakamasarap na trabahong napasukan ko kahit di ganun kataas ang sweldo compared sa iba. Sabi naman nya   "Global kasi parang skul bukul"          .     AND THERE HE WAS AGAIN, Andre the giant a.k.a My father, Mario     He came back from where he came from, wreaking havoc to the house hold with his alalay again. His purpose: To get materials for his shop back there. He yakks about shit, pesters us to hell, wakes us up in our sleeping hours and blast unsolicited hurtful comments on how you act PLUS textes my mother every now and then siraan kami and stuff then makes my mother call us and curse us from the other end. How stupid and childish can a grown moron get diba?   We just acted the normal person not minding him, escaping his route every single minute, forcing ourselves to go to the office even if its a forced leave. Creating false lakad on a sunday or saturday wag lang syang makasama sa mga invites nya, like that time when he wanted to go to my Lolo s place or when he asked me to go with him to buy perfume. Nung sa perfume shit sinabi ko na lang na ako na lang bibili at mamimili ng perfume for him, he thought it was sweet when i was thinking lang na fuck i dont want to have a bonding moment with you. We tried bonding a couple of times already pero hes still the same ass of a dad. There was even this one time when me migs and soy went to work na we didnt witness a very monumental event, migs' evil dad had a drinking session with my evil dad I wonder if satan conjoined them there or whatev.  And at long last he went away, then there i had a party. A sort of celebration of his voyage and at the same time a time for a reunion with mamita and a bonding moment for joey and russel na me alitan.
