      I have been collecting quotes for some time from the email signatures of my friends or from what I hear and not from any one site. These are the ones that I really like : &nbsp; What we are is God's gift to us.&nbsp; What we become is our gift to God.&nbsp;  -Eleanor Powell  &nbsp;  Only the mediocre are always at their best.  -Jean Giraudoux&nbsp; &nbsp;  The difficulty lies, not in the new ideas, but in escaping from the old ones.  -John Keynes  &nbsp;  When you are not practicing, remember, someone somewhere is practicing, and when you meet him he will win.  -Ed Macauley  &nbsp;  There are times when a man should be content with what he has but never with what he is. -William George Jordan  &nbsp;  The death of fear is in doing what you fear to do. -Sequichie Comingdeer  &nbsp;  Anyone who has never made a mistake, has never tried anything new. -Albert Einstein &nbsp; There is only one success--to be able to spend your life in your own way. -Christopher Morley   If at first you don't succeed, find out if the loser gets anything.  -Bill Lyon&nbsp; &nbsp;

      I had quite a privilege the day before yesterday. When I had asked for a ticket for ‘Two Brothers’ at the theater’s ticketing booth, the girl looked at me strangely and said something to her colleague in the adjacent booth. I assumed that the ticket might have been sold out and asked if that was the case. She burst into giggles. It ultimately turned out that a movie was screened exclusively for me. Not a single other soul was present in the theater!&nbsp; This doesn’t necessarily reflect my opinion about the movie. The movie was indeed good.  &nbsp;  Contrary to my assumption, Two Brothers was not a cartoon movie. In fact, the heroes of this movie, the Two Brothers or two tiger cubs don’t talk at all. This is the movie about a happy tiger family, a tiger and a tigress and their two cubs, Kumal and Sangha. Kumal is shy where as Sangha is brave and adventurous. They lead a happy life in the jungles of Cambodia and among the treasures of the ancient temple ruins. Human greed for temple statues and tiger skin leads to their separation. The tiger or the dad is shot dead. The tigress is also shot but she escapes. Kumal is captured by Guy Pearce, Hunter Aiden Mcrory - the protagonist of the movie, but ultimately ends up in a Circus. Sangha ends up in the personal zoo of the Cambodian King. After long twists and turns, and after a year, a tiger fight is organized for the amusement of the king. Kumal and Sangha end up in the arena to fight and kill each other. But they recognize each other and ultimately manage to escape from the clutches of human cruelty.  &nbsp;  There are many things in this movie that I liked. I am however referring to specific scenes or incidents. It is understandable that it would be easy to make a dog act in a movie. But making the tigers act is an altogether different business and the director needs to be given due credit for this. I feel that this movie is the best justice any person can do to this story. The movie was very well shot and my kudos to the director and the crew.  &nbsp;  Mcrory though a hunter by profession develops an emotional attachment with Kumal. This shows that every human being is emotional and has a tendency to love small and beautiful things in life. A dialogue that best sums up this aspect is when Mcrory tries to feed Kumal and lovingly admonishes him “If you bite me, I’ll bite you back, that’s the deal”. I liked the way Kumal develops a liking for the honey drops of Mcrory and Mcrory is more than generous to give them to Kumal. I also loved the Cambodian King. This is how these kings usually are – typical buffoons who cling on to their title for no legitimate reason but of their birth. I am pretty happy that at least India doesn’t have a king. In this movie human cruelty is portrayed very well through acts of the circus ringmasters. I hope this will lead to some consciousness about treatment of the wild animals among the audience. I also hope that there is some audience, unlike my experience. When the fight is organized among the tigers, the two brothers recognize each other in the arena and start to love and cuddle each other instead of fighting. This shows that blood is thicker than anything else. This is true whether it is in the case of animals or humans. When Kumal and Sangha escape, Mcrory is given the task of hunting them down. It was impressive that though Mcrory accepts this task, he decides he will hunt no longer after this. Though Kumal is shy and fearful, he had learned to jump through the ring of fire at the circus. This shows that the initial fear to start any terrifying work can ultimately be overcome with a small spark of boldness. After that the fear vanishes and the once fearsome work becomes a habit. It was always Sangha who used his bravery to protect Kumal but ultimately when they need to escape through the fire, it’s Kumal who uses his skill to jump through the fire and teaches the same to Sangha. Finally, the reunion of the cubs with their mom left me very happy.  &nbsp;  At last I have ended up with one more bullet in my life’s long ‘to-do’ list – To have a tiger cub as my pet.

      This is my second attempt to be a regular blogger. My first attempt was an utter failure as I had discontinued after my first post. This time I hope to be more regular. I will write about the places I visit, the movies I see or the books I read (which is highly unlikely). I will be very objective and&nbsp;won’t make this a trash can to dump my emotions. Today I am writing about&nbsp;my Texas trip.   On reaching Dallas, Krishna picked me up at the airport. Dallas is a very vast and advanced city. What has really impressed me in Texas is that all cities are very modern and in spite of being as modern as California the crowd is much less than California and thus, making the places very enjoyable. We had gotten a very good almost new car on rent - ' Pontiac Grand AM'. We ate little bit of breakfast, the usual bean chalupas, at a Mexican fast food joint. After our breakfast, we drove to Austin.   Austin is about 4 hours from Dallas. At Austin, we went around the Capitol. Capitol is the legislative assembly of Texas. It is a big building and resembles the legislatures of Indian states. Though building was no special, I was impressed by the fact that visitors were allowed into every part of the building. We also had a look at the Governor's house across the road from outside. Austin is a beautiful city. We drove around in the University of Texas Austin, just to have a look at one of the top universities of US. Before leaving Austin, we had our lunch at a Chinese restaurant. This was an 'All vegetarian' Chinese restaurant. Can you believe it? They substitute TOFU for all dishes, for shrimp, beef everything...so absolutely no meat inside the restaurant. This restaurant is run by the Felon Gong sect that is banned in China. I start like that place not just because of food but also because of my instinctive inclination to empathize with minority and those who suffer. Falon Gong is unfortunately being persecuted very badly in China. I should say that the food was absolutely superb. It didn't have the pungent smell that usually accompanies Chinese food. I rate it among one of the best foods I have eaten&nbsp;in US. I ate an eggplant gravy as I like eggplants. I asked them to make it hot and spicy, so they made it very spicy. It was served with white rice. The best part of the lunch was the coconut cream bubble tea. It typically doesn't contain Tea. It’s called so as it is drink and thus, colloquially it’s tea. It’s one of the finest drinks that I have drunk so far in my life. It tasted like milkshake and had coconut milk added to it. It contained black pearls, these are small pea sized soft tapioca balls that are boiled in sugar syrup and soaked.   From Austin, we went on to San Antonio. San Antonio is a very famous tourist spot in Texas, about 2 hours south of Austin. I liked San Antonio most in this trip.&nbsp;There is a small canal about 10 feet wide and 3 foot deep, which they call San Antonio River. Around this canal, they have built innumerous restaurants, both seating inside and outside by the side of the river, and huge shopping malls. The whole area gets a feel of Venice and is known as the ‘river walk’. Open air music in a small open air amphitheater is a regular feature every evening and the whole area has got a pretty good atmosphere. Here we had our dinner at a Mexican restaurant. I ate cheese enchiladas - these are Maida patties stuffed with cheese and then deep fried. They served it with Mexican rice, chips and beans. This is where we faced the sole problem of our trip. We had parked our car in a parking lot after paying $7. Then we had gone to the river walk in a trolley. After having dinner and being at the river walk for quite a while, we were not able to figure out where actually the parking lot was. There were parking lots everywhere. We asked a police fellow, another trolley driver, many pedestrians and none of them were able to help us. We spent about an hour in this search. Ultimately, the car was pretty near to where we were and the round-about route taken by the trolley had confused us. From San Antonio we went to Kingsville and slept in the hotel we had booked there. We stayed at Kingsville, a sleepy town without any attractions and about an hour from Corpus Christi, because it was much cheaper than in Corpus Christi.   Next morning we went to Corpus Christi. Corpus Christi is a&nbsp;big city and port on the Gulf of Mexico. We went to the beach and then to USS Lexington Museum. This is basically an aircraft carrier that has been decommissioned and stationed on the bay. We went around the aircraft carrier and it was nice to stand on the deck with the aircrafts. I ate typical American junk food of French fries at the canteen of the aircraft carrier. One of the attractions inside the aircraft carrier was a movie on a screen that was three stories tall! In fact we had driven on the shoreline drive for a while along the Gulf of Mexico to reach the USS Lexington. It was nice. In fact the bridge to USS Lexington was also pretty well constructed and an attraction in itself.   On the same day, we started our return journey. San Antonio had impressed me and we wanted to go to the river walk again. Now we were sure of where we had to park our car. This time around, we first visited the tower of America. This is a 600 feet high tower with an observatory at the top. You can take an elevator to the top of the tower. It takes about 2 minutes to get to the top of this tower in the elevator and from the top of the tower you are able to see the entire area in all directions. It was a very good sight. From there, we again went to the river walk for dinner and had our dinner at another Mexican restaurant. I ate Veggie burrito. As in any Mexican restaurant, this was accompanied by chips, salad, beans and Mexican rice. Surprisingly, although the crowd was much less in this restaurant than the one I had visited the day before, the food was much tastier. From San Antonio we reached Austin at night. We dropped Houston as we didn't have time for it. We stayed at the place of Krishna's friend at Austin.   Next morning, we went to Madras Pavilion at Austin for lunch buffet. This is a south Indian restaurant and the food was fabulous. In addition to the buffet they offer a free dosa of whatever type you want, which is prepared hot and fresh. The whole lunch cost around $8 and tasted as good as Saravana Bhavan. I ate 4 medhu vadas, lots of sambhar, mint chutney, coconut chutney, onion chutney, 3 idlis, pongal, rasam, white rice with curry, panner masala, appalam, onion rava dosa, semiya payasam, mango custard, kootu, keerai, vegetable pulav and the list goes on.   We left Austin and again reached Dallas by evening. There was some traffic jam en-route, so it took longer than what it should usually take to reach Dallas. At Dallas, we first drove&nbsp;through the downtown. I saw the place where Kennedy was assasinated.&nbsp;Then we went to the temple. There were lots of perumals, I&nbsp;prayed to them and also went 9 rounds of navaragraham. From the temple, went to have our dinner at an Italian restaurant, Olive Garden. They have their chain through out US and I also visit&nbsp;this restaurant here at Fort Collins.   I drank my favorite Sicilian cream soda and ate eggplant parmesan. This was also served with spaghetti and marinara sauce. After&nbsp; dinner, Krishna dropped me at the airport. I reached Denver at night and came back to Ft. Collins in the shuttle and drove home from the shuttle stop in my car. This all about my TX trip................................
