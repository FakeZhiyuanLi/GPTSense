      Hola! Here I am today! Nothing to do and bored to death. I have school right now and that like takes up my day. I have to go to school because I didn't pass the Science TAKS...Boo!! Why do I have to be so dumb?! After my mom picked me up, we went to the driving place so I can sign up! Woo-Hoo...one step closer to driving! Well, everything has been so weir for me! I don't know what to do with myself! I have been so out of it...I don't even have the friends I used to! I have lost so much of my friends and I don't even know how I did that! Like I mean, I have lost touch with Krysten, Michelle, and Krista! I feel like I have lost my friends..even though I knew deep down inside Krista and Michelle didn't like me! I don't know what was up with that! It's like I went to a church where I no longer had friends. I felt so left out in everything I did! It was sad! Now, if go to church I end up going in Lytle or when I am with my dad! I miss everyone at church but like I mean, if they missed me too...they would call! I wonder what will happen with my mom and step-dad, Doug, and the whole divorce thing! I can't wait until something actually happens! Something need to happens now! I mean like, I get so tired of wondering what is going to happen! I can't stand any of my step-sisters! I mean like everything they have done has been so wrong. None of them are even the same anymore! They are all liars. Farrin is a two-faced idiot! Cassidy has a horrible attitude and Brandy is a WITCH! I wanna get away from them all! I wanna leave here. Get away forever! I hate where I am and I wish I could just go away-FAR AWAY!! But anyways- I have been pretty happy when I am able to go spend time with my brother and his gf's Family all in Lytle. I mean, it is so small over there, but I love it for some reason! I like being over there and it is just so fun! That's probaly where I will be the rest of the summer cause that's where I like to be! I wish I could move out of here! I wanna graduate and leave here! I wish I could drive! I wish I had a job! I wish I had money! My life has been screwed over because my stupid and wicked step-sisters! I need to get away! But I don't know- I have to stop whining and try to face what's happening now! I have to go for right now anyways! Bye and love you!

      Holla-How are you guys doing? Well, I am ok and doing better than earlier. I was miserable last night...I cried myself to sleep :o( But, I woke up late and I chilled. Naomi and Paul came over and my mom BBQed for us. We just visited which was nice! We were just talking and talking. Later they left and I was once again bored. Today went by really quick though. I was actually planning on going out today but no one was around to. So, I just stayed here and did nothing. My mom was all crying and was saying that I don't love her or something like that. I didn't know what to do. So her and I ended up having this long conversation. She is better now. I was all depressed and emotional still, so I let some tears loose. You are probaly thinking I am a cry baby...but only sometimes-haha! Really, I am not always like that! But, the good thing is that I am doing a lot better. I finally got the picture posted. I was having trouble at first, but now I have it under control. Man-I need to go to the Valley soon. I haven't seen my family in a while! I miss them too! I also miss BOBBY! I haven't seen him in a long time! The most coolest thing is that we met at church camp. We met the summer of my 8th grade year! It's been a while and we are still good friends! That's what you call a friend. He is so sweet too! HI BOBBY :o) He is going off to college soon though. So, I need to get over there so I can see him! Man-I have no idea what I will be doing tomorrow...hopefully Lucas and Naomi can come over. I wanna do something with them-but more than likely they won't come over. So yah-I am gonna end up going to bed early cause Steve went to bed and I have no one to talk to...o well, I guess I need the rest anyways! I really hope I can get better...I don't like to be sad! I WILL :o) So yuppers...I guess I should head to bed in a lil bit...night!  Love you-M U A H xoxo

      Hi-well, today sucked badly. I mean, I went to church and I got to see everybody and all. We went out to lunch with some family friends! We went to go eat at Souper Salad. It was ok. I was not feeling good so the whole time I was all out of it because I wasn't feeling good. Then my mom and I went to Seaworld to go meet Naomi! We got there at like 3. It was HOT! But yah-we went to go see some shows or whatever. I really liked the Fireworks...they were pretty! People were shoving a lot and I wasn't feeling good, so I was REALLY annoyed. I felt like the 3rd wheel with my mom and Naomi. They weren't even talking to me, so basically I was there all alone! I wish I would have had someone there with me. I hated it so much! I wasn't feeling good and I was being ignored! Then, I decide I wanna go to Lytle cause I don't wanna be HERE...and like there were some difficulties! There is this guy that is married to Lucas' cousin. He is 20 and like supposedly he was looking at me a couple of times or whatever. I wasn't encouraging the situation, in fact-I was clueless until Mesha told James and he talked to me. From then on, I became uncomfortable. Well, long story short, he called me and James found out. He had just called to see how I was and it was wrong cause he is married but my brother doesn't like him and he got MAD. Now, when I get home from having a bad day, my brother calls to say to me that he thinks it is best that I just don't show my face in Lytle for awhile until they figure out what to do with him...and they expect me to be ok with it! YAH RIGHT!!! I am so emotional right now and I just started to cry :o( I was so sad! I feel like I have no where. I don't wanna be here and I can't be there. But I don't know what to do...it is gonna be so uncomfortable when I see him now. They said they were gonna talk to him and then that will put me on the spot. I just wish this wasn't happeneing! UGH-I hate it! So now here I am...sad! I am so tired but I don't feel good and when I don't feel good, I don't sleep! SUCKS!! Anyways-hope whoever is reading this had a great 4th! But yah-sorry this entry is so extremely boring. I had to say what was on my mind. And I think I may be in Lytle for a couple days...so if you don't hear from me, that's where I am! Well, I guess I am gonna go for right now! Bye guys and I love you! MUAH xoxo...

I woke up at 11 because I was not feeling good. I had some bad pains. I didn't get to go to the funeral either because I could not walk and I felt so sick! I didn't have a lot of energy. I was so tired today that I ended up staying home all day! I watched TV and I played alot of games! I am tired of sitting at home. I am actually going to Crossroads tomorrow! It will be weird because I have not been there in SO LONG! I hope it isn't too awkward! Tomorrow, my mom and I are gonna go to Lytle and try to see if we can see my brother! I guess then after that, I am gonna go to Sea World and watch the Fireworks! Woo-Hoo! I hope I am feeling ok to go though! I hope I am atleast feeling a lot better! School is so close! I wish it wasn't! I REALLY don't wanna go back. I am not excited about going back to O'Connor! I miss Taft! I wish I was keeping touch with all my friends! I think I have lost alot of them. YEAH-My hair has a grown a little. Not a lot, but hey-I am getting there. I am so tempted to cut it! I hate my hair. It's like I dont have a stlye! UGH...suck a nut! I have not been excercising like I had been wanting to. I get so lazy! I hope I can get fit soon. I don't wanna be all fat! So yuppers-I wanna hear "Roses". I love that song. I don't even know why! All I know is that I really like it! Everytime it comes on, I start singing and dancing! YEAH :o) Okay then, I probaly need to get to bed early tonight since I have to wake up Early.

      Holla! Well, today was a pretty long day! Today was the last day at school...thank goodness! Now all I have to do is take the test next week...I am so scared/nervous! But-it will be all good in the end! Anywho-I was so bored today! I went to go eat at Applebee's with my mom. It was good! Yummy...FOOD! I got to wear my new shorts today! I was so happy because me and Nessa wore them to school, it was cute! I also got a Frappuccino this morning! Mmm Mmm Good :o) Josuf came by today and visited me! He is so funny! We hung out for a little bit and got to talk because we usually don't get to...I played games today-it became a routine caus eI was so bored today! I had nothing to do at all! BORING! I am going to that funeral tomorrow! It is gonna be so sad. I feel so bad for the family. I wanna put my pic in this thing that is Hot or not thing...it is a webiste and supposedly people vote on whether you are pretty or not. I wanna do it because I am curious as to what people will think of me...So, that's what I will do for tomorrow..I just hope a lot of people do  not think I am ugly. That will be a discouragement! My brother was mad at me because there is this guy that he doesn't like that called  me and it got into a huge deal...I started to cry cause I thought he was mad at me. I hate when he is mad at me though! I also talked to Lucas, he is so funny! He makes me laugh so much and that is always a good thing when a guy can make you laugh a lot! Hehehe :o) So yah...I am talking to this guy Steve that I met through a weird way, but man, for those of you who know about Danny a.k.a the Faggot, I found of some stuff. He is so Stupid and so is his gf! I can't believe I ever believed anything he ever said to me. What a loser! But hey-we all learn from our STUPID mistakes! Or atleast I will! Never Again! It is so hard for me to trust poele though and that is something I am gonna have to work on. I just wish people would respect me enough to not lie to me! O well-it happens I guess. I wanna meet a guy that will truly care for me and like me for who I am! I mean, I want a guy that will make me laugh, smile, make me feel important and like, I dont know- I want A COOL GUY! My wish :) Yuppers...HI STEVE-SMILE :o) Thought I would say hi! Hehe...anyways-I am getting tired though. I still have no idea what I am doing on the 4th and I wish I knew! But yuppers, I have to go cause I am probaly being boring again :( Buh bye...Luv u's...Muah X O X O

      What-up?! Here I am bored again in my stupid apartment! With nothing to do again! My days have been so boring! I can't stand being here anymore! I can't wait until school is over. 1 MORE DAY! Thank goodness! Well, yesterday I went with Nessa to Panda's Express and then to Old Navy. I saw the cutest shorts. I had to get them and I did! They are super cute. They aren't short...they come up to my knees I think, but when you see them, they are ugly, but I guess it's when you put them on they look adorable! I like them! I dont know what I am gonna do for 4th yet! I probaly will go with Naomi! I don't want her to go alone to Sea World. I really don't wanna be with my mom! I hope I am not stuck with her either! I have no idea of what I am gonna do when this week is over. I don't know whether to go back to Lytle or to go with my dad. I still need to decide! But all I know is that I am NOT gonna be here with my mom! Definitely not! I wanna go out and fun right now! I have some cute outfits that I feel like showing off right now! But I can't do it when I am under this roof!! Haha! Anyways-I wanna see all my old friends. I miss everyone! Man-I cannot believe that Lindsay's mom died last Saturday! I mean like everyone was kinda expecting it, but wow! I mean she is really not here now! It is so sad and I am going to the funeral on Saturday! I wonder how she is taking it! I hate going to funerals because they are just so sad! But, I feel that I need to go! I was close to them and I have known them for a long itme. I think it would only be right if I went! So, yah-I got to talk to Krysten the other day. I hadn't talked to her in forever and I was just so scared that she was mad at me! Thank goodness she wasn't! I really can't stand my step sis either. I mean she is so fake! I am glad I haven't seen them. I get mad when I think about them and everything! So yuppers- I feel like going to see "White Chicks". I wonder if that was a good movie or not. Man-o-Man...I wanna go shopping! Haha-I always want to though, so it really isn't a big deal. I need a job so that I can get money and go get some really cute clothes! It's on the to-do list! I wanna learn to play my guitar too! That would be so exciting! Maybe I should trying doing that soon! Okay so yah-I have to go...sorry this may be boring to whoever is reading this...I promise that my life will get interesting...haha! Luv ya MUCHO!   M  x  U  o  A  x  H  o
