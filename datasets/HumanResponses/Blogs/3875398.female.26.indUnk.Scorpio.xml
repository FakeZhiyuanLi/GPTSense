        Today has actually been a rather pleasant day. The only think missing was talking to Davina. I was really hoping to spend some time talking but it is kewl I know she needs to rest right now. I don't know what I would do if I ever had to go through that again. I guess it makes it a bit easier on her with me knowing exactly what she has just been through and everything she is facing now as well. Just maybe make us a bit stronger and more in tune with each other cause I do know where she is coming from and she now knows where I have came from......

       Well I am happy yet for some reason there is still a sadness inside me burning terribly from some where deep inside my heart. I was so upset when I was told what was going on and all I could think of was being there. I know what it feels like to go through these things alone and I know I didn't want to but I had to. Well I just don't know sights for sore eyes and all that but I still feel very sad......

      If I were a tear in your eye I would run down your cheek and die on your lips. If you were a tear in my eye I would never cry in fear of losing you......   I feel so in love and some times I just dont understand why. I mean not really why just how could it happen. I know some times I get hurt and I am not sure why and or how. Some times I feel happy some times I feel sad and some times I just feel all alone. I hate being alone I dont want to be alone any more. I think I just want to try and start over I would maybe like to live in a bigger town. I dont know if I could ever leave my family though. I know I want to be with Davina when I think about her I smile with no reasoning at all just because she makes me happy. I dont know if I will ever be able to do this for her. I know that I am ready to settle down and start a family. But I am not sure if others are ready as I am. Maybe in time I will find out but today aint looking good......

      Some dumb fucker just ran over my dog and didnt even have the heart to come and tell me. I just dont understand how someone can be so cold hearted. No campassion for anything living and or dead. People are just sick I know if it would have been me I would have atleast went to someones door and asked if it was there dog and maybe ther could have told me who it belonged to but no. Brooks and Bub are going to go and bury her in the yard. I just cant do it I mean I just cant I dont know why but I cant deal with shit like this. I have a hard time with death even if it was a dog. I just dont feel good right now things have got to get better I dont think they could get any worse....

      I went out tonight and hung out with everyone something I have not done in awhile. It was fun just kinda different lol. I was very shocked today Davina told me she loved me and I just dont think i have felt that good in A LONG TIME. I mean I really hope things work out I just feel like she is the one I have been waiting for. I dont know how long the long distance thing will work but because I do love her so much I am willing to do whatever it is going to take not to lose her......

        Well I got back from Mich. City yesterday and was just exhausted. I had a really good time the first day I was there we went to the beach and hung out till the storm drove us off the beach. I was post to call Davina the night we go there and maybe at ten on the other nights but after the first night I was pretty heart broken she didn't answer her phone. I don't know how to get through to her I mean I am trying everything I know to do. I have been extremely understanding and you would think that would count for something. I mean I love the time we do spend talking but it just don't seem like enough. She said something to me the other day about what would I do if she showed up at my house with her things and said ok I'm staying what would I say. Well I don't know if I was totally honest with her about it I just kind of made a joke out of it and I really wanted to say when will you be arriving cause in all honesty that is what I want I just have a hard time saying it to her. I don't know if she was serious or not cause she just keeps saying (slow) and I mean we have been going slow if I go any slower I'm going to need a walker before anything happens lmao but oh well patience is a virtue and I guess that is what it is going to take......

          Today has just been one of those days. Mowing the yard all morning then helping my parents move the camper home this afternoon. I would like to find some time for me today but I am not sure if it is going to work. The whole time I was mowing and the whole time I was helping the folks there was only one thought running through my head, " what am I going to do about Davina". I am so gun shy now that I asked her and kinda ran last night if she would go back out with me and we work on things, but I have not been able to bring it up today. I know she is busy like all the time I just wish there was even an hour a day she could just break and spend time with me talking about the things we need to talk about. I also wish she would start sharing her feelings with me and not just keeping them to herself. I mean I cant promise her that I can help with everything but I sure couldn't hurt them I wouldn't think. Well that is all for today.......
