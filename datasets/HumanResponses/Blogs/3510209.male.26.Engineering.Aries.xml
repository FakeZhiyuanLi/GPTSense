      Hi, first an obligatory lame intro. My name is  urlLink Edgar , I was born in Panamá (the country with the canal), April 14, 1978. I like SKA, Punk and Reggae on music; and on TV: Law and Order *, Cartoons and News. I currently live in a little town near Albany NY, called Fonda; The things I like to do are watch tv, listen to radio, drive around, computer programming, hardware design, wardriving and all things Linux.  I live with my girlfriend, she is a Spanish teacher in a town nearby; she is a year younger and she is going to start grad school in SUNY. I think is enough for now, I will post some more later on. I hope you all like this so far. To be continued...

      I think there is no better way to learn about a person than observing him on a regular day; so here I go. I wake up at around 5:30 to 6:30 AM due to the amount of noise that my girlfriend makes every day before she go to work. She normally ask me to prepare her some breakfast, her favorite is eggs and toast with a glass of orange juice or milk, so I make some for me too. She leaves for school at around 7:00 to 7:20 AM, at this time I start getting ready, take a shower; check e-mails and prepare any bills I have to pay; or burn any CD’s I would like to use at work. I try to get to work on time (8:00 AM) but that almost never happen, I know I should be more organized but I make up for the time  at lunch or after 5:00 PM. I get to work, and do things for about 1 hour and then I connect to MSN, AIM, Yahoo, ICQ and IRC on my desknote (Laptop beside my workstation), on the background I am also checking for e-mails on my various accounts. After that, I work until lunch, at lunch time I go to the post office check my P.O. Box, mail some things and then I go home and grab something to eat, mostly leftovers, watch some fox news and at 1:00 PM I go back to work until 5:00 + some change minutes to make up for the late time, then I logoff IRC, AIM, ICQ, MSN and Yahoo, then I go. Then I come back home, wash dishes form the previews day/breakfast/lunch, fix dinner, and clean a little around the house; my girlfriend is already there since she got out of work at 2:30 PM but she sleeps, she is usually exhausted by how much she has to put up with the kids at school, she has to deal with 150 of them a day. At 6:00 PM dinner is done or close to being done so we eat while we watch Rosanne on Oxygen, at 7:00 PM we change the channel and watch Law & Order, make some phone calls and she normally fall a sleep again at around 7:45 to 8:15 PM, here is when I go online, read more e-mail, fix/break things, do some electronics, do some research for things at work until 11:00 PM when I change the channel and watch Adult Swim on TV and keep doing whatever I was doing, maybe checking thins on ebay or working on some of my other websites. At around 1:00 to 2:00 PM I go to bed and sleep. The end..

      Continuing with the mandatory intro, by looking at my interest you probably know that I am an alternative, somewhat geekie person, I agree, I am also quiet and I like to be alone. I drive a Nissan Frontier and I am starting to work on it, right now beside the bug reflector, the window rain protector and the bed cover, is in stock conditions, I want to add a better grill in the front, lower it, change the wheels and install a new radio/speakers. I will post some pictures, showing the progress. My girlfriend and I also own a Jeep Liberty, she drive it around, it is brand new and very comfortable as it is, lets see how it work in the snow.  Well is time to go now, I will continue later on.. Peace.

      It is summer now, my girlfriend is teaching summer classes and it is hotter than hot outside. Things are kind of slow around here, I picked up a bass guitar and I am now learning to play it. Like I mention before I like Reggae music and SKA, I also listen to Punk Rock, they are bass driven music style, hopefully I get to be good enough with the bass and be in a band. Sorry about the delay since my last post I had a week of vacation and on my line of work that is asking for problem, work has accumulated a little, I am catching up now so everything is back to normal. I will try to post more often so it will be good, I will go now. Later.
