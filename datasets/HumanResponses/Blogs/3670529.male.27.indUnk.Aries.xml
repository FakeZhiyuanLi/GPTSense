      I have opinions.  Most people do, its not something to be ashamed of.  I'd like to think my opinions are well informed, thought out, and impervious to others critiques.  Unfortunately that is not true.  That is why blogging is something I approach with some apprehention.  The more I write the more likely I am to be seen by myself and others as a hypocrite.  I see hypocrisy not necessarily as a bad thing, however, as a process; you put forth an ideal that you would like to attain.  The fact that you don't currently hold to those ethics define the areas that you have to grow as a human.   There are two immediate problems with that.  One comes into play when you begin to judge others based on their hypocrisy.  As it is impossible for us as mere finite beings to pierce the veil of others motives, in most cases we are forced to view actions on the surface.  Sooner or later I'll do or write something that is contrary to a belief that I had previously espoused here.  I hope that you, the participant in this dialog, will respect me enough to ask me for an explanation as opposed to just throwing my apparent hypocrisy in my face. That leads right into the second problem.  The world and, more importantly to me, the people I come into contact with every day base their perceptions of Christians, in part, on my actions.  Pervading (worldly) opinion is that Christians as a group are hypocrites.   We are.   So is everyone else.  So what.  As I stated earlier I don't necessarily think that is a bad thing.  However someone at some point decided that Christians should be beyond the failings of mere humanity.  Sure, we hope to  attain  that goal but we are still human.  We, and by we I mean me, will make mistakes.  What I hope to be judged on is not if I make mistakes, but what I do when I make those mistakes.

      Read  urlLink this for reference Don't worry, my thoughts will still be here when you return.  Experiences, if done 'right', should take you out of where you are comfortable and force you to take a serious look at what you believe and why you believe it. (I donâ€™t disagree with your definition, just wanted to post an addendum to explain where I am going with this)   Unfortunately too many times the people that are participating in these Experiences are more interested in finding others who believe as they do and using that as validation for their beliefs.  They then go through life never really knowing what they believe and why they believe it until it is too late.  By too late I mean that the person is faced with a major crisis in an un-controlled environment, as opposed to the Experience environment where there are (more) mature Christians who they can turn to for direction.  Only through examining and testing our beliefs can we become stronger in them, as it is true with anything both spiritual and physical. ....More to come.....

       (The title may not make sense to you, but it does to me)  When I was in High School, among my group of friends I was considered most likely to be married first.&nbsp; Looking back I wonder where it all went wrong.  Little things that I kept from past relationships will send me off on a tangent of contemplation.&nbsp; I tend to write things down, this stems more from my past problems with learning disabilities and restlessness which manifest in a desire to doodle than a belief that I need to write things down for posterity and memory.&nbsp; Anyway, back on topic, I come across old notebooks and journals whenever I clean out my closet or, in the most recent occurrence, move.&nbsp; Mostly it's filled with notes on Campus Crusade discussions, an IP address for an online game I was playing at the time, poetry I was fooling around with, my constant doodle, and then I came across a note I had written to a girlfriend as we were just starting our relationship.  &nbsp;  It made me really pause in what I was doing and reflect on what kind of person I was when I wrote this.&nbsp; As I read the two paragraphs of back and forth writing I wanted to....I don't know.&nbsp; Not cry, but something similar.&nbsp; A feeling I can only describe as my soul became somehow heavier.&nbsp; The budding relationship, the silly flirting, I haven't felt those feelings for quite some time.&nbsp; God said it best: It is not good that man should be alone. I'm tired of being alone.&nbsp; I know that having a girlfriend or wife won't make me happy.&nbsp; I know that in a lot of ways it will make life more complicated rather than less.&nbsp; I'm tired of being alone at a party.&nbsp; Of looking around and realising that I'm the only one who came alone.&nbsp; Of knowing that when I leave wherever I am at, I am going to get back into my car and drive off to wherever, and I'll be the only one in the car.  I get like this sometimes.&nbsp; I'm not looking for a verbal pat on the back, this is just how I feel.

      In a recent Yahoo news article  urlLink US Congresswoman Barbara Lee (D-CA) was quoted as saying, in regards to  urlLink abstinence and AIDS , "...In an age where 5 million people are newly infected each year...women and girls too often do not even have the choice to abstain(from sex)....".  I'm a bit confused here.  From my understanding the only time people don't have a choice to abstain from sex is in a rape situation.  I've tried to find statistics on condom usage in rape scenarios and I can't (any link provided would be appreciated), but I can't imagine it would be too high.  So these women and girls that have no choice to abstain from sex...what is happening to them?  Is freedom of choice no longer an option?  Are we being forced to have sex now as an obligation to society?  I really am at a loss. The really funny and  urlLink iro  urlLink nic(2a)  part is that Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, whose country seems to be the only success story in Africa's war on AIDS, backs abstinence over condoms.  His exact quote?  "I look at condoms as an improvisation, not a solution."  Imagine that, abstinence as the only effective prevention of AIDS.

      I have been trying to figure out why my sister pisses me off so easily and often.  The only real reason that I can come up with is that I seek her approval and when I don't get it I have no idea how to cope.  It might be tied to the fact that my other two siblings approve of me more often than not, even if they don't agree with me.  L. has, in my opinion, never approved of me, and likely never will agree with me.  We have so many shared interests and a wealth of shared experiences, inside jokes that few will ever find amusing, but if we weren't born to the same parents I doubt she would ever choose to relate to me. Its all very sad and I don't know how anything will change.

      When I was in fifth grade I was diagnosed with a  urlLink fine motor dysfunction . In short, what this means is that often times I know what I want to say while writing a paper but I have problems putting those thoughts down. As I have gotten older various workarounds have enabled me to meet (most) deadlines. That's not the point of this post though. The point is, as I have gotten older I have started to write things down more often. I started an occasional diary in 96 in response to prompting from a girlfriend and have written things down in fits and spurts. More often I write in extreme depression or extreme happiness. Going back and re-reading the events of my life up till now is quite the amusing reminiscent trip down  urlLink memory lane . In addition to the diary I also started keeping a  urlLink notepad  with me. I think I started this in  urlLink college , just using it for keeping class notes in, but I found it more useful for the occasional ideas that would pop into my head or random musings. My GPA can attest to this. These notepads have the tendency to hang around long after all their pages have been used up and popping up to remind me of where I came from and what I was going through more than my diary, just because they were with me more often and I was more apt to write only 'important' things in my diary. Now I have this blog. Some friends that I have directed to it don't really understand why someone would put thoughts and feelings that are so private up for the world to see; others see it as a window into my thoughts. I see it as both a window and a way of keeping me honest. There are things I can write on here that I would never say to someone, though I may want to. I say these things online not for fear that the recipient would be offended, but that I can organize my thoughts better when writing and hopefully there is less of a chance for mis-interpretation. Which is actually sorta funny for someone who has trouble writing.
