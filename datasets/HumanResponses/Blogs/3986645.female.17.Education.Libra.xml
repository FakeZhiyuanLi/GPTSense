       So.   Today.   Hm.   Well....   Was awoken at 9:00 sharp. Told I had a half hour to get up and get ready. Ready you may ask? Well, your answer will have to wait. I'm not there yet. So. 9:05 rolls around. I'm too cozy. 9:15. I'll only take a few minutes to get ready. 9:18. There's still plenty of time. 9:20. Fuck, I really should get up. So quick as a bunny on cocaine, I groggily (got to love the&nbsp;disagreeing adjectives!) made my way to get dressed. Down stairs I go, expecting to be hauled out to my dads "workshop" [corner of a storage space facility] to lift heavy things, I realize he's left. (by the way, that was what I had to get ready for.. if your aforementioned question was still anxiously awaiting an answer) Needless to say, I wasted very little time going back to my air-conditioned room to read, happily.   10:30 rolls around. NOW it's time to go haul around heavy things. Ugh.   Blahblahblah   We go down toll farm rd (Is that the right road?) make it to the storage space and I am put to work. And by put to work, I obviously entail standing around while my dad mumbles to himself trying to figure out what needs to get done first, or rather, what I'm capable of helping with). After much standing around, in a moderately cool warehouse might I add, I'm handed an electric drill. Hah! Drilling!    Through much painstaking aggravation I succeeded in taking apart a shoddy workbench/table/ thing  my dad had installed. Aggravation? Yes. Who installs screw SIDEWAYS into the least accessible corner of workbench?! ...   Anyways. After drilling for a period of time... the bit fell out. For no reason. So I had to struggle, with what little drill knowledge I have, in reinserting and maneuvering the drill bit into workable condition. I am not meant to handle wood and tools.    LATER    After a trip or two back and forth from the house and warehouse (Ooo! I forgot to mention! I got to dust off lights! ... Carbon dust is disgusting to deal with on a humid day.) my dad decided to rig up his big-expensive-what-the-hell-does-it-actually-do-?! machine with many red straps. Once done, he decides to borrow the fork lift at the warehouse. With a lot of vrooot-beep-beeep-beep-beep-rrrrraaaaa-vrrroot-vroot-vrooot he maneuvered over to the machine... followed by more fork-lift noises and we had it to the infamous  loading dock!  That's when things got worrisome. Putting the straps to the test. [Ahem. Because the dock is so high, and my dads truck rather far below it, it was only logical that he lift the several thousand pound machine up by the little red straps and place it in the truck.] Aside from the straps stretching about 2 and a half feet when trying to lift the machine of doom, nothing exciting happened. *sigh*   After that there was just much more lifting, grunting, pulling, shoving, strapping and unstrapping to be had once we got the thing back home... with no forklift to help anymore.   Then I spent my day looking at stuff in JoAnn Fabrics. [I've begun constructing a mahvelous orange corduroy bag. i've got a new thing for  orange.  It's weird.] So there's that. My mom and I proceeded over to WalMart thereafter and found a guy in the most (intriguingly) revolting shirt ever. Perhaps some of you have seen Chris Giorgio's highlighter yellow shirt? This was highlighter orange... It must have had battery packs to shine as brightly as it did. GOD. It was a sight to see, I suppose. And what made it worse (two things, really) was the fact that the man wearing it was in his 60's, and the shirt had those tacky fake-wood buttons on it. Not good combinations, let me tell you.    &nbsp;  People need to be less uptight about porn and sex.   My labelmaker is the man. Anyone want labels?    Playing spit over a low coffee table results in poor back conditions.   Sprite Remix: BerryClear is the essence of skittles.   I want to go to Boston. I want to visit Kristina.   I want to go to AZ (sooner). I want to visit Chad (longer).   My travel toothbrush..was dusty.. even though it was in a plastic case.   Next week will be boring.   I am going to buy presents. For a certain someone. (Wink) So secretive!   I'm liking purple less and less by the day.   I need  real  chocolate. Not pansy commercial franchise chocolate.   I am  so  demanding.       &nbsp;

Okay, nough Spanish.&nbsp; (I know it's often&nbsp;"nuff" but it really should be nough, seeing as how the "word" is "enough" minus the "e.")  &nbsp;Does anybody else find it kinda rediculous when guys sing in falcetto?&nbsp; Like...on cd's and stuff.&nbsp;   K...I'm gone 4 now!&nbsp;   &nbsp;  Live well and love lots!

       I say no, nay, never! *clap-clap-clap-clap* No, nay, never, no more! *clap-clap* Shall I play wild rover! *clap* No nay, never, no more!    &nbsp;  Medieval Manor last night was wonderful.   The peasant man, Squint, was attractive. He reminded me of Jay Buckley. Coincidentally, Maggie turns to me and says "He looks like your type!".... Moments later "Who's my type?? I have ears like a hawk!", followed by me laughing and blushing profusely.   Twas funnier this go around. The crowd got more into it.    &nbsp;  A six course meal is just too much, really.    &nbsp;  This time I got a doggie bag to go. The bag had dogs on it, and a printed song. Haha.   Let's all go there when we're 21!     &nbsp;  I'll fix this up later, I'm out to look for fabric and patterns for a skirt... G'day to you all.

       Oh be-still my beating heart!   He  called me  by phone at 11:30!    He never calls!     EVER!    My life is complete now.    &nbsp;  And why is it that the later hours of the evening bring out&nbsp;energy?    &nbsp;   Tonight at dinner:    &nbsp;&nbsp; Dad: "Remember when I bought you that bird wing?"   Myself: [over a mouthful of corn] "Mmph."   &nbsp;&nbsp; Dad: "Do you know where that is?"   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [upon leaving the table I saunter up to my room, find the owl wing, and place it on my dad's desk]   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dad: "I walked into my office and thought there was a dead rat on my desk!"   Myself: [smirk]    &nbsp;  Alright.   It was amusing for  me .    &nbsp;  I was just going to type out an irish-style song&nbsp;I&nbsp;made up&nbsp;in my mind about being perky and happy... but then realized you'd never get the jist.    &nbsp;  I have a  very  large bug trying to fly around my desk lamp. In what manner will I take care of this matter? Get my dad to swat it to death. Huzzah!

       Another tedious day.   Type, pause, read, repeat.    &nbsp;  Quite simply this has been the wettest summer to my memory. It really is very depressing, and I'm not even a summer person.    &nbsp;  I feel so out of sorts. I stayed up until 3 o'clock last night. ( When was the last time  that  happened? ) Then, to my utter suprise and dismay, awoke at 10:30. My body refuses to let me sleep regardless of my mind repeating over and over "There's nothing to do in this house!". So I continue to alternate between transcribing, reading, and staring at my pleasant beeswax candle.    &nbsp;  I'm beginning to dislike how boredom brings greater expectations for a new day. Then that day arrives, and somehow, hopes aren't accounted for, and your mood is left indistinguishable from the pensive thoughts of the day before.    &nbsp;  So my hopes are sitting in the back of my mind, creeping up whenever I stop to sit and wonder what there is to do next. Time works in odd ways.. sometimes too lethargic, sometimes too hasty.&nbsp; Too eager for the future and dreading the shadowy implications of it all, while in the meantime I sit and write entries about the present being unsatisfactory. Impossible to please-- Yes, yes I am.  &nbsp;

       Another uneventful day. How grand! What better way to celebrate the passion of boredom than to create a blog? You tell me.    &nbsp;  I've sat in this chair for the better part of the day, aside from a brief and fleeting trip to the supermarket to buy light cream ( How can one live without the proper accoutrements for coffee? ) and a bottle of lotion ( Burt's Bees; Milk and Honey. Absolutely divine ).     &nbsp;  Also, I cleaned my room. And by clean, I mean straightened up. Things shifted from one shelf to a drawer, and from desk to box. Orderly looking on the outside, but really only hidden piles of junk. Not to say that all my junk is stowed away, but at least now it's... slightly better.    &nbsp;  Tomorrow looks to be as interesting as today.    &nbsp;  I would highly recommend the book  The Enchantments of Flesh and Spirit  by Storm Constantine, but I'm only a short way into it. So far it proves to be excellent reading, though.    &nbsp;  I wish I had more to say for a first post.. Oh well, I suppose.    &nbsp;  Thank you and goodnight.

      This just came to me: You know how your parents always make a big deal about the first word you ever said? Could a person's first word have any effect on the type of person they turn out to be? I wonder...  &nbsp; I know for a fact that my first word was "shit." No joke.  What was your first word? Let's compare!

       Why do I constantly feel let down?   Are my expectations too high?   Or have you never been as perfect as my mind portrayed you?    &nbsp;  The streets are uneven and my eyes won't raise.    &nbsp;  Why are the meanings to actions never interpreted correctly?    &nbsp;  Why don't questions have answers?    &nbsp;  One of those days... (weeks? months?) where nothing is sufficient and everything only seems to get worse.   Every day spent leaning towards the next.   Is one solid hope worth more than a carload of certainties?   Tonight I'd beg to differ.    &nbsp;  Nothing is sustainable    I'm only delaying inevitability.    &nbsp;  Why is it we only miss the past?   [why can't heartfelt kisses make another person open their eyes]   I wish I could move my eyes elsewhere

       Well kids, let you be the first to hear,      Jordan and I are no longer a couple. Again.         Being worthless isn't so bad, right?

       I was pleasently surprised to find out that the service that I had to sing at today was only 30 minutes, but I still got paid 100. This has added to my happiness level. YES!      Anyway, it's been a while since I last typed something here. Just letting you all know I'm alive.  I know you're all disappointed, sorry ;^p.      Psyched for Florida!         Anyways, I've got to go. I'll talk to you all later.

       Aren't we just the talkative group.         Schedule has been flip flopped.. changed around.. I finally have to start worrying about college.      It's funny how things catch you off gaurd. The things you've expected the most. I wish this were as easy for me.      And of course.. Senior Pictures...       I wish this were easier.    But then again, I wish for a lot of things.      If only I weren't just being shrugged off...
