      I  wrap my arms around his waist and close my eyes, resting my head on his shoulder. I can hear him breathing deeply and feel the rhythm of his heartbeat. His hands move up and down my back, making it arch toward him. I raise my head at this touch, looking him in the eye. I run my tounge between my lips slowly and smile moving my head back to his shoulder.  My nose brushes against his neck and I lick below his jaw. One hand reaches up and turns my head to face him and he kisses me for a long time, our lips pressing up together and snaking tounges, pushing hard to feel the other's mouth. My grip around his waist tightens and my legs weaken. One hand still at my neck, the other supporting my weight at the small of my back.   He lifts me up and he moves his hand up my shirt, undoing my bra and laying me on his bed. I kiss his neck urgently and move his hands up his sides, but he stops me, kissing me softly.   He moves his hand up my shirt, using his thumb to brush my nipples, making them hard.   (Sitting up, he undoes my shirt, slowly lifting it past my arms and throws it somewhere behind him; doing the same thing for my bra. he looks at me, slowly running his hands on my sides. I squirm and arch my back upward and squeeze my eyes closed. He tells me to open them and as soon as I do, he kisses me deeply. His hand moves around to my front, brushing my breast and softly pulling on it. Breaking the kiss he moves down my body biting my nipple softly, pulling at it with his teeth. I moan loudly and squirm as he nibbles on my breast.)  Shit. And now I have to go. I'll be gone until Thursday, and I'll finish this then. (hehe) I am going to show it to Erich, however. And he can add something if he wants. I'll give him the password as well.   Sage  PS: See you Thursday Erich. I love you.

      Hello again. That empty feeling has washed away with the shower. I might even get the nerve to show Erich this. Maybe later.   As it is, I'm showered and clean and wearing nothing but black clothes that fit nice and feel good.   I talked to him briefly a couple of times today. He seems fine. I panicked and wrote him an email when I was feeling like crap. Not as much anymore though. Still kinda feeling scared. I don't know what of, or if it has to do with Erich at all. But for the most part, I'm not as anxious anymore. But I probably shouldn't have sent that email anyway. It was... brash. And slightly gimped.   I've got to go though. Mother Dearest summons. *cringes*  Sage

      Hello again. I'm sick. So I came downstairs to the computer hoping for cooler air and maybe seeing that Erich was online. He was for a second. But went offline before I could say hi.   I don't think I explained much about how me and him... "got together" I suppose.  urlLink E-Spin the Bottle  started it all. Last summer I was babysitting for my cousins and was terribly bored, being stuck in the house all-frigan-day I went to every site I possibly could to fill my time. And I think that's how I met him. Oooo... Lets see if I can find the first thing I sent him. *waits* Heh. I was basically wanting to scare him off... So anyway. Here it is:    Subject:  Date:  Message:      Hello hello!   Jun 25 2003 3:47PM  YAY! A Mutual Match! Happy happy! SING FOR THIS IS TRULY A JOYOUS DAY!   OK that's enuf of that.   Hi. My name is Sage and "greasewheel" is an anagram for my real name. If you don't know what anagram is, I don't either, so don't ask me. I'm going to my cousins for July in the summer and I'm running away from all my problems in Rural-Town-Canada. lol, it would be funny if it wasn't so true. lol. (I'm that annoying person who can't tell any good jokes and still has the nerve to laugh at all of mine) lol. See what I mean?   So.... I really have absolutly no way to start this conversation...   OH! I KNOW I KNOW! What is your favorite way to start a conversation?   Peace  Sage   PS: If I didn't scare you off with this one, you're one tough cookie.      And thus, his reply:      Subject:  Date:  Message:      Hello hello!   Jun 25 2003 10:02PM  YOU, My friend are the most interesting person i've met for a long time and i'd love to continue further conversations with you if you have it i'd suggest adding me to msn my adress is "(lalalala)" i'll talk to you there   later days   Erich   So anyway, that's how it all started, but I think it was awhile before we actually talked. I know we were talking by November... Probably late October is when we first started talking.  Anyway, that's about it.   Shit. This empty feeling sucks when he's not around. Well, as around as he can be. I get all worried and nervous and now just... I'm questioning everything.  Especially now. Why now anyway?   *smiles* But then, that has nothing to do with loving him. Only with him loving me back. Doesn't seem like such a happy thought. But it is. I can reaffirm that I am in love with the simple thought of being near him.   Sage

      Hi. Well, this is my first entry. *bows* And perhaps its something I will never use again. I've been using  urlLink Diaryland  for awhile... but then I'm using a paper journal.   I didn't want to go back to Diaryland again. Though it's wonderful... I've been there. And written. And what I've read of my own diary eats away at the remaining influence I have over my mind. Like mold on old food. Hopefully, my entries will suit me better here. Like good wine, instead of bad cheese.   Not that I ever liked wine.   My paper journal is too open for some things... And I know that nobody will read this. Nobody that I don't wish to. If I cover my tracks. Since of course, it's on the internet, the source of all usless information, the source of endless streaming people, nobody will read it, right?   Anyway. This journal is about loving Erich.   Who is Erich now. Erich is a boy from Yellowknife. And I am in love with him. And whenever I think about that... I get this happy-warm feeling and a nagging thought at the back of my mind.   The nagging thought says I've deceived myself. That I'm being a stupid little girl and making a fantasy in my head, just like when I was little and would pretend to be strong. You see, I've never met Erich. Only over Messenger and email have I talked to him.   But I... No matter what that little thought says, no matter how much it ruins that happy-warm feeling... I am in love with Erich.   Sage

       This is different than what I'm supposed to be writing about in here. It has nothing to do with Erich, only my own doubts about what is reality. Media can be... Persuading. I'm not talking about advertisements and mainstream, newsroom, Iraq, Bush, Spears, hate crimes, terrorism, celebrity nonsense rhymes. Media, in the rawest sense of the word. A transfer of thought. The transfer of a feeling.    &nbsp;  To people.   To a person.   To me.     &nbsp;  Art. The thought that reality is only perception. The feeling that I'm not alone in my struggle with acceptance of this society. But then what is reality? Or perhaps I should say what is my reality? Perception is such a difficult thing to understand.     &nbsp;  Am I in love because I wish to be in love? Or that I perceive myself to be, thus I am? Am I really in that much control? And who is in control of what I perceive?     &nbsp;  I'm getting goosebumps.    My glass of milk is almost empty.   Theres a bible in front of me.    I was the last person to touch that pen.    My legs are crossed.    I think I've gained weight.     &nbsp;  What the fuck is happening with me? What question do I want an answer to? What am I searching for?     &nbsp;  ..... And I suppose the ultimate question of my young life is overpowering that question. What do I want to become? What am I searching for?    &nbsp;  Sage    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       I want&nbsp;him to kiss my neck.&nbsp;Come up behind me and suprise me, wrap his arms around my waist and bite my ear lobe and smell my soap-hair. I want to put my arms across his and feel his tounge licking my jaw.     &nbsp;   I want him to hold me tight against his body so I can't turn around... I want him to whisper in my ear how much he wants me. I want him to undo my pants and push his hand under my panties... His fingers&nbsp;searching uncomfortably until he finds the spot. i want him to slide a finger in and then another, moving in and out and pushing forward inside me. I want his hand to move up my shirt to find that I didn't wear a bra today. *smiles* To play with my nipple until it gets hard and run the palm of his hand over it. I want him to&nbsp;push me against him and his cock (oh god that word is sexy, cock) so I can feel it&nbsp;pushing back at&nbsp;me. I want him to pull his fingers out of me and tell me to suck on them. And I want to suck on them as he sucks my neck. I want to suck on them like I suck on my finger when I'm horny and need something in my mouth. Pushing the fingers&nbsp;with my tounge&nbsp;so that they curve and and conform to the roof of my mouth, gulping all the saliva and juice *blushes* to the back of my throat to be swallowed.     &nbsp;   I want him to turn me around quickly and kiss me. Push on my tounge like I did his fingers. Wrap one arm around my waist and pull me tightly against his body, while the other runs through my hair and down my neck, across some newly formed hickeys.     &nbsp;   I&nbsp;want him to pull away from me and smile, opening the door as I do my pants back up and lead me out by the hand to wherever the hell he wants to take me.&nbsp;      ... &nbsp;   holy.... That got a bit more kinky than I meant it to. *smiles* I hope its not a bad thing. I have many more fetishy fantasies that are much *cough* worse than that. Like my little... submissive quirk I have...... *blush* Though if you read hard enough, you see a bit of that in these thoughts as well...     &nbsp;   But reading hard is alot of work. are you sure you're up to it, proverbial person? Proverbial because if theres someone writing, it's assumed that someone reads the garbage they put out. hehe.     &nbsp;   Oooooo... I want someone pushing down on me. That made my stomach turn over...   &nbsp;   Anway. Back to whatever the hell I was talking about. Erich. Erich erich erich erich erich erich. *smiles*     &nbsp;   Oh dear. Now I'm thinking too much. I better leave.     &nbsp;   --Sage     &nbsp;   PS: "I want to mount you" -- Anchorman    PPS: I've had this weird&nbsp;thought about shopping and buying bondage pants with Erich. (Not pants used for bondage, pants with buttons and zippers and chains and whatnot) I hate shopping. Weird...

       No Erich yet... I feel so stupid caring about this kinda stuff. Its like I need constant attention. But I don't. I don't I don't I don't. So nah.     &nbsp;  I've been thinking so much. Thinking of later. Thinking of when I can call him or go to the movies with him... Make mistakes with him... Hold him.    &nbsp;  I was working yesterday... There was a couple that came in and chatted with the supervisors for thirty, forty minutes or so. Then went to order. I was at the cash register, behind the counter... The guy was standing&nbsp;behind of the girl, a little close. He must have been a head taller than her. hmmm...&nbsp;They were both looking at the menu and his hands went to the sides of her head then down to her shoulders, massaging a bit. then just kind rubbed the tops of her arms before crossing&nbsp;his arms across his chest.     &nbsp;  It wasn't a "turn on" so to speak. Or even that sexy. I don't think the girl really thought the touching was apropriate from the way she acted. But it was subtle, if she did mind, I don't think she cared all  too  much.     &nbsp;  kinda weird, huh? Just that thought kinda stayed.&nbsp;The movements involved were just without thought. &nbsp;Absent. I wonder if I could ever get that point with someone. ... And you know which someone I'm talking about. *smiles*     &nbsp;  Maybe we'll end up at the same school, or in the same city. Maybe even a residenc-- well. Nevermind. I hate when people tell me their wedding plans when they don't have a boyfriend. This falls under the same catagory.     &nbsp;  But I can say. If we do find eachother... That I want that to be us. I want us to be able to have tenderness. To have making out not be something we'd just do for kicks. But something that's more involved than tounges and hands.     &nbsp;  Anyway... Maybe I can't say that?    &nbsp;  I love you Erich   -Sage

       Here's my thoughts. I know this is supposed to be about loving Erich and my thoughts on him... So I don't think I should ... Veil my thoughts to make him ... I don't know. Un-worried.     &nbsp;  He shouldn't be worried. And neither should I. But I am, and will always be, eventually.     &nbsp;  Today I don't feel so well. this morning... I must admit was... spectacular. but tonight. I want to feel arms around me. I want to feel protected from the shit of today.    &nbsp;  And I know I can't have that.     &nbsp;  And then... Erich was online. And it was neato-spectacular. the feelings I got when I saw his name were sweet.&nbsp;And I talked to him for all of-- what-- ten minutes? and he left. gone. As fast as he came in...     &nbsp;  That's all I have.    &nbsp;  Sage

       Ohhhh my. I just had the most wonderful ....    hehe. And ohhh my. It was wonderful. I woke up this morning and my legs were wrapped around my blankets and I was thinking of Erich and I suddenly got this really good feeling. I thought of sex.     I started moving my hips on the blankets and got very  very  horny. I mean... Frig. in a second I could go from relaxed and half asleep to THAT. (mind you I was still half asleep) And ohhh... I was thinking how easy sex would be on a foamy*, (thats what my bed is partially made on) and I started pushing faster... And oh my god I don't think I could ever describe how I felt. It wasn't an orgasm... just ohh... dear.     And all of this happened in a span of less than ten seconds. Then I just fell back asleep. I'm not quite sure how, but lets just say it was a very nice sleep. When I woke up again I spent the good portion of the hour thinking of Erich and being on top of him. (To note: I had perfect clarity on the issue. Meaning I didn't  think  anything that would be... uncomfortable for either of us, physically or mentally... if he was really there) Which made the thoughts even MORE sexy for some reason.     It was kind of a release for me. It felt tremendously good and concidering the pressure I've been under, the lack of Erich being online, and lack of anything terribly fun going on.     I didn't touch myself at all. I find when I do, it makes me feel dirty and I  rarely &nbsp;even start to feel that orgasm thing start&nbsp;anyway... Unless Erich is there. At which point it doesn't feel dirty but I generally get really close to a climax but it almost... feels too good to continue. So I stop and the feeling leaves.     This though.&nbsp; This was a different kind of feeling that I couldn't possibly describe.... So I won't try. But I will say it felt wonderful. And I'll be feeling the effects of it for the rest of the day. *smiles*    I've gtg. I hope I'll ttyl later Erich.    Sage     *I've often thought that sex was alot of work and tiring *winks* so that, combined with the fact I was half asleep is where the thought came from

      I miss Erich. I haven't talked to him. He was online and I was gone... I missed him by ten minutes. Ten freaking minutes.  I... have so much I want to say. Like how I ... never mind.   This is starting to wear thin on me. I want to see him so much. I feel like a little kid in a car ride. Theres no point in asking if I'm there yet, because I don't know where I'm going. I hope to god Erich is there too.   I'm angry. I was angry... at a stupid tv show and I wanted to cry, and i did. And I wanted erich here and he wasn't. ... I hate that. But it wasn't just the tv show anyway.   So I told someone else my troubles, after much...deliberation.  and though he was also far away, he offered me a platonically inclined hug. But...  I have a feeling, that what I need... is a real hug. That I can stay in and be all yay-i'm-hugging-someone-woo-hoo-party-on-(!!!)-sweet. But you see, the only person I could give a hug to like that is Erich.   The last time I gave a hug to someone else like that...I was terribly sad and he... well he wasn't. (He ended up grabbing my boob and something popped up...) And I can't really trust other people anymore, partially because of that.   So it's just Erich.  And I sure would love to talk to him about now... Or feel his arms around my waist.     ....     -Sage

       You know what I would love to do? Have a shower with Erich. I don't think I could stand it... It would be too incredibly sexy.   But anyways. I've been talking about those thoughts too much, I think. hehe.   In my mind though, I'm much better at explaining these thoughts than others. ... Anyone that would read this might think that I've just tricked myself, and that I'm a slut. Not that I care about what people would think, but I want to make it super clear that... I don't, wait I do... That I lust for Erich  beCAUSE  I love him.   And though I have my kinky little fantasies... Most of the time my real fantasies go like this:      Erich has his arms wrapped around me we're still for hours, laying on a blanket and being very warm     or:      Today me and Erich hung out with a bunch of friends. It was pretty cool; we went and played pool (etc)     or even:      Today me and Erich got into a fight. Errrgh. It was so dumb. I think I said something I shouldn't have.     Get the picture? I could've gone into a lot more detail, but I wanted to make my point without getting sidetracked.   I want to have imperfect moments with Erich. I know this because I think about these imperfect moments just as much as the fantasies. I'm sure fighting with Erich wasn't fun, or hanging out with friends was awkward at one point or another, or even those seemingly "perfect" moments will have their downfalls. And that makes everything so much more interesting.   --Sage   PS: See? I'm not so good at explaining these thoughts. Told yah so.   PPS: hey. Maybe sex will be not so perfect at first either. I'm sure we'll need lots and lots of practice, (if we ever get to that point.)

      You know, sometimes Erich is hard to love. *smiles* I'm just joking you know.... For the most part anyway. Sometimes he has a bad day, and I just want him to stop having a bad day. lol, and I can't just  do  that.   But thats one of my faults, not his.    *happy sage*  I'm his darling. his love. His muse... *smiles* I love him...  Sage

      Some things turn me on like that. *flicks a switch*  I was thinking... I was getting fitted for a miniskirt today for my work. (don't ask) And I'm really scared of being  looked  at so when the person asked, I told her I wanted it two inches above the knee. Which, by the way, isn't very mini.   So I told someone this, just a few minutes ago. He then said, "aww, it's not the seski kind?" (apparently, seski means sexy) Now, this is someone I have no sexual attraction to what-so-ever. But when he said this, all I could think about was... Someone thinking I was sexy. *smiles*  Erich has told me this a few times... That I'm sexy. *smiles* And I'm not sure what his definition actually means, but I know I can turn him on. *shivers in delight* And THAT is a major turn on.   *giggles* Its one thing to feel sexy... It's quite another to actually be sexy. And to turn someone on. It makes me feel all giggly and (dare I say it) kinda school-girlish.  Which I suppose turns back into miniskirts.   And then that turns into me wanting Erich to see me in a miniskirt. A *real* one, that you have to keep crossing your legs and adjusting yourself, to keep your panties from showing. *smiles* Not that I'd try too hard.   Lets think about that for a minute... of his hand running up my leg...Resting on my inner thigh.... close...so so close. his thumb moving back and forth from my bare skin onto my panties...flicking.... and rubbing...  Or even better. me sitting across his lap with my special miniskirt, rubbing myself on the rough denim and feeling his... exitement grow, making it push and  press  on my pussy.   Holy fuck... I am so horny right now... and hot. as in heat. Heat!!... my stomach, and back are just aching to be touched... *smiles* They're so warm.... and my hands are so cold...  Not to mention certain swollen parts...  I love you Erich, And I wish you could touch me so bad... Sage

      You know I was really really _ _ _ _ _  last night. So horny. I just want Erich to be online so I can tell him all my thoughts.   And I mean... ALL my thoughts.  The last time we talked, he decided to put me in cuffs and rope *wink* That was so nice... God, I want him to press into me...   PRESS. that word is so sexy right now. and oh god... I want his stomach to  press  into mine. and his hands to  press  on my back. So he can  press  up on me. His lips to  press  on mine, my tounge to  press  in his mouth.   Fuck that is so awesome.   I feel so sexy today. If you may know, it's a rare occurance, because usually I feel... well, not so sexy. but today... my legs a shaved all the way up and I'm wearing tight pants and a pretty "form-fitting" (hehe) shirt with buttons down the front.   ANNND I'm so clean... and warm... and sexy. *smiles*  And if Erich was here I could  press  onto him... and... mmmmmm.... *smiles*  hehe. I've gtg.   Sage

      Hello. *smiles*   I'm not feeling that great again. I can't sleep, for one. But anyway. I'm back. And hoping to talk to Erich. ... Hoping anyway.   What a wonderful comfort it would be to know where he is sometimes. It sounds dumb, but... Especially when I'm sick, and have nothing better to do, I often wonder where he is, or how he's feeling. Or I imagine he's curled up next to me.  It's sounds slightly creepy. And a bit past slightly.   Anyway. I'm going to go before I go crazy on this thing. Sleepy Sage needs to go  Sage

      I'm not quite back yet, but I figured I'd update a bit. I think one week? Anyway. I can't stay mad at Erich too long, even though I still want him to explain... Alot.  This morning I had to pack up to go to yet ANOTHER camp. I'm staying the night at my house and going to Bellview in the morning. But for some reason I couldn't quite wake up. I ended up being really dumb and just laid there and wrote for an hour or so. I wasn't writing constantly, but what I did write about was Erich. I won't go any farther with that because ... yeah. Public computer. But things were very.... uhmn..... idealistic. I had no worries about "my-story-isn't-plausable" or "would-I-really-do-that" or the general nervousness I get when I write about Erich.  Not that Erich makes me nervous. Quite the contrary. Point in case: this morning. Thinking of him usually makes me less stressed or nervous about things. It just kind of... well... I'm contradicting myself.  Fuck! I'm late for class. Bye.

       Wheee! I'm at my gramma's house for a short time, and in less than an hour will be on the road to Red Deer, City of Nothingness. ... I'm trying to be really hyper so I stop thinking about it, but it really isn't working.       I cried yesterday. It was not fun. I'm worried about Erich, and it's something I should be worried about. I wish I was shallow and didn't care about these things. Hurting kinda isn't that great... I was poking myself with a pin (lol) It's the closest I'll get to cutting I guess. If suicide is a cry for help, whats this? A wimper?       It's alright though, I'm just... going to ignore it? No... I can't do that... I'm going to try to understand. Try to see and then maybe I can do more than hurt myself with a safety pin.       .....................      I'm so scared...      Erich...      Terribly sad and need lots of icecream,   Sage
