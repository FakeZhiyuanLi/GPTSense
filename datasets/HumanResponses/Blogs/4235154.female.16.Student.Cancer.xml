      I had church band practice and it was very fun. my old classmates from catholic school were there and I have not seen them in forever. I also was having fun messing around on the drums because i had never herd the song befor so I had no idea what i was doing. however everyone else had no idea. I like vitamin C. I like blogging it's fun. I love not caring about proper english rules. can you believe this. Just me myself and God.  I also like words to a song. if you read my writing you will see I use phrases alot. I still remeber when 30 was old. when he had to go. I think my typing is improving. just to let you know i write and then delete and write something else till i get bourd with it and then i post it. can hotdogs really call on the phone or do they grow on vines like strawberry wine? I got off track. very sorry. so any way I was in church playing on the drums and it was fun. this love has taken its toll on me . oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oooh. That was harlyous ha ha! he he he! can you have more fun in a room with nothing but yourself a bed and a computer becouse I can. if i can just see you tonight.I love writing what ever come to mind. tonight. I am done                                         with hope

      I am done complaining. I love walkin onbroken glass. Hello world I don't know who can read this but i am very happy.  blue what is blue if it were a number. i think it would have to be a sweet number like 2 or 6 or 12. no blue is 16.   is this marroon or a burnt red? not sure. this is of course a 9 and it remindes me of a bad move. Is  talking on the phone fun or do you  say what needs to be done & go?  I love green. not green. lime green. no florestent green. it is wonderful. I will have a room with walls this color some day.   walkin on walkin on broken glass. I like photography. this color remineds me of photos. why can some have no choise in matters that matter most. I love rockapella.   is this brown or red? computers can be weird  . This color is depressing and so is Vanessa Carlton well not ordinary day. I hate bad movies like ones with bloody violents. I love comedys. I say God made bad things make us feel bad for a reason and he made laughing feel good for a reason. I love feeling good and i hate feeling scared or sad. why is it that right after i am really mad i am very happy?   is a fudgecicile frozen chocolate milk? mom thinks so. And i miss you. can you fall into the sky or dose it have really good drums. I hope I can leave soon i really want to God does not care if spelling is good he cares if you smile. do you smile and is it for a reason or do it because you can't help it do you like crusty rino tush? I like biuld me up buttercup ( that is Jacob giserd sprinkles) some guitar can get really bad. moven to the grooven is an awsome line play that funky music right boy.                                             sorry i have a headach    I am done   .
