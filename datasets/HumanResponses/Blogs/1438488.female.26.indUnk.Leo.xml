       The Snozzberries Taste Like Snozzberries   At lunch today, the conversation turned to an analysis of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory as a reflection of 70s-era morality combined with the hallucinogenic drug subculture: "You could see how people would want to get high and watch it over and over again." "But its so oppressively P.C., complete with class-based struggles and tired morality lessons" me:  "I like a movie in which the central premise is based on chocolate."  This movie was also responsible for a large percentage of my childhood nightmares: "Theres no earthly way of knowing which direction we are going. Theres no knowing where we're rowing, or which way the rivers flowing. Is it raining? Is it snowing? Is a hurricane a blowing? Not a spec of light is showing, so the danger must be growing. By the fires of hell a glowing. Is the grizly reaper mowing? YES! The danger must be growing, for the rowers keep on rowing! And they're certainly not showing ANY SIGNS THAT THEY ARE SLOWING!" Now I'm 24 and it sounds like a comment on life.  Even scarier...

       I'd rather be in palo alto...   Why are there always abandoned cars on the side of the highway?  I imagine these people, in the middle of their morning commute, deciding that they don't like where they're going.  They slam on the brakes (inciting rage in at least four other highway drivers), pull their cars into the emergency lane (surely this qualifies) and calmly exit their vehicles.  They look around for a moment and then head off into a different direction, perhaps someplace sunny... or someplace with grapevines.  Today a friend of mine told me that those cars are probably stolen, stripped, and carelessly dumped by criminal elements.  I don't like his story as much.

       Thunder and Jazz   All this morning I've been humming Nina Simone - the sensuous honey of melancholy veined smoky with lust.  I haven't thought of her in a while.  She only shows up after nights of turmoil, when disorder fits right in with dinner and desire and the lonely morning light.  Hers is a voice that can set things right, not by cheering up but by empathizing.  Is it true that all we want is for someone to feel what we feel?  Seems much too simple and unbearably difficult.  This is one of those days when nothing gets done.  A thunderstorm is piling up in the sky, so everything at work is dim... dimness interrupted by the criminal offense of fluorescent lighting.  I hope the storm holds off for a few more hours.  I like the electric feeling in the air.  The whole city is holding its breath.  All the 9-to-5ers are just waiting to bemoan the flooding and the traffic and the general inconvenience of it all.  I like the edge-of-the-seatness that precedes a good storm.  The suspense is almost agonizing.  I hope it lasts.  Nonetheless, it promises to be a good spectacle.  Something to rescue this otherwise non-descript grayness.

       On Photography   A hundredth of a second here, a hundredth of a second there -- even if you put them end to end, they still only add up to one, two, perhaps three seconds, snatched from eternity. -- Robert Doisneau  Rest in peace, HCB.  Here's to a life uncommon.
