      I am feeling guilty today. I returned home after Ramaiah, having established that the magnitude of homework they asked us to do would necessitate more time than usual. Conversely, I have only done an insignificant amount of studying today and consequently, the mortified conscience. I comprehend now that staying at home, with the exception of a proper reason, is an absolute misuse of time. It is more worthwhile to be at college and at least pretend to be studying than not studying at all. I will study all afternoon and all evening. But I could have done more. Koteshwar Rao was introducing us to Co-ordinate Geometry today. While he was doing so, a girl, who sits right in the first row, began drifting off into sleep every two minutes. After tolerating this for quite some time, taking into account his impatience, Koteshwar Rao finally reacted. As a surprising replacement to what he would have done a year ago, or so we have heard, he just asked the girl to go home if she was drowsy. He suggested that she shift to the evening batch if the morning timings were difficult for her.  He told us, while she was leaving, that age was finally beginning to take its toll on him. He told us that if the same thing were to happen a year ago, he would have slapped the girl in the face devoid of a moment’s waver. It is strange how things ceaselessly continue changing. At this point a line from Anita Desai’s book ‘A Village by the Sea’ comes to mind. One of the central characters, Mr. Panwallah tells the protagonist, Hari, that things change, they always change. “The wheel never stops, it keeps turning…”  You’d consider me inane for saying such things, but I abhor change. It makes me feel very insecure and ambiguous. Guns n Roses have dissolved. School, once thought of as an eternal part of life, is over now. Friends have moved apart. Chickoo Bua’s elder sister is to marry soon and I hate the fact that it’s actually going to happen. My great-grandmother died, my grandmother will die, my parents will move to another world. My friends will die one day. One day I will also leave the world behind and proceedto meet my maker. In a few million years from now, the Sun will perish and with that, Earth will cease to exist. Everything is going to change, to end. The future is frightening. It seems that the only thing left that will never change is the fact that death is certain. I reminisce my father once saying that, only those people who didn’t do the best they could lament about their past and attach more importance to it than is due. I am one of those people. Strive as I may to get over it, the past seems stuck to me like glue. I keep saying to myself that I would undo all the things that went off beam; change my past, if I had just one wish. Needless to say, that is impossible, as the saying goes: “the hand writes, and having writ…moves on…”

       The reason for the delayed arrival of this blog entry is my new timetable. It gives me the necessary amount of time to write, only on Sundays (an occasional few may, however, be posted as and when free time is available).  I saw Mission Impossible 2 last night. Bloody awesome. Who cared that it was on till 3 A.M.? I have a holiday today! My father came over to Hyderabad on the 25th, before embarking on his trip to Europe. We had our father-son talks yet again. This time it made more sense. He suggested a technique of problem solving to me, it has me all excited. I'm going to try it today! It's called the 'Do or Die' technique. It's a very simple and easy to go about technique actually. The modus operandi requires one to pick up the concerned problem and then sit at it till it's solved. Till eternity if required. And if that fails you can jump of the terrace and end your life. Of course he said it in a more easy to accept manner. The week gone by may be appositely labeled as one of the most shocking weeks in football history. Greece defeated France in the semifinals of the Euro 2004, Portugal (no, this isn't a typo). 'Shocking upsets' has been the idiosyncratic feature of this tournament. Joinig France in their early exit were Germany, Italy, Spain and several other football giants of Europe. If the present situtation remains unchanged then I wouldn't be wrong in anticipating that it will be Greece who will take home the coveted title. I hope I'm proved wrong, though. I'd like to end at that. I haven't much more to write about. Until next Sunday then.

      I'm tired today. Don't know why but I hope I'm not tomorrow. I litteraly slept all the way to Ramaiah. And when I reached class, I bent my head and pretended to ponder over a problem, while actually still sleeping. I'm okay now, the world need not worry. But I guess I'll have to stop writing today, for my fans across the universe, and sleep instead. Sleep so that my aching, tired and drained mind and an equally aching, tired and drained body can recuperate.

      Today was nothing out of the ordinary. I continued with my same daily routine right from when I got up at 3 A.M. For those of you who don't know what occured next- I left the house at 3:50, reached class at 4:15, finished classes by 8:00, bunked college (for the 8th day in a row!), came back home at 8:30 and sat down to compose at 8:50. As usual I shall sleep before I continue my academic pursuits once again, later in the afternoon. However, during the 4:15-8:00 time bracket I noticed something apart from the stuff being taught in class (not the signs you would see in a focused student). Ramaiah's IIT study circle, amidst all it's Nazi concentration camp like treatment towards students, has a very hard to notice amount of comicalness too. I had notice on the first day itself that our coordinator at Ramaiah was a funny person. Not the conventional funny type. He was slightly different. His sorry attempts in appearing strict and saying things to students without any rhyme or reason was what did the trick for him, against his liking maybe. Today Koteshwar Rao outdid him. His hatred towards the authors of our Math book, published by Messrs. Tata Mc Graw and Hill made him sound extremely hilarious today. He called the authors "perfect asses" and called the students who emulate their problem solving techniques even bigger "perfect asses". Maybe the elevated opinion he holds of himself isn't morally right. But his superior intelligence, in a way, frees him from the confines of moral values and gives him a right to be as proud of himself as he likes. Jokes aside, he used his time well, to give us all a valuable lesson today. He told us in a metaphoric way that simply reading solved examples wouldn't make us smarter. The only way we could enhance our mathematical abilities, he told us, was by doing the problems on our own. To make it more lucid he gave us an anecdote about a man who found a pair of trousers in a train coach, while he was traveling. The guy took these 'new' trousers home and decided to wear it to office someday. He was sitting on the edge of his bed, putting on his trousers oneday. But when he got up they came off almost instantly because they didn't fit him (didn't get the moral of the story did you?). He was implying that in a similar manner, if you were to simply read a solved example and attempt an examination, you would fail (get it now?).  In case you are confused I would like to remind you that the title is correct. Mr. Koteshwar Rao does have a very contrasting behavioural pattern. Apart from being a genius mathematician and a mock-all-inferiors type of a funny person, Koteshwar Rao has a short temper, is impatient and becomes furious at the very site of mathematical incompetence. After his 45 minute long stand up comedian act, from out of nowhere, he yelled at two girls and gave Varun another dose of his confidence deflation tonic.  I still like him though. Why? He hasn't asked me a question as yet!

      Yes the time stamp is correct. I was at home writing this early in the morning. I proudly proclaim that I have bunked college yet again, seventh day in a row. Actually the science they teach in college is crap. What they teach at Ramaiah gives you an adequate amount of raw material to ponder over and I don't think it would be right to waste time at college when I can do so much more right in my room! I'm not feeling guilty but it's worth mentioning that today's absence from college was planned. Varun and his geeky friends have also joined the mass bunking movement! Now that the heaviness in my head about bunking college has subsided I would like to move on to things which are more important. One of the most important thing that has happened in the course of the last 24 hours is the eruption of a pimple on my handsome face!(am I to blame for the boredom in my life?). In the hope for remedial action, a spontaneous one I promise not to touch it and just keep washing my face, like Varun suggested, and watch it disappear gradually. And then I will be prepared to show the world my, arhem, beautiful self again (if Phalguni were to read this she'd think I'm gay!). Today's math class at Ramaiah was very enlightening. We did one single previous IIT question for the entire duration of the class, in four different ways! I'm done writing for today. All the excitement with which I took up the task of writing has vanished without a trace now. I think it's time I went to bed (so that I can study all evening and then get up for my classes at 3 in the morning tomorrow!).

      After using the horrible services of Bravejournal.com, and eventually terminating my account with them, today I came across Blogspot.com. Blogspot.com is truly, the most efficient and easy to use web log on the world wide web. Fast loading, easy to post and loads of options make it an A1 category site. Normally, I wouldn't speak so highly of anything as unimportant as a web log provider of all the things in the world, but this deserved special mention. With all the features it offers a user, for free, Blogspot.com gives you little opportunity to complain, none actually. Are you listening Dave@bravenet.com?

      Following is yet another one of my third rate poems:    New Leaf   I'll run away to a place so distant, You'll never hear from me, I'll go into oblivion, You won't have to hide in shame.  I'll go to a place where the world wont force me to follow it's deafening beat, Swallow that which I do not want to eat, A new world that will let me live, let me love, Fly in the blue sky like a carefree dove, A world that won't kill me before I'm born, A world protected, free and untorn.  Wipe your tears, if you now have them, You didn't feel when it mattered back then, I'm gone now, I'm far away, I'm diving into my new world to get the one last thing I lack, A shirt to cover the healing wound of the past on my back.

       The following post was composed on the 23rd of June.   The answer to the frequently asked question 'What's new?' has eternally been 'nothing much'. The answer remains unchanged even if what has taken place in the recent past of one's life is worthy of a mention in the local news. My recent past has not been as important as to find a mention in the newspapers here but it has been way beyond the regular 'nothing much'. Varun, Gautham, Shashanka and I are a bunch of friends who study at Ramaiah. At the end of each morning there, we get into the car and begin our homeward bound journey. Varun, Gautham and Shashanka get off where the common route ends, near a bus stop at Sardar Patel Road.  The 21st was no different as far as the sequence of events was concerned. We got into the car like usual, discussed the day as usual, had a debate on an unimportant issue as usual and then took leave as usual. However, the topic of the debate was one close to my heart. It began as a discussion of my parents' trip to Europe and gradually evolved into one involving the integrity of my father, of civil servants in general.  It happened like this. I was telling the guys about my parents' European retreat when the topic shifted to the cost of the trip. As far as I had known, the trip had made my parents' wallet lighter by around 1.5 lakh. However, Gautham, and to a lesser extent Varun, seemed to be of the opinion that I was hiding from them the fact that the trip must have cost much more than my estimate. In words that are more clear-cut, they were doubting my honesty and hence, doubting my father's integrity. I ignored them, saying to my self that I would shut their mouths after showing them a copy of the advertisement that had all the details of the trip's cost printed on it. With that, I carried on with my day as usual only remembering to place the paper in my bag before going to bed. At the end of the class next morning, I met Gautham and showed him the paper in the car. Varun seemed to be convinced but Gautham kept denying the fact that it cost my folks only a lakh and a half for their holiday. I was angered by his gibberish but I was still in control of my emotions and was also able to subdue my fist's thirst for action. The events gradually began to get serious. From badmouthing each other initially, Gautham and I started getting physical. In a matter of seconds, I was dominating over him and had his specs in my hand.  I did not intend to do anything serious, least of all start a fight. All I wanted him to do was to apologize for doubting the integrity and honesty of my father and say that he would not make a judgment about anyone's moral fiber without knowledge of the facts first. I promised I would return the glasses to him once he had done as I demanded. Gautham had other plans. He was in no mood to deflate his bloated ego. Without warning, he pounced on me and began fighting. His element of surprise was effective considering the fact that a person as feeble as him was able to sneak a couple of punches on my face and a head butt on my nose. I had taken enough. I hit him back and I hit him back hard. He was almost in tears by the time I was done with him. And when I finally let him go, he caught me off my guard and gave me a bite on the arm, thus glorifying his rather cowardly and woman like nature. Consequently, I gave him another round of punches and having had enough I returned his glasses. An inspection of the place where he bit me showed a huge blood clot, the size of his mouth and a little bleeding patch at the centre of it. The ugly sight angered me more than the burning pain the bite caused. However, I decided against causing any further harm to the physically weak and defenseless person that he was. A few more sparks flew before the fight finally ended with him getting out of the car.  I feel sorry for what I did. Nevertheless, I shall not apologize to him. I cannot bear anyone insulting my parents, especially those who doubt the uprightness of my father. Every bit of success that my father has tasted, he deserves. From a middle class background in Patna, he has evolved into one of the greatest success stories ever. Having earned a place in the National Merit List and securing a seat in the I.I.T, to being selected as one of the 50 I.A.S officers chosen from millions of people in the country to getting his PhD, Papa has done it all. He does not deserve to be insulted by some idiot who has neither done as much as him or has minimal chances of doing so in the future. And if someone refuses to respect that and insult such a person I have no intentions of letting him get away without bearing my wrath first. I hope I have made my stance clear. Moving on to certain non-emotional issues, I would like to end by posting my first ever edition of P.O.O.P or 'paragraphs out of place' (cool, right?)-     Ecstasy   Escape from the land of drudgery, Fill our blood stream with ecstasy, Kurt's melody, Lost in the comfort, my eyes are shut, I'm high, as high as the sky.

      Dear Rohit,            Of course I remember you. You mailed around this time last year. I myself stopped by HPS in December and caught up with Mrs. Rajni Gauri Shankar. Anyway, I understand Krishnamurthy is hardly an option these days. Chari was the one who made it worth it. But I wonder how his supporting staff is. To be honest, it's hardly a concern to me now. I think the whole approach to JEE needs a huge revamp.              First things first. Being in Ramaiah, you're surrounded by a hundred idiots. Remember that. Don't let any stupid theories about entrance test marks and seating position interfere with your confidence. You'll make it to IIT if you work hard now and don't let those idiots break you. That's all there is to it. I don't remember what marks I got and how good or bad that total was. I was in the third row and still at the bottom of the class in my first year. So there!              You take care of yourself. Get all these extra ideas out of your head. Leave the others to waste their time theorising about the impact of the colour of your shirt and thickness of your chappals' soles on your rank in the JEE. Just work hard. All will be well. Will be all for now.  Ever yours, Rahul.  p.s: am very much in Hyderabad now. Somehow haven't been able to gather the energy to blog of late. Much has happened. I left IIT. Am on my last trip to Hyderabad. etc. Am on my way to the Washington University in St. Louis for an MS in Computer Science. Let's see when I can blog next. It's heartening that someone actually misses my blog. I was worried about its deterioration!  ===== Maybe the tears that I cry for you drench the greater part of me, Maybe I don't really miss you so much at all. Maybe the number of miles, in sheep, could put mighty Big Apple to sleep, Maybe I could have said what I did over the wall. Maybe I'd fight and hurt myself, who knows, even die for you, Maybe it's what I'll say until the hour of judgement befall. The only holy certainty is that I'll be proud I ever knew you.

      The excitement is wearing off now. It isn't just a day since I last wrote. In fact, it's almost been a week. The next paragraph doesn't necessarily make good reading but what follows it does.  I've stopped using my all time favourite black Cello Finegrip ball pen. Instead I'm using a blue Luxor Pilot pen which comes with a 0.5mm nib (how's that for detail?).  Now if one would care to look closely and try to look for a deeper meaning in that rather insignificant event, he would see that there is more to it than what meets the eye. Dad once told me that change is a consequence of indecisiveness and a miscalculated judgment. Which in more simple terms mean that if you are changing some thing you've stuck to for some time now, you haven't thought hard enough.  Going by the fact that I've: changed the pen I use, changed the look of my site three times in two months, changed my web host thrice in three months and God knows what else, I can easily be labeled as one of the most confused people in the world...   Quite in contrast to the mood I'm in, motivated and cheerful, the skies are as dull and gloomy as ever. What I saw in the sky yesterday was the biggest and darkest cloud I ever saw. However, it's been raining very infrequently. Too infrequently to land us a holiday at Ramaiah.    Coming to Ramaiah, yet again, I am surprised that none of the terrible things that are supposed to take happen is taking place. We aren't being caned, forced into vegetarianism, doing 200 problems a day. Ramaiah is just like a good institute with excellent faculty and a well thought teaching program. It could be something like the 'calm before the storm', but I believe it's the age factor that's creeping in. Koteshwar Rao is not as scary as described to be by Rahul Pratap in his article " urlLink The Personality Slaughter House " and Ramaiah is barely teaching nowadays. But the description of Madhusudan Rao is flawless. He is as rude, mean and sadistic in nature as he was when Rahul was at Ramaiah's IIT Study Circle.  And with that I'd like to conclude before I get over emotional and begin expalining why this post is dedicated to a person as important to me as life itself...some other day maybe.

      This one was written earlier, on the 16th of May, 2004 to be precise. I listened to Cowboys From Hell by Pantera for hours together before writing this down. That should explain the gory theme. PS: This one is really bad!     Salten My Wounds   Salten the inch deep whip lash scars on my back, I love pain, no pain no gain; Bleed, guitar playing fingers, profusely, Boils over my body, burst,  Drown me in pus; I'm not insane, no pain, no gain; Stress, agony, dispair, competition, Damage my brain cells, Make me a retard,  The life of a retard is better than a fruitless one.

      The work load had been a little less these past few days. My mind I and I were in desperate need of some activity and thereby we landed up at the Devil's Workshop. The following 'poems' were written there.      Who's to Blame?    I have no physical abnormality,  Fame is far from veracity,  I'm no super intelligent geek, no math freak,  I'm just a wannabe,  Coping with the pressure, the competition,  The over expectation,  Leave me alone and you will see,  The fault does not lie in me.   I've tried, tried and failed,  I've felt derailed,  I'm not giving up hope,  I accept as a challenge, the obstacles with which I must cope,  In desperation, I've considered dope,  But I won't give up easy,  Leave me alone and you will see,  The fault does not lie in me.   Retrospection gives me a second thought; it makes me see,  Maybe the reason for what I have not rests in me,  Maybe it is I, who is disillusioned in believing my life is tough,  Maybe it is I, who simply has not tried hard enough,  Maybe it is I, who has made this ride seem rough,  I comprehend now; the fault does not lie in the world that surrounds me,  The weakness arises from within.       Stained    And entire lifetimes shall be wasted trying,  To do what remained undone,  To say what remained unsaid,  To wash away the stain,  To heal the scars, ease the pain,  We shall try ceaselessly,  Failing over and over again.   And entire lifetimes shall be wasted wishing,  That the past would amend,  That the hand of the hour would in a different direction bend,  That the moment that mattered would come again,  That the ones who left would with us remain,  We shall try ceaselessly,  Failing over and over again.   And then when we are done,  Jaded we shall all go to sleep,  Sleep until eternity, with a coffee stain on our sleeve.

       This blog was written on the 4th of July at 6:28 AM. All references made to yesterday are relative to the date mentioned.   Yesterday was the 4th of July. Besides being the day when the Americans attained freedom around 228 years ago, it was easily the most significant day in the history of sport.  Sunday played host to the final of Euro 2004, the Formula 1 French Grand Prix and the final day of Wimbledon 2004. I'll mention the results in a self-defined order of significance. Michael Schumacher won the French Grand Prix, once again, this is his ninth victory in ten races this season, and with this victory, he further fortifies his stand at the championship table. Next, Roger Federer (SUI) beat Andy Roddick (USA) to win the Wimbledon title for the second time in succession. This next one is easily the father of all results. Greece beat Portugal 1-0 in the final of the Euro 2004. For all the non-football fans, the multitude of this result is the equivalent of Bangladesh beating Australia in the final of the Cricket World Cup. Agreed these results don't make good reading material, and that almost everyone who stumbles across this blog will already know the facts stated above. However, there is more to these results than what meets the eye. Sometime back, I stated that I was hoping that Greece wouldn't end up winning the Euro, 2004.  As a matter of superstition, I even stated, while walking to the car after Ramaiah's classes on Saturday, that Portugal would emerge victorious on Sunday.  And look who's won now, it's Greece all the way, which brings us to my, shall we say, extraordinary psychic abilities. It's happened on numerous occasions. Only I had never been able to, prior to this, to make a log of such, shall we say once more, paranormal activities. From experimentation and observation, we may conclude that the result of an event is inversely proportional to the nature of my predictions. In support of my theory, I have as an example the result of the Euro 2004 final. My next prediction? I will remain a loser all my life (wink!).

      Since I had ample free time on hand today, I thought I would do something constructive with it.  It has been over five days since I last used the internet as extensively as I normally do. I had not read Rahul Pratap’s Blog for a long time and was waiting for that hour when I would finally could. When I finally did use the internet, after having lightened my wallet on an internet renewal pack, I found that Rahul had not written since last time. Since it was blogging that I was thinking about, I searched for blogging tips on Google. I could not comprehend much about using Movable Type et al but I did learn a few other things. One site, I forget which one, suggested providing a background about yourself instead of writing away, assuming that the world already knew you as a house hold name. It suggested that one make their stance clear and allow the reader to find out the purpose and theme of your writing. The following paragraph is a consequence of my reading that article on blogging tips.  My name is not very catchy and I have no extraordinary physical ability that I would like to show off. I am a very ordinary person who wants to, as clichéd as this may sound, express his feeling, voice his opinions, and write down the things he would have never said.  I am an ambitious fifteen years old, aspiring to make into the Indian Institute of Technology one day. To elevate my chances of doing so, I go to an institute called Ramaiah’s Study Circle. I write in my free time as a hobby and as a probable solution to improving my weak vocabulary. I have no other purpose for writing. This blog is just a fragment of my mind, and my over inflated ego, available on the web. Ah! I feel much lighter now… As if i'm on dope, or something like it.

       This post was composed over the entire last week of July. Read on to learn why it hadn't been posted sooner.   This hadn't been posted earlier as a consequence of my firm self-discipline. To rid the guilt of having wasted all my time this week I had imposed a new set of rules to be followed by myself, without exceptions, day in and day out. One of those rules happened to allow no more than an hour of internet usage, that too only on Sundays. I had to do it else, I was in danger of becoming a cyber addict.   The atmosphere is chilly and on most days, the 29th in particular, it has rained heavily. It was raining outside for nearly 20 hours in one go between the 28th and the 29th. Maybe it is nature's way of showing its grief. I had my digital camera confiscated from me. Apparently due to some scratches on the lens. At least that is what my parents thought. They sent it to the Sony service centre for repairs and it was returned without any work having been done on it. Why? Because it did not need any. What my parents thought was a scratch turned out to be a bunch of fingerprints and an inevitable, meager amount of water that had crept in. I didn't ask Mummy to give it back to me, now that all the doubts over my maintenance abilities had been cleared. In addition to the camera, I turned in my stereo system too, hoping that it would make my parents feel bad about the incident. Unfortunately, nobody seems to even remember the incident now, let alone feel bad about it. It doesn't look like my idea worked too well. That was not the end of all my misery. I was doing badly in class. I didn't get to see Spiderman 2 while Tarun, Gautham, Shashanka, Nakul and almost everyone I know had already seen it. I hope my turn comes soon. It did not help my already cheerless condition when Tarun called me on Thursday evening. He asked me if I remembered a certain Rishabh who was in class ten now. I said yes and in a humorous tone, I asked him if Rishabh had died. When I heard him say yes, I was standing there, wishing I could undo the past, yet again. This post is dedicated to Rishabh. It's the least I could do for a person whose existence I had taken for granted until he existed no more. Saturday noon was another one of those occasions when I felt for sure that Mummy liked Anjali more than me. I was having lunch when Mummy and Anjali came home from their schools and offices respectively. They were standing outside, waiting for the door to be opened when I heard my mother comment on how cute her baby was looking in her Bulbul uniform. That is when I realized that she hadn't said anything about me when I was in my NCC Air Force wing uniform. Anjali and I had once done equally bad in our Math exams while each of us was in the fourth grade. While I remember being scolded to the point I was in tears and eventually sitting through the summer vacation, solving so many Math problems that I began hating the subject, Anjali had been let off without saying a word. Not one word! I know I'm too old for sibling rivalry and maybe there is more to what meets the eye. Nonetheless, I am sure there are certain small differences in our upbringing that could end up making all the difference. For those of you concerned about my health, I'm doing better now. I was down with a severe cold but I'm feeling much better. About Gautham's bite on my right arm: that is improving too. It has become brown, dry and itchy. It now resembles what happens when you scrape your knee. Moreover, to my relief, I don't have tetanus, or AIDS for that matter. Maybe Gautham had taken his shots after all. Heck, what do I have to complain about? Things could have been much worse. I'm content.
