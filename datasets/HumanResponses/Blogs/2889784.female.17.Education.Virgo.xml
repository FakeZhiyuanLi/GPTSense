      Well i think the answer to the long going caveman astronaut fued is quite obvious... Millions of years ago, explorers from another planet landed on earth.  There mission was to search the new found biosphere for signs of rocks.  To their bewilderment, the earth was covered in rocks, and actually, was a rock itself.  The explorers, urinating themselves in glee, bathed themselves in rocks, and forgot about all those who they left home.  Pretty soon, they started to reproduce and created a colony called, Chumbawumba-Monkey-Bang.  Out of the fine rock samples they had found, they were able to create moder devices, like the wheel, a microwave, and a pop tart.  But along with these marvles came advanced weaponry, such as clubs and sticks and spears, and smaller rocks you could throw. Sooooooooo, in concern, the previous planet they lived on sent Astronauts, to make sure everything was going alright.  Upon arrival however, they were pelted with rocks and told to go "shove a rock up their asses".  WEll now, the astronauts were quite bedazzled and didnt know what to think.  But in the code of the anstronuat they had no choice but to use lazers.  The war between astronauts and cave people lasted like... i dunno... a few months and stuff.  But anyways the cave people built this huge boulder and the astronauts built a huge lazer, and the dinosaurs didnt really know what to do, so they kinda ran away.  But simultaneously, the magnificent boulder and big lazer collided... and everything blew up... like majorly blew up... Like the Death Star blowing up in Star wars.... the remaster version... anyways, all the cave people and astronauts were destroied, and the dinosaurs were extinct too.  But luckly, before the cavemen died, they were able to create creatures out of rocks, which were smart and could talk more then the cavemen.  These creatures were hidden underground during the great war, and finally after the rock dust and lazer plasma cleared, they came out and started a new colony, America... which they named after the really cool alien pop star... who wass really cool... so you see, in the war between the two forces of astronauts and cavemen... they both kill eachother because they are equally as cool.

      i have the ultimate solution. start telling one of them you have to do the other thing and the second they start giving you an attitude, cry! seriously, teachers cannot handle crying. yeah, i know you're a guy and crying isn't exactly kosher for the male population, especially when surrounded by other macho men, but it totally works when ur in trouble with someone. BELIEVE ME! I know from experience!!! but if this tactic fails you or you just refuse to use it, i think you would have to stick with your band practice, unless, like kat said, you could manipulate your schedule so that you can do both (maybe tell the drama director that you have to go to the bathroom and when returning half an hour later, let him know about your problem with constipation). hahaha... well... good luck! i know juggling things can be ridiculously hard.  hahaha.. good point about the cavemen kat!   i am glad to see that all 2 of you are using this thing!  go and pester others to do the same... or not... but when the blogger kingdom collapses do not blame me! lol....

      If cavemen and astronauts got into a fight, who would win?   Do the astronauts have weapons? No

      I think I've had to deal with this once or twice b4. Now unless ur a major part, I'm pretty sure that you won't be practicing the whole time: So that leaves you to go to band practice. If ur teacher isn't a nazi, I'm also pretty sure that they'll let you leave early.   But I dunno. Talk to your teachers to see if you can leave early or be late or whatever.

      DUDES! monday i have to choose between play practice or band practice... if i miss play, i loose my part, but if i miss band, i fail... YAR! both of the teachers that lead these are equally insane and unreasonable... does anyone know how to deal with crazy teachers??  i think im gona hire a gang of ninjas to attack their vechicles and pop all there tires so i dont have to deal with either of them BRAJKL::::L:Fjdl;afl;jda

      You are Air. You are the vampire that gives people hope, you are a dreamer and love to be free. You have no worries and live life as you choose. You might want to come back down to earth a bit, and focus more on what you could do down here. You could also be the shy type, with problems but not showing them, try to let other people help you instead or carring the burden all alone.

      I'm so happy!! You guys blogged without my coercion! Special props to Kat and Nick!! WOO HOO!  hehehehe... anyway... I got accepted to my first college: SUNY Binghamton! Yeah, and I visited this Friday through Saturday.  It was nice, but probably not where I would wanna go. But its nice to know I have been accepted somewhere.  If I was an animal what would I be and why? dun dun dun... I answered this question recently and said Cheetah or Leopard or something of that sort but I have changed my mind... to what though? hmmm... I will say butterfly.  Yes, I know butterflies do not have long lives, but hey, they don't know any better. Plus, who knows what a butterfly day feels like compared to a human day. In fact, I'd say it's incomparable. Yeah, so it must be pretty awesome to turn from a catepillar to a butterfly. Also being able to fly is a nice plus, though Jess I still do believe that superpowers are gay but when a butterfly flies it's not really a superpower, it's just something it does. Anyway it would be pretty kewl being so much smaller than everything else.  It would be an interesting new perspective. Also I'd never have to kill anything. Think about it... butterflies live off of pollen and their living promotes the life of flowers. So they survive by assisting the survival of other life.  Isn't that beautiful? Shizzle nizzle wizzle... this is good poem material! haha yeah i will def use this.  ok i am done for now. PEACE!

      we have 5 members now! woo hoo! so shoutz to kris, kat, bon and tim! now to start off the kewlness of this site i'm going to update all you losers who didn't come to NYC on how freakin awesome it was by pasting parts of my xanga entry right hurrrr:   i had a great time with my kris and the rest of the 122 girlies. sooo goooood. i LOVE them so much... i have like the best friends in the universe. SURRIOUSLY... hehhehe.   at the beginning of saturday i asked tania to be my valentine and she said yes! WOO HOO! lol... then we went around the macy*s area shopping. some security guard yelled at us for sitting on the floor at the manhattan mall.  we were contemplating doing all this stuff and ask him if we were allowed to, like walk with our bags on our heads in a conga line, but we decided to refrain. i finished up my aeropastle gift card and bought tania her b-day present very inconspicuously.   jess left but before that she gave me her belated xmas present: coldplay live 2003! that is one awesome present. it makes me wanna go to a coldplay concert so bad but coldplay is going on tour this year!!!  i'm so upset!! after that, bonnie and tim parted with us and went out for a valentine's movie and kris, kat, tania, rima and i went back to macy*s where tania, kris and i were rebelious and decided to sit on the floor again. we got some nasty looks but no one made us get up! SCORE! kris was so funny. she was looking at people's pants and giving them these horrible looks if she didn't like what they were wearing. at one point i spit my lemonade all over my face her looks were so funny. haha. then we tried to try on prom dresses but we all got the wrong sizes and there wasn't much of a selection there anyhow. afterwards we went back to tania's and chilled for a while. her brother rami is so adorable. playing with him is so much fun. tania n kris walked me home at 11.  sunday was tania's pseudo b-day.  we went to mars 2112 with a bunch of her friends from bklyn tech. its a kewl place but the food isn't that great and its so expensive. the cake was "orgasmic" though. i'd go back just for the cake. afterwards we went to this store that sells piano books for kris. being there i was so sad that i didn't learn the piano when i was younger. there are are so many kewl songs i could be playing. kris suggested i take it up in college. i think i will!   afterwards i dragged my sis to say hello to the MD peepz and watched rami being his crazy self. tim bonnie and i walked my sis back home and tim and bonnie ambushed my room lol. bonnie pointed out all the kewl pics in my room and tim like the "electric green" haha. then we walked back to tania's and since i am just so darn kewl they decided to chill with us instead of going to the club. hellz yeah. so i taunted some of tania's friends online. we had some crazy laughs, i even peed in my pants, for real! we started watching breakfast at tiffany's but everyone started falling asleep.  woke up and realized there was no way i was going to the spirit days dance practice considering i couldn't get in touch with priya and i had no idea how to get there on my own. and it was for the better anyway. kris was leaving so i wanted to spend time with her before she left. we ate at manhattan mall and then walked kris, kat and tim to their bus. we were seriously contemplating getting on with them. we so could have cuz this dragon coach company is so dysfunctional they don't even look at ur tickets. but we figured that wouldn't have been such a good idea. so would stood by her window and continuously waved at them. then i had the bright idea of performing skin a mir rink a dink dink for them. that was awesome. we did that like ten trillion times. people were giving us the dirtiest looks but it was so kewl. this must've been the best goodbye they ever had and ever will have. tania, bon and I even ran after the bus. some random guy in the bus was blowing kisses at us and this little kid sitting in front of tim was so excited by our shannanigans (spelling?). awww... i miss kris... we finally stopped chasing the bus and went back to the mall and tania, bon and I planned our summer together. haha   ok so that was the amazing weekend you all missed out on! haha!  START BLOGGING!

      my throat hurts... i still have 20 pgs to read and a religion essay to write... woe is me!  there is some good news... i got the scholarship for nyu, but then again i know i won't be going there. and i got into bu, which is good.  always nice to have options open.  but i feel so pooperific.  ugh... y do i have to deal with this torture any longer?????? let me be!!!!!! as i told my friend today during calculus class, "i wish i could go home and stay there forever."  we both found the comment quite humorous (hey, ANYTHING is funny in calculus class) and spent the entire class either looking at each other and laughing or giving convincing smiles and nods to our poor teacher while daydreaming.  in fact that's what i've been doing since the beginning of the year in calc. class so this is nothing new.  so why do i need to waste my time in that class??? huh??? WHY??????  and economics class... SHOOT ME IN THE HEAD NINE TIMES!  maybe i could bear it if my teacher acutally knew what she was freakin talking about.  uuuggggggghhhhhhhh... senior year should be obsolete... or at least just a party year, cuz this is just pure hell!  hummppphhhhhhh  may 14 better come quick as hell! I WANT OUT!!!!!!!!  'til then... yes i suppose i should lighten up.  yeah...  ok...  may 14 will also be my reading at barnes & nobles! aaaaahhhhhhhhhh!! too crazy, but good too crazy. better things too crazy than this monotonous daily schedule that never ends... i am tempted just to not do the religion hw.  what the hell could happen? ugh... but i'm a sissy...

      this "project" sounds intriguing... i'm guessing the song you want should have to do with parting or something of that sort... hmmmmmm... how about "Hello, Goodbye!" by the Beatles... hahaha, prolly not. or..."We All Live In a Yellow Submarine!" I'm sure that song would be perfectly revelant.  Hmmm... well i think maybe if you told me what you are doing i could help!!! lol oh, there are a bunch of pics on jess' yahoo site and a link of which is located at the sidebar of this handy dandy site.  geez, nick, that really was quite obvious. i can't believe i didn't think of that!

We need to experience our first concert...uh..experience...together!!! ERIKA, TANIA WE HAVE TO GO!!! JESS, WE HAVE TO GO NOMYGOSH!!! BLACK EYED PEAS, MAROON5, J-KWON SO URKUBI CAN GET TO ZOOTOPIA AND GET TIPSYYYYYYYYYY..it has it all!!!   iT'S Thursday, I just failed my AP History MC Exam, but hey, it was technically the last stressful Thursday of my High School existence, seeing as next Thursday I will have been done failing my AP History exam. I have 4 days of school left. Tomorrow, Monday,Tuesday and Wednesday. Thurs and Fri are test days next week so I don't care about them, they'll be failed in 6 hours.  I'm at my friend Lex's house, and, being an honorary Filipino, I am a scavenger, eating any kind of filipino food I can get my hands on. BOO Kris, Lex is out of the bread that you always feed me with LOL (I sound like a bird.) but I had  "broo la loe" soup.  LOL. MMMMMMMMMMMMM. Espero que was un Filipino. I need an honorary bandana.

      Procrastinating, whining, and stressing?  Sounds like somebody's got a case of the modays . I almost wrote "case of the monkeys." Although that would be cooler, cuz those monkeys could maybe do all your homework, or at least clean your underwear so you could spend more time watching TV and playing fetch-the-crumpled-paper-ball with mellow. I'm assuming its hard to find sticks in New York City...just kiddin ;). Anyway, I have a buttmunch of calculus hw to do, and Howie AKA "Slimer" from Ghostbusters is giving us some really dumb religion project. Its not a bad project, but its just that i already did one exactly like it. FIVE YEARS AGO!!!!!! for Dubyoszki's class. We're kinda behind the other religion classes i guess. Dont worry Bon, Erika and I were just having a profound conversation about the life and times of Perkin. His tragic story can really teach us many important lessons about love, life, and our roles in society. Ahhhhhhhh what is better than a basement filled with permanent marker fumes? Thats right...nothing! Or at least I cant think of anything better right now. Now that i think about it, I can't think about anything right now. So then how did i think about that? I'll just let you guys think about that thought for a while, if you think you can think about it. Mwahaha. And maybe when i'm up in NYC, i'll hafta try that "hand trick." Later dudes and dudettes, new South Park is on...screw hw. Much love to all y'all, expecially to the girl up in that picture sandwiched between Jose and KaBanshee.  I need one of those "AV CLUB" cards

      For anyone having a lot of fun this weekend: enjoy it! If not so much, try to enjoy it. Cuz that's what I'm gonna try to do. On Friday I got the choral Spring concert in which I am the soprano part in a quartet. That's this Friday and I don't know my music gaah!  Saturday I have SATs...nuff said...  Sunday I am planning to get a haircut. Not just any haircut. The BIG ONE. I am cutting off at least 10 inches and donating it to 'Locks of Love'. I have a specific style that I want but I'm want to surprise you later, so I'm not going to tell you what it looks like or whose it looks like. So yes. I feel as if it's a big change cuz I've been growing it out since 7th grade. That's 4 years! That's a long time! One whole average high school career!  So a lot of things have been on my mind...  Nick, thank you so much again for prom! I had an awesome time! Sorry your feet hurt and you had to drink a lot of water and for that guy who creeped you out during the ChaCha Slide.   This happened in school:  girl:  (hold out fist)  Will you hold this? boy: Sure  (puts hand under girl's fist palm facing up)  girl: You have to come closer. It's very delicate. boy: Okay  (puts hand closer so that his palm is touching her fist)           girl releases fist and slips her hand into boy's   I guess you have to actually do it to get it...but it's really cute

      The weather here in NY is beautiful. Unfortunatley at my work , they decided to make my desk area clustered with old flourescent lights, which makes me feel unwelcome, but it's all good lool. Anyway, I'm glad some of us are using the blogger more frequently and all feel the same about our relationship. I'm trying to take things as they come, so I'll say I can hardly wait until my AP's are done, and all of yours as well, and hope for the next time I can come to MD (hopefully with the girls.) ::sigh:: Growing up sucks, but it's a facet of life i guess. Until later,  My Love to you, From the "Bondu."

      i am at amherst... it seems rather amazing. like the academics... WOW. and the campus is really nice, and it seems that there is a plether of things to do, even on a sunday night. yes, plether. hehehehe but nothing for me to do right now really cuz all the current students either are doing something that it would be odd for me to go do or doing work, so i'm here with a host that has to do work. before though i saw two amazing acapella groups, and a pretty good dance group. yeeaaahhhh ok.. as you can see i'm just a little bored... but that's alright. someone just offered to take to me to a party at 11, i might go... but i'm kinda tired considering i only had 3 hrs of sleep last night... grrrrr... oh, and the bus ride here didn't take 11 hrs! YESSS!!! ok... yeah so and um BYEEEE!!!!

      Senior year is coming to a close and I feel like everything is changing and moving so quickly. In my mind,   though, I know that one thing remains for sure and that would be you guys and this incredible bond we   all share. You all (NYC chicas and MD fellas) have been such a constant in my life that despite all the trials   and tribulations of high school, I've never felt completely lost knowing that you guys have my back. It's   hard to think that it's almost been a year since that first night we met at the harbor. Do you all   remember that?? I can't believe how we all just clicked and how we've only grown closer while picking up   some cool cats along the way (kabooty!) hehe. What I love about us is just how real we all are and how   real our connection is. Every one of you guys has such great characteristics...you all add something   wonderful to the group and I'm thankful for that. I'm honestly so thankful for being able to call   myself "part of the group." Whether or not you believe it, each and every one of you guys has   influenced me one way or another and I really feel like I'm a better person because of it. I look forward to   us all being together again sometime soon. Until then, you all remain in my thoughts and in my heart.

      "NOMYGOSH!!NOMYGOSH!!!" To quote Steve of course. I am just beyond giggling at the awesome series of pictures!!! WHO DID IT?! Where did yall get those pictures???!! EVERYONE LOOKS SO GOOD. Except me though. Erika, you know how I'm all randomly insecure lately. Kat has a NICE picture of me that you took my last night on her camera, could you throw that one up instead?-- I look disgusting in the pic you chose. YELCH. Actually, I look disgusting in all of them sans the one in the corner of all of us. But alas, enough talking about me, I am absolutely floored by how touching those pictures are!! They are so beautiful. i really miss yall. Awww! OMG those pictures are SO good OMGosh, seriously. Whoever did it--either Erika or Kat, Good job. I don't know where such nice pictures were hidden, but I'd like them to print out and put in my wallet or something, otay? So whoever has access to the awesome pictures, email me them!! AND for God sakes, change that God awful picture of me.   PS- Who's that hottie in the top left hand corner?! Oh yeah, MY boyfriend. DAmn strait biachh...AHHH SKEET SKEET SKKEETTTTTTTT.  PS- I don't like being insecure lately. It sucks. I feel like I'm in sophmore year ago. What do I do??!!!!

      I WISH I COULD add something to it, but Erika summed it up for me. I feel the EXACT same way--it is "Uncanny" (LOL kris), seriously. In the same way Erika feels like Kris's home, and MD, is a second casa to her and looks forward to it/is as happy to go as she used to be going to the Poconos is the exact same thing with me and Acra.   The way that I now get sad when I leave and happy when I arrive and anticipate upcoming trips to MD is how I used to be with Acra. While I feel like a loser to be so excited about stupid MD, I can't change that fact, and feel happy that Erika feels the SAME way. I feel that's just another reason we're friends. The way I felt down, Tania, Mik  and Kris did too--just another reason we're all friends.  I can't really say anything else--Props to Erika -- "I love you guys--there's nothing more to say."  And TIM-I LOVE YOU BABY FOR LIFE. Dead ASS.

      there's not much more to say than that.  i can't believe it SUNDAY 4:05 am and that i'll be leaving in 3 1/2 hours.  sometimes i feel like i've been here forever, that i've been here since last summer.  that i've never left.  that's what it felt like when i got here.  kris and kat, your house feels like a second home, eventhough this is only my second time here.  it feels like how i used to feel when i went on vacation to the poconos each summer.  i got there and saw all these familiar faces and places and it was just like that's the only life i had.  eventhough i still vacation there, it isn't the same.  that aching and hoping and finally feeling so complete and genuinely happy to be there has vanished, a few years ago i suppose.  but some of that has been reborn in my experience with MD.    kris, I LOVE YOU.  and when you said "I know this will last forever, I have no doubt about it," it made me feel so good.  always jump at any opportunity that comes your way because afterall that is how we met.  if you hadn't left LAMS for 122, we'd never have met.  it scares me to think that i might have never met you... I LOVE YOU.  there isn't much more to say.  tania, bonnie, jess -  WHAT IS WRONG WITH US???? we live so close to each other and we NEVER see each other!  i guess school work is an excuse, but we can't let that get in the way anymore.... i guess it won't have to be in the way anymore.  we're seniors!! we'll be free and done w/ all this nonsense so sooonnn.  we can't forget how good we are to and for each other.  we really are.  I LOVE YOU.  there isn't much more to say.  mik, tim, justin, nick, steve - you guys are wonderful. you are truly beautiful people.  i am so lucky and glad to have met all of you.  the crazy laughs, deep conversations and warm hugs are things i will always cherish.  I LOVE YOU.  there isn't much more to say.  kat - it touches me that you care about your big sis' friends so much and that you want to spend time with us.  your heart is so big.  I LOVE YOU.  there isn't much more to say.  its 4:39 am, and ur all sleeping.  i'm a little chilly here, sitting in my t-shirt and shorts in your freezing basement.  my feet are especially cold eventhough i'm wearing socks.  i always have cold feet (on more than one level).  i'm untangling my expertly cut hair (thanks tania and kris).  and i'm thinking about you... all of you.... I LOVE YOU.  there isn't anything more to say.

      As the clock says on the bottom of my entry, it's about 10:54. I, being a typical teenager and deciding to f*ck around on AOL instead of finishing a scholarship, or God forbid, starting 2 hours of AP studying and/or looking up more information on my Economics project, decided instead to look at xanga's and whatnot and eventually remembered our Good ol' MD-NY or NY-MD connection!!! Reading entries, I realize how insipid we all are (sans Nick,Erika and Kat), for not writing in it frequently. It's easy, it's fun, and it's a good way to start keeping in touch for college. We shouldn't just do it in college, we can do it now!!!!!!!!! Anyway, I'm going to try to add something every few days ,and since Tim is my bitch, I will bicker until he does so as well. YaHoo!!! Mik,Steve,Justin,Jess and Kris are on their own, but hey, 2 outta 3 ain't baddd!!!  "5 out of 4 people don't know how to use fractions"~Hehe, from a JCPenney shirt. Oh well, there's a commercial on the TV inside, so my mom's going to start yelling at me because she's not distracted by "funniest home videos" anymore!! I gotta go shower for mY MD TRIP YESYESYES!!! THIS IS MY LAST ENTRY BEFORE MY SPRING BREAK TRIP TO MD!!! I was gon straighten my hair, but screw it, i'll just let it dry wavy. Bleh. I didn't want to though. I'm so lazy. I don't even want to let it dry wavy because I don't want it to dry at ALL because I don't want toshower or shave, or study AP History and English after, or look up some more Economics stuff, but also don't want the guilt of NOT having done any of it. I HATE MYSELF. I NEED TO JUST CHILLAX. Easier said than done. Well, I Feel no better, but I LOVEYOU ALL so much. Yall just need to know that. To death. For real.   On a brighter note, I snickered at reading some of your entries, especially Nick's. He's SO funny.   Uhhhh.........how exactly does one suck a f*ck?  SEE YOU ALLLLLLLLL IN MARYLAND!!!!!!! LOVE YOU ALLLL LOVE U ERIKA LOVE U TANIA LOVE U KRIS LOVE U KAT LOVE U ESPECIALLY TIM LOVELOVE U STEVERY, LOVE U NICK LOVE U MIK, LOVE U JUSTIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!

ANYONE??? i would really like to have something to do that week so i don't have to go the first week of dellwood...  ookkk peace out jiggaazzz

Anyway, I am at work, waiiting to go to Erika's readin at Banres and Noblesx, an dbecause we're already in Manhattan and we get out of work here at 5:15 and the thingy starts at 7:30 we're messing around on the computer to kill  some time before walking over to Broadway. I am being grave see brave and leaving all the mistakes here, damn ghetto keyboard. Anyway, I haven't written in here in awhile, sorry Erika, and I promise i'll get people to write in it. Anyway, I've been feeling kinda down this week, just as stressed as I have been for the last four years, I think because I still am not used to the fact that I don't have any homework or tests to worrry about . I'm getting over it though and feel more like myself lately. I am getting restless for MD, I can't wait to go back, it should be 023f5un..that was Sarah. In her native Language of the Lakota woman sh8e there u go again..she says hello.  Sarah: 26+0221  She says Bonnie is SO sexy..oh..+9328+6and fart.

       words from moonstruck:   "Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is, and I didn't know this either, but love don't make things nice - it ruins everything. It breaks your heart. It makes things a mess. We aren't here to make things perfect. The snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. Not us! We are here to ruin ourselves and to break our hearts and love the wrong people and  die . The storybooks are  bullshit . Now I want you to come upstairs with me and  get  in my bed."  my high school workload is virtually over. all i have is one lousy religion final and i am finitooo.  my reading is thursday and it is rather exciting to think about.  "Something Good" Perhaps I had a wicked childhood Perhaps I had a miserable youth But somewhere in my wicked, miserable past There must have been a moment of truth For here you are, standing there, loving me Whether or not you should So somewhere in my youth or childhood I must have done something good Nothing comes from nothing Nothing ever could So, somewhere in my youth or childhood I must have done something good  the niceness of people in school now that it's all coming to a close  the yearbook  my b-day presents  thoughts of prom, after-prom, day after prom, day after day after prom, priya's valedictorian dinner celebration, visiting MD, graduation liturgy, graduation, graduation dinner, graduation parties, speech banquet preperation, speech banquet,  SUMMERRR ,  COLLEGE !!!

I command you all to go see it when it comes out in June.    urlLink THE NOTEBOOK    But of course Spike is always the first thing on my mind.

      When I was young I knew everything She was a punk who rarely ever took advice Now I'm guilt stricken, Sobbing with my head on the floor Stop a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice  I can't be held responsible She was touching her face I won't be held responsible She fell in love in the first place  For the life of me I cannot remember What made us think that we were wise and We'd never compromise For the life of me I cannot believe We'd ever die for these sins We were merely freshmen  My best friend took a week's Vacation to forget her His girl took a weeks's worth of Valium and slept And now he's guilt stricken sobbing with his Head on the floor Thinks about her now and how he never really Wept he says  I can't be held responsible She was touching her face I won't be held responsible She fell in love in the first place  For the life of me I cannot remember What made us think that we were wise and We'd never compromise For the life of me I cannot believe We'd ever die for these sins We were merely freshmen  hey yeah  hey yeah hey yeah   We've tried to wash our hands of all this We never talk of our lacking relationships And how we're guilt stricken sobbing with our Heads on the floor We fell through the ice when we tried not to Slip, we'd say  I can't be held responsible She was touching her face And I won't be held responsible She fell in love in the first place  For the life of me I cannot remember What made us think that we were wise and We'd never compromise For the life of me I cannot believe We'd ever die for these sins We were merely freshmen  For the life of me I cannot remember What made us think that we were wise and We'd never compromise For the life of me I cannot believe We'd ever die for these sins We were merely freshmen We were merely freshmen   i don't think i ever realized how sad this song is until right now...    zootopia isn't sold out? the seats left are probably super crappy though.  there is one small area full of awesome seats, some decent seats and then like really bad horrible seats.  i suggest we look out for other concerts, i think it'd be more fun to go to a smaller more intimate concert so get looking peoples lol, unless you guys really wanna go to zootopia which is fine if you want a nose bleed (haha, and tania will actually get one since she's so prone to them). peazzizzllleeezzzz

      Whoa Kat! Way to pimp the short cut. Looks splendiferous. Erika, my poor deluded friend, Mergatroid is the name of our buddy Mike. I'm not sure where Mergatroid came from, but i think mik coined it. Altho from now on, I will use "heavens to mergatroid" at least once a week. Preferably on fridays, around 3:00.

      i am joining the normal human realm and getting a cell phone. yeah baby. yeah.  by the way, tim, you said one of the bands is named "mergatroid."  did they get that name from, "heavens to mergatroid?" just wondering. i still think austronauts can shoot the cavemen and be done with it.

      My top eyelids are trying really hard to go down and talk to my bottom eyelids. I feel bad keeping them apart so late at this hour of 1 in the morning. Just got back from Kent, Raff, and T's concert. What are the names of the other 2 dudes? Longhouse rocked, and they made me jiggle in excitement. It was grandiose. Laughing Colors was loud, therefore they were awesome. Kelly Bell Band felt like waiting 40 mins before setting up, so me and "Mergatroid" left without experiencing their reputed glorious reggae-ish melodies. I got some sweet stickers, which remind me of that summer night at the harbor. Back in the day. But back to the point of my ramblage. I definitely think that cavemen would win. Even tho astronauts have those protective suits, cavemen are much more adapted for fighting than us modern humans. The astronaut would be lost without ground control to tell him what to do. And he'd be high on all that pure oxygen they feed him. Time to sleep. One Love Y'all. -=Slim=-

She says this because ERika LURED us into her house to WATCh not stare at the Box, of Donnie darko because Tania did not view the movie. however, upon going to Erika's house, she DOES NOT HAVE A REMOTE TO WORK THE MOVIE WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR FUN TONIGHT. i READ this over. it does not make sense but i kno and tania, and erika knows what it means. i am also unable to type on erika's laptop because erika suks jut like the laptop.

      Okay: Color me exhausted.   I just found out that I was using a shortened version of 'Crawl' by This Way. The extended version is about 40 seconds longer. This is good because I can fit more pictures in. The problem is that I'd have to edit it from the old computer cuz that's where the first 1/2 of the video is. What I mean is that there are extended parts in the song that happen near the beginning of the song.   I'd have to edit a lot if I want the pictures to match the song.   But on the other hand- I can keep it the way it is: 3 minutes and 18 seconds rather than 3 minutes and 53 seconds, and have another project with new pictures and a new song. Since I'm getting more pictures now since I started and have a new computer where it's faster to make the slideshow, it'll be easier for me to finish quicker.  I'm not saying that the first idea won't be easy...cuz it won't...but it'll be a challenge, and I'm up for it.  All I'm asking for is a vote type thing  ____Extend the 'Crawl' Video ____Keep 'Crawl' Video the way it is and create new 'Project' using 'You've Got A Friend' song by James Taylor ____Same as above but use different song

      hey i was looking through old xanga entries and found this entry in which i was talking about time and was reminded of the discussions about time we've had so i'm just gonna post part of that entry here:  time is weird... this morning when i had to write this essay last minute, the minutes went by like seconds and now its 3:50 and it seems like it was 3:45 so long ago.  sometime i believe time is a measure of something immeasurable... or rather that time just can't be measured... that's why its so impalpable.  i've always had trouble measuring time.  like when someone asks me how long i've been waiting on line or something like that i feel inadequate estimating and i'm sure i estimate wrongly all the time... maybe its because i don't carry watch ever but i just think that time is something you can't grasp really if you're someone who can look a little beyond the reality of everyday life... in this case, the smarter you are, the harder it is for time to sit well with you, or something like that....  ok peace out people!

      i biked today!!  my friend had ridden her bike to school so as we're leaving she's like, "erika, how bout i help you bike?"  at first, i adamantly resisted.  there were a lot of reasons not to: it was the senior lawn, that just something you don't do on the senior lawn; i was wearing a skirt and flip flops; i had no gear and i guess i'm lucky i didn't crack my head open.  but then she seemed to be mad at me and then i thought, hey she has reason to be.  i'm being a dumbutt little goody goody.  so i did it and it made me so happy. ok, i'm not a pro yet but i did it on my own for at least six cycles! lol. that was so refreshing...  suitable is a sore to the soul.  do something unsuitable everyday, or at least once a week.

      With the new computer, I'm able to add more effects and able to work faster on the 'project'. HOWEVER, the scanner from the old computer doesn't work for the new one. So I can't really get any developed pictures unless sent by e-mail or me taking a load of time scanning it in the old computer and transferring it to the new one.   So my point: It would really mean a lot if you guys could send me pix thru email or something. I think I need to fill about a little more than a minute. I don't need a lot though. Group pictures are preferred, please!  Luv ya!
