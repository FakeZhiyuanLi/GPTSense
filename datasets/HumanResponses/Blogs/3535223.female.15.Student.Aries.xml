      Over Spring Break, my family went to Memphis. All of my relatives live there so that is the main reason why we go so often. On our way to visit my grandpa there was this one house that just stood out. What they had in their yard was so funny that we turned around just to take a picture of it. We took the picture and then the little Korean man that lived there was like " Get OUT!" So, we left, not only because he told us to but also because there was a bunch of black guys looking at us like they were ready to bust a cap. I'll post a picture of the funny " yard art."

      Howdy Neighbors, Well, today I woke up at 7:00 am and went to the gym with Katlyn, my buddy, pal , life support....she's just my best friend...not the other stuff....and i ate a carb smart bar before I went to the gym and now I have a stomach ache...which is fine...I'll live... Other than that my mom is taking my brother to a movie..and she says " I never spend time with him..." which I find hilarious because the last time we had a girl's day out was like before my little brother, Jack (4), was born. But, what can you do?..You can do nothing.... So, after deciding that I don't feel like going to see the Day After Tomorrow....I sat down a thought " I'm going to start blogging..." and by golly...I created an account at, who would ever guess, www.blogger.com, and now I'm writing to no one....this will sit on the internet and no one but me will ever read it except for the few people around the world that may run into my blogging entries. I might tell some people... I'm kind of hungry and can't decide whether or not to fix a grilled cheese sandwich ( sp?) or a quesadilla..(sp?) But, it's all good... I think I'm done...this is enough for today...if I don't forget that I have created a blogging account than I will publish another tomorrow, if I forget just remember this as the day that I take over the blogging website.. Ok, I really gotta go... Luv Everyone...even the sickest of people ( MJ )  It's not a big love for MJ but it's enough to call him "loved" Remember, Christ First ! Love ....Lauren

      Guess What!?...I forgot to put this but I got my permit!  I totally passed(4/6) I was psyched!  I still have a lot to work on because I suck at driving at this point but my dad's gonna start working with me on the weekends...just cause he's such a freakin' cool dad. But, I took a picture of my permit so you can all see and believe. Because some people are just stupid little doorknobs that think they know all but THEY DON'T!! Ok, later Lauren

      Today was June 4th, 2004...exactly one month from July 4th. Yeah~! Well, since Katlyn spent the night I woke up and went to the gym...then I came home and helped Katlyn do her chores so we could "chill" like homie G's. ( That was a joke...) Then, we ate lunch together and then watched the movie Monster...( disturbing ) It was o.k. Then, she took her little brother, Baxter, to see Harry Potter...isn't she such a good sister.... She always makes me look bad... Anyways, then I sat at home and looked at www.avrillavigne.com and was totally jealous of Avril's career. She's totally the luckiest kid on Earth.  I won't go into that... So, then I just ate dinner and right now Katlyn got home and she's going to call me when she gets done eating dinner and we might go run or we might just sit and watch T.V. Isn't life just one giant gracious hairball? Yeah, I know ...we all live through them freakin' hairballs... But, my parents are hugging and kissing and it grosses me out beyond hairballs... I gtg...my brother has been putting popcorn kernals in the air vents...so I guess that means that I'll be smelling popcorn throughout the day. Families these days...especially mine...we are crazy...wait, I'm not but they are.. GTG.. Love everyone.. ~Lauren~

       Hey everybody, I just got done watching Saved by the Bell and Growing Pains...it was great now I'm waiting until the Whittenburgs get home so me and KK can hang out... Other than that, I think my mom is making me take my brothers to see Shrek 2  I'm not a Shrek fan so I don't think it'll be so "great" Anyways, just thought I'd drop you guys a line to tell you whats happening so far... I'll write back later.. Love you, Lauren...the #2 Coolest kid ever
