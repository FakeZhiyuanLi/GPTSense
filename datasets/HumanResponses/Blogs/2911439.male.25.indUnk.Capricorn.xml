      Ah the pains of motivation. I need to be working on job applications today. I have several hours of free time today (probably the only time that is going to happen this week) and so far I've not even touched them. That isn't to say I haven't done anything. I have finished several other things I had to do, but I just can't seem to motivate myself to write my cover letter. My lack of motivation is going to end up putting me into a bad sutation if I am not careful. Hopefully this job will work out, but I don't even have any real confirmation that it is going to happen yet.

      Well, lets try this one again. I am a Masters student in Biology at a small State University in Missouri, USA. I will be defending next month and graduating in May. I haven't applied to many jobs but I have looked a lot. I'm pretty nervous about the whole job hunt thing. I may have a line on a job through a Professor that I am good friends with, but I am afraid to get my hopes up too high just yet. He's been going to a lot of meetings and is suppose to be getting a lot of grant money, some of which he will use to higher some workers. He has hinted very strongly, although has not out right said, that I am in. This would be more than perfect. Although slightly out of my field of interest, it is something I think I would enjoy.  I have a son and another child on the way. I love kids, but plan on stopping with two. I hope to have the extra income required to adopt sometime in the future, but at this time its only a thought I'm playing with.  Well thats enough for now. I'll be around.

      Ah, my first blog post. Consider this to be "just a test."

      Talked to that Professor about the job. Turns out the one I was thinking of doesn't start until next year at the earliest. But he is most likely going to hire for a water quality study this summer with a pay of about 30K. Its a bit less than I want/need, but it would be enough to survive on and I would really like to stick around here until my wife finishes school. More specifically until I acheive my black belt (I am currently taking Hapkido), but that may take more than a couple years that it will take my wife to finish up school.  Oh well, hopefully things will work out because I still find myself unmotivated to send out job applications. I really need to get a fire lit under my but, but I just don't try. I already missed two deadlines for positions that I was actually interested in, but I just keep counting on this job in this area.

      Busy Busy Busy. Not much else to say except that I am busy. Defended my Thesis March 29th. All went well. Now I'm just trying to force myself through my only class as well as look for a job. That professor I mentioned hasn't really said anything new in awhile and I'm starting to get nervous. I know him well enough to know that when he gets the money that I'll have a job, but I'm starting to fear that he's going to get it later rather than sooner.  Oh well. Just figured I'd do an update.  Peace.

      Its quite obvious I do not maintain my blog regularly. That is probably because I know that few, if any, people actually see this.  What I do keep, is merely as a vent for my thoughts.  I used to keep a journal for quite some time, but a very unfortunate turn of events forced me to not only discontinue keeping one, but to destroy all of my old ones. I don't think I want to get into that today.  Perhaps another time.       Today was my wife and I's five year wedding anniversary.  We mostly just spent the day together and had a nice lunch at a restaurant.  With a 19 month old child it is terribly difficult to do anything real romantic and lets not forget that my wife is currently 7 months pregnant with our daughter.     The day turned sour when we discovered our son has "pink eye."  No real harm done since he is already on an anti-biotic for his ear infection. No harm other than about 2 and a half hours wasted in the ER since our doctor isn't open on Saturdays.       I am excited about our daughter, but scared as well.  Lately the reality of having a girl is really setting in. The dangers, both for her and myself, are starting to bother me.  Things I've never really thought about when I had my son, but now disturb me regularly.  I haven't seen her face yet and I am already picturing my little angel that I do not wish to grow up. I am already feeling hints of jealousy and sadness at her dating and eventually marrying. I already can imagine the horror and anger I may feel at the major roadblocks her life may or may not run into.  I suppose being a man, I see how my son may be able to deal with life. I also know how I can help provide for him in both tangible and intangible ways.  For my daughter though? It feels like a whole new ball game and for good reason, it is.  I'm sure I will learn along the way just as she will, but the anticipation is scary.  Perhaps it was the lack of bonding that I have with my parents, or the realization that "Father Knows Best" is far from reality, or any other number of issues, but I am nervous.  Nervous of becoming a father......again.

      Quite unfortunately I am still hunting for a job.  The job I had hoped to get with a former Professor does not look to turn out.  While I've been very assertive in asking him, the last time I ran into him I was left with the distinct feeling that either the job isn't going to be there or I wasn't the one getting the job.  So I continue to job hunt.  About a year ago I discovered something.  Moo Sul Kwan HapKiDo.  I can honestly say that I am a different person for this discovery and I think my wife would certainly back that up.  I am a different person in only positive ways.  It has meant to so much to me physically and mentally.  Some of the feelings I have can not be described easily.  It just feels like I found a spot in my life, a place to belong.  Anybody that knows me well will find that I can hardly go through a day's worth of conversation without mentioning it.  Sometimes I wonder if my wife is ready to duck tape my mouth shut, then I notice the smile on her face as I realize that she realizes just how happy I am now.  Now to the unfortunate part.  While it isn't great that I don't have a job yet after recently graduating with my masters, I actually feel it is even worse now that I realize I must move away.  The only opportunity locally has been swept away for one reason or another.  In the long run it may be for the better, but for now all I can visualize is Hapkido being gone from my life.  What makes this worse is a week of very bad events has caused me to miss 3 classes.  I feel empty when I miss class (especially a week and a half's worth).  And now I realize how I will feel whenever I do leave for good.  I must get a job.  I have a family.  A wife, a son and soon a daughter in which I must provide for.  The job I have now is a good one, but nothing that will provide for 4 people.  I've completely 7 years of college (Masters) and to put it to work I must now leave the one thing that I have found to give my life real meaning and purpose.  Granted I have feelings of meaning and purpose for my family, the feelings I have for hapkido are different, personal.  Feelings of respect, honor, accomplishment, duty and hard work.  Feelings that make me feel like a better person all around.  If feels as if I move past one hurdle of mental anguish that I create another.  I've finished school leaving the chores of formal education behind only to find the hurdle of find a job.  And as I soon (hopefully, but unfortunately soon) find a job I will leave that hurdle for the one of leaving Hapkido.  I pour out my thoughts and feelings here tonight half asleep.  Wondering why I haven't gone to bed yet. Why I haven't managed to try to run even once yet.  Wondering if I can ever replace the parts of me that Hapkido has helped to develop.  The parts that my instructor has brought out of me and helped me to believe in.  The last time I took Martial Arts it took me over 7 years to get back into it.  I think its a no brainer to say that if I waited another 7 years I would most likely not be joining again in my late 30s.  But I know that I will not find an equal to MSK HKD wherever I move and I am unsure if a substandard replacement will help me feel as I do now.  Perhaps I'm being overly pessimistic.  Or perhaps those that may be reading this have just not met a man like my instructor or have experienced Moo Sul Kwan Hapkido.

      I'm a active guy. For a year now I have been taking Moo Sul Kwan Hapkido.  Hapkido is a Korean Martial Art with an emphasis on joint locks, breaks, throws and grappling.  The work out is very rigorous, but its not enough.  While it is a very good work out and I have obviously built muscle over the past year, it has also increased my calorie intake.  Which as you can guess doesn't fair to well around the mid section no matter how hard my abs are getting or how much larger my chest is getting.  And lets not forget that I'm probably starting downhill on that youth metabolism that burns up everything within 10 feet of your body.  I've noticed, slowly, over the last couple of years that I've started gaining weight even though my activity levels remain high and my food intake has remained relatively constant.  Probably a sure sign of a slowing metabolism, which is why I want to jump on this now and not wait until my first heart attack or second chin.   So I've decided to start running again. Of course I say that as if I was some kind of track runner in High school or college, when in reality I only ran for about 4 months. But in those 4 months I was able to get myself up to 5 miles a day (for 5 days a week).  Unfortunately that was about 6 years ago and I don't have near the motivation I had then. So tomorrow (or so I plan) I am going to start a 10 week program.  I found a nice, basic little write up online that is geared towards times and not necessarily distance. Right now I'm interested in just getting my body conditioned to running again and increasing my stamina.  So the speed and distances can wait.  The first week is a simple 5 min. walk, 10 min. run, turn around, 10 min. run and then end it with 5 min. walk.  Simple enough and will only take 30 minutes out of my day.  The hard part will be motivating myself to do this.  I had planned to do it on my days off, but I just got picked up for full time.  I can't run before work (6 am) and motivation will be low after work.  But I'm going to try.  We'll see what happens.

      Tonight was the hottest night of the year.  Well as far as Hapkido is concerned.  One of the many interesting aspects of hapkido (at least where I take it) is the "hottest night of the year."  My instructor watches the weather and when it gets hot enough we have an extreme work out.  Typically constant of more exercises and less technique than normal, but always enough so that you remember it for the next several days.  The best part about this is that if it gets hotter we do it all over again.  So hopefully the weather cools off. ;)  Life in general has been pretty good.  The wife has taken over the bills helping me to keep focused on other things.  The stress of keeping everything settled while I search for a good paying job was starting to get to me.  Granted I have a decent job now that he getting us through, but it isn't using my degree nor is it really paying enough to do much more than pay the bills.  I received an email stating I finally got passed the resume/application stage of one of the jobs I applied for.  Of course there are two more stages I need to get passed and considering I've received many rejections so for at the application stage, I am not overly hopeful.  It would be too perfect as it is only an hour away.  The only downside is that it is a temporary position (12 months, possibly extended), but it would be great experience and a very good paycheck while I looked for a permanent position.

      Times changes, that much in life can be counted on.   In my world things have certainly been changing.  My daughter was born on August 4th at 9:19pm.  It was a wonderful event and thankfully much less of a scare than my son's birth. No complications and was an easy labor. My wife's exact words were "it was a breeze."  Of course this is all relative to her previous labor with my son.  The job search has pretty much sucked.  I have had only one nibble and a lot of throwbacks.  Nothing has turned out so far and we are barely hanging on.  Life just continues to get more stressful at every turn.  I went to college to avoid living the life my parents endured, yet even after 7 years of schooling I find myself staring down similar paths as they travelled. I'm sure life will get better as the alternative scares me.  My wife has already taken over the budgeting, as I couldn't handle it anymore. During all of this I constantly think of the old saying (paraphrased)  that it is the hard times that define who we are and what we are made of.  Just makes me wonder how I am being defined by these times.  Sometimes that thought scares me more than anything else.
