      Have you ever done a Google search for the words "last page of the internet"?&nbsp; Try it sometime.&nbsp; It's absolutely hilarious.&nbsp; There are TONS of pages out there claiming to be the last page.&nbsp; Most of them encourage the reader to then go out and do something productive with their time.&nbsp; I did find one, though,&nbsp;that linked to the "first page" so you could start all over again.&nbsp; Yippie!&nbsp; :oP   My favorite, though, was this one:&nbsp;  urlLink http://www.robrob8.com/news/last_page.htm    It's just another sign that people have way too much time on their hands.   Of course, this is coming from a girl who goes out and looks at them and then writes about them on a webpage that it's very likely no one is reading.

      Okay, for all you people who really aren't all that interested, I had a gastroscopy yesterday and I'm about to tell you all about it.&nbsp; I figured I'd warn you in case you wanted to just skip reading this one.   Debi took me to the clinic because I was told that if I didn't have someone to drive me home, they'd send me back home and I'd have to reschedule.&nbsp; So, Debi (God, bless that woman!) took me.&nbsp; I filled in all the required doctor's office paperwork and then they called me back to a prep room where they had me put on a smock over my clothes and lie on a bed.&nbsp; A nurse put an IV hookup thingie in my hand which took forever because "my veins were asleep."&nbsp; Then they wheeled me into another room.&nbsp; I'd never been wheeled around on a hospital bed before so that was kind of cool.   Anyway, in the other room, they hooked me up to a heart monitor with a little clippy thing on my finger and put a blood pressure cuff on my other arm and after putzing around a little bit, left me alone.&nbsp; For about 20 minutes.&nbsp; I got pretty familiar with the room by then, just because there wasn't anything else to look at.&nbsp; I learned that if I tapped my finger, the pulse monitor got really screwy.&nbsp; And the blood pressure cuff went automatically every five minutes or so.&nbsp; (My lowest BP was 115/60, whatever that means.)   Then the nurse came back in and had me gargle with this really terrible tasting blue stuff that made my mouth go numb.&nbsp; That was interesting.&nbsp; It came on pretty slowly, but&nbsp;I'm lying&nbsp;there on my left side talking a little bit to the nurse and my lips and mouth are slowly going more and more numb.&nbsp; She hooked me up to an oxygen tank and reassured me that even if it felt like my throat was closing off, I could still breathe.&nbsp; I was okay with that.&nbsp; I just figured that I'd breathe through my nose--with my asthma history, the only thing I worry about in not breathing is if my lungs feel closed off.&nbsp; She said that the gargling was the worst part of the whole thing.&nbsp; I think that seeing the nurse come back a few minutes later and hang a really long black hose-looking thing in the closet was the worst part because I knew that that was going to be stuck down my throat and that thing was stinkin' long!&nbsp; And about at thick around as my pinkie!   So, nurses are coming and going.&nbsp; A nurse comes in and introduces herself and says that she'll be standing behind me (doing I have no idea what).&nbsp; Another nurse comes in and does stuff I can't see.&nbsp; And eventually Dr. Clark comes in and does stuff that I can't see.&nbsp; (Really informed, aren't I?)&nbsp; But pretty soon he came over and shot something like five different injections into the IV hook-up in my hand and tells me that it's going to start to feel a little strange.&nbsp; Oh, yes.&nbsp; My arm when numb before he was done with all the shots.   And I don't remember much after that point.&nbsp; I don't even know how long it took me to go out, but I was gone.&nbsp; I remember waking up at one point in the procedure and thinking "This is not comfortable" and feeling like I was going to gag (or maybe I was?&nbsp; I don't know).&nbsp; And then I was out again.&nbsp; I woke up and a nurse put the head of my bed up, I think.&nbsp; And I was wheeled to the recovery area where they brought Debi in.&nbsp; It's a good thing that they did because I really don't remember much of what happened afterwards.&nbsp; eventually a nurse came in and helped me sit up and I got pretty dizzy doing that.&nbsp; Dr. Clark came in and talked with us and showed us some pictures.&nbsp; And eventually, they helped me out to the car and we went&nbsp; home.   The procedure itself probably took less than 45 minutes.&nbsp; Dr. Clark came into the room around 10 and I was in the car by 11, that's all I know.   When Debi called me later in the evening to check if I was okay, I had to ask her what Dr. Clark said because, though I had vague memories of him coming in, I wasn't sure I could remember what he actually said.&nbsp; That was strange.   What he said, though, was this:&nbsp; my esophogus doesn't close all the way.&nbsp; It could be the reason for my cough.&nbsp; He took a culture from my stomach, though, so see if there's anything there that could be causing it.&nbsp; There's also supposed to be a really distinct line between the tissue of the esophogus and the stomach and I don't have that; but it's quite possibly just because that's how I'm made.&nbsp; So, as for definitive answers for my cough, we don't have them yet, but we're closer and closer.&nbsp; He's going to call me sometime soon and let me know if the culture of my stomach tissue turned up anything and, hopefully, to tell me what I'm supposed to do now.   So, there ya go.&nbsp; You probably didn't want to know any of that, but if you ever have to get a gastroscopy, you know what to expect.&nbsp; All yesterday afternoon I was kind of out of it and tired.&nbsp; My hand hurts from the IV and the back of my throat hurts, but just like if you have a cold.   So yeah.&nbsp; More of the continuing saga of my medical problems.&nbsp; Marcia, the campus nurse who really urged me to get the cough looked at, is really glad that I'm doing all this, though.&nbsp; I stopped in to her office today and she said that by doing this I was quite possibly saving myself from getting cancer later on in life.   So praise God for good doctors and for insurance to cover all this!   Love and blessings, ya'll!&nbsp; :o)

      I just wanted you all to know that I got a ride&nbsp;for the doctor's apointment.&nbsp; Debi's going to take me.&nbsp; She mentioned something about just taking me back to her house afterwards, too, but I'm not sure if we're going to do that or if I'll just end up vegging at my house.&nbsp; We'll talk about it Sunday, I imagine.   Mmm.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm getting a massage on Sunday.&nbsp; And for really stinkin' cheap.&nbsp; Mr. B, from on campus, is going to give me a 1-hour massage for $30.&nbsp; I'm so excited!   Anyway, that's all I wanted to tell you today.&nbsp; I need to get home now.&nbsp; It's been a long day.

      In reading over my post from Tuesday, I really wish I could have written it better.&nbsp; I don't think I really expressed clearly enough how  incredibly excited  I am about Jesus!&nbsp; Those of you who know me personally&nbsp;(and right now, all my readers probably&nbsp;fall into that category), know where I stand already.&nbsp; But you've probably not really heard me rave about him.&nbsp; I've realized that where my shyness may keep me from speaking out in a crowd, here my literary skills give me no excuse!&nbsp; So every now and then I'm just going to give a great big shout out about my Savior.&nbsp; (GOD, YOU ARE SO GOOD!)   I'm going to a ladies Bible study every Wednesday night at my church.&nbsp; We're going through Beth Moore's "Believing God" study and it's really awesome.&nbsp; It was originally done with her doing it with a church somewhere in the southern US (Texas?) and recording it so that people all over the globe&nbsp;could do the same study on-line along with the people of the church.&nbsp; And now, even though we missed it the first time,&nbsp;the sessions have&nbsp;been put onto DVD's&nbsp;and the studies have been put into a book.&nbsp; The way it works is every Wednesday night we watch the video of&nbsp;Beth talking about the topic, and then we all go home and do the homework that goes along with it (5 of 7 days of homework).&nbsp; If you've never heard Beth speak, she's really great.&nbsp; And funny.&nbsp; :o)   My favorite quote from yesterday's video (which is really why I said all that) was this:&nbsp; "Your heritage is to be a wild woman!"&nbsp; That's right!&nbsp; And you know what, even within the context, it was&nbsp;really fun to say.&nbsp; :o)&nbsp; What she was talking about was the heritage that we have in Christ.&nbsp; The example that she used was of a child of parents with a lot of money.&nbsp; That kid, as she turns into an adult, knows that when her parents decide to give her her inheritance, it's going to be breathtaking.&nbsp; Some kids start beating down their parents' door saying, "I'm ready now!&nbsp; I'm ready now!"   That inheritance, though, is temporary.&nbsp; It's going to fade away with the ages and when the end comes, it's going to burn up with everything else of this world and all we'll be left with is ourselves.   Our inheritance and our heritage in Christ, though, are so much better!&nbsp; We're children of the King of Kings.&nbsp; And we don't have to wait until we're adults to get our inheritance.&nbsp; He's handing it out now to some people--if they're ready to receive it.&nbsp; And I'm not talking about the wonder of salvation, either.&nbsp; I'm talking about the life that he wants to bless us with.&nbsp; It may not be an easy life, but let me tell you, I believe that a life lived the way that God wants, is going to be indescribly better than any other life.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I want that!   But I started talking about how my heritage is to be a wild woman.&nbsp; Wildly sold out for God!&nbsp; Do you see the difference?&nbsp; Oh, boy!&nbsp; I don't even know how to do it, but I'm excited to learn.&nbsp; This little introvert of a girl wants to be wild about Jesus!&nbsp; And it' s our heritage as believers.&nbsp; Just take a look back through the Bible.&nbsp; Look at all the people who did crazy, wild things absolutely contrary to what was expected.&nbsp; Noah built an ark in a world that had never seen rain!&nbsp; Moses lead the people of Israel through the Red Sea!&nbsp; The&nbsp;early church&nbsp;spoke out in the middle of towns where people hated them!&nbsp; These people were wild about their Lord!   And I want that.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; How I want that!   I'm beginning to see some of the reasons for this place in my life.&nbsp; I'm in a waiting place, not sure of the long-term plans or what I'm really supposed to be doing while I wait.&nbsp; And I've been blessed with singleness (though sometimes that's hard to say it without clenched teeth).&nbsp; A verse that I memorized during my fourth year of college came back to me again (with a vengeance) last week.&nbsp; It's the middle part of I Corinthians 7:34.&nbsp; "An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord's affairs.&nbsp; Her desire is to serve him in body and spirit."&nbsp; Sounds similar to that verse (whose reference I can't think of right now) that says "Serve the Lord your God with all your heart, with all our soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength."&nbsp; I'm learning to lean on Jesus and how to love him better!&nbsp; I'm learning about my heritage!&nbsp; And I'm learning how to be a wild woman!

       urlLink    Jesus smiles!&nbsp; urlLink    &nbsp; At church on Sunday, during special music, clips from whichever film this picture is from were played on the overhead.&nbsp; I have no idea which film it is or who this actor is or who the director was or anything.&nbsp; That's not at all important.&nbsp; It's a representation of&nbsp;the life of the One I love. &nbsp; Over and over again, the clips were of Jesus smiling and laughing and dishing out hug after hug.&nbsp; Too often,&nbsp;I get an image of Jesus stuck in&nbsp;my head that he's this really serious guy who didn't have any fun.&nbsp; I imagine him praying really seriously, sweating drops of blood "not for his own grief, but for mine."&nbsp; I think of the agony of the cross.&nbsp; I imagine him giving sermons like some of the lectures I've sat through for school. &nbsp; But Jesus was fully God and fully man (wonderous Lord!).&nbsp; He not only was a part of creating this strange creature that is humanity, but he experienced life as one.&nbsp; Can you image a child not laughing?&nbsp; I can't!&nbsp; And I can't imagine anyone who's walking close with God as not smiling much, and Jesus was closer than imaginable.&nbsp; I bet he played with children and joked with the disciples.&nbsp; I imagine that he gave out loads of great big bear hugs. &nbsp; I don't know why exactly I get this grumpy picture of Jesus stuck in my head.&nbsp; It probably has something to do with my persistant fear that he'll get sick of forgiving me when&nbsp;I mess up, that he's so disappointed with me that he can't stand me any more.&nbsp; But that's a lie from the pit!&nbsp; He loves me more than anyone could ever possibly love me!!&nbsp; (Praise you, Father!)&nbsp; He subjected himself to the limitations of an earthy body and died a horrible, painful death because he LOVES ME!!!&nbsp; (Oh, sweet Jesus!)&nbsp; There is no greater love.&nbsp; Not any where, not any time. &nbsp; He knew me before he even created the earth.&nbsp; Knew my name, knew what I would do, knew how I would die.&nbsp;&nbsp;He loved me then and he loves me now.&nbsp; And he SMILES at me.&nbsp; He says good things about me to God, prays for me, watches me with more interest than any one ever will.&nbsp; (Thank you, Jesus!)&nbsp;  &nbsp; And all he asks is that I love him back. &nbsp; Oh, Jesus, I do love you!!&nbsp; Help me to love you more and more every day!&nbsp; Thank you for saving this wrech of a girl, this "speck of dust at the edge of the universe."&nbsp; You are so mighty, so lovely, so holy, so loving!&nbsp; You are all I need. &nbsp; He's smiling on you, too!&nbsp; His loving sacrifice&nbsp;has covered over all your sins!&nbsp; All you have to do is accept his gift of life.&nbsp; I'd love to talk with anyone who wants to hear more about this.&nbsp; Or you can also go to this link and read what's there.&nbsp;  urlLink http://www.greatcom.org/laws/  &nbsp; Love and blessings, ya'll!!

      Well, I think I've been adopted by&nbsp;Debi and Butch&nbsp;as the daughter they never had.&nbsp; (They have two sons instead.)&nbsp; They invited me to spend Sunday afternoon with them, along with Debi's brother and sister, complete with spouses and children, and her parents.&nbsp; It was such a fun time!&nbsp; Debi lives on Lake Hartwell, so we spent the afternoon just hanging out on the dock swimming, watching different people water-skiing, sunning, tubing, and just having a great old time.&nbsp; It was fantastic!&nbsp; My arms have this really great tan, but my legs are still sickly white.&nbsp; :oP&nbsp; After swimming, we all went out to a resturant in Gumlog for supper, and then came home and sat on the back porch chatting and eating brownies and home-made ice cream.&nbsp; It was so great!  &nbsp;  Of course, then I had to come home and do all the Statistics homework that I didn't do over the weekend.&nbsp; I did other work on Saturday.&nbsp; Oh, and since the rest of my family (sans Luke) was going to see Mom in a play on Saturday evening, I went to see the community theatre put on "Annie Get Your Gun."&nbsp; It was really good.&nbsp; I'd seen it before by the community theatre in Barron, but that was long enough ago that I couldn't remember all the plot.&nbsp; Just the songs.&nbsp; Gotta love the "Moonshine Lullaby."&nbsp; :o)  &nbsp;  I actually missed class yesterday anyway, so I didn't worry about getting all the homework done.&nbsp; I had another appointment in Gainesville for my cough.&nbsp; A different doctor this time since we're exploring a different possible explination.&nbsp; We didn't really do anything other than talk about the symptoms and he felt my stomach (that tickles!!) and listened to my innerds.&nbsp; But I have to go back next Monday to have a gastroscopy.&nbsp; That means that they're going to stick a camera down the back of my throat and look at my esophogus, stomach, and maybe the top of my large intestine, I guess.&nbsp; They're going to sedate me, so I have to find a "designated driver" to take me home afterwards.&nbsp; That's really the thing I'm worrying about the most right now.&nbsp; Where am I going to find someone who can give up basically their entire morning to help me with this?&nbsp; I'm hoping someone from church, like a stay-at-home-mom or someone who's retired, will be able to help.&nbsp; I'm going to ask at Bible study tomorrow night.&nbsp; But, woo-hoo!&nbsp; Yet another medical adventure.&nbsp; I'm very curious to see how it goes and what the results are.&nbsp; I'm glad I only have to wait a week.  &nbsp;  But that's all I have to say on that.&nbsp; I have something else I want to say yet, but I'm going to devote a post completely to that because I think it's more important than all this stuff.&nbsp; This is just so people can bore themselves to sleep by reading about my crazy life.&nbsp; But the other thing has to do about God.&nbsp; Between the two, there's really no comparison.&nbsp; God is so incredibly cool!&nbsp; Anyway, I'll get onto that.  &nbsp;  Love and blessings, ya'll!&nbsp; :o)

       urlLink    C'est moi!&nbsp; urlLink    &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm so excited!&nbsp; I figured out how to do it!!&nbsp; I'm still not really sure on all of it, but at least this is here, right?&nbsp; :o)&nbsp; Plus, I got to have some fun with Photo Shop.&nbsp; Tee, hee!! &nbsp; I'm so glad that it's Friday.&nbsp; I'm going to go home and clean my house!!&nbsp; It's gotten so messy in the last couple of days.&nbsp; And then I'm going to watch Pippi Longstocking because I haven't watched it in years and it turned out that someone I know has it on DVD.&nbsp; Coolness! &nbsp; I went to a TownCraft cookware party yesterday.&nbsp; I'd never been to anything like that and it was very interesting.&nbsp; The salesman, Larry, did an excelent job.&nbsp; I really would like one of those electric griddles.&nbsp; They don't require any oil put into them--there's actually oil put into a basin inside the griddle during production.&nbsp; When it warms up, the oil comes up through the metal and keeps the stuff from sticking.&nbsp; It's the coolest thing!&nbsp; Except it's over $500.&nbsp; So, I could do a payment plan and it's got a lifetime warantee, but still.&nbsp; That's a whole lot of money.&nbsp; The food he made was really excelent.&nbsp; I keep thinking of this fried chicken and really incredibly tender steak that he made.&nbsp; Mmmmmmm. &nbsp; After the party was over, I got to sit and talk with some poeople that were also friends of the hostess.&nbsp; We ended up sitting there until 10:30 without realizing that it was so late!&nbsp; It was so great.&nbsp; I like having the opportunity to interact with people sometimes.&nbsp; :o) &nbsp; Anyway, I'm going to go home and try to make some yummy food and clean my house.&nbsp; I hope you all have a great weekend and have an awesome time at church! &nbsp; Love and blessings!

      "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" is a wonderful piece of British humour that one of these days I really will have to re-read.  My favorite character is Marvin, the depressed robot.  In "The Resturant at the End of the Universe", the other characters find him at a resturant where he's been waiting for them to show up for years and years and years.  (I think he spent one of those years with his head in a bucket of water.)  It's been very, very boring.  And he's reverted to writing poetry.  Now I lay me down to sleep. Try to count electric sheep. Good night wishes you can keep. How I hate the night.  Now I lay me down to rest. Darkness won't engulf my head. I can see by infared. How I hate the night.  I'm not sure if that's exactly right--it's been a long time since I've read it.  But I empathise.  I've had such a hard time getting to sleep lately.  I was taking allergy medication that would konk me out, but I don't like taking it every day.  Last night I didn't get tired until after 3.  "How I hate the night."

      So, a lot of people that I know hear music in their head most of the time.  A song will get stuck in your head and you'll hum it all day long.  Or you play music where ever you happen to be sitting.  But do you hear music when you know that there isn't any music playing, and it's not the song in your head?  I do.  I'll be sitting in my living room and think that I left the radio playing in the other room, but then realize that I didn't turn it on.  Or I'll sit down at my computer and think that I can hear the CD playing really low (usually classical music), but when I turn it up, there's nothing there and when I check, it's not playing.  It's not always even music that I know.  It's just a snatch of a melody.  It's sort of like when I'm dreaming and I dream that I'm writing something or reading something.  If I wake up while doing that, the words will actually sort of make sense.  I'll competely forget what they were within the minute of actually being awake, but for that short time, I'm aware that I've been dreaming and that the words that I'm making up really do make some sort of sense.  The music that I hear, I really do think that I'm hearing, it's not just inside my head.  Of course, that's not possible, but I have no idea where it's coming from.  I'm sure it's nothing to worry about though.  Maybe someday I'll find out that my whole life, God's been playing music just out of hearing and sometimes I've been blessed enough to hear it.  That would be much more preferable than being crazy.

      I found a way to get over my wanting a puppy.  I house-sat for a family from my church over the weekend.  Really, I went over there Saturday afternoon and walked their dog--a big, black gentle beast with the schnoz of a spaniel.  Sniff, sniff, sniff; oh, boy.  Anyway. I spent the afternoon and evening there to keep Fudge company, feed her supper, and take her outside again a couple times before going home.  Then I came back in the morning to feed her breakfast and walk her again.  And then I came back after church to walk her yet again.  I decided, that's really too much commitment for me.  Sorry!  And then there was the licking my hand and the fur making me sneeze and the licking my leg and it was just quite enough.  I guess it's kind of like children--I enjoy them as long as they don't come home with me.

      Hey there world!  Apparently this thing is really going to work and not be too complicated for me.  The test of time will tell whether I keep it updated or not.  And I suppose, if no body really reads it, then what point is there in keeping it up to date, right?  I mean, I already have a variety of things that I write in and a bunch of different ways to keep in contact with all my friends.  I suppose what I'm really getting at here is the purpose for me doing this.  Well, I started typing a type of "update on my life" on Nathan's website, figuring that at least Mom and Dad would be interested.  I'm not really sure if anyone actually ever read it there--I think they did because I don't think I visited it as many times as it said it was viewed, but I know that it wasn't read much.  Part of that may be because it was hard to really get down to what was the updated post, I think, and this format really helps change that.  For the forum format, it's important to have the last thing written on the bottom, but for this kind of thing, it's more convient to have the most recent on the top.  Anyway.  That really just gets at why I'm doing it here instead of Greynose.  Why am I writing?  Because I like to think that at least some people are interested in hearing what I have to say.  I'm very possibly very wrong in that.  But it's nice to think sometimes.  There are people that I know that like to know that I'm still alive but may not want to talk with me, and this will give them the opportunity to just log on, check and see if there's been a post in the last two weeks just so they can say, "Yup, looks like she's still kickin'."  :o)  And that's fine.  I hope to eventually post some of my writing projects on here, too.  I'm a little reluctant to post a lot of that because, I mean, we all know how easy it is to snatch things off the web.  But I'd like to share stuff with you guys and hopefully get some construcive feedback (like "That paragraph is really, really aweful!  Take it out, shred it, and never speak of it again!!").  I suppose that's really all there is to it.  But that's okay, isn't it?  :oP  If nothing else, it'll just make me write more and writing more is always a good thing.  So that's all for today.  Have a fantastic weekend everybody!  Be sure to get to church on Sunday (or Saturday, I suppose), and spend time with your heavenly Father, too!  Love and blessings, ya'll!

      Goodness!  What's the world coming to?  I've started a blog!  I'm not really sure how this is going to work right now.  I'm very new to this whole deal-y-bob.  But we'll give it a try.  Hey, maybe it'll take off.  Who knows?  I'm not really going to say much today because what all I wanted to say I already did say on Nathan's website and if you're here, you already know where that is.  Hee, hee.  So, I'm just going to let it go today and head on home for supper.  I hope you're all doing great!  Love and blessings, ya'll!

      Two years ago, I worked at the Ren fest in Shakopee, MN, and let me tell ya, that was an eye-opening job. The people that I worked with there were completely different from the people that I tended to run into in a regular day. It was fun in a way, just to see how "the rest of the world" related to each other and how I fit into that. It was hard sometimes, too, because I know that I am not like them in many ways, primarily because I know that there is a reason for my existence and that it is not for me to enjoy life as much as possible. I don't think I ever really witnessed to anyone there, not even by the way that I behaved, which is something I'm not proud of.  I live in a pretty cloistered environment most of the time here. I mean, I work in a Christian environment. I don't go out in the evenings or the weekends to any type of events except for church. Any other place I go to, Walmart or the grocery store or the coffee shop, I don't really talk or interact with people much. And even if I did, this is the "Bible belt." People around here are pretty well-behaved. Not all, but the majority, probably.  Lately, I've started reading some of the forums at Keenspot. My goodness! If you're ever looking for a secular culture, you'll find it there. Some spots are pretty tame and others are really crude. I was sitting there reading earlier on my lunch break, just amazed at the things that come off of these people's fingers! But I don't want to go off on that. I just keep thinking about how I do and don't fit into the secular world. I'm borrowing a Rich Mullins CD from Debi and listening to him makes me think about how he finished what he was asked by God to do and God took him home. How wonderful would it be to go home?! But I have yet to do the things that God has asked me to do and I'm sure that it has a lot to do with the secular world by which I am surrounded. And one of the many questions I keep asking myself is how will I communicate with that culture?

      Well, Luke made it through another tour! From the sounds of it, this one went much better than last year's. (Of course, that doesn't take much.) It's very nice having him back. He's mowed the lawn for me. He's even reformatted my computer, which is very exciting for me. I'm still planning on replacing it fairly soon (any recommendations on systems, people?), but it's needed some work for a while. He even opened and closed the car doors for me and Chanda when we went out over the weekend. He'd never done that before. It was kind of nice. It's nice just to have someone there, but when he's a gentleman and all that, it's even better! :o) So, the house is a little messy. That's one of the things that hit me first--things weren't where I left them and other things just showed up out of nowhere and stayed where I wouldn't have left them. But he mentioned cleaning this afternoon, and, really, it doesn't bother me that much . . . yet.  I'm just so happy he's home!!

      I'm trying really hard not to be crabby today.  I didn't want to come to work. It's a gorgeous day outside and work is really not fun right now. We're in the middle of getting ready for new students which means trying to figure out where they think they're living in two weeks--on campus or off--and how we're going to get them all the information that they need and just tons and tons of important but annoying things. I'm glad that they're coming, but could they just let me know in writing where they're planning to live? And top onto that all the stuff that I'm doing for Institutional Research, which really isn't much, but it's time consuming and really confusing.  So, all in all, I'd have much rather stayed home and done yard work.    "Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."     ~1 Cor 10:31

      Just heard from Dr. Clark's office--the culture came up negative. So now I'm going back to see him again on the 16th to find out what to do about this cough. Ugh. Doctor's appointment number 8 this summer. And right on the first day of new student orientation, too.  I'm a little crabby.

       "Teach me, Lord Jesus, to live simply and love purely, like a child, and to know that you are unchanged in Your attitudes and actions toward me. Give me not to hungering for the 'strange, rare, and peculiar' when the common, ordinary, and regular--rightly taken--will suffice to feed and satisfy the soul. Bring struggle when I need it; take away ease at your pleasure. "

      They have this thing in churches around here called "Homecoming." I'd never really heard of a church having a homecoming party, but apparently, they do. Poplar Springs invited Karen Peck and New River, a gospel singing group that are apparently pretty popular, and had a big old pot-luck afterwards. It was the fullest I've ever seen that building, and let me tell you, it's a big building. It was pretty cool. I'm not all that big on gospel music, but they weren't bad. And there was a lot of good food. Yummy. :o)  Luke's going to be singing in a concert in Hartwell on Thursday so I'm going to go hear him. I'm very excited about that. He's going to come home with me afterwards, too, along with someone else, but I can't remember which of the girls it is. Chanda, probably. It'll be so nice to have someone in the house again! It's been hard the last couple of days. It's been very difficult to appreciate my singleness. Very.
