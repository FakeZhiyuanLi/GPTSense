      Hmmmmm...I realized as I had mistakenly typed "a twitchy right eyelid brings good lunch" when I really meant to type "a twitchy right eyelid brings good luck". I think I will leave it though, just in case a twitchy eyelid can provide me with my afternoon meal.

      Blepharospasm is the medical term for when your eyelid muscles repeatedly and rhythmically contract. Blepharo means "eyelid". Spasm means "uncontrolled muscle contraction". The term blepharospasm ['blef-a-ro-spaz-m] can be applied to any abnormal blinking or eyelid tic or twitch resulting from any cause, ranging from dry eyes to Tourette's syndrome to tardive dyskinesia.   I have a twitchy eyelid. It's my left eye, and it began a couple of days ago. It was just my top eyelid, but now my bottom eyelid has decided to join in on the fun.&nbsp;It is indeed unfortunate, since I have read that a twitchy  right  eyelid brings good lunch, whereas a twitchy  left  eyelid brings only "doom".&nbsp;I can feel it coming,&nbsp;(the twitch, not the doom)&nbsp;my eye will squint up, and then..twitch twitch twitch twitch twitch. At this point, I will put my finger over my eye to calm the blepharospasm, and continue on with my day. I googled what I&nbsp;assumed to be the&nbsp;proper medical term "twitchy eyelid" and came up with this.&nbsp;I should sleep more, be leased stressed, and stop drinking caffine. I have drafted a letter to my boss to inform her that due to a medical condition, I will be unable to accept any work this week, and that I will need to be allowed to come in around lunch time and leave by 3:00.&nbsp; As for the caffine, well, that's just a chance I am going to have to take.   Here it comes again...twitch twitch twitch....   I have to go by Publix at lunch and drop off a prescription at the&nbsp;pharmacy. Perhaps I will ask the pharmacist if he could recommend anything for a blepharospasm.

      I&nbsp;did get some boiled peanuts on Friday. We stopped at a little road side stand and bought "a big ol heaping cup like 'at" for $3. The lady working the stand was super nice. When she was filling up the cup, she said "boy howdy, it sure is hot out here, don't you think? I sure would like to be out on a river boat fishing" I thought it was a wonderful idea. We were going to stop by her stand on the way home on Sunday, but she wasn't open. Besides, I had just eaten a bag of Hot Fries in it's entirity, so I was pretty full.

      I am headed up to the mountains of North Carolina this afternoon. Fitz and I are going up to Tuckaway when I leave work in 43 minutes. I think we will do a little urlLink  geocaching , go see Beauty and the Beast, and maybe go to the  urlLink biltmore house . Whatever the case, I hope I can find some good boiled peanuts up there.

      By the way, the time on these blogs isn't really when I wrote them. It's what time it was in Jamaica when I wrote them. Just a little fun in honor of my sweet sister, since Jamaica is the Land she Loves!

      So I woke up this morning at 3:00. And I don't mean I eased into an awakened state, I mean I woke straight up. I stayed in the bed for about half of an hour before I finally gave in and got up. I did 3 loads of laundry, cleaned the bathroom (and I mean really cleaned) changed all the sheets, and cleaned up a bunch of other crap. As I was cleaning, I was listening to a fabulous Vineyard CD, Dwell. Track # 8 is called Waiting on You Again.&nbsp;The chorus goes " Here I am....Here I am...Waiting on You again" and having never really payed attention attention to the rest of it, I thought "what a great thought, standing in wait for the Lord, waiting for him to tell you to move...that's how I want to be...waiting on His Word"   It's at this point that I must interrupt myself to say I wonder why, out of all creation God would choose us. I suppose in His infinite wisdom, He realized we would be too stupid to do much by ourselves. Jesus told us to consider the lily, which did not toil and spin, yet&nbsp;Soloman,&nbsp; the king of&nbsp;Israel,  in all his splendor was not clothed in as much beauty as the lily. &nbsp;I am sure if I had been standing there, He would have gotten as far as  urlLink "Consider how the lilies grow. They ... Before I wandered off to pick flowers. My sister has a dog, named Miss Margaret. If you push her butt down to the floor, say "sit" and hand her a treat about five times, by the &nbsp;six time, you will probably be able to just say "Sit" and hand her the treat, and she will sit all by herself. I wish I were that easily trainable. I have to do something stupid about, oh, 76 times before I finally realize what I am doing. Thank you Lord that you chose us, otherwise...   Anyways, back to the story. As I was folding the 2nd load of laundry this morning, I actually listened to the rest of the song. The first words? "I've been down this road so many times before. And here I am on this road again. I'm asking for Mercy, in spite of my sins. Oh Lord. You are the only one who loves me this way." It hit me like a ton of bricks. This song isn't about waiting for the Lord to move you. It's about how we sin and sin and SIN and SIN and SIN some more, and He just loves us and loves us and loves us some more. It's about confessing and waiting on His forgiveness. How selfish and proud I am. How very like me to take a song about the greatness of God's mercy and make it about&nbsp;what I want.&nbsp;How often do I expect someone to come and do&nbsp;penance for a wrong against me? How often do I want them to pay, and to feel badly,  horribly  for what they might have done to me? And yet, we are able to just stand at the feet of God and said "here I am. I'm asking for mercy." and He will put it as far as the East is from the West.&nbsp;   What a mighty God we serve.

      Is there anything else in the world that will make you feel as stupid as a computer? I am really smart about somethings, I swear. But this dumb ol' thing... I work with a man who thinks computers are the incarnation of evil in our world. And that if we keep using, and relying on computers like we do, they will eventually take over the world. He explained it to me for an hour one day. Anyways, the fun for the day is this&nbsp; urlLink here . Happy Hump Day everyone!

       SN and COH set up a tip jar for me yesterday. It was on the counter in front of my desk when I came back from lunch. I was telling them jokes when I left for lunch, so they decided to reward me for my efforts. I have used $1.05 from the jar today. I purchased a coke and a package of softbatch cookies from our vending machines. I have $1.17 left. I should think of some new jokes.

      I am tired this morning.  I don't know why. Maybe it is the fact that I have stayed up late the last 2 nights to watch the USA gymnasts take 2 silver medals. If I don't get enough sleep one night (and by enough sleep, I mean 8 hours) I turn really pissy. If I don't get enough 2 nights or more, I turn punchy and slap-happy. That is my mental state today.  We had the nicest wiatress last night at Olive Garden. You see, I don't  love  Italian food, but Fitz does and we were celebrating his new promotion. So he got to pick. Anyways, I don't  love  Italian food, but Olive Garden has then great chicken fingers. I usually just get them on the appetizer plate, but the last time we were there, I saw some little kid with a plate of chicken fingers and fries. So this time, I asked Melissa, our super nice waitress if I could get that. She smiles and said "of course you can" and she didn't even make me feel stupid for ordering off the kids menu. I like that. We left her a huge tip.

      Heather, Leana, Chris, Amy, Fitz and I played Texas Hold 'em on Saturday night. Amy and I are terribly similar. Our attention span is, oh, 15 minutes long. I can usually hold out a little longer, but Men's gymnastics was on NBC for the Olympics, and I just dropped all my candy in the pot and went to the living room to watch. We play with Starbursts and Hershey's miniatures. I found it rather difficult to play with Leana, because she is lactose intolerant, which means she can't eat chocolate. So she kept betting away all her Hershey's and her Reese's because she couldn't eat them. We didn't know if she was betting because she had a good hand or because she could eat the chocolate. Eventually Fitzy took it all. We took home a big bag of candy, and I ate it until I thought I was going to be sick.  So I started working out again last week. I have read, and I believe it is true, that it is easier to stay motivated if you have a goal. So I thought I would get on a plan to train for a tiathlon. I found a 21 week program online. So I started training last week. And by training I mean running. And by running, I mean walking. My husband is very sweet and walks with me, even though my legs are about half the length of his and if he walks at my pace, he's is barely doing more than standing still. But, it is still sweet.  I feel very icky this morning, and I am planning on working a half day. I got sick this morning, so I am drinking V8 Strawberry Kiwi Splash to try and replenish some of the good stuff I lost this morning. One of the instructors asked me if I was drinking a Bloody Mary. Yes. Yes I am. What a goober. It's 8 o'clock in the morning on a Monday and I don't EVER drink. Yes, this is a Bloody Mary.

      Brothers & Sons Vending is the company that fills up our vending machines. Well, as of this morning, there wasn't much in there except some BBQ pork rinds and some banana danish. To make matters worse, the coke machine is out of Diet Coke. The locals began to riot. I was sent to Chick-fil-a on a biscuit run. And this is what I learned. If you go to Chick-fil-a and order 13 chicken biscuits for your co-workers, they will give you at least one free one. Eat that one yourself.

      I just spoke with Shakira from Honey-Bun cupcakes in Kingston Jamaica! The cupcakes are coming, the cupcakes are coming!!! For the low low price of 35 American Dollars (that's 65 cents a package and 25 dollars shipping) 40 scrumpcious Jamaican cupcakes are going to be on their way to Tater by the end of the day! I don't know how long it takes for cupcakes to come DHL from Jamaica, but I am sure they will be here by the end of the week!  Cupcakes! Cupcakes! Cupcakes!  In other news, I didn't get to go to Mo Mo Ya this weekend, but I did go to Ted's Montana grill, which is just as good. They have, hands down, the best crushed ice and lemonade this side of Overland Drive. Plus, they have homeade french fries, and you really can't beat the with a stick.  Fitz and I picked up "The Invisible Cache" this weekend. It is a  urlLink geocache  hiden at Elache Nature Center. You have to find 6 hidden clues on a trail that is a 4 mile loop, and then the last clue gives you the actual coordinates for the cache, which was hidden within .2 miles of where we parked our car. It was such wonderful weather, and being outside in it made me anxious for fall.  As the crowning jewel in a super fun weeked, Heather and Sonrisa and I went to the Mall of GA yesterday afternoon and Heather bounced on one of those trampolines where they put you in a harness and strap elastic cords to you and pull you up in the air and you bounce and flip and what not. It was a site to behold.  Fitzette Took: Sun Left: World in eternal darkness

      My mission for the weekend: convince someone to take me to Mo Mo Ya for some chicken and steak with fried rice.  mmm mmm good. I wonder why they always bring you that horrible soup and salad at Japanese restaurants? First of all, it sucks. Second of all, its not like you wuld have room for it. With rice, vegetables, and chicken or steak or shrimp or scallops or lobster or whatever it is that you get therem why on earth would you fill your belly with that soup and salad. I say, forget the appetizers! Bring up the chef! Bring us the fried rice!

      I am delighted to say that soon and very soon, 20 double packages of honey bun cupcakes will be on their way to my lovely tater from Kingston Jamaica!!! Apparently, the cupcakes are little bakes cakes of heaven, so maybe sister will allow me to taste one or two of them!
