       Today is the first day of summer break that I would have normally been in school and what a day it was.  Right now I'm working on this DVD program for my dad, and it's not working, ugh *growls to self*.  Anyways, I'm had a good time going to eat ice cream with Jeremiah and his little sister Rachael when this cop comes up.  Apparently there was some poor guy sleeping on a bench.  I don't think the guy was from around here, but he was supposedly waiting at a bus stop to go downtown.  I think he must have just fallen asleep, but someone called the police on him.  Apparently your not supposed to sleep on public benches (what's up with that?  We pay for them; can't we sleep on them?)  So the officer made the guy get up.  He walked off and I didn't see him again, but I sure did feel sorry for him.  I'm having/I had a nice talk with Colleen just being goofy, but I think I may have made Steph mad or sad by telling her something I knew about someone else.  Idk, I hope she's ok.

       Well, I had a nice long post typed up; then I had to restart my computer so it got messed up.  Anyways what I was going to say is that I have found two best friends through much trials and tribulations.  Through those trials, I have learned how to separate my true feelings from who I am and how I act.  See, I've had affections for my two best friends, Stephanie and Colleen.  Somehow I needed to learn how to keep myself from always expressing how I felt.  Now I've got two great friends that I'm extatic to have back.  Much thanks goes out to my cousin Jeremiah for help, the g-mail account, and everything he's done for me thoughout the years.

       This is kinda weird.  I'm not in much pain from my teeth.  I don't think I'm any more or less foolish which is a good sign.  Actually, I'm not having a bad time having the little bugars out.  I get good food (none of it is solid though).  Good things like mashed potatoes and stuffing.  Mmmmmmmmmm.  My cheeks aren't very swollen and I got to was Monk with my sister last night.  I did throw up once last night, but besides that, all is going well.  Doesn't this just beat all though:  yesterday Colleen called me and asked me if she could see me.  This was after I had woken up from my surgery and I didn't want to see anyone or do anything.  She said that she was lost so I told her and Beth how to get home.  Another something horrible is that I missed Stephanie being on yesterday!!!  Man, she was on and I missed her.  Anyways, hopefully my recovery will go by quickly.  I finally got every song on Bre's CD except for 4 optional songs.  I'll prolly get those too soon.  Anyways, the bad thing about getting these teeth out is that I'm almost always tired so I've got to go ok?  Talk to ya'll later.  -Josh  P.S.  Ice Cream tastes really good. :)

       Hey there, friend.  This week has been quite a week.  I've been so incredibly busy it's excruciating.  I've worked over everyday this week except yesterday.  Of course I've had many interesting customers come through, but I'm beginning to see and recognize the same ones that come in daily.  I'm learning the fine art of running.  I worked back in drive through yesterday, and I had lunch with JDR today.  Friend trouble is on the rise as Colleen and I aren't getting along too well.  I haven't talked with Stephanie since that one night when she didn't talk to me up until Wednesday.  It was nice seeing her again, but we didn't talk all that much.  If I were a little less busy, I'd prolly call her, but I don't have time.  The thing is she acted like she may call me sometime and then she never does it.  I don't think she's mad at me or anything, but I so wish she would get a hold of me so we could talk like we used to.  I need my best friends back.  Tomorrow (prolly today by time I get this posted) I get my wisdom teeth out.  Thank you so much all of you out there that are praying for me.  It's really an encouragement to me.  Here's a random side comment (I don't intend on making this a normal item in my blogs).  Two music artists make me think of specific people.  Whenever I hear a song by Dido, I always think about Melissa; and whenever I hear a song by No Doubt, I think about Colleen.  Don't ask me why because I really don't know.  I think it maybe something about the artist themselves.  I can almost hear Colleen's when I hear any no doubt song and the storylines, melancholy mood, and smooth R&B style of Dido somehow just remind me of Melissa.  Eh, well there it is for whatever it's worth to ya.  Night ya'll.  -Josh

       Hey, be excited all!  I posted on time today!!!!  Yaaaaaay!!!  Anyways, you can calm down now; I'm about to start with the boring stuff.  Today was THE busiest day I've ever had, and on top of all that, I had to stay over.  We had some kinda high powered corporate execs come in to the store.  Something about some new kinda coffee.  Because of that, everything had to be perfect.  On top of that, the business made it an interesting day.  I messed something up pretty well, but I had a pretty nice recovery (I think anyways).  I had this one lady come through and she asked for a small drink.  Well, after I had totaled her order, she asked if I had counted that as a senior drink.  The lady didn't look old at all, but I figured, "Hey the customer's always right."  I apologized and said that I got confused because she didn't look a day over 16.  She kinda laughed and I guess I had one of those customer appreciation moments where they get that comfortable feeling that makes them want to come back later because of the friendly service.  IDK, maybe I read into that a little too much; we'll just have to see if I see her again.  I went in depth into the exciting and busy busy busy world of a runner.  They're the ones who take the food to the people.  I wasn't very good at it at first, but I picked it up kinda quickly I think.  I'm obviously not perfect yet, but I'm not bad.  It's kinda weird, almost every time I see Hortencia, she looks at me and smiles and it's some weird/goofy/cute kinda smile that makes me cheese.  IDK, it's hard to explain.  Anyways, because I ran I saw her quite a bit today.  I also had the excellent pleasure of talking quite a bit with Claudia and Veery (I have no idea how to spell her name).  Veery is another hispanic, but she's pretty funny.  Claudia is just hilarious; so between the two of them I was laughing pretty much the whole time.  After I got back from work I started immediately on Bre's CD's cause I have to get them done tomorrow.  But while they are d/ling (down loading) I started reading some of my friends blogs.  They're all miserable!  It makes me feel bad because I can't do anything to make them feel any better.  Ashley (thanks for reading ;)) is having all kinds of family problems and future crisises, and Jeremiah (thanks for being such a dedicated friend a reader) is lonely and hurt because he can't see how much people do appreciate him.  I'm all sucked up in my work that I can't do much at all besides work, get chores done, and pray.  Not only that, but I haven't heard from Colleen in a couple of days.  I have no clue how she's doing.  I just wish there were more hours in the day so I could do all the things I want to do and all the things I need to do and on top of that, sleep 9-10 hrs a night.  If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman? (not that you ever called me superman in the first place..... nvm, lol)  BTW, I want to give a special holler out to Brit...(tany?).  Perhaps I've seen you as well.  I don't have a link to your blog to return the compliment so I'll just say thank you.  BTW, I'll see if I can look for you when we go to your jambouree sometime in August or early September.  All that said, I'm signin out.  Holla back all my party peoples (those of you who are less lively are also invited to post as well ;) ).

       Hey ya'll.  I know how much you guys have wanted to hear from me *rolls his eyes* so I'll let you know what's been holding me up.  This week has been yet another week of work, boredom, fun, and, yes, pain.  Monday and Tuesday of this week, I didn't work because the people at work were too busy for me (I guess they had too many people coming in).  Not only was I off, but it was also raining so I couldn't enjoy the day.  I was stuck inside on my computer.  Now because this happened two days in a row I got restricted to 4 hrs a day on my cpu.  That + talking to friends + blog + everything else I have to do online can't be done in 4 hrs. so it may take me a while to update (sorry).  Absolutely nothing happened those two days; so I didn't post anything.  Wednesday, I worked and something good happened.  They didn't make me take a break that day.  Something bad happened also.  They made me clock out 45 mins early (which means I got an early extended break tacked on the end).  After not working two days in a row, that was a death nail.  Fortunately Thursday I got some extra time tacked on the end of my day.  At the end of that day, I worked a little with my cousin Seth running for him in drive through. (that means I was getting the food for him)  The only thing is I was helping him off the clock because I was waiting for my Aunt to take me home (Seth's Mom actually).  Anyways, I gained valuable running skills by helping him so it wasn't a total loss.  On another bright side, one of the managers told this extremely annoying girl (Melinda, I don't know if I told ya'll about that or not) to go home and not come back the next day because of something bad she did.  Because she couldn't come in, I got to take her place for the next day.  Working makes me happy :)!!!  Friday was quite a day.  I came in at 8 instead of the normal 7 wich was so weird.  I was working and doin my thing and I saw an old schoolmate, Joshua Wiloughby.  He told me he was in Military school (Boot Camp, lol) and was going to graduate the same year as me.  Anyways, I had many other interesting customers that day too.  One of them, Claudia had (I can't remember if it was Friday or Thursday that this one came through) (Claudia is a good friend of mine, my mom's and just about everyone else there.  She speaks fluent Spansh and is a very funny lady).  This kid looked like he was a 6th grader that was a little big (tall and kinda thick) for his age, but he had the education of a 1st grader which makes me think he was mentally handicapped.  Anyways he talked very loud and slow.  When I first heard him I though he was talking loud because Claudia was Hispanic, but I soon found out that wasn't true.  He counted out his money (5 $1 bills) one by one very loudly.  When he was done and he handed the money to Claudia he asked her if that was right like 5 times.  It was so funny I could barely hold the laughter in until he left.  Right after it happened, Claudia and I had a good laugh, then she went to go tell a couple of her other friends and they all laughed.  I had a couple customers that I thought were Christians, but I wasn't sure.  Friday, Mike (the second highest manager there) said we (he specifically mentioned me a couple of times) were doing a great job on front counter.  He told me he needed to get me more hours.  He already messed up my trust once so I can't be for sure if he was just saying that or if he was serious.  Anyways, one of the two highlights of this day was my involvement with a co-worker.  Her name is Hortencia (I think that's a very beautiful name, but anyways...).  During one of our non-busy times, she asked me to smile.  I don't know if she knows English, but someone had to translate for her.  After I smiled, she laughed and went back to doing her grill job.  After I got off, she asked me my name.  Once again, someone had to translate for her.  I kinda got the impression that she liked me.  I think she's cute, and having a cute girl talk to you is pretty exciting (well for a single loser who's never dated before it is).  Anyways after that day I had to walk home.  It took me about an hour to walk all the way home.  I walked because I ate before I left.  When I got home, I took a shower and got ready for Billy's party (Billy is an old friend from a couple of years ago).  It was always an inside joke among him, me, and his girlfriend Jennifer that she never threw him a party and she threw some other guy who wasn't her boy friend a party.  So, after a couple of years, she finally threw him a party and I was invited.  So, it was Jen, Billy, Stephanie, and me hanging out at Jennifer's house.  We got a pizza and rented a couple of movies, scary movies.  Boo! lol  Anyways don't ever watch the House on Haunted Hill.  It was filled with cussing and other not so good stuff.  I also saw Darkness Falls.  They had maybe 3 cuss words in the whole movie.  I wasn't scared by either one.  Idk, they were kinda stupid in that regard, but I was surprised at how clean the second one was.  Anyways, after that Billy took me home and we all had a great time that night.  Today (Saturday) was pretty cut and dry.  I woke up and instantly my dad told me to eat and then cut my yard and my neighbor's yard all by myself.  I don't know about you, but I would like to have woken up first and heard a good morning or something.  At any rate, I cut grass all day, then I got back inside to rest for a second before we went out to go play some baseball (just my sisters and my parents).  I had 6 rbi's for anyone that cares (that's 6 runs batted in).  I wasn't too bad overall.  After that, we went to Walmart and then I got online so send the beautiful message to you guys.  I hope you appreciate it.  Anyways, Steph was on and I didn't get to talk to her.  She was talking to Kyle about something that sounded serious so I let her do what she needed to do.  She said that I was sweet for letting her do that.  That was kind of weird.  Nobody ever appreciates the time someone else takes waiting for them.  It made me feel appreciated.  I'm on a quest for strength: spiritually, mentally, socially, and on the mental/spiritual aspect of physical.  I realized I depend a lot on my friends and because of that I was kinda hurt by the fact that Steph couldn't talk to me.  I wasn't mad or sad at her, but just sad that I couldn't talk to her.  I then realized I can't depend so much on my friends because they can't always be there.  I'm glad I was able to completely destroy my emotions and let her talk to Kyle.  It made me feel like I really did something good for once.  Anyways, I'm out.  Talk to you guys later.  Strong man, Joshua

       My Computer was acting weird yesterday.  For some reson I couldn't load web pages, but I could chat on IM (which was constantly kicking me off) and down load files (which were constantly disconnecting).  Bre (a friend of mine) gave me a project to work on.  She wants me to make a CD for her (not my own music of course because I don't make any).  Anyway my dad called SBC because couldn't log on today and they couldn't help him the first time.  He made a "threat" that he was going to switch to cable.  Wether that's going to happen (which would be nice) I have no clue.  The second time he called, they got it fixed.  I'm about to go eat dinner, so I'll post a little bit later.  Bye.

       These next two days, I worked with my mom and got fater at what I did.  I'm working on both my speed, and my remembrance of customers.  In addition to that, I try to keep myself busy by grabbing trays, helping run, and doing whatever else I can just so long as there's a lull or there's nothing to do except wait for stuff.  Weirdest thing I heard was that nuts and bananas make Rob's (my afore mentioned supervisor) ears itch.  Working hard gets tiring so I decided to take today off to rest and perhaps get my and my neighbor's grass cut.  I won't be able to cut the yard becuase it rained very hard last night.  I figured I'd still be able to meet Ashley (I had planned with her the night before to do so) except I wouldn't be in work clothes.  Much to my anger/disappointment/sorrow, I couldn't meet her because my dad sprung some project up on me.  Now Ashley has to be disappointed because she traveled half an hour to get there and only got breakfast (we were supposed to meet outside McDonald's).  I talked to my Mom about it last night, but she seems to think I was being sneaky about it.  I guess she didn't understand that I was going to meet her up there because when I asked her if I could ride my bike up there, she acted like, why didn't you tell me you were going to meet some girl.  I don't think meeting her was an issue, but I guess I have to make things painfully obvious in the future.  I am extremely disappointed and angry though that I didn't get to go up there.  I had planned this out and it fell through because of some mystery pop up project that had to be done right then my dad gave to me.  Because of that stupid surprise, I missed my one opportunity to meet her, and a bunch of people (mostly her) prolly think I'm the biggest jerk because I wasn't there.  I can't apologize enough for not being there, even though I don't think apologizing did any good whatsoever.  If there's any way I can make it up to you, Ashley, let me know.  I'll prolly post a little later on some other stuff, but I didn't want to forget what I already was gonna post like I did about what my work days were like.  Signing out with the utmost disappointment, Joshua Robert Guynn

       Hey guys, here's the quick view of my first two days back to work.  For those of you who don't know I work at the Mcdonald's in Broad Ripple.  They have a cafe and a player piano in there.  I'm sorry, I can't hook anyone up with free food.  Anyways, here goes.  Obviously working in Broad Ripple I run into some of the strangest people.  I had this one goth guy come into work and he was talking really weird.  He was speaking incredibly intelligently, but his voice sounded nothing like one that had the tongues of a braniac.  He was like, "Hey brother; can I get two ice waters?  Hydration is essential on a day like today."  I wanted to laugh so hard, but I kept it in.  The head supervisor over the store is soooo goofy.  He's a nice guy, but he's got a gooberish sense of humor.  His name is Rob and he is married.  He says some goofy things from time to time, so I'll put them on here when I remember them.  I know today (Tuesday) I had an average serve time of 40 seconds.  I asked Rob if that was good and he was like, "Yeah, that's not bad."  That's not too goofy, but I guess you'd have to have been there.  I'm still getting faster and faster at what I do; so it cuases some tension every now and then.  Especially when I have customers like this one lady.  Ok, she didnt' know what she wanted, but all she had was change.  And then when she finally decided what she thought she wanted she changed it and had to recount the change.  Ugh!  Then you of course have the snotty customer that gets mad if you check to make sure you've got the order right, or their just mad because they're mad.  Idk, I've had a couple of people like that.  This one kid came up to me and was like, "Do strawberries regularly (I can't pronounce that word by the way) come with a chocolate shake cause I had quite a few in mine."  I felt like saying, "No, only the special customers get them."  Or going back to ask if they did just to make the kid look stupid, but I just gave him another shake and left it alone.  I work with some cool people so from time to time, I'll bring them up.  Like Sophia, who works back in drive through, is pretty cool, but she'll cuss customers out when she doesn't have the microphone on.  I wish I didn't think this, but I sounds so funny the way she does it.  Of course I don't approve of it, but sometimes I feel like laughing so hard.  Anyways, I've had a tough day at work today, so I'll just close off with my devotional verses and what I got from them.  Proverbs 4:5,7 say "Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.  Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting, get understanding."  Those verses pointed out to me that I needed to seek wisdom out principally.  The other things fall in line so much easier if you simply apply the things you learn from God's word.  Wealth, satisfaction, friendships all seem easer when you approach them in God's way.  Then in Galatians 4:29-30, God's word says, "But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit, even it is now.  Nevertheless, what saith the scriptures?  Cast out the bondwoman and her son for the son of the bondwoam shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman."  That meant quite a bit to me.  First of all, it's an allegory for the story of Haggar (called Aggar in this passage.  Something with the translation change I guess) and Abraham.  You all know the story, I think.  Abraham was promised a child (Isaac through Sarah) but he wanted it his own way (Ishmael through Hagar).  Ishmael tormented Isaac for whatever reason.  Because of this Abraham cast out Hagar and Ishmael.  I thought it was wrather interesting the allegory he used in this passage because he didn't just cast out the antagonist (sin).  He also cast out the cause of his antagonism (sin's root or sin's cause if you will).  I think the fact that it was an allegory using humans kinda showed me something that I didn't and still don't want to see.  Of course if I don't go with what the Bible says (like it says in Proverbs) there will be no "ornament of grace" about my neck.  That grace spoke to me because, if you guys know me very well, I like to be smooth, gracefull, refined, well-mannered.  Not abiding by that wisdom takes the sauvity out of my life which stresses me out.  Because of this I made a choice tonight that may change quite a bit.  Colleen may not have been mad at me, but she sure is now.  I've been extremely busy so I haven't been able to talk to her as much as I would like.  I've been stressed so I thought applying this verse would give me back some suavity.  Colleen will play mind games from time to time almost daring the person to say something bad about her.  For example (not an actual occurence) she'd say "I'm so ugly."  Of course she's not, but it's almost as if she's daring you to say that she is.  In a more practical version of something that happened, she said something bad about herself that was true, and I decided to tell her the truth (at least as I saw it) and she didn't like that (who would).  I'm not supposed to lie to make her feel better, so I told her the truth (as I saw it) and now I know for a fact she's angrier than a hive of wasps after being teased.  Now obviously if she wanted me to lie to make her feel better, or if she wanted my perspective to be one that was not true, she'd be hagar (the one presenting the trouble to me).  I don't want to push her away because I value her too much, but if she's going to behave this way, I don't have much choice.  Please post comments to help me with this situation.  Anyway, I'm tired so, this is the man with the not really very good plan,  Joshua Guynn  P.S.  Thank you once again Jeremiah for teaching me some of the basics of HTML.  Because of you, I was able to add my friend Ashley Broscoe onto my list.  Thanks once agian.

       Hey there readers.  Sorry I haven't posted in a few days.  As I'm sure a few of you already know, I went to Chicago for the weekend.  Starting Friday we left at 8 and returned about 2 on Sunday (today).  Here's everything we did and some applications I've learned in my trip and a little before.  Well, Thursday was quite a day (yes the day before we left).  I decided to have Stephanie over because it sounded like a fun idea, and I hadn't done it in the longest time.  There was a ton of preparation that had to be done Wednesday though first.  I was feeling pretty bad on Wednesday night because I had cleaned up the whole house pretty much and Steph was a little too busy to talk to me on the internet after I spent all of that time cleaning.  I got mad and logged into invisible mode on the YIM so if someone wrote me I'd know, but I walked off from my computer so frustrated I couldn't think straight.  My mom noticed my emotional state and asked me what was going on.  I told her (I'm so glad I did) and she asked me what was the sense in what I was doing.  I couldn't come up with anything.  I went back online and just waited.  I didn't know what to say, and I was very frustrated at my predicament.  Eventually Stephanie asked me why I logged off.  I said that I didn't know.  After that we got into some huge dialoge about our friendship.  It got so late that she said we would pick it up tomorrow so we could resolve the problem.  That was on my mind the whole day Thursday.  I woke up after four hours of sleep to go to the dentists office.  He said I have no cavities, but that I really really need to get my wisom teeth out because they weren't working at all.  (jk)  They're growing in sideways, like 90˚ off.  I decided that I wanted a prize for my teeth; so, I got some disguise glasses with the mustache, the big nose, and the eyebrows (that was my stupid moment for the day).  After that we went to pick up Stephanie.  All that stuff was still on my mind as we went to pick her up.  We picked her up and I just started talking about other things.  This carried into our bike ride about the hood.  I showed her everything around including Butler campus.  When we got back to my house, she showed me her house and stuff on Animal Crossing (I have to get that game) and then we played Super Smash Bros. (That's the game I need to get).  We did a bunch of other stuff like watch movies and play some other games.  I found out I'm incredibly horrible at air hockey; don't ask why, I guess we're just like oil and water; we just don't mix.  When it came down to the end of day, we never talked that problem through.  I would have liked to a couple of times, but the times when I wanted to my little sis was there and I didn't feel comfortable talking in front of her.  I doubt we could have come up with a solution anyways.  OH! I forgot to say what the predicament was.  I won't got into specifics on any level.  There may be some guy in her future, and I don't like that because it's going to take away from the friendship her and I share.  Because of that reason, I become irritated when she starts to like a guy.  Being irritated with that makes me irritated in myself as well because I know I shouldn't be irritated.  She has a right to like a guy if she wants.  So, we never got to work through that problem which kinda irritates me knowing that I still don't know how to control my emotions.  All that happened on those days.  Then on Friday, we woke up at 8:00 in the morning.  I had quite a road trip to get there.  As I was going up, I had a couple snacks then I went to sleep.  I woke up just before we reached Illinois to see all of these signs for Krazy Kaplan's fireworks.  It was some picture with a derranged monkey holding a firecracker.  It was hilarious.  When we got to the hotel, I helped unpack, then we went to the cubs game.  The trip to get there was quite an adventure.  I rode the L to get there.  For those of you who don't know, the L is a huge train thing made up of several trains.  We got on the blue line at O Hare and switched to the red line at Washington.  We got off the redline at Cubs stadium.  I loved the hustle and bustle, the crowded quarters, the forceful rocking of the train.  It was awesome.  While at Wrigley field, my mom and dad went into a gift store, I just waited outside.  I loved the smells there (aside from the beer and cigarette smell).  We got to our seats and I found out I couldn't see home plate or first thanks to a pole that was in my way.  I had a hot dog from the park.  It was awesome!  After the game (I was so sad that the cubs lost) we went back to the hotel to get a good night sleep.  I saw two movies for the first time, Haunted mansion (incredibly stupid, but kinda funny at times) and Jumanji (really great, funny and over all really clean).  I was shocked at some of the language in Haunted Mansion.  I mean, it's a Disney movie for crying out loud; the story line wasn't too great either.  Then I went to sleep.  The next day I was suprised at the fact that I got 8 hrs. of sleep.  I was also surprised to find that we weren't going to ride the L again as we had planned earlier.  We decided to ride a bus to get to this huge mall.  I was feeling really bad because the full affect of my selfishness in my friendship with Stephanie hit me.  I shouldn't keep her from liking anybody just so I can be her friend.  If she likes some guy, of course it's going to hurt, but that's not my place to get in the way of her happiness.  I knew I told her earlier that I was going to get something, so this frustration of my depression made me determined to get something really great for her.  The bus ride was pretty cool.  I've never ridden on a bus at all before; so it was quite an experience.  We got off at the mall and started looking around.  I looked in tons of stores for stuff, but didn't find much.  I went in a couple of stores for me, of course, and a couple of stores with my family.  The most unique store I saw was the Apple store (named for apple computers of course).  I realize how advanced technology is now, but that store made technology look advanced.  I-pods, cpu software, speakers all made to look so advanced, it was incredible.  We got hungry so we all went to go eat at this burger restaurant called Red Robbin's.  The had some awesome and honkin huge hamburgers there.  They were great.  Then our dad bought us some cubs jerseys.  I got a blue Wood jersey; I would have liked white with blue stripes, but no one had it.  Anyways, I couldn't find anything for Stephanie in any of the stores I went through (including the gift store at the hotel).  Eventually I saw something that I thought I was going to get her, but I decided I liked it a lot more than she would.  It was a Cubs electric guitar pin.  It's awesome, but I didn't think she'd like it too much; so I decided it'd be better staying with me.  After we got done shopping (we couldn't even go through the whole stinkin thing in like 6 hrs) we went back to the hotel to watch a movie.  That's right we saw Elf.  It was pretty funny, pretty clean, and pretty goofy at times.  After that I went to bed (c'mon now, I need my beauty sleep; a loooot of it).  The next day (Sunday) we pretty much packed up and left.  On the way home I figured out something that should have given me better quality pictures on my camera so I tried to take a couple of pictures of the Krazy Kaplan's Fireworks billboards.  I actually had the privilegde of seeing the actual Krazy Kaplan's store.  I felt so blessed and honored (you'd have to see the bilboard to get the joke).  Then I got back and found that Colleen was mad at me.  I have no clue why, but she was.  My first stop was my computer so I could post for all of you guys.  It took me straight until Tuesday morning to get all of this posted.  I sill think Colleen is mad at me, but I know Steph isn't.  I think I was able to work out my problem within myself, but that will remain to be seen until another day.  Anyways, sorry for making ya'll read all of this.  Peace out ya'll.

       Sometimes I just don't know whether there are really problems or not.  I think both Colleen and Stephanie are both mad at me on the same day.  How in the world does that happen?  I think honesty may have something to do with it.  Honesty about self, honesty about feelings, honesty about others— I think they all hurt when the people don't like the truth behind the words.  I read Stephanie's blog today about commitment.  I know I'm committed to my friends, but am I really helping them by letting them believe lies?  What's worse is that when I tell them the truth, it hurts them and me.  I wish I didn't have to have these tough possitions.  In my devotions today I chose to start reading in Glatians.  No apparent reason, just though I should read there.  I also decided to read a Proverb a day seing as how it's June 1st.  In Galatians the basic theme of the first chapter stuck out with me.  I can sum it up in two verses: verse 1 and verse 24. (I'm quoting from the King James)  "Paul an apostle, not of men, neither by man;, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead."  "And they glorified God in me."  Wow, Paul works for God and people glorified God in him?  What a concept.  I'm sure he was probably presented with some personal praise, but he put it towards God's glory.  The verse in Proverbs that stuck with me was verse 8: "My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not."  So simple a command, but how hard is it to follow?  I find myself falling into peer pressure all the time.  Somehow I have to pray that God will strengthen me so that when those temptations come along, I can be strong and resist those carnal desires.  Just some thoughts for some of you.  Once again, I am in debt to JDR for his incredible skills of a webdesigner.  Thanks for the cool comment thingy and thanks in advance for the address book thing (however that works).

       Well, for todays episode of the Lifestyles of the poor and relatively unknown, we look at Joshua Guynn.&nbsp; Anyways, cameras and light aside, (jk I'm just a goofy kid; don't mind me) I woke up early, although I don't know what for.&nbsp; I worked a little bit, but it wasn't anything I needed less sleep over.&nbsp; In any case I was given a few chores to do and baisically all day in which to do them.&nbsp; Being the initiative taking person that I am, I ate and then started cleaning my room (which had absolutely nothing to do with the chores I was given).&nbsp; Apparently my mom was going somewhere so after she left I burnt myself a cd that I could listen to while I work (good good stuff by the way) and then started to do the chores I was given.&nbsp; They only took a second, but then I had something else I needed to do.&nbsp; This something would earn me money thusly not making me quite so poor.&nbsp; I went over to my neighbors house and cut down her ferns.&nbsp; Thanks to that, I got 10 bucks, well 9 if I subtract the tithe that I pay which means I'm still a loooooong ways away from the $70 that I need by the first soccer practice.&nbsp; Anyways, after that I took a shower.&nbsp; Unbeknownced to me (I don't know if I spelled that right) I had mystery plans bubbling about this time.&nbsp; Well, after my shower I went over to my grandma's house because that's the place to be.&nbsp; I played some games with JDR before he had to go.&nbsp; Right as he was leaving, Seth came.&nbsp; We played until he had to leave, then I left because of these mystery plans.&nbsp; Well, the mystery involved an ex-teacher at our school.&nbsp; We (My mom and my two sisters) went to a park in Zionsville with them (Mrs. Borgman, and her three "delightful" children).&nbsp; In all actuality it was not anywhere near what I thought it was going to be like.&nbsp; I actually enjoyed my self quite a bit.&nbsp; Her oldest son is going into 7th grade and the other two are in 5th (Danielle) and 3rd (Whitney).&nbsp; Well I skated for a little bit with Brittany, Whitney, and Danielle then we went to play tennis.&nbsp; I found out I can't play well at all because you can't just hit the ball really hard.&nbsp; You have to have some kinda skills that I don't have, but I made it fun for me at least anyway.&nbsp; After our tennis match, we all went to the baseball diamond and played some "base ball" with tennis balls.&nbsp; The rules were different in this game so I use the term baseball kinda loosely.&nbsp; In any case Whitney didn't want to play outfield.&nbsp; She only wanted to be a batter so Danielle wouldn't let her.&nbsp; She threw a hissy fit and tattled on her brother who shifted the blame to it's true target.&nbsp; Well, Mrs. B. brought things to a close when she told us (all the kids) to let Whitney play.&nbsp; So, we let her play and that was that.&nbsp; She still never played outfield though.&nbsp; Anyway that was my night.&nbsp; Much to my enjoyment I took a nice hot bath after that.&nbsp; Ooooooooooooooh it felt soooooooo good.&nbsp; That's about it.&nbsp; Cept that CD really is kickin, y'know.&nbsp; I may put that together as a sellable cd and call it...... Shroom Studios Obscure Hits vol.1&nbsp; How does that sound?&nbsp; Let me know.&nbsp; Anyways, this is me signing out.   D.J. Josh Rocks the house!!!   I took a quiz and I don't think it's entirely accureate, but below are the results.&nbsp; You're welcome to try it if you'd like.&nbsp; And the only reason I posted it on my blog is because it said Lord of the Rings.&nbsp; Ok, I'm really going to stop talking this time.&nbsp; Adios.    Lord of the Rings!     urlLink  What movie Do you Belong in?(many different outcomes!)    brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       What's up you guys.&nbsp; Sorry it's been so long since I've updated.&nbsp; I didn't think anybody read or cared anymore about my blog, but I suppose I'm back by "poplular" (and I use the term very loosely) demand (again, a very loosely used word).&nbsp; Let's see..... I got a hair cut and I went to Chicago&nbsp; I enjoyed Chicago a lot again.&nbsp; We didn't do very much this time.&nbsp; I did run 7 miles though.&nbsp; I don't know what's wrong with me.&nbsp; I had to stop after 4 for a one minute breather ;P.&nbsp; I've been doing a lot of working.&nbsp; I'll skip a lot of stuff just because I can't remember what I've been up to (although I have been going to Bre's quite a bit).&nbsp; If you will, please notice the link to my rite side that says "Through Bre's Blue&nbsp;Eyes."&nbsp; That's a link to her new blog.&nbsp; If you get the chance check it out.&nbsp; In any case, the only interesting thing I have to talk about is that new show Ahmish in the city.&nbsp; It was pretty cool, I think.&nbsp; Ahmish people apparently have a period of time at the end of their teen years when they are allowed to go into public to see whether they want to continue in their menonite ways or stay in society.&nbsp; Anyway, this show is about 5 Ahmish living in this big house with 6 city people and they do different things each day and they cook and swim and talk and hang out.&nbsp; I like it.&nbsp; In any case I watched it with my cousins tonight so it was pretty good.&nbsp; Anyways, it's gettin late to I'll talk to you guys later.  The virtually absent and thought to be the late, Joshua Robert Guynn A.K.A.&nbsp; Sneaky Dan

       Ok, here's the deal.  I've got to make this kinda quick because I'm about to call Thanh, but my day was pretty bad.  I had two customers cuss at me today.  On top of that, I'm sick and I had to blow my nose every 5-10 minutes.  It was kinda hot, and I wasn't prepared to get back into the swing of work after an entire week of camp.  I've got some kind of sinus deal goin on so I've kinda got a head-ache, but I've started working on a new Music CD for my cousin.  I have the option to go to work tomorrow or go swimming with Bre and go to a movie with Billy (neither one is set in stone because Bre may not be able to go and I haven't nailed anything down with Billy yet).  The only certain thing about tomorrow is that it will be upon the world (not necessarily including God's people) in almost 6 1/2 hours.  I'm so headachy right now, I don't know what I'm gonna do to get rid of this sickness.  At any rate, I've got to go.  Peace out my peeps.  And all the party people from the front to the back said this is that guy signing out.  Josh G-izzle :P

       What's up you guys?  Sorry for neglecting to post for so long.  I've been at camp all week and I didn't get the chance to post right before I left.  I finally got things straigtened out with Steph for good (hopefully).  We now have it arranged where we're nothing more than good friends so there shouldn't be any more arguments.  How bout I tell you guys a little about camp.  I had a great time.  I met quite a few new people (many were girls).  I had a great time getting to know this one girl imparticular.  Her name is Thanh (pronounced ton with the 'O' as in song).  She's a friend of my sister's best friend, if that makes any sense.  Her family comes from Vietnam.  She is very pretty and very nice.  I don't mean to sound like I'm one of those people who likes someone new each week, but I do really like her and I think it will work out.  On top of that, she speaks perfect English, I have a good potential to see her quite a bit, and she kinda likes me too.  God really spoke to me in the messages preached at the camp.  Mainly in my closeness to him.  I don't think any of you knew this, but I hadn't been doing my devotions for quite a while.  Needless to say I wasn't close to God at all.  To use a meaphor, I was almost like a hired hand; someone used to do God's work at the price of an eternity in heaven.  What's the point in that?  God saved our lives from hell and all he wants is fellowship.  The part that I got wrong is that God would prefer fellowship over service.  For the first time I feel like I'm really a close friend of God's.  I cheered a lot while I was up there because I was on the red team.  We have to cheer frantically for our teams because we're on them and we want them to win (really confusing I know).  Because of that I lost my voice.  Unfortunately the weather was kinda cold about the time I lost my voice so I think I cought some kinda croopy cough thing.  Yuck-o.  In my cabin was some kid who only took one shower the entire week because some other kid made him take one.  He threatened that if the guy didn't take a shower he would physically force him (that's grosser than my croopy cough!).  Before I knew he didn't shower, he asked if he could borrow a long sleeved shirt because it was cold and he didn't have a longsleved shirt.  Well, after he wore it the whole day, the whole night, the whole next day and after he took a shower the whole next night, I let him keep it.  On the bus ride home I started talking with this girl I'd seen before, but always thought she was mean because she was never really nice to me.  So, we're pretty good friends, I just haven't talked to her since the bus ride.  I'm hoping I got her e-mail adress correct.  Her name is Phylicia.  Well, that's about all I can remember for right now, but I'm sure I'll remember some stuff later.  But as for now, this is Joshua Guynn signing off.  The dude returning from camp, JG gear

       Man I'm feeling really weird.  Today/last night was a weird weird (little over) 24 hrs.  I had a convo last night that got me thinking which is never a very good thing for me while it's happening.  Hopefully I'll end up with the right answers and no questions remaining.  Ugh, I thought all the rough who I am and what I want struggles were over.  Now I find I have some over-the-summer "homework" so I can answer some more problems.  Well actually it's not too much of a problem, but I'm just kind of thinking about it so it consumes my time y'know.  At any rate I suppose I still have much to learn to be a knowlegable sensei.  That's how my weirdness started.  It continued on when I was woken up at 6:00 to get the stinkin trash out.  Gahrrrrr.  After that trash I went right to bed, but was then woken up seconds later asking what time I set my alarm for.  Apparently I needed to set my alarm for 9:30 to be into work at 11:00 instead of 10:00 like I had previously planned.  So I reset my alarm and went back to sleep.  My alarm "pleasantly" woke me up at 9:30.  I sat in bed for a few minutes trying to fathom what was going on when I recieved a call.  I didn't know who it was while I was still in bed, but when I heard the voice on the answering machine it sounded like Asim.  Because of that I rolled out of bed to check the answering machine.  Gahrrrr.  It was none other than Mr. Yeiter.  I called him back after he sent a letter out to the class but never made contact.  Anyways we talked after I called him back yet again and then I began getting ready for work.  I ironed a shirt, ate, brushed my teeth washed my face and forgot to shave.  GAAAAAHHHHRRRRRRR.  Fortunately for me nobody noticed.  I guessed my wiskers just weren't enough for anybody to see.  How humiliating, yet at the same time kinda good.  Well, my dad took me to work and I feel kinda weird riding with him because we really don't say all that much.  I guess we just don't really have anything in common besides blood and being of the same gender.  So after he dropped me off, I went to my mom to have her clock me in.  After I get clocked in I found out that everything in the place was off kilter.  The third register was baisically non-existent, I didn't know many people that were working today, the busiest part of the day wasn't busy at all, and weirdest of all I felt like I was going so slow, but my register time was the fastest I'd ever seen in my life... 31 seconds at the end of the day.  Gahr?  Anyways before I left for home, I had to mop the floor and found out we had another mop bucket (not the one in the closet.)  Also during the day I had some goofy customer I felt like I recongized.  He came in and asked for two cups of water and babbled something about water being essential on a day like today.  Idk it was kinda weird.  (You know I love you JDR, man :P)  Ok after that weird day at work I came home and played some video games and did some work on my computer.  Then we watched Ahmish in the City (still a great great show though I can't vouch for the language anymore and may have to duck out of the sexual content here in a couple weeks).  After that I studied a mess in my drivers manual.  I had been studying 1/2 hr. every night for two nights and now I'm studying some more for tomorrow because I'm going to take my test.  Now for me studying two nights in a row and then studying even more for a third night is crazy for a test.  I never do that on tests at school, but somehow my mom is still on me about studying even more for this test.  In any case, I'm still gonna study some more after I'm done with this post, but I can pretty much quote everything I'm going over as I'm going over it so I don't see much point in it.  Something else that happened today was Bre's computer is messing up with it's internet.  Luckly for somebody (prolly all parties involved and some that aren't), Mrs. Prosch knew what the problem was and I had the easy solution.  The only problem is I had to lend one of my disks without me being there.  I don't have the files on that disk backed up which really goes against what I know I should do.  I'm going to hope that this doesn't bite me in the butt.  Anyways, that's all the weird things that have happened today.  BTW, I'm still in a quandry.  I guess you could say it's girl trouble even though I don't have a girl to have trouble with.  The problem is I kinda like the girl, but I don't know if/how/when I should tell her anything about it.  I suppose if I took my own advice, it wouldn't matter if I do or not because this may or may not effect the rest of my life because God has the ultimate plan for my life and I'll get there through Him, but I value the girl to much to get her involved if she needn't be.  I hate being single, but I don't want to hurt someone because of what I want so I'm going to have to see how I really feel and if it's really practical so the girl won't get hurt in the process.  Anyways, holla lata to all the party peoples.  The man who's lost in thought, Joshua R. Guynn  ex-philosopher

       Oh my goodness, I've been so busy I just don't know what to do.  Yesterday I went to Holiday world and that was fun but I got home too late to keep my eyes open any longer.  The night before I only got 4 hrs or sleep so I was shot.  I had a great time but it wasn't much of an amusement park.  It's more of just a water park; although the unlimited softdrinks is a major plus.  I found a new drink that I think is awesome:  3 parts root beer and one part mountain dew.  It's really good.  It's like some kinda erbal tangy root beerish drink.  Ok, now onto today...  Baisically today I went to set up a bank account with my mom.  This time I did have my permit so I was all set up.  After that, we went to some other places to pick up some stuff.  Once we got back from that, I fell back asleep for a few hours.  My mom woke me back up to eat dinner and then I got on my cpu.  I played literati with this lady I met before yesterday.  It's so awesome because she's a Christian lady and she's really nice.  The killer is that her name is Sheri and that's all I have to go by.  Because of this I get her mixed up with Mrs. Prosch (Bre's mom's name is Sherrie), not that I call Mrs. Prosch by her first name, but she's the first Sherrie I've known is her so that's what comes to my mind first.  At any rate after that I saw Oceans 11.  Oh my goodness that movie is awesome.  It's about these 11 people, led by Daniel Ocean, who rob a safe in a casino.  You'll have so see how smooth the operation is.  I'd encourage anyone to watch it.  I also saw Desperado and the Mask of Zorro.  Both of those were really good so watch any three of those if you get the chance.  There is one awkward scene in both Zorro and Desperado so be forewarned.  We fastforwarded past two parts in Ocean's 11, but I don't think they were bad scenes; I wouldn't know because I didn't get to see them.  They were really quick though so I don't really know.  In any case, I'm supposed to be in bed now so I'll holla at you guys lata.  The guy who now knows how to rob a safe in Vegas, Joshua R. Guynn (you don't know me if they're looking for me ok?)
