      Some things are just worth waiting for. You can't put your finger on why exactly, but you know they are. They are just like ice cream. You have this intense craving for ice cream, and no matter what else you get, if it isnt the ice cream you feel slightly empty. lol. i am not the most patient person but when i find something or someone i want i go after it, and if i have to wait I do. NO matter how much it kills me. the best things in life are worth waiting for:)

      My philosophy is that we each have little aliens that control our speech, our actions, and what our bodies do. Why??? Because with most, it seems that very few of us have control over those things ourselves. We usually say the wrong things, do the wrong things, and our bodies are just lumps that do what they want. it is soooo frustrating isn't it? Wouldn't it be great if we all were able to speak our minds, yet do it in a way that wouldnt hurt others, and everyone would understand us. perfect communication.

      Ever notice how a smell can dredge up some of the craziest or strangest of memories? I have read before that odour memory falls off less rapidly than any other sensory memory such as taste, or touch. perfume companies make millions a year because of our sense of smell. I know I am not the only one that will pass by someone in a store, and have them remind me of an ex because of the same cologne being used. or the smell of someones hair on a pillow. As weird as this is, the smell of morning breath, sometimes not being entirely pleasant, however, there is something comfortable in someones morning breath,someone you love. Turning over in the morning, feeling that warmth against your cheek, and inhaling that musky deep scent as it dances on your face. Everyone has their own scent.  enough of that. In these futile days of hopeless attitudes, beaten dreams, and greedy hearts, in these days when no one asks why and just goes with whatever, in order to save time or save effort, I feel lost. I feel misplaced. Why? Because I refuse to believe this is as good as it is going to get. That this is as good as i will get, or my life as a whole, or this world as a whole. I refuse to believe that my actions or presense here has no effect on anything or anyone around me because I am not everything I had once thought I would be. There is a darkness around us now. A haze that has trapped us in this pudding like pool of hopelessness and defeat. People settle for the easiest choices. Once more I will state this...EASY IS NOT ALWAYS BETTER!!!!! So what if I am the living definition of overly sensitive and emotional. I feel things others don't seem to. I see that person sitting at their desk, thinking no one notices the downcast eyebrows, or the worry running rampant in their eyes. I feel their grief, their anxiety, their troubled hearts. Maybe it is just me thinking of how I feel when I look like that, I have the worst poker face in the world. Yet I feel in tune with every emotion everyone feels. I feel that sadness, i feel sad when i feel that persons hatred or anger. I feel when someone is in love, and I even get jealous of that. I wish sometimes I had a shield I could put up so that those emotions didnt swarm to me and fill me with everyone elses troubles. But that is who I am.  Because of that I am able to be there for others, to be able to be honestly caring and empathetic to everyones needs. Next time you are around someone take the moment to really look at them. really look at someone next time you do something for them or say something to them. remember that they are a person and have their own thoughts and feelings, and you have an impact, even if it is small, on their day. and it spirals from there. Do you want to impact the world in a good or bad way? it all starts with what you do or say to that one person.  Some think I am too nice, and yes, maybe in the world we live in now, i would be considered too polite and nice, but hey, I believe that I was put here to stand for the truth and give the love that is in me, that feels so often as though it will swallow me whole because I cant get it out enough.I feel that somehow this crazy disease i have of loving too much and feeling too much will bring light through this darkness around us now and enlighten the path for many people to that place where hope is found. next subject isnt it odd how some of the smartest people are idiots. a person could have graduated top of their class from harvard, yet be the biggest idiot you will ever meet because of their actions toward others.  random thought time:) too many realizations today about how i have treated things and allowed myself to get caught up with things that were obvious to everyone but me that they were not what I had planned them to be and that I was the only one still caught up in it all. too long a story to get into, but some words of advice. sometimes you have to bite the bullet and let go. figure out if it is the fantasy you are holding on to or something real that can and will happen. I can honestly say there is only one person in this world that I think I have not brought good into their lives. I feel that I have brought something good to others and made their lives somewhat better, only one person does it seem like that wasnt affected positively, or at least wont admit to it, and I think that is why it has been so hard for me to be ok with how things are between us. it is not the best feeling knowing that someone seems more unhappy because you were in their life. I dont know why or what it was. see, i am the kind of person that is the same with everyone. sometimes some people will act differently with others, I am the same me with everyone, silly, sweet, fun, honest, totally me. and i think that bothers some people, bothers them because they cant be that way. some people are like bad chocolate cake. you first taste the sweet icing, wonderful, tasty, but you get to the inside after savoring the frosting and you find it to be dry, crumbly, and sour, and you try to eat bites of it with frosting, yet the sourness still surfaces and makes you gag.  some people are different. some have less than yummy icing but after that they have sweet, moist cake inside that makes you forget that the icing was dry and flaky. blah blah blah right:) enough for now. a war is going on inside me. ever have that inside voice scream to you "what are you doing" "why are you doing this" "this isnt how it has to be" well...mine does it more than ever lately.

       The various synaptic misfires that exit through my mouth will either amuse, annoy, or confuse those who are around me. Watching as the confused expressions creep onto my listeners face, then followed by a crawling grin, always tells me that my audience has once more found that conversation with me can be unpredictable. the only thing predicatable about it is that will be unpredicatable. But I have fun:) And usually others do to unless they are tight asses who only think of themselves and want to hear themselves instead of the knowledge I have inside myself, anyways... What are all you doing this friday nite?  many of you will be creating amoebas and rolling down to the clubs. Some will venture out on dates with people you barely know, while others will go for a nice night with their beloved. what am I doing? I had various options, going with friends, going on different dates with pathetic men who think I can be the one, taking myself out, or staying home to catch up on sleep. What was my final answer? Haven't made one yet. lol. Yep, at 7pm on Friday night I am still contemplating what I will do tonite, am I indecisive? No, just waiting for the right thing to spark up and make me say, yes, that is what I want to do. Driving home I glanced over, thought I saw a friend, waved, and my kind gesture was returned with the finger. Wtf is our world coming to.  The streets are packed in with people who have forgotten the effect of a smile or a kind word. How disappointing it has become.  Thank god for people like me:)

      A little girl holds on to fantasies of magic, and happily ever after fairytale nonsense. See. It was that little girl that thought she had won a trophy, for the first time ever. As though in this competition of life, that she has worked so hard at, she thought she had finally won. All the practice and pain, all the sacrifice, she was finally rewarded for it.    A great, perfect, shiny trophy, everything she had ever wanted, she loved it too, it was better than all the other trophies she had seen in her life, she knew instantly she deserved it and it was made just for her. Once she saw it she knew instantly that it was right for her, as though they were made for each other. And it was all so wonderful... until the judges retallied their numbers and found out she wasn't the winner after all. So that trophy, the trophy she had already saw in her head where she would put, and that trophy she had made plans already to take care of and make sure it never broke, that trophy was taken away from her. Ripping through her heart.   And that little girl broke down and knew the deep feeling of distraught and utter sadness. Her fantasy of magic feelings and the thrill of finally reaping what she sowed was distroyed and she found out she was not getting her happily ever after.  But instead she would have to compete even longer, not knowing if that next trophy would be as good and feel as right and perfect. That little girl in me is what gets me in trouble. Yes, she adds some spice to my life, but she always seems to cause more hurt than is needed. Some find my ability to have the honesty of a child, and the hope of a child a good thing. Some find my inner child silly and retarded.   I don't know what to think of her. She is there for me to remind me to not take things so seriously, to loosen up. She is there for me when I need to relax by going to the park, or by watching cartoon. She is there when I try to cheer others up and have fun. Yet she has this incessant need. A need to have everything and everyone just happy and great. A need to find everything small so wonderful and be so happy with things others think is silly and a no need to get excited over. Which is annoying at time. Does anyone understand? Know what I mean? I do not see that little girl when i look in myself sometimse. I do see her markings, the trail of hope, of naiveness.  Such high expectations she has instilled in me. Odd how I choose to be more childlike now, when I was less childlike when i was a child. Anyhow. Single once more. Odd. This time feels different. More concrete in a way. more settled. It has a sad faze around it, like thick fog in the early hours of morning. you can make your way through, yet you must go slow and try not to get lost it in. Where to now? I sit listening to the radio, some song I have heard a million times before, yet my lame brain does not recall the title or artist. It has a slow sad feeling to it, deepening my feeling of loss. Loss of what? Loss of the fantasy of everything finally being ok.    Although...you don't "need" someone in your life to be ok. They can help, help a lot. yet you need to find happiness in your own back yard before you try to find it anywhere else.  a little girl is sitting all alone on the tire swing. just swaying back and forth. Tear stained cheeks red from sobbing. The little girl was beat this time. Was shown that life doesn't always work the way you thought and planned for it to. You can sit on that swing a while, burried in tears and pity,But you still need to pick yourself up at the end and get back on the bike of life. LIfe is full of disappointments, don't let yourself bury yourself in them.

      The phone was ringing on the other end, I asked my supervisor "whats the guys name'? (we needed the programmer to come fix our server) He replies, "John springer or John springerdorph , dorpher... One of those". (he knew..he had been working there for years with the guy) I start laughing, commenting on how was I suppose to ask for the guy; the phone is still ringing. My supervisor is cracking up. I ponder to myself if he is being serious or setting me up to be embarressed. The phone is still ringing. I start laughing hard watching this little guy rolling from some inside joke he is going through, I say "come on paul, what is the guys name, it isnt springerdorph, that doesnt sound right' he laughs even harder and gets the other two pc people in the room rolling, harder as i repeat the question again. Springerdorph, something was funny about the name, i just didnt know what, but it had us rolling. I felt set up. A guy answers the phone, "This is Don" Inside i wonder if Paul gave me the wrong number, I giggle, pull myself togther and timidly ask "um..is john springerdolaj*&^ej there?" I muffle the last name hoping the guys mind on the other end hears Jons last name right. He answers "uhh...hold on" i hold my hand over the receiver and glare at paul while i stifle a laugh, of course he is purple by now from laughing, i am becoming teary eyed from holding my giggles in. I ask one more time, "come on Paul, what is his last name" Paul just laughs harder. I wonder....what am I getting into. A man's voice is on the phone..."This is Jack" I bust up, muffle the receiver, and say, "cough cough, hold on a sec" i hold the phone to my chest as i violently laugh and try not be too loud, all the while the other three people in the room are rolling, i am trying to tell them what just happened. After a few moments they compose themselves after me scoling them and begging them to stop so i can stop laughing, I finally talk on the phone, "um, john?" he says yes and we proceed with our conversation, me apologizing of course for the wait. As soon as i hang up we all start laughing again as I tell them about him calling himself Jack.   You just had to be there.   anyhow, the next day this guy comes in, and boy is he short, that is when i realize what the dorph was, it wasnt dorph, but dwarf. I turn red, and start giggling, and this guy cracked up when I told him....he asked what was going on with me laughing and the whole thing came out, talk about embarressed, but he took it well and laughed it off, apparently him and Paul are good friends.  not so funny now....but as i said; you had to be there.

      Someone's got a case of the Mondays!!! Good movie. True for today.  Isn't it odd how Monday will either be really good or really bad. I haven't found one yet that rested in the gray area, of course sometimes I don't think about it, so it is possible I have just overlooked that lighter than black Monday. Anyhow. I use to have a diaryland page...but I have outgrown that, plus I have enjoyed some of the blogs I have read through this site and wanted the chance to comment on them. I am not your usual chik. Yes, I have my girly ways and emotions, yet I feel I see things slightly differently, act slightly differently, and live slightly differently. I look forward to reading your comments on how distracted I get in my entries here and switch from subject to subject. I am amused by shiny objects, and boobies :) This gum is falling apart in my mouth so time to get some more, don't ya hate that when it happens. From a girls perspective, this site rocks. very kewl. Come often to see what new strange things my mind will spew out. Even I get surprised:)

      It's a fine line between love and hate. Literally. The ability to love someone so unconditionally can go away in a snap and turn into hate.&nbsp; Hate is a powerful word, sometimes people don't even use it, but their actions and hurtful words make it more clear than the words "I hate you" can ever do.   The human mind is so complex and has to continually fight with the human heart for control. Control over life, over decisions, and feelings. your mind will tell you what you need, your heart screams what it wants. constant battle.   what i need and want are the same things, to be loved again, adored, appreciated, and respected.&nbsp; I miss that so much sometimes that it hurts so bad.  everyone wants that and needs it right?  but that is life right?? you win some, and you lose some.   is it possible for&nbsp; a heart to feel like it is breaking forever? If so please just rip mine out now. It is no use to me anymore.

      In the beginning &nbsp;you had   men   and   women  . Who knows who came first.&nbsp;  Not too long ago we lived in a society where men had the say so for everything. Women were expected to be the weaker sex so they took their roles, did whatever they were told to, didn't mouth off, were completely submissive.&nbsp; They acted as though they did not have minds of their own. In this day and age, thankfully, we are past most of that.    Some  men still expect women to be like that, or partially like that. Because women have minds of their own and choose to voice them they are considered bitches. If women choose to keep it in they are considered weak and submissive. Where are we to win? Men seem to have a problem with women being right, therefore they take our candidness and opinions badly.  I am strong minded, so therefore you will get my whole honest opinion on matters, whether or not I feel you will agree.   This is a&nbsp; GOOD  &nbsp;trait.   I will not veer my opinions to hurt others, yet if they do I apologize and try to reword things so therefore no one gets hurt, my opinions are not geared to be destructive, just to enlighten some, inform others, and just to make chatty conversation.   &nbsp; &nbsp; errr!&nbsp; I hate how things just cant go easy all the time when they should, and can, yet someone wont let them, they have to make things more complicated then they need to be  :( &nbsp;       Control   -To adjust to a requirement; regulate. What is control??? There is the definition, but what is it in life.&nbsp;   Control is when you are able to manage your words and actions to ensure that they will not get to the point that you will have to be ashamed of them, hurt others, or have you act in a way you do&nbsp;not like, and would not like someone else to do or say to you.   Control is being able to suppress words and behaviors you know you should not say or do because it would be going too far.&nbsp; Some people have control, some&nbsp; have a little, and some have none.   You can practice control, work on it.&nbsp; Admitting you have none does not mean you are admitting you are weak or stupid, but simply that you need to work on it because you know it is not healthy.   Sometimes not having control can be good, such as in good instances like surprises and welcomed events. &nbsp;   Sometimes control is bad such as when someone has control over someone else, insists on&nbsp;telling them what&nbsp;to do&nbsp;or think.&nbsp;   Some people react so badly when they feel they have no control.&nbsp; Such as if someone has no control over a feeling, say, being totally in love with someone and have things going wonderfully with them. They feel swept up in the goodness, overwhelming. so feeling no control they do what they know they can in order to get control, mess it up. doing something to hurt and put a break in all the goodness. Then they feel they have control. it is not good but it is control. this puts a spin on it all.&nbsp; This is   BAD   control.   Sad how some people have to make things bad in order to feel they have control over the situation. They might have a great relationship with a girl that is wonderful to them, but if they don’t feel they can control anything, even if it is all good, then they pull out the stupid plug in order to feel they are in control of the situation, whether with hurtful words or actions.&nbsp; This is the only way they can feel normal, it is very sad.   Thankfully I am past that. I use to be that way, if things felt too great, I would find a reason for them to go bad. but I have come to realize things are ok being good, however now it is others finding reasons to make my good things bad. this probably didn’t make much sense, but fark you all, lol, this is my blog and it makes sense to me:) &nbsp;  &nbsp;anyways... life is too short for all this bullshit we go through day to day.&nbsp; If only people could live life in a way that they will be proud of later on.&nbsp; Proud to have their kids see them do it, proud to say they lived a good life as a good person.   God I love how it smells after a rain. So clean. Like the rain just washes&nbsp; away all the bad and gives you a fresh slate.   anyone catch the new Stargate last night? not me:( wish i had, but had issues with a certain hard headed man who I am hopelessly in love with.   Don't let anyone stand in the way of your dreams, no matter what their opinions of them are, they are your dreams, all you have. If they are what you truly want don’t ever stop working to achieve them.   Till the end of time you will have women who have their own opinions, be glad in this, without their opinions they are nothing more than warm blooded robots.&nbsp; Without women men would be nothing. Without men women would be nothing. Face it, we all need each other. Men have special things they add to womens lives, and women add special things to men's lives. It is a beautiful give and take relationship we all could be having with that special someone. Relish this and let it all happen. Appreciate what you have. adios amigos  till next time...

      I admit I sometimes come out with strange thoughts, feelings, ideas. But hey, that is the magic of life. never knowing what to expect right. One thing however that people should not take lightly is my feelings concerning them or my beliefs. I have one of the biggest hearts I know, therefore, i feel things very very strongly. If I say you are wonderful, believe me, i know, i have met a ton of less than wonderful people in my life. If I say you can do something, by god, give it a try, you probably can:) just a note to say, i know what i am talking about, dont take me lightly.  on to other news, weekend went well, different, unexpected occurences, but overall well, in the big aspect of it all.  I am persistant aren't I? for those who dont know me you dont get to see the side of me who hangs on till my knuckles bleed. I hate giving up, on anything, I always feel like there is a reason to continue, a good reason to believe that things will work out, and something worth hanging on to. I will be honest with myself if there isnt, and i will let go graciously, but I am stubborn, if it is something i am really into and believe in then you wont be able to let me let go of it until you spell it out and conk me on the head that i need to let go, that it is just a tornado ready to take off.  what the heck about those huge silver fish out this summer, scary or what? where do they come from? do they need that many legs?  when will society come to realize that life doesnt have to be this hard, we make it this way, we should all go with the flow and let things happen and not be afraid to try, afraid to be happy, or succeeding, and not be afraid of succumbing to emotions, or happiness. fear is the worst evil. anyhow take care all

      Ever notice that no matter how hard you try at something it never seems like it is good enough, and if you try to back off to reevaluate the situation you are accused of having an attititude or giving up. It is so damn frustrating!!!!  I finally feel like i gain control over how my mind and heart interact and then something comes along and makes it all confused again.  got hair done again today, not too shabby if I may so say myself:)  in the way of how men and women interract i am starting to believe nothing makes sense. People sometimes expect so much out of you that they seem to be blindsighted by the things you already produce that is there for them, but that is not enough.  Am I such a terrible person? I give so much of myself that sometimes I do not leave enough for myself, yet this is still not enough. Where does it all go right?  amazing how love for someone keeps you trucking on through the muck. I love too deeply. I am sorry for all those i have disappointed by not being able to be there for you or be what you need. Please do try to understand I am trying and that I am just one person able to handle so much before i crack open. I am oversensitive, emotional, yet I am positive and a driving force of motivation for most people around me, those who choose to either use it for good, or use it as a reason to hate me.  You pick.

      isnt it odd how it isnt until you are single again that you notice when people flirt with you more. Somehow being in love and in a relationship you walk around in this fog and dont notice things like that much.  some people say that no one is interested in them until they are taken, however i dont see how that is, the moment someone leaks out that you are no longer attached it seems like all those fools who liked you while you were taken seem to think they might have a chance now, it is crazy. Odd also how when you lose a little weight how quickly those guys you thought were cute seem to notice you more. lol makes sense I guess, seems like they notice your weight loss before you do. actually have been feeling more alive lately, I have been getting out and getting some exercise, reading more and just feeling overall more healthy. it is so nice. well, i go next week to get my hair highlighted again. looking forward to it, my hair is getting pretty long finally, I have been waiting a while for it to get like this. i had never realized how many nice apartments for perty good prices there are in lexington, i look forward to finally settling on one to move into. anyhow... enough about that. been spending a bunch of time outside lately, i forgot how much i loved being outside, mainly at night, but still outside. the fresh air does something to you I guess. enough ramblin for now take care all

      Ever experience that moment in life where the truth comes crashing into you and plumets into your head and you are made to see that you are not perfect after all and "oh sh*%, this is all my fault."  sucks doesn't it??? humbles a person.  You give others so much grief when the whole time you were the one causing all the problems with your pushyness and your persistance.  It has been almost all my fault. I don't know when to back off and let others lead their lives the way they need to. I somehow feel I know what is best for someone and have to help, when sometimes backing off yet still being there helps more than anything.  You live your life in a way that you are proud of, that you feel you will have no regrets, that you are a good person, but then you wake up and realize you have been selfish. That just because some things in your life are going ok and you want to get things all in line, doesnt mean someone else should be forced to follow your lead. Everyone works at their own pace, expecting others to run in time with you is selfish, demanding. eventually it is ok, but if that person already has a circus of issues plaguing their everyday lives, the last thing they need is declarations from you and insistance for them to put you first in the line up of things they need to figure out.  I am that selfish blind person.  what was that?? the world doesn't revolve around me?? Maybe someone should of told me this long ago:) I am still a good person, my heart is in the right place, i just lack the patience and control sometimes to truly see situations from others views and truly listen to them, for this I am cursed to suffer a life of heartache, caused by myself.  Friendship, above anything, with a person is one of lifes most treasured pleasures, and should come before a relationship, if you can't have a simple friendship work right, why force more?? work on that first and you will move mountains.   I have figured out that smoothing over isnt so bad after all, it says more if you really listen instead of just being frustrated.  I have some pretty incredible friends for sticking by me through all my tantrums and hardheadedness.  boyfriends/ girlfriends may come and go, but true friends last a lifetime.
