      Well let me see what has been going on….um…yesterday we did a bunchof bead business crap, made some mullah, and ordered more merch.  It was Erik’s birthday so we spent the evening in Cedar Rapids at, of course you know where, the infamous ‘Chuck E Cheese’.  Blah.  But the girls and I skipped the end of the party and went to the mall for a little shopping.  I need a new messenger bag, but I just can’t find one.  There was a really soft ‘Ruff Hewn’ one, army green and everything, but it just wasn’t ‘essence’ as we would say.  Bah.  Plus I am trying to save money.  What for?  I am not sure.  Possibly one of the following.  (In order of least costly)  contacts, a laptop, a car.  Anywho.  Eeeek.  Mom was a grouch this morning, and Laura was a pain in the neck, screaming and what not.  I don’t know if I will ever understand that girl.  She just knows how to get Mom riled up, and she doesn’t know when to quit.  Eh.  So Emily and I tried to keep things running as smooth as possible, and that’s none too smooth.  Ah well.  I wrapped about fifty birthday gifts (we are doing Sophia’s and Erik’s birthday tonight, cake and gifts and what not.).  Oh, and I sliced my finger open (cutting an orange for my lunch, yeah I'm smooth) .  Then I went swimming, and the chlorine burned it.  Fun.  Oh, and I got all my finances in order, bank deposits, and checks for dad to invest.  My checkbook is balanced.  Sweet action.    Tiff called and told me there’s a drama meeting tomorrow night in the coffee shop, but I can’t make it.  *cough*  I have other things going on.  Then apparently when I was in the shower Andrea called, and we have a practice on Thursday at six, oy, I hope can make it.  Stress.  I also hope they aren’t planning another sucky drama, the last two were killer…but you never know.

      Let’s see.  Yesterday was Sunday, church was good.  Pastor Al talked about the word ‘enthusiasm’ and what not.  It really got me thinking about how I do have a negative attitude at times.  I always used to try and keep a positive outlook, but lately…not as much.  I have just given up in a way.  But a thought hit me…I know that God exists, better still, I know he loves me and longs for me.  Not many people accept, care, or place any value in that…so I am very fortunate.  If anything else, I can place this wretched life of mine in his hands, and it isn’t even always ‘wretched’.  I will find joy in him, because if I don’t, that’s kind of a slap in his face.  It would be as if I were saying “You have given me everything when I deserve nothing, but I still hate living.”  Come on Camille, you are not expected to always be busting with laughter, but hold fast to him and give him what he deserves.  My thanks, my love, my honor.

      Okay, it was really fun tonight.  Just classic Studer fun, at Riverside park.  I must say though, during the fireworks I really wanted some sweet guy that I could just lean over and plant a soft little kiss on his cheek.  But I was sitting next to Emily and Erik.  No such luck.  *smacks head*  Ah, well.  I got to see Brandon Emerick and his flavor of the week snuggle right in front of me, yeah.  Heh.  hes beautiful, but has never even said 'hey' to me, nor do I think he knoiws I am alive...but eh.  He truly is a jerk, I just am attracted to him.  Whatever.

      Ug.  Boring Saturday.  Party and the park is going on, we only went up for a bit.  I hate it, the minute someone I know sees me they come up and want to ‘chat’.  GAH!  I don’t want to chat with people from Vinton!  Ah well.  We might go up to the parade later, I will probably go just to make the folks and Emily happy.  Blah.  We finished ‘Aliens’ and watched ‘Alien3’ last night.  How fun.    I’m not trying to be this dull, I just feel blah.  I want a job, classes, a project, something!  I would even love to just paint my room!  Gah!  I wish we could move.  Dad always talks about moving to Germany, and lately even more often.  I would love it.  But I guess it doesn’t really matter where they move, I ‘m getting older and will have my own chance to pick where I want to live.  Still, it would be nice to be near them, I realize how close we are, and I know it would be tough if I just up and vanished out of their lives.  It’d be hard for me as well.  I need to make some CDs for Zach’s birthday present.  I’m burning him two mixed disks, and buying him ‘The Green Mile’.  Yeah, but of course just when I am trying to get MusicMatch working, I am all frustrated and Mom comes in and asks what I am doing, I tell her and shes like that isn’t necessary and she says the minute we get our computer fixed no more downloading!  I am not downloading!  I am copying some cds of Seth’s and a few of mine to make the mixes for him!  She has no idea what she is talking about.  Neither does Dad, they think they do but they can barely figure out how to send an e-mail.  I swear, if they keep hounding me like this EVERY time I get on the computer I am so buying a laptop.  Then I will have a little peace and a computer that hasn’t been totally screwed up by children.  That’s my biggest problem, my parents give me so much work and responsibility, but they hardly let me do anything and when they do they act like its SO good of them to allow their young daughter to do things the average parent wouldn’t bat an eyelash about.

      Blah, the day has gone a bit better.  We went to see ‘Fahrenheit911' this afternoon.  It was fantastic.  Seriously, I was fairly skeptical going in I wasn’t sure if it would be outrageously bias or not, but I really don’t think it was.  Michael Moore stated the facts, and showed authentic footage.  Sure he slanted it artistically, but you have to with your own art work.  I think it is a film everyone should see, it sure made me have even more doubt in our government. So much BS goes on its not even funny.  They’re not even that good at covering it up!  Man, first ‘JFK’ and now this.  There were times watching that film when I wanted to scream my head off with rage, and times when it was so awful tears flowed.  It is incredible what some people will do for money.  Gah.  Theres so much, just see the film.  I’m down with the sibs watching ‘Aliens’ its good.  Blah.  Super fun Friday night.  I was going to be riding roller coasters with Zach in Des Moines today, but the boy’s drivers ed got rescheduled and he had to skip the party.  Bummer.  Well thats what I get for having a guy friend who is just shy of 16.  Dang it.

      They’re gone.  Last night actually got a little bit better, for a while I didn’t think EVERYONE on this earth hated me.  But not before I had a wretched time in my room.   I was downstairs doing laundry and heard them talking about me, like I was some dorky little brat.  I can’t stand it.  I just went up to my room and shut the door.  My room was wicked clean, it was cold and the windows were open.  I jumped on my bed and looked out the window, the only light from the moon coming from the moon, shining through the leaves of my tree.  I have never laid in the dark like that, well, not when I felt like that.  It was terrifying, for the first time I seriously doubted my family.  Not just the normal doubts, I really thought they hated me.  I dunno….gah.  Then this morning Dad yelled at Laura and Emily, (I was in the shower, lucky) about how all we do is complain about Mom while she works non-stop.  The man used ‘ironing’ as an example apparently.  He said “You guys have mountains of ironing, and you never do anything!”  MY GOSH!  We just got ALL our stuff done yesterday and MOM is the one with an ironing basket that is COMPLETELY overflowing anyways!  SHE rarely even does it!!!  Stress.  Oy.  Well at least I didn’t have to go  ‘Adventureland’ today, Zachs plans changed and he couldn’t make it.  He was bummed and so was I.  But to be honest I am sort of glad it didn’t work out.    Gah!  And I saw pool boy again yesterday.  On Wednesday I was up at dad’s office and he skated by, well, he saw me.  He came over and is like    Aaron: You haven’t been swimming much lately. Camille:  Yeah, I have been pretty busy this week. Aaron:  Ah, well you know, I was just wondering if you wanted to do something sometime…you know you could call me or whatever. Camille: Um, well you see…I am not really wanting to get involved with anyone like that right now…you know what I mean?   You seem like a really nice guy, I just am not seeing anyone right now, but thanks for asking. Aaron:  Oh that’s fine I was just wondering…  Then blah blah blah for about 15 minutes, just small talk.  He actually wasn’t that bad, I think his friends made him seem worse then he actually is.  Still, they are HIS friends.  So after a bit I jut had to say “Well I better get back to work.”  And then he finally skated away.  *smacks forehead*  Then I saw him and his friends skating when I was getting gas yesterday, I filled up, paid outside and got away before he saw me.  *whew*  This is not what I need right now.  Anyways.  I will be alright if I can just get along with the folks.  Oh yeah, its Sophia’s birthday today, little daring.  She has been such a little lover lately, we are going to have her party next week luckily, I don’t have a gift for her yet.

      Today is absolute tripe.  I feel like I want to rip my skin off.  I can’t stand living in this house right now, I can’t take the pressure.  Well I CAN, but I don’t want to and I am so so so sick of it.  I feel like my stinking mother hates me.  I don’t know what to do.  This house is my paradise and my prison, I can’t leave but I don’t know how I can stay.       Oh God help me.

      Well we had a bead class tonight, made $400 bucks as a whole, not bad.  I am getting so spoiled.  I should be so happy to make money this easy, but eh.  Whatever.  So yeah, spent most of the day getting ready for that.  We’re off to Des Moines tomorrow, Mom, Erik, Nile, and I.  It should be fairly entertaining.  Plus I want to get some more ‘dressy’ summer clothes, I need to quit being a slob and only wearing T-shirts and jeans.  But I LIKE them….ah well.  Gahhhh!  Cripe.  Frustration to the extreme.  I need something, I don’t know what, but something.  Perhaps its just finding a way to be content with here and now.    I need to copy some of Seth’s music.

      Well they’re home, and it feels pretty good to not have to worry about the kids anymore.  Not like they were a huge pain, and Laura and Emily were so awesome, they helped so much.  We got along great, Laura and I didn’t fight once!  Woop!  We did the drama today at church. Oh, and I shut my alarm of and fell back asleep this morning, so I woke up with an hour and fifteen minutes to shower, do my hair, grab my stuff, and get to church by eight...as well as make sure the house was in order before I left.  STRESS!  Ug, I did it though.  Sound check went well, but when we went to do it during first service, the cd was junk.  It kept skipping, and timing is everything with this drama, so we had to start again.  And again when they put the same messed up cd BACK in.  Gah.  Anyways, we got it, and it was wonderful.  Same for second, without the technical difficulties. *wink*  God let me feel him very close today, during worship.  It was wonderful, I was so dissapointed at how the groupies were acting this morning, not like they were doing anything that bad, I just had no desire to talk with any of them.  Well...at least to the ones who normally talk to me, I would love it HE would talk to me, but he only watches and smiles.  Anyways....thats beside the point.  I just forgot everyone else, sat in a chair away from the loud group, and focused.  It was the youth worship team, and I love them so much, they’re fantastic.  I stood in the asle, and just shot my mind up to him, lifted my thoughts to him.  You know, when you acknowledge him, you just say screw everything else, its you and me.  Thank you for letting me know you, thank you for careing....oh so much more.  He is beautiful, the times when, like today, he just sprinkles his love on me and I can barely handle it.  It is something I only feel with him, obviously.  Oh whatever...I can’t even begin to describe it.  He is God.  He lets me come into his presence and dance with him, that is something I will never understand.

      Woo hoo!  I’m using Seth’s li’l laptop right now, this little devil has brought happiness to both me and Seth, he gets his own computer and I don’t have to stay up till the wee hours of the morning to talk to people if I don’t want to! *wink* On Vagrant tonight I read a thread about racism, it really made me want to pull my hair out. I don’t know what to say about it...its so vast...yet so stupid and small.  Wow, laughs, I sound like a genius tonight.  Oh so deep! *rolls eyes* I can’t do anything tonight, because I have to watch the kids, but I have got an itch for doing something exciting, like going dancing, I know I just posted something along these lines a couple of hours ago (loser radar sounding) but now its just turned into wanting some reason to dust off the curling iron and pull out some pumps.  You know, have something to look ‘foxy’ for...LAUGHS!  Foxy indeed....

      Okay, I have many a silly love song that I think are wonderful and love to listen to.  This is todays, and its not good for my health.  *Barely Breathing*  By Duncan Sheik       I know what you’re doing, I see it all too clear I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears You really had me going, wishing on a star But the black whole that surround you are heavier by far I believe in your confusion, you were so completely torn Well it must have been that yesterday was the day that I was born  Theres not much to examine, theres nothing left to hide, You really can’t be serious, if you had to ask me why   I say goodbye…   Cause I am barely breathing, and I can’t find the air I don’t know who I’m kidding imagining you care And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day But I don’t suppose its worth the price, worth the price, The price that I would pay  Everyone keeps asking, whats it all about?   I used to be so certain, and I can’t figure out What is this attraction, I only feel the pain Theres nothing left to reason, and only you to blame Will it ever change?   Cause I am barely breathing, and I can’t find the air I don’t know who I’m kidding imagining you care And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day But I don’t suppose its worth the price, worth the price, The price that I would pay  I’ve come to find, I may never know Your changing mind, is it friend or foe? I rise above or sink below With every time, you come and go  Please don’t, come and go  Cause I am barely breathing, and I can’t find the air I don’t know who I’m kidding imagining you care And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day But I don’t suppose its worth the price, worth the price, The price that I would pay

      Well the folks are gone, at least until Sunday.  Donna came and stayed with us last night and carol is with us tonight.  Had drama practice last night, dress rehearsal.  Everything went pretty well, I finally have the dance part down.  Sweet action.  Its going to be really good…  I also found out Katie and I are going to be rooming together when we go to Florida next month, she worked it all out that little schemer.  She also got this new chick named Kelly in with us, she seems really cool so I hope it all goes well.    Other then that, not too much today.  Watched kids, cleaned house, talked with Donna, made bead kits, talked with internet people, talked with Zach on the phone….blah, blah, blah…  I feel bad because I skipped my walk this morning, and then I had pizza tonight, GAH!  Not good!  But I PROMISE to walk tomorrow.  Ahem, yeah.  Man, I really want an adventure right NOW!  I want something to come and drag me away, something that I have to adapt to, and make myself comfortable in.  I need a project, something to pour HUGE amounts of myself into, gah, I dunno…maybe the summer is just making me edgy.  I would like to go trek through the Amazon, or climb a mountain, or scuba dive….ANYTHING!  Join a band, direct a play, shave my head….move to Venice….just something I have never done before!

      Last night I was supposed to have drama practice.  My team was going to meet at a church down in C.R. but when we got there our pastor had called practically the whole youth group together, saying that practice and cell groups (that’s where all the other kids came from) were cancelled.  We needed to pray.  Apparently this week a bunch of crap has been happening to nearly everyone in our youth group, junk that’s never happened before, and our pastor thinks we were under some sort of attack. I don’t know, for some reason I am always a little hesitant to believe that, its seems like the second something goes wrong they blame it on ‘Satan”.  But last night I could feel it, it was real.  On the way down I felt like I was going to throw up, the thing at the pool started to bother me after I left.  I felt like trash, I hated the thought of that perverted guy thinking about me like that.  I just wanted to throw up so bad, I kind of think that feeling of disgust was being used to throw me off, like it was being enhanced.  We got there and all circled up, about 60 of us.  We prayed for our whole group and then we all went to find our own place.  I was still feeling so sick, I found a dark corner and was still for a while.  Then my friend Brittany walked near, and I felt like I needed her to pray for me, that’s really odd, I normally don’t ask someone to listen to my problems and pray, but I needed this.  She was so great about it, and I felt God through her.  I wept and she prayed and prayed.  She hugged me and I felt a peace come over me.  These last few weeks I have felt like such a pathetic being, not worth anything.  I haven’t given god enough time, and I feel wretched about that.  But the trouble is, I love him and I know I should spend time with him, but I didn’t want to read my bible, I didn’t want to be still.  And not wanting to spend time with God, my word, why?  Why not?  He has always been TRULY the most faithful love in my life, why didn’t I want to?  I wanted to want to, but I didn’t and that made me want to die.  My family has been griping about me not being myself, not being as ‘happy’ as I usually am.  But how can I ALWAYS be happy?  I am human, and I have been having a wretched few weeks.  This really showed me how much they count on me, how much of an impact I have in the house.  Emily has really been bugging me, she always spent so much time with me, and now that I have been wanting to be ‘alone’ more often, shes mad.  I think shes really hurt, but she shows it in this nagging angry way, it drives me crazy and only makes me want to be alone more.  This last month has just sucked so bad.     Last night I just came to him, my soul really in despair.  I felt so worthless, like I had let him down, my family down, the few friends I have down.  I just wanted to feel HIM again, that peace that I have known so often, the time with him that for some reason I have pushed off.  I just wanted to feel sane again.  I closed my eyes and lifted my thoughts to him, and he was waiting  I felt him say that he has missed me, that I can trust him.  He will give me peace and always be with me, just hold on.  He will never fail me, these people might, but not him.  No matter where I am, in good times or bad, alone or with surrounded with people who love me, he is there.    I want to just serve him, to be someone he is proud to say is his, to at least TRY.  That’s all I can do, is try and with him succeed in anything I do.  I worshiped him, more then I have in the whole last month, it was beautiful.  He filled me with so much joy it hurt, I was weeping, but what a pain.  I left and I didn’t feel lost, I still wasn’t as happy as I have been, but I think that’s alright.  I remembered my God, we were together again, and he touched me.  I don’t have to be busting with smiles all the time, but I must remember that I am his, and that is something so wonderful.

      Oh my gosh…we just got back from the pool.  That guy was there again, the one who said he ‘liked’ me yesterday.  It was even worse today, they kept talking to me asking me, what my name was, where I lived, if I had a boyfriend, where do I go to school, EVERYTHING.  It was awful, but worst was when one of his friends came over and said “He wants to take you to a movie, then he wants to get you real slow.  He thinks you look like a really special girl, so he said he’d go slow for you. But just so you know, hes a player, I don't think you'd want to go out with him. ”  "Ya think!"  OH MY WORD!  GAH!  So yeah, no beating around the bush.  Cripe, this is going to make swimming in the same pool with him REALLY awkward, if I see him again I am going to have to scream it in his face, he can’t seem to take a hint.  “NOT INTERESTED!”  Man, if I ever wished I had a good guy in my life today was it.  I wanted someone to get in this guys face and say “Hey watch it, shes my girl.  And thats not how you talk to a lady.”  But alas…I had to fend for myself.

      Man, I am wiped and its only 8:30 a.m. Last night I was on the computer IMing people, and then my new friend Zach called at 11:00p.m.  It was really nice to talk to him, hes such an awesome guy.  Anyways, I got off at about 12:45p.m. and fell into bed.  The alarm went off at 5:00a.m. and I out I went, walking.  It had just stopped raining and the air was steamy, but I didn’t mind.  There were water droplets on the end of all the leaves, it looked like they had been coated with glass.  It was gorgeous.  Eh, so yeah, I walked again.

      Pool Drama.  Okay, this afternoon we went to the pool.  It wasn’t super warm, so Emily and I dropped our towels and dove in.  We swam for a while, having a pretty good time, but there was something that was making me a little edgy.  There was this guy, I’m not sure how old he was, but I felt like he was watching me.  He had black hair, very tan skin, a little ethnic looking, quite attractive actually, and he was with another guy (with blonde hair) and a girl.  Of course, without my glasses I wasn’t for sure so I tried to brush it off.  Then Emily and I rested by a wall for a couple of minutes and I heard what they were talking about.  “Why don’t you just ask her?” said the boy with the blonde hair, “Just do it man!”  They talked about me for like 15 minutes then the blonde boy swam over.  “How old are you?”  he asked, “Um, 17.” I said.  “K, cool.” And back he went to the group of three.  About 5 minutes later the girl came over.   “Okay, you see that guy over there?” “Yeah.” “Well, do you like him?  Because he likes you and wants to know.” “Um, well I don’t really know him…whats he want to know?  If I think hes hot or something?  Because to be honest, I wear glasses and I haven’t really been able to get a good look at him. Oh….(She looked surprised that I didn’t answer with a simple ‘yes or no’)  “So what should I tell him.” “I don’t know…tell him that sure hes cute, thank him for liking me, and whatever…” “Alright…”  My gosh!  It was so hard to keep a straight face!  I mean I am going to be an adult in less then a year, but I was being asked if “I liked this guy I had never met before because he likes me.”  *LAUGHS*  So they watch me some more, I hear.  “Just go ask her man!  Do it!  Look at her hair!  No man, that’s got to be a perm.  If you like her just do it!  Aw look guy, shes right THERE, go!”  So they went on and on….  Emily and I got out and toweled off.  I put on my glasses and there he was, smiling at me, grinning actually, and then shyly waved.  I waved back and he freaked.  Em and I went into the lockeroom to get some more sunscreen, and he yelled “Are you LEAVING????”  I shook my head and went through the door.  When we came back out he loked so happy, waved again and started showing off on the diving boards.  He was really good, back flips, awesome dives, the whole deal.  Then the pool closed, and he said ‘bye’ and ran to the lockers.    SO YEAH.  I never really talked to the guy, but I will the next time I see him, just to let him know whats going on, so he can relax a litle. It was too funny, sigh, a little flattering to be honest.  So yeah, that was the pool today.

      Well I did it.  I woke up at five a.m. and went for my walk, an hour and a half.  It was so strange, I really think God had his hand on this.  I only had five hours of sleep, but when my alarm went off I was completely ready to go, it didn’t hurt at all!  I grabbed my ‘Jars of Clay’ cd, and went out into the cool morning.  I felt Gods peace about me, like he was saying   “I care even about the small things you want to do, and I am hear to help you.  And I love you.”  I have not giving him even close to what he deserves lately.  I have worried about the stupidest things, people, my future, how I was going to get my math done this summer, my stupid looks…and I was stressed.  I forgot how much peace he gives me, how much I can count on him.  Why do I forget? I want so much to always love him, always thank and honor him.  I pray I always will.

      I took the kids to ‘Shrek 2’ tonight, it was alright.  I’m having kind of a sucky day, it just started out bad.  I got a new swimming suit in the mail today, tried it on and of course was not too happy about the way it looked.  Its like I feel like I have been trying really hard to get in shape, but its just not coming along as fast as I’d hope.  Its working, all my walking, swimming, better and what not… but still.  *Sigh*  Cripe its not like how I look REALLY matters, but still.  At least I KNOW I am getting stronger and have much more stamina, so that’s good.  Tomorrow I am getting up at five to walk/jog early, and I’ll start my health log.  Please Camille, please don’t push snooze and go back to bed, get up!  Eh, that was interesting.  Anyways, then we went to C.R. this afternoon.  The kids were wretched, absolutely horrible.  They fought about everything.  Then Mom and Laura started in on it, geeze, Laura really doesn’t know when to shut up sometimes, she makes me so freaking angry.  We were all crammed in the minivan, we went shopping at Target so we had all that junk, and the kids say they are hungry.  So of COURSE they can’t pick ONE place to eat at right?  NO!  That would be too easy.  So we’re driving trough like 20 places, and then driving through again because someone forgot to get this or that….MAN!  Our house is half an hour away, but we HAVE to drive through to get our STUPID food because its SO much easier.  GAAAHHHHHHH!  If I have ever had a migraine it was today!  Bah on life and this infernal family!

      Pizzzap!  Woohoo!  I just found out that two of my youth leaders, John and Emily, are getting hitched!  This is SO great!  They are two of the best people I have ever known, and they both seem to care for each other so much…..bah….I am thrilled!  I usually don’t care about the ring, but Emily showed it to me and it IS gorgeous!  The princess diamonds and white gold are nice, but what makes it SO adorable is that Emily said “Oh Camille, he picked it out himself, he did so good!”  Oh gosh, they are so sweet.  I sound like such an airhead, but I honestly don’t do this with every engagement I hear about, this is exceptional.   *tears*

      I have been tossing around the idea of starting a blog for a while, and I have decided to go with it.  Well obviously.  I have started many a journal in my time, but I HATED the idea of my innermost feelings lying around in a book somewhere, and I was never really motivated to keep them up.  This resulted in numerous small books with about a months worth of entries, and many a page torn out.  I do believe this will be good for me though, I need a place where I can vent a  little but not worry about stressing out my family/close friends too much.  Just a place to say whatever, the important things, as well as the stupidest, minuscule thoughts.  Plus I would very much like to improve my writing skills, and practice makes perfect, no?  So that’s that.  It has begun.

      Oh crap it all.&nbsp; I’m sick.&nbsp; I woke up at five thirty, walked for an hour and a half, went to tennis lessons, gave a bead class at the library, mowed Dad’s office lawn, cleaned the kitchen, folded all the towels, put away tents for the kids, helped clean the cars, and ironed while Seth and I watched the some of the Democratic National Convention.&nbsp; All the while, I notice I am getting sick.&nbsp; My infernal nose has been slightly running all day, my throat is stinking sore, I have a minor headache, and my bloody back hurts.&nbsp; I swear I am not trying to throw a pity-party here, I’m just not used to being this busy and sick all at once.  Ah well, I just soaked in a peppermint bubble bath and the work is done for the day.&nbsp; Thank you Lord for that.  We’re going up to Minnesota this weekend, staying with Uncle Joe and Aunt Vicie like old times.  Except….  It won’t be like old times.&nbsp; Old times were when my cousin Susan and I would spend EVERY second we could together.&nbsp; We’d always sit together, ride in the same tube behind Uncle Joes boat…and the best was when we’d lay in her bed late into the night and just talk.&nbsp; Aunt Vickie would always come and gripe at us to go to sleep, but we never would.&nbsp; We would talk about everything and anything.&nbsp; From how much we love to run barefoot in the grass, to our first conversations about *gasp* boys at age 11.&nbsp; I loved that girl.  Its just…when we got into high school things changed.&nbsp; We weren’t as close, she became so full of herself, and completely obsessed with her looks. And then last year in January, we got a call that she was pregnant.&nbsp; She was 16 years old at the time.&nbsp; Oh man, it freaked me out.&nbsp; Not Susan.&nbsp; Not the girl I had giggled with and written so many letters to when I was young.&nbsp; Not her.&nbsp; But it was.&nbsp; It was so sad, Uncle Joe had always loved his girls so much, and wanted only for them to live happy lives, and we could see how much this was hurting him, no matter how hard he tried to cover it up.&nbsp; They were a wealthy, conservative, seemingly perfect, successful family….and than pow.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Ug, it’s a long story.&nbsp; All in all, they decided that Susan would keep the baby, finish school, and at this time NOT marry the father.&nbsp; Everything was going well until one night when Susan was bout 6 months along.&nbsp; She went into labor early, started to hemorrhage, and lost the baby.&nbsp; Had they gotten her to the hospital 10 minutes later, she would have died.  Wow, I can’t believe I just told that story, it really wasn’t necessary…I guess its just been on my mind as of late.&nbsp; So yes, things won’t be the same with cousin Susan, and her having been pregnant is part of it, but not all.&nbsp; I don’t know, I just hope it won’t be too awkward this weekend.  &nbsp;Okay, I’m sick.&nbsp; I need to be in bed.&nbsp; Please pass the Nyquil.

      Okay yes, today I have a zit.&nbsp; It’s not just a ‘Clogged pore, semi-small, white bump, looking thing’, it’s the bloody real deal.&nbsp; It’s a big old ‘I’m a teenager and what the heck is that MOUNTAIN on the left side of your chin? Em? Em?’.&nbsp; That’s what its like.  Meghan sent Seth a new album, its by ‘Copeland’ and I absolutely adore it. I burned a copy and every chance I get I pop it in.&nbsp; Its really funny though, I noticed a lot of the theme seems to lean towards lovers being apart and missing each other.&nbsp; Hmmm, that’s interesting, no?

      Okay, whats been fun as of late….  I took Erik to his first concert on Saturday night.&nbsp; It was just Apt 211, so not that big of a deal. ‘Jonah 33’ was playing and this sucky intro band called ‘Stricken’.&nbsp; It was actually really fun, all my friends ADORED Erik, they thought he was so sweet.&nbsp; Joel, Bobby, and Eric taught him how to head bang, Katie and Alex chatted with him in the coffee shop, and Tiff and Nichole just wouldn’t be quiet about how ‘Freaking cute!’ he was.&nbsp; He had a blast.&nbsp;   Tiff and I got al the costuming done for our new drama, oh and we just found out that the performance date got moved up three weeks.&nbsp; So now we only have two practices left before our first performance, and I will be in Minnesota during both of those.&nbsp; Oh, and I’m right in front and center.&nbsp; But hey, I’ll pull it off somehow.  We had tennis today, I’m getting better.&nbsp; I actually served better then Laura and Emily, so that was cool.  The weather is beautiful.&nbsp; Its like 75 degrees, insanity!&nbsp; It’s July!&nbsp; For cripes sake!&nbsp; Ah well, I shouldn’t complain, our windows are open and I don’t have to worry about sweating like an animal.&nbsp; I have hooked Sophia’s new cart thingy to the back of my bike and we’ve been crusin all over town.&nbsp; I give her a bunch of books and crackers, and shes good until I’m wiped.&nbsp; Fun.&nbsp;   Okay, I have to go, more later hopefully.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Oh my word, I just had something crazy happen.&nbsp; I was driving home from Cedar Rapids, and I was *ahem* trying to get home fast.&nbsp; Okay, I was going 66 in a 55 zone, or something like that.&nbsp; Anyways, well I saw police lights flash.&nbsp; Cripe.&nbsp; So I pull over, yank out my wallet and the cop steps up to the window.&nbsp; Ha ha!&nbsp; Its one of our GREAT friends officer Eric Feller!&nbsp; He grins at me, says “Okay sweetie, you’re just going a little fast, but you have a nice night hon.” He winks and walks away.  &nbsp;  Okay, sweet action!&nbsp; This is when I LOVE living in a small town.&nbsp; I was like the feller families favorite babysitter, and they freaking worship our whole family, so I slid through my first possible speeding ticket.&nbsp; Praise Neptune.  &nbsp;  Oh my word, these last two weeks have been insane.&nbsp; I was with my youth group from July 11 through the 16, then busy all day Saturday.&nbsp; And Sunday.&nbsp; Then Monday.&nbsp; Then Tuesday.&nbsp; Oh, and today I woke up, had to spend the morning working on bead business stuff, dashed to work for 5 hours, ran to Church, then got picked up on the way home.&nbsp; I&nbsp; am not kidding, either I have been working my butt off at home, mowing, work at Dad’s, in Cedar Rapids doing stuff, tennis lessons, at church, just stuff stuff stuff!&nbsp; Even my internet life has been crammed, replying to piled up e-mails, talking with TOO many people at one time way into the night, and confirming bead orders.&nbsp; Oy, and the esrt of the week is just as crammed, drama practices, church, friends coming over, and work.&nbsp;  &nbsp;Man its been nuts.&nbsp; It’s so funny, when a blogger like myself doesn’t have much going on she can post a lot, but its usually boring.&nbsp; And when I have a crazy, busy, interesting life, I have no time to talk about it.&nbsp; Sick.

      Okay well I’m back, and I had an incredible time.&nbsp; I still plan on writing about it, but right now I just want to make sure I get this posted.&nbsp; Long story short, I was in Cedar rapids tonight, I got home, Dad had pulled in two seconds before me because him, mom, and Seth were all still at this party thing at a friends house.&nbsp; So I head back over with him, listen to a crappy local band (but they did play one Greenday song), and watched my parents and older brother get drunk.&nbsp; K, it was really just the bro, poor dear.&nbsp; He kept getting all huggy and putting his arm around me and what not, very funny.&nbsp; Anywho, so we decide to walk home, Dad and Mum will come in a bit, so here are a few little tidbits from our conversation when we got home.&nbsp; Z boy was tipsy, and it was a riot.&nbsp; Believe me, this is NOTHING!&nbsp; He was talking so fast this is probably a hundredth of the hilarious stuff that came out of my brothers mouth, I could only write so fast.&nbsp; I think I need to invest in a tape recorder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Seth: Dubuqe, Davenport, Johnson County, New York City, Iraq.  &nbsp;  Camille: Oh nice, seven beers and a push up.  &nbsp;  Seth: Dinosaurs are scary.  &nbsp;  Camille:&nbsp; Ah huh.  &nbsp;  Seth: Well they are!&nbsp; They had big toes, like nails…they did!&nbsp; They were scary…and…they killed that boy in Jurassic Park…  Aw, wheres Meghan?&nbsp; Shes not on the couch anymore.&nbsp; She was here…but now shes gone.  &nbsp;  Camille:&nbsp; Okay now THAT I’m not putting online.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Seth: No you got to put that on there because I’m drunk and its funny and she’s cute.  I put my shirt back on, see its all buttoned up and I miss Meghan.&nbsp; Man it sucks, she went back to her stupid Oregon, and that sucky Portland.&nbsp; Man everyone should live in Iowa.&nbsp; Did I do that to that horse?&nbsp; Because if I did it I want to undo it because it looks like crap.&nbsp; That’s good, that’s good, that’s good pie.&nbsp; Seriously don’t tell Mom that I was in here with you guys eating pie while I was drunk, she’ll kill me.&nbsp; Seriously, because she’ll think I am influencing you guys in like a bad way.&nbsp; Did I say something about Grandma Maude?&nbsp; So do you like the part where Satan kills God? But it’s okay because God comes back at the end and kicks his butt.&nbsp; Hey!&nbsp; No, you put HER when you should of put HERE!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; That’s wrong!&nbsp; You made it wrong!  &nbsp;  Camille:&nbsp; Gosh I’m going to fix it shut up!  &nbsp;  Seth:&nbsp; Then there was the time when I met the sleeping monkey in my closet, and I taught him the lesson about how to respect himself. All he had to do was make the face and I taught him how to become a flying dolphin.&nbsp; Now that’s some serious stuff, like the Holocaust.&nbsp; Man that was some serious stuff, people were dying and everything.&nbsp; Man I’m drinking root beer and its diet and good for me because its LOW CARB!  &nbsp;  Camille:&nbsp; You read slow.  &nbsp;  Seth:&nbsp; What are you looking at?&nbsp; You guys suck I’m going downstairs…man you guys are such losers…I’m going.&nbsp; Okay I can’t open this door…okay I’m going downstairs, and oh man it’s dark and I’m scared!&nbsp; I’ve got ‘Wheat Thins’!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So yes, I really want to write about my trip and so much other stuff, but nows not the time.&nbsp;

      Well, I’m off to Florida in the morning.  I’m going with my *ahem* youth group.  Its supposed to be some sort of conference/fun ‘get to have a good time’ trip or something….I’m not sure.  All I know is I got talked into signing up in February  by some of the pals, and now the trips here.  So tomorrow, I’ll grab my bag, make sure I leave all my ‘non-Christian’ cds at home lest they be confiscated, and hop on a bus full of rowdy church groupies.  We’ll play bull, talk our stinking heads off, the guys and a few of the girls (not ME of course, ahem.) will drink so much AMP and REDBULL that they’ll be freaking out and asking to urinate every ten minutes.  Then when it gets dark, everyone will get all snuggly and pester you and pester you asking who YOU are involved with, c’mon Camille, tell.  And I’ll sit there, longing for my shower, look at them with glazed over eyes and ramble off some generic answer that will make them step off for a while.  Then we’ll get there.  Oh yeah, every trip is exactly the same.  I have it down to a science.  Heheh, no I shouldn’t pretend to be so grumpy, I do have fun.   Seriously, I really am just going to try and take this trip time to really focus on the Lord alone when I can, I won’t have to worry about getting stuff done up here, I’ll just try and give HIM the attention he deserves.  I have really been awful about that as of late, so I’m praying that it will just be a good time with Him.  And of course, the groupies.  *sigh*  So yes indeed, I won’t be back until next Friday night.  Goodbye for a bit.

      All right, our computer is back.  Nice.  Apparently we just had virus issues, our program was outdated and what not…anyways.  We now have better programs and the tech gave me instruction to keep it cleaned.  So I have self appointed myself as compys doctor, I will try and keep him as well as possible.  Heh.  I got my haircut this morning, made my layers even MORE drastic, it feels great its been THREE months *gasp* since my last trim.  Shocking.  Chelsea and Zach were going to come over this afternoon, we were going to hang out, head to Cedar Rapids, probably see an IMAX, shop, dinner, what not… but the plans fell through.  Heheh.  I was actually pretty relieved, this weeks been crazy and even though I  did  clean my room and made my hair nice, I wasn’t really in the mood to play hostess.  Still though, I forgot my favorite red shoes at Chelsea’s place the other day, and she was going to bring them, not so good.  I wants me shoes.  Things are going so much better with mum and I.  Oh man, it’s such a relief.  Who knows why, but I am not going to ask.  Perhaps it’s just that I have been trying harder, or maybe it’s because me mum was just letting the stress get to her, I don’t know.  I drove her down to Cedar Rapids tonight (She had to meet Father and a few friends for dinner), and we talked and had a just a wonderful time.  When I dropped her off at the restaurant, she made sure I had a cell phone and then said “Drive safe, we’ll see you later tonight.  Bye Cam, I love you.”  Oh gosh, my heart just melted.  She shut the door before I could say anything back, but the only thing I said anyways was “Yeah…” wow I’m smooth, thank Neptune she didn’t hear me.

      Okay, the compys in the shop, I hope it gets back soon and I hope its half way decent.  Who knows.  I'm up at the library and we just finished giving a bead workshop.  There were like five million kids here, trying to string beads into fantastic little mutated projects...heheh.  It was insane, but we're alive and the children of Vinton are happy.  It's FREAKING cold here!!!  It's July in Iowa, it's supposed to be at least 95 degrees, and we're wearing sweatshirts at 69!!!  What gives? This state has weather mood swings worse then a teenage girl!  Good cripe.  Well have to run, I hope compy gets back soon.

      Okay, check it.  Doing stuff, living.  Spent yesterday in Cedar rapids with the Chicas, bought some clothes, saw ‘Spiderman2’, went to Target, and of course Emily insisted on Arbys, it’s a ‘Studer Sibling Classic’ as we would say. Good old classic fun. Did the pool thing today, the girl from the homeschool group who shall not be named was there.  She talked to me, and I had to respond and pretend to be interested and what not…truly the grace of god got me through it.  That girl is the essence of cheekiness and mood swings.  You who know me well know who this girl is.  Blah and things.  ***  Conversations from the hood that make me laugh inside and out.    Camille:  Ew, Laura makes me feel dirty. Emily:  I know it’s like just look at her. Camille:  Ew.  ***  Mom:  …so the bear takes the hedgehog back to his lodge and puts him on his straw –like bed thing… Camille:  Wait, wait, wait…is this a ‘co-ed’ lodge?     Mom: Well they’re all boys…  So I guess they could be gay… Camille:  Yeah, because these days ‘co-ed’ doesn’t mean a thing.  ***  Mom: …wow… Emily:  Mom, you can’t say ‘wow’ anymore, it isn’t the thing. Camille:  Yeah, now you have to say ‘She bang biz ba boo’ to be hip. Mom:  Well I’m afraid I’m not going to do that.  ***  Mom:  Are you sure you don’t want any? Camille:  No I’m fine, if I start then I won’t want to stop…so I should probably just stay away from drugs…and food… and alchohol…and sex… Mom:  *Laughs head off*

      Well hmm.  I am feeling quite a bit better then I was last night, let’s try and break a whole long story into points as to why I’m feeling better.  *I talked with the sisters last night about why I have been ‘grumpy’ lately, told them I wasn’t mad at them, I am just frustrated and feeling smothered.  I think they understood.  We watched the kids together, joked around, laughed our heads off, and went back to being the allied force of the Studer sisters.  I don’t know what happened, we were cleaning the kitchen while the kids played in the yard and I made a joke about something and the girls just busted up, Emily laughed so hard she had tears running down her face.  It felt so good to not be mad at each other, it was as if something clicked and the tension was gone.  It faded away in our laughter.  *Mom was really fairly nice to me on Friday, I think she felt sorry about how bad things got Thursday night, even though she’s still probably feeling the way she did, it’s kind of nice to think that she has some flicker of love in her heart for me.  *Laugh* Okay maybe I’m being a little dramatic, but still.  When that woman is angry with me I can’t stand it.  The best was when her and Dad came home from their date.  She walked in the house and said it looked wonderful, and then we all sat in the living room together and talked about their evening.   I sat at her feet wrapped up in a blanket, and I didn’t even worry about my parents being disappointed with me.  Then she pulled out three Target gift cards, and gave one to each of us girls.  She said they were for babysitting, but we haven’t gotten paid for babysitting in years, well, at least not for just a few hours like last night.  All I am saying is that the gift cards were a peace offering, as sick as that may seem.  When Mom handed me mine I knew it was her little way of saying she was sorry.  *sigh*  I will get through this.  I will try my hardest, and do whatever I can to please my family.  But if that doesn’t work I’m not going to kill myself over it.  I’m done with feeling frustrated and guilty.  I will trust in Christ, and he will pull me through.  Okay, so that’s my ending to Friday night, here’s my Saturday in somewhat of a nutshell.   *Woke up, stared out my window at the bright green leaves of summer and hopped out of bed.  Showered and all that good stuff. *Did chores around the house.  Went through room.  I am trying to get rid of as much stuff as possible, I feel a need to get organized, find my center you might say.  Anywho, I have already cleaned out quite a bit of stuff, a lot of clothes and the like, so that’s fantastic to me. *Put away the boys laundry, it’s quite a chore, it took me an hour and a half.  Little savages and their infernal clothes. *Did my weight training.  Weird I know.   *Cleaned some more.  *Got on the computer, talked with lovely people, replied to e-mails, did my little computer chores, all that good stuff. *Then there was the walk.  Now, I was debating on whether or not I should even go, I was exhausted and the weather was a little iffy, what with the darks skies and all the rain in the afternoon.  But in the end I forced myself to go.  I grabbed my diskman, slammed in new batteries and a Greenday album, put on my running shorts and Nike airs, and ran out the door.  I had gotten to the river, it took me about fifteen minutes, when I felt the first rain drops.  Soft warm little dots of water, and then about 30 seconds later it was coming down in sheets.  ‘Oh man, what should I do?  I have got my diskman with me, and do I want to be soaking wet for another hour and fifteen minutes?’  Sure I do.  I held on to my diskman really tight (Thank heaven it’s old and a piece of crap so I really didn’t worry about it that much.) and started running fast towards downtown, and possibly the safety of dad’s office or something.  It was the most fantastic thing ever.  I ran and ran, the rain was so warm and coming down in such fantastic amounts, it really was like a ‘shower’.  Oh man it felt great, I was still by the river and the raindrops plinked on it’s surface which was only about ten feet below me.  I probably looked like a savage, running in the rain like that, but I don’t care.  I haven’t had as much fun in a long time.  It was gorgeous.  Anywho, it rained straight for about 20 more minutes, and then off and on for the rest of my walk.  I was soaking wet, and the only real problem I had with this was I felt myself getting a blister from the wet skin on my left ankle.  It hurt really bad but I pushed on.  It got dark and fireflies twinkled, darling little insect pixies floating in the hot summer air.  I got home and Erik and Nile laughed at how wet I was, Nile said I looked like a cat that fell in a toilet, and Emily screamed “Oh my gosh! Look at your ankle!”    I had taken my shoes off at the front door, and now I looked down at me foot.  I was still wearing a sock but the back half was covered in blood, literally bright red.  I pulled it off and the back of my ankle was covered in thick dark blood, and to be honest the skin was not looking so pretty.  So yes, I guess I did have a blister.

       Went to a drama meeting last night, apparently we are officially getting the group back together.  Ug, but the first thing we are going to do sounds like it’s really going to suck, ah well.  I will try and stay positive for Tiff.  She’s a good girl.  It was so funny, on the way down I was listening to Greenday, I got there and realized I was wearing my ‘Tropical Brewing Company’ shirt with the mermaid on it, and I pulled out a Stephan King novel to fill out a form on.  Heh, so I guess you could say I failed as a youth group groupie.  Ah well, at least I’m honest.  Uggg…. The folks had a talk with me last night.  They think I am not involved enough, that I can’t focus because I stay up too late….oh and so much other stuff.  I was crying by the end of it.  It sucked so bad.  I don’t know what to do, I guess I am just going to try harder to do extra junk around here….blah. I realize that I haven’t been doing enough around here, I have been frustrated, but I just…I have wanted a break from it all.  Oh man, they hounded me…and yes I have screwed up in areas…still.  It sucks.  I wish I could just run away for a while, not leave the family completely, but just not be part of it right now, and when I came back it would all be the same.  Ah!  I am rambling, let me try and break it into points.  My problems.  *They think I am not focused. *They don’t like how much I am on the computer (I realize I have been on it more then ever lately, but compared to most people it’s nothing!). *They don’t like me getting calls from a certain boy  (Even though I HAVE NO STUPID FEELINGS FOR THE GUY!!! And he might as well be a girl for cripes sake!  They just don’t trust me!!!) *They don’t like me driving down to Cedar Rapids so much, okay, fine.  Why don’t you dig up some cool people in Vinton for me then, hmm?  Please parents!!  Do it!!  You moved me to this little patch of nothing, whipped me out of school before I even got started, and now you want to gripe at me about my friends being far away and sometimes the opposite sex????  Forget you!!!  I have worked my butt off to make you two happy!!!  And now I have a couple of bad months, and it’s like all that was for nothing!  I am not trying to sneak around and DO anything, it wouldn’t be worth it!  Why are they so FREAKING suspicious???  I am 17 years old!!!  You don’t need to hold my hand when I cross the freaking street, I am going to be an adult next year!!!  You two were three years from being married with a kid when you were my age, but you FREAK out when you hear that I might have a few guy friends that I talk to often!  Oh and yes!!!!  Now I need to focus more on SCHOOL work, NOW I do!  What about all those times I begged to start a new math book???  All those infernal hours of reading???  Why is it NOW school is a PROBLEM for me????  WHY???   *Oh, and my sisters are driving me crazy too.  Emily is snippy with me everytime I do something she doesn’t like, go to Cedar Rapids, get on the computer…whatever.  If I am not totally entertaining them and being my ‘Charming Camille’ self, she HATES me.  And it’s the same with Laura, only she just acts like a bitchy dork.  But to be honest, I like her more then Emily lately. *I don’t know where I want to go to college.  Do I stay here in Vinton and attend Kirkwood here and in Cedar Rapids because I can live at home and the folks will pay for school?  Or should I just tear myself away, fly somewhere, almost kill myself getting adjusted to living on my own and the pressure of school and bills? *Yes, I need to work on my math, but we have been so crazy busy that when I find time to do it, Mom can’t help me….gah!!!  It’s not that hard, I just need to get the crap done. *I need to find a a  job  because I want to start saving up loads of money.  Sure I could work lot’s more hours at Dad’s but to be honest…I HATE IT!!!!  I hate that place!  It’s a beautiful office, I get paid 8 dollars an hour, my father is there…but I hate it!!  I always get my work done so quick that I just have to wait for the phone to ring or for the other secretary to bring me something to fax.  When there is loads of work to do it’s great, the time fly’s…but there is rarely a day like that for me.  I would rather be a waitress with a hundred tables to wait on then this infernal having to dress up and talk to rich old people who are about ready to croak!!!!! *Oh and yes, the stupid boy I have had somewhat of a crush on for the past three years seems to have no feelings for me now, and you know what?  Neither do I!!!  What is wrong with me?  The boy I was so sure I would like forever, the boy I thought I could maybe, possibly marry, I could care less if I ever saw him again!!!  HA!!   Am I going insane???  I feel fine, I honestly do, and I think if I were a year older none of this would even be a problem, but it’s this NOW stupid being 17 problem and stiull having my parents control practically everything I do, I have to check EVERYTHING with them.  Check check check.  Take a cell phone.  What are you doing on the computer?  Who are you talking to?  Why are you talking to them?  Come do stuff with us, come come come.  Do your dang chores, feed the stupid cat, sort the crappy laundry!!!  Mop the stupid floor!!!  Oh, but still love us and want to spend time with us, k?  *tears*  I do still love them.    Okay, I don’t think I solved ANYTHING but it felt good to get some of that out.  I only wish I could give more details, but this is a public blog, and some things should stay inside my head and house. And what a mess I have made of it already.  I’m sorry to whoever (if anyone) who might read this.  I guess I need to vent and just do and say whatever I want to for a change.  Gah!   I wish I was on a plane to the Bahamas right now with a great book on my lap, and a charming guy who loves me sitting next to me.  But nope.  Isn’t happening.  Oh God, I’m sorry to be so stressed.  I wish I wasn’t.

      I have come up with an idea for my problem of having to deal with bead clients that drive me insane. Said beaders always gripe/bitch/complain/second guess me no matter what I am doing, you would think they were the ones teaching the freaking bead class. Good cripe. So I have decided to instate some classes that will give me a break from these infernal people every once in a while. Along with our ‘public’ classes, we are going to hold the ‘Elite bead core’ parties. These classes will be held at our home (In the living room most likely, yay and fun!) and will be most exclusive. Basically that means, only the people I want to come will be invited. Mother has given me complete control over said parties, and I intend to enjoy this power.  Yay for being a brat and picking favorites.

      Slept on the couch last night, it was nice.  The council of siblings have done this for the last three nights because of the strange cold weather, well…that’s our excuse at least.  Tennis this morning, went smashingly.  Except for the part right in the beginning when I was laying on the couch and Laura screamed “Oh my gosh!!!  Its 9:10 and we have tennis at 9:00!!!”  Heh, so the tennis sibs and I drove to our lessons clad in pajamas, and dash it all….we did AWESOME!  I would say my level today made it right up to ‘Not completely crap’ and that’s saying a lot.  Cha.

      Okay bloggy, I am back.  These last couple of weeks have been insane, I feel really bad about being so lazy and ignoring this blog. Let me try and remember the big points, then I can start afresh with no guilt.  *We had three bead classes, and made up a ton of kits, so that took a lot of time. I have really gotten back into beads, with a serious passion. I haven’t been this excited about them for a while.  *We have still been doing tennis, so that’s cool.  *I have worked a couple days at Dad’s, so that was boring as usual.  *I am considering joining up with my old dance group again, that’s completely weird because when I quit I vowed never to join again. But eh, I guess the dance just wants out.  *I have decided to paint my walls tope and buy all those old movies posters I have been dreaming about, they include but are not limited to: Casablanca, Rear Window, Notorious, Singing in the Rain, and most importantly…The Godfather.  *We went to Adventureland as a fam, had an okay time and now we can live until next summer free of guilt from the parental units. They will not be allowed to pull “You didn’t even go to Adventureland with us this year.” Out and use it as blackmail. We have them now.  *Okay, through quite an unfortunate, insane, barely believable turn of events, Zach and I are no longer friends. I wish I could just pour out the whole thing here, but that’s not fair to him. Baisically what it bolied down to was him completely dumping me as a friend because he didn’t agree with my view on something, I was willing to accept our differences, but he didn’t care enough I guess. So ther we have it, he just slapped me out of his life. This is the first time I have ever been rejected by a firend that I actually cared about, and I guess it was just more shock then anything. Ug, if you don’t know the story then it probably makes no sense. Lets just say I got the smack layed down on me, and for no good reason whatsoever.  Oh I guess that’s good enough, I know I did more stuff though, my brain is just too fried to think about it. I am going to try and be better in the future. Promise.

      Mom: ...so he goes "You are the spiting image of Cathy!" and...  Camille:  Wait, wait, wait, did he say "spiting" or "spitin" ?  Mom:  I guess he said "spitin".  Camille:  Okay, that's what I thought.  Good job on the rest of the story though.  Mom:  Oh good, thanks!

      Well we got back around 1 last night.  I had to be up at 5 to make it to church on time to do our drama, it went very well but I was exhausted and didn’t really know the whole thing because I only made it to 2 practices but s’all good.  I was able to wing it.  Minnesota was pretty fun.  And it wasn’t even THAT awkward with Susan.  She was acting pretty sweet, and I had a good time with her when her boyfriend wasn’t around.  Aside form that, the boating was incredible.  I forgot how much I enjoy it.  Uncle Joe lives on a lake so that’s where we were most of the time, either on the beach or riding in his speed boat.  I just plain adore going that fast on the water.  It was to windy to ski (Plus I haven’t done it in years, so that’s lucky for me!) but just perfect for ‘tubing’ and oh did we tube!  They have a ‘Monster tube’ and Susan, Laura, Emily and I all got on it and just had a ball.  We laughed our heads off.  Then Emily and I took SOHPIA on it!  Yes, 3 year old Sophy went tubing.  She LOVED it, I had a death grip on a strap on her lifejacket and away we went with the little darling giggling and her golden curls flying in the wind.  Too much fun.  Yes yes, great fun and what not.  Oh, and they also took some of us to the races!  Can you believe Camille went to the races???  I can barely believe it.  Well the expierence was too be sure quite alien, and between worrying about the junky cars possibly flying of the track made of mud, or getting caught in a brawl going on between some spectators nearby, I survived and had some what of a good time.  But I will say, I don’t think I will do it again unless I really have to.  Its just not Camille, its not essence.
