      Today I got official confirmation: I am heading to Timisoara in Romania.  I received an email from the coordinator saying that everything was put in place.  Now there's no looking back.  I doubt this will be updated much until I go for my training conference, but at least something is started.  La revedere!

      This doesn't have to do with Romania but I can claim bragging rights anyways.&nbsp; My friend  urlLink BJ  who is a pilot took me flying last night.&nbsp; Literally.&nbsp; He let me fly his plane.&nbsp; I flew over the city and the golf course where I knew my mother was playing.&nbsp; She didn't see me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, it's something to cross off "the list".&nbsp; I have now flown an airplane.

      "If life in Romania does not have the easygoing affluence of neighbouring Yugoslavia, it far surpasses in the amenities the best Soviet Union is able to offer for years to come.  The story is told that at a party in Bucharest during a recent international medical congress, a Soviet doctor accosted an American.  'Tell me, sir,' the Russian demanded, with a boldness supplied by several vodkas, 'do you not think we Russians will soon overtake the United States in living standards?'  'Well,' answered the American, more adroit at this sort of repartee than is sometimes the case, 'it seems to me, sir, that you'll have to overtake the Romanians first.'  The Russian, so the response goes, flushed; the American chortled, and - this is the point of the story - the Romanians chortled too."    - The Balkans , Life World Library

      I stopped by the used bookstore&nbsp;and checked out the travel books section.&nbsp; I found a 1967 Time Life book on the Balkans.&nbsp; The undestroyed bridge of Mostar is on the cover.&nbsp; Tito and Ceausescu are still alive.&nbsp; The world is still in a state anti-Communist hysteria. &nbsp; I'm sure I'll have some nice vintage quotes to put up later on.

      Two of my good friends from my IR graduating class recently returned from Romania.&nbsp; Koren used to live there for a few years as a child and decided to return for a couple of months after graduation.&nbsp; Our friend Jo went with her.&nbsp; I've been pestering them for information about what to expect while over there.&nbsp; Jo wrote me a lovely long letter which I'm going to paste here for everyone to read. &nbsp; Hi there, I'm on Canadian soil again, a little groggy from so much flying but happy to be back... despite the fact that I miss Romania quite a bit. I'm so glad I experienced that place. It was the first time I have ever felt justifiably unsafe. As you know, Romania has a very poor population, as a result everyone is trying to get an edge in any way they can. Robbery and assult are common, and nobody trusts anyone else. Everywhere I went I was clutching my purse, watching my pockets, wondering who was behind me and what their intentions were.  &nbsp; When Koren and I first arrived we were behaving like Canadians, we would be walking through the streets smiling or saying hello (buna) to people who passed by. Our friend Toni (Romanian working as a securityguard on the CANDU townsite) quickly advised us not to, smiling at strangers indicates that you want something from them or they can get something from you, remain stonefaced unless you know someone. It was probaby to the credit of Toni that we weren't assulted on the trip.  &nbsp; We met Toni our first night in town, he said he would take us out to the discos so we got Canadian references for him ('cause ya can't trust anyone) who said he was legit. For the rest of the trip Toni acted as our bodyguard. Koren and I looked different so we got alot of attention. Toni would come out to the disco with us, drink no more than 2 beer and just watch to make sure no one looked at us the wrong way. If we went to the washroom he would come and stand outside, all business. There are alot of pimps in Cernavoda, there is good money in that business which is hard to find in Romania, one night we were at an outdoor bar, Toni was very nervous the whole time, wouldn't let us go to the washroom even though it was within eyeshot, eventually he moved us inside because apparently some pimps were talking about Koren and me. Had we gone to the washroom alone we could have been druged and taken to a Turkish street corner before we knew it. Its happened before, many times. A trustworthy male friend is invaluable to women in Romania, otherwise many won't go out at night.  &nbsp; One night I was thinking about how vulnerable I was feeling, I wasn't sure if it was because I was a foreign female or just because I was female, so I asked some of my Romanian girlfriends. I asked them if it was very dangerous to be a woman in Romania, before I could even get the words out they were nodding their heads. Romania is still very chauvanistic, women have a defined place and laws about sexual harassment have not been impliented in most of Romania, you mix that with the poverty I've already mentioned that drives people to crime and what you get is a very volitile region for women. After we finished discussing this my friend Leylla, a Romanian woman raised in Cernavoda asked me to accompany her to the washroom because she was scared to go alone.  &nbsp; The living wage is very low there. Toni lives with his sick mother and makes 100$ a month, here is an example of the purchasing power of his wage. Koren and I went shopping with Linda (family friend) on this average grocery shop (just the basics)&nbsp;to feed her and her husband Linda spent 2000,000 Lei (about 80$) Toni would have to work for a month merely raise that much money. However, he cannot spend that money just on a 2000000Lei grocery shop to feed him and his mother, he has rent and bills to pay as well.  &nbsp; The wage for upperlevel positions isn't much better, doctors and police officers only make 200$ a month. This minimal wage leads to extensive bribery, a 20$ bill will get you anywhere. This is really frightening, people cannot depend on a legal system to rectify a wrong that is done to them. This is something I have really come to appriciate in Canada, a justice system I can trust. If I am assulted I know that I can go to a legal establishment, describe the person to them and they will at least try and bring that person to justice, anyone who does wrong to me will be punnished. This provides a security for Canadians that you don't even realize is there until you think of what it would be like without it.  &nbsp; There is also a widespread lack of confidence in government. Ilisecu (current Pres.) was actually in Ceausescu's cabinet, all the old commi boys are still around and, according to my friend Danni, the new generation won't be confident in gov until they are gone. I'm not so convinced though. There is deeply rooted corruption in Romania which gov is benefiting from and getting rich off of, they are certainly not going to change what is serving them. The next generation of politicians will be the rich as well because poor people can't afford the costs of politics. It is most likely that their wealth is at least in part the result of the same corruption and so how likely is it that they will change anything. What Romania needs right now is a single, wealthy, honest politician who is dedicated to reformoing the system and removing all the bureaucratic redtape. I think these same politicians could keep Romania out of the EU. I'm not convinced that those at the top are particualrly interested in the checks and balances that come with EU participation.  Their interest in the rampent corruption may prevent EU entry.  &nbsp; One visit that really hit me was to the orphanage in Cernavoda. The orphanage has kids from infancy to 18 but eventually the kids start being transfered to another residence about 100 feet away to live and attend school. When Koren and I first arrived we ended up at the residence and school. The manager (Ben, great guy from UK) wasn't there yet but a 10 yr old kid who spoke excellent english greeted us and offered to show us around. This kid was fantastic, energertic, personable, articulate, so were the other 13 kids we met there. Very happy and welcoming.  &nbsp; About an hour later Ben arrived and offered to take us to the orphanage, on the walk down Koren and I learned that all those kids had HIV. I may as well have been punched in the chest, all those great kids are not only without families but they are going to die before the age of 25. You probably know this already but, during the commi era HIV went unacknowledged in Romania, it was a western problem that communists didn't have, therefore nothing was done about it. On top of that, when it was found that most of the children in Romania's orphanages were anemic the gov ordered blood transfusions for them, of course, the blood was not properly sanitized and the majority of the kids got HIV. These were some of those kids.  &nbsp; The orphanage was a dark, pooorly ventilated commi building. 50 kids, horribly understaffed. They get nurse volunteers from an NGO in Scotland who are wonderful with the kids but according to Ben the care there is generally bad. Roamnian women ahve a very rough way of "caring" for the kids. While we were there we&nbsp;say kids being dragged down halls by the arm and slapped for bad behaviour. Cre in this place means shoving 15 kids in a room&nbsp;with a woman standing at the door to ensure the kids can't get out. Very little one on one care which these kids need.&nbsp;Many if not most are quite handicapped,&nbsp;many of the kids even have families in Cernavoda but they were placed in the orphanage because the family couldn't afford to care for a disbaled kid. There are others who are in fine condition but cannot walk because they've been placed in their cribs for so long. This was such an upsetting sight. These kids need to be held and cared for and shown that somebody cares whether or not they're alive, and they aren't getting it there right now.

      My travel agent called me this morning. I now have 95% finalised my travel plans. I leave for Romania via Montreal and Vienna on the 18th. I arrive in Timisoara on the 19th at 3:35  pm. This is fabulous news.   If anyone needs to make travel plans, please talk to the amazing Tamara at Travel Cuts. She's a goddess.   Now all I have to do is decide on my Montreal stop-over. I can:  a) leave at 7:00 am and spend the whole day in Montreal.  b) arrive in the evening and make my connecting flight.  c) arrive the day before and stay with another intern.   Decisions, decisions... Anyone who knows me knows this is not my forte. I think two of the Montreal interns will have already left by this point. However, I'd really appreciate meeting the other two for drinks or whatnot. And I've never been to Montreal.

       I knew I would have to face this sooner or later. Today I braved step one of my Romanian visa application.   Normally, this is quick and painless. When I went to Sweden, I filled&nbsp; in a form, sent it off with my passport and a cheque and was promptly&nbsp; mailed back my visa. France was even easier: a quicktrip downtown and&nbsp; $70 took care of everything.   I don't know how many times I called the Romanian representative in my city. There was never any answer. You'd think he would have voice mail or the like.   Ok, onto step two: I called the embassy in Ottawa. No answer. Great. Why should they make this easy for us? Like anyone actually wants to visit Romania. Yes, I'm bitter.   Incidentally, during this whole ordeal, I was chatting on MSN with Maud, the intern going to Bucharest.&nbsp; I told her I was going to call the consulate in Montreal. She informed me that she was there that morning and that she was amazed by its disorganisation. Lovely. I called and  and when a man answered the phone, I explained in French that I would be requiring a visa for my internship. He must have mistaken my English accent for Romanian because he replied in a stream of Romanian. "Wait! Wait! I'm English!" "Vous preferez parler en francais?" "Oui, oui, s'il vous plait." Ok, no problem. I have a minor in French. I can do this!   The guy had no clue what was going on at all. You'd think that the representative at the consulate would have a vague idea of...say...how someone should acquire a visa? He kept having to check with some invisible woman standing behind him to clarify what he was telling me. Should I really Fed-Ex my passport to some guy who didn't even know that I needed an application form?   He told me to come in Monday morning where we could discuss this further. "C'est impossible. Je n'habite pas a Montreal!" "Mais Mlle. Maud, tu etais ici ce matin" "Non, je m'appelle Karla. Maud est une copine. Elle fait la meme programme que moi, mais elle ira a Bucharest et j'irai aTimisoara." Incidentally, I was talking to Maud at the same time on MSN. Small world, huh? We must be the only eastern Canadians applying for visas.   We hung up and I tried an alternate number for the Ottawa embassy. A man answered and after I went through my spiel about needing a visa, he told me that the secretary was out and that I'd have to call back Monday. "Bye bye" *click*.   Great. So this means that I have no:  a) visa  b) fixed travel plans  c) idea of what I'm getting into   What *am* I getting into?

      I got my first of three series of shots this afternoon.  I alternately felt like: (a) a patient in a psych ward who needed to be sedated (b) a six year old getting immunised against all the ills of the world (believe me...the world would be a healthier place if we didn't insist on protecting kids against every germ in the universe)  I paid $50 to listen to a travel nurse tell me to not drink the local water, use protection when sleeping with the enemy and to not eat food from a street vendor, as well as read from a report she found online warning me not to trade money on the street.  Oh, and to stick three needles in my arm.  I had no idea how deep you have to stick those suckers in.  It'll be a miracle if I survive the next round.  Looking on the bright side, at least I don't have to take the Malaria pills like Kat.  Incidentally, I'm now protected against Hep A, B, Typhoid, Tetanus, Diphtheria, Measles, Polio, Mumps, the three and four year old strains of Influenza and who knows what else.  My arm is killing me now (thanks Mr. Tetanus!).  This better be covered by Blue Cross.

      I spent the weekend with a friend of mine, who is Greek.  I mentioned to her mother about my internship.  "Romania?  That's where the gypsies come from!  You shouldn't be going over there!  There are gypsies!"  You should have seen the look of horror on her face when I told her that one of my organisation's projects was to integrate the Roma (gypsies) into Romanian culture.    "The gypsies will steal the teeth out of your head!" "The IIT is working to counteract this negative impression of the Roma." "Roma?" "Yeah...that's what they want to be called.  Like 'Inuit' instead of 'Eskimos'." "You watch out for those...those...gypsies.  They'll steal the teeth from your head!" "I think that's a slight exageration.  This is like a vicious circle.  You see the same thing with the First Nations here." "I was almost lured into a gypsy camp when I was younger...good thing I was rescued before it was too late.  I would never have been found again.  You better listen to me: watch out!  You should never trust a gypsy." "Roma."  Old stereotypes die hard, I guess.

      I just got back from my training session for my internship.  I met the other 13 interns who will be joining me on this programme.  Most of us will be in the Balkans with the exception of Kat in The Gambia and Marc and Per in Bangladesh.  You know those dumb advertisements you see in magazines and on TV "Meet Tomorrow's Leaders"?  That's exactly what this was.  Our coordinator described us as "the best of the best" (and yes, I'm going to write this because I'm sure the only people who will be reading this are the other interns themselves).  I was intimidated to be with such a group of people but we quickly became friends.  So is this what human rights are all about?  14 of us in cramped quarters, no air conditioning, wretched weather, perpetual bad hair days and living with people whom you've just met yet feel like you've known forever.  For once, it was nice to talk with others of similar backgrounds about democracy, racism and governance without reverting to tree-hugging hippie ramblings.  Of course, our nightly debates were fueled by copious amounts of liquor and I developped a particular affinity for Jack (as in Daniels) [Thanks Marc!].  Kat's right: Keith's should be sponsoring our next get-together.  I was able to cry on someone's shoulder without feeling like an idiot and talk about wanting to change the world and having him agree with me.  I left the week with inspiration that people truly can make a difference.  We're all going to prestigious organisations where we will have the chance to contribute, help and learn a little about the world and a lot about ourselves and what we can do.  We all agree that there's something special about the group and I know we'll meet again....even if I have to buy every lottery ticket in Canada to make sure it happens.

       urlLink The story of two boys who dream about opening a lemonade stand when a strange thing happens...Their dream gets stuck in Liberaland!    "Help! Mom! There Are Liberals Under My Bed! A Small Lesson in Conservatism" is a wonderful way to teach young children the valuable lessons of conservatism. In simple text, parents and children follow Tommy and Lou on their quest to earn money for a swing set their parents cannot afford.      As their dream gets stuck in Liberaland, Tommy and Lou’s lemonade stand is hit with many obstacles. Liberals keep appearing from behind their lemon tree, taking half of their money in taxes, forbidding them to hang a picture of Jesus atop their stand, and making them give broccoli with each glass sold.      Law after law instituted by the press-hungry liberals finally results in the liberals taking over Tommy and Lou’s stand and offering sour lemonade at astronomical prices to the customers.   Riiiiiiiight.  Incidentally, one can also purchase: *Conservatives are from Mars (Liberals are from San Francisco) *Liberwocky:  What Liberals Say and What They Really Mean

      Mom came home and found several frantic messages from the Romanian embassy on the phone.  Apparently, the representative was not able to get the required signature.  So, she is Fed-Exing everything back, including my passport.  I can enter the country with only my passport.  Then, I have to go to the police station in Timisoara with all my (English) documentation and have them give me a form.  Am I optimistic?  Hell no.  At least I get my $105.00 money order back (if I can find the receipt).  I'm still out $25.00 for the shipping.  Oh...and I have to pay for the shipping back to me.  So, I wasted $50.00 for nothing.  Oh, and why couldn't the embassy have told me this *before* I went to all the trouble of getting everything together on time?  I could have walked into the police station when I arrived and did everything there.

      I finally was able to talk to David on the phone. He worked at the IIT this summer and was able to assuage my fears about the people, the organisation and the area. He told me that everyone is very nice but not to go out alone after dark.  What I learned:  a) My apartment is in a quiet residential area, about a 25 minute walk from downtown b) His apartment has prostitutes and pimps outside, not to mention bad 1970s shag carpet c) Another intern had an apartment on the main floor of a building. Someone tried to break in. She called the cops and they told her to hit the intruder over the head with a frying pan d) The current hot look in Romania is the "Paris Hilton" look, where girls wear skirts that would put her to shame e) Everyone at the centre is super nice and anxious to practice their English. I hope they'll help me learn Romanian  One more week. One more week. One more week.

        urlLink Romanian police is going to ban ladies over 60 years old to sunbathe at beaches topless    The police states that this "ugly show" distracts tourists.  The police in Constanta County famous with its sand beaches on the Black Sea coast, constantly receives  complaints from people having holidays, about elderly ladies who demonstrate their wrinkled breasts to people while sunbathing, with no shame.   "Sunbathing topless has its age restrictions, and elderly ladies ought to understand this", said Chief of local police Victor Polesku. The policemen patrolling beaches say they are sick and tired of the busts of elderly females who filled the beaches.   "It is always pleasant to see young women sunbathing topless, provided that the women are attractive. But ironically, mainly elderly ladies sunbathe topless. This looks disgusting", says officer Ionut Polesku patrolling the beach in Constanta.

      Of course, I'm already planning where I'll travel.  Gives me something to do while waiting in supermarket checkout lines.  I'll probably stay away from the Ukraine as a sweet, innocent Canadian girl like me (my coworker just laughed and said "yeah, right") will probably be a prime target. I *do* want to go to Moldova though. 99% of the population can't even find it on a map (it's east of Romania) and it's Europe's poorest country. I need a visa, but think of the postcards I can send! And the wine I can drink/bring back (their two big exports are wine and watermelons).  And the coolest part of Moldova is... ... urlLink Trandsniestr . It's basically a semi-autonomous breakaway region in the east that still claims allegiance to the USSR. It's here that you'll find busts of Lenin in every courtyard. They have a military, postal system and currency (worthless). No other nation will acknowledge it or confirm its existance. I need a visa as well, which can cost $0.03, $3.00 or maybe just a bottle of alcohol and a few cigarettes.  "The type of separatist government of Transnistria is largely a dictatorship and the personal rights record of the people is very poor. The 2001 presidential elections were not free, parties and publications being banned just before the elections. The results were rigged, as in some regions it was reported that Igor Smirnov collected 103.6 percent of the votes."  Besides...they have a city called 'Bender'. How cool is that? If any Futurama fans want a postcard, let me know.

      I finally got in contact with Aneta, a classmate from Bulgaria.  I got some more great tips:  (I'm starting to feel a bit like John Cusak in High Fidelity with all these lists)  (a)Bring lice shampoo, as the Roma aren't as clean as the rest of society (b)I can only use cash (no Visa) (c)Bring water filters (I think I'll just buy/boil my water.  I doubt they have Britas in Romania)  Lice?  Lice!  Yuck!  I thought I was past that risk once I hit grade 2!  And I thought the threat of ticks were bad.  A lice shampoo shopping I shall I go.

      Yes, it's gone around, but it never fails to make me giggle.  Will he choose rock?  Or paper?  Or scissors?   urlLink YOU DON'T KNOW!!!!!

      I'm madly trying to get some reading done before I leave. Books are too heavy to bring too many.  After a brief shopping spree at Chapters, I bought:  urlLink (a)  A Bed for the Night : Humanitarianism in Crisis, by David Rieff  urlLink (b)  The Coming Anarchy: Shattering the Dreams of the Post Cold War , by Robert D. Kaplan  urlLink (c)  The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order, by Samuel P. Huntington  urlLink (d) Dude, Where's my Country? by Michael Moore  Most can be applied to human rights work in the Balkans. I wonder if I can write them off as a business expense?  I flipped through the Michael Moore book. It's not as good as Stupid White Men. Actually, I found it tedious, put it down on page 46 and haven't touched it since. I'm glad he's getting people to question their government (as everyone should) but he should just lay low for a while.  The Coming Anarchy seems quite good. I ordered the author's Balkan Ghosts last week, which hopefully should be arriving any day now. Part travel log, part journalism and part internationalo relations commentary, I've found it impossible to put down. Makes me feel guilty for ignoring Africa all this time.   I have also acquired  urlLink (e) What Liberal Media? The Truth About Bias and the News by Eric Alterman. I got it for my stepfather, thinking it would be an antidote to Fox News. He didn't want it so it migrated to my collection.  On another point, Britney Spear's new perfume/ad campaign is being released soon. It's called 'Curious'. According to my friend  urlLink Greg , she wouldn't be so curious if she had finished school. Or read these books.

      With a little over one week to go, the self-doubts are creeping in. I just sent off a mass email a minute ago describing this whole process of preparing for Romania. I realise that the majority of the recipients (mainly university friends and staff) will wonder what the hell I'm doing going off to the Wild East of Europe. Sure, I was voted "Most likely to have several 'International Relations' and have her memoirs top the best sellers list" but that was referring to my love of European travel (and men). I've never been particularly known on campus for my bleeding heart. Sure, I'd spend the day helping a classmate recover a corrupted file on a diskette, but I chose to do theatre and the Sackville Movie Project over the Yellow Ribbon Society. I even mocked the "I stand for Human Rights" and "Say nay to the FTAA" people.  I didn't do honours, nor did I have the highest average. Why me? I'm sure that's what everyone else is asking too.  Granted, I was raised by a single mother who taught me I had to fight for what is right. I remember volunteering for Eco-Action and Support for Single Mothers back before I knew what volunteer work was. I learned that everyone should give back to society in whatever way they can.  "I stand for human rights" (Students spent the entire day standing up to protest human rights abuses).  What does that accomplish?  Yes, it raises awareness.  However, it's merely a gimmick.  In all honesty, what does standing up in a home-made tshirt do?  Nothing.  It's all fine and dandy to talk about it, but how about you *do* something about it?  Or do you just go home and feel satisfied that you did your part by standing up all day?  A good friend Susana wrote an  urlLink article  on the Youth Partnership with Jamaica which I will never forget.  I don't want to sound self-important. I'm not. It's a trait I detest in others. I think global awareness is a very noble quality to have. I just wish people wanting to make changes would actually go about helping to make changes instead of standing up all day, feeling satisfied that they helped make the world a better place and then going home to sleep.

      I'm trying to track everyone down to say goodbye. It doesn't feel like I'm even leaving. I'm sure that on August 16th, it'll seem like an ordinary day. "OH MY GOD AREN'T YOU EXCITED!?!?!?!?" "Umm...what? Oh, yeah, that's right. I'm leaving tomorrow. Well, I guess so."  I saw my friend Jana last night, who came down from Halifax. Her parents have sold their house so I stupidly felt like I had to say goodbye to that too. We sat around drinking Bailey's and watching a good Canadian classic: Trailer Park Boys. Luckily, this was the episode featuring Rita McNeil (the only reason why I would watch this  urlLink show  in the first place). For the uninitiated,  urlLink Rita  is a very large yet very talented Eastern Canadian singer. It was hillarious to watch her being forced to help harvest marijuana plants.  There're so many people I'm going to miss seeing for the last time (Karla, you *will* be back). That's the problem with university: you make friends from all over the world and when school is done, everyone goes back home. Problem is that everyone has left *my* "home" for greener pastures.  I'm off to Fredericton tonight. My friend Tim has graciously invited me up to stay with him for the weekend. I can expect a vacation of music, ice cream, good company and a change of scenery. We were good friends at university through our classes and work so I'm excited to see him again before I leave.

      I'm all done my shots.  I am now immune to every disease which afflicts mankind (except rabies and tick-bourne encephelitis).  This of course permits me to have wild, promiscuous unprotected sex, take lots of illegal injectable drugs and play with stray dogs with no ill effects.  Just kidding.  I just have to stay on guard.  No "Here, puppy puppy puppy!", no going into forests without full protection gear and no eating food from street vendors.  Oh, and I also have to disinfect every bottle I drink from or use a straw.  I think I got off fairly lightly compared to the interns in Bangladesh.  Marc and Per have to contend with:  "Water-borne diseases and respiratory infections increase during monsoon season (June to October), particularly in the flood zone. 40% of Dhaka city is inundated. The city water supply is polluted as the sewage system has broken down and the risk of spread of water borne disease is very high. Incidentally the risk of being affected by dengue fever and other insect borne diseases has also increased considerably.  Medical facilities are poor. Medical evacuations to Bangkok or Singapore are often required for serious conditions. Doctors and hospitals may expect immediate cash payment for health services."

      My visa has been approved by the Romanian embassy.  It's now being sent to the Minister of the Interior (whatever that is) to be signed.  I should "probably" have it in time to leave, according to the embassy.  I hope "probably" refers to sometime before August 17th.

      I am cursed.  Cursed cursed cursed.  I mailed everything off on Saturday morning to the embassy.  I paid for the 2-3 day Express Delivery via Canada Post (which costs more than my soul).  The girl said that she could not guarantee its delivery to Ottawa on Monday as it was a holiday here in the Maritimes.  She guaranteed that it would arrive at the embassy on Tuesday.  Fast forward three days.  The package still hasn't arrived.  An angry call to Canada Post tells us that due to the holiday, the earliest we can expect its arrival is Thursday.  THURSDAY!  I'm leaving two weeks from yesterday!  My boss has rearranged his schedule to meet me at the airport.  I have plans in Montreal.    I hope this isn't a precursor for what's to come once I arrive in Europe.

      After a long rant to a coworker about the red tape involved in getting a Romanian visa, she asked innocently "If you're having this much trouble with a Visa, why don't you just get a Mastercard?"
