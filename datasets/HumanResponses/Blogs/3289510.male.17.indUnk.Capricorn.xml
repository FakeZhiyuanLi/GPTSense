      i have learned very much in webmastering. i think that i can make a desent or cool website with the skills that i have Acquire. when i came in i did not know what it takes to make a website.  i have learned how to attach files to my e-mails and still ad a message. now i know how to do a hyperlink and hypertext. i can now put a picture of whatever i want in my website background.  now i can help out other people with their websites. now when i visit a website i will no longer say or think that its stupid because learning this webmastering lessons are kind of hard to learn. now i know how to use anchor tags and i know the meaning of http plus html.

      Well, many people like to talk smack, but when you confront them they don't do anything. Well in another note my friend and i were playing airsoft guns, when all the sudden two neon cars pulled up. Then the unthinkable happened.   There was like four people in each car and they shot at us with some bbs. I could not believe what i was witnesing but i tackled my friend down and stayed on the ground. i wrote down the license plates from one of the neon cars.   I just wrote it in the sand the fist digits and then i memorized the rest. I called the cops and they took the guns away from them. The other car was stolen and their own "homeboys" told on them.   They some how shot my friend in the leg but the bb had bounced off something and then hit my friend. For a sixteen year old he is a cry baby. I had to kick him a few times to get him to get up.  Well it turns out one of the cars was stolen and some of the guys got arrested. In some way im a hero! Well my friend is okay but i make fun of him big time for what he did.  Well, i was really suprized in the attemp to get back at them. Im glad that i called the cops. I just keep thinking of the feelings of the carjacker's victims.  I have learned a valueable lesson because tragedy can strike anywhere at anytime. i have also learned that my friend is really weird because he cried. I cant beleive it because his brother has been shot with a real bband he never did cry and his nine or ten years of age.   Well, thats all and stay tuned for more post.

      well my name is serge and my favorite rock band is Linkin park. for fun I like to play target practice with my spring gun. I really like video games but im starting to dislike them.   I get really irritated when people talk mess. I also like to say the word dude, and i was awarded the man with a 1000 questions at my school. I like biology because i get to learn about cytoplasm within a human cell.   well I like nature because the animals in the wild are really amazing. Im mostly interested about sharks, octopuses, squids and many more animals.I realy like to listen to the radio station called 94.5 the buzz, because they have the best music.
