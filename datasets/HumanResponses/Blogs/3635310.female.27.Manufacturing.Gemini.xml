      Last night was the Halloween party. Christen and I dressed as matching school girls. I haven't laughed that hard in a very long time.  Jeff had come to visit at the last minute to get some attention, which I was glad to give.  After the parties we came home, I was enjoying so deeply having him around.   I got up the nerve to ask him to be my boyfriend. It was as if I had regressed 10 years, back to early high school. My vocabulary cut in half, shaking and nervous... All my rules out the window, I jumped in headlong.

      I saw my first mouse in the subway the other day. It was so small and quick. I was all psyched up to see some big honkin' rat like thing. But it was just a mouse, and it was playing right underneath the sign that warned of rodenticide (didn't know that was a word).   I have daydreams of saving people's lives or possessions on the subway. Once, while I was holding one of those vertical poles that go from floor to ceiling, I realized that I could also reach one of the overheads, horizontal poles with my left hand. I pictured myself swinging from the rails, anchored by my strong ninja grip and pure willpower. There would then be some sort of mid-air kick and destroy mission, and then a return to peaceful and ordinary traveling. Bad guys watch out!

      AUTHOR: William Shakespeare (1564–1616)   QUOTATION: Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot that it do singe yourself.   ATTRIBUTION: King Henry VIII. Act i. Sc. 1.   After having an apartment for a few weeks, it is finally habitable! We have heat! I never realized how much I could get my hopes up about being able to sleep in my apartment finally. But now that it's possible I am overjoyed. Then there are the dozens of people I see every day in the subways and on the streets who know what it means to be cold. I hope they stay warm, and I hope they aren't insulted when I give them a banana.

      First day back at work after so many days away of moving. Being transient seems to be my current state, everything is unsettled and up in the air. At least it HAS been. First the roller coaster of trying to find an apartment in Brooklyn with Sarah and not go broke in the process, then the actual moving in, all those boxes, so much paper, so much dirt... Everything gets so dirty.   I am so proud of Jeff and I. We had been together 24 hours a day for the past two weeks, through both of our moves, through 18" of snow in NYC, both of us being sick and very exhausted & grumpy. Not one fight! (unless you count me flipping out about how he left the bathroom floor all wet after his shower ;). Thanks for putting up with me Jeff. Did I mention that I LOVE animal crackers?!  The most amazing part of all these past few weeks (besides the wonderful family Christmas, the chance to see Jesse and Cory at home again, meeting Jeff's family for the first time) was the Buena Vista Social Club concert! My life changes every time I hear the music, and now I have seen them in person, heard their sounds, seen their amazingly playful and powerful manner. It was wonderful; it has been a wonderful New Year already!

      Work has been so busy lately. It's spooky that I can type faster than I can write or think, for that matter. This is just another reminder of how wired I am, how fast paced and obsessive I get about efficiency and redundancy. This is a great "feature" to my personality, but knocks me off balance if I have no pull in the opposite direction.   I felt that walking up the 11 flights of stairs to work this morning (one of the elevators was broken and I didn't feel like waiting)... I couldn't bare to waste my time waiting for one of the working elevators to arrive, so I put myself through this nauseatingly physically draining (albeit wonder-woman healthy) experience just to avoid a wait. I was curious why I just didn't wait; it probably took longer for my out-of-shape legs to propel me up the stairs than it would have to wait for the elevator. The point was that I felt productive walking up the stairs. I felt progress. Why such a need for progress? It permeates everything I do, and helps me to get ahead, keep moving, stay focused, progress, and progress. Staying still makes my skin crawl.   There is a danger in all this. Do I strive for things because of my obsessions, or do I really feel fulfilled when I reach a goal? In terms of more emotional pursuits, it's hard to back off and go at things naturally sometimes because I find myself judging things on the same scale as my professional life. But now I am feeling super healthy after my stair climb this morning, and inspired to check out that karate class near home. I think starting up with that again from scratch at a new school will be a greatly needed, humbling way to check myself before I wreck myself. 'Nuff respect due to Ice Cube...

      Lately I have been craving a hotdog. Not just any hotdog, but a NYC street hotdog from one of those nomadic vendors on the corner. This (with my stomach) is like bungee jumping with no tether. Sometimes I just need things that are no good for me.   Lauryn Hill on the Essence awards last night, her hair short and dressed so quietly: just her and her guitar on the stage. I got goose bumps listening "what we gonna do now?" she is so amazing. So strong. She is a hero of mine.

      Ellie wants me to write more, so I have decided to make an effort to try. I feel very reserved because so many family members and friends read this site (who am I kidding, I shouldn't flatter myself), but I do know that two important people do regularly... Jessica and Ellie, and even if just those two read - I guess I AM flattered.  Today I am proud of how I have been eating. For breakfast I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich (actually that was at about 5AM this morning when I woke up and I was starving cause it was too hot to eat last night. Then I had part of a bagel with cream cheese (bad) but then for lunch I had a very sensible chicken sandwich (and a chocolate chip cookie - bad). So maybe I'm not so proud :) - At least I'm not eating fistfuls of chocolate from the nice ladies in the front of the office. That was last week.   I have been printing out lists of galleries and instructions for submitting work for display. As soon as I actually think of starting the process of dropping off my work I get paralyzed. I can't seem to get past that point. I have a major self-confidence crisis. MAJOR. Got to work through it.

      I definitely ate too many Hershey's kisses today - well actually they were Hershey's hugs, but either way I ate too many. I did good for lunch though. I ate half of a turkey sandwich with lettuce on focaccia. I've also been trying to snack on these wheat crackers. They actually aren't so bad.  I've been adding more pictures to my collection online. It's fun. There are some very nice ones of Jeff up there. Please check them out, send me an  urlLink e-mail  with any comments and I might add them to my website.

      Had my review today, it went well. Ate a chicken parmesan sammich, it was a 5 out of 10. Had chunks of vegetables in it, so that's a big point deduction right there. I survived Karate and only hurt for a few days. I didn't go back right away because I was feeling very sick to my stomache and that's never a good way for me to exercise. I want to take things easy at first. So I plan to go again tonight.

      I've updated my photos section by having some  urlLink great friends  make me a website dedicated to my photography. Please visit.   It's Tuesday and I am really busy at work. For the past few weeks I have been making a scrapbook in my spare time at home. It's really been fun. I've always paid so much attention to trying to get my "artistic" photography together that my snapshots through the years got neglected. Having one big binder to go to and flip through to see all my friends through the years is a great distraction. Now If I can survive the first night of Karate tonight...

      It's Friday and I am ready for the weekend. I did a lot of walking yesterday (had to walk to the dentist). So I've got to get my bottom two wisdom teeth out and I'm actually looking forward to it as much as that's possible. The Dentist said that I will keep having chronic problems with them until I get them out, but after that they won't hurt anymore and I will feel a whole lot better. So if anyone has any advice or stories, please feel free to tag me.

      OK, so I went to Cactus Jacks for my birthday dinner and just when I thought we were going to leave, all the waiters came and sang me happy birthday. I got a piece of tiramisu with a candle in it (cause Jeff told them no cheesecake, bad for my tummy) and I had to wear a sombrero. Now I have carried on the tradition of wearing silly hats on my birthdays and getting a Polaroid taken. I'll have to scan the picture and put it online.

      Wow, this morning I got up and I was feeling kindof crappy because it's my birthday and honestly, nothing can compare to when you are a kid and have those big parties where all the people come over and have to give you presents even if they don't like you :). I never minded being treated like a queen for a day (even if I tend to drag that out for more like a week than a day)... But anyway, I woke up feeling crappy but then I got some great greetings from friends, even ones I haven't heard from in a long time ( ;) Jim) and that really brightened up my day. SO thanks guys. My day has changed for the better, and it's always great to hear from you.

      It's Monday and I had to get up at 5:45 AM this morning which was terrible!!! I am NOT a morning person, and if it hadn't been for the fact that I wanted to start my physical therapy appointments for my back as soon as possible I would have slept right through everything. I am glad that my gym has a PT office though, and it's covered by my health care which is even better. Now they can give me a plan to work out and I won't end up hurting anything, and will be more likely to stick with a routine. I actually don't mind getting up to get the 7:20 train, but 5:45 AM - this can NEVER happen again!

      Today is cory's birthday. I just have to say that he is great! I'm about to call him up and sing happy birthday to him (off key) and try to embarrass him, but he's probably still sleeping. He's 17. Wow, that makes me... old (hehe).

      OK, so I didn't include my brother atermis is my list of important people who read my site. Now I will  urlLink click here to read him putting me in my place . He does have a point about that guy who asked about the rodenticide posters. Hello Rodenticide guy if you're out there.  I had a great 4th of July vacation, had lobster for the first time, and visited some very nice towns on the way there and back. Pictures will be coming soon so keep coming back.

      I got a trim yesterday but it just looks like a big poofy mess because of the rain today. I couldn't find my umbrella so I had to walk to the train without one, but I bought one at grand central, so I wouldn't have to walk to work in the rain.   The VMA's are today right down the street. Yesterday afternoon that girl Avril something or other was singing that "popular" song over and over again. They have a stage set up across the street from Radio City, and we can hear it all the way over here like someone had their radio on really loud. It's kindof awe inspiring that all of these people will be right down the street, all those egos and thousands of dollars a person to dress them up. Is it worth it? It will be raining anyway, I wonder how they all manage that.  I am signing off for a few days, but will return with relaxation and pictures to share. Enjoy your holiday.

      Things to do: - start writing personal statement for grad school application - pay dmv - stop eating ice cream :) - study for GRE's (yuk)  I'm sure there's more, I'll write again later...  So it's 11:54 and I already had some ice cream, I think just writing about it made me want some. I'm going to get my hair trimmed today because I am so bored. I guess it needs it anyway.  So we are going on a very short vacation this weekend. I can't wait to go and be near the water and relax and take a whole bunch of pictures. I wish I could stay longer than one night but it's really expensive so we'll make the most of the two days and one night away from home. I can't wait!

        My teeth feel soooo much better. Phew! Vicki I feel so bad for you about your root canal! I hear those are terrible. I'll be thinking happy thoughts for your speedy recovery (even though it's been 3 weeks already, jeesh).  We went for a walk yesterday and on the way back there was a deer right ahead of us, so like two little detectives we tried to sneak closer and closer to it so that we could get a better look. Were were pretty close at one point, but then it spotted a dog up ahead and hid in the trees. That was really a treat. I also ate those new mint flavored oreos this weekend! Holy cow are they good! Too good. I also found a new favorite ice cream,  urlLink cool mint  by Dreamery.

      I wonder why I am so anti-social. Is it just that I am happier alone or is it something else? Is my family just so weird that I can't get used to anything else? Could it be that I am just happier at home with a book and relaxing and going to bed early?   ... and I wonder why I'm so bored all the time.

      Well I feel much better today, and I feel better mentally too. When I have nothing but time to sit and think, I can't seem to channel it into productive thoughts (especially when I think something's wrong with how my teeth are healing). But mentally I feel better. My brother brought me over a thermometer so I can make sure I don't have a fever, and they brought me over 2 small jellies and a wet nap from the diner one day. That was cute.  I have lost about 4 pounds since Saturday (can't complain since I've gained about 30 since I moved back to NY). But I'm also being more careful about what I eat, noting especially if the food is pointy in nature or prone to hurt my mouth. I have mostly been eating mashed potatoes, ensure, and corn muffin tops from stew leonards (which are great by the way).  It seems like the only way I could get my friends all to hang out again like college would be to have a huge party. Maybe I should start planning my birthday party now. My last birthday was so low key that I need to do something fun next year. I'll start thinking now. Let me know if you have any ideas.

      So yesterday I was sick all afternoon  into the evening. I guess the antibiotics or the painkillers were making me sick. I was starting to get really worried, but today I am feeling much better and I think yesterday was the worst of it. I have had a lot of time to think and get nervous about what was going wrong, but thank god Jeff was there. He's been so good to me, and my family has helped me feel good too. Boy can I complain :)!

      Yesterday I got my wisdom teeth out, all 4. All I remember is being nervous waiting for it to happen and then nothing after they stuck my arm with the anesthesia. I woke up in a nice little bed covered with a blanket, and having gauze all stuffed in my mouth. They brought Jeff in and he sat with me and I could sit up. The Dr. said that I have very dense bone, and that may be why I have a lot of pain, but that in later life I will be happy to have that (osteoporosis and all). Can't say I can see past the painkillers right now though. Just woke up to have some jello so I can take more painkiller and the antibiotics. They make me pukey.  On the whole though I'm just complaining for sympathy, it could have been a lot worse.  Good night.

      I've been writing down all my dreams (or trying to) because most of my photography comes from that, especially my digital works. Two of my ex-boyfriends have been visiting me constantly and I don't know what it means. They are the ones that I feel I have the most unfinished business with, but they always have some sort of role in my dreams. It would be nice to exorcise those demons (not that they are the devil), I can't seem to have a "normal" dream without one of them popping up.   Normal is a very relative term, however. Normal dreams for me have me waking up yelling and talking in my sleep, like all my action adventure dreams, or the ones where I find myself alone in a car on the passengers side having to drive or use the breaks on the drivers side, or the ones where my EX-BOYFRIENDS show up all the time!!!! Believe me it gets much more interesting than that... Maybe I'll let you know about my next dream, assuming I'm in the mood.

      Feels like a Monday today since I was home yesterday. Thanks  urlLink Marquito , but I still haven't found my wallet yet. I'm glad you had better luck than I have. It's alright though because I didn't have much in my wallet anyway, it's just a pain in the neck.  I have been trying to make up the sleep I lost this weekend driving back from Virginia late on Sunday night. I feel jetlagged, isn't that funny.

      OK, so my week is getting better (Tuesday was terrible). Thanks to  urlLink Susan  (another  urlLink NYC blogger ) who had some great advice about my couch! We ended up just having to remove some sheetrock from the wall and then the offending piece of wood just fell out; it's always a plus not to have to use a saw! I went to the Yankee Game last night! $7.25 for a beer $4 for a water... hot dogs and chicken fingers and fries, oh my! It was fun, and Jeter hit an awesome home run.   I had the strangest dreams last night.

      So this weekend I got bit my my neighbors cat, right on the right calf. I was minding my own business walking up my stairs and the damn thing came from behind and bit me, then ran away like a punk. It's bad enough that they leave cat food out on the back porch so that all our friendly ants can come and eat, but now thier cat has bit me?! This is ridiculous. Then to top it all off, the couch we've been waiting for for over six weeks doesn't fit into our apartment, no matter how we try. We'd have to saw down a  load bearing wall probably to get it in, and then there's no guarantee we could get it back out when we move. So this week already sucks and it's only Tuesday.

What do you do the moment you get home from work/school/errands?  Pee and then sit down on the couch.  3. What are your favorite aromatherapeutic smells?  Anything citrus, aveda has this blue oil that has an amazing smell, and eucalyptus.  4. Do you feel more relaxed with a group of friends or hanging out by yourself?  Actually, by myself. I always feel a sense of social pressure around others.  5. What is something that you feel is relaxing but most people don't?  Taking care of my Turtle.

      My turtle is doing well, but he is very shy. I took two pictures but they didn't come out very well. I call him buddy, and don't worry mom, I won't feed him cheese. It's been really hard to find a vet for Buddy. The one I had in mind is in the hospital "How ironic" my brother says. The only other one I can tell is about an hours drive away, so I'd rather have somewhere closer. If anyone knows of a good resource for turtle information please let me know. I have been on the web and bought a book, but I want to get my little guy checked out. Maybe I'll upload one of my crappy pictures of him just so you can see.

      So I got a turtle! I am very excited about this. It's very small right now, and I want to make sure that I take good care of him so I've bought a book and I have been looking on the web for all kinds of advice.  I've got him a good sized aquarium that is over 10X his size and there is an area where he can bask, and an area where he can swim. Now I just need a thermometer to make sure that he's staying warm enough and a filter so I don't have to change the water every other day. I will have pictures soon I promise.  Congratulations to Cindy and Jeff on their new baby girl Abigail Evelyn (8 lbs, 5 oz, 22 in).

       Good Morning everyone. It's Monday and it's rainy but some people have the day off so happy holidays or vacation for them! I had my Margarita party on Saturday with my parents and Cory and it was fun. I told them sombreros were optional.   Oh and it seems that my brother has some homework to do! Too bad you've had three days to do it, I have no pity for you 8p ! I fed you this weekend and you fell asleep cause you were so bored, how's that for a nice house guest (haha). I took some pictures of you so now you will be put on display!   I also took some pictures last week of Rockefeller Center and all the flags that they have up. It's quite a sight. Here's one for you to look at. There is great exhibit of photographs that I couldn't bring myself to look at too long this time last year. They are amazing, if you get a chance to see them, you should make the effort. Here is a link to the  urlLink book .

      I am really not feeling well right now. Today has been a good day, but I crashed around 2 and my rib has been bothering me a lot today. I took two tylenol but it's bothering me even worse now. I am getting paranoid now because someone at work has an ulcer and the symptoms are the same. I'm sorry that all I do is complain, but instead of getting even more frustrated, this distracts me. Now if this pain would just go away. :)

      Well I have been to Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Upstate NY all within the past week and it was great! I put up some new vacation pictures to the left, which show some of the wonderful views we got to see. It was so relaxing, even if it was a short vacation.  Then I headed right to Upstate for business and got to see some friends that I haven't seen in way to long! One night I even stayed up way past my bed-time :).    I'm happy to say that I walked to work the three days I was there (it was only 15 minutes each way) and that I went out more than I usually do when travelling. All in all it was a very good trip, business and social -wize. I also got to see Isis and she's super cute as always. Here's some pictures for those who don't know her. She likes to Jetski.

      I had a good weekend. Besides not trying to give in full force to my chocolate & sugar cravings (Halloween is hard!), I went grocery shopping, and spent Saturday printing! Wow was that fun. My dad and my brother were at school using the darkroom and I asked if I could go. I had a great time, can't wait to do it again. I just have to find my book of negatives that has the goodstuff in it. This weekend all I could find was my two whole binders of rejects.  Go  urlLink here  to see some of my real photography.

       So I feel like Nelly with the little Band-Aid on my face. I had a birthmark removed today during lunch and half of my face is numb. Well, actually it is just starting to wear off and hurt like hell, but that should go away soon.   At first my right nostril, top right lip face, and teeth were numb. I looked like I had a stroke because my lip was all droopy on the right side. Well, this is quite a change. I've always had this one bump next to my nose and now it's gone. There is this Nathaniel Hawthorne story about a Man who tried to remove the only imperfection from his wife (  urlLink a birthmark  ) and it kills her. Interesting read.

      I think I am still recovering from the concert. I am really tired today, even though I ate well this weekend and got enough sleep. It is hard to keep my eyes open at my desk, especially because I have been daydreaming about mummies; I watched a thing on the discovery channel yesterday about mummies. So I get to day dreaming about these archeological finds and how today I read in the NYTimes that there was an  urlLink artifact  discovered that could be the earliest known written reference to Jesus. And how lately everything I've been reading and watching has tied together in some way.

I've never seen a light show quite like it, and the music was of course the best. Maybe I'm just getting old, but I don't think I was ever able to stand up (much less bop around) from 9:30pm - 1am after being at work all day. I had to take some breaks and sit on the sidelines for a bit.   My next big internal debate is whether or not to go see Big Daddy Kane, Jurassic 5, & the Beatnuts. They are coming up soon, and the last J5 concert I saw was so rockin. I saw them at the Bowery Ballroom and Funk and I were up close to the stage, it was amazing! I may have to take the next day off though because this Saturday I slept until 4pm the day after the concert.

       Would you take candy from a stranger? Seems like a trick question right, but today in midtown manhattan little strips of individually wrapped pieces of gum from three nice ladies standing on the corner giving out "free samples". I walked by, and they shoved the candy in my face, and being a candy eater and lvoer of presents i took what they gave me without even looking at thier bags closely (all i know is that they were green). The bags could have said, Candy for stupid suckers for all I know. I almost put a pice in my mouth, but decided to put them in my pocket to look at later.  Many people were just walking up and shoving the gum in thier mouths, as I probably would have done if I was more distracted.   One of the benefits of working in midtown: free stuff like frizbees, detergent, and of course gum One of the drawbacks of working in midtown: well, you get the idea.

       This link will take you to the  urlLink Joseph Campbell Foundation . I have read  Hero With a Thousand Faces ,  Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth with Bill Moyers , and a book of lectures that he has given. After seeing the Power of Myth on television I was struck dumb by what I was hearing. The ideas struck such a chord that I could not divert my focus from what I was experiencing. I feel a sense of loss that I will not be able to attend a lecture or see him in person, but I plan to learn as much as I can from his works.   Prof. Stuart Wheeler, Department of Classical Studies, University of Richmond: "It is interesting how George Lucas claimed that he actually went back in the second draft of  Star Wars  to make it more like the archtypical myth laid out in Campbell's Hero With a Thousand Faces. Using Campbell's outline as a guide, return to Star Wars and outline the direct parallels between the archetype and the film."

       This is a view from my apartment window. Now with the new couch it is nice to sit and see the sunset, although lately the sun sets earlier and earlier. Thanks to the woman who told me my skirt was all tucked up this morning. If she hadn't I would have been walking around wearing an embarrassingly ripped skirt all day. I am going to try to keep some lists and interests available on this site so that if someone happens along and shares some, maybe we could start up a conversation. Right now I have been reading a lot of Joseph Campbell's work, so I will try to write some about him.

      Yesterday as I was walking to get a cab, I saw a woman trip and fall onto the sidewalk. She hit her face and her glasses came off. Now being the clumsy person I am (having totally wrecked up both my knees with falls such as this) I had to help. She seemed to be about 60 or 70, and was with her sister. So I brought her back to my office and let them use the ladies room. I had noticed people stop when she fell, but hardly anyone was willing to help, one man stopped to help her up, but some people actually walked past "tsking". It was a very odd situation, and it reminded me about the first time I tripped hardcore when I was living in Brooklyn. I was walking with my laptop bag and I tripped on the sidewalk (nothing new) but because of the weight of the laptop bag, I was thrown off balance and really hit the dirt. I ripped my pants totally open, my hands and knees were absolutely wrecked. And then I look up, there is a guy about 30 on a payphone just staring at me and SMILING! And I mean I hit the dirt!  He didn't do anything just stood and was kindof laughing at me, probably telling his buddy on the phone about how funny it was.  I'm not sure NYC looks so alluring anymore. The garbage, the people... I think I am just loosing my patience. New York is a great place, but I still feel like nothing's changed, and that people have pacified themselves by putting up flags and talking on the train about how they are making plaques out of I beams for commemorative purposes... I won't even go there, I'm just fed up. But I do love NY

      Yesterday I found out that a boy who used to play with my brothers was pushed out of a window and died. I remember him, his general appearance, my brother remembered that he used to sell wrapping paper. Last night we saw the candle light vigil while leaving from my parents house after dinner. It's very hard not to think about what I would do if I lost one of my brothers or family members or friends. I have been thinking about it, and it just confirms how much I care about everyone. I don't feel a renewed sense of how much they mean to me because they've always meant so much to me.   Not the best thoughts for any day, much less a monday.  I'm sure this  urlLink article  does nothing to sum up his life, but it has some facts.

      So my turtle is doing well still, which makes me happy. He's so active and lovable, even if he is kinda stinky. Kindof like my brothers (no offense guys hehe). So I got this free subscription to Shape magazine for joining the health club that I ACTUALLY go to and has no contracts (Dad!!!). It's actually a very useful magazine with good recipes and foods that you can substitute for others, etc... They had this very interesting article about stress making you ache. So after going to the gym with Jeff this weekend, I am hooked. I had been working out too hard and just couldn't last very long. Jeff checked my heart rate and everything and told me that if I started out at a slower pace I would be burning fat not muscle and that is what I would like to do right now. I actually lasted for a half hour on one of those machiney things (I don't know what they are called, I'm not a big gym person). But going with Jeff was fun. I hope we can go every weekend together.

       Last night was amazing. The roots concert was probably the best I've been to so far. I was in the very first row. It was at the Knitting Factory and they could only have sold about a hundred tickets because the place was so small! It was amazing. The guys were standing at waist height to me. The only thing blocking me from being RIGHT next to them was the 2 foot deep speaker between us. I was standing on the far left hand side of the stage.    One speaker was from my waist down, and the other two were above my head to the left. Probably not the smartest place to be, but certainly it was worth it. I think I actually lost some hearing in my left ear (it's still not back to normal). My arm was close enough to reach a couple people if I wanted. Their new songs seem very inviting, I can't wait to get the new CD "Phrenology". Near the end of the concert Black Thought leaned down and set down his water on the speaker I was standing up against.     So here's a picture. It may look like a normal bottle of Poland Spring water to you, but we (the chosen 4 that went to the concert) KNOW that it's no ordinary bottle. OK, so I know I sound like a  urlLink Star Fucker  (lyrics should not be read by the light hearted). This is a reference to a song by Nine Inch Nails about people who "worship" famous people above all else. Obviously not a complimentary tune. But rest assured, I will not auction it off on e-bay like my brother told me I should. I took a picture of it and then I recycled it.

       Look at how beautiful he is on the left. Do I have to ask the obvious question?! What has happened to the Michael Jackson I fell in love with? Admitting to that now makes me feel icky, like the fact that I own two R. Kelly CDs. But that's a whole different  urlLink mess .    But back to Michael. Numerous articles have been written about him lately (even in today's New York Times). I guess his descent into madness is a slippery slope. As if all the rumors weren't bad enough, now you see pictures of his nose caving in and he's dangling his kids over a railing. I'm not sure why it wasn't broke for me yet, but this is the straw that broke my camel's back.   I get misty when I think about the first RECORD I ever bought, which was  Thriller ! And that's when I fell in love. "Night creatures crawl and the dead start to walk in their masquerade. There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time, this is the end of the line! Woooo." That was Michael singing Thriller if you weren't sure.  Beat it and Billy Jean... I know everyone knows that he's the King of Pop. It makes me really mad if he has been allowed to ruin himself with self mutilation and all sorts of psychiatric abnormalities while other people stand by and watch. Maybe it should be obvious to me that he's plain old lost it. I just can't help feeling really sad and sorry for him. Go here if you want a car-wreck type of voyeuristic look into the many  urlLink "faces"  of Michael Jackson.

        So this morning I come up out of the lower level of the GCT tunnels and I see this delivery man in cutoff green shorts. I notice this because it's freezing outside, and I never understand people who wear shorts in the winter (no offense Garth). So I notice this guy and he has a black hat on that says "drink better water" on the back. I'm just noticing these things like I normally do when I people-watch, but this one turned out to be more interesting than normal.  Even though there is traffic speeding past, he pulls his heavily laden hand-truck into the closest lane, blocking traffic. He was clearly asking for some trouble, and that's when other people started to watch as well. He specifically was blocking the way of a taxi (which is not good news) so the taxi started honking loudly and continuously. The taxi seizes the chance to pull into a farther lane and go around the delivery guy, and yells something out the window at him. The delivery guy yells something back and beats on the trunk of the taxi. The WALK sign is now ready for all of us non-adventurous pedestrians so we start crossing the street. The taxi stops, the driver gets out, the guy with the hand-truck leaves his stuff and runs over to the taxi and they start a fight. All kinds of names were thrown around and it was a fine display of jackassery.    The good news is a cute boy and I shared a moment of disdain for such behavior by saying at the same time "well good morning" and chuckling and smiling.

       Well there is new news from the world of Mayan Archeology this morning.   "A jade figurine, partly uncovered from a tomb in the Pyramid of the Moon near Mexico City, appears to be carved in a Maya style." - The New York Times   This means that the two cultures of Teotihuacan and the Mayans had contact with each other. Up until this point, Archeologists were looking to find a link, if any, between the two. This is very exciting news for me, since I am interested in all things Pre-Columbian.  On a somewhat weirder note, yesterday my neighbor left a piece of mail out for me that had been mistakenly put in with hers. It was a letter that turned out to be from an inmate at a prison (delivered to my home address!) asking if I would write to him. He said that a Deacon at my parent's church had given him my address and so he sent the letter. I called my mother right away, and she called the deacon, and the deacon said that she had never given out any home addresses, but then they realized that in the Church bulletin they print change of addresses. And the church bulletin is sent to everyone, including these inmates at the prison that are associated with this letter writing program.  My father writes to someone, but the letters get sent to the church, and then passed out to the respective people. Nothing is ever mailed to his home. Well, this was quite scary for a while last night, but I guess I'm not supposed to worry because he doesn't get out of jail until 2015. Small consolation when I think about what he must have done to be put in jail for so long in the first place. WEIRD.

       Lunch was very nice today. I just got paid, so I spent some money on necessities; that's right, shoes, necklace, and a belt. I am going to a wedding this weekend and had no shoes to wear. That's my excuse. But really, I only looked in the sale racks and stuff so I don't feel guilty. My necklace only cost $12 :). After that was done I walked into Rockefeller Center thinking about what to get for lunch, when almost as in answer to my question, a farmer's market popped into view. It was full of big apples, apple cider, apple cider donuts, apple pie... Other tables had all sorts of pies and produce. They were even selling cactuses (cacti for you spelling people). For an additional treat, the tree in Rockefeller Center is up, and scafforlded.There are guys up there real high up with saws and everything. The tree looks much nicer this year I think. So if you ever wondered how thy get all the lights up there, here's a picture.

       So as I am feverishly writing e-mails and following up on work, I notice a man at the copy machine that is near my cubicle. He's a great and funny guy. Maybe about 65 years old, very smart... And I watch him pray to the copy machine. You know the stance: Standing with drooped shoulders, head down, staring at the machine as if it will speak to you with the truth of gods. Some people get mesmerized by this machine, and I found myself deep in tough about what it is that captures peoples attention and makes them so useless in front of mechanical devices. It's as if they are in awe of the machine, or is it frustration?   There are always a few types of people when it comes to these things... The reverent and helpless, the masters, the procrastinators, and the copy-raged. We've already talked about the reverent. The masters are the people who solve every problem and have this (falsely attributed) aura of magician around the office. I believe I fit into this category. The procrastinators are the ones who know how to use the copier, but never let anyone else know so they don't have to help anyone else out. They also sit at the copy machine trying to enlarge pictures of their face or making ridiculous amount of copies of something.... anything not to do actual work. Then there is the copy-rage people. They stand in front of the machine and offer up a scrappy irregularly sized piece of paper and expect it to run through the feeder. When the inevitable warning "BEEP" of the copier rings out, you start to hear BEEPS come out of the users mouth. They curse up a storm and sometimes whack at the machine. Then they try to retrieve their paper from the workings of the inner rollers and recesses of the deep. Either way, the masters get called again to save the day. And since I sit right near the copier I get to help everyone.   At least I am treated like a magician.

"nick's martini los angeles" "images of gondolas" "hammerstein ballroom big daddy kane beatnuts" "my photos karate" "popul vuh" "corn muffin pics"  It's very interesting what people are out there searching for. Do these phrases say something about my site? my life? I do like a good corn muffin.

       I can't believe it. I get sadder the more I think about it, even though I know I never knew anyone from Run DMC. I did see DMC on the street once in NYC. It just makes it so much more unbelieveable that he's been shot because of his peaceful life. Such a loss to our culture and times. I can't even imagine what his family and friends are going through. I feel the loss. Please visit  urlLink this site  if you are interested in a community who shares the opinion that Jam Master Jay was an International Treasure.

      I have been looking into canceling my NYSC membership. It's just so boring. I think that's my problem with gyms in general... Because of my general lack of motivation to go, I need something that will keep me interested, and maybe give me a place to meet new people. I used to love Karate because it was such a stress relief and it somehow it made me more able to concentrate. So today I took the first steps toward finding a Dojo that is close to work, and won't make me sign a contract just incase I bail yet again on an exercise regimen. They are on vacation until January 2nd, so I will have to call them when they get back. Ok I am off to cancel my gym membership. Stay Warm.

       Walking to or from work I tend to ruminate on the idea that walking through the streets in Manhattan during rush hour is a lot like Frogger. It is worse however, in the evening rush hour when you notice that people are  MUCH  more anxious to get home as they are to get to work in the morning.  Walking along the street it's mostly just crowded, but once you get to a cross-street, the amphibian in you must stand up and be counted! People are coming, you move to the right, slow down, jump ahead, fake right, then left and hope that you get past all the pedestrians going at different speeds just for a chance to wait at the curb for the sign to say  WALK  so you can start everything all over again. Maybe it's more like a huge game of basketball, where instead of making shots and sinking baskets, your goal is to just get safely to the transportation of choice where you can sit (or stand) and let it take you the rest of the way home.

       I sent an e-mail to some people after trying to figure out the  urlLink exact lyrics to "Rivers of Babylon"  by the Melodians on the soundtrack to the Jimmy Cliff movie "The Harder They Come".  This website then took me to an analysis of  urlLink references to Psalms in Reggae lyrics .   This is what my expert said:  "The captors are telling the Israelites to sing  and obviously the Israelites don't feel they have much to sing about.  However, they do sing and here is something they sing about - the destruction of their captors v. 8 'O daughter Babylon, you devastator!  Happy shall they be who pay you back, what you have done to us!' (and the most disturbing of the verses - v9 'Happy shall they be who take your little ones and dash them against the rock!')  The Babylonians would not have been able to understand the lanugage of the Israelites so they may get their song but they have no idea that the Israelites are singing for the Babylonians destruction.  Kind of a weird twist."   My favorite lines are:  "So, let the words of our mouth  And the meditations of our heart  Be acceptable in Thy sight.  Oh, Fari!"

       Let me state the obvious... It's snowing! I am so excited. Although it is a pain, and I didn't bring a hat and my glasses always fog up, I am super happy, and those things don't bother me. I wonder how long I will be happy about it. I should start a poll on when I will start complaining that it's too cold, or too slushy.  For now I am happy, and it gets me in the mood for Christmas. We put up blinky lights all over the living room last night and they are SPECTACULAR. When you have such a small apartment, colorful lighting goes a long way. I hope everyone is staying warm, and please try to help the people who are not. Happy Snow Day.

      Mr. T and I really like the song "Seed" by the Roots and Cody Chestnutt. After hearing it live I have been listening to the song a lot, and when it comes on Buddy (aka Mr. T or Mr. Turtle) pops his head out of the water and stars swimming around. I think I've got a musician on my hands. Just like his uncle Cory.

       Well, here are the long awaited pictures of my turtle "Buddy", or "Mr. Turtle" depending on what mood we're in. He's about the size of the first part of my thumb, up to the knuckle. He's a tiny little thing. I cleaned his tank yesterday and he's always so well behaved. He seems to be growing. As best I can tell his shell is getting bigger. If anyone has good turtle advice, please let me know.

       I'm in New Hamphire and it was freezing cold yesterday. Today is much nicer. That bitter wind is missing, and the sun has been out a bit.   I took some pictures of a fountain that had frozen up. The ice must just keep building up because you can see a little spray from the water coming out the top.  Last night I had a peanut butter pie. It was tasty. There was a Layer of pie crust, a layer of chocolate, and a layerof this moussey peanutbutter tasting stuff. It was very tasty (did I say that already?). So much for my no-sugar kick! I'll try not to give up, it's only a minor setback :).

       SO I just got back late last night from a trip to Rochester, NY. Cheryl's cookies and cupcakes are still amazing! Time does make them seem even better however.  I got to see all the people I used to work will and that was fun. I feel a lot of good momentum at work now, I just hope everyone can hold on until this rough spot smoothes itself out. I learned so much and got so much accomplished this week that I really feel good. It was so nice to hang out with Christen too, she's super fun. I had a great time at her place and then visiting her boyfriend's apartment late on Wednesday night. Her boyfriend's roommate is someone I definitely wouldn't kick out of bed. Tasty! Anyway...  I haven't been doing my karate homework, or eating very well this week. I can't help it, I just can't resist Cheryl's ninja sugar magic (or the chocolate cake at the Hyatt). I was also so happy to see the new additions to the world by the names of Abby and Wyatt. It was so much fun to see how they light up thier mother's faces. Go Cindy and Kelly! You are supermoms!  Next week I am off to New Hampshire for work. Hopefully I'll have some good stories for you when I return.

      So I went last night to karate class! I was happy that I was able to go for the full hour. I did happen to notice that my left leg and arch of my foot was in a permanent cramp the entire class, but otherwise I did ok. That is of course if you remove the pitiful job I did at the situps and pushups. I can do ten of each, but wussy style. I would imagine I would have the same grace wrestling a llama. It's comical. The teacher gave both of us (another white belt) homework; stretching, SITUPS and PUSHUPS.   I have to tell you about this Karate instructor. He has a deep voice and a playful way about him, but he's all business. His Japanese accent just forces me to pay attention because that coupled with his deeper voice makes for interesting day dreams (can you tell I have a woman crush on him?). Anyway, he was trying to explain to us how to do this one stance, and he said "I've never wear high heel, but this (shows ball of foot on floor, heel in air) is what feet do, no?" So throughout the rest of the night he keeps saying "High Heel, no sneaker!" and it was great. You can tell just by watching him that he knows what he's doing, and that I can learn a lot from him. All of the teachers are great. All kidding aside about the crush, I was all business too during class, but afterwards...

      I went during lunch today to look at the American Indian Art display for auction at Christie's. I had been reading the catalog all weekend and there were so many things I wanted to see and get the chance to touch. When I went today they only had a few of the rugs on display, all of the rest had been taken away in preparation for the auction. I would have had to ask one of the specialists to bring me back into the rooms where the stuff was stored, and I figured I didn't have enough time to do that, so I went back to work after seeing the rugs. I guess I am disappointed, I did really want to see the pottery. It would be up close with no glass between. There were some exceptionally beautiful rugs, though. This one in particular.   Estimate:  $25,000-35,000    A TLINGIT CEREMONIAL DANCE BLANKET, CHILCAT of classic form, finger woven with commercial wool in yellow, blue, ivory and black, mountain goat's wool and twisted cedar bark fiber, with a highly stylized totemic crest design, probably representing a killer whale, composed of typical conventionalized formline elements, a panel of long twisted fringe at bottom, smaller panels of twisted and plaited fringe along the sides, with tag sewn onto the reverse, inscribed, 1-82.5.21.2 Dimensions: 70 x 35 in. (177.8 x 88.9 cm.)

      So I swallowed my pride and went to my first karate class in at least two years. There is nothing like a floor to ceiling, wall to wall mirror to encourage you to assess yourself in negative ways. After a few minutes of discouraging mirror gazing, I was punching and blocking away (as best as I could). I am so impressed with the whole school and the atmosphere of the teachers and students. I think I will try to sign up this Friday. Woo Hoo!

      I'm excited because I have my first introductory karate class this week and I am looking forward to it. I read in a magazine about a specialised notebook that allows you to keep track of all sorts of things. There is one geared towards your whole body, one geared towards eating and fitness, and another that mostly focuses on excercizing. It's called  urlLink Memory Minder .  I have been really lucky lately. As for gadgets... some newly acquired ones include a 126MB card for my Sony cliE, and a spotlight for my laptop keybord for when I do presentations. I got 4 CD's as gifts and 3 more with a gift certificate, ther are 1)Eric B. & Rakim, don't sweat the technique 2) The Roots, Phrenology 3)Audioslave 4)Run DMC's greatest Hits 5) Jay-Z, MTV unplugged feat. the Roots 6)Jurassic5, power in numbers 7) Bob Marley & Various Artists, chant down babylon.  I also ended up getting some DVD's, let me think... Ghost World, Y Tu Mama Tambien,  urlLink Mujeres al borde de un ataque de nervios , and I think that's it for the DVD's.

      Well hell, I actually signed up for an intro Karate class. Hopefully I haven't forgotten everything I learned a couple yers ago. I was just about to get my third belt before I had to move, so I hope I've retained some of that knowledge.

       Hello turtle lovers. I took Buddy to the vet to get a check up and to make sure that I was taking good care of him. It was an all around wonderful experience. Jeff really is the Dog Whisperer. There was this terrified pit bull who kept trying it's hardest to crawl underneath Jeff's legs. He had this face on like "please help me". It was so cute. So back to Mr. Turtle... It's been confirmed! Mr. Turtle is a Mister. and oddly enough (much the the vet's excitement) he has a male symbol on his underside. We were so happy that he was healthy and happy that we went out and bought him a brand new home. A MUCH bigger aquarium and some new aquatic plants to nibble on. He LOVES it. I took pictures of him as well as all the snow that has been happening, but I have no way to upload them at this time. I can't wait to show you his underbelly (that sounds way more pervertish than I meant it to).

      Hello out there, who ever you are. Dave. doesn't sound like a mysterious name... And so begins my strange story of an early Valentine's day gift that is probably from my boyfriend, but was signed "-Dave"  Derek, this guy at work, hands me this box of flowers and says something like "somebody loves you" in a musical kind of way. My first thought is "That Bastard" while smiling ear to ear. Jeff and I said that we weren't going to get each other anything for Valentine's day, just go out and have a nice dinner over the weekend. And I meant it too. But then I remembered talking to him in the car and saying "Can you send me some flowers at work and I'll pay you for them? I like having plants at work." I was half-joking, but I guess he (being the sweetie that he is) decided to give me a little surprise.  I open the box, see the multi-colored tulips (I love tulips) and set about getting a vase and all that good stuff. I go to read the note attached and it says "Happy Valentine's Day...Love you." "Dave"  DAVE?! Who is Dave! Is my boyfriend just messin with me (he is a funny guy). I'm sure it was just a mixup with the flower company. Do I actually have a secret admirer?! Of course not, but it's neat to think about. And of course I can't get in touch with Jeff because his cellphone must be out of range. Well, it's a nice thought to have a secret admirer, even though now adays it's called stalking.

      Well I ordered the  urlLink Kashi Go Lean  Crunch Combo. I got 14 go lean bars, two cans of shake mix, and two boxes of cereal.  It's so much food it should last me a while. I've wanted healthier snacks to have at work, and I hope these work out. THIS IS NOT some weird appetite suppressant system. In fact it is healthy, natural food. Enough about this, I just wanted you all to know how great it was.  I also have to go to karate tonight, and I think I've put to much pressure on myself because I couldn't go for 2 weeks and then I was sick last week so I didn't want to go if my stomach was squirrely. SO now's my first chance to go and I am anxious for some reason. I made a vet appointment for Mr. Turtle. He's got some very small pits in his shell and I want to make sure that he's not sick or that I'm feeding him right. Does anyone have turtle advice for me?

       My stomach has been misbehaving very badly lately. Ever since this weekend I have been feeling so sick and I'm getting very tired of it. I had to miss karate yesterday because of it, and that was a very large and frustrating bummer. It had been my first chance in over 2 weeks that I'd been able to go. I was all set, and I had to leave work around 2:30. I even had to cancel a meeting, which I hate doing.   I got sick at 1 today and took some pepto. Now I feel a little better,  but there is still that knot in my stomach. It's not stress I don't think, although today started off as the day from hell. I think it was the fact that I was watching rosemary's baby last night. Boy is that a good movie. I think I brought the devil into work with me today though, cause everything went to hell until about 12:30.

      My proposal for tuition reimbursement is past the second stage. First stage was actually completing the proposal (took quite a few months of procrastinating and then having a eureka moment yesterday where I got it all done). Stage two was getting it past the first level of approval. I would love to take a Spanish for business class and a verb refresher course. I think that even if the company doesn't pay for it I will take it anyway. I'd probably pick a class that would go towards a graduate degree, however. This particular class isn't for credits (which means it's less expensive). I can't wait to be back in class and speaking Spanish again.  On another note I am so glad to hear that Marquito's eyelashes aren't freezing anymore. I remember walking down the quarter-mile in college and having that happen. I also remember having a hard time breathing through my nose because it would freeze up on the inside! Try blowing bubbles when it gets really cold. They freeze! Fun in the snow!  Stay warm!

      I haven't written much lately because I don't know how to talk about what's going on, so I just think. But today there are protestors outside St. Patrick's and they are growing in number every minute. They plan to stage a "die-in". I guess this means that they are going to lie down in the middle of midtown streets and pretend to be dead. I'm sure they will accomplish making traffic stand still. I knew this when I came out of the train this morning, but as I was walking down the street I saw these three girls with a roll of caution tape "sneakily" running it across 47th street between two cars. Supposedly this piece of plastic tape would make some deep point. The girls (who looked about 17) were giggling with darting eyes like they were playing some practical joke. Like fox news says "We report, you decide".  I have nothing against anti-war protestors. But selfishly I am frustrated that any portion of the "safety-net" of helicopters and police that are supposed to be concentrating on anti-terrorism now have to deal with a bunch of kids who want to ditch school to screw with authority. OK that was a generalization, but I'm just trying to get on with work (and not try to let worrying about the war or Terrorists, or the threat of nuclear and biological weapons, or Osama Bin Laden, stop me). "What are we fighting for" anyway? I'd just like to be clear on that somehow. I'm not sure if anyone is.  As for those helicopters, they are constantly circling this area (which is exactly where all the protestors are) and it's quite unnerving. I'm sure the news is hovering over us as well. I have a particular distaste for Fox News in particular. Everyday on the way to work I see the gigantic outdoor news-ticker that reminds me that NYC is the most mentioned target in intercepted "intelligence" communications. Their anchors also have this sense that they are smart, and actually have something to contribute. They are sensationalists and they ask completely inappropriate and insulting questions. I can't go any further on this because then I'll start to get mad and I'll rant all day.  I have two brothers. One is in his early 20's and the other is 17. I can easily picture both of them being one of the people who are confronted face to face with this war. In the sand, carrying guns or flying stealthy bombers. I want this to end just like everyone else.

        So I saw this video for a song called "It Takes More" by  urlLink Ms. Dynamite . It was one of those times where the hair stood up on my arms and I got goosebumps. Something about her and the music and the lyrics really got to me. It's a jumpin song. Check out the parisian music in the background. And it's so great to see another hip-hop woman kickin intellectual ass! Rock on sister friend. And she's only 21. Go visit the site, definetely. Im'a go by the album (if it's out already).

        OK, so I finished this book a few days ago, and man! it's an amazing book. I can't say enough about it. Gutwrenching, frustrating, empowering... Such wonderful themes and pictures are drawn by Amy Tan's writing. I STRONGLY suggest that you  urlLink read this book .  I'm sorry that I haven't posted in so long, but I have no way to download images from my camera until I buy a new card reader! Can't wait. Ug!

        Well here are the first pictures from Mr. Turtle's first visit to the Vet. I've been wanting to post these for a very long time, but I only was able to buy a replacement card reader last weekend, so - HERE IT IS. Mr Turtle (and he IS a Mr.) in all his glory (well you can't see any of his legs, head or arms but you get the picture).  Something I hadn't noticed was that Mr.T has a "male" symbol on his underbelly there. Take a look, it starts in the upper right part, and curves toward the center to make the downward pointing arrow. After Dr. Ringler's excitement, I just had to take a picture to show everyone. I want to buy a little scale so I can see how much he is growing. He has a ring of newly grown shell, so I'm assuming that he's growing well.  I thought about making a chickenwire fence for him that I can keep in the trunk of my car so that if we want to bring him to the park or put him in the grass, he can have an area to play in, but we don't have to worry about loosing him. I hope to have my own yard soon so I can build him a permanent play area out there. Any suggestions?

        So a lot's been going on at work.I got a promotion which I feel fits very well, and I still get to work with people who I've been working with for a long time and that feels good. I've been neglecting this blog for so long because I've been busy, but also I feel it's unfair to ramble on without attaching a picture of some kind. I don't understand why anyone reads this blog to begin with, but having to read without some visual distractions must be even worse :). More to come...

       Good Morning Everyone! Last night we put down the security deposit on our new apartment. WOO HOO! The landlord seems nice, and the people who live in it now are great - I know the woman from work and she's a great client to work with. I can't wait to move in. The funny part is that our apartment is about 1/2 the size of the new one, so it will be so empty when we move in. I think it will be laughable to have so much more space, I think I may have a hysterical episode the first time I look at the apartment empty. I have been stuck in such a small apartment that it will be great to get out. This picture is 1/2 of the backyard. It has a backyard! I can't believe it.   This is a picture of the new kitchen. I am proud to have a kitchen that is worthy of his cooking talents. Can't wait for all the good meals that will come out of it. It's hard for me not to get my hopes up about this apartment, but I feel like since I put the security deposit down that it's pretty sure that we have the place now. Phew, I am so excited!

       OK, I am frustrated to the point of being angry about a particular situation involving work. I can't talk about it specifically because certain people from work read this website (and the problem has absolutely nothing to do with them so they shouldn't worry). It's been over a month and I have had no progress on a specific matter and it's extremely frustrating. Rant rant, complain, complain, blah blah blah. Everyone has work problems, but I am particularly liking my job right now, and this part is just sucking all of the fun out. It's just very disappointing and frustrating. So there, that's my bitch for today.   On a much better note, this weekend I went to see a free concert in Battery Park. The LEGENDARY ROOTS were there, and I might be on TV because they are airing the concert this Saturday at 8pm on MTV. I love the roots! And they had two new members play guitar and sing with them and they are definitely people to watch for! I had such a great time.

       Hello Everyone - I went to the podiatrist last week and I know a whole lot more about myself now. As odd as this seems, this visit to the podiatrist was fun. Interestingly enough there are a few things "wrong" with me and my "feets". - I have this thing called a  urlLink nueroma  that they found in my x-rays. It's when a nerve gets inflammed and grows (benignly) because it is stuck between two of the toe bones. - My left leg is INDEED one inch shorter than my right leg (which could be why I have back pain). - I have almost completely flat feet The good thing is that getting orthotics will probably help all of these problems. Who knew that a simple visit to the doctor could teach me so much.   I also have an official reason for being so clumsy (woo hoo!). p.s. this is not a real x-ray of my foot, it's just an illustration.

       Take a look at this picture and ask yourself, Has Erica's curse come true!? Who's having a bad reaction to the GREAT Mexican food we ate! Unclean! We are distancing ourselves from him.  Naw! we love him.   urlLink Vicki brought Keng , and Keng brought his camera and we got some good pictures of the group. I'm there with my big skirt and my fiesta shirt. I had a great time. Thanks guys for coming.    Our neighbors seem great (except for the ones we had to call the cops on) but that was more of a father/son screaming match than anything else.    Everything is Spanish around us. It's great to be able to hear it and eat it (there are quite a few Peruvian and Ecuadorian restaurants in the area).  All of our neighbors are Hispanic (except for the ones we had to call the cops on) and there is an Italian Social Club at the end of our block where the old dudes sit out on the street and talk. It's great.  I'll have more pictures of my apartment up soon. Have a great week.

       So here is a picture of the cake that Jeff got me. It's a Haagen Dazs Cookies and Cream ice cream cake!!! So 6 people came to our new apartment and then we went over to Mary Ann's to eat! It was great.   I don't know why but I get kinda wacky around my birthday. I get bummed, even though everyone is so nice and I get presents. It's weird.   And I noticed today that there is panini EVERYWHERE. What is up with panini!? Why is it so trendy?!

Don't get me wrong, I am very excited about moving, but it seems to have worn me out somewhat. Can't wait to eat some good food.  New CD's I want to get: Ownerz by GangStarr (I forgot the rest).  I hope to have new pictures of my apartment up soon. There is a sandbox out back for Mr. Turtle, I hope that sand is safe for him. Maybe I will dig up the sand and put some dirt in it. Either way he's got a very cool play house now.

        I had such a great time this weekend at the 5th of July party! Thanks to Vicki, Keng, Joe, Jenn and Scott for showing up! I had such a great time.   So we finally moved in to our new place, and slept there for the first time last night. My will had already been broken by the time the party came around, and I think that was a great kick in the pants! Thank god for Jeff and my family because there was no other way to get it done.  Besides one casualty (punctured the Freon tube in the big air conditioner) everything is going well. Shower works well and Mr. Turtle is right at home.  Now comes my birthday party/housewarming party. Happy belated Fourth of July!

I am also wondering why we picked this weekend (my family is having a huge party that will take up all of saturday) to move?! Just had to vent a little. I know it's been a long time since I've written, but think of how much happier my blogs will be when I'm all done :)

      It is 4:53 now and the power has been  out since 4:20. I am home in Port Chester. Jeff is at 33rd Street in NYC and Cory is somewhere. I’ve been trying to get in touch with him to find out if he’s ok but I can’t get through to him. Jeff was somehow able to call me soon after it happened. I thought  it was just our house, but he said that it was in NYC and in NJ too. He has the radio at work, but couldn’t find any station with information on the power outage.   Just a few minutes ago I called the local Police and they said that it was a state-wide power outage and that they had no idea what caused it.  So should I state the obvious? I feel just like I did when I was stuck in the city on 9-11.  Completely  cutoff from all information. Not knowing what the best thing to do next is… I feel some need to protect myself, but from what.  I have no working radio anywhere, my  parents  are on their way home  from their vacation in maine  and I hope that they are not stranded on a road somewhere. I went outside to see if anyone was talking about it and I heard some teenagers talking about how all of the streetlights are off and so all the cars are jammed up. Then they started talking about how some people must be looting.  I want to make sure that I have all my senses in case something terrible has happened and I need to drive or think clearly.  At least I know that Jeff has a radio and is with a bunch of other people. I am mostly worried about Cory.  Just tried to text message him again.  I hate that all I can think of is that there was some terrorist attack on some main power plant or that something awful has happened.  I think that I would be a lot less anxious if I could just get in touch with my brother.  I just got through to my parents house but its just ringing.

       SO I had the best time visiting my brother on Saturday! He's newly at college so I wanted to get a chance to see his dorm and his new surroundings. The campus is so pretty, and it was such a great day! We drove around and ate at Pizza Hut (god I love those breadsticks). We bought some CD"s and ate some oreos and walked around campus (did I say that already?).   This is a picture of him going into the "Smiley Art Building" where he has most of his classes.  I think that's a great name for a building.  I had a good time and can't wait to go back in a couple weeks to get tattoos!!!

       urlLink   Oh my god! I haven't written in so long, so I thought I'd take a few minutes to write about dinner last night. My friend Paula suggested we go out to dinner at Bobby Flay's restaurant called Mesa Grill. Besides getting to see her (which was wonderful) the dinner was  fabulous. Our waiter was very helpful and polite, but also had a good sense of humor. When he suggested an appetizer that had cheese in it I said that I can't have dairy. Later on he came back and said that while he was putting in my order he remembered what I said about the dairy and wanted to know if I wanted my meals made without any butter or cream, etc... I thought that was very thoughtful. We stayed for a very long time after we paid the check and no one was rude or tried to rush us out of there. Here's what we ordered and our informal reviews:  Appetizers:  Me: FRY BREAD TAQUITOS - wonderful but not my taste, I wouldn't get them again but Paula liked them. Paula: CORNMEAL CRUSTED OYSTERS - holy cow!!!! I hate oysters but these were AMAZING! I couldn't believe that I was actually eating them. They were very good. Anyone who goes to this restaurant must have these.  Entrees: Me: SPICE CRUSTED NEW YORK STRIP STEAK - God the steak was good. I never eat steak and it was great! But the whole meal could have been terrible if I still had the buttermilk mashed potatoes. They came as a side to the steak and they were amazing. I could have eaten a whole plate of just those potatoes. Paula: NEW MEXICAN SPICE RUBBED PORK TENDERLOIN - this was very good as well. Paula loved it. I just couldn't get over my potatoes.  Desserts: Yes we made enough room for dessert. Me: WARM CHOCOLATE DULCE de LECHE CAKE - I don't know what to say about this dessert, it was so rich I could only eat a few bites. I wish I had saved more room. It was warm and melt and heavenly.  Paula: TOASTED PECAN AND SMOKED VANILLA FLAN - this paled in comparison to the dulce de leche.  I NEED to go  back. I think everyone should go there if they are in the City.

      I went to see Lord of the Rings last night, well this morning at 12:10 AM. For the past two years my dad has wanted to go to the opening showing on for his birthday, so we all go. They have all been such great movies, but I am working on 3 hours sleep and I hurt my neck and it's one of those things where I can't even turn my head, and I"m holding it funny like I am trying to get water out of my ear.  Well, the movie was great, talk about fight scenes! Happy Birthday Dad (almost).

       It's been quite a long time since I've written anything in here. Work has been so incredibly stressful and busy. And right before Thanksgiving a good friend's father died. My family and I were close to this man and his family. It's still very hard to think about. I do however think about them often and how they are doing. I wish I knew the best thing to do in this situation. I don't want to add to the constant hoards of people that must be suffocating them with awkward discussions, etc... I would love to just be able to hang out and be around. My friend lives in another area though, so it's not like I could just call and drop by to see how she's doing. I would like to go visit her though. She's getting married in July and I'm so excited for her. My luck has sprung it's ugly head however, one of J's best friends is getting married on the SAME EXACT DAY! I am pissed at my luck. That means I can't go with him, and he can't go with me. It makes me sad in a way, I can't believe that he's going to miss my friend's wedding. We won't get to slow dance and get all romantic, It's just a bummer. Silly I know, but a bummer none the less.  WHAT ARE THE ODDS!?  So this past snowfall was very nice and I have a picture of one of our neighborhood squirrels for you to see. Enjoy!

       Check out this dope set of action figures! It was one of my Christmas presents and I'm so psyched. I also joined  urlLink Netflix  and that's been great. It's forcing me to watch movies that I've never seen before, and J and I are getting each other up to speed on movies we think the other person should watch.  Things have been kindof boring lately. I got a lot of nice stuff for Christmas, but I think the after-holiday slump has hit me. Of course I try to make up new years resolutions, but it doesn't feel like another year is here.  We went to the aquarium this past weekend and it was nuts. Does anyone want 2 free kids tickets. We got them at an auction for my mom's nursery school.  Happy New Year!

      We went to see a bunch of Oscar nominated movies and they are all movies I want to buy. I was blown away by all of them.  House of Sand and Fog  was first, saw that a month or so ago. The We saw Mystic River and then we had Whale Rider from Netflix.  I feel like whenever I write here I sound like a 12 year old, so instead of worrying about how I sound, I'm just going to write it all down.   I wish I had written about House of Sand and Fog right when I had seen it, because all I can do now is to look at it in relation to the other movies we've seen since then. Jennifer Connelly did a good job of playing a desparate, frustrated and lonely person. But Ben Kingsley and Shohreh Aghdashloo were amazing. I'm so glad that there was an actual Iranian in this movie. I NEVER cry at movies, and this movie made me cry. This movie is so depressing that there should be a warning on it. Because it's so real, there is no one to blame and it's just so awful. There is no wrapped up ending, you end up thinking about prejudice and vanity. It also made me think about all the people in the world who need help, and others are just to careless to notice or do anything about it.    Whale Rider : This movie was also amazing. Another one that made me cry. Movies never make me cry, this year has been a doozy though. Keisha Castle-Hughes was so touching in the scene from this picture. That's when I got all choked up. Another strange coincidence is that the necklace she is wearing is something that a friend of mine had given me when he went away to New Zealand in high-school.     Mystic River : O.K. I didn't cry at this one, but i was tense the entire time and had this nervous pit in my stomach. It was great. The movie was so well done. I want to see this one again because of the subtle shifts toward the end really change what you think o f all the characters.   On a very  childish side note: I am so pissed that this is the only picture I can find of Sean Penn's character's back tattoo in that movie. He looks so tough and that tattoo looks so good in that pose when he's standing in front of the window there. First of all it makes him look really hot (I don't say that much) and you can see how much more we know about him at that point. If anyone can find a better picture of this scene, please let me know! I'll give you credit on this website.  GREAT MOVIES, go watch!

       GO SEE STARSKY & HUTCH! This movie was so funny - and Snoop stole the show.  I am very pumped. I came into work this morning and had e-mails from three very good friends that I haven't talked to in a long time. That's such a great thing. Jeff and I had a funny ride on the way to work today. We were having to whisper about all the conversation we were having because I was talking about something that was tame to us (about someone I know) but the suits on the train were giving us the "hairy eyeball" so we just kept talking but softer. I guess we curse a lot, who knew. It was even funnier because when we got quieter everyone was trying to listen. You could tell, the rustling newspapers got quieter, there weren't as many slurps on the coffee... I think Jeff and I were the only hip kids on the train. Kids, hah!    Jeff cracks me up, I think he should have his own radio show or something. For folks in-the-know (Merchants who went to the Petra exhibit at the Museum of Natural History) just remember "city of ROCK!".     We're not trouble makers, we're just working stiffs like the rest of the people on the train, but god forbid I don't have a caffeine addiction or that I talk about how ridiculous it is that we don't yet have marriage equality for all people... So ok, I drop the f-bomb every once in a while, I can't help it - maybe I should belatedly give up cursing for lent. Someone at work did that once and now she says stuff like "baloney sandwiches". It's funny (and yes I know that's not how you spell bologna).  Thanks for keeping in touch friends, sorry I'm such a dork when it comes to doing that myself.

       I think I need to dedicate a whole new section of my website to Anthony Hamilton. And thank god for Dave Chappelle! Ok let me start at the beginning. I have to thank Jesse for getting me hooked on Chappelle's Show. I now own the whole first season on DVD. I watch whenever I get a chance and have laughed so hard I get nauseous.  SO I taped a few shows the other night and just happened to be watching them last night when this guy Anthony Hamilton comes on as the musical guest. From the FIRST sound that comes out of his mouth, I had goosebumps. Jeff said it "he's like Marvin". Whenever people invoke His name :) in comparison to new singers I get a little annoyed, but this time it was right on. The most amazing similarity is that they both open their mouths and this amazingly powerful sound comes out without any visible effort. As soon as I got to work I bought the album off i-tunes.   I can't say enough about this guy, and I'm so glad I got to hear that live version first before I bought the album.  PLEASE do yourself a favor and listen to him.

       I finally saw the Movie "Monster" and it was great. I know it's odd, but I love reading murder mysteries and learning about the psychology of it all. I know it's terrible to get entertainment from such terrible things, but I really am fascinated. I wonder if it has something to do with trying to make sense of what has happened to the people who are victims... On a similar note I am also reading a book called the "Black Dahlia Avenger" (see my books section for more on that one).      I really have been under a lot of stress lately, not just normal stress, but everything combined. Work, Life, health... A few weeks ago my dermatologist thought I might have skin cancer. It turns out that I don't (thank god) but that was a NERVEWRACKING week to say the least. Work is always a little stressful (and I actually seem to work better that way) but lately it's been plain stupid. I feel like I'm beating my head against a wall and it's not getting a ny better really.    I never thought I's say this but I actually miss Rochester a bit because of all the great peole I worked with there. I like the people I work with today, but there are onlyone or two I would consider people I woudl hang out with outside of work, and we never seem to make it out. In Rochester we would always hang out, we were all friends and I had some great times. I think I had more of a social life there then I do here. I live in the suburbs here and none of my friends live close. I work in a corporate environment, which isn't very conducive to me being myself or allowing anyone to get to know me at all.   I feel twice as old as I am now. But actually American Gigolo is on HBO and it's a laugh. All Blondie music and bad 80's sunglasses. I guess I don't feel so old anymore. I am making a list of things I want to do so I wo't forget. Maybe I'll post it soon.   In the mean time, take care and have fun.

       OK, so the good music keeps on coming. I got me the new Roots CD yesterday for my birthday! The Tipping Point is amazing.  Does anyone know what Black Thought is saying in "Don't Say Nuthin'"? They are giving away $4000, so check out thier website  urlLink @ the roots @ .    And check this out. ?uestlove's (no that's not a type-o) record library! I've seen the roots more than once in concert and they give the BEST live show I've ever been to. I was completely blown away. I was disappointed with the GangStarr, Mos Def, etc... concert I went to at BBKings. It was worth it for sure, especially to hear Mos Def. I really need to see more of him before long. The Roots entire concert was great! The sound was great, the vibe was great, the croud was awesome. I saw them once at the knitting Factory. I was right in the front row (which you know if you read my website archives).   Anyone out there sick of wack rap? Can I get a witness?

      OK so I think i need to create a new identity for the web. Too many people know who I am so I can't really just write about whatever I want to write about. Any suggestions :).

       So, this is what I read today.   "LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Funk singer Rick James, best known for the 1981 hit ``Super Freak,'' died Friday, apparently of natural causes, police said."  My favorite part is the "apparantly". Seems like people are a little skeptical.  urlLink Read whole aritcle here.   What is Dave Chappele going to do? "I'm dead Beaotch"?!

      It seems that there are less people in the city today. There were markedly fewer people in Grand Central when I was leaving my train this morning. I have to think it's because of the recent information regarding possible terrorist activity in the city. Seems like security is very tight. I must admit I am feeling a little anxious, but I still came into work today.  Does anyone know about these bracelets I've been seeing? I think I've only seem them on Men. They are yellow and they look like they are plastic. They have a word embossed into them and they are about a 1/2 inch wide. If I remember correctly the word says something empowering but I can't for the life of me remember what it says. I saw one on a guy sitting next to me on the bus in Martha's Vineyard. In fact I saw a few that trip.  Does anyone know what this is all about?
