      We've lost again..... this time in table tennis, where our nation's brightest prospect failed to muster herself for the last burst of fire, to claim a bronze. Sadly, she went down 4-1 to a South Korean. There was nothing shameful in that defeat though, and I am personally very proud that the 23 yr old did so well. She did us proud and I tink that alone, suffice for me. I do not know much about the skeptics out there. If they think they can do better, I dare them to take up the challenge! If not, shut the fuck up.  It's so often that we hear the same story. Effort, blood and sweat that ultimately does not translate into results. Hmmm, ring a bell? That, my friends, is Life. Life makes fun of people. It rewards the people who deserves it less. Want an example? Flash back to roughly a month back...     "Aunty hits TOTO jackpot after gift ticket from friend turns out to be winning ticket!"    What in heaven's name did she do to deserve that ticket? I mean, its 2 fucking million dollars my friend! And how much did she give her friend, the one kind enough to give her the ticket? 5 thousand. hmmm.. how many percent is that? I didn't bother to do the math. Its too fucking little. Of course the lucky one got away with it. Life! HA! Call it sour grapes. Maybe my life strategy needs a change. I'll go round coffeeshops making friends with the cleaner aunties and maybe, just maybe I'll be the next millionare.  Someone told me this: "Life is like a vacuum cleaner, it sucks!" Well, I think that is Wisdom. Cuz he is DAMN RIGHT. Mine really sucks big time. Oh yes, while I'm doing this fucking thing I might as well fuck the mantra of " Don't complain, Never explain"  Taxi drivers have practised the art of Complaining to a perfection. Compared to them, I'm a nobody. So count yourself lucky. OK i admit it. I have a foul mouth. But i'm really kind at heart. Really.... i am. God is fair, isn't it? Here's a sample...  Me: Uncle can take me to SPC pls thank you.  Taxi: Ok. Eh, you heard about the latest news?  Me: No leh, why? ( pretending to be interested in the senile conversation )  Taxi: I tell you! They say last quarter got xx% growth you know? The govt thinks we all stupid cuz we drive taxi!  Me: Erm, did they say tat? ( Looking blur and sympathatic)  Taxi: Of cuz la! Uncle lie to you for fuck? IF really xx%, then Uncle should be the king of Eygpt! They bluff people one la... You know why? Cuz someone wants to promote liao, go take over from PM liao lor. So muz make sui sui so people tink he is very good!"  Me: Erm.. ok then? ( trying to look interested.. lamer!!!)  Taxi: You know wat? Uncle last time is GM ok. Smelly also got 10K/ mth. Now? LOOK AT ME? Drive taxi to make living... All because of wat? Stoopid people all. Sit in office, get big fat fucking pay, make stoopid rules so we muz Pay and Pay HAHAHA... Tax here, GSt there.. All my money go to them liao...   Me: AH Uncle, you suppose to let me off like 5 mins ago...   That was just an excerpt. So of the things i did not fill in cuz of content censorship rules. You know those suckers who do nothing but debate on what to allow us to see and watch? Ya. right. THOSE SUCKERS.   You see the problem is, he must have conveniently forgot to mention that he overspent on credit cards, stayed in a up market condo and kept a mistress. In all, I tink he probably deserved it. Then again, I might be wrong. My point is, I dun owe him a living. The world doesnt owe him a living. And the local govt certainly does owe him shit! If you need to make a living, then go do it. Never blame someone else for your failures.   Haiz... finally got some shit off my chest... ANd now, I'm ready for the heavy stuff. Until next time  Adios

       Heard alot about this Bloggin thing recently, or maybe cuz i'm a little slow around the top. So i decided to give it a try.This is my first attempt, so refrain from laughing at this juvenile page... Maybe you guys can give me some hints. In fact i've been wanting to try it out for some time, cept i couldn't really get around to it.      I guess the world is really in a mess, but as I read some where in a book about Asian Wisdom...      " Don't Complain, Never Explain"      Pretty deep stuff huh? SOooo, I guess i'll just leave it at that. There's basically so much trash that we have resorted to creating a new frontier called CYBERSPACE. Hence a new era of polluting beckons... new space to corrupt and fill with our daily refuse. Dun understand a word? Try using the part of your anatomy called the BRAIN.. ahhahahahah.. I'm mean.      I guess i'm just bored today.. Thank God for Singapore Idol. At least I can have my pop- corn while laughing my head off at all those S**T-heads... Its surprising what humans would do to get that 30 secs on TV..... Sighsss...
