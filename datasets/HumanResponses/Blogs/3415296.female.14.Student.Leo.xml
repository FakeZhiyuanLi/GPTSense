      I just finished writing a post and I'm writing another one. I feel so weird. I guess I just wanted to share everything. Before I go crazy. I just want to say, Nima you don't have to feel sorry. I would've done the same thing if I were you. Any friend would do that. Anyways I'm greatful that your my friend =), well best friend. I'm going to ignore the past and live on 'til my life ends. I remember all those times I would go to my basement, hold my cordless phone, and just cry. I really don't know why. I miss all those times when I would talk to him on the phone. I would always want to call. Like today, he didn't come to school, and what I usualy did was call him at school to see if he was alright. Now, I don't think I could do that. I can't do that. I still care about him. He just doesn't back. That's alright though. I just wish I was sure of one thing. If he really did love me. That's all I wish to know..

      Okay I'm breathing in and out, and hopefully I'll get this right. I, Alice Lim, will talk to Safee about everything I ever wanted to say to him tomorrow. Even if it rains, I will not care because this is more important than getting wet by some rain. I will be strong. I will do what I say, even though I never do, I will. And for once I won't feel ashamed about what I am saying because what I will be saying is the truth, and I can't deny it. I just wish I had the confidence I needed.   Today I put everything that he gave me in this box. Even the stars I made, I still didn't finish making it all. I just thought that it can help me for a while. I was planning to hand it over to Nima, just for safekeeping, but then, I really wanted finish making those stars, really I did. I think I only have 100 left to go. But that's still 100. I remember yesturday I wrote [ 95 - 1053 ] on my name. 95 days, meant something. It was the number of days me and Safee was together. The numberof days where we were more than friends. 1053, the number of days I've known him since the beginning to the last day of grade 8. Some people say I should still give it to him, the stars I mean. I guess that's for what I feel about in the end.   I was talking to Nima on the phone and he said he was worried because he thought Joey sound upset over the phone. I didn't know what was happening, so I couldn't say I knew what he was going through. I just told him that whatever she's upset or thinking about, their love is going to conquer it all. I know that line seems tacky, but it's the truth. Their love is so true, and even someone like me can figure that out. They can work it out together, I know they can. Because they're both strong. I was then talking to Joey on MSN and she said that there were some doubts between them. I said that everyone had their doubts during a relationship, but it doesn't stop you from loving the person. I knew that they would fix this one thing immediately, it's just common sense. Love is common sense. Something that you just know. It doesn't take much thinking to know.   That's what I wanted to know from someone, but I never asked. I was too afraid, but now I'm not. I'm not that little girl who would be afraid of every little thing. I'm stronger now, from the person I was yesturday. Thanks to everyone and the experiences I went with them.

      Now, I am sure of it. I called Safee that we should go out to the park, just one last talk. Since he said he wanted to on MSN the other day, but I had to go. I was sure today was the day where I was going to say that we shouldn't get back together, and why I was acting the way I was when we were going out. I wanted to tell him everything like I did on my blog. But I couldn't. We said we'd meet at three, at lilac grove, or as he calls it the "strawberry" park. I really have no clue why he calls it that. I left early, and was at the spot where we were first together. The pond. I felt so relaxed, like nothing could go wrong. But already a lot of things did go wrong. I talked to myself, saying what I should say to him.    I don't really care what we are anymore Safee, either if we're enemies, or friends, I just don't want you to lie to me. I don't want to have a relationship with any person, either if it's friends or more, I want honesty. I want a lot of things. That's why I'm sorry. I expected too much out of you. And I'm sorry for it. I'm sorry for everything that happened. I'm sorry I couldnt hold on to you...   After I thought that, I cried. I wiped them before Safee saw me. I walked over to the park and he wasnt there, I wanted to walk back to the pond. Then I had a feeling he came, and I looked back and saw him coming towards me. I walked to him. We talked. Walked over to the pond, that place where we shared something special. We were throwing rocks, having a competition of course. And he won, obviously. I'm getting weak. We actually just talked about stupid things, as usual. At the end, he said, "I don't think we should be together." I said yea, we shouldnt if we like other people. "We" didn't refer to me. I didn't have any feelings towards anyone else. The funny thing is, I've never felt so much in love than with any person other than Safee. I guess love makes you blind, but I'm not going to let one relationship break my spirit and motivation. All I think is that God created me to have this to give me experience, to let me find someone else special. For now, I guess I can look at the stars and think of joy, than think about sadness..

      Today, everything was the same. I felt different, but I was still the same person. The same person I was yesturday, but what I felt was different. I felt freedom. Not physical freedom, but emotionally yes. I was able to let go, be a different someone in heart. I was finally able to breathe. Finally able to say, "I care about this", and not think about Safee. Not think about the times where we were together, or the times where we had our moments, but the times where we were friends. I wanted it to last, and it did. People think it's completely over, but really we're not. We're still the same people when we were friends. I went to the park so I could just have some time alone. Everywhere I went just reminded me of how much fun we had. The pond, where we told that we loved each other, the rock we sat on alone, laughing at your crummy jokes, and the place where we ended it. Really, I was sad. I wanted to cry again, I kept it in. I told myself to be strong, as usual. And it worked. I said he moved on and I should to. That's when I realized, I already did. I just never found in my mind the place where I moved on. All I could find was how much I cared about him, how much I loved him..   Now, I feel different. Freedom. That's the word for it all. Freedom from the misery I was put through, but really it was experience. Experience I will never forget about. Bad memories, but great memories too...

      I didn't write a blog for a while. I guess I was too tired to write even before the days. Sudbury was okay for me. I just wish at times I was back home. By myself, alone. The first day wasn't that fun I have to admit, mainly educational. Bowling was okay too. Just wish it was 10 pin instead of 5. Second day, really educational. Going all over these science related places. I was sure that I was going to die from too much information going into my brain. Third day, I would say would have to be the best. The ocean view was so clear and peaceful. I was out on the deck the whole time. I needed some alone time, that's what I guess I'm trying to say.   The whole trip would've been really fun for me. Because it was to everyone else. I was just trying to look at the bright side. But sometimes I can't, even though when I try my hardest, the light just comes to slip past me. All I see is darkness no matter how hard I try. I don't know what's wrong with me, really. I just can't get my mind to be in focus. Everytime I would want to be fine I wouldn't be able to. It's like I'm somewhere where I can't escape. I's so stupid. I was down and I made my friends feel that way. I made the trip bad for them at times. I feel so bad. I guess all I can say is sorry. I truly am. They were having so much fun, but I complained. I ruined it. I'm so sorry. Sometimes I wish I had no friends. I don't want to hurt them. I really don't, but sometimes I do, even when I try my hardest not to. Somehow I do. But when I rethink it, without them I'm nothing. I wouldn't be human. I wouldn't be..me. I would be someone else I can't even recognize.   I really want to just walk around screaming my head off saying.."I'm okay" but I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I tell myself I'm happy. I tell others I am, but really, deep inside of me I'm not. It's like I was torn apart, and I think I am now. So much happened.   On May 25th, I talked to him after school. Because the days before that we wanted to get back together, but after what I've seen and what I've heard from my friends. It doesnt seem like he did. I said during our walk that we shouldn't plan to be together if he wants to be with someone else, I knew he wanted to, and I'm not complaining. I've lost something, and that's it. He said that he only wanted to be with me and was trying to now to fix his problems before we go out. I really trusted him. Again. Even after I knew he liked other people. I trusted him. I don't know what made me, but I did. Someone told me that he was holding hands with her that day. And I asked him, what did you really do? He said he talked to her and that was it. Then the trust was lost again. He lied to me again. Again. He said he had to go to Shahin's, so he had to go. I just walked away. All I wanted was for him just to think about us, for once. But he couldn't, and I accept that.   Sudbury days was like torture days. I don't know why. I really thought he wanted it to work, but I guess he didn't. He didn't talk to me at all. I guess that's what he wanted. I wanted to see if he really cared. Joey said if he really loved me and cared about me, which he said he did, he would be the one taking intiative and go up to me. That didn't happen. I was alone at times, he was with his friends. He pretended I was a nobody. I guess I really am a backup, a person he goes up to when he needs someone. And I always will be, but, I don't want to be treated like I was. I know I'm selfish, but it's how I feel, and I felt like that. Like he didn't care..  The dance, was the most hardest for me. I felt the most sorry then. My friends saw me depressed, and they became that way too. I don't know anything anymore. We didnt talk the whole day. I was talking to Nima and it took so much out of me just not to let a single tear fall out. I said that, it was over, I have no hope left. It was absolutely over. But then Safee asked me to the dance, I said I didn't know, but I don't think my brain said that because I was already on the dance floor, putting my arms around his neck. What was funny was that I almost tripped during the dance. At the end of the song, I don't know how but we hugged, and walked together by the back, but said pratically nothing. When the dance ended I didn't know where he was, I guess he went to his friends. I just ran to my room. I remember telling the o4 that I wanted to go to our room during the dance, but we weren't allowed to.   The last day, was the day where we were on the boat the most of the day. And all I thought was, perfect, I can tell him what I always wanted to say, that I still loved him. But I couldn't, he didn't come to say anything. I guess that's what he wanted. I was down the whole day. I tried to look happy, and I caught a few people. All I was thinking was, I guess he made his decision. He did. Yasaman told me everything. He really didn't care about me. He cared about her. He danced with me out of pity. It was okay. I was okay. I was fine. I had no reaction. I remember when we were at mcdonald's for dinner, I wanted to buy him something because he didn't buy anything. My friends thought I was crazy. But I wanted to, even through everything I still cared about him. I came back from the washroom and Erica told me that he had no money that's why he didn't buy anything. I ran to the cashier, but she caught my hand saying, "no". I didn't care. I didn't know what was wrong with me. She said that Vincent already bought him something. At the end she told me that she bought him a pie telling me that I bought it, but I really didn't. That's when Yasi told me. I guess all I could do is say I was fine, okay, normal, whatever word you describe for it, but I really wasn't. I kept it in. I feel like a liar, all this time, I told people I was okay when I wasn't. I wanted them not to care about me, but they do, I'm so sorry.  Now, I'm really moving on. I'm sure he doesn't care, and I've accepted that. There IS more to life than this. All I know now is that I love my friends and family, and my heavenly father.

      Before I went to church I checked my email. The usuals of course, junk mail. But that was the only mail I received. I saw that I got one from Safee. I cried. Tears slid down my face once again. I'm starting to wonder if I can ever stop. All I have to to tell myself is to be strong. If he really says that he loves me, then why is everything different..why did things end?

      Today was great. I went to wonderland with Krystal, Vivian, Mark, Nima, Candace, Martin and Roger. Joey was supposed to come, but her mom said she wasn't allowed to go. I knew right away that Nima wasn't going to happy about it. He told me that he was waiting for this day for days and weeks because he was going to spend his time with her. Then it just clicked that, I was expecting this day as much as he was. It was just that many things happened in between.   I went on so many rides I've never been on. I remember telling everyone that they could go without me because I was too scared. But always one of them would be with me. I felt so lucky to have friends that cared about me. I remember when we were lining up for "mine buster", I was all down. I didn't know why, I just couldn't handle my emotions right. Everything just didn't make sense. I thought the world was going to fall apart. I really wanted to cry about everything. I know I don't even have a reason to, but for some reason that I don't even know I just wanted to. I feel so dumb, I was always the one that would comfort others when they were upset, but everything was opposite now. I really want to be the same person as I was before. In the beginning of wonderland, I just wasn't in the mood. I wanted to cry on someone's shoulder, but I'm strong enough to know that I can handle this. I can handle through what happened. I can handle through my pain, and my fears. I can handle everything. I know I'm hiding my feelings, but that's who I am, and that's one of the reasons why everything went on.   At the end of the day, Nima won like 10 prizes. All for one person of course. It was funny how he spent so much money on one game. Krystal got 2, and Vivian got 2 prizes from Mark. I didn't get any of course, I didn't want to waste my money. It was my mom's money. Nima gave me one of his stuffed animals. I said if he gave it to me because he felt sorry for me, but he said no. He said he would never give a gift out of pity. Rain started to pour. Thunder was near. Everyone that was left was cold, and was hiding from the rain. Truthfully, I wanted to stand in the rain. I thought that it would make me feel better.   I always try to look on the bright side of everything. But sometimes I don't, but I tell myself that I'm living my life, I'm controlling it, I am who I am.   I guess if I don't hide my feelings, I should say that, I still love him. I don't know why, I can't deny it, and I'm not. I just do.   Some may think I'm crazy, but real feelings don't go away in one second. It takes time.

      Today I walked home with Nima, and we talked about everything that was happening. You know he's like the best, best friend you could ever hope for you know? He's always there for you no matter what. And I'm really thankful for that. Joey's really lucky. I wanted to get away from everything. I just figured something out yesturday, and I guess I should've expected it from a certain someone. I thought that all this time, things would be different. That being with me was different. But I was wrong. I guess you could say I was expecting too much. Nima said that I'm the one that shouldn't be thinking about all this. He said I didn't do anything wrong. I don't know what to think, but I wish I could take every word he says and tell myself that it's true, but some how I think I did do a lot of things wrong. Now all I can do is regret about it.   Nima says I should give the stars to Safee, because the reason why I made all of them was to give it to him, but I don't know. I think I should, but I don't think I should. I'm just scared that he's going to do nothing with it, but throw it away. I just don't want all of that effort to go to waste. I told Nima that I'd just save it for someone special later on in the future, but he said that I made the stars for one purpose and that was to give it to Safee. I wish I could be as confident as he is, but I'm not. I guess I'll just wait and see if I will or not.   Every second of every day, I just can't get my mind off one thing. I want to really bad, but I just can't. I have too many memories for me to forget, good memories, great memories. Last night, I remember praying to God, that everything would end of great for me. I told Him not to listen to my prayer because there are many children like me that have much worse conditions. I just needed to tell my feelings to someone, and the Lord is who I want to talk to. I don't know why, but tears slid down my face. All I could do was wipe them away. I had no reason to cry. I had a reason to happy. I could say those tears were from happiness, but they weren't. I don't know how to explain everything. I can't believe this, but I'm crying right now. I wish nothing happened, but it did, and I'm taking nothing for granted. I just want to pray to God for everything to be fine for me and my friends.

      For the first time in my life, I was actually thinking hard. Thinking about everything. Friends, Life, School. Everyone seemed sad today. I don't know what's going on, but I really want to help them all. Except I can't. I'm only one person. One individual. I was thinking about Vivian because she seemed really depressed today. I tried to comfort her, but I knew Mark would do a better job than me. To me, I'm clueless at times. And that was one time where I was.   I guess everyone has that phase going through them. Lots of people think I do too, but in my opinion I really don't think I do. Whenever I look upset, it's not because of something that hurt me, however something that affected me. All the times when I see sad faces, I feel upset. I don't know why but I just do. I guess it's who I am.  So many people sympathized me today. I really don't know how I feel. If I'm sad, happy, angry, relaxed. I think I just didn't get the time to organize how I felt about everything. I walked home today, as usual and walked to the pond that's next to my house. I went to the same place, the same spot, the same position, and just relaxed. I wanted to feel the wind, and the air that was around me. For a while, it was as if I was in a place where there wasn't any sadness, but a place where you can truly be happy. Even though that's one place to be truly happy, I still think that my life is happy. Everything around me is going to come to an end, like our lives. You know that one day you're going to go above the clouds and onto heaven. When I reach that special place, I'm going to find eternal happiness.   I think I should make my post related to the title. You know what I think now? I really think this was right. Even though at first I wasn't thinking straight, I know that God created things to be this way. Like all my other posts, life is meant to be planned but not by us. I was thinking about all the times where Safee was upset, and he said it wasn't because of me, but it was. And I accept that. I didn't make him happy. But I know when he loves someone else, he going to make her happy, and she's going to give all that he wanted. =). I'm just glad that for once I'm going to see a smile on his face. For once I won't have to worry, but I still will as a friend. I want him to be happy..  I guess that's all I want to say today. I just had to get that out of me. Because life is like a circle. It's never ending. Once it begins, it just keeps on going on.

      I just thought of everything. Sudbury, Graduation, everything. I know, I'm being weird. I just wrote a post and I'm writing another one. But I really had to get my feelings out, and here is the best way. I would in a diary, but then my finger is like demented and typing is fun. I looked over to my right. It was my number one goal to finish. Stars. The stars I was planning to make all those months ago. I had just thought about all the time I put through, but I guess the stars are my motivation too. You see, before everything happened. I knew that high school would be a big step between me and..Safee. So I told myself that I needed to give something to him. I didn't want to buy him something, because any ordinary person can do that. I really wanted this to be special. So here I was, day after day making these stars. My goal to make: 1053, what I've completed: 928. I needed 125 more. I really thought I could do it, and I can. I have what it takes. 1053 1053 1053..that was the amount of days I knew him. Well, the amount of days I was supposedly supposed to know him. I wanted to give it to him at the last day of school, the 24th. That'll be exactly 1053 days. I guess I can look at the stars now, and instead of thinking about an individual, I can think about the amount of effort I put forth in it. I remember a couple months back, I was so determined that I wanted to give him the amount of days I've first met him to the day of Valentine's, but that didn't exactly work out. I guess sleeping at 6 didn't help much. I only completed half of what I was aiming for. I'm still proud of myself. I actually accomplished something that meant a lot to me.   I feel so idiotic right now. But I feel really happy for my best friend Nima and his girlfriend Joey, also known as my sister and advisor =). They have everything under control and I know I'm going to sound like a mother, but it's really great to see them like this. I remember when Nima was still down with everything that was going on with him, but now his face just lights up, I know he's happy and truly in love with his perfect Joey =). I guess they were meant to be. Same with my o4 bff bud vivo, she's got to be happy. I know she's been going through some problems herself, but she's holding it together with Mark. I remember telling vivian today that she had to make her o4 buds her bridemaids in her wedding. =).   Sudbury. 7 days. Okay I shouldn't have done that. That was scary. As you can see I can be odd at times. I was going to sit with Safee on the coach, but either way I wouldn't be able to. However, krystal's class will be split and will probably be on my coach. Graduation is 33 more days away. I'm so scared. I was aiming for an award, but I know I won't get one. My dad has faith in me though, so I won't think negatively, and Safee told me not to think that way, so I won't.   I've heard a lot of things from people. And I know it's true. I've noticed things myself, believe it or not. I just wish that, I guess it wouldn't matter. Wishing doesn't turn things into reality. I'm going to accept it and move on, just like everything else that went wrong in my life. I guess I feel much better now. Thanks to all the people that cared for me and loved me, it'll always be in my mind and in my heart forever. You guys are my life and what makes it complete.

      I guess I was acting like an idiot today. I should've just, gone up to him and told him straight about how I felt, but I couldn't. Im so stupid. I'm so stupid. I'm so stupid. I guess time does really pass by fast..I remember in grade 7, all the good times. We were really close friends, I could say even best friends, but I guess feelings change, and that's what's got us this far. So I'm greatful, I really am. I was able to have someone who cared about me, into someone who loved me. I feel like I am blessed. Everything was planned ahead. Destiny, Love, Life, it's all planned. We don't get to have a say, but our thoughts and our actions are what the future is going to be.   I regret something today. I know it wouldn't have made anything different, or any changes of the his mind, but I wish I got to tell him everything I ever wanted to. I'm not regretting or beating myself up because of what happened. Everything was meant to be the way it is. I think love wasn't something every person can have. However, something special that only some carry. I had it, and I lost it. I don't want to go back in the past because if I do, everything's going to be different. As much as it hurts, I can live. I have my whole life to look forward to, unless I die tomorrow because I get hit by a car, then that's a different story.   I guess what I'm trying to say, is that, my feelings won't change. Everythings a blur. But I'll know when the times right. I know when everything will be fine. I wish everything was the way I wanted it, but it's not. I'm just gonna keep on living. All I know is that, whatever path Safee or whoever takes, I know it'll be the right one. =)

      After school he told me that we needed to talk. He asked if he should call me or if I should call back. With everything going on with my parents, I said I'd call him. And so I did, but he wasn't home. I called again around 9 and no one picked up. I knew I had to talk to him so I called once more, and his brother got the phone and got Safee on the phone for me. I said that we needed to talk and that he needed to talk to me. It took us a while to actually get on track, since the whole time he was trying to scare me with his "7 days" phase. He knows I'm scared of these things easily.   I finally said, we have to talk, and we did. I said, so what did you want to talk to me about? He said that for the past few days we didn't exactly talk. I knew what he meant because that was on my mind for all the spare time I had to think about it. I didn't know what to say and ended up saying, "so what are we gonna so about it?" He didn't know and I didn't know. It seems that everything became more complicated. We talked about how other relationships with other people were going great but ours wasn't. I said, "maybe we should just.." , he caught me off saying "no". I didn't know what to do again. I was just frustrated and so was he.   I honestly want him to know how I feel, but I guess I just can't. I don't know how to say everything that's going in my head. It's just like what he said, "I know what to say, but I don't know how to put it in words.." I really do want this to work, I love him, and that's all I know...  We ended up hanging up, and it just wasn't what I wanted it to be, but like I said earlier "Life isn't perfectly planned out, we just have to accept the way it is." I don't know what tomorrow brings, but I hope we can work it out so we can be like the way we were before. I love him too much to lose him now..

      It's another day, and it just seems that every place I go, every person I see, I see faces with sadness. I was thinking to myself and was asking what is wrong with them..maybe I can help, but life isn't like that. We have to accept the way everything is. Everything you see around you was meant to be that way or had its own purpose. You can't change a certain thing because you dislike it. Just accept it...  That's what I've been telling myself for my entire life. I know somethings aren't all fair in life, but what I learned to do was to appreciate it. Some may think I'm crazy, but it's true. I always tell myself that "it could be worse". I've gone through some rough times in my life too..but I've learned to overcome them and that's how I became the person I am today. I remember a year ago a really close friend of mine and me got into this huge fight. It was all these rumours flying around that got to her, but I accepted it. As long as I knew I didn't do anything wrong I was a-ok. I knew that she'll realize soon that I'm not that type of person. And here I am today with my best friends ever: the o4 (krystal vivian and ashley) also can't forget about nima. I can't forget yasi, she was always there for me no matter what and was there through all my problems, shes my sister, and joey shes my advisor. And I just want to thank elayne because she helped me be with someone special. There the ones that got me this far and I know that their my motivation.  Over the past few days I was thinking about a lot of things. You see, I love this person..and at times it just gets to me that maybe in one point in our lives, that he might not love me anymore. I try not to think about the future and think about now. I have to admit at times I get messed up and it's because of him, but I'm not complaining. I remember I told him how I felt about flirting. That day was great I was finally able to get something off my chest. Days after that the same topic came in my head. It confused me. Everything seemed to make me confused. I talked to him again..but this time everything turned my world upside down. We didn't speak for a while, and that really killed a part of me. I knew that it wasn't going to change who I was or the person I would become, but a little part of me was just tored apart. I remember after that day ended I talked to Nima and he comforted me as always, and I was thankful.   I had a talk with him, and it took a while, but we got through that phase together. I now it's dumb or stupid or whatever, but sometimes I feel that he doesnt care for me. I know he does but it seems different sometimes. I know I'm being really picky and paranoid, but it's like all this time I was a nobody. When we have time to be together, we aren't together. Instead we're apart. Him with his friend and me with mine. I'm not saying we cant be with our friends, but his schedule is different than mine. This is dumb but it seems lk all the time in his life is devoted to his friends. I don't have a problem with it, but, I wish their was time for me, and their probably is but I'm too dumb to realize it. If his schedule was out of ten, I would be o.1 of his time. I know I'm lucky to even have someone to love me, and I truly am...sometimes I just don't feel that I could handle it. However I still keep telling myself that what I'm doing it right, to be with him is right.   Even through all the doubts and all the troubles, I know we can get through this together. All I know is that I love you Safee..

      I forgot to mention, I must watch Spiderman 2 when it comes out on June 30th. I don't care if I have to wait there for 100 hours. Oh no I forgot. I was supposed to go to Sara's house. Well I'll have to see now that I remind myself =P. Off for now.

      No matter how much I don't want the days to pass by, they stil do. All I could do is except that it is. Graduation's over obviously. Yesturday was a hectic day. Really. I woke up at 5 that morning. I just did. I couldn't go back to sleep, so I started reading until it was 7 I fell back asleep. I had to wake up at 8. So I slept about 5 hours that day. I had to go to school to finish painting the banner and making the "ticket" box for our gradutaion. After doing all that I went home ate lunch and waited till it was 2. I went to my hair place where they did all these loopy things. They put way to much makeup on me I started to freak out. Right when I got into the car I wiped all or almost all the makeup I had on me. I put on my dress and was on my way to Graduation. I was a little late and when I was there all my friends were there to greet me. They were all screaming "OMG ALICE". So that was a scary moment there for me. It took a while before we walked down the aisle. My feet were already killing me so much. I thought I was going to collaspe any time soon. When I walked down the aisle with Shokur I saw Ms McKenzie. My grade 5 teacher. She was the best. She was really tough but taught me a lot about studies, but also about life. I didn't feel very confident. I felt upset though. I was scared I wasn't going to make my parents proud. I know they'll say that as long as I try my best, but honestly I know that they would prefer me to win something, or that particular award that everyone was saying I would get. I just didn't have that confidence though. When the awards were given out I was nervous. The science award was introduced and me and Jacqueline won it. I was disappointed. I don't really know why.   The ceremony was over and parents were taking pictures and were off back home, while their kids were ready to party off. I didn't feel so excited. I could almost say throughout the whole time I didn't feel anything. I kept on tripping over my dress. At least I didn't fall. I saw Safee. I didn't talk to him. Everyone was having fun. You can see it in their faces. I felt happy for them. Safee came up to me and we just walked about awards, how everything was going. It wasn't exactly like before. Obviously. I didn't expect it to be. I realized that he didn't love me when he said he did. Love, is a complicating word. A word where it means you're willing to do anything. A word where you mean it as long as you live. A word of eternity. I know of course that grade 8 love can't possibly stay till we're 100 or so, but to me, some how, it did. And I thought he did too. No matter what he had in the past. I had faith in him. I had trust in him. A couple hours passed and it was over. Graduation was over. I felt nothing. Just the feeling of being with my friends. Honestly, that didn't even make me like myself. During the slow dances I would usually walk alone outside. Just looking at the rain. I didn't want to bring my memories back. I didn't want to cry.  Today, was the same old. We got our yearbooks today. There was a little problem. It had the spirals when we ordered not to have them. But we can't do anything about it. We handed them out and started writing our feelings about the following years and how we're going to be so nervous for high school. I received two yearbooks. One for me, and one for Safee. When we were going out, I knew he didn't order a yearbook so I ordered one for him. I wanted him to know that this year was really special to me, and I thought it to be for him. I wanted him to remember grade 8. When I got my yearbook I didn't know whether I should still give it to him or not. I sort of just stared at it. I guess I'll see in the last day of school. Yasi told me that he got a yearbook. I was confused because he never ordered one. Then she checked and he didn't order but he still got yearbook. Mistakes. When she got it back from him it already had autographs in them. She said if I was still planning to get one for him I should sign my name in his yearbook that already had it's autograph. I didn't know what to do so I just said, it doesn't matter. She said she would tell him to pay the 20 dollars for his yearbook. Later she said he changed his mind. I said, "but it already has writing on it, we can't return it" I was confused. I think now he doesn't have a yearbook. I don't know.   Nima said he had to talk to me. I walk walking home and so was he so I said that we'd talk then. But then I saw my dad. So I said sorry to Nima and went. Then I thought, "Am I stupid or what? Offer you're best friend, who lives across the street from you, if he wants a ride". It was sort of like a slap in the face for being so dumb. He didn't finish writing in my yearbook so I told him to keep it over night and to give it back on thursday, since tomorrow is Ontario Place.  I just remembered that I don't even have a bathing suit. My got to small. Poor me. It doesn't matter much since I don't like swimming, water stuff. Maybe just the rides though, they're fun. Wonderland on the 26th. I don't think I'm ever going to be back to my normal self. Either I'm maturing into a sad person or I'm still thinking about everything that's happening...

      It seems like as the days go by I write less and less in my blog. I think it's because I'm so tired these days. Stressing about graduation and all sorts of things. I can't believe I wrote that in my other blog. But..I guess it is true. I do. I really do. No matter what I do, that feeling is never going to be gone. I'm folding stars right now. I bought more. I don't even know why. I guess I wanted to finish my goal. I have to recount all of those all over again. I forgot how many I made. I want to talk to him again. Like we did before. All those times when we would laugh together, on the phone. Those were the times I'll always miss. All those times when he would comfort me when I was feeling down, or insecure. Those were the times I'll miss. All those times when he said I had nothing to worry about, those times when I knew he cared about me. Those were the times I'll miss. The moments where I knew he loved me, I'll miss.

      I guess it's not one thing, but these lyrics really touched me, same with the other song. "Underneath" by Jessica Simpson.  Sometimes it's hard when you're so deep inside To see all you can lose in a blink of an eye Dreams could be shattered You could be gone How would I survive Cause you're where I belong My soul-believer Without you, I don't know who I would be  Underneath, I can feel you move through me Inside out, you surround me I breathe you like I'm taking my last breath You're everything I know So how could I let you go  Sometimes I listen to a voice that isn't mine I disconnect from everything inside And I have made choices And wasted all the days I could have been with you Where my heart stayed I know you've waited faithfully Blessing our love even stronger  Underneath, I can feel you move through me Inside out, you surround me I breathe you like I'm taking my last breath Oh, you're everything I know So how could I let you go  And I've been blessed For every kiss For every breath And I've been touched, By hands I trust My love is risen  Underneath, I can feel you move through me Inside out, you surround me I breathe you like I'm taking my last breath You're everything I know So how could I let you How could I let you go  I don't know why I like it, I just do. I read the email again. I really have to stop doing that. I'm so scared. So worried. So..I don't know. I don't know. All I know is that, I miss him. I miss him so much.

      I didn't blog for one week. I feel so ashamed of myself. I guess I was busy most of the time, or either I couldn't just get all my feelings straight. Either way, I'm one weird person. So's it's been exactly one week since I blogged. Don't worry Joey I got your message. I guess the past week was hectic. With graduation coming along and projects and last minute tests coming in, everything became so confusing. Talking about tests, I have a french dictionary test tomorrow. I forgot to think about 5 sentences that makes me glad there's french in the world. I really don't think it's handy now. I bet Nima's going to kill me now. =). I mean writing 5 sentences about how I'm greatful french is here, is useless. But the language is totally cool. Now I'm sounding like a maniac. Maybe I am. I don't even know who I am.   We let's talk about yesturday since that's the only thing I remember. I went to TandT Supermarket with Karen, Zoe, and Annie. We bought a whole lot of drinks for our 3-D figurine of future york region. I remember after buying everything we had to drink all of it. I think it was around 70 drinks or so. We all had to go to the bathroom at least 100 times after that. I still have to finish up some pop. My stomach is going to explode one day because of all this carbonated drinks. I came home around at 5, and talked to my parents, spending some family time together. I told my parents that I'm really scared about graduation. I'm scared I'm going to let them down. They said they don't care what result I get as long as I tried my hardest, and honestly I have. I've been giving it my all. I know I'm sounding like a person who's in need of an award, but that's not it. My family, from Canada all the way to Korea, is depending on me. I know they don't want to put pressure on me, but I know they want me to get an award. Or at least expect me to get one. I'm so scared. That was pratically all that was going in my head for the past few days. I remember I couldn't sleep these past days. I know, I'm stupid, I don't have a reason to worry because it's only grade 8. But this is something I want to get. My goal. Since I knew my brother got valedictorian, I was so determined to be like him, and my dad. I feel like I can't live up to them. It's hard.  After our conversation and me panicking, I really needed to talk to a friend. I was going to call Nima, but I had a feeling he wasn't home. I went on MSN, hoping Joey or the o4 was on. They were all away. Safee came on. So I said "hey..it's been forever since we talked." He agreed. I don't know. I didn't feel all panicky anymore. Safee didn't even know what was wrong with me. I just, sort of, got calm. My worries just faded. I still never got to tell him what I always wanted to. Tell him everything that was wrong. I still didn't. I don't think I should. I decided this a long time ago. I had to go later on and I said I was sorry about everything. He said wait. I just wrote some dots. He said nevermind and said he'd talk to me tomorrow, which is very unlikly.   I was correct of course. Well, at recess. I was pratically dead. I wanted to lterally sleep outside. I guess I did a little too much thining. So I just put my head down. I heard Safee saying Alice like 100 times. I forgot what I did. I think I was half asleep. Then Erica whispered, "is he trying to get you back or something?". I just chuckled. It was funny. Then Erica and Annie tickled me. Well, of course I laughed and went crazy. Usual me. After that. I don't know where Safee was. I think he walked back to his friends. Well I stood up because I thought we were going to talk. But my instints were incorrect. He walked back to his friends. I guess that's what happens when you're half dead. I talked to him again on MSN. I said "seems like I'm always the one saying hi =P *safee's scared of me*". He said he was "going" to say hi but thought I was ticked off. I was like "ticked off...?" He said "You know, angry, mad, pissed off". Then I said "wow, you really don't know me do you lol" I meant it as a joke. I think he took it the wrong way because he said it was a mean thing to say. I said I was confused. Then he said to pretend that never happened. So I was super confused. I asked Joey, Nima, and Krystal if I get pissed easly. Answers "not exactly, no", "h-e-double hockey sticks no", "no what are you talking about?". I trusted them. They would never lie to me. I told them the story since they asked why I asked. Krystal said that he probably got a bit pissed because we went out, and I just said that he didn't know me. Joey said that he probably took it the wrong way. Nima said that I did the right thing. After that I felt bad. I started blaming myself. It was sort of funny if you think about it. We forgot that happened, but it was still in my head. He asked if I still liked "The Reason". I was like OF COURSE ARE YOU CRAZY? I said the lyrics rocked. He said, "Yea I guess it has a meaning to it." Then he copied and pasted the lyrics and wrote "...". I was like, I wonder what's wrong with him? Maybe the lyrics got to him. I dont know.  Nima had some problems or some worries. I could tell. He wasn't as high as he normally is. I couldn't talk to him because he went offline. Joey will make him smile or get his worries away, so I have nothing to worry about =). O yea, I forgot to mention here, "CONGRATS NIMA, VALE!". And also congrats to Katherine. You guys are cool. hehe.   I have a feeling this blog is really long so I guess I'll end it here.  I just want to say, thanks you guys. You guys are the best. I know I say it everyday and everytime I have a chance, but it's true. Without you guys and everyone else, I'd be seriously, dead. So thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for putting up with my crazy problems. Thank you for always being there for me. Thank you for being my friend.  Thank you for everything.

      Lyrics from Avril Lavigne..It just touched me. I wanted you to read the lyrics.  "Slipped Away"    I miss you, miss you so bad I don't forget you, it's so sad I hope you can hear me I remember it clearly  The day you slipped away Was the day I found it won't be the same   I didn't get around to kiss you Goodbye on the hand I wish that I could see you again I know that I can't  I hope you can hear me cause I remember it clearly  The day you slipped away Was the day I found it won't be the same  I had my wake up Won't you wake up I keep asking why And I can't take it It wasn't fake It happened, you passed by  Now your gone, now your gone There you go, there you go Somewhere I can't bring you back Now your gone, now your gone There you go, there you go, Somewhere your not coming back  The day you slipped away Was the day I found it won't be the same The day you slipped away Was the day that i found it won't be the same   I miss you   I remember talking to Yasi yesturday. I said that I got teary because I read the email again. I didn't mean to. You know when you delete mail it goes to the next mail. That's when i read it. I don't know what's wrong with me, really. I guess it's the fact that, I believed in everything so easily. Some people say, just ignore everything he said because it was all lies. I'm thinking it now. He never loved me. Yasi said that I loved him but he didn't. I guess she's right. I was half way walking home with Nima. Well, we met each other when we were pratically at our houses. We were just talking about him and Joey. I remember at the end of the day, Nima gave the polar bear with a rose to Joey. It was so sweet. She was really happy. Jacqueline thought they were going to kiss. I just laughed. I walked home really fast today. Before I was with Nima. Safee, Anoosh, and Jordan were ahead of me, but I went first. I was speed walking pratically. I wanted to go to the pond, but it was too hot. I just noticed that I could see it from my room.  I watched Lord of the Rings, Return of the King, and there was one saying Frodo said around the end of the story. It was about life, the past, present, future. He said that once something happens, you can't go back. Of course, he says this because of his experiences with the Ring. For me, I would say it's about everything. But Frodo said, all you could do is keep on going. He's right, that's what I'm going to do.

      I'm talking to a couple of people on MSN right now. Today Joey told me that she didn't even like Safee. I was in total shock. Joey said that Nima asked her and she said she didn't have any feelings for him. Now, I felt really sorry for him. What made me confused was that, they were going out and she didnt have any feelings for him. Later Konica told me that she told her that she was using him and was planning to dump him before graduation. I didn't know what was going on. Now, I really really felt sorry for him. Some say that he gets what he deserves, but I don't think that. I mean, I don't think it's his fault for having feelings for someone. You can't help from liking someone. Sometimes, it's just a feeling, your mind can't tell you to stop, because your heart keeps on telling you to. So I don't think he deserve anything.   Later Konica told me that someone told her that they weren't going out. Now, my head hurted. But her not liking him was true. If they were going out, Joey said that I should tell him. I said I couldn't do that because I didn't want to interfere with any relationships, except that relate to me. A lot of people told me to tell him. I didn't want to, actually I couldn't. Either way I'm not.   My friends say that I shouldn't even feel sorry for him at all. One of the o4` said that now he's going to know how I felt. I said, "I don't want him to go through what I went through." I know that sounded lame, but I was serious. When I think about it now, I don't even know what I went through, but I know it wasn't happy thoughts or memories. But my friends got me through it, even when I thought I couldn't. Yasi finally made me spill the beans. She knew I wasn't well about everything that was happening. I finally told her that I was lying to her. I felt really bad. I was always telling her that I was alright. When really, I wasn't. I was in some points in my life, and some points I wasn't. Different feelings always mess me up. She said she knew what I meant, she's so understanding. Same with everyone else. I feel so lucky to have friends that care about me so much. Even when it's about the littlest or dumbest things ever.   Nima and Joey, my best friend and sis, are doing well, well duh. Anyone who can't see that has some issues. I feel so happy for them both. I mean, some people can't find that love at an age like this. But they did, I'm greatful. Even though it's not happening to me. It's happening to them and it affects me in a way. It just makes me smile.   I guess that's what I wanted Safee to do. I just hope the rumours aren't true. I just want him happy, because I couldn't make him smile.

      I was in a total crisis today. I begged Mr. Leung to postpone the  math test on Monday, since everyone has been begging me to change the date. I tried, for around the hour, giving reasons of changing it, but he wouldn't change his mind. Later, I said, "You didn't give us back our homework, and we need those to study." I really thought I nailed it big this time. He said there would be time at the end of the day for him to give it back. I argued saying, "But we only have 5 minutes left, and we're still not done the races." I have good comebacks I have to admit. But at times, I can be the most dumbest person alive. The bell rang, and that meant the day was over. I said, "Yay now our test is on Monday, Mr. Leung said it wasn't. I was so shocked, I was thinking how could all those people on the buses leaving get their homework papers? I didn't know what to do. He talked to Ms Oberoi and they agreed that the test would be tomorrow, but only percentage would be on Monday.   I feel like the biggest nerd now. I'm talking about how panicky I was about the Math test. What made things worse was that my playing test was tomorrow too. I came upstairs and Mrs. Arbo said that all the flutes were gone. I was about to die. I said my test was tomorrow, and I couldn't go any earlier because I was helping with track. She said all I could do was come early the next day and practise. I really thought I was going to die now. I was freaking out. I started panicking and walked back and forth, probably hyperventilating? I'm not very sure.   I was in the hallway and people were handing out our math homework. I saw Safee and Anoosh walking by. They both came to the big crowd of people getting their homeworks. I didn't know why I did it, but I took Safee's trumpet, and started to crazy. He already knew I was crazy. I guess that's what happens when stress comes pouring out of you. We talked about weird things and came out of the school together. We still have the funny, silly,weird friendship relationship, that I got to admit. Joey saw us and whispered to me if I was going to talk to him about "stuff". I knew what she meant, I said I didn't know. I really didn't know. She asked Safee, "Are you going to walk her home?" And what shocked me was, he said "yes". I said that my house was far, I say that every time obviously.   So we walked, well I was way ahead since I was going crazy and was carrying him trumpet and skateboard for him. He was injured so he couldn't catch up, I feel so proud =). We were at his street and I thought,  okay bye now , but that wasn't it. He actually really meant it. That he was going to walk me home. All I thought was,  Wow this is his first time that he ever did that.  When we got to my house, I didn't go. I never went home directly from school. I always to went to some places that kept me from forgetting my memories, of..us. We walked all the way to Headwaters, Safee said if I wanted to go to Kelvin's house with him. I said I didn't know him and it would be rude if I did. I said I had to walk him there because of kidnappers, then he said that I should be the one worried about kidnappers. We got to Kelvin's and I was on my way to leave. But that wasn't it again. He said to wait for him because he was going to walk me home. I said no, obviously. That's just plain rude if you say, okay walk me home. I walked away and he asked me if I wanted him to again. I said it was okay. Does it mean a yes or no? I said no quietly, but really I did want him too. He didn't argue. When I said bye, I also wanted to say "congratulations.." and walk away, but I couldn't.  Congrats to you and her, now I don't see the sad you, but who you really are..  I walked home alone. I didn't even know why I thought this for a split second, but I thought he was going to run after me, stupid huh? I guess so. I was just planning to go to the pond, but I didn't.  I just walked home alone..

      Talking on the phone with Nima now, well not exactly. We're both busy blogging. All I can here is typing. He told me to replay "The Voice Within", because I was listening to it earlier. I asked why, he said it gave him the feeling to think. Today Alex told me to not even think about Safee. I asked why, he gave me one simple line. He's going out with her. I wasn't that shocked about hearing it. I was expecting it. Just not this soon. I guess time moves fast. Or I'm taking a while to get back to the regular me.   Yesturday I asked him why he wasn't there. He said he waited for a second and didn't see me so he left to walk her home. I didn't complain. I just wish I knew that because I was waiting at school for an hour for him. I thought he was going to come back. I was wrong. Krystal told me to go to her house and call him there. I did, and he wasn't home. He was still walking her home. At the end of our conversation, he had to go and sent me one single line of words, "petals will crumble from this rose and will rot to dust like so has our love washin away from us". I really had an odd reaction. The first thing coming to my mind was,  I rather not have you say that . But he did. I guess he wanted to make it clear.   I'm talking to Ashley and Krystal on MSN. They said I should make him feel bad for what he did. But I don't want to. I would never want to. I just want him to be happy with her. I wanted to tell him everything, about us before, but it's too late now. I wanted to say everything before it happened, but it did. I can't say anything. I can't say what I wanted to. I guess this really is over.   ashwee*_ you never realized how much she loved you   [ o4`=bff] says: if he loved you and you guys broke up, he'll still think abt you.. he cant get over you in one week!  alice - lotr.freak.show.

'oo2 [ o4`=bff ][ 95 - 1053 ][ i really just wish.. ] says: he just said it..cuz his mind said he did..but his heart belonged to someone else  That was our conversation. That's how I feel now. However, it doesnt hurt me anymore. Like it before. Now, I'm just me. I'm back to myself, where I didn't love him. I am me.

      I guess he forgot that we had to talk, because he wasn't there after school. My guess, he forgot or he was eager to walk her home. That was the answer, second guess. I asked him to wait for me after school because I wanted to talk to him. I came out of school and he was gone. I waited there 'til 4 I guess. Later I waited at Krystal's house. We called his house, he wasn't home. Walking home someone probably. It was 4:30, so I left her house and started walking home. Met Vincent on the way, he asked why I was walking home now. I said I was waiting for someone, but they never showed up. He probably thought I was crazy. I walked all the way to Headwaters, when I realized that I didn't need to. I passed through the pond, I sat there for a while. Walked back home, and settled on from there.  I guess he doesn't even want to be friends. I understand that he wants to be with someone else, but just for one day I wanted to talk. As friends. I don't know anymore. That's probably why he was ignoring me on the Sudbury trip. The boat ride was different. He would be the opposite of me from everywhere. If I was on the second floor, him the first. It just goes on from there. Krystal tells me not to think about him, she says he's stupid. I don't think that. I guess he just has different feelings.   Ashley saved me today. I have to thank her a lot. Without her I think I would be dead by now. Anoosh just MSGed me. He said if I was okay. I said I was fine and showed that I had a happy face on. I don't know. I really don't know. I guess that's it. I just don't know about everything..

      Long time coming..my favourite song, but the one and only Oliver James. I don't have a lot of time anymore to type my thoughts out. I'm always busy because I have work and I have tutor, and with everything else I have going on with my life.   My grandma has problems with her brain. One part of her brain isn't functioning. She forgets things a lot really fast. And everytime I see her in the nursing home, I just want to cry. I wish that God will bless her and make her feel better. She's fine and healthy, but she can't walk and can't remember me or my family. Only my grandpa. My mom and my family consistly remind her who we are, then she remembers, but the next day, it seems like we didn't even visit her..   Theres a lot of things going on in my life. I just realized that Safee has a girlfriend, and I wish the best of luck to him and..um his girlfriend..don't know her name so I can't really say haha. A couple people told me, and one person *not named hehe* told me he asked her around the end of june..or before he went on his trip to the States. I'm glad he was able to get over things fast. Well he was the person to break up with me right? haha. I'm so weird at times. Actually correctiong, I'm weird all the time.   I watched "Win a date with Tad Hamilton" with Candace after our usual tutor with Mr. Leung, which I must say that it's getting tougher each time *test on monday ahhhhh*..and there was this one part where the main character said, "You don't love me, you love the image of me, but you have to love someone for their details..." And I guess that's what happened, really. I loved him, I admit. Not just love him, I was in love with him. I guess he just said it, maybe got caught in the moment. Someone told me why he broke up with me, and I trust her, and it was way different from what he told me haha. She told me that I hid my feelings, and I admit that's true. The funny thing is, when I was about to tell him everything, he broke up with me, but I guess it was meant to be right? And another reason was because I knew how to make him go over the top, like his pissing off status. I guess we lied a lot to each other. All those times when he was angry, he told me it wasn't my fault, but it was. And my fault for saying it wasn't him that made me upset, I lied, a lot.   Tomorrow, I'm going to give the things he gave me back to him. Not tomorrow, but maybe&nbsp;another time..&nbsp;

      I didn't blog for a really really long time. I was so busy since the summer vacation. Going out pratically everyday now. I have no time to go my homework either. I forgot to say, Mr. Leung tutors me and Candace to prepare us for IB. I guess he gives a lot of homework since it took me around 3 hours to finish it. Now I'm doing corrections, how fun is that? Very. I'm stuck on a question and Candace is out. So I guess I'm doomed.   I just noticed that, I give up easily, don't you think so? It's something I'm born with. Something that I'm not really proud of. I watched Spiderman2 yesturday. It was super good and I changed my name to alice - lotr.spiderman.freak.show. 'oo2 SPIDERMAN2 ROX! [ o4`=bff ] SPIDERMAN2 SPIDERMAN2 SPIDERMAN2 go watch it now!. I'm serious it was really good. I went with my brother because I figured no one else would want to watch it. Sara said she wanted to, but then my brother asked me too since his friends are all like on vacation I think. It was sweet but super dooper good. MJ is really cool. Same with PETER PARKER. I think I should get off this topic because I'm going overboard. I just remembered, Nima still has my yearbook. I didn't even read any of my entries yet. That's so sad. I better ask for it when I get the chance. Went to wonderland on the 26th with Sara, Jacqueline, Zoe, Candace, Krystal, and Roger   Roger was asking for some money from the girls because it was his and Candaces' 6th month anniversary, well 1/2 year in other words. He started going crazy, spent all his money, including some of mine, 10 bucks to be exact. He didn't even eat dinner, which is really sad. The sacrifices we make haha. Candace was really happy because she thought he forgot. She told me a few days later that Roger said "I love you" to her. She told me that she didn't say anything back but just smiled at him. I was happy for her. But she didn't sound happy. I asked what's wrong. She said she didn't say it back to him. She said that she didn't know what love is, and that she was too young to understand it. But she likes him a lot alot. I told her that she has to talk to him and tell him if he really loved her, he'll be able to wait until she felt the same way back. If he didn't wait, then he never meant a word he said. Candace asked me if I loved Safee, I said yes. Of course she had that OOooOO and awwww part going on, on the phone. It was true. I was in love. But I don't think he was.  Love is.. eternity. Love is a feeling that can't be controlled. It's passion. I had that, but I don't know what the heck I'm saying anymore. These days I cry a lot. Not hysterically. Just a few tears sliding down my face.   I forgot to tell you. I gave Safee the stars and yearbook. I worked pretty late the day before the last day of school. I gave it to Nima in the morning to give it to him at the end of the day, after I leave. Just, plans don't always work out. Mr. S. didn't mark my d.s and he said it could raise my marks if it was good. I waited after school for around an hour. Nima had to give it to him because he was going to leave. He did, but I wasn't out yet. When I was next to Sndiford at the computer, Annie came over and told me Safee was looking for me. Crap, first thing that came into my head. It took a while and the computer was busted, so he told me to send my project over on email. When I was ready to go, through the doors, I saw him. He was sitting on the porch.  I didn't want him to see me. So I..went outside through another door. I waited till he left, but he didn't. He waited for me, which was really weird. I waited for him. I started crying. I really don't know why. Emotions overpower me. He went inside the school, that's when I ran to Krystal's house. We were planning to go to Burger King I think. I wiped away my tears. When me and the girls were walking to the school to meet other people that were going, that's when Safee was starting to walk home. I wanted to run back and pretended I was invisible, but I couldn't. I didn't make eye contact.  Wow everything is not according to plan  that's what I thought. I asked Krystal and she said that Safee was coming to Burger King.  Crap . He came, and I was on the swings with Annie. Safee kicked Annie off which was so funny. He tried to talk, as usual. But never got to the point. I pulled him to walk. Maybe the swings made him nauceous? I don't know. We sat on a hill. Same place where we spent an actual whole recess together. He's always with his friends. He said Thanks or the present and hugged me. He said if we could be good friends. I said I don't know. I didn't know anything. seriously. Everything ended from there. Slowly drifting apart. I guess we still talk. Every now and then.
