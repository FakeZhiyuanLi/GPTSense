						    Ahh... my archenemy... The Staire O...      He tried to kill me I swear it!      All of my family just gave me the same blank stares and whispered to each other about the idea that it was the frying pan boxers I was wearing, but I tell you, he hit me first!      You see, he was playing his music in the usual way, when I came running through and he tripped me! I fell face first into him, splitting my head open on one of his eyes, and thus ending my career as Peter "Pan".       The scar is still there. I hate Staire O's guts.

						    I feel that it is a good place to start... the place where I first took...  the trip .      You see, I was only about a year old, first learning how to speak, how to walk, how to not bash my head into things when I crawl and look behind me at the same time, when I took a big trip.      Yup... a big trip.  Right down the stairs through the door and onto the kitchen floor.  One year olds can't walk.      Since that time, I have never been quite the same.  According to the TV, it is not normal for children to wear underwear on their heads and yell "ZOOOOM" whilst they run through the house naked.  But I'm getting off topic, I didn't do that untili I was 21.       Ahem, yes, well... at one years of age, my first faceplant was not on a skateboard, nor was it much of a trick, nor was it very impressive, nor did it land me a girlfriend... nor...  oh you get it.      But what it did give me was extraordinary powers... the power to not realize it when I truly mess things up.      How will this adventure unfold? How will I learn what is normal and what is not? Find out on the next one of these post things.

						    Thanks to my incredible genius, I have cracked the mysterious computer virus code.      Ironically, all I had to do was stand on my head and look in a mirror and then do the hula using my ceiling fan to hold me up, and the answer came to me.  What luck!      After all that, I figured out that the message is  BACKWARDS!         It reads as follows:      "I don't understand how, but a strange virus has attacked my computer!!    The good thing is that it hasn't done much to my computer.   The bad thing is that I don't know what it is trying to tell me.   Some sort of secret code?   Maybe if I figure it out, I'll let everyone know."      The really really strange thing is that the computer had to read my mind to put that message in...   So much for needing a secretary.
