      Who would have ever thought that I would rank as a "Grammer God"?  Looking at my posts, I am sure y'all can see that the standards must be pretty low.      You are a  GRAMMAR GOD !   If your mission in life is not already to preserve the English tongue, it should be. Congratulations and thank you!    urlLink   How grammatically sound are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      So Friday started off with part of the Syphilis Commercial I'm developing being filmed in my house.  We had some hanky-panky going on in three seperate locations.  People will drive by my house and say, "That's the Syphilis house."  Whatever asshole, just roll on that rubber.  Vamanos to my party; I think I talk too much and say highly unappropriate things in large groups.  But continuing on...there were some cool ass people.  Mis amigos de El Centro vinieren.  Anja's roommate from San Fran was here as were her ex-boyfriend and his friend.  Totally awesome people.  I swear, Anja is just surrounded by immensly amazing, interesting, nice people.  Ex-boyfriend works for Lonely Planet...  Also, I wish Allen wasn't off to Quito...super cool.  Alguien stood us up, but I think he was getting laid..so I'll over look it.  El proximo dia we ventured into Chapel Hill for the first time.  We should have went way sooner.  It has that interesting flair that comes along with breeding a college town and prime realestate together.  We went to Michael's dad's house (is it proper to use to apostrophes like that?)  Ok, his dad is 73 and is just learning Spanish, has an amazing vocabulary and met a very cool Mexican lady on eharmony.com.  Can I just say I wish my grandma would take some lessons from him; life does not end at 70.  That's where we ended up going to Michael's reunion...well for 2 minutes.  I am so not going to mine!  All the people I'd want to see aren't in my class...  Oh...FYI check out realrhapsody.com.  It rock's my world.  For 10 bucks a month you have access to millions of songs.  I think of my mom's song as,  I Never Promised You a Rose Garden .  I got to hear it for the first time in years...

      I love my little albino kitty, but I really want a puppy or dog. I'm not picky.  I think Shuggs may hate me forever if I bring a rival for my affection into the house, but really-she's not the boss of me. She'd get over it, right?

      I thought this quote was a good reminder of how I should live.  Unfortunately, all the good quotes that I would want to put on my signiture file for work come off of people I work with signiture files.    "SPEAK YOUR MIND, even when your voice shakes."                                                       Maggie Kuhn

      Ok...so it just dawned on me that "Random Fire" may sound a little pyroish to those FBI agents putting things like this into my FBI file (And I'd just like to say to them that they have a rather crappy and boring job--they should come do condom demonstrations like me).  But back to my original point...I couldn't come up with anything else and I have used a screenname with "fire" in it for the past 8 years (and no, I am not putting what my screenname is on this site) and I'm a little random.  So put this post into my FBI file while you're at it.  Thanks.

      Ok, so I went here (http://web.tickle.com/tests/uiq/index2.jsp) and they told me my IQ was 131.  Damn, I can never be in Mensa.  The strange thing is I distinctly remember it being 133 at some point, so I am slowly becoming more stupid.  At least now I have some justification as to why I can't remember anything.  Argh!

      Ok..something has got to be wrong with me.  Why don't I have any interest in a relationship?  I'd rather watch Queer as Folk and/or Harry Potter then date someone.  But I do kind of miss kissing...kissing is so nice.  I had a friend in undergrad I would make out with sometimes, just because.  I miss that.  Was that wierd?  I think I am blaming all the men in my life who have screwed me over for my lack of wanting a relationship...they all suck.  And yes, that includes you wimp-ass step-father and you unnamed psycho pervert.  And yes, I can have a self-pity party if I wanna...It's my goddamn blog!  Plus, the pity only lasts 24 hours and then I get back to reality(Also the brand-name of the female condom; FYI)  Maybe I'm a lesbian and I just don't realize it.  I've never really been attracted to anyone...I've just wanted the affection/attention.  How sad is that? I don't think I'd care one way or the other what genitals the person had...after all that's just cosmetic.  I guess time will tell...

      Ok.  I am done.  I refuse to watch another Holocaust movie for the rest of my life. Each time I finish watching one of "those" movies I become depressed for days and start thinking about what I would do in a similar situation.  It's just too emotionally draining.  I can't handle it.  However, the American soldiers making Taliban and other Muslim prisioners do all of those humiliating poses etc, should be required to watch every Holocaust movie.  Because apparently the ignorant people that we have in charge of guarding prisioners have no conscience.  Oh, wait, the man we have in charge of running the country doesn't have a conscience, either.  American is making me disgusted.  I wonder if Cananda will let me in?

      Ok, so I want to feel safe.  Is that so much to ask?  For work, I had to go teach at the state prison about STDS.  Is it ever good to have a young woman teach hardened criminals about sexually transmitted diseases?  It was a "low security" prison.  Which really just meant that there were prisoners milling around every where.  Again, should I ever be milling around a prison yard without an escort?  What the hell is the County thinking?

      Anja and I adopted a puppy!!!  We are the proud joint parents of a 3 month old girl mix (I refuse to call our sweetie a "mutt") named Stack.  She has adorable brindle coloring and a white belly.  Shuggs is a little disappointed, the first time she saw Stack, she attacked her.  However, it seems as if they are easing into being tolerant of one another.     Anja and Stack are already deeply in love, but I am falling in love more each hour.  I think my heart was on the 3 year old Springer mix with heart worms.  I think about him every day even though deep down I know he was not the right choice.  Shelters are very depressing. But I love Stack.  She's really cute and we're all into the "Positive Training" thing utilizing a "clicker".  We are taking her to pick blueberries today after work.  Hopefully, she will like the car ride.  Stack went for a walk around the neighborhood yesterday and everyone seemed to be giving her dirty looks.  Finally, a nice man accross the street informed us she's part Pitt Bull.  We had no idea.  However, after much research, we descovered that Pitt Bulls can make very nice adoring, loving, sweet pets.  Their agression comes from how they are trained.  But it doesn't matter...we are going to make her the sweetest Pitt ever!  In other news...I have no idea what's wrong with me. I've been extremely cranky.  I think working for a job and being under paid has something to do with it.  However, I don't think it's good to quit a job after 3 months.  So I am just going to accept it for the next few months and then continue my search.  The job itself is so easy.  Plus, I have an unlimited supply of condoms.

      Yay!  I can link! Here is the commerical I organized for work.  I did a lot of the script, organized the actors, locations (Couples 1,3 and 5 are at my house), and much, much more.  So I am pretty proud.  It airs in the Raleigh/Durham area on NBC17. You can go  here  to see it.  Just scroll down towards the bottom of the page and click on the box that says "Durham County Health Department."  You need quicktime to watch it.

      Anja keeps making fun of me because I came out a "Christian" on the religion quiz and all, yes all, the cool people were "Unitarians".  It's actually quite funny (the jokes), but I'm really freaked out!  How can a gay lovin', abortion believer be considered a "Christian"?  My family was wielding their power through the quiz; I just know it.  One of my uncles, the one considered smart, tried to argue with me a few years back that Christianity was the only monothiestic religion.  He got ignorantly angry with me when I tried to explain that Jews, Muslims and Christians all worshiped the "One God."  Then my aunt started crying that I was going to go to hell.  However, the funniest part of this whole story is that in all of my 26 years, I have not seen any of them ever attend a church, live a holy life or say anything remotely "Christian".  But then again, I guess the whole basis of Christianity is that as long as you ask for forgiveness, you get to go to heaven.  Oh, and tithing doesn't hurt.

      Last weekend (yes, I've been too lazy to upate until now) I went to the Chino Latino to watch my friend Oscar perform drag.  The Chino Latino is a huge dive bar with a very interesting crowd.  Well, they are all Latino, for one.  Second it is a complete mix of straights and gays.  The dance floor is the biggest mix of couples I've ever seen.  It kind of reminded me a perfect world (in that straights and gays lived side by side without any prejudices--oh, and everyone speaks Spanish)  Let's say my roommate's brother, all six-four and white blonde of him really stood out.

      Life Update: I’ve been in Chapel Hill twice this week!  Tuesday night we explored with Katka.  We had the worst Margarita ever.  FYI if you go to Banditos just stick to Dos Equis.  Then last night we went to a “going away” thingy for Allen.  In front of the Chapel Hill campus is a huge sun dial.  It’s at least  30 feet in diameter.  Well, Allen, Anja and I are all standing on the sun dial like idiots trying to figure out how the thing works.  Apparently, the students at CH are much smarter then we are; Allen even had instructions printed from the internet.  I definitely feel humbled.  However, we did find some very cool bars.  There is this place called the Lantern and this place called Telulahs.  Telulah’s has a special little room that’s all Haremish.  I also had a great time talking to Ninki and her husband.  ECH Sandwiches: ECH is nice enough to provide their committee meetings with a snack each month.  So it’s 5:00 and I rush on over to the meeting; famished.  They have these cute little sandwiches, so I take one, get seated and get ready to attempt to save a little piece of the world.  I open up the sandwich, take a bite and nearly have to regurgitate what’s in my mouth.  I need to preface this by saying that a lot of people there were chomping away on the sandwiches and I mean no disrespect to ECH, but I would never have dreamed of this combination.  There was a bun and on the bun, an inch of mayo and a half an inch of refried beans with lettuce.  Can I just say, WHAT???
