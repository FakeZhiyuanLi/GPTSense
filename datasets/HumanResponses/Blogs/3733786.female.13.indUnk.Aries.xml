       Here's a very true conversation which we always hid in our hearts and never let it out until.........  THIS IS WHAT A GIRL TELL A GUY If you see me walking the road with someone else It's not because I like his company Its because you're not brave enough to walk beside me. If you hear me talking about him all the time Its not because he pleases me Its because you're too deaf to hear my heartbeat If you feel me falling with someone new Its not because I love him Because you're not there to catch me fall If you feel lost, I too am nowhere I too don't know where the road is going Are we gonna cross each other's path Or just completely turn around? Will we just let go of what we had Or go to the place where love is bound Don't let me walk with him It's you I want to walk with Don't let me talk of him It's you I want to talk with Don't let me fall for him It's you I want to fall in love with.  "HOW THE GUY REPLY" When you thought I wasn't brave enough to walk beside you I was behind you every step of the way Still filled with awe because of the beauty that stands before me When you thought I was too deaf to hear your heartbeat I didn't want to assume anything And I was afraid to lose our friendship When you thought I wasn't there to catch you It was because you never gave me the chance You never reached the bottom, you've already grabbed a branch If you feel like you are nowhere, I too am lost I too don't know where the road is going Are we just going to turn around, Or are we gonna cross each other's path? Will we just let go of what we had Or go to the place where love is bound? Don't let me walk alone I want to walk by your side Don't let me talk of something else It's you I want to talk with Don't let me fall for someone else It's you I want to fall in love with.  WHEN I SAW YOU... I WAS AFRAID TO TALK TO YOU... WHEN I TALKED TO YOU... I WAS AFRAID TO HOLD YOU... WHEN I HOLD YOU... I WAS AFRAID TO LOVE YOU... NOW THAT I LOVE YOU ... I'M AFRAID TO LOSE YOU... YESTERDAY IS HISTORY... TOMORROW IS A MYSTERY... AND TODAY IS A GIFT... THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED A PRESENT... SOMETIMES LOVE HURTS... BUT IF IT DOESN'T HURT... THEN IT ISN'T LOVE... HOLD ON TO THE PERSON U LOVE... BEFORE THEY SLIP AWAY... OR ELSE U CAN NEVER GET THEM BACK...

                                                               Hao Xin Fen Shou Translation      Were you really surprised? Were you speechless? No, you heard right I said I wanted to break up Used to be under your spell like an innocent sheep Why am I able to get back at you all of a sudden? Did you know?Looking back, being with you has never brought me any happiness We've gone through so much together But why haven't we had love I suspect that there will not be any happiness if I continue to be with you I don't have the strength, let's not linger any longer, just set me free All my work has been for nothing The past years and months have not been spent joyfully To continue out of habit does us both no good If we must suffer, why don't I just break it off now? Are you unwilling to be the first one to be dumped? If you were in my place, would you be able to take it? I've endured the loneliness many times My heart has had enough and is afraid? All my work has been for nothing The past years and months have not been spent joyfully I don't apologize for my frank behavior Forcing this relationship won't bring us anything Why don't we just break off everything? If the suffering is so great, let's not tarry any longer, please just let me go All my work has been for nothing The past years and months have not been spent joyfully To continue out of habit does us both no good If we must suffer, why donæŠ° I just break it off now?  remember the song (candy lo) n (lee hom) sang ?. . .
