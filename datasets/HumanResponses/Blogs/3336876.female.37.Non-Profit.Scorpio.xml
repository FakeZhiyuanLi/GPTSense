       urlLink Berg's sister confused over Moore's taped interview   I don't even get aggravated by Michael Moore.  Sooner or later he will be certified crazy.  Doesn't anyone ever consider the possibility that, with all the truly crazy people in the world just MAYBE there might be a few nuts loose in Hollywood?  Like maybe at least Michael Moore?

       urlLink John Kerry Quotes   God, I can't stand John al-Qaerry.  John Kerry sucks.  I had to post this RIGHT NOW because the TV is on in the background and his nails-on-the-chalkboard voice is assaulting me.  I swear I just about have a seizure when I hear it!   I think he went to some stupid Presidential Campaign Voice School or something with al-Goraeda...he's so canned, fake, bloviating, stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid!!!!   Does Hanoi John al-Qaerry have a BRAIN?  Does he have any thoughts that aren't based on his electability?  Is there a bigger jerk?   Gold-digging gigolo-wannabe war criminal liar traitor fake phony boring delusional self-serving Suburban-non-driving blasphemous hypocrite tin-man jihaddi two-faced unborn-baby-killing elitist JERK!  BBLLLLLLAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!   I am going to have to get some serious sedatives or at least anti-seizure medication should the unthinkable happen in November.  Hey, I just had another thought.  Rush Limbaugh's addiction probably started because he had to kill the pain (and hearing) from listening to Clinton/Gore.    Whew.  I just had to vent.    Now, back to surfing for the perfect pair of shoes.

      I can't even remember what I Googled--I think it was actually something related to music or something!  Anyway, wouldn't you know it, I found this totally unrelated gem at someone's blog.  So hey "Peter G," I hope you don't mind me borrowing it...     urlLink [  Postcards from DC   I spent the weekend in Washington, DC and brought you back a little something:   But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. -- excerpt from the  urlLink Gettysburg Address, November 19, 1863 .    Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict itself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible, and pray to the same God; and each invokes his aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us judge not, that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not be answered--that of neither has been answered fully.  -- excerpt from  urlLink Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address, March 4, 1865   Almost seven score ago, Abraham Lincoln spoke words which still have relevance today. Please read the speeches in their entirety. They're very good.   - Peter G, 10:46 PM ]

      Well, I don't know about you, reader, but I really do think we ought to boycott the Athens Olympics.  In fact, I sent them an email last week saying so...and that I may just not even watch the games on TV because I don't think the stinkin' Greeks deserve my support, since they HATE America.  (Anecdotally, my parents recently visited Greece and Turkey and saw the hatred spray-painted all over Greece--such niceties as "F*** Bush," "F*** USA," etc.)  So I say F*** the Greeks and their half-assed attempt at putting on a show, and their half-assed security!  Why should our athletes be subjected to hate and threats to their safety?  We boycotted Moscow in protest before; now we should boycott not in protest but for COMMON SENSE--national pride (they don't want Americans to be too proud!) and more importantly, security!  Anyway, this is the response I just got from the USOC--canned, of course:   Statement From United States Olympic Committee Chief Executive Jim Scherr Regarding U.S. Athletes Celebrating With The American Flag At The Athens Olympic And Paralympic Games   "The United States Olympic Committee wants to make it absolutely clear that we have not -- and will not -- instruct our athletes to refrain from waving the United States flag during the upcoming Athens Olympic and Paralympic Games.  Any suggestions or statements to the contrary do not reflect the official position of our organization.  Athletes will be free, as always, to celebrate their performances in an exuberant, respectful way during the Olympic and Paralympic Games.  We will remind our athletes that they are guests of the Olympic movement, Greece, and the city of Athens and to be good ambassadors of our country, their communities, families and sports.  We want our athletes to be champions who conduct themselves with class and, if it is the case, to lose with grace and dignity.    Additionally, we are reminding them to treat the United States flag with the respect it deserves.  One of the proudest moments of my life was to put on my USA warm-up and represent my country at the 1988 Olympic Games.  I know our athletes feel the same way today and we will not in any way infringe upon that honor.  Accomplishments of athletes and teams such as the 1980 United States Olympic Hockey Team, the great Billy Mills, swimming legend Janet Evans and countless others have inspired our nation.  We are certain that the athletes who represent the United States at the 2004 Olympic and Paralympic Games will do the same."   NOTE:   I didn't even mention the no-flag-waving nonsense in my email--I sent it before that whole thing even came up.  But that's what they saw fit to address in their response.  Nice to know they're paying attention, hahahahaha....  So, who's with me on the push for a boycott?  Write the USOC at media@usoc.org to tell them!!!!

If liberals won't move on from the prison abuse photos calculated to incite hatred toward the very troops liberals loudly claim to "support," I'm not moving on from the fact that the editor of the Los Angeles Times, John Carroll, is instructing journalists on ethics. The editor of the Los Angeles Times telling reporters how to behave ethically is a complete contradiction, like ... oh, I don't know ... giving Yasser Arafat a Nobel Peace Prize or something. You know, just patently silly.   This is the same L.A.

      Courtesy of another joke-sender:   Fun with John Kerry    "In his speech last night, John Kerry said this was the beginning of the end of the Bush administration. I agree. Sure, it may take another five years, but this is it."  -Jay Leno   "In his big victory speech last night, Senator Kerry said that he wanted to defeat George Bush and the 'economy of privilege.' Then he hugged his wife, Teresa, heir to the multi-million dollar Heinz food fortune."  -Jay Leno   "John Kerry will be the Democratic nominee for president. Democrats finally found someone who is Al Gore without the flash and the sizzle."  -Craig Kilborn   "Kerry has already begun his search for a running mate. They say that because John Edwards still has $50 million in campaign money, Kerry might pick him. Pick him? Hey, for $50 million, Kerry will marry him."  -Jay Leno   "Yesterday Senator John Kerry changed his mind and now supports the ban on gay marriages. I'm telling you this guy has more positions than Paris Hilton."  -David Letterman   "The Democrats are all over this. Democratic strategists feel John Kerry's war record means he can beat Bush. They say when it comes down to it voters will always vote for a war hero over someone who tried to get out of the war. I'll be sure to mention that to Bob Dole when I see him."  -Jay Leno   "They had a profile of John Kerry on the news and they said his first wife was worth around $300 million and his second wife, his current wife, is worth around $700 million. So when John Kerry says he's going after the wealthy in this country, he's not just talking. He's doing it!"  -Jay Leno   "During last night's debate, John Kerry and John Edwards were so friendly to each other some political experts think that they may end up running together. In fact Kerry and Edwards were so friendly, President Bush accused them of planning a gay marriage."  -Conan O'Brien   "According to a new study, Botox injections can help back pain. So you see, that's why John Kerry had all that Botox - his back was killing him from all that flip-flopping on issues."  -Jay Leno   "Presidential campaign getting kind of ugly, did you hear about this? Yesterday, a 27-year-old woman came forward to deny rumors that she had an affair with Democratic front-runner John Kerry. The woman added, 'I would never cheat on Bill Clinton.'"  -Conan O'Brien   "John Kerry said today that he wants to get rid of tax cuts for the rich and his wife said, 'Hey, shut up! What's the matter with you?! Are you nuts?!'"  -Jay Leno   "In a new issue of Esquire magazine, they revealed that before he was married to Teresa Heinz, Senator John Kerry dated Morgan Fairchild, Michelle Phillips, Catherine Oxenberg and Dana Delany. Finally a Democratic presidential candidate with good taste in women."  -Jay Leno   "John Kerry's victory over Howard Dean has completely changed the presidential race around. Now instead of the rich white guy from Yale who lives in the White house facing off against the rich white guy from Yale who lives in Vermont, he may have to face the rich white guy from Yale who lives in Massachusetts. It's a whole different game."  -Jay Leno   "The Boston Globe is reporting that Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry used to date actress Morgan Fairchild but it didn't work out. Apparently she couldn't handle dating someone with bigger hair then she had."  -Jay Leno   "John Kerry is recovering nicely after having prostate surgery. But the doctors did tell him it would be several months before he could be sexually active again. All the other Democratic candidates have been very supportive. Joe Lieberman called to wish him the best. The Rev. Al Sharpton called to offer prayers. Former President Bill Clinton called Mrs. Kerry and asked if she was lonely."  -Jay Leno

      The Hillary Clinton Memoirs  "Hillary Clinton's 506-page memoirs have come out. So much of her personality shines through, that in the end, you, too, will want to sleep with an intern." - Craig Kilborn  "In Hillary Clinton's new book 'Living History,' Hillary details what it was like meeting Bill Clinton, falling in love with him, getting married, and living a passionate, wonderful life as husband and wife. Then on page two, the trouble starts." - Jay Leno  "In the book she says when Bill told her he was having an affair, she said 'I could hardly breathe, I was gulping for air.' No, I'm sorry, that's what Monica said."   - David Letterman  "Hillary Clinton, our junior senator from New York, announced that she has no intentions of ever, ever running for office of the President of the United States. Her husband, Bill Clinton, is bitterly disappointed. He is crushed. There go his dreams of becoming a two-impeachment family." - David Letterman  "Last night, Senator Hillary Clinton hosted her first party in her new home in Washington. People said it was a lot like the parties she used to host at the White House. In fact, even the furniture was the same."  - Jay Leno  "Senator Hillary Clinton is attacking President Bush for breaking his campaign promise to cut carbon dioxide emissions, saying a promise made is a promise broken. And then out of habit, she demanded that Bush spend the night on the couch." - Craig Kilborn  "CNN found that Hillary Clinton is the most admired woman in America. Women admire her because she's strong and successful. Men admire her because she allows her husband to cheat and get away with It." - Jay Leno  "Hillary Clinton is the junior senator from the great state of New York. When they swore her in, she used the Clinton family Bible. You know, the one with only seven commandments."    David Letterman

Has anyone been reminded of the movie "Deliverance" by this whole Abu Ghraib episode?  It seems to me that almost all of these mental cases are from the dark underbelly of Appalachia.  How much do you wanna bet SOMEONE said, "Squeal like a pig!"  I'm not even going to start ranting on this.  It's too sordid and STUPID.  I'm just mostly aggravated that those slobs gave the whole U.S. a black eye...and gave fodder to the Kerry/al-Qaeda/anti-war machine.  Assholes.

       urlLink American Candidate - political reality tv series   An interesting diversion.   Way too many candidates to look through ALL of them (besides, all but six are too moderate to commie for me!), so search by political party or whatever.  I went through the first 30 or so and quit looking through every one of them once I saw there is apparently no end.  Anyway, "my candidate's" name is Park Gillespie from North Carolina.  (Naturally--he's a Southern Republican!)  Others I would vote for are Elizabeth Beck, Aaron Goldman, Ralph Odierna, John Trifero, and Jason Werstak.  There are LOTS of kooks as candidates too, worth a laugh...  Too bad I don't get Showtime (unlike HBO with the Sopranos and Six Feet Under, I won't subscribe for just one show).  Probably, the show will be annoying like other reality series (except Survivor, my obnoxious guilty pleasure).  __________  Rats!!!  I missed my " urlLink meeting " while surfing this other stuff!

Some people, most notably liberals, are scandalized by Cheney's telling Pat Leahy to "fuck himself."  Yet at the same time they call HIM a liar, secretive, etc. etc. etc.  Well, if Cheney were the two-faced creep they accuse him of being, he would have simply stabbed Leahy in the back while smiling and shaking hands.   In fact, Cheney said on Fox's Cavuto show today that Leahy is exactly that kind of man--one who bad-mouths you but acts like he's your friend to your face.  What a chickenshit.   Now if Cheney or someone would just tell Al Sore (Loser) the same thing...and for that matter, many, many others...

'At moment, wind-operating power stations generate only 15 Megawatts of energy. We will raise the figure to 250 Megawatts in ten years,' Ahmad Kahrobaian told reporters. 'To this end, we will add 80 Megawatts of hydraulic energy, 17 Megawatts of solar energy and one million cubic meters of solar water-heater,' he added. Kahrobaian said the country needed to focus on research to expand utilization of renewable energy resources. 'That is the case while the Management and Planning Organization has already rejected four proposals.' 'At moment, renewable energies generate around 40,000 Megawatts of electricity in the world. Europeans have planned so that renewable energies account for 20 percent of their electricity generation by 2030.' 'The International Energy Agency estimated the world oil production at 75 million barrels per day and calls for its increase to 120 million in 2030,' the official said."  Note there is NOTHING in the above that says anything about NUCLEAR energy!  I guess this guy forgot the official party line!

       urlLink No One Asked Us   Great article from a guy who was/is in Iraq; click above and read the whole thing!  [Excerpted] "The analogy is simple.  For years, you have watched the same large, violent man come home every night, and you have listened to his yelling and the crying and the screams of children and the noise of breaking glass, and you have always known that he was beating his wife and his children.  Everyone on the block has known it.  You ask, cajole, threaten and beg him to stop, on behalf of the rest of the neighborhood.  Nothing works.  After listening to it for 13 years, you finally gather up the biggest, meanest guys you can find, you go over to his house, and you kick the door down.  You punch him in the face and drag him away.  The house is a mess, the family poor and abused...but now there is hope.  You did the right thing." .... "The war was the right thing to do then, and in hindsight it was still the right thing to do.  We can't overthrow every murderous tyrant in the world, but when we can, we should.  Take it from someone who was there, and who stood to lose everything.  We must, and will, stay the course.  We owe it to the Iraqis, and to the world."   Stan Coerr is a SuperCobra attack helicopter pilot and Forward Air Controller, and was recently selected for Lieutenant Colonel in the Marine Corps Reserve.  He lives in San Diego.

Their accounts, of course, will vary widely, but they'll all have something in common: Every media outlet will begin by telling you about the biggest bombing of the day.  No matter their bias, TV stations and newspapers around the world lead off with tragedy, calamity and conflict because that's what the public wants first, that's the market.  While there's no shortage of destruction for journalists to cover here in Iraq, lost in the rubble is this unarguable fact: The United States is doing great work here, work that every American should celebrate.  So for this Sunday morning, I have compiled a short list of those accomplishments. This comes from reports supplied by the Coalition Provisional Authority's public affairs office, as well as my own brief experience here.

       urlLink BEHEADINGS IN THE ISLAMIST WORLD   BEHEADINGS IN THE ISLAMIST WORLD by Amir Taheri Benador Online  June 18, 2004  The murder of Nick Berg, a 26-year-old American businessman, by a group of Islamist terrorists in Iraq sent shock waves through much of the West. What has impressed most people is the fact that the terrorists cut Mr. Berg's head in the way that sheep are beheaded at the annual Feast of the Sacrifice.  Berg is, of course, not the first to be murdered in such a gruesome manner. Nor, alas, is he likely to be the last. For the cutting of heads (in Arabic, qata al-raas) has been the favorite form of Islamist execution for more than 14 centuries.   In the famous battles of early Islam, with the Prophet personally in command of the army of believers, the heads of enemy generals and soldiers were often cut off and put on sticks to be shown around villages and towns as a warning to potential adversaries.   In 680, the Prophet's favorite grandson, Hussein bin Ali, had his head chopped off in Karbala, central Iraq, by the soldiers of the Caliph Yazid. The severed head was put on a silver platter and sent to Damascus, Yazid's capital, before being sent further to Cairo for inspection by the Governor of Egypt. The Caliph's soldiers also cut off the heads of all of Hussein's 71 male companions, including the one-year-old baby boy Ali-Asghar.   Islamic history is full of chopped heads being sent around by special delivery to reassure rulers, to terrorize foes and to impress the common folk. In 1821, the Qajar king of Persia ordered a week of celebrations when he received the severed head of a Russian general who had been captured in a battle near Baku. In 1842, the Afghans massacred the British garrison in Kabul, a total of 2,000 men and their wives and children, chopping off their heads and putting them on sticks to decorate the city. (They allowed one man to leave to report to the British.) ...  (Click above for the remainder of the article.  Worth reading!)

       urlLink DRUDGE REPORT FLASH 2004 : "TIME Interviews President Clinton"   Worth a look--while it's the same old bullshit regarding himself vs. "The (you-know-what) Conspiracy," it's surprising to see that Slick Willie actually has something reasonable to say about the war (supporting Bush's decision).    You KNOW I won't be buying this book, though!  And don't YOU dare!  That money you plunk down will be money to help Ms. Rodham and all her accomplices!  (Personally I'd rather Willie take his book money to hookers and bars as it suits him better, but to hell with all of them!)  If any of you are silly enough to want to read his 957-page self-tribute, go to the library.  I'll wait for Dick Morris' version, or something.  Only one post tonight...it's already late.  Computer went into a coma for a few hours tonight due to weather and crappy DSL service.  No, I don't use cable, because STUPID Comcast is too stupid to do online billing/payment.  What kind of flippin' ISP doesn't do business online???  Stupid, stupid, stupid.  Plus Comcast Digital Cable (which I have) is horrifyingly overpriced, twice the rate of DirecTV.  Why don't I have DirecTV?  Because  I had DTV in Virginia and EVERY TIME there was a t-storm, the DTV went out.  At least the ridiculously expensive cable TV doesn't go out, EVER.  We had a nasty storm tonight, and didn't lose TV or power.  But OF COURSE, I lost my DSL connection--this only 30 minutes after I had finally gotten it fixed from an earlier loss of connection.  DSL SUCKS!!!!!  Hated it in DC/Virginia (Verizon), and I hate it here!!!!!  Bellsouth sucks!  Comcast ISP sucks!  DirecTV sucks!  When will there EVER be a telecom company that GETS IT ALL RIGHT?  OK this was just supposed to be a quick post.  I went off on a tangent about nothing.  But I had to get that stream-of-consciousness rant out.  *yawn*  good night!

Probably some State vs. DOD fight that Rummy lost.  Hmmm.  Honestly I can't even believe there's a question on whether or not this should be done--it's not like Iraqis haven't been subjected to far worse than martial law for their entire lives prior to Saddam's ousting.  I kinda doubt the new Iraqi government would be feeding people into meat grinders for missing curfew (although in that part of the world, you never can tell).

      Kittens...    John Kerry  (Hanoi Jean-Francois al-Qaerry)  is out jogging one morning and notices Little Hannah on the corner with a box. Curious, he runs over to Little Hannah and says, "What's in the box, kid?"  Little Hannah says, "Kittens, they're brand new kittens."    Kerry laughs and says, "What kind of kittens are they?"  "Democrats," says Little Hannah. "Oh that's cute," he says and goes on his way.    A few days later, John Kerry is walking with his buddy Ted Kennedy and he spies Little Hannah with her box just ahead. He says to Ted, "You gotta check this out," and they both walk over to Little Hannah.    Kerry says, "Look in the box, Teddy, isn't that cute? Look at those little kittens.  Hey, kid, tell my friend Teddy what kind of kittens they are."  Little Hannah replies, "They're Republicans."    "Whoa!" John Kerry says, "I came by here the other day and you said they were Democrats. What's up?"   "Well," Little Hannah explains, "their eyes are open now."   (Thanks, Mom!)

The "Center for the appreciation of the Shahid" of the world Islamic Movement, declared today that an international gathering of "Shahids" (martyr bombers) is to take place with the objective of presenting suicide bombing as the most effective and influential method to compel occupying forces to flee Muslim territories. The ceremony will include participants from various Jihad movements and will take place on 02/06/04 in the AL-SHOHADAH HALL at 7th Batir square.   Among the speakers at the gathering will be ZAHRA Mustafai the great grand daughter of Iman Khomeini, Member of the Majles.

The Application Form    Hi All,  I would like to address this allegation of the suicide bombing application that was posted this past weekend, being a hoax! Apparently there are people out there who think that Iranian activists can actually risk their credibility by doing something STUPID like circulating a fake document...I think some of the freedom fighters are a heck of a lot more savvy than that and have learned to tell a FAKE from the REAL THING. Our networks have never stirred us wrong and they wouldn't have this time either. Give us that much credit FOLKS! We've fought hard for western media to listen and help us and we're not about to go and discredit ourselves.   Plus just to put an end to this once and forall...Reuters (http://www.reuters.co.uk/newsPackageArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&storyID=523891&section=news) also reported on the recruitment of suicide bombers AND to top that off, Khamenei, in his Friday speech, last week, (which was broadcast on Iranian state Television - IRIB Channel) actually cited the document AND gleefully happened to also mention that they are actively and openly recruiting suicide bombing volunteers. I hope that all this proof satisfies the mind of our, shall-we-say, know-it-all detractors out there...Apparently a few non-Iranian "experts" had read a comment posted by one our fellow activists who was trying to be funny; the comment was a sarcastic "job description" of the actual application.

      Report says Iran trains suicide bombers     LONDON, , May. 29 (UPI)  -- Iran has reportedly established what could be the first training center for Islamic suicide attackers, the Middle East Newsline reported Sunday.  MENL cited Iranian sources and media reports that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps has established a center to train suicide attackers throughout the world. The center is called the World Islamic Martyrs and Fighters Staff Headquarters.  The Iranian Revolutionary Guard's intelligence service set up the training center in support of Islamic insurgency groups linked to Tehran. The groups have included Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command.  The state-operated Iranian Student News Agency first reported the existence of the center on Wednesday. The London-based daily A-Sharq Al Awsat gave a similar account in an article by Iranian analyst Ali Nouri Zadeh.

       urlLink 2,000 Iranians Enlist as Suicide Bombers for Iraq, Israel   Straight from the horse's (camel's) mouth:  (dated June 6)  Persian Journal  Iran News 2,000 Iranians Enlist as Suicide Bombers for Iraq, Israel  AFP Jun 6, 2004, 11:38    Some 2,000 Iranians, one as young as seven, have signed up with a shadowy Islamist group to carry out suicide bombings in Iraq and Israel, a Tehran daily reported yesterday.   "So far 2,000 people have registered," the group's spokesman, Mohammad Samadi, told the reformist newspaper Shargh. "Twenty-five percent are under 18 years, 55 percent are between 18 and 40, and the rest are 40 to 80," said Samadi, spokesman for the Committee for the Commemoration of Martyrs of the World Islamic Movement.   "The youngest is a seven-year old child who registered along with his family," Samadi added. The group launched its recruitment drive late last month, taking names and telephone numbers of volunteers after the main weekly Muslim prayers on Fridays. The action was intended to "show our friends in Iraq and all other Muslims that we are ready to give our lives to defend our honor and Islam's," Samadi said at the time, pointing to U.S. military operations in the Iraqi holy cities of Najaf and Karbala, which are revered by Shiites in Iran as well as Iraq.   "Suicide operations are the best way to fight the oppressors and they have already shown their worth in Lebanon and during the war between Iran and Iraq," he said, referring to the neighbors' bloody 1980-88 conflict. However, there was no evidence the action was anything more than symbolic, and Samadi said the group would renounce suicide operations if asked to by Iranian so-called leader mullah Ali Khamenei.

       U.N. Parties During Reagan's Funeral   U.N. chief Kofi Annan and U.N. General Assembly President Julian Hunte (St. Lucia) were among the VIPs at the state funeral for former president Ronald Reagan in Washington.  But the National Day of Mourning didn't stop the U.N. from its regular schedule of festivities.  The U.N.'s headquarters in New York City remained open for business and all employees were expected to report for work, says spokesman Stephane Dujarric. "The U.N. does not discriminate on the basis of nationality," he explained.  That is not exactly true.  The U.N. shuts down for numerous Christian and Moslem holidays. (Interestingly, it has never closed for any Jewish holiday in its entire history.)  In September 2000, President Bill Clinton asked the U.N. to delay the opening of the General Assembly out of respect for the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur (the holiest day on the Jewish calendar.)  The answer was an emphatic "No."  Clinton boycotted the General Assembly's opening day and spoke the following week.  On Friday, not only did the U.N. remain open, but also the annual "Staff Day" festivities, previously scheduled, went forward as planned.  Staff day is set aside by the United Nations to "honor" its employees.  In recent years, Staff Day has become an event for parties and "talent shows" more reminiscent of those often found in college fraternity houses.  It is like a U.N. version of "American Idol" (without the record contract).  Which left the U.N. in a potentially embarrassing situation.  While President Reagan was eulogized in a somber memorial in Washington, U.N. staffers in NYC were partying it up.  Many staffers inside the U.N. bureaucracy blame Reagan for massive cuts in U.S. funding of the world body, which resulted in thousands of layoffs.  Under the Reagan administration, more than $1 billion in U.S. dues went unpaid.  The president once remarked, "If the U.N. does not like New York, they are free to move, perhaps to Moscow."  One staffer remembered that former Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega once told the General Assembly, "President Reagan should remember that Rambo exists only in the movies!" That brought a standing ovation.  All of which left mixed emotions among the U.N. staff.  "He [Reagan] wanted to get rid of us ... that's why I voted for Clinton and will vote for Kerry," lamented one American U.N. staffer.  But one immigrant from the former Soviet republic of the Ukraine had tears in her eyes; for her, Ronald Reagan was more than just a U.S. president:  "He is very special to me and my family. He gave us something which had been taken away [by the Soviet government]... our lives."      OK THIS IS THE LAST ONE FOR TONIGHT!

      WHY does one go around checking out political blogs that they know will be in complete opposition to one's own opinions?   Doesn't everyone know that blogs ARE biased?  (ok, two questions)  I mean I don't go around lurking the liberal/anti-Bush/pro-terrorist sites, I get enough of that shit in the mainstream media.  Hence my blog, where I can put whatever articles or commentary I want, even if it's about nothing.  It's MY little vast right-wing conspiracy for other vast right-wing conspirators. Duhhhh, now I think I'll go looking for a blog about tomatoes so I can leave comments about how bad tomatoes suck.  STUPID!!!   This Midnight Crazies rant is courtesy of "Scott," an obvious liberal elitist who left typically liberal elitist comments on the  urlLink One Hand Clapping   blog.  Now that I got out my rant, I can sleep.

             Once upon a time, long, long ago there was a Presidential election that was too close to call. Neither the Republican presidential candidate nor the Democratic presidential candidate had enough votes to win the election.  Therefore, it was decided that there should be an ice fishing contest between the two candidates to determine the final winner.         There was much talk about ballot recounting, court challenges, etc., but a week-long ice fishing competition seemed the (manly) way to settle things.         The candidate who catches the most fish at the end of the week wins. After a lot of back and forth discussion, it was decided that the contest would take place on a remote and cold lake in Wisconsin.         There were to be no observers present and both men were to be sent out separately on this remote lake and return daily with their catch for counting and verification.         At the end of the first day, George W. returns to the headquarters and he has 10 fish. Soon, Kerry, who has answers to everything, but no plan, returns and has zero fish.         Well, everyone assumes he is just having another bad hair day or something and hopefully, he will catch up the next day. At the end of the 2nd day George W. comes in with 20 fish and Kerry comes in again with none.         That evening, Bill Clinton gets together secretly with Kerry and says, "I think George W. is a lowlife cheatin' son-of-a-gun. I want you to go out tomorrow and don't even bother with fishing. Just spy on him and see if he is cheating in any way.         The next night (after George W. comes back with 50 fish), Clinton says to Kerry, "Well, what about it, is George W. cheatin?'" "He sure is, Bill,that sonofabitch is cutting holes in the ice.

      Tonight's Midnight Crazies are courtesy of the |=u(%ing blasted Nicoderm patch. No I don't really WANT to quit smoking, it's just that my car battery has been dead for the last week and since you will NEVER see me walk to the store to buy cigarettes (I ran out the other day) and I wouldn't even bother asking for a ride from anyone to go get more cancer sticks, I had to break out The Patch.  I actually have them on hand in case of emergencies like these, but mainly I have them because they were SO on sale that I could NOT resist.  (See my Paypal "Donate" button? That's for my sale-hound shopping habit.)  HEY MOM...if you're reading this, send money; maybe I'll buy some Nicorette gum next time!  FYI to potential quitters:  this patch sucks in so many ways.   Quitters never win, and winners never quit .  (So said Carol Brady in the Brady Bunch, but I'm pretty sure she wasn't talking about smoking.)  Postscript:  Yes, the car is fine now, thanks to "baby" brother Danny.

      Now this is just strange.   urlLink Don King  (!) is on  urlLink FOX  with  urlLink Rita Cosby , cheering like a Dallas Cowgirl for  W  - " urlLink George W. Bush  is the Man With The Plan," rah rah rah... Improbable, outrageous, but NOT unwelcome.  I wonder how long it takes now before the NAACP takes back the awards they have bestowed upon him. Improbable, outrageous, but NOT unwelcome.    I'm sure all the leftists would have something obnoxious to say about it, but at least  urlLink W  doesn't count Osama bin Laden and Saddam among HIS supporters, unlike  urlLink Hanoi John .  (Unrelated, except this is also on Fox News):  Oh good God, now  urlLink Geraldo  just brought up Abu Ghraib again (completely out of context, like everyone else).  If I hear one more word uttered regarding Abu G, I might end up doing 360º head-spins and projectile vomiting green filth.    I think in order to be more constructive, I'll make some cute invitations to a "party" at the Abu G prison and send them out to everyone I see/hear/read from that makes irrelevant reference to The Mother of All Scandals That Makes Everything Else Not Newsworthy.  The only thing worth mentioning AT ALL any more about Abu G are the courts-martial WHEN THEY HAPPEN.  Other than that, the subject has been flogged to death (unlike the prisoners).  And now, just as I thought the last 15 minutes couldn't get more annoying,  urlLink Jesse Jackson  is blathering on about something.  Doesn't matter what, his voice alone gives me seizures.

       "The Democrats' extreme makeover started more than a week ago when they adopted a platform suggesting that reasonable people can disagree over the war in Iraq, even though 90 percent of their delegates in Boston oppose the war. The final touches were added last night as John Kerry, who declared himself an anti-war candidate during the campaign, tried to present himself as a strong leader in the War on Terror.John Kerry and John Edwards voted for the war, but not for its funding. On this, he offered no explanation. The Washington Post's lead editorial may have best described John Kerry's performance: "[H]e fell short of demonstrating the kind ofleadership the nation needs." The American people are rightly concerned over John Kerry's inconsistencies and contradictions on the central front in the War on Terror. But people are getting the truth through an 11-minute documentary that chronicles John Kerry's ever changing positions on Iraq. The documentary was highlighted on ABC, NBC, and CBS; we have received more than 15,000 requests for copies; and the deluge of Internet traffic crashed our website. What is abundantly clear from his actions and words in the video is that John Kerry's policy on the war has more to do with what was goingon in on the ground in Iowa than in Iraq, that the most important new intelligence data that he got was that he was trailing in New Hampshireto Howard Dean. His own words completely refute the notion that he is a strong and decisive leader. [  urlLink  Watch here   ] We released this documentary during our daily press conference to draw attention to John Kerry's Senate record. As we predicted, we were the only one talking about his record. In John Kerry's speech last night, 73 of the 5,343 words were about his Senate record: a total of 26 seconds. We're proud of President Bush's record. We will run on that record--and the President's agenda for the future--through victory on November 2nd."     Check out the video (linked above), if you have any questions where Kerry stands on the issue of Iraq.   Be aware that it IS tough to get a connection to the video because so many are watching it, but you can request a copy from them.

       urlLink Drudge's transcript & audio clip    You know what's funny...Prior to Kerry's speech (second only in dullness to "Mama T"), some pundit on TV--I forgot who--was talking about the preparations for it, including the balloon drop. He commented about the balloon problem encountered (similarly) after Jimmy Carter's 1980 convention speech, and how Carter supporters lamented after his resounding defeat that in retrospect, it was a "bad omen." Lo and behold, we have another balloon malfunction. Not that I'm reading too much into it seriously, but it is FUNNY.   And still, after all that blah blah blah, what does Kerry have to offer? The United Nations??? No thanks. Plagiarism ("help is on the way")? A wooden, staged salute? Wow, that was SO warm and inspiring.   Oh well, anything the guy says is like nails on the chalkboard to me. Like this:   "I will be a commander in chief who will never mislead us into war." I guess you, Hanoi Jean, misled us too when you voted for the war based on the same information the President had.   "We fought for this nation because we loved it and we came back with the deep belief that every day is extra."  And some of you came back and lied to Congress to further your anti-war cause, and stabbed your fellow men-in-arms in the back, and sympathized with the enemy.   "I will immediately reform the intelligence system - so policy is guided by facts, and facts are never distorted by politics."  You, Jean-Francois, have worked for YEARS to "reform" the intelligence system--by trying to systematically dismantle it, along with the military. No thank you.   "And as President, I will bring back this nation's time-honored tradition: the United States of America never goes to war because we want to, we only go to war because we have to."  Hmmm. Let me see. Can anyone tell me REALISTICALLY that they truly believe we are at war " because we want to ?" Yeah sure, GWB, Cheney, etc. all sat around and said, I feel like going and kickin' some ass somewhere...how about let's go have a shootout with Saddam! I know, the crazy Bush-haters probably DO think that he "cooked it up in Crawford." WHAT-fucking-EVER. So under what circumstances WOULD Kerry feel we have to go to war? Maybe to bail out France again?   "Our purpose now is to reclaim democracy itself. We are here to affirm that when Americans stand up and speak their minds and say America can do better, that is not a challenge to patriotism; it is the heart and soul of patriotism."  RECLAIM DEMOCRACY? Excuse me, are we NOT in a democracy? What the fuck is THAT? And I don't remember anyone saying Jean-Francois or anyone else is "unpatriotic" for disagreeing with President Bush (although Kerry's treacherous behavior regarding Vietnam damn sure was). But MAYBE he needs to listen to some of his supporters--the Michael Moore contingent and such--that ARE unpatriotic, that DO bash America at every turn, that SNEER at those of us who LOVE our country and thank God (yes, GOD) that we're Americans and call us "stupid." Damn right that's unpatriotic!     This post is long enough--I don't feel like spending all night countering everything. Tomorrow I think I'll blog some non-political stuff, maybe. I'm sure pretty much everyone has had enough politics this week anyway...even me.

       Truth vs. Lies    At the Jackass Convention, the speakers (namely, Little Johnny Edwards) have taken to  blatant lying about veterans issues , saying Bush has cut veterans' benefits, etc. BULLSHIT!   As a veteran myself, with a VA-compensable service-connected disability,  I am outraged . Here are the facts:    President Bush has proposed record levels of support for American’s veterans and has increased VA healthcare funding by more than 40 percent.   President Bush has increased pay for our troops by more than 21 percent over three years.   President Bush has twice signed legislation effectively providing “concurrent receipt” of both military retired pay and VA disability compensation for those military retirees most deserving – combat-injured and highly-disabled veterans – reversing a century old law preventing concurrent receipt. (Did you know that this reversed a LONG-standing gripe among veterans?!)   John Kerry voted against TRICARE health coverage and health benefits for reservists. I guess he thinks it's better for them to fend for themselves?   John Kerry has voted against pay raises for our troops at least 21 different times. I think we ALL know the active duty military are unbelievably underpaid.   John Kerry voted against the $87 billion (after he "voted for it") to support our men and women in uniform. The $87 billion included funds for body armor, meal allowance, and hazard pay, among others, for the War on Terror.   John Kerry has voted against funding for improved military housing. (It's bad enough that they're underpaid, but should they be forced to live in run-down housing? I've been there, done that...there's ALWAYS housing to be worked on, increased, etc...and I was in the Air Force--which always has better housing than the other services!)    The idea of HANOI John al-Qaerry doing anything to&nbsp;honor and improve&nbsp;the lives of active duty or veteran military is a JOKE.&nbsp; He burned that bridge over 30 years ago, and has done  nothing  whatsoever since then to make amends.

That fat bastard is a drooling moron.&nbsp; I wasn't going to comment upon it here because I already rapid-fired a few pointed comments that O'Reilly forgot to mention to  urlLink o'reilly@foxnews.com , including the following (but in fewer words): 1)&nbsp; Bush did not sacrifice anyone for Fallujah, or anything else.&nbsp; Brave, honorable VOLUNTEER military fighters sacrificed  themselves  for the greater common good.&nbsp; And even for fat blowhards like Moore. 2)&nbsp; Moore said democracy doesn't come at the end of a rifle, it comes when people want it they "rise up" against oppressors, "like the French" did in their revolution.&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the French in his argument is LAUGHABLE, but more importantly, it's easy for the fatass to say that from his Lazy-Boy chair and cheesy-poofs in AMERICA.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Iraqis under Saddam didn't have the luxury of making big-budget movies to oppose Saddam.&nbsp; They had the luxury of watching their backs and hoping no one they were related to or friends with made mistakes that would get them summarily executed as well, not to mention the luxury of keeping their "revolutionary" thoughts to themselves.&nbsp; And basically, WE WAITED FOR 12 YEARS for the Iraqis to "rise up against Saddam," but that idea was basically quashed within a few months of Gulf War '91.&nbsp; Duh!&nbsp;  3)&nbsp; Moore can't seem to remember the last decade or so, much less anything before then.&nbsp; History is clearly not his forte.&nbsp; He was confused about WWII (Hitler and Japan attacked us?), the Cold War (the arms race had nothing to do with the collapse of the USSR?), and on and on.&nbsp;   All these Moore-loving liberals need to WAKE UP and choose their icons more carefully, lest they tarnish their intellectual images.&nbsp; SEE?&nbsp; They're all a bunch of juvenile-delinquent wimpy victims, not intellectuals.

It seems they've dumped Ann Coulter's Democratic convention column once they found out she isn't exactly spouting the DNC party line.  Drudge notes, however, that America-hater M.

And the boring, tired, "on message" spin is absolutely nauseating. Why are spin doctors even needed? Just stick a photo on the screen, play the taped "message" everyone repeats drone-like, and call it a day. Thank God for the Ann Coulters of the world, who will say what they want and not regurgitate the same old shit.   Speaking of slack-jawed monotony, heeeeere's Al saying "This time let's make sure every vote's counted!" Still whining and crying "no fair."  Time to pop in a DVD. This makes me sick.

       urlLink Wired News: Techies Blast Induce Act    Thank you  urlLink Xeno , for enlightening me on this!   For those who don't know, this is a bill to "hold tech companies responsible for creating devices that could be used to pirate digital content." Think of the implications. I haven't ANY idea why anyone who is not totally anti-business and anti-innovation would be for this! Don't let the RIAA buy your federal representatives' votes and destroy business and technology! This should not be opposed only by those who file-share ("pirate"); it should be opposed by anyone who uses ANY electronic devices at all.   Also see  urlLink here  for more information!

       (I got this via email--please pass it on!)   Franklin Roosevelt introduced the Social Security (FICA) Program. &nbsp;He promised: &nbsp;  1.) That participation in the Program would be completely voluntary, &nbsp; 2.) That the participants would only have to pay 1% of the first $1,400 of their annual incomes into the Program, &nbsp; 3.) That the money the participants elected to put into the Program would be deductible from their income for tax purposes each year, &nbsp; 4.) That the money the participants put into the independent "Trust Fund" rather than into the General operating fund, and therefore, would only be used to fund the Social Security Retirement Program, and no other Government program, and, &nbsp; 5.) That the annuity payments to the retirees would never be taxed as income.   Since many of us have paid into FICA for years and are now receiving a Social Security check every month -- and then finding that we are getting taxed on 85% of the money we paid to the Federal government to "put away," you may be interested in the following:   Q: Which Political Party took Social Security from the independent "Trust" fund and put it into the General fund so that Congress could spend it?  A: It was Lyndon Johnson and the Democratically-controlled House and Senate.   Q: Which Political Party eliminated the income tax deduction for Social Security (FICA) withholding?  A: The Democratic Party.   Q: Which Political Party started taxing Social Security annuities?  A: The Democratic Party, with Al Gore casting the "tie-breaking" deciding vote as President of the Senate, while he was Vice President of the US.   Q: Which Political Party decided to start giving annuity payments to immigrants?  A: That's right! &nbsp;Jimmy Carter and the Democratic Party. &nbsp;Immigrants moved into this country, and at age 65, began to receive SSI Social Security payments! &nbsp;The Democratic Party gave these payments to them, even though they never paid a dime into it!   Then, after doing all this lying and thieving and violation of the original contract (FICA), the Democrats turn around and tell you that the Republicans want to take your Social Security away! And the worst part about it is, uninformed citizens believe it!   Perhaps we are asking the wrong questions during this 2004 election year!

       urlLink Reuters | Latest Financial News / Full News Coverage   Always true to their collective nature, the eternally-envious French spit at America.  Literally and figuratively:  spectators at the Tour de France ("Le Tour," gag cough gag) were seen SPITTING at Lance Armstrong.  What does this say of these jerks EXCEPT that they're full of envy?    Already I've wasted too much time on them.  They're as irrelevant as any other lilliputian loudmouths that bad-mouth those whom they wish to be (i.e. AMERICANS).    Envy = inferiority.

      This is either a joke from someone mocking a liberal, or a real liberal who personifies the stereotypes:   At    11:54 PM   , Anonymous said…   I do not really have a post to reply to - just your profile:I'm not a victim and I am rational, therefore I am not a liberal.I have never said that I was a victim, I have never even thought it. I just know who takes better care. Me - 29 yrs old. Mother - dead at 47. Grandmother - stroke at 73. Who do I trust? Not the right wing republican you. My grandmother - worked at the IRS for 30 yrs, left because of a lung condition in 1979. Me, guardian at 26. Who do I trust - not the right wing republican you. After squashing 30 years of savings in 30 months, I sought help. What was left for my grandmother? 6 mos. of living - because that's all that was offered in a nameless, dirty, disengaged atmosphere that I was forced to put her in.I'm not the victim. My grandmother is. My family is. Tell me what you could offer? What Republicans can offer? Prescription drugs? Give me a break. Learn what I have learned.You have nothing because you want to give nothing. YOu shameless, 'middle America', selfish nothings.Don't pin the world on the urban liberals....it's easy living in a world of similarities - ignorance is bliss.PHONY.   &nbsp;  &nbsp; While you are certainly entitled to your opinion, your opinion is shamelessly tainted by incorrect ASSUMPTIONS.&nbsp; If you must attack me personally, you should at least know your subject.&nbsp; "Middle America," you sneer.&nbsp; It appears you think that anyone in "Middle America" is ignorant due to the assumed homogeneity of the populace.&nbsp; Well, while not EVERYONE in "Middle America" has the sophisticated, cosmopolitan surroundings you think you have, many "Middle Americans" have had the experience that you think entitles you to a superior position.&nbsp; Your sneering attitude toward the "Middle America nothings" are laughable, and are a caricature of the liberal elitists.&nbsp; Why don't you climb off your ivory tower and live life a little outside YOUR comfortable existence?   What have YOU done for the greater common good?&nbsp; ANYTHING?&nbsp; Or do you feel that sense of entitlement because you have had family experiences that may qualify you for sainthood in your own family--but that millions of others do without feeling so put-upon because we feel it's part of human duty?   Walk a mile in my shoes, honey, before you lash out at me and accuse me of being comfortably numb.&nbsp; My business IS MY business, and I'm quite proud of my trials in life, but I don't feel the need to trumpet them before anyone because it's my business, my struggle, my success.&nbsp;   Finally, how does your grandmother, etc. have ANYTHING to do with your liberal view?&nbsp; Are you looking for a handout, and that's it????&nbsp; I REALLY don't think there are any conservatives who believe in totally abandoning the TRULY needy (as opposed to the simply self-pitying).&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you ever think that there are more important things that the government/politicians should tending to besides people's family obligations?  &nbsp;

      I have tried to lift France out of the mud. But she will return to her errors and vomitings. I cannot prevent the French from being French.  Charles De Gaulle    *How can you identify a French Infantryman? --Sunburned armpits!  *Whats the difference between a dead rabbit on the road, and a dead Frenchman on the road? --There are skid marks before the rabbit!  *French Knock Knock Joke: Knock Knock. Who's there? I give up.    *A long time ago, Britain and France were at war. During one battle,the French captured an English major. Taking the major to their headquarters, the French general began to question him. The French general asked, "Why do you English officers all wear red coats? Don't you know the red material makes you easier targets for us to shoot at?"  In his understated English way, the major informed the general that the reason English officers wear red coats is so that if they are shot, the blood won't show and the men they are leading won't panic.   And that is why from that day on French Army officers wear brown pants.   *Why wouldn't the Statue of Liberty work in France?   --Because she has only one arm raised.

MY take on this story is that it isn't the run-of-the-mill left-wingers or anarchists doing this.  It could VERY WELL be (and would surprise me if it weren't) TERRORISTS ("jihadis") enlisting the assistance of the unsuspecting, reckless and gullible of the fringe groups.  I can't say whether the "fringe groups" would willingly assist terrorists, but I certainly hope not.  Hopefully since they like to think of themselves as "intellectuals" (ha!), they will think about being USED by those who want ANY American dead, no matter the political ideology.  Hey, left-wingers/anarchists/Bush-haters:  THE BAD GUYS WANT TO KILL YOU, TOO!

He stepped on a land mine in Afghanistan Christmas 2002. President Bush came to visit the wounded in the hospital. He told Mike that when he could run a mile that they would go on a run together. True to his word, he called Mike every month or so to see how he was doing. Well, last week they went on the run, 1 mile with the president. Not something you'll see in the news, but seeing the president taking the time to say thank you to the wounded and to give hope to one of my best friends was one of the greatest/best things I have seen in my life.

       CHANGING A LIGHT BULB THE CHRISTIAN WAY     How many Christians does it take to change a light bulb?    Charismatic:Only 1 Hands are already in the air.  Pentecostal: 10 One to change the bulb, and nine to pray against the spirit of darkness.  Presbyterians: None Lights will go on and off at predestined times.  Roman Catholic: None Candles only.  Baptists: At least 15. One to change the light bulb, and three committees to approve the change and decide who brings the potato salad and fried chicken.  Episcopalians: 3 One to call the electrician, one to mix the drinks and one to talk about how much better the old one was.  Mormons: 5 One man to change the bulb, and four wives to tell him how to do it.  Unitarians: We choose not to make a statement either in favor of or against the need for a light bulb. However, if in your own journey you have found that light bulbs work for you, you are invited to write a poem or compose a modern dance about your light bulb for the next Sunday service, in which we will explore a number of light bulb traditions, including incandescent, fluorescent, 3-way, long-life and tinted, all of which are equally valid paths to luminescence.  Methodists: Undetermined Whether your light is bright, dull, or completely out, you are loved. You can be a light bulb, turnip bulb, or tulip bulb. Bring a bulb of your choice to the Sunday lighting service and a covered dish to pass.  Nazarene: 6 One woman to replace the bulb while five men review church lighting policy.  Lutherans: None Lutherans don't believe in change.  Amish: What's a light bulb?

       urlLink WorldNetDaily: Islam's violent core   "Part of Osama's fatwa – dated February 1998 – proclaimed:    The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies – civilians and military – is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the al-Aqsa Mosque [in Jerusalem] and the holy mosque [in Mecca] from their grip, and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim.   This is in accordance with the words of Almighty Allah "and fight the pagans all together as they fight you all together," and "fight them until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in Allah."    This means  YOU --the fatwa is against  YOU .    If  you  don't support the war against these Islamic swine, you're not just anti-American, anti-Israeli, or anti-Western, you are if nothing else, ignorant and suicidal.

Found this on a member posting on today's Move America Forward newsletter.   Quote from the article (read it all though!): "A devout Muslim fundamentalist does believe that if he touches anything from a pig at death, his is doomed forever. So may I introduce the new Secret super-weapon against Muslim Terrorists—missiles and airburst bombs filled with pig parts. There should be special public ceremonies in which our bullets are baptized in pig’s blood."

Notice that whenever the going gets tough for the UN (i.e. Iraq), they order their people to bolt the scene.  It would never occur to those foolish pansies to actually defend themselves, as Israel rightfully does.  WHY ARE WE EVEN PART OF THE UN?  WHY is the UN headquarters in this country?  They don't deserve the dignity of having their little clubhouse here.  They OUGHT to be in some no-man's-land third-world country, since that's what the UN really is for.  A bunch of nobodies getting to pretend they have any tangible power, while the people of their own crappy little third-world countries are oppressed and starved to death, if not outright mass-murdered, plus jack-booted socialists/Nazis/assorted low-lifes like France, Germany, etc.    Basically, WHO GIVES A SHIT what these crackpots think about the security wall?

Drudge says Fox will fight back..."Developing..."  The only reason the other media outlets are anti-Fox is because they have lost viewers (like me) who are sick and tired of the same tired old SELF-LOATHING liberal propaganda they have been force-fed forever.  Anyway, it's not like Sean Hannity (for example) is reporting news, he (AND Alan Colmes) is doing COMMENTARY, which is obvious to anyone who watches.  Duh!  Note also that the hateful Moveon.org is giving their full support.

[See both affidavits below.]  “Additional documentation will follow.

He has declined to release fiscal policy plans until after the election, opting instead to issue only vague, expensive spending proposals. On Sunday, however, Kerry flip-flopped and told ABC’s “This Week” that he would not rule out a middle class tax increase in case of “emergency.” Kerry refused to define what he meant by “emergency,” but his expensive new spending programs are sure to require additional tax revenue." ... "This strategy appears to follow the model first popularized by candidate Bill Clinton and then followed by many governors at the state level. In 2001, gubernatorial candidates Mark Warner (D-VA) and James E. McGreevey (D-NJ) ran on explicit no tax increase pledges to the voters. Once elected, they fabricated a crisis and substantially raised taxes, just as Clinton did. Kerry is following the same model."  Take Action Now!  Tell John Kerry to  forswear all tax increases and sign ATR's Taxpayer Protection Pledge , like President Bush has!

       urlLink (ONE) Veteran retracts criticism of Kerry    Kerry's former commanding officer, backed off one of the key contentions. Lieutenant Commander George Elliott said in an interview that he had made a ''terrible mistake" in signing an affidavit that suggests Kerry did not deserve the Silver Star -- one of the main allegations in the book. The affidavit was given to The Boston Globe by the anti-Kerry group to justify assertions in their ad and book.   OK, so what?  This doesn't invalidate everything ELSE.  LCDR Elliott (who had originally recommended Kerry for the Silver Star):  ''It makes me look kind of silly, to be perfectly honest." "I simply have no reason for these guys to be lying, and if they are lying in concert, it is one hell of a conspiracy. So, on the basis of all of the information that has come out, I have chosen to believe the other men. I absolutely do not know first hand."   Those questioning Kerry's medals, (James) Rassmann said, are ''angry about John speaking out against the [Vietnam] war."    And so they--and the rest of us--should be, in the way he "spoke out" against the war!  Where's the book on THAT?

       urlLink Research Topics--Iraq:  More Than Winning Elections   This is an article (by Hiwa Osman, an Iraqi) that argues against politicizing of the war.  Unfortunately, he as well as everyone knows it's a little late:  it's been a political issue for the Anti-Bush crowd since the beginning.  Osman correctly says that the anti-war rhetoric spouted by Kerry's supporters (Moore, etc.) and Kerry himself is hurting the cause:   "For those who lived under Saddam's reign of terror, the U.S.-led war was liberation, regardless of the underlying U.S. motives. Few Iraqis have any desire to return to that regime. Nor do they wish to live under a harsh Islamist theocracy. Both are possibilities if the insurgents are victorious.   It is hard to imagine that Americans would want to see either scenario play out -- certainly they would not wish it upon themselves.   But those American liberals who are willing to use a simplistic "Bush lied to us, therefore the war was wrong, therefore we should disengage" line for political expediency are fostering such a possibility, promoting an outcome that would hurt the United States and Iraq.   These people appear unable to see the larger national security issues at stake with this line of rhetoric."    This isn't about patriotism and the left complaining that people call them "unpatriotic" for their dissent.  This isn't about stifling freedom of speech.  This is about our national security, plain and simple.  The terrorists in Iraq are energized by Americans' apparent lack of will to carry on; as far as I'm concerned, the anti-war (anti-Bush) crowd have blood on THEIR hands.
