      Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh man, I always hate Sunday mornings because of what I do on Saturday nights!  I really should be working on the new  urlLink Urban Boy of the Week  page, because a few of you guys have e-mailed me about it.  I'm not sure that's gonna happen today, though, because I am really HUNG (over) ... haha.  I think today may be a day of rest!  BTW, if you want to be the VERY FIRST featured hottie for Urban Boy of the Week, now is a good time to let me know!  E-mail me at:  urbanboys AT hotmail DOT com

      Hey ... my name's JJ and this is my online diary.  A couple years back, I used to publish this journal on urbanboys.com, which no longer exists.  Basically, I chronicled my "sexcapades" and those of my friends.  It was a lot of fun, and it helped me to meet a LOT of great guys ... guys that I will be friends with for life.  But, it was VERY time consuming.  I'm thinking using Blogger will make it much easier, and I've decided to give it another try.  I'll also use this journal to keep you updated on what's going on with my other sites (like  urlLink http://urbanboys.blogspot.com  and  urlLink http://urbanboyoftheweek.blogspot.com ) and how things are going in general with me.  So, not just sex sex sex this time :-)  But, I'm sure there'll be plenty of that, cuz I'm still addicted! (Hahaha)

       Hey ... I'm baaaaack ...  Lots of you guys have e-mailed me, asking me to start up the UrbanBoys newsletter again.  I know how much many of you enjoyed it.  Well, how about a compromise?  I'll start this blog, and you can all help me out.  Let me know what you want to see ... it's all yours!  Right now, I'm just getting things set up ... in the next few hours or days, I hope to get the format ready and get started!
