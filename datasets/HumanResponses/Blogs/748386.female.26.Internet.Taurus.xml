      Ever have one of those days when you feel like you could say just about anything to anyone? Yesterday I did. And it totally backfired on me.  Now normally, when I am in my grocery store, I keep to myself and do my business. On this day I was at the fish counter, paroosing the fine selection of salmon steaks and noticed that there was a customer waiting. This guy was just standing there, stoned cold, staring at the fish. There wasn't a clerk around, so I walked over to the deli to get someone to help me. The clerk sees me, and starts to walk over. As we're walking back, he says 'who was first'? In a very animated manner, I say 'well, i came over to get someone, but he was waiting, so he can go first, so yeah, go ahed man!'   The guy waiting kind of smiled and said 'thanks...'. So the guy orders 4 jumbo shrimp.  I look at the shrimp and say 'Wow! those are REALLY big, eh?!'.   And no response.  I was all set up to start joking about the size of the shrimp, i felt primed and full of humourous ammunition. I was ready for anything. And I got shot down.  I should have known better than to start a conversation with someone who didn't have the balls to go ask the Deli clerk for some help.

      In case you've never met me before, I should warn you. I should warn you that I can be what some may call a smartass. Oh, for the first little while, you'll think i'm just your average normal friendly neighbourhood chick. But after I've gotten to know you, i will insult you in a demeaning manner. And it's all for humour.

      Last night, I attended a party with people from work and some other friends. We were celebrating the opening of the May 2-4 long weekend (Victoria Day). It can be a bit problematic when you start drinking at 4 pm. In the end I think we all had a good time.  About half way through the night, I was standing in the kitchen making a drink (surprise, surprise). We started talking about traveling, and one co-worker who is becoming a citizen brought up an interesting issue. He has lived in many places, some where wars have happened, and his point was this: you don't realize how important or precious your life is unless it's in danger. People who live in countries where they know their life could be taken away within minutes are far more serious about life, they treasure it.   Here, in Canada, we are so easy going and laid back because we have nothing to fear (or so most of us think). I think this also makes us a bit complacent about life. We get wound up in trivial issues like what do I wear today, what diet should I be on, or which car should I drive. If only some of us could see other places, and experience the life of someone who treasures it, maybe our opinions on multi-culturalism and the importance of our own lives would change.   There always has to be a balance though. Even though we may be a bit complacent, because our lives are not in danger we are more laid back and we don't care what place someone else is from, or what religion they are, or what colour of skin they have. As long as everyone had a drink in their hand, and someone to chat with, we were all fine.

      I work with a group of fairly intelligent, well-versed adults. Today 3 of us attempted to assemble a small, child-sized desk from Ikea. It took 2 attempts for us to get it right.  I think that assembling Ikea furniture brings out people's true talents and faults. There are the people who take one look at it and say 'no, I'm not helping.' Those are the smart ones, the ones that know better than to start assembling a desk at 5:30 on a beautiful spring afternoon. Then, there are the people like me, who jump right in and say 'I'll do it!' just because I had nothing better to do and I'm sick of looking at a computer screen.   My new rules for assembling Ikea furniture: 1) One sole person is in charge of the project. The other person is only there to help with holding, accessories, and passing you the allan key. 2) Always read the instructions all the way through before attempting to build your item. 3) Never take advice or help from people other than your assistant. 4) If you screw up in assembling, blame it on the assistant. 5) Always have beer ready for reward at the end of the assembly process.  We finally assembled the desk, it is waiting in all its glory to receive the Imac testing station tomorrow. Now if I can only get that network cable to reach....

      I am trying out this new online dating site called  urlLink LemonTonic  - it's connected to your .net passport account. So far, I've only completed the profile, but already I'm thinking to myself that this is way too limiting. I had to answer a series of questions to narrow down what type of person I am, and who I am looking for. I am sorry, but I don't think that I can sum up who I am in 35 questions. Especially when none of the choices in the drop-down menu describe my answer. I suppose that I had to get as close as I could. (it's like horseshoes...)   They say you can play games, chat, surf the web together. I would rather actually go outside, in the fresh air, and go for a walk to see who's on my street corner. Talk to that guy with the strange tatoos. Ask him what the hell he does for a living. See if I feel that feeling, you know, the one in the pit of your stomach that's trying to tell you something. Somehow, I don't think you can simulate that online. My view is that we're human - we've got so many other senses to use, and the net inherently doesn't allow us to use them. Touch, smell, pheremones intermingling.... These are things that have always been important to me. In my opinion, the world needs more real connection. Let's use what we were born with: instinct.  The one thing that I think would make the LemonTonic site better is allowing more room for creativity with your answers. If only I could say what I really meant from the outset, then maybe I could get an even better match. And that one nerdy guy would stop showing up in my search results.

      You've gotta love public transportation. It's full of interesting people, sights, sounds, and of course, smells.  I got onto the subway this evening to go downtown and the first thing I noticed: the smell. It's that smell that permeates old subway cars, and makes you wonder, is that urine? Sniff. Wait, don't sniff. Again, is that urine? It smells faintly like it, just enough to let you know that it's there. But it could just be the funk of the old subway car....  As I'm sitting in the seat, I start wondering to myself: am I sitting in the pee-spot? Could this be the precise area that an incontinent old man could not hold it in any longer? I wondered, and I wondered. What could have made the smell? Was it that old man, or was it a newborn baby? Or maybe someone's dog got freeked out by the sound of the wheels screeching against the tracks as the train took the big curve at union station... So many possibilities.  I realized that by the end of the trip, I couldn't smell it anymore. Oh no, now I'm going to leave the train smelling like pee and no guys will want to talk to me.  So I get to the bar, and guess what. NO guys talked to me. So I decided to go home early and blame it on the pee-train.

      Today was one of the greatest days I've had in a long time. I had the opportunity to be with my family, and to be reunited with some family members that I haven't seen for a very long time. I don't know how, but my mom managed to keep it a secret, not letting anyone know who the "specials guests" were. I was thinking and thinking, running through family members and old friends who the special guests may be. When they arrived, my brothers and I were pretty shocked. I almost started crying when through the patio door walks my grandmother whom I haven't seen in almost 10 years. She was accompanied by my aunt and cousin who I hadn't known ever - the last time I saw her, I was probably about 2 years old. It was great to get to see them. I feel like I have found some surprise family members. Thanks Mom!

      I was looking around  urlLink LemonTonic  again today, really analyzing all those little pictures that guys put up of themselves there. I was looking at their faces, then I started looking at the backgrounds. You can learn a lot from those details... Here are some tips for you guys out there, if you want more or instant interest:  1) make your photo a bit different - Tilt your head a funky way, or make it black and white or sepia tone. It also helps if you have a good friend who's a photographer and can take a kick-ass, well composed photo of you.  2) limit the background - I want to see more flesh! It really pisses me off when like 75% of the photo is your grandma's cottage and 25% of you. A better Ratio would be 75% of you and 25% background.  3) take note of the state of the room - I get really turned off when I see your dirty laundry on top of your mattress, or your dirty dishes piling up in the sink. Cmon, save that until after you know you've got the girl, and she can bitch you out for it.  4) wood doors as a background - No. Just don't do that, please. It reminds me of my parents basement.  5) basement windows - We can tell when you live in a basement apartment. Girls are perceptive that way, the short curtains give it all away.  I like things in 3's or 5's, so I'll end the list there.  What should you take from this? Well, it depends on what type of woman you want to attract. If the type of woman you'd want to attract would care about your photo and what's in the background, then man, you've got some work ahead of you. Go find yourself a photographer friend and beg them to take some practice shots on you. If you really don't care about how you look, or you think that you look great already (again, girls are perceptive, we can tell how confident or phoney you are) then you don't have anything to worry about. A little effort goes a long way....

      Being relatively new to blogging, I was thinking to myself today that I've got to decide what the cutoff line is for my personal diatribes. There are many things that I wish I could purge here. However, even if I used fake names, etc. people would still figure it out. A friend asked me today why I change my display name on MSN. I told her that it's reflective of the mood i'm in. I keep the root name, but change my tagline at least weekly.   The name I've chosen this week is my name followed by: if There's Something Inside That You Wanna Say... I told her simply that it's a lyric from a song. Yet it so fully describes how I've been feeling lately. There are many things that I'd like to say that are beyond the blog, things that I would normally keep to myself.  This has made me think about all the times in my life when I said stuff that I really shouldn't have, times where I opened my mouth and the words just slid out of my face before I could stop. Man, I wish I could take some things back. Other things, it was probably good that I said them at the time. It was good that I spoke from my gut and didn't stop to think.   At least with blogging I can always sit and stew over it before I post... In real life I rarley get that opportunity.

      I managed to make it outside for a run today. I love spring. I love the smell of wet grass and the feeling of mud splashing up my shins as I run through puddles. I love the pungent green colour of the trees and the crunchy sound of the trail underneath my clumsy feet.   I noticed when I was running that one shin gets sore quicker. I've heard before that's a sign of dehydration, the smaller muscles start to get crampy first. Then I thought, maybe there's something wrong with the way I run. I started to look down at my feet as I ran, I did this for a bit in a residential area. People out with their kids and doing their gardening gave me strange looks, so I thought it best to stop. When I did, that feeling seemed to go away. I guess when you focus on something else, like remembering to breathe,  the other pesky thing seems to disappear.   I got home just in time for the rain to start. As I took off my shoes I noticed the mud all up the backs of my legs. When was the last time you had mud all over you? Probably not since you were a kid. I love spring.   Music: classic bowie Mood: not so Minnesota, a bit confused but happy in general Motivation: the search for my meaning of love

      Today was a sucky-ass day. The weather here sucks. It's been raining on and off all weekend. I would rather be hanging out at the beach, but I guess it's not all a waste. I have a side project I'm working on at home. It seems like I can't pull myself away from the computer - I did manage to drag my butt downtown for a while and purchased some movies - Requiem for a Dream and Amelie.   The last time I watched Amelie, it was raining outside, and at the end I cried. (that's pretty rare for me to cry at a movie.) The exact same thing happened again this afternoon when I watched it. I think that I deliberately wanted to watch the movie again just to see if I would cry at the end, and I did. So I guess this means that I'm adding Amelie to my fave movies list.  If it's raining again tomorrow, I'll watch Requiem. If it isn't, I will be outside running around the streets, sniffing the freshly-cleaned rain soaked city air, trying to get my stamina up for the  urlLink marathon  (eeeek! what have I gotten myself into?). :P

      Sometimes you don't realize what you have until you don't have it anymore. I am visiting my parents in an area outside of Toronto (north of the city). Last night I went out bar-hopping with a relative in Barrie. Now I am grateful that I live in a city with such a good selection of clubs and bars. It's not like I'm a regular clubber, I go out once in a while. But when I do, it's usually a much more interesting and rewarding experience than last night.   We felt way older than the college kids in their flirty miniskirts and tube tops, and way younger than the bands rockin the 70's and 80's music. We were in this age-void that barrie seemed to lack of people in their mid-to-late twenties. What the hell gives?? It seems like in Toronto, that's the only age group of people I can meet.  I think my mom summed it up best when I told her of our lovely night out: The college kids are still in school and single. The people our age are married and/or have kids. Anyone older is divorced. I suppose that what you are in one place is not what you are in another...

      Forgot to mention about what happened this morning. I got up early , on purpose to get to the doctors office. You see, I've lived here for almost 2 years and still don't have a normal family doctor (sad, I know -  I never got around to it yet.) So I have to go to this walk-in clinic to see a doctor. I called yesterday and they said that he's going on vacation as of tomorrow. If I want to see him, I'd better get there today.   I drag my ass, freezing cold in my new skort (it's always windy in my neighbourhood for some reason) to the doc's office. I get all the way there, and I wait for like 10 minutes behind this old guy filling out the form right at the window. Finally I get my chance to talk to the girl behind the counter, and she asks me for my health card. And of course, like a doofus, I don't have it. So I pretty much had to forfeit my chance of seeing him. I got sooo mad at myself, started to huff and puff, and finally made it home.   I get home and start looking for my health card. Damit, I can't find it. I start to panic. Then I realize: duh - it's in my smaller change purse, which I take out when I go running. Which I had in my stupid purse all along. FFFFFFF!!!!! At least on the way home I saw two interesting things: a child walking to school in his buzz lightyear halloween costume, and a guy walking and shaving at the same time. At that precise moment I thought to myself, damn, I love this city, but I want to live in an even more bizarre, high-paced place like NYC or L.A. or something.

      Today we had a big meeting at work. Just before the meeting I was talking and doing something, and a co-worker said that he wants to record my voice for a cartoon... This is something I've heard many times in my life. Every once in a while someone says to me that I should be a voiceover or cartoon voice actor because apparently, I can do voices and impressions well. I am beginning to think that maybe this is true. I'm not even trying, I'm just being my stupid, smart-ass self, not even thinking about how it comes out.   Since I was on the voice kick, I offered to read aloud the results of a survey that we all took about our company, our new logo, website, etc. Yipee! I found myself trying to pronounce everything correctly - I guess a that point I was feeling a bit self-consciuos about what comes out of my mouth. I did okay, except I started cracking up laughing halfway through some of the answers... that's not so professional I suppose. Oh well, I did my little part.  Maybe I should start Voice Blogging? I've gotta see what this is all about first though.... see the next post for the first test of ME audio blogging!!!

      I've found my latest fave clothing item. I think I shall live in them all summer long (if it gets warm again and I can tan my legs...) This is: The SKORT.   Now for those of you who don't know, it's part skirt, part short, and ohhhh man.... A WHOLE lot of fun. I bought 2 of them on sale at old navy this week. It's all the fun of a skirt with none of the worry that you're gonna show your nether regions to an unwanted viewer. The skort is everything I ever wanted in a clothing item. Actually what I really would like in a clothing item is self-washing, stain and odour resistance, pits-of-despair blocking, and wrinkle-free-ness.  The Bhangra part, well, I'm just discovering and rocking out to right now. I'm gonna drive my neighbours mad with my music. MUAHHAHAA!!  What did I learn at work today? Apparently, I'm always the busiest, but I never follow my schedule. I guess I'm doing okay because I've still got my job. No clients called me honey, but one was a using very "colourful" language on the phone today - I don't get enough of that. (People actually being real and not all stuffy and business-ey)  Ooh, I finally got my passport for the first time in my life! Now I can go places I couldn't before... If only I could find someone to sweep me off my feet to Mexico or Cuba or *somewhere* warm, I'm all set.

      Today at work, I had a telephone conversation with a client. We recently met in person after talking on the phone/emailing for the past year or so. He is definitely older than me, like probably my father's age. Today on the phone he says "hello, beautiful" Well, gee, I didn't really have a problem with that. That's fine, he's giving me a compliment, he's boosting my ego a little bit so I'll give him a discount on the changes to his site. (yeah right, nice try buddy). Maybe I should give him the benefit of the doubt, maybe he was just trying to be sweet.   Near the end of the conversation, when I'm trying to wrap up what's to be done, he slips in a "thanks, honey".  Honey? WTF?  Again, I'm trying to give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he sees me as a daughter-ish type woman... At that point in the conversation, he had just finished telling me about his daughter's upcoming wedding.  This has lead me to wonder: is this only the beginning of this type of idiosyncrasies that will occur along my career path? When are clients going to stop referring to me as "honey"? Do I really seem that young, innocent, and cute? I mean I am 26 years of fricking age for god's sake. How many times should I let this happen before I say something to him? Then, what do I say?? Maybe I should just casually slip in a mention of the BF... Maybe I should give his account over to one of the guys. Let's see how sweet he'll be on them. ;)

      I took a big breath this weekend... the BF and I went to the  urlLink Toronto Zoo . I felt humbled by my mere existence as a human. There are so many things in life worth taking the time to look at. Animals and nature being one of the greatest, in my opinion. It's amazing how friendly people were at the zoo. The zoo is full of people with kids, tourists, and couples. People who are all generally in a good mood. It was a perfect day, sunny, but not too hot.   My favorite new animal: the river otter. Who knew? I could watch that little guy all day. He would do a circuit: Run from the fence to the edge of the pond, dive into the pond, do a little circle, then do a bigger circle around the outside of the pond, then back up onto land, to the fence again. The other otter was laying there sunning himself on the rock. What a simple life. I wish that I could be living it.  This weekend made me slow down and think about the things that I take for granted. My freedom, the amazing country that I live in, the people around me that care for me - these are things that I don't even realize that I have sometimes. It's like walking past a picture on the wall that you've had hanging there for years. Once upon a time there was a reason that you put it there. But you get used to it and it becomes a part of the wall. This weekend made me want to be a bit more conscious about my life, aware of what I do and how it affects everything and everybody. This feeling could also be attributed to  urlLink the day after tomorrow , I saw it twice this week. Amazing effects, shitty acting. We made up for it by watching  urlLink American Movie , what a great film. I'm gonna go find out what's next for Mark and Mike...

      I have been convinced for some while now that there is a medical condition which I am afflicted with. This, I would call Severe Song Repetition, or SSR. I am sure that there is a proper medical term for this condition. There has to be. It must afflict many people, am I right?  I made the mistake a couple of days ago of downloading some  urlLink Justin Timberlake  songs. (don't ask me why I did it, it was just a phase...) Big mistake on my part. How the hell does he write such, infectious, catchy, poppy tunes? Ever since I've heard this "rock your body" song I can't get it out of my head. I've tried everything; listening to lots of other music, listening to nothing, talking, whatever. It all does not work. I consciously force this song out of my head, then before I know it, it's back in there. Fuckin song. This is creepin me out.   I think quite possibly the worst song to get stuck in anyone's head I heard being whistled by my boss today. That's the song from  urlLink Super Mario Bros . I really hope that one doesn't get in.  If anyone has some suggestions, or knows of a support group or something, please let me know. Right now I'm trying to ward it off with some  urlLink Prodigy ,  urlLink Outkast , and  urlLink The Beta Band , . What happens if my affliction only gets transferred to another song? Will this haunt me for the rest of my life? I really love music and don't want it to make me go mental

      I got a Gmail account today! (Thanks to  urlLink Steve !) I like the fact that there's soooo much space, all your mail is searchable, and it makes "conversations" (email threads). I can't wait to try it out more. One thing that kind of freeked me out right off the bat... The ads that appear on the side for things related to what is written in your email. I'm definitely going to have some fun experimenting with that! Let's see what ads will display when I'm talking about freeky monkey sex... or overthrowning the government.. is there a book at amazon about that?  Guess I'll find out.  The best thing about my new Gmail: I didn't have to buy it on Ebay!

      It is happening, slowly my family members are getting blogs. Oh no! Now we will all be reading each other's minds and their friend's minds... It started when I told my mom about my blog, the first week I started this... Suddenly, she's reading it daily. And guess what? The phone calls have reduced. I guess I can sum up my life and interesting events into one convenient publishable format.  First it was my step-niece... Now my brother has started one. Perhaps soon, this will be an evolving online family conversation and history book all rolled into one. If only we could have bad-ass arguments and all the family secrets spilled out there... but we don't have those (that I know of yet).   So I guess soon my digital and personal relationships will be melding into one space. I was thinking about this notion a couple of months ago. About a notion of separating the "digital" self from the normal self. What we write in email, put in a profile, or choose to display in our blogs is only some edited and polished angle or chunk of the total truth of who we are. Nothing beats seeing your family and friends and being with them in real person.   So mom, where's your "tales from the garden" blog already? You've gotta get a digital camera and show us the progress on the back yard...

      You've got to see the movie  urlLink Napoleon Dynamite .  It's a timeless classic, (literally, I couldn't tell what decade some of those people were from...) very funny. Napoleon is a force to be reckoned with. His best friend Pedro is righteous as the class president.  The crowning moment of the film is the scene where Pedro says his speech to the student body, then Napoleon follows it up with his "skit". (An excellently choreographed dance scene.)   "well can you bring my chapstick at least?"

      I saw this  urlLink personality test  linked from  urlLink Jay's  blog, sometimes I can be a sucker for these things:  20 Questions to a Better Personality  This is the personality test that leaves the rest behind. It does make judgment calls, and it does assess your role in society, so faint of heart beware.   My results:  Wackiness: 68/100 Rationality: 72/100 Constructiveness: 62/100 Leadership: 76/100    You are a WRCL--Wacky Rational Constructive Leader. This makes you a golden god. People gravitate to you, and you make them feel good. You are smart, charismatic, and interesting. You may be too sensitive to others reactions, especially criticism. Your self-opinion and mood depends greatly on those around you.  You think fast and have a smart mouth, is a hoot to your friends and razorwire to your enemies. You hold a grudge like a brass ring. You crackle.   Although you have a leader's personality, you often choose not to lead, as leaders stray too far from their audience. You probably weren't very popular in high school--the joke's on them!  You may be a rock star.

      Every time I sit still, I feel like I'm still wobbling and rocking around. No, I didn't go on a bender this weekend, I went out for 3 days on the family yacht. (okay, so it's not quite a yacht, it's just an old- school  urlLink Chris-Craft ...) The boat serves its purpose well, it's comfy and easy to navigate through the  urlLink lock system  around   urlLink Port Severn . I played the part of Bow Girl most of the weekend. Yeehaw! I got to sit at the front and fend off the icky lock walls full of zebra mussels and lake gunge. I was a master of fender-dropping and zipping on the canvas by the end of our journey. I also was a sight to behold since I hadn't had a proper shower in 3 days... But now I've started a nice tan (the real reason that I believe boating was invented) and I got to spend a long weekend relaxing my brain.  The worst part of the trip had to be swatting mammoth mosquitoes away from my bare ass while trying to take a pee. It's like they sit in the washrooms, knowing that they are bound to get a bare-ass buffet when someone's had too much to drink.   The best part of the trip had to have been when my mom and I were in the washroom at  urlLink Big Chute . I was in the stall (squatting and swatting) when my mom came out of the stall next to me. I listened as an older woman asked her "are you the boat people?"   I almost died laughing right there. I know my mom and I were thinking the same thing. It was like THE perfect opportunity to abuse some poor old woman's innocent question. My mom answered her politely, told her where we were from, etc. Then the older woman left the washroom. I came out of the stall. Immediately, me and my mom looked at each other and started cracking jokes about what we could have told her ... Yes we were boat people... Um, no, I no speak-a English.... Yes, no, I live IN the big chute...  Some cool things that I saw: A fluorescent yellowy-green spider. Rock faces that plunged into the water with lichen, moss, ferns, and pine trees growing out of them. Lots of cottages, and islands with cottages on them that I wish I could afford. People who always wave to each other and say hello and help you dock. A group of Indian people, a group of Japanese people, and a group of retired people all wanting to see the same thing: nature. Argh. I think I miss it already. I Can't wait for my hiking trip in August.

      I haven't posted in a while because I've been on vacation! Whoopee! I've been Doing and seeing many things. The first couple days of my vacation my boyfriend and I had a getaway to Niagara Falls. We did much of the normal touristy things, the best part I think was beign able to pet and feed a beluga whale. The one that I got to pet was Osirus, seen here    After that we went for a great horseback ride through part of a conservation area south of Niagara Falls. What a great experience. I haven't ridden a horse since I was a kid, and this time it was a much better experience. My horse was Pebbles,     and my man rode Splash.     After a couple of days at home and puttering about the city,  urlLink my brother  and I went hiking for 4 days in Killarney (or kill-a-knee as he called it) provinical park. The terrain was more challenging than I expected, but worth it in the end. It was so amazingly quiet and serene. This was the first time I've ever gone backcountry hiking. My brother, on the other hand, is in the military and does this thing on exercises all the time. I think that I faired well, despite now having a blister under my left big toe (eww, grosss...).    We learned alot and met some really nice people. I saw the most amount of stars in my lifetime. I skinny dipped for the first time. I was afraid of bears, but none ever bothered us. The curious fish nipping at my nether regions while swimming and something else (still don't know what) that ran across my arm while stargazing surprised me. The best part of all of this is doing something challenging and finishing it.
