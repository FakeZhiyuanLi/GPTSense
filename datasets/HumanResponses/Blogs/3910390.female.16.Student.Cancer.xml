      I'm just sitting here wondering at what point in time did young people decide it's ok to lie to your parents? I mean I was under the impression that we aren't supposed to lie to anyone, least of all our parents. Not only because the Bible says not to lie&nbsp; but it also says to respect and honor your elders, lying isn't exactly what I would call respect! Not to mention it won't get you anywhere because God knows that you aren't telling the truth and the reason your parents discipline you is so that you will be a strong person and you won't have to face God without at least knowing what is right and what is wrong. I've lied to my parents a few times in the past and I'll tell you I always feel horrible about it. But lately I had done a couple of things that I knew they didn't approve of but rather than trying to hide it or lie to them I just told them the truth. Yes they did get upset but they didn't really even punish me, they just said that they hope I'd learned my lesson and that they were proud of me and glad that I just told them the truth. Where as I remember when I would lie to them and they'd find out and it would be like WW 3 in the house. So take my advice because I have seen both sides, just tell the truth, you'll feel better and your parents will be more civil!!

      I was asked today why my fiance' bought me such a small diamond. Ok so it's not a four karat diamond. But since when did women start marrying men just for diamonds? I mean I guess I have it all wrong because I'm marrying my fiance' because I love him and my life feels empty without him. Besides the Bible says "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and rust destroy and thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth or rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal, for where your treasure is there your heart is." Matt 6: 19-21. Am I the only one who thinks that how big the diamond is or if you even have an engagement ring, doesn't matter? What matters is that you love eachother and you love God and let Him be at the head of your relationship and your love will be strong enough to survive anything. I would venture to guess that at least 30% of the married couples today are not in love, they just get married for the money. Which is why there is such a high divorce rate. I think people need to wake up and realize that money and jewels are nothing with out love!

      Ok the swimming pool, it's 96 degrees, the lifeguards are tanning in their chairs. Which btw is what all lifeguards are paid to do....tan. And then there's the drama queens, sitting on the side of the pool with their feet in it so they don't mess up their hair or makeup. What do these girls get out of this kind of lifestyle? Is it fun to be so stuck up and to know that if you don't date the right guy, wear the right clothes, and speak the correct lingo ( which is goldspeak ) that your " friends" will just dump you and move on to the next loser that comes along? Maybe these girls should do as the Bible says and stop trying to impress humans and start trying to impress God. These girls will probably go to college to get a degree that in the end they won't be able to use. Then they'll get married at about 35 have 1 kid then divorce their husband ( who they only married for his money and "friends" ) and collect child support for the rest of their kid's life. While their kid grows up in a daycare, they will be out partying and acting like a bunch of teenage girls so strung out on hormones that they'll jump in the sack with any and every guy that comes along. Am I the only one who thinks this insane? Girls get a REAL life!!

      I woke up at 6:00 am and was just wondering why some people do the things that they do. Like molest some innocent child. I mean you can convince a 6 year old to do anything. But WHY? Why would you hurt them? And why would you do something to them that isn't just going to affect them at the time but for the rest of their lives?  The Bible says to " Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." Ok so then all these sex offenders and all that, they want someone to fuck their lives up so bad that they'll never be just an innocent 16 year old? Or maybe their excuse is it happened to them when they were young. And that makes it ok to do it to someone else? I thought we were supposed to learn from our mistakes. Or from other's mistakes. And what about the child, are they supposed to forgive the molester? I mean if you're supposed to do unto others, then I forgive them because I want to be forgiven. Am I stupid? And another thing when that happens to you, you never forget. There will always be that one image in your head that you can't get out, until one day you can't deal with it anymore and you just make yourself numb so you won't have to. But is it ok for a person to live like that? I don't get it, I mean when you make yourself numb it's not just numbness to those memories, it envelopes everything you feel. How can a body live like that?

      Time's crawling I'm waiting for Todd to call. I miss him, life sucks living this far apart. I have a green hoody of his, I'm wearing it. I wonder if tomorrow will be as slow as today? I mean what can one find to do when all there is to keep you company is a bunch of farm animals, her bitchy sister and ok lil bro? I can't say it's different from any other summer, lacking in things to do and people to do them with. But I begin to ponder, If Jesus Christ were sitting here next to me right now... what would He be doing? What would He say? Would He tell me to get off my pity party? Alright, so now I'm not feeling sorry for myself, but I still lack in things to do for the next half hour. I think I'll go sleep, my favorite pastime. Maybe tomorrow will hold something exciting, right and maybe there really is a Santa Claus.
