      Imagine a game taking place in a gameland that you could play on Gamecube,Playstation, or others. No violence,no killing spree. Imagine it as an RPG game Where you can see the desert that your walking in,blue sky,and you can hear yourself walking over rocks and looking for clues,and when you look down you see your feet with sandals on them like in the bible days. I was thinking maybe a game kind of like myst where you would have to find clues in Bible lands to find out what happned. A land like Aceldelma,Land of Paron,Land of Canaan,Bashan and more. But those lands each had something bad happen in them. If you went to the land of Aceldelma(the field of Blood) you wouldn't want to find Judas head Hanging on a tree!!!!!! But maybe there could be christian gaming. In the Bible the land of canaan had giants in it, With walled cities. hmm something to think about.The king of Bashan was a giant to!!!!! But you have to remember the line drawn between christian gaming and Blasphamy.   Game#1   One christian game could be one where you would try to name the land your in by walking around and finding clues.      Game#2   A Sims like game where you can stay at home,go to church,meet people. Help non christians,   Go on a food drive race?Deliver Bibles as fast as you can?Tithe 10% from your job.    Game#3   Walking around town casting evil things away from you. The cross would be your only weapen.    Game#4   A left behind game where you would try to save people before going to heaven in the rapture.   Or where if you don't make the right choices on Earth you would be the one left behind. You would have to resist the mark of the beast and renew your faith in God.SCARY huh?      Mostly all of that could really happen in your own life though.  I want to be a game designer some day for christian gaming!!!!!! But come on you know I have to come up with better idea's then that!LOL!LOL!

       Hebrews 11:1   Now faith is the substance of things hoped for,the evidence of things not seen.     How many of you have faith? How many of you have hope? When you pray you have to have faith and thats how miracles happen. I've prayed many times for God to heal me or other people that have pain and he has many many times. I believe that with one simple prayer the pain can go away in a matter of seconds. Any kind of pain that you have God can heal. I know some people that I told just kind of laughed and said "no!" thats impossible!" But with God anythings possible. Whats so hard to believe? If you dont then read  Hebrews Chapter 11  It tells about many things that happned throughout the Bible that has to do with the power of faith. You'll be amazed at some of the things that without faith would of never happned.

       When I first read Jonah I couldn't help but laugh. It's not that its a funny story but it's picturing a person literally running away from God to a different town called Tarshish because he didn't want to go to a town called Ninevah like God told him.    The story goes (in my own words from reading it)... God told Jonah to go to Ninevah to cry against it because it was wicked and agaist God. So he went to Joppa and found a ship that was going to Tarshish to flee from God(but nobody can flee from God of course) so he paid the fare. Then a great wind was in the sea that could break the boat. So the ship men wanted to find out who was causing the evil so they asked Jonah where he was from and other questions. Since Jonah told the men that he was fleeing from God they said what should we do to cast the evil away? Then jonah said "Cast me into the sea," so the sea will be calm for you. Before doing something like that they tried to row to land but the sea and wind was to strong. So the men   asked God what they should do, so they threw Jonah overbored and The wind stopped.   Then a fish swallowed up Jonah and he was in the belly of it for 3 days and 3 nights............   and that was just chapter 1 and you can read the rest. Chapter 2-4 then it ends.      The story just tells you that you can never run away from God.

      I believe that Everything in the KJV Bible is true.That the NIV and other Bibles are the biggest deception ever made. I let God lead my life,Prayer really works,miracles are always happening. Jews are not to be made fun of(I could never figure out why people make fun of them in the first place).Jesus died on the cross to save us from our sins and rose on the third day. Sins can be forgivin by asking God for forgiveness,I don't hate anybody,I don't hate non-christians. I learn to be a better christian every day,I do not believe in Pride,The Ten commandments are true,Everybody sins even christians of course.  For anybody who wants to know why I only read the KJV is because it's the closest to the original but not exactly. I don't think the words of the KJV should be changed. I have nothing against anybody who reads the NIV,NKJV, or others.I think its ok to read an amplified Bible as long as you look back at the KJV for the closest to the original words. But of course the first Bible wasn't written in English. (*_*) :-)  I agree that the original is the only true text like I said in the paragraph above. I also agree in daily devotianal books to(I never thought to put that in my blog)   WARNING:Not everybody will agree about my statement of faith.
