       For those of you who have just started to have interest in cycling, this is to help you in the long run in understanding and maintaining your bicycles.. However please take note that all the theories and techniques here are applied to either MTBs or ROad cycles.. I have much more interest in these two fields of bikes that any other.. But some tips can also be applied to other types of bikes..  When selecting a new bike.. the first thing to watch out for is the size of the bicycle.. The frame size will decide the comfort of the ride.. I personally had not much choice when it came to choosing bikes since the tech here is still pretty low but over the years I have seen more and more bike shops offering wide range of choice..  How to accurately choose frame will depend on your height and body weight.. A recommendation from the bike dealer should be good for a start..  As for second hand bicycles, I recommend that you go through the bike and search for any faults.. Paying too much for a bike that is about to go isn't worth the while.. Most important thing to me when it comes to buying second hand bicycles is the frame.. Like most other mode of transport, the frame is the most essential part.. though it is also upgradable, it is best to make sure that the frame is in good condition so that it doesn't break in half when you go riding with your new components.. Other parts such as forks, brakes, and etc can be easily upgraded with minimal cost depending on how much you are willing to spend.. One can choose from low end products to higher end products depending on budget..  If the frame of the bike is in good condition, the next thing to consider is the weight of the bike.. A bike that weighs too heavy will have you riding it instead of just riding on your own weight.. This does not matter to some people but I think weight of the bike is an important thing because you don't want to get tired b4 you even go anywhere far..  If all those things are up to standard, it is then the time to choose and decide if the paint of the bike should be renewed.. I think maintaining a good frame will keep you cycling in the long run.. Though cycling shops don't offer to respray your bikes, you can always check around car garage that do spray jobs.. Check out the price and how they would charge.. THen take your bike to the shop and have them remove all the components if you do not know how to do it yourself.. It's best to leave these things to the pros since there are many small components that might confuse you if you somehow misplace them.. However I feel it is also essential to know how to maintain your bike yourself..  to be continued...

       Bike 101 is everything you want to know about bike maintenance.. I created this site due to the fact that there aren't many people who create nice webbies about bike maintenance.. They are either lacking in graphic or info.. I will try to add more as I experience along the way but please be patient with me since I hardly have time these days to even breath!! Hehe.. Kidding.. I love bikes.. Period..

       I came about the sport since May 2004 and began to love and adore it's gracefulness and beauty.. I used to climb an average of twice a week but since assignments and cycling entered my life, there's hardly time to do it anymore.. HOwever climbing is one of those things that I will stick with for the rest of my life because I know it is meant to be.. It's something that suits me and I like the people and everything about it.. For those of you that have yet to try it, do get someone to go with you and find out what is it all about..

       Cycle -->  Bike Type : Road/Pavement Total time : 1.20.36 Average Speed : 21.4 km/h Distance Travelled : 28.83 km Odo : 225.9 km Max Speed : 43.5 km/h No of rides : 3  Went out in the morning due to some reasons I woke up.. I hardly slept which resulted in a half hour ride.. Then I went on again in the evenings after Don dropped me off.. The ride was good and I manage to hit an hour with 20km on the meter.. After that I went off to Center Point to meet up with Celeste which contributed to the additional 8.83km.. Everything is good and need to cycle more.. Can't wait to head Bangsar..

       Cycle -->  Bike Type : Road/Pavement Total time : 0.54.00 Average Speed : 20.7 km/h Distance Travelled : 18.75 km Odo : 197.0 km Max Speed : 46.0 km/h No of rides : One (Evening)  I think it's time for a rest from cycling and start doing some other work.. I think I don't have enough time to recuperate and resulting in me feeling tired before I should.. I know now that in about an hours time I can reach the distance of 18.75 km and thus I should be improving and not declining.. Went uphill twice today.. The ride was torturing but I need to push myself.. No pain no gain.. I should start categorizing the different levels of ride at different areas..  Might go TTDI for a ride tomorrow morning if Jeff is free..  ~end~

I'm not so enthusiastic about cycling to college no more.. Not that I don't like cycling but I'm so afraid of losing this bike.. I like it to bits..

       This is my dedicated site to cycling and everything I love about it.. I keep track of my training, my upgrades, maintenance and infos about bicycles.. I love both MTBs and Road bicycle.. Every since I young it was the only transportation for me and it requires minimal care if one knows where and what to take care of.. Nowadays as we speak I try hard to make at least a single trip out a day..  Instead of indulging my time in things that does no benefit to me, I cycle whenever I can and whenever I want to.. Well I still have time b4 working life kicks in.. ANyway for those of you who aren't interested in this, heck, each to his own..

      Apparently I have yet to embark on my tedious journey up north so I take this apropos moment to write here.. Have yet to sleep which is beginning to kick in a little into my head.. Watched two movies since 1 or 2 I think.. First Reservoir Dogs by Quentin and second,  urlLink Igby Goes Down  by who knows who..  My head is pounding.. My lack of sleep is the beget of this trauma.. Well then again I hate to think that I would have to be awake for the 6 hour journey.. Thank god Lincoln is coming to Pudu to fetch me.. Hate to hang around that place.. The trip back has been rather infuriating since the driver kept disappearing each time we'd stop.. I hope l8er it doesn't happen..  I'll have like 4 days to lay back before school kicks in again.. Can't really say I'm looking forward to it.. Now I know why they say it's best to continue studying and not work first then go on.. Really can't imagine how those people actually work and study at the same time.. Won't have much time to have a life then.. Well I guess we each have different roads with our own different reasons to why we do what we do..  Prob get my PS2 by tomorrow.. Bringing back a couple of DVDs to watch while I'm still free.. Most likely will be going to Jefferson's this weekend.. How long has it been? 3 weeks I think since I last saw him.. Oh yeah at his house warming bBq.. Miss Sonny boy so much.. Prob still horny as ever.. I doubt it will grow any bigger than it is..  Waiting for Shrek 2 to come out.. Might just go watch it but then again I hate going to the movies alone.. Don't even want to think about asking those two morons to go to the movies.. All they ever think of is their girl friends and their excuse for not being able to spend time with me is work.. I'm just obscure when it comes to having fun for them.. Sometimes I wonder why I still hang out with them but then again it's better than hanging out by myself.. *sigh*   Worm has her friends and Kel, is just too far away.. Jeff's too busy with work and Jefferson's too broke to do anything.. Gerald? Heck can't stop stoning.. Jason, well he's sick..  Sometimes I wish I was much closer to home.. I could at least come visit mum when I want to.. Dad, never talk much to him.. Came to realize that I don't even know much about him either.. Jeffrey's married and Terence, heck, can't even be bothered to know what's going on in my life..  I hope so much this course goes through.. I want it so badly.. Prob if I have the chance to take up photo journalism, I will.. Prob tell them that I am willing to go into Iraq and take photos if they wanted me to.. I just wish I could go travel.. See the world a bit and maybe, just maybe I might find some better place that I can fit in or if I get tired of it I can still come back here.. Is it just a dream?  This is one of the songs that I play from time to time.. It is the way I feel sometimes..  I started a joke, which started the whole world crying, But I didn't see, that the joke was on me, oh no, I started to cry, which started the whole world laughing, Oh, if I'd only see, that the joke was on me..  I... looked at the skies, running my hands, over my eyes.. And I fell out of bed, hurting my head, from things that I said..  Till I finally died, which started the whole world living, Oh, if I'd only seen, that the joke was on me..  Sometimes I really felt like crying at the end of it but I never seem to.. Haven't really cried since Suzanne.. I think my eyes have gone dry.. Some people think that I'm still thinking of her but I'm not.. I'm just lacking of emotions.. Got sucked dry since I didn't know how to love anymore.. I guess life without love to me is just meaningless.. which is why I constantly seek it but still unable to find..  The greatest thing you'll ever learn is to love and to be loved in return.. [Quote :  urlLink Moulin Rouge ]  I remember you asking me Kel, why do I seek it.. I guess the line above says what exactly what I been meaning to say.. Am I a fool? If you say so, then I am..  It's 7 in the morning now.. Time to go.. What's to come? Who knows..

      Will this be my last journal entry for the week? Very unlikely to be but then again the thought of going to the CC just doesn't hype me.. Cost me money in the long term and how am I supposed to express myself with all the shooting and bomb explosion going on around me?  Can't write at home first and then post it up later either.. They don't have diskette drives or USB ports.. Damnit!!  4th sem.. Haven't seen my schedule yet but I heard that there will be a lot of night classes.. Basically badminton on Mon afternoons is screwed.. Wonder what about climbing.. Have to ask worm that when I get back.. I just hope Jeffrey* is free when I get back.. Need his help to get the Internet fixed up.. Basically won't be seeing much of him for the next 4 months I guess.. Can't believe that he actually accepted the deal from his dad to work everyday at night.. He's just the typical chinese working for money without the considerations of actually enjoying his life..  Adviced him to get a laptop too but he seems reluctant.. I'm so afraid that he's gonna screw up my computer.. Not that I mind or anything but then again you never know when you might get viruses.. I wish I could have a laptop.. Would be travelling around everywhere with it..  The classes during the night doesn't affect me much.. I'm already diagnosed with insomnia.. haha.. sleeping late and waking up late is even better!! Won't miss classes either which is another plus plus.. I wonder when the results will be out.. I hope I do good.. I need to brush up even more this semester..  Heard from Swee Pheng about a week ago that Don will be working with Digi.. Not much difference for me.. He hardly come over these days after what happen last year.. His mum hates my guts I know but I hate hers too.. so we're even there..  Frankly speaking, my experience with people has been the weirdest ever since my stay there in KL.. People there aren't trusting and heck the people I know that welcome others to their home are mostly people from back here.. Mum's the best.. I never have to worry about her not liking my friends.. Anyone can come over and stay and wouldn't have to be worried about feeling uncomfortable..  I'm so going to miss home.. Prob will be staying up for the next week or so back in PJ.. I hate it when that happens.. I know I'm so going to miss mum.. Even though sometimes I get agitated by her compulsive nagging, I can't help but feel that she's been the greatest.. I pray god will watch over her when I'm not around..   Anyway.. gotta pack.. Need a backpack!! damnit.. *sobs*

      Yesterday.. what an agonizing day it was to me.. lack of sleep and had to drive to JB with mum mumbling about my driving most of the way.. Nagging is one of the thing she'll keep on doing until the time is right.. No point arguing with her.. It's one of those things I know I can't win.. Lack of sleep is bad enough..   What's wrong with my driving? Nothing really.. Haha.. Mum's just always worried about something.. A part of her that she passed on to me.. I find it unnecessary to worry when there's nothing consequential to be worried about.. Worrying is necessary when it is required.. But then again who knows what really happens? So why worry?  Got there about 12ish noon.. dropped Lincoln at the bus station so that he can head back to KL.. He's just so lost.. I'm sure he felt like talking to me about his prob with Francine but I'm just not in the mood to listen to that.. Insanity is doing something over and over again expecting different results.. What does he expect if he doesn't change? Relationships isn't always about other people changing.. Most of the time it is us doing the change and tolerating.. If he expects her to change, well good luck then.. Lost count how many of his girl friends that I have seen.. Most of them for a couple months.. Even a year is progress..  Anyway headed for Jeff's new house at Permas right after that.. Pretty cool house but if I am given choice, I would never have chosen it.. It's just too big.. He practically did the hall during the weekend and wanted me to paint the master bed room.. Which I did but took me the whole day to do it.. Couldn't even finish it in time, which eventually led to me feeling bad about it.. So sorry bro.. He's just so patient with people and with me.. I'm so glad that he found Cher Fang.. She's so patient with him..  RUlez for painting a room.. 1st decide which room.. 2nd decide which color.. 3rd screw it if someone disagrees with the color you are chosing coz you're gonna be the one living in it.. Jefferson did his hall with Bluish purple.. Totally cool.. Doesn't it look indian? Screw the indians.. they own purple? I didn't know that.. 4th make sure the room is properly set up.. Jeff had all these electrical wires still not yet fixed up.. I was afraid I might get zapped.. *BBBBzzzzzzz... aaahhh... pow!* 5th Clean the room off any dust, spider webs, cement that might have clung on to the wall and any uneven plaster that might look disgusting once you finish painting and end up regretting.. lol.. 6th tape up any window or switches that have direct contact with the wall.. saves you a lot of trouble.. trust me.. 7th papers.. newspapers.. get lots of em.. put em everywhere on the floor unless you want your tiles to look the same as the walls.. or better yet.. you are too free to actually go around wiping any paint that dripped... 8th ESSENTIAL (only a fool like me didn't know..) Start with corners, around switches, doors, windows and near the ceilings (unless you want the ceiling to be the same color too..) This is one lesson I learned.. Why do would I paint the corners first? Well it's the hardest of all and lemme tell you this.. rock climbing is way easier.. I think I climbed the ladder about 50 times yesterday and the bitch part of it was that you could only paint about 60cm + - each time I moved the ladder.. that was agonizing and testing my patience to the limit.. had to carry the tray of paint up and down too.. fuck! 9th Paint the remaining walls.. with ease coz everything else is in place.. trust me.. it helps.. I had to learn the lesson the hard way.. 10th either do what I did from no 4 to 9 or save all the trouble and pay someone else to do your dirty work.. but then $$$ gone.. *muahahaha*  I know it must have cost a bomb to renovate the house and which is why bro didn't hire someone to do it.. I'm so sorry I couldn't be of much help.. anyway he's leaving for KL on Wed evening.. no one will be around to superviser anyway..  We went for dinner at some restaurant and had curry fish head.. *saliva dripping* I ate like 3 bowls of rice coz I didn't have lunch and then rest a bit listening to his stories from Las Vegas and his visit to the  urlLink Grand Canyon .. I wonder if people went climbing down the Grand Canyon.. *wooah* I definately won't want to fall into the endless pits.. *prob end up in CHina or something.. hahaha*   Epilogue Drove back to Aunt Janet's for the night before heading back here.. I was out before I knew it..  The very moment I was paint the corners near the ceiling, I was wondering how Michelangelo Buonarroti painted the  urlLink Sistine Chapel(Cappella Sistina) . He must have hell of a lot of patience to paint something so significant.. For the love of art he must have had..

      This is one gorgeous  urlLink bike ..  One more year to go and I will sure as hell dump that dumb scooter of mine and go for either that or  urlLink this ..  That scooter has been giving me problems for way too long.. I can't even go anywhere with it for the fear of it breaking down.. It's unstable and so light.. The specs for a decent good bike is that it must have a certain amount of weight so that it doesn't get thrown off so easily.. it is also easier to stop that way and also bigger bikes have excellent brakes (disc brakes - front & back)..  Few company actually come up with good bikes.. or even if they do, I find it hard to actually like the designs that they have.. So far I have checked out - BMW, Kawasaki, Aprilla, Ducati, Suzuki, Honda and KR.. Each company has its distinctive design and performance..  PEople seem to have this perception that bikes aren't safe.. Well I feel it's subjective.. It depends on the rider.. Riding a bike means concentration and leaving behind emotions and anything that might distract the rider.. Riding a bike also means going with the flow.. which actually applies to all vehicles (to me).. Riding it slow doesn't mean that you'll be safe..  2 years now I've been on that bike and though I may have come close to an accident or two, it was due to the fact that I was either thinking about something or emotionally distracted.. Thank god for giving me chances...

      Um.. 7:10pm.. Slept as soon as I got back from JB just now.. It's so tiring to drive long distance.. I wonder how dad does it.. Well he relies on mum these days to do the driving.. To be continued...

      I just woke up and I had a dream.. Can't remember much now ironically but I know you were in it K.. Was it good or bad I don't know.. Don't want to label it either.. Hate to think of life that way these days.. It's much easier to go through without having to think of it being labelled.. Much much easier to go through it as it is.. Bring it on I say.. Whatever it is you can think of God.. I'm ready for it..  Shit.. I wanted so much to write down what I dreamt but after that conversation with Lincoln I practically forgot what I wanted to say.. I hate it when people bug me early in the morning.. My mood is just not good today.. Maybe it's the fact that I have to paint or maybe I know I will be leaving soon back to that hell hole or maybe it's because tonite is going to be so damn boring..  Hardly slept.. Woke up at 7.. that I remember.. Dehydrated.. Drank and went back to sleep.. Hope the journey is good.. Well I'm so used to this.. Damn I can't remember.. Forgot to bring my book.. It helps to write down as soon as I wake.. But since last month was so hectic, didn't even have time to linger in bed.. Had to rush to college everyday practically to class..  Trying so hard to be a good student.. Trying hard to persist through this course... It's interesting to study but at the same time it is so tiring.. I just want to move on and I hope no one gives me trouble.. So losing it these days and sanity is losing itself.. PEople tell me not to care but caring is the only time I will endulge myself in emotions.. Without it I think, I would be so utterly cold.. I'm not like that.. I never want to be like that..

      Want to get either  urlLink this  or  urlLink that  Tatonka. Glacier is much bigger holding 35 L where as Vento L fits around 30 L. I doubt I'd need anything bigger than 35 L. I can't carry too much either.. I'm so skinny.. prob the bag would topple me over.. haha.. But climbing helps.. Makes me tougher..  Can't remember how to choose which one though.. I remember Jefferson telling me that they'd measure your height and weight to know which suit you the best.. But anyway the problem isn't choosing which one to get but rather getting the $$ to buy it.. Probably will go to Peninsular Plaza once I save up enough money.. But heck with climbing and badminton every week nowadays, where am I going to get the money?  Oh ya.. prob when I get my internship or when the next gym fee is due.. Not going to gym anymore.. Just a waste of my time to work out one part of my body at a time.. Climbing will do.. and badminton for stamina..  Saw this  urlLink Sigg  bottle too and selling at $24 which is approx. 60 bucks here.. Would have gotten it but they didn't have the design that I wanted.. Saw the  urlLink Maglite  that I wanted too.. I regret not taking care of the one I had b4..  Want a D-camera too.. Still want that  urlLink IXUS I  I saw.. Not a DSLR but still usable.. It's small and compact.. How long does the battery last still lingers in my head..  urlLink IXUS 500  would be too much.. I think I would take me forever to save up that amount of money..  Wish somehow they would understand that I am really crazy about photography.. They used to take so many pictures b4 but now when I'm around, they hardly do it anymore.. It's just so unfair.. Am I not worth remembering? I regret using up my money to buy other things.. Should have saved it to buy what's essential..  Thought of selling my PS2 but then again I can't live without entertainment.. At least I get to play a little bit of games and watch DVD too.. but Sony is creating more online games than b4.. Ori games are just too expensive to buy..  Sigh.. Tired.. Sleep..

      Haha.. How ironic can it be.. That  urlLink Teva  I got for worm actually is on the net.. I didn't even see it when I was browsing through the webby the other day and it's exactly the same.. Haha.. Well just sent her the link.. Now she can sleep with ease, that's if she likes the design and if it fits.. That guy at the shop wasn't lying to me either.. It is a new sandal.. How new I don't know but it's still on the net new I guess.. hahaha...  3r1c

      Got back about 3 and a half hours ago from Sg.. Approx 8:20:pm  I knew what time it was becoz the bus was packed and like b4 I had to stand for one hour from Larkin to Ptn bus station.. So tired but glad that I am finally back home..  Tomorrow's another tiring day.. I know for sure.. Going to help Jeff to paint the house.. God.. So wish I don't have to do it but I know I can't and I won't.. I wonder if he'll come help me paint when I get my new house.. (*Sigh.. Hopes.. Dreams..*) Maybe I can get some money off him but then again I reckon he's broke too with all the renovating..  Thank god mum decided to cancel the tuitions and go with me.. Aunty Janet's place is so damn boring.. Nothing to do there and she doesn't even own anything except for a tv.. At least I don't have to wait for the bus and I get to come home and use the internet one more time b4 I go back up to PJ..   Sg.. So tired yesterday.. I didn't sleep the night b4 and I practically walked the whole day.. Took me 3 and a half hours too to get to Commonwealth..  Went straight to Queenstown to get em shoes for "worm".. she's lucky I have will power.. Wanted so much to get two Converse shoes for myself but heck a promise is a promise.. I hope she likes what I got her.. Well it's blue and it's flowery.. fits her description well but I just hope it fits.. So many things I wanted and I am thinking twice about going down there to work.. Maybe I will but then again I won't have my own bike.. So many chicks around too.. Could hardly concentrate where I was going.. It's so surreal to go there.. People there are like models..  I did have the money to buy em shoes but decided that it's best to save it first and check out Peninsular Plaza for the climbing shop that Pico talked about.. Finally did and got a pair of  urlLink Bufo "Spider"  shoes for like $80 which is around 170 here.. still lot more cheaper than getting them at the gym.. the minimum I think I have to at least fork out 300 ++ if I got em here.. Went to Somerset after that to check out HMV but couldn't find the shop that worm described..  When I looked around I couldn't help but notice that I am the only guy with long hair.. Sis says that it's not a trend or heck maybe it's the army thing that they went through.. I don't care about trends anyway.. It's just being a slave to the marketers.. So much truth is revealed studying advertising..   Had buffet for lunch with Terry and Sis but heck I hate buffet.. I'm not a big fan of food... so long as fulfill the desires of hunger, I don't really care what I eat.. I could hardly stay awake by then.. I did finally take a nap.. I didn't want to fall asleep watching Troy.. Oh ya.. cooking my food?? No way.. I don't mind if there's a proper kitchen and all but heck we're paying for it already.. why do I have to cook it??  After lunch we practically went window shopping around at Great World Plaza.. it's where bro got tickets for the show.. Went to this home decor show room and I can't wait to get my own place.. it's going to be so cool.. Gotta get this clock I saw there.. it cost $250 but heck I'm so crazy about it.. It flips by the minute and it's neither digital nor analog.. Well can be called analog.. it flips.. that's the whole point and it's so cool.. wanted to get this thing that tells the date.. it's like $13 but heck I know bro is so going to screw me so I didn't.. I know I would have if I went alone.. (*sigh*)  The movie was good I guess.. I'm just a movie maniac.. except if the story line is so utterly predictable or corny.. Never really like movies like "Scary Movie".. it's funny I know but heck it's just a waste of my time.. Even Simpsons is better and I get laughs too.. D'oh(imitating Homer)..  My leg got really cranky by the end of the day.. Seldom walk that much in a day.. I'm just lazy.. Anyway the good news was that sis couldn't walk that much either so instead of taking the MRT back to her place, we grabbed a cab.. (*Hoooooorah!!!*)  The truth is it felt so awkward seeing them.. I guess the amount of time we spend with each other is just too little.. I feel that way about Jeff too but heck they are still my bros..   Sis's cats are so big now.. so much fun!! But didn't have energy to play with em til the next day.. Fell asleep when I saw the bed.. went out in seconds.. Woke up at 3 but nothing on tv.. went back sleep at 5... woke up at 2 in the afternoon.. watched Beautiful Mind.. gotta get the DVD.. such a great movie.. Makes me wonder if I'm schizophrenic (also called dementia praecox).. But then again I don't hallucinate that there's people around me, talking to me.. Thank god.. I just speak to people on the net.. oh no.. I speak to the computer.. haha.. that's worse.. hahaha.. wonder if they have a term for that.. (Anyone know that, let me know..)  Had cereals (Banana Nut Crunch) with soya milk.. suprisingly good.. Went off at around 5.. Sis looks so tired.. but hanging on..  Now I'm home.. Lincoln came down.. Wonder what he's up to.. Said he has a job but why isn't he working tomorrow.. Don't want to ask too much either.. Just too tired to care..  Gonna watch Big Fish again I guess.. Too much reality can be sucky.. But I'm still happy.. I have new climbing shoes and I can't wait to try em out.. The toes feel pain like hell but heck it's for balance.. I wish I could have gotten that  urlLink pair (Five Ten V10)  but heck I've got no $$$ dammit!!  Patience.. Patience.. Going to work soon.. Get whatever I want then..  3r1c

      5 more hours to go and I can't sleep.. I did sleep but only for an hour or so.. I guess the last couple days staying up late changed my sleep time dramatically.. Hard to tune it back to normal again..  I'm going to so blur l8er when I reach sg but what the heck.. Sleeping just ain't the thing for me anymore..  Dad's gonna like so screw me.. But I guess he'll never understand why I like staying up so late..  Went outside for a moment to grab a ciggy.. Looked up at the skies and stop to stare.. Can't help but wonder why people hardly pay attention to the little wonders in life.. The sky was so clear and I could see stars.. the tranquility of the moment mesmerized me and made me want to know more about astrology.. I did try to search about them yesterday while online.. and I can't help but wonder if the stars I'm seeing right now have any names..   It probably does.. it's so human nature to own things.. to name things.. I'd probably name it after someone too if I discovered a new star.. but heck that's not my point..  Is there anyone out there that still appreciates these things besides me? No one cares about the world anymore.. and that movie "The day after tomorrow", well it might just happen this life time, looking at the way we destroy mother nature each day..  I can still remember clearly the words that best describes our species.. It was said by Agent Smith in the movie Matrix Pt One.. Human being is like a cancer, a virus.. Unlike other species that adapt to their surroundings, we in turn, use up whatever resources that is around us, suck it dry and move on to the next place..  I felt so utterly sad to hear those words but then again it is so true.. So much truth that it scares me, it angers me and saddens me that I am among one of them..  So I guess I should start recycling papers and stuff.. I wish so much that I can do more.. If you're there God, please do something.. I pray with all my heart so that in the future, those of my next generation may still be able to look up upon the sky and see what I saw today and appreciate that moment..

      Just finished watching this movie called Rashomon a moment ago.. Rather short movie.. Only about an hour and half.. Terry actually had this movie on the shelf for the longest time I can remember and only now I manage to watch it.. I came across this title while reading the consumer text book last month in this chapter called perception and since I'm bored out of my mind, I decided to just catch it..  Black and white settings, no hollywood gimmicks and it was done way back in the 1950's yet it's simply describes what we go through everyday of our lives.. perception..  No man sees the world the same.. The similar event can be discribed so differently by different people.. So which do we believe as truth? In some ways after watching it, it is so true yet so scary.. All these while the things that I have known might not be true either and the people I may have trusted may not be who they are..  But then again I can't generalize that every human being is the same.. I know I am truthful to myself and I lie when I have to, when it's truly necessary.. However if asked the truth, I will not be reluctant to voice it out..  The purpose of watching it was to gain an insight and a better understanding of perception.. I doubt many people actually do what I do but then again who knows.. The understanding of human nature is my interest, my obsession.. if there's anyone out there who wishes to share a perspective or have read what I written do voice out.. Thanks..  Anyway what show to watch next? Haven't pack my bag for tomorrow.. God, it's been so long since I have been over to Singapore.. I'm so anxious to see what has changed..   Saw a junior of mine just now when I brought mum to Giant to buy some food for supper.. haha.. I'm so greedy when I'm back home.. MOst of the time I haven't even finish dinner and I'd be thinking of supper.. Anyway I haven't seen her like in ages.. She's still as cute as ever..  Ugh.. had milk a moment ago and now i'm having stomak egg again.. again.. yes again.. that always happens to me.. I love milk yet I can't drink too much of it.. thank god coffee doesn't do that to me.. hahaha..  Gonna do some surfing.. Bored..

      As much as I like the idea of using Zorpia, I still like it here.. No one knows who I am and only you.. Here I am free to express what I feel at the moment without having to consider what I may say may offend others in turn.. Oh heck who da fuck cares..

      I don't know who started it anyway but heck keeping up with friendster is already quite tough..  However zorpia.com is rather interesting though... Well I guess I'm just practically bored out of my mind.. It's already 4:26 in the afternoon and it's getting scary.. Does anyone own a time machine?  It's weird how I don't feel tired whenever I'm back here even though I merely sleep for 6 hours a day.. I think I'm becoming like Jefferson.. HEck when I enter the world of advertising, it'll be worse..  I wish I am as strong as you sis, I really admire you and I can't imagine how you go through your life in Bayer.. But I guess what you go through there in Bayer is just a joke compared to what you really went through in life.. You are my angel and thank you so much for your support even though we meet each other once or twice a year..  So look forward to meeting you this coming Sat.. Which is tomorrow.. Hoorah.. I know you still love bro very much but heck somethings we just can't control..

      I am right and you are wrong, I wish so much I could write a song, This journey through life seems a bit long, But slowly in time I will gradually grow strong.  Everything at night seems so quiet, I doubt I can even go on a diet, Thank god for Peter no longer are there pirates, And policeman in my area so there are no riots.  Haha.. what crap I wrote.. but doesn't matt3r.. I like what I write.. I wish I could be a better poet but then I never really had much interest in that.. Writing is just a past time when there's utterly no one around I could talk to..

      About a year ago I embarked on this new course of study in the field of advertising. A whole new ball game compared to what I used to study which was Computer IT and Hotel Management..  The thing about the other two fields I chose to study is that the exposure it gave me was so fucking limited.. Advertising opened up my eyes to a whole new world about people and everything there is around me.. THe world is becoming such @ place where everything that surrounds me is now a product and now on the internet, I can practically find out about anything I'd ever want!   Fuck.. Only a couple year and so much change! What is the world becoming into? A mass marketing system? Everything is sold.. Anything I could imagine has a price on it.. People are becoming so materialistic and the pursuit of happiness is such through the purchase and ownership of products which they presume reflect who they are.. Products which are supposed to make an individual out of you.. Yes.. you..  In advertising there is such a saying which is ever so popular and at times, I feel sick even hearing it.. You can actually read about it in this text called Consumer Behavior by Schiffman and Kanuk under the chapter perception..  Perception it seems becomes reality.. What we perceive in times become a reality.. So instead of the pursuit of truth, we believe what we see.. This is so utterly sad.. It simply means judge the book by the cover.. People nowadays no longer care so much about things that have quality but instead products that they buy simply need only to capture their attention and if the product projects a status for them, then it simply is good..  I guess I'm just old school.. Things need to have a certain amount of quality before I actually purchase it.. But without doubt I am slowly changing to become one of the 21st century consumers.. It's scary really when I actually know so much truth about things.. I can't be ignorant either and ironically all my life I have been attracted to advertising.. Now I'm studying it and in the near future it'll become my job..   Um.. well maybe not advertising but still I'll be helping those marketers to create graphics which eventually is used to capture the minds of consumers(you people out there)..  Well anyway one more year to go.. Can't wait for the internship.. Still haven't decide which company to join yet.. I need exposure but I sure could use the reputation too.. *Sigh* I hate it when I come across a crossroad.. Deciding which way to has always been a dilemma.. But then again I need not think about that now.. Time will come when I have to choose.. I just hope I choose the right path..  Come to think of it.. Might as well check out about the companies while I'm online.. Leo Burnett I think is one of the places I'd want to be or maybe O & M..  Cheerio..

      Finally the weekend is coming.. I'm so looking forward to go to sg.. God it's already Friday.. How time fly.. But this is so far the best holiday I have had so far.. My mind seem so clear this time except for what bro said to me yesterday..  These couple days time seem to really fly.. A moment ago it was only 12 and now, it's 3:45 in the morning.. A minute ago it was Sat and now it's Fri.. I wanted to watch this movie called Rashomon but ended up watching anime called the Crying Freeman..  Just had coffee.. Didn't seem to be enough..  Checking out Red Hot Chili Peppers' webby.. They should have some a section for dwnlds.. I would have loved it.. I wish so much I could go to their concert.. I have the DVD where they played live in Slane.. God the crowd was super but I doubt they'd ever come here.. This country is just too conservative..  Well so far listening to their songs is the closes I can ever get to being a RHCP fan.. Can't wait for work to start.. I will definately get all their albums.. I'll search every nook and cranny for em.. So many things I'm crazy bout.. Just need sometime and money..  Oh ya.. they also should have an album where they have the songs from their concerts.. There's this song by John Frusciante that is so utterly cool and his lead playing is fantastic..  I can't imagine I actually heard this friend of mine say that RHCP suck.. This is one band that has gone through test of time and if Kurt Cobain didn't kill himself, Nirvana would probably still be around too.. But then again he's just a moron.. There is plenty of em in college.. People who think that they know so much or so much better than others.. Stop being a critic!!  So far two posters, two albums and a DVD concert.. This is so sad.. I wonder if I could find their shirt somewhere.. Red Hot Rulez!

      We have so little time yet we do not use it to the fullest.. I had this sudden urge to learn more about what there is out there and the only thing stopping me from learning is time.. Why do we have to sleep? Oh ya.. According the the Psychology textbook by Plotnik.. Sleep is necessary for growth and repair.. Hey I did learn something!! Hahaha..  There are different stages of sleep which is stage 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, REM (Rapid Eye Movement). God I can still remember.. hahaha.. Well a person needs an average of 6-8 hours a day of sleep. Which I try to and which in the REM stage of the sleep, we dream.. Dreaming.. haha.. That's another chapter of the text.. Supposingly there are multiple theories about dreams but heck I'm not giving lecture here am I?  Anyway back to time.. Time waits for no one.. Use it wisely I guess.. That's what I can do.. Hmm.. what's that song again?  Oh.. time of our lives.. Green Day.. Any of you out there who knows how to play this? Enjoy..

      It's like 10:17 in the morning right now and I still haven't slept.. I know you told me to K, but I just don't want to shut my eyes.. If I did I don't wish that they would open again.. I have never done what you did before.. Maybe I'm just too chicken to do it but I guess I still have a purpose here.. What the hell is it I don't know.. Wish that dude up there would tell me earlier or leave a note or something coz life is getting frustrating..  For almost 6 days now I've been hearing my granny shouting every morning.. SHe's got stroke and she practically doesn't recognize what's what anymore.. But her shouting and screaming is just making my day worse.. I feel that I'm losing it too.. I wake each day as if a conflict goes inside of me.. One minute I'd get really flared up but the next I try to calm myself down.. It's never ending and it's so tiring.. Insanity I guess but sometimes I think I am getting stronger which ultimately means I am becoming colder..  Nothing seems to matter these days.. Very few things excite me.. Either that or when it does, someone just have to take the bucket of water fill it with lots of ice and pour it over my head.. As if happiness is something I should never have..  Maybe I shouldn't think.. I need some coffee.. I need a ciggy.. I need to chill.. SO tired..

      Corithians:  Love is patience and kind; it is not jealous or conceited or proud; love is not i'll mannered or selfish or irritable; love does not keep record of wrong; love is not happy with evil but is happy with truth. Love never gives up; and it's faith, hope and patience never fails.  Can't remember where I got this but it made sense a little. Can't seem to find that kind of love though..  Love to me is like what most people say, Love is like clapping hands.. You need both of it to make a sound..  Been so long since I have fallen in love.. I can hardly remember what it felt like anymore.. These days it feels as if a distant dream.. One that I will never reach..  Patience people tell me.. I seem to run low on it.. Tired is what best describe the feeling that I go through each day waiting for this so called love to happen..  Cupid it seems lost his faith in me.. or maybe i'm losing faith in him..

      Can't seem to sleep these days.. Maybe it's because I choose to.. Hate waking up in the day.. Hate the crowd and the crap I have to go through each day.. Everyone else seems to have a choice except me.. I stood outside there for a moment lighting up a ciggy which didn't seem to help either.. The silence of the night did a little.. Everything seems so clear when it's quiet..  I don't know why I chose the city life.. Everything seems so fast paced and I can hardly keep up to it.. Everyone seems to be rushing here and there.. What's the rush anyway?  I feel so alone at times.. but I guess everyone else feels the same way too.. Feel like I'm losing it at times but in the end I never seem to.. I just keep on moving.. Trying not to think about it.. Doing what I have to do instead of what I want 2..  So tired.. Wish someone could explain to me what's the point of it all.. Some would tell me to stick to being who I am and some would say that change is good.. I don't know.. Don't know what to think.. I just try to focus on something each day.. Tried hard to find an obsession and the newest obsession that I have is climbing..  When I climb I seem not to be bothered about anything else except to reach the top which I eventually do.. Then I am happy for that short moment of time..  Wish so much that I could have a camera and the ability to go travel around the world.. I hate staying in one place for too long.. At first I would love it and if I linger on in time I would eventually come to hate it.. The camera is the only thing that can capture what I truly see, a view of the world that no one else could understand..  exeunt

      Little bit bout me b4 we go on further.. What you read is what you get.. I'm just the way I am and I don't give a r@t's ass if anyone likes it or not.. Am I psychotic? You decide.. I'm just another soul trying to get through this surreal world seeking for solace, solitude & nirvana..  At times I can be so optimistic and yet at times I am the obversed.. It's just life.. Ups and downs.. The more we try to control it, the more we lose control.. Yin & Yang..  Cheerio..

      Reality is an illusion caused by the lack of alcohol.. Some great dude wrote this and it's so true.. What's reality really? It's just a perception.. I see things different, you see things different and why do people get so worked up over it? Fucking babies.. I guess if the world is just too perfect, then it'd be boring I guess so everyday we have to go through this crap.. Now ain't that the truth?

      Muahahahaha...*Evil laugh w/ sinister grin*  Well thank god it's over.. The last couple weeks since the Ad renaline Awards started has been nothing but brainstorming.. For a moment there I thought I was gonna lose my mind.. Finally everything is set and an hour ago, the final work was printed and sent for evaluation. I don't really care if I can win or not but I just want to try.. Kancil Award last year was such a disappointment but this year I have improved a little so I hope the ads get chosen..  So many things to do this sem and there's hardly time to reflect on what I have done.. Sometimes running away seems to be the appropriate thing to do but we all know where it all leads..  Not thinking about it doesn't help either.. Ironic the way life is..  Can't wait to go climbing tomorrow.. Climb climb climb.. It's my life now.. It builts me up.. physically and mentally..  Sigh.. Gotta go again.. I have to give Telekom a call soon.. Hate coming here..

      If you were wondering what's the matter with the pics of children, well it's for a project that targets you.. the people of the free world.. to donate money to the orphanage..   I'm currently trying so hard to find pictures to use as an advertisement.. Bloody damn competition's in a weeks' time.. Have to go climb tomorrow.. So stressed out..   urlLink children   urlLink children1   urlLink children2  children3  Holy crap.. being creative isn't easy.. Being a perfectionist makes it worse.. You'd never feel satisfied with the work that you have and yet you do not have enough time to do a better job.. In time I hope I gradually get better at this.. I so gotta climb tomorrow.. Couldn't even sleep last night and ended up redecorating my whole room until morning and grabbed some breakfast before I fell into a deep slumber..  Thank you Rae for helping me out.. Sigh.. not many people that I can depend on these days..   I haven't spoken to Kel in a long time.. The last I hear she's doing fine.. I hope you are, pray that you are..  Got an unexpected call a couple days ago.. I was so surprised that she called me.. Hmm.. people do remember me.. *smile*  Linkin, crap.. super lost.. Lost in Malaysia.. haha.. Wormies.. Lost in other friends.. Don.. Lost in job.. Jefferson.. Lost in home.. Jason.. Lost in Sarawak.. Hsang.. Lost in BU.. Jeffrey.. Lost in with Adel.. Gerald.. Lost in weedland.. Celeste.. Busy like hell.. Chong.. we meet twice a week.. climbing yeah!! Lemme tell you bout this guy.. One down to earth person and I love hanging out with him.. Very good at climbing and practically knows everyone there is at the gym! I hope you stick with this sport my friend.. I hope we be friends for life.. U too Celeste.. Sometimes, we all need a dose of obsession.. whether it's with women, friends, job, home, weed or climbing(like me)..

      Got a offer yesterday to work at the climbing gym.. Very much doubt that I will work there.. I love the sport and weekend is the only time I get to climb with Chong and Celeste.. Went there 3 days in a row.. I know I'm nuts but it's better than staying at home and being a couch potato.. Not very enthusiastic about going out with Lincoln or Don either.. Always mamak and makan.. If I am every crazy about food, well the only time would be after climbing..  The 3 of us was so hungry last Sat night that we couldn't stop eating.. No one spoke a word! Jefferson came along too that day.. I guess staying over night at his place worked.. haha.. that lazy bum..  Have yet to catch up with the other guys.. So many people to catch up with.. That's what I hate about having too many friends.. No money and no time!! Money is now reserved for internet and climbing which leaves me with very little left..  Tomorrow the phone will be set up in the morning and hopefully by the end of the week I will be able to get access.. Sigh.. I know.. I said I won't come back here to this dreadful place but where else can I go? Just hate to go to CC these dayz...  Thanks for Jeffrey's help or else I wouldn't have been able to get the line fixed up.. Thinking back, I just can't believe that it's been 4 years since I have known him.. Great guy.. friends for life..  Still trying to get him to go climbing but in time I guess he will.. He's so restricted by his job and there's so little time left after that..  Hoping this coming Sun I will have work to do.. Cyndi have yet to let me know but a little extra money won't hurt either.. The following month most probably will be helping out at the AXN sports event.. Need to get out more.. See the world a bit.. live a bit..  Sigh.. No mood to write here.. exeunt..

      Finally after two weeks I am now able to check my mail.. Was going to get the internet fixed up today but then I have yet to get my phone installed and everything.. Will probably get it done by Friday if I have time..  Results are out.. 2 B's and C's.. Predictable..  Can't say that I'm really pleased with it but then I can't complain either..  Classes started last week.. Nothing much.. YET!! *sigh* My mind keeps drifting off each time i enter class.. Just want to get it over with and get out.. All I can think of is climbing.. Been about 4 times since I came back.. Supposed to go today if Li Mei is up to it.. Well depends if she has transportation.. I'm so tired of driving there..  Caught up with Don and Swee Pheng yesterday.. Supposed to play badminton too but probably do that on Fri.. Jefferson has decided to go back into climbing.. Hoorah!! Another person to call when there's no one else climbing..  Each passing day I'd wake up feeling that somethings are just not the same.. Things are gradually falling into place ever since I decided to do something about it..  This whole new passion towards climbing, it's just crazy but I like it.. It's been so long since I have been so engrossed in anything.. It's as if life has found it's juice, the supplements required to go on.. I am very eager and looking forward towards getting the internet set up.. There's so much I want to know about climbing and though knowledge doesn't really add up to experience, the need to know is just too overwhelming..   Was talking to Celeste the other night about it.. I call climbing "ballet" in the air.. The thing about climbing that attracts me I guess is the personal challenge that I set for myself each time I go there.. Though it may not be the real thing, it is the training ground for improvement.. The gracefulness of the sport is another factor that attracts me.. However the only thing I hate about it is that you need at least 2 people to do it.. Not going for bouldering at the moment, at least not until I get my strenght up.. It was fun that day watching them gather together and boulder.. Zues asked me to join but in time..  Them new shoes I bought from Singapore are working just fine but I got them a little to large.. THe thing about climbing shoes is that you need it to fit very well to your feet so that it doesn't move when you step on the rocks.. I realized that while trying to do the "orange" route that Celeste was trying so desperately to conquer.. When I got up there my foot just didn't hold and the most agonizing thing about it was that I was about to reach the top..  Went to MPH the other day to check out some books on climbing too but it was way too expensive to get them.. 90 bucks each!! Motherf**k!!  Don't know what's been going on with Lincoln.. Haven't seen him since he picked me up from Pudu.. Don's really pissed with his girl.. I don't want to know.. *sigh*  Didn't go back for Su Hui's wedding either.. I think mum must have gotten some present for her.. So many things to decide.. Hope I'm jus doing it right..  Time to go.. stupid library b**ch.. She keeps walking up and down the room as if I owe her money or something.. GOd damn internet's free you moron!!  Anyway this is the last time I am coming here to check.. Getting the net set up by next week.. Adios..

It's only 3 I know but it's valuable to me!   My cycling improved though I still feel outta breath.. in 47 mins I am able to travel 15 km and it's an improvement.. Lack of H2o us making the trips short..   More speed, less time..

I can just collapse in 5 secs.. But why am I still up? COz I have work to do.. THere's always work to do.. Sigh.. Lol.. Managed to get em pedals fixed today.. Can't ride safely with them clips.. I wish I could get the shoes but that will have to wait.. It's only 3 km to TTDI but with the climbing I did today and the lack of proper rest, the ride was tiring!&nbsp;Going Bangsar on Thur morning.. It'll be the perfect time to ride.. The air is cool and fresh.. As much as&nbsp;I would like to give up the night life of mine, it seems I still can't stand the noisy day time that goes on here day by day..   Lincoln wanted to talk this afternoon but so sorry dude.. It's not that I don't want to but I'm really tired.. Tired of seeing you this way.. Wake up man.. Not 18 anymore.. Life's responsibilities are almost impossible to run from..   Sigh I'm hungry again.. AGAIN!! sobs..&nbsp; Better cook some maggi and shut my stomach up or should I head for SS2 and grab some paos.. again.. haha.. I just love hot paos and tim sum.. woo.. shit.. I'm really hungry now..

(Thanks to you Jennette.. *hugs*) It has everything I want except the forks need changing.. It can go up to 49.5 km/h.. which I rode the other day and I have so far gotten the necessary parts for it.. God I'm so motivated..   Oh one more thing..&nbsp;for those of you wondering if my bike's in my room? Well hell yea.. I've always wanted to&nbsp;do this and now I'm doing it.. ahhaha.. I just love the freedom of staying alone.. Rulez anyone? You actually see the world in a broader&nbsp;view..   I wonder if there's anyway I can hang it up easily.. hehe..

      Bike Type : Road/Pavement Total time : 1.26.48 Average Speed : 19.0 km/h Max Speed :&nbsp;49.5 km/h *New Record* Distance Travelled :&nbsp;27.52 km Total Distance Travelled :&nbsp;76.4 km No of rides : Two (Morning and Evening)  Two sessions today.. It's really becoming a religion to me.. cycling.. I guess I was born this way for a reason.. First to climb and second to ride.. Hit a new record with my max speed.. Went down from Tmn Megah and accelerated while going down and I was like wow when I saw the meter going up til 49.5 km/h.. I can't imagine the speed of those riders when they ride Le Tour De France.. Now I know why people keep saying Lance Armstrong.. Trying to increase the average speed too but I seriously have to quit smoking.. I'm really serious.. I want to be able to ride like them.. Not to compete but to see if I am capable and the good thing about this goal is, it'll never end.. If I hit 50 km/h the next day, I'll aim higher.. THta's the only way to go through life I think.. Everything else bores me.. I just want to finish college so that I can get a job and get some money so I can do more of this.. I love this bike and I can't wait til the real money comes in.. A road, A MTB and&nbsp;a cruiser.. I think one of em  urlLink Schwinn Stingrays .. but I think by the time I manage to get em they'd be outta stock.. Hehe..  Really going to save up money the next couple months.. I want to change to them carbon forks.. I have never seen em or experience a ride on a really light bike.. But I won't overspend or overbudget this time *wink*.. Love what you do..  Oh oh.. B4 I end this blog I have something to share.. I learn from my friend.. (who I can't say) that everything in life can be the way it is but one must live with at least one obsession.. One which should never die despite it being good or bad.. (the choice is yours to have good or bad obsession).

       urlLink    Used to be my fav.. It enables me to be someone else for a while and most important of all it lets me have control.. THat's what we all want.. no? Control.. or some times losing control.. Anyway I miss it now since I sold it.. Haha.. Will get you back in my life one day.. Flat panel LCD screen, surround speakers and a whole lot of stuff.. The graphics for the Sony PS2 isn't better than X box but you know why we buy em here? Coz there's tons of pirated DVD games... I hear you Kel.. I support pirated stuff too.. hahaha.. For those of you out there that don't agree, well screw you.. You can't imagine the price for a single DVD here.. You could buy hundreds of pirated games.. and for a 3 year gamer I know it's frustrating to be stuck at just one game... what if you can't get through the level? am i just supposed to have no choice?

I hardly keep track of those I know.. Only a few.. Well that's the way it is when you get out of college and start working.. People become less and less.. Well I'm not working yet so I admit to my fault.. I'm just plain lazy.. HAte to think of something to say all the time.. Only a few I really click and few comfortable with..

We have our own directions and often it contradicts.. She's currently working at Shangrila Hotel at the Jap kitchen.. I think.. Haha.. Haven't heard from her for a long time and each time out of the blue she'd msg me and then we'd plan to meet up but which in the end we usually don't.. People seem to think that I am hung up with the past but I'm not.. We move on and I am just glad that we can still be friends.. This pic was taken in my hometown at Tanjung Piai.. For those dodos out there.. It's the southern most tip of  Peninsular Malaysia.. Yea and I live there.. The sea isn't great but heck it's better than none...

Who's punctual? No one is.. That's the culture.. Always be late or you're not M'sian.. And another stupid thing to point out is the fact that it only goes one way.. So if you head to SS2, you can take the bus but if you go home, you'd have to walk.. $@#$$#%#^!!! So sorry for the indecent languages.. It brings back so much memory and reminds me of how much time I wasted just to get to Bangsar to work..&nbsp; urlLink

      Took a nap last night and ended up waking up at 4 in the morning.. Finished watching the movie "Sanjuro". A japanese classic that resembles Rashomon. Well heck, the director's the same guy.. of course the concept is similar.. I personally think that Akira Kurosawa has a unique way of portraying his movie and what he wants the audience to see.. The two movie I have seen so far clearly defines the perspective which he sees the world through.. Interesting study..  Anywayz I just got back from a ride and now to keep track..  Bike Type : Road/Pavement Total time : 0.24.07 Average Speed : 20.5 km/h Max Speed : 43 km/h Distance Travelled : 8.29 km Total Distance Travelled : 36.1 km Time : 7 a.m.  Not that I have reduced the duration but rather a shorter ride with constant pedalling.. Going uphill is still a challenge but then I can take it a lot better than b4.. Average speed has also increased due to the fact that I'm riding alone.. Waiting for others can really slow you down and also yesterday the time of the ride was around high traffic hours.. I'm planning to make this more constant in the morning due to less traffic polution.. By the following week, my performance would greatly increase, that's if I can push myself to quit ciggy..  Almost 8 now and Jeffrey has yet to call.. Going hiking after this and prob grab some breakfast right after that.. Hmm.. thinking of grabbing some paos or tim sum.. No nasi lemak today.. sigh.. Still pending the thought of going to Summit and climb but then again I should finish my work and study for IMC test for the coming Wed.. I just love doing things without rulez but when it comes to those that do, sigh.. I think most prob I will skip climbing for the next two weeks.. Prob Tue I might if Ellaine is free to go..  Anyway hungry and a little tired.. You can't imagine how I wish I could take up the ciggy now and light em.. F#$!%$^%*$^$#%^#*%&K~~~!!!! But I know if I do that, all the effort just now would go down the drain and later if we do go hike, the climb will be a killer.. Sigh.. Breath.. breath.. breath.. hahahaha..  A full day ahead and seize da day!

      Today is the first official day of biking.. Now don't say that I have nothing better to do but to keep track of silly things.. But then silly things don't seem so silly when you put in effort and get to improve yourself.. Had this wonderous plan to go hiking in the morning but ended up in bed since it rained real heavy.. Then out of the blue.. Jeffrey called and said he's going.. Fark.. so sorry dude.. I was half way through the rabbit hole.. So instead I ended up waking up later in the day finding Lincoln walking in through my door.. He had a terrible accident but then again he's alright.. The way this guy drives his car? Well I think the tyres need changing every year!  Went yam cha went Don came and headed to Tmn Sentosa, Old Klang Rd.. Wanted to get my spokes done too but there were too many people at the bike shop.. Gonna go back there on Mon maybe..  Then out of the blue Don decided that he wants to bike.. So ok.. We went round Tmn Mayang, down to DJ primary school and then to my place.. After all the sweating, swearing, and suffering, we ended up at Jef's shop.. And there goes the two of em chatting of since Don just got his N-gage QD and Jef has tons of songs and softwares.. I'm interested in the phone too but I don't really need that.. I got myself a watch too for 35 bucks.. Analog by Quartz and I'm satisfied.. I have been needing a watch for the longest time but I no longer want to go back to the high tech gizmos.. I just need it to tell time..  Finally now I am back home and I'm so freaking sleepy.. Need to take bath and wake up a little and start doing some more work.. Tomorrow morning should be a fine day to go for the walk.. Depending on Jef..  Ok.. now to officially keep track of my progress and head for the showers..  Bike Type : Road/Pavement Total Time : 1.09.48 (1 hour, 9 mins and 48 sec) Average Speed : 17.3 km/h Max Speed : 44.5 km/h (Downhill from Tmn Megah to DJ) Distance Travelled : 20.17 km Total Distance Travelled : 27.8 km Time : 6.30 pm onwards  Seize the day!  &nbsp;

HAve yet to figure out what to press.. But now I can keep track of my progress.. Sometimes salesman can be so annoying.. THey presume you don't know shit and try to ask you to buy more.. So sorry dude.. I'm just getting the necessary stuff..&nbsp; I know 90 percent of the biking stuff and I can do most of it myself.. I hate to be in the dark when it comes to these things.. People are always trying to rip off..   Brb.. Getting food..  Back..   Gone for a 5 min ride..  Ave speed of 17.6 km/h..  Max Speed of 35.5 km/h..&nbsp;  Distance of 1.62 km..  Total of 7.6km overall..   I love this thing.. I think I can go faster on highway.. but I have to make sure the road is safe and the best time to do it is early in the morning.. Crap it's raining now.. There goes my hiking and biking.. Now I just have to readjust my time and start a different routine.. Need to wake up early since it's the best time to bike.. THere's not a single car on the road at 5 or 6&nbsp;in the morning.. Well there are some but better than having to ride in the middle of the afternoon or worse.. after 4 pm..   Gotta finish work tomorrow.. Want to climb on Sun..  It's raining now.. woo.. super cold.. great night.. It feels like typhoon is coming.. Damn.. But the feeling is great..&nbsp; Brrr.. Good time to sleep.. Better off this soon.. Won't want to spend more money on Modems.. haha..

       urlLink    Really like the way they design the back of this bike though.. I just added a bit of life to it.. That's all.. And yes I'm still on L so that Gerald can't ask me to bring him out.. Damn dangerous for those of you who know what I mean.. Sadly the engine is small and so is everything else so it can't really go fast.. But it beats having to walk, anytime.. Haha.. Took it for servicing last month and changed the from suspension.. Cost me 150.. I love the number though.. Read it in chinese..&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    My Spawn which lost it's cape because Jason and gang borrowed it to make butter sculputure and in the process broke it.. Well I don't really care.. I saw their work it was great.. Imagine an enlarged version of Spawn but made of butter!! Way cool.. Would have been even better if Lincoln had done his part creating the cape.. but then he's a bum.. Work harder dude.. Stop making excuses..&nbsp; urlLink

      Sigh.. I need to smack myself in the face real hard.. I can understand why Don wants to stop from Customer Service.. People.. can be the hardest being you could ever work with.. Selfish, self centered and super troublesome.. People tend to perceive things and not find out the truth of it all.. They believe what is thrown in front of them..   But then again Don, life isn't always about the money.. You could live for something else.. for someone.. You have her and she worries for you each time you go into this phase.. You hardly talk to me and I don't know what you are thinking half the time..&nbsp;But I hope that msg I sent you yesterday did make some sense and I hope it's why you are still on the job..  Yes it's tiring to be acting all the time, everyday of your life with people you don't know or don't care but it's our job.. like the Sun that shines down on the icebergs hoping to melt em down but it just can't seem to be able to do it.. Instead it focuses it's use on the other tropical countries down in the middle.. The Sun is there for a reason like we are here for a reason..  Even now as I am sitting here.. I feel like running away.. Go somewhere else where no one can bother me.. but I know I can't..&nbsp; I need to search for myself and get back up again.. Feel I want to go home next weekend.. I miss home.. Have to start studying too.. So many things to do I feel like exploding.. even these few days cycling seems to be sucky.. my body feels tired and I can't quit from ciggy.. I need to go home.. I know I have to.. And when I get back.. I'm gonna quit for good.. FUUUUUUUUUck!  Could someone please spare a 9mm? Need to shoot myself..  &nbsp;

      For those of you who don't know what Cateye is, well it's a flash light.. Wanted to look for the model HL-EL200 but they&nbsp;didn't have it.. So instead I bought the  urlLink HL-EL120  for 68 bucks.. Now I can go cycle in the dark.. cool.. &nbsp; I have my Topeak at the back and a Cateye up front.. Now I feel safer.. The helmet will have to wait for Ellaine to get for me.. SHe says that she can get it for 100 to 150.. Mett.. &nbsp; Now I'm eyeing for a  urlLink Velo 5  cycle computer.. These are the essential things I need for now.. Asking bout the fork was hillarious.. The cheapest they have are carbon forks which cost 350 bucks.. You must be kidding me man.. 350 fork on a Colnago bike? Way too much.. &nbsp; With the light to ride at night and the computer to measure my performance, all I have to do is to start waking up early to cycle.. Mornings can get really really cold but none the less the best time to cycle.. &nbsp; Went for a walk today at Tmn Tun with Jef* and Adel.. To my surprise I was able to walk.. The first time we went it was hell.. I was so tired and my legs couldn't take it.. I just want to gradually gain my strength and go on improving.. &nbsp; Went to Jefferson's earlier on.. He asked me to go house sit for him tomorrow since he is asking some Indian guy to plant grass for him.. Most prob riding there but I'm so afraid of the tyres going.. This is a very sensitive bike.. and I'm so broke now I can't even afford to get new ones.. Can't wait for next month to come.. I'm gonna get that computer and start keeping track of the distance I have travelled.. &nbsp; Feel like going for a ride right now.. Prob I will.. So sick of this place sometimes.. Can't I run? What choice? Choice.. I'm beginning to hate that word.. Feel so much like going somewhere where I can be alone for a while.. No disturbance and no stupid morons saying stupid things.. &nbsp; *Sigh* or better yet, maybe I should just go sleep.. Sleep and not think at all.. Good idea..

      Bro called me earlier.. He's up here til Tue for work.. He was at Murni SS2 with some work colleagues.. It felt good to see him.. Getting fat.. Rode there with my bike.. I am changing so much and I really want it to happen.. I'll quit ciggy if I have to.. I'm so sick of my life here for the past 3 years.. Wasting my time.. Getting&nbsp;high and realizing that time I can't turn back and that the future is catching up.. &nbsp; I'm trying hard not to procrastinate but I'm so easily distracted.. I wish I am staying somewhere else.. But I really just have to hang on for another year or so and I'll be out of this house.. Need to lock myself up for the next couple weeks and start doing what I have been neglecting.. Some things in life are meant to be given up no matter how much we like it.. It's just not meant to be.. *sigh* But then again being too realistic about life can be very boring too.. Humans are meant to break boundaries.. To do what we want than what we have to.. Read some comics earlier on at  urlLink www.ucomics.com  bout Calvin and Hobbes and it reminded me so much of when I was  urlLink young .. But then again I didn't have choice to go anywhere.. The furthest journey I can make would depend solely on my legs and my bike.. &nbsp; Feel stinky.. Gotta take a bath soon b4 I sleep.. So cold.. *Brrr*.. Gotta do Penny's work later after this.. *sigh*... Take action, stop thinking or talking about it.. damnit! Hope mum'll send me money tomorrow.. So broke.. Might go climb after that.. Take my mind of the stress but then again who can climb tomorrow? *argh*.. &nbsp; Ellaine is wrong.. I do have my moods.. Though I often try to hide it, it doesn't mean that it isn't there.. But each time I do, it seems I can't.. Getting angry is something other people besides me get to do.. Don't feel like sleeping at all.. But will get tired really fast tomorrow.. The usual 8 to 12 time slot just doesn't suit me.. Need to have time to reflect on what I have done.. The night is the best time of all.. It's so hot and noisy during the day.. &nbsp; Been online for two days now.. Suprisingly it didn't rain today.. Went to Jef's shop to eat earlier on.. Adel came after that.. My tyres must have hit something.. When I was about to leave I realize that they were flat.. Wasted the new tubes.. Now I don't have spare..  &nbsp; Feel like cutting my hair.. Been so long now.. Getting sick of it..  Don't know what's wrong.. Heck don't even feel like blogging.. sleep..

      Long day.. Woke up late and ended up riding to Jefferson's.. It was tiring but satisfying.. Had to know where I stand.. Need a months training but that's if i can be consistent and quit smoking.. But no ciggy can be torturing.. sigh.. &nbsp; Met up with Don and gf at night at Tmn Mayang behind where the old LUCT was.. Rode again but not going to anymore at night.. Bad for the rims since I don't have lights up front.. Might get em soon but I'm so broke this month and the next.. &nbsp; Need to get rid of the tv too so that I can get a new monitor.. and DVD ROM.. crap.. im so broke.. Need helmet too.. Need new forks.. Need new shirts and pants.. Need so many things.. Need to rob the bank.. hahaha... &nbsp; Gerald washing his car again.. Nutter.. Never seen anyone was car so many times.. hahaha.. But then again he has nothing better to do.. &nbsp; Gotta finish IMC tonight.. Going to climb tomorrow.. I mean later.. So many things to do.. so little time.. argh..&nbsp;You're right El shouldn't procrastinate but i feel sometimes i lack will power.. but seeing you guys doing what u do i feel energized.. &nbsp; Will ride to Bangsar one day.. Just need sometime..

Met Ashley and El.. Had dinner with them afterwards.. Chong went to meet up with the rest of the guys.. Did some 6B routes.. Were they really 6B? Didn't feel like it.. But it was good to climb again..     &nbsp;   Need to do so many things tomorrow.. Gotta wake up for biking, have breakfast and do some laundry.. Gotta start doing assignments too.. Finish the bottle design for IMC and work on Cross Cultural journal.. Prob go for biking at night.. But it's been raining a lot lately..     &nbsp;   Glad I took the initiative to go out today.. Felt so tired when I woke up.. Serviced the bike the whole afternoon.. Getting a hang of adjusting the gears but still sometimes I feel that the parts are not compatible.. there's so many possibilities..&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Climb again on Sun.. but will be going much earlier.. I wonder if I can hit 20 routes.. Need to do proper stretching..     &nbsp;   Downloaded a couple songs I heard on radio.. Never heard of the band but the songs are pretty good.. "Everybody's Changing" by Keane, Look What You've Done by Jet.. Currently listening to some radio channel from UK.. Hear them reporting bout traffic conditions all the time... hehe.. Eh.. this is Malaysia!     &nbsp;   Went out to 7 Eleven a while ago and took the bike out.. Felt different after I changed the tyres and serviced the gears.. Having this bike makes me feel like I'm a kid again.. But a whole new experience since I have never had a roadbike..   The speed is excellent though the whole bike is sensitive to little pot holes and even little bumps..&nbsp;Changing the gears was really hard too at first and my back is killing me.. The whole bike is prob 7 to 8kg and it's so fragile yet it's some how tough..     &nbsp;   I hope it doesn't rain in the morning..    Ashley and Ellaine is planning to cycle to Port Dickson.. They are really enthusiastic.. Need to be more motivated..     &nbsp;   Time to sleep.. Catching sheeps..     &nbsp;    &nbsp;

      Another day.. Got an invite to the awards.. I had a feeling that we're the audience and I was rite.. Followed Theo.. Met him up at Bangsar and went on to pick up Chin Hooi and his gf..  Met worm, ww, annie and eliza at Time Square and oh Adrian, G and Calvin. Saw my entries posted up.. Annie took pics for me..  After the presentation and announcing the crappy winners, we went Jln Ah Lor to eat.. damn nice fried rice and chicken wings..  Theo offered to work as a team for Kancil Awards.. I know you want to work with me for quite sometime dude but am I that good? I'm inconsistent that's what I'd say.. I procrastinate without reasons or simply coz i think too much.. It's when I need time out to reflect on what I am doing.. ww wants to work with me too.. crap.. I hate to stand in the middle and have to make a choice.. Dun feel like joining at all.. Stupid topic anyway.. golf.. fuck.. for goodness sake.. nothing else more interesting?  Need to research on golf and so much work already hanging by.. Went for a ride after getting back.. Felt better.. Tomorrow's another day and have to fix the motorbike.. crap.. there goes my money and i thought of getting locks for the roadbike.. gotta start cycling to col..  Cycling just brings back memories.. Lost bike round 5 years back.. Miss it so much but then again it wasnt a good one.. This is my first road bike and it's scary to even ride it slow.. it's so light and the cornering is diff.. the first time I took it for a ride I pressed the brakes too much and the tyres went skidding.. Jeff* keeps asking me to reduce the price but heck dude you dont know how much it's gonna cost to get a bike with so much mods..  The mods aren't really really good but then it's better than using the ori's.. Took a look at Cinelli's roadbike stems  urlLink SOLIDO  i think they cost a bomb since it's only 125g..  I really like the triathlon handlebars..  urlLink Chrono-Triathlon ANGEL  The carbon fiber seat posts are to die for  urlLink RAM reggisella ..  Sigh so many nice parts but no money to change em.. But slowly I will.. I want sport rims attached to the bikes too.. Blardy hell I will.. I realized that many roadbikes are Italian made.. Cornelli, Colnago, Le Mond and etc.. Are Italians crazy or something? However the bikes they make are of high performance.. Love to watch em race during Olympics and see em race indoors.. those concept bikes are just fantastic.. They are the Ferraris to me..  I never knew there were so many bike brands.. Im so anxious to find out about em but hardly have time.. Well patience is a virtue.. Do I have any choice also? hehe..

      The worst thing could ever happen b4 a comp is to feel sick.. not to be physically sick but mentally tired.. Having to wake up 7 in the morning didn't help either.. I realized the importance of training and getting good rest before comp.. Being nervous there and then didn't help much either.. but seeing EL felt good.. She's just seems to brighten up everything wherever she goes..  Completed 4 out of 5 routes but this is unofficial.. I could have finished the 4th route but I thought that the second hold was the last so I didn't touch it.. I think most people would think that I am exaggerating but I'm not.. I could reach it and I should be in the finals.. I was pretty angry at myself for not paying careful attention to the routes but then again now I can't be bothered.. EL being there was good enough and seeing so many people climbing was good.. Bryant did pretty bad.. I think partly due to his hand injury..  Half way home my engine just died and I had no choice but to stop at the road side.. Making the silly mistake already pissed me off at that time and I thought the rest of the day is also screwed as well.. Thank god I had a little bit of water in my SIGG bottle and I poured the rest of it onto the engine.. I thought it might help and I guess it did.. The engine is much too old to go to fast I guess..  The only good thing that did happen today was the bicycle shop that I found at Tmn Megah. It's like the only shop open among so many others and I got myself a portable pump that cost 49 and another spare tube for 11.. When I came back I tested the tyres and found that they are working fine.. now I have two spare tube.. one Panaracer and the other some local rubber tube..  Went for a ride after sleeping through the day and finally now I am home.. The ride was a killer.. My stamina is crap.. hahaha.. Anyway now I feel much better.. Just need to touch up the bike a little.. take out all the parts and service them.. I need WD40 but I don't even have money to buy em.. haha.. Called mum and asked her to send me money and she sounded real pissed.. I know I over spent this month but cheap road bikes are hard to find and getting it just means less ciggy.. I need to quit this crap..  Next month another 300 to go and I can start with the necessary mods for the bike.. I can't wait... EL wants to get a road bike too.. Prob recommend the bike at Theo's house.. I wonder if they know each other.. That bike is much cheaper too.. It's only 400 but prob need some recon..  Had a talk with Celeste earlier on.. I get what she meant to say but heck it's really been too long.. I just can't remember what it felt like anymore..  EL came online earlier on.. Will prob meet her up on Fri.. but DJ to Bangsar? wooah.. then to Summit? I'm so dead.. Should wake up early the next few days to ride.. My legs can't take it either.. Been too long.. But heck for tuna sandwich.. it's worth it..  Gotta go write about Monsoon Wedding.. Crap Penny's class early morn tomorrow.. 9!! Stupid journal..

      Everything seems to be falling into place.. Everything except my expenses 8 p. Anyway I don't want to think about that.. Later is the comp.. Sigh..  I'm happy to have seen you Kel, it's been a while but you look great to me.. I wish the both of you would fight a little less but then again which relationship doesn't have quarrels?  I'm trying hard to figure out where I'm heading but heck sometimes I still feel so lost. Picking up climbing and cycling is just a way to stop myself from thinking or doing stupid things.. One more year to go and it seems so far away.. I just want to get this studying over.. Though work isn't something I look forward to, still I have to face it. Work only means less time..  Sigh.. When are we ever satisfied?

      Got my bike today.. Paid 200 up front and another 300 to go next month.. I'm very satisfied with it.. It's from an Italian bike manufacturer  urlLink Colnago   It has  urlLink Shimano 105 quick release brakes  and  urlLink Shimano 105 Double Crankset . It also has Shimano Exage hubs (front/rear) together with Trek Heat Treated rims. The seat is from Selle Italia and Specialized pedals.  There is a problem though.. The front fork.. They need changing.. I reckon he had accidents b4.. Some of the spokes need changing and wheel alignment done.. Brakes and Gears are in good condition and so is the frame.. The moving parts need sine WD40.. Bought a  urlLink Panaracer Extralite Tyre tube  today.. Fucking cost me 29.90 I still need another one and also a mini pump..  Never have I seen tire tubes this way.. My first road bike actually.. Have to bring it to the shop and fix. Crap I'm so lost with road bike technology.  Did some research on the company Colnago and found out that they have affiliation with Ferrari. The CF1 is one of the bikes they created with the combination of technology from both bikes and formula one. Amazing!  Can't wait for Monday or are the shops open today? Hm.. pretty tight with cash actually.. But still I can't wait to try it out..

      Date: 09/07/04 Time: 4 - 10pm Venue: Summit Shoes: Bufo "Spider" Harness: Petzl Corax Descender: Petzl Reverso Total Routes: 17  Met up with Bryan today.. Havent seen him in ages.. He seemed enthusiatic to climb today unlike b4.. Hmm.. I wonder why? Am I a motivator? I just climb.. think less climb more.. haha.. We did 17 routes in total.. Pretty pumped up now.. Aching everywhere.. Thought about Spiderman when I climbed.. haha.. Sometimes people seem to ignore the little teachings they insert in movies.. I think it's meaningful.. Watching movies just for the sake of action is just dumb... If you aren't listening or appreciating the teachings, might as well don't watch.. Well that's my point of view anyway.. Resting day tomorrow.. Sun, Rock Comp.. Climbing "Rocks"..

      A hundred days had made me older since the last time that I saw your pretty face A thousand lights had made me colder and I don’t think I can look at this the same But all the miles had separate They disappeared now when I’m dreaming of your face  I’m here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time I’m here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams And tonight it’s only you and me  The miles just keep rolling as the people either way to say hello I heard this life is overrated but I hope it gets better as we go  I’m here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time I’m here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams And tonight girl it’s only you and me  Everything I know, and anywhere I go  it gets hard but it won’t take away my love And when the last one falls, when it’s all said and done it get hard but it won’t take away my love  I’m here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time I’m here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams And tonight girl it’s only you and me  I’m here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time I’m here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams but tonight girl it’s only you and me

      Phew.. No more using net at the library.. Finally.. Thanks to you Jef.. You're one friend that's hard to find but I'm glad to have known you.. Not too many people like you out there.. Not too many people that care about others than themselves..  Rock comp in 3 days.. Don't even have time to train.. Loads of assignments.. Enough to crack my head.. I'm just glad that I have the net fixed up.. Finally

      Life.. life's a bitch.. Cut my hair yesterday after fixing up my bike.. I regret it like hell now.. I hate it everytime other people keep saying "Hey not nice lar.. cut your hair" Shut up you M**fuckers.. It's not that Im any different if my hair is long or short.. I'm still me that's the bottom line..  Anyway still havent decided if I will continue to keep it longer or to cut it real short.. sigh.. that's why I stay away from the socializing crap.. It's always someone bitching about something they dont like or understand...  Rock comp in about a couple days time.. Hardly train for it but I think I will do fine as long as the routes are under 6A+.. Don't know if I can win anything or not but heck who gives a fuck right? I'm just joining in for the fun of it..  Still waiting for Jef* to pay me money for my PS2.. Yea I sold the thing I love most.. Why? Sick of not having time to even turn it on.. It's either assignments or rock.. Sold it for a mere RM500 bucks coz I owe him some money too.. Going to sell my tv too.. Need to get a new monitor.. The current one is starting to give some signs that it is going "kaput"..  Havent heard from THeo yet about the road bike.. Gotta go Hartamas too to Jen's house to see the other bike.. Miss the feeling of riding bicycles.. driving just make me even more lazy than before but heck who can complain about that when you have to go somewhere really far like.. um.. Summit?  Supposed to have a meeting now but dont know where is Tim.. Heck I better go in soon.. Tomorrow the Internet guy is supposed to come and fix up everything for me.. Hoorah.. damn.. I hope it comes tomorrow.. So sick of waiting.. It has almost been a month.. and next month, expenditure goes down.. fuxk..  Havent heard from Kel for quite sometime... I do read your blog.. I just dont have time to post up comments.. but I will when I get net.. F1 huh? Interesting but I just dont have time to watch people drive around the same track for 60 laps.. I'd rather be the one doing the driving.. Prob need some Jedi power or some shit.. hahaha..  Miss home.. Miss good food.. Miss quiet nights to sleep and home.. Miss mum, dad, bro and everything else I have left behind.. even my culture.. I so fail being a chinese..  Oh oh.. did the fucking weirdest thing last night.. went to 7 eleven and spent almost an hour plus playing guitar with the malay guys that worked there.. It's was fun and cooling too since it rained.. great guys and friendly.. the world should have more of these kind of people...  cheerio..

      It's been a while..  Everything's going as planned and even better.. Did nothing much these couple weeks except climbing... Gonna get net fixed up by next Mon I hope and I really really hope this is the last time I have to write my entry here..  Caught Spidey 2 with Theo and Chin Hooi.. Blarddy good... Gonna catch it again on MOn with Jef.. IT's just marvelous...  Climbing com in a week time and I went for a walk this morning with Jef and I could barely make it..  Sold my PS2 for 600 to Jef.. *Sobs* Well I hardly have time to meddle with it anyway.. Any chance I get, I'd be up there climbing.. Thinking of getting a bike.. Asked Theo's Aunt yesterday if she's interested in selling her road bike.. It's a Shimano and needs a little bit of work and paint respray.. Then I can ask Ellaine to bring me around.. Miss riding bike so much.. It's a part of me that still lives..  Can't afford a mountain bike yet.. not at the moment.. I just need something to ride and something that goes faster than mountain bikes.. I'm only willing to fork out so much for it.. But it's a good investment.. Getting more exercise and cutting down on the ciggies..  I have no idea what has gotten into me but this year is even more change than I had last year.. Hardly hang out with Don and Lincoln these days.. Don't wish to be pulled down.. Commitment to sports is the hardest but the most reward if succeed in sustaining it..  Have yet to know the results of the ADOI competition.. I hope I win something.. Now I just want to focus on the rock com.. First prize, amateur 300 bucks.. could get myself some nice shirts and pants or settle my debts.. haha.. but slowing down on the ciggy is tormenting enough and waking up early just to train is even worse.. what am i getting myself into? Sigh I don't know but it's something I have chosen and I know it's worth it..  Gotta go.. Weird people asking me weird questions.. They have timetable there and they know I don't have classes on Fri and yet they have to ask.. And what's with talking to me all the sudden? I thought she just likes being a bitch and ask people to leave...  I thought I'm weird.. some people!!

       Another one of the typical lazy Sundays.. Woke up in the morning for a ride and ended up back in bed right after that.. No worries I took my bath.. I take 3 or more baths these days due to my constant rides out.. You can't imagine the amount of clothing I have to wash each week! GOd.. I'm so sick of it..      Don called round 3 and ended up here watching movie previews.. He keeps saying that he doesn't have time.. I wonder what he do everyday.. PIck up Swee Pheng, snuggle the whole night? Well we eventually went down KL to pick her up and headed back here.. I think they went BU right after I went biking.. Well I can't be bothered to join anyway since I am never invited for anything else beside eating.. For your information I am not a fan of food.. I eat coz I have to.. It's needed so that I have energy to do what I like.. Anything goes..      Anyway ended back at home round 7.30 at night and the next thing you know I had to go out again.. Had to meet up Celeste at Center POint BU coz I promised we'd meet.. Felt good seeing her again.. Miss them climbing days.. COuldn't hang around long though since I didn't bring along my bike locks and I had work to do.. Always research..      Did more research on WW2 and doing the presentation with some special effects.. Been a while since I did that.. Helped Mimi with her outline too.. She just adore dogs.. I'm not sure either if my outline is right but I don't care.. Just bring em to Penny tomorrow and see what she has to say.. I know my share about bikes but this would be an interesting study since it requires me to go beyond..       Mimi isn't as what people say she is.. Well I don't think so.. Not coz she's cute or anything but I mean it.. Hmm.. actually most pretty girls I see around are pretty snobbish and heck it's like wwhat the fark u lookin at.. God.. who the hell cares? You are smart Mimi, just a little too much procrastination like me.. hahaha.. No hard feelings..      Now it's almost reaching 4 in the morning and I'm still up writing this blog and a couple pics to find for the presentation and soon it shall be done.. A quite night.. peaceful none the less.. The walk out to 7 eleven wasn't bad either.. Those guys wants me to bring my guitar out but sorry dudes.. I'm really tired and I have no mood to hang around late outside..      Changed the position of my room again.. It's still kinda messy but heck I really need to finish up on Moral presentation and start doing the thesis as soon as Penny approves it..      God just now Gerald was in here searching for info about cars.. He's so utterly annoying.. For those people who don't know him and who have never stayed with him(Please pray that you won't ever!!), Gerald is one guy who has super high ego and super annoying at times.. You don't know how desperate I am now to move out of here.. I just can't afford it.. In time I will and phew.. I will even buy lottery that day! Oh I will also kidnap Ah Boy along coz I really pity that dog.. I'll buy him all the chicken he wants!! and a nice home to stay in without some tempremental idiot hitting it when he blows his top..      Time for some Chet Baker.. Hehe.. Jazz.. yea..   I think some people misunderstand that I am crazy about jazz.. well I listen to all sorts of music but it totally depends on my mood.. Sometimes no music IS music.. Just listening to all the sound surrounding me is enough to keep me enlightened..      Another few more slides to go...   More tomorrow..      Nitez all.. Count sheeps.. Baaa..  Baaa..   Baaa....

      I was sitting there a while ago trying to learn how to play that song by the Verve Pipes but it's still kinda hard for me to learn tabs.. My timing isn't good and my left hand fingering sucks.. Need more practise..  I wish I had a completer stereo system now.. The song is great but if you play it with lousy speakers it makes you get sick of the song real fast.. I heard it on my friend's radio the other day and it was fantastic.. but then again which old song doesn't sound good when it's played out of the blue?  Went for a drink with Don just now.. He plans to sell his  urlLink Nokia Ngage QD  for 750 bucks.. What a waste.. People don't decide carefully what they want.. they keep on changing their minds telling themselves that this is not good enough.. Well heck.. it's not my money anyway.. I'm just hoping Jeff sells his  urlLink 3650  and anyway my current one is giving me problems.. Sigh.. but how to tell them that I'm buying a 600 bucks phone? god.. it's crazy.. if I had that kind of money I think I'd prefer to buy my bike a new pair of forks.. haha.. I hate carrying phones anyway.. yes no doubt it is convinient but the thought of some wave following me around wherever I go is not a beautiful thought.. It's bad enough I smoke and now there's something else that can kill me too..  However I have had some instances when I really needed it.. Like when my bike breaks down and when I'm late for class.. haha.. Usually the batteries die when I need it the most.. Irony of life..  The thing I like about not having a phone is that you don't have to be bugged all the time and you'd actually save a lot from making calls and sms.. But then again who am I kidding..  Ok.. hungry again.. Gonna grab something to eat but haven't thought of what yet..

      Did this two nights ago when I couldn't sleep..  Cycle --> Bike Type : Road/Pavement Total time : 0.58.53 Average Speed : 19.7 km/h Distance Travelled : 19.41 km Odo : 169.4 km Max Speed : 39.5 km/h No of rides : One (Night)  The longest I have done in a single session.. My stamina is improving but I still need time to gain strenght.. Still thinking how am I going to save up for them carbon forks.. that'll be 350..  Things to upgrade in time.. or at least till I work..  i. Carbon forks - 350 ii. Aerobar - 170 iii Spokes (64) - 320 iv. Stem - v. Headset - vi. Shoe - 300 vii. Jersey - 160 viii. Cycling pants (FOX) - 150 ix. Brake Lever/Gear shifters - x. Shimano Ultegra 10 speed cassette - xi. Shimano Ultegra crankset - xii. Shimano Ultegra rear derailleur - xiii. Shimano Ultegra front derailleur - xiv. Saddle - xv. Seatpost - xvi. 10 speed chain -  sigh.. so much to find out about and have to have patience.. soon soon.. I think all those things will cost up to thousands.. haha.. that's why I gotta get a good job.. I want to indulge my time in these things and then invest on a good camera and take pic wherever I go.. Too bad there's no one else to go ride with me.. Hmm.. maybe El.. but she's so busy these days..  Might meet up Celeste on Sun.. Haven't seen her for weeks! Well we haven't had time to climb either.. El invited me to go today but I didn't feel like going.. Not that I don't like climbing or anything but I just want to control myself.. THere's so much to do and all the assignments are basically out..  Intern is on the 4 Oct 04 and I hope I get a company that pays.. Tim might be working with a friend.. That is one of my options.. I want to do anything with multimedia, graphics and etc.. Then if I can create a reputable image for myself I might consider going into freelance.. That way I'll have time to work and time to play.. Hehe..  The perfect life scenario...............>  A job that pays round 5K? Haha.. I'm not asking for too much but my indulgence requires that much.. Plus I can save like 1500 or more I think if I had that much..  3 MTBs, 2 road bikes, 2 time trial bikes, and one cruiser..  A full set of climbing gears... harnesses, shoes, decenders, helmet and ropes..  My PS2 again and projector screen that links to my computer, my hi-fi stereos, cable and DVDs collection.. all in my very own home.. with garage full of bikes and all the tools needed to repair em D.I.Y.. A room for climbing.. I'll get em rocks and drill em on the wall and everyday I can do a little bouldering whenever I like it.. Spidey in the house!!  A car would be just fine.. in fact a Kelisa is perfect.. A rack behind to put my bikes for travel.. But come to think of it I still might go with a van.. it'll be so cool.. Might have a motorbike but it's more for cruising purposes..  A couple of bagpacks for travelling purposes and that's about it.. Once a year I'd go travelling.. To some place where it feels more like earth and not always the busy streets and overcrowded buildings.. Just me, myself and the sun.. or my bike would be great.. Travelling would either be for cycling or climbing and both will have lots of pics where I would post online for others to see and the album will be named, "ANother perspective of Life..."  Exeunt  I can picture myself in a couple years time if everything goes as planned.. sigh if I can meet someone to do this together with me it would be even more perfect.. but heck.. what more can I ask..  Getting of mum will be my first greatest achievement.. At least by then I can get whatever I want without having to ask for permission.. I wonder how Gerald's parents can take this even though he's already 27.. my god.. If I'm 27 and living off my mum.. I'd shoot myself.. I'm already delaying it and I feel bad about it.. Mum should be travelling somewhere.. Well she is anyway every weekend nowadays to bros new house.. Nicely done and a good taste in interior design.. Dad hates it though.. He said there's too many lamps around which makes everything gloomy.. But that's the whole point of doing it..

       Today is an excellent day to write.. To write not about sorrows, sadness, grief, mishaps, misadventure, trouble, disasters, annoyance or sorrow.. But instead it is time to write about hope, dreams, goals, ambitions, happiness, joy, fun and the memories that we cherish so much throughout our lives..      I read here and there of sorrows and misery of others and I try hard to understand why and why we are so often filled with pain and anger.. I often see moments of lives of others so much similar to mine and what I have gone through.. Yet there's so much I have yet to experience.. How long ahead is this journey of mine I do not know and how it will end is something I just can't picture.. But I do know whatever it may be or however my story ends I just want to let the rest of the world to know that I am happy with my life. That weeping on the day I die is not allowed at all simply because I want those that remember me to be happy for me because my life is rich and full..      Like most people I go through ups and down but to a certain time I came to realize that these are constants in our lives and it will never go away.. I came to realize that to go through each day is simply to be able to accept those things as they come.. Each day seems the same yet some thing different seems to happen.. Paradoxical yet true.. At some point I find myself no different from when I was 18.. yet somehow I'm not.. I've grown in the years or through time or another way to put it, is that it has always been the same day..      I remember this period of time way back 4 years ago.. Going through the changing phase of my life searching for that true purpose.. I stumbled upon another side of me.. One which I hope to find again for then for a moment in life I lived totally for others.. Others not as in for my girlfriend but instead for everyone else.. I found a moment of bliss.. A purpose I believe that is mine.. I find it hard to keep on doing things for myself.. It just boring to do so.. If I live for someone else and giving and making them happy, my life in turn changes and I'm happy because others are..      I truly believe in that not because I wish to create an image that I am an angel or anything coz I know I'm not.. I do get angry at people.. but mostly at myself for not being able to do what I am supposed to.. For being so selfish and for having such little patience with myself and others..      Is the world so bad? So sad? I don't find it so.. Good moments are made short because it's meant to be remembered and cherished.. If they were too long, we'd get sick of it and it wouldn't mean anything anymore..      I remembered way back, everything to me in life is possible.. the sky is the limit.. I like to remind myself of that sometimes.. namely because I love brain wash myself in believing everything can be done.. When you get that feeling, you can achieve what you thought you can't.. I think that book written by Anthony Robbins really made an impact on me but like he said in the book, it's easier said that done.. Look at the millions and trillions of people around us.. Every being has the potential to become someone, achieve greatness like SHakespeare puts it.. But why aren't all of us living in our dream homes, living like kings and queens? Truly believe that when a man decides to do something, he should know if he is willing to pay the price for it and then do it.. By doing it he goes against every religion and believe he has and also to endure the criticism of others and finally at the end of it all achieve what he has longed for.. There are many great man and women that walked this earth b4 us.. Their names there in history not to portray themselves as the first or the winners but simply to remind us that it's possible and that if they could do it, we could too..      I am a rock climber, cyclist, photographer, artist, guitarist, psychologist, analyst, dreamer, wanderer, writer, advertiser, and most important of all I am a believer.. I believe not only in myself but also in others.. I say be truthful to yourself and believe that you can achieve greatness..      SOme are born great,   Some achieve greatness,   & some have greatness thrust upon them..      Will SHakespeare      This is a long blog and for those of you getting weary do rest your eyes.. or u'll end up like me.. hahaha..      I remember back then when I was younger I have this urge to learn about bikes ever since I successfully rode out on two wheels.. I know it's something I'm destined to hang on to.. The fire that pushes me or the motivation so to say that makes me curious about it is the wonder of physics and how God has perfectly created this world.. With the laws of physics and with inertia and etc.. We can go forward and balance ourselves with these wonderfully crafted machinery.. I love bikes more than anything else in the world.. I just got back to it and I can relate back to the exact feelings I had when I was young..      These are the things that keep me going in life and make me look forward to the next and next day.. Search for that in life and I believe you can be happy whever you are..      Never compare what you have in life with what others have.. It simply doesn't work that way.. and for those of you who do pray.. you can keep on praying for the rest of your lives never finding equality... What you want, you have to be ready to make sacrifices and go through enduring time that stands still.. THere's no two living being that's similar on earth thus there's no two similar lives.. Having what you have is the greatest gift that you'll ever have.. How you build on that is up to you.. The more work and effort, the more you reap..       Here's another way of putting how I see things.. Life is like a boat to me.. A journey and god.. look at that wonderful scenery.. hehe.. oh oops.. You are the captain and the people of the world are your mateys! Ahoy there! hehe.. The helm is in your control and where you head in life is simply a matter of study and navigation.. If one chooses to let go or to anchor oneself to the sea then the boat will simply run in circles.. Which is why we end up doing something all the time hoping for something different yet we don't.. We like most amateur captains need time to grow and learn to navigate and look at the stars... gaze upon them and bewilder at their magnificent glow and the fact that those little thingies in the sky actually points the way to your destiny.. But at the same time ask yourself will there always be clear skies when you head for your goals or when will the stormy night comes and when we need to endure?      At the end of it all when you reach upon the shore of your final fantasy it's when you have broken through all the odds against you and find peace and realize that it has all been worth it..      Phew.. boy am I tired..   Hmm.. that was part of what I wrote last time when I had a my own website with Angelfire.. hehe.. Not bad.. I can remember.. lol... Sorry I was talking to myself.. It's 3:15 in the morning now and I'm staring to lose track of my sentences.. I apologize if there's any grammar mistakes.. hahaha..      Nitez..   Time to count sheeps.. 1002.. 1003.. 1004.. baa..

      Cycle -->  Bike Type : Road/Pavement Total time : 0.36.57 Average Speed : 21.9 km/h Distance Travelled : 13.55 km Odo : 150.0 km Max Speed : 45.5 km/h No of rides : One (Night)  When you read this you must be thinking I'm nuts.. but the fact is, I AM!! lols.. It's 2 in the morning and I had a sudden urge to go out riding.. I guess again to stop myself from thinking so much.. Ended up at Uptown 7 Eleven.. decided to grab a burger.. The longest I have ridden so far in a single trip.. I usually tire out upon reaching 20 mins.. another additional 16mins means improvement.. I still feel out of breath upon reaching the burger stall but I hope by drastically cutting down on my ciggy I hope to improve even more by the end of the year.. You have no idea how it's playing with my mind now..  You have no idea how nice it is to go out riding now.. Everything is quiet.. No one running around, screaming, or shouting or fighting or bitching about one another.. For a moment in life, everything is still and everyone is at peace.. (WEll at least it is here in Malaysia and those in the similar time zones.. lol.. with an exceptional few that's out driving their car trying to wake everyone else up and those other nocturnals like me sitting at the mamak..)  Had a chat with Mimi just now.. We hardly speak to each other in class but I'm glad to get to know her.. Pretty and smart is how I would describe her even though she sees herself otherwise.. I think we're all special in our own ways and that's what matters most..  Went out after we ended our conversation.. to 7 Eleven to see if the malay guys are there.. I brought my guitar along and ended up playing with them til now.. What I like most about these guys is that even though we hardly know each other we don't judge one another and just simply enjoy each others company and play songs for the love of music..  Another place where I hang out these days is at Uptown mamak in the middle.. Those guys really make you feel welcomed and it's that smile I look forward to each day having breakfast or lunch there.. And the half boiled eggs they make is just simply suuuuperb!  Time to count sheeps.. Class later at 3.. As much as I would like to stay back and not go I think I must.. Time to push myself, search within myself and find the strenght to go on.. It's what we have to do and there's hardly any choice.. But like a quote I read b4 in a book and it says "With multiple disciplined efforts, there comes multiple rewards". I believe in that because nothing in this world comes easily.. and even if something comes easy, it usually doesn't last..  Good day to all of you out there, wherever you may be.. The day is young and hopes are high.. Persist and dream and may all your wishes come true..  Exeunt Saint

      You can't imagine the fatigue I'm feeling right now.. The presentation was god.. Penny didn't say a word.. Well nobody did.. coz nobody was paying attention at all even though we had that moment of silence.. I was super nervous.. Not before but during presentation.. Haha.. How bad can it get? I need to restructure my approach and my speech.. Need to overcome this fear.. I just hate to be in the lime light.. I don't need that.. It's like having eyes watching you all the time.. God.. Even my heart beat felt like I was running the 100m..  Went for dinner after that with Jennette, Tim and Mei Li.. I was so hungry I could eat a cow.. But then I didn't.. I chose fish instead.. Yummy Ikan Pari with extra hot sauce.. Well I don't know what sauce you call it but it was hot and it was good.. Sitting there with them was the best.. It's like having conversations with Jeffrey or Jefferson. People that like you because you are just being you..  Jennette's so excited about teaching Timo.. She really love kids..

       Woke up a while ago.. Didn't feel like it at all.. Kept on lingering in bed.. Getting out of bed didn't seem to be in my mind.. Wanted to keep on sleeping.. Wait.. now I sound as if I want to die.. lols.. Well no I'm not looking forward to that.. It's just that it's getting harder to cope.. Feel I'm gonna snap.. I wonder how I'm gonna answer Penny today during the presentation.. Have yet to feel nervous but I know soon I will.. I always do when it comes to presentation and no matter how hard I try to overcome it, it still doesn't work..   Crap.. Can't write right now.. Don't know why I even started this.. Who cares anyway..  Wish I could run..

      Sometimes I wish  I don't have to know more than what I am supposed to.. Maybe I'm  meant to know.. but who can be really sure?  Quit ciggy today.. smoking it doesn't help.. Nothing seems to help right now.. Sleep is the only option..  Feel like I'm in a pool of quicksand.. Well that's life.. There is a need to have the crappy moments before something good happens again.. Need to focus on my assignments and do em right this time... Climbing will really have to stop for a while.. Sobs..  This year I am controlling myself even more.. I'm so near completing this course and I really can't afford to screw it up.. Everything else has to be no.2  The only thing I can do is to ride as much as I can when I have done my work.. Need to budget.. Fixed up my spokes.. Align the wheels too.. for 5 bucks..  Presentation tomorrow.. I hope I know what to say.. Haha.. God I feel sick now..  Sleep.. Ouch..

      Cycle -->  Bike Type : Road/Pavement Total time : 0.55.42 Average Speed : 21.4 km/h Max Speed : 46 km/h Distance Travelled : 19.96 km Total Distance Travelled : 127.9 km No of rides : One (Afternoon)  Took a ride to Jefferson after I got home from Johor.. Going there is about 8 km and back would be a total of 16 km. Had some mee goreng for lunch at the malay stall nearby.. This week.. Everything seems to be in a mess.. I wish to disappear for a while.. That's what I usually do when things get shitty.. And another thing is.. I should just shut my mouth and not say a word.. Coz when I do.. People get pissed off..  You have no idea how desperate I am for a ciggy now but I am trying so hard to quit.. Even tears are starting to roll down my eyes because I am really persisting..  Met Firuz online.. Glad to hear from you dude.. Miss the good old days when we went bashing up monsters in Baldur's Gate.. Ah also how can I forget the GTA3.. This guy, he loves violence and he influenced me.. Hahaha.. But then again we never hurt anyone in real life.. We just pretend that those mofos are in the game and bang bang bang.. die!! Haahaha...  As far back I can remember people always went against him and that's what I like about him.. He came back from States and he is one good copywriter.. I swear!! Well I used to go to his house a lot to hang out and chill since I didn't have my own PS2 then.. after that we kinda got busy with our own stuff and since then we haven't had the chance to meet..  Oh oh.. have to remember to take pictures the next time we meet.. He's one of them people I really cherish a lot and I mean it.. Good friends are hard to come by..  Hope to catch up with you soon dude.. Here's his webby for those of you who is interested in knowing him..  urlLink Firuz  Mummy who are all these people? Hehe.. Nice title dude.. Wish you all the best in setting up a company and don't forget me when you get married.. Oh if by any chance you see Amer, kick his ass for me.. Hahaha.. lol.. Hope to go over and see you sometimes..  Gotta go all.. Life's a bitch.. What else is new? More work and more headaches..

       urlLink    This is Don.. Well we met because of Jason.. I've known him as far back since I known Lincoln and he's one special guy.. He doesn't talk much about his prob though even though we tried hard to open him up but I guess he has his reasons.. He was working with IKEA and now he's with DIGI.. He decided to come to Johor with us and we ended up playing monopoly and PS the whole weekend.. Miss those times dude? I know I do man..&nbsp; urlLink

Just don't burn my bed alright? Haha.. This pic was taken on the 27th April 2002 which is two years back.. We had tons of fun and we drank beer!! Haha..

      Hope dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption Winding in and winding out The shine of it has caught my eye And roped me in So mesmerizing, and so hypnotizing I am captivated, I am...  [Chorus] Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right Swear I knew it all along And I am flawed But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself  So clear Like the diamond in your ring Cut to mirror your intention Oversized and overwhelmed The shine of which has caught my eye And rendered me so isolated, so motivated I am certain now that I am...  [Chorus]  So turn Up the corners of your lips Part them and feel my finger tips Trace the moment, fall forever Defense is paper thin Just one touch and I'd be in Too deep now to ever swim against the current So let me slip away [3x] So let me slip against the current So let me slip away [4x]  [Chorus]  Like hope Dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption...
