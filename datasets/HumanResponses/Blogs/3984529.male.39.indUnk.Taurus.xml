      (Though this time, let's include the U.S. media and the Imperial presidency in this.)  The Democratic convention is over.  We've nominated (in the wonderful words of  The Daily Show 's Jon Stewart) the least objectionable candidate that might possibly beat the Republican pig shit geyser machine.  From his mouth to God's ears, as my sainted grandmother used to say.  What made me laugh so much while watching  The Daily Show  this Wednesday was how accurately they portrayed the complete lack of objectivity of organizations like Fox and MSNBC.  To recap, one of the best speeches of the convention was given by Rev. Al Sharpton.  Now, many years ago when he used to lead clashes with Orthodox Jews in New York, I did not have much liking or respect for him.  He's progressed quite far from that point.  He spoke some hard truths that the conservative pundits could not refute, so they dumped the pig shit on his style, or the fact that he went off the script, or simply invented the notion that he offended the African American delegates.  Even CNN did not really report it neutrally, and I now begin to wonder: if the only source of unbiased reporting in this country is Comedy Central, what does that say about our political system?  And how can we change it?  Let's face it: we  cannot  have a Constitutional Convention, the most drastic of measures the populace has, according to what's left of our Constitution.  It would be either bought by the PACs and lobbyists, or it will be overrun by hysterical fundamentalist Christians demanding that the notion of separation of church and state be stricken, so that Jerry Fallwell could continue to use tax-free funds to campaign for that bag of ignonimity that currently occupies the Oval Office.  Churchill was right. Democracy is the worst form of government, except for those that have already been tried.  My only problem with this notion is that what we have in the United States hardly can be called a democracy.  We have a pseudo-democracy run by oligarchs and plutocrats, and money is the only true way to vote.  Whoever has money can get pretty much anything done: I mean, if it wasn't for his fund-raising abilities and daddy's sweetheart deal to the House of Saud, how could that poor excuse for a lying bastard (and I know, here I am slandering lying bastards by including him in their category) ever get that far in politics?  I mean, if Clarence Thomas's cousin (or niece, or whatever she is) wasn't on his transition committee and still needed a job, if the Reagan/daddy administration didn't appoint scum like Scalia to the Supreme Court, if the Shrub's (for those not familiar with Molly Ivinns' term for him, it means exactly what you think: "A little bush") brother wasn't the governor of Florida, if his campaign manager for Florida didn't also make all the decisions about how to count the votes, and wasn't controlled by an apparatchik like Mike Stepanovitch, where would the moron be?  Back in Crawford where he belongs.  And then the neo-conservative movement, after proving to the country their lack of any ethics, or good ideas, would not have a standard-bearer in the most powerful position on Earth.  In a pseudo-democracy, scapegoats are a requirement.  The far right has proven time and again that they will use anyone and anything as scapegoats, except the bankruptcy of their morals, and stupidity of their programs.  So now the idiot has a new stump speech (which he still can't deliver with his fourth-grade reading abilities: I mean, it's hard to say those two-syllable words they put on a teleprompter for him), and takes  credit for the improved economy.  But has anyone actually looked at who is better off?  Has anyone calculated how much money those who contributed to the Republican theft of the White House in 2000, the  coup d'etat  that even the Democrats are too scared to fully acknowledge, how much money have they made?  And how much the middle class and the poor have lost?  Bubba asked the right question in his convention speech: "Are you, average Republicans, better off than you were in 2000?"  I believe he should have followed it by the question that even the Romans understood: " Cui bono ?"  ("Who gains by this?"  And by how much?).  And after that question is answered, I dare a single Republican with a conscience (and I believe there  are  those people) vote for him again.  I dare you.

      (If you are not familiar with David Mamet's plays, this may not make much sense.)  So here I am, trying to learn my debut part, Richard Roma in  Glengarry Glen Ross .  I've written about that in one of the previous postings.  Off the bat, I have to say, I don't like the play, and I certainly don't like the character.  But that doesn't mean I cannot play him.  In the past, I've rejected entire bodies of work based on a single bad experience (ask me sometime what I think of Tarantino).  It's still hard.  Richard Roma represents all that I hated about the Rooters salesforce.  All the sleaziness, insincerity, Macchiavelian "whatever it takes" attitude, chauvinism, and self-centeredness of some of the top sales people I had the displeasure of working with at Rooters are all clearly represented in the first two of Richard's monologues in Scene 3.  And yet, it's the brand of evil with which I am almost comfortable, precisely because of its familiarity.  So, reading and re-reading both the scene and the play, and watching the movie version over and over, I came to the realization: just because I really do not like it, it doesn't make it bad  per se .  So, in a sense it's a paradox for me: it  is  good work, and I hate it.  Maybe the fact that Mamet was able to elicit such a strong revulsion from me is what makes him such a great writer.  I had lived under the misaprehension that I "must" (yeah, another distorted thought there) like anything that's a good work of art.  Maybe all it takes is to be able to invoke a strong response from the audience...  So, does that mean I am going to have to admit that Mark Rothko is an artist?!?!  Nah!

      A couple of weeks ago, my friend David opened a gallery.  This was a culmination of a dream for him that he's cherished for many years.  By the way, for those who are interested, can visit  urlLink  Paxico Review , a companion site, where the artists involved in the LAUNCH event are presented in more detail.  The week before the opening was quite stressful for all involved.  One artist in particular, Gary Nakamoto, created a twelve-foot wall on wheels that helped the space, and allowed David to present his own work in a highly unusual way (I won't spoil it for those who end up visiting the gallery itself).  Suffice it to say, a lot of people worked their tails off.  It was the night of the event.  I was tired, and my normal social phobias of being in a large space with lots of people I don't personally know were kicking into high gear.  So, the protective camouflage for me was to dress to the sevens (one of these days I will explain my distinction of dressing to the sevens vs. dressing to the nines; those who appreciate clothing, fashion, and choices might get a kick out of it).  Nevertheless, there I was in a linen suit created for me by my dear friend John Cutler (by the way, for those men who know and appreciate exquisite clothing, you may want to get in touch with John in Sydney; he is one of the top three tailors in the world, and in my eyes,  the  top).  I matched it with a very inexpensive Gap t-shirt, custom-colored Berluti sandals, and was trying to decide on jewellery.  Yes, I tend to wear jewellery often.  In this case, the final touches were my absolute favorite watch, the Victoria Torun-designed "3/4" watch from Georg Jensen, Gucci white gold and princess-cut diamond ring, and a Christian Lacroix broche (I often receive compliments about it).  During the week I tried to express my feelings about Gary Nakamoto's work.  I happen to find it soul-stirring.  You can see some of it on the site above, or in the gallery itself.  Gary captures long events in a single frame of film, and the results are breathtaking.  So, armed with all the clothing and jewellery I dared to wear to a casual opening, I came to the gallery.  I was one of the first there, of course, just so I could be around and give David and the other artists moral support.  Gary was already there with a man who looked remarkably like him, who turned out to be his brother, also a lovely man.  I gushed about the work, and explained what I saw in it that moved me so much.  I then proceeded to look at the other works.  Besides David's two pieces with which I was quite familiar (and in fact like very much), the most striking exhibit was a set of five works by Susan Choi.  She called it her "Orientalism" portraits, and I won't attempt to describe the complex combination of classical paintings and perfectly executed photographs of one or two mostly nude women.  I saw them as surrealistic moments in time, and admired them for a while.  Once I was done with that, I started playing my usual part, that of an observer.  I tend to be shy in large gatherings (see some of the previous articles), and am exceedingly uncomfortable in approaching people whom I don't know.  Several people, seeming less shy approached me, and one of those turned out to be a great woman called Mary, with whom I will be spending some time as early as tomorrow night.  I won't go into her story (she deserves an article all her own).  The experience was turning out to be positive so far, when Gary approached me and said he had something for me.  He took me to the back room of the gallery and presented me with one of his photographs (in fact, it's the one that appears on the  urlLink  Paxico Review  site's opening page).  I was more than moved.  I had tears in my eyes, and a lump in my throat.  When I was talking to people about how much I admire Gary's work, my intention was to interest them in some of the beautiful subtleties, and several of them thanked me for pointing them out.  I hadn't asked anything of Gary.  He felt presenting me with his work was something  he  wanted to do.  But the warm feelings I already felt toward him, and my pleasure in being at the opening were underscored and highlighted by this selfless act of generosity.  We made a deal: he will stick around for a long time making his works, and I will stick around for a long time to admire it.  I cannot wait to see what he produces next.  And next time I am invited to an opening such as this, I will be going with less dread, and with more anticipation of pleasurable and positive experiences.  For those who know me well, that's progress.

      ... that is the question.  Whether 'tis nobler in our minds to suffer the slights and insults of the self-appointed "judges", or, by ignoring, cast them.  I doubt I could continue trying to parallel Hamlet's speech, but I've been thinking how Hamlet's dilemma is one that sometimes echoes in the gay community.  Who defines whether one is "good enough"?  There are plenty of self-appointed arbiters of taste, looks, and many other external attributes, but none of them focus on anything but the outer appearance.  Sure, in the world where advertisements, movies, magazines, television, and everything else we are exposed to tells us that if we don't present the right outer appearance, we are "less than," those who buy into it feel justified to judge.  And these judgements can be devastating.  I still remember an incident that happened 17 years ago.  I had just moved to Los  Angeles, and after exploring non-stop sex (which I equated with being accepted, and even being loved), and realizing something was missing, I tried the clubs.  The premier clubs at the time were Rage and Studio One.  I walked into Rage fairly early (for those not familiar with the gay schedule, to appear at a club before 10 PM in those days was considered shockingly tasteless, unless you were already getting drunk).  The club was fairly empty, and there was a vision of a guy standing near the bar, apparently by himself, and I, dazzled by his jawline, long eyelashes, and slim waist, and equating beauty with goodness, screwed up all the courage I could muster and came up to him.  He appeared not to notice.  So, I said "Hi, how are you?"  He turned slowly and deliberately in my direction, and looked down (he was about 6'1" to my barely 5'8").  The look that he gave me was the same look a fastidious person, forced to walk into a public bathroom at a typical fast-food place, gives the facilities there: pure disgust.  He then said, in a tone that crushed me for the next 17 years: " You  are trying to talk to  me ??" and pointedly turned away.  I ran.  I couldn't let the tears show on Santa Monica Boulevard, in the middle of "Boystown," but thankfully, that night I parked on a little side street.  When I managed to open the car door, I was bawling, though silently.  I didn't even feel the right to cry out loud.  I was a bug that was to be squashed by those I found attractive.  I had no right to even approach a man I found attractive.  That was the last time I  ever  approached a man in a gay establishment.  Seventeen years later, I am still terrified of rejection.  I have yet to approach anyone in a social situation where I am not the center, or close to the center, of attention.  When my therapist suggested that to begin wokring on this side of social shyness I might start small, inconsequential conversations with people on the street, I swallowed down the old terror response and promised myself I will try.  I will either find people who will respond kindly, or I will prove her wrong.  So, slowly, I've been starting small conversations, mostly in elevators, and so far, the experiences have been completely positive.  Just yesterday, in a parking lot elevator I saw a beautiful middle-aged African-American woman with a Louis Vuitton purse with lavender, pink, and purple flowers, and wearing a dress, shoes, and inexpensive jewelry to match.  I felt I could say something to her.  "Excuse me, but I have to tell you, that purse and that outfit look fantastic together."  A wide smile broke her face.  "It's just happened that way."  "Nevertheless, I just wanted to tell you that you look beautiful."  The elevator door opened, and as she walked out, she gave me a dazzling smile and said, "I like you!  Thank you for that!"  People are not all the same.  Their reactions are not all the same.  I just wish I could have as much courage talking to a gay man as I have to a straight woman.

      I am taking several classes, but in this case, I am talking about the one that combines acting and directing skills on a film set.  It is taught by two very different people, and each instructor, as I have come to appreciate, adds his and her own perspective on the jobs of actors and directors.  Each student in the class must act in one scene, and co-direct another.  Well, my acting debut (save the unwritten, imagined production I wanted to create in 4th grade) is yet to come, and it'll be a hoot to see if I can pull off the role of Richard Roma in  Glengarry Glen Ross .  For those who saw the movie, this was the role played by Al Pacino.  Let's face it, I am  not  Al Pacino, in any way, save for the fact that we are both not too tall, and have dark hair and eyes.  I have no acting experience, but I am looking forward to the challenge, and thinking of my personal touches to add to the performance.  But that's next week.  This past weekend I was directing.  It's amazing what neophytes don't know about the process of directing.  That's OK: I am taking the class to learn (among others, I might add).  But what I could not have imagined is how much one sweats when one is directing.  This isn't just due to the lights, or the constant moving around making sure that everyone's questions on the set are answered.  Some of it is sweating (literally) over the choices you make.  Directing, to me, is all about choices, and if you make the wrong one (or, properly put, since I am in therapy, a less-than-optimal one), it cascades into a series of other problems that sometimes may or may not be fixed.  The three and a half hours went by like a blur, and I made my learning mistakes.   That's OK : that's why I am in class, and not on a studio lot, with the meter (and the producer's patience) running.  It was still somewhat embarrassing, even though only the instructor knew that the choices could have been different.  Overall, it was a day of sweat pouring down my face, down my neck, down my back...  At the end of it I was asked to help a fellow student who directed a scene in the morning, and that experience resulted in a revelation: how much joy I received by working collaboratively with that man, salvaging tiny pieces of takes and putting them together into a finished work that could easily serve as a rough cut.  It didn't hurt that he was a very nice man, who tried his best to make me comfortable helping him acheive a vision.  So, after arriving home in the afternoon feeling exhausted, and unsure if I would be able to go help with the editing (as well as of myself in general; remember, I did say I was insecure), I found myself so energized by the process that when I left our portable editing studio around 11 PM I felt rested, relaxed, and very peaceful.  So...  A new career, perhaps?  Maybe.  But it certainly shows how a day can turn around on a dime even for someone who is so afraid of failure, of being wrong, of being "found out"...  Having a supportive environment, working with individuals who praise your strengths and do not berate you for your weaknesses was the pleasure of the experience.  One of my therapists once said to me that I was abused on every job I've ever worked (see the ruminations about the demise of Quovadx).  I am going to chalk up this experience as my first completed job that was directly supportive.  Maybe that's the key in finding the next thing to do: a truly supportive environment.  Anyone know of companies like that where I could earn a living?

      I've been questioning the notion that I am an artist.  I'd like to be one, but I am not sure what would make me an artist in my own mind.  David keeps telling me I am one.  Several people expressed interest in some of my work with still photography (unfortunately, my "movies" aren't quite ready for prime time, but I am hoping one will be, and soon!).  When I went on a trip this January/February/March, I managed to take a number of photos.  Some of them did not survive a technical difficulty, and some of them aren't up to my standards to share.  But I turned one set into an iPhoto book, and then published it on  urlLink  my .Mac page .  I will probably add a couple of other albums to it soon, but for those who are curious about my views on beauty, particularly melancholy beauty, that album might be of interest.  Some of the items have been thoroughly manipulated (I felt I had the right to do so to achieve certain effects).  One image in particular (and I doubt anyone can guess which one it is) was untouched, and presented exactly as I took it.  If you are curious about the title, "Weak in the Presence," it comes from Alison Moyet's song, "(I Grow) Weak in the Presence of Beauty."  And I do.  Beauty affects me deeply, but what I see as beauty may not be what you see as beautiful or even interesting.  Take a look.  What do you think?  More important to me is what do you feel?  I would be curious to hear from those who are  not simply neutral  about it.  Finally, keep in mind that I am working under the constraints of not really knowing anything about HTML, and with only those toold that Apple provided me, so if the packaging looks generic, I apologise.  I am more interested in people's view of the concepts and images, not the structure of the page.  When I am rich, David will design one of his truly elegant creations for me to show off my work the way he has done for other artists.  Maybe then I will be ready to call myself that.  Now, I just aspire.

      I suspect I will do several posts on this subject, since it's been coming up in therapy.  For those unfamiliar with the concept, let me summarize what many psychologists call the "10 Distorted Thinking Patterns":  1.   All or nothing thinking :  You look at things in absolute, black-and-white categories.  2.   Overgeneralization :  You view a negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.  3.   Mental filter :  You dwell on negatives and ignore the positives.  4.   Discounting the positives :  You insist that your accomplishments or positive qualities don't count.  5.   Jumping to conclusions :  You conclude things are bad without any definitive evidence.         (a)  Mind reading :  You assume people are reacting negatively to you.         (b)  Fortune-telling :  You predict that things will turn out badly.  6.   Magnification or minimization :  You blow things way out of proportion or you shrink their importance.  7.   Emotional reasoning :  You reason from how you feel: "I feel like an idiot, so I must be one."  8.   "Should" statements :  You criticize yourself or other people with "shoulds," "shouldn'ts," "musts," "oughts," and "have-tos."  9.   Labeling :  Instead of saying "I made a mistake," you tell yourself "I'm a jerk," or "a loser."  10.  Blame :  You blame yourself for something you weren't entirely responsible for, or you blame other people and overlook ways that you contributed to the problem.  To give credit where it's due, these come from David D. Burns's  Ten Days to Self-esteem .  These are not new ideas.  So, dealing with several situations today, I've been watching for my own distorted thinking patterns.  For example, I had to meet with two people from a class to discuss a couple of scenes in which we are involved.  It's a directing and acting class, so everyone gets to act in one scene, and direct another.  Even though the instructor asked a month ago for people to read both plays as soon as possible, one of the people hadn't bothered to do so, and came completely unprepared to the meeting.  So, while avoiding "shoulds," I was labelling him to the max!  "What an asshole!"  "What a slacker!"  I also managed to magnify this, and fortune-tell at the same time: "This is horrible!  He will ruin the class for me and everyone involved!"  And I certainly made all these observations in black and white: "He is completely incompetent, there is nothing he will do that will be right."  Well, that was also some more fortune-telling, overgeneralization, labelling, and blame.  Imagine, all those distorted thinking patterns in only 14 words!  I guess I am going for the record...  So if one short (30 minute) event can generate that many distorted thoughts, I wonder, how many of those do I have per day?  And I overgeneralize, "My entire thinking is distorted!", making sure that it's all in black-and-white terms.  No wonder therapy costs so much!  Trying to change these thinking patterns seems to be a Herculean task.  But I am thinking that the idiot that I am, I must succeed, or the world will fall apart!  There!

      As many of you know, politics is a bit of a hobby-horse for me.  When I thought I was rich, I even donated obscene amounts of money to the Democratic National Committee, just to see Al Gore's lack-luster, "I'm so concerned about the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal editorial pages" pseudo-attempt to take his rightful win and become president.  Mind you, it's not that I thought Al Gore would have been a good president: he suffers the Jimmy Carter disease.  Besides, Tipper Gore as first lady?!  I mean, didn't we suffer enough with Nancy Reagan?  So, we got what we didn't deserve.  Scalia and Renquist, hoping and praying that someone like Stevens will either die or retire, shoved Dubya into the white house.  I thought the inauguration was a good indication of how this presidency was going to go.  I wished I could have been there with the crowd, throwing rotten eggs at that limo.  Of course, some rabid Republican, like one of my mother's closest friends, might ask, what do I have against the Republicans?  And you know, the answer is, not much, until we get to the neo-Republicans.  If the writings of William F. Buckley and Barry Goldwater in the 1980s (not the 1960s hysteria, mind you) represented Republican values, I'd be a Republican.  Really.  But that's not what happened.  With the born-again conversion of Ronald Reagan at Nancy's insistence (I always had this image of Nancy having her arm so far up Ronnie's ass that she was able to move his mouth!), and Reagans' open pandering to the ultra-right (Fallwell, Robertson, and the rest of that pig shit lagoon crowd), having thought of myself as a Republican in 1983, by 1985 it became clear that the hypocrisy, duplicity, and sheer nastiness of that party could not hold any allegiance for me.  So I looked to the Democrats (and don't tell me about third parties!  If there is one thing Ralph Nader does make sense on, it's that the rise of a third party will not happen in this country, and if it does, {and here I disagree with Ralphie-boy}, it won't be a progressive party, it will be some abortion of the ultra-right and ultra-stupid).  By the definition of that asshole who was on Fresh Air recently (the one who ran a conservative PAC that tries to crush anyone who isn't a Reagan Republican in their view), I am definitely elitist.  I drink cappuchinos.  I love sushi.  I used to drive a Volvo.  My radio is tuned almost exclusively to NPR (except when Garrison Keilor comes on; for some reason I just cannot endure him).  I am educated.  I am broad-minded.  I believe that if a government isn't going to be Jeffersonian in nature, it had better provide some decent social services.  So yes, I am an elitist.  Want to hear something shocking?  I believe there ought to be a test you have to take to vote.  Not an intelligence test, or a constitution test (the way the Southerners tried to keep blacks from voting in the elections, definitely not that!) but a test of (1) common sense, and (2) understanding of the issues.  I mean, think of it: any bubba (note, "bubba" in lower case; I  loved  Bubba the president!) who can barely scratch his ass, and doesn't know the difference between the House and the Senate can vote in an election.  And this is how America gets a congenital moron appointed president.  Well, that's not the only way.  Roger Ayres (sp?) and Karl Rove, to me, are the definition of evil.  These aren't principled men who believe strongly in their positions, and then fight for them.  These are muggers.  They mug ordinary people, hitting them over the head with the club of push-polls, lies, and propaganda (and I *know* propaganda: I lived in the Soviet Union long enough to be sick of it for the rest of my life!).  The thing that angers me today, the day the first part of the 9/11 report comes out, is that it blames the Clinton White House (along with the Shrub).  Once again, political motivations drive the findings of a "neutral" committee.  This committee is as neutral as James A. Baker.  And the fact that the rest of the report is to be held up until after the election helps only one person: the monkey in the Oval Office (he does look like a monkey, doesn't he?).  The other thing that angers me is that Democrats aren't even fighting the notion that that moron is a war-time president.  He dares to compare himself with FDR!...  He  created  this war, and in his words, it was because Saddam tried to kill his Daddy!  And that makes him a war-time president?  Sure, ever since Nixon, Republicans knew that a war helps them in the election, though it took Reagan to figure out that it better be quick, decisive, and totally victorious for America.  Anyone remember Grenada?  I am sure that by the end of his term, Reagan forgot it.  So did most politicians.  If you don't learn from history, it's going to come back and drop on you like a ton of bricks.  I just want to be there when the proverbial ton of bricks falls on the neo-Conservative leadership.  Oh, what joy it would be!

      I've been asked several times why I went to work for Quovadx, and then it didn't last.  The simple answer was, I needed the money, and they were the only ones who were offering.  Sure, they were offering a lot less than I wanted, certainly a lot less than even Rooters were paying me at the end, but I was stuck with no money, piles of debt, uncertain housing future (at some point, one of these entries might entale the story of the Floods), and boredom.  I was convinced at the time that I needed a job as fast as possible, and the fact that there were alarm bells going off be damned.  By the way, if you are keeping score, this was another one of David's predictions.  He told me to think not about the money, but about being happy.  I didn't understand (or was unwilling to listen and understand) then.  The first note of alarm was in the interview process.  Debbie Dean barely asked any pertinent questions, and I thought that was that.  Then came the requests for the memos.  With 20/20 hindsight, that was the point to say "Uh-uh!"  But as you, dear reader know, I don't see 20/20 in any direction...  :^)  In any case, the last interview was with the entire executive committee, and I was intrigued by the fact that I was treated better than I was at Rooters.  Isn't it amazing, the first time you aren't abused in a situation in which you are so used to abuse that its lack (or, maybe, lesser severity) seems like heaven on Earth?  Jeffrey (for those who know who he is) pointed that out to me in a session.  He said that I was abused at every single job I'd had before Quovadx, and he was right in all senses of the word.  So the offer came, I accepted it, and flew to Dallas for the company meeting.  At first I was pleasantly surprised that the CEO was a participant, and not a down-the-nose observer  a la  Vivek and company.  Then came the mildly unsettling feeling when my supposed supervisor refused to even acknowledge my presence (I still don't know what it is that I've done to Debbie; all I felt from her was contempt).  Mark's announcement that he was to be my boss was a load off my shoulders: he seemed like a good guy, and in a lot of ways, he is.  But his notion that he had the inner ear of Lorine was the delusion that clouded my judgement for the next few months.  I was told to figure out strategies for how the company could enter into the financial markets.  To me, coming from Rooters, that meant the Global Financial Fortune 100.  I mean, if you're in there (even in a couple of those!), the rest fall like dominoes, don't they?  Boy, was that wrong!  They just wanted to sell to third tier, preferably through tele-sales!  (My gawd, telesales to large financial companies?!?!?!)  Almost immediately the pressure to start a direct mail campaign to attract buyers floored me.  I mean, could you imagine someone like the CIO of Merrill Lynch opening a direct mail envelope and calling?  To be perfectly honest, Mark did have some suggestions: personalize the campaign, make it exclusive, make it from me...  That's all well and good, but remember, I was preaching Solutions Sales at Rooters for years, and (in my humble opinion) knew how to do them.  Then I looked into the Quovadx software offering.  I was appauled.  I couldn't understand why anyone who is not a laggard in the market would buy it!  I mean, this company is pushing generation 1 of stuff that everyone else is selling at generation 3!  Where was my UBV?  What was the unique and compelling proposition that I could make to HSBC or Credit Suisse?  It was a disaster, and only Cory seemed to understand.  I was so thrilled when Mark told me Cory will be closely involved.  And he listened, and he took my complaints about the software seriously.  For that I will always respect the man.  Months of strategizing went by.  Eventually the System X release was close enough on the horizon that I could begin taking it out into the world.  I even got myself some competent salespeople (well, save one, and I lay that turkey squarely at Ron Renjilian's feet).  But when we came together in Denver for our grand council and strategy meeting, it became very clear: the company will not do what's necessary to enter the market.  The last straw was the marketing budget and the phone call with Lorine.  I offered a marketing budget of $450K to bring in between $3M and $5M of revenue over 24 months.  It was rejected out of hand.  Then the fateful call with Lorine on the Monday before Thanksgiving 2003 clinched it for me.  The stream of offal that came out of her mouth directed at me felt like that pig shit geyser Al Franken described in "Lies...".  I was being abused.  If they didn't lay me off with the other 60-odd people Lorine was kicking off the payroll, I was going to quit.  Thankfully, the next morning, Mark called and sheepishly offered a few platitudes, suggesting that things didn't work out.  In the end, assigning blame is a fool's game, but then, I am a bit of a fool, as some of you know very well.  So I did assign blame, and seemed to feel better for it.  That chapter was closed, and with the exception of Lisa, Phil, Michael, Kim, and Ernie, I wanted to forget that place existed.  The epilogue came when an article about Quovadx appeared in the Wall Street Journal.  It was the first indication that the jig was up for Lorine and Gary, and my only regret is that Ron Renjilian and Dave Nesvisky weren't included in the sacking and the investigation.  There was nothing to investigate about Debbie: she is just petty, venal, and out of her depth.  My dislike for her stems from her treatment of Lisa, and anyone else she felt "didn't rate."  Seeing Lisa's e-mail with the article from the Rocky Mountain News today prompted this entry.  The vengeful part of me hopes that when Lorine and Gary go to jail, they are joined at least by Ron.  I couldn't hope that the prosecutors could get Dave.  After all, anyone with Oracle experience knows how to cover up after himself.  Time to forget Quovadx and move on.  This isn't a catharsis, but it's a place where I get to tell things my way, and if anyone disagrees, well, it's my blog, dammit!  :^)

      Sometimes leaving assumptions at the door is a really good idea.  Case and point: while taking a class in which I am going to make a short film, I was so resistant to the idea of deciding on the shot list before writing the script that I almost rebelled against the instructor.  I mean, who's ever heard of such a thing, right?  Well, after thinking about it for a while, I realized what she was trying to accomplish: she is teaching us to think visually.  While people may be visually-oriented in the way they store information (and if you believe in Neuro-Linguistic Programming, you might even claim that you could  predict  how they recall information), I think most of us don't  think  visually.  Maybe she has something there.  I'll let you know on September 15, after the  chef d'oeuvre  will be shown to the audience the night before.  I might have to tell her she was right!  How horrible!

      Yes, that was Betty's darkest hour (she claims) when she went on a tour by that name, but it's still one of my favourite memories.  Darlene, Greg, Anna and I went to the Concord Pavillion (who knows which company owns the rights to its name now!), and sat on the grass.  Unfortunately, at that age, I didn't know how to ask the nice gay couple sitting next to us for some of their grass...  But then that's a separate story.  I remember rolling around and laughing so hard that my sides ached, my cheeks ached, and I still laughed.  Betty came out on stage in Act 2 in a long black dress and said, "I'm gonna tell some jokes now."  I timed it.  An hour and fifteen minutes from the first Sophie Tucker joke (I wish I had that entire collection!) to the "don't tell anyone I told you guys this" joke about the Queen and Princess Di (this is 1983, guys!) going fox hunting.  That joke saved my ass many years later when I was forced to tell a joke at a dinner with the most obnoxious CIO of a bank I'd ever met: Donald MacDonald of NAB.  Yes, I am going to name names in these entries.  Keep checking back!

      (And I bet you wondered if I was even going to go there!)  Yes, I went there.  But as I was driving into the parking lot (I am doing this entry at a Starbucks in West LA), there was a quick headline on NPR: a study found that people who've just started taking anti-depressants are 40 (yes, forty!) times more likely to attempt or commit suicide.  Go figure!  But then, David  did  figure it out.  Think of it.  He's been saying it for years.  Which brings us to David and his predictive capabilities.  I can't wait what he will predict next!  Anyway, for those who wondered, the attempt was (1) completely serious (as opposed a cry for help), and (2) I was  not  thinking of anyone else, or anyone else's reaction.  I simply couldn't live with myself.  Which is so ironic, since as I type this, I am listening "(I Can) Stand Up For Myself" by Army of Lovers!  Life is like that at times, isn't it?  So for those who are worrying, yes, I still have the ideations, but I am learning to live with them.  Just like I am learning to live with feelings (besides anger, that is!).  It's a process.

      So, with lots of reservations, and lots of worries, here I am creating a blog.  And if anyone is wondering why I did it, well, I was inspired by  urlLink  Charles and his blog .  He likes writing, and is good at it, and I'd like to be that way.  So I am going to talk about everything from what frustrates me at the moment to past experiences.  I won't advertize its existence to a lot of people, but if you are reading this, either I specifically invited you to do so, or someone I invited thought you might appreciate what I have to say.  So, we're initialized.  Time to add contents!

      (On a lighter note this time...)  I've been fortunate to associate over the last few weeks with two puppies.  One is a 10-11 month old Chihuahua that my neighbours/owners of the house where I live just got for their six-year old son.  His name is Knuckles (and you have to ask the six-year old, Dylan what the name represents), and the other, when I met him two weeks ago, was a five-week old cocker spaniel, Samba.  For those who know me, you know how much I love dogs.  Puppies melt my heart immediately, espeically when they are friendly, and lick me, and these two tend to do that whenever they see me.  I see Knucles almost every day.  He is quite self-possessed, but being a puppy, and having been rescued from a less-than-ideal environment, was cautious the first day.  Since then, we've been "kissing cousins."  He always runs up to me, lets me scratch him, and licks me wherever he can reach.  I usually get down as low as I can so he can lick my face.  I mean, hey, if I don't have a man doing it, I might as well get the love from the puppy, right?  Well, Knuckles has two housemates of the four-legged variety, an elder border collie, Pasha, and a cat called Barry (we still haven't decided if he was named after Barry White or Barry Manilow, and probably never will: this was another example of Dylan's naming).  My relationship with Pasha has been a cool one: she is very protective of her owner (Melodie), and usually barks when I approach Melodie or another member of her family; however, when she is in the yard by herself, she is perfectly content to let me walk around on "her" territory.  Yesterday things changed slightly.  As she saw Knucles rolling toward me (he's still having trouble walking gracefully, which is endearing in itself), she tried to run interference, and push him away.  Knuckles ignored her and continued his approach, I got my kisses, and Pasha, seeing that I am a friend of dogs (but not of Barry), even gave me a couple of licks of her own.  Samba is someone I only get to see during class.  His owner, Regia, brings him to class, and he sometimes runs around the lecture hall, always making sure to at least say "hello" to me.  Last night during class, even the instructor was playing with him while lecturing.  Eventually, when Samba rolled up (his paw coordination is just not there, and that makes him even cuter, if you can imagine!), and insisted on lots of scratching.  Since I was bending down to scratch him, I thought I'd make both of us comfortable.  I took him in my lap, where he proceeded to give me lots of kisses, and then decided that I make a great chew toy for his little growing teeth.  For those who haven't seen me over the last couple of months, I've gotten my second ear pierced, and had the first piercing (in the other ear) widened.  I am wearing these little hoops with metal balls.  So, Samba went to town, alternating licking my ear (once more, if I can't have a boyfriend do it, why not Samba, right?), and chewing on the earring.  Then he decided that the earring and the ear lobe just weren't enough.  He transferred the chewing to my nose.  With teeth as small as his, it's not painful at all, and I was perfectly content to listen to the lecture while Samba climed all over me, chewed my nose and licked my face.  He was adorable.  I always notice dogs, and (in those rare instances) when I walk around the neighbourhood, I make sure to at least compliment the dog owners when I meet them, and greet the dogs in a non-threatening manner.  I guess they can recognize that I love them, and they've always treated me well.  I think when I get sufficiently well to go looking for work, and still have free time on my hands, I might consider owning a dog again.  My last dog, Tony, was a joy from the moment we picked him up from the breeder when he was six weeks old, and throughout his fourteen year life.  At times, when I was feeling particularly sad or depressed, he would sense it, and spend as much time with me as he could.  My parents' current dog, Duke, who looks very much like Tony, has also fallen head over heals in love with me, and doesn't let my parents approach me until he gets his greetings in.  Maybe the reason I like guys who are a bit younger and small-framed, with big puppy eyes and long eye-lashes goes back to my feeling for puppies.  I've dated a number of guys who could best be described as puppies, the last one being *very* puppy-like in his devotion and attempting to please.  Soo maybe instead of a boyfriend I should settle for a dog.  But again, would it be enough?  I am still pondering that question.

      This subject has come up between David and me at least a few times per week.  I have watched him struggle with the fact that people promise to do something, or make plans, and then flake.  This thought was on my mind while I was driving to school lat night (Tuesday) for my remaining class (I've still got a whole month of it), and it came up again when I got there.  The instructor made several appointments with students so she could help them in their work to create that first short film.  I was a bit anxious while I drove (for some reason, the traffic last night was worse than normal, but then, it's LA, folks!), because I knew she expected me there.  I enjoy being on campus, and often arrive much earlier than needed, but last night, miracle of miracles, I started an e-mail conversation with a really nice guy on Friendster.  I hadn't logged onto friendster in close to a year, but I was bored last afternoon, and since it's a nice, non-sexual way to increase one's acquaintances (and, hopefully, make friends), I went back to it.  My profile and pictures were way out of date, so I updated both (there are probably more details in some of my other profiles, including the one here on Blogger).  The I searched for interesting men.  One of the guys I sent a message to responded almost immediately, and we even ended up exchanging "real" e-mail addresses.  I'll see what comes of it, he seems like someone with whom it would be a pleasure to hang out.  So, as I realized I only had 45 minutes to get to UCLA (without traffic it would take 15-20 mins, but I walked out the door immediately, and that was a good choice: I made it to the classroom right on time).  This particular instructor has a way of communicating that not everyone appreciates, but I like her, and I dare say she seems to like me.  The "not following through" came up when, after she worked through my storyboards, she was faced with the fact that two other students with whom she made appointments before class did not show up.  I was sad on her behalf: there she is, trying to help people, and they don't have the courtesy to follow through.  David has been experiencing this in relation to a number of recent events in his life, and his level of frustration is higher than mine.  Being somewhat pessimistic, I don't always expect people to follow through, but I am still rather upset by an actor who promised to help me with the film (she was going to play the major role) hasn't been easy to reach, nor has she done, to the best of my knoweldge, what she offered to do.  Today (Wednesday), after I wake up and see my doctor (someone else that isn't very good at following through), I will call her and give her one last chance.  If I cannot reach her, I will go with another actor, who is a lovely woman, and who, with a bit of work, will most likely pull through on the piece.  The whole notion of commitment has been a thematic experience for me.  For many years I was convinced that there was  no one  on whom I could rely.  I had friends, even close ones, who would either flake, or just not be there for me when I needed their help, and I stopped asking for that help.  But I still wonder how people continue to do this.  I don't ask "why," since the "why" isn't important.  I keep asking myself what am I doing wrong in making commitments, following through, and not receiving it in return.  I've begun to believe that it's a societal shift in some ways: too many people have told me of similar experiences.  But if we cannot rely on one another, doesn't that lead to isolation?  And doesn't the isolation add to other negative feelings, like depression, and lowering of one's self-worth?  Once more the world shows its imperfections.  Once more I want the world to be logical, and get disappointed.  Frank Herbert once wrote that the Universe is at least one step beyond logic, which is what makes it so hard for humans to understand it and their connection to it.  And yet, there are those who live by the same set of rules as David and I.  I know I can expect them to either follow through on commitments, or plans made, and not worry that they will flake at the last moment.  So there is hope out there.  But is it enough?  To quote the inimitable Harvey Fierstein, "what  is  enough?"  I am still struggling with that one, for my sake, for David's sake, and for the sake of other people who commit and see others treat that commitment without respect.

      In my musical collection there are at least five different songs titled "I Need A Man."  For a long time, I've told everyone that I don't "need" one, but it sure would be great to have one, especially after I got over the initial shock and disappointment of the Marc situation (yeah, we are talking ancient history, 1989).  I still love most of those songs, though I now say to myself "I  want  a man, but I don't know where or how to get one."  I mean, what are the possibilities, when, as one rather perceptive woman pointed out, I've got three strikes against me: I am overweight, I am highly intelligent (yes, I am saying that), and I am gay.  You, gentle reader, might wonder why the third is a strike.  I mean, it wouldn't make sense looking for a man if I wasn't gay, but the context of most gay interactions makes it so.  Bars and clubs are not my cup of tea: besides the terror of approaching someone and being rejected, or being "seen through" (I believe I mentioned that in a past article), the people who frequent bars like to drink and like to hang out at them.  I don't find either of those to be big pluses when it comes to meeting someone with whom I am compatible.  The first two strikes have to do with the gay community prejudices.  Someone who is overweight is a "sub-type," and mostly rejected out of hand, except by people who are into "plus size" men.  I've had a couple of experiences meeting that type of person, and all it did was make me even more self-conscious about my body.  As for intelligence, unless it's focused on  bon mots  and bitchy remarks, in my experience it doesn't seem to be a plus for guys.  It may be coupled with the fact that when I am nervous, or want to be liked, I babble.  You may think, "Oh, but that's not such a big deal!"  You've never heard me babble when I am trying to "get" someone to like me, whether for dating purposes, or just for the sake of feeling a positive response.  And if you don't believe me, ask David.  He's been a keen observer of my babbling outbursts, and has often told me in the past that when he witnessed them, he felt like saying "Leo, enough!"  The continued longing and desire for outside positive reinforcement has a great deal to do with it.  But lack of social skills when faced with a stranger (I don't have a problem with non-strangers) puts me onto automatic pilot.  The automatic pilot, or, in the words of Caroline, "the old house" (a psychological metaphor we've been using in therapy) are gut responses to situations where I am not comfortable being myself.  For those few who've read Lois McMaster Bujold's  Miles Vorkosigan  Series, particularly  Mirror Dance  and  A Civil Campaign , I have all the self-confidence of Mark.  That may not say anything to most of you, but I cannot think of another literary example that fits the situation.  So, like Mark Vorkosigan, I want to be liked.  Like Mark Vorkosigan, I don't have much of any self-confidence that a man will like me.  And like Mark Vorkosigan, I crave approval from outside, not having yet created "the new house" where the approval can come from within.  Is it any wonder that I want a man, but can't seem to find one?

      I am back to my insomniac cycle: sleep for 3-4 hours, then stay awake for a while, then, if I am really lucky, get a couple more hours of sleep.  Being up in the dead of night, one is faced with the question of what to do...  So I update software, I log onto several messenger services, I watch bits of movies that might be in my DVD drive.  I felt lucky when I was sleeping all the way through the night for a couple of months, but there was a negative side-effect: nightmares.  Now, normally I don't remember my dreams very well, but these were so clear that I felt I was conscious in them, and could recall some of the details hours after being awakened by them.  Mostly they left an unpleasant feeling down deep in my core: they seemed to be related to job anxiety, performance anxiety (no, not in the sack! artistically!), and a significant amount of self-deprecation, as dreams sometimes do.  So, here I am, pondering whether sleeping for four hours and waking up without nightmares is better than sleeping for eight and waking up several times with nightmares only to go back to sleep.  Sounds like a catch-22, doesn't it?  (And even though this is a popular simile, it's that much more appropriate with me having been dubbed a cinephile.  And yes, I  know  it was a book first, but the movie made the phrase popular, didn't it?)  So another way to spend the time is to work on the blog, and to work on whatever school has in store for me.  Like "yesterday" (Friday evening) David and I worked on re-writes and some add-thinks (I don't want to call them re-thinks: that's what got me into trouble the last time we tried cooperating on a project) for the short, and I will update both the reading and the shooting script with as much of them as I can decypher.  David is a brilliant writer, though he often scoffs at that idea, and when we can get through our mutual insecurities, we collaborate very well.  Something else I just noticed is that time has a very strange flow at night.  Only ten-fifteen minutes ago I went downstairs for a glass of water (I try not to drink water directly out of the tap: it's never cold enough for me, and I like the idea of it being filtered by my trusty Britta), and the clock on the stove showed 2:35.  When I went for another glass ten minutes later, the clock was showing 3:37.  No, there is nothing wrong with the clocks on either the stove or the microwave, it's my sense of time at night.  It seems weirdly compressed, and I bet in another 10-15 minutes it'll be 6 AM and light outside.  By the way, besides my mother, Chaz, and occasionally David, I doubt anyone reads these musings, so I tend to put into them whatever comes to mind.  I've been encouraging my therapist to read them, and she keeps telling me she will, one day.  I bet you, however, it won't be in the fifteen minutes between 2:35 and 3:37.

      David and I often have conversations about the notion of free consulting.  The consulting can be anything from telling a hotel how they could improve their customer service (in a constructive way; not when we are really upset, like we were in Paris at  Prince de Galles ), to making suggestions to companies how they can improve their products or services that would increase their revenue or profit margin, to just providing knowledge to someone who asks because either David or I know something about the subject.  This is a common theme for us, and I thought I'd try and put my ideas about it into an article, to help me decide what to do in a couple of situations that have crept up recently.  So, what are the pros?  In most of these situations, whoever is receiving this free consulting is happy to get it.  Not to brag or anything but David and I are both intelligent, and we tend to understand complex processes pretty quickly.  Back in the Rooters days when we used to go around the world teaching the sales force how to sell solutions instead of what they were doing, David would often challenge the group by saying, "Ask [Leo]  any  question about it.  I dare you to try to ask one he can't answer."  And it was very nice to feel positive reinforcement not only from David, but from those few who'd tried to stump me.  I often tell people, "Ask David about [insert volatile, emotional, or personal situation]."  I would bet with them that he would always find an answer that was real, and maybe even so innovative that it would open people's eyes about themselves.  His skills at understanding people, and deal with them compassionately (as long as they don't continually hurt him) are unmatched, and that includes mental healthcare professionals I've known.  So, yes, it's nice, in the immortal words of the Church Lady to feel a little bit superior.  Yet David continues to caution me from freely offering my consulting services to others, especially when I do not expect to receive anything (whether material or not) for those services, save the positive reinforcement.  On the one hand that feels greedy.  But on the other hand, he does have a point: here I can help, say, a software company to create a significant leap in their product development, but what do I get out of it?  And besides, people often feel that if they haven't paid for something, it can't be that good (the "you get what you pay for" mentality).  So while I might give the best advice possible to the company, someone may reject it precisely because it came from me, rather than an android (the old term for Andersen Consulting drones).  And yet I continue to get myself into these situations where I end up giving free consulting and getting nothing for it.  What's driving that?  I suspect that my need for approval, this hunger for positive reinforcement, is so strong that it overrides all the cautious notions that David brings up.  And while I sit with him and talk about it, I clearly see his point, but (particularly if I am feeling down) I continue to offer free consulting, just so someone can recognize that I am good at something.  During my last group therapy session I pointed out that what I strive for is to be able to achieve that praise and that acknowledgement of the fact that I am good at things from the inside.  That's where I'd  like  it to come from, and not from individuals who may or may not care to give it.  The group leader pointed out that this notion is the basis of all therapy.  I wonder if I will ever get there.  I wonder if I will ever recognize the value of what I offer freely, and feel good enough that I can offer it for trade (not necessarily for money; David's point is that I should get something of value out of it, and money isn't always the measure of value).  In essence, I wonder if I will ever stop craving approval from strangers.  Approval from people who know me just doesn't give the same endorphin boost.  And isn't that a kick in the rubber parts, as Harvey Fierstein used to say?

      In one of my earlier musings I mentioned that I dressed to the sevens.  I am sure that anyone who reads this is familiar with the expression " Dressing to the Nines ," so you may ask, what in the world does he mean with this "Sevens" stuff.  The story of my clothing education is long and covered in patches.  I learned as I went along, and sometimes made not-so-clever choices.  I still remember, when I was 15 or 16, getting my parents to buy me a black silk shirt.  What I hadn't realized at the time was that it only looked good on you with a while suit and tie, and if you were John Gotti.  But then, my education in clothing in the Soviet Union consisted of my then-best friend, the one with whom I had a long-term relationship, trying to explain the difference between Levi's orange, purple, and red labels on the jeans pockets.  I've since forgotten what it was, and since Levi's never fit me very well, it doesn't matter.  My initial choices in suits weren't bad.  When I needed a suit to go to a wedding of my parents' best friends' daughter, I went for a blue double-breasted pin-stripe suit, with a double pin stripe of light blue and yellow.  I looked damned good in it, too!  When I moved to LA, and discovered trendy fashion, I spent a lot of money trying to buy into it.  The stuff never fit very well (if you know me, you know I've been overweight since I was four), and it wasn't necessarily of the best quality.  While working for companies that did not require me to dress up, I didn't really care, but then came the Inference days.  I had just opened an account at Needless Mark-up (Neiman Marcus to everyone else), and struck a lust/cordial relationship with a sales guy there.  Needless to say, my timid pursuit of him didn't get me very far, but he did introduce me to Brioni.  When it comes to clothes off the rack, Brioni is probably the world's best in making men's suits, and in spurts, men's ties.  I still lament the end of life of my first Brioni suit: it was dark blue, but with a touch of purple in it, and made of wool that felt like silk.  It became my power suit.  As I started spending time in London, I learned about other design houses, and for a while was one of Zegna's big customers.  I even had Zegna, and later Armani, do made-to-measure clothes for me.  But even the made-to-measure stuff, after multiple fittings and re-fittings just did not look right.  So when I moved to Australia, and needed to fix a few of the suits (because they were beginning to look ridiculous on me), I looked around for a place that would do it.  A very well-known retailer of fine men's clothing haughtily declined to help: they only modified suits bought from them.  So, in my despair, I looked elsewhere.  Around the corner from the TIBCO Sydney office was a little shop with a Brioni logo, called john Cutler.  I walked in there one day and asked, somewhat timidly, if they could do something about making my suits fit better.  John, and his then-partner Karl agreed to take a stab at it, constanly warning me that they couldn't perform miracles.  But they did manage to make me look less ridiculous.  Throughout the process of them re-fitting eight suits, Karl, ever the sales guy, kept suggesting that I should just have a suit made by John and Karl from scratch, just to see what they can do for me.  And one day, with options looking like they would bring me some money, and having a bit of extra funds, I took them up on it.  The result was my first Cutler suit, a black flat wool single button suit.  Suffice it to say, when I wore it to the office for the first time,  everyone  commented.  And that was it.  I was hooked.  Over a period of two years, I threw away all my designer suits, and all my designer shirts.  John and Karl kept making more suits for me (a blue one, a brown one, a charcoal one), and shirts that fit beautifully, and, unlike the Donna Karan ones, looked  precisely  how I wanted them to look.  And then we started exploring.  Early in 1999 I was in Tokyo with a friend at a department store that had a Gaultier made-to-measure book, and I sneaked a couple of digital photos of an incredible design: double-breasted eight-on-four.  I came with it to John and Karl, and the result was the first of the wild suits they created for me.  It even had the little Gaultier hook on the back, but it was far beyond the Gaultier design.  It was imaginative, it helped me look slimmer (through some tricks in the fabric), and I absolutely loved it.  If you are interested in what it looks like, the picture in my profile features me in that suit.  Other "named" suits followed: the Chairman Mao suit (I was going to Beijing, and wanted a light suit, and we picked a wool that was exactly the color of Mao's standard suit; and yes, they noticed it in China!); the Salvador Dali suits (three suits made from materials designed by Salvador Dali, in three different styles), that were a hit at a big show Reuters put up, and so on.  We created suits that were interesting, and we began to experiment.  I decided I wanted a cashmere jacket I could wear for flights, but I wanted an extra touch.  So John suggested that we use sterling silver buttons etched with my initials.  I thought that'd be too pretentious (coming from me, think about it!), and instead designed a logo.  Also around this time, we were discussing how they were labelling my suits on the inside.  Bespoke clothing usually comes with the label of the customer's name, and the date the garment was initiated.  For the first few suits, John would put "Leo Belyaev, Esq."  One day I said to John, "You know, that doesn't apply to me: I am not a lawyer, nor do I own any land, so how about something different?"  After two days of careful consideration, I had it.  From that point on, my clothes were labelled "Leo Belyaev, QFL."  QFL, you may ask?  Well, when I thought I was rich, I wanted to start a foundation to help gay teens, and give scholarship to gay students at one of my  alma maters .  The foundation had to have a name, and it became the QFL foundation.  In my will, if it's not formed, and if any assets are left, the bulk of the assets will go into forming the foundation.  QFL stands for Queen For Life.  A former acquaintance, who called herself the Texan Princess, once told me that she believes that I am definitely the true Queen, and all these others are princesses until I pass the crown.  So, Queen For Life became both the name of the foundation, and the initials on the labels of my clothing made by John.  But John went one step further.  For the "specialty" suits and jackets, he would also get a sterling silver coat hook (instead of one made from the same cloth as the lining), and had it engraved QFL.  So the club jackets I have (black, grey, and navy) all have the logo (a triangle with a stylized crown inside it) and the silver coat hooks at the neck.  I feel very special every time I wear them.  We created other suits.  The Doctor Evil suit (if Doctor Evil had a tailor who is one of the top three in the world, and had taste).  The three Dali suits.  The Paul Smith-style suit that leaves Paul Smith in the dust.  Several casual suits.  Finally, I had an idea: something so light and unstructured that I could feel totally comfortable in it flying into Singapore (meaning 30 degrees C/95 degrees F at night, with at least 90% humidity).  John rose to the challenge, and created the first unstructured linen suit (I now have two of them, one in olive green, and one in a rich navy blue).  But since these suits aren't structured, and the jackets can easily be mistaken for shirts, plus I always wear them with a t-shirt underneath them, when I wear them, even with some spectacular jewellery, I call it dressing to the sevens.  Dressing to the Nines for me is wearing one of John's specialty suits, one of his dress shirts, and a tie from my rather extensive collection (which includes just about every tie created by Lacroix, and most of the ones done by Vivienne Westwood).  I always wear cufflinks, from semi-conservative to glaringly outrageous (ask me about the ones that my friend Frances forbade me to wear to the office!), and every suit has its own pair of Trafalgar single-layer weave silk suspenders.  With shoes to match (usually from Berluti), I feel I am dressed to the nines.  Otherwise, it's the sevens, or the ones (my standard t-shirt and jeans look I've adopted this century).  Why am I telling all this?  I am so proud of John's talents, and his creations, that whenever I meet someone who appreciates fine clothing, i always take them to my "dress" closet (as opposed to the casual closet) and show off the suits.  I have yet to find someone who was unimpressed by at least a few of the suits, and certainly by the ties and the cufflinks.  This clothing used to be my protective shell.  And when I wore one of the Dali suits when I was playing Richard Roma, it seemed to infuse me with the power I feel whenever I wear John's beautiful creations.  I feel I can accomplish anything, consult to anyone, sell anything when I am dressed in these suits.  Conversely, when I am in my jeans and t-shirt, I feel exposed.  The suit of armor is a very real thing for me.  It's not made of metal, but it gives me the same feeling it must have given the medieval knights in their suit of armor.  Except I feel I can move as freely in my armor as Heath Ledger did in  A Knight's Tale .  Now, if only I looked like Heath Ledger in  A Knight's Tale ...  Maybe I wouldn't need the armor of the suit anymore to feel protected.

      The other day my mother suggested (not insisted, simply asked) that I tone down the language when I talk about the subhuman elements of US politics (i.e., the current administration, and the vast majority of the Republican party).  Mind you, I don't necessarily class  all  Republicans in that bucket.  For example, John McCain's statement denouncing the TV ad attacking Kerry's Vietnam record was laudable to say the least.  It's too bad that he didn't take the further step, like another of his colleagues from Vermont, and left the party altogether.  In fact, Jon Stewart's imitation of McCain mumbling that he still supports the "I'm with Stupid" ticket (and we know that it's tricky Dicky the Second, Cheney, who is wearing  that  t-shirt), brough the point home that not all Republicans appreciate the Karl Rove smear campaign tactic.  What was even better during the same show (Monday, 9 August 2004) was while Bubba was on  The Daily Show  pushing his book,  My Life , he let it be known that the  same group  of so-called  patriots  smeared McCain in the 2000 campaign, and McCain, to his own detriment, I believe, didn't fight back.  So back to communication style.  Yes, I call that junta all kinds of nasty names.  Yes, I use crude language when I describe the despicable things they are doing (only today they gave El Paso Energy the ability to drill in a National Park, and the story was buried).  It all sounds angry, and it certainly is.  For many years I was convinced that the only emotion I could experience was anger.  Now, having gone through therapy with Jeffery, and working with Caroline, I am getting closer and closer to discovering who and what I am.  I felt I was not allowed to feel anything else for most of my life, so I kept the anger inside until it boiled over.  If anyone who knew me during the TIBCO days (especially the first six years of it) is reading this, you would certainly remember me storming around the building in a rage, calling someone a "fucking waste of space" at the top of my lungs.  Not that everyone who worked for the company was perfect, hardly so, but the outbursts caused considerable difficulties in my career advancement, and ruthless people, like Fat Boy Fahmy were able to take advantage of it, and smear me further.  I mean, if someone is known to be a loose cannon inside the company, wouldn't it make sense that this person was a loose cannon with clients?  The TIBCO debacle would take more than one article to describe, and I might even write a few articles about some of Rooters' (my name for Reuters, the so-called owners of TIBCO at the time) dirty laundry (I intentionally did not sign their severance agreement and had to forego a substantial severance package because I didn't want to be gagged about telling the truth about the scum that worked, and maybe even still work, there).  Bottom line is, this blog is my way of expressing my anger and other emotions and not letting them fester.  If anyone who reads this is offended by what I say, you've got two choices: don't read the blog, or write me and tell me what specifically offends you.  I can understand my mother's intention: she is only trying to do what she believes is best for me (she's been doing it all her life, though I disagreed, and still do with some of those choices).  I take her suggestion not as a criticism, but as an expression of that love.  On the other hand, I know what it's like to live with anger festering inside me.  Besides, I suspect that the only people who read the blog regularly are my mother and Charles.  And that is  OK .  This blog is for me.  When my dear friend Greg gave me a diary-like book so I would start writing, whatever it is I may write, I took his suggestion in spirit.  Anyone who has seen my handwriting when I write quickly knows how deplorable it can be, and besides, for many years writing long-hand seemed intimidating.  I did it for a while when I was working with Jeffrey, but eventually stopped, because it felt uncomfortable.  It felt like a chore.  On the other hand, I can type a lot faster than I write.  I generally compose these entries as I write them, almost in a stream-of-consciousness mode (which is the main reason I end up with all these parenthetical remarks).  So when I write about yet another outrage committed by that junta known as the 43rd presidential administration, I use specific language.  I will be the first to give credit where credit is due: the pig shit metaphor is borrowed from Al Franken's  Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right .  Anyone with a shred of decency who calls him/herself a Republican (yes, I know, there are only three or four of you, besides John McCain) should at least read the book and see for themselves what Franken is talking about.  I will be forever grateful to him for the chapter on pig shit geysers, among other things I learned from that book.  So, most likely, I will continue to use strong language and call the bastards what they are.  As for my mother, I appreciate her concern for me, and I love her very much, but, since we agreed back at the Penn Mar jail that we can agree to disagree, I think this is one of those times.  I suspect that if I was living in the US during the Tricky Dicky the First administration (remember him, the putz that authorized, and then tried to cover up Watergate?), I'd be using strong language as well.  Bubba was very eloquent, which he generally is: if the people think, Democrats always win.  So, the question I have for Terry McAuliffe and the rest of the DNC is, when are you going to start  educating  the people in the "red" states, and when are you going to start fighting back?  It's another form of communication that must happen in this country, and unfortunately, with the stranglehold that the right wing has on the majority of the news outlets (thank god for NPR!), I cannot see a way for this to happen without spending a lot of party's money to run ads that tell it like it is.  Al Sharpton did it.  Bubba did it.  It's time for the DNC to do it too.  Get off your asses, guys!

      When I switched to the Apple platform, I knew that I couldn't stand dealing with Microsoft's buggy, unreliable, badly-designed operating systems.  Mind you, (at least for compatibility purposes) I still use Microsoft Office, but that's about it from Redmond from me.  When I switched, David gave me a bit of a hard time from time to time, particularly when I'd update something, and something else would break.  I was so convinced that having a Unix kernel under Mac OS X I would never experience serious problems, that I resented it.  I treated the computer as an appliance: you turn it on and it  works , no maybes, not reboots every few hours, and no non-deterministic behavior as one got with Windows 95, 98, etc...  Well, I am beginning to understand the value of non-absolute (black & white) thinking (look at my Distorted Thinking article for more details).  While the Mac platform is infinitely better in most ways, when it breaks, though, it *really* breaks.  I am sitting in a Starbucks, waiting for my last candidate for one of the roles in the short (filming on the 4th and showing on the 14th of September!).  As soon as I am done with him, I am off to the Apple store to demand they diagnose this thing properly.  Its previous serious crash (when I was at the beginning of my trip around the world in January/February/March) resulted in me having to wipe the disk and start from scratch.  And since I didn't have most of my application CDs, I was stuck with the minimum.  I survived.  Now, however, we are getting to the point that I can no longer just brush it off.  This morning, while I tried to repair disk problems on the machine, it started some particularly obnoxious behavior: it started spitting out the disks I'd insert.  For those not familiar with Macs, that means you cannot even diagnose hardware problems.  You cannot re-install to try to fix the problem.  You cannot even back up, unless you do that to the network.  Having learned from my last experience, I won't be losing any data.  I will lose about a day re-installing a whole bunch of software, and of course, I've been in a pretty heightened anxiety state, since this machine is my work-horse.  It goes everywhere with me, I do all my film-related activities on it, and in some ways, it's my security blanket.  When I feel I need to go out and be among people, my standard M.O. is to bring the laptop to a Starbucks (no, I don't drink their coffee!), surf the net, write blogs (as I am doing now), or do whatever else may come to mind.  And losing one's security blanket, even for a few days, and even at the age of 39, is very scary.  So here I am, hoping one of the Apple Geniuses at the store will wave a magic wand over the machine and make it all better.  I don't resent the waste of time I predict as much as how I keep taking these (in objective view) minor things and escalate them (inside my head and my body) to crises.  As though I haven't had enough crises lately.

      Isn't it amazing how the hatred of that worthless piece of crud that calls itself the President of the United States polarizes even those who haven't been involved in politics?  Case in point (David suggested that my phrasing "case and point" is simply due to my bad hearing!):  I read a great story today about Bruce Springsteen going out on a tour aimed at clearing Dubya out of the White House.  This is a man who repeatedly refused to either take a public stand, or even let his music be used by either of the parties.  And yet, even he cannot stand by and watch our country destroyed by four more years of pig shit geysers, politically-motivated wars (Chow En Lai was right, after all, war  is  the ultimate failure of politics!), and robbing the country blind so that the rich and the  favored corporations could get richer.  Has anyone looked at the Forbes companies lists?  Some companies that claim they need to cut costs are showing  profits  in the  billions  of dollars.  Sure, that's great for the haves, and even better for the "have mores," as that piece of ignonimity referred to them, right before declaring that he calls them his base.  When the Republican slime machine trashes  Farenheit 9/11 , they conveniently forget that some of the most damning material in it comes from the moron's own mouth.  It's not like he didn't say those things, they plead, it's that they have been taken out of context.  In what kind of context could you possibly accept his claim that the richest people in the country are his base, while wearing tails and a white tie, is just not what he meant?  Yesterday I heard (so far, unsubstantiated) rumors that he is on lots and lots of medication, and that professors at Harvard Medical School have been examining footage of him rubbing his palms together when he was anticipating the attack on Iraq.  The rumor further indicates that he's been diagnosed with megalomania.   Quel surprise !!!  With all this energy, with the country more polarized (I suspect) than even during the Civil War,  I still feel pessimistic: he stole one election, so what's to prevent him from stealing another?  Do the Democrats and the rest of us who just want to get him out of office believe he will take it all lying down?  If I were Oliver Stone, I'd be theorizing about possible martial law situation right before or right after the election, should the results look like they are going against him.  Call me a pessimist.  But I no longer trust even the election process in this country.

      ... I want a new drug.  My first acting experience had an almost drug-like effect.  There I was, playing this snake, this despicable character, and loving every second of it.  Mind you, it didn't hurt when everyone applauded my performance (but the external reinforcement is not very reliable).  But now I understand Big Jack's comment to Rob Reiner in the "You can't handle the truth" scene.  When filming it, Rob asked Jack if he wanted to save his performance while the crew did coverage (Jack requested to be filmed last).  The answer, as Rob Reiner relates on the Director's Commentary, is precious in its truthfullness: Nicholson told him that he loved his work so much that he would do it over and over and over again at that same intensity just because he loved acting.  While sitting in my chair and trying to convince the reluctant James Lingh that I (as Richard Roma) am what he wants to be, I could have continued doing it for the entire day.  The lights, the crew, the cheesiness of the set dressing, nothing mattered.  It was the incredible high of giving a performance, and of being good at it.  Yes, people told me later that I was very good, and in fact applauded after a few of the takes, but I felt it as I was doing it.  I knew the character, I could submerge myself in him, and I would do it for as long as there was video tape, and electricity for the lights available.  Being hard on myself probably does not come as a surprise to many of you.  What  may  surprise you is that when I walked out of the shooting room for lunch, I thought to myself, "I was good!", without adding my more standard, "wasn't I?"  By the time I got home, of course, I tried to diminish the experience to myself and when I related it to David.  I thought it'd be bragging if I said directly, "Hey, I was awesome today!", so I did diminish it, and thankfully, David called me on it.  It led to a two-hour discussion of capabilities and disappointments we've both suffered over the last few months, and (while I cannot speak for him) I went to sleep feeling much more level: neither "high" on being good, nor "down on myself" and dismissing it as a fluke.  Besides Jeffrey and Caroline,  David is a  very  good therapist, even when he is feeling down, like he was yesterday.  I cherish him for that, among other things.
