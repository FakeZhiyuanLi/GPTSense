      So yeah, another blog for me, but apart from my personal blog and my writing blog, this blog will be dedicated to my music, specifically, my re-entry into DJing electronic music. So it will contain my observations about my mixing, links to streams of mixes, reviews of music and shows and just general ranting at the techno scene in general.  So that's what it's all about.

          Laptop mixing       Pro: Can take your music with you.     Con: Just not as sexy as mixing with decks.    Pro: Can take effects with you without any fancy equipment.    Con: Just not as sexy as decks.    Pro: Can just whip it out and have a huge rave up on the go.    Con: Lack of sexiness compared to decks.

      Like many of the albums coming out of Kompakt these days, this is a mixed bag. Brought out to celebrate 100 releases on the label,  100  is a collection of Kompakt tracks remixed and reimagined by a number of artists. Tracks are reimagined so that an electropop track because a thumping psy-trance mix and vice versa. For the most part, this works. More often than not, however, it doesn't as we shall soon see.  There are some really tight tracks on this two CD set. "Zu Dicht Dran" and "The World is Crazy" are two tracks that I can see tearing up the dance floor. Both contain breaks that leave you hanging, begging for release. I like being tortured by a producer like that. As a DJ, mixing it is a dream. You control those meat puppets on the floor, and leaving them hanging before you slam it down is perhaps the most vile and fantastic things you can do.   The names on the tracklist read like a who's-who of Kompakt artists and generally good electronic music artists in general. Michael Mayer, Reinhard Voigt, SCSI-9 - just reading the list makes me want to love the album, but not even they can save it from two big problems that I see.  The first problem is the ungodly amount of triplets used. This isn't so bad if you're listening to it or if you're an experienced DJ. However for someone such as myself, mixing triplets is bloody well annoying. It's really freakin' hard to beatmatch triplets. Give me some double kickdrum Rotterdam Gabber over this. That I can mix, but triplets? FEH! This love of triplets is something that I blame solely upon the next reason.  The majorit of this album is ElectroPop. Kompakt regrettably have been puitting out more and more ElectroPop the past few years. This isn't too bad if it didn't rely heavily on triplets. Or if German ElectroPop didn't sound so harsh and non-melodic. I love the German language, it truly is a beautiful language, but really, it isn't really meant to be sung by some guy with a bad falsetto over a bunch of triplets. Myself, I know it doesn't make me want to get up and boogie. More like sit in the corner moping, whilst smoking a pack of Galoise in my black turtleneck and beret, and my Robert Bourassa glasses. Vox is ok in small amounts in techno tracks. Remember Acid House? It was mandatory along with the Acid breaks and synths. However a full track with out-of-tune singing over ElectroPop is not my idea of a Fun Time. Out of the entire track listing, I think "Weiche Zaune" is the worse culprit. At least this is the track that I go into a catatonic state over.  All of this aside, this really is a good release. Not the best that I've heard in a while, but it is a keeper if not for the retrospective element. The reimagining of the tracks is quite great and a welcome departure from the usual "let's just release the most popular and/or annoying tracks of the past 20 years so people can listen to them AGAIN!" schtick.  If you are interested in the direction German techno is going, then this is a great release. If you fear triplets while mixing, but are willing to give them a try, then it's good too.  7 out of 10 laptops  Choice tracks:   urlLink Zu Dicht Dran / (Reinhard Voigt) - DJ Koze   urlLink Teaser / (Lawrence) - SCSI 9   urlLink The World Is Crazy / (Schaeben & Voss) - JÃ¼rgen Paape   urlLink Dicht Dran/ (Schaeben & Voss) - Schaeben & Voss
