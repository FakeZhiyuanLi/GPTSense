         My dad said I can't go anywhere anymore, even though I am ungrounded for the week. It's stupid because he wants me to get ungrounded but he's not helping me! It's very dumb. Yesterday I went to the mall with Brittney, James, Miguel, and Daniel. Those guys crack me up! I got a shirt and a keychain that both explain a lot. I also got my ticket for  Warped Tour  yesterday. Which means I need to find a ride. Well, I might have a ride but I'm not so sure Chante would be the nicest person to me. She's riding with Tim and so is Brittney. Tim thought I wasn't going so he offered his friend Joe a ride, but Joe might not go. If Joe doesn't go, then I'm going with them.  I don't know if I can take anymore of Chantes bullshit. First, she posted a blog about me and Brittney and how we start drama and deleted us off of her friends. Brittney flipped out and wrote her a long note telling her that  WE  (me  AND  Brittney) were just joking around with her. Then Chante, being the moron that she is, added Brittney as a friend again and not me! To top it off, she apologizes by saying "SORRY DUDE S " but blocks me as a person! That's just messed up! Now she expects me to beg her for forgiveness! I don't need that or her! EWWW! Now I'm all angry again!

          Well, I got up at 7:30 because I couldn't sleep anymore. Then I got on the computer to play on it because that's all I can do for now. I am actually working on my website. That will be up and running as soon as I can finish that. I really don't have any plans for today although I do have Young Women's. Oh yeah, Ike is supposed to call me. He calls me everyday. Today he wants to hang out with me but I have Young Women's. Then tomorrow I'm going shopping with my brother because he still owes me (my birthday was on Saturday so he owes me  REALLY  big). So I probably won't hang out with him for a while.  Bobby is supposed to call me on Wednesday or Thursday to hang out "hardcore". Eric wants to chill like "villains" sometime this week. Tasha is supposed to be calling Thursday or Friday to hang out because she just got here from Oregon. My mom wants me to go cleaning houses with her on Thursday. My whole week is going to be pretty busy. I was going to go to  Warped Tour  but I decided I don't want to go because I'm not going to spend $27.50 to see a couple of bands play. I guess this it for now. I shall be back tomorrow to post (at least I will try).

        Oh my goodness am I lazy or what? Yes, I have been busy, but not too busy to write in this thing. Well, let us start:   1 .  Warped Tour  was awesome. I saw a lot of people which include my crush. We saw a couple of bands together and we talked a lot. I got to see  Yellowcard  with him. They are my all time favorite band and we sang all of their songs together. It was so  amazing .   2 . This holiday weekend, I found out that I am getting ungrounded in 3 weeks for sure. Also I went to Brittney's for a famous sleepover with Rachel. We stayed up until  4:30 AM . It wasn't really smart because I had to be up at  7:00 AM  to be at the church for a breakfast. So I got up at  7:15 AM  and Brittney dropped me and Rachel off home. Then me and my family went to the parade, went to a lake, and came home all wet and stinky. Yuck!   3 . Today has been ok. Not too great but I'll survive. For this week coming up I have some plans. First there is Young Men's and Young Women's on the 27th of this month. Then on that same day and the next day are senior and graduation pictures. In August there is registration on the 11th and my sister's birthday on the 22nd and school starting the next day. I hope 3 weeks goes by really fast so I can have some fun for the rest of my boring summer. I'll be back next week I guess   .

           Well lets see a lot has happened since I wrote in this thing. I went to take the pictures at Cyprus on Wednesday and it turned out, that's the day Bobby could hang out! I told Bobby to meet me at Cyprus so we could hang out. So he took me to lunch at Wendys, then we went to his house because he wanted to show me his house. It's a pretty nice house. Then he showed me his  HUGE  backyard. Very nice. Then it was time for me to go home. So he dropped me off and then later that day (or night I guess) I went to see:  Fall Out Boy ,  Bayside ,  Armor For Sleep  and  Name Taken  at the  Venue . It was so awesome!!! I love every minute of it!  I get ungrounded in one week from today! How exciting is that?  VERY ! Well, my uncle from New Mexico might be coming on Wednesday so that will make the week go by faster. Ummmmmmmm......on  Friday the 13th  there is a show at the Zipcode (in Magna) and Chris Suitt's band ( Apollo Collage ) is going to be playing!   Friday the 13th .....what a day. 7 months ago me and Tim went on a group date. On  Friday the 13th . That's crazy that 7 months have passed. Well I guess this is it.
