      Well, my first post.  I guess it would be proper for me to start by telling you a little about myself.   I am 23 years old and I work as a tier 2 Technical Support agent, on the third floor of a plain office building.  I'm a    slave    to my   phone   and   keyboard   and I live what's left of my life in a one-bedroom apartment in the richest neighborhood in the   ghetto  .  Okay, it's not quite that bad but it's not great either.  Funny how I feel like a slave to my keyboard during the day, yet I got this crazy idea to start writing online.  I used to write a lot more, I stopped for a long time.  I think I'm realizing that I need something else in my life.  I always felt like I had   more direction   when my head was clear.   I'm    jaded    and tend to lean towards the    negative    side of things, though I generally come around and   rational  ize.  I'm lazy and I love to pro  crastinate  , I am a   pro  fessional at these two traits.  I severely   lack motivation   in some aspects of my life, and    yet    I    excel    in other aspects.  For example, I may put off making a phone call for several weeks yet I will come home on my lunch hour to do dishes and clean up so that I can be lazy when I get home from work.  Oh, one other important thing about myself is that I will   avoid confrontation     at all costs  .  I like to think that I have   immense patience   and that I can keep my cool, though I know that I am slowly   losing   this ability.  I'm generally self-confident, but I have my moments.  To be honest, I've been having a rough time lately.  You see, my best friend recently made a decision to get   married   and   move to the opposite side of the country  .  I guess I should have mentioned that I'm an   only child   and this friend was the closest thing to   a brother   that I'll ever have.  I'm dealing with it   less efficiently   than I had planned, to say the least . . .  On a   positive   note, I have a very   good friend standing by my side  .  She makes   me smile  , and she is a    genuinely good person   .  I   can't say   that I have met too many of   these individuals  , as if I have   wisdom in my 23 years  .  I enjoy being around her, we enjoy many of the same things.  She's had a   very positive   effect on me, more than she probably realizes as she has not known me for very long.  We'll be going to the state fair this weekend, she's   afraid   to go on the   ferris wheel   but I say we're going on it (hope these aren't some of my   last words  ).   I look forward to posting more, I better sign off so I can get some sleep seeing that I have to be to work at   6am  .  Maybe we could meet again    further down the river    . . .
