      I found  urlLink Holy Fools  to be hard to read at times due to the phrasing and language at times, yet the story kept me engrossed.  Once I was used to the writing style, the details took me in and I could almost imagine myself there with the heroine.  It is set mostly in the early 1600s and is the story of a young "gypsy" woman who finds herself pregnant with nowhere else to turn.  Being very resourceful and a thespian by trade, she portrays herself as a young widow and seeks refuge in a convent.  The Abbey that she comes to is comprised of quite irregular nuns.  More of a home for the troubled women than a convent.  Five years later, following the death of the kindly Reverend Mother, she is confronted with her past.  The leader of the troupe that she was in and the father of her daughter has concocted a new scheme to seek revenge on a bishop.  Before long suspicion, betrayal and debauchery are rampant in the convent, fueled by rumors of witchcraft and demonic possessions.  To save the convent and her daughter, she must match wits with her former lover and divert his plans.

      I have loved all of Deborah Smith's books and  urlLink Charming Grace  was no exception.  Grace Vance Bagshaw is a classic character - a 34 year old ex-beauty queen and former talk show host, she now spends her days grieving the death of her husband, Harp Bagshaw.  Grace was the only one who ever truly believed in Harp until he sacrificed his life on the roof of a hospital to a mad bomber bent on blowing up the hospital and every one in it.  Now aging action-movie superstar turned director Stone Senterra invades Dahlonega, Georgia to film the story of Harp Vance’s heroism – over Grace Bagshaw Vance’s dead body.  But to get to Stone, Grace must bypass Boone Noleen, Stone’s sexy Cajun ex-con bodyguard.  And Stone's muscle-bound half-sister, Diamond.  Think pro-wrestler turned movie star.  With a little help from her family, Grace is determined to keep Harp's private life, just that.  But, her family doesn't see it that way and soon the alliances are flying.  Grace and Boone, Boone and Grace's G. Helen (as her grandmother insists on being referred to), Harp's long-lost sister's daughter and Stone's son and a host of other characters.  With plenty of "bless his/her hearts" thrown in this book is the perfect combination of drama and comedy.

       urlLink Seduced by Moonlight  is the third book in the Merry Gentry series.  Merry is a mortal Faerie princess who has been hiding in L.A.  Her aunt, the Queen of Air and Darkness, has ordered her to compete in a contest with her cousin, Cel (who is in the torture hall for trying to have her killed) in making a baby.  Whoever produces a child first wins the throne.  The only qualifier is that Merry can only bed her royal guards and whoever gets her pregnant is to be her king.  But, not being able to get pregnant is one of the least of her worries.  There are those who are still trying to assassinate her, and she is also trying to form an alliance with the Goblin King and there are those who do not wish that to work.  I call Laurell Hamilton's books supernatural porn.  There is a lot of sex and it is fairly graphic and always out of the ordinary.  Combine that with the intrigue and violence and you have a perfect book.

       urlLink Maggie Darling  is very funny and satirical in a low-key sort of way.  Maggie is a Martha Stewart-type goddess of hearth and home where everything is perfect except her picture-perfect life suddenly goes awry.  She is suddenly embroiled in a life of ex-husbands, thieving best friends, flings with younger men, and a son who is haning out with a gansta rap crew - among other such unrefined quandries.  It is delightful the tale of how she has it all, loses it all, and learns how to carry on brilliantly in her strange new situations.

       urlLink Cereal Killer  is the ninth book in the Savannah Reid mystery series.  I love her books because they are all light-hearted and fun, with murder and intrigue thrown in.  Savannah is a Southern transplant to California and there are always cute Southernisms thrown in.  I am looking forward to the next one.

      Today has been kah-ray-zee!  That's what I get for being gone for a week.  So, quick run down of these books I got piled here so I can get them back to the library and pick up my other holds!    urlLink P S, I Love You - Cecelia Ahern  This book is SOOO good!  I've lucked out lately and have been getting some goodies.  This one was both heart-wrenching and funny.  Very moving.  I can't believe that the author is the 22-year-old daughter of the Prime Minister of Ireland.  Very mature writing.  I guess that is the mark of a true novelist, when you can't define them by age.  Anyway, go get this book and read it!  Now!   urlLink What She Wants - Cathy Kelly   Another excellent read.  And another Irish read.  I really enjoyed this one and in a way it was surprising because of the way the point of view keeps switching from one character to another.  Normally I can't stand that because with most authors you aren't ever clear for a bit who is doing the story telling unless it is explicitly noted.  I can't recall if she noted or not who was doing said chapter or whatnot, but I immediately knew which character it was from the tone.  It's a fairly thick book, but moves along quickly.    Ahh.. must take break.  And now that I've had a break I am dead tired. Quick list so I can take them back tomorrow.   urlLink The Goddesses of Kitchen Avenue - Barbara Samuel  Excellent   urlLink Wurst Case Scenario and Frozen Rodeo - Catherine Clark  I was in the Young Adult section looking for some Judy Blume to re-read and found these two and liked the titles so I thought what the heck.  Very cute books that really portray teen angst.  Takes me back a few!   urlLink We'll Always Have Parrots - Donna Andrews  I could NOT finish this book.  Maybe if I had nothing at all left to read I would, but otherwise it hasn't held my interest and I've been trying for over a week.  It's going back unfinished.   urlLink Spitting Feathers - Kelly Harte    Cute enough book.  Don't know that it was worth the $11 I paid for it, so either get it at the library or get it second-hand.   urlLink Lucy's Launderette - Betsy Burke  Very much worth the $11!  Outstanding book.  It's great because I've always wanted to open up something similiar to what they have done, except with books.  I'll keep on dreamin'.   urlLink The Feng Shui Detective - Nury Vittachi  I haven't got past page 9 on this one, but I suspect it's going back unread.  I'm not liking it at all.    urlLink Pretending the Bed is a Raft - Nanci Kincaid  So-so.  I sent it back without finishing it.  Most short story books don't interest me.  Oh, and I read through  urlLink Trading Spaces: Color!  and  urlLink Martha's Vineyard Houses and Gardens .  The Trading Spaces one was ok, was kind of complicated and some of the pictures weren't that great.  The Martha's Vineyard one was beautiful and very informative.  I've always wanted to go there.

      I've been out of town for the last week and haven't had internet access so I am way behind on my posting!  I've got a stack of books sitting here that I've read, a stack waiting to be read and I just picked up 3 more out of the mailbox on the way in!  So, tomorrow I will get busy and get them put up here.

      Luanne Rice is another author who I have read every single novel she has written, and I am never disappointed.   urlLink Dance With Me  is no exception.

      I absolutely LOVE  urlLink Jennifer Crusie .  I've read all of her books.  And I think this one has been my favorite so far.  I did not want this book to end.  I literally want to live the book!  How insane is that?  But seriously this book rocks.   Min Dobbs knows that happily-ever-after is a fairy tale, especially with a man like Cal Morrisey, who asked her to dinner to win a bet. Cal Morrisey knows commitment is impossible, especially with a woman as cranky as Min Dobbs. When they say good-bye at the end of their evening, they cut their losses and agree never to see each other again.  But Fate has other plans, and it's not long before Min and Cal are dealing with meddling friends, wedding cake, a jealous ex-boyfriend, Krispy Kremes, a determined psychologist, chaos theory, a frantic bride, Chicken Marsala, a mutant cat, snow globes, two Mothers-from-Hell, great shoes, and more risky propositions than either of them ever dreamed of including the biggest gamble of all--unconditional love.  (synopsis from  urlLink Jennifer Crusie's awesome website )

      So, remember the  urlLink jackpot ?  Well, most of them are going back.  I read  urlLink Lost & Found ,  urlLink Cooking for Harry , and am slogging through  urlLink We'll Always Have Parrots .  I started  urlLink Jackie by Josie  and couldn't get into it.  Come to find out I have already read  urlLink Lucy Crocker 2.0  and it wasn't that great the first time.  The others I just don't have interest in now.  I hate it when this happens.  Ah well, c'est la vie.  Of course, a lot of it probably has to do with the fact that I did get some new books I had on hold in.  And they were SO GOOD that they spoiled me.  I finished both of them in hours.  I tend to gobble the good ones up.  I'll post their reviews next.  And hope the library has some goodies in for me soon!

       urlLink Lost & Found  was well worth the wait.  I really enjoyed it.  But then I love all of the  urlLink Red Dress Ink  books.  In this novel by Jane Sigaloff, Sam Washington is a control freak lawyer.  On a business trip to New York, her precious diary somehow gets left behind.  What follows is the story of the angst Sam goes through until it is returned, the angst caused by who returns it and the chaos that ensues and how she learns to let go of some of that control.

      Several weeks ago, I read both Savannah Blues and Little Bitty Lies by  urlLink Mary Kay Andrews .  Both books were excellent.  I recommended them to my Mom and she loved them as well.  We were both commenting on the  urlLink Beyond the Grave Chicken Salad  that features in the plot of Little Bitty Lies.  It sounded really good.  So, she was here last week and we decided to whip up a batch.  Oh my goodness, it is soooooo good.  I couldn't stop eating it.  It was bar none the best chicken salad I've ever had.  And I've had a lot!  So, first chance you get go get both of the books and the make you up some of that chicken salad!  (Tip:  We only used 4 pounds of chicken and I thought it could use more dressing.  So, next time I will either use 3 pounds of chicken or if I am making it for a crowd make up some more dressing.  We also left out the nuts and stuff, and divided the salad and only put water chestnuts in half since there is no way I am puttin those nasty things in my mouth!)

      That's what I hit yesterday evening when I went to get some new books to read.  Some days I go in and am lucky to walk out with one or two books.  Some days it's 10 or 12.  And when it's one or two it really sucks because I read fast, like a book a day (sometimes two or three if they are short and I am bored).  I am really thankful for the new online access to the card catalog that our library has because it enables me to seek out books before I even step foot in the library.  That and the hold function allows me to get on the list for new books and not have to wait eons for them.  Yesterday I was able to go to the library all by me onesies since Mom was here to watch the kiddos so I got to do it the old-fashioned way.  I do love wandering the rows.  So, yay me, I have books to read for a while.  I hope they are all good.  I hate when I get books and end up tossing it after a few pages or the first chapter.  At any rate, here is the list:   urlLink Lost and Found - Jane Sigaloff   (I have been waiting months for this one, I had to get it through the interlibrary loan system and it went through 15 before it found it.  They usually come from Dallas since it is the closest "big" library.  This one is from Phoenix.  Maybe I should move there.  Great climate and great books!)   urlLink We'll Always Have Parrots - Donna Andrews   (This is a cute series.)   urlLink The Good Wife Strikes Back - Elizabeth Buchan   (From the author of Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman, which I loved.)    urlLink Jackie by Josie  and  urlLink Lucy Crocker 2.0 - Caroline Preston  (These just sounded good, don't know anything about them.)   urlLink Lilies That Fester and Reap a Wicked Harvest - Janis Harrison   (I saw Reap a Wicked Harvest in the new book section and it caught my eye as I LOVE mysteries and gardening and unfortunately the library only had one other of the series.  I prefer to read the entire series in order.)   urlLink Cooking for Harry: a low-carbohydrate novel - Kay-Marie James   (I saw this one online somewhere and thought it sounded funny.  Everything is low-carb now, even our books!)   urlLink And Now You Can Go - Vendela Vida   (another one on the new book shelves that sounded good)   urlLink Lunch at the Piccadilly - Clyde Edgerton   (Know nothing, the jacket caught my eye)   urlLink A Love Noire - Erica Simone Turnipseed   (Another new one that I had seen something about online and thought I would check out.  Don't know anything yet except the pages I scanned sounded good.)

      I had stopped reading the  urlLink Death on Demand Mysteries  because after the first few they got so ungodly boring I couldn't finish them.  But, the title of this  urlLink 15th installment  and the plot caught my eye (and I didn't have anything else to read today) so I thought I'd give it a whirl.  And I finished it and I actually liked it.  I won't go into details but it was a good book.

       urlLink High Country  is the 12th Anna Pigeon novel.  Anna is pulled from her current station in Mississippi to go undercover in Yosemite National Park's historic Ahwahnee Hotel.  Four young seasonal park workers have turned up missing and extensive searching has returned nothing and Anna is brought in undercover to see what she can learn from her fellow employees.  She finds plenty to be suspicious about from her twenty-something roommates and the irritable head chef in the restaurant where Anna is waitressing in the place of one of the missing girls.  An overheard conversation leads her on an expedition alone into the high country where she finds the source of the mystery and almost loses her life to some city-slicker goons.  But, her will to live and to obtain justice lead her back to the main part of the park where she finds more clues and more trouble and her survival skills are pushed to the limits.  Once again, Nevada Barr has delivered a suspenseful, thought-provoking novel set among beautiful scenery and corrupted people.

       urlLink Don't Tempt Me  is the final book in the Pearl Island Trilogy, and I am kind of sad to see it come to an end.  The characters are all distinct and the setting and the history are great.  Adrian St. Claire is the sexy chef at the Pearl Island B&B, which he and his sisters run.  He is the descendent of the woman whose husband owned the house and her and her lover's ghost can't go on until the treasure that was lost in the cove is recovered.  But, to find the treasure they need help.  Jackie Taylor is the descendent of the lover.  She owns her own "pirate" ship and is more interested in running cruises along the Texas coast than chasing lost booty.  That and she would rather her past not be dredged up. Finally, Jackie is enticed into helping and soon not only do they have something other than treasure hunts and casual flirtation in mind, but they learn the most important lesson of all.

       urlLink The Time Traveler's Wife  was an incredibly thick book, yet the story was so compelling that I read it in one day.  It moved so smoothly, and the concept and characters were so interesting that I could not put it down.  Henry is a Chrono-Displaced Person (CDP), who travels through time involuntarily, usually when very stressed.  Clare first meets him when she is six and he is 36.  He returns regularly throughout her childhood from different times in their shared future. At last, when Clare is twenty and Henry twenty-eight, they meet in his present, and the relationship begins in earnest.   His constant disappearing and reappearing is hard on both of them, yet they are destined to be together and they persevere.

      So... I had this nice long informative post all written up the other night when all of a sudden the power went out and I lost it.  Don't you love it when that happens?  I shall now attempt to recreate it in short form.    urlLink The Saints and Sinners of Okay County - Dayna Dunbar  This is a great retro novel (set in 1976 or so) in small town Oklahoma.  Aletta Honor is pregnant with her fourth child and has no idea where her husband is at the moment.  With a stack of bills to pay, she is getting desperate.  She attempts to set up a kolache stand during the annual Czech Festival but she burns them all and has to settle for peddling lemonade.  After she uses her long hidden psychic powers to save the life of a customer, she decides to put a sign up in the front yard and offer psychic readings from her home.  Town and husbandly drama ensues, but Aletta knows she is doing what she should be doing.  This was a great novel.    Nostalgia rules.  I've been on a teen novel kick lately.  These are all good ones.  urlLink Gingerbread - Rachel Cohn   urlLink All American Girl - Meg Cabot   urlLink The Earth, My Butt, and Other Big Round Things    urlLink Filthy Rich - Dorothy Samuels  Not a teen novel although I did find it in the Young Adult section.  If 34 is now considered young adult... yay!  This was a cute read.   urlLink Meely LaBauve - Ken Wells   I found this book in the Young Adult section at the  urlLink library  but I wouldn't really consider it that genre.  The main character is a 15 year old boy but the subject matter is a little mature.  Of course, it isn't anything I wasn't reading (or doing for that matter) at that age.  It is touted as the Cajun Huck Finn, but I have to disagree there as well.  It is much better!  This is a must read or any age, male or female.     urlLink Can You Keep A Secret - Sophie Kinsella  Yet another gem.  I've been anxiously awaiting her next novel, and this one was well worth the wait.  Funny, charming, witty.  Everything it should be.  I was hooked.  And I have read where the movie rights have already been scooped up.  Although Kate Hudson is set to play the main character and I don't really see her as fitting the part, not that I don't like her but it just isn't her.    urlLink The Breathtaker - Alice Blanchard  This was one wild ride of a book.  Set in Tornado Alley (which is where I live) this murder mystery is an experience.  I love it when a book is in familiar settings, you can learn something from it, and it keeps you hooked.  It took me much longer than usual to figure out whodunit in this one.  I definitely recommend this one.

      Finally finished  urlLink The Solace of Leaving Early .  It started off incredibly slow and I really didn't think I would get past it.  That and I was not liking the main character at all.  About halfway through it started getting better, and by the end of the book I was loving it.  I'm glad it didn't turn out to be a waste of time and effort to read.  It's funny how some authors get better with time and some get worse.   I re-read   urlLink Neil Gaiman's   urlLink The Wolves in the Walls  and  urlLink Coraline .  He is amazing.  A friend has loaned me  urlLink Stardust  to re-read.  I need to scour the used book stores as his are books I need to keep.  I don't often re-read books, so I like to have the ones I love around when the urge strikes.

      I haven't been doing a whole lot of reading lately due to pursuing other pleasurable pastimes.  Maybe I should just start listing the books with a rating system as lazy as I am!  ha!     urlLink So  5 Minutes Ago - Hilary DeVries    This was not as good as it was hyped to be, or as good as I was anticipating it to be.  It wasn't bad by any means, it was just a little too fake at times for me.  But then, we are talking Hollywood here....   urlLink Scottish Girls About Town - 16 Scottish Women  Scottish Girls wasn't as bad as  urlLink Irish Girls About Town , but neither was I very impressed with it.   urlLink Lucky Stars - Jane Heller  Overall, a cute, entertaining read.    And now.. the good stuff!  Ta-da!   urlLink Blessed  Are The Cheesemakers - Sarah-Kate Lynch  Do yourself a favor and RUN - don't walk- out and get this book!  It is one of the best reads I've had in a while, yet not weighty or depressing.  I wanted to hang out at Coolarney House and soak up the magic.  Lynch's writing made me feel as if I were.   urlLink Something Rising (Light and Swift) - Haven Kimmel  This IS the best read I've had in a long while.  It was more "wordy" than I normally like, but in Haven Kimmel's style it made the story.  Pick this one up when you are out getting The Cheesemakers.  You won't be disappointed.   I  picked up  urlLink The Solace of Leaving Early , Kimmel's second novel, yet couldn't really get into it.  I am going to give it another try now.  I'll also have to look for her first one,   urlLink A Girl Named Zippy .  I had a whole pile of other books that were such crap that I won't even go into them.

      It seems to be the trend lately to read a while and then catch up on updating.  Better late than never, eh?  I got a huge stack of books at   urlLink the library  last week, but only a few of them have been able to hold my interest.  The others I have been vacillating back and forth on, a chapter here... a chapter there.  Hopefully the next batch will hold more goodies.   urlLink Emma's Secret - Barbara Taylor Bradford  This was another one that went back unread.  Barbara's books are always very well written, but they are usually too... staid... I guess is the word.  I may check it out again when I am in a different frame of mind.   urlLink Straight Talking - Jane Green  Okay, this book annoyed the hell out of me for the most part.  It was a good book, but it was just too rambling, wishy-washy, whiny and I could not sympathize with the main character at times.  I could in theory on the subject, but I suppose it was just that the other stuff got in the way.  Maybe it was my mood, I don't know, because here lately all of her books have annoyed me on some level.   urlLink Bookends  was the first novel of hers that I read and it was amazing, and I've been somewhat disappointed by all of the others.   urlLink Luck of the Draw - Carolina Garcia-Aguilera  This book was indeed the luck of the draw.  It was outstanding!  Very well written, very engaging.  I shall be checking out all of her other novels ASAP.   urlLink The Cure for Death by Lightning - Gail Anderson-Dargatz  I've seen this book many times at the library but had never checked it out.  I finally picked it up and am glad that I did.  It has some subject matter in it that I am not too fond of reading about (but then who wants to read about horrible reality?) but it was such a great read, and it left the indelible reminder that life happens, it isn't always pretty, but it does go on and you can make it the best it can be.  I loved the realism of the book even if it was harsh.  It was very evocative of the time yet not stuff that is written about a lot.

      I have so many stacks of books sitting around that I sometimes lose track of what is where.  I found two more that I have read in the last couple of weeks that got buried.  Both of them are from  urlLink Red Dress Ink .  The first one is  urlLink Speechless by Yvonne Collins and Sandy Rideout .  There were parts of this book where I didn't really like it but overall it was a good read.  Second up is  urlLink Engaging Men by Lynda Curnyn .  Again, it was just an average book.  Both weren't horrible, but they weren't the best I've ever read.  Speaking of  urlLink Red Dress Ink , I can't wait to order  urlLink Fat Chance by Deborah Blumenthal  and  urlLink Inappropriate Men by Stacey Ballis !

      I have still been trying to keep up with life here.  I'm reading enough, just haven't had time to be online and post what I'm reading.  So, gonna play catch up and keep it short and sweet.     urlLink Die In Plain Sight - Elizabeth Lowell   This is another of the Rarities Unlimited series and as usual is a great read.     urlLink Coastliners - Joanne Harris   Her books are great.  This one was not as good as  urlLink Holy Fools , but it was an enjoyable read.   urlLink Ain't She Sweet - Susan Elizabeth Phillips   I LOVED this book.  Sugar Beth and all of the other characters draw you in to their world and makes you laugh and want to cry along with them.   urlLink Something Real - J.J. Murray   This book went back unread.  I don't know if it was just the mood I was in or I didn't like the writing style, or the character or what.

      What with the broken car, strep throat, pink eye and numerous other lovely things going on around here, I haven't had time or the inclination for doing much reading.  It's times like this that unless the book is superb, it won't hold my attention and give me the satisfaction I want.  After all, isn't that what reading is all about?   My reading list here is going a few weeks back and is very scant.     urlLink Scarecrow - Robin Hathaway  Despite the wholly unoriginal title, this book is great.   urlLink Full Blast - Janet Evanovich and Charlotte Hughes  This one went back to the library unfinished (among others I am just tired of listing the failures but this one was too bad to pass up).  I love Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series, but I haven't liked this collaboration much from the start.  This one was just too cheesy and out there for me to go along with.  I hope her Plum series doesn't start going downhill.   urlLink Sunset Over Chocolate Mountains - Susan Elderkin  Very interesting and different novel.   urlLink Sunshine and Shadow; Broken Dishes - Earlene Fowler  These two made it all worthwhile.  Earlene Fowler and the Benni Harper series are my absolute favorites.  If you are a lover of mystery, quilts, history and art you should definitely check this series out.  I won't go into details on these today as I am a bit feverish and might not be coherent.

      I ordered  urlLink The Dim Sum of All Things by Kim Wong Keltner  through the  urlLink library's  ILL service.  It was a really good chick lit read.  Lindsey is an ABC (American Born Chinese) living in San Francisco and struggling to find herself (basic premise of most of these novels) while working as a receptionist at a vegan mag and wondering what to do with her degree.  Her take on the single life was dead-on regardless of background and I found her take on "Hoarders of All Things Asian" hysterical.  Greige is my new word. Living with her grandmother presents some dating challenges, not to mention sensory ones what with all the Tiger Balm and food aromas mingling.  After a trip to China with her grandmother, things start to fall together for Lindsey and there is the usual happy ending.

      How sweet is blogger now?  We have a bunch of new templates to chose from and comments!  Yay!  I'm grooving on the pink right now and hopefully I won't get tired of it soon since you still lose all of your mods when you change templates.  I've added a blogroll over to the side with some literary linkies.  I hope everyone enjoys the new look and I'm going to try to keep my posts less sporadic.

       urlLink The Other Side of the Story - Marian Keyes  I just love Marian Keyes.  As with all authors I like (and there are plenty), I've read all of her books.  This one isn't my new favorite, but it's a great book.  I highly recommend this one.

       urlLink Best Enemies - Jane Heller  With friends like this, who needs enemies?  But all's well that ends well.  And some more trite sayings.  Cute book, but a little cliche in parts.

      So, since I've been back I've been doing more reading than posting.  I have a fairly long list of books I've finished.  I guess I better get them on here, huh?   urlLink Under the Boardwalk - Carly Phillips  Cute as always, good summer read.   urlLink The Shop on Blossom Street - Debbie Macomber  The writing in this books seemed kind of, I don't know, stilted?  It was a great story, great characters; but, the telling of it was just off.   urlLink Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination - Helen Fielding  Helen has turned out another one that is destined to make a great film.  This book was hilarious.  I can't wait to see if they make it into a movie.   urlLink To Have and To Hold - Jane Green  I haven't been too impressed with Jane's books lately; but, she redeemed herself with this one.  Very well written, funny, poignant.     urlLink My Sister's Keeper - Jodi Picoult  Once again, Jodi has taken a tough subject and make it real for us readers.  This is a heartrending book.  As usual, she put one of those "Oh no she DI'INT" moments in it, that I could have done without, but it's a fantastic novel.   urlLink Queer Eye for the Straight Guy: The Fab 5's Guide to Looking Better, Cooking Better, Dressing Better, Behaving Better and Living Better   These guys are so funny, and they really know there stuff.  If you have a straight guy in your life, go buy him this book.     urlLink Sweet & Crazy - Patty Dann  Exactly what this book is.   urlLink Fat Chance - Deborah Blumenthal  I've been trying to get my hands on this book for ages.  It was well worth the wait.   urlLink The Ocean Between Us - Susan Wiggs  A must-read.  Susan Wiggs is always a sure thing.   urlLink Dumping Billy - Olivia Goldsmith  Hilarious, as usual.  I cannot believe Olivia is gone and we will only have one more of her books.  It's tragic.   urlLink Monday Mourning - Kathy Reichs  Kathy Reichs is another sure thing.  I've read all of her novels and they are the ones that you can't put down until they are through.

      I went back home to Graham for about a week, so I didn't have access to the internet.  I only took a couple of library books with me as I didn't want to have many to keep up with and/or lose.  I read a bushel of Harlequin and Silhouette romance novels.  They aren't bad for occupying the mind for an hour, that's about how long it takes me to read one.  I won't even attempt to list any of them.  So, here are the "real" books I read this last week.   urlLink Men in Kilts - Katie MacAlister  Cute enough, I didn't hurl it across the room in disgust at least.   urlLink The Song Reader - Lisa Tucker  Not at ALL what I expected it to be, but VERY good reading.   urlLink Good Grief - Lolly Winston  I wasn't thinking I would like this book when I first started it, but after I got a chapter or so in and I was snickering aloud, I was hooked until the finish.  Superb read.

       urlLink Goodbye Earl  is the latest installment in the Bad Girl Creek novels.  This is another series that if you haven't read it, do so.  They are fantastic.  All of her books are.  Hank & Chloe was the first one I read, and I've been hooked since.  I think she just gets better with time.

       urlLink R is for Ricochet - Sue Grafton  I think this is my favorite Kinsey Millhone novel so far.  There were a few there that I wasn't too fond of the plot or the writing.  They had became kind of lackluster.  But this one was much improved.

      I'm just laaazzyy.      urlLink Judith Van Gieson - Land of Burning Heat   and  urlLink The Shadow of Venus    The more I read of Judith Van Gieson, the more I like her. I love books where you can be entertained and learn things at the same time. And this series of full of history, art and the character of humans.      urlLink The Second Assistant: A tale from the bottom of the Hollywood ladder. - Clare Naylor & Mimi Hare    This was another one of those lucky finds.  I absolutely loved this book.      urlLink Flashpoint - Suzanne Brockmann     This was good reading.   The situation was a little unbelievable, but was still a good story.     urlLink Bergdorf Blondes - Plum Sykes     I had read some bad press about this book so I was very interested in reading it. Usually the worse things I hear about something, the more I like it. At first, I thought that they were all right and it was not going to be that great, but after a few chapters it really got going and I loved it.       urlLink Pad Parties: The Guide to Ultra-Entertaining - Matt Maranian    I was looking for his first book,  urlLink Pad: The Guide to Ultra-Living  but this was all our library had.  Fabu!        urlLink Pilates for Wimps - Jennifer DeLuca    My new favorite book. I've already check this out for the library like three times, and I've considered telling them I've lost it and just paying for it so I can keep it. I love Pilates and this is the best how-to book I've found so far.     I've been on an interior decorating book kick really bad lately. Here are a few of them I've read. All good, but the style is only to some people's liking. I like a mix of vintage, country and modern.    urlLink Country Chic - Country Living     urlLink Southern Accents on Color     urlLink Flea Market Finds: Before &amp; After Home Decorating with Makeover Miracles  (another one I want to "lose")

      As I was getting ready to post this I realized that most of the books I have read lately seem to have a common theme.  Death. It certainly wasn't planned that way.  And with the recent death of my grandmother and a few other deaths in the family, I think I've had enough of this theme.  Good books, but not something I want to be reading about constantly.   urlLink The Color of Death - Elizabeth Lowell  Lowell delivers another gem of a book.  (ha, I'm so punny)   urlLink On A Night Like This - Ellen Sussman  This was a great book, if a little farfetched for my tastes.

      This is turning into like the monthly update blog.  Ugh.  I had to go back home unexpectedly (well, not so much unexpectedly as expected just not knowing when) when my Mom called and said my Mamaw was dying.  She's been in poor health for quite some time, and it rapidly declined over about a week and a half.  So, when she called, I threw everything in the car and hauled it up there.  So, what being with her until she passed on, the funeral, and all the stuff after the funeral I was there over a week.  And needless to say, I didn't get much reading done.  I've been too tired to do that much more reading since I've been home.  But, a bunch of the books I've really been looking forward to came in while I was gone, so I've been doing some.  So, enough with the story, on with the books.   urlLink Vanishing Point  and  urlLink Confidence Woman - Judith van Gieson  These are the second and third novels in the Claire Reynier mystery series.   urlLink The Stolen Blue  was the first, which I read a few years ago and then forgot about.  I'm glad I remembered it and went searching for any following novels.  Van Gieson has a great style.  I'm on the hold list for the other two.  Will post when I read them.   urlLink How to Meet Cute Boys - Deanna Kizis   I just happened to spot this on the new books shelf while in the checkout at the library and added it to the pile.  I'm glad I did.  Very entertaining "chick lit".     urlLink Tallulahland - Lynn Messina  It was really hard to read this book and not think "Lady, just STOP!".  I was kind of tired of her attitude towards her father by the end of the book, but I finally forgave her.  All in all, it was a fair read.   urlLink Ten Big Ones - Janet Evanovich  #10 (duh) in the Stephanie Plum series, and fabulous as always.  It's hard to believe Steph's been at it for 10 books now.  And, of course!, the ending leaves you waiting for the next installment.  Hurry up, already!   urlLink The Goodbye Summer - Patricia Gaffney  I just finished this one, and it hit pretty close to home in many ways.  There were also a few of those "Lady, come on!" moments in this one, but this is a great novel.

      you have chicken pot pie for breakfast.  So, yeah, not the greatest day.  I am a comfort eater.  If I am stressed out, depressed, or even happy I eat.  Why can't I be one of those people whose appetite is killed by that kind of stuff???  The rest of the day went as follows:  potato wedges, macaroni & cheese, and a new m-azing candy bar.  And a C2.  Which I love.  I normally can't drink diet sodas.  And while it's true that this one isn't technically diet, it's better than the real thing.  All in all, I suppose what I had today wasn't bad.  It isn't generally WHAT I eat, as HOW MUCH OF IT I eat.  Most times, all that I ate today would have been in ONE sitting.  Add a few more meals like that a day and that's where the weight came back on.  I refuse to get stressed out over it in a big way, because I know that will just set me up for more failure.  I'll be glad this weekend when all of this stuff is out of the house.  When I do my big grocery shopping, I'm not even going to buy junk.  If I don't bring it in, I won't eat it.  Simple as that.  I've just been being incredibly lazy this summer.  It's a good thing I never did get into that swimsuit...  That's okay.  Next summer I will.

      I walk when I can and I do Pilates daily when I am on the wagon.   urlLink Pilates for Wimps by Jennifer DeLuca   is the best book I have found so far.  I love it so much I want to steal it from the library.  I am going to have to find my own copy of it.  There are many, many other Pilates books and videos out there, but so far this is my fave.  I highly recommend it, even for those of you who have tried Pilates before and got your butts kicked. ;)

      1 cup plain basmati rice  1 blueberry muffin  1 grilled cheese sandwich (2 slice bread, 1 slice medium cheddar, olive oil spray)  3 Ball Park franks, 2 slices bread  wee tiny box of organic raisins  Popcorn  Water, water, water    Now...I know, I know. NOT the healthiest menu. But it's better that what I have been cramming in my gullet. It's the end of the month and I will be able to go grocery shopping on the first and plan on going back to the healthy buying style. I will get these 30 pounds off. It just torques me (at myself) that I regained over 10 that I had lost and am now almost having to start over.

        I've struggled with health and weight loss issues all of my life.  This last year, I was finally back on my way to being healthy and I find that I've backslid yet again.    It's easier for me to lose weight if I have to hold myself accountable in small ways.  Weigh-ins, measurements, food diary, etc.  I can't afford to pay to be in a group, so I have to find ways to be my own support group.    That is to be the purpose of this blog.  My own record of progress.  I doubt very seriously that any of you who stumble across this little journal will have any interest in it, but I can always use some moral support and encouraging words.

      I haven't updated in a few days due to being incredibly busy. The oldest two kids came home from their Dad's for a couple of days and then left Sunday for their Mem's house. Nothing special going on with the diet thing yet. I have lost a couple of pounds just from cutting back on the sheer volume of food. I haven't done enough true exercise, but that will come. It is much easier for me to get my exercise when the kids are in school. I am forced (yes, forced. I am NOT a morning person) to get up early, and after dropping them off at school I can go somewhere and go for a walk or come back home and do my Pilates uninterrupted. Or both! It's also easier to eat sensibly as I am much more busy. I went to the grocery store yesterday, and as planned stocked up on healthy stuff. I didn't get as much fruit as I would have liked as most of it was overripe. I'll have to get up early and go to the Farmer's Market and get more. The peaches from Charlie are in their prime this time of the year. MMMMMMMM soo good. I did buy some cookies, but limited them to the very expensive kind. When I buy those, I tend to limit myself to one to prolong the enjoyment. A $5 box of cookies lasts so much longer than a $2 one!

           I have long been fascinated with the idea of the English and their tea.  It seems the whole day revolves around it.  When a pal drops by, when the day is starting, when things go awry as they are prone to do, the instant response of the British is to put on the kettle.  Coming from Texas where iced tea is de rigeur, I was horrified at the thought of drinking my tea hot.  With milk no less.  Lemon, yeah.  But milk?  No way.  I come from a long line of coffee drinkers.  As in pots and pots per day.  I'm not that big on coffee but I can drink gallons of iced tea.  If I do drink coffee it is thoroughly diluted with milk and sugar and flavoring.  Cafe au lait is in my opinion the best way to drink coffee. I just couldn't wrap my mind around the whole hot tea and milk thing.       Several years ago I was in a bookstore/coffeeshop and it was cold out and I was hankering for something hot to sip on.  While perusing the coffee offerings I noticed something called Chai tea.  Hmmmm.. what might that be?  They described it and I thought, as usual...  eewww.  But, for whatever perverse reason, I tried it.  And was instantly hooked.  I finally knew what it was all about.  Coming from a very small town where such exotic things as Chai tea are unheard of I had to lay in stock when in the "big city".  From there I ventured out to try other teas, yes with milk.  And now I know why, when the mind is troubled (or even when it's not)  the benefits of preparing a steaming hot cup of tea and settling down to enjoy it.  Those Brits have been doing it for hundreds of years, seems they were on to something after all.  If you haven't tried it, come on over... the kettle's on.

      I'm tired of having to be strong.   I'm tired of not having a shoulder to lean on. I'm tired of not having anyone to share the load. I'm tired of taking care of everyone else.  I want to be taken care of for a change. I'm tired of not having anyone to say "It's okay, honey.  I'm here to help you.  Let me be strong for a while.  You rest.  I'm here for you when you can't do it and you're there for me when I can't but if we do it together we can handle anything."   I'm tired of carrying the load by myself and there isn't anyone who supports me and my decisions and I don't want to have to fight for everything or go along with their poor decisions.  I want someone who makes good ones.  I want to be able to make a decision and be able to follow through on it without every damn thing going wrong. I'm tired of every single thing having to be such an issue and a struggle.  Just once I want something to come easy and go right.  I want to say "this is what I want" or "this is what I need" and for the answer to be "okay, done".  I don't want to have to fight tooth and nail for simple minor things to be done right.  I realize life isn't perfect and that some things will go wrong but I'm tired of it being everything. I'm tired of being so caught up in the struggle that the love and affection falls to the wayside.  I want to be able to savor the little things and not be overwhelmed by too many big ones.  I want everyone to be happy and for the most part carefree.  The happiness and joy should be the majority, not the minority, buried under all of the strife.   I'm tired of thinking badly of myself when I can't be strong anymore. I'm tired of having to think badly of others when they don't step up and do the right thing. I'm tired of being taunted by what could be, not what is. I'm tired of being tired.

        When the heart just won't cooperate With what the mind says is right. When you're torn apart by the internal fight and you have nowhere left to turn and you don't know where to go... you just have to realize that you're the only one to know. No one else can give you the answers that you are trying to seek and no one can question the answers that you finally meet.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Another time, another place, Another me finding my space. In this life there are many roads The problem is where do they go? You choose a direction, but in the end You find that you just really can't blend.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  You think you finally have your way straight When the road you're traveling on finds another break. It's a never-ending journey with many stops along the way. You think you're going in the right direction, When all of a sudden there's a dead end, detour or a completely different way to go, and you realize you're just not certain you're reading the map right.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I alone have the power  to change the course of my life.  I alone  have the desire to make my life a different one.  I alone am scared to death of what my life has become.  I alone know the dark feelings that course through the jumble of my mind.  I don't want to be alone.

      1. Is your hair naturally curly, wavy, or straight? Long or short?  My hair is straight as a board and sort of medium thick and very fine and silky, not coarse.  Right now it is short, short due to a hair disaster but hey.. it's grown out!    2. How has your hair changed over your lifetime?  The actual hair hasn't changed much over time other than to go from blonde when I was a child, then brown as I got older and now getting a lot of silver.  The texture has always been straight and fine.  As far as styles go?  Gah... it's been everything and every color under the sun.  Long, short, medium, straight, curly, punk, 80s big hair (in Texas no less where bigger is always better and the BIGGER the better), blonde, red, purple, black, you name it my hair has probably been it. Pictures from over the years are always a laugh.   3. How do your normally wear your hair?  On my head?  There is no normal in my world.  The only normal for my hair is clean.   4. If you could change your hair this minute, what would it look like?  It would be long... long, long and slightly wavy.   5. Ever had a hair disaster? What happened?  Since I colored my hair a lot over a span of 20 years there have been a lot of color disasters.  It's been green, orange, mud, etc.  As far as cut disasters, those are no big deal.  It can either be cut more or it can grow.  The only time I was ever really upset about a hair cut to the point I cried I was about 20 and my hair had been long for many years and I let my aunt cut it short and wow.. was it short... less than an inch short.  Of course, I've worn my hair like that a lot the last few years but back then it was very tragic.

      I wonder what it would be like -      Paris in the Springtime. To go upon a brisk, long hike      In Paris in the Springtime.  The flowers there would be in bloom,      A million different colors. The scented air would fill my room,      Plus a very many others.  The couples would walk along arm in arm,      Because this is young love time. The Eiffel Tower bears a special charm,      In Paris in the Springtime.  Sparkling music would fill the air,      Coming from a sidewalk cafe. The happy people would linger there      To while away the day.  It must be a magnificent sight -      Paris in the Springtime. Even to see the smallest bird in flight      In Paris in the Springtime.  Anne Wiley Carr, circa 1962

      1. Name five things in your refrigerator.      Milk, soy milk, cranberry juice, 6 varieties of cheese and apple butter    2. Name five things in your freezer.      Ice, Brussels sprouts, Boston butt pork roast, pie crust, Blue Bunny sugar free Popsicles   3. Name five things under your kitchen sink.      Dishwasher detergent, Windex, trash bags, apple scented Lysol, Pledge    4. Name five things around your computer.      2003 Calendar featuring the 7 Up truck drivers, Pier One candle in glass holder, cup of Pepsi Vanilla, basket of cd's and junk, roll of Charmin (I forgot to get more Kleenex)    5. Name five things in your medicine cabinet.       Almost empty bottle of Wish by Chopard perfume, lip mask and conditioner, 3 different anti-perspirant/deodorants, pearls that need re-stringing, Pond's deep cleanser and make-up remover with cucumber     1. What vehicle do you drive?        '94 Buick Skylark    2. How long have you had it?        Since December of '02 (right after the asshat who ran the stop sign in front of Walmart totaled my Accord)    3. What is the coolest feature on your vehicle?        Uhh.. the a/c?   4. What is the most annoying thing about your vehicle?        THE most annoying??  There are several.  Only 3 of the windows roll down.  The power console on the driver's door is held on by duct tape, as is one of the a/c vents.  The power locks malfunction so I disabled them.  The dashboard almost falls off every time I hit a bump because I need new shocks.  The windshield is scratched up and you can't see out of it.  Well... you get the point.  I didn't buy the car because I wanted it, it was just the only thing available at the time and I had to have something THEN.   5. If money were no object, what vehicle would you be driving right now?      Cadillac Escalade ESV Platinum Edition in White Diamond    Ok, so don't just be nosy... I shared with y'all.

               While I Live Out My Dream     "My office is the cab of a Ford pickup.  I have no employees, punch no time clock and have no set work hours.  The tools of my trade are carried in a bag in the back of my truck and my paycheck depends on my body, the luck of the draw and the will of God.  I am a bookkeeper, a mechanic, a navigator and sometimes a consultant to my many friends.  I am a rodeo cowboy and I wouldn't have it any other way."   As I stand at another rodeo with this hat held over my heart, Cold chills run through my body when our National Anthem starts. I see "Old Glory" waving proudly out there on the arena sand, Held with honor by one of my buddies on a bay pony he understands.  The tears that stream the faces of fellow riders at my side, Send a message of admiration and our unselfish cowboy pride. For like me, they love this Country and stand for all She really means, And I thank God I'm down here with 'em - while I live out my dream.  The Grand Entry now dismisses, then behind the bucking chutes, I search there in my riggin' bag for the spurs that fit my boots. And as I fumble through the memories and the gathered-up supplies, I find a worn old belt buckle that I once wore for second prize.  Winning second wasn't special, but this old buckle is my joy, For it was made by a man named Ruddy - I wore it proudly for his boy. A mile or two it's traveled, now it's shine no longer gleams, But I carry the old buckle for Daddy - while I ride to live my dream.  Years of memories overtake me, and as I hold it in my hand, I think of all the Ruddy buckles that I've seen across this land. Its gold inlay's a message of a craftsman's work of art, Though it rides now with my riggin' - I still wear it on my heart.  In the rubies on each corner I see Mother's sparking eyes, And the reflections of her loving hand each time she waved good-bye. The buckles tarnished silver tells the color of Grandma's hair, I hugged her neck before I left - I'm so proud that she was there.  I now feel a sense of lonely, while I wait my turn to ride, But I know my family's with me in this old buckle by my side. Lord, please watch over all my family and those sisters that I love, Monday is Kayla's birthday - send her something special from above.  My pony's in the bucking chute - soon I'll ride for another eight, But God, finding this old buckle made the time so worth the wait. Lord, should this be my final ride and I depart your Earthly scene, Ride me spurring into Heaven - while I live out my dream.    Written with love for the family of Chad Ruddy, 1975-1999 Lee Wiley Burch October 25, 1999

      Hello, my friend. How are you today? I was thinking of you and thought I'd come by and talk. It's a lovely day. You'd like it. The sun is shining and everything is bright and pretty. I remember these were your favorite days. I brought you some flowers. I hope you like them. I really miss you, you know? I'm sorry you had to leave so soon. I have to go now. But I'll come back again. Good-bye for now.

      I look in your eyes And see all the joy and pain  Of the years we shared. I also catch a glimmer of tears For what you're feeling now.  I want to reach out And catch your hand in mine To tell you I still care. But, I seem to have no control. I'm afraid that if I do You'll see all the feelings That are still there.  Yes, I still love you. But, I feel in my heart That if I don't leave you And go on with my life, All that I have planned Will fall apart.  So, as we are standing  By the gate to my plane, I finally find the courage  To reach out, Although I sway, And lay my hand against your cheek As a final good-bye, Pick up my bags, And walk away.

      I'll admit.  I'm a mom on the edge.  My sanity is goin' south.  Tonight I tried to beat my son to death with the only weapon handy.  What I was holding when I snapped?  A large bag of miniature marshmallows.

      How bout them Cowboys?  Woohoo!  4 and 1, baby.  The boys are back.  The better keep it that way!  I'm glad that our team has been turned around and is doing it the way it should be done.  I've been a fan since I was a little kid and in the last few years I have been so ashamed of the way they've been conducting themselves.  The coaches and the players.  I still supported them, but I wanted to kick them in the shin, too.  I'm proud of the way they have came back and are upholding the fine Texas tradition that is Cowboy's football.

      I am still suffering from the Plague.  I've had many things to say this weekend, just haven't had the clarity of mind to get them down without sounding like any more of a lunatic than I already do.  I have many words for what I think about our so-called medical professionals today.  I could (and have) rant for days about that.  I'll save that for later.  I am so upset by   urlLink this man's whole ordeal  (read the post and work your way forward for the whole story) that I could just spit.  No, I couldn't just spit.  I DO spit!  I spit on all the people who are the cause of things like that.  Not only what he went through in the first place, but the reaction of people to his experience.  Whether or not he is telling the truth, things exactly like that do happen and they happen because the people in this world today are for the most part stupid, selfish, hating, judgmental, trouble-making.... OK I am apparently not going to be able to keep from sinkin to their level right now so I'll save my full thoughts on this for another day.  I'm not up to the whole First, Second and Fifth Amendment debate right now.  Therefore, my attention must go back to where it should be... the football.

      I live in a town of about 100,000.  It's a smallish town in North Central Texas.  A college town.  An Air Force base town.  You would think that it would have a variety of eating establishments and entertainment.  If you did, you would be wrong.  Comparing this town to others of its size, be it state-wide or nation-wide, it is sadly lacking.  It's not a horrible place to live.  I'm just sayin it could be better.  It is better than my hometown, a town of about 10,000.  But, it's not as good as other places.  The housing here is iffy as well.  I was not happy with the last apartment I lived in.  Circa 1970s, hasn't been remodeled since, 6 kids in the apt. upstairs, meth-doin' neighbors, termites in the bathroom.  You'd think it was in a really bad neighborhood or something.  No, it was one of the better neighborhoods here.  The outside was nicely taken care of.  But, not so the inside.  I heard about some brand spankin' new apartments being built so I immediately went and got on the list.  I moved into this apartment complex last year, Halloween to be exact.  I was hoping that since it was new they would be more choosy about who they let in.  How they maintained the property.  You know.... doing things the way they are supposed to be done?  Wrong.  This place is a year old and it is already ghetto.  Oh, it's got the big fancy security gate.  That never works.  It's got the big, fancy office which reportedly has an exercise room and an internet room and a "gathering" room (to hold showers and such).  I've yet to see them.  The buildings are nice.  Brick, good design.  But the lawn is atrocious.  Full of weeds, fire ants and scraps of trash.  The patios and front porches of some of these places are a fire hazard.  Now, there have been about 15 or so places clear out, be it their choosing or eviction.  But, there are at least that many more that need to be.  I cannot imagine why someone would want to move into a nice place and live like trash.  I cannot imagine why the management puts up with it.  (other than some of them are family, how great is that?)  But, enough of the maintenance.  First, let me tell you this.  When they got the security gates funtioning, they sent around a notice that if you wanted a remote you had to pay $XX.XX and $X.XX a month.  They also put up these "carports" (and I use the term loosely) in various parking areas along the fronts of the buildings.  It is expected that if you want one of these parking spaces under the carport that you pay $XX.XX a month for that privilege.  Well, I have parked in the same place since the day I have moved in, due to the arrangement of parking and the number of people that live in my building.  It always worked out fine, we always had our own parking place, and it was sort of an unspoken agreement that we don't take each others place.  After all, we were all close to our doors.  Well, when they put up the said "carports", they took 4 of the 6 spaces in front of my building.  One of them was "my" space.  So, I ask you... should I have to pay to park in that space?  Or should I have to park in another space and fight it out with the neighbors over the available spaces?  Usually forcing either myself or them to park buildings away?  I didn't think so.  On reason being I am technically supposed to have a handicapped parking space, as are my immediate next door neighbors.  That would take up the two parking spaces closest to the doors.  Which are the ones we were parking in before the great "carport" fiasco.  So, I go to the office and register my complaint.  They can either shut up and let me have my parking space back, covered or no, or they can put in 2 handicapped spaces there.  Well, we can't do that, how about you pay us $XX.XX instead of the $XX.XX we want.  My response?  What part of I am not paying to park in front of my own apartment do you not understand?!?  Needless to say, they saw things my way.  (Mentioning N. TX. Rental Association and lawyers help) There are many other issues I have with the management of this place, such as some of the hand-lettered posts on the bulletin board and some of the letters that they send about.  If I were more ambitious and if I thought the people who lived here could be cohesive enough to back me I would start a tenants association.  But, to tell you the truth.... I'm tired of the whole mess so I'll just deal with what immediately affects me and wait for my out.

       Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene  I'm beggin' of you please don't take my man   It flitted through my mind for some reason the other day how much I have always liked Dolly Parton, yet don't listen to her unless she happens to be on the TV or the radio.  Of course, since I don't listen to country radio that doesn't happen.  She was on Jay Leno tonight and it reminded me that I really should start listening to her more.  Anyone who knows me knows that while I am NOT a fan of country music, my tastes are very diverse.  I won't exclude (thanks, D) anyone simply due to the genre of music they are in.  There is country that I like.  I love bluegrass, the blues, gospel and good old rock and roll.   I could go on listing but you get the idea.  Everything from Rachmaninoff to Rammstein.  However, there are many musicians who slip through the cracks of my mind.  Last week, there was a tune niggling at the back of my head.  It teased me and teased me for days on end.  Finally, one night I wracked my brain and finally managed to get hold of it.  It's a great 80s hit that has a timeless appeal.  Go  urlLink here  to check out the tune (click on Sound Library/Video clips) or  urlLink here  for the lyrics to Billy Vera and the Beaters "At This Moment".

       I want my mommy.     I had to go to the doctor today to find out why my hormones and stuff are all out of whack, and of course they had to stick a large, sharp object in my arm and gouge it about.  I've been having some allergy symptoms for the last few days.  As usual this time of year.  I love the change of seasons, but I get sick every time.  And today when I came home from the doc, I could feel it comin on.  The burning lungs.  Flushed skin.  The large object lodged in your throat, quite possibly a tumor.  The coated tongue.  Next thing you know you have a full-blown case of the Plague.   As far back as I can remember, when somebody got sick either my Mamaw or my Momma would cook up a big ol' pot of Pink Soup.  To this day, when I am sick that's what I want.  And when Momma's close enough, that's what I get.  It's a sure-fire cure all.  Sure, I could go in there and cook some myself; but, that isn't the same thing.  I guess I'll go get me a hunk of cheese to go with this whine.

       Yeah... YOU    Where are you? I know you're out there. I just haven't found you yet. Why are you hiding? I've been looking. I just don't know which one is you. Have I overlooked you? There's been many who I thought were you. But, after they had gone I knew. I'm tired of looking now. Where are you?

      A list of 100 things regarding oneself seems to be the blogger thing to do.  So, I figure I better get me one of em started.  Good thing I am a purty good fabricator.  Funny coinkydink, today when I visited  urlLink Jett Superior  her post was about just that... how hard it is to come up with all that stuff about oneself.  Go check it out.  This is going to be an ongoing post.. I'll work on it when I have time or come up with some lies... err facts to post about meself.    A Hunnerd Thangs  1.  I was born Wednesday, July 14, 1971.  2.  Why, yes... I am from Texas!  How did you guess??  3.  I've lived here all my life; but, I have always wanted to move to Louisiana, Mississippi, or points farther South (ok, technically east).    4.  I am not a morning person.  (or afternoon or evening, depending on when I am awakened)    5.  I've been that way since I was a small child.  I would stay up all night and then when my Momma would wake me up to go to school, I'd go into the bathroom and lock the door and fall asleep on the floor.  6.  I have an above average IQ.  But,  when I was in the 5th grade I had the teacher from hell and decided I hated school and was never going to do any good at it.  I somehow managed to succeed at that and yet graduated from high school and went on to take college courses.  My opinion has changed drastically in the following years and I plan to finish my education.  7.  When I was in the 4th grade, I spent a month in the hospital after I had an appendectomy and got a staph infection.  They opened and closed the site four times before finally leaving it open to heal.  I went home with a gaping wound and had to take baths in Tide.  I have a four inch ugly scar to this day.  8.  I got out of the hospital a couple of weeks before Halloween.  That year I went trick or treating dressed as the Fat Farmer.  In my Daddy's overalls stuffed with pillows.  With boots that were too big.  We went in my mom's best friends station wagon with a bunch of kids.  I had to ride in the back and roll out at each stop and then roll back in later down the block.  One stop I didn't roll in fast enough and was almost halfway in and they took off and I was left standing there.  Fortunately, they came back for me.  After a while.  9.  Thanksgiving and Christmas are my favorite holidays now.  10.  My favorite season is Fall.  I love the smell of the air and the turning of the leaves and the cold weather coming on.    11.  Fall means football season!  I love football, have watched it with my Daddy since I was a little girl.    12.  I also got a great love of cars from my Daddy.    13.  I have a big nose, I got that from both sides of the family.  But, it's mine, I'll keep it.   14.  My feet are a size 10 and 1/2.  15.  My eyes are gold around the pupil, blue-green in the middle and a dark blue-grey ring around the outside.  They change color with my emotions.  If they are bright green... watch yourself.  16.  I am tone deaf and can't carry a tune in a bucket; but, I have a great love of music and am very attracted to musically inclined men.  17.  My listening tastes range from classical to thrash metal, touching on everything in between.    18.  I want a man who can sing to me (without me cringing).  19.  I have a long list of what I am looking for in a man.  Yes, written down.  20.  I am a big list-maker.  21.  I am good at losing them.  22.  I love books.  I'll read just about anything I can get my hands on.    23.  I read Gone With the Wind for the first time when I was 13.   24.  And Mandingo.  And many, many other trashy novels.  25.  I want a big ol' Southern house with a library.  Painted red with dark wood. (the library not the house)  26.  I have a real thang for a man with a Southern accent.  (Yes, that is on the list.)  27.  My love for all things Southern goes way back.  I think it was all those bodice-ripping Civil War novels.  28.  I'm a very good cook.  29.  But, not of "haute cuisine".  My specialty is "down home".  30.  The smell of lilacs takes me back "home".  31.  I spent my 21st birthday in Las Vegas.  32.  I ate calamari for the first time in a fancy Italian restaurant there and had an anaphylactic reaction.  33.  I am allergic to numerous things.  Calamari (obviously), Penicillin, Sulfa, Macrodantin, and several other drugs.    34.  When I was about 8 years old we were visiting my Granny Geneva.  She had a large Magnolia tree in her front yard.  I had never seen one and was fascinated by it.  I plucked me a big, glossy, fragrant bloom and walked around sniffing it.  After a while, I started to feel kind of funny and couldn't breathe so good so I went to tell my Momma and when I walked in the door both of them freaked out.  My face and neck were grotesquely swollen and I was covered in red spots.  Epinephrine is my friend.  35.  I started smoking, drinking and getting high when I was about 13.  Many years of this ensued until when I was 23 I started having allergic reactions to pot.  Pot is not my friend.  36.  I quit smoking, too.    37.  I will still enjoy the occasional drink, but not to excess.  38.  I was arrested once for Driving While Intoxicated.  Funny thing is.... it was the ONE time that I wasn't.  They let me go.    39.  I once fell out of my car into the street when a police officer pulled me over for suspected DWI.  He let me go, too.  40.  I've been involved in hanky panky in the front seat of a police car.  No, it was not to get out of a ticket.  41.  Starbuck's Mocha Malt Frappuccinos contain crack.  42.  I want to travel the world.  France, Great Britain, parts of Europe, Africa, New Zealand are a few places I want to see.    43.  When I was in high school, I took French so that when I found a man who made all the checks on my list and got married and he whisked me off on our honeymoon to Paris I would know what people were saying.    44.  The man I did marry didn't make all the checks and he didn't whisk me off to Paris.  45.  I am still looking.    46.  I don't want the honeymoon in Paris anymore.    47.  I want to elope and have a nice, quiet (well, ok, maybe not quiet) honeymoon in a cozy cabin either in the mountains or on the beach.  48.  Paris can come later.    49.  I do want a beautiful, classic.. even antique wedding ring.  50.  I am not one for a lot of jewelry; but, I do want some special pieces.  51.  I once received a vacuum cleaner and a breadmaker.  A man who does that is not on the list.  52.  A man who will vacuum and make bread is.  53.  But, I am old-fashioned that way.  I want to stay barefoot and in the kitchen.  54.  Notice I didn't say pregnant.  55.  I have 3 children.  56.  I have also had a hysterectomy.  57.  A man who is okay with that is on the list.    58.  I would like to have more but that is up to the one in #57.  59.  I've had six different surgeries.  60.  I have two more pending.  61.  One of them is a total bilateral hip replacement.    62.  Sometimes I feel 72 instead of 32.  63.  But, I am a kid at heart.  64.  I love cartoons.   65.  Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?  66.  I read the LOTR waaaay back when.    67.  The LOTR Trilogy is one of the few movies made from a book that I actually like.  68.  Ok, love.  69.  Legolas.  70.  I like Harry Potter, too.  Not the books.  I want a Gryffindor scarf.  71.  I'm a big fan of all things medieval-ish.  Be it mythical or historical.  72.  I have a small collection of dragons and wizards and would like to make it a big one.  73.  I'm a collector of stuff.  74.  I love antiques.    75.  That big ol' house is going to be filled with them.  76.  And the ringing sound of laughter.  77.  And yellin', I'm sure.  78.  I have a filthy mouth and an extensive vocabulary.  No, they aren't all cuss words.  79.  My voice is different than most people expect.  80.  I have been told I should be a phone sex operator.  81.  I have a warped, wicked sense of humor at times.   82.  I love British comedy.  TV and books.  83.  I wish I had a big screen TV and a huge collection of 80s movies.   84.  And a couch as big as a boat.  85.  I wish I knew all the words to Red Wing and a voice to sing it properly.  86.  My grandfather sang that to me when I was a child.  87.  I was with him when he died.  88.  The day we buried him it was 117 degrees.  89.  "Amazing Grace" played on the bagpipes makes me cry.  90.  My ancestry is English, Irish, Scottish, German, French and American Indian.  I am 100% American.  91.  My ancestors on both sides settled in the South before moving to Texas after the Civil War.  92.  I'd like to see a dragonfly in amber someday.  93.  I am drawn to very old cemeteries.  94.  I want to have sex in them.  95.  I enjoy sex outdoors.  Indoors.  I just enjoy sex.  96.  I'm not adverse to PDAs.   97.  I have taken a vow of celibacy until I find the one with all of the elements.  98.  Gawd, I hope that's soon.  99.  It will be so worth it.  A hunnerd.  That is what it's all about.

       In My Dreams   You were here in my dreams last night.  But now, as the light of a new day awakens me I am slowly brought back to reality.   You're gone. You're not here. You're miles away from me.   I only have to close my eyes to see you, feel your breath upon my face and feel the touch of your hands upon my body.  I don't understand this desperate loneliness when I think about not being able to touch you.  My eyes open and where I felt warm and safe, I now feel cold and alone with the harsh realization that you are not really here with me.  The months stretch out before me, long and desolate and I feel an ache because of the amount of time there has to be before I can hold and be held by you.   I long for the days of laughter and conversation and the sweet ecstasy of the nights.  Even though our time together has been short and tinged with the knowledge of the fact that there is much more than distance between us, I feel as if you have been in my life forever.  Making you happy pleases me, and you bring out a feeling in me that I have never experienced.  I enjoy your presence even if you are only nearby.  But, for now, I will bide my time, and not think about the time that will pass before I can hold you. Until then, I'll see you in my dreams.

       On With the Wind   I figured I've been reading these things long enough that it was about time that I got one of my own.  I have a lot in common with the great Scarlett, I am a master procrastinator.   "I can't think about that right now. If I do, I'll go crazy. I'll think about that tomorrow" and all that.  But, in my daily reads I am always coming across something that brings to mind a past occurrence or an opinion or some such drivel.  It is high time I started doing something with them.  So, without further adieu, here goes....

      Without the snow.  And the giant tree.  And the blinding lights.  Ok, so it doesn't look a lot like Christmas around here.  Yet.  Have y'all seen those pine cones that are cinnamon scented?  Mmmmm yum!  Those are awesome.  I found them at Michael's and WalMart both.  However, they are a bit bunged up.  I'm kind of obsessive that way.  I don't like for things to be messed up in anyway, especially not something you have on display in your home.  So, I didn't buy any.  Instead, I thought to myself "Self, you can MAKE these for a whole lot less money and have them look a whole lot better."  And the kids will have fun at the park pickin up pine cones.  We always go feed them to the prairie dogs anyway.  May as well throw a few in a sack and bring em home and cook em up.  Then it will at least begin to smell a whole lot like Christmas.

      Well, not exactly all the way, but there were times when I wanted to.  I had my gallbladder taken out Tuesday, November 25th so things have been a wee bit sore-ish the last few days.  But, I'm not sick anymore!  I can handle sore knowing it is going to go away WAY better than I can being sick 24/7.  The surgery went fairly well.  I have way more pain than I anticipated due to having adhesions all the way up to my gallbladder from the appendectomy gone awry.  And, when I came to in my room (having no memories of recovery room or traveling from point A to point B to point C) I was hurling, which is nothing new, I always do that after anesthesia.  Except this time it was bright red blood.  Imagine if you will a highly drugged person seeing this.  Come to find out they tore something in my nose when they put the NG tube down it during the surgery and my nose had been bleeding the entire time down my throat.  GAH-ROSS!  And scary to see coming up!  Thanksgiving dinner was good for everyone else!  I wasn't able to eat more than a couple of bites that day.  And that was only white meat turkey, green beans, some sweet potatoes and roll since I am on a low-to-no fat diet for a while.  But, I'll gladly sacrifice this Thanksgiving because now I know that the rest of them will be enjoyable.  This morning I started sneezing.  That wasn't a lot of fun.  I think I popped a few stitches loose before I got it under control.  OUCH!  I may have also invented a few new words.  My belly button is some rather interesting hues of blue and black and green.  There are 5 lovely new soon-to-be scars added to my collection.  And the worst thing?  I can't drive for at least 2 weeks!  ARGH!!!!  Fortunately my mother is here to cart me and the chilluns around.  Especially since I can't pick anything up either.  Certainly not 32 pounds of wriggling, writhing Willabeast.  That child is a buncha handfuls.  So, I'm thankful for the help.  I will be glad to get my independence back though.

      I lurve Sarah.  I guess my first favorite song of hers was  urlLink Ice Cream .  I really love  urlLink Angel ,    urlLink Hold On ,  urlLink Sweet Surrender ,  urlLink Do What You Have to Do ,  urlLink I Love You , and  urlLink Possession .  Don't get me wrong, I love all her songs, but these are the ones that I can really identify with.  It's funny, over all the years, that these songs have never been associated with any person... other than that person out there who I hadn't met yet, you know... THE ONE?  The one that speaks to me off of her new album, Afterglow, is  urlLink Push .  And I do associate it with someone; but, circumstances being what they usually are... well... I don't know what to say about that right now, so I won't.

      Funny my last post should be about inappropriately medicating patients.  I have been sick for around a month and a half now.  Let me start at the beginning to avoid any confusing backtracking or asides (well ok they won't be avoided since I am highly prone to doing them anyways, but at least the story will be chronological).   About a month and a half ago I was suffering from the usual fall/winter sinus problems, which as usual turned into a sinus infection.  I get at least two a year, in the spring and in the fall.  I went to the family doctor I have been using and was seen by his Physician's Assistant.  I told her the problem and the history and what meds I was taking.  She prescribed for me an expectorant.  I told her that I was already taking an expectorant and that would not do me any good, I needed some Zithromax.  She did not agree and dismissed me.  I was back two days later:  couldn't breathe, wheezing, head exploding... all of the usual sinus infection/bronchitis symptoms.  She said to me "It's only been 48 hours, why are you back here?"  She is a rather snotty bitch.  I told her why and she ordered a chest x-ray and dismissed me.  I said "Enough of this bullshit" and went to the clinic where I used to work and saw one of the doctors and she said, sure enough, you not only have a nasty sinus infection but bronchitis.  She gave me the proper meds and I was well within a week.  Now, I had already taken that round of antibiotics.  I went to my yearly physical with my GYN and he discovered that, unbeknownst to me, I had a bacterial infection.  So, another round of antibiotics.  And if you've ever taken Flagyl, you know how bad they tear you up.  Within about 5 days, I thought I was gonna die my stomach and chest hurt so bad.  So, I went to the ER one night when I was having a particularly bad attack and they told me I was having a "panic attack".  Now, I am not one to have panic attacks, but what do I know?  I'm not a doctor.  Not even a week later, I was back in the ER with another bad attack.  The doctor I saw that night said I was suffering from gastric disturbances due to the antibiotics and that it was GERD (fancy words for real bad heartburn) and gave me some meds and said to follow up with my family doctor.  Which I did, and he gave me some Nexium.  Which did me absolutely no good.  Another week passes and I am still having horrible stomach aches, chest pain, nausea, etc.  Another bad attack sends me to the ER again.  The nice doctor I saw that night actually bothered to do an exam and found that I was having gallbladder attacks.  So, he gave me some appropriate medicine and discharged me with an appointment in the morning to have a gallbladder sonogram done.  The next morning I have the sonogram done and they find that my gallbladder is full of "sludge" and "floaters"  (which are stones forming) and it is inflamed and needs to come out.  So, of course, it's back to my family doctor for a referral to a surgeon.  Which I got that day and had the appointment with the surgeon the following day.  I go to my appointment, give them my information and sit down to wait.  I am finally called back to an exam room and the nurse says the doctor will be with you in a few minutes.  Another nurse comes in a few minutes later and gives me some brochures regarding the surgery.  Then the doctor finally comes in and sits down and says "So, you have gallstones" and I say "Well, not yet, but..." and he interrupts me and says "Yeah that can cause you some pain.  Now, we can probably do it with the laproscope but we may have to do an open cholesystectomy.  I'll have the nurse come in and get you set up" and he walked out.  Now, I am sitting there going "What the hell?  He never asked me my history, concerns, NOTHING!".  So, in a few more minutes the nurse comes back in and says to call her in the morning and she will tell me when the surgery will be.  I asked her how long she thought it would be and she said "Oh, with your insurance we have to call the hospital and THEY tell US when the surgery can be done.  It will probably be about two weeks."  And I said to her that was not going to work (and had anyone bothered to TALK with me they would have known this).  So, I left very unhappy with the whole experience.  I called my family doctor the next morning and explained to them what was going on:  that I was miserable and could not function with the pain I was experiencing and I have 3 kids to take care of and I could not wait two more weeks and besides that I was not comfortable with the surgeon they referred me to.  Now, keep in mind, I am having to deal with the snotty bitch PA this whole time.  She starts trying to tell me a bunch of bullshit about that is how it is done and I would just have to accept that.  I told her that where I come from it is not done that way, that the doctor finds out the situation and calls the hospital and tells THEM when the surgery would be.  She said to me that maybe that was what I should do and I said to her oh I will.  She then tells me "Well, when they won't help you don't come back to us and expect us to help you because we won't."  I was quite speechless then.  I think I said something along the lines of "Oh, believe me I won't" and hung up.  I called my doctor/friend back home and he immediately set me up.  The next morning the mail lady knocked on the door with a certified letter for me.  Seems that I have been terminated as a patient for "inappropriate behavior to physician's office staff and inappropriate behavior to a referring physician's office".  Now... I'm sorry... I've been misdiagnosed by these yayhoos for three weeks (well, actually longer counting the sinus thing, so that's twice in a row), I'm in such pain I can't function (never once having been offered the appropriate treatment) and I never ONCE cursed or raised my voice, merely tried to explain my concerns regarding the situation and I'M the one who has behaved inappropriately???   I don't even think so.  They have not SEEN inappropriate.  I am of the mind that this town is trying to kill me one way or the other and this... this is the straw.  I mean... do I not have the right to a second opinion?  Or to express my opinion period??  I guess it is all well and fine that they have been guilty of malpractice; but, I am supposed to just shut up and take it?  No.  I've done that for far too many years.  I am not exactly sure what I can do about this situation legally, but you can rest assured that I will be filing complaints with the proper agencies AND writing a letter to the editor of the local paper among other things.  Sometimes I think it is just me that has these problems, but I know that can't be true.  It has to be happening to other people and I for one am not going to take it any more.  Gawd, major flashback.  "We're not gonna take it, we're not gonna take it, WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE" courtesy of the lovely Dee Snyder and Twisted Sister.  Great anthem.

      What many people don't know or don't remember is that Dolly's hit "I Will Always Love You" is not the kind of love song that it has been made out to be.  Sure, it's a somewhat generic tune regarding love and moving on; but, she wrote it when she made the decision to end her long-time singing partnership with Porter Waggoner.  To me it evokes the epitome of love and friendship, the generosity of giving your friend what they need (while it may not be what either one of you WANTS).  Life works that way on occasion.  While you may love someone (a friend, a lover, even a family member), sometimes it just isn't meant to be.  And what good are hard feelings?   It's difficult to not have them, but when you stop and think about it, isn't it better to wish someone the best?  If you truly love that person, that is what you want for them.  And sometimes it isn't you.  I Will Always Love You  Dolly Parton   If I should stay,  I would only be in your way.  So I'll go, but I know  I'll think of you ev'ry step of the way.   And I will always love you.  I will always love you.  You, my darling you. Hmm.   Bittersweet memories  that is all I'm taking with me.  So, goodbye. Please, don't cry.  We both know I'm not what you, you need.   And I will always love you.  I will always love you.   (Instrumental solo)   I hope life treats you kind  And I hope you have all you've dreamed of.  And I wish to you, joy and happiness.  But above all this, I wish you love.   And I will always love you.  I will always love you.  I will always love you.  I will always love you.  I will always love you.  I, I will always love you.   You, darling, I love you.  Ooh, I'll always, I'll always love you.

      So, I was watching the CMA's (yes, Country Music Awards) the other night for some reason.  Mainly, the reason being that they said Norah Jones was going to be on so I HAD to check it out.  Come to find out there is a  urlLink tribute CD to Dolly Parton  and she's one of the artists.  Holy shit, y'all.  They blew me away.  I love them both, in case no one has noticed.  I had to go to Walmart tonight and I was killing time, cuz you know... I have nothing better to do on Saturday night than hang out in Walmart... and I went by the music dept. to check out the CD and ended up buying it.  HOLY SHIT, Y'ALL.  As I've   urlLink said before  I am a Dolly fan from WAY back, I grew up listening to her and all of the other "old-time country" folks.  As I sat and listened to this CD for the first time tonight I've waxed nostalgic, I've cried, I've been uplifted and a whole host of other emotions.  That's why I love Dolly's music.  And to hear it translated by other notable female artists....well...holy shit y'all.  I've only bought like 4 CD's in as many years and this one was well worth it.   I don't buy a lot of CD's because I usually only like one or two tracks on the whole thing.  The ones I was compelled to buy were Enya, Tracy Chapman, Norah Jones and this one obviously.  While I was out there I noticed   urlLink Sarah McLachlan  has put out a new one, first one in like five years.  Will be having to get that one soon.  There are a couple of other full CD's I'd like to add to the collection, the new   urlLink John Mayer  for one (okay, for three because I need all of them) and a few others.  Oh, and how could I forget  urlLink Jonny Lang ?!?  If y'all haven't heard this kid yet, immediately DO SO!  I had pirated most of it at one time and lost it in a computer crash so now I must go about it the legal way (damn the RIAA anyways).  But this kid... gives the blues a whole new meaning.  Ok, that is the news in music for today.  I am going to go hit play again.  (yes I have a remote but the batteries are dead, damn AA batteries to hell too)

      Having a fascination of all things Celtic and graveyards as I do, I was delighted to run across  urlLink this site and these photos  today as I was rambling around the 'net.  Her entire site is beautifully put together and fed my voyeuristic tendencies more so than usual since I also got to travel to a place that I hope to visit myself some day.

      Have you ever been going about your business - driving in your car, shopping, whathaveyou - when you see someone and you say "Hey, there's ol' whatshisface!"?  I do that all the time.  Usually, it's that person.  Occasionally, it's just someone who looks a whole lot like them.  I did that the other day, driving back from Walmart.  I looked over in the truck beside me and my mind said "Hey, that's Chad".  But, right on the heels of that was "No - no, it can't be, you dummy".  Chad's been gone for three years.  I still do that though.  For a long time after he was gone, I saw his face everywhere.  Every time I saw one of the trucks from the business he worked for, I hoped it would be him.  It's funny how the mind tries to deny a loss in little ways like that.  I'll never forget the last time I saw him.  (Well, I guess that would be the next-to-last time.)  He came by late one night.  It was around midnight, I was in my pjs, ready for bed.  I was tired and didn't invite him in.  He was just coming by to tell me that he was going to be on the road again for a while, had a rodeo to be at in Del Rio and then on to San Antonio and who knows where else.  I said the usual be carefuls and have fun.  He said he'd see me when he got back.  That weekend I was at work on the nightshift at the hospital.  When I answered the phone and it was my cousin, I knew something was wrong when she said hello.  She went on to tell me that Chad had been in an accident between Del Rio and San Antonio earlier in the night.  I was instantly filled with dread.  My heart sank further and further as she went on to say that the ambulance picked him up from that road in the middle of nowhere and they took him to the hospital but after working on him for hours they just couldn't get him back.  When she said that, my heart stopped sinking and was just.... numb.  I thought maybe she had it wrong.  Small town grapevines aren't always accurate.  In the back of my head, I knew it was true.  I just didn't want to admit it.  I'd lost many friends in the same way.  Chad was special and his loss hit especially hard.  He wasn't a big guy but he had a big personality.  He was on his way to becoming a big star in the PRCA in bronc riding.  The funeral was ... well, it was indescribable.  Sure, I could tell you what it looked like, what they said and the music they played, and who was there.  But, the feeling... I can't put that into words.  It was huge.  The emotion was so strong it was as if you could reach out and grab a handful of it out of the air.  The thought that kept going through my mind was the scant few nights before.  When he was standing on my front steps, in the glow of the porch light.  I learned the lesson of treating every goodbye as if it were the last.  Because... it very well could be.  I had forgotten about that.  I won't forget again.

      It's a wonder it hasn't withered up and blown away.  This is why I don't have houseplants.  I wonder how my kids have survived?!  I've been somewhat busy lately what with getting ready for Christmas (what little I did).  Mostly I have just been a lazy ass and haven't wanted to post.  I'd rather waste my time reading about everyone else's seemingly cool lives.  I'm glad this year is almost over.  I hope that next year will be a better one.  It has to be.  I was dreading Christmas really bad.  I know it isn't about the presents and all, but tell my oldest two kids that.  I haven't always been able to provide them with a huge Christmas, but it has always been really good stuff.  This year my son came and crawled in bed with me Christmas morning.  He woke me up and whispered to me "Mom, Santa came.  He sure didn't leave much."  I wanted to close my eyes and either cry or go back to sleep forever.  One group present (a $35 DVD player from Walmart and a DVD) and one present each (a tshirt) just doesn't cut it.  Yeah, yeah, I realize there are kids who got far less, and that there are kids who don't have parents or at least mothers who love them like I do my kids... and that their dad and step-mom and his mom more than compensated... but that isn't the point.  I let them down.  I want better for my kids.  And I feel really bad that circumstances have been what they have been lately and this is the fallout.  Well, enough of that.  It's over and done and all I can do is hope that next year is better.  How was y'all's Christmas?  (Yes, that is too a word)

      It is so nice to know that  urlLink chivalry isn't completely dead.   I have long searched for a man who does the little things, holds doors open and the like.  And for one to take it above and beyond?  There are no words.   Other than "Point him out" and "Is he single?".

      Today has sort of been one of those days.  You know the ones?  Where your mood changes like quicksilver and you feel out of control?  Nothing has gone your way for so long that you don't ever see it coming again?  I have always been a "driving in the car really fast with the stereo blaring the nastiest rock available" kind of stress reliever.  Today, I had enough so I had to get out.  My hoopty doesn't have a cd player so I just listen to the radio in the car.  Fortunately, we now have a  urlLink decent radio station  here.  So, I was out for a drive... no, not a fast one, I am not recovered enough from the surgery for the maneuvering involved... and was listening to the radio when  urlLink this here song  came on.  Now, I haven't liked anything of theirs in a few years, but when I heard this one I was like "HAYULL YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN ABOUT".  Yeah, it's a bit extreme, but there are days when we feel like that about people we really do love.  I have felt that way a lot lately.

      I know it's a bad habit to post song lyrics and call them a proper post.  But, music is a big part of our lives.  Or some of our lifes anyway.  And sometimes I hear the lyrics to a song and I'm like "Yeah.... that's it."  Something I have in my head, a conflict or feeling that I can't put into words myself.  I've long been a fan of Oasis and I had forgotten about  urlLink this song.   It is so fitting at this point in my life.  Well, any point in life, but it really speaks to me right now.

      I have a secret fetish.  Ok, so I have several but let's stick with this one for now, shall we?  People see mistletoe and automatically think about kissing.  What do they think about when they see a Christmas tree?  Presents?  Pretty lights and ornaments?  Me, I think about something totally unrelated.  When I see a Christmas tree, my mind goes to other things under the tree.  Like two naked bodies intertwined.  Yes, that's right.  I have a sex under the Christmas tree fetish.  Am I alone in this or do other people think of the same thing?  I think I must be fairly alone in this because while this is a major fetish for me, I've never once actually DONE it.  Someday, though, I will.

      In a conversation earlier today, I was saying that one reason I haven't been to the movie theater in many years is because I don't like going by myself.  No sooner than the words were out, I was thinking "What?".  I do so too enjoy going to the moving by myself!  I enjoy going out to eat by myself.  I enjoy going shopping by myself.  In fact, I have no problem going anywhere by myself.  Ok, maybe I do regarding bars or clubs.  But, as far as anywhere else is concerned, especially the movie theater, I've never had any qualms about going alone.  I have been saying this for many years, however.  I think it is due to the fact that I am tired of being alone and I simply want someone to go with.  I also think it's somewhat of a cop out, a pat reason why I don't get out and do something when and if given the chance.  Isn't it funny how if you say something often enough and long enough, you start to believe it yourself?  I have convinced myself of many things that way, in retrospect.  I am positive that I am not the only one.  I think we all must do it.  "This relationship is working/will work."  "I enjoy being single."  "My ass doesn't look fat in these pants."  I'm thinking a re-evaluation of some of the things we have been telling ourselves and others for years is in order.

      You have just won one million dollars:  1. Who do you call first? My Mom and my Dad.  2. What is the first thing you buy for yourself? A Cadillac ESV  3. What is the first thing you buy for someone else? A Tahoe for my Mom.  4. Do you give any away? If yes, to whom? Yes, to family.  Actually it wouldn't be so much giving it to them as buying them things.  5. Do you invest any? If so, how? Yes, I would invest most of it.  How I don't know, I would have to either research the best possible way to do that or hire an investment manager.

      I have expensive tastes.  Here lately I haven't been able to support those habits as in the past.  Now, I just settle for adding things I want to my gigantor list.  I was in Dillard's the other day buyin some pantays and of course I had to go by the perfume counter.  Bad idea.  I have been out of perfume for a long time now, and since I only like the expensive ones and would rather go without than wear anything cheap, I have been without for far too long.  The new  urlLink Cacharel Amor Amor  caught my eye and my nose first.  Then out of the corner of my eye I saw the familiar Boss logo.  Me love Boss long time.  So, I knew I'd like it without smelling it, but I had to anyway.  Oh My Gawd.  It's called  urlLink Boss Intense  and it smells like ... well, let's just say I got all turned on there in the big middle of Dillard's.  I must have.

      In his final years, my grandfather suffered from many strokes, dementia, and extreme hard-of-hearingness (yes, I like to make words up).  In one of his many visits to the hospital while he was still pretty much with it, yet exceedingly hard of hearing, the nurse was telling him what they were going to be doing to him.  She was going down the list, and he was sitting there nodding.  She asked him if he had ever had a catheter before and he suddenly became very indignant.  "I am NOT a cat hater!", he tells her in a very offended tone of voice.      Cat hater.  hahaha

      I don't know how or why I fell out of touch with  urlLink Sister Hazel.   I remember them from way back, and loved their stuff.  Cruising around on All Blogged Up the other day she had some lyrics and a link at the end of one of her posts.  I liked the one she had thrown up there (Your Mistake), and made a mental note to check them out.  I'm glad I finally remembered.  These guys are so great.  They have improved much over the years that I haven't been listening to them, and there are several songs on their latest album,  urlLink Chasing Daylight , that speak to me.  Most notably Life Got in the Way, Killing Me Too, Effortlessly, and Can't Believe.  Pretty decent sorta southern alternative rock. (LOL)  Check them out, you won't be sorry.

      In my previous post, I made a statement that isn't entirely true.  I do have friends.  Not many, but I do.  I have become very selective about those who I surround myself with, to the point that I am not surrounded.  So, thank you to those friends for being the kind of people who I can let in.  I have been doing some thinking today.  And some talking.  One of my friends will not simply let me "be".  He doesn't do it on purpose.  (Well, sometimes he does.)  He is the kind of person who makes me want to be a better me.  Some of y'all know that trying to get me to open up about the really relevant stuff is like trying to do dentistry on a bear.  I have become a represser and suppresser in the interest of self-preservation, because I have simply become too tired for all of the angst and self-discovery and the gettinupoffofmyassanddoinsomethinaboutitall.  As I was sayin to him, I am at another one of those crossroads you inevitably come to in life.  But, due to the afore mentioned tiredness, I have just been sitting here park.  I am tired of going down the wrong road and having to either backtrack or detour.  I am tired of going along, minding my own business, and being broad-sided.  I am tired of coming to the construction, the traffic jams, and the idiot motorists who litter life's highway.  Trite analogy, but it's all I can come up with at the moment.  I have been shifting from park to neutral here lately, trying to get revved up to go somewhere.  I know I need to.  I keep running across people and words who make me think of who I could and should be.  This morning over at  urlLink Jett's , this post made me sit and ponder for a bit, and light a little fire of inspiration in my clogged up carburetor.  And from there, I was led to  urlLink this here post.   That sums up a lot of my feelings.  She says it much better than I can at the moment.  I need a vacation, y'all.  And I need that sit-down lunch we been talkin about, Jay Dee Gee.  And I need to get in gear.

      For sure.  I lived in one place for most of my life.  I was born there, raised there, and swore I'd always get out of there.  I've moved away 4 times, and for some reason or another I always ended up getting sucked back there.  This time I've sworn I'd rather live on the street in a cardboard box than move back there again.  So, why is it today I wish that I was back there?  Ahh.. homesickness.  I think that mostly it is that I am not happy where I am right now.  Oh sure, I have a nice apt. and live in a decent enough town.  But, it isn't going for me right now.  I have not been able to find a job, and I have not been able to find any friends.  I do not have any family in this town (save my ex husband and that doesn't really count).  I'm lonely.  I want somewhere that I can go visit if I am tired of my place.  I want friends who drop by and hang out.  I want my family close so that when I need them, or they need me, it's not an hour drive to get there.  I want to live back in the country where it is peaceful and there are no neighbors and my kids can go outside and play and I don't have to watch them like a hawk.  I could go on and on with the good stuff, but then I'd have to start listing the bad stuff.  Not that I don't have bad stuff here.  My problem isn't all situational.  The usually rational adult me knows that.  The scared little girl (who I never admit is still there) me doesn't care, she just wants to go home.

         You are The Cap'n!  Some men are born great, some achieve greatness and some slit the throats of any man that stands between them and the mantle of power. You never met a man you couldn't eviscerate. Not that mindless violence is the only avenue open to you - but why take an avenue when you have complete freeway access? You are the definitive Man of Action. You are James Bond in a blousy shirt and drawstring-fly pants. Your swash was buckled long ago and you have never been so sure of anything in your life as in your ability to bend everyone to your will. You will call anyone out and cut off their head if they show any sign of taking you on or backing down. You cannot be saddled with tedious underlings, but if one of your lieutenants shows an overly developed sense of ambition he may find more suitable accommodations in Davy Jones' locker. That is, of course, IF you notice him. You tend to be self absorbed - a weakness that may keep you from seeing enemies where they are and imagining them where they are not.    urlLink   What's Yer Inner Pirate?     brought to you by  urlLink The Official Talk Like A Pirate Web Site.  Arrrrr!      Have I mentioned that my lastest fascination is  urlLink Pirates of the Caribbean ?  I almost didn't watch it because of Johnny Depp.  In fact, I didn't watch it until this month.  Johnny D.  has kind of put me off the last few years.  The whole downhill slide after Edward Scissorhands and What's Eating Gilbert Grape.  But, Orlando Bloom won out.  Mmmm.. elf or pirate... I'd watch him anyday.  So, color me shocked when my favorite in the movie was Captain Jack Sparrow.  That part was made for him, or he made that part, either way.... I'm hooked.  Aye!  Avast!

      I received an email today from a lady who had read a comment I had written on another blog.  It's kind of cool that you can either help or inspire or reassure people who you have never met and never will meet with just a few words graffitied on the internet.  I'm glad she took the time to send me an email.  I vaguely remembered the post she was talking about, so I searched until I found it.   urlLink This is the post on moodymama  that she read and my comments are farther down.  Take a minute to read it or you won't understand the rest of what I am about to say. Done? Ok. I spent years in hell.  YEARS.  In HELL.  I thought I was crazy.  Thought I should be locked up somewhere.  And it just got worse and worse and worse.  When I was pregnant with Willa and the year after I had her, I was seriously considering Red River.  I had been bad in years past.  Breaking things, raging and raging.  Hurting myself mostly.  Physically anyway.  Emotionally myself and others.  Now, I knew a lot of it was due to my hormones, because the worst of it would hit before my period, it was bad during and some after.  It was a vicious cycle.  The week before my period I was like a land mine.  Set and ready to go off and who knew when or on who it would go off.  I was temperamental and irritable and hostile.  There were times when I literally saw red.  It was like the "dragon" had possessed me and I could feel the rage and hate overtaking me until I wasn't there anymore.  Then, when I started my period... I was depressed.  Crying constantly, getting my feelings hurt over and over for nothing.  Then the week after my period, that was the worst.  Suicidal, feelings of worthlessness, why should I live I am a horrible person I wish I would just die please God just take me now and get it over with.  I dreamed of dying, killing myself, being killed in some random accident.  Fantasized about it.  And this went on for years.  From the time I was 13 or 14 until I was 31 years old, progressively getting worse and worse.  I had times when it wasn't so bad.  But that could all change in a moment.  It was always there, lurking.  Since I've had the hysterectomy I have been a different person.  Oh sure, I have my moods.  But that's life.  Now I have a handle on them and can discern between real emotion and the irrational, out-of-control monster that had overtaken my emotions.  Stress is gonna happen.  But when it is coming from inside of you... what do you do?  Especially when you can't control it.  I had taken pills upon pills upon pills to no avail.  If it had gone on the way it was headed, who knows where I would be now.  And I had pretty much forgotten all of that.  Well, not forgotten but pushed to the back of the memory vault.  Who wants to remember horrible stuff?  So, I am glad that woman read my words and took a moment to write me about them.  It was a great reminder.  Because yeah... things could be worse.

      1. What cologne or perfume do you wear? The last two perfumes I wore were Wish by Chopard and Sentiment by Escada.  I generally don't wear the same perfume for more than one bottle.  I either get tired of it or just want a change.  Right now I want some Amor Amor by Cacharel or Intense by Hugo Boss.  Anyone want to indulge me?    2. What cologne or perfume do you like best on the opposite sex?   Herrera by Carolina Herrera, anything Hugo Boss.   3. What one smell can you not stomach? My mom's perfume, that Pheremone crap.    4. What smell do you like that others might consider weird? Gasoline, mechanic shops.    5. How do you plan to spend your weekend? Probably the same way I spend most weekends, in extreme boredom.  Anyone want to unbore me?

      Today has been a sad day.  My father-in-law lost his battle with cancer.  He fought long and hard, but in the end it wasn't enough.  Our only consolation is that he is in a better place now.  But, it isn't much when he has left behind so many who loved him at such an early age.  It's hard to understand why God does the things he does.  That's always been a major problem with me and religion.  Why does He take a good person when there are so many bad ones wasting space on this Earth?  And it's hard to try to explain why Grand-dad isn't with us anymore to my children.  They don't know or care that he is in a better place and not sick and in pain anymore, they just know that they aren't ever going to get to see him or play with him again.  They will understand someday, but it doesn't make it any easier NOW.  For anyone of us really.  His funeral is Tuesday and they want to go.  It is going to be a hard day emotionally.  But all we can do is get through it and try to understand.  Life goes on.  It will have a Grand-dad sized hole in it, but it does go on.

      I don't know what it is about me that makes sweet young boys want to bring me coffee.  Maybe they think that is the way to an old woman's heart.  More likely into her panties.  (Although why they would want into an old woman's panties is beyond me.)  I wish that I could take them up on all the coffee offers, without the strings, just for the yummy coffee.  Alas, the only sweet young boy that I want to bring me coffee is not speaking to me, so I don't hold out hopes of any more of his lovely, string-free coffee deliveries.  I miss them.

      I find myself greatly unsettled lately.  Have you ever had the feeling that you are forgetting to do something, or missing something, but for the life of you you can't figure out what it is?  I feel that way all the time.  I know that it is because I am not happy with the way my life it, yet can't seem to figure out what it is I need to do about it.  Circumstances prevent me from doing many things.  That adds to the stresses I have.  I feel like I am in a giant maze and I KNOW that there are goodies stashed all around, but I keep taking the wrong paths to get to them.  And when I find a goody, it either isn't what I want or some unseen force comes and takes it away from me.  The hardest part is the loneliness.  I have a feeling I could get some of the things in my head straight if I wasn't just so damn consumed with being lonely.  I've tried to overcome that, but it's powerful.  And, I've been alone so long that I think I not only grasp at the least little kindness, but I am very selfish about it as well.  Of course, a lot of being alone is my fault.  I have let the past cloud my judgement in some issues and old habits are hard to break, especially when you don't realize you are doing it.  So, between not finding anyone worthy enough, finding someone worthy and pushing them away, and finding someone worthy and it just isn't meant to be ... well, that leaves me still alone.  I often wonder why some things in life are so hard, and if maybe I make them harder than they really are.  I don't know anymore.  Maybe I will someday.

      Since I had my gallbladder surgery, I've been trying to eat low and no fat foods.  They can be a challenge to cook sometimes.  Well, they are easy to cook, the challenge is making them palatable.  I am getting better.  But, sometimes you just gotta eat REAL food.  I love to cook, but it's mostly comfort food and old favorites.  I've been thinking about King Ranch Chicken for a while now and today I just had to make it.  Pretty damn good if I do say so myself.  Want some?

      Tonight was a test of the emergency back-up system.  You failed miserably.  Had there been an actual emergency the police would have been on your doorstep.  When I call your house repeatedly and frantically and leave messages for you to call me NOW, I mean now.  I don't mean whenever you goddamned well get around to it.  Count your blessings that it turned out to be NOT an actual emergency.  This is your final warning.    (yeah yeah, I know he isn't gonna read this, and when I tell him this in person I'll do it in a nicer way.  I'm venting, y'all should be used to that.)

      Ok.  So, I have always said that if I am wrong I will be the first one to admit it.  It happens so rarely that it's not something that I am used to or that comes easy to me.  But, here it is. I was wrong.  It was wrong of me to stereotype you.  It was wrong of me to think that you were like all of the other assholes I have had the misfortune to be friends with.  And above all, it was wrong of me to give you attitude.  That is something that I need to work on.  I will also admit that.  I have became far too bitter and cynical and have found it too easy to jump the gun and get my feelings hurt over something that shouldn't be such an issue.  I think I have become somewhat self-absorbed and forget to think that there may be things going on in other peoples lives as well.  In my head it's alway about rejection.  That's what it always has been in the past, and again with the stereotyping.  I have learned my lesson.  I knew when we entered this relationship that things would be different.  That due to circumstances it wouldn't be the usual boy/girl thing.  And you aren't the usual boy.  I try not to be the usual girl.  So, this is the public apology for anything posted here in a snit.  I'm sorry and I hope that you can forgive me.

      Words spoken harshly, can cut like a knife, sear like the flame, and crush like an avalanche of stone.  The empty ache caused can hurt for an eternity.  The bitter pain can be unbearable.  The endless lonely days and nights can cause those words to echo in the hollowness of your heart and mind. Then, someone comes along with a few words of tenderness, hope, support.  The hollowness if filled up like sunshine filling a dark cavern.  Those words can give you a new reason to fight your battles and go on with life.  A few words of inspiration can lift the spirits like a breeze blowing through the leaves. It is my belief that words - though spoken in haste or carefully thought out - should not be spoken before the consequences are reviewed. After all, what good are words of support or consolation if they are not really meant.   (circa 1989)  Talk  I remember when I called you,  Just wanting to talk. You came right over. Was talking all you wanted Or was something else on your mind? Sometime in the next few hours  My need to talk turned Into a need for something else, And then there was no need to talk. But, now I want to talk again And I don't have the nerve to call you because I don't know if you'll come this time. Do you want to talk? (circa 1987)  Crying in the Night  I lay in bed at night Crying myself to sleep Knowing it isn't right. I never knew my feelings for you Could ever run so deep. All those nights we spent together In each others arms. I thought that I could trust you, That you would do me nor harm. But there were others, too. And I soon realized  That I could not keep you All to myself. But, that doesn't keep me from dreaming, Crying in the night. And now in my daily plight I hope to have you And have you without a fight. Soon there will be no pain, No crying in the night. (circa 1985 or 6)  God, I was stupid.  I don't guess much has changed.

Did you think that I would cry, on the phone? Do you know what it feels like, being alone? I'll find someone new  Swing, Swing, Swing from the tangles of My heart is crushed by a former love Can you help me find a way To carry on again.

      1. Are you superstitious? Yes.  2. What extremes have you heard of someone going to in the name of superstition? Stopping and turning around and driving miles out of the way to avoid crossing the black cat's path, locking oneself in the house and not going anywhere at all on Friday the 13th.  3. Believer or not, what's your favorite superstition? Ahh.. I like them all.    4. Do you believe in luck? If yes, do you have a lucky number/article of clothing/ritual? Yes, to a certain extent.  I don't really believe in the whole number/article/ritual thing though.   It's more being in the right time at the right place and things like that.  5. Do you believe in astrology? Why or why not?  Yes, I do, again to an extent.  I believe the pull of the tide and the moon etc do have certain effects on our bodies.  Of course, I get looked at like I am a raving maniac when I say that, or told that I am going to hell.

      Today has been another one of those days.  We got the dryer to working yesterday.  I am quite pleased with it.  The washing machine is from hell and I am having Satan's minions come and get it in the morning as I am quite tired of dealing with it.  The "repair man" (and I use the term loosely) has been here three different times, and the washer still leaks.  So, I will get another one and keep my fingers crossed that it works properly.  Actually, I am going to see if I can get my Mamaw's old washing machine from back home here and see if it works and if not what needs to be done to get it that way.  It would be cheaper than buying another one and it worked fine when it was put into storage.  It's just the logistics of moving it 60someodd miles.  Hopefully, worth it in the long run and not moved that far just to go into the junk heap.  Think positive!  I sometimes have a problem doing that.  Inherent pessimism and all that.  There is a saying that I try to keep in mind.  "I was sad because I had no shoes until I saw a man who had no feet."  Generally, there is always someone who is in a worse situation than you are.  I learned a long time ago not to ask what else could go wrong.  And, it could always be worse.  It has been worse.  Not THE worst, but I've had some pretty bad times.  But, all one can do it live through them and hopefully learn and become stronger for them.  Still, they can get you down when you don't ever have a break from them.  When one thing after another happens, and many things at once are happening.  I'm gonna whine about it again.  I need a vacation.  I guess we could all use one though.  I am in a better mood than I was the other day.  Like I said, when I am in a pissy mood, EVERYTHING pisses me off.  Even stuff I am generally not going to get pissed about.  I have learned to have compassion.  To always give the benefit of the doubt.  But, I am also an inherent worrier.  No matter who it is.  If someone doesn't call, I fear the worst.  In a barditch somewhere, etc.  It's usually not the case, but it has been known to be.  So, there's that and the whole being considerate thing.  Anyways...  I ramble on.    urlLink Someone  just mentioned V-day.  I think I'll kick him.

      Well.  Okay.  I have lost my mind.  I was over at  urlLink dooce  just now checking out the  urlLink goings on and pictures  and now I am sitting here crying (it was the bottom picture that did it).  I know, I know.  I have 3 kids that drive me crazy.  And I love each and every one of them.  And no, I really don't want more.  Well, I do in a way.  It saddens me that I don't have that choice any more.  That I won't ever be able to go through the whole process the way it should be done, with a loving partner and father there.  That I won't ever experience the wonders of a new baby again.   That I will miss out on some great guys because they haven't experienced that and can't with me so they will do it with someone else.  I debated long and hard about having a hysterectomy.  And I know it was the thing to do, but still... I have my moments.

      I'm a clumsy bitch.  Always have been.  Years ago, one of my cousins nicknamed me "Tommy Girl" one day after the 574,899th time I marked myself in some bizarre incident.  That day it was opening the door to my Grand Cherokee and proceeding to bloody my nose and black both my eyes in the process.  I can't tell you how many times I've been wounded by car doors.  Fingers slammed in them, legs slammed in them, hands rolled up in windows, hair rolled up in windows, jabbing myself on the top corner (you know the one, the wicked sharp pointy part), smacking myself in the face/head/body with them, breaking a finger hanging a ring on them.  You name it.   And that's just car doors, all the other assorted injuries due to other inanimate objects would take many more posts.  Today my cousin and I had to go to Walmart and get some washer/dryer crap.  I jumped out of the pickup and some of his assorted floorboard ornamentation fell out.  I leaned down to pick it up and on rising up tried to remove my nose with my glasses by slamming them into the rearview mirror.  Yeah, it left a mark.

      Does anyone not remember that  urlLink I think February sucks ?  There's a reason for that.  I hate Valentine's Day.  Why?  I guess because of the whole symbolism thing and all it represents.  Because I'm always left out of that.  I have never had a date for Valentine's Day, no romantic gifts, no flowers, no candy, no jack shit.  NEVER.  Hell, I am 32 years old and I've never had a proper "date"  much less a proper Valentine's Day.  So, yeah, I'm a little disenchanted with Valentine's day and all of that.  If I hear any more about it I may commence another massacre.

      I've been on the verge of getting my mad on for a while now.  Well, no longer.  I am in a hella bad mood.  I'm tired.  I don't feel the greatest.  I'm broke.  There are people who suck.  I am sexually frustrated.  You name it.  I'm sick of things not going the way they are supposed to.  I am sick of people not doing the things they are supposed to.  The next governmental road block I come across, I am probably going to blow up the goddamn building.  Or assassinate Gee Dubya.  (yeah, now the feebs and all those other governmental pantywaists will probably be watching me, fuck 'em)   After driving all over hell and half of Texas Friday and finally finding a reasonably priced washer and dryer (and of course not at the same place) I couldn't get the sonofabitches home.  Well, they are home now.  And the fucking washing machine doesn't work.  So, now I have to see if the guy who sold it to me is going to stand behind his guarantee that it worked or if I am going to have to go and yank his asshole over his head.  Does the dryer work?  I don't have a clue.  The plug-in is the wrong fucking kind and the maintenance man is out until God knows when. I had an appointment this morning at yet another agency (yes, governmental agency, the fuckers) and after sitting there waiting for over an hour (with a cranky 2 year old) I was finally able to provide them with all 97 pages of the information they required.  So, of course, I am expecting to hear back from them with an approval.  Is that what they called me with this afternoon?  Fucking hell no.  I now have to go BACK and apply with the other stupid fucking State agency that denied me in the first place and then take the denial back to THEM before they will approve me.  As if the first denial wasn't enough?  No, now I have to repeat the entire fucking process, and WAIT for God only knows how many more months before I can get the help I need to go to the Dr. to find out about the goddamned abdominal mass I have.  That's lovely.  Thanks, y'all.  I hope it's not fucking cancer and y'all are just dicking me around and letting it overtake my body before you help me so then you won't have to pay out as much because I'll be DEAD.   Some days I wonder if that isn't better.   (Oh, y'all didn't know I have had my lovely psychotic breaks and flirtations with suicide? yeah)  At least that way my kids would have money for the things they need.  If their fucking sperm donors would step up and be real men I wouldn't have to worry about that.  That's what I get for messing with not-real men.  And still I'm too fucking nice and don't nail their asses to the wall.  Why is that?  Well, I don't know, but I tell you, my ex-husband just used his last get out of shit free card.  He has a brandgoddamned new truck and I get shit for child support and he couldn't help me get my washer and dryer home.  And we won't even get off on the subject of Brad.  Useless fucker.  He should have to have a mandatory frontal lobotomy.  Yeah, I'm just gonna touch on all the things that piss me off.  Why not?  It's my fucking rant.  (and yeah I'm gonna use that word alot, if you don't like it, don't read it)  Fucking men piss me the hell off.  They really do.  That was one major reason for the whole celibacy thing.  But I blew that one all to hell, didn't I?  Not that I regret it for one second.  I'm just pissed off right now so everything is fair game.  Those who know me know that I may rant and rave and throw things but don't take it personally, eh?  Well, sometimes it's personal.  If I'm spouting off at the mouth it's a pretty fair indication that it's not too personal.  It's when I don't talk that you should wonder.  I'm kind of passive-aggressive that way.  And when I'm mad everything pisses me off.  (You know the other night when you asked if I was mad?  And I said irritated maybe, but not mad?  Well, the next time I'll be mad.  It's happened four times.  I can excuse a few, but when it becomes a habit it pisses me off.  Oh, who am I kidding... I wouldn't be pissed with you.  Hurt and irritated maybe.  I hate waiting for someone who isn't going to show up.  It makes me feel like I don't matter enough to a) show up b) call and say you aren't going to show up.  And why am I saying this here?  Sorry, got carried away.)  Now I've lost track of where I was.  Oh yeah.  Everything pisses me off.  I seriously need a break.  I've dealt with this shit for far too long and haven't had any real time for just me, no kids around.  And it's beginning to show.  But, there's that whole no money, nowhere to go thing.  It's a circle jerk.  So, while a weekend away would be nice I don't guess I'll be getting a break anytime soon.  Maybe some dirty, nasty, hot, sweaty, pisstheneighborsoff, rough sex?  Can I get that?  Because I'd take that, too.

      1. What's the most daring thing you've ever done? I guess that depends on your definition of daring.  Public nudity, sex in public, meeting people off of the internet, getting stoned in Six Flags countless things.    2. What one thing would you like to try that your mother/friend/significant other would never approve of? I think I've pretty much done all of it.  Tattoos, the above listed stuff, piercing my eyebrow.  I can't think of much left that they wouldn't approve of that I haven't tried.    3. On a scale of 1-10, what's your risk factor? (1=never take risks, 10=it's a lifestyle) In the past... 10.  Now?  Probably 2 or 3.    4. What's the best thing that's ever happened to you as a result of being bold/risky? Seeing New Orleans for the first time in the early morning rain.  Meeting a truly awesome person.    5. ... and what's the worst? I can't think of any worsts.  I have escaped my adventures unscathed for the most part.  I try not to live my life regretting things that I have done.

      Well, the Pats pulled it off in the last minute (literally).  And they weren't the only one pulling it off.  What the HAYULL was up with the  urlLink  Janet and Justin halftime show antics ?!?  Oh my Gawd!   The whole halftime thing has got to where it sucks so bad it's not even worth watching.  I guess they think that "surprises" like that will keep everyone interested.  Forget about the lip-synching and half-hearted performances.  And Beyonce really needs to stick to what she does best.  The national anthem it is not.  Aerosmith was great, as usual.  And Josh Groban... my oh my that boy can SING!  His was the best performance bar none.  Well, other than Tom Brady's.  The commercials weren't all they usually are either.  The AOL/Orange County choppers one did crack me up.  And the Bud Light dog trick one.  And I liked the Pepsi one, but why not just let people download the songs, why must they buy Pepsi to get them?  Oh yeah... marketing.  Too bad Pepsi sucks.  I'll stick with WinMX.  But, the main purpose of it all was the game, and it was an excellent one.  The Panthers did an awesome job and I thought they might have it there for a minute, but the Pats and their experience persevered.

      I know, I know.  I've been very neglectful here.  But in my defense I was out of town for almost a week with no internet access.  Otherwise, I just haven't had much to say.  Well, I take that back.  I've had plenty to say but y'all really don't want to hear me bitch and moan and whine, now do ya?  Didn't think so.  It's pretty much a broken record anyways.  Kids driving me crazy, need a vacation (from them), preferably one involving a lot of sex (or just any sex anytime at all), my car sucks ass and is fallin' apart on me, I am broke already, etc, etc, ad infinitum, ad nauseum.  So, unless any of y'all can do anything about any of that... well, don't be bitchin' cuz I'm not postin'.

      (Yeah, yeah, I backdated it.  Shuddup.)  If you...  1. ...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve? Hmm... if I were doing the cooking?  Homestyle definitely.  Lots of soups and sandwiches and chili and stuff.  I actually want a lunch counter/coffee bar/bookstore.  And I had a great idea over the weekend.  Why not have a laundromat with it all, too?  Anyone want to venture into business with me?  I think it would really work.  2. ...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell? Books, definitely books.  And maybe mixed media.  And coffee and stuff.  See above.  3. ...wrote a book, what genre would it be? Chick Lit probably.  4. ...ran a school, what would you teach? Oral Gratification  5. ...recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it? Eek!  Y'all definitely don't want me singing.  Much less recording my singing.  But if I could sing I'd want to be able to sing bluesy, torch music.  Something sexy and soulful.  Like Portishead maybe.

      She may be the face I can't forget The trace of pleasure or regret Maybe my treasure or the price I have to pay She may be the song that summer sings May be the chill that autumn brings May be a hundred different things Within the measure of a day  She may be the beauty or the beast May be the famine or the feast May turn each day into a Heaven or a Hell She may be the mirror of my dreams A smile reflected in a stream She may not be what she may seem Inside her shell....  She, who always seems so happy in a crowd Whose eyes can be so private and so proud No one's allowed to see them when they cry She maybe the love that cannot hope to last May come to me from shadows in the past That I remember 'till the day I die  She maybe the reason I survive The why and wherefore I'm alive The one I care for through the rough and ready years  Me, I'll take the laughter and her tears And make them all my souvenirs For where she goes I've got to be The meaning of my life is She....She Oh, she....

      She can kill with a smile She can wound with her eyes And she can ruin your faith with her casual lies And she only reveals what she wants you to see She hides like a child But she's always a woman to me  She can lead you to love She can take you or leave you She can ask for the truth But she'll never believe  And she'll take what you give her as long as it's free Yeah, she steals like a thief but she's always a woman to me  Oh, she takes care of herself She can wait if she wants She's ahead of her time Oh, and she never gives out And she never gives in She just changes her mind  And she'll promise you more Than the Garden of Eden Then she'll carelessly cut you And laugh while you're bleedin' But she'll bring out the best And the worst you can be Blame it all on yourself Cause she's always a woman to me  Oh, she takes care of herself She can wait if she wants She's ahead of her time Oh, and she never gives out And she never gives in She just changes her mind  She is frequently kind And she's suddenly cruel But she can do as she pleases She's nobody's fool And she can't be convicted She's earned her degree And the most she will do Is throw shadows at you But she's always a woman to me

      Why is it that some of us are wired to be night people?  And no matter how hard we try we can't reset our internal clock to daylight hours, no matter how necessary it is?  As far back as I can remember, and that's pretty far, I've always been a night owl.  As a little kid, I would have to go to bed early for school and whatnot and I can remember laying there sleepless for HOURS.  And of course, come morning I wouldn't want to get up.  Some mornings I would go into the bathroom and lock the door as if I were getting ready for school and I would lay towels on the floor and go back to sleep for as long as I could get away with.  And in the summer and on weekends, we didn't have to go to bed (or if we were made to I never went to sleep) so I was always up.  Over the years I have tried and tried to do the early to bed, early to rise thing.  And I just can't get it to work for me.  What makes me mad is people who think that you are lazy or crazy or whatever for being that way.  To this day, my dad infuriates me because he just doesn't understand that not all people are like him.  Anyways, here it is almost 6 am and I haven't been to bed yet.  The last couple of weeks the insomnia thing has been really bad.  It doesn't help that I hate my bed being empty all the time.  How stupid is that?  That and when I do lay down a million and one things go through my head and I can't get any peace.  Maybe I need more coffee.

      I feel like I should post something, but the only words that want to come out are not good ones.  I haven't been in the mood to talk lately.  Haven't been in the mood to do anything really.  I am feeling trapped and mentally overburdened and all I want to do is either crawl into a hole or rant and rave and kick things.  It's not really that I don't want to talk, I just don't want to try to have inane conversations.  Someone asks me what's up or how I am doing and I don't want to say I'm fine and that nothing is up.  I want to say that I am slowly losing my mind and that everything is fucked up and that I hate my life.  But, who wants to hear that.  What does one say in reply to that?  I don't want your fucking platitudes.  I don't want "I feel ya" or "I understand" or "I know how you feel".  Because you know what?  You don't.  (don't take the you personally, I am speaking generally here but really, you don't)  You have no idea the fucked up extent of my existence.  You have no idea of the feelings that go on inside of me.  You have no idea what it is like to live my fucked up life.  Sure, you have stress too.  Sure, you get in bad moods too.  Sure, you have shitty things happen to you.  But you don't know how I feel and if you don't know what it is like to be me.  That may sound selfish, but there it is.  I don't let the real stuff out, mostly because people I don't want people to know.  I don't want pity, I don't want people thinking "man, she really is messed up".  It's true though.  I am.  But, I have learned that people don't want to hear it.  And if you do tell them... well, they never look at you the same again.  But, neither can I keep it all inside anymore.  It eats at me.  But, no one wants to hear it.  I've been through this cycle before.  I know it will change, and things will be better.  It's hard to see the end of it though when you are so wrapped up in loneliness and despair and anger and sadness that you just don't want to go on anymore.  Most days I just want to go to sleep and never wake up.  It's not that I want to die.  It's just that I don't want to live this life anymore and I don't see a way out of it right now.  I've tried, and I've tried and well... I'm tired of trying.  That too will change, but until it does this is how I feel.  I've said it a million times, I need a break.  But, I don't seem to be going to get one.  I know I need to change my attitude, but that is easier said than done.  There are so many levels on which I am unhappy.  And discouraged.  I don't see them changing.  I don't see Mr. Right walking into my life.  I don't see the perfect job opening up.  I don't see winning the lottery.  I know these things are possible.  But the way things have gone for me my entire life...  I don't see them happening.  Yet, I am so damned lonely and miserable and hopeful and I want someone to hold me and say everything is going to be okay.  And mean it because they know the whole story and they care.  And well...  I don't know why I bother.  I should be used to it by now.  I rent movies and I don't even watch them because I want someone to watch them with.  I wish for friends, but I haven't the slightest idea of how to go about finding them.  That and over the years I've learned that people suck and it's just not worth trying to be friends with them because you always end up alone in the end.  I don't know.  I hate feeling this way.  I hate wanting what I can't have.  And most of all I hate not knowing why the fuck I can't have it.  Am I so repulsive that people don't want to be with me?  What am I doing wrong?  I have yet to figure out why I can't keep a friend or a lover.  I know that most of the time it's because I ditch them because they are assholes.  And yes, I am an asshole sometimes too, but we all have our boundaries.  I don't cheat, I don't lie, I don't do bad things.  That's why I quit people.  Why do people quit me?  Maybe I expect too much.  All I know is I just want a chance.  That's all.  A chance.

      New meme thing since I am far too lazy for any actual content.  Do It Yourself Would you be able to do these things yourself or have someone do it for you?  1. Fix a flat tire. 2. Fix a tear or make alterations to clothing. 3. Unclog a severely plugged up sink or toilet. 4. Change the oil in your car. 5. Put together an unassembled toy or piece of furniture out of the box.  Yes to all of the above.  And then some.  My family has made sure to teach me and my brothers along the way to be completely self-sufficient.  And I can do anything they can do (and I can do it better nah na nanny boo boo).  Well, some of it.  heh  But, yes, there really isn't much that I can't do for myself except for some of the highly technical/brute strength stuff.  I haven't had anyone around to take care of that kind of stuff for the most part so it is nice to be able to rely on myself.  It is/would be nice to have someone around to take care of the things I can't.  Fortunately, there are people I can call on for the stuff I can't take care of, but it is a rare occasion that I have to.  I really feel sorry for these people who aren't able to take care of the day to day stuff.  And women who act as if they aren't capable of doing such things annoy me to no end.  Yeah, it would be nice to have someone to take care of everything for us, but it isn't realistic for some of us.  A good relationship, in my opinion, blends each persons talents and they contribute what they are skilled at, helping each other and maybe learning something along the way.

      So, I have been really bad about updating lately.  There's just been other things I'd prefer to be doing for a change, rather than lack of anything to say.  I have plenty to say, but most of it I am hoarding, and am going to selfishly keep it all to myself so that I may take it out in private and hold it in my hand and admire it as a child might a secret treasure. But, I do have a niggling little problem.  And since I am unable to hold myself accountable, I am going to call upon you, dear readers and friends, to do that for me.  Accountability sucks at times, no?  Especially when you have an extreme lack of self-control and an overwhelming junk food habit.  Yes, that is what this is all about.  I still have 20 pounds to go.  No, 45 wasn't enough!  20 more, I say!  At least.  I would like to be able to wear a swimsuit this summer and not look as if I were a sausage stuffed into its casing.  So, help a sister out here.  I am going to be posting my weight here now, and then I will follow up once a week.  Feel free to cast aspersions and throw tomatoes if the numbers have not decreased.  (rotten tomatoes only please, lest I eat them).  Today's grand total is... are you ready for this?  Ok.  Here goes.  This is harder than I thought it would be.  Right.  I weigh... and keep in mind that I usually weigh in the morning so that it is less and it is now 2:30 and I have had food and all that and oh okay I'll quit dithering now.  I weigh 173???  Sheee-it.  A few days ago it was only 163.  Maybe we should try that again in the morning.  Anyways.  That's what the scale says as of 2:33 pm on April 20, 2004.  That's worse than I thought because that in essence means I need to get back down to 163 and then lose 20 pounds.  So...  30 it is.  Ugh.

      Today was really craptacular  I got out of bed just before breakfast because the smell of cooking bacon woke me up.  I feel sad, because Sarah and Britney are complete bitches. They told everyone I have an STD, just because I slept with both of their boyfriends on Saturday night.  I'm so happy. I just found out that I have been accepted into Harvard. And Yale. I don't know which to choose... oh, why is life so hard sometimes?  Last night I had to shave my entire body. Apparently, the lice that I caught from Amanda's friend are really hard to get rid of. I look quite strange with no hair and eyebrows. I'd post pictures, but my webcam is broken.  I want to tell the world to get fucked.  I am updating this journal for the first time in ages, because I've been in prison.  Today, I got a digital camera! Yes! Here's ten thousand photographs of my cat.  I want to say thanks to the world for absolutely fucking nothing! You all suck. I feel so alone, no one ever reads this journal, or even comments to let me know that I'm not suffering alone. It's cold here, and I want to die, but I cannot figure out how many of you to take with me when I go.  I went to the doctor yesterday, and he said I have a terrible skin disease which prevents me from coming into contact with other human beings. And bipolar disorder.  You should all do this quiz! It's amazingly accurate. You just put in your name and birthday, and it will tell you you're a moron.  That's enough for now. But I'll leave you with some naked photos of myself.

      The  urlLink Friday Five  isn't relevant today, but I saw this meme at  urlLink jewdez  and  urlLink The Go Fish  and liked it better.    Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 4. Write down what it says:  "Worth it, though!" She stroked my face like she was petting a kitten.  "It's a baby's bottom, is your face."   Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first?  The entertainment center   What is the last thing you watched on TV?  A PBS documentary about a fish   With the exception of the computer, what can you hear?  The TV, my kids playing outside, windchimes   When did you last step outside?  About 30 minutes ago   Before you came to this website, what did you look at?  My email   What are you wearing?  Shortie pajamas with bugs on them   Did you dream last night?  Not that I remember   When did you last laugh?  Last night   What is on the walls of the room you are in?  Paint   Seen anything weird lately?  Not weird enough for me to remember offhand   What do you think of this quiz?  Kind of random, random is good   What is the last movie you saw?  The Ring   If you became a multi-millionaire overnight, what would you buy first?  A car   Tell me something about you that I don't know.  I have psychic powers.   If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you do?  Every person would have a good home, a decent car and no worries about food or bills or lack of necessities.  And every person in the world would be provided healthcare.   Do you like to dance?  Yep  George Bush is he a power-crazy nut case or someone who is finally doing something that has needed to be done for years?  I don't think he is either.   Imagine your first child is a girl, what do you call her?  If it had been a girl, it would have been Sophia something.   Imagine your first child is a boy, what do you call him?  Don't have to imagine.  His name is Jaron.   Would you ever consider living abroad?  I consider it all the time, but it is more of a dream at the moment.

      Here lately I've still been in the mood to just read other peoples' journals and stay away from mine.  I haven't had many nice things to say lately.  The kids have been making me insane.  So, there has been a regime change here and they are grounded for the next 3 weeks.  I know, sounds harsh, but they have been hellions including at school and so far nothing has got their attention.  This will.  They will be grounded for 3 weeks and for every infraction there are days added to their "sentence".  They'll get the idea or they are in for a long and boring summer sitting in their rooms.  But hey, it'll be quiet around here!  I'm highly pissed off at my ex due to his not having sent my child support yet.  Even after I called him and informed him that we are out of everything and it's been a month and a half.  He just sends it whenever he wants to and expects that to be okay.  I guess I should be thankful that he sends it, but still.  He's not the one sitting here with 2 diapers, very little toilet paper, etc etc. Eric is as usual the bomb-diggety!  He got me Season One of Samurai Jack on DVD!  How cool is that??  But then again he's always cool.  *does the happy dance*  And now I am off to bed.  Bono's nachos, y'all.

      Well, here we are again, and it's been a week since my last update.  Blame Eric.  (well, hey, so long as it isn't me!  :p ) So, let's see.  Nothing exciting to report.  Haven't done anything other than the usual.  We've watched some good movies.  Ate some good food.  Had some good.... uhm.. fun.  Eric and I went to the end of year BBQ thingy for the Computer Science Math Geek depts the other night and it was pretty fun.  He's like a scholar and stuff!  I lurve geeks. I broke my toe.  That was fun.   The weight loss thing isn't going so quick.  I think I'm at 165 now which is where I THOUGHT I was before.  So, I'm basically back where I should have started.  NOW it's 20 pounds.  Or else I am not going to be seen in swimwear.  Hayull no.  I really need to get back to the Pilates thing every day.  Too bad I'm a lazy wench.  And a hungry one.  Sex makes me hungry.  Shouldn't the two cancel each other out?  It's exercise.  Right?  Hmph.   I changed my links over there to the right, for those of you who actually pay attention to such things.  I put it all on blogrolling so that it's not so big of a pain in the butt to update.   I had an invite today to join a pretty cool livejournal community.  Go over to  urlLink fallsgeeks  and check it out.  Of course, unless you're from Wichita Falls, it's not going to interest you a whole lot.   Well, what are you waiting for?  Go!  Move along.  Nothing to see here.

      What you should be listening to if you aren't already.  Michelle Lambert - I'm Fallin' Langhorne Slim - Counting Fireflies Carlos Santana & John Lee Hooker - Chill Out Lucinda Williams - ANYTHING she's done.  Fantastic. Loretta Lynn - Portland Oregon (The whole Van Lear Rose album really) Ryan Adams - La Cienega Just Smiled (HOLY SHIT, why am I just discovering this guy??  I am blown away)  I really wish I had a big ass server where I could upload this stuff and you guys could just download it.  But it is worth going out there and looking for.

      I am having chicken pot pie for breakfast.     "Deluge"  I'm watching the pouring rain   streaming down,   washing away everything in its path.   And I'm wishing that I could   step outside   and wash the memory of you   from my mind,   your touch from my body.   Instead,   I am flooded with images   of rainy days ,  bodies twined under the covers.   The downpour muffling   the sounds of love.   It occurs to me that I am glad   that removing your imprint on me   isn't something the rain can do,   rather   its purpose of nurturing   is to remind me of possibility.

      When the weather turns hot, as it does soon and often here in Texas, I rarely drink hot beverages. My dad has always said that if you are hot you should drink something hot and it will cool you down, and if you are cold drink something cold and it will warm you up. I always thought he was full of it. I mean, he is always coming up with insane, backwoods stuff like that and never once has it been credited. However, and forgive me because I forget where I read this, come to find out there has been scientific research done that proves his theory true. Of course, I haven't told HIM that. What brought that tidbit of information on was that the weather has been unseasonably cool and rainy here and I am sitting and drinking a cup of hot chai tea. Mmm. I haven't had any in months and had forgotten how good it is.   I haven't been doing as much posting as I keep telling myself I should here lately.  I keep my  urlLink book blog  updated somewhat more frequently, and yesterday I started a  urlLink flab to fab  blog.  I also have a  urlLink livejournal  but admit that it is only so that I can post and comment on some of my fave sites there and I don't ever really post anything on it. WHAT in the cornbread hell am I doing with so many blogs if I am not going to actually dedicate any time to updating them? Although, it's not like any one really reads them. They are mostly for my own venting/progress tracking (or lack thereof)/inane rambling. Such as I am doing now.   So, what has been going on lately, you ask? Well, let's see. This summer I've been back home to visit briefly. I thought I was going to get away with not going back for a while, but my Mamaw was dying so I had to get back. I spent another week there that time. The oldest two kidlets have been at their dad's a lot this summer, leaving me and the Willabeast here with not a whole heck of a lot to do. Other than her destroying things, and me cleaning up the messes. My youngest brother came and got my mom after the funeral so she is out in Georgia with him. I talked to her last night and she's ready to come home and wants me to come and get her. Which I would be more than glad to do if Jan (my ex-mil) would hurry up and get the car that she is giving me fixed. Yes, my ex-mother-in-law is GIVING me a car. It's a late 90s model Ford Contour (which oddly enough was mine in the first place, she took over payments when we bought a Grand Cherokee) and is in MUCH better condition than the hunk of shit on wheels that I am currently driving. I'm sure y'all have heard me bitching about not having an a/c and windows that will roll down. NOT a good combination in the good ol' Texas summertime. So, anyways, as soon as she gets some minor little things on the Contour fixed it is mine. Funnily enough, the day she went to buy her new car, the driver side window went out on the one she is giving me. It's like the damn thing KNEW. But, she's a good egg and it getting it fixed. And then I guess I will be road tripping it to Georgia. It's about a 13 hour drive from here. But, I don't mind as it will give me some alone time. I haven't been kid free in about 3 years, other than when I have had the various surgeries in the last couple of years. Those don't count as vacations. My brother wants me to move to Georgia. This will be a good opportunity to check it out and see if it's anywhere I'd want to live. Although, it has to be better than here. But, that's not saying much.   I can't really think of anything else of any interest that has been going on around here this summer. Well, other than the ex and his wife are starting up again with "the kids can come live with us and go to school over here if you think that's ok" bullshit. Yeah, just so you don't have to pay child support anymore. But, let's not get started on that particular rant at this time. It would take more time than I have tea for.

         Supplies:    Bowl of warm water with one squirt liquid hand soap, orangewood stick or stick with plastic tipped cuticle pusher, hand towel, emory board, 3 or 4-way buffer, Q-tips, polish remover, base coat (Stickey by Creative or similar), polish of your choice, top coat, UV nail dryer.        Soak      fingertips in bowl of warm, soapy water for 3 or 4 minutes.      Remove      from water and using orangewood stick or cuticle pusher, gently push      cuticles back.    Rinse.    Dry with hand towel, pushing cuticles      back with towel.  File      edges of nails with emory board, going in one direction.    Dont saw back and forth as it tears the      nail.  Buff      nails using 3 or 4-way buffer, following steps numbered on buffer.  Rinse      hands to remove residue.    Dry      thoroughly.  Dip      Q-tip in polish remover and rub over each nail.  Apply      thin layer of base coat.    Let set      one minute.  Apply      two thin coats polish, waiting one minute between coats.  Apply      thin layer of top coat.  Place      hands under UV dryer for several minutes until set.               Useful tips:    Store nail polish in refrigerator.    Remove and let reach room temperature before using.    Roll polish bottle between your palms, never shake it.    Dont polish your nails under an a/c vent or fan.    Dont change your polish more than once a week or your nails will dry out.       Keep in mind this deals with the nails only. There are many more extras that you can do to keep your hands and feet looking great. Lotion is a must. A foot scrub or sloughing lotion massaged onto feet keeps them smooth. Pumice stones aren't a good idea as they really only make the skin tougher.      This post was inspired by a post over on livejournal on the hip_domestics forum. I realized that many people don't know the proper steps to follow for a professional manicure.
