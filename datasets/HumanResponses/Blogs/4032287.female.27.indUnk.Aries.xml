      I'm the mother of a one-year old. A beautiful, intelligent, energetic, feisty, affectionate, mischievous one-year old.  McKenna's birthday party went wonderfully. Thank to the help of my parents (and their S.O.'s), Erick's parents, my sister and brother-in-law, and our friend Sherri....we pulled together a very fun and creative party. All through the day I thought of how much work (not to mention money and time) everyone put into this day. I thought of how far people traveled to be there. I thought of the traffic people had to endure (apparently an exceptionally bad traffic day in So Cal today). I thought of the nap schedules and potty-training that had to be juggled. The time people took to pick out just the right present (and boy did she hit the motherload!) All of this to celebrate the first birthday of my little girl. And I felt blessed. I really am. To have so many people who love my little girl so freely that they would give so much of themselves for this special day. What a wonderful thing. I love McKenna with all of my heart and I am so grateful that she has so many people in her life who love her as well.  Thank you to everyone who helped to make this day special.   urlLink Here is a link to the pictures from her party!

      Here are a couple pics from the past few days I wanted to share.  She got this car for her birthday. She thinks its one she can ride so she sits on it and puts her feet up and we push her around the living room. She thinks its the most fun. Crazy kid.     Wearing Daddy's sunglasses (with her bruise she looks like a real bad ass):     The picture we used for her thank you cards. It said "Thank you  fairy  much!"     And my friend Amy made the most beautiful "siggy" for the messageboard that I'm on:     Other noteables: I learned an important lesson this week. Don't be ruled by the clock. A month or so ago, McKenna stopped acting tired until she'd been awake for 4 hours and I assumed this was a natural part of getting older and more active. So every day I'd been waiting until she'd been awake for 4 hours to put her down for her nap, no matter what. Well the past week she has just been such a bear after only 2 or 3 hours. So I put her down for her nap today after only 2 hours (and after finally realizing that she does give sleep cues now) and the kid napped like a champion all day long. I'd been letting her get overtired and as a result she had been cranky and napping poorly.   Oh well, lesson learned.

      Whew! This is one of those weeks that really challenges a mother's patience! McKenna has been extra fussy and clingy. She not only wants to be held by me constantly but she is just fussing and whining so much and I can't figure out what she needs. But as I understand it, this is a normal thing for a one year old - to have a need and to be frustrated that she doesn't know how to communicate it.   On top of that, I think there might be something to the fact that after the MMR shot, about a week later I noticed that mine as well as some of my friends' babies go through an extremely fussy time. Which makes sense because it is, after all releasing small amounts of disease into their bodies.   And on top of THAT, McKenna's 7th tooth finally broke through and her 8th one is right at the surface. Her back gums look swollen too but only time will tell if her molars are coming through.   And on top of THAT, she has been getting hurt SO often lately! The other day she tripped and hit her cheek on the bookshelf (big bruise on the cheek). Then she tripped and scraped her face on the entertainment center (scratch from her forehead to her lip). Then she fell and hit her head on the cement pavement outside (bump and cut on her head). Then she bumped her head against my tooth (bruise on her forehead). Then she stepped on a sliver of glass that was in our carpet (bleeding foot). AAAAH! Poor kid! Aside from the glass, the falling is all normal for a one-year old. She's getting more confident with walking but she still has to work on balance and depth perception. So many one year olds go through a klutzy phase.  So even though she is very frustrated lately, I am enjoying her non-whiny clingy moments. She is a very affectionate little girl and sometimes she just wants me to sit on the floor with her so she can sit on my lap or give me kissies. And really, I can't deny that its still a pretty wonderful way to spend my day.

      McKenna had her one year doctor appointment today (which is neat since August 3 was her due date). It went great! First of all, she was quite smart by being extra cute and saying hi to every nurse that walked by. So that when it came time to give her the shot, they actually drew straws to see who would have to stick her because no one could bring themselves to do it. And boy did she get pissed about those shots. By the time the doctor saw her she was hungry and tired as it was. And then she was pissed when he checked her ears. And so to get stuck once in each arm and once in the toe really set her off. They did the toe one first and had to squeeze it to get blood into the little tube. So that took a couple minutes and the whole time McKenna kept growling at the nurse. Then she got the arm shots and she cried and cried.  Anyway, the doctor said she's doing excellent and is actually very advanced for her age with all her developmental milestones.  She weighs 20 lbs. 3 oz. (40th percentile) and is 28 inches (25th percentile). He said she's reached her biological niche which translated means - she'll be built like me.  She can eat everything that we eat as long as its in baby-sized bites and easy to mash with her jaws. But we are still avoiding chokeables such as full-sized grapes or popcorn. And we are avoiding nuts and shellfish because of the high allergy factor.  She is completely on whole milk now (about 18-21 oz. a day) and also drinks a combo of 5 oz. water/5 oz. juice once a day. She takes vitamins every morning and eats very balanced meals. She definitely prefers veggies to anything else - especially peas, carrots and green beans. She eats 3 meals and 1-2 snacks a day.  She's completely off the bottle now and drinks only from a cup. She walks about 90% of the time and has many words in her vocabulary already (though most are still said in baby speak....i.e. bubble is bubb or Auntie is ah-tee). My favorite thing that she does is says hi to everyone she sees. She's like a tiny little greeter and whenever we're in public we get stopped several times. We really enjoy it though. McKenna loves people and we love watching her with people. We're very proud of our social butterfly.  I'm also loving how easily she goes down for naps and bedtime now. I used to have to give her a bottle until she fell asleep and then at night put her in the crib. But for naps she would only sleep on the couch. But now we have a routine where we read a book by the light of her nightlite, turn off the nightlite, sing "Stay Awake" from Mary Poppins (I used to sing this to her in the womb and when she was first born) and then lay her in the crib. Then she says "Nye Nye" and goes to sleep. If she's not ready to sleep she turns on her ocean aquarium all by herself and watches and talks to that until she falls asleep on her own. What a welcome change from the old routine!  Hmmm, what else. Erick is on vacation from August 2-12. So we're really enjoying all the family time. We alternate who wakes up with McKenna in the morning and the other one gets to sleep until 9am. And we alternate who gives her dinner/bath/story/bedtime each night and the other gets to have some extra free time. We're sharing all the chores and getting lots and lots of play time with McKenna. Its so nice. I wish life could be like this all the time.  Oh, the neighborhood kids were unable to make it to McKenna's bday party so they threw her a mini party on Sunday. We had a mini cake left over from the party the day before and we used some of the decorations left over as well. The girls dressed up in their party dresses and we gave them goodie bags and they brought McKenna presents. Then afterward we all went swimming. Here they are just before singing happy birthday to McKenna.
