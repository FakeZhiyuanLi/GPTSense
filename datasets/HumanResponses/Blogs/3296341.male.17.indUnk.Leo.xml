      When a room is dim, there tends to be a reason for the lack of light.  Generally a bulb has blown or not enough lights are in the room, but when you replace a bulb you once again brighten things up; the shadows are crisper and the light is more clear.  Just like when you add a new light to a space, it takes away the darkness in the same way.  In the exact same sense, when you're feeling dim, in order to brighten things up you need to replace the broken things with new, and add more light to your life!!!  I'm a snazzy blue light, 100 watts bright bitch :-D

      The weather by the mountains fails to keep in sync with any pattern.  The coastal winds bring in the rain, the storms, the heat of summers' days.  But for all the coast's efforts all it's torrential plans get smashed into the mountain sides.  That's why on a mid-winter morning the clouds will be pouring snow and stacking ice, and then by the time the sun's at peak the clouds will have gone away.  By late afternoon the same day the thaw of snow and ice will flood the town full.  And come morning of the morrow the only hints of the prior day's fall will be the wet stains upon the asphalt of the roads.  Likewise on the brink of Summer's months, as the past eve's warmth has felled the cold and the spring blossoms have quelled any remnants winter's mood, a torrent of rain will come from a clear night sky.  The stars will pour out their hearts and soak everything for but a moment, then as quick as it came the sobbing sky will dry it's eyes and move on.  The entire time, every star of the sky was present.  Apollo's belt was full, his sword and legs were strong, Ursa kept her major and her minor all night long.  Pisces jumped from the water's depths and landed every time, not a star missed a beat, they throbbed the mountain-side song.  And the weather of the valleys and the foothills stays the same, so un-earthly strange.

      I have not, until today, ever become sick so rapidly and so thoroughly.  Feeling sick, still horribly angry at everything, and now feeling abandoned as well.  Nothing inciteful today, too fucked up to think.  My mind is swimming around.

      Strong emotions are baseless half the time, and the other half the time their based on the baseless strong emotions of someone else.  I know my brain right now, is fucked up beyond belief, since half the time I'm sitting still I'm thinking, hate hate hate.  Since I've said I hate just about everything, and most of all myself, I wonder now, and how that comes about.  I don't seem to be incited by a massless rage, but I am caged, locked in this anger, this depression by my brain.  My brain points out to me and twists my thoughts about, so that everything I see, I hate hate hate hate hate, and most of all about myself.  It's curious that half the time I hate I realize... It's not so much the hate that burns me, more the worthless witless people near, that don't know what it's like.  But since I know in fact, they probably do... It burns me even more to know that fact is true.  Finals approach, it's like that impending doom you see in cartoons, except with horns and a crooked-ass halo.

      That grey or black plain that stretches forever if you find the right path, is a fabulous place to play.  I find that I desire the means to roll about unnecessarily, but just for fun.  So many scoffs that thrill seekers get, I never do enjoy.  Most of these people live lives that never exceed the bounds of their home, or 55 miles per hour in a 55 zone.  Have you felt the possibility of losing control, to face your fate, your mortality, and experience speed.  Why do they make amusement parks, with roller coasters, spinning, rotating, gyrating rides, if such things weren't fun?  It's obvious to me that something in us, as humans enjoys our bodies being put the limits of speed and acceleration and the feeling of getting thrown around without being hurt.  I scoff back at those who can't seem to escape from the 55 zone, it's a sad way to live... so controlled.  This summer is going to be full of work and lacking much in the way of play.  One of the employees at the library quit and they're not hiring anyone new, so Dan and I have to fill in the hours until they figure out what to do in the fall.  At least it should be a substantial amount of money.

      A fabulous investment of my time was made today.  Following the suggestion of an associate of mine I proceeded to the City Municipal Building, walked through the main doors, and took a left.  There, as I was told I would, I found the Commissioner of Revenue for the City of Bedford.  She appeared to be a nice lady and readily asked if there was anything which I needed help with.  She showed me a technological wonder that reminds me of spy movies but is engineered for taxation reference purposes.  She then directed me up the road not but two dozen steps to the city Museum.  At the Museum I was assisted further and brought to a file of information containing EXACTLY what I wanted.  For ten minutes of research I was rewarded with the greatest amount of information I could've asked for.  The most amusing thing about this: I have been in neither building since I was conscious of what they were, until today.  I find that Bedford is more useful than I had before perceived, and that the warm downtown city is actually a bustling little town full of life, activity, and information during the day.  Why is it then that as a student I am normally unable to experience the city that I have lived in since I was born?  No wonder people are so ready to move away, they don't realize what is at home.  This weariness is once again crawling throughout me.  With the pressures of life that have driven my hairs gray I am once more fatigued.

      While running for the first time in months I nearly stumbled over a stray cat.  He or she, or whatever it may have been was enjoying a good roll in the grass and clover.  I stopped to observe the carefree creature and it paid me no mind.  It just continued it's joyous rolling in the comfy clover.  What a beautiful thing, a stray cat, possibly ready to starve the next morning, just enjoying a few moments of rolling around.  I like to think I roll around every now and then.  Let's just remember that everyone once in a while, regardless of how we might be, we should observe the stray cat and take heed, everyone needs a good roll.  What an interesting occurance that twice in one day I have served as the friend of a friend in need and at least twice more as a friend in need of the friends who heed.  Two times tonight and it'll be three.

      Why green for LCDs, when twisted relay screens are color free? Why tubular for TV sets that havn't met the flattened ones? Can you see the electron beam, sent from the back to the front of the screen? But the flat, colored, CRTs are complicated, confusing me... I like the block-style cursor, blinking, waiting for a further answer My calcumalator is a handy dandy thing, I use it to build big dancing ring I hit the keys on the number pad thing, and my score tallies up to be three million and three I'm dancing around the CRT of my computer screen, yipping with glee for the green calculator thing, Why? Giddy laughing, Because I won baby, easy as one, two, seven.  And I feel the brick of tired hit my face with full force, and I am unable to resist the sweet remedy of sleep.

      So I sat, and long I considered the thoughts that came to mind as they presented themselves.  The rubber shards that bounced down my leg and skipped through my leg hairs like a game of plinko on the Price is Right.  The grass which I must wonder about, it is born from it's shell, grown, and matured in the same place.  After maturation it is trimmed repeatedly, and dies so that new grass can grow in it's place.  What if someone plucks a blade of grass from it's resting place, regardless of the fact that it does not have a central nervous system, does that life carry the emotion of pain without the physical side?  We see emotion present itself in animals and sometimes the behavior of plants reflects the idea of emotion, so are we so good and mighty that we can pick blades of grass whenever we want just because there's nothing they can do to stop us?!  The madness... I'm actually talking about current foreign affairs, it's just a deeply embedded metaphor that no one would've picked up on If I hadn't pointed it out.  Okay wait... no Metaphor... I lose.  Life has taken interesting turns of late for me, Anna and I have become closer friends again, I've started playing piano again after a long period of frustration with the instrument, Some people I used to hate I now tolerate with a moderate fondness, Some people I used to enjoy I now dislike, I care for little of what goes on anymore as well.  Ok so not so much interesting.

      Fathom the phantom bliss in your soul, Embrace the mirage but do not approach It's only a phantasm for breaking hearts A fantastic fallacy dreamed to behold The chimera of sweets and generosity is bounded by feats of general animosity Though my animus is all about dreaming The haunts of the umbra of that which is me Are coming to be in whole quite giddy And dissolving with the illusory city.  Cooking is good, and so is raspberry tea, and night time biking.

      When your friends say you're shit, you know When hatred seethes through you're teeth When a random man can see your worst it's true You're failing life, you oughta feel blue Like a bomb of ocean water blowing up in monochrome azure That's the feeling in your gut When it's time to be giving up Feeble attempts to read your mind Come up shorter than mine.  And it sucks.
