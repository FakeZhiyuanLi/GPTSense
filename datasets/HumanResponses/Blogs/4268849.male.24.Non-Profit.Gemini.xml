      Sunday was interesting, Kim and I headed west on the 10 and missed the Fairfax exit. Not a big deal but a usual me kinda thing to do. Following one more wrong turn we parked at  urlLink the Grove  (btw-their website is a useless waste of time and bandwidth).  I'd never seen a parking structure before that told me exactly how many spaces were left on each floor, but this one did. I'd hate to drive in and find out that only one space remained in the entire structure on level four, how in the world would I find it? Could I be certain it existed? Quandary left behind, we took the stairs down several floors.    My first impression, as the double Decker trolley passed us by, was a distinct " urlLink Disneyland - Main Street USA " feeling. However, the kids and parents in T-shirts holding Disneyland merchandise bags were replaced with an interesting mix of people. At one end of the Grove we found  urlLink the Original Farmers Market , having been there many times as a kid it was neat to see it intact despite the neighboring development. Somehow I doubt the Grove would be worth anything without the farmers market.    Farmer's Market has a long Los Angeles history, including one tidbit that peaks my interest, according to  urlLink an internet source , Walt Disney sat at a Farmers Market table while he designed Disneyland. Knowing a little bit about municipal government makes curious about the Grove development history as it relates to the Farmers Market, but some quick searches didn't turn anything up.    We actually didn't stay too long, I was very paranoid about failing to find any deodorant in the morning. Whether my perception of my perspiration and potential for BO was accurate or not didn't matter, I was distraught nonetheless. After fruitlessly searching for a  urlLink Bath &amp; Body Works (which Kim swore was there but it wasn't listed on the directory!) we headed across the street to  urlLink Kmart . Once there we picked up deodorant, water and gum. It was at that point that Kim got a call from Amy, who needed some coffee time alone with Kim. Since we'd seen the sights we headed home. While heading through the Grove toward the car we spotted the elusive Bath and Body Works took a picture of Kim at the koi pond (middle picture above) and went to the car.  If we'd had time, a quick walk over to the  urlLink Tar Pits  would have finished things off nicely (hey, who'd notice BO over there anyway?). Plus it might have shed some light on the various "methane" alarms found throughout the grove for Kim, who couldn't seem to remember seeing them. Now how could you notice Bath and Body, but not notice methane alarms?

      So apparently according to  urlLink The ULTIMATE personality test  I'm a "protector". I'll ask Kim later if he agrees as well as find out what he is. Somehow I don't think his will turn out to be "protected".

      So once again on a Friday night Kim and I traveled to  urlLink Disneyland .  After a quick stop to get some sunglasses (very useful on those hot sunny SoCal evenings), we stepped into Disneyland and grabbed food over at  urlLink the Plaza Inn . We generally eat over at  urlLink the Pizza Port  so while this was a change for us I still went for the pasta.  We had an enjoyable time at  urlLink Haunted Mansion  and while I was able to successfully show Kim the hidden mickey I'd found on  urlLink Winnie the Pooh , we were unsuccessful in discovering any more.    Our people watching and walking around included a stop over by  urlLink Dumbo .    We couldn't resist the photo op.  Generally the thing I notice most at the end of a long day are the parents and kids who get quite tired. The 'grumpiness' factor really begins to build up and suddenly you'd think these people were heading over  urlLink Donners Pass , kids kicking and screaming, parents yelling. I only mention this because there was one woman who had quite a few kids with her and yet at 11 at night she was happy. The kids seemed tired, but not cranky, and the mom (?) was quite chipper. They were heading for the exit but I just wonder how many people actually leave with the good attitude.  After accidentally passing the  urlLink moon of endor  yet again, we headed home.

      Over the last two weeks Kim has known that we will be traveling *somewhere* for his birthday. I told him to plan nothing between the time he gets out of work Saturday and Sunday night. I then took the weekend plans and sealed pieces of them in three envelopes. One he opened the Thursday prior, it told him what to pack. Saturday when I picked him up from work he was excited, his second envelope told him we'd be getting on a United Airline plane over at LAX.    Here our shadows are waiting for a shuttle at LAX parking Lot "C". The bus almost didn't make it to the terminal, it actually started to stall heading up a ramp. It was pretty darn funny. Once at the terminal Kim opened his final envelope and then he found out we'd be flying to San Francisco. I think he was excited.  Once at SFO, it was getting late, we took BART one whole stop to Milbrae where our hotel was. Finding it was fun, we walked the wrong way on Milbrae and wont up taking an evening stroll before we figured out where the hotel really was. The room was nice and the room service was fast.  We checked out in the morning and took BART into town. After walking by the beautiful SF City Hall we proceeded down Hyde Street.   Here is Kim on Russian Hill with the Golden Gate bridge behind him (this is a composite of two pictures taken with different exposures, my cam phone doesn't do contrast well). We also walked a little way down the curved part of Lombard, but quickly turned back around because we'd already climbed too many hills.    Here we are once we completed the climb down Russian Hill, which is behind Kim.     This is the obligatory picture of me.    Here is Kim at Fisherman's Wharf with the famous Sea Lions and Forbes restaurant in the background.    Eventually we headed back to the airport to catch our flight home, none too soon either, we were both pretty tired. The "printer" was broken and our pilot complained that they had to do everything by hand which delayed us about 30 minutes. Once we were home cake and candles awaited at Kim's parent's house. Bye bye teen years Kim, now you're officially 20-something!  Overall it was a very fun weekend, next year should be even more fun because Kim's turning 21 . . .
