      Well lately I have been tired (as usuall) and I have not even done much. Still havent talked to Rhae...I havent talked to much of anyone for that matter.  ( That too is probably my fault) I have been obssesed with watching the complete first season of "Rocky and Bulwinkle and Friends". I have also been over playing Halo agian and am getting boared with it cause I can not seem to make it far with out dying...ON NORMAL! That is actually weird cause if I do say so myself I am pretty good at it. I have also not been able to sleep. That is kinda same ol same ol stuff though.... My current music is "Fallen away from me" by Korn... I like them. I whent through a weird period were I loved korn, then hatd them, now I like them... They have fun angery white guy music ^_^ When ever I am mad, they are one of the bands I definatly listen to, to help blow off steam.( Alnog with Slipknot, Mudvayne, and a few others that I can not remember...) So today I went to my aint Esters house to do yard work...While cutting grass I seem to have a nice felling as if I was happy cleaning and doing work. I usually do not do that. The same thing happened last night were I had a sudden urge to clean the living room so I folded cloths and cleaned up decently. My room has also been unusaully clean as well, but I am happy with that because I feel nice inside. ............I also feel a bit closer to my Dad. I think that is a good thing. I can no longer say I hate him. (that is good cause  if I hate someone that is not good cause I hate few people) If  he could just work out the whole....... yelling thing . And maybe knock on my door. That would help me out alot. I think I am emotionally scared fer life cause of my Dad's yelling. I can not stand when people yell...  Last night I also had a weird dream. It had to do with Harry Potter. I remember a horse with a clown face, and its makeup had halfmoons undernieth the Eyes... and It turned out to be Dumbledor was spying on us. (Suprise, Suprise!) The rest is a little hard to describe on line ^_^  Once again that is it for now...

      (I am really starting to hate this computer!) Ok...So lately I have been a little edgy. But thats ok, and for those who actually care enough to visit, I am sorry that I have not been posting, things around here have been a little bit crazy for me right now, and it is a little hard to explain... Anyway! Sunday (and/or Monday) I talked to Rhae and that is allways enjoyable cause she has a really pretty voice. But I had to go clean and it is a little hard for me to clean, talk to her, and listen to my sister bitch. So I told her that I would call back between 7-7:30.  So I passed out on the couch and then woke up a little before 7. So I called her. I was informed that she was not home and was asked if I would like to leave a message. I told her to tell Rhae that I called and to call me back whenever she got home or as soon as she can.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also in a bit of a hard space cause I really want to see her but cant. (I also feel she may be mad at me for something) could be not calling her more, which is my fault, but it is also really hard to get to the phone sometimes. I have also not been allowed on the computer as much so...Yeah. (I NEED MY OWN COMPUTER!)  I also have not been to the Doctor in about a month, and I really need to go. I have also realized that I have been going to see him for twice a month every month for a year strieght. ( I dunno if that is good or bad)  Also people have a strange way of showing emotion and to piss me off all in one swift move. Like when I ask for a ride somewhere I get bitched at so I feel bad for going off, my sister has also picked up this trait. So I do not like asking to go anywhere anymore because I do not want to get bitched at. (But that is inevitable) I also do not have a licence (NOT MY FAULT!) for that fact I do not even have a learners.... ANYWAY!  I also spoke to Tonio a couple of nights ago...That is always fun cause he knows exactly where I have been and I know the same...I think... I just hope he dose not do anything drastic cause alot of people will be VERY SAD! ( dont ask why I capitolized it all)  What else has been going on. I have also been feeling a bit sick lately. I am not sure why, I do not have anything to be guilty of, and I have not been sleeping&nbsp; properly. I wake up like three times a night again. I haven't woken up that much since school because I was so streesed out. ( and I dont think I am streesed...)  I also talked to Tiffany the other night...(Monday night concerning that was my last post.) That was a very interesting conversation. She really knows her vedio game stuff...She also said I am #2 on things she is most scared of ^_^  Well that is all I have to complain about for now...&nbsp; I feel depresed.

      Well... The past couple-o-days were alright. I finally got this desk into my room, beat Legacy of Kain: Defiance (really good game), watched movies that have been over-watched (Spaceballs, and the Austin Powers Trilogy) and am in the last chapter of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. This Morning Rhae called and we talked fer a few hours. And that was fun cause I got to talk to her. thats about it besides me talking to other people... and playing over-played games.

      Ok, so I started to actually write in my journal for the first time in a month. (^_^)&nbsp;I am also staying the night (even though we really did not sleep at all) over one of meh best bud's house. (Theo) and it has felt like forever since we talked.&nbsp; So when I first arrived here I was really hyper. We are also planning to go to the mall with a bunch of people. That is going to be alot of fun cause I am going to see folk that I have not seen in a long time. ANYWAY! I have also been playing the game Legacy of Kain: Defiance. It is a really fun game. I have also recently played Qudditch on PS2 ( I have to buy it on XBOX!). &nbsp;Well that is really all I have to say for now...   (PS. It might be a while before I am going to post anything on acount that I do not know when the next time I am going to get on the computer is again... sorry) -_-    &nbsp;  Checked by  urlLink Rhae

      Well, today I went to Busch Gardens. It was fun and I was really proud of myself because I got onto Apollo's chariot, Alpengeiste, and Lochness Monster&nbsp; ^_^  And now I have a rash that kinda hurts in a place that shall go nameless.  That is all I really have to say for the sheer fact that I am kinda tired right now.  OH! I think I found a new favorite movie... Last night I saw the movie  Underworld. &nbsp; It was great...

       Well, this is my first journal entry in a long time period (I usually write in a notebook but hey whatever!).  Anyway, I cannot seem to get along with anyone (probably just my sister and dad) over here. And naturally my sister makes a comment about how "I am mean and talk about her behind her back".  She is also really lazy... I tell her she has to do her work, because mom said. And she ends up watching a movie and sitting on her butt!   She has also recently been going on about her cellphone which also pisses me off because when I asked for one just last year my mom said I was to young to have one. So I dont get jack squat and my sister is a total jerk and gets a phone!  *sigh* But I am used to this because it happens all the time.   I have also been very proud of myself cause I have cleaned my room up to the highest standerd possible and am keeping it so.    (Wow this music is relaxing).   I am also in a bit of a...what's the word...rut when it comes to my thoughts because I am trying to think of stuff to draw but can not think, and it is also the same way for my comic...(even though I know what I want to happen I cannot seem to convey the thought properly).  I have also felt a little lonely... I miss a lot of people and I rarely see Rhae because I live relativly far away. And I do not see my regular folk as much cause school is out. (And once again I live farther away from my friends). So it is for this reason that I cannot wait for school to start but I also don't want it to start because it is my last year there...before I am cast out unwillingly into what people call "The Real World."   Well that is everything I can think of to rant on about for now...    ..(-_-)..    Checked by  urlLink Rhae

      Ok, some of these questions are a little...PERSONAL... But not all of them. All I ask is if you do answer these questions please answer truthfully. If a question is a little too much, please put "N/A". I would also prefer it to be put under anonymous (that way things will not spread around). The only way I will accept a name, is if I know who you are and I know you will not be offended. Thank you ^_^  (I will try and update this as I come up with questions... I will also substitute words but hopefully you will get the gist of what is being asked, and I do not ask anything that I myself have not answered).  1) If you could be any 4 people from Final Fantasy 7 though 10, who would you be based on you personality?

(And invisible people DO NOT COUNT!)  3) If you could be a combination of any two villains (with the exception of Sephiroth), what two people would you be?  4) What is the weirdest thing you have ever thought of (if you do) when you take care of yourself?  5) what is your religouse belief?   6) What is your favorite music band?

      Well the purpose (or one of them) to start this site is for the simple fact that I have to vent sometimes... And also to post my comic once I can find out how. So for all of my friends who read this and who are easily offended... Please do not be mad, upset, scornful, or any of the above pissed moods. I also want to find out how people react to my comments, questions, art wrok, and meh comic.   SO with that out of the way I hope you folks enjoy reading my site and please COMMENT! I need the tips with my art (which I will post as soon as I can).   (^_^)    Checked by  urlLink Rhae

      Alot of people seem to be in bad moods. I wonder what is up...(AND WHY ARE PEOPLE PRESISTANT ON WORKING MY NERVES!)  Well, Yesturday I whent over Theo's house and we played Pokemon. That was fun. Then Chris woke up and we played winback...That too was fun.  When I got home Steve wanted me to stay the night so I did. (My foot is killing me still)  I also found out that on the 25 I might be going to Busch Gardens again... yay!  Then Last night around midnight we watched Kill Bill Vol. 2.  It was really good but I think Vol.1 is better.  not because it was more bloody...but because it seemes more interesting to me. Vol 2 though did have alot more dialouge that I could  not really hear casue we had to have the TV turned down really low. I also watched the movie Min in Black 2...It was better than I expected...  Then around 3 I came home and whent right to my room cause, me and my parents are changing rooms.  At 6:30 I had a doctors appointment. I think it whent well...But afterwards I seemed a bit depressed for some reason...the thing that piss' me off most though is the fact that I had just finished venting...some.  We then went to dinner at Rancho Grande...after wards I felt sick and still feel a bit sick in the stomach!  And now I am online just talking to Rhae...I really hope I can see her this weekend. That would make me so happy!  I haven't felt happy in a long time. Sure I "act happy" but I'm not really. It is kinda sad.  Also I can't wait for school to start because I miss people.  Concerning I cant drive, I seem to not be able to go or see people that I want to. Only way I can seem to see people is if they drive, and that makes me feel a little bad because there are a load of people I can't see. (I need my lisence...but I keep failing  or people wont take me!)  I have also been venting in my journal alot more. but I want to know why lately, after I finish venting in my notebook or to other people...why do I still feel depressed.  The Doctor had asked me to define my depression. I told him "It is where I have no real emotion. I am not happy, sad, angery, anything. I am in the middle of it all. So I mood swing." he then told me I seem more pesamistic than optimistic. That is not good. He then asked me what I can do to help myself be alittle more happier. I told him the same thing I tell him everytime he asks that question...  Random ranting...  If "verb is what you do" is there an anti-verb for the lazy people?  If she wrote the murder...Why dosn't she change what happens in the story?   It isn't the size of the mushroom...it's how it's eaten.  If we are the smartest animal on the planet...then how come we are  are the only animals that rage war?   Do other animals try to take over the world?  Are we the only animals driven by sex?  WHY DO WE HAVE TO HAVE FEELINGS!?  Why do we have a desire to be accepted?  Why do we long for compnionship?  Is there a such thing as "Love"?  Is love all you need?  Why are people the acception to the "it is the cycle of nature for animals to kill other animals." rule?  Why do people actually for Best Friend realationships with other people.  WHY DO I ALWAYS GET THROWN IN THE MIDLLE OF EVERYTHING!?  Has being different become a fad?  Why is pink the new black?  Is being normal different?  Are we so insecure with ourselves that we will change our personal apperance, or follow the crowd just for acceptance?  Dose this appear in anyother culture, or animal society?  well I think that is all for now.     *sigh*

      Well I am feeling better...I am just super tired and I took a nap. also once again sickness...I probably ate a little too much.  Anyway. I am also getting tired of listining to Tom McGraws voice...   *sigh* like I said though I am feeling better I talked to folk and I kinda cleared my head. So I am thankful.    While I was thinking though...(more like after the first four games of solitare.) I thought that I MIGHT stop updating  this site for a while and just start writing in my Notebook...I think. The decision hasnt been made yet. Even though it is nice that my friends can see how I am feeling on a daily basis.  Once again I still have too think. So if I do not update for a while people do not fear...I am fine...      (^_^)  I guess...  Onto random ranting of the moment...  If the Beastie Boys are like 40 years old...How come they are not Beastie Men?  If a shark crossbreeds with a monkey would it be called a Mark...or a shunkey?  If a woman has the excuse of PMS for mood swinging...What do men get?   IF people really do suck...How come there is not as much sex in the world?  IF People are ass'...why are there no half-people, half-donkey people?    Why isn't our house as blessed as others when my Dad is always saying "God Bless it!"?  Why is there no Animal Olypics?   If there are alot of populare bands...How come I don't like any of them?  Why did Eminem name himself after candy?   Was he born Eminem and the candy was named  after him?   Dose he have a soft chocolate inside?  Since God gives the gift of life, and then takes it back...Dose that make him an Indian giver?  Were is the Blue Man Group from?   Did God make TV?   If so did Satan make commercials?   Why do parents tell children babys come from the stork...Why not a pidgeon...or Robert DeNiro?   Why are people stupid enough to be contolled by plants?  Who is smarter...People or plants?   Why didn't God give dog apposable thumbs?   What would Miss Piggy's and Kirmit the Frog's baby look like?   If they got married would Miss Piggy be called Miss Piggy the Frog?  If Britney Spears was never on Micky mouse Club would she still be famiouse?  If Mickey Mouse was actually named Mortamer mouse would she still have joined Mortamer Mouses Club?   What was Jane addicted to?   What was simple about the plan?   well now that they are not getting funny any more... Thats it for now....I will post whenever I do... Caio!

      For some reason right now I feel really depressed.  Is it from thinking too much? possibly.  From Jealasy? It is likely. Bad Food? Heh, doubt it.  Whatever reason it is this time around I can not seem to shake it.  I took a shower and that did not help me. I seemed to think more, and more.  I have realized over the past 2 days or so...That I seem to be the sidekick.  I am like Tetsouo to Kanada in Akira. Knuckles to Sonic in Sonic. And so on, and so on.  Right now I guess the best way to say how I am really feeling...I feel a lot like Raziel in Soul Reaver Defiance. There is some force working hard against me, that is keeping me from reaching my goal. The Harder I struggle the harder I fall back to were I started...It is one vicouse sycle. I do not know what is causing these feelings...I just know they are here.  there is also noone that I can really talk to about this either. That is probably one of the more depressing things about this... *sigh* I think I am actually jelouse a bit. But the only person I have to blame is myself...Yes, IT IS ALL MY FAULT! I let myself learn emotion. I let things happen to me. IT IS ALL MY DAMN FAULT!

      Okay...so last night  I actually wrote in my notebook journal. That notebook has more...Personal information in it that I probably would not put online. So I probably stayed up until like 1:00  writing and pasting pictures inside it. ( the only people I need to paste inside it is a pic of Rhae ( like that will ever happen) and one of Greg...then that would complete the notebook and I can move on to the next note book journal...I think...  I also forgot to call Rhae and I feel terible about it...I keep saying that I will call her...But I am not trying to make excuses so I am just going to stop that right there.   Last night Mike and Sheryl came over last night...and we played some DOA3 and Capcom vs SNK EO 2...that was alot of fun.  Until he left then I did nothing but watch Blue collar Tv and think. (There's some good news...) BUT THE SWOLLING ON MY FOOT WENT DOWN!  But Once again I have been a bit depressed and feeling like I am going to Vomit all over the place. (there is a nice mental image)  But something is keeping me going...and it is not Drawing this time...and venting by writing it out hasnt helped me much either.   *sigh* I wish I was an anime character...they look like so much fun to be... and so care free.  OH WELL!

      Well... The past few days has been cool...Night before last I talked to Rhae, Amanda, Theo, and Greg.  That was fun...I have been deep in thought so I got some stuff off my chest that I have been thinking about alot lately.   Greg had also invited me to the beach yesturday were I spraned my foot skimboarding. But it was still fun.   So...Last night I came home around 10:00 and then I talked to Rhae for alittle while. Then I whent to bed around 11.   When I woke up this morrning I noticed my foot was badly bruised...so today I have spent most of the time playing Pokemon. and trying to stay off my foot. ( I cant wait to go skimboarding again)  (^_^)   Well that is all I have to say for now....

      Well here is a story that has Dede in it... It is actually before the comic I started. It  takes place before Dede gets to where she is at her mothers house.   (Sorry in advance if there are typos.)              The  Kid Napping  	Dede was a little six year old girl, from Louisiana, with long black hair. She had a little stuffed fox who was with her all the time. 	One day she was dropped off  at the park with her friend Dean, “Want more tea Dean? What about you Stan? Not in a talking mood...eh?” 	“Nope!” Dean sharply replied, and the stuffed animal, named Stan, sat in the little pink chair with an empty daisy cup in front of it. “What is that Stan? Some one is calling me?” Dede turned around and saw a tall, distinguished looking man in front of her.  	“ Hello Dede, dear. How are you today?”  	 “GRANDPA!” She screamed as she jumped into his arms. “Do you want to have some tea with me, Dean, and  Stan?”  	Dean blurted out, “Hi!” as soon as Dede finished the sentence.  	“Who?” he asked  “Stan?” 	“Yeah. My stuffed fox.....” She lifted Stan up in the air.  	“Ah, yes...I remember now. I always thought he was a teddy bear. Uh, Dede?I need you to do something with me....Do you want to come?” 	“Sure Grandpa! Just let me get Stan” She got up and ran over to him and picked him up. “Okay...Bye Dean!”   	Dean just sat in the pink flowery chair...looking depressed, over his friend who had just left him there. 	“Good lets go.” He replied.  	“Were we going...to get some candy? Or how about  the toy store? Is Mama and Papa coming with us? ”  	“No dear. We are going to visit a very special friend of mine. She has wanted to meet you for a very long time. You are going to like her. I promise.”  Her Grandpa looked over at her and gave a weary smile.  	The two of them got into the car and drove for about half an  hour and  into New Orleans,  then  made a left,  into the fishing district.  	“Wow Grandpa! Look at all those fish!” Dede looked in amazement at all the big fish and  the other aquatic animals they passed by.   “Can I get one to take home?” 	Her Grandpa only made a chuckle at her question. “ Were do you think we will keep it? These fish are way too big for our house.” 	Dede sighed in disappointment, “ Are we there yet?”  	“Yup....Here we are.”  	 Dede opened the door and swung her legs around so she could jump out of the car.  	“Grandpa? Why dose this place give me the creeps?” 	“It is just a place you are not used to, dear”  	“Oh....” She said while looking to the left and noticing a scarecrow and an old swing set that screeched with the wind. “Stan..” she whimpered, “ Please protect me.”  	Dede also noticed the number of the house was 656, as her Grandpa pushed the door bell, that played an eery song. A squat, fat, woman with short blond hair answered the door, and in a scratchy voice screamed out, “ LUE! How are you darlin”  	“Hey, Matilda. This is my granddaughter Dede. I told you about her yesterday.” 	“Ah yes...Uh, dear? What is that in your arms?” 	Dede held Stan tighter to her chest. “His name is stan.” 	“Oh, how...adorable!” She replied back, “ Come. I will get you a snack.” 	“Ok...” Dede said, and walked into the kitchen for a snack. When the next noise Dede  heard, was the door slamming shut and her Grandpa disappearing. “ Were is Grandpa going?”  	“Oh, he said that he was going to go run some errands. So he wanted me to watch you.” 	“Alright. When will he be back?” 	“Um...dear? I have something to tell you.” 	“Yes?” Dede answered looking up innocently, while trying to feed Stan. 	“Your Grandfather said that he did not want you. He said that your parents hated you, and do not love you. So he brought you here to live with me. I have a nice room all setup, up stairs for you...ok?” 	Dede’s eyes started to water up. “What....I ...  He....Left me here? With you?” 	“Yes dear...I will be your new guardian from now on. Now go up stairs and wash up for diner.”  	“No..” Dede said with her eyes watering more.  	Matilda jumped up and smacked Dede across the face,“What? you little brat! You will do what I tell you, when I tell you to do it! Understand!” 	“Yes, ma’am.”   	“Hello, I am home!” Lue called out.  	A short, lanky man named Bob walked into the room, “ hey Lue. Uh, were is De?” 	Tears started to stream down Lue’s eyes. “I don’t know! I went to the park to get her and she was not there.  I did not see her fox or anything. A lady said she saw a woman walk off with her..But I did not see anything. I looked all day for her.” 	Terrified Bob sat down. “Judy dear! I need you to come here for a minute. Your father has something to tell you about our daughter!”  	A tall woman wearing white cloths, and blond hair came out of the back room. “Yes Father? What is it that you want to tell me? Is something wrong?”  	“Yes baby. You may want to sit. It is terrible news. Dede is missing.” He said.  	“Oh my God.....How? Were? When?” She asked in shock. 	“Today at the park. A lady said she saw a woman walk off with her..But I did not see anything. I looked all day for her.” He repeated.  	“Oh. Bob, call the police. Dad, I need you to come with me to the park.” 	“I already talked to the police. They said there is nothing that they can do but put up posters. They helped me look and talk to people.” Lue testified.  	Judy looked up at her father. Eyes bloodshot and watery as well. “Oh. I...think I need to be alone for a while.” Judy got up and went into her room. Bob soon started to follow but was stopped by her father.  	“Bob, you are a bad father and should have been there with her...maybe then Dede would still be with us.” 	In shock Bob looked at Lue and saw a small grin on his face, and then muttered profanity under his breath. “You....Took her? Didn’t you?”  	“Your words. Not mine” he immediately responded.  	“I can not believe you would do this to your family...Oh! Wait till Judy finds out!” 	“That is not so wise..If you want no harm to come to your child, you will not tell Judy.” 	Bob looked up at Lue and Punched him so hard in the face, that his nose cracked.  	“You little......Oh! You are going to pay for that.....and the only reason I did this, this to protect her from you and your kind. It is all devil magic!” 	“So you did this, because of what me and Judy believe in?” 	“Voodoo is not a belief or a religion, it is wrong!” Lue yelled. 	 I hope Judy will be alright, Bob thought as he walked past the man and out the front door.  	“Were are you going? To have a secret cult meeting!?” Lue yelled out the front door, and Bob just kept on walking. 	  	Judy lay in the fetal position on her bed. Saying a prayer to herself. “Please almighty, protect my beloved daughter by what ever means necessary. I wish for part of my soul to be with her in this dark time for us and her. Amen.” and she rocked herself to sleep.  	   	Mean while Dede was in her new room holding Stan in the rocking chair sobbing in the corner of the empty room. Besides her and the chair she was in, there was a bed and a dresser, and nothing more.  	“I miss my Mommy.” she cried. Suddenly, she felt a little wiggle in her arms, and heard a little voice say, “I can’t breathe! Open your arms a bit!”  	Dede did what the voice told her, and out of her lap Stan jumped fourth.  	“Hi, Dede!”  Stan yelled.  	“Stan!” she yelled in amazement, “How did you...? Why are you? ” 	“Ah, Dun worry about it. I am here to watch over you though. Noone else is here to guide you in life. So, here I am!” 	“YAY! But why do I feel sad still?”  	“Dede I want you to come here for a minute. and get nice and close so you can hear me.” 	“Yeah Stan?” 	He retched up and slapped her so hard that it left a little red mark, “I am not here to answer life’s questions! Only to keep you in line! Got it?”  	“Sorry...You are kinda mean for a stuffed toy. Um..I have one more question? If you do not mind?” 	Stan let out a little sigh, “ what?” 	“ How do I get home with my Mommy and Daddy?” 	Stan smiled and then chuckled,  “Well, that is one good question. I have no idea though. I can only give you one peace of advise, and that is just ride this scenario out. That is all you can do. You are six for Christ sakes.”  	“Christ?” Dede asked 	Stan let out another sigh, “ I will tell you later. It is bed time, and you need your sleep. So got to bed, and sleep tight, I will wake you up in the morning...ok?” 	“Alright!” she exclaimed, and jumped into bed, “Good night Stan....Love you!”  	 Stan blushed as much as a stuff toy could, and then told her, “G’night.”   	The next thing Dede knew she was in a deep sleep, and at home with her family, and Stan was sitting  in her lap laughing at the funny stories of her Grandfather.

      I have no title for this because...I have no real mood right now. (Stupid Mood swings!)  Last night I talked to Rhae! YAY! WE talked for three hours on the phone, Then it died so I talked to her online for another three or four hours.  (^_^)   Then I talked to Theo as well, that was kool cause we both got some Gir Buddy Icons on AIM.  Then I played SpiderMan 2 till about 1 this morrning and went to bed.  I had the weirdest dream last night also. I cant describe it to well but all I remember is a shark. I hate dreams that are weird that I can not remember.   Last night though while I was talking to Rhae online she made me fix all my errors in my sentences...It was actually kinda fun ( that is really weird) But it was all cheese and bisquites. ( I hope that is right)   Well that is al I have to say for now...

      Well since I woke up at nine something this morrning I had been play SpiderMan 2 (with the exception of my 30 minute shower)  I have just beaten Doc Octaviouse so...I think I basically beat the game with the exception of running around afterwards doing what ever... I had also told myself that I was going to clean my room but I have failed to do so thus far into today...Wait I think I said that Yesturday I was going to do it...OH WELL! I want to get me some new games because I have worn out all of mine...And I think I just worn out Spider Man.   Last night I was watching X Games... All it was was the Dirt BMX and free style Moto. They were cool. But I was kinda hoping that Ryan Nyquist was going  to win BMX ( I dunno many other BMX people folk.) I saw him win in 2003 and he seems really cool so that is who I was rooting for. But what ever...   ...I think that is all I have to really say for now...I havent really done much lately.

      Well...This morrning I got up and my dog had crapped on the floor.  So  I had picked it up.   I also had a really weird dream, that all I remember is some dress thingy.  (^_-)   So around Noon Theo called and we whent up to the mall and played this really cool arcade game that is alot of fun. You can shoot people in the nuts and look at their facial expressions.  After that we came back here for a few minutes to get some N64 games, and then went to his house.  We played Mario Tennis, Pod Racer, Wrestling, and then we played Pokemon Stadium...(Along with his older Bro Chris...He is fun to hang with as well)   Then came home ate food, and played Spider man 2 on Xbox fer a minute.  Then I got on the computer and turned on the X Games.  THat is about the gist of today.  Last night I also stayed up until 1:00 a.m. talking to my friend Steph.   That is about all I have to say for today.

      Ok... Once again some stuff had happened to the Computer that I could not control so I am a little behind on my stuff. I havent had alot of contact with folk because I have not had access.   Well I watched and Over watched the Blue Collar Comedy Tour. It was supper funny. I also tried calling Rhae. Once again, her step mum picked up and said she was not home.  I have also been boared (still) and I have no pareticular reason to play Halo anymore because me and Lil'Steve beat it on legendary.   I have also watched the Tv show...Blue Collar Tv. That was really funny as well.   Besides these facts I have not done much but clean up. I need to clean my room again.   OH! I also went to see Dr. Rhoads. That whent well as usuall.  It also rain and flooded twice, and we had two bad storms.  That is about all I can think of to talk about for now   ^_^

      Okay...I am going to try this again because this stupid computer goes slow and there is nothing I can do about it. Last night I started feeling depressed outta no where. I did not do much either. Talked to some folk online, my sister kept getting me mad, my room got messy, and next thing I know I am upset.  I still feel upset, and last night I was going to do stuff to myself ( nothing good)  But Theo told me not to. So  Itold him I wouldn't. Then this morrning when I woke up Juli (my dog) scratched me. SO NOW! It looks like I did what I said I was not going to do. Also last night I had a hard time sleeping. (again) I HATE THINKING SOMETIMES! Then once I finally got to sleep I had a "sick dream" sont ask. So last night while I was thinking, I thought that maybe I do not give Rhae alot of attention. Or at least not as much as she deserves. But it is not entirely my fault. We live realitivly...far from eachother. And due to driving I can not always get to her. And that makes me upset 'cause I can not controll something. ( I am human, I have to be in controll sometimes.) And I feel she gets frustarated with me because of this...  I also thought about my own life...I really need to go see Dr. Rhoads....  Yesturday, I also watched part of The Blue Collar Comedy Tour. That was really funny. I want to be Larry the Cableguy's Best friend.  well I think that is all for now...

      Well...*sigh* were to begin... I feel so alone sometimes. I Know I am not. And am greatful for the fact I have the...4...5 friends that I do.  So I know I am not, but I am starting to get this feeling that I have not had in a long time. (probably since last summer.)  I once again am feeling...like a void to people and am jsut a fourth wheel. Even when I am sitting alone in my room. When I seem to be in big groups I tend to feel left out, when I am with small groups I feel left out, when (rarely though) I am just with one other person I feel left out.  I want to know why these feelings are returning. I have not done much to anyone to feel like this. I want to be accepted for just who I am. (I know it dose not make sense)  Exampe: Meh best bro Theo and I will be together...and then we meet other folk and I am left out again. I know it is not intentional. It just....happens. I also seem to fall in the middle of things alot. (once again not on purpose.)  Sometimes I just want to be with a person and just not have the other person wonder off about "I wonder what they are doing?"  or even wonder off myself about Rhae. I think about her alot and I am not afraid to say it. I just...Don't know what I want. I know for sure though that Rhae is the person for me. I just wonder sometimes if she feels the same. It is kinda hard to tell, eventhough that is the type of person she is. That is also one thing that  attracts mw too her is the fact that she treats me nice like that and  like a person, not an object for her to pick up and use as she likes...  Well that is my current thoughts is the shear fact that  I feel depressed (again)  and like a dementor suck up all the happy from other people. ( And the fact that my sister is pissn' me off again.
