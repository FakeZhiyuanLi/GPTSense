       UPDATE TIME!!! Let's see, what have I been up to?? Well I'm too exhausted to remember what happened on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, so...LET'S START WITH MONDAY!!! Official cross country practice started on Monday *yay!!* (not...). We started 2 a day practices today. I am going to be dead by the end of the week. NOT looking forward to it. It just seems so much harder to run this week, I don't know why. Probably the heat, MAN it can be hot out. Damn Nebraska weather...This morning it was cool, but like 125% humidity. There was fog up the ass, you could like only see 20 feet in front of you, it sucked. I'm already very tired, and I have to leave in 10 minutes to go and run some more! How fun.... Who knows how much longer I'll be able to do this. I am gonna start trying to get to bed by like 9 or so, no more of this midnight crap. *Yawn* Today I had a second interview at Amigos (like 2 months later). After the interview the guy said that I would have a job. It won't be for a few weeks though. He said that he would call in a week or 2 to set up another meeting for filling out paper work. I just wonder how I'm gonna fit this in with cross country. We'll find out later....So, if you like mexican food COME PAY ME A VISIT EVENTUALLY!!! Sure it's not the best job, but hey, at least it IS a job...hehe.....Well CC awaits!!! ADIOS....AMIGOS AHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!!!!!

       Here's some "snips" of my locker checkout process!! MAN I GOT PISSED AT THAT BITCH  !!    Ok, it all started when I lost that little slip of paper with my locker combination on it. I searched for it but couldn't find it. So I went back to the locker checkout bitches and asked if I could get a new lock to put on that same locker (since someone probably picked up my combo on the floor and could get into my locker). She said that I would have to move lockers and couldn't stay in the same one. I told her that I had my lock from last year and could have my mom bring that one to use in the same locker. The lady at the end of the table heard and she got pissed, "You still have your lock from last year? You can't get a locker until you bring the other one back. *lady I was talking to's name* make sure you DON'T let him check out another lock until he brings that one from last year back."  PoopyStinks36324 (8:56:22 PM): after that PoopyStinks36324 (8:56:29 PM): i had to call my mom to have her bring my lock PoopyStinks36324 (8:57:00 PM): and i said on the phone (the bitch didn't hear me but the other checkout lady did) "mom there's this bitch here who i think is PMSing, and i need my lock" PoopyStinks36324 (8:57:23 PM): then the bitch goes PoopyStinks36324 (8:57:37 PM): i just told the executive secratary to get an administrator and we can talk about this PoopyStinks36324 (8:57:47 PM): i start walking away to go outside to wait for my momPoopyStinks36324 (8:57:51 PM): and she goes "come back here" PoopyStinks36324 (8:58:11 PM): "i'd love to stay and chat, but unforutionally i have to go outside and wait for my mom" (*in a very sarcastic and rude voice) PoopyStinks36324 (8:58:27 PM): and i walk away while she keeps yelling at me to come back PoopyStinks36324 (8:58:34 PM): so my mom comes, brings the locks and i walk back in PoopyStinks36324 (8:58:43 PM): and as soon as i enter the bayou area PoopyStinks36324 (8:58:54 PM): i yell REALLY loud "HEY LADY! I GOT YOUR LOCKS!!" PoopyStinks36324 (8:59:28 PM): then she found some paper that said "if you dont return the locks you must pay a fine" PoopyStinks36324 (8:59:32 PM): which makes no sense PoopyStinks36324 (8:59:35 PM): because when u turnned them in PoopyStinks36324 (8:59:40 PM): they gave you 2 dollars back right? PoopyStinks36324 (8:59:44 PM): that shows that the locks were worth somthing PoopyStinks36324 (8:59:56 PM): but she said that the 5 bucks was for renting the locker PoopyStinks36324 (9:00:08 PM): and i was like "well then why do they give you money back when you return the locks?" PoopyStinks36324 (9:01:04 PM): if they give you money back for returing the locks PoopyStinks36324 (9:01:11 PM): that shows that it is worth somtehing correct? PoopyStinks36324 (9:01:22 PM): since i didn't want my 2 bucks back PoopyStinks36324 (9:01:29 PM): they can keep it and use it to buy a new lcok PoopyStinks36324 (9:02:13 PM): but i enjoyed it PoopyStinks36324 (9:02:16 PM): stupid whore

       I just talked to a girl who said she had a dream she had sex with me...Funny....Anyway!!! Not much today, another boring day. Skipped running this morning, slept in a little. I then watched my crap that I recorded onto the DVR (4400, Degrassi, GvB, still got the Dead Zone to watch). MAN THE 44000 FUCKING ROCKS!!!! THAT IS THE COOLEST SHOW EVER!! If you haven't seen it you really should. It just started its first season. THey were just testing to see if people liked it (which they did). Last Sunday was the "Finale". I'm not sure when new episodes will be on but you gotta check it out sometime. On channel 27 (USA I believe) sunday nights at 8. It's AWESOME!!!       Tomorrow is my last day of Drivers ED!! YAY!!!!!!! So boring....I can't stand it!!  Then locker checkout is Friday morning! AHHH SCHOOL IS EXACTLY 2 WEEKS AWAY!!! I DON'T WANNA GO BACK THERE!!! Hopefully the year will go by fast though. Well, I'm off to go play some xbox!! (Since that's all I do and have no life, right Stina??? >:O) Hehe...TTYL
