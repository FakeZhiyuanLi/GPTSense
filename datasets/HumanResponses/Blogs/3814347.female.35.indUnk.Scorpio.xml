       Things have been pretty quiet around here lately.&nbsp; There is much debate going on between Michael and I over the name for the new baby, I still like Zephyr, and he doesn't like it at all!! but what he does like is...get this....Casper!&nbsp; That's the name of my sisters cat!! Jeez.&nbsp; The solar power debate still goes on here too, I posted a note yesterday saying okay, people I want real power, from what I can tell from living on solar for the past 3 years it's totally inferior to grid a/c power....plug me in damnit!&nbsp; We had a visitor wake up in his own piss in the music room, needless to say I had to put a bounce vote on him, because dang that's just in bad form, and besides our alcoholic quota is full thank you very much.....I walked 1.5 miles on the treadmill hoooray, now that's the way to excercise for me anyways...pop in a movie (today was the Bourne Identity--and what I watched I liked) and zone out and forget I was excercising...now I just have to hope the  treadmill doesn't get trashed by the time I have this baby so I can really use it postpartum to get back to some normal semblance of my body...I can't believe the way I look now.....this is not me I tell myself, and the treadmill is by a mirror, it's really depressing....oh well, 4 more months to go...yipeeeee.&nbsp; Cassidy is cutting four top teeth at the same time!! and remarkably in a good mood too...she's such a sport....enough for now, until next time.

       there isn't much going on here the past few days....lets see, there is a nasty stomach flu going around, Michael had it last nite...nasty, I hope Cassidy or I don't get it.&nbsp; The name debate for the new baby still goes on, I am stuck on Zephyr, stuck stuck stuck on it...he named himself before I ever knew I was pregnant, why can't I convience people of that.&nbsp; No one likes the name including Michael so we got the name books and out of 70,000 names I can't find one I like as much....what to do?&nbsp; The weather is terribly hot and humid and the solar power in the house sucks and won't even run our fan all nite so I'm sleeping outside in a tent...geez some life, I shouldn't complain there are many who have it worse, but darnit I want a/c and real electricity, I am so over eco-solar power!! Grid power me baby!!! so off I go back out in the heat...wish me luck that I don't get heat stroke, if my doctor puts me on bedrest this pregnancy I already told Michael and Medcom I'm  doing it in a hotel room they better get used to that idea, I'm not about to do another summer of bedrest with no a/c..forget it...geez can you tell the heat makes me grouchy?  __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

      All is back to normal now, Cassidy is fine, I'm fine...I think I cried more than she did yesterday and she was the one hurt.  Hormones..gotta love em.  Our solar is crapping out on us again and I slept outside last nite because it was so damn hot in the house...we have to get real power.  I'm going to try and call again, there seems to be only one engineer with the power co-op out here in these woods and he's never availible to come out and see about running lines...Michael would like to stay off the grid but now that I have babies (Cassidy and the one on the way this december) I am just not that idealistic anymore.  I want power and I want it now.  Well I'm off to ebay, trying and trying to get Cassidy some robeez shoes...the best is always the most...

       Well today was Cassidy's first bloody injury.&nbsp;&nbsp; The morning started off so good, she was in such a good mood, we were playing in bed and I got up to get a diaper to change her and she was still playing and thought I was gonna "get" her so she lunged, and lunged right off the edge of the bed.&nbsp; My heart stopped, she was screaming and then I noticed the blood...lots and lots and lots of blood pouring out of her mouth...I panicked, what do I do...no phone to call anyone, and who would I call anyways, no ice to give her, no nothing, so I put her in the stroller and headed up to community, halfway there I had to stop cuz I was having a full out panic attack, I sounded like an asthmatic, wheezing and gasping for air, I could not get a breath it felt like my lungs were full of lead, by this time cassidy had stopped crying, she and I both were covered in blood standing in the road....Michael found me in the road freaking out and trying to get a breath, it was not a good  morning....her whole inside top gum is busted open and may even be exposing her teeth which hadn't even started to come in yet, but it's hard to tell because it's hard to get a good look into a 10month old baby's mouth, I have asked and showned the best I could every parent here and they all say although it looks really bad on the inside, babies heal really well and she probably doesn't need to go to the doctor, I couldn't take her anyway, someone else would have to be in there while they held her down to look at it --I can't take anymore screaming, blood, or hurt babies this morning.... I've discovered I'm not good in emergency situations....Maybe it's my pregnancy hormones but I haven't stopped crying about it, I feel like such a failure, if I can't handle a fall off a bed how will I ever get through the broken bones, or stiches, or all the other injuries kids seem to run into.&nbsp; She always seems to get hurt when I'm watching her, the other day I burned her mouth on&nbsp;food  that was too hot,  then I smashed her finger between two pieces of furniture, I'm accident prone and she's bearing the greatest expense because of it.....will she make it into toddlerhood...will I?&nbsp; Surely this day will get better....

       Today will be a fun day, I have the day off from mamahood, and am going over to Marla's house to play with porcelin (sp) clay, we are gonna make little sculptures for our gardens or something like that, we'll also eat alot (too much) and laugh plenty, we always have such a good time.&nbsp; I woke with a headache, still haven't got Michael to put our king size bed in the house yet so I'm still sleeping all cramped and crowded against the wall....I ask and I ask but he really doesn't do things until I get totally bitchy about it....it's a shame really...I mean I would love to be able to do everything myself but I just can't! I'm not even supposed to be lifting my 23lb daughter too much!!!! but why complain on a day like this when I get the whole day off.....hoooray!!!   __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

       Thought I'd drop an email to my blog and see if it worked and posted itself....Not much to write about today, I'm very tired.&nbsp; Didn't sleep well last nite, Cassidy wouldn't give me enough space, we have to get the king size bed installed...hopefully Michael will work on the bedframe today, the ole' queen size is just not cutting it anymore, and it just kills my back....ah yawn.&nbsp; Dinner last nite was awful and I'm really sick of people who can't cook getting in the kitchen and ruining food for 70! I mean if your gonna take on such a job as cooking dinner for 70 people at least make something half edible!! I think pregnancy makes me testy about food issues....I went to the doctor this past tuesday and gained 3lbs in 5 weeks....not so bad not so great...I mean I have to face the fact I'm going to gain weight, I'm pregnant, it happens...I just don't want to gain too much...but dang I'm sooo hungry all the time....my stomache is growling right now!! I'm really into stuffed  jalapenos lately, stuffed with cream cheese, wrapped in bacon and grilled..ooooh god can't get enough of them. Well I'm gonna get going, time for a snack!&nbsp; I hope we get the storms they are predicting for today!! I hear thunder.   		 Do you Yahoo!?  Read only the mail you want -  urlLink Yahoo!

      Well now I've managed to piss Pepper off at me....I left her a bratty note about buying Keirsten subway with the NB amenities budget, all it said was if she gets subway I want subway, basic ramblings of a pregnant woman right? I have creavings right? Well I must of hit a sore spot because she sure got pissed, it really upset me, is it hormones? I cried for a good half hour.  Now I'm over it though.  I mean if she wants to let something like that make her mad, jeez she'd never be around for the real stuff friendships are supposed to endure.  what's her deal anyways...grrrrr....things around here are stressful now anyways, Aviva wants to come back supposedly, crazy as a loon that one! crazy and scary...I don't believe she's really bi-polar, I think she just wants tons of attention and EastWind isn't the kind of community that can give it to her, she has no friends why does she want to come back....she really thinks she will force us to support her....boy will she be surprised...I'm sure I'll have lots to post then of all her crazy antics....wonder if anyone here will ever find my blog....what would they say?

      ack....the weather here has finally taken a turn for the worse and summer has begun, I usually love summer but being pregnant two summers in a row is a bit much.  Guess Bill is probably married by now, ah the one that got away, or the one I threw away, silly me....I could be living a civilized life somewhere other than here....
