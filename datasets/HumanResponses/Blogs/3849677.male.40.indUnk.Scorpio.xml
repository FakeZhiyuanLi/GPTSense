      We sit and pay a small fortune for gas each day and wonder what we can do about it. We hear supply and demand and then send food to the same people who want us to pay more each day for gas. I only have one question. Why?   The same people who charge us what ever they want for thier oil, expect us to send them food that our farmers grew. They will say we have to feed our people and we send them what they need.   We say we need your oil, and they slow down production. Where is the parity in this? If our prices go up they make more money. If they want more to eat we send it to them.  I have one question. Why?  Here is a thought, if they want somthing to eat, drink a nice big glass of oil. What, you say that will not keep you alive? Well how about I will give you a piece of bread for a gallon of gas. You want butter with that? make it a gallon and a half. Would you like some water to wash that down with? Well, that will really cost you.   You see in my opinion we can last longer with out oil than they can last with out food. I can wait them out. Can you? Supply and demand needs to go in both directions. They cut the supplies to raise the prices? We cut the supply to lower the need for food. After enough starve to death, they will want to trade on our terms. Food can be the great equalizer in the battle over oil.  Just my oppinion.  What is yours

      I have been watching as more and more of our people and the people of our friends are killed not in war, but by murdering animals. These people are being killed to scare our people, and make us want to get rid of the present government that is leading us. We as a people must stay together on this. Our leaders need our support. However they also need to do somthing to stop the needles deaths of people who are trying to help the cause. Our military should be hunting down the people who are doing this and very simply when they catch one, show them the pain that they inflicted on our people. There is only one way to let the animals know that we are not going to take it any more. Cut off one head of a terrorist for each one they have cut.   We have to show strenth. This is the only thing that they understand. I am not saying random acts of violence. We are holding terorist prisoner right now. Take one out the the middle of one of thier cities and take his head off. make sure that it is seen, by the people and let them know it will happen each and every time the do it to one of our people.  They see mercy as weekness? Show them none!!!  Just my opinion. What is yours?
