      If you are into writing and want a great community to visit, you need to sign up at   urlLink The Story Board @ www.ezboard.com .  I joined up about a year ago and have never been more pleased with the quality of responses the core members give.  This isn't the busiest writing site on the net, but it is one of the best.

      I took my family out for a night at the circus last night. My oldest daughter Sarah loved every minute of it.  Personally, I found the animal rights protesters more entertaining than the show. Some of them were a little rough in my opinion as they called people "bad parents" and "poor role models" as they walked by.  For some reason they didn't say anything to me. Maybe it was the I eat beef and I'll knock you on your ass if you complain about it look I had on my face.  Either way, we all had a fun night.

       The following is a portion of what was going to be chapter 1 of Scorcher. I have however taken the story in a new direction so the public release of this text is ok.   There are some places in this world that should never be called home. For Scott Nelson, a rundown single bedroom apartment at 1348 Rutger Street was that place. Constructed in 1876 as the Palace Hotel, the dilapidated building stands as a dark reminder of better days long past. Once privy to the elite, the Palace now only housed the destitute and the poor.   Scott wandered through the main lobby, occasionally glancing down at the tired and cracked marble floor. Approaching the grand staircase, his eyes followed the tarnished brass handrail as it flowed up from the main floor to the balcony level. Allowing his thoughts to drift Scott imagined gentlemen in their black tuxedos gingerly holding the white-gloved hands of their escorts as they glided down red carpeted stairs. A magnificent chandelier floated above the staircase, the glass reflecting the light in every direction like finely cut diamonds. At the bottom of the stairs a hotel porter stands at attention in his neatly pressed red uniform and cap. He smiles and nods to the couples as they pass him by.   The giggles of a child abruptly jerk Scott from his fantasy. As Scott turns, ten-year-old Bobby Stevens hurls his bony four-foot body into Scott’s arms. His mother Mary approaches from behind fumbling to hold onto three bags of groceries.  “He’s wondering why you keep looking at those stairs all the time.”  Lowering Bobby to the floor, Scott pats Bobby on the head before relieving Mary of two of her bags. “It must have been wonderful. You know. When this was a hotel.”  Now Mary was laughing.  “Scott Nelson. This place hasn’t been a hotel for fifty years. Why you keep thinking of such things is beyond me.”  “I know. I know. I just wish I could have seen this place when it was worth seeing.”  Turning back towards the staircase, the previous vision of the grand staircase is now replaced with grim reality. The remains of the once richly appointed red carpeting on the stairs is now no more than a few worn sections of cloth clinging to the rotting floor boards. A streamer of yellow tape is tied between the two railings marking the stairs off limits. Standing in the center of the bottom stair, a white sign has been erected with bright red lettering stating that the stairs are unsafe and should not be used.  The brilliant light of the chandelier has died and been replaced with a row of flickering fluorescent lights. Attracted to the light, a large fly circles the ceiling as it buzzes and occasionally hurls itself blindly into the bulbs.  Mary gives Scott a light bump in the shoulder. “Are you going to stare at those stairs all day or are you going to help me get this stuff up stairs?”  “Huh. Oh, sure thing Mary. I’m right behind you.”  Bobby vaults passed Scott and Mary as he races towards the buttons for the elevator doors. Mary’s nose wrinkles as she smiles at her son’s enthusiasm.  Scott eyes the stuffed grocery bags. “Three bags. What’s the occasion? Did Mr. Chin finally give you a raise or something?”  “I wish! I should be so lucky. This has to last two weeks. I just found some good sales that’s all.”  “Well. If you’d like I’ve got a couple of Pizzas left over from work last night in the fridge. You and Bobby could join me for dinner.”  Pleading, Bobby chimes in. “Aw, could we Mom? Please.”  “I’m sorry Scott. I have to work tonight. I’ve been up all day and I really need to get some sleep.”  “That’s ok Mary. I understand. How about leaving Bobby with me and us boys can have a night of pizza and old karate movies.”  “That sounds nice. Are you sure its not too much trouble?”  “Nah. Bobby’s a good kid. We’ll do fine.”  Leaping with his arms in the air, Bobby kicks up his left foot in his best Bruce Lee imitation. “Hi-Ya! All right Mom! Thanks Scott.”

      I spent my week-end building a fort for my daughter Sarah. At least, she believes its only for her. She'll be surprised when Katherine is old enough to play with it. For now, it's easier letting her think its her fort.

      So, you have somehow made it to www.jsimpson.ca and want to know a little about me. Fair enough.  I'm a 30-something Software Analyst with dreams of one day becoming a fiction writer. I have a head full of fantastic story ideas that are screaming to be written. I will share some of them here in the future.  At the moment, I'm a little overwhelmed with the amount of work I have to do. I have a full time programming job at a local hospital. On top of my regular day, I put in an extra few hours at night to help make ends meet.  When I have a spare moment or two, I work on my writing or my video game site  urlLink www.borngamer.com   I have a wonderful wife and two incredible kids. Sarah, my oldest is 4 and Katherine will be 3 weeks old tomorrow (yes, she's quite new).  Whenever I can get my bloody palm pilot hotsyncing again I'll upload some photos of everyone. For now, I have to get back to work.

      I've been humming and hawing over setting up this site for some time now. I wanted to have a place where I could post my thoughts and samples of my writing.  I decided on giving Blogger a try to see how it fits for content. The concept looks pretty good and should fit what I'm going for.  Hopefully this site will aid in my writing rather than distract me from getting to work.

      I've been thinking a lot lately about trying to go into business for myself full time. It's a risky thought, but could be very rewarding.  I've been wanting to do this for a few years now and have always held back. It's pretty safe staying in a well paid job rather than risking it all for the possibility of nothing.  If I can establish a client base before I give up my current job I might feel safer. Being in the programming industry is a tough sell sometimes.

      It's been a busy few weeks since I lasted posted. During the past couple of weeks I have had a long deserved vacation.  We did the Niagara Falls thing for a few days and I managed to catch up on my fishing and some movies.  I also found time to launch  urlLink http://www.devconnection.com  which is a free school for learning web technologies.  The first course is an introduction to HTML and I plan on following up with some more advanced courses such as PHP, MySQL and JavaScript.
