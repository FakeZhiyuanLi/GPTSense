      There I was....in bed at 2 am, starting a new book....The Dork of Cork....a story if an Irish midget--reminded me of other situations in life where I find myself in odd situations and wonder how it is I always tend to manage it...is it normal?  I cant imagine im terribly unique that way...example-- if I am talking to someone really bright and well spoken....in my head Im wishing my mom had breastfed me or taken pre-natal vitamins so I could keep up with these thinking sort of people....my mind goes off on these tangents, thus im not paying close enough attention to even keep up...had i paid attention from the beginning maybe I would feel less *duh*. Since my bothers suicide in 2000 my mind seems to have left me... At 1st I couldnt read a book....or a pamphlet for that matter....or think things through w/o feeling overwhelmed....I can read again but im still scattered and flailing...I forget things....I think maybe I should try some weirdo chinese medicine to help my memory...haha yeah cuz THAT'LL do the trick.... Its bizarre that a person can leave such a hole in a person...Im all for prolonged grieving etc whatever it takes... but I can honestly say w/o an ounce of drama that I will never feel the same again without him around.  Being touched by another human that way makes me feel very vulnerable of course.....what if my daughter dies....?  My sister....my last sibling.....the only one who can make me an aunty...??  Death-while perfectly natural-is a mindfuck...I havent talked about my brother in a while....Ive been keeping him in my head...perhaps why I have this free flowing wave right now to talk about him. His name was Glenn....he was funny....caring in his own hardass/sensitive way.....generous to a fault....a beautiful spirit...To me he was always this little boy I used to play with....the boy who thought Yoda was a really alien in our backyard, living in a woodpile....the boy who used to torment me when we had to share a room....the boy I would beat on...the boy I was taken from during yet another divorce.... We maintained a very close relationship despite distance and time...I truly loved him and my sister.....of course often you dont know just how much a person means to you until theyre gone....and wont ever be back again.   Sometimes knowing just how sad he was inside to take his own life rips and shreds my heart b/c I wish I had the foresight to do more....or turn back time and make him feel more loved...make him feel less alone in the universe. its a sick sick thing to know anyone you love suffers, physically or inside their own head of loneliness, insecurity, dread and sadness... Fuck...I wonder how many things i spelled wrong?  ha....no spell check dammit.... If I reread this I may vomit so I will take my chances....despite the lack of breastmilk and being over vaccinated I am literate....so plz ignore the typos....not that I expect any spectators......I dont really know how blogs work. Im winging it. til we meet again.....
