          Well all the past 2 days were interesting.  First off my tortoise emerged from the bowels and deep dark recesses of my brothers room.  First thig she did?  Eat, Pee, Sleep.  What a wonderful life.  Thursday was an interesting day.  When a back pack RIPS in half from a slight tug, its a cheap backpack I tell you what.  So i gave a new backpack (to the guy which I ruined his backpack) that I got from  urlLink Costco  in 2nd grade.  So its about 9 years old.  The senior prank happened today.  I walked in and there were streamers hanging from the ceiling and all around the the school.  Then there were chairs emptyied from the classrooms and built into pyramids.  After all that plus balloons everywhere they haulded a spray painted  urlLink VW Rabbit  in for all the seniors to sign.  Life is funny.  Thursday night was the awards for the Fine Arts department.  Yours truly came home with three awards.  My BAND pin, JAZZ pin, and Regional certificate.  Friday was all about finals and studying for them.  Xcept in my geometry class where we started PHASE ONE.  I am just weary of my Biology exam.  So much stuff to remember ugh.  On another note I'm really sad about this years Senior Band class leaving.  I dont think I'll ever play with a better, more fun group of kids.  Im gunna miss em all and I know that it wont be the same next year.  SP, PS, DB, VD, JH, CB, JS and all you guys.   -Wilfred   _____________________________________________________________ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Get your own free E-mail at Stewies Minions! http://www.planet-familyguy.com http://www.stewiesminions.com

      Here's a top ten list I came upon a few days back, I hope you enjoy it.   (Courtesy of  urlLink JOKES )  10 Things In Golf That Sound Dirty     1. Look at the size of his putter.   2. Oh, dang, my shaft's all bent.   3. You really wacked the hell out of that sucker.   4. After 18 holes I can barely walk.   5. My hands are so sweaty I can't get a good grip.   6. Lift your head and spread your legs.   7. You have a nice stroke, but your follow through leaves a lot to be desired.   8. Just turn your back and drop it.   9. Hold up. I've got to wash my balls.   10. Damn, I missed the hole again.   Another fun thing I found to use in your free time is a site that transforms your text into computer spoken words.  Tell em to say something dirty and laugh when they say it wrong.  Text to Speech can be found  urlLink here .  -Wilfred

      Mood : Perky  Music :  urlLink VH1 's Most Awesomely Bad Songs (now on Vanilla Ice)  Food in Belly : Root beer and lunch  Thoughts:  Well today was an ordinary day like any others.  But last night was a most interesting of nights.  Gettin ready for my concert i realize that i dont have any slacks that fit because i havent worn any in like a year.  So we go to  urlLink K MART  to pick up a pare and there is none that fit.  So i show up in shorts and a dress shirt and knee high dress socks (sorry i dont have a pic for you :D )  And i end up trading my shorts with my friend Josh who was playing with the Orchestra for his pants.  It was great gettin into his pants (  .  Oh did I mention he has a Blonde afro??  If that isnt comedy then i dont know what is.  Um any way today was a boring day preparing for finals.  Every class is doing nothing but reviewing so no homework so i have a big hole in my schedule.  So  urlLink email me  if you have an idea of something to do.  Any way I'm done boring you.  Take a look at the pics below from the concert last night.  Questions?  Comments?   urlLink Email me   "Rollin by Limp Bizkit makes the Macarena look gangsta" -  urlLink VH1   - Wilfred

      Mood : Tired but relatively moodless Music : None now but going to listen to some LTJ or Fallout Boy Food : Pizza and fries from lunch  Thoughts  Today was just a blah day.  Finals are comin up so were workin on that in like every class.  Makes for boring times after school.  Oh well tonight is the last Official concert for the high school for the year except for Graduation and Europe.  I'll post some pictures of the concert on here later.  Blah Im tired and bored.  Everybody listen to the Acadamey and THESTEREO and any band by  urlLink Fueled By Ramen .  Um, I guess i'll sign off for today, I'll be back with the pics later.  So Peace Out.

      Mood : Sleep and ticked Music : Fallout Boy TTTYG LP (finally got it) Food in belly :  Spaghetti and Stromboli and JELLO  Thoughts:  But on a lighter note I finally, after 1 1/2 of waiting got my Fallout Boy LP (yes records, gotta love em)  Music YOU should be on the outlook for is,  Fallout Boy, THESTEREO, Less Than Jake ( as always ), Yellowcard (and their new video), always be open the The Vandals, help say goodbye to Five Iron Frenzy by listening to them (you'll laugh you'll cry you'll feel awkward and guilty after you do), and lastly, um,  I guess when it comes out pick up the Beastie Boys new album:  To The 5 Burroghs or w/e its called.  My day??  Well it started off drearily enough in biology when we watched a video called   Sexual Encounters . . . . of the Floral Kind .  Then boring nothingness till lunch when a most awkward of moments aroused when i was told I was to have someones babies.  Weird people are great.  "Get Naked".  Then i got sucked in to playing with the concert band tomorrow night or depending what time you read this, tonight, yesterday, three weeks ago, etc.    Watch out for Mis-informed or Without Limitations i guess which ever one gets goin first.  Ill see you on the flip side.  "..well f*** i guess the 80's are back in a big way in Germany.." - Vinnie (LTJ)  -Wilfred

      Food: Stromboli and mini pizza  Music:  Less Than Jake live in Europe  Mood:  Cheerful (i guess)  Thoughts:  Ahh the days of summer  Monday was tiring, me and my friends walked around town and stuff in the hot sun for about 3 or 4 hours.  Then i started to rebuild my band after 3 of the members quit.  So nothing eventful.  Mmmhmm  Today is just another blah summer day.  Im surfing the net lookin at german sites that have  urlLink less than jake  live videos on it.  stuff is weird, people are weird.  "whose drunk besides me??" -LTJ  Well I cant wait for sept. 1st when me and my friend david get to go to Projekt Revolution and i get to hang with the boys from LTJ  Visit the  urlLink Mis-Informed  blog for updates on the reformation of the band and updates and hopefully a song!!  If you want to check out new artists and maybe some you already know, head over to  urlLink PureVolume   which is where we will put our music for you all to hear when we get it done!  -Wilfred  --End Transmission--

      Welp, its tuesday, first round of finals DONE, second round of finals TOMORROW  Boring, BORING, BORING day.  I cant wait for school to end, I will no longer be a freshie  Yey  Im just wasting space, so tired  Maybe ill pu a joke up here  Top Ten: Questions that Make You Go, "Huh?"      How much deeper would the ocean be without sponges?    What happens if you get scared to death twice?    If the #2 pencil is so popular, why is it still #2?    If all the world is a stage, where is the audience sitting?    If you write a book about failure, and it doesn't sell, is it a  success?    If love is blind, why is lingerie so popular?    If you ate pasta and antipasta, would you still be hungry?    If Superman is so smart, why does he wear underpants over his trousers?    If a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat?    Why is it that if someone tells you there are 1 billion stars in the universe, you will believe them, but if someone tells you a wall has wet paint you will have to touch it to be sure?
